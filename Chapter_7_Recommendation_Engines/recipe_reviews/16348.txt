I took some advice from pervious reviewers and made sure that I fried the chops until the outside was very crispy (make sure the oil is hot before adding the chops, makes a difference in how tender they turn out).  I also doubled the gravy, and used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can golden mushroom.  That really helped keep the dish from having that "some kind of meat covered w/cream of mushroom soup" taste.  I also sauteed some fresh mushrooms in the pan I'd cooked the pork in and added them to the soup mixture.  I added some extra garlic and just a couple dashes of cayenne.  I cooked the chops for 20/20.....needed less cooking time I think cause I'd browned them so well.  Turned out wonderful!

I intended to submit this review two weeks ago & since then, my husband has requested this dish three more times.  I did change a couple things.  I baked for 35 minutes and warmed the sauce in a pot on the stove rather than pouring it over the chops.  I also used cream of chicken rather than mushroom, since we're not mushroom fans and doubled the milk rather than using wine.  It turned out fabulous.  THANKS so much for this recipe!

This smells great after you take it out of the oven, and the preperation wasn't as long as I thought it would be.  I did not bake them for as long as the recipie called b/c I ran out of time.  They were done after 35 min and everything tatsted great, very tender and juicy.  The sauce textrue was "just right", not too watery and not too chunky.  One suggestion I have is to make double the sauce if you like to dip the meat because you'll wish you had more after you try it.  I substituted the white wine with Vermouth, and next time I am thinking of adding more of the Vermouth or white wine and taking away some of the milk.  This I think will strenghthen the taste of the sauce to be even better as the wine/Vermouth seems to play a big part in the taste of the whole meal.  A note of caution: be careful not to burn the pork chops when frying, keep the heat at med/high and check often, I "saved" them just in time :).  A+

Excellent recipe!  Past reviewers that complain the dish is soggy possibly don't understand that the breading is INTENDED to soften up.  I think the breading is just for a little color and flavor.  It was not intended to stay crunchy while being baked in a lot of sauce.  Anyway, I served this with mashed potatoes and asparagus and it was delightful.  Only things I would clarify are that I used Lawry's brand seasoning salt, Chardonnay for the wine, and I only used 4 pork chops with the same amount of gravy in the recipe.  The perfect amount was left to drizzle over the potatoes.  Maybe a little more wine could be added next time.  Thanks again!!

Breaded pork chops are always a hit with my husband and I've been making pork chops like this for years. I always use Italian style bread crumbs and just eyeball extra seasonings to add like garlic powder, cracked black pepper, dried parsley, Italian seasoning and some grated Parmesan cheese. I always dip my pork chops into the egg/milk mixture then the seasoned bread crumbs and then repeat that procedure (double dipping). This gives the pork a thick breading and keeps it moist while baking. To cut calories and time I spray the bottom of a glass baking dish with Pam, place the breaded pork in (no frying needed) then spray the pork with a little Pam, cook at 350 for 20 minutes, turn and cook for another 25 minutes. They'll come out moist and tender. This recipe has the pork cooking for way too long - it'll dry right out! And, there's nothing worse than dried out pork. I tried the soup mixture over top and well, it was OK.  I poured it over half the chops during the last 15 minutes of cooking.  I think I'll stick to the breaded pork chops without the soup mixture.....

Man......THESE PORK CHOPS ARE SLAMMING!!!  I can't even describe how friggin good and tender they were!!!  I followed the recipe, but I did make a few changes........of course.  I followed some others' advice and added golden mushroom with the cream of mushroom.  That, along with the white wine, is the key to this wonderful tasting dish.  I also added some sauteed mushrooms and green onions to the sauce right before I poured it on the chops.  Make sure you use a non-stick cooking spray on the bottom of the pan before you start baking so the coat on the pork chops doesn't stick.  I served this along with the Angel Chicken Pasta recipe I found on here.  It was a very rich meal, but worth every calorie we digested.  Put it like this........I have a cousin who can not stand ANY VEGETABLE KNOWN TO MAN.  You know what...........he had three servings the first night. That was one of the best compliments I could've gotten.  Thank you Dawn for this better than OUTSTANDING RECIPE!!!

I love these folks who alter a recipe and when it comes out a disaster blame the initial recipe! The problem... dear folks is not the recipe...it's YOUR changes. I have used this recipe "as is" on several occasions for 20-36 people and I can assure you...IT ROCKS1 Let's be fair...if you alter a recipe accept the results and admit YOU messed up!.

This was great! I too have a fear of making something that tastes like your greasy spoon tasteless meat & canned mushroom soup. So--using someone's idea of boneless chops, I doused the chops with bottled minced garlic, rubbed them with a bit of Kitchen Bouquet, used sour cream instead of milk, used Lindeman's Chardonnay(an inexpensive but but very good Australian wine, threw in about 1 or 2 T sweet Hungarian paprika, & a lot of fresh, sliced, sauteed mushrooms. Did all that make it any better than the original? Don't know, but I do know it got rave reviews. Thanks, Dawn--I've already done this 2x for company, & will do it again till I've run through my list of friends. Jean in Honolulu

I normally don't care for pork chops, but decided to give this a try. It was excellent. I did change a few things though. I used 2 huge butterfly pork chops (instead of 6). I doubled the sauce-used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 2/3rds cup of white wine (I used Chardonnay) and only used 3/4 cup of milk. I sauteed an onion in a tsp of oil first, then added the gravy mix. Heated that up and topped it over the chops. I also cut down the cooking time-45minutes/30minutes. Turned out increadibly tender. My husband had seconds.

I just made this last night and it was delicious!  It definitely is not just another blah pork chops w/cr. of mushroom soup recipe.  My picky 3 1/2 year old and 18 mth. old ate it up!  I used 5 1-inch thick boneless chops - seasoned w/roasted garlic & pepper blend as well as Nature's Seasonings.  Baked 45 min.  I sauteed some onions and a can of mushrooms (didn't have fresh).  We like a lot of sauce so I used a can of cr. of mushroom and a can of cr. of celery.  Added 3/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup Chardonnay, sprinkled a bit of paprika, cayenne and parsley.  Baked 25 minutes, then served over rice.  Definitely a keeper!

I was NOT impressed with this recipe.  The pork was tender but lacked a strong flavor.  The steps to prepare it left a lot of dirty dishes too.  The cooking time was as other reviewers mentioned off as well.  I did 30 min before adding the soup mixture and 30 after.

OK this is like the 10th time I have made these. The first time I made them they were AWESOME, so tender and juicy they fell off the bone, every other time I made them they didn't turn out tender like they did the 1st time. This is what i learned, DON"T use wicked thick pork chops, I used center pork chops w/bone. I used chops about 1inch thick, Make sure your oil and pan are hot before you add them. brown them well on both sides. I always double the soup, It gives you tons of sauce, but more the better. I also sauteed some fresh sliced mushrooms in the pan I fried the pork chops in then i added to the soup. The most important part of this is NOT to use wicked thick pork chops, they wont come out as tender as they should. I made this last night just like i said and again my husband said they were the best pork chops he has had. hope these tips help. this is definetly a keeper. thanks again dawn

There's always a few people out there who are in the minority when it comes to a great recipe and I'm one of them.  My husband and I are not pork lovers but I thought I'd give this one a try.  I made this with a pork tenderloin and lowfat/low sodium soup.  Baked for 20 min. then poured on gravy and baked, loosely covered, for another 20.  Meat was very tender but totally lacked flavor.  I even added 1 T dried sage to gravy.  It didn't help.  Also, I did not bother using the olive oil when browning.  Perhaps if I had followed the recipe the outcome would've been better.  In any event, I won't be making this again.

What a great recipe!!!  I used boneless pork tenderloins, doubled the gravy using cream of chicken and mushroom soup, and chicken broth instead of the wine.  I decreased the frying time to about 2-3 minutes per side and the baking time to 20 minutes/45 minutes with the soup mixture.  (It required less time because the tenderloins were not very thick). I also followed the advice of other reviewers and sprinkled some french onion soup mix into the bread crumbs and all over the top of the dish after covering the pork with the soup mixture.  The pork chops were so tender and moist and the gravy was delicious on mashed potatoes, too.  The dish was very flavorful due to extra garlic powder and the french onion soup mix.  My husband said, "this is the best pork chop recipe I've EVER had!"  I have never seen him this enthused about any recipe!  My extremely picky 9 year old loved it too. I, of course loved it and have included it in my family favorites.  I find it very helpful to review the remarks of others for tips on modifying recipes.  I'll be making this again soon!

Like most cooks, I like recipes that are simple and to the point.  If I don't have each and every ingredient in the cupboard, I improvise.  This recipe turned out very good, even though I did not have all the required ingredients.  I seasoned my pork chops with some garlic pepper after patting them dry, and proceeded to follow the directions to the letter, minus the wine.  I have never been a huge pork chop fan, but I had a package of some center cut chops in the freezer, and decided to try a recipe from this site.  The pork chops came out quite tender and tasty, and it's true...you won't need a knife to cut the chops. The breading on the chops was very good, and the gravy made from  the soup and combined with the porkchop drippings, was excellent. Preparing the chops for the oven was not difficult, and the only "drawback" that I can find with making these chops is that it does require some extra cooking time, something we all don't seem to have any more.  Make time for these chops. As I said, I did not use each and every ingredient in this recipe,  and as far as I'm concerned, the integrity of the meal was not compromised.  This is a great way to prepare the meat, and it went fast in my household.  I will make this again, and have added it to my recipe box.

This was excellent!  My kids gobbled it up and asked for seconds.  I love the wine flavor...next time I might pull back on the milk and add a little more wine.  Also I agree with others that the time may be a bit off... my chops were boneless and about a 1/2 inch thick.  I fried on high heat until crispy (prob only 2 mins on ea side not 5 as the recipe states).  Then I baked them for 30mins w/o sauce and then 30mins with sauce.  They were just perfect for us...tender, moist, and definitely not over cooked.

These were the BEST chops I've had in a long time! Thought it would be kind of bland, but not so at all!  One of the things I changed was the cooking time, which I cut back to an hour total.  After about 30 minutes of cooking, I added the gravy/sauce to finish off this dish.  Otherwise, the pork gets tough and leathery.  Also, I added more wine (about 3/4 cup), less milk (1/4 cup), to the soup, and it just POPPED with flavor!!! Make sure to really  brown your chops too, so the breading doesn't get mushy.  Oh my gosh!  My six year old LOVED this!  Served over rice makes an excellent meal.  I don't agree with others who said this took too much time to make.  Well worth the effort!  Over a thousand people couldn't be wrong with this one!  :)

I made these pork chops for my boyfriend and I last Sunday.  We both enjoyed them.  I was worried that the breading would turn to mush, but it was fine.  I omitted the wine completely and mixed the mushroom soup with a 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead.  After I browned the chops in oil and placed them in the oven, I sauteed a vidalia onion and a bunch of fresh sliced mushrooms in broth and minced garlic.  Smothered the pork chops with them before covering all with the mushroom soup/broth gravy.  Only baked an additional 1/2 hour and they were cooked through and very tender.  Served them with rice and green peas.  It was delicious!

I didn't get to taste this, as I was out for the evening, however, my gang loved this recipe and told me so the moment I walked in. I used my mandolin and very thinly sliced three potatos which I seasoned with garlic and onion powder, pepper and a little italian seasonings and placed on the bottom of the casserole dish. I doubled the sauce and used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and beer in lieu of the wine. After quickly frying the chops, I placed them on top of the potatos and immediately added the sauce and popped them in the oven for about an hour. Cooking time would most likely have been a little less had I preheated the oven sooner. Thanks so much Dawn!

Very moist, tender, tasty pork chop is  the end result.  It's so nice to eat pork chops that are not dry!  The coating & pan fry prior to baking, I believe, seals in the moisture so don't skimp on the initial steps.  I like spice and not a lot of salt so mixed equal amounts of garlic powder, onion powder & celery salt for a rub prior to the dredging, egg, bread crumb coatings.  Being cautious to avoid drying out the meat, I cooked covered for 1/2 hr.only then added the sauce as intructed for another 1/2 hr. Perhaps if using thicker cuts I may cook longer.  I suggest using the white wine in your sauce - chardonnay works well for my cooking needs.  It flavors the sauce which otherwise would be bland.**I buy the 4pk. of small wine bottles that are now sold in stores to avoid having to open a full bottle if not consuming the wine with dinner. You then have wine on hand for cooking anytime**

My husband is a big white meat eater....and chicken gets kinda boring after a while.  His mom made him eat pork all the time....so when he hears pork is for dinner he does his yucky face.  He took one bite of this and loved it.  He had no idea pork could taste good again.  Thanks for posting.

I use this site alot. I have found some really good recipe's. I do not usually take the time to rate any of them. This recipe is so good I really wanted to let Dawn (the author) any everyone else that wants a excellent Baked Pork Chop recipe. This is it. Note: my wife hates mushrooms and I had to substitute cream of chicken soup. EXCELLENT.*********

These are good...nice flavor, good sauce, meat tender.  I made it for two people and followed the recipe, except I cut the amount of milk in half and made that up by increasing the white wine by the same amount, for a little more wine flavor.  Don't be afraid to leave them in the oven for the entire 90 minutes called for in the recipe because baking them that long does break down the meat (think "crockpot cooking" where that happens as well), so that it becomes tender (some reviewers have mentioned they were afraid to keep them in that long).  Will make these again as a standby weeknight meal.  PS:  Have also made it using CHICKEN and it worked well.

YUMMY!!!  I am a working mom and did this recipe in stages and it worked well.  I breaded the chops in the morning and let cool.  I made the wine/cream sauce and left in fridge.  My daughter popped the chops in when she came home from school and 30 minutes later poured the cream sauce over.  They were cooked with foil covering them and when I came home from work the house smelled great.  Great taste - even leftover - will try again!!!!

Gota go with the majority.  This is excellent.  I substitute a jar of chicken gravy or pork gravy which ever I have on hand, for the cream of mushroom soup.  Give it a try!!

Stunningly perfect exactly as written. If you're one of those that feel you have to "mess" with a recipe (like so many do for whatever weird self-serving reason they do) you're wasting your time on this one.  It's perfect.

I am sorry, I must be in the extreme minority when I say this was awful! I read the reviews and took note of any modifications, etc. but this recipe is beyond help. I tasted like a Campbell's soup recipe, despite the claims that it did not. My husband and only ate our sides. I am going to stick with recipes that use fresher ingredients as opposed to processed ones, based on the number of positive reviews I thought I would give it a whirl. This recipe is nothing special and not one fresh ingredient, but the meat, goes into this. The flavor of the sauce is very generic and again, processed. I felt like at some point I should have added Velveeta. If you like cream of whatever soup recipes, I suppose you will enjoy this. However, if you enjoy entrees of a fresher fare, keep looking!

This recipe is fabulous.  Instead of using the white wine, I used brown gravy and added a can of mushrooms to it.  Very, very good!

I have never made a pork chop that was so tender that my knife lay unused and forgotten until I used this recipe. 

I did make a few changes, though, so I could not rate it a 5. 

To start, I seasoned my breadcrumbs further with garlic powder, salt, pepper and Italian Herb Seasoning. I browned the chops in a med-high pan until brown on both sides (by the last batch it took less than 5 minutes per side, the first batch a little longer).  

I doubled the sauce recipe. I sauted 2 slices of diced bacon over low heat. Once it was cooked through (but not crisp), I added 1/2 c diced onion, 4 cloves of minced garlic, and a can of sliced mushrooms. I then added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 of cream of chicken (all I had). I substituted half chicken stock/half apple juice for the wine (I had no wine in the house), and added a cup of milk. I seasoned to taste with salt, pepper, a little garlic powder (we're big garlic fans) and Italian Herb Seasoning. I let the sauce simmer on low for 15 minutes. 

I only cooked the chops for 30 minutes before adding the sauce, and then another 30 minutes after. I probably could have taken them out 10 minutes sooner than I did. Served with mashed potatoes (with the extra sauce poured over them). 

Hands down the best pork chops I've ever had, let alone made. Will be keeping this recipe.

I finally decided to try this since over 1,000 other people have.  I had expected it to be boring - and it wasn't.  I followed the advice of some of the other submitters.  I did saute fresh mushrooms and scallions and added it to the soup.  Glad I did.  I did fry the chops until they were "extra" crispy.  Glad I did.  My cooking time was on 20 min., then 30 min. and they were perfect.  I used 1/4 cup of cream and the rest wine - Glad I did.  The only thing that I am not glad I did was to double the sauce.  The chops were a bit soggy - if I had left it at the ratio that the submitter gave, the sauce would have only come up to the sides of the chops and you would have enjoyed the bread crumb flavor.  I will definitely make this again.  The sauce (definitely use more wine!!!!) was delicious - was not at all boring!  Thanks Dawn.

very good.  I hate porkchops and hubby special requested some so I bought them.  Hating porkchops my whole life I had no Idea how to cook them.  This was awesome.  I used white cooking wine (cheaper than regular wine and more functional since we don't drink)  I did the 40/30 cooking time.  Served with Mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, corn and dinner rolls.  I was even eating the pork chop off my sons plate(he wasn't hungry)  Thank you.

We are literally snowed in today.  My 4 year old's bicycle is in our front lawn and the only visible part of the bike are the handle bars! And so I really having nothing better to do than cook.  I'm just adding my little thoughts to the already 600+ reviews.  These chops are nice and tender.  I use boneless pork chops and have to cut them in half because they are usually about 2 inches thick!!  (Only at Costco of course).  I like to add chopped mushrooms & onions for hubby's sake.  Works well in a slow cooker too!  Good recipe Dawn.

Extremely yummy, did not use cooking wine and used chicken cream soup. This would be good with chicken breast and you could also put thinly sliced potatoes on the bottom before adding pork chops.

I classify my recipes as either "weekday" recipes or "weekend" recipes, which are usually more restaurant-fare or extra-special.  My classification doesn't necessarily indicate when I make them though.  This takes a while to make so you might prefer to make it on weekends.  This is a 5-star "weekday recipe" but DO NOT USE THICK CHOPS!

I made this twice, once with standard 3/4 inch boneless chops and once with 1 1/2 inch chops.  The 3/4 inch chops were indeed fork-tender, the thicker ones were good but had pork's typical chewy texture.

No one would ever know you used a can of condensed soup for the sauce, it was so creamy and rich-flavored, especially if you sprinkle a bit of onion powder and thyme on the chops when seasoning.


Watch the temp when browning the chops.  Olive oil tends to burn quickly and sure enough, I burned the second side the first time I made this.  Perhaps that is why the breading fell off right before I served dinner.

I will definitely make this again and again!  In fact, it replaced my usual pork chop recipe.

These chops were okay.  The pork chops were tender, if not a little dry.  The sauce was a little bland.  I added some parsley and paprika to give it color.  I would suggest trying a little garlic too.  It just doesn't have a lot of taste.  I probably won't make it again.

This recipe was very delicious.  I didn't have wine, so I omitted that and added extra milk.  Came out great.  I also didn't keep the pork chops in that long, just 35/20 and they came out perfect.  I also used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  Great recipe.

I really enjoy this recipe.  Instead of bread crumbs I just use Kentucky Kernel preseasoned flour. I also add fresh crimini mushrooms ontop and lots of onion to add to the fabulous flavor.  I sometimes don't have white wine on hand but it still comes out great without it.

I cannot believe all of the good ratings for this recipe (perfect example of 'groupthink'!)  This was awful!  First of all, it is way too much work for the simple flavor you end up with.  The gravy that is formed is basically full of fat and unappealing since the fat from the chops mixes in with the gravy as it bakes and there is no way to seperate it out. If I were to ever make again, I would skip the flour-egg-bread crumb steps and just saute the chops in a little olive oil sprinkled with rosemary and pepper.  I would then bring the sauce to a simmer in the same pan and skip the baking step all together.  But I don't think I'll bother making this again...sorry!

You know I read the reviews and I thought how could 800+ people be wrong. Well, now I know it is possible. While the pork was tender, fried up beautifully and smelled heavenly while it cooked, it was a huge let down. Maybe it was the 2 hours I had invested in it or all the reveiws that got my hopes up-- I don't know but I was disappointed. It was ho-hum and ordinary. Had I not spent 2 hours preparing the dish with my oven turned on to 350 degrees in the hot summer heat, I'd probably be a little more pleased. But I'm not. It's a good dish, but to me it wasn't worth the wait.

This is my husband's favorite pork chop recipe. I use Pepridge Farms stuffing mix (pounded up a bit to make it more like bread crumbs)-- makes for a nice, crunchy coating.  We love it with rice. Thanks for a great recipie, Dawn!

I made these last night and they were AWESOME.  My husband doesn't even like Pork, but he loved this. 

Changes I made, I baked the chops, after browning, for 45 minutes covered, then uncovered for another 15.  I did like other reviewers suggested, and made the sauce separately, rather than pouring it on top.  Kept the crust crispy.  I also made the sauce in the pan I used to brown the chops, and added a dash of italian seasoning, for more flavor.  Incredible.

This came out great! I used 1/2 inch chops so I didn't use the given cooking time (1.5 hrs would render my chop too inedible). I seasoned the chops with kosher salt and Tony Chachere's and a bit of garlic powder before dredging, then followed the recipe (except I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom).  I fried them as directed, put in the oven for 15 minutes then added the sauce for another 20. Turned out juicy and delicious (though the bottoms of the chops (and breading) stuck to the pan, I may use some Pam on the bottom next time).

I used 2 large centercut boneless chops, about 1 inch thick and left the sauce ingredients the same.  They turned out tasty and very tender,  however, after baking for an hour covered, the juices (steam) from the meat made the coating completely soggy, which later separated from the meat into the gravy.  Update 11/04: I prepared this again last night using the same cut of chops.  I baked them for 45 minutes on a rack, unconvered to get the coating to crust.  Then, I added the gravy mixture over the top but in a large enough pan so that they wouldn't be "swimming" in it.  Covered it with foil, and baked for another 30 minutes.  This works for me.  Excellent.  Oven time should be adjusted to the thickness of your chops.  P.S.  Loved the wine in the soup and added a little minced garlic.  The gravy was excellent over extra-wide noodles, and a green vegetable completes this great meal.  Thanks!

This recipe had a great taste! I must have used pork chops that were way to thick, bc it took them 4ever to cook! I had to microwave them in the end so we could eat b4 9pm. I also used milk in place of the wine and 2 cans of soup. I will make this again, but with thinner pork chops.

My family gobbled these right up.  I browned them in an electric skillet and decided I did not want to dirty another dish, so after I browned them I removed them from the skillet, stirred in the sauce ingredient ( I doubled up on the ingredients per recomendations from other reviewers) then returned the chops to let them simmer for a while.    Sauce was tasty with the added flavor of the pan drippings.

This recipe was good - the pork chops were sooo tender. The wine really added a great flavor. I increased the amount of seasonings to bump up the flavor. I, too, will SKIP THE BREADCRUMBS next time, as a previous reviewer suggested, and simply season the chops and dredge in flour. With the breadcrumbs, the finished product was a soft, bland breading that really isn't necessary in this tasty dish - then this recipe would rate 4 stars.

Having installed a built-in backyard grill a few years back, I was under the impression that all meats MUST be grilled!  During a rainy week with pork chops that needed to be used, I tried this recipe.  Wow!  I don't think I'll ever grill another pork chop.  I'm not certain if I'm rating the RECIPE or the COOKING STYLE, but for whatever reason, this deserves FIVE stars.   I put out steak knives to cut them, but when the meat literally fell off the bone while I was serving them, I realized knives were not needed.  Oh gosh!  Now I'm hungry!

I used boneless pork chops and cooked it 30/30 minutes.  They turned out excellent!! Very tender and flavorful.

With 3200-plus reviews already, my input will get lost.  Still.... am feeling compelled to boast about this recipe.  I hardly ever fry meat.  I've attempted frying with a coating in the past (and then finishing in the oven), but the coating always falls off.  Not this one!  The secret was the flour/egg/breadcrumb step.  I used four boneless loin chops, and they were huge, so I followed the instructions for baking.  For the sauce, I sauteed onion and fresh mushrooms in the same pan in which I fried the chops (adding a few cloves of minced garlic the last minute of sauteing).  Then added a couple cans of cream of whatever soup, 1/2 cup good quality dry sherry, and about 1/2 C. fat-free half and half.  Everyone raved.

This was a good recipe. My son, who is the pickiest of all eaters, ate it! I did just like most people. I seasoned the pork chops with salt/pepper/garlic then flour/egg/bread crumbs, fried until browned then put in the oven. I also doubled the recipe for gravy and added a bit more seasoning to that for my families taste. A keeper!

UPDATE: I put the meat into the crockpot after I browned it, added 2 cans soup mix, 1 c. milk, 2/3 c. wine. This made the best quick (after football practice) gravy...just add mashed potatoes and a veggie...yummmmm!

Well, I guess my problem was that I got huge boneless pork chops from Whole Foods, and cooking them even a half hour longer than the time said did not make them turn out. I was so excited about this for a nice Sunday evening meal and it was inedible. All those reviwer comments about them being so tender - well, I couldn't cut mine with a knife even. I collected the uneaten parts from everyone's plates and threw the whole mess in the slow cooker. I've been cooking them on low for the past two evenings, and now, on Tuesday, I'm having some for lunch. It's good, but obviously not the nice dinner I worked so hard on for my fiancee and friends. I was so disappointed in this. So much work for what amounted to nothing but a bunch of hungry guests.

Wow!  Delicious!  I'm not a pork chop lover and I LOVED this!  My husband and kids gave it thumbs up as well.  I cut back on the white wine--as my kids don't like "winey" tasing sauces.  Next time I'll leave it out completely and subsititute apple juice.  Thanks for this recipe!

I had some doubts about the cooking time being to long and that the chops would be tough. They received rave reviews from my family. I did not have any white wine on hand so I increase the milk to 1 cup and that seem to be fine. Will definently make again.

Great, easy Pork chop recipe.  I made sure that I cooked the chops for a long enough time in the olive oil so that they would be crispy.  They were not soggy at all in the end!  I did cut the baking time down to 25 minutes without sauce and 30 minutes with the sauce since I only used 3 pork chops.  For the sauce, I threw some mushrooms into the left over olive oil (from cooking the pork chops) and added the soup, wine and milk to the pan.  What a great blend of flavor.  Oh and before breading the chops I rubbed them with some seasoning salt, paprika and pepper.

Excellent!! Loved this recipe. I used 4 boneless center cut pork chops....followed directions exactly and this meal turned out great. Hubby loved this....chops were tender and juicy...I didnt have white wine, so I used white zifendale and sauce was very tasty. I also browned the chops and baked covered for 25 minutes and then added the sauce....and baked covered for another 25 and they were perfect. I cut down on the cooking time because I used less chops and they were not that thick. Next time I will add sauted mushrooms to the sauce....will make again soon!!

These were the most tender juiciest pork chops I have ever made! I did makes some minor adjustments though.  Like others have said I deleted the wine and used more milk, but I also sauteed some sliced onion and mushrooms in butter and added that to the cream mixture before pouring over the chops. YUM!  Even the kids loved this one.  Will be making this one over and over!  Thank you so much for offering this one to us!

This is my husband's favorite dinner that I cook and it's so easy.  I made it for a dinner party and they raved about it.  They even called me later in the week to tell me how wonderful it was.  My 18 month old daughter even loves it, and it's so tender she has no trouble eating it with only 3 teeth.
I have tried it with just the cream of mushroom soup, and have found that we like it much better with both cream of mushroom and cream of chicken. So I add a can of each and another 1/2 cup of milk.  I don't have any white wine in the house, so I've never made it with the wine, and now I don't think I ever would. I usually make 4 pork chops at a time, so I bake the chops for 45 minutes and then add the soup mixture and bake for another 25 and it turns out perfect every time.

A hit...I doubled the milk, wine, and used 2 cans of soup (cr mush & golden mush).  I also added 1 chopped sauteed onion with sauce.  I used 1" bone in chops and the cooking time was perfect.  I served over egg noodles - great with the extra sauce.

This was phenomenal!  I made it as a last minute dish and I can't believe how good it is.  I followed the recipes *almost* exactly.  I doubled the sauce (I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken), half&half instead of milk, and added a dash of Cheyenne pepper to the sauce.  The only thing I *sort of* did differently was the sauce.  I sautéed some diced green peppers and onions in the pan which I had used to brown the pork chops.  So the pork chop seasoning and juice also became part of the sauce/gravy.  Next  I added the half&half and wine with about a table spoon of flour.  I continuously stirred while I let it heat for maybe 3-5 minutes, then added the canned soups.  Then I continuously stirred the mixture for maybe 5-7 minutes until it started to simmer.  Lastly, I added maybe a tablespoon of Gravy Master and stirred that in. I poured all of the sauce over the pork chops. I cooked the pork chops for 30 minutes (as I was concocting the sauce,) then poured the sauce over them and cooked for another 30 minutes covered.  I served with seasoned mashed potatoes topped with the pork gravy and some steamed mixed veggies.  AMAZING!

So this is my first time making this recipe and I did a few things different... I added 8oz of sour cream and did not add the white wine sauce. I also added a few other seasonings to the sauce like sazon (spanish), dill, and onion powder. I paired them with asparagus and a cheesy bacon penne. A FREAKIN MAZING!!!!

Absolutely delicious. These are time consuming, and do require quite a few steps, but the end result is well worth the work. Savory, with a great flavor, maybe just a tiny bit on the salty side (which I tend to like, but if you don't maybe just use a low sodium soup). Gobbled up by grown-ups and kids in our house alike.

One of the best baked pork chops ever! I made a few changes. I got the thick pork chops, seasoned them with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Let it sit overnight in the fridge. Followed the flour-egg-bread crumbs instructions. Then let it bake for 1.5 hours in the oven. I opted not to add the mushroom sauce over it while in the oven, instead offered it on the side, all warmed up (over low heat in a saucepan.)  Served with white rice and corn on the side.

I've been doing a version of this for years. Bonelsss chops, trimmed of all visible fat, breaded, fried, then transferred to baking pan with a rack to keep them from sticking. I add water to cover the bottom of the pan, about 1 inch, cover with foil and bake about 40 minutes. They require no knife to cut, are so tasty you can't believe it. Plate these and prepare gravy to serve at the table, so everyone gets a choice. Not everyone likes gravy on their meat.

These were wonderful! I followed the advice of others and fried them till they were brown and crispy and then baked them for 35 minutes.  I heated the gravy on the stove and poored over the pork chops so those who didn't want gravy didn't have to have it.  I will definately make pork chops like this from now on!

This was a great, simple recipe!  My husband went on, and on!  I followed the recipe to a T when it came to ingredients, but I adjusted the cooking time.  I baked for 25 minutes the 1st time, and the poured "gravy" over, and cooked for another 20 minutes. This was plenty of time.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

These chops were extremely tender and moist. although I had reservations about the length of baking time, I made the recipe exactly as described. I did add quartered red steamer potatoes when adding the mushroom-wine sauce. An easy and excellent one-dish dinner.

Delicious-- my guests ate more than they had room for but none of us regretted it!  I think I will skip the breading of the chops next time to save on some fat and calories- I am not sure that I would miss the breading since it does not become crispy anyway in all that delicious sauce!

I liked the flavor, but not the texture.  It turns out very soggy and mushy, not sure how to get around this since the sauce is all cream of mushroom.  The breading soaks up sauce, but you need the breading to get a nice seal to hold in the juices.  Not sure I'll be making this one again, but the flavor and tenderness are nice.

I was excited to try this recipe and then ended up quite disappointed.  No one in my family liked it at all.  It had a very funny taste to the sauce and the breading ended up soggy.  Sorry!

These were the best pork chops that I have had in a long time and my family loved them!  I was afraid that the breaded chops would get soggy after cooking in the soup so long but they stayed crispy and the breading didn't come off at all. I didn't use the wine, I just added more milk as another reviewer suggested and it came out great. 
Really good with rice.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe. I made a roux out of extra virgin olive oil, flour, onion, celery, green/red bell pepper and garlic. I then added 
1/2 cup of sauvignon blanc and sauteed mushrooms. Turned out excelent!

Good recipe! Made a double recipe, so I increased the amount of the sauce based on other reviews. I used a few extra ingredients in the sauce...2 cans of cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery soup, few splashes of worcestshire sauce and browning sauce, a couple shakes of adobo seasoning and pepper, 1 cup of chicken broth instead of wine. Oh, and I sauteed  some canned mushrooms in the pan drippings and added them to the sauce, which I simmered while the chops baked for about 20. Only baked about an additional 40 mins. after covering with the sauce and my chops were very tender and tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

The only issue I had with this recipe was the directions. After the pork chops have been fried and placed into the oven, they should only be in there no more than 35-40. Otherwise, you'll have some dry pork chops when they oven goes off

TWO THUMBS UP! This dish is easy to make, and packs major flavor. I followed other reviewers tips, used the two soups golden mush and cream of mush, fresh sliced mushrooms and added a little extra wine.  It could not have been better!

This is a great starting point for a pork chop recipe. I added fresh garlic, used Cream of Onion instead of Mushroom, and added some curry powder(Just a dash). I'm going to carmelize some onion and see how that turns out in the sauce. (My youngest hates mushrooms)

This recipe makes fork-tender pork chops that are out of this world, however the gravy is lacking a bit.  I will make this again, but I will try a different gravy next time. Maybe take the advice of some of the reviews and add garlic and fresh mushrooms to the gravy.

I haven't even finished cookng and it's a disaster. After 3 minutes in the oil at med-hi heat, the outsides were burned and my kitchen was full of smoke, I hate to imagine leaving them for 2 more minutes. I seriously the hour and a half they will be i the oven will repair any of the damage but I'll see

This turned out really well.  The pork chops were very tender.  I used the South Texas Rib Eye Pork Chops which are from one end of the pork tenderloin.  The other end of the tenderloin is used for Center Cut Pork Chops.  I found the "Rib eye" cut to be juicier and more tender than the center cut pork chops.  They cooked a lot quicker than the recipe lead me to expect.  I used a meat thermometer so I'm not sure of the exact time but it was less than 30 minutes.   I let the pork chops come close to room temperature before cooking .  I breaded the chops as instructed in the recipe and browned them really well to a nice golden color.  Don't forget to heat the skillet first.   I didn't cover them with foil and rather than pouring the soup mixture over the chops, I poured the mixture around them.  This kept the crust crispy on the top of the chops.  You do need the 30 minutes of baking time after you add the soup mixture so that the gravy thickens.  Other than these few items, I followed the recipe as is.  I agree with the many who have suggested doubling the gravy/soup mixture.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and thought it was just good, not great.  Overall, just a little bland.  I will try it again, but will probably add some more garlic powder or use the cream of mushroom soup with garlic instead.  Chops were tender, the gravy was a tad on the runny side. UPDATE 7/2009:  I made this recipe again and tweaked just a few things.  My issue the first time was more with the gravy than the chops, so this time, I doubled the gravy (for mashed potatoes) and added 4 cloves roasted garlic, 2 T flour, 2 t salt, and some fresh ground pepper to it.  With these changes, this recipe is a solid 4*!  The pork was fork tender and the extra flavor really amped up the gravy.

I  have to say these were VERY good! I dont know what people are talking about when they said they were lacking flavor!? I followed others suggestions and cooked the sauce on the stovetop and then when serving poured the sauce over! This kept the outside of the chops crunchier. It was delicious. The pork chops were tender and so yummy. Me and my boyfriend rated this 5 stars, the only thing is we wish we would have made more sauce! Oh, we also used Cream Of Chkn since we dont care for mushrooms. Didnt taste a chickeny taste. Also I rubbed chops w/garlic powder and lawrys seas salt, and added ital seasonin, garlic powder, onion powder to the sauce and only baked chops for 35 mins! Definitely a keeper!

Both my husband and I really liked this...even our 3 1/2 year old son ate it all up!  I plan on making this next time we have guests over for dinner.  I followed the recipe word for word except for reducing baking time to 30/30 (I used boneless center cut chops, about 1/2" thick). Next time I will reduce browning time to no more than 3 min. per side. I also sautéed some fresh mushrooms and onions on the side and put them on top of the chops when they came out of the oven. This made for additional flavour, not to mention beautiful presentation. Thanks for the great recipe.

I loved this recipe! Total crowd pleaser! Great comfort food too! I only made a couple modifications. 1) I omitted the wine and simply doubled the other sauce ingredients. 
2) I used 2 tablespoons of freshly ground black pepper when seasoning the pork chops before the whole dredging process and changed the other seasoning amounts from teaspoons to tablespoons. 
My boyfriend's father has declared that these pork chops are his new favorite food! That is praise from Caesar!

I've tried this twice now and can't see what the hype is all about. I used 2" thick pork chops to make these and followed the recipe exactly. These were the drawbacks: 1) flavor is somewhat bland 2) breading is all soggy 3) pork chop is somewhat dry still. I've cooked breaded pork chops before and they are supposed to be crispy, otherwise why add the breadcrumbs?? I would agree with other reviewers and say that you MUST make the sauce separately and put the sauce on right before serving them. This is VERY important.

I made these for dinner last night and ALL the kids liked it!! Very rare for this family. I did notice however that the breading turned kind of soggy from baking in the sauce, next time I will prepare the sauce seperately and just pour over chops before serving.

Great recipe! I added about 3 cups of frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed to the bottom of the baking dish before adding the browned pork chops. I also doubled the amount of mushroom soup as some other reviewers suggested. Before pouring the soup over the pork chops I topped them with a sautéed onion. The soup baked into the potatoes and turned them into wonderful creamy scalloped potatoes. This recipe is a keeper!

Before making this recipe I read through all the negative reviews. I seasoned the egg with salt and pepper instead of seasoning the flour. I browned the pork chops thoroughly, I baked them at 400 degrees (my oven is quirky) for 20 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered so they wouldn't be soggy.  I didn't have plain cream of mushroom soup so I used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup. I added a can of mushrooms to the sauce (drained). Before adding the sauce I drained the fat from the bottom of the 9X13 pan.  I baked it an additional 25 minutes with the sauce covered. It wasn't mushy or fatty.  It was EXCELLENT!  My husband had seconds and told me I could make it again. It really pays to read others' opinions before trying a recipe.

These pork chops were wonderful, very tender, flavorful.  Make sure to brown the chops REALLY well before you bake them, otherwise when you add the wine sauce the breading is a little mushy.  I found that browning them more than I normally would brown chops does the trick.

This is an excellent recipe.  I agree with others that you must enjoy the taste of white wine, but it truly adds a great flavor.  I believe that I finally perfected this recipe last night, with some fabulous alterations:

1.Rather than seasoning the chops with seasoning salt, use Montreal Steak Seasoning.  
2.When making the gravy, begin by sauteeing some sliced portobello mushrooms, sliced green onions, & chopped Rosemary.  I sautee with a little olive oil, then finish it off with some white wine.  Then add this mixture to the gravy.
3.I also doubled the gravy for use over mashed potatoes.  
My husband and his friends were thrilled with this & begged me to make it every night on our upcoming ski trip.

I changed this recipe slightly as per some of the other reviews - I baked the pork chops initially for 35 minutes instead of 60, and then followed with the extra half-hour with the sauce mixture.  These pork chops were boneless and 1 1/2" thick and the shortened time worked fine.  Any more and they would have been dry.

I followed the instructions/ingredients exactly EXCEPT added sauteed onions, mushrooms, and garlic to the sauce. I thought it was great, my husband gave it a 4.

We loved this recipe. The pork was extremely tender, and savory. It was very easy to prepare, and I would definitely make it again.

I gave it a 4 because I would like the sauce to be well, a little more exotic, and or unusual. 

The cream of mushroom based sauce tastes very familiar, and ordinary. Do not get me wrong, the entree was delicious, but it was not out of the ordinary or unusual, which is probably more of what I am aiming for. 

Hope that made sense!

Delicious!! The only substitution I made was I used Old Bay instead of seasoned salt (didn't have any seasoned salt).  My whole family loved it! Will definitely make it again--but since we really prefer the boneless chops--that's what I'll use.

Of course, I can't leave a recipe alone, so I added onion powder to the flour with the other spices.  I also added some italian seasonings and fresh parm. cheese to the soup mix along with more garlic.  I would have added some heat, but I have small kiddos that haven't learned to enjoy that yet.

Cut cooking time down to 1 hour (1" thick boneless chops) and they turned out great.  Both my boys have asked for it again.  If BOTH of them like something, it must be a winner!!

ALWAYS a hit!  My husband considers it a treat every time i bake these.  They are spectacular.  It looks like an assembly line when i cook them, but it's well worth it!  Just be very careful while frying.  It's easy to overcook the breading!

These were good, but there was a bit too much of a wine flavor for my liking.  I'll make them again, but next time I think I'll cut down on the amount of wine the recipe calls for.  My fiance, however, loved them as-is!

Although this is a little more involved than I like to get (with the frying and taking it out during baking to add sauce), it's quite tasty!  I took the advice of others and cut the cooking time to 1/2 hour before the sauce and 1/2 hour after.  It's plenty.

These are, far and away, the very best pork chops I have ever eaten in my life. I adjusted the milk and wine ratio so that there was a bit more wine essence, and my husband always closes his eyes and savors the first bite. I serve this with homemade pasta and spoon the sauce over the noodles.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish a lot.  I doubled the milk/soup mixture and used as gravy for the mashed potatoes. My total cooking time was 1 hour, instead of 1-1/2 hours.  It was cooked perfect.

Very moist and tender pork chops smothered in a wonderful sauce with some kick (from the wine).  In order to keep them from getting soggy make sure cook each side until you have a nice golden brown crust!!!

When I read this recipe and the reviews (love the review aspect, always get good insights), I too thought the amount of time it cooked was excessive, especially for thinner or bone in chops. In years gone by, pork needed to be cooked a long time to avoid trichinosis but changes in how they are raised has eliminated this risk.
 
Here's how I changed the recipe: 
Used boneless 1.25 in thick chops. Added seasoning to chops, flour and seasoned bread crumbs along with some grated parm to BC. With the cheese added, brown on med or med low heat for 5 mn a side but watch to be sure they don't burn. 

Put in oven for 30 min. Take out of pan and out aside while you pile the pan with baby spinach. Use a high sided pan to be able to fit more spinach, it really cooks down. Put chops and any juices on top of spinach, spoon sauce over top of chops and around so spinach can cook into it. Bake for another 30 minutes. Result: Tender chops that cut with a fork, great sauce and spinach that lightened the sauce. Next time will add mushrooms in first 30 min so they roast and add even more flavor. Thanks for great starter recipe and all the suggestions!

We love this dish.  I usually serve it on weekends, because it does take a while to prepare, but worth it.  So very tender!  I serve on a bed of rice or mashed potatoes.  We have grown children and this is an often requested dish when they visit!

This was very delicious. I actually made this exactly how it said to. There was not one review who made it like your suppose to so I'm going to be that review.  Everything came out amazing with flavors. Only downfall is cut down the cooking time, my pork came out tough and alot of dishes with this recipe. Even after that this is definitely something I'll be making all the time.

We have made this tree times and using other chef's suggestions and some thoughts of our own, I think we have found our perfect combo.  Ingredient substitutions first: used salt and pepper instead of season salt.  add 1/2lb sliced baby portobello mushrooms.  Increased wine by 50%.  Preparation changes: mixed salt, pepper, and garlic powder into the dredging flour.  Used a little more oil in the frying pan for a more even brown (if done hot enough, the breading seals out excess oil).  Cooking changes: first bake without sauce for 30 min.  Cook the portobellos in the frying oil with a dash of salt, garlic, and parsely before adding to the dish. Then add portobellos, pour sauce on top, cover and bake an addl 15 min.  Perfection!  22 May 2015 - This is still one of our go-to dishes.  Our son LOVES it and asks for it more than just about any other meal.  We continue to tweak however.  Tonight, used 1lb sliced portobellos, 2 cans cr mush soup, 3/4 C milk, 1 C white wine.  Also, to get a nice brown on the chops in the fry stage, we used peanut oil (is more tolerant of high temps) and used enough to keep an even brown on both sides.  Don't worry about the excess...1) if hot enough, the chops will seal and not soak in the oil and 2) you want some left over to saute the mushrooms in.

Used ingredients as listed.  Browned well.  Cooked for 30, then 20.  I think any more would overcook the pork.  I'll definitely make again but will use some of the ideas from other reviewers.

My husband is not a fan of pork chops, therefore I do not make them very often.  I however like them so I decided to look for a new recipe in hopes that he would change his mind about the chops.  Well this is the one! He loved them!  The only change that I made was to use apple juice instead of white wine (didn't have any on hand).  For tonight's meal I made chicken, nothing fancy just some crock pot chicken.  My husband compared tonights meal with the chops that I made the other night.  He didn't care for tonights chicken but the pork chops from the other night "were the best thing that I ever made"! I was shocked, really??? He went from not liking pork chops to now having them as his new favorite thing.  So, in conclusion....make these chops! You will not be disappointed.  Thank you for the recipe and for adding one more meal to my dinner rotation!

This was really really good. Slight changes made were cream of mushroom to cream of potato, and doubling the ingredients for gravy. Also, not necessary to cook as long as  stated. Def a keeper.

Very possible that these are the best pork chops ever! I made the recipe as called for except I used panko bread crumbs. I thought the cooking time was way too long...but they were perfect! The sauce is awesome....I used Marsela cooking wine. I will be glad to make these to take anywhere.

We liked these but we do not bake with the gravy but rather just use it as a sauce at the end. This leaves the chops a little crispier which is what we preferred. The flavors of everything is good as is for us.

I followed the recipe except I only made 4 pork chops, and baked them for 35 min. I used golden mushroom soup and it was very good.

These are the best pork chops I've ever made! I only cooked them for an hour total and they came out great. I would recommend flipping the chops half way through baking (before adding the soup mixture) and then taking the foil off. 
Highly recommend.

This recipe was amazingly succulent! I made a homemade cream of mushroom soup because some in my household are sensitive to MSG, so I used half and half instead of milk and cut it to 1/4 cup since its a lot thinner than the canned version.  

I also cooked it for 20 minutes before the sauce and then 25 minutes after, the internal temperature of the chops were at 180 degrees so it was just right.  

The only thing I'll do differently next time is season the flour, the breaking was slightly bland but it was nonetheless delicious!  I'll definitely make this again!

Very yummy and relatively simple. I changed a few things after reading the other reviews...only baked the chops for 30 min (probably could have done less) before adding the sauce, doubled the sauce and added mushrooms. YUM!!

Wow!  This recipe made the tenderest pork chop I've ever eaten, and the gravy was magnificent!  My father-in-law has a hard time chewing most meats because of his dentures, said the texture was perfect. (Also, this was a very forgiving recipe as it came out delicious despite the fact that I burned the bread coating black by cooking the coated pork chop over medium high heat for 4 minutes, and after running short of time I baked it for 30 minutes instead of an hour for the first bake. It still came perfect, and was the best of three recipes for pork chops I tried.)

I took the advice of others and used golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom. I am not a fan of mushroom soup and the golden mushroom soup gave it more of a homemade taste to the gravy. I also sauteed 1/4 cup of minced onion, 12 oz of sliced mushrooms, 3 cloves minced garlic, added double the sauce ingredients and simmered for 15 minutes before pouring over the chops. It was really delicious! The chops however were a little over done in my opinion. Next time I will make my changes and cook try less cooking time. Overall though this is going to become a regular I'm sure! We enjoyed it with mashed potatoes, roasted green beans and hawaiian rolls! Wonderful Sunday meal!

I've made this several times and it is consistent, comes out great every time. I think I use a little more garlic powder and seasoned salt than is called for, although I don't actually measure. I sprinkle each piece individually with the shaker, applying a full coat to each piece. The specified length in the oven is for thick chops. If you have thin chops you will need to decrease the cooking time.   Serve with rice (jasmine or white) and put the gravy on top.  The kids love it.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm a sucker for wine sauces. I've been making baked pork cops for a while now, except without the breading, and the mushroom soup (minus the wine) poured over a heaping of stuffing on top of the pork. This has surpassed this. It involves a little extra work with the breading, but it really adds a lot of flavor. My changes were that I simply baked the chops for about 30 minutes covered, then 10 more minutes uncovered to try and crisp up that breading that got mushy! I cooked the mushroom sauce on the stove and served it on the table with the meal for individuals to add as much or as little as they want. (I added a lot! YUM!)

I skipped the browning and skipped the sauce and double breaded in italian bread crumbs. This per one review i read. Tasted too salty. I did the last three breading only once and cooking totally on stove top in butter. Those were yummy.

Delish!!!  Used some of the same advise as previous reviews.  I used boneless pork chops and be sure to get extra crisp on the outside.  Once the pork chops were in the oven, I used the same fry pan and saute about 1/4 cup chopped onion, then added the wine and then milk and then soup.   I also used about 1/4tsp black pepper in the gravy.  Be sure to double the gravy!!!  I only baked the chops for 40min total and it was perfect!!!  Served with homemade mashed potatoes!!

The whole family loved these!!! I changed a few things though, I baked them for 40 minutes, then another 20 minutes covered after I poored the gravy mixture onto them. For the gravy I first sauted onion and garlic, and used chicken broth instead of white wine. They were fall off the bone tender and could not have turned out any better!! Thanks for this awesome recipe, I will be making again and again :)

Wonderful! The kids (13 & 11) and hubby inhaled this! I used 4 butterflied, pork loin chops, and 2 of them were really wide, so this actually made 7 servings. The only change I'd make is to add some panko to the Italian bread crumbs. Thanks to Cindy in Pensacola for recommending!

I forgot to get back on and rate these pork chops!! However, I made them w/ no revisions to the recipe and I thought they were fine. They were moist and that was the most important thing to me b/c I always overcook my chops!! Well browning the chops is the key to making this work.

Say goodbye to dry, tough pork chops!  This recipe was less time-consuming than I thought and resulted in tasty, melt-in-your mouth chops that the whole family enjoyed.  I followed the recipe for the breading and gravy, but used 8 boneless pork chops instead of 6 bone-in chops.  There was more than enough sauce to cover the extra cuts of meat.  I don't always have white cooking wine on hand, but I think that chicken broth would be a great substitution.  Superb!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  Change:  After frying the pork chops I poured the sauce on them immediately, then placed them in the oven.  I didn't really see the need to bake them without the sauce.

Wow these were excellent! I used 4 almost 2 inch thick center cut chops, forgot the flour and they were still wonderful. Baking time is going to depend on how thick your pork is. I did pan sear them first, then used the drippings to sautee fresh garlic and half sweet onion then added a family sized can of cream mushroom soup, Chardonnay wine, and a couple splashes of soy sauce, no milk was used. The pork was sooooo tender it melted in your mouth...will be making these again.

This recipe was amazing! I have always managed to ruin pork chops when it came to cooking them unitl now! My husband and I loved it! We needed a little more olive oil though and left out the white wine. It was still incredible!

My parents could not stop raving about this recipe.  They said it was the best they've ever had.  Definitely making again...probably this week!

very tasty! I had 4 huge pork chops that I cut in half and pounded out. I used 1 cup of bread crumbs with 1/2 cup flour, added pepper, garlic powder, sage and oregano for seasoning. I sauted 8 oz of mushrooms in the pan drippings then made the gravy. I added 1 tbsp minced garlic to the gravy as well. Wish I had doubled the sauce it was so good! Thank you to Cindy from Pensacola for recommending this to me on the Buzz!

These were good. I didn't have quite an hour and a half, so I cooked the pork chops in the skillet on the stove. The pork chops turned out awesome. I mixed the flour and the (Italian) bread crumbs together, and I dipped them in egg twice. They were extremely tender, and the breading was yummy. I added some fresh mushrooms to the gravy mixture. I guess I'm not a huge fan of the cream of mushroom soup because I thought the gravy tasted a little.. processed. I think next time I will make the pork chops the same way, but I will make the gravy from scratch, Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is a keeper! I use it all the time with chicken instead of porkchops - sometimes i dont even bread the chicken - just brown it and let it cook in the mushroom sauce!

This meat dish added to a great family dinner.  The only change I made was to use Panko bread crumbs instead of the Potato Chips.  Everyone loved this!

I recommend this receipe it was very good.  I modified it and switch the amount of milk with the wine at 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup of milk, I also added capers and it was very good Italian flair to the dish. I would recommend putting it over rice. Makes a nice hearty meal for the family and something different and extremely easy to make.

Awesome! Only thing I changed was substituting the white wine with chicken broth. I didn't have any wine on hand. The kids loved it!

These are THE BEST chops I've ever made.  Mine used to turn out dry and hard chewing.  These are incredibly moist and fall apart just cutting them.  Excellent!

Made a half recipe, which worked well for two people with leftovers.

To make the sauce dairy-free, I de-glazed the pan used to fry the pork chops with the white wine, then substituted chicken stock for the milk and thickened with flour.

Also note that the thin cut pork chops I used only needed 35 minutes in the oven rather than the whole hour.

DELICIOUS!!!! My husband LOVED it- requested that it go into the rotation- and so did my 3 year old son. I did add mushrooms to the sauce, but that's the only change!

My family-as well as myself-absolutely loved this recipe. I did two small things different: 1. I substituted cream of celery for the cream of mushroom soup. 2. I used 1/4 cup of basalmic vinegar in lieu of the white wine (which changes the color quite a bit) It was my first time cooking it and it turned out wonderfully! Will have to make again due to all the requests I've received!

This was an incredible dish, I can't believe how delicious it was!! I didn't have any white wine, so I substituted in chicken broth - worked perfectly. Highly recommended to all levels of cooks!

I made it a bit different but without this amazing recipe i wouldn't even know where to begin. I like a crispier breading so i never poured the sauce on top and cooked. I cooked the pork chops by themselves. I made the sauce on the side. To add flavor i sauteed bacon bits, onions, mushrooms, and garlic. After they were at a point i liked them, i added a bit of the white wine, let it cook down, then added the remaining white, milk, and cream of mushroom along with a tablespoon of butter. I know i deviated quite a bit from the recipe but its probably the best dish i've ever made.

These were FABULOUS!!  I listened to other reviews and cooked only 30 without sauce, then 30 with the sauce.   Before I browned the chops, I added three garlic cloves to flavor the oil.  Then while the chops were baking, I cooked the soup, milk, and wine in the pan with small diced onions.  Great flavor!!!  KIDS ATE IT TOO!!  Served with mash potatoes.

Simple and delicious! Everyone in my house said that I could definitely make this one again! The only thing I did differently was used plain breadcrumbs and added the garlic powder, season salt and some dried dill weed to the breadcrumbs instead of seasoning the pork chops direct. It was terrific!

I did a few things after reading other reviews: I used 2 cans each golden mushroom and cream of mushroom with garlic soup(lots of extra sauce, but not a bad thing). I used more wine (chardonnay) than milk. I used panko breadcrumbs and seasoned with basil, oregano, garlic and onion powder, and s&p. I did not fry. Sprayed baking dish and baked 25 m on each side, added sauce and baked another 25-30 m and made sure to get sauce underneath chops using tongs so chops didn't stick too much. Served with mashed potatoes and poured extra sauce over all. BF LOVED it and had seconds. Easy- will make again!

this was the first time I made pork chops so I was a little nervous, but I followed everything as it was written and it turned out amazing! The only thing I added was some fresh sage, only because I have so much of it and I was just trying to use it up any way I could.  I chopped some leaves up and sprinkled it before I put the flour on.  I thought it added a nice gourmet feel (even though it was super easy to make)  I can't wait to make it again!

I made these the other night and they were lovely.  But I did change a few things.  I added the seasoning to the breadcrumbs and I cooked in the oven for about 40 minutes to begin with and then only another 15  once I put the sauce on.  They were fantastic!  Will definately be making again.

Fry and Bake as directed!  What is this 20/20 and 30/30 stuff?  The long cook time makes a yummy and tender dish!!! I used: Fresh breadcrumbs with fresh rosemary, thyme and sage. Plus homemade bourbon mushroom cream sauce instead of the can of mushroom soup.

I am not a huge pork chop fan but my boyfriend is so every once in a while I make what he likes as well even though im not so crazy about them. This was absolutely delicious! I changedthe white wine to chicken brother because I didn't have any white wine. Then I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom because I planned on putting mushrooms and onions in anyway and I had more chicken than mushroom in the pantry. I also used Lawry's as my seasoning salt like someone else said they did. For the bread crumbs, I used mancini's. Mancini's is a bread company in Pittsburgh that is the best! To top it all off....I heated the sauce up in the cast iron skillet which I just used to fry the pork chops, mushrooms and onions in. So Good! I recommend this to everyone!

I have tried many recipes from this site and I have always loved the recipes. I was so dissapointed with this recipe.  Especially with all the good comments. I used fresh bread crumbs which just turned to mush in the soup mixture. It tasted like a bowl of canned mushroom soup with soggy bread in it.  It was bland and I will not make this again.  It also took too much oil to fry the pork chops and it was not worth the extra fat content for the outcome of the recipe.

If i was simply rating the pork chops, i'd have given this recipe a definite 5, but the sauce needed a little work. I'll start off with the chops. I think the key to not having soggy chops is to use a very light amount of flour in the beginning as the recipe states. i also seared them in extremely hot oil for about 3-4 minutes per side until they were very, very crisp (but not totally burnt). After reading other reviews, i applied the sauce after they were in the oven for 30 minutes. i temp'd them and they were only at about 120 F, so i ended up having them in there for another half hour and they turned out perfect, not soggy, no crust falling off anywhere, just juicy and great tasting. I also must note that i was using 'thin' sliced pork chops. As for the sauce, i knew right away it would be bland with only the ingredients given. i sauteed a few slices of onion in some olive oil for a couple of minutes, then added 2 freshly minced garlic cloves and white wine(probably around 1/4 cup) and sauteed for another couple of minutes. i added this all to a family size can of cream of mushroom, along with a little (about another 1/4 cup) more wine and double the recommended amount of milk. i also added a good amount of salt and pepper(a must), and simmered for about five minutes before adding it to the pork chops. it's VERY important to keep tasting the soup before you throw it on the chops! everyone has different likes, so keep tasting! served over rice.

Everyone looooved this recipe!!! I did follow some other reviewers advice though. I used minced garlic instead of the powder. I sauted a bunch of fresh mushrooms and added them to the sauce. I also used 1 can cream of mushroom, and one can golden mushroom. I will not add the extra salt next time. It was so yummy. Definteley make again!!

Amazing!  I did not have any wine, so I doubled the milk to 1 full cup.  My husband LOVED this dish and had it for lunch the next day.  He wants me to make it again... TONIGHT!  Definitely the best pork chops we've ever had!

I've made this for the umpteenth time and always the best!  Just added a can of sliced drained mushrooms and onions this time.  Absolutely the best!  The only change I made was I had no wine so used apple juice.  Easy and even my picky grandkids loved it. Update - I've made these four times now and they are fool proof. Very good and pretty enough for a company dinner.

Delicious!  Cooked in oven for a total of 1 hour.  That was enough time.  Thanks for the great recipe!  It's a keeper!  (Served with SLOW COOKER GARLIC MASHED POTATOES and SARAH'S APPLESAUCE -both recipes are on this site.  Also served green bean/carrot medoly and a green romaine and craisin salad...Yummy!)

We just finished these pork chops for dinner and thought they were very good.  I made one mistake...pay attention to how long you are brown the pork chops. I didn't pay enough attention (I set a timer for 4 minutes) and it took less than 5 minutes for mine to brown up, so I ended up with one of side of them more golden black than brown.

I have been making this recipe for years, it's not a new one, but I will give you a new twist that I have tried and found better and with a few less calories. instead of dredging in flour or bread crumbs, just bake the pork chops in the oven with salt,pepper,and garlic powder. Then instead of the regular cream of mushroom soup, use the fairly recent Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic. Add one can of skim milk and fresh mushrooms, or add one can of asparagus cuts and tips. (Drained) Both are really great. One other thing, this is great served over Onion Rice. You can find that recipe here also.

My entire family loves this, even my husband, who normally doesn't like pork chops.  Friends always ask me to make it if I invite them over for dinner.

This tasted good, but I couldn't overcome the bland taste.  The wine and soup mixture was nice, I was happy with how they came together.  But in the end it only tasted like cream of mushroom soup over fried porkchops.

Delicious!  I don't recommend having the gravy on the side.  Pouring it on the meat and putting it back into the oven helps keep the meat tender and juicy.  Will definitely make again.

not exactly my cuppa tea after all.. but I must say I enjoyed it more the second day than the first. Too much wine flavor,not enough garlic, the sauce was too thin(for my own sake I should have thickened it but I didn't). I followed the recipe to the letter. Ah, well.. I'll keep looking :)

These pork chops would so tender and juicy, and full of flavor. I'm not a big mushroom fan so I used Cream of Celery soup in stead of Cream of Mushroom, and it was a hit!Plus I took another piece of advice and doubled the milk rather then using the white wine.  Hubby and kids all loved it!

This was a delicious and easy pork chop dish. I seasoned the chops before the breading, adding black pepper to the meat and a little grated parmesan to the bread crumbs. I also add about 1/2 tsp. oregano to the sauce and was heavy on the wine, light on the milk. It smelled so good and the flavor was that of "comfort food". My husband ate several chops and he usually only eats one and avoids seconds. That right there says this recipe is a keeper! Use a metal spatula to scoop out and serve the pork chops making sure the breading underneath comes up with the chop. These are wonderful with garlic mashed potatoes and a green salad.

My husband and I loved this recipe. After reading some other reviews I changed some things. Instead of milk I used sour cream for the sauce, to keep it thick. Then do add more flavor I doubled the wine. I t added more tang, and zip to the sauce. I also used a roasted garlic soup for more flavor.I also used fresh sauteed mushrooms. As mentioned in another review I seasoned the chops (thick, boneless) before breading. I also used a whole pack of French onion soup mixed with my bread crumbs. Lastly , I took a handful of salty peanuts, chopped them up in my food proceesor, and sprinkled on the top of the sauce halway through baking time, it added a nice texture to the dish. My husband and I eat thick, boneless pork chop around a medium temperature, so I cooked the chops only for an hour, they came out moist , but WEll done, next time I will only cook for 45 min. 25/20.

Have been making this for years and it is our favorite way to eat pork chops if we aren't grilling.  I just use milk instead of wine and it has always been terrific!

Ok...I feel like a heel giving 3 stars to what is apparently a fabulous recipe - for everyone else. For me, this was a lot of work for a so-so result. I used 1" chops, white wine and everything else exactly as stated in the recipe. The chops were just as tough as with other recipes! I was really hoping to achieve the tender results so many others have claimed to get from this method. They were juicy and the sauce was fine but nothing spectacular. I have noticed lately that a lot of the 5 star recipes I try are just not that good. Am I expecting too much?

These were such a big hit for our Sunday dinner. The beginning of the recipe is very much your standard way of making breaded pork chops. You season the meat, bread the chops in flour, egg, bread crumbs then fry it in a pan of olive oil. I think the reason a few people complained that the chops were not flavorful is because they didn’t season their meat enough before dipping it in the flour. If you really season it with seasoned-salt a lot, that flour locks in that flavor very well. The second part of the recipe is what makes these pork chops so good. After frying them you bake them in the oven for an hour. I thought this amount of time was a little excessive, but I went ahead and followed the recipe. These were the moistest pork chops I have ever had. The sauce is very easy too. Pop open a can of cream of mushroom soup, then add milk and wine. I actually ended up omitting the wine and added more milk (I didn’t have any wine on hand) and it still turned out plenty flavorful. I added about a teaspoon of thyme to my sauce and that complemented the mushrooms very well. I will be adding the wine the next time I make this because I think that will add an even richer flavor, but it tasted great without it too. I would like to try to make fried chicken or chicken fried steak this way (breading it, frying it, and then baking it). I’m sure it will turn out just as moist and yummy.

I have been making this recipe since I first discovered it over a year ago.  It continues to be a huge hit with hubby and I.  I have always made it with apple juice or white grape juice since I have a 1 yr old and I always have that available rather than white wine.  I think apple juice works THE BEST with these, gives them 100% more flavor as does sparkling juice.  :)  FYI if you plan on making mashed potatoes with this (i always do) you need to double the soup mixture to have enough.  You will love this recipe! A++ from someone who has made this at least 20 times.

Excellent, easy recipe.  I made this tonight while doing a million other things.  I also opened my cupboard, only to discover that I have no breadcrumbs.

Fellow review-readers: don't worry about no breadcrumbs (you solve the sogginess issue immediately).  I threw the seasoned salt & garlic powder into the flour and dredged it...then dipped it in egg...then dredged again in the flour mixture.  Perfect! the coating didn't come off! And didn't become soggy.

I agree with the extra frying time, prior to baking the chops.  Maybe this helps. 

It is one of the easiest recipes I've ever made.

Cannot figure out how this got such good reviews??? We ended up throwing this out and I really don't believe it was my cooking this time. :)  The flavor was only ok and the breading all turned to mush. Much better can be done with some pork chops...

This was the first recipe in which I've tried baking chops, so was in admittedly unfamiliar territory. I was disappointed in the cooking method...the oven time (which I even reduced by 1/2 hour) left my thick chops very tough, and the sauce poured over for the last portion of cooking sogged up the crust pretty badly. I'm sure that some tweaking would have better results, but the overall flavor doesn't have me motivated to bother. Just not to my taste, I guess.

The first time I made the recipe, I didn't have much luck.  The breading stuck to the pan rather than the meat and the chops were tough.  I decided to try it again with several modificaitons.  The chops I had this time were very thin so I seasoned them and browned them in olive oil only about two minutes each side just to give it some color.  I then transferred them to a baking pan.  Mixed the creamed soup with a whole can of milk and some sliced fresh mushrooms and poured it over the chops.  I didn't have wine on hand  I then melted a good tablespoon of butter and mixed enough seasoned bread crumbs into it to absorb the butter then spread the crumbs over the chops.  I baked them uncovered at 375 for about half an hour until it was bubbly and the topping was golden brown.  Each chop had all its toppings.  There was plenty of sauce for the mashed potatoes and dinner was on the table in 40 minutes.  Yummy!

I knew this recipe would be good.  Over 900 reviewers can't be wrong.  This was a very easy and delicious way to prepare pork chops.  The chops were very tender and very savory.  I added 1/2 cup of sour cream to the sauce mixture along with fresh cracked black pepper and the juice of 1/4 fresh lemon.  Next time I'll make extra sauce. We served it over rice on the side and it was creamy and full of flavor. This recipe is versatile so you could easily add your favorite herbs or spices.  This one goes into my recipe box at home!

I have poured mushroom soup over pork chops before, but this is soooo much better! I used plain bread crumbs and added a half teaspoon of Italian herbs. I didn't have any white wine and it was wonderful anyway. Very tender and a good taste. I think it would be nice for company especially if you used well trimmed boneless pork cutlets. I am also going to try it with chicken breasts. Thanks!

Tasty recipe.  I increased a bit.  I used 8 chops and an extra can of soup (golden mushroom), 1/2 cup wine and sauteed some onions before adding the soups.  A little salty, I probably used too much season salt.  I gave it a 4 because the kids gave it a 3 and my husband gave it a 5.

Great recipe!!!  I skipped the flour...just dipped the chops in egg and then Italian style bread crumbs.  Seasoned with Lawry's and Pepper...also sauteed some fresh mushrooms, onions, and garlic.  I also poured everything in together and baked for 1 hour.  Came out very tender!!!  Thanks for a great Chop recipe!!!

These were EXCELLENT!  Even my kids enjoyed them because the meat was so tender.  I sauteed 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms in 1 T. of butter and added them to the soup mixture.  YUM!

This recipe made the pork chops incredibly moist and tender.  I did not use the mushroom sauce, instead, I followed the rest of the recipe and instead of the italian bread crumbs I rolled my chops in crused ritz crackers.  I followed the recipe just as stated but only baked the chops for one hour since I did not use the mushroom sauce.  WOW!  The pork chops were excellent!

Very tender chops!  So tender that they fell apart and were a little hard to find between the sauce and the breading that came off.  I think I will skip the breading next time for that reason and to save time.  Since I had a family pack of chops, I used 3 cans of soup and 2 cups of milk.  I substituted 2/3 cup of sour cream in place of the white wine and served with egg noodles.

This recipe was good, however maybe a bit too bland for me.  Except for a slight wine taste and the breading on the chops, it basically tastes very similiar to the generic "baked pork chop in cream of mushroom soup" recipes.  

I used herbed stuffing mix which I "ground up" in my food processor and added some dry italian spices to them because I didn't have bread crumbs on hand.  I decreased the bake time based on recommendations.  I also added a can of sliced mushrooms.

I don't think I will be using this recipe again, but I will be using stuffing mix for bread crumbs in the future, to me, that was the best part.

The flavor was wonderful, but the breading was too overpowering. Next time I will make double the sauce with more white wine and leave off the breading.Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I used 4 pork chops with the bone in and doubled the sauce. I was a little skeptical of the coating after reading the reviews, so I used coating on two of the pork chops and the other two I just seasoned and floured them. Both turned out really well. The sauce seemed a little rich to me (my boyfriend LOVED it). I think maybe adding a little water to it may help next time. Overall, great recipe!

This recipe was WONDERFUL!!!!

I was a little wary about cooking for the whole hour and a half, but I am glad that I did, the chops came out soooo tender!  My husband usually doesn't care for pork chops because they get so tough but he came back for seconds and even thirds.  Next time I make this I will double the sauce ingredents.

Excellent recipe!! I used boneless chops, so time was 30/30. I had no wine so I added rum! Don't knock it if you haven't tried it, yippee!! I also added minced garlic to the sauce, This is a keeper.

I too love this recipe -- the first time I made it for hubby and girlfriend, it was a hit.  Be careful with the baking time though if your pork chops are not especially thick.  The first time my chops were center cut boneless and very very thick -- I followed the recipe and they were extremely moist.  The second time, my chops were a little thiner so following the recipe bake time caused them to be a little dry -- I should have probably taken them out 10 minutes earlier.  But otherwise, an excellent dish!!!

LOVED these!!!  I served some noodle/dumplings with them and they were terrific, even my 16 month old twins ate some of them!  I will save this and make it again on a cool evening this fall.

These turned out pretty good but the baking time is way off. My  pork chops were 1" thick and I browned them in evoo, placed in the oven and baked for 20 minutes. I then poured the soup mixture over the chops, covered them and baked for another 20 minutes. Had I followed the time on the recipe the chops would have been over baked and dry. Update: made them again. This time I poured the soup mixture over the browned pork chops and baked, covered for 20 minutes. Removed cover and baked an additional 15 minutes. Cooked to perfection.

Given the simplicity of the preparation, the flavor was good. I baked them for about 20 minutes and they still came out VERY, VERY overcooked.  Would like to give it another try.

I followed the recipe to a "T", and my chops burned during the first hour of baking.  My oven has been calibrated, so I can't blame the oven.  The concept is good, but the timing is lousy.

I make this frequently.  It is one of my husbands favorite meals.  The only change I make is to replace the white wine with chicken broth because we don't drink white wine.  My pork chops are so tender they can be cut with a fork.

I've been making this delicious recipe for years.  Since my husband and I are onion lovers, I incorporate sliced sweet onions with this recipe.  As suggested by others, I use less milk and more white wine.  I also add some oregano to the Italian breadcrumb mixture and sometimes serve this over pasta, or even mashed potatoes.  It's a nice change.

These turned out very tender and did not dry out at all.  I need to remember to season them a little heavier than what I am inclined to when it says "season to taste".

Incredible. I've made this at least 10 times in the last 2 years and I've yet to have anything said other than "this is delicious." I've served my parents, friends, my two young kids even love it.  I use pork blade steaks and make my own cream of mushroom, but that's just me. My husband detests regular "dry" pork chops, but this recipe completely fixes that...the wine is a bonus boost of flavor, but if you don't have it, it's still fantastic.

Lots of flavor! I will make this again.
I used thick pork loin chops because that's what I had on hand. I cut the garlic powder and season salt in half. I deglazed the fry pan with the white wine then added the soup and milk and brought to a low simmer. OMG! What amazing flavor. I did use the combo can of cream of chicken & mushroom instead of cream of mushroom because the flavor is not as intense. I reduced the cook time to 30/30 and it was perfect. Tender and flavorful.

Feel I can give this recipe five stars as I only made one change and that was to use the golden mushroom soup with less salt.  As for some of the reviews that mentioned too many dishes...I put the seasonings in with the flour, dipped each chop and set it on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet to dry a bit...not at all too time consuming.  One of the first times I've made chops that weren't dry...we're all happy!  Thanks!  It's in our recipe box in a VERY limited category called pork chops!!!

I had my doubts about this recipe but I'm glad I was wrong! I had thick pork chops and wasn't sure if it was going to cook evenly in the oven, but they came out juicy and tender. I did not have white wine on hand so I created my own gravy to go on top...so I can't speak for the sauce the original recipe calls for.

My family loved it. Everyone now wants me to make it for the holidays.  The chops came out so tender.  The only thing I did change in the recipe is I sauteed some fresh mushrooms in butter to  cook until all the juice from mushrooms was evaporated and then I added the soup, milk and wine in the hot skillet to warm it a bit. Then I put it on top of the chops.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe but used thinner, boneless pork chops.  I fried them for 5 min. each side but only cooked for 35 more minutes and they were so tender!

These pork chops are scrumptious! I did everything as instructed; during prep, I added a bit of cayenne pepper to give them a bit of a kick. As suggested by others, I cut the oven time to 35 minutes, needless to say,  they were moist and perfect! I opted to forgo the soup mixture because I didn't have some of the ingredients at home but still wanted to give them a shot. I was extremely happy with the result (and so were my two teenage boys, husband, and two year-old picky eater!) thanks!!!

I don't have much luck with cooking pork chops. Sometimes even when they are tender they are still dry, or tough and dry and I never know about the cooking time. If I can avoid it I dont use a meat thermometer because I am afraid I will release the natural juices. I followed this recipe exactly, even the cooking time that really concerned me because of my experience and the reviews. I used center cut bone in pork chops and they were cooked so perfectly I would have to call them the Fillet Mignon of pork chops. That is why I'm giving this recipe 5 stars. I did not like the breading soft, so for the sauce, I am going to try to simmer it seperate and use it as a poor over next time I make this. I hope that works. Thanks for a great pork recipe!

I followed what others said and I cooked the pork chops 35 mins and then added the sauce cooked for 30 more mins. I also added mushrooms to the pork chops while they cooked :) wow yummy!!

I tried this recipe but I lessened the baking time to 40min.and fried the pork a bit longer to ensure crispness on the coating.Also,to avoid mushiness I prepared the sauce on stovetop instead of pouring over the meat,adding sauce after baking.I also used different things in the sauce,included fresh mushrooms and a small shallot. Along with only partial mushroom soup,mixed with also chicken soup,and real wine,not cooking wine.I think it cut down on the overwhelming mushroom flavor and balances it out well.It also kept the meat well crunchy outside yet moist inside. With my attempt at the longer cooking time,its just too long,and made them dry.It should be fine to shorten cooking time and still be plenty safe to eat,use a thermometer,Americans tend to cook pork too long out of fear,but its fine for less time in oven. This is a nice simple and easy to make recipe with items that most folks have already.

These pork chops are seriously amazing.  I've made them many times and they are always delicious.  I usually don't cook them as long as they call for because I'm always running late cooking supper.   About 30 minutes to start with and then another 30 minutes with the gravy.  They are also perfectly fine with just doubling the milk if you have no wine.  I do think the key is frying them brown and really crispy to start with so the breading only softens and doesn't get soggy.  Everyone in my family LOVES these.  They aren't exactly the most healthy (especially since they are best with buttery white rice!), but so so good.

I don't understand how people can change this recipe and then give it a less than 5 star rating!  Don't mess with it.  Its perfect.  The chops will be fork tender if you let them cook the entire time.  The wine, milk, and soup have just the right amount of flavor.

Good recipe, wrong cooking lengths.  Pork chops dry out when overcooked, even if they are sitting in sauce.  I made my own cream of mushroom soup base and added a can of golden mushroom soup, plus I doubled the wine.  I would repeat, but the cooking time is about half or less in every instance.

These pork chops were delicious and tender!!!  I used the center cut with bone in pork chops.  I like a little bit of fat to my chop for flavor.  I also used Campbell's roasted garlic cream of mushroom sauce for an additional kick because the store was out of the golden mushroom soup.  I cut the cooking time in half because I felt like the chops would dry out if I cooked them too long.  This whole thing came out PERFECT!  I'll definitely be saving this in the recipe box and plan on having friends over when I make it again.

This is a great recipe.  It's become a favorite in our house.  I usually skip the eggs and flour and just season the pork chops with garlic salt, bread them, then put them in the pan.  The breading still stays on the meat.  I only bake for about 25 minutes and they always come out tender and delicious.  This has become my main pork chop recipe.  Thank you!

This was WONDERFUL!! Both my picky eaters loved this dish. I followed the recipe as is, except I only baked it for 45minutes and the pork was done to perfection! I heated the sauce in a pan so it was hot when I poured it n the pan. I used Marsala wine in the sauce and it delicious!! DO brown the coating well as it stays on perfectly when done that way.

Some of the best pork chops I've ever had. I used boneless pork chops which can sometimes be a little dry. These came out perfectly, very moist. I cut back on the cooking time 20/30 and they were great.

I thought these pork chops were DELICIOUS!! I felt like it was a little time consuming, but well worth the time. I did substitute more  milk instead of white wine (b/c I didn't have any). I baked the pork chops for 35 min & then added the soup/milk mix & baked another 15 or 20 min. I thought the flavor was great & very moist. I will definitely make them again!

The best pork chops I have ever eaten.  I did double the gravy part just because my family likes lots of gravy.  I served with egg noodles.  I will make this often.... The pork chops cut with a fork!  AMAZING!

This is a great comfort food recipe.  I usually make a little extra sauce to put over mashed potatoes.  My husband craves this dish, and guests can't get enough either.

this is a delicious, east to make meal .. most of the ingrediants you probably already have, and it's DELICIOUS. I followed the recipe, but this is what I did - I used Panko bread crumbs, with a few dashes of italian seasoning. I browned them really well, and cooked them for 35min. I made the sauce seperately ontop of the stove, and DID NOT cook the sauce w/ the chops.. I used 2 cans soup - 1 can regular cream of mushroom, the other can wild mushroom. I sauteed some freshly chopped cremini shrooms in the frying pan with half of a onion, and added it to the soup with 1/2C. Ice Wine, and 1C. milk ... made with garlic mashed potatoes, and peas. everyone at the table **raved** about this dish, I am going to put it on my regular 'to-make' list :))

I liked this. The pork was very tender and the flavors all blended nicely. It also made a little gravy which always makes it easier to make a complete meal. The only thing I changed was using 1 cup of bread crumbs instead of 2 cups and I still had a little left and they were plenty dredged. I also made a homemade Italian season blend to mix in the bread crumbs so they weren't too salty from the store bought seasoned version. As someone said this will dirty a lot of dishes. So, I kept up on them while making it and it didn't seem like a huge problem. I served this with seasoned mashed potatoes and peas. It must have been pretty good, because I didn't get any of the leftovers.

These are killer delicious.  I made a half recipe with three pork chops. 

Forget the mushroom soup in a can. Ick. 

Saute some mushrooms with a few chopped onions, wee bit of butter and olive oyl. 
Add chicken stock...about a cup or so. 
Cook mushrooms and stock down a bit. 

Pull out a half cup of soup, let cool slightly.
Mix with half cup of half and half. 
Add it back in and cook it down a wee bit on low temp. 

Add all that, plus the extra milk and white wine in the recipe. 

This is traditional and delicious and relatively easy to make.

These are some of the best tasting pork chops I have ever made.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but also added a packet of pork gravy into the milk and soup mixture.  It turned out amazing!  Thanks for the recipe, I will make it again for sure.

I thought this was alright, but a little greasy. Also, it was kind of lacking flavor, even after I doubled the spices.

WOW. FANTASTIC. I did make a few modifications: I used 4 thick boneless chops. I fried the chops per the recipe and cooked in the oven for 45min. For the gravy I sauted half an onion and a tsp of minced garlic in the same pan that I fried the chops. I then added the wine, milk and I used cream of chicken soup. Simmered until bubbly. Added to the chops and baked another 20min uncovered. They are AMAZING.

Fantastic! Browning, and Bake time were both shorter.  3 min each side browing (I had thinner chops, and got the oil reall hot). 45 min bake time, then 30 min with the soup mix.  I doubled the cream of mushroom soup, for more gravy, and added sauted mushrooms.  Sides: mashed potatoes, green beans/sauted mushrooms/bacon.  Hubby didn't utter a word the whole meal - meaning he had his mouth full, gave me 2 thumbs up, and muttered "repeat for sure!

I baked for 35 minutes and warmed the sauce in a pot on the stove rather than pouring it over the chops. I also used cream of chicken rather than mushroom and doubled the milk rather than using wine.

PERFECT! I was looking for a pork chop recipe and saw thins had so many reviews, I ought to try it. It came out perfect. 

The pork shops i used were about 1/2 - 3/4 of an inch think so cooking time was cut in half. The chops cooked in the pan for maybe 2 minutes each side, then baked for 25 mins, added the sauce then another 15 min and it was ready to serve. 

Also, I used campbells cream of mushroom and roasted garlec soup...

Another tip - replace the white wine with marsala wine, add in a can of mushrooms along with onions, and you have a perfect marsala recipe!!! :)

My husband turned up his nose when I bought pork chops, and wound up raving over how wonderful this recipe was.  I omitted the flour and just dredged in egg then bread crumbs.  After skillet browning, I only baked 30 minutes (the recipe calling for 1 hour is as others have noted, WAY too long).  While baking, I combined the soup, milk and wine in a saucepan and warmed it.  At the end of 30 minutes baking, I poured the sauce over the chops, recovered with foil and returned to the oven for 20-30 more minutes.  Very tender and moist and a big hit with teenage son and husband.  Served with German Potato Pancakes, also on this site.

Can my husband tell me any more times how much he liked this? :)  I used boneless center cut pork chops b/c that is what I had and was worried that they would dry out.  I only cooked it for about 40 minutes and they were great.  I think it will be even better with bone in as I have a similar family recipe to this one.  Followed the recipe as written.  Now in my Recipe box, thank you

I usually don't review recipes but these pork chops were wonderful!  I didn't change a thing except to leave the soup part off.  I don't care for gravy.  Other than that this recipe was perfect.  If you don't put the gravy/soup on it takes about 45 minutes to bake at 450 degrees after you have browned them for 5 minutes on both sides. As I said these pork chops were perfect.

WOW.  Pork chops that I cooked that came out good.  Wow.  :D  These were good, tender AND BOTH kids ate them!  Wow.  Because of the wine, I served the gravy separately.  It was okay.  I think less milk - or no milk - may improve it.  Barely noticed the wine taste & too thin, not even "cream of" soup thickness.  Okay, I just came acrossed a review from the first time I made these (didn't remember it at all!).  I wrote the sauce was good.  Subtle tasting.  Different wine.  Good wine, good sauce.  I wrote 1/4c oil is the right amount for a twelve inch pan.  I also refrigerated them overnight to help the coating adhere better.  Apparently, or I guess ;D, I used full fat soup because I didn't mention thinness.  I used lowfat & it really was thin. 8/13 Rarely do I use seasoned salt so I don't buy it.  Here's my recipe.  It makes just a little over a teaspoon that's called for in this recipe. I go ahead & use all of it.  3/8t (1/4 + 1/8t) salt, 1/4t garlic powder & paprika, 1/8t black pepper & onion powder. Kids didn't like as well, but I did put the sauce on & bake half hour. I also put a small "glug" of white wine in the sauce, Wine amount was probably as stated or close.  'Stayed thick.  This definately isn't a "fast & easy" recipe, but if ya have the time - & don't mind waiting & having the house get heated up - it's worth it.

Very good. Could use more seasoning though...I also used cream of CHICKEN instead of mushroom as my family preferred it...Chops were moist and tasty...will make again...there were NO leftovers.
UPDATE: made this again on Friday and seasoned with lawry's seasoned salt and used fresh cracked pepper. 5 star recipe now...so moist!

Excellent recipe, but I added a little to it that I think made it even better. Before  breading, I butterflied the porkchops and stuffed with cornbread stuffing (instant). Also, after frying for about 5-7 minutes per side over medium-high heat, I only baked for about 30 minutes. Awesommme

This is our go to recipe for baking pork chops. My family hates cream of mushroom soup but they couldn't tell. They always love this recipe when I make it. I serve it over rice. Make sure to fry them until they are extra crispy. I used panko crumbs mixed with italian breadcrumbs for  crunchier texture. I added a little cornstarch to the sauce to thicken the gravy. The pork chops come out semi crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I also changed the initial cooking time to 40 mins. Don't forget to salt and pepper to taste after you plate them.

These were yummy...I made very few changes.  I used Cream of Onion instead of cream of mushroom, I use lots of cream of mushroom and wanted a change.  I added mushrooms and a diced onion!  I used chicken broth instead of milk cause sadly enough I was out of milk!  I sauteed the onions and mushrooms in a bit of butter for a few minutes, then added the soup, wine and broth.  They were very moist!

I generally followed the reviews from HOLLY9000 and PRINCESS20NY, and was pleased with the result.  Didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so used cream of chicken instead.  Added a can of mushroom pieces, some sour cream and extra wine to the sauce.  My husband really liked it!

Simple & quick & delicious - watch the oven time though so you don't overcook your chops. Meat thermometers are perfect to help assess cook time if you have one.

I absolutely loved this recipe, though the cook times were a bit off (even for altitude) and my family didn't want to touch the gravy.  I substituted panko bread crumbs and added italian seasonings into it, but overall, it was a great foundation recipe to build on.    Thanks!

I made this last night and it was a huge hit with my husband and 2 boys!  I used whole wheat bread crumbs that I forgot to season with Italian seasoning, but that didn't seem to be a big deal.  I did double the sauce using what was written, only instead of doubling cream of mushroom, my "double" part was a can of golden mushroom.  Otherwise, followed it to a "T" and served it with egg noodles.  Everyone raved and this one went into my recipe box.  Excellent!!

This was so good! I used 4 porkchops. I liked that I had all the ingredients in the cupboard already. After I fried the chops on each side and put them in the baking dish, I poured the white wine and soup into the hot pan with the drippings and scraped the "crumblies" together. I then put it all into a bowl with the milk where it sat until it was time to pour onto the chops. This made the gravy oh so good! My family loved this recipe!

The pork chops were delicious!  I cooked them for my parents and since neither of them like "white sauce" I substituted one can of golden mushroom soup and some red cooking wine instead of the mushroom soup and white wine.  It still turned out fabulous and served it over egg noodles with some steamed broccoli on the side.

This review is actually for the modified recipe which adds a couple cloves of garlic, a can of golden mushroom soup and cayenne pepper.  I deleted one star only because I used additions to this dish which turned out really tasty!  I generally don't make pork chops since it tends to be a bit dry and not so tasty but the modified recipe is so good I will definitely make this one again!  The wine makes this dish like eating in a good restaurant, yummy!

Maybe it's me...I cut the recipe down to 3 chops. Pan seared them in evoo and made all of the sauce. Cut the cooking time down to 25mins then 20. They were still kind of tough and thoroughly cooked. Good thing I read the reviews and didn't cook for the whole time. These were beautiful thick center cut chops...wish I could find a "perfect no-fail recipe for them!"

This is a very yummy dish and perfect for winter or when you just need some comfort food. I did as others suggested, replacing wine with chicken broth, only because I was out of wine; however I did splash a little beer in the gravy.  ;-)  I sauteed onions and garlic as well and placed it in the casserole dish to cook with the chops.   Served it over egg noddles, which went well with the gravy.  Delish!

I was feeling lazy so I browned the chops in my cast iron frying pan and then put the cast iron pan into the oven with the foil over top - BIG MISTAKE. The pan got way too hot and the sauce dried out. The pork chops still tasted great though. I am making them again but following the directions exactly, using a baking dish. Great meal for a wintery night!

I made this with 3 pork chops -just me and my husband here. Kept the sauce and the seasonings (except omitting the white wine) the same as if I had baked 6 chops. Turned out delicious! Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make it again.

This is a really different flavor, I wasn't too crazy about the wine flavor so I think next time I will deglaze the pan with the wine so it cooks down a bit and is not so significant.  My BF really loved these.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing! Followed recipe, but added sliced mushrooms to the pan once I removed the chops. I also added the sauce to the pan and simmered for a little, then poured over the chops and put back in the over. I only had to cook it for 20 mins, then 15 more mins. Will make again really soon!!

This recipe is very good!  I really liked that it called for seasoning the pork chops before putting flour on them, thereby sealing in those good seasonings.  Nice little trick.  However, I didn't give it 5 stars because the wine was a little too strong.  Another review recommended deglazing the pan with the wine, and I would likewise recommend doing so.  This way the wine reduces giving you that depth to your sauce, without the bite of the alcohol.  It was just a tad overpowering instead of enhancing.  I served mine with brown rice with chicken stock.  Will make this again for sure!

Best pork chops I ever had and the hubby agrees! The flavor is amazing and it was so tender we were able to cut it with only our forks. This will be a regular dish in my meal rotation. Amazing!

The flavor is great! But the crust does get soggy on the bottom after baking and fell off the meat before I could get it on the plate. For the gravy I deglazed the pan I used for the pork chops with the wine and then added the milk & cream of mushroom.

OMG!...by farrrrrrrr, the best diner i have made here at allrecipes.com!!!....and the most tenderest porkchops i have everrrrr cooked!...ever!...only a couple of things i changed....  1) after frying the pork chops and putting them in the oven, i fried one onion and a jar of sliced mushrooms in the drippings...  2) cooked chops for 30 min...than spread the onions and mushrooms over the chops...covered again, and cooked 15 more minutes...  3) did not use wine...instead substituted with milk...like a few other reviews...and did indeed use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup...poured over chops and sprinkled with parsley  4) cooked an additional 30 min...

This recipe tasted great and was easy to make. I had 9 boneless pork chops. I used Italian breadcrumbs and had some crumbs left over from herb stuffing.  Mixed these together.  I added the seasoning to the flour, this was much easier.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of golden mushroom soup.  About 3/4 cup milk and 1/3 cup of chicken broth (I had no white wine)  My husband and son raved about this.  I am usually pretty honest about what I make but I do have to say that the gravy from the mushroom soups made this (I believe it was the golden mushroom soup that gave this recipe what it needed)  I will definately make again but next time I will try it with chicken

Overall they had a good flavor.  I liked the sauce and added a pince of onion powder to it.  The next time I make it, I will buy thin cut pork chops and sautee them and skip the baking.  They I would serve with the sauce over top.

I thought these were alright not amazing. I found the taste of the wine too overpowering without the taste of anything else being evident. I did do the regular mushroom soup and the golden mushroom as advised in other reviews and it still was not great. Not bad, just not 5 stars.

Uh...PHENOMENAL!!! Oh my...like mana from heaven. My wife and I have been trying to find a new recipe for pork chops and this one blew us away. It's not that it's difficult or extremely different from many other recipes I've seen, but the little subtleties of this recipe make the difference. Make sure you have extremely high heat on your oil so you can adequately brown the pork. The better you brown, the more tender it will be. Baking the pork in the soup mixture instead of just pouring the mixture on before you serve is important. Adds a whole world of flavor to the pork breading. My changes for future cookings are to use panko bread crumbs for a crispier crust. Use vermouth for the wine as suggested by others. Saute 1/2 C mushrooms in the same skillet you used for the pork, and add to the soup before baking.   This recipe makes such tender pork chops. Permanent in the "family" recipe book now!

Me and my family just got done eating this for dinner, and my husband who is not a fan of wine in cooking loved these. And my 3 year old kept asking for more! I went exactly like the recipie said, execept I doubled the sauce and I am glad I did. I feel a little more confident about cooking with wine! Thank-you so much!

Pork chops were tender, but lacked flavor. I kept the gravy off the chops and baked for 40 min. Served the gravy on the side and added fresh mushroom.  Overall though it was a nice family meal.

Better than Mom's! I used boneless loins, added a couple of dashes of cayenne and extra garlic to the rub. I also browned them well in the pan, baked 30 min and 30 more min with gravy.   This one is going into the monthly rotation!

Excellent recipe.  I like to use butter cracker crumbs in place of bread, and I added sour cream in place of the milk.  Not that I think it made it that much better, but it's what I had on hand. I fried the chops til they were very crispy on the outisde and baked them 20 minutes first, then 20 minutes with the sauce.  They were quite thick and I thought it enough time to make them very tasty and tender.  Thank you!

Excellent recipe. Definitely some of the best pork chops I've ever prepared.  A few changes I did: I definitely didn't need all the baking time, about 35 minutes for just the chops, 15 minutes extra with the sauce.  I seasoned the chops with a salt-free garlic and herb seasoning before dredging.  I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom because I don't care for mushroom.  I blended the milk/wine/soup mixture with an electric mixer to make it really smooth, and added a clove of freshly minced garlic.  Next time I will get low sodium chicken broth because the gravy was a bit too salty for my tastes.  Can't wait to make this for my husband or for guests!

We get together with our "Card Playing" friends once a week and dinner is the prelude to the cards. Our friend is a highly successful former restaurant owner so I am always searching for "something to WOW them".  These pork chops did it!!! My hubby is constantly saying "stick to the tried and true things that I love" and once again, this recipe for these chops has won him over as well.  The only thing I did differently was (no white wine in the house) so I doubled the milk.  I cut down on the baking time; baking 30 minutes then adding the mushroom/milk sauce and baking the additonal 30 minutes. These pork chops were moist, and OH SO YUMMY!  Will certainly be making them lots more in the future.

What a wonderful recipe.  I also sauteed the onion before adding the soup.  I baked it initially for 40 min.  Great flavor.  The sauce was perfect for the brown rice side dish that I made.

I had some pork chops in the fridge that I had NO idea what I would do with them. I was tired of the old ketchup-on-top that I had grown up with, so I went looking for an easy recipe that I had all the ingredients for already. I will never make pork chops any other way! This is AMAZING! Tender pork chops, and the breading adds great flavor! I passed this recipe on to my mother, and once she made it for my father, he always asks for it!

This is deffenitly a keeper. I did make a couple of changes, however. I baked for 35 minutes and warmed the sauce in a pot on the stove rather than pouring it over the chops. I also used cream of chicken rather than mushroom, since we're not mushroom fans and doubled the milk rather than using wine.  You also have to be careful not to burn the chops while they are on the stove. Keep the heat low and be mindful not to burn them. It turned out fabulous.

These pork chops were absolutely incredible! I made them exactly as the recipe was written except I cut back on the cooking time like everyone suggested. I cooked them 30 minutes alone and then 30 minutes with the sauce. They were SO good. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was so good tonight. I used only 5 chops, but I wish I had used more because I want seconds and I have to leave the 5th one for my husband. I rubbed both sides of each chop with minced garlic, seasoning salt, and black pepper. I did not use flour because I forgot it, and I don't think it needs it. I forgot to make bread crumbs last night, so I used about half a bag of Stove Top and it worked very well. I'm not sure 2 eggs was necessary, as I had quite a bit left over. Next time I'll use one egg at a time. I cooked the chops for 5 minutes on each side in canola oil before baking. While baking the chops, I first sauteed a can of mushrooms, two sliced green onions, and two minced garlic cloves in the oil that was left. Then I added my cream of mushroom soup. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup. We don't cook with alcohol so instead of wine, I used the liquid from the canned mushrooms along with the milk. I added some garlic powder, parsley, thyme, and just a pinch of ceyenne pepper to the sauce. After I had baked the chops for 20 minutes, I poured the sauce over the top and baked for another 20 minutes. I served this with corn and salad, and it was delicious. These are the best pork chops I have ever made and this is the only way I will make them from now on!

I have made this twice now, and think it is wonderful.  The first time I made it pretty much as the recipe stated, and it was delicious. This time I didn't bread the pork chops, but just browned them in a little oil.  I then covered them and baked them for 30 minutes.  While they were baking, I caramelized an onion in the pan I browned the pork chops in for 30 minutes.  I then deglazed the pan with 1/3 cup Marsala wine.  I added the Marsala wine, onions, one can of cream of mushroom soup (95% fat free), and 1/2 cup 2% milk along with another 1/4 cup cooking sherry (I didn't have any white wine).  I poured over the pork chops, mixing with the juice that was already in the pan.  I covered again and continued to bake for another 45 minutes.  When finished, they did sit in a 185 degree oven for about an hour.  The sauce was to die for, and the pork chops were so tender they literally were falling apart, like they had been in the slow cooker all day.  Absolutely fabulous.  I highly recommend the Marsala wine and cooking sherry, it adds more flavor than just white wine.  Excellent recipe, I'm sure I will make it many more times!

Followed the recipe and oh-so didn't like this recipe.  The breading was soggy on the bottom and the gravy was just kind of weird tasting.  Glad i tried the recipe but it was just not for us.

Great recipe.  I, too, browned my chops very well in the pan, prior to baking.  I used one can of Cream of Mushroom with Garlic & one can of Golden Mushroom.  In lieu of milk, I used the same amount of sour cream.  I also used 1/2 cup of chianti, rather than white wine, because I had it on hand.  Sauteed mushrooms in my pan after removing the chops.. added them to the gravy for more texture and taste. ** Important to note that the soup will need to be doubled from original recipe to make a decent amount of gravy for rice or noodles.  I used 2 cans and it was barely enough for 5 -1 inch thick chops with rice.

This is by far the best pork chop recipe I have ever made.My daughter raved about them and has asked me to make them regularly. I did do a few things differently.I sauted fresh onions,garlic and mushrooms for about 5 mins and added them to the soup mixture.I poured the mixture into my casserole dish and then added the chops,so that they cooked in the soup for the entire hour. This was delish and we barely needed a knife.The gravy was perfect over mashed potatoes. I have also made this on top of the stove in a very large,deep frying pan with lid and it was just as perfect as baking in the oven.

I was really looking forward to trying this, as it had some great reviews. I wish I had looked at them more closely. The sauce completely lacked flavor.  The recipe was medicore, at best. My husband didn't find the chops all that moist. Sorry, but I will not be making this again.

I'll give this a 4, but it was closer to a 3.5 according to the family.  I used pork loin chops, which I thought should have been tender, and they weren't.  The gravey was nice and went well with the rice.  If I had more tender pork and there was just a hint of another flavour in the gravey, it would be a hit.

My family enjoyed this dinner. I only changed a few things. I used 4 thick porkchops instead of 6. I added a can of mushrooms that I sauteed in butter with 1 tsp dried onion to the soup mixture. I used 1/2 cup of chardonay instead of 1/3. It did have a wine flavor, but we enjoyed it. It definately tasted different than the basic cream of mushroom recipes. I served the gravy over white rice. Very yummy

We thought this was great.  I doubled the sauce recipe and used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of onion.  I also added a can of sliced mushrooms and served it over noodles.  Great comfort food.  The next time I make this I will triple the sauce.

Additions: Saute mushrooms and onions to add to the soup mixture (which should be tripled with 6 large pork chops) used 1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken try golden mushroom and cream of mushroom with garlic. Use less milk and more white wine. And mix half italian bread crumbs with panko.

I often have both my sons girlfriends over for dinner and both won't eat pork or beef but will eat chicken. Last night was no different. I used 3 bone-in pork chops and 3 very large boneless, skinless chicken breasts to make the recipe. I doubled the sauce, using Vermouth for the white wine called for. I also caramelized 3 thinly sliced onions then added 3 cloves garlic in the skillet, adding those veggies to the baking dish, wiping the skillet clean and then proceeding with the frying of the chops and chicken breasts, adding them on top of the caramelized veggies. I opted for the lower cooking temp. of 325° that was suggested by another reviewer and cooked a total of 30 minutes longer. The wide egg noodles I served alongside were delicious with the sauce. This was excellent! The pork chops and chicken breasts were so tender and moist! Definite keeper and subbing chicken allows me to make a meal we can all eat! By the way, the base of my 11" x 14" broiler pan was the only baking dish I could find that would fit all the chops and breasts in a single layer...9"x13" was just too small.

This really was easy. I didn't have italian breadcrumbs, so I just added a tsp. of italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs. I wanted to cut back on the fat a bit, so I just cut out the frying step and cooked them in the oven. I also added the gravy after I served everything, to keep the chops crispy. It's just a matter of personal preferance. I served this with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes. It worked out well. EDITED: The gravy is good, but it would have been better made with water instead of milk.

I made this dish tonight and it was amazing!

I didn't have any white wine, so I made the sauce with a can of condensed mushroom soup and a can of condensed chicken soup.

It turned out just as well. The meat so tender there wasn't even a need for a knife!

We will definitely make this dish many more times to come!

I am usually weary of pork chops because they tend to be dry, even in restaurants, but I tried this recipe and I was amazed at how delicious it turned out.  It was easy to prepare but the cook time is a bit long.   I baked for only 40 minutes initially and 20 minutes with the mushroom cream sauce. I did revise the recipe a bit and added a meat tenderizer (ground papaya seed) when I seasoned with salt and pepper. The meat was very juicy and flavorful.

Mouthwatering!  This recipe turned out perfect, my husband loved it too!  I did not have white wine or vermouth, so I actually substituted GIN (tanqueray) sauce was perfectly smooth & creamy, like velvet  - the chops were fork tender, melt in your mouth!

This was a great recipe.  The pork was very tender and flavorful and the sauce was perfect.  A little salty overall, but I will cut down on the seasoning salt next time.  The only change I made was that I made a box of Stove Top stuffing and put it on top of the pork chops after the initial 1 hour bake time.  I then poured the sauce over the whole thing and baked for the final 30 minutes.  Yum!  I will make this one again.

We loved this! I took others advice and doubled the soup/sauce ingredients. I also substituted milk for the wine, because I could not find a corkscrew! It turned out YUMMY! Harvey said it was a keeper....

My husband and I thought that this recipe was just wonderful! The kids REALLY enjoyed it as well. I decided to bake 3 and follow the recipe as listed, then I also decided to go ahead and pan fry the other 3 on a lower heat to cook them through. I then combined the sauce ingredients and preheated them on the stove as well. We REALLY preferred the pan fried chops rather than the baked! After we pan fried we simply drizzled the sauce over the chops and gave them about 5 minutes for the sauce to penetrate the breading as well as to cool down enough for the kids to dig in! 

We were able to complete the chops in about a 1/2 hour rather than 1 1/2 hours. We chose to serve them up with a large helping of buttery mashed potatoes and ~VIOLA~ once again dinner was a huge success!

This recipie came out great!  I really browned the chops then put them in the oven while I made the sauce.  First I browned some mushrooms in the drippings from the chops then drained any extra oil.  I added extra wine and some worcestershire sauce to add some additional flavor.  This helped make the can of mushroom soup not so "soup" tasting.  Go slow with this because it is a strong flavor.  We ate it over rice and poured the gravy over the chops at the end so the chops were still crispy from the frying. Enjoy...WE DID!

Fantastic!  Made these last night using 4 small pork chops (not too thin).  Seasoned them with granulated garlic and herbes de provence and only used 1 egg to coat.  Decided to use panko crumbs (love them!) and kept sauce measurements the same.  Quickly browned and then put my skillet right in the oven.  Decided to bake them covered for 20 mins then added my sauce and baked for another 20...perfect, moist, juicy and full of flavour!  Served steamed green beans on the side, yummy - definitely would have been great with some wild rice or pasta to have with the extra sauce!

in one word...*exquisite*.  the gravy does need to be tinkered with, but no biggie.  i doubled the sauce (1 c. mush, 1 c. of cream of celery), added more wine and sauteed shrooms.  i also dbl-dipped the chops--egg, then flour, egg, then crumbs.  the chops do get done a lot faster as other people have said.  i am really considering dumping the gravy mixture on top of the meat from the start of baking the next time i make this incredible dish...which i will be making again and SOON.

This was an excellent recipe! Super-easy to make, I had all of the ingredients in my pantry, and it came together so quickly.  I took the foil off with 15 minutes left to go, and then also broiled it after that for about 5 minutes.  My husband loved it and has already asked me to make it again!

These are the best pork chops! Doubling the sauce is a must, but instead of more wine, used chicken broth. The sauce was also great on top of rice and the vegetables we served with these. Yummy!!

We're leery of pork, but these chops were cooked just right, not bland and oh so tender and moist.  This is a staple at our table.

By husband said this is the best dish I have ever made! I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and added some sauteed onions and garlic to the sauce as well. I was a little skeptical of the recipe initially, but I am not a big pork chop fan and it was excellent. I used the amount of wine called for and I think that worked well.

These were restaurant quality pork chops.  I used cream of broccoli soup (the only Campbell's cream soup I could find with out MSG.)  (Be careful if you are adding extra cans of soup-the sodium content is really outrageous.) These are the pork chops I've been trying to make for years.  Yummy!! I've made this 4-5 times and it gets better every time. I used Marsala wine this last time and it worked just fine.

These pork chops are wonderful!  I made the recipe exactly as written and the meat was falling off the bone tender.  You could cut it with a fork, and the taste?  Yum!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, it's become a family favorite.

These are the best pork chops I have ever made!  They turned out very tender.  Takes a while from start to finish, but super easy.  If you don't like the flavor of white wine sauce, you could easily substitue chicken broth.  Like others, I was a little afraid to cook for the entire 90 mins, but I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.

I've made these several times now.  A few times I didn't have the wine so I used chicken broth instead and they were still five stars so don't panic if you don't have the wine - make them anyway!  I bake them for the full amount of time.  I'm all about following the directions exact if I'm going to rate it.  They have never burned or dried out, in fact they are so moist and tender they fall off the bone and melt in your mouth.  We always have these with Au Gratin potatoes and green beans.

My husband and I DEVOURED this recipe! The pork chops were so tender! Followed the frying and baking directions exactly (think you only need to cook the pork chops for about 4 minutes on each side on MEDIUM heat). I doubled the sauce as suggested and cooked 3 boneless pork chops that were about a 1/2 inch thick each (this allowed for plenty of extra gravy to pour over side dishes). Made a few changes to the soup mix: Used roasted garlic and mushroom soup (is 1/2 the fat of other cream soups), 1% milk, and white table wine, pressed in 3 cloves of garlic, added one packet of dry golden onion soup mix (this made it very flavorful), and salt and pepper to taste. Made the most delicious gravy, which I served over garlic mashed potaoes and sweet corn. Will be a staple recipe in my home! Only advisory is this takes awhile to make. Prep time (including the frying) takes about 30 mins, then you bake chops alone for 1 hour, then in the sauce for 30 mins., so a total of about 2 hours cooking time. Don't get off work til 5pm, so dinner was late (but woth the wait!). Would be better for a weekend dinner for very busy people.

Mmmm, soooo good.  My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  I actually did not have seasoned salt, so I used some old bay seasoning instead.  I rubbed the chops very well.  I had cheap, thin boneless chops, and I reduced the cooking time to 1/2 hour.  I actually poured the sauce over the chops and popped them in the oven.  They came out moist and juicy!  It makes cheap cuts taste like expensive thick cuts. I really loved this..thanks for sharing.

P.S. - I had ALL the ingredients in my cubbard already!  That's strange..:D

My family devoured these pork chops!  I can't believe my picky 6 and 3 year olds even requested seconds!  The only changes that I made b/c I used what was on hand was crushed garlic, cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom and chicken broth in place of the wine.  I made 8 boneless chops and doubled the sauce.  PERFECT!  Thanks OP!

This recipe was great! My husband loved it, so much in fact I made it twice in one week! Pork chops are very tender and delicious.  First time I followed recipe as written, second time I used more wine than milk like some suggested.  Definitely use the recipe as written, I thought adding more wine gave too strong of a flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were good! I used regular bread crumbs instead of Italian, but it still turned out great. Do not use the thin slices of boneless porkchops because they turn out chewy. Thanks for the recipe!

This tastes great without the wine-which I did't have on hand. I used 8 pork chops and 2 cans of condensed soup, but to keep it nice and thick I only used 1/2 cup of milk total so it makes a nice sauce. I put some worcestershire sauce in to jazz it up, cuz the soup itself can be a bit bland. 

If you're using wine, you may want to simmer it for a bit to thicken it, otherwise it could be too watery-unless you like a thinner sauce of course. 

I didn't need to bake it for as long as the recipe calls for either, I baked in for 1/2 hour, then another 1/2 with the soup over it and MMMMMMMMMMM DELICIOUS!

Just made this recipe for the first time tonight...and it was absolutely amazing.  Well, at least that's what my boyfriend said.  I don't like pork chops, so I made 3 pork chops and 3 large chicken breasts following the same recipe instructions.  The chicken turned out wonderful too!!  Both were super tender.  Only thing I changed was that I added fresh mushrooms when I added the soup mixture and I used campbells cream of mushroom with roasted garlic that I found at the grocery store.  Will make this again without a doubt!!

this was wonderful. I used a bottle of bertoli alfredo sauce and an envelope of Knorr Parma Rosa sauce in lieu of the soup. I substituted wine for some of the water required on the Parma Rosa Envelope. I had plenty of sauce and we could cut the chops with a fork. not sure how some say the chops were tough....this was so good!!!

I loved the texture of the pork chops in this recipe. I didn't have any cream of mushroom, so I had to substitue cream of chicken. This is probably the only reason I gave this 4 stars. Well, that and the gravy (sauce) tasted like canned soup. Next time I might substitue for cream of onion... I'll definitely make it again.

This is very much not the bell winner as some here has suggested.  Unless you season the hell out of your meat and sauce mixture, you will come out with a bland tasting meal.  I used a commercially available fry seasoning mix as well as doing the golden mushroom/cream of mushroom mix.  Also in the sauce, I put some whole mushroom and scallions.  Still the flavor was just ‘alright’.  The meal had a decent flavor but certainly not deserving of a five star rating on any level.  This meal rates as an average, weekday evening meal.  I would not go out of the way to make this for guests, unless you are not trying to impress them with your culinary skills.  I am not bagging on the meal but I think the 5 star rating this receives is quite questionable.  Just my $.02.

I'm giving this 4 stars just because it is a very basic dish.  But it was VERY good!  I used the boneless pork loin chops, about an inch thick.  Followed directions exactly, except only baked for 40-45 minute before putting the sauce on top.  These chops were SO tender, and great served over some long grain white rice.  Served with a VERY flavorful salad with blue cheese, cranberries, spiced pecans, and pears with balsamic vinigrette.....good idea to have a side with BIG flavor since the chops and rice are somewhat bland.

This is an excellent dish!  It takes awhile to cook, but it's easy to put together and the ingredients are usual already in the house!  My husband swears it tastes like marsala in a fine restaurant. Try it and enjoy!

this recipe was great. the pork chops were really tender. my only suggestion is go easy on the salt because with the salt, bread crumbs, and cream soup it tasted kind of salty. next time i might use reduced-sodium cream soup. will definitely be making again.

Outstanding recipe! These pork chops came out so tender and very flavorful. I was so impressed with the fact that the breading held right to the pork chops and didn't become soggy. I didn't have any white wine so I replaced it with chicken broth instead. I also added some carmelized onions into the gravy and it was delicious!

This a delicious meal!  I changed the recipe a little.  I skipped the entire breading and frying.  I placed the pork chops right into a baking dish, added salt, pepper, garlic powder, basil, oregano, parsley and a cup of chicken broth.  Baked for 1 hour (covered with foil), then poured double the mushroom soup, and double the milk.  Baked for another hour.  Delicious~!  Seriously, you can cut the meat with a fork! Thank you for this recipe!

I used two bone-in and four boneless pork chops about inch thick).  I then heated up about a cup of canola oil instead of olive oil to 350 degrees. Used 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 2 teaspoons paprika, 2 teaspoons seasoning salt, and some black pepper. Mixed it in with the Italian seasoning Bread crumbs, omited the flour and used a 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese instead. Dredge in the Breadcrumb mixrue and then into the eggs, and repeat two to three times. Coating the pork chops really good, and cooking about 5 minutes to 8 on each side until a nice crispy golden brown. Then drained the grease off the pork chops with a paper towel, placed in the pan covered with chopped onions/scallions. Cooked for an hour.... I also cook the sauce in a sepeart pan. And add the goldon mushroom like suggested. I did alter the sauce used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of golden mushroom, 2/3 c. fat free milk, 1/4 c. apple juice (instead of wine, a dash of fresh thyme leaves, a dash of worcestershire sauce. And add fresh sliced mushrooms. I think next time I might try adding a few diced granny smith apples. We ate it with mashed potato, green beans, carrots and then had with egg noodle the second day for lunch....

Major comfort food.  Heavy and very filling.  Would be good on a cold winter's night.  Very bland.  I added an envelope of onion soup mix and a can of mushrooms to the gravy mix, which helped jazz it up a little.  My kids loved it and my husband and I thought it was good for winter (not a 92 degree summer's day, which it was when I fixed it!)  The meat was nice and tender.  Lots of dirty dishes!

This is the first time I've made chops that don't make your jaw sore from chewing!  Even my picky 6 year old asked for them the next day (her's was chicken, but prepared the same way)

These were wonderful...my husband told me they tasted like the pork chops his grandmother use to make (MAJOR compliment!) I Will definitely make again. I used 4 boneless center cut pork chops and substituted chicken broth for the wine. I cooked for 25 minutes without the sauce and 25 minutes with the sauce and they were extremely tender and yummy!

I just made this recipe last night, and it turned out great.  I have made similar recipes, but none that were as good as this one.  The pork chops were so tender and the sauce was so tasty (I did add some salt and pepper to spice it up).  Plus, it was so easy to make.  I will definitely make this again and pass the recipe along.
***
I made this recipe again last week.  This time, I pounded the pork chops so they were wafer thin.  It tasted even better and cooked much faster.  I will make sure I do that from now on.

Great recipe! Everyone liked it. I used boneless chops 1 inch thick. Did the 30 and 30 too. Don't think i would have liked it if i would have cooked for an hour first. Will make again and again!!

Really good!  Even my kids ate this one.  I added 1/2 cup sour cream to the soup mixture and it was a good addition.  Also, I did not cook the chops as long as the recipe stated.  I baked for 35 minutes, then added the soup, then baked for 30 more minutes.  I thinks the pork chops would have dried out if cooked any longer.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I made a few changes based on the suggestions I read in other reviews.  As mentioned in one of the reviews, I substituted a mixture of apple juice and vinegar for the wine.  I also didn't have eggs, so I left them out.  I sauteed garlic and onion and mixed it in with the soup before pouring over the pork chops.  I also added some thyme (as suggested by one reviewer) to the soup mixture.  The pork chops were so tender, we didn't need a knife to cut them.  My husband and I didn't leave any for leftovers!  This recipe is delicious!  It takes some time to prepare, but the results are worth it.

Just made this tonight.  Very easy to make and the whole family loved it!  The meat was so tender.  I did use chicken broth instead of wine, but I'm sure it would taste good either way.  The sauce tasted great over rice, might even try it over some mash potatoes next time.

WOW!  I must say, now I can see (and taste) why this recipe has gotten such high scores!  It is delicious.  Even my 6 yr old said, "Mom this is fantastic!"  Well, I did have to alter a few things, due to limited items in the house.  This is what I substitued... olive oil - vegetable oil; creme of mushroom - creme of celery; white wine - extra milk.  Then I also added some Lipton Mushroom soup mix into the milk & creme of celery, since I didn't have the creme of mushroom; and last I used the round box of Stove top hometyle herb stuffing mix instead of italian.  Apparantly this recipe can be altered to suit everyone.  I used boneless thick pork chops, cooked them the way it said, and you could still cut them with a fork.  This will definatly be made again my house!  Thanks for the great recipe!  It saved my family from a bland meal!  God Bless!!!

I usually hate pork chops because they can be so difficult to eat, but I had the meat and I needed to cook it. This recipe was FANTASTIC. The meet was so tender we didn't even use knives to cut it. The gravy was great and went wonderful with rice. I cooked some green peas and this was a complete meal and so simple. I didn't use the wine as I don't ever have alchahol around but it was still great. I highly recommend this.

These were just ok....not a lot of flavor. I did not make any changes to the recipe, except that I only had the "healthy request" cr. of mushroom soup.  My chops were a little dry.  I don't think I will make this again.

This recipe was awesome! My whole family loved it ... my husband even told me to make sure that I file the recipe so that I can make it again. I didn't have any white wine, so I just added a little more milk to the cream of mushroom and it turned out fine. I also sprinkled some chopped green onions on top. Wonderful!

This was phenominal, however I burned the first side of my pork chop when I was searing it because 5 minutes at medium-high heat was too long.  Next time I would only sear it for about 2 minutes per side or reduce the heat to medium.  Great recipe though, my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I made brown rice for the sauce.

Always a hit! Every time I am surprised by just how tender these turn out. I usually heat the mushroom soup mixture before I pour it over the pork chops--just to get the flavours out into the sauce before the pork soaks it all up.

Excellent comfort food recipe !! I used loads of garlic powder and Mrs. Dash table salt...one consideration would be to bake the chops alone and cook the gravy on the stove top then serve on the side... otherwise these were great !!

My husband's took a bite and said "AWESOME!"  I used fume blanc, a dry sweet wine and it gave it just the right kick.  I cut the time it cooked after adding the sauce from 30 min to 20 min and it was cooked perfectly.  I served it with applesauce, green beans and old fashioned lemonade (recipe from this site).

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! It comes out wonderfully every time. We like a little more gravy so I add 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of mushroom with garlic. Serve with Wild Rice, French Bread and a Caesar Salad...a VERY impressive meal.

Really, really delicious!! Not your typical pork chops, I did reduce the amount of wine to about 3 tablespoons, and reduced the baking time to a total of about 1hour and 15 minutes, Terrific!!!!

These pork chops were great.  In our family we cook chicken breast this same way.

Very, very good recipe.  Pork chops were very tender.  Husband loved it!  Couldn't stop raving about it.  I liked it too, but I'm thinking of tweaking the sauce a little.

This was wonderful. Although they sound like a lot of work they aren't too time consuming. I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the baking time to half hour without sauce and half hour with sauce. I served the chops and gravey with stuffing and roasted asparagus, it was awsome. It looks great too, use this when you need a great presentation. This recipe is now one of my signatures. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe, however, I as others mentioned would cut the cooking time to 30 minutes and then another 30 minutes with the sauce. I also added sauted onions and mushrooms. Thank you Dawn!!

These chops are excellent, but an hour and a half is way too long.  I used cream of mushroom soup with garlic, and used chicken stock instead of wine (didn't have any). I cook them for 20 minutes, and then smothered them.  I then cooked them another 5, and they were perfect. Cooking them too long will dry them out.  Frying them to extra crisp works well.

The breading on these chops is EXCELLENT.  I really liked the recipe---except the white wine was a bit much- it will be omitted next time!  Overall very yummy.

This was a perfect and easy dinner.  I did change some things to fit my husband and child's taste - I omitted the wine, added garlic, added fresh sliced mushrooms and used cream of mushroom and garlic soup - pretty darn good!  I also found that I didn't have to cook the dish as long as instructed.  Served it up with some mushroom risotto and fresh vegtables.

These chops were good because the texture of the meat after it cooked was unlike any chop I had eaten before.  It almost fell apart like roast.  In fact, it didn't even have the typical pork taste to it.  The breading gave the chops a "chicken-fried steak" taste.  Very different.  Very interesting.  To give this recipe five stars I would have needed a little more flavor...it was a little bland.

Superb!  I can't eat pork chops any other way now! This has become one of my favorite recipes, but I am to impatient so I do cut the cooking time a little and it still turns out wonderfully!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!  I followed MA_CHERI's advice and doubled the soup and used half-n-half instead of milk.  The pork chops were so tender I didn't need a fork!  I did reduce the cooking time.  I baked the chops for 45 minutes and another 30 after adding the sauce.  Thanks Dawn!

This recipe is the bomb. I never really cared for pork chops but now I can't get enough of them. I have given this recipe to everyone I know and they can't believe how good they are. The only thing that I changed was I didn't add the wine (don't care for the taste). Something else I did (after I started burning everyone out with pork chops) was to substitute skinless, boneless chicken breasts for the pork chops. It is just as everybit good. Kudos to Dawn Edberg for submitting this little piece of heaven!

My husband and I thought this was a very good recipe. The only thing I would do differently next time is to make more sauce. I used 6 thin boneless pork chops and for side dishes we had egg noodles and acorn squash. We would have like to have enough sauce to put over the egg noodles (next time I will double). If you don't like a lot of sauce, then follow the recipe. The only thing I did differently was to put the cream of mushroom soup, milk and wine in the skillet after I cooked the pork chops to incorporate that flavor into the sauce. YUM!! Also, I did not have Itallian bread crumbs so I had to use plain. It was still delicious!!! I will make this again.

Disappointing.  I thought I'd found a winner when I saw this recipe so highly rated.  The only changes I made to the recipe were to add sauteed mushrooms to the sauce and to cut the cooking time to 25/25 as I was cooking only 3 chops.  They were still very dry--I can't imagine 60/30!  And I wasn't crazy about the sauce either--too much wine maybe?  My husband was kind to my cooking and said it was ok, but I noticed even he did not clear his plate.  I'm taking this one OUT of my recipe box.

I know I am in the minority here, but I didn't really care for these.  My husband who is a pork lover only had one serving.  They were just bland and the breading was soggy.

Very delicious.  I sautee chopped onion and mushroom with wine in the pan I used to brown pork chop first.  Then add cream of mushroom and milk to make the sauce.  I'm going to double the sauce next time.

I just love this recipe. But I made it in hotbags at 450. ( use the same time called for)But I did find the mushroom soup salty. I think next time I will add more milk anywhere from 1/8 to 1/4 cup more milk. But I did like this recipe I will definitely make again. Thanks Tobie

Yummy!!  My husband and I both loved it, and I will definitely be making it again.  I did have to use a lot of dishes for the various dippings of the chops, but it was well worth it.  And the bake time wasn't as long as the recipe said.....although the author may have used much thicker chops.  Mine were about a 1/2" thick, and I only baked for 40 minutes and then 25 minutes.

I forgot I'd reviewed this some years ago, but am back to say it's just as good as ever!  My kids loved it!  I added some fresh sliced mushrooms I had on hand, added the garlic powder and seasoned salt right to the breadcrumbs rather than rubbing them on.  I didn't have white wine, so used white wine vinegar, which was delicious!!

I made this for my family.  I didn't think the prep was that hard but when I asked if they liked it we all said the same thing,it was just ok.  The breading didn't really seem necessary.  I will consider making it again but only if I just use the soup/gravy and that is nothing like the intent of the recipe.

Went according to the direction and it was a hit. Just a tip. I browned mine pretty crisp and they only required 20 minutes at 350 in the oven before pouring the soup mixture over them. I did leave them in for 30 minutes after the soup was added to insure everything came together.

I was short on time and made the abridged version. I didn't  fry them. I did the whole coating thing. Sprayed my pan, put the chops in the pan, sprayed the top with cooking spray. Forgot to cover them. Baked for 20 minutes, flipped them, baked for 10 minutes, poured my preheated sauce on top, returned to oven for another 15 minutes. They were so tender my husband commented on them. Sorry I wasn't able to make the original recipe, but they were amazing.

I made it tonight for dinner and it was phenomenal!! It was moist and seasoned very well. I had to alter the baking time. The pork chops I got from Costco were 2in tick, so I baked it for 2 hrs at 375. I will be making it again, thanks for sharing.

Just tried it last nite. Best pork chop recipe ever. Lengthy cook time well worth the wait. Juicy & tender over the top on taste. Served with fresh Swiss chard grown by our friend.

We really liked this. I took another reviewer's suggestion and did not pan fry these ahead of time, but rather sprayed the pan and the breaded coating of the pork chops, then baked.  Does not need 1 h, 30 mins to cook (maybe a little more than 45 mins).  Used corn flake crumbs and panko bread crumbs to bread the chops and added some oregano, salt, pepper, garlic powder to the breading and the flour. Left the mushroom sauce on the side; I recommend doubling the sauce amount also.  Served with Mushroom Rice Pilaf.  So delicious!

I have cook porked chops almost like this for years. It is a great way to cook a cheaper cut of pork chops such as pork steaks. I season mine with pepper and garlic salt. Brown them well on both sides and place them in a baking dish. I pour a can of cream of mushroom soup and one one can of water in the skillet. Heat up scraping the bottom of the skillet. Pour over meat, cover and cook for about 1 1/2 hours at 325 deg. Can eat over rice or mashed potatoes. The only difference I see is I don't flour them first of use white wine. Easy way to cook them and they are delicious.

For the pork chops to cook that long in the oven they must be 2" thick or better.

Fabulous recipe! I cooked for the amount of time in the recipe, and doubled the sauce. The only changes that I made were to use a can of cream of mushroom soup with garlic along with a can of regular cream of mushroom. Used Chardonnay for the wine. Also added sautéed onion and baby Bella mushrooms to the sauce. It was a huge hit!

This is an awesome recipe.. I agree with a couple of other posts... Double the gravy portion.. Also.  Sautee onions and fresh mushrooms in the fry pan drippings.. Add a dash of olive oil if necessary... Add to gravy... Also..only baked pork chops for 30 minutes.. Added gravy and baked additional 30.. My adult children loved it.. Highlight of new years dinner

I made this recipe tonight and my husband (who is a chef by the way) loved it. The chops were so soft we did  not need a knife. I made a slight change that turned out amazing. I used the creme of mushroom and roasted garlic instead is the regular creme of mushroom. I will definitely do it again.

This recipe went over really well here - even with my husband who has a professed disdain for pork chops. I kept the recipe almost as is and it would be just fine that way. My few simple tweaks were: adding a half cup parmesan to the bread crumbs, doubling the sauce (after reading many reviews to do so!), and adding a can of cream of chicken soup to the cream of mushroom so it wasn't overwhelmingly "mushroom-y". This will definitely make another appearance here!

This is a very tasty and healthy way to prepare pork chops.  I made it with 4 chops and adjusted accordingly.  If you don't have any white wine, go get some!

I used 3 thick pork sirloins as I prefer these. The gravy/sauce mix was a wonderful compliment to the meat, and the chops turned out so tender, yet still remained juicy. I made sure that the breading was very well browned and just trusted the bake times without checking them throughout baking. I will definitely be making these again for my family!

This is the first time I have ever made a tender pork chop.  I didn't have mushroom soup, so I just breaded, fried, and baked them covered for 1 hour.  When they were finished, I poured hot pork gravy on them.  Um, um good.

This is really great! I used red robin seasoning instead of seasoning salt, and a parmesan herb bread crumb mix cause I'm allergic to all the Italian bread crumb mixes at my store. I also used chardonnay add my white wine..figured I'd I'm buying a Bourne I'm sure as he'll gonna drink it too! Turned out great abd my husband loved them. He said ours his favorite pork chops that I've made so far! Although I only cooked them for 35 minutes... the hour and a half with frying is WAY too much. The pork chops I think were already done after frying..Our near to it, but the oven made them incredibly tender. Highly recommend!

It is very rarely that I give a recipe that has soup in it a 5 star review but this is so tasty and tender.  We can't stand dried out pork and this is certainly not dry.  Followed some suggestions and added more sauteed mushrooms and, when I have it, definnitely white wine.      Rich but worth it and great over creamy mashed potatoes. It is also good with mashed sweet potatoes.

Made this last night, it's excellent.   Only thing I did was added sautéed onion and mushrooms to the soup mixture.  It's even great left over.  Thanks for the recipe!  We will be making this again.

I just discovered this app and I'm it!!  This was an awesome dish. When I say something was awesome it means my kids enjoyed it as much as we did. I didn't put the wine in it and added a ton of fresh mushrooms. Kids are the left overs the next day.

A good meal for a weeknight - along with some rice and green beans.  I made more sauce/gravy than called for and didn't cook the meat for as long as required.

It was actually very tasty, I didn't have white wine but I had Mascato, and it turned out great. Next time I make this I will make more of the gravy mixture because it goes fast.

I really love this recipe although I have changed some things. I do not bread the pork chops. I sprinkle them with all season and brown them on both sides so they are basically cooked, and place them in the pan. In addition to the cream of mushroom soup I also add a small can of cream of celery soup. In the soup mixture I use moscoto wine (I use the singles because I do not drink wine and that is a perfect measurement so no leftovers) I added some more spices to the recipe, 2 teaspoons or so of thyme, parsley, garlic, course sea salt and course black pepper. Also I added a tablespoon of dried spring onions. I add the mixture to the pan, poor it over the pork chops and bake it for 35-45 mins.  I serve it over brown rice and poor the mixture over the rice. It is delicious. I am very thankful for your recipe. I would have never thought of it on my own. I am an experimenter though. My husband gets annoyed but only when I fail! Thanks again for you recipe!

I am giving this 4 stars for a couple of reasons but the main being the gravy. I thought the gravy was horrid because of the addition of wine. Maybe I had chosen the wrong white wine but I def opt out of adding that next time. Yes, I will make this again, with a new gravy recipe. I did what past reviewers said to do... First I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne- I simply just sprinkled all of this on the chops and rubbed it in. We then pan fried it a bit longer and with the oil hot to make it crispy... But be careful! Too long will burn it! Then we put it in the oven for about 20 minutes. We chose not to add the gravy on top of the chops but instead put it in a pan on the stove and left it on the side (thank goodness bc we did not enjoy the gravy!) but overall it was delicious. We paired this with mashed potatoes and green beans!

Yummy! I've made these twice now, and they are really good! Be sure to read the other reviews and make some of the common modifications. Perfect with mashed potatoes, because the extra sauce in the pan can double as a delicious homemade gravy. All in all, if you want tasty, tender, porky goodness, be sure to give these a try. You wont be disappointed :)

Wow cooked this with pork chop with bone cut out. Very nice! Great flavor. Doubled the gravy like most posts. Used cooking cherry instead of white wine. Did cook in oven for 45min. then heated the gravy mixture and cooked additional 20 min. Gravy was thick and nice with veggies that we baked along side. Definite keeper!!

I made the recipe almost as written. The only things I changed was I added grated Parmesan to the bread crumbs, and only cooked 3 chops instead of 6 (was all I had). But I kept the sauce the same. I'll admit, I was a little worried when I mixed the sauce together. All I could smell was wine (I used a cheap Chardonnay). But it turned out just fantastic!! Will make again!

I tried this recipe tonight!  I loved it... I love trying new recipes.  I won't try a new recipe w/o reading the reviews first!   I buy thick boneless pork chops & after 35 ms they weren't done so I added another 10 ms on the timer!  I can't see them taking an hour & 30 ms!!   I did put the gravy on after I put them in a baking dish... I was diappointed I didn't have any wine or vermouth in the house. But it still came out delicious!  Next time, wine,  45ms & mashed potatoes!

Super Yummy! Can't rave enough! I shortened the frying time to 3:30 on each side and baked them for 20 min before the gravy and 20 min after. I also doubled the gravy recipe and added some sauteed sweet onions. Everyone, including my 3 yr old, loved it!

I tried this recipe for the first time--I thought it was awesome, as did my family. The only thing I added was fried onions and mushrooms only because I had them in the fridge, I also topped them with the canned fried onions  I had left over from another recipe.The pork chops I used were center cut, boneless, 1 inch thick. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

My family loved it. It does take that long to bake because I used thick bone in pork chops.  I think all the people who complained about it taking so long were using thin boneless chops.
Use Pork Loin Center Cut Thick Chops about 13 ounces each & they turn out spectacular.

My husband loves pork chops but wouldn't touch wine.  BUT!  Pork must trump wine because he loved it!  Very easy to put together.  And love that it bakes for a long time.  Supper is started and I have time to do other things.  They taste amazing and of course fall off the bone.  Definitely winner!

Delicious, wonderful recipe.I made thick pork chops which only needed 35 mins baking time. Very mosit. We didn't care for the sauce, but was great with the apple sauce or cramberry sauce. I also like the stuffing bread crumbs better than the Italian bread crumbs for taste. Perfect for company, because all preparations can be done the night before, left in the frig. and baked a half hour before serving.

Cheers Marlene

These have to be the best pork chops that I have made in a long time. The frying of the porkchops first was the key, they were tender on the inside but a little crisp on the outside. I used my own measurements for the season salt and garlic powder knowing that we like a lot of flavor. I also rubbed the season salt and garlic powder into the pork chops which I think is key!

This is NOT a five star recipe.  Almost every reviewer made changes before rating this a 5.  It should be called fried pork chops, finished in the oven.  Anyway, these are not that tasty without making additions like onions, garlic, and additional seasonings in the gravy.  Just OK otherwise.

I tried to make these as directed but was unwell and wasn't really thinking clearly. Now with that being said, I over browned the pork, not burned but close. Sauté the mushrooms in the pan with some white wine (1 cup) and mixed that in with 2 cans of mushroom soup. Added more wine 1.5 cups, threw it all in the oven (totally didn't see that I was to cook the pork chops half the time without sauce. TURNED OUT WONDERFUL!!!  My chops were 2" thick and huge (costco, love it ) so the cook time of 1 hour was perfect, not dry but moist with that lovely breading. Made baby potatoes with dill and broccoli with lemon. Again, wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is so yummy! I usually just fry pork chops but I wanted to try something different.  I followed the recipe for the most part. I did not have italian bread crumbs so I added Italian seasoning to original breadcrumbs. I wish I had fresh mushrooms to add to the sauce because I love mushrooms. I will definitely make this again.  This recipe reminds me of chicken marsala..... but of course with pork instead of chicken.

Really good "homey" comfort food kind of recipe.  I know people don't like it when they tweak the recipe then review it, but for me, rosemary and pork are a match made in heaven, so I added a 1/2 tsp to the mushroom sauce and it made it smell and taste very nice.  Had with brown rice and steamed asparagus.  Yum!

I didn't make the soup sauce, but did everything else according to the recipe.  These turned out to make very good oven "fried" chops.  My gang loved them.  Even my picky 12 year old devoured it.  Will hang on to this recipe.

My Husband and I absolutely love this recipe. I have made it several times and he really does not like pork since his own mother would make pork chops for them growing up and would often over bake them. This recipe is delicious and the chops are so tender. It will leave you with a bit of a mess to clean up but well worth the effort. It is a perfect recipe for middle of the week or when you want to impress some deserving company. I make this recipe as is but with 1/2 the sauce as there is only 2 of us.

This was as hit in my house. Instead of Cream of Mushroom soup, I used Cream of Chicken. I also heated the cream of chicken soup, milk, and wine on the stove for about 10 minutes before I poured it on the pork chops in the oven. I also added a little sea salt, parmesan cheese, and pepper to the sauce. Since I had thin cut pork chops, they didn't need to be in the pan for 5 minutes per side to brown, and they didn't need to be in the oven for 1.5 hours either. I browned the meat, put it in the baking pan, covered it, cooked it for 30 minutes on 350, took the pan out and poured the cooked milk, wine, cream of chicken sauce on the pork chops - also added a little parmesan cheese to the top of it; then placed the baking pan back in the oven for another 30 minutes, covered. Served with basmati rice and collard greens, this was perfect and everyone kept going back for seconds. Delish!

OMG!!! Can I just say that I do NOT eat pork chops, like EVER! I decided to make these for the hubby and kids as it was so easy to throw all together....THESE WERE AMAZING!!!! I ate TWO porkchops!!! I made as followed, the only difference was that I added additional seasoning (quite a bit of paprika) and I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of broccoli..and reduced cooking time accordingly.

I made these, but I made a pan gravy with onions after I fried the chops.  After frying the chops, I fried sliced onions in the pan with the oil left over from the frying, then once they were caramelized, I added the wine to deglaze the pan and let it cook down a little.  Then I added two tablespoons of flour and cooked that while stirring it in the pan to get the raw flour taste out. I added the can of soup to the pan and stirred that until it was blended. I didn't add as much milk as the recipe calls for, but basically I just added a little at a time and then stirred and cooked it until it was the consistency of what I like in a gravy.  Add a little salt and pepper to the gravy to season it. I poured the gravy over the chops and baked it and WOW!  These were the most amazing pork chops we've ever had. I also made them without the breading, just seasoned them with season salt and seared them in the pan and then did the same gravy and my family was blown away again then.  The pan gravy rocks.

Awesome recipes. I always get thin cut pork chops so I didn't have to cook it that long. I did add a dash of dill weed cayenne pepper and garlic in the sauce. I also used 1/2 cup of white wine instead of 1/3. My fiance took to bites and begged me to save this recipe.

I have made this recipe twice, once with the white wine & once with apple juice (per another review). Both times my family loved them. I should say that I did change a couple of things. First I wasn't sure if my picky eater would eat the sauce so I kept it on the side instead of pouring it over the chops, second since I was leaving it on the side I added one sweet onion to a pan and some oil, cooked down the onion then added milk, juice or wine and the cream of mushroom. Lastly I only cooked the chops for about 40 min to keep them from drying out. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely amazing! My husband said this is the type of meal we would pay a lot of money for in a restaurant. I took others advice and increased wine (1/2 cup) and decreased milk (1/3 cup). I also added scallions. Yum! Next time I will add sautéed mushrooms to the sauce. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you

I have made this several times and finally felt I needed to review it because it is fabulous. I took other reviews into consideration and when I make it I use more wine than called for (I don't measure exact) and I also sauté some baby Bella mushrooms in the pan after browning the pork and throw them in with the sauce. Cooking time is not as long as the recipe calls for, I generally do 20/20 or a little longer. I think it depends on how thick the chops are and how many. Also, to cut down on fat, I use the low fat cream of mushroom soup and it's perfect. I serve over brown rice with a salad. My boyfriend loves this meal. *I wanted to update this to add that I use a Penzey's Pork Chop spice in this dish, and I both season the pork before browning and shake a fair amount into the sauce before pouring over the pork while baking.  I really think this spice makes the dish for us and would recommend it for anyone who uses Penzey's spices.  My boyfriend LOVES this meal and would ask for it every night if he could.

I just didn't love this recipe. The pork was moist and had a nice consistency but the sauce was just canned cream of mushroom soup. It was OK but I wouldn't make it again.

This is excellent. I made it last night and I would not change one thing. The purpose of a review is to rate the actual recipe, not change it, in doing so you are submitting a new recipe. For our family, the recipe does not need changing.

I made this for my family and they loved it!! Definitely will be making it again.. I followed the recipe and I used boneless thick cut pork chops. I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I used garlic and herb which is almost the same thing.

Flavor is excellent.  The chops I got came out tough and I don't think it was the recipe's fault.  Next time I will cook them slower and longer.

Yummy and simple, and it's great because I keep these ingredients on hand.  Cooking time is way too long, though.  After searing, mine only need 30 minutes in the oven.  I also use my own recipe for country gravy instead of the gravy for this recipe.

This was excellent!  Followed the recipes exactly, but used panko bread crumbs seasoned with Italian seasoning since that's all I had.  I also had no mushroom soup since we try to limit our processed foods, so I googled "Mushroom soup substitute" and used one of the recipes that I found.  I'm not usually a big pork chop fan, but these were excellent!

This turned out really well for me.  The flavor was wonderful, and the chops were so tender you could cut them with a fork.  It does take a while to prep and cook, but it is a great Sunday supper recipe.  I followed the recipe as written as far as ingredients, but I did have to modify the cooking time, probably because I had thin pork chops.  Five minutes per side was too long on the frying time, and it needed about 45 minutes after the sauce was added instead of thirty. Also two cups of bread crumbs was way more than I needed.  Next time I will probably use about half of that.  This recipe will definitely be a keeper at my house.

This is my new go to recipe for pork chops. I make the recipe just as it says. I never know what kind of wine to use when something says "dry white wine", so I have tried a few different ones. Most recently I used sauvignon blanc and that was good. I would suggest reducing the cooking time unless your chops are really thick. I cook mine for about 1 hour total. 30 minutes in the oven, add sauce, and then bake for another 30 minutes. Best served with corn and mashed potatoes.

You know I accidentally bought pork steaks and could not use a 9x13 pan.so I used a roasting pan and doubled up on the gravy mix. People, trust me , this is the only baked pork chop recipe we will use from here on. with mashed potato's corn and pillsbury flaky biscuits you will never go wrong. The gravy left over from the mixture will be perfect for the tater's . I recommend sweet corn on the side...  :) Thank you for a great recipe that we will use on a regular basis from now on... :)

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The key to the recipe is to brown the pork chops until the outside is crispy.  I do it in an electric skillet with enough oil to almost fry them. The pork chops are so tender it's amazing. I have passed this recipe on to many family members.  I

Very good!Didn't change anything except omitted the wine.They did get soggy in the oven but the payoff was that they were very tender! My picky kids ate it. My son had the leftovers for lunch today. That says alot!Thanks!

I had this last night and it was very good.  I doubled the sauce, which was great when served over rice.  I also took fellow reviers advice and made sure to make the chops extra crispy.  It was a pretty quick and simple meal.  I will make it again!

A family favorite for us! Made them last week and didn't have any more wine, so I substituted apple juice as another person suggested. My husband LOVED it and thought it was a totally different recipe. Also doubled the soup mixture and served as gravy with mashed potatoes, it was wonderful.

This came out great.  I did use the advice of a previous reviewer and double breaded then baked just baked for about 50 minutes the pork chops without prefrying.  We then served the gravy over the top.  I did add sauteed mushrooms and onions to the gravy.  The pork chops were very juicy. Will definitely be making this again.

My husband specifically told me to make sure I rate this recipe, he gave it 2 high fives=5 stars! I have NEVER had a pork chop that melts in my mouth like this one. Wow... it was sooo tender we used our forks. I did pan fry for 10 minutes, then only did 25/20 without sauce and then an extra 15 min in the oven when I put the gravy on top.  I also added mushrooms to the sauce as well, other than that I kept it all the same.  My husband even took the left overs to work... which he NEVER touches leftovers no matter how good it might be... this is  a keeper!

An easy last minute dinner fix with good down-home flavors.  Great comfort food.  Fried pork chop with cream of mushroom gravy?  This is the classic.

I made these for dinner tonight.  They are wonderful!  I used bone in pork chops.  I browned them very well on the stove top then put them in the oven pan.  Then I deglazed the stove pan with the chardonnay.  I also put sliced onions in with the chardonnay and cooked it down a little.  I then mixed that with the soup/milk mixture and poured it all over the chops and baked them covered for 1 hour and a half.  They turned out incredible and tender!  I served over rice with roasted asparagus.  Definitely going into my rotation!

This was absolutely delicious! I unfortunately had to use cooking wine in place of alcoholic wine because I still have 4.5 long months before I turn 21. I followed the rest of the recipe to the T and I was amazed at the amount of flavor and moisture it had. One tip: wait till the oil is HOT before  you fry the pork chops.

Delicious. I didn't have white wine so I used champagne instead and it was so yummy! I agree with the others that the pan needed sprayed with cooking spray and the sauce was only really enough for 4 chops. I also heated the gravy in a pan, then poured it over the chops right before serving. The sauce could have used more wine and less milk, so I'll do that next time. And the baking time was off - I did it for about 50 minutes total.

Everyone in my house loves these. Even my father in law who claims pork gives him tummy aches, eats these up. (cooking is a pain with 3 picky kids and an even pickier FIL, lol)I don't always make the sauce because the chops on their own are great, especially when paired with biscuits  and gravy. If the chops are thin enough sometimes they don't require any bake time, but if they do I find that an hour is way too long. Thanks for this recipe its an A++ in my book.

This is a favorite in our house.  I have altered the recipe just slightly.  I use two cans of soup; one can of cream of mushroom and one can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom.  My family likes to have some of the sauce to put over the rice or egg noodles that we usually make to accompany this great dish.  My family also prefers the sauce with all milk, so no white wine.

Simply amazing. I did everything as written but I used 7 boneless pork chops. Next time I make them, and there will be a next time :), I will double the gravy because we lacked in that area. And I will use less bread crumbs. I used the 2 cups and breaded each chop well but I feel like I wasted a lot. MAKE THESE AND YOU WON'T BE SORRY! :)

We used some of the ideas from reviewers and added a can of golden mushroom, doubled the milk and white wine. 
We are going to add this to our keeper box.

This is one of my family's favorite meals. I use cream of chicken soup because some of my family won't eat it if they see or hear mushroom in anything. I use at least 1/2 cup of white wine, just because it gives the sauce a wonderful flavor and keeps the cream of chicken soup flavor from dominating.

I was very disappointed. I had nice thick bonless pork chops that came out dry because of the cook time. I even decreased it to 45 mins and then 15 mins. I could have  just put them in with the mushroom mixture for 35 mins. Annoyed that I ruined my porkchops with this recipe.

This recipe was very easy and yummy.  I made a few subtle changes.  Used Panko to bread the chops, instead of plain breadcrumbs.  Also added some sauteed mushrooms to the sauce, along with some black pepper, parsley, and a tablespoon of Gravy Master. I used pretty thick chops, and found that they only needed to be baked for about 35-40 minutes total.  This recipe will definitely be marked as one of the family favorites.

Used cream of chicken instead of mushroom.  Baked for about 30-40 minutes then for another 30 with the sauce and the chops were perfect. Nice and moist. Made 3 chops and kept the amount of sauce the same, and there was just enough for gravy on our mashed potatoes.

Very very good.  Even my picky son liked them.  They turned out very tender.  The breading and sauce have great flavor.  I will be making these for family events in the future.

Was definitely a hit in our house.  Made this for our weekly dinner and even the kids ate it up.  Added fresh mushrooms to the sauce but the rest was followed to a t and it was delicious.  perfect even for my picky parents.  Pork chops were sooo juicy.

I made the pork chops and I thought they were very good. I used boneless chops and I only had red shiraz wine. I also added a few dashes of light soy sauce. This meal was very good and I will make again! I read some other reviews and would love to add onions and fresh mushrooms too next time :)

This recipe makes a lot of dirty dishes and takes a long time to bake.  It was quite bland even with added parsley. Why season the meat then dip in egg?  If I make again, I will layer sliced onion on the bottom of the baking dish and top with the gravy at the table so the crust isn't soggy.  And add the seasoning right before baking.

This was very good. Only thing I did different was I used 3 pork chops.  Next time I will double the gravy as we thought it needed more.  This lacked alittle flavor thats why the 4 stars.

It turned out amazing! I had to improvise a few things only because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used garlic salt instead of seasoned salt & used crushed French Fried Onions instead of bread crumbs. Baked it for 50min, added soup & 1cup of milk then baked another 20min. The sauce thickens & makes an awesome gravy!! My husband loved it!!

These were just okay.  Not sure why my family didn't love this given the rave reviews, but I just thought the sauce made the chops a big soggy and the cooking time was too long.

Great pork chop recipe.  Made it exactly how the recipe is written exept I used two large pork chops instead of 6.  There was enough sauce/gravy for the mashed potatoes.  Also, I only needed to cook the pork chops in the oven for 40 minutes before adding the sauce.  ETA: I have made this Gluten free by using GF flour, GF bread crumbs and GF cream of mushroom and it comes out wonderful.

Absolutely, perfectly excellent!  I wish there was a 10-star rating!  I cooked exactly as written only with 4 chops instead of 6 - mainly because that's how many came in the package!

My family loved this. I followed the recipe as stated except we only had red wine. I also don't like cream of mushroom, so we used cream of chicken. It could have been a little more strongly spiced, but we served it over rice with a salad and it was great. I thought the gravy was sufficient. There was no need to double it.

Very good tasting. The coating I fried on it gave it another flavor dimension. Made extra gravy by using 2 cans of mush soup, 3/4 milk, and 2/3 wine. The gravy was so tasty. Made this with corn casserole. I admit that I am not much of a cook but I managed to make this. Pork was easy to tear apart, but more firm when chewing. Family loved it and said that they would like it again.

These chops turned out very moist and the seasoning is really good as well. I just put the seasoning salt and the garlic powder into the flour before coating the chops instead of sprinkling them with it directly. My husband normally cant stand pork chops but he told me he loved these! This will be my go to pork chop recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Nice flavor, nice meal.  Would recommend using a thick cut of pork chops, though.  I use as few processed foods as possible and made my own cream of mushroom soup instead of using canned.  Makes "almost" enough sauce to serve over potatoes or rice.

This is the best pork chop recipe that I have used -- totally a comfort food!  I used 2-inch butterfly pork chops and cooked at the amount of time specified.  The only change I made was to use fresh garlic sauteed in the olive oil before adding the chops instead of garlic powder, and I doubled the sauce to serve with mashed potatoes.  Kids loved this one!

My boyfriend loved this recipe. Its a good comfort dish. The only mistake I made was that I only did 2 porkchops (I 1/3'd the recipe) but I did not decrease cooking time so the porkchops turned out too dry. So next time I am going to try to cook for like 30 min and 20 min in the oven instead of an hour and a half hour. But the flavor was spot on!

This was very good. I don't usually buy pork chops, but got some in a pack from Omaha Steaks, so was just looking for a way to use them. I skipped the frying step to save calories, time, and mess. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly- everyone loved them.

LOVE this recipe! My boyfriend devoured it! I sauteed fresh mushrooms in some oil with garlic then added the wine, milk and soup to the pan to heat up. I also added black pepper and salt to it.  I used pretty thick boneless chops and baked them 45 minutes after browning them. I did not put the gravy on it and bake it more though. I just put the gravy to the side so we could put as much or as little on the chops. They were SO moist!

This was amazingly delish.  My chops were very thick lovely T chops and so I cooked a little longer.  To those who thought it was a lot of clean up, I did not.  Yes...several containers were used but while chops were browning I quickly washed up breading bowls.  Once in the oven I scrubbed up the pan.  Now one could really make the clean up a throw away by using paper plates for flour and bread crumbs.  Recipe was well worth the small amount of effort...simply delicious.  Will probably add sauteed mushrooms next time around.  This will undoubtably be a go to pork chop recipe for us.  Try it...you will like it.  BTW...I used a little left over Chardonnay for the wine.

This was very tasty.  I didn't have any white wine on hand so I used chicken broth, and eyeballed the spices.  It came out great!!  I did agree with the person that said it was alot of dishes to wash, but it was well worth it!

i have no idea why reviews are so high, my pork chop was tender but overcooked (go figure). and my kitchen was a disaster after using nearly every type of dish i own to clean, bread, fry, bake, soak, and serve the meat.

I followed some other people's suggestions... I only baked them for 35 minutes for the first go round and about another 20 minutes after adding the soup mixture. I also added a dollop or two of heavy whipping cream to give it some umph. It was a pretty good meal and I'll make this again sometime.

Made this recipe as outlined above and it was PERFECT!  The only thing I changed was cook time - pork chops were done in 35-40 minutes and then I added the sauce to the top and cooked for another 8-10 minutes.  My family absolutely loved it!  Definitely a keeper!

The breaded chops were good.  I did tweak the sauce, for more flavor.  By using the same pan that still had the drippings from the chops.  Used all ingredients from original recipe, just added more milk, salt, pepper, fresh mushrooms and cooked this on the stovetop for 10 minutes.  I flavored it to my taste liking.  I only baked the chops for 30 minutes before I poured the sauce over them (they were thinner chops) then continued baking for 20 minutes more.  All in all this is a good recipe.  I believe that it can be used for chicken as well.  Can't wait to try it.

I have skipped over this recipe so many times due to the very simple name.  I'm glad I decided to give it a try because it's delicious.  So easy to make and very yummy.  Luckily, I read the reviews before putting my pork chops in the oven because the hour and a half would have completely dried out my pork chops.  I put them in for 20/20 and they turned out great.

Despite all the rave reviews, I didn't care for this. I followed the recipe and included several of the popular suggestions -- more wine, well-browned, some garlic, etc. To me, this yielded breaded chops swimming in a very bland, off-tasting white sauce. That said, I think the basic idea is great but the canned soup needs to be replaced with something else.

The only change I made was I used Golden Mushroom soup and these are simply AMAZING!!!  I use bone in thick cut chops.  I've shared this recipe with friends and it's become a favorite amongst all of us.  Thanks for sharing!!

Alright,evil cook that I am I of course made alterations I am rating 4 stars for that reason. I seasoned 2 - 1 inch bone in center cut chops with onion powder, garlic powder and seasoning salt,regular s & p, beat two eggs Dredged the chops in flour, dipped in the eggs and then in a mixture of seasoned breadcrumbs mixed with panko 

Fried the chops in 1 inch of canola and 4 turns of olive oil Sliced 1/3 of a sweet vidalia onion, 8 oz of fresh mushrooms (canned,ew) and chopped 2-3 cloves of garlic and sauteed til caramelized

Chops baking away at 350 I get out 2 cans of cr. of mushroom soup, poured in whole milk to the consistency I prefer, then added some white wine. Seasoned the sauce with some s&p, added the sauteed veggies

At 25 minutes I decided against my better judgement that I would add the sauce However, I only spooned on about 1/3 cup to each chop, with a hefty amount of the mushrooms and onions. Decided I didn't want to drown the chops. Cooked another 20 minutes

OK SEASON SEASON SEASON! I used more than the original recipe called for on only two chops I added salt and pepper, garlic, onions, fresh mushrooms, and it just lacked that finish!

 I would add 10 - 15 minutes to the cooking time, perhaps 35 then add sauce and cook an additional 15 or a bit more. These were moist and tender, my only complaint is with the breading, you need to season like crazy, the gravy/sauce as written would be like a paste without what I added and still that was not enough.

This was my first time making this, and it was easy and the meat came out SUPER SOFT and cooked perfect. All that despite me messing up and mixing recipes. I used veg oil instead of olive, forgot to cover with foil in the oven, added a 10ish drops Worcestershire sauce (don't know if it was enough to make a difference), and double breaded the chops (and I used 3 big ones not 6). Also used 1 can mushroom with roasted garlic soup, and poultry and italian seasoning for the marinade. As with any recipe, you can play around with flavors, which I will next time, but frying until brown and then at least 45 mins in the oven cooks the meat perfect. Thanks!

DELICIOUS!  I used Cream of Mushroom soup w/garlic in it.  I also substituted heavy whipping cream in place of the milk -- MMmm.  So rich!  The only thing I would change is probably to add the gravy to the top after the chops were done so the breaded portion doesn't get too soggy.  I heated it up on the stove top with the drippings from the fried chops -- artery clogger I'm sure, but so yummy as well :-) I made some wild rice & green beans for the side which paired so well with the taste of the gravy.

Great recipe!  This recipe make the chops supper tender.  The only suggestion would be to fry the chops until they are extra extra crispy, otherwise the breading gets soggy when baking. I also took note from another reviewer and added more spices & garlic to the sauce so it didn't just taste like crm of mushrm.  I will definitely make these again!

The recipe was wonderful. I had to substitute plain bread crumbs for italian style. And had to omit the olive oil and while wine completely because I was out of it. Instead of garlic powder I used freshed garlic and onions in the frying pan. My family and I loved it, even my extremely picky 3 year old. Definitely will be making again.

My chops were a little tough - probably the cut.  Good flavor.  Will try again - maybe cook lower and longer.

These were great pork chops! I chicken broth instead of white wine because that's what I had and I also increased the soup to 2 cans to make more sauce. I decreased the cooking time to 15 minutes (covered) and then poured the sauce on and cooked for another 15 minutes (covered). They came out perfect and my family loved them! Thanks!!!

This was a great Pork Chop Recipe.  I think I probably would've given it 5 stars had I made it with the Cr of Mushroom soup but my husband doesn't like Mushrooms so I made it with Cr of Celery.  He LOVED it and asked me to add it to my Pork Recipe Box!

So tender and delicious!  I made a couple changes...Doubled the sauce since I love dipping veggies and mashed potatoes.  I ommited the flour (only dipped in beaten egg and covered with Italian bread crumbs).  Fried the meat until nice and brown.  In another pan, I melted a tbsp. garlic butter, added fresh mushrooms & french shallots and added that to the sauce.  Cant say how delicious it was.  Amazing recipe!

Did not like this! I followed the recipe exactly. I used the really thick center-cut pork chops from Costco. They turned out dry and waaayyy overcooked. I should have known better when I saw that the cream of mushroom soup. Yuck. This was fairly labor-intensive. It would have been worth the time if the sauce was fresh, flavorful and delicious. I think it could have been really good if it was cooked for a shorter time, and if I has skipped the canned soup. This is the first negative review I have ever left, I am usually not picky! I just wanted to leave my experience to help counter all of the glowing reviews. Sorry bdld, nothing personal.

This was delish! DH said it was one of the best things I've ever made :) .. I followed the recipe, other than I baked the chops @ 350 for 45 min, and cooked the crm of mushroom soup, 3/4 can milk, canned mushrooms, & garlic on the stove top. The when the chops were done I just poured the gravy over top!! Great recipe, thank you so much!

Part way through preparation, I began thinking that I was wasting my pork chops on a bad recipe.  Man was I wrong!  These are soooo delicious.  My family loved them.  Perfect combination.  The white wine really closed the deal.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe that I've made as is several times now.  I've used boneless chops and bone in chops and both work great.  I'm not a big wine drinker so we typically just buy the screwtop cheap white wine for the recipe and it seems to work great.  I have recommended this recipe to family and friends.

I have made this recipe MANY times in our house...and always forget to leave a review. Recipe is fantastic...especially with a coupld of adjustments as others have mentioned. Use 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can of golden mushroom, instead of milk- I use heavy whipping cream, and then I add a little extra wine.

This dish was good, but the baking time is too long.  Pork was done after 35 minutes.  Used golden mushroom soup and it turned out great.  The breading does get soggy but this is the intention. Next time I think I'll skip the breading and just coat the pork in seasoning and bake.  I wasn't a big fan of the soggy breading but the flavor was excellent!

This was my first dish from Allrecipes.com and it turned out quite well.  My wife said it was delicious, I thought maybe she didn't want to hurt my feelings plus maybe she's tired of cooking every meal.  Anyway when my daughter ate it and then ate the leftovers the next day I knew it was really great.  So thumbs up to a great recipe that anyone can do!

Yum! These turned out great!! Mine browned up fast, so make sure you keep a close eye on them. Also, I only baked for 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after adding the sauce.

These were fantastic! They were also delicious--not too time consuming and/or stressful.  I know I  can make these with ease for a quiet night with the hubby (who LOVED them) or a evening with my in-laws.  Thanks for submitting!

This recipe is just simply amazing. It's so easy to prepare. I also was out of time and cut the cooking time to 1 hr total (30 mins before I added the sauce and 30 mins after). It turned out perfect and delicious. I also took the previous reviewers' advice and added sauteed mushrooms, a can of golden mushroom and a little bit of vermouth to the sauce. You won't be disappointed.

I just made this last night and it was a hit! My bf was skeptical about the pork chops when I told him I was going to make it. After the first bite, he turned to me and jumped in exclaimed that it was delicious. He raved about it and said this was a recipe to keep and make again. He said it was moist and flavorful.   So when I made this recipe, I used thin cut pork chops. I would suggest lightly season it with the garlic powder and seasoning salt or use low sodium mushroom soup if you're going to do thin cut. It was a little salty for my taste but because I served it over rice, it evened out. I did as another reviewer suggested and sauteed onions and smashed garlic into the soup base for more flavor. I tossed in a little more wine as well. I browned the pork chops for about 3-4 minutes each side and put it in the oven for 18 minutes and then another 18 minutes with the soup base. It was perfect!

This was excellent! I added carmelized onions to the sauce and they were great! I only wish I had fresh mushrooms too.  I, like others, found I didn't need to fry the chops for as long as the recipe called for, I stopped when they were golden brown.  I also added a little Worcestershire sauce to the gravy.

I usually don't follow a recipe exactly, but the only thing I changed was the olive oil to vegetable oil & I wouldn't change anything else about this recipe! It was delicious! (I really dislike mushrooms too, and I still loved it) I will definitely make this again soon.

These pork chops were wonderful! I followed the receipe EXACTLY and the meat was so tender, it practically fell apart with the fork. My husband thought this dish was so good he told me to put this on the list of what to make again real soon! I agree with one person that there were a lot of dishes to clean up, but it really isn't that bad if you clean while the pork chops are cooking in the oven. I also wish that I made a double batch because there wasn't any leftovers between my hungry husband and myself!

Made this for my boyfriend who loves pork chops, but hates mushrooms.  I followed the directions & he loved it & asked to have it again.  I did remove the mushrooms after cooking (I just ate them), but the flavor sang through.  Great recipe!!!

I've made this numerous times and it's PERFECT... but I've substituted cream of celery or other similar soup for the mushroom soup and eliminated the wine and milk (a non-mushroom, non-wine person here) BUT added the following instead of the milk and wine:  1 package of dry pork gravy mix made according to package directions.  I use Pioneer Brand Roast Pork Gravy Mix, which makes 2 delicious cups of gravy.  Add the gravy with the soup (blend until smooth before adding to pork chops) instead of milk and wine   for the last 30 min.  AND BE SURE TO GET YOUR CHOPS GOLDEN BROWN/CRISP in Step 2 of the original recipe.  EXCELLENT!

Made this for dinner last night - thought it was fabulous.  I had purchased pork chops not knowing what I would make, looked up recipes, and this looked the best - plus, I could make it with ingredients on hand!  I cut the cooking time down to 20 minutes before sauce/20 minutes after sauce.  Only used a bit of sauce during the baking process, heated up the sauce in a pan, and used the rest for those who like sauce (some in my family don't).  Also, I only had cream of chicken soup, so used this, and added a clove of garlic (crushed) to kick up the flavor a bit, plus an extra dash of wine.  Will definitely be making this again!

I baked these for my parents and they loved it! The great part about it was just how tender and moist the pork chops turned out. The sauce I thought was a little heavy for my taste but that could have been balanced with a really tangy or sweet salad. Great recipe.

This was very tasty...will definitely make again.  I did change it up just a bit.  I was out of bread crumbs so ground up some grape nuts cereal and it worked great.  Also added fresh sliced mushrooms to sauce.  I had the thin pork chops so cut the cooking time in half and it turned out perfect.  I also added about a teaspoon of garlic powder and pepper to the flour.

I used campbell's cream of chicken AND mushroom soup,   not being a big fan of mushrooms. Also used Stone Hill Golden Rhine white wine and it came out amazing! I used the gravy measurements but made only three pork chops, there was plenty of gravy for the pork chops and mashed potatoes (the garlic red potatoe recipe on here). My man, who hates wine and is not a fan of mushrooms LOVED it! I, myself, who dislike pork, was very impressed.

Great flavor! I made it gluten-free by making and using a gluten-free condensed chicken soup. I also used plain bread crumbs and seasoned with oregano and thyme. I was using only two pork chops, so I cut the cooking time to 30 minutes without sauce and then 30 minutes with sauce. I also scaled the seasonings accordingly for two serving. Served with white rice and roasted butternut squash.

Followed the recipe completely. I was disappointed at the mushy texture. IF I try it again, I am going to read others' suggestions and try their version of it.

Thought this was just ok. The wine saved it. It seemed a little bland. I took one reviewers suggestion and tried golden mushroom soup and it turned the gravy into a funky yellow color. The chopps turned a bit chewy too. Maybe I just did something wrong.

OMG, these were delicious!! I used 4 pork chops cooking them only about 3 minutes per side and then put them in the oven. I used cream of chicken soup instead and increased the wine to 1/2 cup. I too only baked them for 30 minutes and then 30 more minutes with the sauce. I don't normally care that much for pork chops but these bring them to a whole new level. I will definitely be making them again. Thank you for posting this recipe and giving me a wonderful way to enjoy pork chops!

I have made these twice in a week, they are so delicious!  Instead of using wine in the sauce, I mix a 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup with a small can of mushroom steak sauce and chicken broth.  Absolutely delicious!

These are fabulous. Usually chops and chicken are bathed in condensed soup because they get so dry. By breading these and searing them they stay so moist! I sprinkle each side with seasoned salt and garlic powder before breading. Then, I sear them in my cast iron skillet so I can just move the whole works straight into the oven. I also like the outside crisp, so I keep the gravy separate. I bake the chops for an hour and cover with gravy just before eating. These are fabulous!!!!!

my family loves gravy, so I used 1 1/2 cans of cream of mushroom, 1 can of golden mushroom, and chicken broth instead of the wine.  I also added some mushrooms and green onions. I took the suggestion to bake it for 45/30 and they turned out perfect

These were good.  I enjoyed the gravy.  I sauteed some onion and garlic then added fresh mushrooms and added one can golden mushroom and one can cream of chicken and mushroom.  To this I added a splash of milk and some chicken broth.  The pork chops I had were not very tender but the taste was pleasant.  I browned well and baked for 30 minutes without sauce then about 20 with sauce.  I have a feeling it might have been the type of chop I used.  I'm going to try this again with a different cut.  And even though they were a little dried out I think I'll bake them in the sauce longer (in the hopes that it eventally tenderizes the meat).  Also I used crushed stove top as my breading and I really enjoyed it.

This was definitely tasty.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than use less chops but keep the sauce level the same.  I did warm the sauce first but not sure if that mattered or not.  I've made a different mushroom soup/chop recipe before that was very good but my husband said he liked this better.  And he's picky!

I did the recipe to the exact amount and I have got to say it was one of the best pork chop recipes I've had! After my b/f had it he told me it was the best pork chops he's ever had and he's not really a fan of pork chops.  Oh and I used Chardonnay for wine.  Delicious! will def make again :)

Absolutely wonderful. I added creole seasoning instead of seasoning salt and made my own bread crumbs. I pan fried the pork chops in extra virgin olive oil which gave a nice flavor. And with my gravy I deglazed the same pan I used to pan fry the pork with the wine and turned it on low to simmer some onions and asparagus. Then added fat free cream of mushroom and milk.. OH MY.. So good!! With organic brown rice and a nice green salad. Beautiful dinner!

Loved this! I'm not great cooking pork and this recipe was easy and great. I'm not sure if the cooking times in the recipe were for thick chops but I followed the suggested cooking times of 20 mins covered and 10 mins uncovered. I also deglazed the pan with the wine and heated the gravy in the pan. Thanks for sharing!

This was the recipe I went with for my first attempt at  pork chops. I made the mistake of seasoning the pork chops with seasoned salt AND adding the seasoned salt to my bread crumbs. They were really salty, but that was my mistake. The chops were still juicy.  For my next go around, I followed the directions to a T, and they were delicious! This will probably be a dish I'll make once a month. Thank you for sharing!

Not generally a big fan of pork chops, but these were great! I did customize the recipe by reading others reviews and I think that helped. I used some think cut bone in pork chops seasoned with creole seasoning and garlic powder. Breaded according to directions and pan fried. Like others have said it is really important to get a nice browning on the breading. I then put my chops in the oven and started on the sauce. I sauteed onions, garlic and fresh mushrooms in the pan I fried the chops in to get all the tasty bibbets. I added some pinot grigio to deglaze the pan. Then add a can of golden mushroom and cream of mushroom along with the milk and let simmer on the stove top. I believe the golden mushroom soup was a must because it gave more flavor then just plan old cream of mushroom. Seasoned the sauce with some more creole seasoning for a little extra kick. Took the chops out of the oven after 40 min. and put the sauce on top and served. YUMMY! Didn't need to add sauce to the chops and bake again. I would have lost that crunch that I like so much. This is a great sauce that I bet would be good on pan fried chicken breast too. Will 100% make again. Thanks for a great base recipe as well as all the great tips in the reviews.

These were really really good.  I had to improvise due to lack of ingredients.  I didnt  have seasoning salt, so I used a garlic & pepper salt thing, and I didnt have Italian bread crumbs so I crushed some Italian-y type croutons and mixed with crushed soda crackers.  Oh, and I only had a pork butt roast, so I sliced it while it was still a little bit frozen.  (not sure where the chops come from but this worked great)  Will keep this in the rotation.  Thank you for sharing!

These Pork chops are VERY good.I added cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom..we do not like mushrooms and i mixed the soup with milk only,no white wine..only because it smelled funny and didnt think my family would like it - could have been the wine that i used. I plan on making these again,my very picky 9 year old son asked for a second helping!!! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

My son loved this!  I followed Jillian's advice and double dipped the chops and baked instead of fried. I used Campell's muchroom and garlic soup and used chicken broth instead of wine.  I sauteed mushrooms, onion and garlic and added that to the soup mixture. This turned out so good.  Served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli. YUM!

As a recovering vegetarian, I have been sticking to mostly poultry.  This was my first experience with pork in about 10 years.  So, take my comments with a grain of salt.  I followed the recipe exactly and found that it was really salty.  But it could just be me since my husband, an avid meat eater, thoroughly enjoyed it.

I got home last night to make this and found I didn't have everything for the sauce.  I went ahead and made the pork chops without the sauce.  I followed the recipe until I got to the breadcrumbs. I only had about half the breadcrumbs I needed. I spotted some cornmeal on the shelf and decided to use that with the breadcrumbs.  I used tenderized pork chops and sauted(sp?) them in veg oil until the breadcrumbs were golden brown then baked covered in the oven for 30 minutes.  They were great!!  Very tender and moist. I made real mashed potatoes with brown gravy. The next time I make these I will make sure I have everything for the sauce because I think that will make it even better.  I am giving this recipe 4 stars even though I didn't follow the recipe to the letter.  The baking method alone makes it worth the 4 stars.

This was VERY good!! One of the best recipes I've made on this site by far!  The only thing I did different was add milk for the wine and they turned out hardy and FULL of flavor!  Will make again soon!  And, I think I'm going to try chicken!

This was awesome. The juiciest pork chop I have ever had. The only thing I did different is 1): instead of using Italian bread crumbs, I used Italian croutons smashed up because my BF got the croutons instead of bread crumbs. That is men for ya lol.  2): I added sauteed red onions the the mushroom soup mix. And I only used 4 pork chops. It was great. Will definitely make this again.

Overall, they tasted all right... salty though... I used boneless cuts and they were very tender. I only baked mine an hour, and most of the "Gravy" had stuck to the bottom of the pan. I added another can of mushroom soup with water, and used a whisk to scrap the pan bottom --Gravy (while salty) was AWESOME! Will make again, but had a horrific appearance (we personally dont care) and the salt content was enough to make my arteries tremble... but arent those types of recipes the best out there?

Awesome!  The chops were so moist and juicy!  I followed other people's suggestions and used golden mushroom soup along with the cream of mushroom soup.  It was a lot of work but worth every minute of it!

Heck yes! This is what pork chops are supposed to be like. I've been so tired of eating dry, tough meat that's hard to chew. This recipe is moist and delicious You practically don't even need a knife!

These were pretty good!  To avoid over-softening, I opted to just bake these w/o the sauce and serve the sauce over the pork chops and mashed potatoes.  It was good - a little thick, but good.  May want to add a bit more milk to thin it down.  Otherwise, a keeper and will be a go-to pork chop recipe in our house from now on.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this tonight for the first time.  I made it exactly as the recipe said to except instead of measuring out the garlic powder and seasoning salt I just sprinkled those onto the pork chops straight out of their containers.  My whole family really liked the pork chops.  Even my very picky kids liked it.  I was a little worried about the length of cooking time in the oven because the pork chops that I used were boneless and thin.  However I followed the exact amount of cooking time of 1 and a 1/2 hours and I was surprised to find that the pork chops came out very tender.  I cut them with my fork.  No knife needed.  The sauce was good.  This is exactly the kind of pork chop recipe I've been looking for.

Excellent recipe!  We are having a bit of a heat wave in WNY so I changed it up a little this time. I fried in pan but instead of baking in the oven, I put them in the crockpot for 6 hrs on low. They came out fabulous and even more tender than the oven method which I had done previously.  I served over white rice. The gravy this makes is delicious!

My family loved this.  I used boneless chops.  I also only baked for 30 minutes total and heated the gravy in the microwave and then poured on the last 10 minutes of baking.  I added a little beef bouillon granules to the gravy to give it some flavor and color.  The coating loses its crispness when baking with foil on it.  That didn't bother us any.  This would be great for company since it looks and smells wonderful.

Delicious x100000! My hubby who doesn't eat porkchops couldn't get enough. I let the oil get hot in the pan first and then fried it on both sides until I thought it was good enough. For the breadcrumbs I just used what I had on hand which was Soda crackers which I added garlic powder and paprika to. I then cooked in oven as directed while I simmered the wine, mushroom soup and fresh mushrooms in the porkchop drippings.   Served with rice (made a nice gravy), broccoli, and a salad.   KEEPER!

Followed the recipe exactly and really enjoyed these! I've tried other decent pork chop recipes on this site, but for my personal taste palette, none are as delicious. This is a keeper for me. I tend to struggle when choosing side dishes for a recipe, so I copied the picture and made these with mashed potatoes, corn, and a salad. GREAT meal!

Unbelievably good.  I also used 1/2 can of golden mushroom and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom, lawry's seasoning, and a cheap bottle of chardonnay. I substituted wheat flour for the all purpose flour.   I used the thin chops and after browning them, I added the sauce, topped with sauted baby bellas, and only needed to bake 20 min at 400 degrees.  This is definitely a new favorite in our house!

I make this pretty often, kids and bf love them. I cook for 45 mins then 25 more with gravy and they come out perfect... any less and they will not be tender. Also double the gravy, used for mashed potatoes and came out great. I added sauteed mushrooms and green onions the gravy as well, pretty yummy :)

My husband liked the flavors but the cooking time is far too long. I baked for only 30 minutes and the chops were still overcooked and dry. Because my husband liked it I will try again but I will reduce the cooking time.   I had taken the suggestion of another reviewer of browning the chops until good and brown because I didn't want soggy mushy breading. That part was successful.

These were nice and tender, but I think I will cut the wine down some.  Just didn't seem to go too well with this, just my taste buds. This is a fairly easy recipe and made this in no time.   5 minutes for each side on med-high I found way to long, I only cooked them about 2-1/2 minutes per side and they were very crisp and nicely browned.  I had no problem with the breading falling off at all.  The trick to this is and when breading any type of food, it must dry, not damp, not wet.  After breading the food, put on a rack (cooling racking on a cookies sheet) and if possible let sit for an hour in the refrigerator.  (I only let these rest for about 30 minutes).  You will definitely see a difference in your  breaded foods.

Exceptional just the way it is!  My daughter had 3 servings.  The soup mixture would be great over noodles if you have any extra. I used a white zinfandel wine (it's what was left open from a recent family party) and it worked just fine.

The breading on my pork chops got dark and burnt almost right away when I was frying the chops. I need to try this recipe again and do something different so that doesn't happen. :(

These are fantastic!  DH doesn't eat pork chops often and said they were the BEST he's ever had!  I only needed two chops so I adjusted the ingredients accordingly.  Threw some whole grain bread in the blender for crumbs and added dried Italian seasoning.  Pinot Grigio worked very well.  Although the chops were thick, I didn't think it needed to bake an hour and a half - so after 30 minutes in the oven I added the soup mix, baked for another 30 minutes and then used a meat thermometer - it was done!

Good. Added some cayenne pepper for some kick. Next time will definitely make more sauce and maybe just heat the mushroom sauce in a saucepan and put it on top the last 15mins. of baking so it will still retain a little bit of crunch.

Loved the chops, didn't love the topping.  I was worried that I wouldn't like the topping, so cooked in oven as stated but omitted last step of adding the sauce.  Had the family taste the sauce to add to the chops at the table.  No one wanted to add the sauce.  So, will skip the sauce and keep the rest.  Thanks!

I can't figure out what all the fuss is about!  Or maybe my taste buds were just having an off day.  For the work involved (even adding cayenne pepper to the flour & sauted onions & mushroom to the sauce) I found this recipe too bland.  Also, if you fry medium sized pork chops for a total of 10 minutes, then bake them for a total of 1 1/2 hours at 350, they will have the texture of cardboard.  My boneless chops were about 3/4 inch thick, I fried for 1 to 2 minutes per side, then baked for 30 minutes, added sauce and baked for an additional 10 minutes (I nuked sauce 1st to partially heat) and that was really to long.  The chops were a bit dry and didn't "fall apart" as other reviews have said.  Sorry!  Probably will not make again.

These were very tasty.  I followed some advice of other reviewers and used sour cream instead of the milk for a better consistentcy.  Also, I used marsalla wine which gave it a nice flavor.  I substituted cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom just for a different flavor.

I have tried many recipes for pork chops, and they all failed the test of flavor and tenderness. This recipe however has past the test with flying colors! I made this more than once in the past month, my family just loves it. The left overs are gone within two days, they taste just as good warmed up as the day they were made.

I used a larger can of cream of chicken soup (this is what I had in the pantry) and added fresh mushrooms (also had it in the pantry). My kids and husband LOOOVED this and none of them are big pork lovers. I used the chops with the bone instead of boneless because I think it add more flavor. Vert tasty...

Very good.  My teenage daughter made this for the family and everyone enjoyed it.  Add a layer of provolone cheese on each pork chop for added flavor.

My 21 year old son said this was the best pork chops I've ever fixed. Made my own breadcrumbs by drying slices of white bread in the oven and putting in a small food processor. Then to make them italian, add some italian seasoning and garlic salt. I used thick chops which were super tender after cooking for 1 1/2 hours.

I love this recipe!!!! The chops tasted like I cooked them in a crock*pot for hours. My husband told me this is the best thing I made all year. The only thing I changed is I used two cans of soup one Mushroom and the other chicken herb. I made this with baked cinn. apples and cheddar pasta. Thank you for the recipe!

looked great, smelled yummy, very mixed reviews from the family. Hubby: "I just can't get over how tender these are..wow!" (throughuot entire dinner). He said 4.5 stars. 7yr old son: mom, can I have more? (fyi, he NEVER asks for more of any kind of meat). He said he would give it a 5...even asked if we had leftovers the next day...has never asked for leftovers...ever..not even mac and cheese leftovers. What did I think? blah, yucky, didn't even finish mine. If it was up to me, I'd give it 1 star and never make it again, but it seems that my boys think differently.

I made this recipe again for the second time, and made a few changes to the original recipe.  I found the meat a little bland so, this time I spiced the meat with garlic powder, some onion powder, fresh cracked pepper and a little Lawry's seasoning salt before breading the meat.  I also doubled the sauce by using 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, then doubled the amounts of milk and wine.  Since I already had a bottle of white Rhine opened in the fridge, this is what I used in the recipe (and, I'm really glad I did, since this wine added a wonderful taste and aroma to the whole dish)!  I served this with creamy mashed potatoes, cheesy brocolli, and chunky-style cinnamon applesauce. Yummy!

I just made this and used french's fried onions that I put through a food processor instead of the breadcrumbs.  I also added some thyme to the gravy and it added another level of flavor that was delicious.  I served it with mashed cauliflower and the whole thing was wonderful!  Definitely a keeper.

This one got mixed reviews at our house.  Husband loved them.  Myself and children - not so much.  I did take the advice of some other reviewers and added a little garlic powder to the gravy and I did use the cream of chicken soup along with sour cream in place of milk to thicken the gravy.  It was good just not "knock your socks off" good.

First off, this recipe is neither quick nor easy. Simple maybe, but with all the steps and dirty dishes it makes - I would not go to this as a quick and easy meal. The time involved in prep and cooking is crazy - the end result we found to be well beneath expectations.

OUT OF THIS WORLD....these were the best pork chops EVER!!!!!!  This was the 10th recipe I've made from this site and this was the best one yet!! I made them with mashed potatoes and put in a half bag of peeled baby carrots and cooked w/the potatoes and mashed altogether and used evaporated milk instead of milk to give them a richer taste w/tbsp of Lawry's season salt, butter and pepper to taste --- YUM-O!  And like another viewer said if you want extra gravy definitely double the gravy1  I also made w/frozen peas and carrots.  Excellent meal!!!

Prepared this exactly as stated in the recipe, except made my own Italian bread crumbs with a food processor, bread ends, and Italian seasoning.  Everything was at the house, was an easy recipe to make.  Leftovers were gobbled up.

I am going to start with the fact that I have never been a fan of pork chops, but, times are tough and my boyfriends mom gave us a package of them and I know that I can turn to allrecipes to help me with anything I want to make. I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and made a couple of changes. We are not mushroom fans, so I used cream of celery, and I didn't have any white wine so I filled the can of cream of celery soup 3/4 of the way with milk and added that to the gravy, which I started on the stovetop. I also seasoned the flour and bread crumbs with garlic powder and natures seasoning along with the chops themselves. There are 3 of us, so I only used 3 pork chops, and didn't change any other measurements. instead of browning on the stovetop and transferring to another pan, I used my cast iron skillet and put it into the oven after the chops were browned (why dirty an extra pan?) I didn't bake them as long either and if I had, the chops would have been dry.  My whole family enjoyed this, including myself. I may even start buying pork chops and making them this way.

I didn't want to buy an entire bottle of wine to use just 1/3 of a cup, so I substituted chicken broth. It still turned out great and was a huge hit with my family. I will definitely make this again.

This was okay.  Mine was very moist but my husband's piece was dry for some reason.  I used boneless thick-cut pork chops.  The flavor was excellent and the sauce went well over rice.

These were delicious.  I'm not a fan of cooking with wine, so I substituted with chicken stock.  They were sooo tender.  I made mashed potatoes & a veggie to go along with the chops.  I will be throwing this recipe into my regular rotation :)

This is the only way I make pork chops now.  I have also tried this same recipe with Chicken and it always turns out just as good.  I use beer instead of wine and double the soup recipe, add 1/2 of an onion soup mix and pan fry just until they are crisp.  They always turn out great.

Great recipe.  Very flavorful and pork chops stayed juicy.  I used butterfly pork chops and yielded for 2 people.  I used chardonnay and it was fine also.  1.5 hours seemed very long in the oven, especially when you don’t get home from work and start cooking until 6 pm.  I cut first oven time to 40 mins and then 20 mins with the cream of mushroom sauce and it was cooked perfectly.  Will definitely try again!

Great Flavor and moist!!!  I was not patient enough to wait an hour to add the mushroom sauce so I added after 30 minutes.  Not sure if it would have turned out any different but either way...it was delicious!

So easy, and surprisingly good!  I didn't think that they would be THIS amazing, but they really are.  They were so tender that I didn't even need a knife to cut into them.  Only thing I would change is add a splash more wine and maybe double the sauce since I like it on my rice as well.  Love easy, delicious recipes!  I will make this at least three times a month!

This was very good - even with changes.  I followed other reviewers advice and also used a can of golden mushroom.  I inadvertantly mixed up 2 recipes (garlic mashed potatoes) and threw in 2 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic - still excellent if you like garlic!  I also followed the advice of not adding the gravy.  I left it in the saucepan to drizzle afterwards on chops and potatoes.  Will definitely make this again.

Eh....I didn't care for the sauce.  It tasted too processed and the wine just didn't match the cream of mushroom taste.  It was just strange tasting.  I should mention that I modified the recipe based on the suggestions of others-added golden mushroom in addition to cream of mushroom, cooked 20/35. On the plus side, the pork chops alone were very tender and nicely cooked.  Too bad, they were covered in the sauce.

Way better than I expected. I didn't use wine (used a bit more milk) and I cooked 4 chops instead of 6. Awesome. I'll definitely be making this again.

I saw the rating on this one and though t this would be great to try..... my husband took one bite and looked at me with those eyes that said"please dont make me eat this." I then tasted it and grabbed hold of his dish told him he didnt have to eat it and then I stuck a frozen dinner in the oven. This was truly not good.... too much wine and the mushroom soup made it very salty.

Excellent! I cooked only about 25 minutes then 10 minutes once covered in gravy - lack of time and I knew the chops would be done. Thought it would turn out dry after cooking in oven (pre-gravy) but it was moist and very tasty. I was surprised to see that the soup I had was actually cream of broccoli. So instead I used what I had and made gravy from the Liptons Beefy Onion soup mix, then added in the white cooking wine. It's a keeper!

If 5 stars are "the best" then 3 stars must be "good".  This is a good, solid, comfort food recipe.  I used two 2" thick boneless pork chops.  After reading comments about bland pork and because of their size (9oz ea), I used the full teaspoon of both garlic powder and season salt on my chops before flouring them. I fried them for just 2-3 minutes per side, top, bottom, and all around to avoid burning them.  My pan was smoking hot at medium-high.  I used a 7x11 dish and the gravy reached about halfway up the sides of the chops.  I followed the recipe with these adjustments:  For the gravy,I doubled the wine to 2/3 cup, added 1/2 tsp pepper, and mixed in 1 sauteed sliced onion.  I baked the chops just 20 minutes, added the sauce and baked for another 30 minutes with the foil and then 20 minutes more without the foil because the sauce was looking thin. The end result was tender pork chops that still had good texture and a sauce that needs tweaking.  Most of the flavor came from the breading on the chops.  Next time I'll try using golden mushroom soup, add sauteed mushrooms, and omit the milk to see if that helps. My husband liked it and I'm adding this recipe to our comfort food rotation.

This is a great recipe.  I renamed it Stroganoff Pork Chops because it is a lot like the stroganoff sauce you make with beef.  Be careful not to use a dry white wine like sherry because the wine flavor can be too strong.  I've made it with Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio and like the flavors much better.  Thanks for adding another recipe to my box!

The entire famly enjoyed this recipe so it is a keeper!  I adjust the cooking time because my chops were maybe 1/2 inch thick and I thought 1 and 1/2 hours of cooking was just to long.  Baked for 30 minutes then add the mushrooms gravy then another 30 minutes of baking time.  Turned out perfect.

Came out wonderfully moist!  Had a bit of trouble keeping the breading on the pork like some reviewers when it came out of the oven.  I added some onions to the bake and served the dish with rice and roasted veges on the side with some of the sauce poured right on top.  I also subbed the wine with extra milk.

PHENOMENAL!  Definitely double the cream of mushroom and be sure to brown the pork chops until they are very crispy before sticking in the oven.  Taste was delicious with the garlic powder and seasoned salt!!

Followed recipe exact and found that the breading on the pork chops was a little soggy when finished.  I fried them golden brown, and they looked so good before baking....I was a little disappointed about the soggy breading.  The sauce was very tasty though.  Next time I think I will cut the bake time to 20 minutes with the sauce covering chops with an attempt for less soggy breading.  My husband really liked the chops so I will definitely try the recipe again.

I totally screwed up this recipe and it still turned out great. I didn't dredge in flour first and I forgot the seasoned salt and garlic. My wife hates cream of mushroom soup but she loved this sauce and it made a terrific gravy.  Excellent recipe! This is my second review: We discovered that the reason this recipe was so good the first time was because I forgot the seasoned salt and garlic. We remembered it the second time we made it and ended up throwing out the leftovers! Do yourself a favor and at least leave out the seasoned salt.

Excellent recipe!  Followed to the letter except used chick stock instead of wine b/c didn't have any.  Made really thick chops super moist, definitely a keeper!

This was by far the best recipe I have found for cooking pork chops I rarely make them because they end up dry and all wrong, To this recipe the only thing I had to do different was use cream of celery soup all I had on hand, another thing i think is that these would have been fantastic even with just frying them the flavor was wonderful, will deffinetly make this one again

My family really enjoyed this, including my picky 5 year old. I rubbed the chops with the garlic and salt before dipping in the egg. I fried it until good and brown, then I baked for 20 minutes covered, added the soup and baked for 15 more minutes (still covered)then I took off the foil and baked 10 minutes more. Came out very tender. I used center cut boneless pork chops. What a great recipe. It will be great on a cold winter night.

I did double bread with the bread crumbs seasoned with a garlic blend instead of using flour and italian seasoned crumbs. I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of cooking sherry.  I also had a thin cut chop so it didn't take near that amount of time to cook after searing them. (30/30 cooking times)

I loved the recipe!  I only salted the flour and didn't use the breadcrumbs because my kids won't eat anything breaded.  Made sure the pan was nice and hot and cooked 5 min on each side.  Cut the oven cooking time down a bit because I preheated to 375 by mistake.  I put the mushroom soup in the pan that I used to sautee the chops in, that way I got all the good crispy bits in the sauce.  Used 1/4 cup white wine and 1/4 cup sherry with the milk.  I just love the way sherry adds so much flavor!  Anyway, I will be making this easy and delicious recipe again!  Thanks for posting it!

These pork chops were PHENOMENAL!!! I used crushed up fried onions instead of bread crumbs. I only cooked them in the olive oil 3 min per side because they were browning fast, then I baked them for 20 minutes without the sauce, 40 minutes with. I also used skim milk and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, and they were amazing, fell right off the bone! I served them over basmati rice. I will definately be making these again!!!

These were great.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I put the extra sauce over couscous and my family loved it.  I only baked them for about an hour total though - so keep an eye on them so they don't dry out.

I have never liked pork chops, but decided to make this recipe for dinner the other night. It was amazing. I only used 2 pork chops, but made the gravy according to the 6 serving recipe instructions. I didn't cook for quite as long as the recipe called for, more like 35 minutes for just the meat, and another 25 minutes or so with the gravy. It turned out great. We added an extra splash of white wine, which was the best part of the dish. I'll be making this again soon, It was so moist and tasty!!

My family likes pork chops, but I've never found a recipe we all like...until now. I bought top loin chops and they were quiet thick. I was a bit surprised at the cooking time, but followed the driections, and had dry chops. I will make this again for sure, just adjust the cook time accordingly. Maybe 45 mins. vs. 90.  Thanks for the yummy dinner!

Are you kidding me?  This is so awesome!  My boyfriend was late arriving with the wine, so I went ahead without it (We drank it instead.), but I will definitely use it next time.  I don't even like pork chops!  Fork tender and so very tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

With some slight modifications, this has become one of my most requested dishes. I sauteed some mushrooms and added to the sauce. I also added a can of golden mushroom soup, extra splashes of milk and wine, and a couple pinches of red pepper flakes. Otherwise followed the recipe and it was tasty, fork-tender, and the sauce is great with mashed potatoes.

Cut the recipe to 2 pork chops but used a whole can of cream of mushroom. Meat was so tender that we almost didn't need a knife. The only thing that lacked for my taste , was the gravy. Next time i'll try it with the onions and mushrooms or make my own cream of mushroom soup...

I didn't see the point in the egg and bread crumbs, so I skipped that part.  I added my seasonings to the flour before dredging them.  I cooked them a big longer in the frying pan, maybe 10 minutes on each side.  (I had very thick chops.)  I covered and baked them, not as long as the recipe called for, and made the sauce on the stovetop.  To be honest, the sauce made with plain old cream of mushroom soup was bland as could be.  The wine didn't do a thing for it.  Would pouring it over the chops and baking that last 30 minutes make a difference in the flavor of the sauce?  I don't know.  I liked the chops well enough on their own to make them again this way, though.

OK... I am not a big fan of dishes with "mushroom soup".. but this one was really good.. a little more time consuming than I expected (watch out you don't burn the chops.. I think frying them for 5 mins each side may be a bit too long!) I used Campbell's "Golden Mushroom" which was all I had.. and added some fresh mushrooms to the mixture (after chops had baked for an hour)and poured it over the baked pork chops. Served with another All recipes favorite "Garlic Asparagus with Lime" and a baked potato... and even my 7 year old was happy!

This was EXCELLENT. MY husband had to force himself from the table to stop eating it. I doubled the recipe so he can take some to work for lunch...boy was he happy to see that! I think I will try this with Boneless Chicken next time....sauce had a great flavor! Definitely a keeper and one that would be a great dinner for guests.

Well I gave this recipe 3 stars although I thought is was pretty bad, my husband really liked it.  My kids didn't like it at all, thought the breading was too soggy, and it was way too salty. I am at a total loss as to how this recipe got such high ratings.  I make just about everything from scratch, and consider myself an advanced cook, so that may be part of it. I just dont know. I may give it another shot with the recommendations of some of the other posters.

This was very, very good.  The wine really cut the flavour of soup and made a nice sauce to go over our pasta.  We'll be making it again for sure.

Wow!  Simple and fabulous. My husband and son were blown away.  I had to use cream of Celery and sustiture Cooking Sherrry for the wine.  I'm sure the original ingredients are delicious, too. Moist and tender pork chops. What a treat.

What a great recipe! Changes that I had to make in order to accommodate to my family's tastes and available ingredients: I used 1/4 cup italian breadcrumbs and 1 3/4 cups of crushed ritz crackers (only because I ran out of the italian breadcrumbs) and the breading tasted so buttery and delicious! I seasoned the pork chops with Lawry's seasoning salt, fresh cracked black pepper, onion and garlic powder. I also added 1 tbsp rubbed sage, one crushed garlic clove and fresh cracked pepper to the sauce. I only baked 30/30 minutes and the pork chops were perfectly tender and oh so juicy. We served them over white rice & steamed broccoli/cauliflower. Such a comforting and filling dinner. Thank you for this recipe, I plan on making this over and over again.

I loved this recipe.  It was so easy.  I don't like mushrooms, so used Cream of Chicken soup instead and made with mashed potatoes and gravy.  Yum!

Wow.. These pork chops are yummo! I didn't have breadcrumbs so I just stopped with the flour and I didn't have to cook mine but 45 minutes the first time and 20 minutes the second time. But holy mackerel I will be making these over and over again. These along with the sage pork chops from this site are my go to pork recipes from now on.

Doesn't need another 5 star review, but I felt compelled to address the sogginess issue of the pork chops. You fry them to keep the juices in. It seals the pork chops. Of course they won't be crunchy...no matter how long you fry it...sitting in a gravy. It will be soft. Anyway....Very tasty. just added mushrooms. Delish!

My husband and family friend stated these were the best pork chops I ever made and that they ever tasted - quite the compliment to the recipe! 
I used a Tastefully Simple Bistro Portabella soup mix (mixed with 3 cups water and one cup of sourcream) instead of the golden mushroom soup. I also took plain bread crumbs and seasoned them myself with basil, parsley, garlic, onion, pepper, and a dash of salt. 
I served them aside mashed potatoes. The pork chops were so tender we could cut them with a fork. 
After reading some reviews I did lay out a plan for clean up and handling the mess so it was pretty simple and kept to a minimum.
I will reccomend this recipe to all my friends and family - fairly simple using basic ingredients and very tasty.

Although there were a lot of steps to this recipe, it was worth it.  I was pleasantly surprised at how moist and tender the chops came out.  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

These were incredibly tender! My chops were a little thin, so I only baked them for a half hour before pouring the mushroom sauce over them.  The smell was intoxicating!  The flavor, however, was bland.  I could smell but not taste the wine.  I might try substituting more wine for the milk.  When it was all said and done, however, my family all voted to stick with my doctored up version of Oven Fry the next time!

Wow, this was great. Hubby, the baby and I scarfed it down. I only had 4 pork chops, but I thought that was the perfect amount of chops for the amount of sauce. I actually used around a cup of wine and deglazed the pan that I fried the chops in. I let the wine reduce a bit before adding the milk and soup. The breading gave the chops a great flavor and helped to keep the chops incredibly tender. I only cooked my chops for a total of 40 minutes rather than and hour and a half. I served this with mashed potatoes and corn. I can't wait to eat the leftover for lunch tomorrow.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now (it's a favorite of my husband's). It's definitely become a staple in our household and with very few modifications, although a few over the years to tweak it for us.

The first (and biggest) tweak that I do is use thin cut pork chops. This makes it SO MUCH faster of a recipe. For the cook times I only do 15 minutes at a time (with thin cut pork chops, mind you) -- so 15 minutes, then add cream of mushroom/milk topping, then another 15 minutes. Works out great for us, so delicious!

The only other change I've made over the years is adding only half a can of milk. So pour the cream of mushroom into a bowl and then pour the milk into the cream of mushroom can about halfway. This makes the sauce a little bit thicker and we like that.

Overall this is a great recipe. We've never made it with anything other than the thin cut pork chops, so it is a fairly quick and easy meal for us on weeknights. Served with corn on the cob, green beans (or better yet green bean casserole) and it's perfect.

I made this as the recipe stated, but I usually sample the gravies/sauces to see how they are, prior to serving.  I really needed to doctor this up, because it was very bland.  Before serving, I added extra garlic and steak seasoning and a half cup more wine.  Otherwise it was way too dull.  Once I jazzed it up, I got "Great" responses on the chops.  I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe for chops, this one didn't quite cut it.

Now I've made this recipe twice. The first time I said I'd never make it again. Well, I made it again (or actually my husband made it) He followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderful! Now this recipe is a keeper. I'm glad we tried it again.

I'm not a great cook but I know what's good and this was so tasty and tender.  I am actually making it again and thought I'd chime in.  I served with rice and Baby Carrots 'n' Broccoli recipe I found here, which I liked as well.

I made this last night and it was fantastic! I did make double the sauce so we could have some for the rice I made as a side. Next time I think I'll try some Marsala wine instead of the white wine and add some fresh mushrooms. I'm glad we have leftovers today!!!Yum.

This was so good!!  I added chicken broth instead of wine and added 1 can regular crm of mushroom and 1 can of healthy request crm of mushroom soup.  Lots of  gravy to put on the basmati rice that I made to go with it.  Awesome pork chops!!

Wonderful! This really turns out a great meal - the pork is nice and juicy, the sauce is finger-around-the-plate-licking-good and the addition of fresh mushrooms to the sauce (along with vermouth) really make it irresistible. This will definitely be added to my repetoire of meals to cook!

I hate when people alter the instructions so much, and add 1 million things, all I changed was i used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic, and since i had thinner chops than i normally get, right after i took them off the pan i covered them in some (i had 4 chops and didnt use all the sauce) in the sauce and baked for about 30 minutes. I LOVED it. It turned out great, and my chops were cooked perfect.

Holy cow... this was wonderful!  So moist we didn't need knives, and very flavorful.  I didn't have any white wine, so just increased the water.  Also, I used 1/2 breadcrumbs and 1/2 stuffing mix (which I like to use as breading sometimes for chicken and pork).  A perfect pork chop!

I made this recipe tonight. I took the advice of some other users and omitted the white wine.  In its place, I used sour cream.  I also used cream of chicken soup because I had it on hand and my family is not big on mushrooms.  Other than this, I prepared the chops as directed.  I think they would have been just as enjoyable without the "gravy", as it didn't thin to actual gravy as expected.  In any case, the chops were tender and the dish was pretty enjoyable.  However, I may try the white wine next time or I will completely skip the "gravy" and stick to the seasoned chops.  All in all, not a bad dish.

My family loved this recipe.  I made as directed with the exception of adding half a small diced onion and two large garlic cloves that I sauteed after the chops were browned. I topped the chops with half this mixture and then added the rest to the gravy. Very tender and flavorful.  (We ate them with Worcestershire sauce on the side).

***Update:  I made this yesterday exactly as the recipe calls, except for the cooking method, which I used the slow cooker, which made it even better!  After seasoning, I browned the chops, then put in slow cooker with 1 c liquid (I used broth, but next time will use 1/2 water b/c they were just a tad salty).    Cooked on low for 7 hours, then added the cream of mushroom/wine mixture, topped that with 1/2 sliced onion and some fresh mushrooms, cooked for another hour and oh my word!!!!  Delish!

This is a good recipe.  I didn't have any wine, so that may make it better.  I had to add some cayenne to give it more flavor.  I used thick chops, so the 1 1/2 hour time was just right.  They were pretty tender.  The only other way I can get pork chops this tender is all day in the crock pot.

I will have to agree with the minority that this is not an impressive recipe.  The pork chops were really dry, boring and non-flavor-filled.  We love pork chops and were really sad and disappointed with this recipe. Sorry.

Made this last night for my husband and myself for dinner.(didn' use the white wine, because it's not something I have on hand) The pork was so tender and delicious. Well worth the wait for cooking time. I will be making this again in the near future when my parents visit...I know they will love it!

These were good pork chops, but not out of this world.  For the amount of time for prep and cooking and the number of dirty dishes, I was expecting WOW results.  It just isn't worth the work, when I can make better tasting pork chops in less time and effort.

This recipe was amazing. I have never loved pork chops, but I can honestly say that I loved these. I am on weight watchers, so I made some changes to the recipe that made it more point friendly without sacrificing flavor. For the egg wash, I used 3 eggs whites instead of the 2 whole eggs. I cut the 4 tablespoons of olive oil down to one and used some Pam with that to fry the chops. I used Campbell's 98% FF cream of mushroom soup and skim milk. I cut the bread crumbs   to one cup, which was plenty to coat the chops. This recipe was truly the best. I would give it 6 stars if I could.

I'll make these again, for sure.  We wound up mixing the sauce with the rice and havnig that as a side dish...I may not make the sauce again, but this is a good basic recipe for baked pork chops!

The only change I made was using chicken broth instead of wine. I am eating as I type and this might be the best pork chop recipe I've ever tasted. I can't stop eating it. I will make this a lot.

I made this twice- the first tasted excellent, the second was a soggy mess. As others have mentioned, the thickness of the pork chop makes all the difference. The thicker the pork chop = the soggier the pork chop (due to all the excess juices escaping into the breading), which makes browning the chop on the skillet beforehand, pretty useless. 
I also prefer to make the sauce on the side, since it makes the breading soggy otherwise. All in all, a really delicious dish (when done properly, that is!).

I was doubtful I would like this... but I actually loved it as did my husband.  I followed suggestions from others & changed a few things on my own.  

1. Did a garlic/herb rub, tenderized meat
2. Dipped in egg, then flour, then egg, then bread crumbs
3. Pan fried only a few minutes, not 5, just barely golden...
4. Baked covered alone for 20 minutes
5. Then added sauce and baked an additional 30 minutes

My hubby raved about this, and loved the gravy with potatoes.  

Sauce changes I made: 
~1 can cream of mushroom
~1 can cream of chicken
~1 cup milk
~sauteed onions with mushrooms in pork  skillet w/ a little wine and butter
~Added wine to taste, maybe 1/3-1/2 cup?
~Heated up on stove

Yummy!!!  This is going on our regular rotation per request of the hubby.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!!  Contrary to other reviews, I didn't really think this was much work at all, I think I can actually make it fairly quickly the next time I make it.  Excellent!

My husband loved this recipe!!  It was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  I would definetely reccomend you watch the chops when frying them, my got dark in a matter of seconds.  Next time, I will just stick to Medium, not Med-HI.  I made this with mashed cauliflouer.  Viola!

These pork chops are great.  I have made them quite a few times since I came across the recipe.  I doubled the gravy though, so there would be enough to serve over noodles.

This was just ok for us. Hubby and I both agreed. The sauce was kind of bland and too heavy... and I really dont see the point of bothering to bread and fry and then smother in sauce that leaves the breading mushy. Giving the rave reviews the benefit of the doubt I tried it anyway... and I was not surprised when I didnt care for it as much as I had hoped. Like I said - it's just ok. Definitely not a 4 or 5 star recipe in my opinion. I really think it would be better with chicken, too. The chops were very dry despite the sauce. In any case, this wont be making it into my rotation. Sorry. It just wasnt for us.

This is a very good recipe but my family and I do not like anything cooked with wine so I always substitute the wine with chicken or beef broth.  I have used both for this recipe and both turn out very very good.

I used medium sized lean chops so I only cooked them for 20 minutes, then added sauce, then an additional 30 minutes.  They were cooked perfectly, nice and tender.  I used chicken stock in place of the wine and milk and also added a little butter/flour mixture to thicken a bit more.  I served over tri-colored rotini.  Super yummy!!

Great recipe! I listened to the advice of HOLLY9000 and it came out amazing. Almost like pork marsala. The key alterations are definitely as follows: Reduce oven time(I used boneless chops and browned them for about 3-4 mins on each side and then cooked for 20/20). Also, definitelyl add sauteed onions & mushrooms to the doubled sauce. I sauteed them right in the pork grease and added about 1/2 cup of white wine and a pat of butter during cooking - then after liquid simmered off I added them to the sauce. My husband really does not like pork and he said I could make this one any time. Thanks for the recipe!!

It was all great, nice and tender, I added some creole seasoning to everything. The only problem is that baking it with the sauce makes the breading soggy. Next time I'll pour the sauce on after I bake it. I only baked them for 30 minutes.

I thought these were good.  I made the recipe as directed, and found that the meat wasn't as tender as I'd hoped and the sauce was a little "gummy".  But the overall flavor was good, and I think next time I'll try really browning the chops in advance to seal in more of the moisture.

This is my second time cooking this recipe and as before, the family loved it. I change a couple of things the second time around. I chose to double the milk and use cream of chicken like a previous reviewer because that is what I had in the pantry. It was still a great meal and the chops, as before, came out soft and tender. Great recipe!

My husband loves these and has bragged on them so much I've had to give out the recipe 3 times already.  I doubled the sauce as suggested by others.

OH MY GOSH.... This is SOOOOO good!! I mean, it fell off my fork, it was so tender and juicy.  I altered it a little, with what I had at home.  I used cream of chicken mushroom soup, and I didn't have white wine.. so I put a little red wine in it for the taste. Also, I seasoned it with lots of garlic powder, pepper, and season salt.  I cooked the soup on the stovetop, with the milk and wine, and added a good bit of paprika and some sour cream I had in the fridge.  I added it to the pork and baked it.  I had very thin chops.. so I baked them 20 minutes alone and 20 minutes with the soup. This was so good, I can't wait to eat the leftovers.  Thank you for sharing!

Used cream of chicken (didn't have any cream of mushroom on hand); was OK but not quite what I was hoping for.  Seemed too heavy w/gravy and breading on chops.  Maybe next time I'll just avoid the gravy altogether and bake the breaded chops.

This was outstanding, and hubby agreed (and he's not a big pork chop fan!). I doubled the sauce like other reviewers and added bit of garlic powder & ground cayenne to give little kick. Also, like another reviewer, I heated the sauce on the stovetop then poured over the finished chops to serve. Note: I only needed 1C (or less) of bread crumb mixture to cover chops liberally, so you can cut back on amt of ingredients there.

SOOO good.  Made for grandma's birthday for 10 people.  Everyone raved about how good they were and how they used to eat a dish like this when they were young.  I served over rice and alongside corn.  Only baked for 30 minutes, added sauce, baked for 20 minutes, then let rest for 10 minutes, will make again,  thanks!

My husband and I LOVED this.  I used some seasoned croutons that were getting a little long in the tooth.  I ground them in the food processor, and used them instead of the breadcrumbs.  I also used bone-in pork chops, they tend to do better when you are cooking them for this length of time.  They stay nice and moist.  I also added a carton of baby bellas and 1/2 cup of onions, which I carmelized to the sauce.  We put this over rice and served with glazed carrots.  Next time I will double the sauce, so there will be plenty for the rice.

If everything I cook was this good I would weigh 500 pounds!  I never made pork chops with gravy before this one and I can't tell you how happy I am I came across this recipe.  I prepare it exactly like the recipe except I use chicken broth in place of the wine.  I tried boneless chops once, I like the center loin cut with the bone in better.

Awesome!  My husband and I both loved it!  The meat was very tender and came out perfectly.  If you don't want to use the wine, just substitute chicken broth or water with chicken bullion cubes.

I followed the recipe to the tee except I added fresh sliced mushrooms to the soup mixture, used cream of celery soup (all I had), used red cooking wine instead of white, added a little parsley and italian seasing to the soup also and some garlic pepper. Baked porkchops for 30 min and than poured soup mixture over and baked an additional 30. Turned out excellent!

Not that this recipe needs another 5 stars, but I couldn't help myself. I made this for my husband and parents and they loved this. My husband asked me after dinner when we can have this again, and my dad wants to be invited over again when we do have it !!! I did make a few changes, I added sliced muchroom and diced red pepper for color. I also used a bit more wine, and cut down a tad on the cream. I cooked as stated in the recipe and it came out perfect. Thanks for the Post, I will be making this again often :)

So yummy! The rating speaks for itself. I made only 4 pork chops, so I halved all of the ingredients except the cream of mushroom (used the whole can). I also just seasoned the flour with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Cooked for 40 min, then for 10 min. since I was paranoid of over-cooking. Very tender! Use bone-in, 1 inch thick chops!

it's good, but it's a lil bland so i had to add boullions/ stock to it, even though the pork gets juicy inside the oven.. it needs a lil kick though.. i still like the "grandma's pork chops in mushroom gravy" more.

These were AMAZING!  Whom ever said they didn't like the breading or they didn't think the wine went with the pork, you're crazy!  My husband informed me this is his new favorite meal.  The only change I made was added 1/4 cup sour cream to the soup mixture to make it a little richer.  I will definately double the sauce next time as we loved it.  Served with mashed potatos.  Will try with egg noodles next time.  You could cut the meat with a fork.  It just melted in your mouth it was so tender.  Can't say enough GREAT things about this recipe.  It's a must try!

I have had this in my recipe box for about 2 years and finally got around to trying it. I thought that it was very good. I used the Campbell's Gold Label Portabella Mushroom soup instead of the canned condensed stuff.  I mixed this along with the wine and the milk and it gave good flavor. I don't drink much wine (more of a beer girl) so I didn't want to waste a whole bottle of wine for 1/3 cup. So I bought one of those little single serving bottles and it worked out great!

This is the smothered pork chop recipe like my Grandma used to make. Delicious! I used chicken broth instead of white wine. I fixed this dish with boneless pork chops. These fell apart while dining they were sooo tender. The flavor was wonderful on this and I am not a fan of mushrooms. Next time I will double the mushroom sauce as it would have been even better had there been enough to spoon over rice or potatoes. This was a husband pleaser for sure, mine approved.

Great recipe. I used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic. I also added some chopped Shitake mushrooms and doubled the sauce. Thank you.

This is a great way to serve pork chops.  Make sure to use thicker chops and definitely double the sauce ingredients to have extra to serve over rice or potatoes.  Fresh sliced mushrooms would be a great addition. Thanks for a different way to serve pork!  We enjoyed our new dish!

Very good!  We aren't huge pork fans but this was certainly a big change over the traditional "dry" pork chops.  We will make again.

This recipe was delicious!  Although, after reading some of the reviews about the sauce being a bit bland, I added some garlic powder (about 1/2 tsp), a Tbsp of dried onion flakes, and a little bit of salt to the soup mixture before adding to chops.  I also used chicken broth instead of wine (didn't have any).  Next time, I think I'll use boneless pork chops.  This recipe is a keeper!!

I made this last night, and was very surprised how wonderful it was!!  I made it with no white wine, and just a little extra milk.  I did not have any bread crumbs on hand, so used some croutons from my pantry.  I followed others advice and made sure to really brown before baking.  I made recipe with only 4 chops but full recipe for gravy/sauce, and it was wonderful!!  I also changed baking time to 45/25--just perfect!  I am a very picky eater, and I really like my pork chops with breading, these were PERFECT tasting!! Not dry at all, and still a little crunchy/crispy---and awesome flavor!!!  Will definitely make again!!

VERY GOOD! I also sauteed fresh mushrooms and put on top with sauce. Will definetly be adding this one to family favorite! I thought the sauce amount was just right, and no need to double.

The pork chops came out very tender and delicious. I doubled the recipe sauce to spoon over noodles and I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken soup but I didn't like it too much but it was good, next time I'll use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. I'll be making these pork chops again because I was able to do some of the prep work in the morning before I left to work and my husband was able to put them in the oven and do the rest of steps of the recipe when he came home from work.

Great!  I was concerned about the length of cooking but the pork turned out moist & just fell apart.  I will try doubling sauce ingredients b/c it was very tasty but scarce.

This is the best pork chop recipe I've found so far. I followed the recipe exactly and found the sauce a little bland. Will follow others' suggestions of adding sauted mushrooms and onions, and add garlic, paprika and parsley next. Its also not a very pretty dish. It leans towards that mystery meat category. But, it was very tender, and my boyfriend at them all.

Great comfort food!  Hubby's favorite is pork chops, he could eat them every night of the week and he loved these!  Only had regular breadcrumbs so added 1 T. oregano and 1 t. basil to them.  I might start with half or so of the breadcrumbs and add more if needed next time.  Thanks for a really great recipe!

the sauce was really good but I didn't love the breading at all. next till I will still pan sear for 5 minutes on each side maybe even with bread crumbs just no flour. I only cooked 20 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered with the sauce. I also simmered the sauce before covering the chops with it.

This was great! I didn't have time to cook this for the whole hour and a half and instead cooked it for a total of 45 minutes -- 25 minutes without the sauce, 20 minutes with the sauce. The chops I used were nice and thick and were still cooked all the way through using this method. The flavors also had time to blend and season the food. I can't imagine it tasting any better had I cooked it longer. This is a keeper!

OK, I've made this dish twice now...and the coating always falls off the chops once it's baked in the sauce!  I followed exactly...so I don't know what I am doing wrong.  But the dish tastes good!  The sauce is fabulous!  I used all low-fat ingredients and it's still really good!  I think it would be good with chicken too...and I think you could do it without breading and browning the meat first.  Overall, good tasting...so I will make again!

OH, MY, GOD --- these are the few words that I can utter about the deliciousness of this dish!!! I skipped the whole soup stuff at the end and just breaded, seared, and  baked the pork chops, covered with foil. I did bake it for the time called for (about an hour) and it was tender and soooooooo good! I served mine with thinly sliced baked yams with herbs and seasonings and it was out of this world (hence, the reason why I didn't get a chance to take a picture of it and post it up because me and my husband gobbled it down so quickly)! I would recommend this recipe to anyone and can't wait to make it again for my family to try because I know they'll fall in love with it, just as I did (oh, and same with my husband).

The pork browned really quick in the skillet, so I only needed to fry them about 5 min total.   I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic (store was out of original) and the recipe still turned out great.  It was my first time baking pork chops, and I will definitely use this recipe again.

OMG! I made this last night for Valentine's dinner.. and wow! My boyfriend loved them.  I'd never made pork chops before and was wary because when I've had them they've always been awfully dry...but these turned out sooo moist.  I will absolutely be making this again. 
I only made 2 chops, but used the same amount of sauce b/c I like sauce.  I also browned some chopped crimini mushrooms and topped the chops with them before serving over brown rice.  Turned out great!!!!

DELICIOUS!  I was skeptical at first because it seems like they cook for a very long time, but I am convinced now.  These turned out melt in your mouth tender.  I left out the seasoning salt(don't care for the flavor) and just opted for regular salt.  They are soooo good and my hubby loved them.  Thanks for a keeper of a recipe.

I made this recipe for my husband who is very critical and he absolutely loved this recipe.  It is now his favorite and he must have it at least once a week.  The sauce is just delicious!  He wants me to change nothing about this recipe!  I make the recipe with thin pork chops as he likes thin better.  I just bake it for 15 minutes.  And perfect - every single time!  I can't wait to make it for guests.  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!

I made this for my husband for his birthday dinner.  He loved it!  My picky 13 year old did too! The only changes I made were I substituted chicken broth for the wine and I used herb stuffing instead of bread crumbs. I served it with mashed red potatoes and sugar snap peas.  YUM!!

Take note of the prep time - you'll be in the kitchen a while but it's worth it! These breaded, baked pork chops turn out so tender and succulent and the sauce is divine. My family begs me to make this for them and my mother who usually passes on meat dishes ate TWO of these!

This recipe was really good!  I am not big on pork chops but make them for the family.....I enjoyed this one! Took the advice of others...sprayed baking dish with Pam, worked like a charm, very easy clean up.  Didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of Chicken, came out great! Also had thinner chops so I adjusted cooking time and they turned out moist and delicious! Will difinitely make this one the next time I make pork chops.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is delicious!!!  The meat falls right off the bone.  No need for a knife.  I used cream of chicken soup because I don't like mushrooms and chicken broth instead of wine and it came out fabulous!!  My husband is from the south and he says they are just like his mom use to make which is a huge compliment coming from him.

My family always complains when I make porkchops because they are almost always tough. However, love these. I used very thin porkchops so I only baked 15 mins after frying then 15 mins with the gravy mixture. Also, I was out of cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken. The recipe came out VERY TENDER!

Very yummy -- I used a good drinking wine and had to do an emergency substitution of cream of chicken soup, but it was wonderful.  I used very large pork loin chops from Costco and the edges were perfect, and the middle was a little dry.  I think next time I will cook the chops for a total time of 1 hour, instead of 1 1/2 to compensate. 

My picky husband told me, "You can make these again...".  High praise from him!

This was a disappointment.  There wasn't much flavor and the breading turned to mush.

I had 2" boneless chops, that because I was running late after work, decided to cut in half.  Still even 1" chops are thick and one hour was perfect as so many have said.  I had to use cream of chicken and chicken broth with the milk for the sauce, but it was still just wonderful. (I skipped the flouring stage as well, but only because I forgot it.)  I look forward to trying it correctly next time to note any changes, but honestly.. it was pretty awesome like that.  Wonderfully tender, the hubby was raving about the smell long before he was moaning over the taste. ;)  Cheers!

Tried making this one last night due to over 1000 5 star reviews. Ended up with a grease fire, while trying to fry the chops, and almost burned down our apartment building. Probably won't try this one again.

my family really enjoyed these. I did skip the flour step and added fresh mushrooms just before pouring the soup mixture on top. I also did not have any wine so I used chicken broth. Yummy

The only thing I omitted was the white wine.  The flavor of the gravy/sauce was great, but quesioned why you would brown the pork chops and then bake them covered.  The wonderful breading was mush and fell off the pork chops as we cut them.  I would suggest not breading them, but maybe just browning them in oil.  I don't see the reason behind the breading.

Made these exactly as directed except substituted chicken broth for wine.  Served over egg noodles.  The sauce is delicious.  Next time I'll try adding a few fresh mushrooms to the sauce.

I had company when I made this dish and it went over gangbusters! The pork was tender and delicious. I didn't have italien style bread crumbs, but rather used regular bread crumbs and mixed in an italien seasoning. Will make again!

Very tasty. The chops come out tender and flavorful. I usually add mushrooms to the dish, and serve with white rice (with the sauce spooned on top) and steamed veggies. I've also made this with chicken and it came out just as good.

Great recipe. Make this quite often and it's a family favorite.  I use thicker chops and am generous with the garlic powder.  I also double sauce and add garlic powder and thyme and use Pinot Grigio. It turns out delicious every time. Definitely a keeper.

My market only had thin chops.  Sprinkled 7 chops generously with seasoning salt & garlic powder.  Didn't have white wine, so I used vermouth.  I mixed 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs with 1/2 cup Italian-style bread crumbs--just right for 7 thin chops.  Baked 40 minutes, then added mushroom sauce for 30 minutes.  They came out perfectly!  The sauce was so creamy, and the chops were quite tender and juicy.  Even my ULTRA picky dad liked them!  Cook time is a bit long, but easy (I don't even cook!) and delicious meal with just plain rice.  Not at all bland!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These pork chops are so good.  I added 8 oz. of sour cream to the sauce that is poured over the pork chops and it was excellent!!  The sour cream makes them delicious.

I thought this was, at best, good. did anyone else think it was  bit excessive to cook pork chops an hour and half?! i cut the time by 1/2 hour and the meat temp was well above what it should be and was still very tender. the flavor was very predictable. tasted like cream of mushroom over pork chops and it looked like it too...i even added the carmelized onion and garlic. maybe i'm just not a cream of mushroom person. my sister and friend didn't finish..nor did I. I think next time i would cut out the sauce. Save the cream of mushroom for green bean casserole...

I did everything as recommended but used chicken broth rather than water. My wife says 4.5 stars, I said 5. Easy to make and wonderful to eat. This is worth the time and effort. A definite keeper.

I read lots of reviews before making this recipe. I adjusted my baking time due to using thin pork chops. The only change that I made was adding some fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce. I worried that the pork chops would be soggy but they were not. I loved the dish and so did my family. I have always had a problem with drying out chops and these came out very tender.

I thought this would be a mediocre meal at best but was I surprised!  I saw so many 5 star reviews I had to try it myself.  I followed the recipe and maybe didn't cook-off enough of the wine thank goodness for me!  I loved it.  I shy away from using prepared soup in recipes because of the standard meals I was served as a child. This recipe is awesome.  Add parmesan cheese and a little lemon juice and serve over chicken breast!  You will not be let down!!

Excellent recipe! Very moist and chewy and the sauce is to die for! Next time I think I'll try it without the breading as it gets just a little too soggy for me. Served with fried potatoes and snappy green beans from this site.

I tried this recipe a few months ago, but living in Florida, I hesitate to use the oven in the summer months. I found that I can make this dish on the stove top, and it turns out even better! I add a couple of cloves of garlic to the oil, add chops (dredging & breading them a few hours in advance really makes the breading stay on them!)Once they are cooked, (15 minutes is fine for 1/2" chops)I remove them to a plate, tent w/foil, then add fresh sliced mushrooms, more fresh garlic, diced onion and saute. Deglaze w/wine, scrape & add cream of mushroom w/herbs & garlic soup, mixing. Let simmer til hot, throw the chops on top & serve. No hot oven! & the breading stays crunchy, at least on the top!!! :)

Great recipe IF you don't cook the meat too long. An hour and a half was enough to dry out even very thick pork chops. The flavor was great however, and have made these again with less cooking time.
Thanks Dawn!

Thank you for the best Pork Chop "Casserole Style" recipe.  This one takes a little work but your family will love the tenderness of the pork.  My younger children think they're eating chicken.  "mmmmmmmm this chicken is good Mommy, can I have more?"  My motto is, if you include "Love" in your cooking, your food will turn out truly delicious, without it the best recipes fail.

Very good and so easy.  You will have to adjust your cooking time based on the size of the chop.  The pork was moist, and the gravy was SOOO tasty.  I served it with rice.

I used very thin pork chops so only cooked 40/20.  I sauteed some mushroom slices in the pan from the pork chops when I browned them and added to the oven the last 10 minutes of cooking.  The sauce was a little too much white wine for me so next time I'll omit it or lessen it and make up for the liquid with milk. I really enjoyed the sauce over homemade mashed potatoes.  Next time I'm not sure I'll do the bread crumbs because as a lot of people said it turned mushy in the oven.  By the way- you can prepare everything ahead of time to save time.  I breaded the chops and put them in the fridge- you could even brown them and mix the soup up and leave them in the fridge until you're ready to bake it.  OK- I just made this again and substituted chix broth for the wine and skipped the bread crumbs.  It was so much better.  I served it over mashed pot. and cooked it the entire time- I used very thick bone in chops this time.  it was yummy.

This is a good recipe. The cooking time should be cut. The recipe should cook for 30 to 35 minutes and with the topping another 25 to 30 minutes. Try this and it will taste much better.

This was excellent!  We loved it.  The only changes I made were that I used 1 cup milk instead of 1/2 cup and I added a little cornstarch to thicken the mixture.  Good move.  Also, I baked the chops for 45 min and then added the gravy mixture and baked for 25 more.  I used thick pork chops.  Can't wait to make this again.

Horrible.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used extra thick pork chops and they were still dry.  The cook time is too long.  Also, the gravy was awful.  No one in my family would eat it.  We all tasted them then put them aside.

It did take a long time, but it was well worth the wait.  It was full of flavor.  The chops were sooooo tender that we didn't even use knives, we were able to cut them with forks!!  A huge success in our household, everyone loved them.  We will definitely use this recipe over and over again.

My husband & I both loved this recipe.  I do not like cooking with wine, so I used chicken broth instead.  I served it with fried potatoes and put some of the gravy over them.  Very, very good.

Oh so good. Very, very tender. The key is to brown the chops well so the breading sticks. I used three 1/2" thick center cut boneless pork loin chops and *roasted garlic* mushroom soup for added flavor. I also sautéed a small diced onion in the pan I browned the chops in, added the wine to the onions, and then the soup and milk. Later I poured the sauce on top of the chops. 30 minutes covered and 30 minutes with the sauce and covered was plenty of time. Very good!

Very good, moist and easy too. I didn't have any white wine, but I did have sparkling wine. So, I microwaved it to zap the bubbles out and it turned out great. The only thing I will cange next time is I will use barely any seasoning salt, because my chops were a little too salty.

This was a terrific recipe.  I didn't have wine, so used left over sparkling cider.  Apple juice also would have worked.  To cut calories, I trimmed all visible fat from the chops before cooking, and used low-fat cream of mushroom soup.  Rather than mixing the sauce ingredients in a bowl, I mixed them in the pan used to brown the chops.  This increased the flavor by incorporating the browned bits and pan juices.  The only thing I'd do differently in the future would be to double the sauce ingredients.  This was just so great that we would have happily used twice the gravy.  Thanks, so much, for sharing!

I made this tonight and my children were licking the pan!  I am not a mushroom fan so I used Cream of Chicken soup and it was delicious!  I also used boneless porkchops and cooked them for 30 minutes instead of an hour as suggested in an previous review.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Absolutely delicious!  I used boneless center cut pork chops so I was able to only cook this for 30 minutes instead of an hour before adding the sauce.  They turned out perfectly tender!  And I disagree with whoever said that there was too much white wine in the recipe... it was just right.

These were the best pork chops I've ever tasted!  My 7 yr. old daughter hates pork and she ate a whole chop!  The only thing I added was sauted mushrooms.  Excelent flavor and very tender.  only cooked for 30 & 30 though.  Thank you!

I tried this recipe the first time following the instructions exactly. I made the following changes the second time and it turned out much better. I suggest cooking the pork chops for no more than 1 hour so they don't dry out unless your chops are extremly thick. The gravy was very thick so I added another can of soup, greatly increased the amount of milk, and added a package of Lipton onion soup mix so the gravy was flavorful, thinner, and was enough to go on the rice.

Moist tender pork chops - what a treat!  This is a wonderful recipe.  I followed some of the other reviewer suggestions.  Topped the chops with onions and mushrooms; added lemon, sour cream, and pepper to the sauce. This is a definite keeper.

This was absolutely AWESOME!!!  My husband liked it so much he has asked for it twice since I made it the first time just 3 weeks ago!!   I also used Apple Juice in place of the white wine so I wouldn't have to open a bottle.  I also doubled the sauce so there would be plenty to serve with the chops over rice.  This is our new favorite.  Thanks so much Dawn for sharing this one!!!

This is an excellent recipe when you want an easy inexpensive dinner!!  Huge hit with my slightly picky husband.  This is definitely a keeper.  Baking time was just a little too long for thinner chops.  Cooked mine for 30 minutes, added sauce and cooked an additional 15 minutes.

I really enjoyed the taste of this sauce and I sauted sliced mushrooms to spoon over the finished product. However we never got to try them, I will definately make them again since my pan exploded when I added the sauce...What a mess! I even heated the sauce first to avoid the cold to hot thing. The pork chops were burnt on the bottom already too. My oven must be hot (new stove) next time I will cook it at a lower temp and use a metal pan. Thank goodness we live close to KFC.

This overall was a good recipe because the mushroom "sauce" really made the pork so moist and tender.  I found that I ended with better results with the soup mixture if I added a bit of lemon juice and used less milk (1/4 cup) - doing this makes the "sauce" less watered down.  I also seasoned the pork with onion powder, garlic salt and black pepper for more flavor.

Excellent!!!  The pork chops were moist and flavorful.  I used croutons instead of bread crumbs, omitted the wine and increased the milk.  I also added 1/2 package of Liptons dry onion soup mix to the roasted garlic and cream of mushroom soup.  Thanks Dawn!  PS I have yet to try a recipe on this website that has not come out fantastic.  Thanks to everyone.

always a winner at my house!  usually serve with mashed potatoes and green beans...kids and hubby gobble it up!  usually use chicken broth instead of wine (don't always have wine to spare :)) I brown the chops in an ovenproof skillet so it keeps the dishes to a minimum!

We liked this one a lot! The only thing I will do differently next time is to leave out the white wine as it seemed to add a flavor to the sauce we didn't care for. Other than that, it was delicious. Thanks!

These were okay but nothing to write home about.  The meat was nice and tender, but the sauce was extremely thin... more like a thin liquid than a gravy.  Somewhat disappointing.

Yummy!!  I will be making these again and again!  I was surprised at how easy these were to make...and how WONDERFUL they were when they came out!!  It's a pretty salty dish, so if you're not a big salt fan, I would suggest cutting down on the seasoned salt and using low-sodium broth and soup...but I personally LOVE salty food, so this was wonderful!!  My tiny roomate ate two servings in one sitting...making herself completely ill, but she said she just couldn't stop eating!  I would definitley suggest this to anyone looking for an easy, FILLING meal!

This was really good! I didn't have season salt so I just used garlic powder with a little extra salt and pepper to season the chops. I used plain bread crumbs which was fine. My chops were really huge with bones and came out quite tender. The wine gave it a really wonderful flavor. Will make again!

Very, very good.  I wasn't sure how much seasoning salt to use and I think I may have slightly overdone it...it was a little salty, but my husband that doesn't even like pork really enjoyed these pork chops.  A great recipe!

Awesome pork chops.  My husband really enjoyed them.  I served it with rice and poured the sauce over the rice.
I fried the Pork Chops the day before and put it in the fridge overnight and they were still tender and juicy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Except for having to work around bone fragments (I think that bone-in chops have much more flavor and more tender than boneless chops), my family loved this recipe.  We served it with garlic mashed potatoes and enjoyed a delicious meal!

Served it to family for dinner and got rave reviews.  Grandchildren loved it.  I will double the sauce next time as I served them with mashed potatoes and the sauce makes a very nice gravy. This is a keeper!!  Thanks Dawn.

These pork chops were absolutely wonderful!  I didn't have Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, so I just used plain and added about a Tablespoon of Italian Seasoning.  I also didn't have the wine, but the recipe was good without it.  The pork chops were so tender, they fell off the bone.  My only complaint is the breading made it hard to tell the difference between the meat and the bone!

These were the most tender pork chops I have ever had! I made them for company and they loved them too. I would recommend making more gravy, we ran a little short.

We loved these.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than I used cooking sherry instead of white wine.  Didnt want to have to go out to the store for one item.  They came out very tender, and though I was worried about the amount of cooking time, they were not dry at all.  Though I did use a thick cut boneless chop.  Thanks for the recipe Dawn!

Delicious!  The first time I made this I followed the directions as is and it was wonderful.  The only problem is my husband does not like mushrooms.  So, the next time I made it I used cream of onion soup instead of cream of mushroom - perfect!!!  This is our favorite recipe now.  I make it at least twice a month.  My 11 month old loves it also - yummy!!!!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

I followed everything in the original recipe except I shortened the cooking time by 15 min. and added paprika to the sauce. The flaver is good, but my (thick) chops are overdone and tough, so I will cut the cooking time by half.
I did this with chicken also and used sherry instead of white wine, YUM.

This was simply wonderful!!!!.  I added just a touch of parsley to the soup mixture to give it a lil taste and color and it was super.  This was easy to make, on hand ingredients and done in no time.  I served it with white rice and salad.  Thank you again Dawn

My family loved this recipe.  The only changes I made were using boneless chops, chicken bouillon instead of wine and roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup.  I also cut the cooking time down to 1 hour and found that they could cook even a little less, they were tender but a little dry....I felt that 1 1/2 hours seemed way to long to cook these...I will be making this dish again....Thank you for sharing..

Delicious!  This makes a wonderful "for company" presentation when served on rice with a spoonful of the sauce over the chop.  I made the recipe for 6 chops but only used 4.  If I made the 6 chops, I'd make more of the sauce.

Very good recipe... the chops came out nice and tender and tasted great. Next time I make them I'll just bake them for about 45 minutes before adding the mushroom soup... mine were really brown after 1 hour.

A hit at home! I made this for some friends and it was all gone! I added stuffing around the pork chops the last 30 mins of cooking and it was very filling served with rice. Everyone couldn't move!This is a keeper.

My family absolutely loved this.  Very filling, since I used the thick cut pork steaks with the bone in.  Even my 8 year old daughter loved it, and I can't get her to try new foods too often.  Thanks for the new dinner!  I can't wait to try it again!

This was a very flavorful recipe.  The chops were extremely moist and tender. I had some fresh mushrooms that I needed to use, cut them in large pieces and added to the mushroom soup mix.  Fabulous!  I'll definately make this dish again.

I was starving and didn't like this. Nor did my husband. I used extra thick pork chops so I baked at 375 degrees. I didn't care for the sauce. The chops would be okay without the sauce with bread crumbs, flour and eggs.

I made this because I saw all the great reviews and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I followed the advice of others and cut my cook time down to 30/25.  I also browned the chops before cooking, but the breading was a bit soggy after I added the sauce.  I thought the recipe was pretty good and my boyfriend said he would eat it again.  I will keep this one on hand, but I will still be trying others.

This was so yummy!!!! The pork was tender and the sauce was very tasty. I served it with rice and even my three year old grandchild raved about it. This is definitely a keeper and I will make often!I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.

This is such an awesome and easy recipe!  Instead of pork chops I used pork loin and I added a can of mushrooms to the sauce.  I also doubled the sauce because the loin made 8 pieces of meat.  I highly recommend this recipe!  My husband loves it and so does my children!!!

Good dish.  I would recommend using seasoned bread crumbs.  My chops had a good flavor and weren't bland at all.    It isn't the fastest recipe, and it wasn't the best chops I've ever had, but I probably will make this again.

Great recipe. I used a Chardonnay wine in the recipe and discovered that it also went well with the dish as that nights table wine.  No complaints about this dish although I did add a little pepper
for added zing.  You will like these chops!

I didn't have the best luck with this recipe.  I have made it twice and they come out dry.  The flavor isn't bad, but I just can't seem to get the most out of this recipe.

Wow.  I was skeptical about this recipe as I am with all recipes that have cream soups in them...they all kind of taste the same.  Well this one proved me wrong.  Absolutely delicious and so simple to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly and the chops were really tender.  The coating on them was delicious.  The gravy the soup made was great over mashed potatoes.

These are good but I make mine without bread crumbs or eggs. Combing 1/2 C. flour 1 1/2 t. dry ground mustard, 1 t. garlic powder. 1 t. salt. Dredge/brown chops. Add1 can mushroom soup & extra mushrooms if desired. Try it. Talk about good!.

The combination of ingredients sounds tasty, but my family thought the flavors were really bland and boring: "needs more spice".  My husband also picked off all the breading, saying it soaked up the sauce and became too gooey. Vote in our house was not to try it again.

My husband really likes this dish.  However, he wanted more sauce.  So I make the recipe with three porkchops (there is just the two of us) and two cans of soup. I serve with a risotto.

I made this dish last night for Valentine's day dinner. It was really good. I doubled the sauce as mentioned in another review, and it turned out perfect. The pork was not tough and dry at all. Just be sure to cook it for the full hour or maybe a little longer. Although I didn't do it, but I think if you sprinkled the chops with your favorite herbs along with the garlic powder, it would be even better. This recipe is definately staying in my recipe box!

OH MY GOD!!!  These were soo great.  The sauce was out of this world.  I can't rave enough about how much we loved these.  This was the first time that I made good pork chops.  They usually come out really dry, but, with this recipe it was just right.

It was  very good!  I skipped the breading as I wanted to reduce the carbs.  Instead I pan fried with onions and mushrooms for 5 min. per side.  Then I put it all in a 9x13 pan and covered with foil and baked 30 min.  Meanwhile, I mixed mushroom soup with 1/3 c. skim milk and 1/2 cup chicken broth, garlic powder, oregano, basil, ground pepper and garlic.  I added the mushroom soup mixture and baked 30 more minutes.  Pork chops were moist and tender.  Served the mushroom gravy over wild rice.  My family liked it so I will make it again.  I might try it with the wine next time, I just didn't have any on hand.

Absolutely delish! I followed the recipe EXCEPT. I, like others doubled the sauce and didn’t have white wine on hand because we never have leftovers; so I used chicken broth... but it was soooooo good, no knife required!

Didn’t have cream of mushroom so substituted cream of chicken with fresh mushrooms. Came out amazing. Paired with some steamed cabbage for a light side.

The pork chops are delicious & tender when cooked this way.  The only thing I would change is to cut the number of chops back to 4 or to make additional sauce.  The milk, wine & mushroom soup mixture makes just about the right amount of sauce for 4 chops.

I judge recipes on if my husband goes back for seconds.  With this recipe he did. It was so delicious to us both!! I don't like mushrooms so I used cream of chicken instead. I was hesitant about using the wine but I used chardonnay and the "gravy" was so tasty with this recipe.  I also used thin, bone-in pork chops and did not smother them in gravy.  I fried on each side for 5 minutes, then baked in oven for 30 mins, and served the gravy on the side for the chops and brown rice.  I will use this recipe again and again.

I’ve made this several times since I found this recipe.  Family thinks it’s really good.  I think we prefer the golden mushroom soup but both are good.  Just a tip for those complaining of a lot of dishes.  When I have a recipe that calls for dredging etc, I just year off some foil and bend the edges for my dry ingredients.  I only use a small bowl, frying pan, and baking dish for this. Ball up foil “dishes” and toss in trash, couldn’t get any easier!  Thanks for sharing recipe!!

This is one of those recipes that I can't live without! WOW - I have never been one for pork chops, but maybe because I never had chops as good as this. If you want delicious, tender pork that falls apart, this should be your go-to recipe. I have made this numerous times now. I never egg/bread it. Just adds calories. But I do pan fry the chops in olive oil until browned nicely. Make sure you cover the chops with foil when cooking, this an important step. NO WINE? It's okay, use apple juice if you have it! This is one of my very favorite recipes. Enjoy!

I read the first review that said quick and easy,  saw the picture, and decided to whip this up. That reviewer is full of it or has lost the ability to track time.  The recipe requires a two step baking process that takes 1.5 hours alone. The prepararion is easy, but it does take time to complete the three step breading process. It's also messy and requires a great deal of cookware. In any case, it WAS delicious and worth the time.

My husband raved about how tender this was.  Said it was the best pork chop he'd ever had.  I baked the chops covered about 30 minutes, then poured the soup mixture (a mixture of 1/2 can cream of chicken, 1/2 can cream of mushroom, 1/2 cup wine and 1/4 cup milk) over the chops and baked covered another 40 minutes.  I used grated Parmesan cheese in place of the flour in an attempt to cut back a little bit on carbs.  Very tasty.  Very tender.  A keeper.

This was a big hit at our house tonight! I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I just used regular bread crumbs with a LOT of Italian seasoning. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, but found a can of cream of chicken. I mixed the sauce and put it through a sieve to remove the chicken pieces, although they would have been ok to leave them in.   I will definitely make this one again!

The only change I made is adding crushed garlic peppercorns.  The chops were delicious.

This has become a staple in my house.  I added fresh mushrooms (sauteed them first) into the liquid part and it makes it even more delectable!

This was a really good meal without changing a thing. My husband ate 2 chops and was sucking on the bones! I did reduce the baking time by about 10 mins on the front end and by about 5-10 mins with the sauce. I doubled the sauce recipe for leftovers with egg noodles. I will definitely make this again. Thank you.

Caramalized onions in olive oil, sauteed garlic and sliced crimini mushrooms for 5-7 minutes then added other ingredients to make sauce.
Had comments of, "Best pork chops I've ever tasted!"
Will definitely make this again!

I pretty much followed recipe though I forgot to salt and spice before the breading ( I did add after breading).  Where in the world was flour-egg-bread crumbs strategy all my life? ot is really a great strategy.  I didn't need anywhere near 5 minutes a side to brown the chops.  The timing in my oven for 1.5 inch thick chops was just right - maybe a tad dry, but no complaints.  I served over diced potatoes with lots of the amazing juice/sauce.  This recipe 'as is' rocks!

Excellent recipe.  My husband is a "sauce" guy so I fried the chops crispy on the outside and added a bit more white wine.  Turned out great!!

I wrote something about these but forgot to give the stars.  They're AMAZING, the best chops ever!!!  Because I don't like mushrooms, I used cream of chicken soup and doubled the sauce.  I also added more wine.   I baked them for 35 min. I heated the sauce to a simmer before pouring over chops to shorten the additional bake time.  Baked an additional 35-40 min.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.  They were fork tender and ABSOLUTELY DELISH!!!  My husband LOVES them too.  I'll be making these often!  The BEST chops I've ever eaten!!!!!

I'm giving this recipe five stars because I think had I not listened to a few of the other reviewers, this would've been delicious. But it wasn't. Oh, the pork was succulent and tender. I took half an hour off the cook time, and it was great. The sauce was awful. So, if you're reading other reviews and thinking, "Hey, that Golden Mushroom Soup mix-in sounds good," ABORT. I repeat, ABORT. Step awaaaaay from the golden mushroom soup, because it's god-freakin-awful. 

I will try this recipe again, and only, ONLY, change the cook time.

Awesome recipe; however, I had to change a bit to fit our busy schedule.  I coated the pork chops as instructed and browned in frying pan.  I then placed the semi-fried chops in my crock pot with some sliced onions.  I mixed cream of mushroom with some chicken stock and poured over the fried chops and onion in the  pot.  I cooked on low for 7 hours.  When I came home from work the pork chops were fall off the bone delicious and ready to eat!  I served over rice with okra and used the gravy from the crock pot.  Fix this quite often and everyone loves it!!

Absolutely amazing. I made a double recipe of the sauce and used half white wine and half vermouth. I also added some cut up onions to the sauce. I think that is a must do. Everyone loved it. The porkchops were so tender and juicy. I also only cooked them in the oven for 35 minutes then added the sauce and cooked them for another 30 minutes they were done perfectly. This is a great recipe that's easy to make and makes you look like a chef!

I made this recipe twice and each time received rave reviews from my family.  My husband typically does not care for breading, but he devoured these chops and, later in the evening, again remarked how very good dinner was.  In my book, that makes this recipe a keeper.  For those who don't care for the chops baked with the mushroom sauce,  I can offer another suggestion that is super easy.  Campbell's makes a new variety of tomato soup with chipotle -- it has a nice little kick to it.  In a small sauce pan, add the soup and 1/2 can of water (and/or a splash of white wine). Serve it drizzled over the baked chops (it's also great on mashed potatoes).

This is the best pork chop recipe of all time. I changed up the gravy by using cream of chicken with herb as it is less salty and used a sweet Asian pear white wine. YUM. I also agree with other reviews to make sure oil is hot and make sure crust gets very brown and crispy. Less baking time and more tender!

Loved it. Only changes were we only baked 2 pork chops. Used about half of the sauce mixture called for and added some fresh mushrooms. They did not take as much time as called for in the recipe.

I joined Allrecipes just so I could rate this recipe.  It is amazing.  I only made two pork chops (bone-in, 3/4 inch thick), but made the same amount of gravy, and I was glad I did. I used 1/2 a cup of chardonnay and 1/3 a cup of milk, and added a little black pepper. Oh, I also added a drained can of sliced mushrooms. Yum. I did like many of the others suggested and cooked the chops for only a 1/2 hour, added the gravy, and cooked for another half hour. The chops were fork tender. We ate this over rice, and licked up every morsel of gravy. I think I will try this recipe with chicken, it should be amazing as well.   Thanks for a new "in the rotation" recipe!

Tried this and love it! I used it with pork chops last week and chicken tonight. I didn't have wine and used apple juice instead. Turned out great. Very moist and delicious. Highly recommend. It is time consuming and uses a lot of dishes but it's worth it.

Ok, I have to tell you, I have never rated any recipes before, but this one was worth the effort!! This is the best pork chop recipe I've ever had!! I followed all of the directions, except I sautéed mushrooms and added them to the sauce. Also, knowing my oven all too well, I only baked these for 45 minutes. When I checked the internal temp, these were done. I just poured the sauce mixture over them and left them in the oven, turned off, until I finished the rest of the sides. They came out so flavorful and tender that the entire family was asking for seconds and wanting to know when I was going to make them again!! Thanks so much! This one is a keeper!!

Changes I Made: I seasoned my pork chop with Paprika, S/P, Seasoning Salt, & Garlic Powder. I added liquid smoke to the beat egg... & used regular bread crumbs... I browned both sides and only had to cook the chops for 35 minutes... Halfway through the baking I added the mushroom soup mixture... As a side note I added 1TBS of minced garlic to the soup mixture and chopped onions. Great and easy recipe ...

The flavors were good, but I'm missing the point of giving the chops a good crisp if you're going to cover them with a sauce as well as tin foil and continue to bake them. They just get steamed in the end. My husband asked if next time we could have them "without the sog."  Tonight, crispy baked chops with sauce over the top just before serving.

I've prepared real nice, thick pork chops using this recipe three times now. It is consistantly WONDERFUL! And by the third time all the flour/egg/bread crumbs steps just zip right on by! This one is delicious and very highly recommended!!

This was just okay for our family. I did follow the recipe, including the long cook time. Chops were definitely tender and could be pulled apart with a fork. My kids thought the texture was "weird" for a pork chop. But hey, their favorite restaurant is McDonalds so I don't think their opinion hold a lot of weight. The sauce was good but it's obvious it's made with cream of mushroom soup. We found the breading completely unnecessary. Following the recipe exactly left the coating on the chops and did not turn it into mush, we just didn't think it brought much to the recipe. Because I usually will have all these ingredients on hand, I might make it again. The whole family said they could eat it again but would never request it. However, this is not anything I would make if I had to run to the store to get anything needed for it. The long cook time didn't bother me. I made myself busy with other household chores while it baked. A positive to it is the ability to walk away from it and not having to keep checking on it. I put it in the full time and only looked at it to add the sauce. I definitely would not have the time to cook this on a weekday schedule.

Turned out perfectly! I sautéed extra mushrooms and added it to the sauce. I also mixed the sauce on the stovetop to heat it up before I put it on top of the chops. My family devoured them. Outstanding!

Perfect! That said, I will double the sauce from now on, just because it's sooooo good! My only change was not an intentional one. I substituted Italian seasoned Panko for the bread crumbs because DH did the grocery shopping.  Delicious!

I prepared this recipe almost as printed, except that I added a tablespoon of roasted garlic to the sauce and baked in the oven for about half the time (20/20).  I also used fat free Cream of Mushroom soup and sauteed fresh mushrooms with the pork.  The pork was moist and tender and the sauce was so good!  I served it over cooked orzo and it was a hit.

Very good recipe. I didn't used white wine, I used heavy wiping cream and milk and added fresh mushrooms. Instead of flour I used corn starch, bread crumbs, and ritz crackers crumbs. Turned out very good.

The most amazing pork chop recipe we have ever had.  I hesitated to make this because of frying then baking.  Why not just fry? But I decided to dive in.  I purchased boneless chops on sale so I had 12 chops, double the recipe.  I did everything exactly as the recipe calls for except I used one can cream of mushroom & 1 can cream of celery since I had a double batch of chops.  There has never been a better chop recipe!  Well worth the time and effort.  Make sure to cover the chops when baking, as it states, to keep these moist.  You can cut these with a fork!!!!  LOVE IT

This recipe was really good. I followed it almost to the letter except I changed a few things. I didn't add wine to it since I'm only 20 and don't have that on hand. My husband loved it as well. He couldn't get enough of it. Next time I'll make a little bit more so he can have thirds

Great and easy dinner.  I start all meat at room temp so reduced the cooking time to 45 min and 20 min.  Also heated the sauce to simmer before adding it to the dish.  Put the dish in the upper middle of the oven otherwise the bottom of the meat will over-brown and dry.

Incredible recipe, had to improvise did not have bread crumbs so finely grated herb croutons instead. Also only fried chops for 3 mins each side instead of 5, Oh and I also free flow the seasoning pretty much covered each chop with garlic powder and seasoning salt.

I made this recipe with sauteed mushrooms added in chicken soup and wine. Fried the chops in olive oil for about 5 minutes per side then oven for 1 hour. Poured on the gravy with mushrooms and 30 minutes later...tender, great tasting chops.

As others did, I reduced the baking time (this does not include frying time) to about 30 minutes total.  The pork chops did come out moist.  However, I grew up eating a dish made of ground beef, cream of mushroom soup and golden mushroom soup.  The sauce tasted not only familiar, but somewhat out-of-place with chops, since I associate it with beef.  For me, the recipe isn't one I will make again.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I used Panko bread crumbs, added Italian seasoning and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, and fried the pork chops in a large deep skillet until browned and crisp. Instead of baking, I prepared the mushroom gravy separately, using a large can of cream of mushroom soup and replacing the milk with extra white wine. I poured the hot gravy over the cooked pork chops and simmered for 15 min. more. Yum! Optional: Add another can or two of mushroom soup to make extra gravy to serve over mashed potatoes or jasmine rice. Enjoy!

Love this recipe!  So easy and delicious. I didn't have wine so doubled the milk, I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of mushroom, and added Currie powder to the sauce for added flavor.

Very good but the wine overpowered it. I could smell alcohol when removing the foil.  Also it was almost too salty even though I barely salted. My bread crumbs already had salt.

I fried the pork chops for about 3 minutes per side prior to baking them. I had really thick pork chops so I baked them for only 40 minutes before pulling them out to add the sauce. Unfortunately the chops were already at a temperature of 150 before I added the sauce, so I only cooked them 10 minutes longer.
All in all this was a good recipe, but be careful of the cooking times since my gravy ended up fairly watery due to the lack of cooking time, and my thick chops were somewhat dry the whole way through.

This is a really good comfort food. I gave this recipe 4 stars b/c I still think theres need to be some tweeking to the recipe. But, this is really good paired w/ mashed potatoes and corn.

This was just okay.  It wasn't salty enough, but that is easily remedied.  I fried the chops pretty well, but still the meat was too soft after they baked.  My husband ate them and said they were good, but he was not enthusiastic.  My daughter, 18, turned her nose up at them. I will try the leftovers later.  Maybe after the flavors have had a chance to congeal in the frig, the dish will be better.

I am in the process on this recipe. Need twice as much egg mixture and  bread crumbs. Very time consuming to get together. When browning take your time, will burn quickly. Will finish update when chops are done. Ok, so I have not decided if the effort. Was worth it but the chops were very tasty. Family really liked them. Change rating to 4 stars.

Just finished the best dinner! Amazing pork chops. Didn't take as long to bake. Only change I made was homemade mushroom gravy. Thank you for such a wonderful dish.

Made close to  original recipi. Used Apple juice instead of white wine(didn't have any) and used Emerils Italian Panko. Everything turned  out incredible. Chops very tender,juicy and flavorful. Made with white rice  and steamed  vegetables.

I was expecting deliciousness from such a highly rated recipe.  The pork chops turned out crispy and tasty on the outside, but dry/flavorless on the inside (I even decreased the baking time to about 30 minutes). I added Golden Mushroom from other reviewer's suggestions - the sauce was BLAH.

On the flip side, I will comment that perhaps it is due to my personal taste - it reminded me of a Salisbury steak type recipe my mom made growing up. My boyfriend said this dish tasted "pretty good" when I voiced my disdain, but he was definitely being nice.

very good flavor - even without the wine (I was out).  Could have used a little more sauce though. Will make again.

To start with, I burnt the chops.  My bad.  And then the cook time is way too long.  I should have listened to one of the other Reviews, but my chops were extremely thick, so I had hoped they would be ok.  Half to cook time would have been plenty.  I did double dip the breading, whic I think is a good idea.

Really liked this recipe!  I only used three thicker (about 1") pork chops and there was just enough sauce.  I took some reviewers suggestions and used just one can of golden mushroom soup and also added some sliced mushrooms that needed to be used up.  Breaded the chops and just put them in an 8x8 pan and cooked 20 and 20 and they were more than done (checked with a thermometer).  Paired this with a creamed corn recipe from here and everything was great!

I had 4 BIG pork chops from the butcher. I used the same times but increased the baking temp to 375, because of the size of the chops. We don't drink wine so I used beer instead of white wine. My wife doesn't really like pork chops but ate them because I like them. This recipe made the best pork chops I have had and the wife said I can make them anytime. REALLY GOOD!!!!!

I made this and substituted the cream of mushroom with golden mushroom simply because that's what I had and it was fabulous. The pork chops were so tender you could cut them with a fork.  Will definitely be making again.

The pork was super tender and moist but flavor was off. I agree the cooking time was way off too. This is one of the first recipes I made on this site that I did not enjoy, in my own opinion!

I made this last night for dinner and it was amazing. The only change I made was to put 1/2 cup of french fried onions in the processor and then mix them with the breadcrumbs (I do that with most of my breading).  I will definitely make this again and may even try it in the crockpot.

Easy to make and tasted scrumptious! I would brown the pork longer in the pan before baking as the coating became soggy in the oven. That's my only complaint, otherwise I would definitely try this again, maybe with chicken :)

It took me 48 yrs but I finally fixed fork-tender pork chops! Delicious! I used turkey broth that I had on hand in place of the wine & halved the recipe for hubby & myself.

OK I'm not a cook--I'm totally clueless on basic cooking skills.  That said, this was a easy to follow recipe. It come out looking nice though was just sure I messed it up since it didn't take a hour to cook. Thinking in recipe they used thicker pork chops.  Excited to serve it and surprised it melted in our mouths didn't even need the knifes I set out.   Saving this recipe and setting out to try another from this site.

Delicious and worth the effort. Just add caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms and it is perfect.  If you are out of ilk, just add more wine.

We really enjoyed these. I read through several reviews and saw that several people made comments about the bake time. I used bone in chops so the bake time in this recipe was correct. Turned out very juicy. Thanks for submitting!

I just made this for dinner.  My husband & I loved it!  I followed others advice & only baked for 35 minutes.  My husband does not like gravy or sauces, so, I did not add it to the pork & nuked the sauce in the microwave for a few minutes.   It turned out perfect & my husband actually liked it!

This was so good I wanted to eat all of them!  Hubby loved them, they were easy to make, and took little time.  I am adding a photo of the pork chops after I fried them - it is a critical step.  Take care to brown them completely, try to not knock off too many bread crumbs.  It is worth the effort!

It was THE BEST pork chop recipe.  EVER!   It was so moist and tender and had The Best Flavor.  The only thing I did differently was forgot the flour.  Used croutons for salad (Italian flavored) that I chopped to make crumbs about 1/4 cup and herb seasoned  stuffing to make 1.5-2 cups to have enough for 8 boneless pork chops. (Bought at Aldis) then used 3 eggs to make sure it was enough for 8.  (More than enough).  I had cooked some sliced fresh mushrooms in beef broth, so after the chops cooled 1 hour, I poured the soup/wine/milk mixture over them and then put some of the cooked mushrooms on top and followed directions to bake 30 more min.   I had NO IDEA it would taste so good, moist, and tender!   5 stars hands down.   My family loved it!!!

Chops turned out PERFECT! I followed the recipe EXACT, and when I make it again, I will make it the EXACT same way.  No changes required, and the family devoured it. Thanks for a great recipe.

So tender and delicious! My husband and I simply loved this recipe! I was able to add less salt and use a heart healthy can of cream of mushroom soup and didn't feel cheated at all. Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

Quite a bit of work for not much flavor. The sauce was average and I always love a good sauce. I fried them and then baked them for only about 20 min. They came out perfectly cooked.

Very similar to a chicken thigh recipe that is here - but uses mix of sour cream and 1/2 can soup to dip the chicken before crumbs. We like both pork and chicken thighs cooked this way. Now I'm hungry!

The first time I made these, the meat was dry and tough. I think the pork chops were too thin and may have dried out while being browned.

The second time I made these, I went to the meat market and got thicker chops. They were delicious. I used almost double the wine (which was white sherry), milk and soup for extra moistness.  Terrific recipe, but it is a little time consuming. Also, next time I'll spray the baking dish with non-stick spray, because the pork chops stuck to the dish a little bit.

This recipe was not for us. Neither of us liked it but, I  do not believe that it was the fault of the recipe but rather our personal taste preference.  That is why I did not bash it with  poor rating as many people do to a recipe.  My feeling is that  over tree thousand people cannot be wrong while my wife and a handful of others are the only ones who are right.  If you like the taste of wine in your recipes then this is for you

Easy, cheap and had all the ingredients. I substituted cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. Made mashed potatoes and used the soup and drippings for gravy. The family loved it!

I used 3 thick center cut pork chops and added a bit of cayenne to the sauce.......other than that I left the recipe "as is". Although, I will probably cut the bake time down next time to 40mins. My boyfriend loved it. I will definitely make this again.

The pork turned out decent, but the gravy was unbearable. I'm very glad I left it off and cooked it separate because the wine taste in the cream of mushroom soup was not doing it for us. I would've rathered it taste like straight cream of mushroom over the winey taste. I'm not quite sure how this recipe got such high ratings but then again I am a novice cook :)

This is a great and quick recipe. I made a few changes. Instead of using canned cream of mushroom soup, I used my homemade version of it. I added some sage to the rub for the chops. Also, the cooking time is too long. I cooked it for 25 minutes without sauce, and then another 15 minutes with the sauce, and they turned out perfect. If it hadn't required canned condensed soup, I would have given it 5 stars. This will definitely make it into our regular rotation.

I used 4 boneless porkchops and followed the recipe, except i baked 30/30. There was plenty of gravy to top the porkchops with extra, and to put on mashed potatoes.

Just made this tonight with the exact ingredients except the soup was garlic golden mushroom and I only had 3 pork chops. Oh my- yummers and with less chops there was sauce to put on some mashed potatoes too! Very rich- we are totally stuffed. Not something I'd make every week but it will be a treat when I do! And I used Riesling as my added wine, very nice- smelled so good :)

Tried this recipe tonight.  Husband loved it. My only changes were that I used boneless centre cut pork and I used a green apple infused white wine in the sauce,  because of the boneless pork, I reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes at 350 and then another 20 minutes with the sauce.  I also double breaded the pork using bread crumbs mixed with some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and cayenne pepper.  The pork turned out great, very juicy and perfectly coloured inside however I did find that pouring the sauce on top and that extra baking did take away from the nice crunch that the breading had as it became a little soggy.  I served it with steamed carrots, yellow beans and snow peas, corn on the cob and some baby red roasted potatoes.  Great dinner!!

Absolutely the best pork chop I've ever had and my family loved it too. Next time I make this, I need to start cooking earlier because it is time consuming preparing and frying each chop individually

I do not like using canned items like Cream of Mushroom, but it was a good choice here.  I could not taste the "can" flavor.

This recipe is FANTASTIC & so versatle. I have even used chicken breast instead of pork. It's simply delicious! I add onion powder to the season rub also some diced onion & minced garlic to the sauce. You can add any variety of spices to your taste and you can also substitute the wine for chicken stock, but the wine really adds another level to the taste you don't get with stock. This was an instant family favorite & is now in our biweekly must haves!!!

There are a few steps to this recipe but the finished product is worth it.  My family was very happy!  I made this with the  "Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes" by CathyM on the side and the whole dinner was a major hit!

Tried this recipe.  I was a little disappointed that after getting a nice crust baking it in the sauce made it soften.  I would make the gravy to go along with next time. The flavors were right on.  I will make this  recipe again.

I never knew pork chops could taste this good!! This is a wonderful recipe. I grabbed a package of boneless rib-eye pork chops and these came out so tender they cut with a fork and were just bursting with flavor. Also, when I seasoned the chops before dredging in flour, I did BOTH sides of the chop and this added even more deliciousness. Thank you bdid for adding this recipe!

So juicy and tender!  You'd think the long baking time would dry them out, but it does not. They are amazing.

This is by far the very best pork chop recipe I have ever, ever tasted. The hint of the white wine at the end makes the taste just fabulous. My family is still talking about them six weeks laters. Barb Day

Made this last night followed it exactly as written. I found that the pork chop it self was as lacking flavor, chops were a bit on the dry side, sauce was good but not something to rave about. My family thought it was a different recipe for smothered pork chops since it was served with it's sauce. From the time it took to finish this dish it wasn't worth it.

Fantastic!  Easy, though somewhat messy recipe, the hardest part was waiting for it to cook!  It made my whole house smell delicious. The meat was flavorful and tender.  I'm sure my family will be asking for this one again.

I did what many if the other reviewers suggested for the gravy and cooking time. For the gravy I used 1 can mushroom soup, 1/3c wine, 1/2c milk like the recipe states; but I first sautéed 4oz chopped mushrooms with 1/4 white onion, and one clove of garlic in 1T butter. I then added salt, pepper, 1/2t (I think) crushed red pepper flakes, and 1T of kitchen bouquet. I simmered it on low for 15-20 minutes while the pork chops cooked for ONLY 30 minutes. I think any longer they would be way overdone. Maybe next time I'll reduce the cooking time to 25 minutes. I served with mashed potatoes and a salad. The hubby loved it! My tweaking of the recipe is the one I will use in the future!!

This recipe was a little too rich/salty for my taste (and I may have even used healthy request Campbell's cream of mushroom soup.
However, I did coat the pork chops pretty well and mine were not as thick as the ones in the video...  I used Progresso bread crumbs (Italian Style) and chardonnay wine.
The sweetness of cream corn seems to meld really well with these pork chops (I got my favorite cream corn recipe from All Recipes).

My family was so tired of the same old pork chops. I'm so glad I tried this recipe my family loved it and can't wait to have pork chops again! The pork chops were so tender and delicious I couldn't wait for my mom to visit and try my new delicious recipe. She was so impressed that I had to share with her.

Even just cooking it, 20 minutes in the oven and then 20 more minutes with the mushroom sauce was too long. The internal temperature after the first 20 minutes was already over "done" for pork. The sauce was just okay. It was nothing to rave about, just "okay."

Wonderful recipe! I didn't  have salt seasoning on me, so improvised with some spices in the cabinet (salt, black pepper, garlic salt,oregano, paprika,onion powder- mixed together and seasoned pork)... Pork was extremely tender, and the sauce was to die for! Wouldn't change a thing here!

I followed some of the suggestions from other people and added green onion and golden mushroom to the soup mix. The sauce was excellent. The only issue I had was the breading. The breading did not seem to stick well and would fall off while it was in the oven. The pork chops only cooked for an hour total time as well.

I used cream of chicken soup but otherwise tried to stick to the recipe. I had to add more seasoning and I thought there was way more bread crumbs than actually needed. Overall I liked the flavor even though I didn't care for all the dirty dishes. My husband thought it was okay but not great. Even though it was pretty decent, I don't think I'll be making this again.

I always just fried my pork chops before I found Allrecipes.com.My family all love them fried,but they liked these for something different.Pork chops are one of my favorite meat,so I like to make them quite often.I have found so many different ways to cook them and so many great recipes for pork chops.This was a very good one.

I always love to try out new recipes & this one did not disappoint! I was out of eggs & only had plain panko crumbs so I just seasoned the chops w/salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, dusted them with flour, wet them with water & pressed the breadcrumbs in. I browned them well in coconut oil which cut down the initial cooking time to 40 minutes. I was afraid of a blah sauce so to the soup/milk/wine mixture I added a healthy dollop of sour cream & a few good splashes of Worcestershire sauce. SO TENDER and yummy!!!  This is DEFINITELY going into the rotation, but next time I think I'll serve it over egg noodles. mmmmmmmmmmm

These were the best thick pork chops we've ever made.  My husband will only ever eat thin cut pork chops because he says the thick ones always come out too tough, but these were fall apart tender.  He loved them and said we definitely need to keep this recipe.  We didn't vary from the recipe -- no need to, these are awesome.

I think these are some of the best pork chops I've ever eaten. The only reason I rated below 5 is for the fact my family issn't nearly as wild about them as I am. I love the texture combination of the soup and breading. You just have to make sure to eat it right after preparing else I imagine you'd end up with a gummy/mushy mess (I've yet to let it sit long to find out.) I do omit the wine as that's not something we keep at home. I'd like to try this with a homemade cream of mushroom soup next.

I make this all the time now. I've started to add in sauteed mushrooms and spinach to the sauce to make it a bit heartier. Either way, this is a great way to avoid frying the chops. they come out juicy and tasty!! YUM!

The seasoning and sauce on these pork chops were AMAZING!  However, (and this is a big however) I would NOT recommend cooking the pork chops as instructed.  Putting them in the oven and covering them in foil turned them to mush.  Far too cooked for my taste.  We love pork chops in my house and we couldn't eat more than half a piece.  I am a little surprised that I have not seen this mentioned before. Anyway, I tried this recipe again, same seasoning and sauce, but I just cooked the pork chops on the stove like I normally do, and brought the sauce to a simmer on the stove as well and poured over when it was time to serve.  It was much better!

Best pork chops ever, I changed it up a bit. I fried fresh mushrooms and onions and added it to the mushroom soup. I did not add
milk to the soup, doubled the white wine. 
Simply wonderful and easy to prepare.

this was very good. I followed others suggestions and increased the wine with less milk. I think next time I will follow recipe as the wine taste was a little strong for me.

The entire family raved over this recipe. Only a couple of changes I made.  One was using cream of chicken rather than mushroom as the family isn't a fan of mushrooms.  I also substituted apple juice for the white wine.  I doubled the "sauce" so that we had enough to have a nice sauce on the mashed potatoes that I served it on.  It turned out wonderful. So tender and tasty.

I have made this recipe 4 times now. This is, by far, my favorite recipe! Everyone who I have had eat it, absolutely LOVES it, from my 3 year old to my husband. (Who hates mushrooms). I double the sauce because I like to pour extra sauce on my pork and potatoes. Besides that, I don't change a thing. 
The pork literally cuts like butter, and the flavor is to die for! Defiantly recommend this recipe when inviting company over for dinner! It's always a winner!!!!

My husband said they were the best chops ever, didn't change a thing, made them exactly as written. It was easy for the flavor you get!! So tender, they melt in your mouth. I used 1" boneless chops, and I served with wide noodles and sweet corn. I did double the sauce, so there was plenty for the noodles. Will be making every month, and I would serve this to company as well!

OK--this was yummy.  Hubby doesn't like mushroom so I used creamed of Onion soup (USE THIS Onion and NOT Celery and use the wine NOT Belgian beer !!).  This might be more salty than the mushroom so I added about twice the amount of wine and about 3/4 cup chix stock.  Only made 2 thick pork chops but oh so delicious.   I could have cut about 20 to 30 minutes off the pre-sauce time.  They were still delicious but fell apart--maybe that's the goal but hubby likes them a bit less done.   I didn't  pour the sauce over the chops, just around them.  What a gorgeous color after 30 min in the oven.  Made this with german Wirsing (Savoy cabbage, Bacon, Onion and white sauce) and smashed potatoes.  super YUMYUM!

Would make again. It does take quite a while to prepare and then bake (1.5 hrs). So, not great for a busy weeknight, but company worthy.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was great. Instead of baking for an hour, I baked for 50 minutes. And instead of baking for thirty minutes after smothering them I baked for 25. I smothered each chop about 75% with the mushroom mixture.  Not only were the chops moist, but they had a really good flavor. I seasoned with a little garlic and seasoning salt with pepper the night prior. This was my first time successfully baking thick chops, and I'm pretty proud. I used dried bread crumbs because I like the crunchy-ness. The mister loved it as well!

Loved it! I don't usually do pork chops but I wanted to be different and I didn't want the typical shake and bake
Crunchy pork chop 
These were perfect I did a few adjustments 
I cooked for 35 min in stead
Of an hour and I didn't pour sauce over them I warmed it on the stove and let the family our however much they wanted on. And we don't really like mushrooms so I used cream of celery and it was AWESOME 
my 9 year old is so picky and he asked for seconds!!! 
Also the spices with the garlic powder and lawrays season all salt I added a dash of lemon pepper Yum in the Tummy !!! 
I served with loaded mashed potatoes and Mac
And cheese with a Cesar salad !!!

Really Juicy, Tender, flavorful pork chops. I will say it is a bit much having to seaso, flour, dip in egg then cover in bread crumbs- that is the only reason for the 4 versus the 5 star, but other than that it was an excellent dish and my picky Husband and Kids loved it.

Amazing. I have been looking for a good pork chop recipe and this is it. I made the following adjustments: After frying the chops and removing I added some onions to the pan and fried them until brown, then added 3 cloves of minced garlic for a minute, added Cream of Mushroom and Golden Mushroom and doubled the wine and milk for more sauce. Baked for 30/30 minutes without and then with the sauce.

Hubby loved it, however I would have preferred it pan fried without the oven and gravy steps.  To me, the sauce was overwhelmingly "canned soup".

Only needed to cook for total of 45 minutes.   Very tasty.  Watch the time in the frying pan as it is easy to burn the pork chops.  (I did a couple of them, but they were still edible just not as good as the ones I didn't burn.)

This was the best pork I've ever tasted. I'm a mom of two VERY PICKY kids, they hate mushrooms but they both loved its so much they didn't even notice the mushrooms WOW! I made this recipe twice, the first time I followed the recipe. The second time I used the golden mushroom soup with the cream of mushroom, some pork gravy, and added a bit more wine than milk. I fried the porkchops before I baked them and they loved this dish again, actually more. My kids ask me to make this recipe every week. I give this recipe 5 stars made both ways. LOVE IT!! And if the kids will eat this instead of McDonalds, pizza, chicken, hot dogs ect... What else can you say :)

This recipe easily goes to a 5-star if you add a can of golden mushroom soup and double the milk to make more sauce. Serve with a side of mashed potatoes and pick a veggie that goes with mashed potatoes. The truth is that you can make the sauce to top your pork chops or chicken breaded and fried however you prefer. I like Zatarans oven fry mix for pork chops, and I'm going to try that next time before transferring the pork chops to the casserole dish to eliminate the frying step, because I'm usually cooking 8-10 pork chops, and that's 3 pans to fry them all! But, thanks for sharing this one!

These chops went over well with the entire family, even my 15 mo. old granddaughter loved them (I omitted the white wine)  They could have had a little more flavoring perhaps more seasoning salt/garlic powder.  I will adjust this on my next serving.

Converted my husband from pork chop hater to pork chop lover. He even asked to add this to our weekly menu recipe box. Thanks for submitting! 
(WARNING: I did not have white wine so I substituted ginger ale. Will try this with the one next time & if it's equally delicious - will keep you posted.)

I hardly EVER make pork chops. They are just too chewy and bland! But my husband had an itchin' for them. So I stumbled across this recipe and was SO glad I did! Wowza! My perception on these has definitely changed. I came across a steal of a deal on thick pork-chops. I used 4. Followed the recipe(flavored each step on dredging). Fried, baked for 30min, added the sauce, and baked another 30minutes. I sautéed fresh mushrooms and added it to the sauce. Oh, and I was a little heavy handed with the Sauvignon Blanc! Phenomenal recipe! Soooo good! Can't wait to have this tomorrow for lunch. I served with corn and red-skin garlic mashers. Also, to go with the garlic theme....I got a can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup! I will definitely be making this often! This is definitely a keeper, especially for big family meals on a budget!

I made this dish for my fathers bday. It was the best smothered chops ive had. I did change a bit. I bought center cut bone in chops. I seasoned it with lawrys season salt and black pepper, chopped a sweet onion, and let it all marinate for 3hrs. I fried them the same but w/o the crumbs. I put fried chops, onions, fresh mushrooms, and 2pcks mushroom gravy (McCormick) in the pan. Baked on both sides for 35min each at 375°. It falls off the bone. Mmmmmmmm.

I made this recipe just as written and it was not bad but not great either and a little bland and super over cooked. 2nd time around I followed a combination of other's reviews and was suprised and pleased at how good it was! I only cooked the pork for 30 minutes before and after adding sauce, doubled the amout of sauce using 1 can Golden Mushroom soup and 1 can cream of mushroom, which makes huge difference in flavor, added a container of sauteed mushrooms and some chives plus a dash of red pepper, for color to the sauce before covering meat . Not only did it come out amazingly tender and with enough sauce for dipping the meat into the flavor was perfect much more flavorful without being too rich would have given my second batch 5 stars!

I'm not sure about this one.  The sauce was amazing.  I added the golden mushroom as advised.  I also added onions and thyme.  The pork chops were a weird texture and the breading was way too much.  I made some chicken breast (my daughter doesn't eat pork chops) exactly the same way but didn't cook them as long and the chicken was much better.  My daughter commented on the sauce.  I probably won't make this again with pork chops. If I do, I won't bread them or do it with chicken.

I used 8 chops, and 2 cans of soup- cream of celery and 1 cream of chicken, because we don't care for mushrooms.  Plain bread crumbs, because that's all I had on hand, and I just added alittle oregano to the bread crumb mixture. Everyone loved it and we had plenty of sauce for dipping. Thanks for sharing.

Bland comfort food.  My husband and son quite liked it, I thought it was just OK, and too much work (and mess) to make considering the results.  I reduced the cooking time by 30 minutes but the pork chops were still overdone.  I probably won't make this again but if I did I'd put more into the sauce, onions and mushrooms at least, and cut the cooking time down to 25 minutes without the sauce and 10 minutes with, or heat the sauce separately and pour it over the chops to keep the breading from becoming soggy.

Awesome! I did what some suggested and did 2/3c of wine and 1/3 c of milk. Cooked without soup 40 min and with soup/gravy 30 minutes. Superb! We loved it! Served with fine egg noodles and extra gravy, so good!

this recipe was amazing and easy to make. I did not  change anything and it was really good, the only thing I would do different is make more of the sauce so I can dip my pork chop in it and my mashed potatoes

A very good basic recipe. Perfect empty fridge dinner. Very easy recipe to add to. Say you have fresh mushrooms for example - just toss it in the sauce along with any other complimentary flavor. Also be sure to follow the dredging instructions as suggested. As with any frying use hot oil and set food on paper towel for draining excess oil prior to baking. I've tried this with cutlet as well, just be sure not to overtake (just pan frying works)

These pork chops were great! Substituted cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken per other reviewers suggestion - turned out fabulous. Were definitely a great way to prep pork chops!

Great flavor on these pork chops!  I did add a little bit of sage to the mushroom soup mix and I only cooked them for 30 minutes the first time and 15 minutes the second time.  They were perfectly moist!

This recipe came out finger licking good.  Definitely the Best chops ever.  I did make a few adjustments because I did not want to run out to the grocery store, I just used what I had in my pantry.  Used an assorted pack of pork lion, used 1 can of cream of chicken instead, sauteed mushrooms and onions and added them to the soup mixture, used seasoned batter instead of flour, used garlic and herb bread crumbs instead, used 2/3 cup milk and 2/3 cup of white wine.  I fried the chops first for 5 minutes, drain them, then place the chops in a baking dish, added the soup mixture, cover it with foil, then baked it all at one time for 35 minutes at 350 degrees.  They came out moist and tender.  Melt in your mouth.  My husband and kids loved it.

The family enjoyed these pork chops.  I personally felt that they were a little bland. Next time, I will probably experiment with additional spices.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, though I reduced the total bake time to 50 minutes.

Tried this last night and we loved it. Pork chops were so tender. Did'nt have any mushroom soup, so used cream of celery instead and added some sauted mushrooms. Could'nt have been any better. We will definetly have this again.

I had really thick boneless pork chops....2 of them just for hubby and me.  I can't tolerate mushrooms in any way shape or form, so I sautéed a chopped onion and then added cream of onion soup to it along with the milk and wine.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  There was just enough sauce for the chops and to put over buttered egg noodles.  Absolutely delicious and so very tender.  Not dry at all.  This recipe is terrific.  I don't think I've ever enjoyed pork chops this much.  It's a definite keeper, and it's certainly company-worthy.  Thanks SO much~!!  Oh, by the way, hubs loves mushrooms, so I did save some of the sauce and added sliced fresh mushrooms for him and cooked until they were softened.  He loved it.

I made this tonight for dinner.  It was honestly the absolute best pork I have ever made!  I used Penzey's Smoky 4/S seasoning for the seasoned salt.  So moist, so tender and the flavors in the gravy...AMAZING!  Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!  My 13 year old said "mom, seriously, please make pork chops this way all of the time!" :-)

My whole family loved this recipe! The only adjustment made was to add a can of Golden Mushroom soup to the ingredients which allowed us to have plenty of DELICIOUS gravy for our mashed potatoes. A couple of "happy accidents" that happened were, I burned the chops while "browning" them and I put the soup mixture in the pan before ever putting it in the oven. My burners must not be well calibrated because after 3 minutes of browning at "medium-high" the house was full of smoke and the chops were black on one side. I immediately turned the burner down to "medium", turned the chops over and after 50 seconds the other side was starting to burn. I did not want to waste the chops so I kept on with the recipe and baked the chops with the soup mixture for 1:05 and they turned out absolutely delicious! This recipe will definitely be a frequent flyer in our home but for now on I will brown at "medium" and check them frequently.

Made this the other night and I was pleasantly surprised. The only change I made was to double the milk and soup so that we had extra gravy for our side (mashed potatoes) and I didn't cook it quite as long. Otherwise, I followed this exactly and it tasted great. You do have to make sure you season it to your liking, and next time I may throw in some additional spices.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband raved about it...something he doesn't often do.  It came out very tender & very tasty.  The only things I changed was the cooking time and I used crushed stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs...I cooked it 20 minutes before adding the sauce mix and then 20 more minutes.  It was a lot of work preparing them from a wheelchair but they were definitely worth the work.

We are pork chop lovers, but these were the best chops ever! I used 2" boneless center cut & butterflied them, salt & pepper both sides. I added season salt, garlic powder & old bay to the flour mix & parm. cheese to the bread crumbs. I sautéed them crisp and baked for 20 min. I used sherry wine ( a bit more than 1/3 c) in the soup mixture, baked for 35 min. The chops were very tender & the sherry added  a delicious "French" taste! Bye-bye shake & bake! This is a Keeper!

to give this a bit more of an adult-taste i did the following

1.  while the pork chops were cooking, i sauteed onions and mushrooms in a deep skillet that i used to fry the pork chops. i then removed the onions and mushrooms and added the soup + milk + white wine (I added a wee bit more white wine).  I also added a thumb of good cognac (this makes a HUGE difference, and don't forget all the alcohol evaporates anyway).  I allowed these to simmer for a little while then added back the onions and mushrooms and allowed the whole shebang sautee while the pork chops cooked

2.  i cooked until an appropriate internal temperature (to each their own!)

3.  i prepared egg noodles and, once they were cooked, tossed them in the delicious sauce.  

i thought these small additions made the whole meal extra special!  given how heavy the meal is, i paired it with a crisp gerwurztraminer but i'm sure a riesling would have also been good.  it was the same bottle i used to make the sauce of course.  i would avoid a heavy chardonnay (because the dish is just so heavy to start off with) or an overly citrus sauvignon blanc.  i think beer would have been a good alternative.

Enjoy!

Made this recipe using 2 thick 1.5 inch bone in chops. I skipped the bread crumbs coating (hubby hates bread crumb anything) so I only did the egg wash and flour dip. I pan fried for 2 min on each side (any more and it would have been burnt) and baked for 1 hour as the recipe states. I sauted some onions in the drippings and then made the gravy/sauce and used apple juice instead of white wine because I didn't have any. I poured the sauce on top of the chops and baked another half hour. These chops turned out EXTREMELY moist,tender and delicious!!! If you have thick chops, cook for the full amount of time!! It does not turn out dry at all!!! The only thing I'd recommend is to drain the grease before adding the sauce to the chops. I will be making this many many more times!!!

Amazing recipe!
As suggested, I made the pork chops crisp on the outside and baked them for 30/30 as opposed to the 1 hour and then 30 min.
My only other deviation was I added a 4oz can of Green Giant Mushrooms (pieces and stems) to the soup mixture. My husband absolutely loved it!

OMG!! We really don't like frying foods....but for a splurge, this was awesome.  I followed recipe exactly, however, after seasoning, I let chops sit in frig overnight.  I used the boneless pork chops and decreased frying/baking time as suggested.  I got a strong feeling the bone in would have been EXCELLENT. I sauteed lots of fresh mushrooms (key), onion, garlic & green onion as suggested as well and added it to the heated soup mixture...2 words...TOES CURLED!! Hubby loved it! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

It was very moist and full of flavor.  I only used 2 pork chops but made the full gravy amount.  Very glad I did.  If you make the full recipe make more gravy. I only cooked it 25 minutes and then 30 with the gravy and it was perfect.  I'll be making this again.

Turned out great.  30/30 min bake time is perfect.  I also took the advice of previous reviewers and added a bit more wine and chopped mushrooms.  As for the fry time, I nearly charred one side of the chops while frying (set the heat way too high) but they still turned out perfectly after baking in the sauce, so no worries about over frying.  Only gave 4 stars because calling for 2 cups of bread crumbs left me with nearly 1 cup of wasted bread crumbs.  Will make again.

Very good recipe.  I would try some more seasoning next time.  Did not need 1.5 hours or cooking.  Did 30min/30min.  Probably could do less if you needed to save time.

My family absolutely loved these!  I used Panko bread crumbs instead of the Italian were not greasy in the least. I was pressed for time so I shortened the baking time to 35 minutes with foil and then put the soup mixture on and then returned them to the oven for an additional 25 minutes.  The meat was done and tender even with the shortened time. They were amazing.

This was very tasty; I made eight servings using Boneless pork loin chops.  Used Chicken broth as opposed to Wine; I always have chicken broth never have wine.  Next time I will add an additional can of soup to have a little more gravy for the potatoes.

These are fantastic!  A few tips....you really only need to brown your chops for a minute or two on each side.  Any longer, and they will be charred on med-hi (I learned the hard way).  My chops were about an inch thick and only took 35 mins (total) to finish baking.  I didn't want the "crust" to be soggy so I uncovered them about 20 mins before they finished in the oven and waited to pour the sauce over top until just before serving.  Yum!

Sauteed diced fresh mushrooms, then added the rest of the sauce ingredients to the pan and added a dollop of sour cream.  Doubled the sauce since I also made mashed potatoes. Brown the chops well and cook for 45 mins then 30 mins with the sauce.  Rich but very very good!

This was easy and great comfort food!  I did add a little granulated garlic to the sauce because I didn't have any garlic powder for the chops.  I used only two large pork chops and there was plenty of "gravy" for the potatoes and pork chops.

Mediocre results, followed exactly except that I lightly seasoned the pork with a touch of Philip's blackening seasoning before breading. It was nicely tender, but rather bland of flavor, no zing at all. No one complained, but no one raved either. Would probably have been even more lackluster without the touch of blackening seasoning. Smelled wonderful, but I wouldn't make again without heavily modifying the recipe to infuse more flavors & complexity.

I am making this for the 6th time tonight.   Delicous.   I'm made a couple of changes based on previous reviews.  for example, I've doubled the gravy using 1 can of cream of mushroom & 1 can of golden mushroom & shortened the cooking time a bit.   Since we are big mushroom fans, I sautee fresh mushrooms in the pan after frying the pork chops with a little butter & add them to the sauce.  Just yummy.  Definitely a keeper!!

What a great recipe!! I never had much luck with pork chop recipes and my husband doesnt even like pork and he loved it!  This is a keeper! One tip that I followed and glad I did was to cut the cooking time drastically....I sauted for 5min each side and baked 20min and then 20 min with sauce.  Also decreased milk to 3/4 cup and increased wine to 1/2 cup.  I added sauted fresh mushrooms to sauce too.  Next time I think I will use Chardonnay to make wine flavor bolder.   I only had a white reisling, but still came out great!!!

I think its kinda funny how people are so critical of a recipe by saying things like "it lacked flavor". These recipes are subject to personal interpretation, any person who cooks on a regular basis knows how to season meat, to add flavor, if you are blindly following a recipe and not making any adjustments ever, then maybe cooking isn't for you. this sounds delish.

We wondered what slamming meant until we tried this. I did not want to use canned soup, so made a roux (butter/flour/chicken bouillon cube and water) and used that. Wish I had made double the amount of gravy, it was so good. Also recommend using the scrapings from bottom of pan to mix in to the gravy before serving it really enhanced the flavor of the gravy (as expected). I also added onion powder to the gravy. The meat was very tender. I would definitely make this again.

I have made these 3 times now, and they are always fantastic.  Changes made: baked for 30 minutes, then added soup mixture and baked for additional 30 minutes, for a total of one hour.  I think the 1.5 hours the recipe suggested would be way to long.  Used apple juice instead of wine.  Other than that followed recipe exact.

One of our new staple dinners. I've experimented with other soups too, always great results. Remember to clip the fat ring around the edge every inch to keep the chop from 'cupping'

Is there anything better than breaded pork chops in gravy? Well this was really delicious; I only doubled the amount of mushroom soup for extra gravy.

The direction "Fry the pork chops 5 minutes per side..." is misleading.  Despite the instruction to do so over a medium-high heat I found that over a medium heat the breading burns in less than two minutes.  I'm displeased with this recipe, will not be cooking it again, and in addition to not recommending it to others I will specifically recommend that they do not try it.

I know the crust is supposed to be soggy but I think we would like this crispy more.  We made this like the recipe says but we weren't crazy about it.  It was like a jaeger schnitzel but it just wasn't as good.  Glad to try it but probably won't make again.

this recipe was AWESOME! Me and my family love it, i used Panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. And instead of Cream of mushroom, wine and milk i just coated the pork with Cream of Chicken. (we don't like mushrooms and my husband is allergic to grapes) it was great!

I cooked this for my parents and my mom said this is a 6 out of 5 stars recipe.  She said this is the best tasting porkchop.  She even had seconds, which is not her.  I served it with mashed potatoes, which was great for the white wine sauce that turned into gravy in the oven.  My dad has a terrible time chewing any meat, and he could chew this very easy because it was so tender.  It took a little time to make, but oh so worth the extra time.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms, and added these when i added the soup mixture.

This had very good flavor and the pork chops were very tender and cooked just right...not dry or anything. I did wish they were a little more crispy on the outside.

I tried this with chops and with steaks when I accidentally thawed a couple of small steaks.  The pork was so lean that it was slightly dry, but the steaks were great!  Used other reviewers suggestions and it was just as good as leftovers.

DH said he thinks these may be the best pork chops he ever had.  They were very tender; we could have cut them with a butter knife!  I'm not too familiar with the various cuts of chops; I used sirloin chops as that was what I already had.  Added a little cayenne pepper and garlic powder to the gravy to spice it up a little for our tastes.  Served with wild rice and corn.  DH said the corn was the perfect veggie with the chops as the corn was sweet, but I'm thinking in the fall an apple salad would be perfect.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe.

excellent recipe but I think 1.5 hours is way too long to bake chops. i would recommend 20minutes, then pour the soup mix and bake for 15-20 more depending on how thick and how large the chops are.

This is an excellent comfort food recipe. I used panko bread crumbs, and in addition to the single can of cream of mushroom soup, I added a can of golden mushroom soup as suggested by other reviewers. I served it over rice and added a garden salad. The pork chops were very tender. My family loved it!

Awesome recipe and a big, big hit with the hubby!!!  Here is what I did different -I left out the seasoning salt because I did not have it on hand.  I also added another egg and added more bread crumbs to the bowl and used more olive oil and added golden mushroom soup and used Chardonnay and definitely doubled the soup/gravy portion of the recipe.  Big, big hit.  I will definitely serve this for company.  Oh, and I also used pork chops that had been tenderized and the stuff just melted in your mouth........

Very easy and quite tasty. The only thing I did differently was I cooked for 30 minutes then added the sauce and cooked another 30 minutes. The meat was done and very good.

Wonderful recipe! I didn't have Italian breadcrumbs so I used Panko and mixed in Italian Seasoning. This seemed to work and provided a nice crunch. Couldn't believe how tender they were...Everyone loved them and asked to have them again in the near future...Thank You!

Wow, this was really good. I had pretty thin pork chops so I didn't have to bake them in the oven for more than half an hour before they were done. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic recipe, didn't even need a knife.  Secret is to season the meat first with season all, garlic powder, etc and let it sit in fridge a couple of hours before you start cooking.  Not bland at all!!!

Cooked this for Mother's day for my family and my parents. It was a huge success!!! Even my overly picky father enjoyed it! Try substituting the garlic powder and salt for Adobo. Went really well with Candied Yams, mixed veg and a glass of Merlot.

I always worry about dry pork chops when baking them, but this reciped really made for a moist pork chop, and I loved the addition of the sauce to serve over top of them.  Very elegant dish!

I followed this recipe exactly as stated..I usually tweek all recipes one way or another.But not this and it came out beautifully ..Very tender and full of flavor.I am so impressed how tender the chops were. The next time I will double the sauce so we can put them on mash potatoes. I also will Saute some onions and mushrooms and add that to it.This is simple and full of flavor..We thank You..

These pork chops were a big hit.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup on hand so I just poured a can of pork gravy over them minus the wine and milk instead and it was fabulous - tender and juicy!! I willl definately make this one of our routine  recipes.

I used 1-inch pork tenderloins and followed the recipe verbatim. After 45 minutes in the oven at 350F, my pork tenderloins already had an internal temp of 175, so I added the soup mixture and baked for another 15 minutes or 1-hour total. My pork was very tough. I don't know if I used the wrong kind of pork or perhaps the 30 additional minutes would have somehow softened them up, but I was not happy. Any suggestions? What did I do wrong?

This was really good.  I didn't have any milk so used some Sr. cream and water instead and it still tasted great.  Will make again but need to increase the sauce ingredients so I can have on mashed potatoes.

These are the best pork chops I have ever made or eaten! My husband & daughter loved them too! I can't wait to make them for company. I didn't change anything except I have a fast oven, so I bake them for 40 minutes then topped with the sauce and baked for 30 more minutes. Otherwise, I used exactly like the recipe is written. Thank you so much for such a yummy pork chop recipe!

Loved these!!! I doubled the sauce by using an additional can of soup (golden mushroom) and used a full cup of wine. Also, I used bone-in chops and cooked them 20/20.

I am an amateur cook but I made these and my boyfriend just admitted that it is now his favorite pork chop recipe. I mean my best meal is scrambled eggs.  I only made 4 pork chops, no wine, doubled the milk and seasoned the cream of mushroom mixture with salt, cayenne pepper and whatever else I took out the cabinet.  It still wasn't enough mixture for me and that is because it was so good.  I did it with rice and it was delicious. Can't wait to make this again. I'd say if you do make 6 pork chops use two cans.  I also used bone-in pork chops.

This one's a keeper! I did make a few modifications though.  I did a 50/50 bread crumb parm cheese mix. Cooked my chops for 40 min covered and cooked the sauce separately on the stove and poured it over the chops when serving. I added chopped chives and parsley to the sauce also. So delicious!!!

I've had this recipe in my "to make" pile and am now wondering what took me so long.  This is an easy and delicious meal.  It is perfect for a weekday family supper or tasty enough for guests.  I added a tablespoon of dry mustard to the sauce before pouring it over the chops.  It will definitely become one of our family favorites.

This was delicious.  Seriously.  My husband already asked when I'm making it again and we just had it last night.  I made a few changes.  I put onions and mushrooms under the chops while they baked and in my hot skillet after searing the chops I sauteed onions and mushrooms before adding the soup, milk, and wine.  I added a little parsley and seasonings, as well.  The sauce was the star of this dish.  We had redskin potatoes and green beans and the sauce worked well with all three components.  I only baked the chops for 30 minutes then added the sauce and turned the oven off and let the flavors meld for about 20 minutes in the oven while it cooled.  The chops were very juicy, not overdone at all.  The only thing I'll change next time is the use of bread crumbs.  I felt that the flavor of the bread crumbs did compliment the amazing flavor of the sauce.  Overall, really good recipe that I will definitely use again.

In preparing this recipe, I took into consideration some of the other suggestions (e.g. frying the meat until the coating was crispy, cooking the soup/wine sauce in a saucepan separately, adding fresh garlic and mushrooms to the sauce, and reducing the oven time to about 20 - 25 minutes.)

The result?  Although the dish "looked" good, it still lacked flavor and was bland.  It needed more oomph.  Perhaps more garlic or salt or pepper, but it tasted like plain ol' pork chops with breading and mushroom sauce.  My kids and father-in-law agreed with me as well.
I also found that after pan frying the pork and putting it into the oven (without adding sauce), the coating still became soggy.  Why bother frying the meat in 4 Tbsp of oil (fat, calories, etc.) if it doesn't retain the crispy coating and just becomes soggy? 

You would think that with over 3,000 mostly positive reviews, this recipe would be a sure thing, but that wasn't my experience.  I won't be making this again.

Awesome flavor.  I changed the cooking time.  Baked for 20 min after browning, added soup mixture, baked for 20 min more.  They came out perfect!!  I used the boneless center cut loin chops butterflied.
Oh i also added more white wine and halved the milk.
Big hit with the family :)

these were tasty but the nice golden brown crunchy crust you create by frying them first disappears when baked into mush and adds tons of fat.  I would season next time then quickly brown in small ammount of oil without the bredding,, then bake and add soup mix as stated. This would reduce the calorie count substantially without sacraficing flavor I think !

I have made this MANY times, always awesome. Recently I invested in a Ninja cooking system (same thing as the blender) and this makes this sooo much easier to cook. I put about 1/4 the oil in the ninja, set it to stove top high, brown the chops. then pour the gravy in and set it to oven at 350. Soooo good and a 1 dish to wash afterwards!!!!!! now this makes my rotation a whole lot more than it used to.

I made these pork chops the other night and used Marcela wine instead of white wine.  I also added mushrooms.  My husband LOVED these pork chops.  I took one to work for lunch and it was almost better the next day.

Fairly easy although I would add fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also added fresh mushrooms to the sauce and a little more wine.  Overall, tasty and moist especially with the gravy.

WOW!  This one is a keeper and is now in the fall/winter dinner rotation!  The baking time is suitable for thick cut chops, they come out fork tender.  Make them with the scalloped potatoes with onions recipe by Dorothy Bateman from this site-you won't be disappointed. :)

SO GOOD! I just got married so I have been playing around with tons of recipes and this one is definitely a keeper! It takes a bit longer to make than I would typically like, but the results are so worth it. The chops are so tender you wont even need a knife and the sauce is delicious.

These are SO good! They don't take nearly as long to bake as the recipe says, however. I used a roasting thermometer set to 150 degrees and it only took about 45 minutes total to cook my 1" thick chops.

Tried tonight for dinner.  These are very good, easy to fix, and tasty.  I doubled the sauce so we can have another meal with this dish.  Will definately make again.

these came out just perfect.  i substituted garlic powder for a mix of fresh garlic, kosher salt, black powder and a bit of jerk rub.  since my husband doesnt like mushrooms, i did a simple white wine sauce

ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!!??  These porkchops are AWESOME----even if you don't have EVERYTHING on the ingredient list!  I absolutely HATE cooking pork, I rarely make it and, except for a man-revolt at my house against chicken,I would not have tried this recipe.  I had five boneless pork chops, washed and seasoned them with a pinch of salt,cracked black pepper, a pinch of cayenne and a pinch of paprika on each.  (I had absolutely no garlic in the house) Made and egg and milk wash, a bowl of flour and a bowl of italian breadcrumbs.  Dredged in the flour first, then the wash, and finally the breadcrumbs.  My gosh!  Frying them in the hot oil (all I had was extra virgin Olive Oil) they smelled INCREDIBLE and the coating was brown, beautiful and crispy!   I  put the chops in the oven with a tight covering of aluminum foil.  After about 35 minutes (i used other reviewers cooking times) I took them out of the oven and made a "sauce" out of what I had available---cream of chicken soup.  I added 3/4 can of milk , stirred and put it quickley through a strainer--to get the chicken out(it just seemed WRONG to have those floating on pork)  I grinded ALOT of black pepper--I was maybe trying to go for a more country fried steak type of gravy?   I had NO wine, No apple juice,No Substitute.  Anyway , I poured this over the chops and back in the oven for another 25 minutes.   TENDER! The guys said they were the best EVER! I'm still in shock! I will try the original recipe after shopping next time

Delicious pork chops. Used planko bread crumbs, fat free soup and skim milk.  Still very rich and creamy.  Need to double the soup if  makingmore than 3 servings.  Serve over jasmine rice.

This had good flavor, and very moist.  I did fry the chops for several extra minutes to get the crust nice and brown before baking as suggested by many other reviewers.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I will make again.  I also may try panko next time only because I prefer it to bread crumbs.

This was wonderful and smelled amazing while it was in the oven!  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and omitted the white wine and added a little chicken broth.  We had the leftovers for lunch and it was even better the next day!

Very good! Nice comforting meal on a cold night.  I made it exactly as written , but lengthened the browning time and shortened baking to 30 and 30 minutes per other reviewers suggestions.

This was very good. My pork chop were thin, so I cut the cooking time in half (25 mins, then 20 additional mins with sauce). Also, next time I will at least double possibility triple the sauce.

GREAT pork chops recipe!  No more dry chops for our family.  We will use this recipe over and over.  I made this for a group of 10, ages 6 to 90, and EVERYONE finished their plates clean.  I didn't use white wine but used chicken broth and it turned out great.  I made some chops with the gravy and some without, but had it on the side to add as they wanted.  A++ recipe!

I made this last week and my husband said it was the best thing I'd made since we'd gotten married (2 years ago!)  It was so tasty.  Used more wine vs. milk and loved the way it turned out.  THANK YOU!

Comfort food doesn't get much better than this.  You may want to make extra gravy to serve over mashed potatoes.  The pork is well-seasoned and tender, and the gravy was just right.

I followed the advice of others and only baked the chops for 35 minutes then added the soup mixture and baked for another 10-15 munites. I also used cream of chicken because we arent fans of mushroom. They came out perfect and my whole family loved them!

pork chops where nice and tender, I only cooked for 45 minutes total. 20 without sauce and 20 with. I didn't like the sauce. I will try again but instead of wine Im going to try chicken broth. Also adding garlic, onions, and mushrooms. Will let you know.

I'm not a big pork fan, but I have to say I LOVED this! I substituted the mushroom soup for cream of chicken, and it was so good. I also cut down on the cooking time while baking- 25 min, then another 20 min while adding the sauce seemed to be enough cooking time. My fiance absolutely loved this dish, as well. 

Thanks! Will definitely be making this again.

This is an excellent recipe. Yes, the breading will be mushy but it's gonna be so good you're not gonna care. The only thing that I added was a little lemon pepper when sesoning the meat and I spiced up the sauce to taste. I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, some salt, and parsley. I may even add a little lemon pepper to the sauce when I fix it tonight.

A good recipe. I used half and half instead of milk, only because I had some, and I added a bit more wine. The sauce was a little too thick at the end, and if I do this recipe again, I'll create some extra sauce in a sauce pan to douse the chops at the end.

I used Emeril's Essence instead of plain seasoned salt. Gave a tiny tiny bit of spiciness which was appreciated even by the scared-of-spicy people.

Be careful and make sure you shake the excess flour and breadcrumbs, or the breading will be a bit thick (albeit tasty). 

I used more oil than indicated. Using a 2-3 times as much oil browns the chops a lot better with more golden color.

Very pleased with the recipe.

Simple and my family LOVED it.  melted in our mouths.  I will be buying pork chops more often thanks to this.  Editing this review... I just made it again but was running short on time so I cut down the baking time to 45 minutes then added the gravy and only cooked 20 minutes and they still came out soft and delicious!  So if you're in a rush, no worries.  Still delish

Pork came out very juicy and tender! Did substitute tortilla crumbs and rice flour (gluten free)..but kept all ingredients the same. Followed cooking times/temp. as written. Turned out delicious!

Fantastic recipe! Soo tender! My chops were kind of thin so I didn't cook as long. Next time I will serve over rice as suggested. This was amazing. I did add more mushroom soup and wine to make extra sauce as you can never have enough!!

Followed this recipe exactly (except cut it down to 4 servings instead of 6) and I wasn't overly impressed, but it was still good. 

The breading on the pork chops was great. Much better than Shake n Bake according to my husband. However, we weren't big fans of the gravy. It tasted like a pork chop (a good pork chop! lol) covered in soup. 

I will definitely use this recipe again for the pork chop breading, but will skip the gravy.

My family loves this recipe. You have to allow pleanty of cook time, but actual time in the kitchen is pretty short. I like to add some fresh mushrooms and chunks of onion to give it more of a fresh flavor. MMMMMM.

My pork chops turned out to be tough and that was only after an hr. of cooking. Maybe 45 minutes would be enough. The gravy tasted a lot better after I added the pan drippings to it. Much better than shake and bake though!

This was such a delicious recipe!  I am not a fan of pork chops, but my husband is.  I look for recipes that I may like so that I can make them from time to time.  The are GREAT.  The only change I made was adding fresh sliced mushrooms, because I happened to hae them.  I sauteed them in the pan after the pork chops.  I added about 1 TBS of butter and a little seasoning.  I was afraid the chops would be dry, but they were moist and, again, very very tasty!  I will definitely make this one again!

Baked for only an hour.  Pork chops were fantastic.  Sauce needs a little more flavor-better sauce would have given it five stars.

Very Good!  I only had four pork chops on hand, but they were nice thick boneless center cuts.  I followed the recipe exactly, except only baked them for 1/2 hour before adding the "gravy", and then baked for another 1/2 hour.  I served with Texas garlic toast, sweet peas and mashed potatoes.  Yummy!!!

I only had four pork chops and I didn't have seasoning salt so I seasoned with garlic salt instead of garlic salt.  Other than that, I followed the recice exactly.  It was FANTASTIC!  My husband, two year old daughter and I all LOVED it.  Will definitly make again.

This recipe was very easy and had good flavor.  I followed the recipe except used golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom because that is what I had on hand.  The wine gave the flavor more depth and tasted more like a gravy than canned soup.

This one's on my rotation. I crave it, even. It's taken me some finagling to get it just the way I like it, though. I double bread them--barely brown once after dipped, dip again and brown slow to just-crispiness. I use flour, garlic salt, pepper and some chili powder. Then I top them with stuffing and pour the mixture of one can cream of mushroom, another can cream of golden mushroom, and some white wine or white wine vinegar and a tsp of ground mustard. gives it its own unique, addicting zing. not too hard to make or on the budget at all. i always make it with mashed potatoes loaded up with cream cheese, sour cream, butter and milk. this combo is usually my stand-in when i want something dense and luscious. :)

I used this recipe as a base, but like some others, the amount of baking time is really long!  I went against the creamy mix per others distaste.  I went mostly per the instructions til it went into the oven.  At that point, I only baked for 40 min.  Instead of all purpose, I used self rising and they came out delicious.

This is how I usually make my pork chops all except for the mushroom gravy. I take one chicken boullion cube dissolve it in a small amount of water, then pour it into the pan I'm cooking my chops in. I pour in just enough to cover the bottom of the pan then cover with foil. Makes the chops so tender you can cut them with a fork. We like A1 or a BBQ sauce to dip them in.

Excellent!!  I did not pan fry the chops, just sprayed the baking pan and chops with Pam.  I also added a bit of Jack Daniels to the soup mix...The family loved it...the leftovers were incredible as the flavor really had soaked in...will make again.

This was delicious...i'm am a bake-from-scratch type person, but this recipe actually tastes really good.  i did doctor it up a bit, adding mushrooms and deglazing the pan with wine...my husband who is pretty picky loved it, and my three year old wanted to taste it and ate a pork chop for the first time ever.

These pork chops were really yummy!  I followed the advice of others and got them nice and crip before finishing in the oven.  I only needed to bake them about 30 minutes after frying.  This not a quick weeknight meal, definitely a lot of clean up afterwards.  It was worth the work though.

Best Pork Chops EVER!! I used extra thick cut chops and doubled the sauce like suggested.  They were gone within minutes. My children are picky eaters at they ate every bite.  I used egg noodles instead of mashed potatoes. Yummy

This was some of the best pork chops we have ever had. I don't think I would change a thing! Although I only used 3 porch chops and the same amount of seasoning etc that was listed - but was so moist and hubby loved it! Mary

This was the first time I tried baking pork chops, and it came out great! Although, as others have suggested, I cooked the gravy on the stove top, not in with the chops so they remained delicious and crisp on the outside.  Thanks for a great recipe - we'll be making this one again soon!

This was a very easy recipe and even the finicky eaters in the house enjoyed.  I didn't have Italian season Panko, so I just added some of my own spices.  It turned out delicious.  I think anyone can play around with this recipe, it is more about following the concepts.  Thanks for sharing and for the new recipe!

I made this very good recipe, instead of wine, i used 1 can of fat free cream of mushroom, and 1 can of fat free cream of chicken, along with 1 cup of milk, it was soooooooooooooooooooooo yummy!!! my husband was in heaven, along with cutting some of the calories out, and for the eggs, we dipped the meat in egg beaters, would definitely make again!

This was pretty gosh darn good!  Fairly easy..Not TOO many steps......Instead of plain mushroom soup...I used Mushroom & Roasted Garlic....I also put a layer of sliced onion below the chops.......I used a medium cut/loin/tenderized chop......Pretty yummy!!!

This recipe was excellent but I wouldn't be opposed to omitting the bread crumbs next go around.  They seemed to not fit the recipe well and we scraped the breading off in the end.

I thought this was fabulous; I made some changes hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  I didn't have any wine so I doubled the milk.  I also used the same pan I browned the pork chops in to simmer my sauce (gravy).  In the sauce I added minced garlic, fresh mushrooms, rosemary, sage and a couple of splashes of Worcestershire sauce.  I let that bubble for a bit and then followed the rest of the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

Easy to put together.  I like recipes like this that you can stick in the oven and forget about.  I'd rather spend time chatting with guests. I don't like to be in the kitchen cooking after they arrive.  I would have given this recipe a 4 1/2 based on taste alone but the convenience factor bumps it up to a 5 in my book.

This recipe was pretty good. I made some changes and would make even more if I make this again. I followed some reviewers suggestion and used 2 cans of soup - mistake. The pork chops were just swimming in soup. Should have just stuck with one can. I added extra garlic powder, salt and pepper to flavor on both the pork chops and in the sauce. I baked the chops for 45 minutes, poured on the sauce and baked for 30 minutes more and they were perfectly cooked and moist. I don't know, next time I may do what other reviewers did and just serve the sauce on the side.

I was out of cream of mushroom soup so I had to substitute cream of chicken, but these turned out delicious and my husband and daughter really loved them.

I don't consider myself a particularly good cook, so for those of you out there like myself, this recipe is for you.  I messed up several times-I didn't do the dipping of the pork chops with the egg, flour, and bread crumbs in the correct order and I didn't put the mushroom mixture over the chops to continue baking for 30 minutes.  I also used panko bread crumbs because that's what I had.  However, after all of the mistakes, this still turned out absolutely delicious-melt in your mouth tenderness with an amazing flavor!

Great recipe.  I used cream of onion soup instead of mushroom because that's all I had on hand.  I also used 1/2 C of white wine.  It was wonderful.  Thanks for this recipe.

Ehh, these were so so for us. My husband, who will eat pretty much anything and will make it known when he likes something, didn't say much while eating these.  I asked him what he thought and he said they were okay. Sorta a let down because these take some time to make. Plus I made a ton of chops I got from costco. We also had a ton leftoever. I loved the smell while cooking but the flavor didn't live up to the aroma. I agree with some that the mushroom soup was the culprit. I think if I make them again, I will add my own twist to them.

This made a great meal but it was lacking the flavor a bit for us.  Like a few others have said, the mushroom soup stood out in it too much and it seemed like that was the main flavor.  Even though I love cream of mushroom soup!  It wasnt really what I was wanting in this dish.  Its a good base recipe but needs a little extra added to it to be a 5 star for me.  Great meal thou and we did enjoy it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this tonight. Love the way it came out. I was battling my child in the kitchen and still managed to get this done in 10 min prep time. My wife liked it, she doesn't like cream of mushroom so next time cream of chicken.

These were so good as is!!  I kept all of the ingredients the same, just adjusted the cooking time. I had thin boneless pork chops, so I cooked in the oven for 20 minutes and then another 20 minutes after adding the sauce. I also warmed the sauce in a small saucepan before pouring it on the chops! As my boyfriend put it, "Best pork chops you have ever made!" I agree!! My 3 year old also ate them, who refuses to eat pork chops any other time I make them.

This was a great recipe and easy to cook.  My family doesn't like mushrooms so I used cream of chicken instead and it was great.  I had a request to have it again before we even finished eating the meal.

I made a few changes to this but otherwise it was great. 1st I sautéed fresh mushrooms in the pork chop pan then made the sauce in the pan as well. The pork chops were very juicy and tender.

This is absolutely wonderful!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY but did add fresh sauteed mushrooms to it because we love mushrooms. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars! Served this with brown rice and a green salad and had enough gravy for the rice.  We have been married 51 years and my husband said it was the best meal I have ever cooked and the best pork chops he had EVER eaten.  Considering that his Mother was famous for her pork chops, this was the ULTIMATE compliment!  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will be making this often.

Real guest food!  My husband loved these!  I cut the sauce on top in half as we were using just two thick pork chops and that was perfect.  This is going right into my family cookbook and will be sure to make again and again.

do not cook them for the 1 1/2 hrs I cooked mine only 40 min and than add the soup for the 30 min and they were done. I might even cook them a little less next time. I did add to the soup some red pepper and other spices, sauted some onions than added soup and spices to the same pan.

I really enjoyed this recipe! But..maybe it was because I used bone-in chops but the bake time was way too long! After only 50 mins in the oven my chops were already over done I would say bake on 350 for 45 mins and add sauce for an addition 10 mins. So a total bake time of 55 mins. I also sauteed some onion slices,quartered mushrooms, and 2 cloves of garlic in 2 tbls butter and a splash of white wine during the first baking session and then added this to my sauce! The addition really dressed this recipe up!!:) Very moist and flavorful!

Maybe I made these wrong or cooked them to long but I didn't really care for them. It was eatable but I'm pretty sure I wont be making them again. They seemed a little dry. Maybe my oven cooks hotter then it says.

I'd give it a higher rating for flavor, but the gooey crust was a definite turnoff.  My husband and kids barely touched it after I spent so much time and effort making this dish.  Nice try, but I'd have to go with either fried and crispy, or baked in sauce... not both.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago and I am making it again this week.  It is really delicious.  I pretty much followed all of the directions except I used a can of cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom.  Next time I think I will use a can of cream of mushroom and a can of golden mushroom just to experiment with taste.  I covered and baked for 35 min., heated up the sauce on the stove, then uncovered put on the sauce and baked for another 5 min.  Although the chops were not "falling off the bone," they were very tender and juicy.  I can't wait to make this again!!

This recipe was really easy and really good. I followed a reviewer substitution and used cream of chicken soup, 2x the milk and no wine and my husband and kids ate it and loved it.  My youngest son doesn't eat much of anything, so this was good!

This is delicious!  The pork chops turn out to be so tender, they fall off the bone.  I love the white wine in the sauce mixture because it gives it a little tang.  The next time I make these I would like to add sauteed mushrooms and onions to put over top the pork chops.  I personally love these with mashed potatoes, I use the sauce mixture as a gravy for them.

Very good, instead of regularbread crumbs, I used Panko bread crumbs and didn't make any gravy and for a side, I made some scallop corn casserole from this site! A very good supper!

These pork chops were delicious! They were moist and delicious. We changed three things: 1. We added cayenne pepper to the breadcrumbs and 2. sauteed mushrooms in the pan used to brown the chops 3. made the sauce in the pan with the mushrooms to meld the flavors - delish!

Best pork chop recipe I've ever tried. So good. I added sauteed mushrooms and green onions like another reviewer recommended and doubled the gravy by adding a can of cream of chicken. Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus.

These were so yummy.  I didn't have any white wine so I added chicken broth as a substitute.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  My family loved them and it was a relatively simple recipe.  I had everything in the pantry for it.  I made mashed potatoes and topped them with the "gravy" from the pork chops.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I did not have any wine so I skipped that, I don't think its critical, but would add a little something if used.  The only other modification is that I cut in 2 tbsp of Bisto brown gravy mix to the flour.  I gives it a richer flavour and colour to the gravy.  (I also use Bisto to flour my stewing meat).  Great recipe.

Just delicious!  My husband asked for seconds!  Very easy and very tasty.  I'll mix this recipe into my regularly served meals.  I did substitute the bread crumbs with frosted flakes.  This reduced the sodium amount and it was just as good as traditional bread crumbs.

On the first bite my husband gave me a thumbs up. I don't always get that immediate reaction so 5 stars it is. I did use a can of mush and a can of golden mush soup plus I doubled the wine (actually used Vermouth) as we generally like more sauce. I also added some bottled minced garlic and dried minced onion so very easy.

This wasn't my favorite, sorry.  Husband liked it, but I prefer my own unbreaded baked porkchop recipe. I used panko bread crumbs as that's all I had - and I'm glad I did, because I think store bought processed bread crumbs would have lessened the overall flavor and texture of this dish.  I seasoned my chops with ground pepper, salt, garlic powder and Mc Cormick's Smoky Sweet Red Pepper mix. To make things easier - I used my Pampered Chef flour shaker to "coat" the chops instead of dredging - I also used 2 cans of condensed soup so I would have plenty of gravy for rice.  Because of that, I doubled the milk, but used only about 1/2c. white wine.  I found I needed more oil to brown my chops and I used Smart Balance oil instead of olive oil as I don't care for the taste of olive oil when frying breaded foods.  I still found the taste of wine overwhelming and didn't care for it - I used Robert Mondavi Reserve Chardonnay.  Even though my chops browned up nicely and the panko adhered perfectly, the taste of the gravy was gummy and strange.  I would recommend cooking uncovered in the oven - covering with foil really softened the crumb crust and made it mushy.  The chops definitely need more seasoning than indicated - even more than I used.   I also found I needed to adjust the cooking times to 45/30.  If you like this kind of dish, I'd recommend playing around with it a bit but it's just too much work with too little 'pork chop' flavor and a strange white wine after taste for me.

I actually tried this with boneless chicken breast first, and tweeked it just a bit.  I mixed the seasoning in with the flour instead of seasoning the meat.  I also used Garlic and Herb seasoned bread crumbs.  I didn't make the soup mixture, but I don't think the meat needed any extra.  The flavor and texture was amazing by itself... and I did eventually do the same thing with the porkchops, and just as good as the chicken! (BTW- I think baking it for 35-40 minutes was just right, an hour would have made them too dry).

I made this exactly as written - except that I didn't make the sauce.  I also found out that 2 cups of bread crumbs is a little much and my dish cooked in about 30 minutes instead of an hour.  Very tasty!  The whole family - even the little kiddos - gobbled them up.

This recipe was very very tasty!  After I fried the chops in the pan, I added fresh chopped mushrooms and 1 small chopped onion to the pan and fried them too, then added that to the sauce.  And make sure to keep an eye on the cooking time, mine was done baking in 40 min total.

These chops gave me flashbacks - not to my mother's kitchen, but to my grandmother's! This is probably the best recipe I've tried from this site! I sent some to my dad, and he fell all over himself raving about them! My daughter - who DOESN'T LIKE PORK - thought they were awesome! Fall apart, melt in your mouth delicious! Thank you, bdld, for submitting this one! I'll be looking for more of yours! Can I give more than 5 stars? A++++++++++!!

My family loves this recipe! This has been by far the best pork chop recipe I have tried. They always turn out SO moist and full of flavor. The only down fall is, is that it does take a while to cook... Otherwise this is a keeper! Thanks for sharing :)

After reading several other reviews I tried fixing two "problems" that I saw were a common issue. First with the crispiness, I used Panko Bread Crumbs and they were perfect. I also only baked for about 35 minutes. I made the "gravy" using both cream of mushroom and Golden mushroom....(which it would have been fine with just the Cream of Mush) i spooned the gravy just over the tops of the chops and baked another 10 minutes or so to let it soak in. We served with rice and my whole family LOVED it. The chops were very tender too, which baking can sometimes dry chops out, but not in this recipe.

Next time I'm leaving off the tin foil, the moisture held in from the tin foil made the bread crumbs completely lift off the pork. It definitely doesn't need a full hour in the oven--closer to 45 minutes max depending on the thickness. I would pan-fry the pork, transfer to the oven, and add the cream sauce for the last 15 minutes max. This way the crumbs don't lose their crunch. *If you're out of cream of mushroom soup or if you are gluten-sensitive here is a substitute: Whisk 2tb of cornstarch into 1c. of cold milk. Stir in 1.5tb butter, 1tsp chicken boullion, & 4oz can of mushrooms. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently & then simmer for 1 minute. Add salt & pepper to taste.

This recipe was super duper!  The only thing I changed was that I used cream of chicken soup because my fiance doesnt like mushrooms.  Other than that, I changed nothing else.  I loved this.  My son and his friend snuck in that evening and ate the left overs.  They loved it too.

I was looking so forward to these pork chops for supper.  maybe if I didn't use the wine, we would have liked them just with the mushroom soup.  The wine really gave them an awful taste...very dissappointed.

We did not care for this recipe.  The flavor was just ok, and the wine seemed over powering.  Will not make again.

I followed the recipe fairly closely but because I didn't have a can of c/mushroom soup, I made a white sauce from a dry cream soup base and added sauteed fresh mushrooms and herbs.  I used thick boneless chops and baked them for approx. 30 minutes with thick slices of unpeeled apple, added the sauce and mushrooms and baked another 25-30 mins.  The meat was tasty and very tender.  Yum.

We enjoyed this recipe and I will try other soups for sauce.  I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of celery because it's what I had in the pantry and I wanted extra sauce.  Also, my chops had a nice crunch to the outside, even though I put quite a bit of sauce over them, so just make sure you sear them well with the coating on it before putting them in the oven (make sure your oil is nice and hot before putting them in the pan).  Also, I didn't have any white wine in the house, so I just used milk (again, I doubled it) and added some fresh mushrooms that I sauteed in butter to my soup mixture.

I thought this recipe was just going to be okay and was pleasantly surprised! I read some of the  reviews and I agree, definetly make more sauce!  I only had one can of Cream of Celery soup so I mixed that with Sherry and it turned out very good, we all wanted more sauce!  My pork chops were very thick so baking 1 hour and then putting on the sauce worked out perfectly!  Great recipe!

Excellent! - I've been making this recipe for years and I LOVE it.  My fiance loves them a bit plain, so I don't season his as much and the recipe is pretty much as written for him. Me - I love 'em with a bit of hot and spicy so I add a bit of tobasco to mine.  My oven tends to run a bit hot at times - cooler at others *shrug* - so, I adjust my cooking times.  but like I say, a recipe is a GUIDE - NOT A LAW :) and this guide makes some wonderful baked chops :) thanks bdid.

Don't see what all the fuss is about. Tender- yes. Flavorful - sort of. Easy - absolutely. But nothing really special. Doubt I will make it again.  Maybe it is because I did not grow up with this kind of things as comfort food.

Very, very good.  I took a suggestion and used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can golden mushroom, omitted the wine (used more milk) and also added some sauteed mushrooms.  Served it with mashed potatoes and a salad.  Hubby said it was a KEEPER!

I wouldn't say these are quick and easy to make as the cook time is 1 1/2 hrs and the prep time isn't that quick either.  Also, the flavor was a bit bland.  I even tried the golden mushroom soup tip, cayenne pepper tip, and sautee'd mushrooms tip.  Still bland.

This was a very good reciped.  I didn't change a thing.  I am definitely adding to my recipe box, but where did you use the olive oil?  I also used the "What to Drink" section. I made the Bourbon Slush.  It was a great addition to the food!

Awesome dish!!! Absolutely delicious - my husband even said that it is his favorite dish :) Though I did switch it up a little. I cooked it in the oil on the stove top for about 10 minutes each side. And I didn't necessarily lightly batter it in the bread crumbs - I used all that I could on each. Oh, and I only used four prok chops - middle cut with bones. I also did not use the white wine but used about a half cup of sour cream. I am not a huge meat fan - but this was completely yummy!!! Would definitely recommend and will make again :)

This was delicious. I used pork chops with bone, added more garlic powder, used cajun seasoning salt, salt and pepper (Im Thai so I like my food very flavorful). I sauteed fresh mushrooms n onions in butter and added it to the sauce (heated on stove). Browned in veggie oil then baked the chops for 20 min (adding sauce the last 10 min). Came out VERY flavorful and moist. Made this with mashed potatoes, string beans, and rice pilaf as side dishes. Excellent! Thank you for this recipe.

Delicious!  I followed several peoples advice and added a can of golden muchroom soup, fresh sauteed mushrooms and browned them a bit longer.  I baked for 30 min without the sauce and 30 min with the sauce and it came out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was pretty good, though I did as others said and cut down the baking time (almost in half) and used twice the amount of wine to add a bit more flavor. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes. The two together were pretty good. :)

The sauce made this a 5*!! Minor changes based on others' feedback.... Only cooked it up in the oven 35 min (more than enough time). Sauteed fresh, sliced mushrooms in the skillet the chops came out of and added them to the sauce. Did the (doubled) sauce in a sauce pan on the stove and served it up at the table.  Deeeelicious!!

Perfect Comfort Food!  This was a great, hearty meal for a cold, snowy winter night!  I used 4 thick cut pork chops and doubled the amount of sauce.  Instead of the wine, I replaced it with chicken broth.  I baked first for close to 40 minutes, covered with the sauce and baked for the additional 30 minutes.  The pork was so tender!  The gravy was delicious and we spooned it over homemade mashed potatoes.  Great recipe!!

FANTASTIC!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Have made it numerous times.  The only time it didn't turn out perfect was when I bought super thick pork chops (couldn't tell in the packaging.)  Just had to cook longer so dried them out a bit.  I have made this for numerous house/dinner guests and get asked for the recipe every time.

It was easy and good just not great. I was disappointed. The family liked it but I have other recipes I like a lot better. The gravy was good and I may try this again with chicken. I would pound the breasts so they are even thickness.

Ok, I'll admit I didn't cook them the full 1 1/2 hours, but more like 1hr and 10 minutes.  The porkchops were not as tender as I anticipated so maybe they do need the full time.  I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of celery and added fresh mushrooms.  I like the sauce, but the porkchops tasted just like they do from the stovetop.  Next time I will try following the recipe exactly.  We still like them, but didn't loooove them.

I typically don't leave reviews but this one was so good I have to tell you thank you for sharing this recipe.  I made the recipe as is and used thick pork chops.  I baked in my cast iron skillet just because I'm lazy and didn't want to wash another pan.  The meat fell off the bone.  We served over jasmine rice.  Great dinner especially for cold nights!

This recipe was great! The chops were so tender.  If you don't like the wine flavor you may want to omit it, decrease the amount or cook it off a little longer.  The wine gives it a pretty strong flavor.  However, this is one of my favorite ways to pork chops.

I may have overdone the seasoning rub.  No problems with lack of flavor!!  Next time I'll take it easy on the seasoning.

This was a very good recipe. My husband isn't much of a pork chop fan, and he loved it. I used regular bread crumbs and left out the wine but doubled the milk. I also added some garlic powder to the mushroom soup gravy. I browned the chops in a cast iron skillet, then just stuck it in the oven and baked them. Once they were finished I took them out of the pan and mixed the gravy in the skillet, making sure to scrape all the yummy browned bits off the bottom. I served it with baked apples. Very tasty.

I made my own version of this tonight and it was great! I used panko bread crumbs to coat the pork chops which cooked nicely in the oven with the gravy. For the gravy I used the suggestions of using one can of cream of mushroom and I used about a half of can of golden mushroom soup with 3/4 cup of milk(I didn't use wine because I didn't have any) and sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms, I also added 1/2 of a chopped onion, one garlic clove and about a tablespoon of worchershire sauce which gave the gravy lots of flavor. I will be making this again, a very good Sunday dinner!

Baked pork chops with cream of mushroom soup was a favorite of mine growing up so I thought I would try a jazzed up version.  The pork chops themselves were very flavorful but I guess I'm not a huge fan of the wine.  We used a wonderful tasting white wine and it over powered the rest of the flavors.  Even after additional cooking all we tasted was the wine.

Our family totally liked the dish as prepared. I think that if you change more than the one or two ingredients it would be more appreciated if you submitted your Own recipe and reviewed the posted dish As Is. I see some reviews with 5 or more changes..that is no longer the same recipe.. and is somewhat insulting to the original poster's labor of love.

Tender meat, but lacks flavor.  Preperation and cooking time is not worth the final outcome.  I hate to be so negative, but I think most people are just too quick with the star power, that it makes it hard to get honest reviews from this site.  There are a lot of pork chop recipes here.  Next time I'll try one of the other 500 4 1/2 star recipes..and so on, until I find one I truly like.

This is a great recipe! By far, the best recipe for pork on this site. I made it exactly as directed, except I used 2t garlic salt instead of garlic  powder and salt. I served it w/applesauce and red & green bell peppers (fresh) with perogies (frozen) sauted in butter

Not a big fan of pork, but gave this a four because if i have to eat it, this is the way to go!  Followed the recipe only adding a little extra wine as suggested by many.  Since we were serving eight we bumped it up to 1 cup.  Also made the cream of mushroom soup instead of using canned.

This recipe is divine!!! For those who don't like the idea of using canned soup - you can just make your own mushroom roux by mixing equal parts butter and flour (2TBS butter & 2TBS flour) to a sauce pan over med-low heat with a whisk and then whisking in some milk or cream (1/2 cup to a cup depending on how thin/thick you want your sauce) and a can of button mushrooms. If you want less salt, use unsalted butter :) I thought this recipe was amazing and because I'm a big fan of wine I threw in some extra :)

This was a great recipe, thought it took a really long time to make. I think I could have left out the breading part and still had roughly the same results. My husband and sis-n-law loved it though! The wine sauce was nicely rich and comforting but i may leave out some of the mushrooms next time, as they were a little potent for me.

My chops came out juicy and wonderful.  Instead of Italian seasoned bread, which I did not have, I used Italian croutons and crushed them up.   Next time I will use a little more seasoning.  This was an fantastic  dish.

I've never been able to make a moist pork chop ... tonight I did it!  I fried for about 4 min each side, follow other reviewers and stick close as my chops turned crispy quick.  I then threw them in the oven for just 30 min covered with foil.  Following other review suggestions, I warmed the sauce on the cooktop and simply reversed the wine and milk as I love the taste that white wine gives.  And yes always be sure to cook with a wine you love to drink, makes the dish that more enjoyable!  Overall huge success, only reason I didn't rate it a 5 star is that my hubbie and I eat very few hearty meals such as this!

Made this recipe tonight and it was delicious.  Very moist and tender pork chops.  The only changes I made was to make a milk gravy for the topping as I am not a big fan of mushroom soup.  Also cooked for 45 minutes then added gravy and cooked an additional 15 minutes.  Will definitely make this again and again

Made this per the recipe, except doubled the sauce and used one cream of mushroom and one golden mushroom soup.  My husband and I didn't think the breading on the meat adding anything positive (just ended up as mush). But thought that the sauce was very good.  Next time we'll grill the pork and prepare the sauce on the side.

Absolutely the best pork chops I have ever eaten and super easy. I recommended this on facebook just now after having it for dinner last night! Perfect and so delicious and I am usually hard to please. My DH and I had to split the last chop. Make. Eat. Yum. But definitely keep in mind that it will be in the oven for a loooong time so start with plenty of time. :) God bless and happy eating!

Great recipe.  I double the sauce and use one can of cream of chicken with the cream of mushroom, and add dashes of paprika to the sauce and seasoning.  I serve over brown rice.

AWESOME! I followed the recipe using full sauce and the full amount of garlic and seasoning salt but only two pork chops for the two of us. Did add 1/2 c. Chardonny,  and 1/2 c. skim milk[that's all I had.] To think I have found another delicious recipe after all my years of collecting and experimenting-is exciting! Thanks so much for sharing. UPDATE:Last night my husband spotted pork chops and was elated that we were to have fried ones[I was planning on him grilling them], so I decided to use this recipe to fry without sauce. OUT OF THIS WORLD!

Wish I would have listened to other reviewers and added golden mushroom soup. I only used reg cream of mushroom. I thought it was bland, not bad just not the recipe everyone was raving about. =(

These pork chops turned out so good, my husband and I both loved them!  I used stove top stuffing crushed up instead of Italian flavor bread crumbs because that was all I had and I used 3/4 cup of milk instead of adding the wine to the sauce.  We had them with potatoes and the gravy was excellent.  It was a good night to try this recipe because we ended up with surprise company, and they loved them as well!

Just made this for dinner tonight.  Here are my notes: - Forgot the flour (oops!) - With other reviewers recommendations about letting frying a little longer, I didn't pay quite as much attention to this portion as I should have.  Ended up with a few blackened chops (another oops!) - Maybe it was because I forgot the flour, but I ended up throwing away at least a whole cup of bread crumbs. Next time I think I’ll measure out less and add more if I need to. - I did a quality check on the gravy before adding it to the chops, wasn’t a big fan, so thankfully I had another can of cream of mushroom and tried one reviewer’s suggestion of substituting the wine with chicken broth.  LOVED the result.  Baked for 45 minutes then added the gravy and put back in the oven for 15 more.  I think if I make it again I'll actually warm the gravy separately and just add it on at the end.  Overall, it was REALLY yummy.  Definitely a perfect dish for company since you can put it in the oven and clean the kitchen before everyone arrives!

Very good! make sure the oil is good and hot prior to frying. I did crisp up a little longer prior to baking. very good. I had no white on hand so had to use red wine. taste was still great but the colour of my gravey was a little strange from the red wine) Also added fresh mushrooms fried up in the wine. YUM YUM

I've tried this recipe twice.  The only thing I changed was to cook the chops longer before baking.  Both times the breading was soggy and came off the chops.  The flavors are good and the chops are tender.  However, I just do not see the point after the breading comes off and you are left with naked chops, a good sauce with soggy pieces of breading mixed in.

I would give this a 4.5 rating if i could.  Yummy and easy! I cooked 4 pork chops, 40 minutes all together and the last twenty with the sauce.  I really enjoyed this recipe and my boyfriend did too.  I liked the sauce but i think i could def. improve it.  Next time i will saute some onions and garlic and threw in there.. and maybe some extra spices.  Like others said the pork chops were VERY TENDER and mine were juicey!  This one I will def. make again.. I am looking forward on Improving IT!  Great base recipe! THank you!

Delicious!!!!!!!!!breaded mine with crushed wheat thins(cream cheese & chives)because i didnt have bread crumbs.I doubled the sauce. I forgot to put the seasoning on the meat, so i put it in with the grilled onions and mushrooms in a same pan as i did the chops and topped the meat with them and then the sauce. I baked them for 30 min first, then 20 min with sauce on top. Great!!!

I LOVE this recipe! I did change a few things...I fried the pork chops in the oil until the were nice & crispy, to sear in the juices. I've made this twice - once w/just cream of mushroom, and once w/ golden mushroom & cr. of mushroom, and it is MUCH BETTER w/ the golden mushroom mixed in! It gives it a much richer flavor! In a seperate skillet, I cooked one piece of bacon, then removed to crumble, and sauteed some chopped onion and fresh mushrooms in the bacon grease. (I also added some fresh garlic in the last few minutes of cooking) I crumbled the bacon pieces into the onion/mushroom mixture, and added it to the soup mixture. I believe I reduced the cooking time to 30 or 35 minutes also...these are WONDERFUL!! Serve w/ corn & mashed potatoes for a PERFECT dinner~

My husband liked this dish. I only baked 30 minutes adding the soup mixture halfway through. I found that the chops were cooked well enough at only 30 minutes. I served with mashed potatoes and used the extra sauce as a gravy. Yes, there were a lot of dishes and that was the worst part but I will make this one again.

This is the second time making this dish, I have to say this is the best way to make chops! My husband who normally hates pork chops because they are usually dry loves them even my picky son cleaned his plate. The only thing I added was cayenne pepper to the flour to give it a zing ! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I think the bake time should vary by how long you brown the pork chops and how thick they are. I think I over cooked them. It had a good flavor but they were a little dry. I may try it again and change a few things.

Just lovely! I made as is with a side of potatoes and was very satisfied, this was just what I was looking for to enhance a plain pork chop! I couldn't find golden mushroom, but if I do I  will definitely give it a try. I love the sauce as is though. Thanks for sharing :)

Just made it tonight and even my picky 4 year old had seconds. Kept the recipe as is EXCEPT I sauteed some mushrooms with a little bit of pepper in the same pan as the porkchops(when they came out--left the little bits of crust in the pan)and added it to the sauce. Also I only cooked for 1 hour--pouring the soup mixture on after 30 minutes. That was MORE then enough time. I'm not sure what would have happened had I left them in there another 30 minutes.

This recipe was soooooo good! I would do it just as the recipe says, its so tender and we had it with rice and some Lima beans (not always easy to find something that I like with Lima beans) I also made some homemade applesauce and it was a super tasty meal.  I will make again for sure :)

Wonderful! I used thin porkchops to cut down on the cooking time and eyeballed all the ingredients. Served with mashed potatoes and veggies. Husband said it looked like something you eat dining out and kept going back for more. Will definitely make again!

I was really excited to try this based on the reviews, but I was careful to read all the other reviews first (there are always great tips to "perfecting" the recipe).  I am giving this four stars and not five because of the gravy/sauce.  Otherwise, the pork chops alone would get 5 stars! Baking time was way less than the recipe states, by the way. The gravy needed A LOT of work . . . boy, was it bland & flavorless!!! In addition to the mushroom soup, I added a can of golden mushroom (like others suggested), a dash of parsley, seasoning salt, garlic powder, sage, and thyme.  I still felt like it could've been improved more, but on the other hand I'm never "fully satisfied" with any recipe!!  Anyways, I would definitely make it again--my husband LOVED it & always says, "Country cookin' makes you good lookin'."

This was REALLY good.  One of the chops never made it to the oven :-)  Frying it  was heaven so I snuck one for myself. I don't drink so buyiny wine was out of the question so it was omitted, but to be honest it was still a great dish that will be maid from now on! I don t know what the other people are talking about it not being good. 5 stars!!!

These were excellent. Did the way the recipe said, but I diced up a small onion, and threw in some sliced mushrooms. When I went to put the gravy in with the chops; I had a lot of juice from them, which is good, it gave me more gravy. Will make these again.

I'm giving this 5 stars based on my husband's reaction to this recipe. I have never liked pork because it has never had any flavor.. just bland and blah. This however had tons of flavor! I've never cooked anything that my husband wouldn't stop talking about for the rest of the evening. Everyone who happened to call him that night he would rave about it to them! I followed the recipe to a "T" except I used only 4 chops (all I had) & added to the rest of the ingredients a can of golden mushroom. As for my review I'd give it 3 1/2 stars... I didn't care for the wine taste (I used Chardonnay). Maybe if I can find a wine w/o such a sweet taste to it I'd like it. Next time I will try it w/o the wine all together. The texture was great and the meat was so incredibly tender, we couldn't even take it out of the dish without it falling apart!!! Great recipe!

Wow, was this delicious! My kids normally hate pork chops and these were so tender that they thought it was chicken and RAVED over how good it was! I didn't correct their assumption on the type of meat, they ate it, loved it and I was ecstatic. I only made a couple of small changes, one out of necessity and the other for personal taste reasons. Instead of using bread crumbs (because I didn't have any as I thought), I used stove top and just crushed it a little more for better consistency, and it gave it a really good flavor. As I was cooking the chops in the EVOO, I added some minced garlic for a little extra flavor and I doubled the sauce because my family are big "dipping" people. I can't tell you just how good this tasted and how easy it was to make. The sauce was divine and the chops were so tender you could eat it using a spoon if so desired!

4 Stars as written, 5 stars after doubling the sauce ingredients and using 1 can reg cream mushroom and 1 can golden mushroom. Note for those who state that the cooking time is too long, I believe that the orig recipe cook time was for bone-in pork chops (which I think is best with this recipe)

I am going to try these again some day.  Maybe it was my oven or maybe the recipe is supposed to be made with a bone-in pork chop, mine were so dry.  Next time I will probably cut the cooking time down.

wow and OMG...I changed this slightly...I used 4 pork chops w/o bones.  I smashed up oyster crackers for the breading.  I added some freshly sauteed mushrooms and herbs de provence to the gravy and used heavy cream and milk and white wine. I added some freshly grated black pepper.  Then I baked the chops for 30 mins then added the gravy and baked another 30 mins.  I cut up some red potatoes and put them in a skillet in olive oil, added some white wine, herbs de provence and a little finely chopped onion and a dab of dijon mustard.  The potatoes with the chops and gravy were excellent.  i look forward to serving this to guests.

This recipe was great! I cut the recipe to fit 4 boneless pork chops.  I did a total cooking time of 45 minutes and that was enough.  The pork chops were moist and delicious!  I will be making this again.

Excellent! Very tender and favorful. I took others' advice: added Golden Mushroom soup and extra milk accordingly, substituted chicken stock for wine, and cooked for 30 minutes without sauce, then poured sauces over and cooked another 10 and let sit in warm oven til we were ready to eat. Good weeknight shortcut on making my own mushroom sauce. Thanks for sharing this!

Delicious!  Made it exactly as written - baked it for 50 minutes instead of the recommended 60.  Prep was easy, but you've got to plan ahead because it takes about 2 hours from start to table.  HUGE hit, such a hit it only served 3 rather than 6 so definitely make extras.

I made this for my family and everyone loved it.  Even my 12 year old son who is not a big meat eater raved about this.  He liked the tenderness of the pork and the flavorful sauce.  I did change up the recipe because I felt the bread crumbs would not incorporate into the sauce.  I seasoned chops with salt, garlic powder, paprika and black pepper, then dipped the seasoned chops in milk, then into the flour and browned very well on each side.  To the sauce I added one can of cream of celery and increased wine slightly to 1/2 cup.  Also, I think baking an additional hour after putting the sauce on will give more tender chops but 30 minutes was okay too.  The longer it cooks for the more tender it will be.

I had high hopes for this recipe due to the high ratings, but we didn't like it at all. The pork was moist, but overall bland and the batter was really soggy. I will not be making this again.

I won't go into details but this recipe is perfect because you can alter it slightly and get amazing (but slightly different) chops every time. Only suggestion I always follow is making the sauce separately. My boyfriend's favorite food is pork, and I hate pork - but I actually like this recipe! Therefore it's become our staple:). The way I usually make the sauce is this though: 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can beef broth, cut mushrooms, a little bit (not a whole pack) of onion soup mix, and some Wondra or flour to thicken it up. Yum!

D-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s! This was very good. My kids even liked it...which is rare.I didn't have an 1 1/2 hrs to make this, so i browned them good and turned the oven up to 375 and baked them for about 30 minutes. I heated the cream of mushroom gravy mixture and poured that on top during the last few minutes of baking. It was great. You don't need all that time to cook this. Great recipe. Thanks.

These are the best pork chops! Exactly like my mom always made and now I make for my family. Tender and the sauce is so good with mashed potatoes.You will want to use two cans of cream of mushroom soup if making five or six chops and make sure to brown the breading on the chops to a deep brown. Makes a big difference in taste!

This was very good-- with some adjustments.  First of all, if you don't like wine (like me, but I thought I would give it a try), 1/3 C completely overpowered the sauce.  In the future, I would omit the wine or substitute broth instead.  I also used golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom (also apprehensively since I HATE mushrooms, but it didn't taste like mushrooms at all!).  My final change to the sauce was adding some garlic powder and ground black pepper.  Next time, I might decrease the liquid in the sauce-- it was a little runny-- or add some cornstarch.  It was the perfect amount of sauce for four pork chops.  The only other change I made was to drastically reduce the cooking time.  I browned the chops in oil for about 1 min each side over high heat, then baked the chops alone for fifteen minutes, then baked covered in sauce for twenty-five, and they were wonderfully juicy and tender!

This was really good, although I oversalted with BOTH Lawry's AND garlic salt.  I definitely needed more sauce, I will double it next time.  I mixed my sauce on the stovetop and added about 2 cups fresh mushrooms, which were an awesome addition at the end.  The breading was completely falling off of the chops, all slimy, so I probably did something wrong?  I really want to make this again so if someone can give me tips as to the sogginess, it would be appreciated.  I had initally fried them up really well, so I didn't know what I did wrong.

This was very good.  I doubled the sauce as others suggested and I am glad I did.  Otherwise I wouldn't have had enought sauce for the noodles I served with it.  I sauted the onion for a couple of minutes in olive oil and then added fresh sliced mushrooms and about 2t of minced garlic and sauted for another 3 minutes or so.  After placing the pork chops in a baking dish, I put the mushrooms and onions on top and then covered with the mushroom/wine sauce.

I have been making this recipe for ages and just now decided to write a review. It is one of my favorites. I sometimes add onions and veggies, which tastes great with it. Also, I have a milk allergy and can consume very little dairy. So if you leave out the milk and replace it with water, the recipe still tastes the same. Overall, this is one of the best!

I made these pork chops and really enjoyed them.    Due to lack of ingredients, I made a few modifications:  To extend the "gravy", I added canned Turkey gravy to the cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have golden mushroom soup as others had suggested.    I also didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I substituted a house-brand equivalent of shake-n-bake.  Shaking the coating on in a bag also slightly reduced the "messiness factor" associated with prepping this recipe.  I used more garlic powder than the recipe called for, and on the advice of others, I added onions because we enjoy our garlic and onions here.  Also added parsley and paprika based on the comments of others, but I am not sure if I would include them next time.  Or maybe I would skip just the paprika.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I still prefer my pork chops grilled on the BBQ. Not only are they less fattening that way, but also they are considerably less messy to prepare. However, BBQ'ing them doesn't yield the lovely gravy that comes with this recipe.

My wife and kids loved this recipe, but I thought it was bland. I was missing something, but I don't know what. I added some fresh ground pepper which gave it more flavor, but covered up the wine flavor instead of bringing it out. It was good enough to make again, and next time I might try flashing a pan and deglazing with wine, so I can add more wine flavor to the recipe.

These were awesome!  I am not a fan of pork chops, but in effort to try and incorporate more pork in our diet, I gave it a try.  Like most people, I changed it a bit.  I excluded using the egg/flour and just dipped the pork chops in milk first.  I also used red wine as opposed to white.  Yum and the family LOVED it!  Thank you!

I looked up this recipe for baked pork chops with a rice casserole in mind. So I somewhat followed the recipe (as others did I cut back on the baking to 25/20) but cooked a boil-in-bag rice pack for 5 minutes before adding it under the chops and gravy and finished baking for 20 minutes.  No wine on hand so added 1/3 cup onion soup out of the can.  Will get the wine next time but this hit the spot.  I like rice and gravy dishes and this was a nice way to use pork chops.

Yummy!  Family loved this recipe and prayed for leftovers, which is unheard of.  Generally they refuse to eat left overs, so when they said they hoped there was some left over it was music to my ears.  I've been making this every couple weeks since.

Really great flavor, but too many steps.  It's not a difficult recipe, but once you fry the pork chops and get them in the oven, it is still another hour before you can eat.  I did bake 30 minutes without the gravy and then 30 minutes with gravy, and it was plenty.  Double the gravy and shouldn't have done that, there was really too much.  My picky husband loved it, though, so definitely four stars.

Wonderful... however I did not have any breadcrumbs so I crushed saltine crackers and added Italian seasoning to them... loved the taste! I have even used this to make pork tenderloin sandwiches without the mushroom sauce.

Excellent!  The only thing I did differently was that I didn't bake them.  I didn't have 1 1/2 hours to wait on them to cook in the oven so I just fried until they were done and I put the sauce in a pot on the stove and then poured over the pork.  Definitely a keeper and one I will make again!  Hubby LOVED it!

Oh my snickerdoodles was this good! I've been craving it ever since. Here's the changes I made to accomodate what I already had in the house: -crushed seasoned croutons instead of bread crumbs -sauted onions in the pan after I took the chops out and deglazed with the wine. then mixed all the soup stuff together in the pan and simmered to thicken a bit -increased wine by about 1/4 cup -Used Sawmill Creek Dry White Served with mashed potatoes and it was so good. This has now become my top pork chop recipe. UPDATE: Recently made this recipe again using bread crumbs as the recipe directed and while they were still good, they just didn't measure up to the ones I have made using crushed "Caesar" croutons. The croutons stay quite crisp, even with the sauce where as the bread crumbs got very soggy. Will always use crushed croutons from now on. Croutons also add a lot of extra flavour.

My family loved these, and my fiance is not a big pork chop fan.  I did not have cream of mushroom, so I just used golden mushroom soup and added a little milk and cornstarch and wisked together in a small bowl.  I also baked @ 325, for 20-25 minutes longer then suggested (I was running behind that night :) I think I actually preferred it this way.  Very moist and tender, even the next day re-heated

This was great! My boyfriend and I made this as our "last meal" before starting our New Year's resolution, and it did not disapoint! Before I baked in the oven, I put the porkchops over wild rice and topped with the cream of mushroom soup. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

I was not impressed with this recipe. It was not bad, but far from great. The cook time was too long. My pork chops turned out dry. I chose a really lean cut, so maybe that was the reason.  Won't be trying this again.

While these were good, they were not at all the awesome tasting pork chops I was hoping for (and everyone was raving about). Made these for dinner last night. I "mostly" followed Dawn's recipe to a T EXCEPT for these modifications: a) halved the recipe (used 3 thick, top-loin chops), b) prepared enough gravy for 6 chops as directed, c) slightly modified the milk/wine ratios (less milk, more pinot noir), d) added 1 minced shallot (had one I needed to use up) and 1.5 cloves of minced garlic to the soup mixture and e) browned the chops really well, then added to a greased baking dish, poured soup mixture over all and baked, covered for 35 minutes (I was short on time). My bf liked these, but said they had a "cream of mushroom soup" taste. This was a filling meal served alongside garlic mashed potatoes and corn. I don't think I'll be adding this to my recipe collection. I prefer to make mushroom sauce baked pork chops (by JHILGENB) on this site (which doesn't taste anything like canned soup on chops IMHO). Thanks for sharing!

This turned out wonderful.  I found a recipe for homemade Italian bread crumbs (http://rouxbe.com/recipes/1499/text), just in case you don't have time to run to the store.  They turned out wonderfully, and I actually didn't add the salt since there was already seasoned salt on the pork chops.  I will definitely make this again for my boyfriend!

I prepared this recipe just as written.  Was really good.  I plan to make it over Christmas for family that visiting.
Highly recommend this one.
I've never made pork chops that I liked until this recipe.
Thanks,
?Joy

DELICIOUS!!  Today was exceptionally cold for us -20 so this was an excellent choice to make: warm & hearty & filling!  I was nervous about my 10 year old & 4 year old liking the sauce, but they LOVED IT!!  This one is DEFINITELY a keeper & will be made in our house again.  I didn't change anything from the recipe & the porkchops had great flavor & the breading was nice & crisp.  I made sure my olive oil was hot before putting the pork chops in so that they could get a nice crunchy coat on them prior to baking & they were perfect!

I made this for my picky husband and kids and it was a winner!!  The only sub I made was Cream of Chicken instead of Mushroom because they hate mushrooms and I used a chardonnay.  I made 8 pork chops and doubled the ingreadients for the sauce.  Served it with homemade macaroni and cheese (on this site) and vegetable medley.  The pork chops were so tender you didn't need a knife!  I highly recommend this recipe.

Very good meal. You have to double the gravy recipe! Not enough. Do not substitute the wine either, you will lose a kick to the gravy. My husband said this is a keeper!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  It's so flavorful and easy to make.  It's a little on the salty side for my husband so I just use less.  I make it many times a month, it's one of the few things that the kids even enjoy.

This is our favorite recipe ever!!! This is the BEST pork chops recipe I have ever tried.  Yum Yum Yum!  I've never been particularly fond of pork chops before but they're always on sale where I shop so I set out on a mission to find a recipe that my fiance and I would love and THIS IS IT!  Hats off to the chef!

The flavors are outstanding and the meat was fork tender! Saved this one to the recipe box! I added the gravy only near the end to try to preserve some of the crispness of the crust.

Very tender, I used the thick pork chops, took a little longer to cook.  All I had was chicken condensed soup so used that.  When it's time to add that mixture to the pork chops I would suggest draining the pan you dont' need all that oil.  This is a good recipe for tender pork chops.  Thank you for sharing this!

YUM! This was easy to make the the pork chops came out so tender. The only suggestion I would make is to definately go with a little extra garlic & cayenne pepper like other readers suggested. The pork chops were tasty but could of used that extra zest. I will definately make it again!

Very good flavor- very moist chops. I just didn't care for how the breading slid off the chops when I cut into them. Maybe next time, I will serve the sauce on the side and not bake the chops in it. The sauce was very good over mashed potatoes, too.

This recipe was great!! Some of the breading did come off the bottom though. I used golden mushroom soup instead...I simply prefer it over cream of mushroom. My husband loved this, but my son did not. Shocking huh?!!

Delicious. I made a couple changes; I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of golden mushroom soup. I doubled the milk and white wine since I used 2 cans of soup. I only cooked the chops for an hour in the oven. They were fantastic!

This was very good and I followed some tips from the reviews here - which is why ALL RECIPES is the best site for recipes!!  I did mix up the sauce in the saucepan to reduce cooking time and put the sauce on the pork chops for the last 10 minutes--I only cooked my pork chops for a half an hour.  My husband said the sauce was good, I did not like it at all.  Will make the pork chops again, but will try some other sauce.

OMG!! Awesome, was soooo good! Just finished dinner and couldn't wait to get on here and rate this recipe. Followed recipe, and did fry till crispy brown on both sides of the chop. These are so tender, I was amazed at how good they are. I did use Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic, and that could make a difference on the flavor. I also made mashed potatos (added fresh garlic in the water to give it more flavor and it worked). I wish I could give it more stars. Will make this one again! Thanks!

This is easy, delicious, tender and very juicy! If you like pork chops, you should try this recipe. Its just PERFECT. I used a good pinot griggio wine and indeed it makes the difference! One comment about the wine, if you won't drink it, then don't use it! This is a keeper.

This pork was very tender. I did not bake it as long because it was pretty well cooked from frying. The wine was added great flavor and definately made this stand apart.

Thought this had great flavor!  My husband loved it.  I cut two slices off the end of a tenderloin, sprinkled with suggested seasonings to taste and followed directions.  As suggested, I heated up the soup with 3/4 cup of milk, omitting the wine.  By the time it finished cooking, the gravy was perfect for two.  Served over noodles with a side dish of green beans.

I followed the recipe except I doubled the amount of sauce so that we would have gravy for the mashed potatoes that I served them over.  I also added 1 sliced onion and 1 pkg. of sliced mushrooms, sauteed them and added to the sauce before baking.  The pork chops were fork tender and the taste was wonderful!  I also just used the cheap white cooking wine and it was very tasty.

VERY TENDER PORK CHOPS!!! Next time I would use LESS SALT. The only modifications I did was adding 2 beef boulion cubes (to offset the cream of mushroom taste) onion powder, garlic powder, minced onion, and to my mistake garlic salt. I made a double batch of the sauce which ended up over powering the meal.

This was pretty tasty. I agree with other reviewers, does not need so long in the oven. I prepared the chops as described, and then put them in the oven for 30 minutes. I mixed up the sauce in a saucepan and preheated it, so I could reduce the remaining baking time to 15 minutes. The internal temp of the chops was at 155 at 30 minutes, so it was basically fully cooked then (just needs to hit 160). The chops had a great comfort food taste, and the sauce was really delicious. I served it over a wild rice blend. The only problem I had was the chops were a little tough. Perhaps that is my fault, if I had cooked for the whole 1.5 hours, with the last hour in the sauce, maybe they would have softened up. I was worried, though, that any further cooking would over cook them.

Sure makes them nice and tender.  Works better with thinner chops rather than the extra thick.  They tended to dry out for me.

This was delicious! I used half the chops, but kept the sauce the same. If you use the full amount of meat, definitely double the sauce! I ended up making the sauce a few days in advance (in a sauce pan separately) and by the time I made the chops, the sauce had definitely improved in flavor. I had also added sauteed onions, mushrooms and a few dashes of cayenne. I baked the fried chops for 40 mins. Served with rice, poured the gravy on the side - fantastic! Will definitely make again.

I took the advice to add a little more white wine.  We were short on time, so I just browned the pork chops, heated the soup mixture and poured it over the chops and baked covered with foil for 30 minutes (cutting cooking time by 1 hour).  They were delish!  The gravy was a little thin, which I'm sure would thicken with the extra time.  Next time I will put them in the crockpot for about 4 hours on low after browning.  Definately a keeper!  this one could really be a crowd-pleaser, so easy, so yummy.

By itself the recipe was okay, probably will have to play around with the recipe to tweak it. However, I'm saving this because the sauce makes an EXCELLENT base for pork stew. I made more meat than I could eat so the next day I chopped up some potatoes and carrots and the leftover pork and made a terrific stew with the leftover sauce (added water of course to thin it out).

This was my first time making pork chops and I think the quality of the chops I used was poor.  I spent more time cutting the fat off than I did eating.  Other than that the recipe was very good.

I had basically given up on cooking pork chops because I couldn't find a good recipe.  This is it.  I loved this and made it just as the recipe indicated.  I cut the recipe in half using 3 Pork Rib Chops Center Cut with bone which were about 3/4" thick.  Frying the pork chops in my cast iron skillet worked really well.  I did however, make a full recipe of the gravy which seemed like the right amount for 3 pork chops.  I was worried about the long baking time, but I followed it and they turned out great. This has definitely made it to my recipe collection.

Very easy . I added fresh mushrooms to the "left overs" in the pan after frying the pork chops in olive oil. The mushrooms added more texture and flavor . I suggest "beefing up" the breading which also adds more flavor to the chops.  If you want left overts make sure to double the gravy, I tripled. Thanks for a great recipe !

I used 4 pork chops, seasoned with garlic powder and black pepper.  1/4 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream chicken due to the fact that we are not mushroom people  I didn't have any wine in the house so I used a little more milk and added 1 package of brown gravy mix.  I also added pepper and salt to the gravy.  I live in the deep south you can't have fried pork chops without gravy!  Overall wonderful recipe!

Great recipe! We made it tonight and loved it.  We did not have the condensed cream of mushroom or chicken soup or wine to make any kind of sauce so I prepared the pork chops as directed, baked for only 30 minutes (b/c they were boneless and not that thick), and made pork chop gravy from a gravy packet I had on hand to put on the chops after baking.  The pork turned out wonderful.  Can't wait to try this with the soup and wine sauce next time!

I've made these twice now and they are awesome! I usually add some minced garlic even with the garlic powder and some red pepper flakes. Last time I made this I sliced some mushrooms and onions and put them over the chops then the sauce over it all and it was wonderful!

This recipe was amazing!  
The only adjustment we made was not cooking it for quite so long....After frying the chops for 5 minutes per side, we put them in the baking dish, added the sauce, and covered it with foil.  Baked for 15 minutes, then took foil off and baked for another 15 minutes.
I truly think that a total cook time of 1.5 hours would have been way too much.
The chops were wonderfully juicy and perfect.
They are awesome the next day too! :)

I made this and followed the recipe but added a can of Golden Mushroom soup and some additional wine because we like the gravy.  It was exceptional.  I cooked it the full 1 and 1/2 hours and the pork chops were tender and juicy.  Definately a good recipe, easy and great for company.

This was very good.  After reading some of the other reviews I did end up doubling the sauce.  For the sauce, I upped the wine and reduced the milk, used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can golden mushroom and sauted onion, mushrooms and fresh garlic in the same pan I cooked the pork in.  My only mistake - I made the sauce in the same pan that I did the pork and veggies in and the leftover olive oil may have dulled the flavor somewhat.  I would recommend doing the sauce in a different pan, even though it creates another dish to wash.  I also browned the heck out of my pork chops and cut my oven time down to 40 minutes.  Tasty tasty! Thanks for a great recipe!!

First off this was a very good easy meal idea. I starting making this dish before I read all the way through the recipe and didn't realize it said bake for an hour and half! There is no need to do that. What I did: breaded and fried the chops until golden brown they were pretty much done at the point then I put them in the oven with the soup sauce on top of it as recipe says. I did up the oven to 375 and 25 minutes later they were done. I also suggest using thick cut bone in chops otherwise they will be very dry. Over all very good.

This is by far the BEST baked chops recipe i have found! The chops are so moist they just fall apart. I only add one thing, about a 1/4 c. Zesty Italian Dressing to the egg mixture, it gives it a nice flavor.

This is delicious! My mother is always talking about how she can never get her pork chops tenders but these are! I even used boneless pork chops. I only added sauteed onions and mushrooms to the sauce. That was the only change. This is be a in the regular rotation.

I wasn't planning on changing this, but I wound up making a lot of changes.  I combined the flour and bread crumbs along with garlic, oregano and basil - and put the pork into the egg first and then into the mixture.

After removing the pork from the frying pan, I added oil, a tsp of butter, a little white wine, 1 chopped onion and some chopped celery and simmered until the pork was done.

Instead of cream of mushroom, I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery.  I put the two into a pot along with the milk and wine and cooked on the stove on low while the pork was in the oven.

After 25 minutes, I covered the pork in the sauce and the onion and celery mixture I made and put it back in the oven (covered) for 15 minutes.

DELICIOUS!

This wasn't so great for us. I found the mushroom soup/wine mix made a sour tasting sauce. The breaded meat stayed tender and had nice colour but not a lot of flavour dispite the seasonings.
Thanks anyway.

Simple enough and definitely moist. Not a huge fan of the cream of mushroom soup, except when it is doctored up. So I decided to try this one. The only thing that made it for me was the white wine addition, but I am glad I only went with 1/4 cup. It was just right.   Personally I think the cooking time is too long. I did mine for 45 minutes, and I had thick chops. Don't expect the bread crumbs to stay crisp. But they do add some body to dish. If I make this again it will need to have a little more doctoring for me. Like maybe some garlic and more mushrooms.

OK, my 15-yr-old son actually said it was - and I quote - "DELICIOUS"... added the extra can of condensed mushroom with three cloves of fresh garlic, served with side of cranberry stuffing. This one is a keeper!

Great recipe, agreeably time-consuming, but worth it. I seasoned 6 thick boneless chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder, and seasoned the flour with more garlic and adobo criollo. I doubled the sauce, using one can of cream of mushroom and one can of golden mushroom, as someone else suggested and served it with mashed potatoes. I was very happy with the results - chops were tender, moist, and had a wonderful flavor.

This recipe is killer! After reading other reviews I was worried about the breading being too soggy, and the meat too dry, but I still followed the recipe almost exact. I only changed by using cream of chicken soup because I didn't have mushroom in the house. The end result was full of flavor, and the meat only required a fork to cut! I recommed not subing the wine like others did. Makes for a fabulous flavor! Used pork medallions, which looked not too great when I bought them on sale, but turned out to be perfect for this dish! This recipe takes away the strong pork flavor that I'm not too fond of. Will definately make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!  I am not a huge fan of pork chops but these were the best I have ever had!  These came out so tender that my three young children were able to cut them with a fork.  My husband, who LOVES pork asked for these to be put into regular rotation.  I made the reciep exactly as stated but when I make it again I will double the sauce ingredients so I have enough to put on mashed potatoes.  Thank you for posting.

TERRIFIC recipe! this is really the best pork chops i've had in a long time. I was delighted at how moist these turned out. I've always had a problem with my chops turning out dry, no matter what i do.
I didn't have wine on hand so i omitted that, and I only had cream of mushroom with garlic.
really, really delicious! Definitely a keeper!

This was just ok, didn't think it had much flavor.  I omitted the wine (personal preference), maybe that was the problem.  Probably won't be making again.

Ok...straight Grandma's house!! These were awesome. My girlfriend and I are sitting right now and I don't think we are moving anytime soon. We followed the recipe pretty much to a T. However, we added about 1/4 cup of flour (to thicken it a little more) into the gravy and heated it through before we poured it over the chops. You don't even need a knife for this one, just bring a fork. Accompanied it with Mashed Potatoes and used the extra gravy for on top of them. This makes a great Sunday recipe because once you prep and start baking you can do whatever else you need to do around the house. I can't wait to make these again!!!!!!

Yummy; everyone loved it including my teen & my 5 year old. I took the advice of some others and fried it on med/high until golden brown. I baked for 35 minutes instead of the hour, doubled the soup using the mushroom w/garlic version & put more dry white wine than I did milk. I wanted enough gravy to pour over mashed potatoes and it came out delicious & w/the extra gravy I wanted...double YUM! This is a keeper!

This was an excellent and very easy recipe, I followed it with a little bit of adjustment on my part, I seasoned the pork chop to my liking before adding the breading. It was thumbs up from my husband because he cleaned his plate. This will be a staple in my home, thanks for the great recipe

This was delish!  I made it without the white wine, and it was really, really good.  The extra time it takes to make this dish is 100% worth it.  Thanks for the recipe!  This is my go-to pork chop dish!

My husband said give it more than 5 stars.  This was totally awesome.  He bought chops that weren't that great.  You know how they put a couple nice ones on top then underneath they are more like pork steak...well I was so dissapointed in the meat, but after using this recipe they were unbelieveable!!!  We can't wait to make them with a good cut of chops. They fell apart and the sauce was out of this world. Served with mashed potatoes and Yum to the Tum!!  One of the best recipes I have tried from this site. Thanks!

Since I am pregnant, I left out the cooking wine and used chicken broth instead. I mixed up the sauce on the stove and added sauted onion and garlic. Also, I agree with other reviewers- the pork chops can go from brown to char in a quick moment- watch them carefully. Also, my pork chops only took about 40 minutes in the oven. Overall, good recipe.

This is an easy and very good recipe for pork chops which could be adapted for chicken very easily.  I've made several times and made a couple of changes the last few times to make it easier and quicker.  First, I leave off the egg as it really isn't needed -  the Italian bread crumbs adhere quite well to the meat as long as you've properly heated your olive oil.  I used Golden Mushroom soup instead of  regular as a personal preference and deleted the milk.  I deglazed the pan with about 1/4 cup of wine and then added the soup and 1/3 cup of wine to the pan and finished cooking on the stove.  This method takes less  time and uses only one pan.  Total cooking time is 45 minutes vs 1.5 hrs.  No real difference in the taste.  The consistency of the sauce is more conducive to using as gravy when prepared on the stove.  Nice recipe.  Thanks for the post.

This is my new favorite pork chop recipe. I am usually not a fan of breaded meats, but this was awesome. Have made it several times now. It is very easy and pretty-much fail proof. Have made it with both cream of mushroom and cream of celery soups. It is much more flavorful with the cream of mushroom soup.

This was quite easy to make, and had a good taste.  I omitted the wine and replaced it with more milk.  I followed previous reviewers advice and didn't cook it for as long as the recipe calls for.  I only cooked it about 35 min. total. (about 20 without the sauce, 15 with)  Everyone liked it, from my 3 year old to my husband.

This has to be the best recipe for pork chops I've ever had.  I'm usually at a loss for cooking them-usually everything tastes the same.  But they came out tender, juicy and tasty-and way easy to make too. A HUGE hit in our house!  Thanks so much!

These were very good.  I love the way they just flake off the fork when you eat them.  They take a while, so make it on a night when you don't have anything going on!

This recipe is so good, I'm making it for Valentine's Day.  Last time it got a very enthusiastic response from my boyfriend.  

I did not deviate from the recipe except to add in fresh mushrooms and lots of black pepper.

Great comfort food!

Well, I'm sorry, but we did not like this recipe.  I read many of the reviews and I should have suspected something was not right when many of the people who said they did not like pork, liked this recipe.  It's true; it did not taste like pork chops at all.  One reviewer said it tasted like fried chicken steak, and I guess it did.  Unless you like soggy breading, I wouldn't bother to bread these.  I'm glad I fried onions and fresh mushrooms to put on top because at least that gave it some flavor.  I guess I won't ever be making this again.

Although I like potk chops I tried this with Turkey Chops instead. I live in Philadelphia, PA and they are big on turkey up here, i.e. turkey bacon, turkey sausage, turkey burgers etc. Anyway I followed the recipe exactly except I did use chicken broth rather than wine, I used a bigger can of Cream of Mushrooms and I also added my own mushrooms. I also heated the soup and other ingredients on top of the stove in a pan first then poured it over the chops. 

It turned out so GOOOOOOD! So flavorful, so tender and juicy! Just GREAT! The first time I made it, I made it for myself. The second time I made it, I made it for company he absolutely LOVED it! This was easy to make and easy clean up as well. I am going to make it with Pork chops tonight. I will report back with how it turn out. But for those of you who want an alternative to pork turkey chops is your way to go. I bought the "Turkey Hill" brand.

This is a very good recipe though I had to alter it a bit to suit my taste.  After frying, I only baked for 30 minutes.  As it was baking I sautéed sliced mushrooms in a bit of olive oil and butter and seasoned them with salt and pepper.  Then I added the white wine to deglaze the pan along with the cream of mushroom and milk.  I also added a bit of nutmeg and a splash of cayenne and let it reduce slightly over the stovetop.  I served it with a garnish of green onions. (I also doubled the sauce which was necessary to go with my garlic mashed potatoes.) Even my picky boys asked for more chicken ;)  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe.  My husband HATES pork chops.  So, I didn't tell him what it was until he was half way done eatting it.  He was very suprised.  
I didn't like the taste of the white wine so I added a can of cream of chicken soup and a heaping tablespoon of sour cream.  I heated soups and baked 40/30.
Very yummy, I will be making this again.

These are very tender and flavorful pork chops!  The only changes I made were to use 2 cans of cream of mushroom, mixed with 3/4 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of chicken broth (instead of the wine.)  I also mixed in some adobo seasoning, garlic salt and onion powder with the flour for additional flavor.  Per other reviewers, I cut the baking time down to 40 minutes and then baked for an additional 30 minutes with the sauce.  Very good recipe!

The first thing my husband said when he too his first bite was "this is my new favorite!!!" And just kept raving over it for the rest of the meal. I was very worried while making it because it just doesnt look very appitizing.  As i baked, about every 15 minutes i poured the sauce over the porkchops again and again.  
I served it with rice, and the gravy sauce was great over it!!  Good thing i doubled the amount, we didnt have any left over.

This was great!  Just what I was looking for...  I made it according to the recipe, except I only baked 35 minutes as other reviewers suggested, then the additional 30 with the gravy on top.  They were definately done.  Thanks for the recipe--I'll be making it again!!

Wow, I'm not a big pork chop fan, but these were great!  I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom,and cut down the cook time by half because I had thin chops.  My husband said that they were the most tender pork chops he'd ever had.  Definitely a keeper!

These were yummy!!  I am not a huge pork chop fan, but these had great flavor and were super moist.  Only difference that I made to the recipe was to slice fresh mushrooms and added to the soup mixture.
Will make again! Thanx.

This was delicious! It was extremely tender. The only thing I would suggest is to double the gravy. Otherwise, it was perfect!

YUM! This recipe is delicious, I used some pepper and cajun seasoning before breading the chops and did what other reviewers said and warmed the sauce seperately with extra garlic and chili powder served it up with some cous cous it was eaten up quickly!

Very good.  Not a huge fan of pork chops but I loved these.  I would also cook the sauce on the stovetop.  That keeps it from getting soggy.  And check the temp mine did not need as long as it said.

I thought the recipe was great, but the leftovers had too much of a bitter wine taste.  I'll make it again, but with a little less wine.

These were awesome!  They came out so tender & juicy, which is a hard thing to get a pork chop to do.  I don't keep wine on hand often, so I added a little extra milk and a few good splashes of worcestshire sauce.  I also used Jane's crazy salt in place of the seasoning salt, and seasoned the chops again with the janes crazy salt, some pepper, and garlic powder when they came out of the skillet before baking them.  I will definatly be making these again.

My family loved these pork chops.  I made only two changes which was using 3/4 cup milk instead of adding the wine and because I didn't have bread crumbs on hand I crushed Italian Herb & Cheese croutons for the breading.  Yummy!

This was easy to make and my husband loved it! I heated the mushroom soup mixture on the stove and poured it over the chops after they had been in the oven for about 15 minutes. I also reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes.

Very good.  I followed other advice and doubled sauce and added mushrooms before the sauce.  Impressive.  The sauce makes good gravy for mashed potatoes.

Awesome recipe.  The pork chops are so tender.  I didn't have white wine (but will use it next time!) so I subbed chicken broth.  I also did not need to bake for the full hour, however, it would not have hurt it any.  Served with mashed potatoes and butternut squash.

I liked it, my husband and kids did not. Chops are soggy but have very good flavor. Next time we will do the sauce by itself and pour over finished crisp chops.

Wonderful!  No need for a knife for these chops not even a butter knife.  Just falls apart!  I agree this is not a week night working mom recipe.  It takes a long time to cook and when you don't get off until 5 supper is too late.  Wonderful Sunday meal!

I would give this recipe 5 stars,except for the fact that,as another reviewer had mentioned,it is kind of time consuming to prepare. The chops were very tasty and tender,and very moist,but if I make them again I will plan more time for prep. Overall,a good recipe,just a little time consuming for a week night supper.

This was the best pork chop recipe I have tried...I browned them really good, then put them in the oven covered for 20 mins, uncovered and put the sauce on and cooked for another 20 mins...although i didn't have any wine, i just added more milk. They weren't crispy like they were when they had finished browning but they were still very juicy and good. I also cooked mushrooms to add to the sauce and added a little cayenne pepper to the bread crumbs to give it a little kick. Turned out really good! will defiantly use this recipe again. thanks!

I didn't find these fabulous, sorry. I think it would have helped to not cook them so long. I think an hour would hve done it. They were really chewy and didn't go over very well.

I followed this recipe to the *T*, and was not very impressed. The flavor was pretty good, but the chops just came out "mushy". I think if I were to try this again, I would not bread the pork chops.

These had very good flavor, however I think it's very important to watch the cooking time for the thickness of the pork chops you use  so they do not get dry.

Great, easy baked pork chop recipe without that "I dumped soup on it" flavor. The wine does make all the difference in the sauce, so don't omit it. It did take me about 1 hour 15 minutes to cook the boneless 1" thick chops through, and that may be because I didn't leave them in the pan to pre-brown for enough time. I think I cooked them too fast so the coating got black before the pork got any actual cooking. We also added a can of mushrooms to the sauce and really enjoyed the extra chunkiness. My husband loved this, and he is normally apprehensive about "soup and meat" dishes.

The chops were slightly dry and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  Not my favorite, but I will probably try again and decrease the time for cooking and use a meat thermometer.

This turned out excellent and was really delicious. I used turkey cutlets (we don't eat a lot of pork) and cream of celery soup because that is what we had. I also used chicken broth instead of the wine. The cooking time was significantly reduced because the turkey cutlets were pretty thin. I basically just heated them through in the oven and then poured the sauce over and baked it for about ten minutes. I will definitely be making this again! I served it will mashed potatoes and peas...YUM!

Just two for dinner?  I used two 3/4-inch thick bone-in, center cut tenderloin included (whew!) chops for my husband and myself.  I halved all of the ingredients except for those used to make the sauce.  I used a Ziploc bag to shake the chops in the flour and spice mixture, then dipped them into the egg, then tossed them in the bread crumbs in the same bag (saved on dishes and clean-up).  I browned them in a skillet that can transfer to the oven, so that saved on another dish to clean up later.  Result:  the chops were tender, delicious, and flavorful.  The sauce was velvety-smooth, and wonderful over the rice I made to accompany.  The sauce needed a bit of extra 'zip', so next time I will shake in a bit of cayenne.  If I were to make this for more people, I would definitely double the sauce ingredient amounts stated in the recipe.  An easy and very tasty recipe for pork chops!

This turned out great given how 1. cheap, 2. easy, and 3. bland it sounded. It smelled great and tasted better. -- However, I made two subs: 1. used spray Pam instead of the oil (and it turned out great with far fewer calories) - and 2. used cream of potato soup (since I didn't have cream of mushroom since hubby hates it). Like others, I also used sour cream instead of milk and cut the time down some. This is a keeper!

Very good flavor. I didnt dip in eggs ( I didnt have any) but after the flour I spread mayo (spicy) on both sides before I put in bread crumbs. I also used marsala wine and put sliced mushrooms on top. Tasted fantastic. So very tender and juicy. Fell apart with a fork.Will definetly make again. BF called it a "down home" recipe. Very filling.

Just like another reviewer, I used 1 inch thick boneless chops so we wouldn't have to worry about the bone under the sauce. Everything else I did IAW the recipe and it turned out delicious! I also thought it made enough extra sauce to pour over the pasta I served with it without having to adjust the recipe.

Well, I'm getting very close to perfect pork chops.  These were the most tender I've ever made, but not the most tender I've ever had!  Flavor was very good.  Added some dried, chopped onion to the soup/wine/milk mixture, as well as a bit of garlic.  Used 1" thick boneless pork chops and served with homemade buttered noodles, fresh green beans and garlic bread.  The gravy is great on the noodles, too.  My 11-year old daughter was not crazy about them -- so, off to try another!

My husband said that these were the best pork chops he ever had. I doubled the sauce.  I used one can of cr. of mushroom soup, and one can of chicken cr. of mushroom soup, and mixed that with the drippings from frying the chops.  This is an excellent dish.  Thank you.

This was so delicious!! My fiance absolutely loved this dish it was so tender.  I did tweak it a bit however: I used a 16 oz can of progresso cream of mushroom, a packet of lipton's onion soup mix, a spoonful of sour cream, `1/2 cup of the white cooking wine, the milk and fried up some fresh mushrooms to add in. It was soooo good and smelled yummy!!
I also used bone in center cut pork chops (used only 4 though) the only problem with this was the bone seemed to chip off, my fiance made a comment that he almost broke his tooth several times - but still said he loved it.  So next time - no bone in!!

Like some others have said, I used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom, and chicken broth instead of the white wine.  This is a great recipe -- my whole family loved it, including my 3 kids, ages 10, 4, and 3.  How often does that happen?

This was very, very good. My husband raved to everyone about how good this was. I think next time I would fry it a little longer to make it a little crispier. I followed the recipe exactly.

I thought this was pretty good. .  It was nice and tender.  The flavor was pretty good, although the wine taste really stood out--maybe a tiny bit too much.  I added sauteed onions and mushrooms over the sauce. It's a good recipe, although i can't honestly say it's the very most delicious thing i've ever tasted.

I made these last night for supper OMG they were so good. I used boneless chops and cooked for the time called for in the recipe they were so tender. I seasoned the flour with some S&P but that was the only change I made. I will make these again.

These pork chops are soooooo good! I used chicken broth instead of the wine. I also used cream of chicken soup. I thought baking them for 90 minutes would make these pork chops dry, but no they were so moist and tender. Even my picky 10 year old liked them. Served with mashed potatoes. Next time I will double the sauce to get more gravy.

This has got to be the best dish I have made thus far (being a beginner cook). It's simple yet delicious.
An additional thing I added into the sauce before pouring it over the chops was a cup of sliced mushrooms (those white puffy ones). Mmmmm....

After reading the reviews I followed other users leads and modified the recipe. I baked the pork chops for 40/20 and sauted onion to add to the sauce. Turned out great and I will definitly make this again.

Great recipe! I tweaked the recipe following others suggestions. I used Campbell's Select Portabella Mushroom soup, added an envelope of onion soup mix to soup mixture. Also added 1/2 cup of sour cream and fresh mushrooms that were sauted in olive oil. Meat came out very tender. This is a keeper!

My husband and in-laws LOVED this from the first time I made it.  My mother-in-law wouldn't leave without the recipe and my husband asks me to make this at least once a week.  VERY juicy and tender pork chops.

YUMMY!  I added fresh mushrooms and green onions (I sauteed them in the pan after I browned the chops).  I also doubled the sauce and glad I did.  It makes an excellent dish over rice.

These were fabulous!  I substituted chicken broth for wine and only baked for 30 minutes before adding the sauce.  I removed the chops from the pan before pouring the sauce in.  Then I placed the chops on top of the sauce to finish baking so that they were still crunchy on top.

Delicious!!! I am not big on pork chops, but my husband loves them, so I was looking for a recipe that would add something to the pork chops...This was It! Everyone in my family loved them! The flavor was really good and the pork came out so tender. It takes a little work but this recipe is worth  it...I followed directions exactly and they came out perfect! Thanks for sharing!

These were a nice change from dry, tough chops. I added another can of mushroom soup, added garlic powder to the chops AND in the breadcrumb mixture, and added fresh sliced mushrooms.  I served them over wide egg noodles and had extra gravy for leftovers the next day! More prep time than I would have liked but worth it in the end.

I was very pleasantly surprised by how delicious these were. I'm a big fan of using all fresh ingredients and not canned adds with meals so I was a little wary with the mushroom soup but I was not dissapointed. The only difference I made was using savory garlic and herb breading for the chops and lots of fresh quartered mushrooms in the gravy. Wonderful...

The idea was good, but the taste was off.  My husband immediately was wowed about how tender the pork was.  It literally flaked off-- kinda like fish it was so tender.  But after the first bite rated it a 8.  I'd give it even less honestly.  But, we're from the south and used to the classic fried p.chops.  They were beautiful though.  I tried what others had mentioned about the roasted garlic AND mushroom soup.. and it STILL didn't have enough flavor for me.  Maybe next time I'll season the soup-mixture.. Or even make a gravy out of the drippings when I'm done frying them?  I'm not sure, but they weren't bad as is.

I used boneless pork chops and was nervous about them cooking in the oven for the first hour and prayed that they would not dry out. Well, to my surprise they were moist, flavorful and I really didn't need a knife. The best pork chops that I had in a long time. Family enjoyed them.

This recipe is teriffic!! Thanx for sharing. The first time I followed the recipe exactly-great. The second time I varied by using the cream of mushroom soup that contains roasted garlic, and added some parmesan cheese (about 1/4 cup)It was mouth watering!

I know there are more reviews than needed but I had to tell the change I made to these, I had no cream of mushroom soup(I know)but I did have cream of cheddar..oh wow, it was excellent, my hubby went nuts over these, and I used 11/2 inch thick boneless chops..these are great to serve at a dinner. Great!!

THIS RECIPE WORKED OUT GREAT.  MY MOM AND DAD ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.  THEY WERE SO TENDER THAT THEY WERE BREAKING WHEN I TOOK THEM FROM THE BAKING DISH TO THE PLATE.  THEY WERE A LITTLE SALTY, NEXT TIME I'LL CUT DOWN ON THE SALT.  I SERVED THE CHOPS WITH GARLIC MASHED POTATOES AND CORN.  OVERALL A GREAT RECIPE.  I DEFINITELY WILL MAKE IT AGAIN!!

FANTASTIC!! I had to sub in water for the wine since I didn't have any, but it was still great. I used thick, bone in pork chops and they were super tender. I can see how this might be bland, but I used more seasoning than I might normally and it was really yummy. I also added salt, pepper, and garlic to the sauce and it added the needed flavor boost. ENJOY!!

This was so good and easy. My husband loved it! He wants to try it next time with chicken. I did save the pan that I fried the chops in and deglazed it with the wine. I made the sauce in the pan then addres it to my baking dish. I did not want to miss out on ANY of the flavor! IT as delicious!!

Fantastic "comfort" food! My husband loved them - and they were so easy. I halved the recipe, and reduced baking time a bit - but the sauce helps keep the chops moist! Also - I sprayed the baking pan lighty with non-stick... helped with the clean up! :-)

Probably one of the best pork chop recps ever.Used boneless chops, pounded w/ a mallet. Not unlike a great pasta sauce, tasted even better the next day. Added sauteed portbello mushrooms atop the sauce during the last 30 minutes. Juicy and not dried out, wonderful, a keeper.

I did not think this was such a fabulous recipe.  The chops did come out tender but they were VERY bland- they need a lot of tweeking.  I dont understand what everyone is raving about...I've had better. Sorry

I did not want to stop eating this it tasted so good! I did add fresh mushrooms and a clove of garlic to the sauce. I just sauted them in the same pan I browned the meat and then added the wine and let it cook down a little bit, then added the soup and milk until it had warmed up. I only baked for total of one hour and they came out perfect!

Wow, this was fantastic! I took others advice and added onion soup mix to the breadcrumbs, and also added some to the mushroom soup mixture while it was simmering. Served with Mashed Potatoes & Sweet Peas. Had friends over to watch the Oscars, they left with the recipe.

This recipe was easy and great. I used 4 boneloss chops and it only took a total of 40min from start to finish. DEFINITELY use the wine!!! Simmer together the soup, water and a GOOD DRY white wine (I used Luna da Luna Pinot Grigio) until it's piping hot. Then, add it to the pork chops once you finish browning them and stick them in the oven for 20-30min depending on thickness. The sauce is so flavorful with the wine in it (reminds me of marsala) Moist and yummy!!

I really liked this recipe, but it took forever to make.  You got to have lots of time.  My husband wasn't to thrilled about the sauce, but that is because I accidently told him it had cream of mushroom soup in it.  If he wouldn't have known, I bet he would have loved it too.  It is good recipe to make for company.

Excellent!  I used thinner, boneless chops and didn't find them dry at all, even at the cooking time suggested.  Very tasty and moist chops with a delicious sauce - we will definitely have this again as the whole family loved it.

Dawn, these were absolutely the best pork chops I have ever made or eaten. Only adjustment made was, I used (10) 1/4" boneless chops and adjusted time and temp. This recipe is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to Pork Chop lovers.

This was delicious!  I did modify a bit - I used butter, oil & 3 cloves minced fresh garlic to brown the chops, I used cooking sherry instead of white wine and added a chopped Portabello mushroom that I had on hand to the sauce.  I did use the family sized can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom and it was perfect.  I will make this again and again, it was tender, moist and the sherry gave the soup interest - a wonderful blending of flavors.  My honey loved it too!

I was so skeptical of this recipe since it cooked so long, but it was so delicious!  I cute it down to make only 2 chops, and my husband and I ate it as fast as we could since our 2 year old kept asking for "more please"!  hahaha  Very easy, and will definately make again! Yummy!!

AWESOME!  I didn't have wine on hand so I just did without and it STILL came out great.  It seems like a long time to cook only a few porkchops but it's well worth it.  I think baking it again with the soup really made it sooo tender!  My boyfriend called his mom right away to tell her how great it was.  A KEEPER!

This was delicious! I rarely order pork chops at restaurants because they always turn out dry, and I never make them at home for the same reason. But this recipe is EXCELLENT! EXTREMELY TENDER AND MOIST!!!! This is one of my favorite recipes now.

excellent recipe. Very tasty, will definitely make again and again. The sauce thinned out a bit while it was baking, still tasted great. Next time I will decrease the amount of milk and see what happens.

All I can say is WOW!!!  I had given up on making pork chops because they never turned out edible.  These pork chops were awesome and so moist and tender.  I didn't change a thing and will definitely be making these on a regular basis.

I was looking for a new recipe using pork chops so I tried this one. I am usually sceptical about trying something different in fear of ruining dinner at he cost of meat these days. so, I took the ratings word for it. Well it was a hit.  Hubby loved it and he's not usaually a pork chop fan.  As the other readers said, you can double the soup mixture if you'ld like more, but for six chops, it was fine. I would definitely make it again and have added it to my collection.  I used thinner chops and only loosely covered the pan with foil. It didn't take long to cook at all, within 30 minutes.

The chops were dry and I used 1" butterfly cut.  I usually love dishes like this but was not happy with this one.  My fiance said "Pretty good"  so I will try to make it again.  I had no wine in the house so I am guessing that had something to do with it.  With advise of others I replaced it with chicken broth.  I will give it another try and use the wine and see if that helps.

The sauce is great!  I served over egg noodles, and used DOUBLE the sauce (and could have had more)...so make extra!  Also, I didn't think the breading added much, I will skip that next time.

My mom used to make something like this, but the chops weren't breaded.  I like the breading, it adds a different flavor to them. These were soooo good!  I'm a big fan of cream of mushroom soup, so I really enjoyed this recipe.  My kids like cream of mushroom soup too, so they were happy!  I doubled the soup mixture, so as to have more sauce, but I didn't use as much white wine as it called for.  The pork chops were so tender they fell off the bone!  I made white rice with them and steamed broccoli.  The rice does goes well with them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome! I would not have made this if it did not have 5 stars. Usually I avoid recipes with a can of cream of mushroom soup.  No white wine. I used red wine. The chops were moist and the sauce was creamy. My husband loved it. I will definitely make this again. 10/05

I did make 2 changes (subs garlic salt for the garlic powder and seasoning salt) and (unseasoned bread crumbs and italian seasoning for the italian-seasoned bread crumbs).  My husband and I just thought it was plain and uneventful.  I guess we have flavorful pallets.  It wasn't ghastly or anything, it just wasn't all that great.  My apologies to the chef for this rating on a recipe that everyone seems to enjoy.  Keep enjoying everyone...

These were very good.  I baked them for 30 minutes without the sauce, then added the sauce and baked an additional 30 minutes.  I was skeptical about the gravy since it had so few ingredients, but it came out delicious.

If you want more flavor, add an envelope of Lipton dry onion soup mix to the bread or cracker crumbs.

This recipe was very easy to make and pretty good. My husband said it was the best pork chops he ever ate. They were very moist. I do agree with some of the other reviewers,  I think it does need a little kick, it was a bit on the bland side.

Excellent, excellent! This recipe deserves the high ratings. The pork chops were fork tender, and didn't have any trouble with the coating being "mushy".....I did however, 1) bake for a total of 30 minutes, not any longer. 2) did not use a foil top. 3) added "soup/gravy" for last 10 minutes of baking. Family ate this recipe up faster then the cows coming home. Thanks!

This is absolutely amazing... and I'm not much of a pork chop fan. I omitted the wine and didn't miss it. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, it will definitely be a rerun at our table!

Yummy and so easy. I made this last week for my husband and he requested it again tonite. I made a few adjustments for us, I used 3 egg whites and I didn't have the wine on hand so I increased the milk a bit. It still came out wonderfully! Tonight I followed the recipe (except the egg yolks) and it was even tastier. Thank you for this comforting recipe. 5 stars!

All I can say is THANK YOU!  I followed the recipe exactly as you have it, except I used Beef Broth in place of the wine.  I used thick pork chops, and they still were the most tender we've ever had.  This will definately become a staple in our household!  P.S.  And I'm not that great of a cook....but I can follow directions!

I made this recipe and followed the directions exactly.  I didn't think the porkchops should cook for so long; but I decided to not change anything and they were DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  We poured some of the extra sauce over our baked potaotes.  My husband & I loved this meal.  Great Recipe!

This recipe is excellent. The porkchops pratically fell off of the bone. I didn't use the white wine since I did not have it on hand. I also sprinkled the pork chops with a pork and veal seasoning for some extra flavor. This was a hit with my husband and I. Definatly a new favorite

This is really good as written, but when I made it the 2nd time it was great. That time instead of mushroom soup I used SW Style Pepper Jack Soup and that added a needed "punch". Be careful of how much salt you use on the pork chops initially. I used a low sodium chicken broth instead of white wine and everything was still a bit too salty. This would be good with chicken breasts as well.

I love this recipe!  The only thing I did differntly was bake the chops 30 minutes, then add soup mixture and bake 30 more minutes.  Turned out great!  Even my husband, who says every night that the food was "OK" raved about these all night.  Thanks Dawn!

Very tasty! I sauted chopped onion and bellpepper in a little bit of butter, I added a littlr pinch of salt and pepper and some poultry sesoning. Instead of wine I used chicken stock. I baked the pork chops for 45 minutes (covered) and 20 more minutes in sauce (covered). I also made honey glazed carrots with white rice. My family enjoyed it. I will make again.

Wow!  This was easy to make and very delicious.  I'm not a pork chop fan and neither is my boyfriend.  I wanted to make something new for dinner and gave this recipe a try.  We loved it and I've made it 3 more times in the past 6 weeks.  
The pork comes out very tender and has a great flavor.  I don't like to cook with wine so I used chicken broth like someone else suggested and it was great!

Loved the recipe- made some small modifications: I used Panko crumbs (Japanese style), added fresh mushroom slices to the top prior to pouring mushroom sauce and also used a bit of marsala wine with the white wine to add some flavor.  My husband loved this recipe and I will make it again!!  Thank you!

Made it tonight and it was a big hit,  I had made pork chops before with cream of mushroon but these were much better, the only thing I did different was fry them in butter instead of oil and put the soup and milk in the oven with the chops for the whole time I cooked them.  They came out great.  I also used extra soup to pour on the potatoes.  Will make again.

I changed the recipe a lot to make it healthier. I didn't flour,egg or bread the porkchops. I simply just put some vegetable oi in the frying pan and sauted the chops with onion and chopped garlic. I also cut the time to 20 minutes without sauce(no lid) and 15 min with sauce(no lid) It was great!

Excellent!  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was.  Very tender.  I reduced the first stage baking time to 45 minutes, instead of an hour.  I served over plain white rice and it was wonderful.

Excellent.  I like the additional flavor that the wine provides.  We used the garlic-flavored Cream of Mushroom soup, which added an additional depth of flavor.

These pork chops were absolutely delicious!!!  I cut the recipe down to 2 servings and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  I browned the outer crust on the pork, and baked at 350 for 45 minutes, then added the sauce and baked for another 30 minutes (covered with foil both times).  These were some of the most tender pork chops we have ever eaten.  My DH LOVED them, I also thought they were great, but felt they were slightly bland - but still good.  I highly suspect that these chops will become a regular occurence in our house.

I made this for my husband-he says it was a little dry-haha,he probably meant a lot.I thought an hour and a half cooking time was a bit much,so I baked it for an hour.I will make this again,so I can get the cooking time right.Also,he suggests pepper-jack cheese shreeded on top.

I was looking for something different rather than the usual saurkraut and port chops and I found it.  My husband LOVED this receipe.  He told me this morning that he had dreamt about it last night on how good it was.  I used bone in pork chops, pinot grigio for the wine and sauteed some chopped onion and finely sliced garlic clove and mixed it in with the soup and milk.  I'm sure fresh mushroom would be delicious but I didn't have any on hand.  I did not have any seasoning salt either so I skipped that and I also put fresh cracked pepper on the pork chops before I dredged them.  I also didn't have seasoned bread crumbs and just used regular with italian seasoning.  This receipe is a KEEPER.

Wow! I am so glad that I found this recipe.  I was in a pinch with only a few minutes to decide how I was going to make the pork chops I had for dinner.  I followed the directions exactly, but I did caramelize a few onions and then added in some fresh mushrooms.  I also used a can of Campbell's Healthy Request cream of mushroom soup and 4 thick cut chops.  The sauce was fantastic and the pork was moist and tasty.  You cannot possibly ruin this dish at all!  The sauce does not resemble anything that you might expect with canned cream soups.  I would easily and without hesitation serve this to guests for dinner.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

this recipe is delicious, and so easy to make!  i added some more mushrooms to the cream sauce so that there's more substance, but otherwise, follow the recipe and you can't go wrong.

This recipe really wasn't my taste. I usually like my pork chops crispy and I thought I'd try something a little diffrent. They came out pretty good and you could easly cut them with a fork. b

Stab it with a fork and it falls apart!  This is so incredibly good.  I got this recipe about a year ago off of here and it has become a house/guest favorite.  Definitely try this one!  The only thing I have changed is I put unseasoned meat tenderizer on each chop and I've downed the white wine to 1/4 cup.

Very good and easy to make.  I found I only needed 1 cup of the bread crumbs.  Since my son doesn't like sauces on his food, I left his chop out with just the fried breading on it and it was quite good this way on it's own.  I found the wine taste a little overwhelming but it may have been the wine I used, it was a little sweet.  Next time, I will either cut back on it a little or use chicken broth in it's place.  Thanks!

Delicious.  I just set the foil on top of the chops, not a tight seal.  The breading did not get soggy.  It smelled so good while baking and sauce was delicious.  I subbed apple juice for the wine and cream of chicken soup for the cr. of mushroom soup.  My kids loved it!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I dont like Pork but my husband was begging for it so I decided to try this. I loved it!! I didnt have any cream soup though so I used a package of powdered chicken gravy and added the milk and vinegar to it..... yum....the pork fell apart on my fork. Delicious!

So soft I could cut it with a fork! Unbeleivable! My fiance loves it.  Had problems with the breading though. It separated from the meat and was very soggy.  Wondering how this could be solved... But still tasty and yummy.  Thanks!

I thought that these pork chops were divine!  If you do not think so- then you might not have cooked them properly.  I changed the milk to whole cream though, just to make them even more decadent.  They were so moist that they fell apart when the fork touched them.  Great stuff!

My sister told me about this recipe. There is no possible way to mess this up. I did not feel like going to the store so I substituted several things. I used graham cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, cream of celery soup instead of mushroom, omitted the wine and the recipe still tasted awesome. My husband loved it. He says they are the best pork chops he has ever eaten. I will try to get to the store next time and see how much better it will turn out with the right ingredients.

This was the best pork chops I've EVER made. I only had 4 chops so there was enough sauce. And instead of flavoring the chops before dipping them in the flour I instead put the garlic poweder and seasoning salt in with the flour to give it some extra flavor. I made it for company and everyone just absolutely loved it!! Very easy and so delicious!

Excellent!  Be sure to use the thick cut chops and they will come out moist and tender.  We loved this recipe as is, but people who don't like the taste of mushrooms could leave out the sauce or cut it in half.  I added some baby potatoes around the edge of the pan before baking.  Recipe is definitely not quick and easy, but well worth the time preparing.  My husband said he felt like he was eating in a restaurant!

wow, this is so yummy! i pretty much followed the recipe as written except only used 4  center cut loin chops & (as suggested by previous reviewers) fried the chops a little longer on the stove top then decreased the first stage baking time from one hour to 45 minutes. i also tossed a 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms into the soup mixture since i had them on hand. the sauce is wonderful served over broad egg noodles. ps ~ my boyfriend raved about how good this dish smelled when it wasw cooking & then during dinner told me 3 times how great it was! thank you dawn!

This recipes is outstanding!  I served it with stove top stuffing and restuarant style coleslaw which is also on this web site.  Very good.  I used Chablis white wine.  The wine gave it so much flavor.

I marinaded the chops for 2 hours (longer would've been even better!)in a cup and half of marsala cooking wine, finely chopped scallions (cuz I had some on hand, reg. onion would've worked too)minced garlic and worcestor sauce! I omitted the flour and the egg and breadcrumb part. There is NO need for these two steps. I still pan-seared the chops in olive oil, about 10 minutes a side, until golden dark brown. I removed the chops to the baking dish, added 2 sm. can sliced mushrooms to the frying pan,letting the drippings on bottom of pan crisp up as the mushrooms browned. I added a dash (or two) of marsala wine to deglaze the pan. Making sure to get every yummy bit of the pork drippings soaked into the mushrooms. For the sauce I used 2 cans of fat-free mushroom soup, 1/2 c. of skim milk (I would've used chicken broth instead if I had had some in my pantry) and a cup of my marinade. I turned heat off the frying pan, before adding sauce mix  to mushrooms. I always use browning sauce in recipes like this. It doesn't alter the flavor at all, and it really makes the color of a dish like this, much more appealing! Add as much as you like to get the color you want. I served this with a side of rotini coated in the sauce for my kids and hubby who need a carb with every meal. I skipped the pasta and had just the chops and french-style green beans. Low fat and Low carb and Low mess!

These were to die for and thats coming from a non pork fan!  I didn't think pork chops could be so tender.  I only used 2 really thick cut chops and kept the rest of the ingredients the same measurements.  Make sure you brown your chops till the point where they are almost burnt....I didn't have a problem with my breading falling off like other reviewers.  I also took the suggestion of sauting garlic and sliced baby portabellas and adding them to the soup mixture.  Wonderful suggestion!  Around my pork chops I had placed potato wedges.  They were delicious and will do that again.  For only using 2 pork chops, I did not have a lot of sauce.  If using rice to serve it with, you only need a little bit.

this was pretty yummy.  i only cooked the porkchops for a half hour before putting the gravy on, and i increased the amount of wine and decreased the amount of milk.  it was more zippy that way.

Hello,
Made this dish tonight for dinner. I used the mega thick chops you get at Costco for this dish.The gravy is very tasty. I took others advise and added extra wine.I used cooking wine instead as that is what I had on hand.My only complaint is that I had difficulty keeping the the breading on the chops. I will fry them on each side longer next time as suggested by others. They were tender and tasty. Will make again not difficult al all.Thanks! Marisol

I’m not crazy about these pork chops at all.  Not only did I make a huge mess to make them, the taste wasn’t worth the effort.  

My husband thought they were fine which is why I’m rating the recipe three stars.  However, even though he liked them, I doubt I’ll be making these again. Try for Shake ‘n’ Bake instead.

My husband and I really enjoyed the flavor of these pork chops!  I will make them again.  Since I didn't have wine on hand, I used apple juice, as suggested by some others, and that worked great.

I have been making these for a year and a half.  I make them often.  Only changed I make are... I season flour, bread crumbs and egg with salt and pepper.  I add fresh garlic to the egg and Iquite often use 1/4 cup of apple juice instead of wine.  I never have wine on hand, but the acidity is nice.  I love apple and pork chops too.  Very good and dependable recipe.

Great recipe, great tips!  Since some said it need more flavor after I browned the chops I sprinkled them with a salt-free garlic and herb seasoning.  I also sauteed fresh mushrooms and onions then layered them over the sauce.  Can't wait to share this one.

These chops are very flavorful and moist.  I try to add the soup mix so as to not cover the top of the chops or you loose much of the coating, which is the best part.  For sure a keeper.

This recipe was outstanding. I used cooking sherry instead of white wine, and it was still very tasty. I served it with steamed rice and a salad.

This was very very yummy!!!  My kids and husband loved it.  I added fresh sauteed mushrooms to the sauce and I didn't have white wine so I used sherry wine.  Very good this way.   I thought cooking the chops (with bone) for 1 1/2 hours might be too long, but it was just right.  The meat just fell off the bone.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Will definately make this one again.

I LOVE this recipe. My husband won't eat pork, so when he goes out of town on business I treat myself to this delicious meal. My only suggestion is I find it too salty, so I use reduced-fat, low-sodium mushroom soup and it solves the problem. It's delicious w/rice pilaf

I was really excited about this recipie after reading such great reviews but we really didn't enjoy it.  My husband scraped off the breading and sauce.  He usually cleans his plate...but not this time. I ate most of mine but was not impressed.  I will not make this again.

Easy and very tasty. Very reminiscent of Jaegerschnitzel.  Will definitely make again. I added some Kitchen Bouquet to make the sauce brown. Will add some sliced mushrooms to the sauce the next time. Thanks for the recipe.

This was great!  I used mushroom soup with roasted garlic (it was all I had).  My husband is picky about "soup" recipes but he loved this one!  Pork was very tender and flavorful.  We will make this one again.

I cut the cooking time down to a total 1hr. 6 minutes just because I don't think you need to cook the chops for an 1 hr. and 40 min.  I browned the pork in the skillet 3 minutes per side med/high than cooked in 350 oven for 1/2 hr. added soup mix, covered and cooked 15 more minutes.  The pork was very juicy and not dry.

I seriously don't know how anyone could call this bland, it was awesome. I made it for my dad, boyfriend and another friend and they all went back for seconds. 
I doubled up on the sauce mixture and added 1 cup of SC and 1/2 a lemon's juice. Also, sauteed some onions and mushrooms to add to the sauce mixture. I served it over Mashed Potatoes and it was great.
This is a pretty fattening recipe but I did use Skim milk, FF Sour Cream and the LF Crm of Mushroom and it was still incredible. Next time, I might try cutting the calories more by just sauteeing in some non-stick olive oil flavored spray...I doubt there will be a taste difference.

I have used this recipe several times and it is always terrific.  The pork chops are very tender and the sauce is great alone or on mashed potatoes.  I have even added extra mushrooms, onions and artichokes to the sauce for a litte variation.

These chops are fantastic!  I'm not a big fan of pork chops, because I've never had a recipe that didn't turn them into bricks.  That is not the case here. These were very moist and delicious.  The flavor was excellent. I didn't have any wine, so I used water instead.  Served with buttered egg noodles.  This will be the ONLY way I make chops. The only negative thing is the prep/cook time.  We ate dinner a little late, but a little more  organization on my part will solve that.

Wonderful!  My two year old who doesn't normally eat much meat loved it!  She ate every morsel.  I didn't cook the chops as long (because I ran out of time) but they were still wonderful.  And VERY TENDER!!!!!!! Definitely a keeper!

Followed the recipe to the letter and WOW! Just loved it the way it was. Adults and kids all went crazy for this dish. Only thing I noticed was I had a lot of breadcrumbs left over after dipping and those chops were loaded with 'em. :)
Thank you for this incredible recipe! :)

This was a good meal if you like cream of mushroom soup. I reduced the baking time. I baked for 35 minutes then added the sauce and baked for another 30 minutes and the pork was well cooked. In the sauce I added sour cream, mushrooms, rosemary, lemon and seasoning salt. I think without these items this would be a bland sauce. I would have added celery but was out of the time but will add next time for an added kick. I also served with green beans and the sauce on the green beans was GREAT!

Excellent flavor.  I loved the wine taste mixed with the mushroom gravy.  I used boneless pork loins and they came out very tender.

I don't know why when so many others gave such high reviews, but this was not much at all.  it was soooooo bland.  Certainly I could eat it again, but with the prep involved it's not worth it.

I used Cajun seasoning salt to add a little zip to the flavor.  The recipe was excellent and easy.  The only draw back was the time it took to cook.

my husband hated the gravy, I thought it was a little bland, but once I added some extra salt and pepper, it wasn't too bad.  Too much effort for something that doesn't taste out of this world.  I kept reading these wonderful reviews, but I guess I just like my pork chop recipie better!

WOW!  I didn't expect this to be as good as it is!  My super picky 5 year old loved it!  I am not a big fan of pork chops, but had some in the freezer that needed to be used, and I am so glad that I had them.  I think I will make this frequently now!  Everyone loved them.  I did not have Italian Bread Crumbs, just regular and didn't have white wine, so I substituted Robusto Italian dressing for the white wine in the recipe!  YUM!  I will definitely try it again and will try to have the ingredients to make it the RIGHT way next time!  Thanks for expanding my menu!

This was absolutely delicious! I am glad I read the other comments about overcooking, I cooked my chops for 20 minutes before putting the sauce on and I  think that was perfect! My family all really enjoyed this, even my ultra picky 4 year old. I will definitely make this again!

I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM SOME OTHERS DID.  EITHER THE TEMP WAS TOO HIGH OR THE TIME WAS WAY TOO LONG.  THEY WERE BURNT ON THE BOTTOM AND OVERCOOKED BUT THEY WERE STILL GOOD SO I CAN IMAGINE HOW GOOD THEY WILL BE WHEN I COOK THEM LESS.  I ALSO LISTENED TO THOSE WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE BLAND SO INSTEAD OF THE RECOMMENDED SEASONINGS I USED "EMERIL'S ORIGINAL ESSENCE" ALSO KNOWN AS "BAM!!" FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE SHOW. FLAVOR WAS SUPER.

These were so tender, and yummy! I didn't have any white wine, so I just added a little more milk instead.  I scaled the recipe to make only 3, but once I saw how thin the sauce was, I added a can of cream of chicken b/c I like to have extra sauce!  The only thing I didn't like about the recipe was how much grease pooled up to the top of the sauce while baking....it wouldn't make for a good presentation.

Whoever the reviewer was who said you couldn't get this wrong, was correct!  I thought I had bread crums and didn't, so I just browned the chops (nice thick chops!)  I thought I had cream of mushroom soup, and got down to the end and didn't (wow, time to restock some staples in my pantry!).  I used  1 1/4 cups sour cream, mixed with Lipton Onion Soup mix, and can of mushrooms, and it turned out great!  I did put these in my slow cooker, but that's because I was running errands, and didn't want to leave the oven on while I was gone, lol.  Excellent recipe, and definately will add this to our list of regular meals.  I served this up with stuffing, and it was a hit with kids too.

Every one loved these including my picky boys. Did omit wine due to personal taste. These will be served often in our home.

I hate porkchops, but liked this dish. I did add sauteed mushrooms (12 oz sliced), 1/2 white onion and 2 tsp minced garlic to the sauce for more flavor. I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent! I subbed chicken broth because I was afraid the kids wouldn't like the wine flavor and it was great! Next time I will double the sauce to have plenty for potatoes.

Great!  I didn't measure the garlic powder and seasoning salt - just sprinkled lightly on the meat.  I made a lowfat version - I omitted the eggs, bread crumbs, and oil, but pounded the chops thinner, then baked for 30 minutes with the sauce.  Made the recipe again, per the directions, but with only 1 Tbl. olive oil.  Because my pork chops weren't that thick, I baked them for 45 minutes, then 30 minutes with the soup mixture.  Both versions came out fantastic!!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  I changed it only by using one can of cr. of mushroom soup and one can of french onion soup, no wine.  I also breaded the chops with crushed cheese Ritz crackers and the chops were very thick loin chops.  After browning them, I baked them for an hour without the sauce and then an hour and one-half with sauce.  The chops just fell apart.  My husband says this is a keeper.

This rating is a 3.5, a split between me and my sister (who's giving it a 4).  I'm not a big fan of pork chops and I'm still not after trying this.  I felt 1 hour and 30 mins was way too long to be cooking pork chops, so I baked it for 30 mins, then added the sauce and another 30. I also marinated the meat overnight with the seasoning and although I think it helped, it still wasn't that great.  Sorry, porkchops just aren't for our family.

The chops came out slightly dry but tasty according to my husband. I am not a big pork chop fan. I, too, added sliced B&B mushrooms and more seasonings (sage, thyme, rosemary).

These were terrific!  I'm just starting to get "into" cooking and these were one of the best dishes I've made yet.  The chops were wonderfully tender and they reminded my husband of Sunday dinners at his grandma's house, which is the best compliment I can think of!

Considering that I do not even like pork chops or mushrooms - this rating is excellent.  I also added a bit of brown gravy to the sauce mixture to dilute the mushroom flavor.  My husband devoured his.  I will make and eat again!

I used thick sliced boneless chops and made my own bread crumbs mixed with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion salt, & parsley. My husband thought these were the absolute best pork chops I had ever made.  They were so tender that you didn't need a knife to cut them.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Just wonderful!  I followed the recipe to the letter except after it cooked for 30 min. my husband called to say they'd be an extra hour getting home so I turned it down to 325 and put the sauce on the chops then turned the oven off after 50 minutes to wait for them and it was still moist and tender.  I'll be cooking this one again - thanks!

Well, I figured over 700 people couldn't be wrong, and I was right! Yum yum!  - and my extremely fussy 4 year old even ate three helpings of this!  only thing I changed was I had no white wine; instead of garlic powder and seasoned salt I used 2 tsp Emmeril's Essence (Creole seasoning recipe from Foodtv.com);  I dipped the chops in milk 'cuz hubby's got an egg allergy.  I would fry in less oil next time.  And check for doneness - was totally done in one hour, so I nuked the sauce mix and dumped over so they'd bake 10 minutes more instead of 30.

Thanks, Dawn, for this delicious recipe.  I have made this recipe several times and it has always turned out very well.  I have even used the leftover pork chops in sandwiches (I use boneless pork chops for this recipe).  This has quickly become one of our family standbys.

Reminds me of chicken fried steak, but these are pork chops.  They are delicious and oh so tender and moist.  The kids enjoyed them, too.

This was not too complicated and everyone enjoyed it. I used applejuice instead of wine, added garlic and some other spices, and reduced the cooking time, per previous recommendations. It's a keeper:-)

Very tasty.  I cooked the sauce mixture in the skillet I browned the chops in and added chopped onion and garlic, some pepper and cayenne then poured it over the chops and baked.

This is how I plan to do my pork chops from now on! I've never been fond of pork chops because no matter how careful I am, they always taste dry to me...but not with this recipe.  Tender, juicy and flavourful that about sums this one up!!

This was soooooo easy and quick.  I had to modify the recipe a bit beacuse I used white cooking wine with lemon and didn't have garlic powder but used Chef Prudhomme's meat sasoning. Yummy

This was a big hit with husband and me.  I did not have wine, omitted that. Cooked 30min and anther 30min in the sauce. I also used plain bread crumbs instead of seasoned crumbs.  Very Tender.  Serve with mash potatos.Yummy

Great!  This has become, quickly, our favorite chop recipe.  The only change I made to Dawn's instructions was to add hot sauce to the egg mixture for a little "kick."  Thank you Dawn.

Really easy and delicious.  I cut down the cooking time, maybe my chops were not as thick.
We all enjoyed this recipe.  Definitely will make it again.

This is by far, the best pork chops I have ever eaten! Please try them, you will not be sorry. I have made pork chops with mushroom soup before, but these are far better.

This was ok, definately not what I was expecting. I think the cooking time was way too long, resulting in dry, tough porkchops. I did cut the time down by almost an hour, and they still did not need that much time. I added grilled onions and mushrooms, as others said they did and that definately helped the sauce taste good. I will probably not be making this again. A lot of work and time for not great results.

I made these leaving off the breadcrumbs and only used flour. I also added much more seasoning salt.  These pork chops were the most tender I have ever tasted.  I don't think I'm much for cream of mushroom soup so, that explains the low rating.  If someone else loves that taste, then these are the chops for you!

This is really easy and SOOOO good!  I steamed some green beans (with the mushroom soup it tasted like Green Bean Casserole) and served the pork chops over noodles.  Definitely will make again.

This was an excellent recipe and dish. I have made it several times and everytime I make it it turns out better than the last time. As other have said that the sauce is not enough so you might want to make more than the recipe alls for...also it is good left overs if the pork chops are not left in the sauce for too long in the overn. My husband enjoyed it very much and thinks that I on my way to becoming a good chef..hehe. This is a recipe you must try.

Made this using some of the other reviewers suggestions about cooking time.  They turned out great but the sauce was a little too thick for me.  I think the next time I'll thin the sauce a little.  Otherwise, the chops were very tender!

All I can say is Yuck! The breading was soggy, and the sauce was bland. We had to scrape all of the breading and sauce off the pork chops, just to eat them. I have to admit the chops were tender. We usually really enjoy the flovor of cream of mushroom sauce. But I have to say I give this recipe two thumbs down for flavor and texture.

This recipe was too much effort for the so-so taste.  The breading ended up soggy which was a turn-off for my sons.  I used thick pork chops and they ended up tough.  A big disappointment after all that work!

Great flavor if you like creamy.  I used 3 large chops and if I would have used 6 I would not have had enough sauce.  I would suggest using a large can of soup and 2/3 c. white wine.  I added more white wine.  Served over egg noodles as others suggested and added 1/2 can of diced peas and carrots to try to hide a veggie in there for my baby daughter.  (didn't work LOL) she picked them out!  I also added a small handful of fresh mushrooms that I had sauteed in a T butter.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great recipe, and fairly easy to make. Next time I will not bake the pork chops so long before adding the sauce, since mine came out slightly dry.  The overall flavor of the dish is wonderful.  The white wine definitely adds some class.

Good recipe. The pork did remain very moist. I probably would add a bit more garlic powder the next time and decrease the seasoned salt. This is a keeper.

These are terrific! Nice and juicy. A little work since you have to fry the chops & then bake them but it's worth it. I did not bake the chops for as long as the recipe directed, however.

Very good.  I only used 4 chops and still baked it the entire time and came out very moist.  Also, I used the low fat soup and it still came out creamy.

Awesome, but next time I want to try boneless pork chops and cut off any fat.  The fat gets kind of hidden in this recipe but then you bite into it and yuck.

Delicious!! I give it a 5 star for the good smells from just cooking it! We baked the chops as the recipe asked but served it with the creamy sauce on the side and on our mashed potatoes. Good!

Very tender and flavorful, but the breaded crusts were a bit soggy.  But I'll probably make it again, my husband loved it.

Wow!!  My entire family raved over this meal...Will definitely be making this again...I followed it to a 'T' but next time I think I will shorten the baking time and double the soup...the sauce was everyone's favorite part...The wine gave it a nice kick.

I don't usually write a review for recipes.  Until now I haven't found one I thought was good enough to take the time.  This recipe was wonderful.  I didn't change a thing.  This is definately a keeper and I wouldn't hesitate for a second to make it for company.  Thanks Dawn!

This recipe was amazing!!  I'm a 15 year-old cook, and this came out great!!  Though it does take a bit of time to cook, the final results are totally worth the wait.  I neglected the white wine and added more milk instead, it came out just as juicy and tasty!  My parents loved it!

Overall, I think this is good. Its not the best but its okay. At the recommendation of many reviewers, i decreased the cooking time to 30/20. I want to try it with chicken the next time i cook it. The coating part was fantastic though. Its looks very nice and i used the gravy with pasta. I added lots of pepper to give it a little more taste. I like this recipe and would probably cook it again but not often. Dont add salt though as the canned soup would be salty enough.

Although I was excited to try this recipe based on all the good reviews, I find myself in the small minority of those who didn't absolutely love it.  I followed the recipe to the "T" except that I decreased the cooking time to 30/20.  The flavors were good, but the pork chops turned out dry and the soup turned the breading into mush.  It wasn't the prettiest presentation.  I'd try it again, but I'm afraid given the time it takes to prepare, it may not be worth it.

The pork came out very tender and delicious.  However, I suggest cutting down the baking time.  I fried until brown on both sides, then baked for 20 minutes, and 20 minutes more after adding mushroom sauce.  Turned out great!

Right on!!! This recipe really kicks.  Awesome flavors.  I used 1" thick chops and cooked longer than what it called for.  Meat was very tender.  I also added 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix.  Flavor was excellent.  Made this with baked potatoe & served with chardonnay.  Husband was begging me not to forget how I made this one.  It's a keeper!!!

These chops were so juicy and tender!  My husband always complains when pork turns out dry, but he had nothing but good things to say about this recipe.  I was kind of shy about seasoning the chops.  I thought that with the sauce and the seasoned bread crumbs, they might turn out too salty, but that wasn't the case.  Next time I'll be sure to season the meat well.

This recipe was simple and yet it tasted like I had slaved over it in the kitchen 
for hours.  Very little prep time.  My family loved it and the pork cut with my 
fork. It is the best pork chops I have ever had.  I served mine over rice, but 
I do think next time I will double the sauce recipe.

Very tender chops.  I used a 1" cut.  Next time I will use a 3/4" cut.  I also increased the amount of liquid to have more gravy.  I did not have any problems with mushy breadding, as some other reviewers mentioned.  I just made sure I browned the chops REALLY well, very crispy, before baking.

This recipe took a long time to make but was worth it.  Next time I make it I'll start cooking BEFORE I get hungry. My man gave it 4 stars and said it was his 2nd favorite recipe I've ever made.  Even our 4 and 5 year old loved it. No need for a knife to eat these.

These pork chops were an instant favorite at our house.  Looks like you spent hours in the kitchen when the recipe was quite easy to prepare.  Delicious!

I'm not a huge chop fan but these were the BEST, most tender pork chops I've ever had!  Try cream of mushroom and roasted garlic soup to add a little umph!  Yummmmmmmy!

After reading all the glowing reviews, I had high expectations for this recipe, but have to side with the minority that I was pretty disappointed.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and used very thick boneless pork loin chops, but in the end, the breading was very mushy (in fact, separating from the chops) and the overall presentation unappealing.  Taste was OK and meat was pretty tender, which was the only plus, but after all that work and time, I expected an awesome dinner and was disappointed.   Hubby said he liked it, but I noticed he picked off most of the coating and didn't even finish it.  I served with stuffing and a veggie, but neither of us were even tempted to use any of the extra sauce (and there was plenty left)!  In retrospect, perhaps it would've been better without adding all that soup mixture.  Glad I only made 2 thick chops as I wouldn't have wanted any leftovers.  It's perplexing that so many other seem to rave about this recipe, but sorry, I just wasn't one of them!

LOVED IT!!  It is amazing what a little wine can do to a dish.  I used pork steaks and added a few mushrooms.  I highly recommend.

The smell of these cooking in the oven nearly drove me nutty, but it was worth the wait! Just like I read in other reviews, they practically fell off the bone, and were a big hit with my husband!

This was a yummy recipe. I used Campbell's cream of mushroom with roasted Garlic soup and also Progresso's Garlic and Herb bread crumbs. I also reduced the time to 50/20. I served it with stuffing and veggies and it was a great dinner! I think next time I might try and stuff the chops and do the recipe the same way. I will definately make it again.

I made this recipe, but did not fry the pork chops first.  I breaded them and then baked them  I also used thin pork chops and only baked for 30 min. before adding soup/milk/wine mixture; then baked for an additional 30 min.

Great recipe, Dawn!  Our family loved it and it will become a standard.  The chops I had weren't overly thick but I baked them for the times given and they were fork tender as other people described - not dry.  The wine makes the difference I think (and perhaps the wash/coating) since I'm an old pork chop/mushroom soup user from way back.

I loved these pork chops.  I think that they would be good served over noodles also.  My boys weren't crazy about them, but that is because they like their food pretty simple.  My husband raved about them.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was the best.  The pork chops came out really tender and juicy.  Instread of frying the chops for 5 mins. per side.  I used my new George Foreman Grill and gilled them for 5 mins.  It cut down alot on the cooking time.  My husband really liked them and therefore this recipe will be a keeper.  Thanks again for sharing.

Very tasty!  I had pork chops that weren't really thick, so I cut the baking time to 60 minutes (30 minutes for the pork chops and 30 minutes with the sauce). I definately plan to use this recipe again.

this recipe was so easy to prepare. simple ingredients, give fantastic results. one thing i disagree on is the time of cooking. pork chops come in a variety of thickness, and should be taken into consideration. i used the 'america's cut' chops from dominicks- approx. 1 1/4" thick (a decent size piece of meat). i cooked them for the time the recipe called for, and they were a little on the dry side. next time i think i am going with 40 minutes for the initial baking time, and 20 minutes after the soup mixture is added. so i am eliminating a half hour of baking time. the combination of the mushroom soup, wine, and juices from the chops, turns into a great gravy. which leads me to gravy's best friend- mashed potatoes. i served the pork chops over mashed potatoes, which was a great combo...and i would like to add a tip for making mashed potatoes: use yukon gold, they offer a more buttery flavor (leave the skins on, they are delicate anyways), and instead of mashing with the usual butter and milk,  use a container of cottage cheese. it has the same consitancy and adds great flavor and is low in fat. add a little chives and ground black pepper for an extra zip. trust me, this makes for a great companion to these awesome pork chops!thanks for the great recipe dawn!

Yummy!  The pork was tender and flavorful.  I could cut it with my fork!  It smelled wonderful cooking.  Good enough for company.

I feed a ranch crew at lunch, so food must be tasty and relatively quick and easy.  This is a great recipe! The only thing I did different was to use beer instead of white wine.  My chops were very tender and and there were no leftovers.

Wonderful and the flavour was so good.  The plates were soon cleared.  Any cut of chops seems to work well, tried loin and spare rib, and the chops are very moist.  Thank you Dawn from the UK

Excellent!  My family loved this dish.  
I used plain bread crumbs versus the 
italian-style and I also cut the cooking
time down to a total of 1 hour.  I 
baked 30 minutes, added the mushroom
soup mix and baked an additional 30
minutes.  Can't wait to make this again!

Simply scrumptious.  Will be my go-to pork chop recipe from now.  Pretty enough for company and so very delicious.  They were so tender that we didn’t need a knife to cut them.  Only changes I made was using Golden Mushroom soup and adding sautéed mushrooms, onions and garlic to the mixture.

Awesome recipe! I used very thick boneless pork chops. After I fried the pork chops I left them in my cast iron pan and poured the mushroom soup and wine mixture all around the meat but not over it. Covered and baked for 35 mins. I tested the temp with a meat thermometer to be sure they reached 145. Absolutely delicious! So glad I found this recipe! Thanks!

Ooooooooomg, this is Amaaaaaaazing. The Only Thing i did different was add Golden Mushroom & Doubled the sauce, (since Soooo many people said to, lol). My family Tore this Up. Yes, it's a looking time cooking, but once you taste it, you'll understand why. I just can't believe how great this is. Dawn, thank you so Very much for posting this. It truly is the best pork chops I've Ever had. I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow. (I made 12 pork chops, lol.) You know how soups, chili & stews/roasts taste better the next day from soaking in All the flavors, well this will be even Better tomorrow i bet. in gonna reheat them in the oven on 325 (covered) for a little while. I'll let yall know if it turned out ok doing it like that. This is a Must keep recipe for Sure.

These pork chops are seriously amazing!! I followed the recipe exactly, but changed the cooking method/time. 
I pan fried the chops until their internal temperature reached 110, probably 3-4 minutes per side. I baked them for 30 min at 400, then added the cream of mushroom soup and milk and continued baking for 10 additional minutes. I served them with blanched broccoli. These are delicious and going in the dinner rotation for sure.

Not sure why this gets so many positive reviews. When you cover the pork chops with the gravy it will turn your crispy crust into a soggy albeit tasty mess. If I make this again, I’ll keep the gravy separate or skip the crust.

The porterhouse pork chops looked great.

Unfortunately I overcooked them and they were dry.

I will make them again.

It is Great! Just finished up. I did listen to others and tweaked it a bit. Hot bacon grease to fry up not thin pork chops, but not fat ones. Browned them til crispy and slid in the oven for 30 min. Cooked the soup on the stove and spooned on later. since I was also making potatoes, needed more gravy. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of bacon.  Some milk and some chicken broth. Added some bacon bits and it it Delicious. Meat fell off the bone.

I made my own cream of mushroom soup which included chopped garlic to add more flavor. ( Google "cream of mushroom substitute" ).  Sliced the mushrooms vs dicing them.  I used thick cut pork chops and they were as tender as a filet mignon . Very, very good.

I followed another reviewer’s suggestion and added sautéed mushrooms to the soup. I also browned the chops until the breading was well browned. I only made two servings so I adjusted the times down. I love this recipe and have already given it to my daughter.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used more milk for the wine.  There were way too many bread crumbs and I feel bad that I had to throw them out.  I should have just used 1 cup.

Very good. Definitely cooked for less time. Seared for 2 minutes per side and 15 minutes in the oven. Added gravy after cooking. 
Family loved it!

These were amazing! My husband asked me today as we were eating leftovers “did you leave a review?”  He has never asked me that before. I followed the advice of doubling the sauce and using one can of golden mushrooms. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I used thick pork chops so cooked about 40 minutes without sauce and 25 minutes with sauce. They were perfect!  Teenagers loved them also. I made a rice pilaf recipe from this site as well and it paired very nicely with the pork.

I had 6 @ 1.5" thick chops.  I would have liked to find bone-in of the same size.  I adjusted cooking times to 2.5 mins (or less) per side in the pan, 20 mins covered in the oven, 45 more mins with sauce.  I would even cut the 20 mins in the oven to 15 or eliminate that step entirely if you have a boneless cut.  Sauce is fantastic. I did use half and half, added more of that and wine to make the sauce stretch. I served with a second sauce of beef gravy leftover from a slow cooker recipe, sautéed mushroom and spinach.  Also, edamame on the side sprinkled with salt.  Husband loved it and he is so good at cooking pork chops, so I was pleased to impress him.

This was good. Although I made a couple of adjustments. I didn’t have white wine so I used red. I also simmered the wine for about 10 minutes with sautéed mushrooms, the mushroom soup, the milk, and a couple tbls of butter. Plus I would shorten the cook time for the pork chops. An hour and a half was waaaay too long. My 2” thick pork chops were very dry. I think half an hour without the sauce and another half hour with the sauce would be better. All around good flavor though.

Holy cow!! These were amazing!! By far the best recipe ever.  One thing I did different is I put 5 strips of bacon in the pan and cooked both sides of the chops in the grease. then I added the seasoning into the egg.  ( just because I forgot to season the chop before hand. I used a honey garlic seasoning with plain bread crumbs and cream of chicken soup.

Super moist and fork tender. Lots of flavor. The reason for 4 not 5 stars is well while it was good it took a few days to get ate and I didn’t make many at all. Probably won’t repeat but was definitely a new spin on chops. Thank you.

I used cream of chicken soup in place of the Cream of Mushroom and cut the cooking time back due to thinner pork chops.  Delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I did edit just a few things.  I only cooked 1 hour total after pan frying each side on 5 minutes.  I did 30 minutes covered with foil, then the last 30 minutes with the sauce covering the pork chops and covered with foil again.  They were cooked perfectly!!  For the sauce mixture I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken.

The sauce is the winner.  Easy recipe and delicious with doubled sauce; half at presentation and half in a gravy boat for at the table.  Makes reasonable leftovers as most center cut pork chops come in 4 piece packages at our local grocery store.  We made 8 for 3 people over 2 1/2 meals.

I actually had very thick pork chops, and only baked the one (I was able to cut it in half for myself and my husband).  I adjusted the recipe for two...added a little more Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs I had...added more non-salt seasoning...I like that this is seasoned to taste, otherwise, in my opinion, it might be a little bland...prepared the chop according to the recipe, and I gotta say:  so tender and tasty!  BEST chop I've made--EVER!  The cream of mushroom soup/milk/chardonnay wine  for the sauce really made it!   We both loved it.

This is a great BASE RECIPE. You will need to tweak and adjust it based on the size of your pork chops and spices to your taste preferences. Feel free to get flexible.

I drastically cut down on the baking time (I baked for 25/15) and I still felt the pork was a bit dry. Thank goodness for the gravy. I used cream of mushroom soup and used a combination of chicken stock and apple cider vinegar to substitute the wine. Before adding the gravy mixture I added sauteed onions and mushrooms with smoked paprika and a dash of cayenne.

 The dish was so appealing my step Dad who bypassed in favor of his preferred salmon, decided he wanted to try some of the gravy... then he decided he wanted to share my Mom's pork chop!

This is definitely going on the menu rotation!

very good - cook times are more than excessive. I did 40 minutes plus 20 after adding the sauce and it was more than sufficient. Adding mushrooms enhanced the sauce.

Good dish, but I think it needs a bit more flavor in the meat.  I think I will season the meat heavier and at least a couple of hours in advance next time.  The only change I made to the recipe this first time I cooked it was to saute some thinly sliced onions and mushrooms in butter and added the other gravy ingredients (double the amount).  I also thinly sliced potatoes and seasoned them with garlic powder and seasoning salt.  I layered that in the bottom of an oblong baking pan.  I then placed the browned pork chops on top of the potatoes and baked in the oven for 30 minutes.  Then I poured the gravy mixture over the pork chops and baked an additional 30 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.

The pork chops came out so tender the meat just fell off the bone, I omitted the wine this time because of the pregnant young lady in the house but I plan on making it again including the wine. I served it with Jasmine brown rice & corn on the cob, it was delicious.

My family love this recipe. You can add some canned mushrooms to the liquid just to jazz it up. I also double the liquid because my kids love to scoop the sauce and drizzle it over their chops on their plate.

I made it exactly as directed.  We really loved the gravy that it naturally made. The only change I would make is to lower the amount of cook time.  I made six really thick boneless chops and they were a bit overdone and dry in the middle. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I didn't have any white wine, so I used water. I also added a tsp of paprika 1/2 tsp of garlic and onion powder to the gravy mix. Excellent and simple recipe for the chop, and I'm sure the gravy as the author provided is delicious.

This was a good recipe!  I did add some garlic powder, diced onion and Italian seasoning to the sauce.  I would definitely make this again.

I halved the recipe and really wanted to like it. Sadly, we thought it was only ok. The chops crisped up nicely but I don’t think it needed to cook as long as indicated. The chops were dry. The sauce was ok, nothing special. If I were to make it again I’d add sautéed onion, garlic vs garlic powder and bay leaf. Won’t make it again as written ( other than breading and searing)

This was an incredibly easy recipe to make. While I didn't like how long it took to bake, it really made the pork chops juicy and even though I don't like fat, I forgot it was even there! Dredging the pork was key because it allowed the breading to remain crispy even while baking with the soup mix for 30 minutes. I thought for sure they would come out soggy. I am not a fan of mushrooms but I can definitely see myself trying something different to top the pork with.

I can see this working, but even with reducing the cooking time by half, it was so dry and overcooked.  I did use cream or chicken because we aren't fans of cream of mushroom, but I followed everything else.  I will try again soon.

These are juicy and tender.  Lots of flavor.  I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly, except I used Campbell’s Cream of Bacon soup.  I did not find it necessary to over-fry the chips; they were delicious!  Big hit at our house with requests for recipe.

I will admit I was worried this would be too heavy but it was wonderful, tender, and perfect for some leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I followed the directions exactly but since I only made 2 bone in chops I cut the coook time in half. I added fresh sauteed mushrooms to my sauce and fat free half and half in place of milk. I topped the chop with fresh Italian parsley and served boiled potatoes and stir fried green beans with it. My husband and I were very happy :)

This is a keeper!  Very moist and tasty.  I used thin chops so baked it 30 minutes + 30 minutes after adding the sauce on top.   As another viewer recommended, I used the french onion soup mix in with the breadcrumbs + smashed fried onion rings.  I think both of those helped the flavor.  As somebody else said, there were a lot of dished to clean up, but I thought it was worth it.

My husband and I both loved this. I had 3 boneless pork chops,  so halved most of the ingredients except for the sauce ingredients because we love lots of sauce.  Did not use the seasoning salt because there is plenty of salt in the soup.  Also, I covered the chops with the sauce before putting them in the oven and placed a thermometer probe in one of the chops. It took about 40 minutes for them to reach 140 degrees F.  They were tender and delicious and the sauce was excellent over mashed potatoes.

My hubby and I loved this!  My pork chops weren't as thick as what was pictured, so after searing them in an iron skillet for a few minutes until browned, I baked them (in the same skillet) for only 20 minutes.  I did what another reviewer suggested and heated the soup mixture, then poured it over the chops and baked for an additional 15-20 min.  They were so tender!   We'll definitely be having this again!

I bought  boneless chops before I read this recipe, and they were really thick. But they turned out delicious. Didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken. I had a little trouble with the breading staying on, but I'll definitely make these again.

AMAZING! It was so wonderful that we barely had any left overs. My husband and I don’t drink wine, so we just subsisted more milk, and it turned out perfect. We also sautéed some mushrooms to toss into the sauce (we are big mushroom people). This is now in our dinner rotation.

Prepared and fried pork chops as directed using Italian bread crumbs. Mixed two cans of cream  of celery soup, half cup light cream, and a half cup of cooking sherry. Poured the liquid directly over the fried pork chops and baked for 45 minutes to one hour.

So, this is a pretty good recipe with some variations.  I put a little salt in the flour and the bulk of the seasonings in the bread crumbs.  I prepared the gravy,  on the stove, while the chops were baking (about 20 minutes).  Then, I used apple cider vinegar instead of wine in the mix, and added some caramelized onions.  After pouring the gravy over the meat, it cooked for another 20 minutes.  Those pork chops were the most succulent chops I've ever tasted.  They were excellent on day one.  Day 2, they were awesome!!!  The seasonings and gravy had soaked through the meat. I served this with white rice and mixed vegetables.   My family loves this  recipe!

Melt in your mouth and delicious! I've made this several times for guests and always get rave reviews. The mushroom soup transforms to a fantastic gravy during the cooking process. Pro tip: Double (or more) the soup, milk and wine quantities if you're like me and love lots of gravy!

I had to Ketofy this recipe. So instead of breading and flour, I just seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder. Then I browned them in olive oil for the recommended 5mins per side. I put them in a glass baking dish in a 350°f oven for the recommended 1hr. Instead of the cream of mushroom soup, ick, I used the fond from the pan, heated it up, and added minced garlic and a tablespoon of Better than Bouillon Roasted Garlic flavor because that's what I had. Then I added a 4oz can of mushrooms including the water and stirred until simmering and lifting the fond from the pan. Then I added some cream cheese and a healthy dose of heavy whipping cream once the cheese had melted. Poured over the chops after an hour of baking and baked for the remaining 30mins. These turned out awesome and low carb! Love this technique and will definitely do them again! Thank you!

This was absolutely delicious.  I did not have white wine and so used Sherry.  It turned out fine.  The recipe calls for one hour for the first bake--45 minutes worked for me.  I served these chops with rice and green beans.

Tasty recipe.  I modified by skipping the wine since I didn’t have any. Then took others recommendation to bake for 30 minutes.  I also spooned the gravy on chops so everyone was happy.  A keeper!

Can’t say enough about this recipe. Used pork chops that were about 3/4’, doubles the sauce. Baked the fried chop for twenty minutes and put sauce on and baked an additional 35 minutes. This is my second time making this. Although I love the regular recipe, today I added a teaspoon of smoked paprika, two sautéed shallots and  a pinch of dried crushed rosemary. I have to say it was awesome. Just added another dimension. Might try some terragon in place of the rosemary and a a half teaspoon of cayenne next time.  I think I will try this with all different variations. Great recipe. Make sure to double the sauce.

My pork chops were a little over 1/2" thick.   they were baked 25 mins, added the gravy, baked 25 more mins. Outstanding. So tender. I took advice from reviewers...... A little less milk, more chardonnay(wine). Also added a little cayenne pepper for very mild kick. Definitely fast fry pork chops over med Hi heat to get crusty, but not fully cooked. the oven will tenderize them. Will definitely make again!

Very good. Made the gravy on the stove. Did not pour over the chops. Baked very thick bone in chops for about 45 minutes total after browning. Did not have white wine so used dry vermouth.

I made this at my husbands request. Followed the recipe to the T but honestly I can't figure out why so many gave it 5 stars. To me it was bland and mushy with a goopy soup mixture on top. Will not be making again.

Yep, count me in this recipe's five star club!!  Very good. Tender. Hubby wasn't looking forward to pork chops but changed his mind with the first bite. I'll be making this again.  Actually it will be the only thing I will ever do with pork chips from here on in. 
My pork chops were thin so of course I reduced the bake time. Next time I'll add more wine and less milk.   Yum!

Except for the time, I made it as written. Baked 35 minutes, put the sauce on and in another 30 minutes my wife loved me again! I did add some sauteed mushrooms to the sauce but the meat was so moist. The wife raved every time she ate it.

Fantastic recipe! The wine makes it. I did incorporate 3/4 cup of shredded parmesan and baby bella's. Delicious. I got a photo of the chops without the sauce. After the sauce, they didn't last lol...

My family loves this just as it is. No need to change anything. This is the only way my family will eat pork chops. These pork chops are nice and tender. Bone in pork chops work better than pork chops without bone but this has been something I have finally figured out after many failed attempts at making pork chops that aren’t too tough to eat.

I made this with two thick cut pork chops and cut the cooking time by 1/4. Cut the ingredients, except for the soup, in half. Added white pepper to the soup mixture. Paired it with green beans boiled with two cloves of garlic and a few Bay leaves alongside a baked potato. Turned out so good!

Sheer heaven. No knife needed. Fall apart tender. Used 4 1" thick butterfly chops. Breaded as directed, but mixed in some paprika and ground pepper to the crumbs. Browned 4 minutes each side. baked covered 30 minutes.
Sauce: Sauteed strips of onion till sift and gold in butter. Added sliced baby bellas, chopped shallot, minced garlic.
One can mushroom soup, good dashes of tarragon and parsley, 2/3 cup wine, 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 beef stock. Mixed in sauteed stuff and heated. Poured over chops. Baked another 30 minutes covered.
Truly one of the finest pork dishes I've ever made or eaten. Smoky, rich, flavorful. Have nice bread handy. There was plenty of sauce. I'd give 10 stars if I could.

Now this was delicious. Didn't use milk and just enough wine in the soup for the texture I wanted. Left it in the stove top with lid on to simmer and pulled in 1/2 hour at 145 deg temp. Perfect.

WOW - Want to talk about a home run, this is it.  I can't believe I missed this recipe with all the things I look at on here.
It’s fork tender.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I Ninja'ed 2 bags of Garlic Butter croutons I had, lol.  I added a few other seasonings to the flour, salt, and pepper too.  I then made sure to fry them a little longer to have it cooked well as others suggested, then cut the cooking time to 30 min in the oven for the 1st round, then about 20 min with the gravy.  AHHHH-MAZING.  Thank you!!!

I 've made this several times now and they are tender and flavorful with the sauce. I've shortened the baking time by 20 or so minutes as I cook them more in the pan to set the coating. Great comfort dish.

I followed the recipe as listed but put two inch thick chops into a brine prior to proceeding.  Delicious!!!!! Only addition was I sauteed mushrooms/onion which I layered over the chops then covered with sauce.  Since chops were thick they required another 30 minutes in the oven and were fork tender. Thank you because they were a hit!

I've made this a couple times because it's so incredible. I only breaded it once before frying and added fresh mushrooms to the sauce (yum!) but otherwise, did not alter the recipe. This is quickly becoming a family favorite.

This is an amazing meal.  I served it over Spätzle and it was amazing. The preparation was exactly like the recipe.  My only change was the time reduction of 40/30 instead of 60/30.  I also included browned mushrooms and onions in the sauce (just because I love mushrooms).  Someone mentioned the dishes generated - it's true, but you have loads of time to clean up while the chops are baking.  Also, I brown and bake in the same cast iron pan with lid, so that eliminates one.  I only made 4 chops and we had barely enough sauce so I would probably include more sauce if I did the full six.

Even though I dislike greatly canned mushroom soups,  desperation for a Sunday dinner with ingredients on hand spurred me forward.  I used chardonnay for the white wine and eye-balled the amounts of garlic powder and Lawry's seasoned salt. I dredged  my 1-1/2 inch chops as instructed, browned them in an iron skillet using less than the amount of olive oil suggested, poured the soup mix on, covered the skillet in foil and and popped it into the oven.  They were done in less than an hour....and were delicious.  Beware of the recipe's designated cooking time.  It seems much too long.

I made this as is except for the cooking method. I fried them in a skillet, then put the sauce on top and covered them in low for 20 minutes and turned out great. Great sauce and flavor, very tender! Good with the sauce over rice or noodles. This is a keeper!

I had two thick bone in pork chops, so I cooked them in the oven for a half hour and then with the sauce for another half hour.  They came out great!  My husband really liked them and I will definitely make them again.

Love it! I double the soup, wine, and milk for more sauce because it doesn't seem like enough and then coat the chops in eggs and crumbs again. Overall, definitely would recommend.

Okay, this was phenomenal!  Pork chops scare me ... big time.  But I read all the reviews and did just a few minor changes.  My chops were pretty thick .. maybe an inch and a half.  I trimmed them, seasoned salted, peppered, and garlic powder rubbed them and put them in the fridge for a half hour.  I followed bdld's instructions for egging and coating (but added a packet of beefy onion soup mix to the Italian seasoned bread crumbs), browned them, and put them in an oven pan and covered them tightly.  I ONLY baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  I used one can cream of mushroom and one golden mushroom, added cracked pepper, Hungarian paprika, more garlic, 1-1/4 cups Chardonnay, and 1/2 cup milk.  It tasted a little bland, so I had some truffle powder left from Hello Fresh and added that.  Delicious!  Always taste your sauce before you intend to use it.  After adding this sauce over the chops, I baked for another 30 minutes.  The chops were spectacular ... gourmet restaurant quality!  I served them with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Keep in mind ... you want TWO cans of soup so that you have enough "gravy".  You will want it!  Hat's off to you bdld!!!

My partner loved 'em. Not dried out, but did take reviewers' advice and cooked for 30 mins covered, and then 30 minutes with the heated up soup mixture on the bottom. I also sauteed some fresh cremini mushrooms to appear and taste less canned.

Was tasty, both of us enjoyed it. Followed to a T except cooking time was reduced to 30 & 30. Going to try and thicken the sauce a little for next time. Thank you for sharing.

This turned out really good. Frying on 5 minutes each side was perfect. I sauteed some mushrooms and onions in the pork chop pan  with butter after they went in the oven. I only had one can of cream of chicken soup so I found a recipe for cream of chicken soup online to make more gravy as other posters suggested was a good idea. (It is basically flour, butter, milk, chicken broth, garlic powder, and onion powder). Then I added my can to that as well as the sauteed mushrooms and onions. It made a delicious chunky gravy. The pork chops only needed 35 minutes and I added a few spoons of the gravy over them for the last 15 minutes. I left the rest in the pan to use as extra because I made this with mashed potatoes. We loved this. I didn't change anything with pork chops and seasoning them though. And they were delicious and tender. Thanks for this!

The amount of bread crumbs was too much, 1/2 would have been enough. Overall, the flavor was good and the meat was moist.

The best pork chop I’ve ever had ! I used porterhouse pork chops. Super thick cuts. I’ve never had a pork chop fall off the bone. We did even use our knives. This couldn’t have been better.

The recipe was good but the cooking time dried the chops. I highly suggest using a thermostat before they become so dry you can’t eat. All in all a good recipe

This is a very nice comfort food dish.  This could be a great recipe for someone who has never cooked before.  It would be almost impossible to mess up.  If you don't mind a fair bit of kitchen cleanup due to all the pots, pans, plates, etc...then give this a shot.

I recommend using bone in pork chops.  The only modifications I made was to saute 3 cloves of garlic and 8 oz or chopped portobello mushrooms which were added with the soup/milk/wine mixture.

This works very well over jasmine rice.  Just don't believe the calorie count.  If you are using bone-in pork chops, you only need 3 of them.  And each of these 3 services tops out at just over 1,000 calories despite not using all the olive oil, bread crumbs, or eggs.  I wish it was only 457 calories.

Added a can of mushrooms and used gluten-free all purpose flour and gluten-free bread crumbs. My family loved it and didn't even realize it was Gluten-Free....that's when you know it's a keeper!

Great recipe, first time I cooked this I followed recipe directions, this time I modified it a little, made my own cream of mushroom (I was out of cream mushroom & didn’t want to go to store). I used Red Moscato wine instead of white (out of white wine as well). Turned out to be very yummy! Huge hit at this house, hubby wants leftovers to take to work.

This recipe is amazing! I didn’t have any wine and it still was great! I did at some seasoning to the sauce so it didn’t taste too much like mushroom soup.

I prepared the chops the same but instead of the mushroom soup I sauted mushrooms in the pan I browned the chops and made a packetof pork gravy mix.  I put the mushrooms in the prepared gravy and poured in with the pork chops for the last  30 minutes.  I didn't cover the chops so they stayed crispy on top. You can make 2 packets of gravy for extra gravy for mashed potatoes.  I've made this several times and our dinner guests always enjoy  it.

I made some slight changes. Instead of the flour I left it out  and used just bread crumbs dipped in the egg and baked  for one hour I did not use the seasoning salt, the garlic powder sprinkled on both sides along with lemon pepper seasoning I think made it one of my best recipes.

It was a hit. We loved it. The only change was the pork chops were all ready seasoned from the store so just dampen the chops with wet fingers so the flour would stay before I dipped them in the egg and bread seasoning.  The had the best flavor ever. Would make again.

This is absolutely delicious. Doubled recipe and also didn’t put the sauce over in the oven. I added it after it was on plate with white rice and gravies the rice as well. Left the pork chops crunchy. Didn’t want them soggy after putting in oven so omitted the extra 30 minutes. Timing the cooking time for chops is going to depend on how thick your chops are. I didn’t have to cook as long especially after frying.  But this recipe will absolutely eat made again. Great easy dish.

So good! I followed the advice of some other reviewers. Browned the (thin) pork chops until the breading was nice and crispy in a hot pan before putting them in to bake. For the sauce I used one can golden mushroom, one can cream of mushroom, 2/3 cup white wine and 1/2 cup milk. I also sautéed some garlic, mushrooms and onion and added them to the sauce. This recipe is amazing. Served pork over mash potatoes and added plenty of the gravy. So so delicious. Will definitely be making again.

I made this according to the recipe, no changes, and it was pretty good, but not the best thing ever. I took it to a family dinner and everyone liked it and most of it was eaten. Next time I make it, I’ll use a little less wine in the sauce. I will make it again at some point, but probably not soon.

This came out perfect done just as the recipe called for. I have 8 in my family so ended up making 14 chops; on the second batch I ran out of white wine and had to use cooking sherry it was great too. My kids and husband loved this. I served it with sauteed broccollini and spanish rice-a-roni.

Good recipe. I used Italian seasoning and Kosher salt instead of seasoning salt, and plain breadcrumbs. For 3 people, I used 3 largish porkchops but did not cut back on the gravy.  I also added a 4 oz can of drained mushrooms.  For the final 30 minutes, I removed the foil and watched it so it wouldn't get too dark.

I didn’t have any bread crumbs so I used crunched up garlic flavored salad topper instead. It turned out great. I also baked for 35 minutes at the temperature suggested. My kids and husband absolutely loved it. I have never had pork chops as moist as these were and I doubled the batch on the sauce and let everyone pour over the chops as desired. I will certainly be making this recipe again in the near future. I paired the meal with baked asparagus with Cajun seasoning. Bake for 10 minutes. This recipe was also found on AllRecipes.

This is going to be my go to porkchop recipe. Honestly, follow the whole process for the full 1.5 hours of baking. The meat just fell off the bone. Only difference is I did a little under 1 cup of milk for the sauce and about 1/4 a cup of flour. I whisked it together. The flour helped it thicken and it became more of a gravy than a sauce. I also cut up a heaping amount of mushrooms. I put the mushrooms on and then covered it with my gravy/sauce.

2 cans of soup, garlic, instead of bread crumbs used stuffing mix.  No wine // substituted chicken stock.  Use hot pan.

The pork chops were very moist, I would just add something to give them a little spice, they are sweet. My kids enjoyed them!

At serving time drizzled  gravy on - golden mushroom and cream of mushroom soups as teaspoon of garlic and  double the white wine. ( i simmered the sauce while chops were cooking) .

The best pork chop recipe I’ve made so far! Only issue was that I can’t seem to get them as “fall off the bone” as I would like for them to be.

I added sliced mushrooms, substituted golden mushroom soup.  To the bread crumbs I added garlic powder and parmesan cheese.    I sprinkled chops with garlic powder and seasoned salt.  Flour chops, dip in beaten eggs and then bread crumbs .  If making more than 3 chops, double sauce

I was leery of combining milk with wine, but the sauce was very tasty! I added fresh mushrooms that were sautéed in butter to it. The bake time was a little long for the cuts of meat I used. I baked 30 minutes without sauce and then 15 after I added the sauce.  We enjoyed it!

The chops came out nice and tender and the sauce was really flavorful. I used cream of onion soup because I don't like mushrooms and I added some garlic to the sauce too. We will have this again!

Made this yesterday. Followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. The only thing I would do different next time is use very little seasoning salt. It was a little salty and that could have been my fault but the sauce was awesome and I served it with scalloped potatoes. Great recipe, thanks.

Very good!!  I followed other peoples suggestions and doubled the gravy.  I also forgot the season salt so i used regular salt and seemed to be fine.  My whole family LOVED these and typically pork chops aren't our thing.

I’m not a fan of canned condensed soup, had no wine so chose to make a white sauce using organic beef broth, butter, & flour. Aside from that change I followed the recipe. We enjoyed this for dinner tonight. Thanks.

Omg. Our family doesn’t eat pork chops very often. But that may change after having this for dinner last night. Truly it was soooo good. My picky 16 year old said “it was the bomb”. And he usually doesn’t like anything new or different! My husband loved it and took it for lunch tonight. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe! My only side note is next time- I’m going to double the sauce- it was that good!

I was SO excited to make this recipe, but was disappointed in how salty the sauce was. The breading was crunchy and delicious. I also brined the pork chops overnight, and they were mouthwateringly fork tender. I will try this recipe again, but will change the sauce . Maybe I'll even make a brown mushroom gravy instead.

Will make it again. Followed the advice of previous cooks and fried longer, cooked in the oven 30, then added soup mixture and cooked another 30. Added fresh garlic and onions while frying the chops, added a can of mushrooms to the sauce.

I made these for dinner last night (for the first time). I used 5 boneless pork loin chops which were approximately 1" thick. Therefore, I decreased all other measurements except for the sauce ingredients. Per other reviewers, I added onion powder and black pepper to the chops. I browned them for 2-3 minutes per side, and then baked them in our large toaster oven for 20 minutes. I made the sauce on the stove and added it on top of chops and white rice when serving. We enjoyed it and I will make it again.

This was wonderful! The pork was so tender. I did substitute cream of chicken with herb soup for the cream of mushroom. I also added onion powder and poultry seasoning to the chops to add more flavor before frying.

Good basic recipe for pork chops. I had one huge chop (COSTCO sized) which I used, it was plenty for both of us. I adjusted the sauce accordingly. Season the pork well before breading. I used season salt and extra pepper. I also added lots of pepper to the mushroom soup mix, and more wine than less. Threw in some chopped parsley too. I browned my chop in a cast iron pan and put the whole thing in the oven. My chop was over an inch thick and it was done in about 35 minutes. I added chicken broth to the pan to keep the chop moist. Heated the sauce a bit on the stove, and poured it over the chop for a moment or two before serving.

Wonderful pork chop recipe. My family loves pork chops so these were a big hit! I paired these with the Mushroom Rice recipe and some sautéed asparagus. Fabulous! Thanks!

I think the cook time should be reduced because the pork chops were dry.

Very tasty and tender!  I don't love using condensed soup due to the sodium and preservatives, but would still make it again.  Might increase the amount of wine next time.

This was sooo good! I read reviews before I made this and decided to bake the pork chops for 35 minutes instead of the 1 hour and it was perfect. I used Pinot Grigio with the mushroom soup plus milk and I will have to double the portion next time cos it was that good and a perfect complimentary with the pork chop. I cannot wait to make this again.

Easy to make, I was short on time so I browned my boneless chops and put in oven at 425 convection bake for about 30 minutes. Made the sauce with 1/4 cup chicken broth and the remaining liquid with Gewurztraminer white wine, cooked in a  sauce pan on the stove with fresh thyme leaves. Served the chops with the sauce on the side.  Sauce is good over rice too.

I have made this twice now and my family absolutely loves it.   I use 3/4 inch bone in Iowa pork chops and the timing and temperature is perfect.       I have also done as other readers suggest by doubling the sauce, adding fresh mushrooms, green onions, garlic, and paprika.     Terrific either way.

I didn't make any changes but thinly sliced fresh mushrooms I added with the soup mixture. Next time will double soup, milk and wine for more gravy. This is definitely a "go to" recipe! Thanks!

Just to clarify this is neither quick nor particularly easy. And you will dirty everything in your kitchen to make it. However it is delicious! I pan seared the chops for much less time, more like two minutes per side but I used a thin cut chop.

Melt in your mouth  tender. I used Panko Korean bread  crumbs (just a personal preference) I used the  large can of cream of mushroom, I like more sauce,  and substituted  white zinfandel  with 1/2 cup.  I will definitely  make it again!

I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so substituted cream of celery. Neither did I use any wine. I put the soup directly over mean and left in the oven for 1.5 hours. Yum!

I didn't add the cream of mushroom soup as we don't like mushrooms but it still came out really tasty! I would consider pan searing the pork again after removing it from the oven if not adding the soup to crisp the panko crust again

Alright Fam, you know how it is when you're a college student and you only have so many ingredients on hand. Only "extra" things I picked up were the pork chops and mushroom soup, the rest was on hand...sort of. I improvised the bread crumbs by crumbling ritz-style crackers and adding Italian seasoning, and used chicken broth instead of white wine. Also had only 4 chops and half a chicken breast lying around that I threw in with the rest. And because it was meal prep I didn't even get to eat it until it was "leftover" status. And y'all...it was really good. Served with rice and steamed veggies, the breading just absorbs the flavorful sauce and balances out the dry-ish texture that pork chops can have. Also flavors the rice, I didn't even need salt. Will be a favorite in this college student's book.

I have used this recipe with many of the suggestions multiple times and it always turns out well.  Today I accidentally defrosted deboned chicken thighs that I thought were pork chops and with reduced cooking time ( I only kept them in oven for 25 minutes after cooking on the stove)they were GREAT.

Made as written except didn't use canned soup, made a roux and added fresh sauteed mushrooms.  Spooned the "gravy" over the pork chops/mushrooms when on the plate, instead of in the oven.  My husband really liked it and so did I.  The meat was very moist...a welcomed change as I tend to overcook meat and dry it out.  A keeper!

My son instantly said "Mommy rate this 5 stars" and asked for seconds. I browned the outside and made the sauce, but used chicken broth and added some fresh mushrooms, garlic, and onions. I couldn't help but add some stuff to the sauce. I only had cream of celery on hand. I did check the pork and pulled it early so it stayed moist. I poured the sauce around the chops and not directly on top to keep them crunchy. Very good!

Instead of using wine I used 2 cans of mushroom soup and 2 cups of milk. My family loved these version of pork chops and my baby said they smelled like chicken nuggets. Oh and I added fresh mushrooms that were left over from a previous meal, handful of green onion and as well shredded cheese to help thicken and add flavour to the mushroom sauce and sorry I also added my own seasoning to it as well. Definitely a hit in my home

I added fresh sliced Baby Bell mushrooms to it.  Overall it was good but I would have preferred more spice/zest, and my pork chops were a bit tough.

Awesome pork chops!  Fried them till dark brown and crispy and baked for 30 minutes then 30 minutes with sauce. Cooked perfectly.  Substituted red wine vinegar for white wine because that's all I had.  It did the job WELL.  Thanks for the recipe!

As another reviewer mentioned, after browning chops, I sautéed a sliced onion and 3 sliced cloves of garlic and added it to mushroom sauce.  Also added some Tabasco, Worcester sauce and chopped basil.  Baked 40 min, topped with sauce and baked another 20 minutes.  Chops were tender and delicious!  This recipe is a keeper!

Followed the directions regarding preparation perfectly. However 1 hour at 350 reduced them to rubber with an internal temp of 206 (supposed to be 145). If I make again, I won't follow the cook time direction and be more diligent of the internal temp.

I made it a day and half before my congregation potluck and left it in the oven too long to warm up. They came out looking black and burned so I was like "oh well, I'll just put it out and take the left overs home!" THERE WERE NOOO LEFT OVERS. Even the old southern black ladies was ravin about these chops!!! I made enough for people come back for seconds twice (cause I know they can eat). I couldn't even get my seconds  because they were all gone by the time I finished my plate-that what I get for tryne be a gentleman and getting my plate last..... 3 weeks later a sister came up to me and said, "When I look at you all I see smothered pork chops!".....I'm assuming that's intended as a compliment.

Thanks for th recipe

I made this recipe EXACTLY as the author wrote it.  My husband gave it FIVE stars, I gave it THREE stars so on the review I chose 4.  I liked the tenderness and the ease of preparation.  I think next time I will only leave in the oven for 45 minutes instead of an hour during the initial cooking.  Just personal preference but I want the consistency to stay a chop, not completely fall apart and I can't even get it out of the pan in one piece.  The other thing that didn't really tickle me was I found the sauce A) not enough of it. Next time I will double the sauce or half the # of chops.  B) I felt like it was missing something.  Not quite sure what, maybe an herb?  Either way it was still good.  I just think I might do a little experimenting next time.  Thanks for sharing.

I used bone in porterhouse steaks and skipped the breading but did season and sear. I also didn't have white wine so I used a little cab. These were super tender and delicious!

I bought thick chops.  Approximately 1 3/4 " each.  The chops were too dried out & hard to chew.   I would try again and use much less time.

5 minutes is too long at medium high. They are burned by then. Maybe 5 minutes at medium or 3 minutes at medium high would be best.

I used pork grillers,about an inch think. Did exactly as the recipe said and they were wonderfully tender,,but,,lacked flavor. Id like to try again with some additional spices and more mushrooms. I doubled the sauce also,,always need more sauce.

I read through the other reviews before making it.  I, too, doubled the sauce.  I also only cooked the chops for 30 minutes without the sauce and 30 minutes with sauce for a total on an hour.  I added a can of stems and pieces to the soup mix, since I didn't have fresh in the house.  Great recipe!  I served over brown rice and green beans.  I will definitely make this again!!

Made it as published  except only two chops  so there was lots of extra sauce - nice on the baked potatoes.  Long cooking time made the chops very tender and juicy - great!

This is a wonderful recipe. For me, it was an even better base recipe. A great platform which to jump off and make it my own. I didn't have bread crumbs so I just browned my chops instead of breading them. Loved the sauce recipe and I added a can of mushrooms (would love to try this with fresh). The one thing that I changed that really made this extra special was that after I browned the chop,s I sauteed 2 onions in the pan with the drippings and added a little garlic cloves and a splash more wine and put this on top of the sauce after I poured it over the chops. Tasted AMAZING. Will absolutely be making this many times in the future.

Overall an excellent recipe that is simple and reveals tender tasty chops!
I failed pantry supplies so had to go with cream of celery over mushroom.  It was good but I think I'll go with mushroom next time.
The timings must be for very thick chops.  I found the 5 minutes a side in the pan a bit too long (about 3/4" thick chops) and the baking times I cut short as well.  Checked the internal temp after the 1 hour and the chops were at 200F.  I was worried that they might be dry, but the soup and the tin foil I think were key to keeping them tender and juicy,
A little shot of sherry in the soup mixture adds a nice flavour profile.

Totally taken back about how tender this came out.  I would have thought the chops would have dried out from it's time in the oven.  This one is a keeper.

I really, really wanted to like this.  I followed the recipe for the most part, though I shortened the baking time to 20/30. I used boneless center cut pork chops. Unfortunately, they were tasteless, tough and the breading completely fell apart upon cutting. The soupy mixture on top did nothing to add to the flavor/texture.  Maybe I did something wrong, I don't know.

I cannot cook, but this passed the wife test :)  She was surprised that I actually prepared this meal. It took me a little longer than the stated time frame, but that was not the fault of the person that shared the  recipe :)

This is a great dish. I fried the chops fast (Very thin)and  also added real mushroom slices and onion into the frying pot after I took out the Chops for the oven. I but a bunch of extra spices and used panko crumbs in a Italian crumb mixture I threw together. I would just recommend to under salt the breading and focus the salty ness in the sauce. I did bread it twice, this kept the meat tender and prevented in from being over cooked. But it was a little salty. So make sure if you double bread, do not use as much salt.

Prepared the chops just like the recipe called for & it was awesome....took a bit longer with the two steps but well worth it....the sauce is to die for....try it, you will not be disappointed.

We liked this recipe very much. I made it on the stove top instead of the oven. After browning I simmered covered  for 45 minutes, they turned out very tender. Served it\them with whipped potatoes and corn. Will definitely make again. I might use cream of celery soup next time for a variety.

I have to give this recipe 5 stars - it was easy and so delicious!!  I followed exactly (well, I had to use cream of chicken as I did not have mushroom and my kids don't like mushroom).  I baked as suggested for one hour, added sauce and cooked another 30 min.  It was perfect.

These chops were so good!  They got nice and crispy in the frying pan and that was the BEST part.  My pork chops were tender, not dry at all.  The gravy is great on the rice we had as well.

We are not big pork chop fans at my house so I was looking for a different way to cook them that they wouldn't be so dry...well let me say this.....these were the most tender and amazing flavored pork chops I've ever cooked! Definitely will be using this recipe again and sharing with family! No alterations on the recipe...PERFECT!!!

My whole family loved this.  I forgot to cover the first hour, and it was still moist.  I do wish I doubled the sauce. I lined pan foil and cooking spray for easy clean up. My chops were boneless and the oven timing was perfect. The pan fry portion was 2 min on each side, almost black, real yummy!

Absolute best pork chop recipe I have ever made! One thing I love about this recipe is that the ingredients are practical. I have made this dish at least 5 times. pork chops always turn out tender and flavorful.

So I am sorry to be rating this with making so many changes, but I didn't have all the ingredients, and was wanting pork chops with gravy for dinner.  Here is what I did.  I made 8 small boneless pork chops.  I doubled the garlic powder, seasoned salt, and flour.  I also added 1 tsp Mrs. Dash onion and herb seasoning.  No breadcrumbs (didn't have).  Kept all other ingredients the same, but replaced white wine with chicken broth.  Dipped in egg and then flour mixture.  Fried for about 4 min on each side.  Baked covered 1/2 hour.  Flipped chops and added gravy.  It was a bit too runny, so I baked an additional 20 min. with cover off, but next time, I will try it on, as I would have liked a little more gravy for my mashed potatoes.  So good!  I didn't even miss the breadcrumbs.

Really juicy and delicious! I still prefer shake and bake though and would suggest using more then 4 tablespoons of olive oil when browning as it evaporated pretty quick and just started to turn my chops a little black. Also I found the coating kind of slide off a bit after baking but the chops came out great. I also did what another person suggested and baked for 35 minutes and warmed the sauce separate. I didnt have any white wine on hand though so I just used the soup and milk warmed up. Very good thanks

very good and everyone loved it.   Did not have bread crumbs and skipped the part of dipping in egg and dredge in bread crumbs.  Still turned out great.

I pretty much followed  the recipe as is and ended up with very nice results.  The chops came out tender and the sauce was rich and flavorful; hard to believe it was just a can of Campbell's soup and a splash of 5-buck chuck Pinot Grigio.  Anyway, be sure to watch (not burn) the chops when frying .  There's also plenty of room for riffing in this recipe.  The next time I make it, I'll probably add fresh garlic, black pepper and maybe some button mushrooms to the sauce; I found it to be just a little bland.  Still, an awesome recipe.

Easy to make and I had most of the ingredients already in my pantry.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used ground corn flakes (I ground them in a Magic Bullet) and season it with Montreal steak seasoning. Everything else was followed by the directions and the entire family (including my picky daughter) loved it!

Wow! Delicious! I made the recipe as stated. No changes. The one thing you need to know is that the pork chops I made were 1 1/4 inch thick. They cooked perfectly in 1 1/2 hours.

This is an excellent recipe. It turned out the juiciest, most tasty pork chops I've ever baked. I did amp up the ingredients a bit by adding fresh crimini mushrooms, sherry and heavy whipping cream instead of milk in the sauce. I will be making this recipe again and again, and it would be excellent for company. Special note: The cooking time can be reduced substantially. On second making I baked for 40 minutes, could have been further reduced to 35 or so.

So good!  Everyone loved it.  I doubled the soup mixture because we like gravy.  I also just bought a pork loin and cut it myself so I could make them as thick or thin as i wanted.  When frying 5 mins on each side was too long.

Only cooked for 1 hour. Cooked 30 minutes, then added sauce and cooked for another 30 minutes. It was delicious! It definitely would have been overcooked if we had left it in for the extra 30 minutes.

We weren't impressed with this recipe. I expected a lot more flavor given the number of ingredients and all of the prep. My grandson liked and cleaned his plate. My son and I shared our's with the dog. Will not make again.

Made this dish using pork tenderloin instead of chops. 1 1/2 "  medallions. Also combined and simmered sauce ingredients in pan used for searing meallions. Simmered for 1 hr. Overall this is the best pork dish I have cooked. I would make this dish again.

I made these pork chops per the recipe, and didn't change a thing.  These chops involve some work, but they are well worth it.  I pan fried chops till brown, then baked for 40 minutes, then put the soup over the chops, recovered and baked another 30 minutes.  These pork chops were so tender, you could cut them with your fork. 
I also got the best food compliment ever from hubby, he said that these were the best pork chops he has ever eaten. WOW

Awesome recipe! My family said it was "ridiculous". The only thing I didn't do was measure the seasoning. I never measure....I eyeball it. I did measure the sauce but nothing else. It was really good!

Used 3 boneless chops. Would like to re-try adding sauce immediately to fried chops and maybe not breading.  The sauce was awesome. Swapped measurements between milk and wine.

A great recipe I will make again and again.  I made a double batch and froze portions.  Since I used thin sliced chops I only cooked them 30 minutes total.  A big hit in my house!  Thanks, bdld.

This was a good recipe; however, not without changes in the recipie as suggested by others.  I added golden mushroom soup to the cream of mushroom soup, more wine, sauted garlic and mushrooms.  If I made it again I would not bread (even double coating when baked becomes soggy), I would simply add seasonings directly to the pork chops and save the calories.  Further, this could be done in a skillet on the stove, simply slowly simmering after adding the sauce.  It is deliciius.

The flavor is excellent and this is a hearty meal.  My only complaint is that the meat nearest the bone was on the dry side so I'll have to play with the time a bit.

I am throwing out all of my other pork chop recipes!  The salad dressing mixes may sound crazy, but the result is heaven on a plate.  The meat is fork tender and the wine sauce gives rice an amazing flavor.  We added steamed carrots and went out the next day to buy more pork chops.

The next time I make pork chops, I will be using this recipe!

Excellent!  I recommend doubling the sauce.  I used one cream of mushroom and one golden mushroom. Because of the sauce, I made rice and put the chop on a bed of rice.

I only used two pork chops since it was only for me. I made my own cream of mushroom soup because I didn't need that much and I like larger pieces of mushrooms. Tasty!

My family really liked the pork chops, but I should have baked them as some had done.  They were a little tough. Also, the amount of Basil was a little strong. My husband liked the gravy and consistency, but next time I will probably use half the recommended amount.

It came out okay. It was pretty soggy though, and I'm not a huge fan of the cream of mushroom sauce. It took a long time to make and I didn't love it, so I probably won't do it again.

We made this just as it says, but used 4 thick pork chops instead of six and added mushrooms.  The chops were so well done they fell off the bone.  Extremely good.

This was delicious, but yes, the cooking time is way off. I cooked for 20 minutes then added the sauce and cooked for 15 more minutes. Came out great. I think this would be really good as a chicken dish as well.

I tried this recipe last night.  It was excellent!  I had 4 bone in pork chops about an inch thick. Browned them in a large stock pan then put the cover on and transferred to the oven.  Cooked for 45 minutes, then added the sauce, returned to the oven for 30 minutes with the cover on. I don't eat mushrooms, so I followed another reviewer and used 'cream of chicken' instead, I had to use white cooking wine.  These were wonderful, sauce was so tasty, chops were very tender.  There was more then enough sauce, some poured over the rice and steamed vegetables. I received multiple compliments throughout the dinner. I will definitely make this again.

My husband was obsessed. He pretty much ate them all. Wonderful fast recipe. I doubled the sauce and has really thin pork chops so only baked for 35 mins, came out perfect.

My family loves pork, but it's not one of my favorites.  However, I loved this!   I did leave out the garlic salt because I'm not crazy about it, added lots of fresh ground pepper, and used heavy cream instead of the milk.  Next time I'm going to double the sauce because it was so tasty.  I made spaetzle to go with it, and the combo was delicious!!!!   Also, following other reviewers' suggestions, I only cooked it 20/20. . . it was perfect.  My chops were only 1/2 inch or so and I'm high altitude (4200).

I made this tonight.  LOVED it.  My husband said "What is this recipe? Best Pork Chop I've ever had. Restaurant quality.  Better than mom's but I won't tell her that."  I had pork loin chops. I just realized that I forgot to use the flour.  I put seasoning on, dipped in egg then bread crumbs.   I browned them in the pan then put in the oven.  I was a little pressed for time, so I cooked them on convection (325)  for about 20 minutes, put the sauce on and cooked without convection for 15 min.  I used a meat thermometer to make sure they were done. (145 degrees) Turned out great.

Made it as described and it was delicious.  The only suggestion I would have is that cooking for one hour is enough; the chops may not be as tender if cooked for one and a half hours.  I would just cover them after 30 minutes.

By the time I took them out of the oven they were in a soup of their own juices and that's just not my kind of taste.

Awesome  recipe! I did changed  it a little, first, after breading,  I baked the chops on well greased  baking  sheet  at 400C for 45 min.  It's  less work, than frying  and the breading crisped up just fine. Meanwhile  I doubled  up the sauce recipe  and added a  whole bunch of  fresh mushrooms  sauteed with onion and garlic . Then I covered  chops with the sauce  and baked again at 400C another  45 min. It was so yammy! The pork was so tender, and sauce  delicious. I was pleasantly  surprised  how an addition of little   wine (I used Pino Gricio ) made it so much more sophisticated, like a French  restaurant  sauce.  I expected  wine to evaporate, but I could  definitely  taste the wine in the sauce.  It also came out of the oven so pretty  all caramelized  and tender with mushrooms  dotting  the  pork chops  I will definitely  serve it to guests :)

I made this for dinner tonight for my family.  Turned out Amazing!  The only changes I made was that I used chicken stock instead of the wine, doubled the sauce and only cooked it in the oven for 1 hour total.
My husband has already asked me when I was going to make this again!!

Luckily I know pork does not need to cook that long, an hour and a half?  No way.  These were done in 30 minutes total.  I do not think these need to be put in the oven either. It can all be done in the skillet and save some dishes to wash!

I made this using many of the recommendations from the reviews. 1) double that sauce 2) use 1 can cream of mushroom and one golden mushroom. 3) make sure the oil is screaming hot to make a dark brown coating 4) Use the left over oil in the pan to cook up some sliced mushrooms, minced onions and at the end a little minced garlic. 5) take this mixture and add it to the sauce and heat it up in a pan on top of the stove with a little pepper 6) only cook for 40 minutes, 20 dry and then 20 covered in the sauce.Came out very moist and flavorful.

I usually add extra cream of mushroom and some corn starch to thicken it up just a little bit. If you add the cream on top of the rice it's fantastic. I also grab some pillsbury grand flaky layer biscuits which brings it to the next level.

I subbed sour cream for the milk because I didn't have any milk on hand. Chops came out moist and tender. I liked the mushroom wine sauce, but hubby wasn't thrilled. It looked like cream gravy he would get on chicken fried steak and was disappointed it wasn't. I would make it again for family to get more feedback.

Great recipe.  The pork was very tasty and very soft.  I used onion soup instead of the cream of mushroom soup and it still tasted great.

The pork chops were tender and delicious and will make again.

I've made this so many times and it's fantastic. I have used cream of chicken, cream of chick with herbs, and cream of celery (strained! Yuck!) and it always turns out perfect.

Very easy to do. My tweets were to add fresh ground pepper for seasoning the chops. Also keep an eye on your baking times. My chops were not as big as the ones in the video.  My oven runs a bit hotter too, so my adjustment was 45 minutes for initial bake and 30 minutes with sauce.  I also add a little butter in the baking pan to add a little body to the sauce. It worked out great! Have fun adding your twists on this yummy easy meal.

My finicky husband looked up in surprise, "This is GOOD!"

I did the recipe as written, except I didn't have white wine, so I substituted a lemon juice/water mixture.  Tasty.

Made this and followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I changed was the addition of mushrooms to the gravy, and I shortened the cooking time. This were AWESOME! So tender and juicy, both the hubby and I really enjoyed them. Will definitely make again!

These were good, but when I read a recipe is "quick and easy" I don't expect a baking time of 90 minutes! Not worth having the oven on that long in a Texas summer.

Delicious!!!!  The pork chops were delicious and so tender that we didn't even need knives to cut them!  I doubled the amount of sauce to allow for extra to coat the pasta.

I wanted to speed it up, so, I cooked the chops stovetop, 5 min each side on med-hi. Then mixed the mushroom soup,  milk,  wine with a whisk. Pour sauce over chops and simmer for 10 min or so. Sooooo good. Much faster!

Great recipe! I used thin sliced pork chops on the bone, omitted the wine and instead used 1/3 c of additional milk in its place. My husband loved it and added "better than his mother's by far!" ahh yes I never get sick of hearing that one! I also used vegetable oil in the place of the olive oil for frying due to its higher smoke point.

Both my husband I liked this dish. I added a little extra wine as suuggested d by others and threw in some  fresh mushrooms. The mushrooms gave it another layer of flavor and texture. Served it over wild rice. I plan to make this again.

I made this once following the recipe exactly, and it was pretty good, however I thought it could be more savory in flavor.  I just made it again with following changes:  Used plain bread crumbs, used Amy's Organic Cream of Mushroom soup as it has a much more savory flavor then regular condensed version.  Also used a can of Golden Mushroom and did not use any milk.  I also sautéed some green onions and fresh mushrooms in the pan after took pork out and added it to the gravy.  I added about 1-1/2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning for extra savory flavor.  You only need to bake this about 40-45 minutes depending on size of chops, an hours is too much.  It was much better this time and had that savory flavor I was looking for.  My husband loved it.  Served with rice pilaf.  Yummy!!

This recipe is awesome. I know people are reluctant to cook the pork chops for the hour and a half and I was too. But I followed the recipe and it worked the chops were so tender I could cut them with my fork. I used boneless chops. I only made two so I only used one egg , like a third cup flour, and three quarter cup bread crumbs. Which was still to much but I rather throw the little excess away then not have enough. Other than that I followed  the recipe to a tee. I personally didn't find any reason to add or subtract from the recipe.Definitely will make this again.

I made this recipe as is, but did not have any white wine, so had to leave it out.  It was so moist and tender!  My fiance hated pork chops and had more than one of these!  I would say they were a hit!

I made these last night and even though the chops were extra crispy when they went in the oven, the batter came out soggy (because of the cover). The chops themselves were moist but my hubby was not a fan. We will not be keeping this one.

Be made this recipe 2 times before and I didn't think it could get any better. But then I remembered the awesomeness of green peppers and the delight they can bring to meat. Let me tell you what I did a little different from the recipe besides forgetting the flour; used olive oil, browned til crispy, added mushrooms and green pepper( forgot the onions) to the skillet after the chips were browned them added them to the dish when I origin

Super simple and super tasty! I used a can of Golden Mushroom instead and added extra sautéed mushrooms to sauce. I also just pan cooked the chops. DELICIOUS!!!! You'll want to drink the sauce :)

This was really really good. However I did make some alterations. I used fresh garlic instead of powder, no salt and panko breading. This is some of the best pork i have ever made though

Very moist and tasty!   I don't use wine, so I added balsamic vinegar (1/3 cup) to the sauce and it was amazing!  I also used cream of celery soup because my husband doesn't like mushrooms.  We loved it!

We're not a big pork family but i decided to try this for a change from our usual chicken and fish meals. I followed the recipe exactly and overall the meal was good. I would add a few more spices next time however as it seemed a little bland.

I followed the recipe as written.  As soon as the chops were in the oven I combined the soup/wine/milk for the sauce and immediately poured it over the chops.  And I only baked them  for 35 minutes.  Oh, one more thing; I used vermouth as it was the only white type wine I had.  I will make additional sauce next time.

Beautiful. Browning important! Used 4 boneless thick cut. 4min per side on stovetop, 35min in stove at 350. Added sauce on top of chops on the plate to keep the chops crispy. Super huge hit. Sides, red potato and asparagus.

I loved how the chops turned out after frying. I fried them until crispy. did not have any white wine so used the cream 
of mushroom, golden mushroom, and added a touch of Braggs Amino, and mushroom base, as well as fresh chopped mushrooms, and green onions. I haven't eaten meat in over 25 years and this was the first time I ever made pork. My boyfriend loved it. Giving it a 4 star because I don't care for all of the sodium.

I did make a few changes to it, but this was delicious! I will be honest though. It does not look as appetizing as it tastes lol. I was horrified when it came out of the oven but as soon as I tasted it I was happy!  I substituted the wine with sour cream and I put an onion and more mushrooms in the sauce. The sour cream is probably what made it look so unappetizing lol. I will definitely make this dish again.

Tried this and I really liked it. I made it and followed the recipe exactly. The hubby said it was good. I think he wasn't a big fan of the crust. Once the sauce goes on, that nice crispy outside gets soggy. The time was slightly off. Maybe it's because I had thinner chops. I cooked it for less time. You'll have to watch it closely so you do not over-cook. Regardless, it was pretty good I thought. Made with a rice pilaf and roasted broccoli. Nice meal.

I love pork chops so I'm very critical of them as most people are with their favorite foods.  Triple cooking these (once in the skillet, twice in the oven) sounded like a bit much to me but it wasn't, they were AWESOME.  Best bone in pork chops ever and the resulting sauce goes great over noodles or mashed potatoes.  I used Campbell's Golden cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular kind, that gave it a golden brown sauce.  Also I used Moscato as my wine as that is what i had open at the time.  even though its a sweet wine it still worked well.   Also on the first baking, I added a cup of fresh left over chopped parsley I had from another recipe. It was good and cooked by time I added the sauce for the second baking.  So tender and full of flavor, you have to try this recipe.

I liked this dish. the  pork chops were very tender but outside stayed crispy. I didn't bake it as long as it called for, I was only fixing two pork chops. the sauce went well over mashed potatoes. the next time I fix it I will probably put   some mushrooms in the dish.

My husband and I liked it-kids not so much. The main comment I have is the cook time...you should bake them for about 20 minutes then pour the sauce on and bake 5-10 minutes more.

This dish was so good, I did it almost exactly like the recipe stated except I only baked it in the oven for 30 minutes then put the gravy on top of it and baked another 30 minutes, my husband said, "this is the most juiciest and best pork chop i have ever had" I agreed I think baked any longer it would have turned out dry like most pork chops are.

While I enjoyed it when freshly made, it was not pretty to look at as leftovers. The mushroom soup gets congealed and gross looking. Perhaps when you reheat do so in the oven so it gets heated really well. Microwave doesn't seem to work well for that at least in terms of looks.

Followed recipe exactly but I only had four big chops. I don't think there would be enough sauce for six pork chops. I have tried smothered chops in the stove top but these were much better, tender and flavorful. Thanks for sharing.

Made this recipe almost as stated. I added a little garlic powder and cayenne pepper to soup mix and it really brought the gravy to the next level. May have been a little bland and boring without the kick of the cayenne. Served this with Rice and Orzo recipe from this site with a side of broccoli. Huge hit with the family. Thanks for sharing -it's a keeper!

The pork chops, themselves, turned out as expected, very good.  Seasoning, flour, egg, crumbs, fry and bake is old school cooking and should hardly be considered time consuming and gives great results.  My chops were large about an inch thick and after frying 5 minutes on each side until browned, i baked them 20 minutes to achieve medium rare on a meat thermometer before adding the sauce and 20 after for a meat medium reading.  I added the sauce around the chops rather than smothering them. The sauce/gravy was bland.

I made this with homemade seasoning salt (minus onion powder). Still, great flavor. I also used sherry instead of white wine (husband used last bit and didn't tell me). Would make this again, but will saute fresh mushrooms and add to soup mix before pouring over chops. I used center cut, boneless chops, and they came out great.  One note, I almost burned my chops in my fry pan because of the stated time of 5 minutes per side. Glad I turned them over when I did.

After reading a few reviews I made this.I did take the suggestion to double the sauce and use one can of golden mushroom soup with regular cream of mushroom, this worked great. I also sauteed fresh mushrooms and added it to the sauce.  My husband and I both liked this and I will make it again. Thank you to bdld and all who gave helpful suggestions.

Normally I don't write reviews but after 3 weeks waiting to cook these pork chops (kept postponing because of a crazy schedule) I finally cooked them and it was worth the wait, they were flavorful and soft. I served them with vegetables rice and corn on the cob. My boyfriend left the plate clean and packed some for tomorrow. As the previous reviewers said 30mins before sauce and 30mins after sauce were perfect in the oven. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!!

Wow, this is absolutely delicious. My son and husband also loved this recipe. I served this meal with green bean casserole, and wild rice. It was terrific. Pork chops were moist, tender, and delicious. You do need to decrease the cooking time; I cooked them 30; then 30 more, depending how long you fry the chops. I used boneless chops, and made my own Italian crumbs with an Italian seasoning,; I also added a chopped onion and two cloves of garlic on top during baking before adding the gravy mixture. YUM!

The recipe is delicious! My only changes are that I used steak seasoning on both sides of the raw pork chops.  I baked 30 minutes.  Added a can of mushrooms to the sauce (heated it in the microwave for a minute first).  Added the sauce to the pork chops and baked 30 minutes more.

The only reason I give this 3 stars is because the cooking time is far too long. I brined my nearly 1 pound pork chop for nearly 4 hours, and cut the cooking time down to 30 minutes in the oven before adding the cream of mushrooms.  Next time I'll go for 15 minutes, and an additional 15 minutes covered with the cream of mushrooms. Love the combo though, and made the soup from scratch (Chef John's) with ultra-fresh mushrooms. Served it with steamed green asparagus. A-plus, but there is nothing more sobering than an overcooked pork chop.

The breading was way to soggy for my taste, the chops were very dry and tough, and the taste was not there and I would not make this again.

I followed the directions almost exactly, and they were so good.  I usually end up with dry pork chops, but not this time!  You could definitely play around with this recipe, and it goes with all sorts of sides.  I'm putting this recipe in our rotation.

Seasoning for this recipe is spot on delicious!  I made a change for frying time as the chops were browned in about 3 minutes per side.  My first couple of chops I fried were a little burned when fried per the 5 minutes per side direction in the recipe.  I also cut down the bake times to 35 minutes for each baking time, based on other review suggestions.  These came out very tasty. The meat was perfectly cooked and tender and everyone said the sauce really rocked!  I would certainly make this again.

I made this according to the recipe but added onions and dropped the cook time based on some of the reviews. I served it with Jasmine rice and peas but I have to say it was some what bland but very moist. The next night I sauteed garlic and add a bit more wine and capers then added the gravy/sauce and made spaghetti to go with it instead of rice. This helped liven up the taste but all in all I felt like the end product was not equal to the effort or the reviews. Perhaps I like things spicier than the average person. It wasn't bad but it just wasn't  great either and I am not sure how to improve it  to the  level of the reviews.

Was very good! Pretty easy and inexpensive.

Taking notes from others, I did reduce the cooking time to 30 min pre sauce and 25 min post sauce, but made sure they had nice browning before putting them in the oven. Used 4 chops instead of 6 but kept the sauce ratio the same and that gave plenty for dipping.  I also tend to cut down on the amount of flour and breadcrumbs I see on recipes like this, as even with a generous coating I have leftover bowls filled with wasted ingredients.

This is my favorite pork chop recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out so delicious! I have made this recipe many times and if I'm short on time, I will cook for only 30 minutes before adding the sauce and thirty after; however, I think the longer the chops cook, the more fork tender they become. Awesome recipe-thanks for sharing!

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used the cream of chicken soup I had on hand.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. The only thing I would change is no seasoning on the pork chop prior to breading. These already have lots of flavor with the gravy. I also put fresh baby bella's in the gravy and we were cutting these with our forks.

LOVED it!  My pork chops were thin and did not require the full hour cooking time.  My kids helped make it and were clean platers!

This was awesome! I made it as directed except I did sauté some extra mushrooms I had and added them to the sauce. I also put in a little less milk as it looked like it would get funnier than I wanted. I had boneless pork chops and thought I may have overlooked them after the hour cooking time, but still cooked the extra 30 min with the sauce. They turned out great! Not chewy at all, but super tender and the sauce is amazing.

If your chops are thicker than breakfast chops there is a chance they will be dryer and tougher.  I tenderize  mine either by  marinating or meat mallet.  Whatever seasoning is chosen, seasoning every layer of the dish will keep it from tasting like meat covered in soup.  Make sure the oil is hot before browning the bread crumb coating very crispy, (do not burn).  For the sauce, I  sautéed  a whole onion and fresh sliced mushrooms in the browning pan then added the soup, wine and milk to create the sauce.  As others suggested, it is a great idea to double the sauce ingredients. Add sauce after browning, cover and bake at 300° for about 30-40 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chops.

I think these were the best pork chops I have ever made. Just delicious! The only change I made was to use cream of chicken soup because I don't like mushrooms.

I love the flavor of the white wine in this gravy. I used Chardonnay. I will use this recipe for chicken because I bet the gravy will go really well with that too.

I made this tonight, bf said it was good although he had to add a bit more salt on the chops. I used Silk unsweetened coconut milk as i didn't have regular milk, condensed cream of chicken as im out of the condensed mushroom soup, sauteed fresh mushrooms and mixed it onto the soup mixture. Baked it for 35 minutes as the other reviewers suggested. I added a little bit of the dry onion soup mix, paprika and black pepper on top of the pork chops before adding the soup mixture then baked it for another 30 minutes. Meat came out very tender, if you don't like a lot of sauce though id recommend making half the amount of sauce. Good cook time as you can do other chores while its baking in the oven. Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good, but not amazing or anything. I followed the recipe except that I doubled the sauce, like a lot of other people suggested. I also used different soup, as we aren't mushroom people. I used one can of cream of asparagus and one can of cream of celery. I think the combo turned out pretty good. I also used a little more wine, because I had one of those little bottles, which was just over 3/4 cup.  I served it with Sarah's rice pilaf and asparagus in a lemon herb sauce. The sides worked well with this recipe.

This dish is wonderful! We finished it within 15 mins. I would highly recommend this over rice. Also, I reduced the cooking time to 30 mins baking 30 mins baking with soup. I doubled the milk instead of using wine and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

I used thick boneless loin chops and, while the sauce was tasty, the meat itself was tender but flavorless. If I make this again I'll marinate the meat first.

The cook time was too long. After browning the meat, I put them in the oven for 30 minutes then used only mushroom soup and a cup of fresh mushrooms which cooked in the juices, only for another 10 minutes. My family loved them.

These are the best , most tender pork chops I can remember eating.  Followed the directions very closely (except for my habit of eyeballing instead of measuring closely).   I did make more sauce than called for.  Will definately cook this one again.  Hint, use paper plates for the breading mixtures (not the egg of course)

This recipe is tasty. The only white wine I had available was a sweet moscato. I tasted the sauce and I didn't like the taste so I decided not to bake it with the pork chops. Instead I cooked the sauce separately on the stovetop and added a chicken bouillon cube.  After the chops were done, I drizzled a little of the sauce on the chops. Probably a dry wine like a Chardonnay would have been better. Overall I liked the chops. I will most likely make it again and maybe omit the wine altogether.

This was tasty even though I didn't have all of the ingredients so I substituted alot of things -I used a dash of red wine vinegar and Worcestershire instead of the garlic powder and white wine, added paprika and smoked black pepper as well.  I barely had  the patience with the frying step as I found it very tedious and annoying.    I fried each piece 5 minute then baked it maybe 45-50 minutes, I sprayed my casserole dish with Pam cooking spray & drizzled it with a little extra virgin olive oil as well.  I also marinated my chops for 2 hours in Italian dressing before  I started cooking as I always do this (makes them more tender and flavorful).  I did not have the Italian bread crumbs for the breading so I crushed some Ritz crackers and mixed with flour, black pepper salt & paprika.  It turned out great but like another reviewer noted it made too many dirty dishes and too many steps.  Next time I'll use boneless pork chops as well since my husband picked out bone-in ones by accident.

Very tender!  Browned a little longer in pan and reduced cooking to 20/45 minutes (used a thermometer to 170 degrees), then added the soup mixture and cooked 45 minutes longer.  I probably could have baked it 30 rather than 45 minutes.  Will make it again.  I cooked 3 pork loins so I had plenty of sauce to put on the top and on baked potatoes.  Served with string beans as well.  Thanks for the recipe.

Woah. This is pretty tasty! The only thing I did differently was use panko instead of Italian bread crumbs. I served this with a side of Brazilian rice. (You can find that recipe on here as well.) Very tender and delicious. I will definitely make this again!

Wonderful recipe.  Pork was so tender.
I however made an error. I read that you could substitute White wine vinegar for White wine in equal proportions. Not so!  
I was able to rescue it by adding soya sauce but will reduce the vinegar next time.
Lesson learned :)

Love this dish! I use 8 chops and double the sauce! Wonderful with rice or potatoes. So easy to make, and if you have thicker chops just adjust the time a bit. As with other reviewers, I allowed my chops to Simmer longer as well.

This was really good! I did follow the previous reviews and was really pleased! Sautéed fresh mushrooms doubled the cans and used one creamy and one golden mushroom.. I didn't have white wine so I used chicken stock. It turned out great!

I combined this recipe with the Creamy Herbed Pork Chops recipe on this site and came up with an awesome combination!

I pan fried the pork chops according to this recipe (although I mixed the salt and garlic powder into the bread crumbs so I didn't have to dip as much). I then transferred the chops into the oven and left them at 350*.

Meanwhile, I made a gravy to go on top using 2 tbsp oil from drippings, 1 Tbsp added butter, 1 Tbsp dried basil, 1 heaping tsp of red pepper flakes, and 2.5 Tbsp flour--I stirred over medium heat to incorporate. Then I added a 1 tsp beef bouillon, 1/2 can of cream of mushroom, 1/2 can of cream of celery, milk as needed, and about 1/3 cup white wine. I mixed them all together and cooked down until it was a good gravy consistency.

I grabbed the chops from the oven and served them on plates with gravy over the top. Mashed potatoes, roasted asparagus, multi-grain rolls, and grape juice (a wine would have been nice) made it a meal!

I adjusted  cooking time and amounts to accommodate fewer chops.
Also heated the mushroom mixture before pouring over chops. My mother really liked them, which is saying a lot !
They were delicious. Thank you. Will def make these again

Delicious! I only made 3 chops, used panko crumbs, and cut the cooking time with the foil down to 25 minutes.

I absolutely love this dish. I have changed it just a little. I recommend adding just a little bit of honey in the soup mixture. I know it sounds weird but it gives it a tiny bit of sweetness to the dish. overall though this dish is great. my husband absolutely loves it!!! thank you

This is an incredibly wonderful dish!!  After an endless search, I'm SO glad I finally found this recipe AGAIN!  I printed it long ago & prepared it numerous times, and today (New Year's Day) I freaked when I couldn't find it anywhere... really surprised that I hadn't already "saved" & rated it here--I was sure I had.

I follow this recipe as-is, w/the very minor difference that instead of just garlic powder, I add a few more spices by using "Adobo" all-purpose seasoning... this dish comes out phenomenal each and every time!  Do yourself a big favor and try it!

Keeper!  I used thinner, boneless pork cutlets and it came out fantastic!  I had to sub Cream of Chicken for Cream of Mushroom because that was all I had, otherwise I followed exactly. Next time I will skip the salt and garlic powder before breading. Definitely tasted way too salty, but they were so tender and delicious   Will definitely be making agin!

I've made this several times along the years. Like other r viewers I use golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom. I also sautéed mushrooms to go in the sauce. I'm making it tonight for Christmas Eve dinner. I'm going to try using sour cream instead of milk.

I made this several times but changed it on how the breadcrumbs and flour is applied. The first time I did it where I coated the chops separately, it started coming off in the frying pan. So I mix the flour and bread crumbs together and put them in a Ziploc bag where they coated wonderfully and cooked evenly in the frypan.    This recipe taste like something you would eat in a high dollar restaurant. My friends were impressed! This recipe is a keeper!!

Came out great! I took another reviews advice and made more sauce. I took two cans of CoM and used 1/2 cup milk and 3/4 cup white wine I also added white pepper. I also poured the sauce on top and baked at 375 for 45 min cook time. My husband loved it but does want me to try the other review instructions to bake chops and simmer sauce on stove. Next time! Big time keeper!

Rave reviews from my husband. Just a few modifications (based on what I had on hand) - added a liberal amount of Italian seasoning to plain bread crumbs, 2x wine, plus sour cream instead of milk.

I made this last night for the first time and even got courageous enough to have guests!  Everyone loved it.  I took Holly9000's suggestion & doubled the recipe using one can of Golden Mushroom soup.  Next time I will also double the wine :o).  I also used mushrooms and added a little cayenne pepper.  It was a HIT and I will definitely serve it again. I served it with a salad, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Yummm

Had this for supper with Spanish rice and mixed vegetables (Brussels Sprouts, carrots and a little bit of broccoli) it was delicious and I would definitely make it again! I did make a small change to the recipe......I had some mushrooms in the fridge that I wanted to use up so I sliced them and 1/2 an onion and a teaspoon of crushed garlic fried them in a tablespoon of butter and the olive oil that was left in the pan after frying the pork chops, then added them to the mushroom sauce. I decreased the cooking time to 1/2 hour rather than 1 hour. Pork chops were well cooked, tender and delicious!

I made this dish for my husband to take to deer camp.  They like to eat! The only thing I did different was make my own bread crumbs ( bread and Italin seasoning) because I didn't have any.  This is a great easy dish to match up with rice or mashed potatoes.

Love this!  We follow recipe with the addition of a can of golden mushroom soup.  I use the same quantities of milk and wine and use the can of mushroom soup.  Yummy and it makes for more gravy!

I substituted butter for the olive oil- (heating olive oil can change it to a less healthy fat).  After browning the chops and while they were baking, I sauteed some chopped carrots and onions in the butter/drippings then added the wine and soup.  No milk on hand so just went with it.   Added veggies and soup mixture to chops and baked about 15 more mins.  Absolutely fabulous!

Yum!!  Took some advice from other reviewers as I had extra mushrooms in the fridge.  I sauteed them in the pan that the chops fried in and added extra wine when sauteing.  Added the mushrooms to the sauce when baking .  The chops were SOOO tender!  The flavor was SOOO good!  I used Chachere's spice in stead of seasoning salt as that is what I had in my cabinet. Our guests used the sauce over the rice I served.

Fried each side for 5 minutes, baked for 30 minutes, added the sauce and then baked for another 40  minutes.

Delicious. I cheated. I pulled out about 8 frozen pork chops,  separated with some hot water,  fried as directed,  and put in crock pot on high for a few hours. Yummy. I used half of the bread crumbs listed and probably double the milk, wine, and seasonings.  Added chopped onion, real garlic, and mushrooms to liquid mix.  Layered meat and liquid mix into crock pot.

I tried to make this gluten free.  I think that is what made my  pork even more dry.  Cook time is way off no matter what.  Read the others comments.  They are very helpful.  Instead of the saucein this recipe.  I made a white wine reduction with mushrooms.   I found it on this site.

Made this last night to rave reviews, which is difficult to accomplish w/ my picky family. While he was eating, husband is already talking about how much he's looking forward to having it again. He asked me to double the sauce since it was so good on mashed potatoes as well.

I don't often give 5 stars but we loved this recipe!  I used center cut with bone in & fried the full 5 min on each side until they were really fried.  I also sautéed mushrooms & placed them on top of chops before adding sauce.  I doubled the sauce & added a little sour cream in with the soup.  I warmed  all sauce ingredients before placing on top.  Served these over egg noodles.  I too cut down the cooking time.  A total of 1 hr but next time will cook another 10 min longer or so.  Will definitely be making this again!!!

Delicious! This dish will become a staple in my house. As the other reviews suggested, I baked the pork for 35 minutes and warmed the sauce in a pan to pour over the chops when they were done. 35 minutes was just the right amount of time to cook the pork - they were already beginning to lose some moisture. An hour might be good for thicker cuts. I doubled the amount of wine in the sauce (I used a Pinot Grigio, and the flavor of the wine simply was lost in the cream of mushroom before doubling it).

I made this as directed, but without the cream of mushroom gravy.   However, I did serve it with some Mushroom Risotto from Trader Joe's as a side dish.  Delicious!  My husband loved the crunchy coating.

I made the recipe as is & it was perfect! A lot of people said it would be soggy so I didn't pour the cream of mushroom over the chops but put it on the sides so the tops would still be crunchy. Also I'd double the sauce but put it in a skillet to simmer for mashed potatoes. The man loved it!

My family loved this recipe. The pork chops were tender and juicy. The sauce was good but not over powering. They complimented one another very well. I only had to cook the pork chops for 2 &1/2 minutes on each side in the pan and then I poured the sauce on after baking them for only 20 minutes. I baked another 20 minutes and tested them with a meat thermometer and they were done.

This is a good recipe. However, in retrospect, I think it could have been improved by using the same skillet used in browning the pork for preparing the sauce, using dry Marsala wine instead of Chardonnay and adding some very thinly sliced green onions to the mix. I suspect that adding a handful of raisins to the sauce would might make it a bit more interesting. I'll make it again.

This was absolutely delicious. My husband said "These are the best pork chops I have ever had." My mouth dropped open because in the reviews another woman had said that was what her husband said. I did shorten the 60 minutes to 45 minutes also I heated the sauce on the stove and added sauteed onions to the sauce before I poured it over the chops for the additional 30 minutes of baking.

I increased the number of pork chops to 8 in order to freeze a meal, should have doubled sauce ingredients and will next time.  The chops cooked up wonderfully and were as tender as could be.  It does take a little bit of time and I would not cook it too often.  Served over rice this is also a "company" meal.  Your tastebuds will like this.

It was delicious.  So tender and flavorful.  I ate the left overs the next day and it was still delicious.  I didn't use wine or garlic seasoning and I did not miss either one.  My adult daughter recommended this recipe and my husband and I loved it.

So delicious!  I skipped the breading to cut some calories, but still browned the pork chops in an oven-proof skillet. I thinly sliced a small package of mushrooms and added them to the skillet before putting the whole thing in the oven for 25 minutes. I mixed the soup, 1/3 cup milk, and 1/3 cup (plus a little more) Chardonnay and cooked for another 30 minutes. Served over mashed potatoes. It was so delicious and felt so fancy for very little effort!

Made exactly as directed. The chops were very dry. If I decide to try it again, will definitely reduce the cooking time as I have noticed others did. Maybe 30 minutes to start and 15-20 after the sauce is added.

I followed the recipe except for the white wine (i substituted extra milk due to the fact I'm pregnant and don't want to use any alcohol in my recipes). These were probably the BEST pork chops I've ever had. Pork chops always seem to be so dry and these were absolutely perfect! I recommend that unless you're serving all pork chops right away to put the pan back into the oven to keep it warm because i found that the gravy cooled and thickened rather quickly.

I made these as directed but adjusted the cooking time for the size of pork chops I used. My husband ate all of his and then finished my plate! I'll have to make them again to see if it was really that delicious or he was just really hungry!

I love this!! I only used 2 chops so only needed to cook for 35 minutes. I sautéed mushrooms red onion and garlic in a little olive oil and red wine vinegar, and used half mushroom soup half milk with a dash of cayenne for my gravy. It was great! I smothered the chops and baked for another 10 minutes. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe this one's a keeper. Reduced  for 3 boneless chops and followed the recipe as stated with the exception of substituting vermouth for the white wine and reducing the cooking time to 30 and 20 minutes with the sauce. Love the sauce --interesting combination of ingredients with great flavors.

I love this recipe! I've made it as is and now I add a little something, something to the gravy! only garlic and onion powder but this recipes is good as written. For an easy clean up I use paper plates to do the dredging.

These pork chops were so delicious!! I changed a couple things, only because I didn't have some items on hand. Instead of breadcrumbs I crumbled French Onion Sun Chips and I had Mrs. Dash salt-free seasoning so I added a bit of salt. I will definitely be making these again!

Delicious! For the sauce, I substituted soy sauce for white wine and it was perfect. It was the tiniest bit dry, so I don't feel like you need the entire cook time. All in all, it was super yummy!

This was AWESOME! I only baked them in the oven for an hour total though. 40 minutes without the soup/milk/wine mix and 20 minutes with it. 
This was really easy and super yummy. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was fantastic!  I didn't have a bottle of wine available, so I substituted it with lemon juice and water (equal parts) and it was perfect.

It is an easy recipe for anyone to follow, and I would recommend this for anyone.

My family loved this! I took the previous readers advice and made sure the chops were fried pretty good. Frying chops longer cut down on the oven time. I sautéed mushrooms to add to the soup mixture, because I love them. I heated up the soup and added more milk then what recipe called for. I did not use the white wine. I combined mushroom soup mixture on chops and baked for about 20-25 minutes and the food was perfect.

An excellent recipe. Pork was so tender, my guests raved about it. I added fresh mushrooms to the sauce and cut down on the cream of mushroom sauce which had 52% less sodium.

Amazingly delicious! I am not a fan of thick pork chops. Plus I only made four as there is only two of us in our house hold. I seasoned my chips with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Plus I only keep unseasoned bread crumbs, so I added the Italian seasoning to mine crumbs. I did brown the chops maybe a little more than I should have on the skillet.... When I made the mixture I didn't want to open up another bottle of wine so I used some pink mascoto and some dried sliced mushrooms and let that sit. I also only cooked my chops for 30 minutes then added the mushroom soup mixture and cooked another 30 minutes. They smelled amazing as they cooked! Plus they came out so tender! We will for sure be making these again!!!

I can't believe how good this was! I read a couple reviews first and decided to add a can of golden mushroom soup, as well as some thyme, Italian seasoning, and sautéed onions and mushrooms. I didn't have wine, so I used chicken broth. My pork chops were thin, so I cooked for about 20/20. It was so delicious, tender, and surprisingly easy! :D

Great basic pork chop recipe.  Easy to vary to your taste.  As others, I agree 1.5 hrs is too long.  20/20 is fine.  My family didn't care for the sauce.

My husband LOVED these. I found they were okay but I'm not a huge fan of 'breaded' foods. It does take some time to bread them but my husband liked them so much I will be making them again in the future.

I love this recipe. Super easy! I did cut down the cooking time to 35 minutes, and then added the sauce and cooked another 35 minutes. You could easily dress this up with some mushrooms and shredded cheese. The white wine was a great call, could even use less milk and add more wine. Will be making again!!

Good but not very tender. I suggest baking longer with a little more liquid.

sort of made this recipe my own and it was fantastic! Even my picky toddler gobbled it right down and it was requested again before my husband was finished with his plate. Breaded and fried the chops as instructed, 35 minutes was plenty even though I used 8 thin chops since that's what I had. all those bread crumbs were too much so if you don't have 2 c go ahead anyway. While they baked I used 1 can cream of chicken instead and pinot grigio,spooned that over wild rice and the pork chops afterwards, and mm :)

I made 4 chops (on the bone) but calculated for 5 chops. My wife and 2 boys were so impressed. I used Campbell's soup and progresso bread crumbs. My next attempt will be cream of mushroom soup from scratch. If it comes out delicious like the recipe says then I'll use that instead of the canned soup for this oven baked chop.

I give this a 5 with some adjustments.  I agreed with some of the reviews it needed more sauce.  I added one can of golden mushroom soup, used 1/2 cup Pinot Grigio and used half & half instead of milk.  I baked in oven 20 minutes, added sauce for another 25 minutes and it was perfectly tender & plenty of sauce.  Great recipe and thumbs up!  coastiemom

Although the overall cook time turned me off a bit, I dove into this recipe blindly and honestly chose it because I already had most of the ingredients. I am happy to say they turned out great! I was pleasantly surprised! Now that I've made my dish, I have read a few of the reviews and now have a better plan for making these in the future. I would definitely add sauteed mushrooms to compliment the already wonderful dish. Even if you stick to the recipe, I don't think you can go wrong! Enjoy!

I have made this recipe exactly like it is several times for different family members. It comes out perfect every time! And all the compliments aren't bad either. Yes, it makes a lot of dishes,and most folks have a dishwasher. I am one of those folks who does not have a dishwasher and wash them by hand. This recipe is worth all the extra effort!

This was bland, mushy and not at all crispy--ruined perfectly good fried pork chops by proceeding with recipe.  Also this recipe is waaayyy too much work for an end product that's not great.

This recipe was great!  I used thin pork chops so I cut down on the cooking time to 30/30.  I also doubled the sauce b/c we are gravy lovers.  This turned out perfect and I didn't have to ask anyone if they wanted seconds, they were already out of their chairs with a new plate full!

We love this pork chop recipe. Typically I'm not a fan of pork chops because they become dry and tough after cooked. Not this recipe! Pork chops come out very tender with a wonderful gravy for mashed potatoes. Although this is a two step process , it's very easy. I won't make them any other way!

Used four very thick pork chop cutlets.  Followed recipe and placed everything in the crockpot.   Did add sliced fresh mushrooms on top.  The pork chops were so tender and the sauce was very creamy.  Served it with rice.  Will make again!

I have made this recipe for 12, 4 and just my husband and I. It gets better every time!! I use Marsala cooking wine or cooking sherry, add sautéed mushrooms,  and let it bake in the soup mixture a little longer. You can cut the meat with a fork!! Wonderful taste and very easy to prepare!

Made this dish with everything called for in it, I just salt, peppered and garlic powdered the meat before the flour, egg, breading process, I also added shredded parmesan to bread crumbs, which were Panko, also added a small amount of sauteed mushrooms, onion, and minced garlic to soup mixture. I used boneless pork chops, browned in skillet then baked at 350 for 30, poured soup, then covered and baked only 20 min more. They turned out very tender and delicious. My son had two and he's not real big on sauces, but said he liked how these turned out.

This is good old-fashioned comfort food. The chops were very tender, which is a must for me. Double the gravy if you are serving over rice. The only thing I changed was to cook for only 30 minute before adding gravy (but my chops were pretty thin), and substituted white grape juice because I didn't have any white wine. This was great as is, but it would also work well if  you added flavors to suit your tastes.

The flavor was good but the cooking time is way too much. I should have baked for a much shorter time. I want to try again with less cooking time.

I loved this recipe! I made a few adjustments based on our personal taste. Instead of bread crumbs we used 1/4 butter crackers and 3/4 FF Onion. We also added fresh mushrooms to the soup, milk, wine mixture.

Not bad, but cooking time is way too long.  It dried out the meat.

This recipe was uncomplicated and came together quickly. The flavor was just ok, nothing remarkable, but not a "thumbs down", either. I used an ovenproof, lidded skillet to brown the chops (I used the thick ones from Costco), then put everything, sauce and all, in the oven at 250 or 275 for a couple of hours while we went to a movie. The texture of the meat came out tender, almost like a pot roast - I did not have to use a knife to cut it. The sauce was good on rice, but I would say we found this dinner to be a little rich. I will keep this recipe in mind for when I want a no-brainer dinner because of its ease and because I do almost always have the ingredients on hand, but it won't be a "go-to" for us. I noticed that many people are raving about this recipe - I suppose if one was accustomed to eating bland food or cereal for dinner, this would seem stellar, but I think there are better ways of preparing pork chops.

Maybe not the healthiest of recipes, but DELISH!!  Used 1can of golden mushroom and 1 can of cream of mushroom. Everything else was by the original recipe and it was wonderful. A perfect fall entree!

I used chicken instead of mushroom and added fresh mushroom.  Used thin cut pork chops to cut down on the cooking time.  It turned out great! Will be saving this recipe for sure.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and I thought it tasted absolutely terrible. There wasn't one thing I enjoyed about these pork chops. The breading was overdone on the bottom, and after cooking was finished, the breading was unbearably soggy. Understandably, I knew it would be soggy after sitting in the sauce, but I expected the breading to at least taste good. It was so unbearably salty, particularly with the addition of the cream of mushroom, and eventually I just peeled off the breading and ate the pork chop by itself. Will definitely not be making these again.

I thought this was great. I forgot to cover the pork chops so I cooked them till they were brown about 45 min. I diced up some onion and celery and cooked it in canola oil before adding the ingredients for the sauce.  I used cream of chicken soup because that was all I had but bet the mushroom would have been great especially with form fresh mushrooms cut up in it.  I added the garlic powder and celery salt and whatever othe spices to the bread crumbs.  I added the sauce to the pork chops, covered with foil and let cook for a half hour.  My bf didn't like it but he isn't a fan of pork chops.  I thought this was an easy and grat recipe. Thanks!

I didn't do sauce. Made chicken gravy for a dip. Tasted amazing. Kids loved. Need to flip them halfway through cooking to crisp both sides. Mashed potatoes side!

I think baking them for an hour and a half was a bit of an overkill in my opinion, they were texturally unappealing.  I had a great cut of meat and do not understand why they would end up this way.

Followed the most helpful suggestions. Made the recipe as written but added one can of golden mushroom soup. Also increased wine to 1/2 C. With good browning, baking time was 20 minutes followed by 30 minutes. It made such great leftovers that I'll bet you could make this on Sunday and just refrigerate the whole pan for an easy weeknight meal!

Prep time was a little lengthy for a weeknight dinner if you are a working mother like me. However, the chops were moist and delicious once done! I also used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of golden mushroom as someone else had suggested. These were very good and I will make them again!

I used boneless chops so I baked for 25 minutes without sauce, and another 20 with the sauce. They were AWESOME! The chops I used had actually been frozen so I was worried they'd be dry and flavorless, but this recipe kept them juicy and tasty!

I liked this recipe it reminded me of country fried steak which I like.  My husband gave it a two.  Probably won't make again.  Also, I used thick chops, but think it would be better with thin chops, because the meat was pretty dry.

Great! I was surprised at how simple this recipe is yet it was really delicious. I only made 2 pork chops but used the same amount of sauce and it was enough (I love having plenty to dunk my pork in) so I'd recommend increasing the amount. I also put it in the oven for 35 min. Very juicy and tender! Thanks

I made this as directed but I should've read the reviews first.  The chops are beyond moist and tender but when you add the soup mixture, it makes it mushy.  Next time I won't cook the chops with the soup mixture on it.

Excellent!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked 45/20.  I also used two cans od golden mushroom soup, half cup of wine, and half cup milk.  Delicious.

kids enjoyed, but I thought the gravy just made things soggy.  Not too much taste once you smothered the fried chop.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I had some beautiful pork chops from Costco, and this was a nice and simple recipe.  The only thing I added was fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this tonight and we loved it. I changed only a couple of things. I used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom....because I had it in the pantry. And I didn't have any wine, so I doubled the milk per the suggestion of another reviewer. My husband thought it was great. I spiced it up a little too, but we use a lot of seasonings in all our recipes. I will definitely make this again. Thank you.

Love it! I tried these with turkey chops and they cook much quicker than pork would. The sauce is perfect and creamy and the recipe is not too greasy at all. Delicious!

The only change I made was the bread crumbs.  I used my own cornflake crumb mixture.  I baked for one hour total.  The pork chops were very tender and had plenty of flavor.  I would make this recipe again.

My hubby hate mushrooms, so Iuses two cans of Cream of Chicken soup for eight chops.  I did use white wine, but not a dry wine, my hubby likes Mascato.  Since pork chops work well with a fruity sauce, I figured it would do well,and it did.  Leftover wine was actually pretty good...lol.   I did fryto a crisp, but make sure fire is not to high.  I did bake for 35 mins, and pured sauce on to bake for 20mins more.  Came out great!  Had to leftover the next day, decided to make a sandwich in between sesame buns,.loved it.  To bad my sis stole the other one.

Not impressed. I wish I would have just forgot pouring the sauce over the chops because the breading became a pile of mush.  The sauce was bland also.  The photo showed brown gravy over the potatoes which was misleading as I thought that was the "gravy" the sauce made.  Not a keeper for me.

I love the other reviews. I too adjusted and made some changes. I had no eggs, so I dipped chops in sour cream, flour and Panko crumbs. Omitted the wine, as I don't drink alcohol and cooked for 45 minutes total. Nice dish. But 1 1/2 in the oven for pork chops is too long for my liking. Thanks for posting and all the reviews!

My wife is the only one in our family that likes pork chops.  I made this recipe and everyone, including my picky daughters, inhaled it.  I made a slight modification in that I used 1/2C of cream instead of milk.  Other than that I was true to the recipe!

Excellent recipe. Didn't change a thing. Family loved the flavor and they were good and tender. I used nice thick loin chops, and it wasn't soggy at all. You CANNOT forget the breading and pre browning process, it makes this dish.

I know some hate when others review a recipe after altering it. I enjoy this because it gives more options and ideas! I followed others and added a can of golden mushroom. I also topped w some extra sautéed mushrooms at the end. I used bone in chops and cooked for 20/20 ish. They were slightly too done. I felt they were a smidge soggy even though I browned very thoroughly. BUt, they still tasted delish! I will make these again! Probably will give boneless chops a whirl next time.

Thought this recipe was great. Did take the advise of other reviewers and made sure the chops were fried till crisp. But be careful not to burn. Then baked for 20 minutes added the mushroom mixture and baked another 20 minutes. They were perfect; moist and tender! I did cut the recipe in half since I only made 2 chops and had just enough sauce, so definitely double if making more.

My family devoured an entire double recipe in two days.  There are never leftovers long enough for me to take any to work!  It is well-worth the time needed to prepare this dish.  I used homemade breadcrumbs, and also have made it with pork steaks.  It's wonderful every time.

These pork chops were fabulous!  The flavor of the sauce was to die for.  I used a roasted garlic cream of mushroom and I will use that every time I make this.  The whole family loved these!  Thanks for a great - and easy - recipe!

This recipe is great.  Of course, I read the reviews and made some changes.  I agree, you have to wait until the oil is hot and then place the chops in the pan.  I fried them 2-3 minutes on each side.  I only placed them in the oven for 45 minutes. Then for the sauce I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken, substituted chicken broth for the wine and only used 1/4 cup of milk.  Poured sauce over chops and baked for another 15 minutes. Delicious!  Had enough sauce to pour over the rice w/ the chops.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I love this recipe and have been making it for years.  It's my husbands favorite.  I do double the sauce and I started using panko bread crumbs that I season with Italian seasoning as they seem to stay crispy.  I normally add a little extra wine and cook it an extra 10 minutes to reduce the gravy down more.

This recipe is my new favorite. Love it. I didn't have seasoning salt so I used Mrs. Dash seasoning original. And also should have read all reviews and used nonstick pan and a spray. They only stuck a little. I used boneless pork chops which i had on hand and it was still awesome. I also passed it on to my daughters.

I have never tried to make pork chops before because I didn't like them as a kid. These are amazing! My kids devoured them!! I did the recipe exactly as stated, except shortening the cooking time. I also think I would leave off the sauce and add it on the side to dip as desired. The taste was great, it was just too heavy on the chops. So glad I was willing to give this a try!

I made these tonight for the very first time for my finance and myself.  I like pork but he didnt seem like he was such a fan UNTIL this recipe.  I have to tell you this recipe was amazing!!!  This pork fell off the bone it was so incredibly juicy.  It had the perfect amount of seasoning too!  I cant say enough.  I will be definitely making these again!!

I've been experimenting lately and trying new recipes. This was tonight's dinner selection. Although I tried to make exactly as written I did have to make some changes due to what I had available. My DH & I both really liked and I will definitely try again. My error came when I replaced the white wine and milk with beef broth as I'd seen in another review.  My hubby is a saltaholic and this was too salty. Not so much you couldn't eat but still too much.  I also reduced my cooking time to 30 min. on each side and it was perfectly tender and good.

This is AWESOME.  The only changes I make now (after making this ATLEAST a dozen times) is to lessen the amount of wine and decrease the cooking time in the oven. It dries out way to much if you bake for the full time recommended. Other than that this is one of my favorite recipes on this website

This is a pretty decent recipe but I did add a few things. Also the cooking times seem to be too long. I cut the cook time in half because those would have been very dry pork chops. I also added sour cream, a little bit of Dijon, and salt n pepper to the soup mixture. My kids loved it.

Made as written except subbed white grape juice for wine.  The family loved it.  My only advice would be to not cook it for as long as the recipe states, that is way too long.

I made a few changes to this recipe as an experiment and it turned out pretty good.  I salted and peppered the pork cubes and also added all spice, I then coated the cubes in all purpose flour and sauteed them in veg oil until golden brown.  At that time I added the rest of the ingredients without the cinnamon.  I added a 1 tsp. of Cayenne pepper just for kicks.  Family didn't complain, I live to cook another day.

This was absolutely amazing!!  The only variation I made was adding 2 cans of Golden Mushroom soup so that we would have enough sauce for our potatoes.  I will admit that I made 4 good sized chops with mashed potatoes for my husband and I....there were no leftovers!!  Absolutely will make again and soon!!

Loved this recipe!  Followed pretty exactly with the exception of cooking time and adding in sautéed onion, mushrooms, and garlic to the sauce.  Delicious!  Oh, also switched the portion of milk and wine.  Had a really good flavor.

I made these for dinner last night and followed the directions and the whole family loved them!  They came out super tender and flavorful and the sauce just put it over the top and was delicious!  I will definitely be making these again.  Next time though I will grease the pan first because the crust of the chops stuck to the pan and came off of the chops.  So make sure and grease your pan first!

Delicious recipe! Added more seasoning like basil, oregano, paprika and Mrs Dash. Didn't have white wine so doubled the milk. Used two cans of mushroom soup. Everything was really good. The pork was cooked perfectly and my husband LOVED it!

5 stars for the pork chops, but 3 stars for the sauce. (It just didn't do it for me - too "mushroomy." We had to add a lot of seasoning to make it a bit less bland.) The meat was delicious and moist after 45 minutes for two thick boneless chops. Yum!

Yummers! I made this yesterday for my aunt's 93rd birthday party and we were in ecstasy. I followed the recipe exactly except for cooking them at 325 because I had a casserole in the oven at that temperature. The boneless chops were fork tender.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written...all the same ingredients, nothing else added.  I never make pork, so I was excited to give it a try!  I read some of the reviews and I made sure to brown both sides well before putting in the oven...they smelled fantastic and when they were finished, they were beautiful!  They were Better Homes & Gardens picture worthy!  Oh, I used bone-in porkchops that were about an inch thick.  They were tender and we cut them with the side of our forks...but they were dry.  The breading was awesome and the gravy was really good too, but the porkchops were dry and bland.  We ate them, they weren't horrible and the gravy and breading did help, but I won't make them again.  Mainly I won't make them again because the meat was so dry....but i'm thinking this might be awesome on chicken breasts....buuuuut then i'm just another one of those people changing the recipe!  haha...good luck!

I cooked my in the skillet....you really have to let your pan get hot to get them brown....look for smoke.  I liked the idea of making the sauce in a separate pot so we could add as much or as little as wanted.  Good receipe....the cooking times seem to be off unless you're using a really thick chop.

It's a really great taste and it seemed moderately healthy as well.  I will say it took a lot of prep for what's juts porkchops, but it was worth it in the end!  It wasn't my daughter's favorite meal though.

The moistest pork chop I have EVER made.  Normally my husband grills our meats but I decided to try something indoors & this was a hit.  Didn't change anything.  I was worried about the amount of baking time but followed the directions & it came out perfect!

My family loved this recipe.  Followed directions exactly except doubled sauce, used golden mushroom & regular mushroom soup.  Didn't bake as long as instructed, maybe 25 minutes? Would be great with mashed potatoes or rice.

This was very yummy.  However I think the bread crumbs could be reduced to 1 cup.  By doing this the calorie count reduces as well to 313.

Awesome, easy, and pretty to serve.  Used French cut chops and added thin sliced baby bellas.  Cooked it less, and used an Anolon covered casserole, no foil.  My husband raved.

This was easy and fantastic. Definitely cut down and halve the flour and breading. You don't need that much. When your water evaporates in the pan, you do not need to add more. The chops come out so tender. I have been looking for a good chop recipe and this is it!

Followed the directions, but added fresh sauteed mushrooms to the sauce.  I baked 30/30 as the pork was done when I added the gravy.  YUM!  Maybe people who say the recipe was bland didn't season the pork chops first.

These were good.  I always have a hard time making pork tender.  I followed suggestions from others and did not cook them as long.  I made thick center cut boneless chops and they came out tender and juicy.

I made this exactly as written, except for how long it cooked since I had thinner pork chops (3/4") and neither my husband or I cared for it.  The flavor of the breading just didn't really complement the pork.  My pork chops weren't very tender, but it might have just been the cut.  They weren't that easy, so next time I will probably just make shake 'n bake.

This is one of my favorite recipes you know what, it is the BEST pork chop recipes!  The only way I make this though is with rib eye pork chops.  They are very tender and juicy with the gravy.  Also I add 2 cans of cream of mushrooms.  A excellent pork recipe 5 stars!

Pork chops can be so boring but not with this dish. My husband and I loved it! I wasn't sure about adding the cream of mushroom soup but it was a hit! The texture on the chops was crispy and I loved the sauce! I will making this one again!!

This recipe was awesome!  I doubled the soup/milk mixture and poured it over the pork chops plus a small package of mini bella mushrooms (pre-sauteed) and a bunch of asparagus.  Yummy, yummy!  My husband said it was a perfect meal.

I am not a great cook ... this recipe was easy to follow and the results were great. My family gave it rave reviews. I didn't have the white cooking wine but it was fine without it.

I was serving a larger group so I had a couple more chops than called for.  I did 1 1/2 times the breading mixture and double the gravy.  My family enjoyed it but next time I would play around with the gravy mixture. I personally would have liked it to be a little less cream of mushroom.  Maybe by using 1 can golden mushroom as mentioned in some of the other reviews.  I made a couple of chops without the gravy for a picky children.  They baked nicely too.

Really good! It was a little salty though, probably wouldn't salt the chops during the coating process since the soup has lots of salt. Thanks for the recipe!

this was by far the best pork chops I have ever made! 
the whole family loved it. I make pork chops infrequently since they always come out dry. these were tender as can be, I used at least 1" thick chops and gave extra cook time and they were still tender. the sauce was amazing and really made the chops. we will definitely make these again!

I really liked this recipe alot! (as did the rest of my family)It was so easy! As a beginner cook I need easy and good. My husband was always the cook in the family but that changed recently. I used low fat cream of mushroom soup and only about half of the wine and I thought it turned out great!!

This was really good. I didn't brown the pork chops first, I just put them in the baking dish and covered it with foil. I didn't want to dirty more dishes. It did turn out a little soggier than I would have liked but it still tasted good. My family really liked it. I think next time I may add a package of dry onion soup mix to the soup mixture. That sounds good too.

This is an awesome recipe, even with gluten-free substitutions. My family loved it. These were the best pork chops that I've ever made. My new go-to recipe for pork chops. 
Gluten-free substitutions:
Coconut flour for regular flour
Gluten-free cream of mushroom soup
I left out the bread crumbs. Next time I'll try it without the coconut flour. I'll just season the meat and brown both sides. The coconut flour was a little grainy. Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this for dinner and my family LOVED it. I had to alter the recipe to make it gluten free (rice flour for the regular flour, GF breadcrumbs and GF Mushroom soup) and I used almond milk instead of regular milk. In place of the wine,  I also GF beef bouillon, soy sauce and worcestershire sauce to give the gravy a little less "cream of whatever" dish .  I fried the chops until well browned as directed in the recipe.  The ONLY reason this is a three star recipe vs a five star is the directed cooking time.  I baked the dish for 30 minutes covered, added the gravy and cooked for 30 minutes uncovered for an hour total baking time. An hour and a half in the oven for already partially cooked pork chops seems a bit excessive.  All in all a great dish that my family has requested be put in the regular lineup!

I followed the recipe to a tee and my breading turned out mushy and fell off the chop. I either didn't crumb them enough or didn't brown them enough. I'll try it again- so many people rave about it!

FANTASTIC!  This is the best pork chop recipe I've ever had!  My husband and I licked up every drop of the sauce. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the sauce and cut the cooking time to 30 & 20 minutes. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Cheers!

This was great! My son don't like mushrooms so I left the chop plain, he still loved it. I replaced the wine with apple juice and use 2/4 of it , which made extra for gravy. I also added a onion that I had cook with garlic to the sauce.  Yum! Reading the reviews helped a lot.  Make sure grease it hot! I also cooked chops 30/20. They were boneless , next time I'm going to use bone in .  And yes there is quite a clean up so this meal is not for a person who has had a long day at work. Good meal though !

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  The pork chops were so tender and full of flavor!  I didn't have any white wine - but I don't think the sauce suffered for it.  I just left it out.  Soooo good - you may want to double the sauce so you can cover mashed potatoes or rice with it.  We will definitely be making these again.  So worth all the dirty dishes and time it takes to cook them!

These pork chops are so good!  I doubled the sauce portion...basically the soup, milk and wine because I serve this with mashed potatoes everyone wants the "gravy" to put on top of the potatoes!  Love it!!

Tried this last night with sides of garlic/parmesan mashed potatoes, green beans, and corn. Definitely the best chops I've ever made. I forgot to flip before adding the mushroom soup and I had to use beer since I had no wine, but it still turned out spectacular.

This recipe was a hit with my family!  I will make them again.  I used Ritz crackers with Italian seasoning instead of bread crumbs and then added extra garlic and seasoned salt to the flour to insure there would be plenty of flavor.  I cooked them 30/30 and that was perfect.  My chops were fairly thick too.

Great recipe!  I actually forgot to season them but in the end didn't need it.  I also cooked them for an hour in the soup mixture. Meat was falling away from the bone.  Made with fried potatoes and put the gravy on them.  As my kids said 
"This is a do again!"

This was really good and simple! I wasn't paying attention and thought the ingredients called for 'italian seasoning' so I added that to the 'italian' bread crumbs and it still turned out fantastic. I also used pork loin and only prepared two of them so I simply cut down the ingredient quantities. I hate doing extra dishes so I left my meat on a plate and hand-pat the flour on, dredged in the egg and then sprinkled and hand pat the bread crumbs on. This was quick and saved dirty dishes, I also used my toaster oven to bake them.  The actual preparation time is minimal which makes it nice to throw together and then do something else for an hour while it bakes If you are not sure about the cooking time invest $3 on a meat thermometer, your food will be cooked to perfection every time. So easy and so good!

Amazing!  However, you don't need as much of the bread crumbs as it calls for.  1 cup is sufficient.

Delicious.  One of our favorites.  I don't always have croutons so I just crush crackers.  Did not have wine a couple times and it was fine that way too.  I usually only use half the wine anyway.

I have a large family and cook homemade meals almost every night, and out of everything I cook, this is my very favorite meal.  The pork chops are so, fall apart tender...but the best part is the sauce.  I could drink it.  I always make at least 10 pork chops because it is a bit time consuming but mostly because if there are leftovers, they are wonderful.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great!  We loved it!  I used Wente Chardonnay.  I thought the pork would come out dry after cooking that long, but it was very tender.  The sauce also was a nice surprise how good it was (and simple to make).  Will make again.

Making now! Using Spartan chicken stuffing mix instead of breadcrumbs. Browned well as another user suggested. Used all other ingredients suggested. Also put in a 9 x 9 glass serving dish of Yukon Gold potatoes, sliced in 1/2, chopped onion, seasoning, butter covered in oven with it....yum. smells good!

I had thick chops (about 2 inches), and the cooking time on this was still WAY off. I seared mine 2 minutes per side and then baked for 40 minutes total, and they were overdone. :( That's my fault for not checking them sooner, but the 90 minutes suggested here is insane; no piece of cut meat bakes for that long at 350! Watch your chops carefully and take out when they are medium done as they continue to cook. 

The sauce was delicious. After I seared the chops, I deglazed the pan with the win - make sure you do this! It picks up so much flavor! I used more wine than called for (about double), the added the cream of mushroom soup, and sour cream instead of milk. I used a little milk to thin down the sauce. 

Very tasty despite being overdone!

I made this meal last night and my family loved it, took the advice from previous viewers and double the sauce. I used cream of  chicken with mushroom and it was great. I also fried the pork chops and placed them in the oven with the sauce for 35 min and the pork chops were tender and juicy.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic. Normally I don't like reading and/or writing reviews when substitutions are made before trying the actual recipe as written, but for this one it doesn't matter. Made the first time as written, and the pork chops were the moistness and most tender pork chops I have ever had bake. The next time I made it we had company that did not want anything with alcohol in it, so I substituted 1/3 cup apple juice (with 1 teaspoon vinegar mixed in) for the wine, and I thought this tasted even better. The next time I made it I substituted 1/3 white grape juice (with 1 teaspoon vinegar mixed in) for the wine, and it was still great. When I make this, there is no need to get out any knives, a fork is all you need. Cleanup is a little messy though.

First, let me say I am not a huge pork chop fan.  So, I am never in a hurry to make chops.  lol  That being said, the family loves them so I make them.  This recipe is THE BOMB!!!  It is so good, as is without any changes.  The family loved it, and so did I.  I will make this again and again.  Very tender, and juicy, and just so yummy.

Really tasty! Added a few shakes(tablespoon) of dried onion soup mix to the soup mixture just for extra flavor bc I had to omit the wine (didn't have any) but it would be good without it too. Hubby said we should add this to our regular meal rotation!

One word 'Yummy". I would have rated the recipe as a 5 star but I took some advice from the reviews. I added 1 can of cream of mushroom and one can of Golden Mushroom. I added fresh mushrooms and it was delicious. I will make again for sure.

I dove right into this recipe... did not read any of the reviews, and LOVED IT!! I left out the wine, but did everything else the same as the original recipe suggested. I thought the pork chops turned out wonderfully delicious, very flavorful. I am NOT a good cook, I found his recipe easy to follow.

Simply delicious! We made no changes. I wish the chops we had used were a better quality. They did come out a bit tough, but I blame the meat, not the recipe.

I tried this recipe last night for a change on the normal fried pork chops. I REALLY don't like cream of mushroom soup but my husband loves it so I figured I'd give it a try. The only changes I made is that I sauteed a small onion in the pan before adding the white wine (which I increased a little). I also decreased the baking time to 10/20 as my chops were boneless and not that thick. I'll definitely be making this again!

used garlic powder, onion powder, pepper & just a bit of salt. Also forgot to use flour, just dipped in egg then plain bread crumbs & fried in olive oil. Did not have white wine. Added 1 package of low sodium chicken bouillon dissolved in 1/2 cup hot water and mixed with 1 can of mush soup. Baked covered in foil for 30 mins added soup mixture, covered again and baked for another 30 minutes. I used 1 inch bone in chops and they were very tender and juicy. Hubby loved them!

I have not over eaten in a long time nor have I ever writen a review on this site, until I came across this recipe.  This recipe was absolutely AMAZING!   I am pregnant so the wine flavoring was great! I only changed 2 things... I added pepper when seasoning the pork chops. and I cooked them at 400 covered for 30 minutes, added the cream of mushroom mixture and cooked another 30 minutes uncovered. They were so moist and delicious!! We will have this again soon!

Very tasty.  Everyone said it was better than their own recipe for the same dish.  The coating fell off of parts of some of them but altogether it was really good.  I'm not big on pork chops but I really enjoyed this.

Amazing... That about sums it up.. No one could believe how tender these were.. I was a little short on time so I cut the baking time to 35 minutes and 30 minutes and they were definitely done.. These are a lot of work to make and far from healthy but excellent for special occasions... Next time I may consider draining the fat before adding the soup mixture.. But if you are willing to do the work and the extra dishes I recommend these

Yum! Not really a very healthy way to make pork chops, but they sure tasted good.

After reading thru the list of ingredients I could see that additional spices were needed. I seasoned my chops with paprika, crushed rosemary leaves, minced garlic and course ground pepper. I wan't quite sure about the breading process but in all fairness to the author and in order to review this recipe, I breaded my chops. As other reviewers said 5 minutes of browning is too much. It smelled great but my breading started to burn after 2 minutes. I think it would be better to brown the chops in a very hot oven (425 to 450 degrees) for 15 to 20 minutes then reduce oven temp to 350 degress and finish baking them for about 30 minutes. Too much mushroom sauce. I would drizzle sauce ontop of chops after baking time. This recipe is not so quick and easy. Too many steps that led to ALOT of dishes. With that said, I will go clean my kichen now.

Excellent recipe. I used large chops and baked for 50 minutes. I also added 6 oz of sour cream. Next time, I'll double the sauce, though.

My hubby was wanting a main dish that resembled something from our past, and this fit the bill.  I did brine the pork chops in water, sugar, salt, rosemary, and thyme four hours before baking them.  I also added mushrooms to the sauce but left out the milk.  Otherwise, the recipe was the same (not really big changes).  The breading stayed on the pork chops perfectly, and they were tender and deliciously done in an hour from start to finish.  He especially thanks you for our meal!

Great recipe!!! Not being a fan of pork I thought I would give this a try! Boy am I glad I did.  I did do a couple things differently to change it up a little.  I used cream of celery soup (because I don't really care for mushrooms) and used red wine because that's what I had on hand!! Delicious!!

This recipe was very good and I definitely will be making this one again!  I added fresh mushrooms and cracked black pepper to the sauce mixture and substituted the white wine with a splash of white wine vinegar - the flavors turned out great!  Served this dish with mashed potatoes and petite green peas.

Made this last week and it was delicious! I used boneless loin chops and they were fork tender. Since I only had 3 chops I halved the dry ingredients & used 1 egg but there was still a lot of waste. Next time may do 6 chops, 2 eggs and still halve the dry ingredients.  My husband can't stop talking about how good these were to people!

Made this last night and it was really good! The whole family liked it! I baked the pork chops for 30 minutes covered (they were thin chops). I think the time listed in the recipe is way to long. I made the soup/wine mix on the stove and we used it as more of a pour over gravy instead of baking it all together. I liked the idea of the chops staying a little crispier. Overall a tasty meal!!

Very good recipe! I did follow some of the advice and only baked for 30/30. Here is something to consider... this was VERY filling. I would cut the meat in half and only have one side. I made it with mashed potatoes and peas nearly 5 hours ago and I'm still completely stuffed. Sooo yummy though!

DELICIOUS!! Tender meat with a great crunchy outside coating and a thick, creamy sauce. Better than my mother's and hers were great, which is why I searched high and low for a comparable recipe..but this one outdoes hers by a long shot. This recipe goes in my box.

It was a good breaded recipe. I didn't try the soup on top because I was happy with just the chop. Next time I may cook it for less time in the oven; the pork was a little dry, but not too dry.

This recipe is the best pork chop recipe ever.  I'm not a big pork chop fan  but I've given this recipe to all my friends and they all loved it.  I didn't change a thing.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.  I use Allrecipes all the time and never wrote a review until now.

I found this recipe early last week, today I made it again.  I removed the wine, we aren't big wine fans.  Added another can of mushroom soup so there would be more for gravy on the mashed potatoes I had with it. My family has loved it both times.  A keeper!!

Excellent. I was surprised at how good this came out. Just be careful how many of these you eat, I made myself sick. There's a lot of fat between the oil and soup.

My family loved this!  Thumbs up around the table is always a beautiful thing in this house of picky eaters.  I was shocked to find I did not have any oil in the house when I started to prepare dinner.  No time to run to store, so I used a block of vegetable shortening.  I only fried chops for about 2 minutes per side.  I also only baked for 40 minutes, added gravy and baked another 30.  Turned out just fine.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  YUM!

This recipe is awesome. I will use this again and again. The sauce/gravy is do die for. My 18yr old nephew had 2 helpings. Use the sauce recipe for a chicken gravy as well, or for oven cooked steaks.

Thanks for sharing.

This was an awesome recipe! I do not eat meat however I do cook it for my family. They absolutely loved this recipe. They said the pork chops was tender and tasty as well as the gravy. The only complaint that I had was they needed more gravy. I served this with cream cheese mashed potatoes.

The pork chops were amazing! I did take other reviewers advice and cooked the chops for 35 minutes by themselves and only about 20 minutes in the soup mixture. I used plain bread crumbs because I had them. I also put 3 cloves of sliced garlic in about half the recommended oil and cooked the trimmed off excess fat, then browned the chops for about 3 minutes each side.

This recipe is GREAT! I did do a few things differently. I didn't have cream of mushroom, so I substituted cream of chicken instead. Also, I cooked it for 30 min. w/out the cream of chicken/milk mixture and then 30 min. with it on. (So, 30 min. less than it said) Husband loved it!!

The whole family loved it! I added the seasoning salt and garlic powder to the chops the night before, omitted the wine, used 2 cans of soup. I sauteed garlic and sliced fresh mushrooms in a little olive oil then added the soup and milk then poured it on the chops half way through baking. Served it with mashed potatoes.

Our family gave this 5 stars. I didn't find that it required the whole cooking time in the oven, but my oven runs hot. The only change we made was we used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, because that's what we had on hand. I'm sure it would taste great with the mushroom too.

Delicious!!!  This was the first time I had ever cooked pork chops.  I added some canned mushrooms to the sauce and I'm so glad that I did.  (I love mushrooms!)  I only cooked it for a total of 45 minutes (1 hr 30 seemed like a really long time compared to other recipes and reviews).

Very good.
I cheated and used crispy shakin Bake to which I added a bunch of Garlic Plus seasoning.  Still used the egg before coating.
I'll eat this again and again and again :)

I tried pork chops for the very first time.  I realized I'm just not that big a fan of pork meat.  Aside from that, this dish is fantastic.  Hope to make it with chicken or steak cuts next time.

Made this tonight for dinner. The only thing I changed (which was accidental) was I did not add bread crumbs. This recipe was really good. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it and didn't miss the bread crumbs at all! Had this with rice, red beans and sliced tomatoes. Just like mom made it!!!

Really tasted.  I opted for using only bread crumbs and used olive oil instead of the eggs.  It was still as tasty...I also added mushrooms to top it off.  We loved it!!  It is rich.

I am currently cooking some scalloped potatoes to go with this recipe and just had to review these pork chops now! THIS RECIPE IS JUST DELICIOUS! I used pre-seasoned pork chops from the store that looked amazing but besides that I followed the recipe to a T and it is just perfect. The pork chops melt in your mouth! We hate mushrooms and although I still followed the recipe my boyfriend can't even tell! He is waiting impatiently right now since I let him try a bite! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, I will be making this for friends and family forever and have added it to my recipe box! Mine don't necessarily look like the photo but who cares, Yum x 10!

Fabulous recipe, tried this last night and was totally impressed.  I had a girlfriend over that I had not seen in years, a little worried how this would turn out.  It was a hit and I will definately cook this again and again.  It was moist and the flavor was to die for..  I had brown rice on the side and the sauce was wonderful over the rice.

This recipe was pretty good! The pork chops were very moist. I used a thick cut chop. I just wasn't crazy about the flavor. But I am sure that is just a matter of personal taste. Thanks!

I'm not a fan of cream of mushroom soup, so I usually make with cream of chicken.  We aren't wine drinkers, so I omit that.  I've also made it using chicken and it turns out great.  Thanks!

Excellent way of cooking pork chops.  They turn out very tender and YUMMY! Thanks for the good recipe! (Allergic to something in canned soups, so used homemade white sauce.)

First time I made this, I used Costco's chops, which tend to be so dried out by the time they are done.  This was very moist and tender.  My picky (it's only good one way) husband really liked them.  He suggested I follow the same recipe tonight (thin chops).  I did not have cream of mushroom soup, but I did have fresh shitakes, so I improvised and made my own based on a recipe at this web site.  No chopping or anything.  I don't measure, I just use it as a guide.  Turned out great!

I haven't made pork chops in years, so was reluctant to try this. It was amazing! I just wish I would have made more for leftovers! I made a few modifications: I used fresh garlic and fresh sauteed mushrooms and a little bit of sour cream, instead of the soup. I didn't have any wine. I look forward to making this again; next time will make extra for leftovers!

Easy to make, substituted the olive oil with margarine but the chops still came out beautifully crispy and juicy.

Very good recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, only adjusting the bake time by the size/thickness of the chops. (Mine only needed 35 minutes) Served with baked beans, corn bread and skillet potatoes. It was a hit. :)

Excellent flavor!  Really enjoyed this recipe.  Served it with mash potatoes which soaked up the gravy nicely.

My boyfriend and I loved this! He said it came out "fantastic." I'm a beginner cook so it took me about an hour of prep time, not 30 mins. But I am really happy with this recipe. It's the first I tried on this site. Thanks!

The pork was very tender and flavorful.  i think next time I will warm gravy and serve with the pork and potatoes.  I doubled gravy using 1/2 crm mushroom and 1/2 golden muchroom.

I shared the pork chops, using this recipe, with my neighbor and she said "I'm 80 years old and this it the best meal I have ever eaten"

I served mashed potatoes and corn to go with the pork chops.


Because of the calories, fat, etc. I will only fix this on very special occasions

To anyone who modified the recipe...too bad...it is perfect...white wine is the key and Moscato was Devine to use...wish I could rate with more stars...even my 19 year old made this for his girlfriend...easy and if you clean as you go...not a mess to clean up at all. Thank you for sharing.

I can't figure out why this recipe is so highly rated. I agree with the mom of boys whose family couldn't choke it down. I thought the pork chops turned out completely mushy and flavorless. Maybe I am just not a fan of baked pork chops.

Excellent recipe! I made this according to the recipe other than I only used 3 thick cut center chops instead of 6 and lacking tin foil I baked them for 1/2 an hour uncovered then just added the sauce and cooked another 1/2 hour. They came out wonderfully delicious, fully cooked, and with enough wonderful gravy to use on the mashed potatoes I made!

I made this recipe exactly as-is and it was AMAZING. The pork chops were so tender that the knives we thought we'd need went unused. My husband, who made uncertain faces at first and said he didn't think he liked sauces that involved wine, raved about it as soon as he dipped a finger in the finished product for a taste. Made my own garlic mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli to go with it... both of which also tasted great when they got into the sauce!

The pork chops were very flavorful.  I added pepper to the seasoning, and not only sprinkled it on the chops, but also seasoned the egg wash.  I didn't make the gravy and served with sweet potatoes.  This is a keeper.

Excellent!  Very easy and makes the most tender pork chops.  Like several others, I also cut down the 1 hours cook time without the cream of mushroom mix to 35 minutes.

My husband loves these pork chops with mushroom sauce.  I always top them off with fresh mushrooms during the last 1/2 hour of baking.  When they're done I add some fresh parsley and diced green onions.  Delish!

If you don't like much pork flavor, this is a good recipe, you can't taste much the pork with all the sauce. I substituted the cream of mushroom soup for homemade( 'cause I was to lazy to go to the store and get one) and turned out great, I think it was better. About the cooking time, I think 1 hour total is just fine.

Hubby's favorite meat is pork chops. He loved this recipe. I had to use Cream of Chicken - had no C of Mushroom. It was still good. I did shorten the cooking time to one hour total because of previous review and it was just right. Thank you for the reciipe.

Wonderful, used Panko bread crumbs, because that's what I had on hand.  Added some water from the boiled potatoes to make more gravy.  Delicious!  Will make again!

Very tender but a bit salty and wasn't a fan of the mushroom gravy.

Good stuff! I used a larger amount of pork chops (what I had), but will double the gravy amount, no matter how much pork I use next time. The gravy is awesome!

Not so delicious as perceived to be. Needed a lot of time to prepare and turned out just tasteless. Not to mention that I tried to do this twice so far while getting the same result every time.

YUM-O! This was the best Pork Chop I ever had! Will make again and again. Although next time I will be sure to get extra thick pork chops next time. It was so tender I didn't even need a knife. I added a splash of white wine! Great recipe!

Excellent pork chops.  Very tender and definitely worth the time.  I followed the recipe but added a can of cream of potato soup along with the cream of mushroom, and used white wine which I increased to 1/2 cup.  Delicious and definitely a keeper!

Very Good Pork Chops. I followed the instuctions with no modifications. The sauce was very good. My husband even liked it and he hates anything with cream of mushroom soup. Its a keeper and we will enjoy this again in the dinner rotation.

My husband liked these, but did not rave about them like he usually does when I make somehing new that he loves.  It was very easy to make.  The cooking times in the recipe seemed to be way too much. Had I cooked them that long they would have been way overcooked.

My family really enjoyed this.  I too wish the bread crumbs were a little crunchier, but the lack of crunch didn't take anything away from the overall taste of the dish.  I used Progresso Cream of Mushroom which is a little heartier than Campbell's.  I will definitely add this to the rotation of dinner meals!

HELP!! I made this dish yesterday and followed the recipe to a T...except that I took other reviewer's advice and doubled the gravy. I used 8 slices of pork and Chardonnay for the white wine. Since I doubled the gravy mixture, I used 2 cups of wine, 4 cans of condensed cream of mushroom and 2 cups of milk. The dish turned out very bitter! It wasn't bitter at a before I added the gravy mixture and baking it for an additional 30 mins. Did I do something wrong? Did I put too much wine? Pls let me know how I can salvage this dish (perhaps by simmering it?). I made my hubby wait til 10pm for his dinner, assured by my promise that he is about to have the most awesome pork chops ever. needless to say, it didn't quite turn out that way. Help!

Some of the best pork chops I have ever made!  Didn't change anything except I only made 2 large chops with the same amount of sauce (for my mashed potatoes).  Definitely do it again!

I thought this recipe was very good. I used 6 thick boneless pork chops. Made recipe as followed except added more garlic powder and 2/3 c white wine. I cooked in oven for 30 min. Put the sauce on and cooked another 15 min. They were done perfectly and still juicy (I don't like dried out pork chops). I didn't give this a 5 star because I thought the crust would stay a little crunchy, they did not. The flavor was delicious though.

these are great if you want crispy outer then just thicken gravy in a pan and pour on top when serving.

This was a great recipe! I used the dark cream of mushroom soup and added extra flavor and it was awsome! My husband said it was the best pork chops ever!

These were great!  Very rich and satisfying.  I decided to switch amounts and go with 1/2 cup wine and 1/3 cup milk instead, and it gave it a great depth of flavor, I think.  The only trouble I had was that the oil ended up being a bit too hot on medium-high heat, and I burned one side of the chops.  I turned down to medium, and the second side came out just fine.  Next time, I would keep the heat down to medium for the frying.  Other than that, fantastic recipe!

Like most people I didn't follow this exactly. My porkchops were in a bag thawing and seemed wet enough, so I seasoned them and poured in a ton of seasoned breadcrumbs; no flour or eggs. Then I fried on the stovetop and made the gravy separate. The pork chops were plenty cooked, so I didn't bother baking them. The porkchops themselves were five stars. They were delicious and so easy this way! I wasn't very pleased with the gravy, so I'll do something different next time (reason why only 4 stars). I'm making the porkchops again today! Yummy.

I've been wanting to rate these for a year or so, just hadn't gotten around to it. I make these about once a month and they are ALWAYS a hit! The kids love them :) I personally love cream of mushroom soup and cooking with wine so this was a winner from the get-go. Thank you for sharing!

This really was good.  I used boneless, center cup chops and they were SO moist and tender.  These chops, mashed potatoes and fresh green beans made for a fantastic dinner.  Be sure to REALLY season the chops before you dredge/dip them or they'll be bland.  I seasoned the flour as well.  The 'gravy' going in was bland, but after it cooked with the juice from the chops in the oven, it was great.  When I put them in the oven, I also added a whole sliced onion...YUM!  I tried this again, but with chicken (and added onions and sliced mushrooms) and had the same great success.

WOW! This had to be the best chop ive ever had!!! I never have wanted to write a reveiw even though I live on this site..... But this I couldnt let slide by this time! Ok first up although chops make cook in 35 mins the point of cooking and hour and half, is that is IS SO TENDER...... the only thing I changed was the breading, I only had 3/4 cup of plain crums, but I had a can of frenches fried onins. so I mixed it coated it, and YUM!!!!!

This was a hit in our house! I did as others suggested and added golden mushroom soup as well as the cream of mushroom soup. I added a few more spices to make sure it wasn't bland, and sautee'd red onion and mushrooms, poured on top of the chops before adding the gravy.  I think the secret is to use a very dry white wine.... otherwise a sweet wine could overpower the dish.  Only gave it 4 stars cuz I changed it up a bit due to other reviews.... but it was a really great base to start with!  Thx for sharing! :)

Awsome Recipe. The whole family loved it! The pork chops were tender and juicey. I used the excess sauce as gravy for the mash potatoes, I served it with. Excellent!

I thought this turned out great. It wasnt labor intensive but did use a lot of dishes. I used panko breadcrumbs and they are, as always, fabulous! I do agree that the sauce could use a little something else to make it less "cream of mushroom-y", i added a bit of chili powder and garlic powder to mine but might experiment some. overall, it was a wonderful dish, not at all as tough and chewy as pork chops were when my mom used to make them---will make again and again!

Excellent - with a few adjustments... I added minced onion, parsley granulated garlic and pepper to the breadcrumbs. I also added rosemary and garlic to the soup/milk mixture.  My husband said it was the best pork chop he's ever had and I agree.  It was so moist and full of flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written.  I didn't care for it but my family liked it "ok".  I think we would have liked it better if I had eliminated the wine and added extra seasoning.  However, I doubt I will attempt this recipe again.  I've had tastier chops with a lot less cook time.

My whole family absolutely loved this! I cooked for only an hour, adding the sauce at the 40 minutes mark. I also sauteed 1/4 of a white onion in the frying pan with the pork drippings and added dollop of sour cream to the sauce. I omitted the white wine and doubled the milk. It was yummy!

These were a hit with everyone!  Very easy to make too.  I used 2 cans of soup, 1 cream of mushroom & 1 golden mushroom.  Gravy was delish on mashed potatoes.  I didn't have white wine so I used some cooking sherry.  I will try white wine next time.

I changed it a bit per needing too.  Didn't not bread or fry, just seasoned the chop and put in the pan to bake for 30 mins.  I didn't have cream of mush, so I made homemade cream of chicken.  I  added cayenne to the sauce, sauteed onions and mushrooms and added to sauce, poured over chops and cooked 30 more mins.  The sauce was AMAZING!  The chops could have cooked longer to become more tender, but that was my fault.  I served it over pasta and just loved it, I WILL make this again!

I made these like chicken parmesan with chunky tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese on top. The chops were SO incredibly tender and juicy, I was amazed. My son loved these and has asked for the recipe several times. Definitely a keeper!!

My family loved this but I didn't follow the recipe with the gravy. I also cut the cook time because I used boneless. I made the gravy in the pan I fried the pork chops in. Saute onions an mushrooms and used golden mushroom soup, marsala wine and a little chicken broth. Seasoned to taste and let simmer until it was time to add to the pork. Next time will double the sauce.

I try not to change the recipes much the first time I try them so I can rate the original. This one, I will definately try again but use some of the suggestions from others. It was still good, just not great. As one other person wrote it had that "some kind of meat covered with cream of mushroom soup" taste.

OMG, this is absolutely delish! I did everything the same, except I only had almond milk on hand, so that's the type of milk I used. The sauce/gravy was the best part...definitely will double that next time. Chops were tasty and tender... Will be making this again. Thanks for sharing!
****Revised review*** I just made this again and used non-fat milk and all of the same ingredients.....yummy. Not too much work and delish!***

This was okay.  Overall, it was nothing special.  Just basic pork chops in sauce.  It wasn't especially flavorful and took too long and dirtied too many dishes to be worth it.  We ate it all (I made two chops and halved the rest of the recipe) but I probably won't make it again.

This is the best recipe for pork chops I've ever made! My kids loved it too! I also substituted the wine with milk (doubling the milk) which made great gravy for the mashed potatoes I had with it. Delicious!

I am not much of a pork eater; but these were good, and my family loved these.  What a new welcoming change from the way in which I would normally cook pork chops which was fried or bake(but not this way).  I seasoned EVERY layer; the pork chops,  the flour, and add more seasonings to the bread crumbles.  The pork chops came out moist and full of favor. I will definitely do this again.

I didn't like the sauce, before I doctored it. I added garlic powder, whipping cream (& extra milk & wine), salt, pepper, basil, & parsley to taste. It was great once adjusted. The chops needed less time than called for.

I'm not sure if my review is deserved or not because of all the changes I made, but what I made was delicious!  I usually don't make any major changes to a recipe before trying the original, but I thought the ones I made were necessary. First, I used half bread crumbs and half potato flakes because I think it makes the breading more flavorful. I also cooked the gravy separate so the pork would not get soggy. Lastly, I do not allow wine in my house so I substituted the wine with a half can of cream of chicken soup and 1 tbs of rice wine vinegar.

I had high hopes for this dish, but was very disappointed with the results. To us, it was bland and the combination of wine, milk, and the soup as a "gravy" is what destroyed the pork chops. We salvaged it by covering with sauteed zucchini, squash, mushrooms, and onions, which improved the taste greatly.

These were tasty, but the cooking time was way too long. They were all dried out by the time we ate them. I'm going to cut back the cooking time next time we try them.

I deglazed the skillet that I browned the chops in with a little white wine and sauteed some baby bella mushrooms in that. Then I made the sauce in the same skillet and added it to the cooked chops upon serving because we don't like soggy chops.

Very nice recipe!  I've made this several times now and have modified it a bit.  To save time, I don't bake it as long and I also add fresh garlic, chilies and mushrooms to the gravy mixture.  I also just use flour instead of the bread crumbs and it turns out great.   Delicious!

I love this recipe. When I am pressed for time and really don't feel like cooking, I make this! It's simple and tasty. Throw it in the oven and relax while it's cooking. The chops come out so tender and the soup makes a great sauce.

I was a little worried because once I started making these I realized I didn't have cr. of mush. soup. I used a jar of Heinz Pork Gravy instead and mixed that with the milk and they still came out delicious. I did have to thicken up the gravy after the baking time, so I'd recommend less milk or just be ready to use some flour. I did omit the wine as well.   Our 2 yr. old ate half a pork chop herself!! Considering how fussy she is, that's saying something! A++++ recipe!

I could only eat a couple of bites before I stopped. It was wayyyy to salty for my taste and the salt was overpowering. My husband thought they were ok but not great. I don't think I will make these again even if I omit the seasoning salt.

made this for dinner on a sunday night.  oh my god! my sister was visiting from N.C and i made the chops.  they were absolutely delish!  my sister took the first bite and started making yummy noises:)  my boyfriend also loved it.  this is definitely a keeper.   the only thing, you don't have to bake them for an hour. do 45min. then pour sauce over and bake another 25-30. not dry and perfectly cooked!!

This is a great recipe if you have a husband that refuses to eat meat off the bone like mine! Finally, a good pork recipe that is not BBQ. Makes for a more formal dinner. Enjoyed it with a little wine. The sauce is amazing!

This was delicious! I just baked it for 40 minutes too, and I put the sauce on after in finished cooking and popped it in the oven while I set the table. I didn't have any regular milk (just soy and chocolate) so I just omitted it, and it tasted fine :)

This was OK. I shortened the oven cook time by 30 minutes and even added additional garlic powder to the sauce for more flavor. Still not enough flavor for me.

I wanted to make a good pork chop recipe.  This got such good reviews I thought I'd try.  The only think I did differently as per many suggested was that I also used golden mushroom soup with the can of regular mushroom soup.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but shortened the baking time by about 1/2 hour which was a good idea or they would have been overcooked.  My family didn't like them at all.  Not great pork lovers, but I, who enjoys a pork chop now and then, did NOT like this recipe either.  WAAAY to rich.  I wonder if cutting back on the soup (I used two as suggested) might would have helped)..and the breading, rich, just too much going on.    The chops were nice and tender, but eh, overall overwhelming. Guess who ate pork chops all week for lunch?  That wold be me...with a lot of the sauce and breading removed.  I won't make this again.  I gave it three stars because it wasn't HIDEOUS and the chops were tender and if you like this kind of thing, then go for it.

I made this last night for my husband and our 4 year old who hates everything other than cheese burgers... They LOVED it, the little one asked for seconds and then thirds.... amazing.  I did change a few things though, i sauteed a small chopped onion as well as a clove of garlic minced in the pan that i browned the pork in and mixed up the sauce in there and had it heated and seasoned it with some Italian spices and i didn't have any wine on hand so i threw in a shot of whiskey lol... it gave it a bit more texture.  This is a awesome recipe thank you so much you are a life saver, there's only so much you can do with pork chops and to find something new that even kids will eat is a real treat

it was okay, but nothing to write home about.  The pork chops were very tender, yes, but they just tasted kind of "blah", so it's a good thing there was the gravy to cover it up with, or it would have been "blah" by itself.  I liked the pan-frying first, that seemed to hold the breading on more than I've had in the past, I must say!    I had four pork chops for this recipe, cooked scalloped potatoes along with it, with corn and rolls; looked great, excellent presentation, but the flavor of the meat was just not there!  Maybe more spices are needed?

I made this last week but forgot to review it. It wasn't my favorite, but it gets 4 stars because my husband thought it was really good. I used regular breadcrumbs and seasoned them myself because thats what I had on hand. I also added pepper to the sauce. It took a long time to make, but I liked the wine flavor in the sauce. I may make this again in the future, but I might tweak it some to our liking. I am always looking for ways to make pork chops tender and juicy, so thanks.

I don't like pork chops, nor does my stepson, but my husband really does.  He is a picky eater, but he liked this alot.  We would make it again (for him) but I would omit the white wine - I did not care for that taste. I also have heard that cooking pork chops in the crockpot makes the meat a lot more tender (just falls apart).  I think I would like that more.  But, for what it's worth, this was really great if you like pork chops done this way and the white wine taste.

Enjoyed by all..   used 8 chops so I doubled the sauce.  I added a packet of mushroom gravy mix for a little more flavor.  Served with mashed potatoes and it was yummy.

Amazing!  I hate pork chops, but these were fantastic! I couldn't stop saying how yummy they were. I made no changes to the recipe except to fry them for more like 2-3 minutes instead of 5.

The chops came out really tender, but the breading slid off in the oven, mixed in the gravy and was not very appetizing.  Next time I'll skip the breading.

its a nice recipe. Since i am not a big mushroom fan i used cream of chicken and some mushrooms instead of condensed cream of mushroom as mentioned in the original recipe. And it turned out yummy  ...  will be cooking this often.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great, the only change I made was using chicken broth instead of the wine since I didn't have any on hand and I added some sauted mushrooms and onions in the sauce/gravy.  My husband is not a pork chop fan but has seconds of this.  Good comfort food served with mashed potatoes and corn, delicious.

This made a hit! The best way to cook porkchops, for they were actually tender - hooray! As another reviewer suggested, I opted out of the mushroom soup and cooked a brown gravy mix instead. Will definately make again...

These chops were EXCELLENT!  My family and I don't eat pork so of course we substituted with turkey chops instead.  I didn't have any italian-style bread crumbs so I used what i did have...Peperidge Farm herb seasoned stuffing.  It was a wonderful sub.  Just as other reviewers, I only baked the chops for approx. 35 min.  This was plenty of time.  I sauteed mushrooms and shalots on the stove top to add extra umph to the gravy.  Thanks for this recipe.  Caution:  Very rich.  Lessen the milk if your looking for a not so heavy meal.

This is a winner!  I had 8-1 inch thick boneless loin chops.  After browning them nicely I baked them for 45 min and they were done perfectly.  I put 4 in a glass dish and 4 in a metal pan to bake and the ones in the glass dish were better.   I heated the gravy on the stove because I didn't want it in the pans with the chops.  I used 1 can of Cream of Mushroom and 1 can of Golden Mushroom with the wine and it turned out deliciously.  It made a lot more than we need but we'll find something to use it on I'm sure.

This was absolutely delicious!  My husband loves pork chops, but not my son, so I used thick boneless chicken breasts instead -- they turned out so moist and tender.  I did cut the baking time down from an hour to 45 mins, at 325 instead of 350.  I upped it back to 350 for the 30 minutes the sauce cooked, though.  I also doubled the amount of sauce, since my guys go way overboard with the gravy!  The only other thing that I did different was that, while the chicken was baking for the 45 mins, I slow-fried (in butter) an 8 oz. package of portobello mushrooms until they were nice and brown, then added the two cans of soup, the milk and wine to the pan with the mushrooms.  The fried mushrooms gave the sauce a nicer brown color, and brought out the flavor of the cream of mushroom soup.  I used 6 very large chicken breasts, and this was so good that it did not last through two meals!!!

I didn't have a lot of time tonight, so instead of baking it in the oven, I used a pressure cooker. Everything was fabulous! I added a little more wine and put some salt in and the end result was great.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner. Took the suggestions of others and sauted mushrooms and doubled to sauce. My husband who said he was not hungry due to a large lunch, ate seconds and said it was great.

Fantastic!!!  This is a keeper.  My only add-in was a package of onion soup mix with the condensed mushroom soup.  I also increased the milk to about 3/4 cup.  Will definitely make again.

Really good, and very easy!!  I spiced up the  gravy a bit with pepper, and used two cans of low  fat soup.  Also brinned the chops for a couple of hours.  Came out nice and tender.  Thanks!

It was a great recipe and the boys loved it only we ended up having to remake the sauce because the wine made it too bitter. When we skipped the wine, it turned out fantastic!

Excellent Excellent pork chops... SO TENDER!!! You barely need a knife to cut them. The first time around, I substituted the milk for sour cream. The second time, I added a full tablespoon of brown gravy mix to the flour for additional flavour, and for the sauce, I once again substituted the milk for sour cream and ricotta as I was short on sour cream. Wow, what a treat. I'm only ever making them this way now. Thank you.

I have been meaning to post a review for a while. This was by far the best pork chop I have ever had!!! I followed other reviews by mixing in the golden mushroom and the cream of mushroom soup and it came out fantastic. I also topped mine with mushroom, onions, bell pepper, red pepper, and fresh parsley!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

Good recipe. Good, if not a bit salty as is. I would cut down the salt seasoning down if I made this again. Would also probably just cook the pork and pour the sauce on afterward to prevent the breading from becoming soggy. Will make again.

This was very good!  Very easy to make.  I used cr of chicken soup and added some sauteed onions.  Very tender, even the hubby commented on that!   It reminded me of city chickens.  The sauce was great!  I wish I had made rice or mashed potatoes with it.  I will make it again.

These were soooo good and moist!  You could cut the pork chops with a fork.  My husband made them and the only change he made was that he baked the pork chops alone first for 20 min and then for 15 min with the gravy.  We will be having these again and again.

Oh my goodness! So good! I just finished the leftovers for lunch and they were heavenly! I absolutely reccomend serving with mashed potatos and doubling the sauce! So heavenly and comforting. I added a little more wine and a little less milk like a few other reviewers suggested. My husband said, "this tastes like fancy restaraunt food"! Loved it!

"This is awesome!" according to my husband.  We only adjust the cooking time.  We baked for 25 minutes, then 15 minutes longer with the sauce.  This is a favorite!

I typically don't enjoy pork chops but make them for the rest of my family anyway.  This recipe was WONDERFUL!!! Had I not cooked it myself, I wouldn't have known it was a PC at all.  The family LOVED them and we will for sure be serving them the next time we have quests.

I made this for my family on a Monday evening. Oh my goodness. It was delicious! My children usually like ketchup with their meats, but not this 1. My husband and I both want this like once or twice a month! It was great!

This was so good! I couldn't believe how tender the pork chops were. They made excellent leftovers. This will definitely be apart of my cooking repertoire!

This was really good. The family loved it. However, next time (yes, there will be a next time :) I will try to "water-down" the sauce a bit. OR find a white/herb sauce that is NOT made with canned soup. It was a bit thick. But other than that the technique for cooking it was great soooo soft! thanks for sharing!

These chops turned out so tender and were very good.  We normaly do not cook with wine so we added about 3/4 cup sour cream with the soup.  We also sauted some onions and a can of mushrooms and then added this to the soup mixture.  Will make these again and again.

My whole family loved this!  I had to crank up the oven to 400 to try and get it done by dinnertime but still turned out great.  The ONLY thing I would have done different would be to double the sauce so we could have had more on mashed potatoes!  This will be my standard pork chop recipe from here on.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was great - tender and tasty!  Used one can of cream of chicken with herbs and one can of beef gravy for the soups.  Heated the gravy n the microwave before pouring over the chops and cooked the chops about 30 minutes in the oven first.  Thanks for sharing!

Even my daughter who hates pork chops ate it all. I doubled the sauce as other people recommended and it was almost all used as gravy on mashed potatoes. Yum.

I made this using an extra can of golden mushroom soup along with the cream of mushroom. I also sauted mushrooms and some green onion together and added it to the soup, wine, and milk mixture. I made the sauce on the stove top and served it on the side. I will make this again with the alterations.

I rated this a 5 star for the taste alone.  As someone else mentioned, it DOES make a lot of dirty dishes and take some time to prepare; but, if you as me, it was really worth it.  Everyone in my family loved it, even my kids.  My picky 9 yr old son even ate seconds of it.  I didn't change the recipe at all, but I DID change the cook times.  I set the oven to 425 and cooked for 40 minutes...then after adding the sauce I only cooked for 15 more minutes.  I did this because the chops were pretty much cooked when we fried them up for 5 mins on each side (which 5 mins isn't entirely necessary either)  I cooked broccoli and fried okra with this meal as well, which turned out to mix well with the chops.   The chops came out very tender and we could almost cut with a fork.  Served leftovers as sandwiches and those were good too.

I made this recipe twice already.  The first time I had thin in-bone chops and was looking for a recipe because my chops always turn out too dry.  For this recipe I would not the thin chops again.  I bought some very thik boneless chops the second time and added a little Cayenne Pepper to the Italian bread crumbs.  It's only my husband and me so I only cooked 2 chops (cut as much fat off as possible) and only used 1/2 can of soup and used Sherry instead of wine - but I still used 1/3 cup of the Sherry.  I also cooked for 20 minutes and then added the soup mix and cooked for 15 minutes longer ...this proved to be too long.  Next time I will cut the oven time to only 30 minutes total - heating the soup mix first and adding it half way thru - the chops should be about 160/170 degrees when done otherwise they get too dry (pork should be a little pink.)  The Sherry is what makes this recipe even more YUM!!!!!!!!  THIS ONE IS A KEEPER!!!!!

This was so delicious and tender. I actually didn’t have canned cream of mushroom so I made my own with some pork gravy seasoning thickened with flour, sautéed onions and baby bellas and left out the wine. I added heavy cream about 5 minutes before covering the pork with it. I also was short on time so after I sautéed the pork on both sides, I covered with foil and oven baked for 30 minutes, added the gravy mix and then covered and backed for another 20. They came out moist, tender and absolutely fabulous.

Made the recipe as is and the family and I all loved it. The pork chops come out very tender.  I used large ziplock baggies to coat the pork chops with flour and the bread crumbs.....easy and less mess.  Simple and tasty!

I only rated this 4 out of 5 stars because I did make a few adjustments.  I made this for dinner last night and it was SO GOOD!  My husband was a little unsure about the gravy at first, but was pleased in the end.  I used huge butterflied boneless pork chops that were still an inch thick.  To the flour, I added garlic and onion powder.  I didn't have enough italian bread crumbs, so I added a can of fried potato sticks crushed up.  I fried the outside until nice and golden brown and super crispy, then baked in covered 9x13 for 45 minutes.  For the gravy, I didn't have any cream of mushroom, so I used cream of chicken, milk, chardonnay, and more garlic powder.  Baked for another 25 minutes.  It was fabulous.  Some of the most tender and flavorful pork chops we've ever had.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans cooked in beef bouillon, garlic, worcestershire, and salt.  Delish! Thanks for the recipe.

I usually avoid any recipe that calls for canned cream of mushroom soup, but I just had to try this because most of the reviews said that the meat  was so moist. This recipe did not disappoint! It's very easy to prepare and makes the house smell wonderful! I used thick pork loin chops and cooked for about 45 minutes, then covered with the mushroom sauce, then baked for another 15 minutes for a total baking time of 60 minutes. The pork was very moist and flavorful! The only thing different that I did was to add garlic salt,  onion salt and fresh ground black pepper to the breadcrumbs before dredging the chops in them. Great recipe for moist pork chops!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I used the low fat muchroom soup to but a few calories and fat.  So very tasty.  I am going to serve this to my college age kids when they come home.  Great taste.  We also used Italian Panko bread crumbs.

The best!!! Tender and juicy. I gave up on pork chops a long time ago. Thought I would give it one more chance. I changed the time to 30/30 and used golden mushroom. Threw in some mushrooms and green onion and more wine This is a winner.

This is a great recipe with delicious results. I made a few changes. The sauce I prepared on the stove top and added onions and mushrooms I had sauted in a little white wine. I cut the cooking time to 20 minutes in oven, covered, then add sauce and continue to cook another 20 minutes covered with foil. It was a hit! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Thes were very good!.  The only reason I rated these a 4 instead of a 5, is because I felt the gravy was a little runny.  Overall, the taste and moistness were outstanding!!!  Next time, I will double or triple the amount of soup (I did take the advice of other reviewers, and doubled the sauce), but leave the wine and milk the same.

We used 1" bonelss pork chops. They were initially wonderful! Forget about leftovers. They just weren't as good; soggy, mostly.

I made this a couple of nights ago for dinner; not bad. I enjoye the sauce on the mashed potatoes yet thought this might be better on chicken breast than pork...then again, I'm not a huge pork fan. Will make the sauce gain, thanks for the recipe.

This was so good!!!!   I made this lastnight and as I was browning the chops it immediately smelled wonderful.  I was a little concerned about the gravy part; I don't drink a lot of wine and used a cheap one I had bought for another recipe.  As soon as I poured it on the pork chops, the wine was ALL I could smell and I feared I had ruined the meat.  BUT, not so, it was delicious.  I only cooked it for 20 additional minutes instead of 30.  I just felt that they were plenty done.  The pork chops were so tender.  I did use boneless meat.  My kids are really picky and I split one of the chops between the two of them and they ate it all!  I will be making this for sure again.  Thanks so much!

Best pork chops I've ever eaten.  Very tender but not falling apart.  Used more than 2 eggs though.  The sauce was fantastic served with wide noodles.

The chops were just awesome! My family and I really enjoyed them. I did not have any cream of mushroom soup so I added cream of chicken instead. The taste was still stellar.

Excellent and relatively easy. I did these on top of the stove and cooked very slowly. I did add a clove of crushed garlic and used chicken broth instead of milk. Thanks for the post.

I was supposed to make this recipe, but didn't end up with time so my husband had to make these...Usually I do all the cooking.  He followed this recipe exactly to the letter, sent me a pix message to tell me they looked..."interesting" Then a message followed saying they were AWESOME!!  and that our 3 year old (picky, picky) LOVED them too!!  This recipe gets 5+ stars for that!!

This was absolutely fabulous...I pretty much followed the recipe except for doubling the sauce(we like lots!)--it was great there were no leftovers--for those who don't drink wine--the alcohol cooks off using just the flavor of the wine..you're really missing out if you don't use the wine..it's good w/o it but absolutely divine with the flavor of it!

These were great. My husband always talked about the p.c. his mom made and described something similar, I found this recipe and gave it go.  After the first bite he said it sent him back, but that it was way better than his moms. (but not to tell her!  ;-)

Deliscious. I was worried that after pan frying, baking for 90 minutes would dry it out, but I let it bake the entire time and it was tender and juicy (you could cut it with a fork). I added some fresh mushrooms and dijon mustard to the sauce for some tang. It was great.

Yum! These were really good and REALLY easy! We served them with mashed potatos and steamed spinach. I would give this 5 stars but I was not loving the gravy. It was missing something- we did add 2 cups chopped mushrooms and a whole sauteed onion, however it was still pretty sweet. I think next time I will omit the white wine and add some broth. We will definitely eat them again.

We enjoyed this recipe,  I followed the recipe except I made the sauce on the side and drizzled it over the pork chops right before serving. My son loved the pork chop it was so tender and asked if we could have these instead of chicken all the time.

I tried this recipe last week along with homemade scalloped potatoes. The chops were tender and delicious. And, by using canned mushroom soup, 1 percent milk and a little wine for the gravy, I managed to keep the calories down some. I will make this recipe again and again.

This is surprisingly delicious for being so easy to make.  I used a combination of Cream of Mushroom and Golden Mushroom soups and added sauteed sliced mushrooms as others suggested.  Chops were perfectly tender and tasty.  This is my new favorite baked pork chop recipe!

I enjoyed eating this creation.  My pork chops were already marinated, so I didn't follow this recipe to marinate it, but I did coat with bread crumbs.  The sauce was really good!

I've never had pork chops that are so tender! You don't even need a knife to cut these. The mushroom soup gravy is delicious - it would be really good paired with some mashed potatoes.

These were the best~ I think I would increase the wine and decrease the milk a little next time and add fresh mushrooms in the last 1/2 hr. But they were perfect just the way the recipe was written.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I didn't have breadcrumbs on hand so I used Kellogg's Corn Flake Crumbs.  For those who complained that it was too salty, you can use Low Sodium soup.  I always do.

Porkchops were a big hit in my family.  My kids even asked for seconds and thirds.  Kids ate the porkchops without sauce.  My husband and I loved it all.

This was some pretty good stuff. I am not a big fan of cream of whatever as I have gotten older. This was a simple quick meal. I followed everything to a T except I forgot to flour the chops and mine did not take the stated 1 and a half hours to cook. Total time took 30 to bake and 15 with the sauce/gravy. I ran out of time to cook so I pulled the pan out and set it on the burner (from my corn) for a few minutes and let the sauce get all bubbly. The taste was right on for an easy cook meal. Thank you.

As is I'd rate it a 1 star, bland and over cooked. Please note all of the 5 stars that modified the heck out of this recipe.  I'd don't consider this a recipe just a suggestion.  Use this as a jumping off point for your own creation and you will also be rating it a 5 star.  I used cream of chicken, poultry seasoning, paprika and shredded cheese. I did the sauce on the stove top and cooked the chops until 155 in the oven. But it is fast and all you really need are white wine, pork and a cream of something soup to make it work. So for me its a keeper with my modifications.

4.5 stars for texture and 2 stars for flavor.  I thought the sauce was quite boring and the flavor of the pork chops definitely needed something.  I will use this cooking method again (yet cut back on coooking time- 30 mins without sauce and 15 minutes with the sauce), but I will have to play with the seasoning for the chops (I'm thinking paprika, a little cayenne and black pepper) and try to come up with something different for the gravy.  As is, it's really just okay.

I really liked this.  Picky husband wasn't too keen on it, but like I said he's picky.  I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup, but will use the regular one next time, I think it will be even better. Thanks for recipe!

I am a horrible cook, and my husband agrees, lol! I decided to give these a try since they don't seem that hard. I left out the wine and doubled the milk and condensed soup. Unfortunately I used way to much season salt and it was basically like licking a salt block...eewww! I will try this recipe again, but next time I will leave out the season salt and try a different mixture. They smelled awfully good, and looked good too. Try, try again, right!

I just made this recipe tonight and it was awesome-very easy to make, the gravy was awesome over stuffing-I would recommend not using seasoning salt alot, because I'm not a fan of salt-try replacing with onion powder-the pork chops were so tender and juicy-will definately make it again-Thanks!

Very good pork chop recipe. In the past, my pork chops have always been dry and tasteless, but not anymore. These were moist, tender, and delicious. All my children (except my #1 most picky eater) loved them too.

This recipe is the bomb! The first time I prepared this I was pressed for time so I raised the heat to 425 degrees and baked the pork chops for 25 minutes, added the gravy mix and bake for another 20 minutes. It was delicous! The next night, due to requests  for more, I followed the baking heat and times exactly as directed in the recipe and it was absolutely to bomb! The pork chops were so tender, I ate it with a spoon!

I have made this twice for my family and they raved over this dish both times! I used 1/2 cup of white wine instead of 1/3 cup.  Other than that I kept everything the same.  Thanks for a great recipe!

DELICIOUS!!!! I made it overall like the recipe stated. The wine that I used was pinot grigio and I added a little extra because of reading other reviews.  I also added the milk, one can of cream of mushroom, paprika, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. I made the sauce mixture on the stove at low heat, so I could have sauce to pour on top at the end of baking. I only baked it for 35 minutes covered and then poured the mixture on top and recovered it for another 30 minutes. This is not a quick recipe so be prepared to be in the kitchen for a while.

This is by far the most delicious way to eat pork chops I've ever come across.  Easy to cook too.  I cut the baking time in half, since I had thinner cuts of meat, and substituted vermouth for the wine.  Delicious!!!!

My pork chops were just a little too greasy for my liking...but maybe that's what makes this recipe appealing for other cooks?  Regardless, it's a simple recipe and I would recommend trying it at least once!

OK, this is how pork chops are suppose to taste!! I had to try this recipe because of all the reviews. I was NOT disappointed. Outstanding! My very picky hubby loved them. The only thing that I did differently was the white wine. I used Merlot (it was all I had). The gravy was purple until I drizzled over the pork chops. Once it baked, it looked fine and tasted divine!!

I loved this dish and my husband said it was the best chops I've made him yet.  yes, sauce could use an a little extra zing but I followed as is and was happy enough. Love it when I can cut my chops with a fork....

5 Stars in the end but 4 as the recipe states.  I cooked the chops for 30/30.  I also think the recipe needs low-sodium soup.  For the gravy I used 1 cup milk and 1/8 cup white wine with 1 can soup. YUM! Will make again.

I was skeptical about another recipe using meat and cream of anything soup.  Boy was I wrong!  This recipe was WONDERFUL!  Follow the advice of other cooks and make extra gravy!  It is SO good!  The pork chops were fork tender and the gravy was delicious.  This one's a keeper in my house!

I made this as is (I may have adjusted the baking time a little-I tend to pay attention to the food and not the timer!) but it was outstanding.  I have passed this recipe on to as many people who will listen!  Thanks for sharing!

These were about as tender of pork chops as I have ever had. Really good comfort food. Add a little paprika and cayenne for a little bit more bite, but very good. Served with brown rice.

Had the chops tonight - GREAT RECEIPE. My chops were thick and large,so I made the sauce for the 6 chops.  Have a small amount left over.  Plan to add pork gravy and use it on a roast for gravy (this should make the gravy creamy). This receipe for the gravy is similar for the one I use on boneless chicken beast - only I usually add sour cream to the mushroom soup and put on raw chicken in baking dish, cover and bake for an hour.  My granddaughter loved this dish served with noodles.  Maggie

This recipe is a keeper. I made this today for the guys at work and they really liked it. I followed the recipe except for adding chicken and gold mushroom soup.I over seasoned my sauce just a tad with to much pepper but other than that it was great. The meat just fell of the bone it was so tender.

Husband liked it but wasn't the best. followed the directions to a t, but it just wasn't his favorite. Def make it with mashed potatoes and gravy. Might consider making this again.

UPDATE: March 2013: Did like other reviewers suggested and browned well. Then covered and cooked for 35 mins. I checked the internal temp and it was actually a little high so I didn't even need to cook it that long. Then let them sit and made the sauce in a pot on the stove. Took about 20 mins to cook down to right consistency. I suggest taking the chops out of the pan and keep warm on a plate because they will get soggy if left in the pan with the grease.

this recipe is really good and the sauce by far makes the recipe.  I doubled the sauce and used 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and one can of golden mushroom soup to give it extra flavor.  I also used mushrooms and green onions to give it more texture and color.  Since i doubled the soup mixture I was able to spoon about 1/4 of the mixture on the porkchops after letting them back for 35 minutes.  I then took the porkchops out after another 30 minutes and let people put extra sauce on them. delicious!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I followed advice of other users and added a can of golden mushroom soup mix, but I did not increase the milk or wine so it was a little thick. Next time I will definitely add more milk and wine because this is a sauce that we wanted more of!  Another change I will make next time is using boneless pork chops.  If I would have made these changes this time I would have given it 5 stars. My very-finicky teenage daughter loved it as was, and she declared that this would be one of the recipes she would want to add to our "Family Favorites Cookbook."  This is a VERY tasty recipe. A definite notch or two above your average smothered pork chops.  I think the wine gives it that little bit of extra zing that pushes it over the top.

Wow.... my entire family loved this recipe! My kids (ages 6 & 3) are picky eaters and they wanted to lick their plates clean. I followed the recipe as written, but agree with many of the reviews that said you should double the sauce. It's so yummy you'll want plenty. I cooked it for the full 1-1/2 hours and the chops were so juicy and the meat was so tender! I highly recommend this recipe!

I doubled the sauce and added mushrooms. The gravy was alright. Must've overcooked the meat because it was terrible- very tough and lacking in flavor. Will not make it again. I usually love pork chops... this one just didn't do it for us.

Very good!  Did not have any white wine on hand so I used a blush wine instead.  When preparing the sauce, I did as a previous reviewer mentioned and browned a chopped onion in oil.  I then poured the soup mixture into the skillet with the onions and simmered it for several minutes before putting it on the porkchops.  Delicious!!!

Very scrumptious and hearty. Husband loved it. I had ALMOST everything in the kitchen to make it(just missing white wine but a quick trip to the store resolved this) I did READ AHEAD and doubled up the sauce and VERY GLAD i did cause we were needing more for the potatoes i made for them. I cooked for 25/25 and it was very tender I cant imagine cooking for an HOUR and a HALF! Will cook again!!!!!

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! I added fresh sauted mushrooms to the sauce and it was the perfect addition! I saved some of the sauce and poured it over stuffing instead of using gravy...WOW! Overall excellent recipe!

Delicious! Super easy to make and quick to prepare. I cut the cooking time down since the pork chops I had were only about an inch thick.  I cooked them first for a half hour and then another half hour with the sauce. I also didn't fry them to cut down the fat and calories.  I will definitely make these again!

This is sooo good, but I changed the cook time a bit (seemed way too long).  I heated the sauce and added during the last 10 minutes of cooking for only 35 min total.  I also made the sauce using 1/2 crm chicken and 1/2 golden mushroom soup - didn't have any white wine, but I think the sauce would be so much better with it.  I sometimes make the pork chops using a different sauce too - this recipe is great for a base.

This was supposed to be the last time that I make pork chops because no one likes them.  Everyone liked these and I can't wait to buy more pork chops to make again!  Thanks for saving the pork chops on my family's menu!  The chops were "fall off the bone" tender and the sauce was just right.

I thought that I had everything on hand for this recipe but found out that I was missing mushrooms as well as mushroom soup---so I improvised. Instead of olive oil I fried the chops in bacon grease left from breakfast which browned them quite nicely. For the soup I used cream of celery and used white Zinfandel [Arbor Mist]. The chops were 'dissolve in your mouth tender' and the sauce was a delight to the taste buds.

These were awesome. My husband who hates pork chops loved them. I have made these with thin cut and with thick cut. The thick cut is the best. You will not be disappointed.

I make this regularly now! I always leave out the white wine because I never have it sitting around. But my boyfriend asks for this all the time. It's definately a keeper.

Oh My, these chops were fantastic! I did cut the cooking time down to 1 hour. The chops I used were very thick, so I cooked 30 min. on each side. I do think if I had cooked as directed, they would've been dried out. I added the soup mixture to the skillet where I had browned the chops, and cooked until heated. I topped chops with gravy just before serving. Next day, I scraped breading off left over chops, and made stroganoff. The flavor was incredible! Thanks for sharing.

I just made these for my husband and myself for lunch. They were GREAT!! Because there are only the two of us I only used 2 porkchops but the full can of mushroom soup as we like gravy on our baked potato. There was only about a 1/2 cup of gravy left but my husband requested I save it for our potatoes tonight. The only thing I did different was I did not have any chardoney on hand so used white merlot instead and I did not have any bread on hand so I crushed some crackers and added some Italian seasoning to them before I breaded the chops. This is deffinately a keeper!

These were SO good!  My mother-in-law was visiting and I made these for dinner.  She kept saying what good flavor they had.  I used panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs...it's what I had in the pantry.  My husband and his mother are not fans of gravy so I didn't cook them in the gravy...I just had it on the side.  We will definitely make these again!

This recipe was pretty good. No way is the cooking time right though! I cooked my chops for 30 minutes and even that was almost too long! Good flavor though! Good base recipe.
update: I made this again last night, fried my chops for about 10minutes and baked for 20. They were cooked perfectly. I think the problem with the cooking time may be due to varying thickness of chops. I love this recipe. I followed another reviewer this second time and used one can cream of mushroom and one can golden mushroom. I also sauteed some mushrooms and onions and added those to the chops with the sauce.

These were good, my pork chops where cut a lot thinner than the ones in the recipe I suppose, so they were done in 20 minutes and were very tender and tasty. I sauce tasted good, but was a little too runny for my liking. The next time I make this I will put a little thickener into the sauce. But overall, other than the fact that I over salted this is a great recipe to have on hand.

The pork chops were fairly tasty.  The s.o. thought they were good, not great.   Probably won't make again.  Takes too long to cook for a weeknight.  And it wasn't special enough if I'm going to spend the time on the weekend.

Easy to prepare taste decent and can use a bit more flavor. The one hour baking time render the meat a bit dry for my taste, therefore i would suggest 30 minutes of baking before adding the soup mixture and 30 minutes after that. Also doubling the cream of mushroom mixture is a really good idea if you have rice or mashed potato going with it. I like corn so I even added a can of corn in the soup mix... Well, it's up to you but generally this is an awesome recipe. Enjoy :-)

Awesome!!  I served them for Mother's Day ... everyone raved!!  Few minor changes ...didn't have garlic powder, so I added minced garlic to the oil when i browned the breading; baked at 350 for 20 minutes, covered, added sauce ... baked another 20 minutes.  Excellent!

Wonderful.  Followed other suggestions and cooked in the oven for 40 minutes after they fried in the pan for 10 minutes per side - make sure the pan is hot.  I doubled the sauced and put half of it on the chops after they were in the oven for 20 minutes. I used the other half for the mashed potatoes.  Daughters (4 and 1) and husband ate every bite.

Delicious....this one is a keeper. I replaced the wine with beer and doubled the gravy part of the recipe. I also added sliced onion and fresh mushrooms. We had company and I was told by them that these were the best pork chops they had ever had.

Using only 3 chops, I kept the full amount of gravy ingredients... glad I did. I served it with cooked thick pasta noodles and we used every bit of gravy. My changes were: Used cream of chicken soup, 1/3 cooking sherry, not white wine, and Montreal steak seasoning for the seasoning salt.  ALSO added the Montreal seasoning to the gravy as I whisked it, plus a little more black pepper. My chops were average, not thick, and 25/25 baking time worked for us.  My husband is demanding weekly servings of this one.  I threw out all my other pork chop recipes! Definitely DO the breading step, and no, it isn't "crunchy" but gives it lovely texture!

Really, really good. I couldn't believe how tender the chops were, they just fell apart when you touched them. I only used 3 chops, but kept the sauce amount the same as written. It was the perfect amount to serve over mashed potatoes. The only thing I did differently was to add a can of mushrooms to the sauce. This is definitely a tasty, comforting dish. Thank you! :)

I have to be honest, I don't like pork chops, but these were phenomenal!  I also sauteed fresh green beans in the drippings from frying the chops.  I splashed a little white wine into the pan and voila!  These pork chops were fork-tender and the sauce was delicious!

Terrific, easy pork chop dish. I've tried it with boneless and bone-in pork chops and it came out great both ways. The first time I made this I was worried about baking pork for that long, but it came out fork tender!

This recipe has become one of my favorite pork chop recipes EVER!  I tweak it here and there according to my hubby's Cajun tastes but this is so delicious I could eat it practically every day!

Excellent and easy.  Be careful not to burn chops when browning.  Makes a great sauce and will add a little more fluids next time.

I used 3 very thick pork chops, but kept the same amount of sauce after reading so many people talk about doubling the sauce. For the thick cuts, the cooking time was perfect. I did make sure the oil was very hot before I put the chopc in to fry, to make a nice coaing, little crispier, if thats possible in a sauce based chop. Would make these again, for variety, but believe we have recipes we like better.

This was good. The sauce is what makes it i used 1/2 a cup of chard to give it more of a wine taste. My husband said it tasted like resturaunt style chops. I would make it again.

Absolutely sensational.  I added 2 tablespoons of onion soup mix to the bread crumbs.  I had no cream of mushroom soup so I had to used cream of celery.  It worked out fine.  I used one can of cream of celery and then doubled the milk and wine measurements.  I had no pork chops just a tenderloin.  So I cut the tenderlion to resemble chops.  I didn't have to cook it as long since it was boneless.  So yummy.  I also added one 14 ounce can of mushrooms on top of the chops before I threw  on the soup/milk/wine mixture.  Covered and cooked for about 45 minutes. I made sure I sauteed the chops until crispy before putting in the oven.  I COVERED my chops.  I think that keeps it from drying out. Thanks.

Made this for Easter dinner and it was hit. I used very thick pork chops and forgot to buy wine so I used a little over a quarter cup of brandy with the mushroom soup added sauteed mushrooms, then two pears sliced and peeled that were not soft yet aroung the edges of the dish. I did not know if the pears would work with the mushroom sauce so I kept the added mushrooms more in the middle over meat and the pears around the edges of the dish and it worked perfectly.

Very Very good! I followed the recipe but added spices to my taste to the sauce as well as onions.  I cooked the chops on 365 for 20/20.  Thanks for the new recipe!

I made no changes to the recipe.  My family devoured the pork chops and gravy.  The pork chops were very tender and moist.

LOVED it!! We had 1/2 inch thick chops, so I took the advice of a review to bake them 20/20 mins and they were tender and juicy. I also added sauteed mushrooms on top. Someone else suggested the sauce wasn't enough, but it was perfect for us!

YES!!! Finally!!  I have been cooking forever but have NEVER been able to cook a good pork chop until now. These were outstanding, and besides doubling the "gravy" I didn't change a thing.  Yummmmmm.

This is the first time I really enjoyed pork chops!! I altered the recipe a little too. I also didnt cook as long maybe 20-30 min before I added soup mixture & another 20-30 after. I also fryed up extra mushrooms and onions and added it the soup mixture. YUMMY! I lightened my version as mush as possible too. Still great!

I modified the recipe to reduce the amount of salt that it has.  I used less cream of mushroom soup and added a little extra milk to still have plenty sauce.  I took the advice of another reviewer and sauteed some mushrooms and added them to the sauce.  It turned out very good.  Pork chops were fork tender.  I may switch to the golden mushroom soup next time I fix it.

I'm not a fan of pork chops but I made this for my family and was actually disappointed I didn't make more. The wonderful aroma fried chops filled the house and the white wine really gave it that special taste. I'm actually looking forward to making more pork chops. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Two words....DA BOMB!!!  I took the advise of other reviews and did make some minor changes.  I added onions and mushrooms to the gravy as well as chicken stock.  I also simmered the gravy while the chops cooked in the oven for the first hour.  Then I covered the chops with the gravy and baked as stated.  YUMMY!

This was such an easy recipe and very tasty! My 2 1/2 year old loved it! I used the thin sliced pork chops and reduced the bake time by 20min. They came out very moist and tender.

Loved this recipe.  Made it for dinner last night and it was a hugh hit.  I sauteed mushrooms and diced onions in the pan I used lightly searing the pork chops and added to the soup mixture.  Great taste will make again....

ok so the ONLY reason i rated this recipe a 4 is because i altered it just a tad. i am sure if i didn't it would have turned out just as good. i didn't feel like using cream of mushroom so i used cream of potato instead. i also wanted some veggies in it so i added a bag of vegetable medley. lastly i doubled the sauce so i had extra to pour over the stuffing i made with it.

It was perfect!  I made it just like it read and it was great.  The second time I made it, I omitted the white wine and it was still good, just not as good.

This was fairly bland for my tastes. My kids loved it, and the pork was moist, but just not much flavor to it. I think i'll skip this one next time.

AWESOME!  The pork chops were moist and juicy.  I tasted the mushroom sauce before adding it to the casserole dish and was SURE that I was not going to like it.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Also reduced cooking time.  After 1/2 hour added the sauce and cooked for an additional 1/2 hour.  This will be a regular for us!!!

This was tasty and simple to make. I did as another cook did - browned the chops 2 min each side, cooked by themselves for 15 minutes @ 350, then added the sauce, covered, and cooked for another 25 min. They were tender. The sauce can be a little bland, so I added some veggies and black pepper. Would also be good to perhaps add some chopped onion and/or garlic and fresh mushrooms.

I made this tonight and I took some other reviewers suggestions.  I switched the amount of wine in the recipe with the amount of milk (I used 1%). I browned the pork chops in bread crumbs, garlic and pepper for five minutes on each side. I then cooked the pork chops at 350 for 40 minutes.   After 40 minutes I added asparagus and the sauce mixture.  I then cooked it for 30 minutes. The pork came out perfect and was very moist.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  It is a very easy recipe and I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

I followed the recipe as written but with only 3 pork chops.  It was easy and excellent. The gravy was delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again.

I followed this recipe as written except I omitted the wine (I forgot to buy it while I was out).  The pork was moist and tasty, but the 1 1/2 hour baking time is too long.  The sauce was just starting to burn.  Next time I will reduce the the time in the oven.  Other than that, it is a nice recipe.

Easy enough, although I did add some fresh thyme and garlic to the sauce.  I found it a little bland, but ya' know what?  No one complained and the husband was happy :).  3 stars for me, but a peaceful dinner without complaints from the picky kids gives it a 4.  So in my book, success! 45 minutes total for chops and sauce was all it took for a juicy meal.

My husband proclaimed "These are the best pork chops I've ever had!" I agree! I browned them a little longer and initially baked them for only 40 minutes before adding cream of mushroom mix.  The chops were very moist and the sauce was wonderful.

These are the best Pork Chops that I've had in a very long time. I made a few changes to the recipe, though, as I went. I added just a little bit of chicken broth to the soup mixture, squeezed one lemon and added the juice to it and seasoned it to taste (The way that I usually enjoy seasoning my meats). I also sauteed mushrooms and onions and added them to the soup mixture just before pouring it over the Pork Chops.  I also reversed the amount of milk and wine... Using 1/3 cup of milk and 1/2 of wine, which definitely had a large impact on the flavor. The wine in this recipe is one of the most important ingredients, giving the chops the flavor that makes this recipe so fantastic. I used a cheap chardonnay (About $4 or so for the bottle) and it was perfectly fine for this, no sense in spending more than you have to.   I'll definitely be making this recipe again... It was so delicious, the chops so tender.

Awesome recipe! Unfortunately I burned the outside coating when I was frying the pork chops. I'll have to ease up on the heat! I scraped off the burnt parts (I know, the bread crumb coating) but it turned out ok. I will definitely make this given the lessons I learned.

Made this as follows, except cut back on the cooking time to 30 minutes in the oven, otherwise, the chops would have dried out.  Either way, I will stick to something else, as this did not work for me.

Naughty chops, like you might get once a year at a special restaurant.  I used bone in rib loin chops, that were about 3/4 in. thick.  These are the first chops in years that were actually moist.  Fell of the bone!  Baked for 45 min, then added sauce as directed, and baked another 30.

I tried this recipe tonight.  I would have gave it 3 stars because I thought it was just okay, but my mother thought they were very good, so I gave it 4 stars.  Might make this again.

Some time has passed since I made these chops, wish I would have rated it on the paper I printed this recipe on to remind me.  AGAIN, like many others said, totally boring, no flavor.  Better off having pan fried chops.  Had 3/4 inch chops, still dry after one hour in the oven. Deleting this recipe.

This is my husband's favorite!  Before this recipe he always claimed he didn't like pork chops.  I agree with other reviewers on a couple things.  Be sure to brown the pork chops well in the pan before baking.  Definitely double the sauce.  Yum.

Cooking time is a little long. You start salivating once the smell wafts. But it was worth it. I ended up forgetting to put white wine, but it still turned out good! Will definitely make agian.

I'm not a big fan of cream of mushroom soup, but was looking for an easy pork chop recipe and based on the huge number of reviews tried to give this one a try.  Wow!  It was way better than I expected it to be!  The pork chops were as tender as pulled pork, and the sauce was very appetizing.  I took some other reviewers' suggestions: used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, added a can of golden mushroom soup, used about double the wine and about 1/3 cup of milk, and sauteed some onions and sliced mushrooms in the pork chop pan while the chops were baking and added those to the sauce.  I baked everything for about 45/45.  I think there's a lot of flexibility in how long you need to cook it for, so you could go shorter if you need to, or longer wouldn't hurt it.  Served this over rice with lots of gravy on the rice and a veggie on the side.  I will definitely add this as a regular meal.

This was delicious, I made it for my husband, who usually says everything I make is "ok," and he said it was really good!  My one little issue was that I thought the gravy wasn't flavorful enough. I did use one can of cream of mushroom and one can of golden mushroom as others had suggested, but I did feel like it could have used some seasoning as well.  I'll do that next time!

Oh my gosh! I can't believe I've been eating pork chops the same way since I was small. Today I decided to try this recipe and it turned out to be GREAT!!!! Amazing taste and so tender. I love it!!! Since I don't like Mushrooms I decided to use Cream Of Chicken instead and it was so delicious!

Absolutely delicious!  The only thing i did was to add a package of lipton onion soup mix to it. My family loves onions and it did not call for any. It gave it some really great flavor for the gravy which i did double the recipe for.  So that we could use it also on the mash potatoes which tasted great with the gravy. Would make this again! Very easy and great for having company!

three adults and 2 kids loved this recipe!  used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk and a little extra wine, also shortened cooking times to 45 min w/o sauce and 20 with...next time may try reduced sodium mush soup.  not only will i make this again but my guests will too. never had such juicy pork in my life, and the gravy was great on the mashed potatoes we have with it.  may try what another user reccomended, bed of rice for pork when adding sauce.

My 8+ year old loved this as well as my husband.  I did add extra garlic and seasoning salt to the pork steaks.  Then dredged them in flour before the egg bath and the breadcrumb mixture.  This really helped to make the chops extra crispy.  I sauteed them longer than the recipe called for and then baked in the oven approximately 30 minutes.  I then deglazed the pan with sliced white onions, sliced mushrooms and white wine.  I then added the milk and cream of mushroom soup. This was a great recipe for a tender pork meal.

Fantastic! I might have overcooked the pork slightly but it still tasted amazing! Used FF half and half and added a little crushed garlic and cayenne for some kick.

I have made this recipe many times since trying it the first time.  The chops come out so tender, melt in your mouth good.  Excellent with mashed potatoes and a veggie.  Great, filling, homey recipe!

This was wonderful!! The only thing I did different is simmer the sauce on the stove and use it as a gravy so the pork chops would stay crisp. Oh and I added fresh mushrooms to the sauce. This is a keeper!

My family really liked these pork chops.  Next time I would increase the gravy, esp if served with rice or mashed potatoes.  I also decreased the baking time, 30 mins before and 25 mins after and found it was plenty.  Next time, I'd like to try the golden onion as others have suggested.  Thanks for this recipe.

This was much easier than I thought it would be.  Now whenever I go to my mom's for supper she asks me to make this dish.  It's easy to work with and substitute different things.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. As others have said, I reduced the cooking time to 1 hour total or it would have been over cooked. I also added some seasoning to the "gravy" mixture (Greek mix). I will definitely make this again, thanks!

these turned out tender and tasty, even though I had to use cream of chicken instead of mushroom!  Only voluntary change was sauteing fresh mushrooms and green onions with the soup mix- will make this again for sure!

These make fantastic pork chops! I also use some fresh parsley with the breading. Didn't seem to make enough sauce for me, so next time I'll double it.

I'm not a big fan of pork chops so for me the recipe was just okay, but, my husband and children loved it! It did take 2 hours to prepare and cook. I followed the exact directs but doubled everything being I made 12 pork chops instead of 6. It will probably take a long time before I make this meal again being the prep and cook time is so long!

These turned out to be the best pork chops I ever made.  I made a few changes as per reading some other reviews.  I followed all the way to the soup.  I used cream of mushroom soup, sour cream and 2 tbsp milk.  Heated in microwave and added a package of dry gravy mix.  Poured over pork chops.  They were so tender all you need is a fork!  Thank you for this recipe.

This was a wow with my family. I stayed with the recipe.  I also made Scallop potatoes during the last 30 minutes of cooking time, and things came out perfect. I found that the cooking time was right for me. I did though cut the frying time in half on each side. 2 1/2 minutes of each side. Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe.

The chops turned out sooo tender! The sauce was very nicely flavored. My only problem with this recipes is that it is VERY salty (i added almost no salt to the chops). Defin. got my sodium in for the day.

Well, I am not a pork chop lover but this recipe is really good.  The only thing added was sauteed mushrooms and onions at the end.  The chops came out very moist.  Even my fussy 4 year old liked them. Thanks for the great recipe!

I usually don't like pork chops because they are tough and dry, but they were on sale and I thought I'd give it a shot...this was FABULOUS and every one of my family loved it.  Even asked for it again w/in the week! Excellent.

This was very good (and I'm not a pork fan).  I made it just as written but next time, I think I'll cook the sauce separately in a pot and put it on right before serving.  Baking it on top made the breading soggy (seemed to defeat the purpose of frying it till brown and crispy).  Still tasted good and the whole family enjoyed it.

Fantastic Pork Chops! Will make again for sure.  I double the gravy and served with mashed potatoes.  My son (9 yrs., normally not a picky eater) didn't like the gravy because of the wine taste.

My family and I really liked this dish.  I only gave it 4 stars because I took other reviewers' advice and made some changes.  I baked the chops for only 30 minutes.  I heated the sauce on the stove and poured over the chops and had plenty extra for dipping.

Quite tasty. Though, part of me didn't like the texture of the bread crumb coating; it ended up tasting a little on the soggy side from the soup, even though I browned it beforehand. I think I might like this better if I used the soup mixture as more of a dipping sauce as opposed to cooking the chops in it.

I made this recipe tonight and my husband and I loved it.  The pork chops were SO tender and juicy.  Since I didn't have White wine, I used Marsala wine sauce.  When it was time to put the sauce over the meat, I mixed some green beans and carrots into the sauce, covered the pork chops with the mixture, and baked it for 30 minutes.  Since I don't like vegetables, it's a delicious way to eat them!

Fantastic pork chops!  They were very flavorful and tender.  I browned them in my covered roaster and then baked them in the same pan rather than transfer to a baking dish.  I also substituted crushed crackers mixed with italian seasoning for the bread crumbs.  Even with my substitutions, they were wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum, yum, and YUM!!!!  After just a few bites, one of my girls turned to me and said, "Your making this again, right?".  Even the daughter who doesn't like pork chops gobbles hers down and asked if there was more.  The chops were so moist and tender----absolutely delish!!!

Thank you for this great recipe... We will be fixing this in our home on regular basis. It did not take as long as I thought it would. I even made it on a Tuesday night without planning. I pretty much followed the instructions provided. I would advise that you keep an eye on the pork chops when frying. Directions stated to cook on each side for 5 min on med high heat. Well, after frying chops 3 min the breading was burned so I just flipped the chops. Once they were a nice golden brown (on one side) I placed the chops in the oven to bake. (Portion sized for 2) I doubled up on the cream of mushroom and it was absolutely delicious. Next time I will try it with cream of chix.

Pretty good!  It's difficult to find something to do for pork chops that both my  husband and I enjoy.  I omitted the garlic salt, but added cracked pepper. Also, I used the mushroom soup mixture for only three pork chops for enough cream for all.  If I did the full 6 pork chop recipe, I would double the mushroom soup mixture.  Delicious!  My husband loved it.  LOL.

Totally yummy! I didn't cook it for a whole hour, only 30 minutes before pouring the sauce and then adding 30 more minutes. I wonder if that's why the meat wasn't as soft/tender as I would have liked. The chops were almost 1 inch thick. Nevertheless, it was good.

It was food.  That's all I can say about it.  The mushroom I cooked with it were terrific, but it was just okay.  Maybe it's because I'm from where we really know our pork chops, but these were not great.

These were good, moist chops. I did make some adjustments as others had. I doubled the soup, omited the wine and used milk in its' place, and decreased the cook time. 1 hour cook time total is plenty.  Next time I may use even more soup b/c there was not much extra to put on potatoes or noodles.

Overall everyone seemed to like this just fine. I think that there are plenty other recipes that I like better. My pan was too hot and almost blackened the chops, which then made for a not so wonderful flavor to the sauce. The ones that made it out unburnt were okay. No one had any major complaints about it but no one had great raves about it either.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, and there are a few changes I'd make before making this again.  First I'd only use cream of chicken and I think I'd skip the wine to reduce the amount of liquid as the gravy was a bit runny.

I made this to use up a pork tenderloin I had sitting around.  I did reduce the cookign time only slightly, but I was amazed at the wonderful texture and flavor of this recipe.  I used cream of chicken soup instead, and made this again using chicken instead of pork.  The sauce is absolutely fantastic, and SO easy!  Thank you!

I've made these twice now. I made them last night for dinner and, as I was setting the items out for the mixing, I realized I was almost completely out of bread crumbs. So I decided to use quick oats instead and it was still fantastic!! 

I just mixed the oats with a little basil, oregano, parsley, thyme, and garlic and used it the same as the bread crumbs.

Thanks for the delicious easy recipe. I had already marinated the chops for 30 min in teriyaki marinade when I found your recipe. I continued with your recipe changing only the bread crumbs. I ground up 4 whole wheat bread slices and added italian spice instead and I didn't have the white wine so I just added more milk to the soup. My fussiest eater said these are the best pork chops you have ever made. Definitely a keeper!

These pork chops were good but i would spend the effort it took to make them when really you can just cook your chops in mushroom soup and get a very similar meal with almost no effort at all.

My husband never gives me feedback on meals, but when I fixed another pork chop recipe he asked why I didn't fix this one again and mentioned it was even better as leftovers!

This was delicious. Next time I will know better not to over fry in pan, some got a little burned. I will also know next time not to use too much seasoning. I think I had just a bit too much. I gave it a 5 because even with those mistakes I made it was very tender and had wonderful flavor. I only wish I had white wine. I didnt have it and had to use more milk and soup but Im sure with the wine it would be much better. Thank you for this recipe!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and everyone was impressed. I will def be making this again.  I only used two pork chops and kept the sauce the same. It was the perfect amount of sauce...so i might double the sauce mixture if I were doing more pork chops. But, I like things really saucy.

These are wonderfully delicious, my husband and my children (ages 5, 4 and 2) loved them.  So for those of you of have picky eaters.  I too changed it a little and did not use the wine, but used cream of celery and cream of mushroom soup with a cup of milk.  Yummy, yummy!!!  Can't wait to have it again.  Oh and I used 4 pork chops and it worked just as well.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband called this the best pork chops he's ever had. However, like other reviewers, I didn't have to bake them as long. They were juicy and the italian bread crumbs made a delicious crust over them before baking. I will make this recipe again!

This was very good and pretty easy to make! We only had two pork chops but I followed the soup recipe anyway, after reading the reviews of wanting extra. Glad I did! I made with white rice and the sauce tasted so good with it. I baked 30 min without the sauce and 30 min with.

I usually stay clear from anything with cream of anything soup in it, but I thought I would give this a try after reading all the great reviews. This was great! I did make a few changes, as others suggested. I sauted fresh crimini mushrooms in the pork chop drippings and added them to the sauce. I doubled the wine, doubled the milk and added a can of golden mushroom soup. I only baked the chops 20 minutes, and then baked them with the sauce an additional 20 minutes. This recipe was excellent! Thanks for sharing!!

I took this recipe and used it to my advantage. I ruined some boneless porkchops earlier, so I took them and sliced them thinly and put it in a frying pan. Then I took minced garlic, ground peppercorn, ground sea salt and seasoned it(a lot). Took diced onion, and mushrooms and sauteed it. Then I took a can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with 1/2cup of milk and added it to the meat. Served it over a baked potato.( I also added a few dashes of rice vinegar to the soup, because I didn't have white wine. Not sure it did anything though.)This was an amazing meal and I will be making this again!

Great recipe and the chops turned out so tender! Changes I made: Used house seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder) to season the chops, and I substituted 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery (I doubled the sauce recipe and didn't have cream of mushroom on hand).  Everything else was the same.  My husband (like many of yours) has requested this stay on our permanent rotation.  The only thing I may do differently next time is not use so much house seasoning as it was a little too salty for my personal taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe at all... the white wine was overwhelming and the meat ended up dry despite cooking 1/2 an hour less than the recipe called for.

Very quick recipe! The chops come out super moist. The only thing I changed was instead of cream of mushroom, I used cream of chicken. That's what I had in my cabinet and it turned out great!! My husband hates mushrooms anyway . I also cut down the time of cooking. I baked it for about 45 minutes then added the sauce, then baked for another 15 minutes. Served it with rice. Thanks for the recipe!!

I never made fried pork chops before, so I gave this a whirl.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup (or any soup for that matter) so I smothered them in brown gravy instead.  Served them with small baked potatoes and they were a hit.  My husband's expression made me think he'd gone back to his childhood for a minute.  Will definitely make again (with the soup and wine next time since I'm sure that's tasty).

Followed exactly except used c.o. chic and c.o. onion soups, doubled sauce (didn't need to) and I used 3 thick boneless chops.  It was good, maybe a tad too much wine, I used Merryvale chardonnay, which is about $30 a bottle.  Maybe depends on the wine so next time I'll half it and then add more to taste.  Next time I will also cook the sauce in the same pan in which I fry the chops, and keep seperated until ready to serve.  The breading just fell off the chops and you might as well not even bother and just sear them and then cook in the sauce if you do not care to have the breadcrumb coating.  Otherwise keep sauce and chops seperated until serving.

I agree that an hour is even far too long to cook them, but apart from them being too done for my taste... it's a very easy and generally aggreeable recipe. Not bland and not pretentious. I do suggest browning the outside rather quickly to trap all the extra juices and again... cutting down the bake time to maybe 30min. Can't wait to play with this one.

This was really good. surprisingly good! I didn't have any white wine, so I used vermouth. And I have to agree with other reviewers who said the wine/vermouth is key to the flavor. I would definitely not leave it out. I doubled the sauce as other reviews suggested, and found that was too much. This is our new pork chop recipe. Definitely worth the time. Thanks! update 7/3/11- I made this tonight, but sauteed onions and mushrooms in the pork oil before adding soup, milk, and chardonnay. Very good. I didn't combine the sauce and the pork in the oven since I had kids who didn't want the sauce - and I think it's better combined. Just be sure not to overcook the pork.  Delicious with buttered egg noodles.

We liked this recipe. It was a little bit of prep but not too bad.  The only change I made was to use half the wine it called for.  Wine can overpower a sauce so what I do is add less than what is called for and taste test till it is the desired strength.

Awesome and easy to make! If you get to cut your own chops you can choose how thick you want them. I cut them thin (from a big pork roast chunk) and it didn't take long to brown and bake. Very juicy and tender! Breading really keeps pork from drying out and tastes delicious! Sauce may be served separately instead of baked with the chops but this is personal preference. Overall, excelent recipe! Will make often!

This is the best pork chop recipe I have ever tried.  Only suggestion would be to add 3/4 cup of white wine instead, to get a deeper wine flavor.  My three year old even enjoyed this recipe.

Great recipe, perfect for a weeknight dinner.  I did take the advice from other reviews and used cream of chicken instead of mushroom.  I also used reduced fat and it gave the sauce a thinner texture, which I preferred.  Loved it!

I didn't think these pork chops were anything to get excited about.  They were a little bland to me. I followed the recipe exactly.  They were very tender but to me they just lacked flavor. Sorry, I probably won't be making this one again. :(

This was pretty good for baked pork chops. I used thin boneless chops and cooked in olive oil on med/high until brown.  I baked for 20 and then added the mushroom (Cambell's Select Portobello  Mushroom soup) and wine sauce..cooked another 30 minutes.  The breading was soggy of course, but still tasty. Served with egg noodles and butter.

I made this just the other night and I'm making it again tomorrow night.  My family loved it.  My husband hates pork, but he loved this dish.  He actually had two servings of it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe and is very easy to do.  I used a 1-1/4 inch thick 1/2 pound boneless pork loin (one meat eater in the family) and followed the instructions exactly.  I only had to brown the coating for 3 minutes a side until it was a very nice brown color, but I did cook for 1 hour and then for 30 minutes.  I made 1/2 the sauce recipe which turned out to be just slightly too much.  Wonderful flavor, beautiful color!

I thought that it had good flavor with the wine and soup. The breading wasn't staying on after I baked it.

Ahhh!  Just a satisfied sigh after a great meal! Comfort food to the max.  This is a perfect recipe.  Followed exactly except for the soup, used cream of chicken.  My family doesn't like mushrooms or I would use the mushroom soup.  Excellent, excellent recipe, thanks!!! The guys at hubby's work loved it too!!

This was just ok.  I followed many of the suggestions by other reviewers by keeping the sauce on the side,  but it was too late as they were no longer crispy when I took them out of the oven.  The gravy although heavy, had a good flavor. I used half a can of golden mushroom and half can of cream of mush soup I also started by sauting mushrooms and garlic and added extra wine and a bit of worstershire sauce.  Probably won't make again

Generally speaking I hate pork chops, however I made this the other night and decided to give it a go. 

I didn't have any white wine and didn't want to substitute with broth, so I followed a suggestion of using Worcestershire sauce, and added in a tsp of Dijon mustard as well.  

I also sauted some thick chopped mushrooms and onions in the oil from the pork and topped it with during that last 30 minutes of baking.  

It was so great!  My kids loved it, my husband finished it off.  This recipe will certainly be reused!

I rate this a two only because it wasn't inedible. We ate it, but grudgingly so. Bland and made it exactly the way the recipe called for. Pointless in my opinion to bread something, fry it, and then have the nice crunchy breading turn to mush in the oven. Better luck next time I suppose, but it won't be with this recipe.

Great Recipe.  I also used Golden Mushroom soup. and baked it only 40 min. I made extra gravy for the mashed potatoes I made with it.  I will make this again, because Mr. Tom said I should.

The pork chops were good but they were too dry after an hour in the oven. The sauce tasted too much like cream of mushroom but that may be because I passed on the wine due to my pregnancy. However, the sauce was good on our mashed potatoes. Next time I will remove the chops from the oven earlier and try another sauce. Thanks for sharing.

These are REALLY good if you don't mind heavy food. I usually only eat one heavy meal a day so I don't mind but the over all taste of this dish was excellent. I will definitely make it again.

Great chops.  Used 1 can Golden Mushroom & 1 can Cream of Mush.  Also added big dollop of chive cream cheese to sauce (heated soup, cream cheese & wine in saucepan first).  Will make again!

Hands down, our favorite way to have pork chops now!  I made a few changes to the recipe though.  I didn't bother with the flour as it didn't seem necessary. I skipped the part where it says to bake for an hour before adding the sauce - instead I covered them with the sauce and topped the dish with more of the breadcrumbs before putting in the oven.  Baked for 15 minutes then broiled for 5.  Top was golden and the chops were cooked perfectly!!  Definitely recommend keeping the wine in the recipe - it's what makes the flavor!!

porkchop came out nice and juicy. the porkchop burned a bit when i followed the five minute on each side direction. the food came out ok. i guess its just not for me. probably would not try the recipe again, although i do like how nice and juicy the meat was at the end.

I thought this recipe was excellent, and I would love to cook it again! I am a budding new cook, and I thought this recipe was very easy to make. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars only because I was worried about how good it is for my father-in-law (he's diabetic). Other than that, it was excellent! I prepared it alongside Parmesan rice and spinach.

I followed the recipe, except I only cooked them for about 45 minutes because they weren't that thick. They turned out great! My husband says he wants them every night. He's already had three chops and he's headed back for more.

This recipie was very flavorful.  I used Marsala cooking wine and it was exceptionally tasty.  I like that the pork chops were tender and not dried out.  I didn't like the almost burntlike appearance of the chops after frying, but it wasn't burnt tasting thank goodness.  I will make again changing the stove temp to make chops brown instead of dark and adding some fresh mushrooms.

I must have done something wrong. These were not dry but did not have a great flavor. They were tender though. I used a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of golden mushroom. Will probably not make this again. Had to throw out leftovers.

I don't know what I did wrong but these came out extremely dry.  I covered them and only put them in for 35 minutes and they still seemed tough and dry.  The sauce was not that great either.  Like a few of you said it tasted like I was eating chops with a can of soup poured on top.  I had to throw out the leftovers :(

The pork chops were tender and juicy. The gravy was very good with the chops. I did not have white wine on hand so I added chicken broth instead. I made mashed potatos on the side. My family loved this dish. will definetly make again.

This recipe was amazing! So tender and good. My boyfriend wants me to make it again tonight, and so do I! All I did different was bake it for 20 minutes the first time and 20 minatues again for the second time. I also did not use white wine because I didn't have any. Thanks for this recipe! :)

I am new to cooking, but I wanted to surprise my husband with my culinary skills. I had taken some time to look up a receipe. I thought this one was quick and easy, yet showed a higher level of cooking. OMG he LOVED it!!! He said it was great. I cooked the porkchops for 30/30 and added about 1 tablespoon of sour cream, like someone else suggested. We are having friends over for dinner tomorrow and this is what I am making!!!! GREAT and EASY!!!!

Good.  I adjusted the cooking time.  No way did the chops need 1.5 hours in the oven.

Wow, everyone loved these!  I made them for 19 and had to use more oil(I was frying with 2 pans going at the same time) and I did not use all the bread crumbs the the recipe called for. Not the healthiest meal in the world, but I will make these again!

This was a great dish for my family. Everyone loved it including my picky kids who do not like sauces. I did add some fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce.  I will be making this one again.

These were really good.  The breading was great.  At the last minute I realized I was out of cream of mushroom soup so I used Cream of celery and a small cans of mushrooms in the gravy.  It tasted great.  The wine really takes it up a notch.  Plenty of gravy for us and we served it over mashed potatoes.  I also agree the cooking time is much too long.  I did 3 mintues a side in frying pan and then 30/30.  Will definitely make again and try the golden mushroom soup.

This was very good. Even when I improvised a few ingredients that would probably have better been left out, it still tasted great!

Definitely a repeat.

This was so delicious, very tender, moist, and flavorful!  Instead of Cream of Mushroom soup, I used Cream of Chicken with Herbs (because I didn't have Cream of Mushroom on hand). My husband loved and said this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was very easy to make and was very, very good.  Like others, I almost burned them in the frying pan, so go easy on the heat.  They could have used just a little more flavor, but I didn't have the white wine so that might have been the difference.  Picky husband also really like it - he even made note of how tender they were that he could cut it with his fork and didn't need a knife!

I was looking for a simple recipe for pork chop and I came across this one which is actually a step notch from the traditional recipe. 
I cooked this tonight and my family loved it.  They loved it so much that they almost licked their plates... :-)

Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This tasted good but the breading fell off the chop.  Maybe next time just pour sauce last or no breading.  Otherwise, it was great.  Only cooked mine for the 40/30 min.  Would make again.

Oh my gosh! This reminded me of chicken fried steak with country gravy (and a lot easier!). I used thin pork chops and cut the baking time to 30/30 and they were perfect. For the full "experience" make sure you serve with mashed potatoes, but be warned, this is not for dieters. It's a total comfort food meal!

Good comforting meal, added mushrooms. Also, next time will only brown about 3 minutes per side. I use only bone-in chops from Costco. I baked them at 45/45 minutes not 1 hr./30min. Keeper.

I made this recipe tonight.  It was very good served with mashed potatoes and the gravy poured over.  As others suggested I only cooked it for 30/30.  That was enough time.  Also added some pepper to the gravy mixture.  Very good.  Will make it again.  Thanks!

We loved this recipe.  I did double the sauce recipe as others had suggested, but felt like it was really too much sauce and ended up throwing some out (more sauce than meat).  May have been because the package of pork chops I bought only had 4 (large) chops in it.  But the flavors were very good, and I will definitely make it again.

This came out great!  Everyone loved it.  The pork chops were so tender.  I did add 1 package of pork gravy mix with a cup of water so there would be extra gravy.  Will make it again.  Thanks.

My family was disappointed with this recipe.  It was very bland and pretty heavy.  I did not care for the white wine sauce as it made the sauce to bitter.  I ended up adding more cream of mush and a touch of sour cream.  That helped a bit but not enough to want to make this again.

Fabulous! chops were tender (I also browned them well as was suggested in an earlier review) and baked them in less time (45/20). Perfect both times we made them!

I followed the advice of one of the other members by throwing everything in the crock pot and let it cook for 5 hours. I mixed all the ingredients(but used Cream of Chicken instead) and added fresh mushrooms. These pork chops ended up being so, so tender that they fell a part!  It was almost like a Beef Stroganoff consistiency so I served it over Egg Noodles.  Very Tasty!

THIS RECIPE IS GREAT! AFTER FRYING IN THE SKILLET, I HAVE PUT IT IN THE CROCK POT ON LOW FOR 4-5 HOURS. THE MEAT FALLS OFF THE BONE AND IS SO DELICIOUS! I HAVE ALSO USED THIS RECIPE USING GROUND BEEF PATTIES INSTEAD OF PORK CHOPS.

Very good.  My husband even loved these and he always thought that if pork chops weren't barbequed, they weren't worth eating!  My only complaint was that either my pork chops were too big or my pan was too small.  I haven't yet gotten 6 pork chops in one 9x13 pan.  I usually have to split them up in a 9x13 and a 9x9.

Very tasty!  I don't usually like pork chops, but these were tender and moist.  I substituted two tablespoons of sour cream in for the white wine, and it was delicious.  I will definitely make again!

I was actually surprised at how well these turned out...I'm very picky.  My 7 year old daughter cleaned he her plate, asked for more 2 times, and said she wished I'd make it often. Some things I did differently were:  I salted one side of the pork chops w/Old Bay seasoned salt, the other w/garlic salt, shortened the baking time to 30 min (my chops were 1/2 inch thick), & cooked the sauce separately on a pan and poured it over the pork when serving.

VERY TASTY. I will make this again.  It is not all that different from making breaded porkchops without the added calories for the topping.  But, it is good.  I will likely make this again some time.

This one is definately a keeper!!  I started to make this dish, and realized I didn't have any eggs!! So, I seasoned the chops with garlic powder and salt, and smeared mustard on the chops and dredged them in flour.  I cooked them in the skillet, and then baked with the wine, soup and milk.  Absolutely delicious!!!!!!

I followed the recipe but added a dash of cayenne pepper and nutmeg for a kick.  The pork chops were crispy after frying them in the pan and then got soggy after baking them.  I did not pour the gravy over the chops but kept it separate.  Next time I will skip the baking and just fry them longer until cooked and then serve the gravy on the side again.  Great gravy!

Even though I changed the recipe a bit, it still gets 5 stars. I didn't have any seasoned salt so I used Sazon. I didn't have any milk or white wine, so I mixed the cream of mushroom soup with some water and some french onion soup that I made from a packet. One of the best tasting pork chop recipes I have ever tried.

This would have been better if I used a better cut of meat. I used "assorted pork loin chops" that were really cheap on sale, but they weren't very cleanly cut and had fat in seemingly random places, making this hard to eat. A higher quality of meat would have made eating this dish more enjoyable. I cut the recipe down to four chops instead of six (although I kept the same amount of sauce). The chops were so big that only two would fit in the skillet at the same time, and I could barely squeeze the four chops in the 9x13. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and sauted 8 oz of sliced fresh mushrooms in the pan I used to fry the chops in and put that into the sauce. I baked my chops for 35 minutes and then checked the temps, and they were about 190-200 degrees at the thickest parts, so definately done! I added the sauce and baked 20 minutes more. Next time I think I will just heat the sauce up on the stove, because it made the breading very mushy.

My fiance loved this! I followed the recipe step by step except I cut down the cooking time. 20 minutes without the soup mix and another 20 minutes with the soup mix. I think I put it in a little too long because the pork chops came out slightly dry. But I'll definitely make this again! I made this with the "Gourmet Mushroom Risotto" recipe on the side. You can find it on this site too.

This receipe was great I added parm-reggiano cheese to the sauce to taste along with liberal amount of pepper. I also baked this recipe in half the amount of time and the chops reached an internal temp of 160 degrees reccommended for pork.

Delicious! I added sauteed mushrooms with garlic and scallions, and worcestershire sauce to the mixture. I used bone-in pork chops and they came out really tender and juicy. I only baked them for a total of 30 minutes and they were perfect. I served it with rice and will try mashed potatoes next time. My family loved it and will be making this often for sure!

OMG...this is the best smothered pork chops I have EVER had!  I have made this twice & both times the pork was so tender!  It just fell off with a fork!! Yum!  I did use sherry instead of white wine b/c that's all I had & it was delicious!

This recipe was extremely flavorful, and fairly easy to make. It was enjoyed by my whole family, including my parents who were eating with us at the time. I used fairly thin pork chops and used 9 of them since they were so thin. I also used 1/2 cup of wine and 1/3 cup of milk, instead of the opposite. And I heated the sauce in a pan on the stove before pouring it over the pork chops and baking them a bit longer, just due to the fact that my pork chops didn't need to spend much time in the oven. I did discover that you don't really need as many breadcrumbs as it calls for, so you can probably cut back on that. Otherwise, the wine gives the sauce and pork chops an excellent flavor, and I will definitely be using this recipe again.

So tender and delicious ! I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to my bread crumbs, and in the soup mixture, I added a jar of sliced mushrooms. This is a keeper recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I did dredge the chops in flour first so the egg and breading would stick a little better.  Would recommend that you do that.  My chops were between 1 and 1 1/2 inch thick.  Cooked according to directions and they came out very tender.  My teen son said they are the best pork chops he has ever had! Will use this one again.  Thank you for the recipe.

This looked like a pretty quick and simple recipe.  I used golden mushroom soup instead of regular cream of 'shroom, tasted the sauce and thought it needed some punch.  So I added hot sauce, red pepper flakes, salt, onion powder, minced garlic and a little bit on onion soup mix (all to taste, of course).  Baked the chops in the oven for 30 min, poured the sauce over and baked for another 20.  When they came out, they were juicy, and tender, no knife needed.

When the kids ask for seconds, and hubby says please make again, I know I have a winner. This was a great recipe for my 11-year-old to help with. He loved the dipping and coating. He opted for extra bread crumbs on the chops - how could I refuse. I used two cans of soup as suggested - one low fat and one regular (that's what I had). It was good and next time I'll just go with low fat. That's good because we're having it again this week.

This was terrific!  All 5 of our picky kids loved it, and my hubby, who generally does not like pork, even raved about it.  I used center cut pork chops, which I think cook up the most tender.   I wonder if the few negative reviews used another less tender cut, because mine were great.  This will be a regular on our tables from now on!!

I have to disagree with all of the rave reviews.  Perhaps, people have just had some really BAD pork chops so this tastes so good in comparison???  I don't know.  In all fairness, however, I will say that I used Golden Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Mushroom, so perhaps that makes all the difference. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  They came out nice and tender and the presentation was nice, but the taste was not.  Tasted like canned soup poured on top.  Nothing special and definitely not worth the time, mess and calories!  Surprisingly, however, my very picky 6-year-old loved this recipe.  I would have bet a million bucks she wouldn't have even tried it.  But she did and she even asked for seconds!  Later that evening, instead of sneaking some sort of sweets for dessert, I caught her picking the leftover chops!  Since nobody else in the family (even hubby who usually eats anything!) liked them, there's plenty for her to eat tomorrow, and the next night, and the next night...

I used cream of chicken instead of mushrooms (neither my husband nor I like them) and other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought the wine was too strong, maybe if I had used a sweeter one.  I did not see a reason to double the soup, the recipe makes more than enough gravy. ***UPDATE:  I made this using just a tiny bit of wine and my husband loved it!  Still did not need to double gravy, and it was so much better.

This is a great recipe. It's so easy. The extra step of browning the chops before baking is worth it. This is going to become one of my staple recipes.

These were fantastic! My kids are picky and supper last night was so quiet as they couldn't seem to eat them fast enough! We'll definitely have these again!

This was BEYOND yummy! It is now my husband's new favorite meal.  He has made me promise not to adjust it at all...he loves it so much.  I serve it with mashed potatoes (it makes its own gravy) and corn...TO DIE FOR!  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

Really good. I only had wafer thin chops with bones. Still tasted great, but will make again, using boneless pork chops. We dont like mushrroms, so I used cream of chicken. A little salty, but you can use low sodium cream of chicken. Will make again!!!

This was excellent.  My son almost refused to eat it because he doesn't like pork and he asked for seconds.  I only had 4 chops, so I didn't double the gravy, but I did add fresh mushrooms.  And the gravy went great with mashed potatoes.

I made a couple of changes - I used one can of cream of chicken along with one can of the cream of mushroom. I omitted the wine (didn't have any!) but I bet that would be good.  I also added some dried minced onion, a can of mushrooms (fresh would be awesome), paprika, coarse black pepper, and some garlic powder into the "gravy" before pouring it over the pork chops.  I used boneless chops - which I would recommend if time is short.  These are a keeper!

This recipe is really great, however, the hour long cooking time really made the pork dry and chewy so I have now cut it down to half an hour and after which, I add the soup and cook an additional half hour which has helped with the toughness.  Great and easy recipe though.

Terrific!  I have made them just as the recipe states and I have made them with the sauce on the stove top.  Both ways are tremendous.

Made this one for a small group, and they all loved it.  Only complaint is there isn't enough gravy.  This dish makes the most juicy pork chops, and it does not have that over processed casserole taste.

Wow.  I used 8 1/2 inch boneless chops, threw them in a ziploc w/ the flour and seasoned salt and let them sit during the day while I was at work.  Breaded, fried them up quickly (3 min each side), baked 15 mins, covered with sauce (doubled naturally), baked another 15 min and PERFECTION.  Also - used Riesling for white wine and cream of chicken because we're not mushroom fans.  Could use a little seasoning in the sauce - slightly bland... will play around.

This is my Fiance's favorite recipe--he raves about it everytime I make it.  I bake it with the chops on top of cut and peeled potatoes and carrots, double the sauce and pour it over everything.  The vegetables taste great after they absorb the mixture!!  YUMMY

This recipe is a definite keeper! A very easy meal to prepare. The pork chops turned out delicious, moist, and tender. We could cut them with the gentle push of a fork.

My first success with pork chops, woo hoo! I used the thin ones, so I baked it for only 30 minutes and they were still tender and moist.  My husband absolutely raved about them and ate the leftovers for breakfast, lunch, and dinner - a first for him, too! Definately will be added to our recipe rotation. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this dish last night for my family and it got RAVE reviews. Best Pork Chops ever to date. Had no white wine so, instead I used Vodka which had that restaurant taste out of the oven.

The pork chops were tender and delicious, but I thought the white wine was too overpowering.  Next time I will definitely scale back on the wine.  Very easy to make and the wife loved it.

I won't comment on the flavor because I just don't think this dish was for me.My husband devoured it though so thats a good sign. I added sauteed onion and mushroom/garlic/paprika/sour cream. I probably would make this again but I would use BONELESS CHOPS. With all the sauce, it makes it hard to see the bone and it would just be easier if they weren't in there.

despite the long baking time, the pork was incredibly tender and there was no need to use a knife. it simply flaked off with a fork! my boyfriend and i don't enjoy mushrooms, but i still used a cream of mushroom soup base, along with water and half and half. i also sauteed onions to add into the mixture. i served them with garlic mashed potatoes and vegetables. fantastic and pretty easy!

I prepared this while also feeding my 10-month-old so I totally blanked and forgot the garlic salt and seasoning salt.  By the time I remembered they were already breaded, fried and in the oven.  I thought they wouldn't be any good, but they were actually very good, even without the seasoning (although I will season them next time).  My husband said this is the kind of meal he would brag about at work!  I did use 2 cans of cream soup based on some of the reviews, but really thought we would have only needed 1 can next time.  This is a great way to make pork chops.

Pretty easy recipe.  Pork turned out very tender (cut it with a fork).  "Gravy" was served over mashed potatoes and was just ok.  All in all dinner was well received.

I'd give this 4.5 if I could. I wasn't sure what type of pork chops it called for but I had thin, bone-in chops and reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes, then added topping for 20 minutes. It was tender, but not extremely tender. Maybe cooking for the full time would make it more tender. Either way, the flavor was good. I breaded with Panko which kept it crispy but light.

Very Nice...I sauteed up some mushrooms, onions & garlic and added it in with the soup mixture. I also added a few drops of hot sauce to the eggs and kicked up the seasoning in the flour & bread crumbs. Cooked 40/25. YUM!

We loved this recipe - we even made it 2 weeks in a row!  I did think they came out a little dry, so the second time I reduced the cook time by 15 minutes.  I also used cream of celery soup and browning seasoning.  I love the taste of the wine in the gravy - served it over rice.

I made this dish last night.  I was rather let down while eating it.  I cooked it for 60/20 and with 1" thick pork chops, and they weren't fall off the bone tender.  I could barely cut them with a fork.  As for taste, they were great.  That's why it's getting a 4 star.  After reading the reviews, I was ready for the most spectacular dish ever.  It wasn't spectacular, it was great.

My husband, who is not a big fan of pork chops is raving that these were the best pork chops he has ever had. Definitely will make again. Now that I have made it once, next time I think I will add some onions to the soup mixture.

I made these for my New Year's Day DInner and served with cabbage and black eyed peas. My dad said these were some of the best pork chops he had ever tasted! I highly suggest the wine, it adds great flavor. The only change I made was adding some onion I chopped and sauteed with garlic to the soup mixture-I poured over the chops before baking. I thought about not cooking the whole 11/2 hours, it seemed so long. However, I did cook the whole 11/2 hours and they were so tender and delicous. I would defintely make these again, and would be great for company.

The chops turned out very moist and flavorfull but I think I ruined them by using the reduced sodium cream of mushroom.  Hubby liked them but I wasn't a fan.  Next time I will try them with the regular kind and rate the recipe.

This was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly, but used 4 very thick, boneless porkchops instead, and it was just fantastic. I served it with egg noodles. A good, hearty meal and you don't have to hover over it while it cooks!

This recipe gets so many great reviews so I was eager to try it.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a little marsala wine to the soup mixture.  I was very dissapointed.  My husband who is not a picky eater did not care for it either but said he might have like it better without the breading.  Maybe I will try again without the marsala and breading.  The pork chops were very tender though.

Easy recipe! Really doesn't take that long to prepare since the prep-work is so simple.  Realized at the last minute that I didn't have bread crumbs so I substituted with crushed up Italian croutons.  Mmm...still nice n' crispy even after baking in the sauce!  Served with squash and and tossed salad.  My residential food critics (aka...kids!) liked it even though they questioned what exactly I was serving!  I used a family size mushroom soup & 3/4 can of milk.  Plenty of "gravey" to cover the chops and still had lots leftover!  I will use this recipe over and over again.

Very good!!  I made this dish last night and it was a huge his with my boys. Even my 2 year old that is an extremely picky eater, ate all of his pork chop.  I did add an extra cup of milk to make a little more sauce.  Thought it was perfect.

Of course, this MUST be a great recipe, with the rating it has receive.  My boyfriend has never wanted me to make pork chops for him since he has only ever eaten dry, fried chops.  I tried these and he is now a beleiver. He says they are not just good, but REALLY good and wants them again.  By the way, we are both over 50....  so not the first time I've cooked pork chops.

This was very, very good! We get our meat from the butcher, and it doesn't have all of the water that store-bought ones do. So, there wasn't enough sauce. I am making them again tonight and will try to add some water to the sauce and see if that helps.

I thought this recipe was ok.  I omitted the breading and oil part of the recipe.  I also put my fry pan into the oven instead of transferring the chops to save a dirty dish.  The pork chops were tender and the recipe was easy plus I had all the ingredients on hand.  I will continue my quest for the perfect pork chop recipe.  Thanks-

We made this recipe the other night.  It was good, but I thought it would be better.  The topping wasn't crispy, but it was still good enough to pick out of the pan when we were done!  We made extra sauce to pour over rice, and we added onion.  I will be making this again.

My fiancee said it was the best meal I had ever made.  I'm a vegetarian and trying to expand my skills at cooking meat, so thought I would give this recipe a whirl--glad I did!  I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and sour cream and a little milk instead of just milk, and then about 1/4 cup dry sherry instead of the 1/3 cup white whine and apparently it turned out great!  Thanks!

My husband & I agreed that this was just OK. For as much work and dishes involved, I was expecting something much better. I followed recipe exactly, covered with foil & everything and they were already pretty dry cooking them only a little over an hour. Would not make again.

I used Pork Loin Chops about 2 inches thick. The batter was delicious and kept the meat fork tender after all the cooking. I will however double the recipe for the gravy. The husband loves gravy and the original recipe does not make enough. We will have this one again.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!  My husband doesn't really like pork but he asked me to put this one in the recipe file for keeps!!  It was also easy to make which is key with a toddler running around.  The first time I made it I forgot the white wine...it didn't matter it was great both ways.  I also used condensed cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic since it is lower in fat than the plain cream of mushroom soup.  THANKS!!

As if this one needed another review, but...it was really great!  Very, very rich though, not something to have very often.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used four pork chops and kept the full sauce amount to serve over rice.  I definately thing that the wine shouldn't be left out, if possible, because it really gives it a kick.  Also, as other reviewers have stated, don't be afraid of the 90 min. cooking time--I was, but they turned out beautifully.  We didn't even need knives.  Just be sure to use foil, otherwise it just wouldn't work.

This recipe is very tasty.  Be careful not to brown the pork chops too much.  We did, and the chops dried out a bit.  We also too much seasoning salt.  You really don't need much, the flavor w/o it is great.  We will definitely play w/ the recipe again.  Highly suggested to add fresh mushrooms as well...hmmm hmmm good!

Super recipe!  I almost had all of the ingredients so I had to improvise.  I used shake n bake instead of the flour, eggs, and bread crumbs.  No white wine in the sauce.  The frying sealed in the juices (neat trick!) and the pork chops were falling off of the bones (the best way to be)!  Rave reviews from the husband who just flew in from a business trip to Canada!  White linens and candle light...  Thank you!

This was a good recipe, but not worth the 5 stars. My dad did have thirds, though! I made a few changes. Instead of olive oil, I used vegetable oil, and I replaced the cream of mushroom soup with cream of celery. Also, I omitted the wine and used water instead. I will be making this again.

Okay... "Wow!" is all my boyfriend could say when he tried this.  I thought it was outstanding, too, the pork chops were so tender and good.  I made it with a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup and only used 3 chops but kept everything else the same.  Next time I'll skip the egg and bread crumb step an just dredge them in flour.  This tastes so much like Angel Chicken from this web site!

I love this recipe, because it's pretty forgiving.  I made it as-is the first time, and we both loved it.  It was a tiny bit bland, but I like that in recipes - it gives me a chance to modify to my taste.  I always cut the recipe in half.  After a few recipes, this time around turned out the worst ever - and I think I'd still give it a 5-star rating.  I used Shake-n-Bake on the pork (hot & spicy) and baked it at 400 for 12 minutes instead of frying the pork.  I lowered the temp to 350 (and started cooking the rice) and dumped in my mushroom soup mixture.  It was not condensed soup, so I skipped the additional milk, but I did add in about 1/2 cup of diced onion.    I cooked the pork another 35 minutes (it should have been about 20-25 min more).  The pork was slightly overcooked, but it had excellent flavor.  There was plenty of the soup to use over white rice, which is probably my favorite part.  It is very tasty!

My husband HATES meats covered in sauces, so I was shocked that he actually really liked this one!  My mother-in-law told me that it was "exceptionally good" (high praise indeed!).  I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, added fresh mushrooms & 1 tsp. of Worchestershire sauce to the soup before covering the chops.  I teamed it with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes & a green bean casserole which really complimented the flavors of this dish.

Tender, tasty, and simply mouthwatering. I only made 4 pork chop (with bone)but did not customize the other ingredients. Use the entire can of soup, then you will have gravy to serve with wide noodles. You won't be disappointed!

I am not a HUGE pork chop fan that is why I didn't give it the five stars.  Meat was very tender, i was afraid it would have been overcooked but not the case at all.  I used cream of celery because my family doesn't like mushroom.  A little salty but overall great recipe.

Yum! This was a pretty difficult recipe for me, but it came out great! Neither me, or my husband are big fans of porkchops. But thought I would try this because of the rave reviews! =)

Breading was great, fried great! breading stayed on, just really loved it!

Very good. I used Healthy Request soup (for less sodium) and Chardonnay.  I only used half of the milk and substituted the other half with more wine.  I fried and baked exactly as the recipe stated and the chops were very tender.

This is one of those recipes I am SO GLAD I found.  My dad and my fiance LOVE these.  The gravy is really delicious--I always double it so there's a lot to go around.

I usually have to cook it 15-20 minutes longer than the recipe calls for, but the length of time it takes to prepare and cook these pork chops is totally worth it.

These are awesome pork chops!  I only made 2, but used all of the sauce and used the extra as gravy on mashed potatoes.  YUM!

Awesome.  End result was a flavorful fork tender chop. It is hard to stay away from the chops after they come out of the frying process because they smell so good.  I forgot to cover my chops for the hour, but, they did not dry out, they remained perfect. Thanks.

These came out great- even picky teens loved them- so moist.  Only change I made was to make a white sauce of  my own instead of using soup to cut way down on sodium.

These are the best pork chops I've ever had!  I had my inlaws over for dinner and my whole family raved about them.  The only change I made to the recipe was I used a can of cream of celery instead of mushroom because my husband doesn't like mushrooms.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly, and they came out perfect.  I will definitely be adding this recipe to my list of nightly dinner choices!

TAKE NOTICE that this recipe is ready in 2 hours before you do like I did and scan to the bottom and see 30 minutes.  I mixed the ingredients before I realized my error and the chops were already browning in the skillet.  Duh, I knew better than not to read the recipe first!  I ended up just dumping everything into the skillet and it took 20 minutes and my husband loved it.  I found it a bit too fatty (fried) but it did have a very good flavor.

This was really good.  I used cream instead of milk, and I increased the wine by 50%.  The chops were very tender and tasty, the sauce was rich and creamy, but the breading remained slightly soggy.  With the pork chops, I served a side dish of fresh green beans with chopped bacon & garlic.

cooking time is way too long...pork nowadays should be taken out at I believe 150 degrees and let to set for 10 minutes to reach 160 degrees. The middle should still be pink. After 45 minutes my pork chops were already 175. they were dry and overcooked. I will try this recipe again but seriously alter the cooking time. There is nothing worse than dry pork chops.

DON'T CHANGE A THING!! Wonderful, wonderful recipe. The sauce was fantastic, and the chops were so tender we cut them with forks. I used really cheap cream of mushroom and I think it made the sauce too runny. So after I put it on I didn't cover it hoping that it would thicken a little. It turned out perfect. I even see ways of making the recipe quicker for busy nights! This recipe will be a main stay at our house. Thanks a lot!!!

My husband said he'd never tasted anything so good!  Even the kids ate it!  I didn't change a thing and the recipe turned out perfectly.  Next time I might double the sauce because it's soooo good.

My family LOVED this and deemed it their favorite recipe of all time. The only change I made was that I doubled the sauce and used fatfree soup. It was yummy, thank you!

I thought this was sensational!  I did not have white wine on hand but it still turned out delicious.  I was short on time so I only baked the chops for 30 minutes before adding the soup and milk and then baked an addt'l 30 minutes.  Great dinner!

These probably would have been better, but I didn't have any flavored bread coutons, so I used potato chips and they didn't have much flavor.  But they fell apart and were very tender.

We used sherry for the white wine and served it over egg noodles with green beans. I used the recipe for four and made 2 pork chops. That gave me extra gravy for the noodles. The only reason this got 4 stars, the pork chops were bland. Next time I will season them better. The noodles were great, my husband wants me to make them for a side dish!!

I made this recipe last night. It was pretty good, however not everyone in my family liked it. With five children, it's very difficult to find a recipe everyone likes. I doubt I'll make it again, it was just good, not fantastic.

Wow!  Delicious!  I made this exactly according to the recipe because I like to give recipes a fair chance when I review them.  Like others, I was skeptical about the length of cooking time.  I am also not a big fan of wine in my food.  But this was absolutely the most delicious pork chop recipe I've ever made. The pork chops were so tender, and the sauce was just delicous.  

The only thing I'd change next time is I might double the sauce, as my whole family just couldn't get enough of it.  We all enjoyed it... it's definitely a keeper!

I tried this out with 5 thin boneless pork chops and after I breaded and sauted them-they looked quite tasty, but the sauce was not very good and they were tough. I tried to lessen the cooking time to 30 minutes w/o sauce and 30 minutes with. It didn't taste like the alcohol cooked out of the wine. Next time, I might try chicken broth in place of the the wine and thicker chops.

THIS WAS A DELICIOUS WAY TO HAVE PORK CHOPS.  I DON'T USUALLY HAVE PORK CHOPS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE TOUGH.  THIS RECIPE PROVIDED VERY TENDER AND SUCCULENT PORK CHOPS.  MAYBE THE LENGTH OF TIME THEY ARE BAKED HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.  THE SAUCE WAS DELICIOUS.  I DID ADD A COUPLE OF TEASPOONS OF SOUR CREAM BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A FLAVOR ENHANCER.  DEFINITELY ON MY LIST OF REPEATS.  A 5 STAR MEAL FOR SURE.  THANKS FOR THE EXPERIENCE.

My 5 year old boy gives these 5 stars too! They have a really good texture and flavour. (I normally fry chops and add a can of soup) but the breaded and baked makes it so much better! If you have the time to bake them.. this is the way to go! Thanks again

Delicious!!!  I only had red wine.  It looked a little strange, but it was still yummy.  I had thin pork chops, so my cooking time was much less.  The only I would maybe change is to make more sauce.  I may try this on chicken.

These were fabulous! We froze the leftovers for lunches. Only downfall was I didn't increase the ingredients for the gravy to accommodate the extra chops -- I was a little leary of making the chops soggy. I won't worry next time I make them, the gravy it too good not to have enough!

Great recipe.  Instead of the garlic powder,I used Mojo Marinade (Badia).  I also used 1 can condensed cream of mushroom and 1 can condensed roasted garlic mushroom soup.

I changed it up a bit.  Since it is just Wifey and me I used two thick bone-in pork chops and omitted the wine at Wifey's request.  We both loved it.  Next time I will use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 3/4 cup of milk since the sauce wasn't enough.  But we both loved it.

Restauran quality.  The white wine added elegance to plain ol' pork chops.  Served it with the garlic mashed potatoes from this site, broccoli, and dessert was the Better than sex cake from this site.  Everyone kissed the cook!

Pork was very tender and the sauce was wonderful. If my husband liked mushrooms I would have added some. Great over rice!

This was delicious!  I don't even really like pork, but this was great.  The mushroom really enhanced the taste. I made this dish with steamed cauliflower instead of potatoes and it was a hit.  Great home-cooking!

I used 4 large 3/4" thick Pork Loin Chops boneless and marinated them for 4 hours in Italian Dressing.  I then breaded and fried the chops as directed.  I doubled the gravy recipe and substituted the cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken & mushroom soup.  Also used chicken broth instead of wine.  My hubby and 10 year old daughter LOVED it. Served with country hashbrown potatoes and green beans.  Very tender!!! Yum!!

We thought we knew how to make good porkchops until we tried these.  Now we'll never make them any other way!  The meat just falls right off the bone.  We didn't have any white whine so I omitted it and they still turned out great.

For the total time involved, I wasn't impressed.  It needed lots of salt and pepper after baking, in addition to all of the seasonings added during prep.  I made extra sauce to put over the rice, which also needed lots of salt and pepper.  I won't make this again.

Skipped the breading - just did egg & flour.  After adding the soup/milk/wine, I also sprinkled about a half a packet of onion soup mix because I wasn't sure if there'd be enough seasoning for our tastes.  At the same time the chops went in the oven, another dish of cut up taters, baby carrots, some onion/garlic and seasonings went in ... and we went outside to play.  There's really no excuse for not cooking at home when you have recipes like this on hand - big thumbs up from everyone.

Wonderful!  I took 1 star of because my husband hated it for some reason, but everyone else who'd tried it loves it.  Did not change a thing, except I didn't use as many pork chops so that there would be more 'gravy.'

This was a very tasty way to do pork chops.  I used cream of celery, and added some sliced potatoes, carrots and a little onion, since I only had two pork chops to cook and didn't want to waste the sauce.  This worked really well, and turned it into a one dish meal instead of just the meat.  I cooked it for about 20 minutes without the sauce, then for about an hour after adding the sauce.  I also sprinkled some onion soup mix over the whole thing.  I think it is possible that others who found the meat slightly tough cooked it too little, rather than too long - I checked mine after 30 minutes with the sauce and found that the chops were not yet fork tender - after another thirty minutes they were perfect.  If you cook pork chops with sauce in a covered dish, they are not going to toughen with longer cooking - if anything, they will get too mushy.  Although I did add some extra ingredients, I really did not change the basic recipe, and we enjoyed it very much - thanks!

Very good.  Much better to do this way than just throw plain chops in and cover with soup.  I like the breading idea.  The cooking time is a little long, in my opinion.  I only cooked mine 30 minutes without the sauce, 30 minutes with...for a total of an hour, not an hour and a half.  My chops would have been extremely overcooked with an additional half hour of cooking.  Also, we don't drink, and I rarely buy wine just for cooking, so I used a little chicken broth to compensate.  Wonderful sauce, moist chops, great dinner.

First got the recipe from a friend who found in on this site.  It was really delicious.  I then made it for my dinner guests, who also thought it was a tasty dish.  I did use two cans of mushroom soup in order to have some gravy for the masked potatoes.

I always enjoy this recipe when I want "comfort food". I find that frying the chops with the breading, and then baking with the soup mixture gives them an excellent flavor as opposed to just throwing them in the oven without frying first. Serve over white rice and you've got a great meal!

Really enjoyed this dish.  Very tasty and  smelled incredible while baking.  Added three large cloves of garlic (minced) and a container of sliced mushrooms to the mushroom wine sauce.    Definately did the trick.  The breading did turn mushy.  Will probably skip it next time.  Only needed to bake a total of 1 hour (40/20).  Very, very good!

This was yummy, but it did not take an hour and a half to cook - I used boneless thin sliced pork chops, and it took about 30-40 minutes in the oven after browning in the pan.  Good, yummy comfort food!

I thought this lacked flavor. Also I did not like that the breading came off in the sauce while it was baking. I will not make this again.

I wasn't impressed with the looks of the ingredients, but I had to try it because it got so many great reviews.  Boy am I glad I did!  Not only was this really easy to make, but everyone loved it!  I've never had pork chops come out so tender. I only use 3 or 4 pork chops so that each one has plenty of sauce, which is also good over vegetables.

These were very good and will make them again.  I only baked an hour total and used cooking wine and didn't think the wine was overpowering at all.  Followed directions exactly except for the cooking time.

This recipe has been given a thumbs up by my family to make again.  I used 2" chops and they were so tender, I wanted extra gravy for potatoes so i doubled the wine and soup and it was very good.  I dont feel that the wine over powered it.  but I used a cooking wine instead of a drinking wine.  I will be sure to pass this recipe on to friends to try. Thank you.

This was really good!  I served with mashed potatoes and wanted extra gravy so I used two cans of cream of mushroom.  I did not double the wine because some of the other posters thought it was too intense.  Came out perfect.  I gave the leftovers to my mom and she couldn't stop raving about them!  Definitely a keeper.

I found this recipe today and cooked it tonight. Simple and delicious. I cooked it for the whole 1 hour and 30 min. Perfect. I had very thick chops. My grown son stopped in unexpectedly and had dinner too. Said they were the best chops I've made!!!

I made this exactly as printed except I decreased the cooking time to an hour total. I think anymore would have been too much. It was very good, I just wish it had a tad more flavor.

This is one of those comfort food recipes - very good served with rice. Next time I'll add some fresh mushrooms just for a little added flavor and texture. We would make this one again.

I made these for supper tonight and didn't get a high mark! They were good, but not the best. The gravy made the coating on the chops very soggy. My daughter wouldn't even eat them! I probally wouldn't make this again! Sorry but thanks for the post!

I was looking for a quick, easy, and delicious recipe and I sure found one! I made this for my boyfriend tonight and he said it's a definite keeper.

This recipe was super easy and super delish! It took about 15-20 minutes to prepare. I followed previous advice and only cooked the chops for an hour--they probably could have been taken out at 45 min. (I had extremely thick chops too!) I also only cooked 4 chops but followed the recipe for 6 servings. I had a lot of extra yummy sauce.

I highly recommend this recipe if you like pork chops!

We love this recipe.  THe first time I did not use any wine, the second time I used half wine, half chicken broth and about a tablespoon of sherry.   I think next time I will skip the breadcrumbs.  Also reduced the initial cooking time to 45 before the sauce goes on.  Amazing how tender the chops are!  This will be a regular in our house...we LOVE the sauce!

This was such a winner! Even my husband liked it and he hates Pork Chops. A few changes I made: I skipped the bread crumbs and white wine. I left them out completely. I threw in some shitake mushrooms for texture and used Campbells Roasted Mushroom and Garlic soup (which made the gravy more brown than beige) and sprinkled with chopped parsely before serving for some much needed color. Otherwise, everyone loved it. Like another reviewer's recommendation, even though I used THICK chops, I baked for 30 minutes, poured in the soup, and then baked another 30 minutes for a total cook time of 1 hour. It think 1.5 hours would have been too much. These stayed very nice and moist.

I was raised a vegetarian and I have never cooked or even eaten pork chops before.  My husband has been asking me to make some for quite some time so I finally decided to give it a try.  This recipe was so simple and tasty.  My husband gave it an A+ and said they were the best pork chops he has ever had!  I would recommend following the recipe precisely with the exception of cutting down on the cooking time in the oven.  Our "large" pork chops were done in just 45 minutes - if I had cooked them any longer they would have been dry.  A hour a half in the oven seems way too long.

Agree with the majority.  Extremely tender. A company rave..added fresh mushrooms to sauce, and fresh basil from my garden.  A definite keeper!

I have made these pork chops numerous times and is definately a keeper in my house!  The most tender pork chops I have ever tasted!  The only thing I have changed, is that I only add half of the white wine that is called for.  The full amt. of white wine is just a little too empowering for my taste.  I would give this more than 5 stars if I could!!

These came out very tender. Did not flour the chops, but that didn't seem to matter as to the outcome. Usually I'm not a 'canned soup recipe' person, as it always seems to taste like soup 'gravy'.I added different seasoning to the chops and bread crumbs..I think you could experiment with that. It was a relatively quick recipe though.

Delicious! This was the first time I've made something that reminded me of (and was as good as) my mom's home cooking... Unfortunately a bit high in fat and calories so I won't make it often... But, definitely worth making every now and then.

This was a really great dish. I used only 4 pork chops but I made it by the 6 servings ingredients. It gave more gravy to put on whatever side you choose to use. I used chicken broth instead of wine and I cooked it the first time for 40min then after I poured the mix on it i cooked it for 30min. PERFECT!!!

This has become a family favorite.  I have made it with both white wine and sparkling wine and they both come out tender, juicy and delicious.  Wonderful with mashed potatoes.

Everyone loved this!  I was cooking for a large group so I doubled the meat portion (12 chops) and quadrupled the gravy ingredients which ended up being 2 cans of cream of mushroom w/ garlic, 1 can regular cream of mushroom, and 1 can of cream of chicken & mushroom (that's what I had on hand).  I seasoned the 1/2" boneless chops with Natures Seasoning and garlic pepper and reduced the cook time to 45 minutes.  It was a huge hit!

Excellent pork chop recipe!  I never make pork, but bought some chops earlier this week and figured it was time to try out some recipes.  My only criticism of this recipe was that my pork chops didn't come out as moist as described by all the other posts.  I also made a few changes; I omitted the seasoning salt (didn't have it, wasn't an issue), used cream of chicken (again, didn't have cream of mushroom) and added a can of green beans.  Even with the adjustments, it was still delicious!  My boyfriend was totally wowed and must have said "this is very good" about four times during dinner.  I will make this again!

yum.  Between cook and prep it was almost two hours and I work so I cooked them the one hour the night before, put them in the fridge, then put them back in the oven the next night w/the sauce for the other half hour.  Daaa   lish.  Kids loved them, served w/white rice and green beans!  This one is a keeper.

This was a very good dish.  I used the thick boneless chops and they still were moist and tender.  I'm so happy to be able to come to this site for new and inventive ways to make the things my family likes to eat.  I haven't had a bad dish yet and I've made quite a few!
Thank you

I was excited about this recipe because of the reviews.  The sauce was wonderful but my chops did not come out tender.  I used the thick chops...I will try again with thinner chops.  (I may try this recipe with chicken breasts.)

This was good but "Pork Chops and Scalloped POtatoes" by Monica was just as good and less work.  If you make the about mentioned recipe reverse the cooking of the potatoes & pork. Pork on bottom and sliced potatoes on top.

Made as written except used cream of onion instead of cream of mushroom.  Easy to make and the pork turned out fork tender.  I loved them; didn't get raves from husband, but he did comment on how moist they were.  Served with rice and veggies.  Only used 2 chops so had plenty of sauce left over for the rice.  Will make again.

Pretty tasty... I used lowfat cream of mushroom soup and added sliced mushrooms and a lot of garlic powder to the sauce, and I thought it was pretty flavorful.  I think I used too thick of meat, though... not quite as tender as I had hoped.  Next time, I'll try pounding it out so it's a little thinner.

Wonderful recipe. With 4 chops, inch and a half thick, this worked wonderfully.

The meat was nearly falling off the bones. I added 1/2 cup more milk and didn't use white wine. 

"Best pork chops yet" said the wife.

I added sauteed onions, mushrooms and extra seasoning to enhance the taste of sauce.  The chops were fork tender, similar to a beef roast that has been baked for an extended period of time.  While the flavor was good, it was not extraordinary, just your basic weeknight meal.

I have made this recipe so many times...but since it is summer I decided to try making it in the crock pot. It worked great! While preparing the pork chops I made a double recipe of the sauce and had it precooking in the crock pot. I then fried the pork chops and placed them in the crock pot for about 1.5 hours. Perfection! I am going to make them this way every time. Neither me or my husband noticed any difference in flavor.

I was really disapointed.  I followed the recipe only adding mushrooms and onion for more flavor ...and it was still flavorLESS.  The pork was very tough and the flour crumb coating slothed off in the oven making gooie mush balls in the sauce. Sorry wont make this agian.

Just OK.  Nothing outstanding in my opinion.  I used boneless pork chops that were a little thick, which could have been the problem.  They were a little on the dry side.  Probably won't make again.

I have made these several times using apple juice instead on the wine as one user suggested. Everytime they are a hit. I constantly get asked for the recipe. A little time consuming but well worth it.

Fantastic, even my picky non veggie liker husbands asks for them.  I use thick costco porkchops, once they have baked for the first hour I use the all the juice in the pan to make gravy for an alternate dinner idea.  Also be careful with the seasoned salt, pork is salty on it's own!

Full of flavor and yes, the aroma while these are frying is awesome.  I used good sized bone-in chops and cooked them probably 40 min. total and they were perfect.  I didnt have white wine either..still tasted great!  We all loved the recipe.  I will make this again.

I made this dish last night, and my husband loved it. It is a dish that I will make again. It was easy and pretty quick, and I didnt mind the cooking time. I had it was Au Gratin  and cresent rolls and was to die for. Every bite was wonderful.

I thought this recipe was nothing special, it was just ok. My husband on the other hand liked it a lot. So, for him I will make it again. I did saute fresh mushrooms and chopped onion and added it to the soup mixture. Then I put it in the slow cooker on low for six hours after I fried each one like the recipe said to. The pork chops came out very tender which I love but lacked flavor.

We had this for dinner last night and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't as wonderful as we hoped based on all the five-star ratings.  After reading the negative ratings, I think the problem might actually have been that folks used thick chops. Ours were bone-in center cut (not thick) and they were very tender and plenty moist.  My reason for the three-star rating is that I just didn't care for the flavor of the sauce.  Maybe too much wine, too much cream-of-mushroom -- the smell of the breaded chops frying was heavenly, but all you could taste was the cream stuff when it was all done.

The only reason this wasn't 5 stars was because the breading fell off the bottom of our chops (this could be my fault since I only cooked them in the oven for 15 minutes before adding the liquid -- but I didn't want the boneless chops to dry out).  I sauteed canned mushrooms and chopped onion and added them to the liquids.  Delicious!

Very tasty pork chops and tender too! Next time I think I will opt for a different wine though.  I used Yellow Tail chardonnay and it was a bit too sweet. Thanks a bunch!

9/5/11 still as yummy as ever. used cream of chicken soup this time instead of cream of mushroom...my kids have decided they don't like mushrooms.  Came out just as great.  Not an original idea though...another reviewer suggested.


I made very close to what the recipe called for...except I only needed 1 cup of the bread crumbs.  They were delicious!  I also add some fresh mushroom slices as recommended and this was nice. 9/22/09 made this again and it just so good. great comfort food.

Great dish. Perfect for a relaxed dinner on a cold winter night. Warms your tummy and fills you up. You could lighten it up by using egg substitute, and reduced fat soup.

This was AWESOME! The chops were sooooo tender we didn't even need knives! The coating stayed on nicely. Flavor was wonderful. The sauce it makes was wonderful! This is the best pork chop recipe I've ever tried. Thanks a million for posting! Do try it with the white wine, the flavor is perfect. Not too overwhelmingly winey.

Recipe was great--even for my collegian who doesn't like pork.  It is messy to prepare.  Will put it in my recipe box.

My whole family loved this recipe.  It's perfect to prepare ahead of time too.  I seared it in the morning and then put in the refrigerator till it was ready to bake.

These were great! Doubled the sauce because I had pork chops that were so thick (1 1/2")! Turned out great but next time it might be nice to soak the chops in brine as specified in the "How To Grill" book. They were a little less juicy than I would like. I left the chops in a little longer because they were so thick but I think I could have pulled them at 1:30 and they may have been juicier. Be careful with the seasoning salt!

Eh, it was ok.  It just tasted like cream of mushroom soup spooned over breaded pork chops.  They were tender, but flavorless and boring.  Not bad; but certianly not worthy of the five star rating.  To me, this meal tastes 'lazy', but takes entirely too long to prepare.

I really don't understand why this got so many stars! I did everything exactly right, and it was pretty gross. My husband told me it was good just because I cooked it, but I could tell my him pushing it around on his plate he didnt like it either. It tasted too mushroomy!

My family doesn't like things cooked with mushrooms or wine.  However, this is the best method I've ever found to bread chops.  I bake for a 1/2 hour covered, then cover with a brown gravy and bake another 1/2 hour.  So tender you can cut it with a fork!

This recipe came out just as I had expected; GREAT. Even my 13-month old couldn't get enough of it! I used plain bread crumbs instead of Italian-style and it still came out very flavorful.

This is an excellent recipe! I did make a couple of changes! I used plain breadcrumbs and only needed 1 cup for 7 boneless chops.I also needed only 1 egg mixed with a little water to make an egg wash. I didn't have any wine so I just used 1 cup of 1% milk with the soup. I poured the soup mixture over the chops right after browning and covered with foil and baked 1 hr. They were fork tender and fabulous.My 14 yr old loved it and so did my husband...there was nothing left! I may add more soup and milk next time for even more sauce.We had it with buttered, boiled potatoes and green peas. It was great!

Simply the best! I have never had pork chops that tasted so good. I omit the wine, use a large can of cream of mushroom soup and increase the milk to make lots of yummy gravy for the rice. If you havent tried this recipe, you havent had the best pork chops in the world!
Thanks for the great recipe Dawn!

It's a great recipe!  You need to add pepper to taste to the sauce.  I used Kendall Jackson's Chardonnay for the white wine and it gave it a slightly sweet taste that I didn't care for.  Next time I make it, I'll try a very dry white wine.  I also only cooked it about 45 minutes.  It was so soft, my son in law cut his with his fork!

Our favorite..However I simplify it. I coat and brown the pork chops as suggested. Then place in baking dish and cover with the sauce. I then cover and cook for about an hour.

VERY VERY GOOD!  I didn't change any of the ingredients except I used a glove of garlic in place of rubbing the chops with garlic powder.  I am going to try this recipe with venison chops next time. I think it will be just as good...thanks for a great recipe.

I absolutely love this recipe. Time consuming, yes, but it is well worth the time. I tweaked the recipe a bit using a cut of pork that has more fat marbling in it plus added garlic powder in the flour mixture. Very yummy, my family loves this!

These were so good!! The meat came out sooo tender! I didn't bake them for an hour and a half though (and they were pretty thick, about 3/4 inch or so) I baked them for about 30-35 minutes then added the sauce and cooked for another 30 minutes and they came out perfect. I forget to season the chops with the garlic powder and salt so I just mixed it in with the sauce and it was wonderful! Very nice flavor.

This was good, not as tender as I hoped. I subsituted apple juice for the white wine as well. My 3 year old ate all of hers, she loved it too.

Great recipe!  We left the recipe the same except we only used 4 pork chops and they were probably a lot skinnier than we were supposed to (the cheap chops were on sale).  Thus cooking time was cut down significantly.  Was very good!  Will make again!

After looking through both good and bad reviews, I cooked my pork chops on the stove until they were done and then poured the sauce over it and baked it for 20 mins.  It turned out yummy although I would do a bit of less wine next time.  My children loved it and had second helpings.

This recipe is okay.  I gave 4 stars because family didn't really like the gravy the soup mixture made.  They said it would have been better with a crunchy outside.

Excellent!  I used thick boneless cutlets, my butcher calls them pork fingers, and cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic. (Omitted the garlic powder). No knife needed, it came out so tender and flavorful.  Served with white rice and Snappy Green Beans for a great dinner.

Husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  Very moist and good over rice.  Was not quick and easy, though, but worth the time and effort.  Only alterations I made were to add parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs and canned mushrooms to the soup.  Didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I added Italian seasonings to the plain ones I had on hand.  Will make this again.

Delicious and worth the wait! Everyone loved it, and leftovers were delicious too. Pork chops were moist and tender. My son is not big on gravy, but he loved this one! I replaced white wine with vinegar and milk with soy milk. Not because I wanted to, we just didn't have any milk or white wine on hand. Very messy to make though. I will make this again, but it would have to be on special occasions or weekends. There's just never enough time!

WONDERFUL!!! Even my 12 and 6 yrs old asked when can we have it again.  I used apple juice like other reviews suggested.  The only thing I would do is double the sauce(gravy), it is excellent on rice.

I didn't find this recipe difficult to cook, I just didn't like the taste of it.  My husband and daughter didn't like it either.  My husband loves mushrooms, it surprised me that he didn't like the gravy.  I wouldn't make it again.

I cannot even find words to describe how phenominal these pork chops are.  Talk about comfort food!  I made it exactly as the recipe outlined and my family loved it. My 6 year old didnt like the sauce, but i think next time i will just avoid pouring the sauce over one of the chops during the baking process.  I served it with mashed potatoes and brocolli. Soooo yummy!

Very good.... The only thing I did different was add some minced garlic.  The result was very good and tender pork chops.  I also would suggest you brown them long enough so they do not get mushy.  Served over a white rice.  Thanks Dawn

I got great reviews on the tenderness of the pork. Flavor I was told was also great. (I am a vegetarian, so I didn't try it.) Preparation was simple, only slightly time consuming. This recipe will surely go in my recipe box.

I added some extra garlic powder & a little cayenne to bread crumb mixture and garlic powder to the mushroom soup, as well as the sauteed fresh mushrooms & onions. I used cooking sherry, since I had no wine in the house.
It was GREAT! Lots of flavor & fork tender!

Wow Wow Wow! This was easy and great tasting! My husband said these were better than his mother's! I used thin sliced pork chops, so I decreased the baking time by 15 minutes each cycle, and put in a little more wine. Will make these again...and again...and again...

This was such a fantastic recipe.  It was very easy and absolutely delish.  I made a couple of very small changes because I wanted to use what I had in the house so I used Basia Complete Seasoning instead of the garlic powder and seasoning salt (basically the same thing) and I used a cup of chicken broth instead of the white wine then I through in some fresh mushrooms and it turned out absolutely wonderful.  We will definitely make this again.

The chops tasted pretty good, but the texture wasn't too pleasing. They turned out to be too dry, and the bread crumbs were kinda hard. I made some changes to the mushroom sauce, and it turned out well. I added more skimmed milk to water it down a bit and some sauteed, diced mushrooms and onions. I kept the extra sauce and put it on the side of the plate.

I am surprised this recipe received low reviews. It was a HUGE hit in my house. I did adjust the baking time due to the size and thickness of my pork chops. This is a keeper.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Next time I will add a bit more white wine, because I like the flavor of the wine mixed with the cream of mushroom.  Takes awhile to cook, so plan in advance for this.

Recipe was super!  Chops were tender and tasted really great.  I did add onions and a little more wine than requested.  Husband and children asked me to make again soon.

Very moist! My pork chops were thin so I only cooked for 30 min. without sauce, then 30 min. with sauce. Added onions and mushrooms as suggested by other reviewers. I might just brown pork chops next time without the breading since it just gets soggy once you put sauce on.

This recipe was really yummy, even though I shortened the cooking time.  I poured the sauce over them and baked them for just one hour.  I was still delicious!

Chops came out nice and tender, I used boneless center-cut, so I cut the cooking time about 30 minutes. Think this would work well with chicken also.

These pork chops were somewhat of a disappointment. They were not at all moist. I think cutting back on the cooking time is key here. I used bone in chops that were quite thick. Not sure if that was a problem. Probably will not use this again.

This was very easy to make, but a little bit bland for our taste. I reduced the fry time to about 3 minutes a side (just until golden brown), and the first hour of baking I reduced to 45 minutes, and still found them to be just a little bit dry (I was using boneless chops). I liked the flavor the wine lent to the sauce (to me the only real flavor in the dish), but my husband didn't like the wine gravy. I would make again, but would use lots more seasonings (mostly pepper, garlic, and something spicy), and maybe some mushrooms and onions.

As these were baking the wonderful smell made my mouth water.  They were so tender and easy to make!  I had no wine but chicken broth substituted fine.  I cooked about 45 minutes and then added the  soup mixture and baked the additional 30 minutes.  GREAT home style meal your family will love........

This recipe was ausome. My whole family loved it. I didn't have white wine or cream of mushroom so i expriemented a little bit, mostly sticking to the main recipe. I added fresh mushrooms and some onions with milk and cream of chicken, and it was excellant. This recipe is by far the best pork chops that my family and I have ever had. :-D

I feel bad rating this recipe with only two stars being that almost everyone else on the site loved it. But our family just didn't like it.  I guess it was the gravy.  The chops were good and moist but the gravy was just not what we were expecting.  I made it with extra thick chops that we couldn't finish but no one seemed to want any leftovers.

This was absolutely fabulous.  The pork chops were moist and very flavorful!  I served them over white rice and it all just melted in your mouth.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is wonderful! I think the wine adds a little zip to the flavor. My family loved it! This is now one of my favorite ways to eat pork chops, I will definitely be making this again.

This was OK. The chops were incredibly tender. But I wish that I had skipped the breading and just did the mushroom soup. Not bad, but not my favorite.

very tasty. Next time I might double the soup-wine-milk sauce mix to add some extra sauce when serving over rice. My two & three year olds loved it also.

Something odd happened when I made this recipe. Right out of the oven, these pork chops were just excellent!  Rave reviews. The next day, reheated, the flavor completely, mysteriously disappeared. We could have been eating tofu covered with white gravy.  I would suggest eating right away, and don't be afraid to season heavily. The wine was a nice touch.

30-35 minutes for the pork chops to cook before adding the mushroom sauce seemed to be long enough.  I added fresh, sliced mushrooms mixed in with the sauce and baked another 30 minutes. This is not my favorite pork chop recipe on this site but we did enjoy these.

Delish...but I overcooked the pork slightly so they wre a little dry.  I used pork loins rather than chops.  The mushroom sauce was very good though.  My boyfriend hates mushrooms, but he gobbled it all up with a smile.  A definite treat for the tastebuds.

This was a real hit with my husband who seemed a little disappointed at first that I was baking the pork chops rather than frying them like I usually do. But he really loved these, coming back for seconds and mentioning that I could make these again.

These pork chops are delicious! Even my very picky husband ate two of them. I only had skim milk and no white wine, so I used Japanese Mirin. What the heck! I figured I couldn't mess these chops up and they came out very tender and delicious.

Neither my husband nor I care for pork chops and I have tried to cook them many different ways. From now on I will only cook them like this! They were moist and flavorful and the gravy was wonderful. I did cut back on the wine just a little and I doubled the gravy ingrediants. Served with fried potatoes and fresh green beans. It was a wonderfully comforting meal. Thank you very much for changing my opinion of pork chops.

I wasn't fond of these chops.  They were a bit to heavy for our liking.  I guess I can't beat "shake and bake".  They always turn out tender and juicy.

Very tasty recipe!  A bit messy to make, though.  I ended up using two cans of low sodium mushroom soup, freshly sliced mushrooms, and we used Gewurztraminer wine.  I also used Emeril's Essence on the pork chops before breading them.  Grandma thought it was one of the best pork chops she had ever eaten and loved the fact that there were really tender.

Delicious! I used only 3 pork chops but made the full amount of sauce.  I subbed cream of celery for the cream of mushroom and also used chicken broth instead of wine.  Very good and we were glad to have the extra gravy to go on mashed potatoes. My husband can be a bit picky about the way I prepare pork chops so I was delighted when he said these were delicious.  I will make this again. Thanks :)

A very tasty dish, although my pork chops did not come out as tender as i thought they would have, according to the other reviews.  but, it wasn't all that tough or anything, and the taste really made up for it.  made it for my family and it was well liked! served it with some rotini pasta and steamed brocolli/carrots.. also sauteed some garlic/onion/mushroom and added it on with the soup mixture the second baking time, added lemon and pepper, added more wine, and baked for 30 min. the first time instead of 1 hour. my family wants me to make again several more times!

This is one of my favorite recipes, and we have been making it for years. I do use boneless chops on most occasions-and the cooking time is decreased to 45-30 when I do. I don't even like wine to drink-but in this dish it is marvelous!

These were very good and easy to make. I cooked them exactly as the recipe called for and there were soo tender. The pork chops just fell apart. I thought the breading would be crunchy.. but it wasn't, but everything else was great. Will make many more times. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious recipe.  I cooked the pork chops for approx. 20 minutes as well.  I did add the fresh lemon juice, sour cream and pepper to the sauce portion and it was quite tasty.  I did add mushrooms and onions to the top but will sauteeing the onions first before adding them to the top.  They missed that certain flavour plus didn't cook fast enough so were still a bit sharp for my kids.

These are wonderful! I am very well known for making dry pork chops... "Desert chops" as my husband calls them because you need a gallon of water to swallow them. When I served these, he said "hey they are not dry! These are wonderful!" My daughter loved them also.... these are definetely a keeper. Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

Best and most tender pork chops I've ever eaten.
I did however slow the cooking temp down and extend the time.  They were awesome.

This is a very good recipe.  I am only giving it 4 stars because not everyone in my family liked it.  We all liked the flavor, but my son doesn't like pork chops.  So I'm saving my 5 star ratings for whenever I find a pork chop recipe he likes.

I made this and I thought it was pretty good.  I do think the baking time was WAY TOO LONG.  Pork can dry out fast.  I poked the chops several times with a fork and put some broth in the bottom of the pan just because every time I make pork it turns out dry.  But this worked good.  I think frying it in the oil helps with the moistness too as does the wine. I used white cooking wine.  Something about the wine that makes meat more moist.  The breading got a little soggy with all the stuff on top which was kinda gross but overall a good find. Thanks!

I love the coating, If I ever have veal on hand I will use this coating recipe. I didn't have the mushroom soup so I used pork gravy in place of it. Husband really liked it. For once I had Tender Pork Chops!!

I was looking for a pork chop recipe last minute and this one had high marks and I had all the ingredients on hand. What luck!! These were some of the best pork chops I have ever had! My husband loved them!! Heads up for parents of small children, My 1 year old liked them but I couldn't get the 4 and 6 year old to try. Definitely worth making!

Tasty, but definately not quick!  I substituted apple juice for the wine and served over rice.  This made a nice one-dish meal.  Will cook again, but will spice it up a bit as it tasted a little bland.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did everything according to the recipe except I added parmesan cheese to the white wine mixture and it turned out to be pretty good.  I wasn't sure at first, but after a few bites, I was pleased.  My husband is afraid to try new things and my son is at the picky stage - they both loved it.  Next time I will use cream of celery soup because I think it compliments the white wine better.  A little too salty - not sure why, but it was still good.

This recipe was okay, but to my way of thinking, was not really remarkable.  If I make it again, I will add some spices to give it some zip.  The pork did turn out very tender.

This was very good, but I wouldn't call it quick and easy.  It takes a lot of prep and cook time.  I skipped the flour but did everything else as written.  I liked the taste with the wine, but it could also be omitted if one prefers.

This was really good and the pork chops were tender.  I didn't have any wine so left that out.  I might use cream of celery next time just cause we like that soup better than cream of mushroom.  I served this over brown rice and thought all in all it was easy to prepare and really great!

What a great recipe!  I can't believe how tender and moist the pork chops came out.  I added some sauted mushrooms to the pork chops when I added the sauce.  My husband couldn't say enough about these.

Excellent recipe.  I chopped up my chops (heh) and ommitted the white wine because it was just my 3-year-old daughter and I, but the dish turned out really well.  I might have preferred it a bit crunchier and less sauce, or at least the sauce on the side w/ pasta, but that will be remedied next time.  Which I guarantee there will be.

Delicious! I believe that one of the things that makes this so good is to really get the chops good and golden brown when frying. I didn't have white wine so I used a good sherry. I also doubled the sauce recipe and served it all over rice. It was wonderful! Thanks, Dawn.

Excellent!  Like all pork chops, these take a while to bake, but the results are wonderful.  Both my husband and my 5-year-old asked for seconds!

I was expecting better after all the hype.  It was ok, but I won't be making it again because it isn't really worth all of the trouble.

I'm not sure what happened-  The sauce and the breading were delicious, but the meat never became tender.  I cut down the cooking time like so many reviewers suggested, and if I had it to do over, I would cook it longer- like the original recipe says.  Flavor was good but texture was not-  I probably won't be making this again.

These were above average pork chops but I guess I was expecting a little more after reading all of the reviews.  Overall they were good and I would make them again.

My husband bought a pig and I was running out of ways to fix pork. Until I found this recipe and now it is fixed often. My three daughters and myself make this recipe at least two times a month. They each have their job and in a snap the chops are in the oven. I serve this dish with Angel Biscuits II. To finish off the dinner, I make the Kentucky Butter Cake. Great combo!  Enjoy!!

This was verrrry good.  My husband and 7-year old relly enjoyed, along with me.   The porkchops were very tender.  Will definitely make again.  I did find two cups of bread crumbs quite a bit too much and had to waste what was left in my bowl, and will adjust next time.  Thanks for recipe.

My husband raved about these, although, I found them to be just okay.  Maybe it was because I cooked them.  I enjoy food much more whenever I don't cook it.  I will make again because hubby really like them.

This was sooooooooooo good and flavorful.  I cannot believe how moist the chops stayed.  They were so tender and delicious.  I too only cooked them for 30/30 per previous suggestions.  We will definitely make again!!!  Thank you!!

An Excellent meal. My wife raved about this "Sunday Dinner."  I would like to thank AMARTIN24 on the review they provided, I followed their addition, except for the cayenne. (I didn't have any and used chili powder). This recipe is certainly a keeper.

P.s. I served this meal with Mashed Potatoes and Kernel Corn.

Excellent dish and I will be making again. I substitute a homemade mushroom soup mix often as I often don't have this on hand. Handful of Mushrooms,  2 TB of cornstarch, 8oz, evaporated milk and seasonings of your choice.

Very good recipe. I also cut cooking time to one hour. I used cream of chicken soup (didn't have mushroom), and added a can of mushrooms. Gravy was great over mashed potatoes.

Wonderful, tender pork chops!  I didn't have any leftovers!  I used boneless chops and substituted some chicken broth for the white wine (didn't have any wine in the house).  Will definately make these again.

YUMMMMMM - thank you so much Dawn ~ this recipe is truly wonderful!  My husband is a hunter and he brought home a wild pig and I thought I'd never use the backstrap - but this recipe was PERFECT for it ~ made it so tender and succulent!  My hubby never likes new recipes and he LOVED this ~ I was so proud :)

A few extra steps to the way I always made breaded pork chops turned out to be a real hit. The mushroom sauce is excellent.  I added a small can of drained mushrooms for extra appearance and taste.  After 35 years I now have a much better recipe.  Thanks!

These were good.  Meat was tender.  Even tender after being reheated the next day.  Very good served over rice.

Wonderful pork recipe!  Easy and very yummy...have served it many times and gotten many compliments.  Even mushroom haters think it tastes so good that they don't even notice the mushroom bits!  So good and comforting!!

Change it a bit. Sauted onion and garlic before browning chops. Didn't have bread crumbs used stuffing mix per previous review. Added a bit of cayenne. Baked 30 min/30 min. Tender,juicy, gravy so rich. Thanks Dawn this is a definite keeper.

These pork chops were the best I've ever had.  I never cared for pork chops too much but my husband really likes them so I decided to try this recipe.  They turned out juicy, tender and very flavorful!  I'll definately be using this recipe from now on!!!

Really good! We didn't have white wine, so we just made the sauce without it, and it was still good. Definitely not something you can have a lot of, because it's so creamy. We got a not very good cut of pork but it turned out extremely tender. We'll make this again.

Good, but not fabulous. My pork chops were very thick. Even after cooking they were still a little tough. I put the whole thing in the crockpot for several more hours to soften up. It really made better leftovers. My picky eater son even ate them.

I did not think this was spectacular. I thought the gravy was bland, and I had even added salt, garlic salt, and caramelized onions to it. My boyfriend, however, could not stop raving about it. I think I will make this again, but with chicken breasts. I kept biting into pieces of fat hidden by the coating! Blecchh!

this is a good, relatively ez dinner.  i thought cooking the chops for 1 and 1/2 hours would be excessive so i poured the sauce on top of the browned chops (i omitted the wine) and baked the whole thing for 50 minutes.  it came out great served on top of rice,  but not exactly the kind of thing i'd serve to guests.

Fork tender chops. Everyone loved these. I used crushed cracker crumbs instead of the herb bread crumbs because I did not have any in stock. These were so easy and turned out very well. I will be making these again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was a big hit with the family.  Seconds were served and the little one ate the whole pork chop.

These pork chops were so tender, we could cut them with a fork!  And had a wonderful, rich flavor!  Definitely a keeper!!!

my husband loved these and gave it 5 stars, i gave it 4 because they were a lot of trouble to make and took a long time to cook.  i thought they tasted very good though.

I'm not picky at all, but this seemed a little rich to me.  I think if I make it again, I'll use fresh mushrooms and more milk.  The breading was really tasty, though...

Great recipe!!!  I made the dish two nights ago just to see how it would turn out.  My girlfriend, who never eats anything I cook, feasted on the chops for three days in a row!  I will definitely add this recipe to my permanent collection.

Super moist...I used red wine instead of white and it was too overpowering. White wine would have been perfect.

Very good.  Takes a lot of cooking time, but the results are worth it.  The pork is tender and juicy and tasty.  I added sauteed onions and portabella mushrooms to the sauce and substituted chicken broth for the wine as I had none in the house.  Still wonderful, hubby approved and he is not big on pork chops!!

Preparation was easy, and the wait during cook time was definitely worth it.  I put knives on the table, but no one used them.  The sauce was great on my mashed potatoes!  My husband said he would hardly consider grilling or BBQ'ing chops ever again so they must be great!

These made the best pork chops that this cook has ever been able to do.  Usually my pork chops come out rubbery or like a piece of cardboard.  These were so tender that we cut them with our knife.  The kids loved them, hubby loved them and I loved them!

This is the BEST! The chops were so tender.  I didn't have cream of mushroom, so I used cream of chicken herb dijon.  Delicious.  Also, I didn't use the full amount of white wine called for.
Love this recipe.

I used red wine instead of white, as it was all I had.  The recipe was pretty good.  I'd make it again with the white wine, rather than red though.

Delicious.   I have made this several times and often will substitute cream of celery soup and it turns out just as good.   Kids enjoyed it as well.

My husband liked these, though I thought they were a bit on the bland side.  I added mushrooms to the soup mixture and I doubled the soup mixture so we could have the gravy over white rice.  I think next time I'll saute the mushrooms before adding them and season the chops more.  The sauce was good, but the pork chops weren't as good as I expected.  But I'll try again.

Great recipe, my whole family loved it (even me, I'm not a big fan of pork!).  A bit salty however, would put on just garlic and no salt next time as the mushroom soup provides enough salt.

Loved this recipe, but I did not find it especially quick as stated in the submitter.  All that prep work with the chops slowed me down.  Regardless, I will be making this again!

I thought this meal was excellent!  The pork was very tender.  My husband seemed to think it was too salty. (Probably from mush soup) I loved it!

Easy and tasty.  Wonderful with mashed potatoes.
My chops were nice and thick, but I still didn't have to bake them for as long as was called for. Just keep an eye on them after about 45 minutes.

like the hundreds of other reviews, wonderful dish. a very comforting food. i used 1 1/2 thick "america cut" pork shops from jewel. the only change i made was that i removed from oven approx. 20 minutes early and it was still cooked all the way through and stayed moist. serve with homemade mashed tatos with skins on and its perfect!

Very good!  I only cooked mine for 20 min/20 min and they were just fine.  My husband usually doesn't like breading on his meat, but he loved these!  Will make again - (I used cooking white wine)

We like this recipe eventhough my chops truned out a little dry.  (Probably bacause they had been frozen.)I will try it again with fresh chops.  My husband also suggested we try the recipe with chicken. We liked the breading and the gravy.

I used Boneless top loin chops sliced thin.  I only cooked this for 30 minutes in the oven.  Turned out very good!  If you are careful you can remove the chops onto plate without removing the crispy coating.  I would not serve this if I was entertaining as it doesn't look all that pretty!  BUT IT TASTE YUMMY!  COMFORT FOOD A++++

These were the best pork chops I have ever made! I used boneless chops. I followed the recipe, except I didn't have but one can of cream of mushroom soup and I wanted to double the gravy like many cooks recommended. I did have a can of Golden Mushroom soup, so I used it and one can of cream of mushroom soup, 2/3 cup of wine and one cup of milk. I think the Golden Mushroom soup enhanced the gravy flavor. My hubby loved it . Usually, when we have baked pork chops, he turns up his nose--but not this time! You have got to try this recipe!!!

These pork chops were tender and tasty. However, I served it with rice and peas and found the mushroom sauce to dominate the rest of the food.  Next time I will make it with salad for a change of tastes.

I enjoyed this recipe and my children liked it alot too. My husband, however does not care for pork chops unless they are smothered with barbecue sauce. The rest of the world would probably enjoy it though. Thanks anyway!

Different, which is what I was looking for. Didn't have the white wine, so I threw in a teaspoon of worcestershire. Also threw some cajun seasoning on the foil before laying the chops down. Cooked for 45 min on 375 then 25 with soup.

As somebody who doesn't like cooking anything that takes longer than 5 mins, i have to say, this was worth the hour it took!  This is absolutely the best chops i ever had.  Like others have said, i doubled the soup to have extra sauce (and boy am i glad i did!).

This is the absolute best pork chop recipe ever! I had my in-laws over for dinner and they could not stop raving about it. My father in-law just kept asking how I got pork chops so tender. We didn't even have to use knives! They melt in your mouth. This is going in my "keeper" file!! Thanks for an awesome, easy and delicious recipe!

After reading all the great reviews, I decided that I must try this recipe.  I must admit, I was surprised that it just didn't quite do it for me.  I'm not sure what it was, but I was not at all impressed.  However, my husband and stepson thought the chops were terrific.  My husband did confess this recipe still did not surpass my Creole pork chop recipe. So I guess for hubby, I will have to make them again.

This was sensational!!! Although I was out of bread crumbs, I used crushed saltines instead and I had no seasoning salt so I used Monterey Style Roasted Garlic and Red Bell Pepper seasoning with Monreal chicken seasoning and rather than sprinkle over the chops, I blended it with the saltines. I didn't have any soup handy so I used what I had and that was roasted chicken gravy. With all the different spices and seasonings that I used, it really couldn't have gone wrong. It came out wonderful. Thank you for the great cooking idea. I will make this very often. Finger licken Good!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used ground up Stovetop stuffing in leiu of breadcrumbs and it worked wonderfully!  I also made a raspberry vinegarette dressing instead of the soup mixture which when baked gave it a nice, sweet, crunchy coating with the breadcrumbs.... excellent!

I read many reviews and decided to try the recipe. I used 1 inch thick chops and browned them in a non stick pan.  They looked great.  They smelled even better when they were baking.  I baked them a little longer and at 325.  When I added the mushroom soup, I increased the milk to 1 cup.  The sauce when they are done doesn't taste or look like mushroom soup.  I added a little water and mixed in the browned bits to make a nice gravy after I removed the chops from the baking dish. It was delicious.

I used this recipe with 2 chicken breasts and 2 pork chops.  It was so good.  I used a butter knife to cut my chicken.  My 2 year old and my husband both loved it!  They even ate the leftovers! WOW!  Thanks.

This is the second time I prepared this recipe, fabulous the second time as well.  Although I added crushed red pepper to add some zip to the pork chops and also added white wine and shallots and changed the sauce to a parmesean sauce with added pesto sauce, I must say I created a new and improved recipe.  Should try.  Easy too.  Enough sauce to put over noodles.  Kids loved it.  :O)

Very good!  I used 4 boneless pork chops and used one cup of bread crumbs.  The pork chops were so tender, no knife was needed!  I put the extra mushroom wine sauce over skillet potatoes.  I will make this again.

I had to cook fry the pork chops just under medium.  I tried frying them on med-high like the directions state and burnt the black in under a minute.  Once I got it all figured out they turned out well.

Good recipe.  Used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.

I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken with mushrooms. These pork chops were fantastic! The meat just fell off the bone. My husband and 14 month old (who only has 4 teeth) LOVED them. The best pork chops I've ever made. I don't even really care for pork chops and I liked them.  They are well worth the time and effort. A great Sunday meal.

I've never made porkchops before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect, but this dish was so simple and very tasty.  My husband and parents, who are used to Filipino porkchops, loved it.  This is the one time I'm glad we have leftovers.

My daughter had a picky eating friend over and
as usual when we get a recipe from my recipes 
my family grades them at the dinner table.  
We asked Rachel (my daughters friend) her rating and she gave it a ten along with everyone else in
the family.  Love it!!!!!!

This was absolutely one of the best pork chop recipes I have ever used.  I rarely cook pork chops because they always seem to dry and tough, but these were fork tender!!  Will make again soon!  Thanks!

I don't eat meat but am always looking for recipes to make for my carnivour husband. I can't taste test so it's always a surprise with him. They looked good though. Extremely tender. I omitted the white wine however. He loved them. I guess I'll be making them again.

Wonderful recipe.  I didn't have italian style bread crumbs so I made my own by adding Oregano, Basil and It. seasoning to plain bread crumbs.  Like the others I reduced the time and used 4 boneless pork chops. I also, like someone else, prepared the chops ahead of time and baked it just before time for dinner.  This definately went into my All Recipes recipe box.

this was really good and my family liked it really well. We fixed it for New Years Day along with blackeyed peas.  Yes, we live in the south! I didn't cook it quite as long as the reciped stated but my oven tends to cook a little fast anyway.  Was even great for my husband to take to work for lunch the next day.  thanks for a great recipe.

Wow!!  This was amazing!  My husband is very anti-pork but I tried this recipe anyway and couldn't believe that he went back for seconds!  The pork was moist, flavorful and delicious!  I served this with rice and spinach and it made a perfect meal!  Thanks for posting the recipe!!

These were the most tender tasteful pork chops ever! Meat almost fell off the bone. Maybe needs more of the mushroom soup mixture next time. Will be making again!

My family liked this a lot, but I found that the breading stuck to the pan when I was browning it, so the first time I flipped them over all of it stuck to the bottom.

AMAZING Pork Chop recipe. I was sick of them drying out, and you definitely didn;t get dry chops here. My boyfriend loved them, and I could put them in the oven and walk away. I will definitely make again! Thanks.

What a great way to fix pork chops - everything was yummy & moist.  Might "cheat" the next time and use packaged stuffing for pork to make it faster & easier.  This is a keeper!

This was delicious!  My husband loved these (he took 2nds) and he usually panics when I tell him we're having pork chops!  The kids (8 & 4) really enjoyed it also, they ate every bite - a miracle meal!  I also shortened the cooking time as I was pressed for time and it still came out perfect.  I think I cooked the whole thing for a total of 45-50 minutes.  We don't drink wine so I used apple juice instead and it was great.

I am with the majority opinion, this dish was delicious, I used the cream of mushroom soup with garlic, I also mixed the flour and bread crumbs together and shortened the cooking time to 30/30.  The chops were still fork tender.  This is a definite keeper.  Thanks

I used 1/2" thick boneless chops and cooked them 40/20 as other reviewers had mentioned.  They were very tender and quite tasty.

Took time but was well worth it.  My husband and I loved it!  My 4 yr old wouldnt touch it (he is a picky eater. LOL).  The only problem was the wine, we dont drink so I pretty much threw out an entire bottle of wine.  Not sure what I could use as a substitute?

This recipe is absoulutely delicious.  My family could eat it more than once a week.  The only problem was I doubled the sauce mixture so there would be enough to serve on the rice and for any leftover pork chops to be used later.

My wife had to work late so it was my turn to cook. She left out the pork chops and expected to come home to the same old dish. Your "man-friendly" recipe made me look great, she bragged about it to all of her friends. GREAT RECIPE! Thanks again.

I went ahead and changed the recipe just how others suggested. Used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic, changed cooking time to 40/20. The meat was truly tender and I loved every bite!! I don't think I'll make plain fried pork chops ever again, this recipe rocks!!

This was absolutely delicious!  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup instead of plain cream of mushroom.  It turned out great!  I used thinner cuts of pork, so I cut down the time to 45 minutes before adding the sauce and 30 minutes after.  I also browned the pork a shorter amount of time.  The meat was so tender.  My husband loved it!

I made this yesterday - it was okay.  I am not a big pork chop fan, but...with all the great reviews I figured it was worth the shot.  My family members said that it was good, but none of the rave reviews that the other people commented on.  rray

We were pleased with this recipe.  The house smelled delicious when making it!  As recommended, I cut the baking time down to 4O/2O which was sufficient. Next time I will be sure to turn the chops over after the first 40 minutes, but it ended up pretty good! I topped the nice tender chops with french fried onions, and served them with rice pilaf and green beans....

Everyone but my 3 year-old loved this dish.  I only baked the chops for about 45 minutes as opposed to the whole hour, then added the sauce and continued.  I loved the way the pork chops were very tender, and stayed crispy even in the sauce (if browned long enough--not sure 5 min. per side is enough).  I served w/ rice and green beans, it was delicious.

This was sooo great! Browning chops until very crispy helped keep breading on chops. Also cutting down baking time. I check chops before adding sauce and estimated additional baking time.

Taste is great but the cooking time is too long.  I 30 mins & 30 mins after adding the sauce.  5 mins is too long on the browning too.  The chops are as tender as you can get but the sauce is pretty greasy.  I think I'll make it w/o the sauce next time.

I doubled the soup mixture.  It tasted great.  The pork chops (boneless) were tender enough that you don't need a knife to cut them!  The sauce was excellent, too!

This has become one our family favorites. Tender, tasty and easy to make. I sprinkle some of those canned french fried onions on top for the last 10 minutes of baking - Delicious!

*Great* recipe!  I'm in a monastery and cooked this up for 30 people in my community, picky eaters one and all.  I got rave reviews!  I can't even cook!!  The bread crumbs and sauce kept the chops very tender.  Great flavor.  If I can cook this, so can you.  =)

Thanks for the great recipe.

Fabulous! I used 1 1/4 thick boneless chops and the suggestion to bake 40/20. Perfect!!! Might want to double gravy if you are gravy lovers.

I'm not much of a pork fan, so the fact that I didn't hate it says something. Taste was about average. I certainly wouldn't rave over it like some of the reviewers have.

Don't listen to those who have omitted the wine and added extra milk. The sauce definitely is not as good without the wine. Without it, this is a run-of-the-mill pork chop n' condensed soup recipe. I know, I tried it.

These pork chops are so tasty and moist-a real crowd pleaser. Whenever I serve them, I am asked for the recipe. They are great for entertaining because I make them ahead and can enjoy my guests while they cook.

If they had an option for picking above 5 stars, I would've picked that.  It is so easy and turns out so moist and has so much flavor to it.  I will definitely make this again...and again.

The breading got a little soggy, but apart from that the taste was fabulous. I did not bake the chops for the full time that the recipe called for. I baked them for 45 minutes.

Delicious. If you have thin (1/2 inch) chops, shorten the first bake time to 30 minutes. I make this with fewer chops than the recipe calls for in order to have more sauce for each.

Made this recipe last night, true with other reviewers, never had pork chops that were so tender and juicy.
I did shorten the first bake time as suggested by others to 45min, then 30.  Husband agreed that they were 
delicious.  No white wine, so I used a little lemon juice (1/4 cup) and added more milk.

Great recipe!!!  The whole family loved it, even hubby who doesn't much care for mushrooms--I pureed the soup to make it "safe", lol.  When finished, my son exclaimed, "This is what I call 'oh my god good'!!!"

It was really good!  The chops came out really tender, and my six-year-old who 
rarely eats meat loved it.  I will use this receipe again.

Overall this recipe was pretty good.  I cut back on the oil (about half),used low fat mushroom soup and egg whites only and decreased the amount of time I cooked it for.  I only baked it for 40 minutes before adding the sauce and 15 minutes after (I was running out of time).  It was still very good and very tender.  I'll definitely make again.

Delicious!  A little heavier than I expected -- better as a cold-weather meal. Still, was a big hit with my family.  I added 8 oz fresh mushrooms.. wonderful! Definitely a 'keeper.'

I just followed the recipe for the baked chops.  I didn't cover them with the mushroom soup.  But they were wonderful just by themselves and served with a vegetable.

I had no milk or white wine when I decided to make this for dinner tonight, so I substituted a little over 1/2 cup of Bass Ale for the white wine.  As for the milk, I assumed the purpose was to dilute the condensed mushroom soup a bit, so I merely filled the soup can halfway with water & added it to the mixture.  For the baking time, I did 45/40 & the results were absolutely yummy.  My husband was impressed with the way the chops were fork-tender.  I will definitely be making this again.

These were so moist and delicious!  I impressed the in-laws with this recipe and they said these are excellent!!!  I used very thick boneless chops and I doubled the sauce and served with rice.  Everyone loved these, including very picky teenager and husband!  Thank you!

An hour and a half was way too long in my gas oven, I almost burned it, but it was still fantastic... try cutting the time or at least check it early!

Very good, I am skeptical when a recipie calls for Cream of Mushroom soup.  This 
was very good and chops are very tender.  Thanks for the great dish!

Loved, loved, loved this recipe!!  I had to substitute chicken soup instead of mushroom because it was all we had. I also added a bit of onion powder and substituted about a 1/4 cup sherry for a touch of the milk and wine.  I cooked it for 40 minutes without the sauce and another 25 with.  Ours wasn't fork tender, but we used 2 inch chops so I'm sure that's why.  Didn't matter to me though, it was wonderful and we're making it again tonight.  I can't wait! :)  Thanks for a yummy recipe!!

It's easy, fast and the pork chops are moist.  My kids (5,12,16 and 18) all liked it a lot and best of all my 5 year old didn't cry because I cooked dinner!  It was a nice accompaniment to Scooby Doo mac and cheese and apple sauce.  Winning at dinner is always good.

We thought this was a great recipe!  I had boneless, thick cut chops so it did require the time indicated for baking.  I did not have any regular cream of mushroom soup in my supplies but I had a can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and that made a great sauce.  Without children in the house I can't very well predict the kid friendly rating.  Thanks Dawn

Absolutely amazing.  
Delightfully delicious.
Scrumptiously savorful.

Very juicy pork chops here!  Wonderful gravy.  Also I added more salt & garlic powder in the begining for that great umph smell that garlic gives off.

i give this babies 6 ****** out of 5 *****!

The pork chops came out tender and my family said it was an okay recipe, but not a great recipe. We don't usually care for recipes made with canned soups. I think it is simply a matter of preferences.

These are the best pork chops I've had. Now I constantly keep pork chops on hand just so I can make this great dish. I've even also tried it with champagne instead of wine. Great both ways!

These chops were great-I did cut the baking time to 30/30.  The chops were done and juicy.  I also doubled the gravy and added fresh mushrooms.  I used a baking bag,I hate dry chops, these were great.  I am going to try this with chicken.  I thought adding some cream cheese to the gravy might be an idea,too.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Delicious!  I'm a novice cook, and this was very easy to prepare.  My pork chops always turn out dry, but these were full of juices.  I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks for the recipe! :-)

Very tasty but I cooked it too long so the pork was a bit dry.  I will definately make it again.

I had very high expectations for this recipe based on all the previous reviews, but we didn't think it was spectacular.  If I try it again, I will make it with boneless pork chops or chicken.

Excellent pork chop recipe.  The whole family loved it (even my picky kids!)  I used boneless chops and cut down the first baking time to 1/2 hour, then baked for an additional 1/2 hr after adding the soup mixture.  They were perfectly moist and delicious.  Will definitely make these again!!

I must be missing something. I followed to the tee and used excellent thick pork chops but found this to a bland disappointment.  My brother in-law was the only one who commented positively or cleaned his plate. I much prefer a chicken fried pork chop recipe that I use with the crock pot.

My family really loved this recipe, It's already become a favorite in our family. My husband doesn't eat carbs so I made his without the flour and bread crumbs, and they still turned out very good.
Even my little three year old liked them.

What a hit, even with the kids!  My "picky eater" daughter said, "These pork chops taste different.  What's in them?"  I was worried she had detected the wine.  But, when I asked her what tasted different, she said, "These are the best pork chops you've ever made!  Make them like this from now on."  This is a keeper recipe for sure!!!

I have to admitt when I saw "baked pork chops" I thought how dry and boring.  Then of 
course I tried them.  They were delicious!!  My whole house smelled wonderful while they
were baking.  I doubled the milk and wine, like others suggested, and I had plenty of gravy to spare.
I had to fight with my husband, so he wouldn't take the leftovers with him to  work.  I would definitely
make again.

I agree with everyone else...This recipe made the best pork chops I've ever eaten.  My Scottish husband is kind of picky, but he asked for seconds.  It takes a while to make, but is very easy and worth the wait. The chops came out very tender and moist. I'll use this recipe for company dinners.

This recipe smelled so good cooking! And it made the most tender pork we've ever had. Even my picky daughter, who usually snubs most beef, chicken, or pork,ate every piece of meat on her plate. A keeper for sure!!

SUPER RECIPE!  I have never really had a "love" for pork chops, but this recipe was really delicious!  Next time I'm going to add the soup mixture after 40 minutes and cook for just an additional 20.  90 minutes was a bit long, the dark meat of the chops were tender but the white part...a bit dry but still great.  I served it with baked potatoes and drizzled the gravy over them and a salad...mmmmmm....can't wait to make it again!

These pork chops were delicious.  This is not a quick recipe by any means.  The chops were very moist and tasty.  I served these with rice. Next time I will double the soup, milk and wine mixture to make more gravy.  My kids and husband loved these.  This is a keeper!

I need some help.  Although the chops were moist and tender, the bread crumb
coating was mushy.  Was I supposed to bake them UNCOVERED for the last 30
minutes?  We really like the flavor, so I'll try this again without the coating.  Any
suggestions?

This was very good - the pork came out very tender and tasty.  It took quite a bit of time to bake, but I guess you can not rush a good thing!  I am sure we will have this again in our house - good comfort food!

This recipe was very good.  The Italian bread crumbs and white wine really make an impressive meal.

These were excellent and I don't care for mushroom anything...I didn't use that much salt on them...I used 1" butterfly chops and did use every bit of cooking time...I use the Healthy Request Mushroom soup and maybe that is why it was a milder mushroom taste..Enjoy

Thank you Dawn, for this DELICIOUS recipe!  I loved it, hubby loved it, and KIDS devoured it!  I plan to make this often!  Definitely worth the effort!  I too cut down on the cooking time but I think you just have to judge by the thickness of the chops.  Definitely a keeper!

Tried this recipe the other night and it was a big hit with my boyfriend.  He's not a much of a pork eater, thinks its too dry, but he enjoyed this recipe and asked for it again this weekend.

We tried this recipe substituting red wine vinegar for the wine...probably should have invested in the wine.  It was ok.

The recipe was great--but I wouldn't call baking for 90 minutes quick.
