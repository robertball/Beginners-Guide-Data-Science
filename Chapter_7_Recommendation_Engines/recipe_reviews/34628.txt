This was fantastic! I used fresh-in-the-shell littlenecks and also added fresh "chowder clams" during the garlic step. Excellent taste and presentation! Family loved it - even the one who isn't wild about clams!

I did love this dish.  My only complaint was the rehydrated mushrooms I purchased were a mixed variety and were very chewy.  I may skip them altogether or try this recipe with fresh mushrooms.  I thought it was fantastic and I served it over Trader Joe's Garlic and Chive Linguine. I'm also tempted to try this with canned clams to decrease the cost. In terms of fresh clams, you want to make sure to buy clams that are tightly closed.  Take them home and immediately take them out of their bag (or they'll suffocate).  To clean them, scrub them with a brush, and place them in a large bowl of cold fresh water.  Let them sit there for at least 30 mins to filter out the sand.  Gently take them out and rinse them, and they are ready to use.  It's crazy to see how much sand ends up in the bottom of the cleaning bowl!  Update: I made it again, but used fresh portabella mushrooms and they were excellent.  It did turn the broth base a little brown, but was MUCH better than dehydrated mushrooms!

Yum! We both loved it.  The result is actually like a rich (but not heavy) garlicky clam soup, so I dished out the pasta in big, deep pasta bowls (plates are impossible) and poured the clam concoction over the pasta in each bowl. It was elegant but fun to eat the clams out of the shell and twirl the pasta with a fork and spoon between sips of savory broth.  This is a keeper!

I am not a cooke and I was looking for an impressive recipe to make for friends who are fabulous entertainers and love good food.  They raved and loved this dish.  I served it with veal chops,but no one noticed those because they were sopping up this delicious sauce!

Great tasting recipe! Cut back on the garlic, and used canned clams in juice (much less than 24 oz, in other words). Still was pretty salty, but mm-mm tasty.

Terrific recipe!  The only reason I didn't give it a "5" was because the clam juice made it too salty- next time I'll cut back on that and substitute low sodium broth or some of the liquid from the porcini reconstitution - very tasty and easy. Thanks!

I used fresh mushrooms, canned clams and less dried parsley. The clam juice was from the can. It was VERY garlicky (it says 10 cloves), wish I cut back on that, and also less red pepper flakes. I threw in some chopped fresh spinach, just to have some green color. Also added cornstarch as a thickener.  Overall good, I'll add my changes next time to make it a 5 star recipe.

Excellent recipe.  My husband and I both enjoyed this.   The mushrooms was a great addition.  I did add 2 tblspns of heavy cream to thicken the sauce.  It made an excellent base for dipping our garlic bread

This dish turned out super.  My husband, who is a man of very few words, commented that the dish was "very tasty" and "very good".  It was also easy to make.  I served with a salad and crusty multigrain bread for "sopping" up the extra sauce.  Definitely will be making again.

This was the first time I have tried clams in the shell.  There were very easy, but the taste didn't go over very well with the family.  This is a simple recipe to follow, I'm just not sure it was what I expected.

This was really great. I used fresh portobellos instead of the dried porchini as suggested by another user and it came out wonderful. I used generous portion of red pepper flakes as I like my meals spicy, without it I think it may have been a little bland for me.

I really liked this dish. I took the advice of others and used fresh cremini mushrooms. I scaled the recipe back to two portions but  used 1 cup of frozen clam meat. I loved the kick from the red pepper flakes. Thanks for sharing.
