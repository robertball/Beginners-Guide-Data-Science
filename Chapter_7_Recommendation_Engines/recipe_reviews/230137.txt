1 1/2 T is a lot of garlic powder - I cut it back to about 2 tsp. and it was plenty.  Also, I cut the butter back and added some milk to mash the potatoes.  With a few adaptions this would be a good recipe for using up the leftover ham and potatoes after a holiday meal.

We make this often, and it is always fantastic just as written, although I have never added the ham. It seems like a lot of garlic, but we love garlic so it's perfect for us.

I made this one night as a side dish for tilapia.  Husband loved it.  Because we were having fish I didn't at ham, but will defiantly try next time..

This is definitely a quick, easy and delicious recipe! My crew are not fans of ham so I added 1/4 cup of sour cream and replaced the ham with bacon. It is now a favorite!

Delicious! I used a hickory smoked cheddar and less cheese than called for since the hickory taste was so potent. Also more of a chives than a parsley person. It turned out great!
