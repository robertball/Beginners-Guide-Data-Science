Unlike the reviewer who described this as light and airy, I agree with Sumchelle that this is a dense cake, rich and moist, but still tender - and definitely not "fluffy."   Deep, dark chocolate, stick to your fork delicious! I did use the shortening as called for, and freshly brewed hot coffee rather than the water. So many frostings would work well with this, but I chose Brownie Frosting, also from this site. This satisfies even the most serious chocolate craving!

Excellent.  This was easy to whip up and tastes great.  I used 1/2 cup butter rather than shortening and added lemon to regular milk since I had no buttermilk.  It turned out just like I wanted.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it turned out to be delicious.  Instead of making a cake, I made cupcakes and iced them with "Chocolate Frosting III."  I made them for both my husband and I to bring to work, and they were devoured!  Everyone raved about them!

I loved this recipe.  I used unsalted butter instead of shortening.  It was chocolatey and delicious.

Wonderful cake.  Easy to make.  Light, moist and airy (all important qualities in a cake).  New family favorite.

I am not typically a negative person, but I can find nothing good to say about this cake.  The fact that the recipe only calls for a single egg should have been a clue to me that this would be more like a fudgy brownie than a cake.  It was moist, but it was too dense.  If you like airy, spongy cakes, this is NOT the cake for you.

I had to use canola oil instead of crisco but my cake turned out just fine.  It rose nicely and was not dense or fudgy at all.  As good as any chocolate cake I've made!!  Love that it fits in an 8x8 so we don't have a huge pan of dessert sitting around for just my family.  I paired it with "light and creamy brown sugar frosting" from this site.  It was just the right amount of frosting for this little cake.

Really good, easy chocolate cake!  I swapped a stick of unsalted butter for the shortening but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I topped it with a quick ganache made with of a couple of tablespoons each unsalted butter and heavy cream, 3 oz semi sweet chocoate and a tablespoon of rum and served it with fresh whipped cream.  It was fabulous and I will definitely make it again - probably in a heart-shaped pan for valentine's day.  Next time I'll use hot, strong coffee instead of water.

Very good cake and not difficult to make. Afterwards I topped with Paula's Whipped Cream recipe and added strawberries.

7.14.10 .. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/25609/my-moms-chocolate-cake/ ... This is the best DARK CHOCOLATE cake.  It is.  Note4Me:  7/13/10 BEST DARK CHOCOLATE CAKE. This is the cake I am entering in the 2012 contest - with coconut cannoli filling. 9.12 You can't boil the butter/shortening, coffee/water & cocoa in this recipe.  There is too much cocoa to boil it. not too much for the recipe since it's dark, but too much because it thickens & will just stick/burn.  Add it to the pot once hot.

The only change I made was using HOT COFFEE instead of WATER.  (Always...)  This cake is soooo incredibly dense and rich.  I made it in a bundt pan, same cook time.  I enjoyed this a lot more though when it was fresh from the oven, all hot.

This was so good. My three year old wanted cake the other night and I didn't have a cake mix so I searched and searched and decided to try this recipe. Everyone liked it. Thanks.

I substituted apple sauce for the shortening. For the frosting I went with mixed berries and whip cream. Very Very delicious! This is a keeper.

I made this cake and it is delicious.  I did however use butter instead of the shortening (I just prefer butter). Family loved it and I will certainly make this again. Thanks for the share.

Love this recipe for a quick and easy chocolate fix.  I use a muffin tin and get 6 jumbo muffins/individual cakes.  I glaze the tops with melted chocolate chips, a bit of cream and tablespoon (or two) of  port.  Yum!

It is a very easy and great recipe, thanks. I add some dark chocolate and instead of milk I used coffee creamer and lemon to make it parve. It looks great and my son just had two pieces!!!!

I tried this recipe today.  However, I substituted the shortening for margarine(Country Crock), and followed the rest of the recipe.  I used an extra-large sized egg and cooked it in a Bundt pan for about 30 min.  My cake looks, smells and tastes like a boxed cake mix.  It is moist like a boxed mix and not at all dense like some reviewers claim with theirs. I can't imagine what they did, but I found the recipe very easy to put together and a very good copycat.  I'll use this one again.
