This recipe is awesome! My kids wanted to make a special dinner for dad...they picked this as their dessert. My husband thought he had died and gone to heaven!! Honestly, this is the best turtle brownie/pie we've made. We shared with neighbors, who loved it as well. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

sooooo good.  i used an 8 inch springform pan and cooked it 35 min.  It was a little undercooked in the middle so next time I'd cook it for a couple more minutes....but it was still awesome!

This recipe was terribly dry! At first I thought I had done something wrong, but when I went back and double checked, I found that the recipe was just not any good at all. I can't imagine cooking it for the full time (I only did 30 minutes)because they could only be worse! Even ice cream couldn't fix these. :)

Oh Wow! Yum! Yum!  Where are the bakers?  I  can not believe this only had 2 reviews before mine.  This is an awesome brownie :)  If you are unsure don't be!  This recipe is soooo simple and looks like it came from a bakery!  The pecans were heavenly in this.  I did not use caramel as I was out but I drizzled Hersheys Syrup right over the top and it was perfect!  I did bake mine in a 9.5 inch glass pyrex pie pan instead of the spring form pan and it baked for around 40-45 minutes and came out perfect.  What are you waiting for?  This recipe is a keeper.
