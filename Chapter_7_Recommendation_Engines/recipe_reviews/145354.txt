Great for breakfast!  I used regular oats and instead of whipped topping I topped it with a big dollup of fat free greek yogurt. Very easy and very good.

This was good and easy to make. It could have been a bit sweeter for me but a good alternative to plain oatmeal.

Great way to jazz up steel cut oats. I just cook it like normal and garnish with my own freezer jam. My kids especially think this is keen.

This was very, very tasty, and so simple. But it needs a few tweaks to make it a healthier breakfast. Replace the instant oatmeal with steel cut oats. They have a nice crunch to them. I cook a big batch up and keep them in the fridge. For this recipe (1 serving) I used 1 cup of precooked steel cuts and 1/2 cup 1% milk. Just put in the microwave on high power for about 2 minutes to heat. I used the low sugar raspberry preserves, but replaced the whip topping with a dollop of raspberry yogurt. No sweetener needed. Delicious.

I can't stand oatmeal in general, but this is a great way to make it more tolerable.  I add a dollop of lite whipped cream and a few slivered almonds or granola to add additional texture.  Great fix to yucky oatmeal.

This was pretty good, I used water but I think it would taste better with milk.

Really love this idea for quick and tasty oatmeal, only changes I made were 1) old fashioned oats rather than instant, and 2) omit the whipped topping.  I find the old fashioned oats healthier and tastier than the ones in packets, and I just didn't have whipped topping on hand. Still made for a great, fast bowl of oatmeal. I really like the idea of using fruit yogurt instead of whipped topping. Will definitely try this with other types of preserves for some variety.

Great idea! I love oatmeal, and I'm always looking for fun new ways to jazz up this morning favourite of mine. Sliced banana with peanut butter, or a drizzle of honey, apple chunks and cinnamon, and the list goes on. This is definitely making it into the rotation! And maybe I'll try plain yogurt or cream cheese in the future just for fun!
