What makes the authentic Spanish Paella so flavorful is the use of powdered saffron. For this reason I eliminated the oregano and tumeric and used 1/16th teaspoon saffron. Its pricey, but you have to use only a wee bit to really enhance all the flavors of this wonderful dish. I also cut the broth to 3 cups and used 1/2c white wine, 1 pound shrimp not 2; 4 ounces of chorizo not 8 of italian sausage. Use peas instead of green peppers and you will have an authentic Paella. This is good...authentic is the best.Thanks Amy.

This is NOT paella.  This is Jambalaya, and not a great one at that.  Paella is made with saffron and not the other types od herbs listed, and it is traditionally made with whole chicken parts and seafood (most still in shells).  For a better version of this recipe try searching for Jambalaya, and for authentic Paella, look for a recipe with seafood and saffron.

Took this to my company potluck and everyone loved this.  One quick note though, this recipe makes a HUGE amount of food.  When I make it for my family, I only make a half recipe and we still have enough to feed 6-7 people.

We loved this recipe...very unique blend of tastes! This is a refreshing combination and my daughter of 5 cleaned her bowl.  I omitted the turmeric and on the second time I made this, due to lack of hot Italian sausage available, I just used mild sausage and it did not compromise the taste.  Thanks Amy for this great recipe.  Will make again and again!!

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site - absolutely delicious! The only change I make is to substitute sea scallops (added 5 minutes before the shrimp) for the hot sausage (too spicy for my taste).  Also, I use already flavored saffron rice instead of white and omit the tumeric. I made this Christmas Eve for my parents and grandmother and everyone loved it! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best recipe! I got this recipe over 2 years ago from allrecipes.com, and I make it all the time. This one is a keeper!
Also, please cook the rice separately and you won't have to wait for it to get done. When the rice is done, you pour back into the pot when the rest of the meal is done. Mix it together.

Perfect paella, in my humble opinion. I too used chorizo and once the shrimp was in, we placed little neck clams on top and covered the pot until they steamed open. My gang and company couldn't get enough. Thanks so much Amy!

Good eats!  The sausage is a little easier to cut if you cook it through a bit first.  Also, use scissors to cut the sausages...it is much easier than using a knife because the sausages are hard to cut without making a mess.  Also, punch holes in the sausages so the juices run more.

What a great little recipe!  I omitted the celery and changed a few other things around and it was fairly quick, tasty and provided a bountiful portion of food.  The safron is always a better way to go if you can but for the poor man tumeric works fine.

I made a few adjustments and it was delicious. I sauteed the onion, gp, celery and garlic then added the rice. Just like a real paella, I gradually added the chicken stock (double the amount) until absorbed. After about 20 min, I added all the remaining ingredients and simmered for an additional 10 min. I also sauteed some diver scallops and placed them on top of the paella upon plating. Will def make again!

I eliminated the hot links, oregano, tumeric and bay leaves and used saffron. A bit pricey, but a great idea for a special occasion.

I've made this a couple of times - it is great. I found the rice cooked better when I halved the recipe and I add a couple of dashes of hot sauce (we prefer Cholula) when I add the shrimp.

Very expensive, very disappointed.

This recipe was nothing like i expected. If you are looking for a "hispanic" paella, this is definitely not the recipe for you. It wasn't an awful dish. It actually tasted okay, but it was definitely not worth the near $20 I spent on the ingredients.

Overall this is a good recipe, but it just wasn't a true Paella. I made this dish per the recipe and found it fairly easy to make. There are quite a few steps, but they're all easy and everything times together pretty well. The main reason that I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because the Italian sausage just doesn't belong in this dish. Its completely wrong. I highly recommend using Chorizo instead. As for the seasoning, many other reviewers recommend using saffron, which I would try as well. Those changes would be enough to make this a true Paella and a recipe worthy of 5 stars.

Even if this is not true Paella, it was a hearty dish with a rich taste, and very pleasing between the sausage and the seafood.  I added some pan seared scallops and that gave the dish a bit more depth in seafood flavor - the scallops were melt in your mouth with a very good flavor!  I will be making this dish again.  Thanks!

This was amazing! I used a little more celery, less shrimp and added scallops and clams. Also, I used two cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies, and used saffron instead of tumeric. My Irish husband had thirds and has been taking the leftovers to work for lunch! Definately a hit!

I did enjoy this recipe, however, I omitted the oregano and turmeric, and used saffron instead.  Paella just isn't paella without saffron.  I also skipped the celery, as I had none, and threw in some peas toward the end, with the shrimp - mainly for added color.  This recipe really makes a LOT of food - it served 8 adults with a nice portion of leftovers.

Delicious! I cut down on the sausages and shrimp but kept the liquid and rice amounts the same. The recipe made enought for 6 adults and 3 children with some left over. We'll definitely make this one again.

This recipe is terrific, but after reading all the reviews, I made a few changes and it turned out great.  I eliminated the tomatoes completely, as that would make it more of a Jambalaya and left out the celery. I reduced the meats to 2 chourizo (Portuguese) sausages, cut in 1/2 lenthwise, then sliced into 1/3" half-moons and 2 Andouille sausages, cut into 1/4" slices.  I reduced the shrimp to 1 1/4 lbs.  I added 1/4 red bell pepper chopped.  I increased the garlic to 4 cloves, minced.  Added 1 packet of Goya Sazon (contains cilantro and annato)in Step 2.  I increased the chicken broth to 3 3/4 cups to make up for the reduction in liquid resulting for eliminating the tomatoes.  Took this to a family event and received rave reviews.

I used this recipe as a starting point based on the ingredients I had on had and our dietary choices (we don't eat chicken or sausage).  It was delicious though and appreciate the fantastic inspiration!   These are the changes I made: I used Swai fish as the only meat and followed the directions that applied to shrimp for preparation, shredding it into chunks when fully cooked.  I also didn't have (or couldn't find) salt so I substituted tamari.  I added frozen peas as well and omitted bay leave because, again, I didn't have them.  This is definitely a recipe I will make again and again!!  Thank you!

Give this 5 stars for taste, everyone in my house liked it. BUT the proportion of the meat was too high for the amount of rice called for, and next time I will add more of the tomato juices and chicken broth so the rice will have some more liquid to cook in. Also, I used saffron flavored yellow rice. I will definitely cook again, the flavors blended really well.

I found that there wasn't enough liquid in this recipe to keep the rice from sticking to the bottom. It has the makings for a great recipe, but I had to  modify the temperature and the amount of liquid the second time I made it.

I used chorizo instead of the sausages they mentioned, and it added a really nice flavor. I also used 3 parts chicken broth and 1 part white wine instead of all chicken broth. A dash of chili powder and substituting boxed saffron rice worked really well for flavor and price/ease. A quick and tasty meal!

I used bulk Italian sausage for this, since that is what I had on hand, and I cut the recipe in half to feed two people.  This still made a huge amount and it was really good.

Good solid recipe for paella, relatively easy to make. I took the previous poster's advice and made the rice seperately, and then added about half the chicken broth so it wouldn't be too soupy since the rice is pre-cooked. The result is yummy, but didn't bring out any extraodinary flavors.

Yummy...omitted the celery, tumeric and added a little more garlic and a medium can of clams(drained)to the rice mixture when I added the shrimp. I used all mild sausage since my husband doesn't like "hot".

This recipe was pretty good!  I omitted the shrimp, and the chicken I used was marinated in Italian dressing for 24 hours and it turned out very tender.  I also removed some of the sausage drippings after I sauteed the chicken in it because it was just too much.  Definately use the hot Italian sausage because it gives it a nice kick, but it was mild enough for my 1 year old to enjoy.  Over all yummy and will definately make again.

Great, easy recipe...  I changed/added a few ingredients - used yellow pepper in place of green, instead of oregano and turmeric I added saffron, I used less stock and added white wine and added a hand full of fresh, chopped celantro just before serving.  Just wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe Amy!  :)

This recipe is great.   I cut it down to feed 5 people and used bulk italian sausage cut into chunks and cooked that way.   I also added two chicken breast cuts into strips and 1/2 lb of pre-cooked shrimp.   I took advice from other and used saffron rather than oregano and tumeric. Wonderful taste because each items is cooked in the same pot so all the flavors mix.   P.S. - It heats well in the microwave for lunches.

I followed most of the suggestions for making the paella authentic, and it was turned out to be absolutely amazing.  I used a tiny bit of saffron
instead of oregano and tumeric, halved the amount of shrimp, used chorizo instead of Italian sausage, and peas instead of green peppers.  I did not have white wine, but I'll use that next time as the reviewer suggested.  I'll definitely be making this again!  Thanks!

The rice took so long to cook. The veggies ended up mushy by the time the rice was done. I will be using cooked rice next time.  I added red peppers, mushrooms and a jalepeno to mine. I don't know if I will try this same recipe again but this was my first time making this sort of dish so I will definatly use some of the elements of this dish to create my own

This dish is requested in my household very often. One change I implemented myself was substituting the mild Italian sausage for chorizo, which gives it an even better flavor combination to the dish. One thing I saw missing in the recipe, that would not be missing at any Spanish restaurant or household is the lemons!! After you serve the food, might want to give people some lemon wedges to squeeze over their dish . I usually squeeze 2 or 3 wedges of lemon to my plate. Other than that this is a great recipe.

Easy to make.  I used only chicken, no shrimp or sausage.  I just don't think I like rice cooked to be this moist and creamy, but the flavors were very good.

Absolutely delicious, and really easy to make! I've never had paella, so I was a little worried, but it turned out fabulous. My husband and my daughter both loved it, though I did have to omit the shrimp because my hubby's allergic.

If you liked this paella you should definitely try this recipe. I suggest that you add in seafood and chorizo but you could make it your own and add in anything you like.  TRY IT!

I LOVED this recipe!  I subbed peas for the green pepper (added the peas at the end with the shrimp) and used saffron.  My only complaint (and the reason why I rated 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the rice took FOREVER to cook and time to cook from start to finish was 2 hours.  Thanks for submitting this!

Stellar, and so easy to prepare! We scaled the recipe to 4 servings, as I can't think of a wok big enough to make 10. I added spiciness by using only spicy sausage. I also added a splash more chicken broth when simmering with the sausage. The shrimp adds more moisture, so the rice cooked up perfectly. My guy said this tasted better than any he's ever had before (and that's saying a lot!)

It is not that this recipe was terrible, it just does not taste like paella which is a saffron-flavored dish.  Paella is a very rich and flavorful dish that soaks in the added spices while cooking.  The flavors used in this recipe are more of a subdued taste. 

I followed the recipe precisely.  The Italian sausage added a very distracting flavor to the dish.  

To note, the best paella I have ever tasted came from Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, at Columbia Restaurant.

I halved this recipe and cut way down on the sausage, chicken, and shrimp.  I used saffron instead of turmeric and oregano as others suggested.  My husband loved it and it is definitely one I'll make again.  It wasn't difficult to make either.  I added a little extra broth to keep it moist and the whole dish took less time than stated in the recipe.  Overall...excellent dish Amy.  Thank you.

well as someone who is not exactly experienced with cooking, i tried this out. i heeded a lot of the advice on here about cutting back on the sausage, chicken and shrimp and went with a little over half of each. thank god i did! this turned out absolutely delicious and was more than enough to feed 4 adults with leftovers (which were great the next day). i went with the peas instead of peppers and added some safron and safron rice. all in all i highly recommend this!

This recipe was great and surprisingly easy.  I added 1/2 cup wine and only did 3 cups broth, but next time I'll follow the recipe and omit the wine.  The only thing I'd change is the green peppers which aren't a fave of mine anyway.  I did add peas to mine, and I'd do that again, and just leave out the peppers altogether.    It was a delicious recipe and presented very beautifully.  Thanks Amy!

This was a hit with my family! I did modify it for our wussy taste buds. I did not use any hot Italian sausage, or bell peppers. I also didn't have saffron or turmeric. Believe it or not, this recipe was still excellent! I can only imagine with the right spices now yummy it could be! I would mind if like to add green olives.....hmmmmmm.

Great recipe!  Paella turned out very well.  The taste was awesome. Different textures from the meats added to the meal.  Threw in some Squid to liven things up!

I used 7 heirloom tomatoes from my plants and a can of fire roasted tomatoes from Aldi's. I also pureed the tomato mixture. My son doesn't like the texture of a chunky sauce. The dish ended up more of a stoup than rice dish. But it still was delicious!

I used brown jasmine rice. That took longer to cook so I needed an additional 5 minutes at the end. My husband missed the clams but we all loved the flavor. I used hot Italian turkey sausage instead of chorizo, less fat and calories but then needed a bit of olive oil in the pan to cook the veggies. I would definitely make it again. Not your typical paella but delicious.

I made this last night for my picky husband and he loved it!  The only changes I made were I used peas instead of bell pepper for greens and I used 4 oz of chorizo instead of the Italian sausage and I used saffron rice instead of the saffron.  Saved some money by doing this! Just note that this recipe  is for 10 servings so cut it down to size for your family.

While I love seafood Paella made with fish stock, I think the sausage, chicken and chicken stock in this recipe makes it so much more flavorful.

Ingredient changes I found nice, but which ended up doubling the recipe:  
- 12 (not 10) total fresh sausage links (half hot, half mild) from Central Market meat counter (must be larger than 4 oz each, because it was a lot of sausage);
- Two packages chicken thighs cut in strips (not tenders);
- Added 1 pound Bay Scallops (awesome treats in the dish);
- Added 3 scallions, cut into 1 inch pieces (sautéd with other veggies);
- Instead of just 1 green pepper, I also added 1 red, 1 yellow and 1 orange pepper (4 total);
- Instead of canned, peeled, diced tomatoes, I used 28oz can peeled cherry tomatoes in one dish and 5-6 diced fresh tomatoes (smallish) in the second dish which worked great;
- Lots of oregano and extra saffron.  Added salt while sautéing veggies.   No turmeric.;
- Arborio rice, not long grain; 

I also sautéd the shrimp and bay scallops, very lightly with salt and some oil, then set them to cool and rest before adding them to the dish later.

Because this doubled the recipe, at the end of Step 1, I took half the sautéd veggies and moved them to my paella pan to use as my second cooking pot.  From there on, I cooked two paellas -- one with all the hot sausage links for the adults and one with all the mild sausage links for the kids.  I added extra Arborio rice and broth to balance out the mix.

Sausage and shrimp?  How can it be anything  but wonderful?  The 15 minute wait between adding sausage and adding shrimp is not strictly necessary, but allows the sausage flavor to become integrated into the dish.

In my previous experience Paella has never tasted like mere Spanish rice with an array of meat, poultry and seafood added in. I am very sorry to have hoped and tried to get a decent meal out of this recipe.

This recipe is nice and tasty.  Those are one of the responses that I have received when I prepared it yesterday.  I made some changes as usual and added some ingredients that I think would go well with this dish.

Aditional things that I have put in are squid and mussels.  Which are my all time favourite. I altered the celery to red bell pepper and instead of putting 10 links of hot/mild (5 of each) sausage, I only added two of each.  I based it on the market size and went from there.

Ohhhh, this is soooo good! I am dieting, of course, so I replaced the sausages with turkey kilbasa, and used just a squirt of PAM to saute the chicken in. It was delicious. The only other adjustments I made were to add a half cup more broth and a 1/4 cup of chardonnay. (I made this at half size)

I did not put any shrimp, because my husband is allergic to shrimp. I thought there was more sausage than needed. I added some eggplant, simply because I had lots in the fridge. Turned out that the eggplant absorbed the juice of the broth and the sausage and it tastes great. 
Overall, fantastic recipe.

Good recipe and very tasty, I would only suggest to cut the sausage, chicken, and shrimp in half.
