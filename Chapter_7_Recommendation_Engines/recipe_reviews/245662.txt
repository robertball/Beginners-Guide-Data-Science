I forgot that I didn't have a jalapeno, so I added a new jalapeno powder that I picked up in New Mexico when I was there.  Otherwise I followed the ingredients as written.  We thought this was a first-class guac!  Thanks so much for sharing this!

A simple twist on the typical guac. The mild acidity of the tomatillos lets you really taste the avocado. I added a bit more salt and a few chopped yellow cherry tomatoes.
