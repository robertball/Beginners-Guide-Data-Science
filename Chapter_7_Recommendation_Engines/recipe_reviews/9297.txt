Even though I felt the ingredients list was overwhelming when I first found this recipe, I would now swear it's well worth it.  Pumpkin pie fans and non-fans enjoyed this creation and I can't wait to bring it home for Thanksgiving this year.  The crust is extra-fancy tasting with the pecans.  You can taste the highly recognizbale cheesecake flavor and harmonious blend of pie spices with each bite.  The extra effort pays off in the end.  I cooked mine in a water bath, cracked the oven door open after turning off the stove, and chilled over night.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Great light flavor!  I used this recipe to make mini cheescakes with 1/2 tsp of crushed ginger snaps in the bottom of mini cupcake liners.  Turned out great with 15 minutes bake time!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year at my in-laws, and they absolutely loved it. I thought it was really good too. Although I was skeptical about pumpkin cheesecake, the pumpkin flavor is not overpowering. I made one with graham cracker crust and the other with ginger snaps and the ginger snap was much better. I also suggest doing 1.5X the crust recipe. It makes the perfect amount.

It came out incredible. Here are my changes based on other's suggestions and my own research:
-Trade graham cracker crumbs for ginger snaps. Put the snaps in a ziplock bag and hammer them until you have crumbs.  Next time, I will double the amount of the crust and run it up the sides too.
- I doubled allspice instead of mace and ginger.
-I skipped the lemon extract in favor of double vanilla
- Despite what the recipe says, add eggs last and don’t mix it too much. The eggs cause the cheesecake to rise, which may cause cracks if there’s too much air in the batter.
-Bake for 50 minutes @ 350.  To avoid cracks, don’t open the oven for at least the first 30 minutes. 
--Be sure to use a springform pan (bed bed and beyond) and make a water bath (prevent the cheesecake from cracking).  Wrap the bottom and sides of the pan with aluminum foil.  Drop it into a larger oven-safe pan or brownie pan that will let you have at least 2 inches of water in it. Boil the water and pour it into the larger pan and cook the whole thing in the oven.
-After 50 minutes have ended, turn off the oven, open the oven door and let the cheesecake sit there for an hour. Then take it out of its bath (don’t remove the foil) and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  The next day, remove foil and sides of the springform pan.

This was awesome!  The only thing I changed in the actual recipe was to use nutmeg and cloves in place of the mace.  I added a whipped cream frosting (4oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/16 t. salt, 1/2 t. vanilla- beat together until smooth and fold into 3/4 heavy cream that's been whipped until stiff peaks formed.) to the top and drizzled on the maple syrup glaze (without pecans).  So yummy!!!

I cook, but am not "a cook." This cheesecake made me look like my talents are much greater than they actually are. This is an amazing recipe that is now a staple at our Thanksgiving and Christmas table. I have made it for friends and family. Everyone loves it. It is so rich that a little goes a very long way, but light enough not to give you that queasy feeling after a hefty serving. There are a lot of ingredients, but it is well worth the extra effort. If you are looking for this type of recipe, try this one first.

This was delicious!  I wanted to do a gingersnap crust, but the weird store near my house didn't have any and I was in a hurry, so I used cinnamon graham crackers for the crumbs and mixed with ground ginger.  I also skipped the mace because I didn't have it and added nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon.  I could not stop eating this and DH and sister loved it, too.  A definite keeper!
EDIT: I tried this again and still cannot keep it from cracking (tried water bath, cooling it in the oven, cooking on a lower temp), BUT I found the nut topping below on another site and now my cheescake is gorgeous!
Nut Topping:
3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/4 cup butter 
1/4 cup whipping cream
1 cup chopped toasted pecans
In a small heavy saucepan over low heat, combine brown sugar and butter; stir until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a boil; remove from heat and mix in whipping cream and pecans. Pour hot topping over baked cheesecake.

This recipe was excellent. I used nutmeg instead of mace recommended by another reviewer. I made this for a work christmas party. Everyone thought I had bought it because it was so good and pretty. By the time I left 3 people had asked me for the recipe. The recipe did have a few ingredients but it wasn't hard at all to make and was well worth it. I also topped it with heavy whipping cream and drizzled caramel over the top which made it even better.

I've made a lot of cheesecakes in my time and this one was just o.k.  I think the crust had WAY too much butter and the final product felt like it lacked something.  Hence why so many comments metioned that they made different toppings and sauces.  Next time I would definitely cut the butter in half.  It made the crust soggy.  I have seen other recipes that add more cream and I think I like those better.

Not only is this a great pumpkin cheesecake recipe!....This is the BEST cheesecake i ever tasted!...Who needs cheesecake factory when you have this?...Everybody went nuts for this recipe on thanksgiving and it was gone in less than 5 minutes!....My sister who is really skeptical and a big picky eater took a bite of this and she said that it tastes like heaven!!...I made a few changes...Instead of graham crackers for the crust i used ginger cookies(makes it even more awesome!) and about 1/2 cup pecans and a few tablespoons of brown sugar and white sugar, and i made a really simple whip cream topping along with some ginger thin cookies and pecans for decoration....if you let the cheesecake sit overnight the cookies will become moist and not only will it be easy to cut but it adds a wow factor to the cheesecake.

Very good!  I doubled the crust recipe, as I like mine to go up the sides. (Otherwise, the crust is yummy as directed!)  I used nutmeg instead of mace, like other reviewers.  I also added 1/2 t. of cloves and increased the cinnamon to 2 t.  Two mistakes:  I overbeat mine...so it rose then fell.  Learned for the future and hope you won't do the same. I also lost track of time and baked for an hour.  oops.  I placed a pan of water in the oven under the cake and had no cracks.  Even with my mistakes--yum yum.

This pumpkin cheesecake is outstanding!  I read the reviews first and used gingersnaps instead of the graham crackers... loved it!  The only other thing I changed was that I added a sour cream topping (1 container sour cream, 2 Tbs. sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon extract, 1/8 tsp. salt).  I would stick with the whipped cream as Cathy recommended, maybe vanilla flavored.  The sour cream topping was just a bit too much for the cake.  Anyway, it was a great hit - thank you so much for sharing!  I will make this again!!

Top with glaze: 1 cup whipping cream and 3/4 cup maple syrup. Simmer for 20 minutes add 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Pour on top of cake for last 5-10 minutes of baking. I even broiled it a bit. I made this for friends who are allergic to gluten, had to substitute finely ground cornflakes for the graham wafer crumbs though. They were very impressed!

I'll give it 5 because everyone liked it so much.  I'm not a big pumpkin pie fan so I wasn't as excited, but everyone else loved it.  It's a pretty easy recipe.  It looks more complicated than it really is.  Just follow the steps and it comes out great.

This is wonderful!  It is a scary looking recipe at first but it really is simple.  I did use a 12in pan, I doubled the crust.  I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, this is what I had and I didnt want to go buy mace just for this recipe and I left out the lemon extract.  I made real whip cream with the left over cream.  I made this for Thanksgiving for the entire family and was asked to make it for Christmas.  Excellent!

This cheesecake is great!  I usually like to eat cheesecake close to room temperature but this cheesecake was best straight out of the fridge.  The flavor was even better after a day or two.

This recipe is divine and is continually requested by my family at the holidays. I've made it dairy-free (due to food allergies) with much success. If you want tips, please DM me. I also subbed out gingersnaps for the graham crackers this year and it was very good.

This is a great recipe.  Everyone at Thanksgiving loved it and it shows off so much more fancy than it is to make. I was really surprised how easy it was.  I used about half to 3/4 of the required amount of both brown and white sugar in the recipe - we don't like things super sweet.  Definitely give this a try, even if you are timid around cheesecake recipes!

Overall delicious.  For me, too sweet.  I did substitute ginger snaps for the graham cracker crumbs and doubled the amount for crust that surrounded entire cake.  Next time I will decrease sugar and maybe increase pumpkin.

OK, WOW.  I made this as a trial run to see if people liked it and if so, I would make it for Thanksgiving.  I took it into work (I'm in the Army) and my Brigade Commander and Battalion Commander were the first to try it.  Then everyone else dug in.  Smashing success!!!  The directions are so logical and the ingredients may seem like a lot, but it's SO worth it.  When it finished cooking, I turned off the oven but cracked the door opened and let it cool and had no blemishes or cracks!!!  It looked like something out of a magazine!!  I used gingersnaps for the crust along with the pecans! BRAVO.  Also, no mace here in Germany, so I used nutmeg, it didn't matter, it was WONDERFUL!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!!

Wonderful.  I make these and sell them to my husband's coworkers around the holidays.  I've made probably 3 dozen of these and they are fabulous.  I don't feel the lemon extract is necessary- doesn't come through at all anyway.

Made this one for Thanksgiving and it was awesome.  I used ginger snaps for the crust, and even though gingersnaps are pretty strong, the crust turned out wonderful, and the cheesecake was delicious.  Omitted the pecans in the crust due to a nut allergy in the family, but they were not missed.  Thinking about making this again for another holiday dinner.  Excellent recipe.

I chose this recipe because of the crust, and it was heavenly! I see that I accidentally omitted the cornstarch and purposefully omitted the lemon, but the end result was fantastic so it must not have mattered. Not a fan of pumpkin pie, but I think I'll make this every year!

Delicious!  I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  Not too "pumpkiny" and the crust was so yummy!  I served it with a maple whipped cream  (1/4 C. real maple syrup and a little vanilla extract with whipping cream.)  Thanks for posting!

Wow, what a great cheesecake!  I didn't have all of the spices, so improvised using ginger, ground cloves, allspice, and cinnamon.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Fantastic!  I love that it's not too dense or heavy...just right.  The crust was really delicious with the ground nuts -- a nice twist on the usual graham cracker crust.  I am going to be making this cheesecake every Thanksgiving from this point forward!

This is my second time making this recipe. It was wonderful! It does seem like a daunting list of ingredients but it is definitely worth it. I did do like others suggested and make a ginger snap crust instead, which i think greatly improved the recipe. Also, I omitted the heavy whiping cream because I did not have any. It still was great. I would recommend this to anyone. My family dosen't even like pumpkin pie but they loved this.

Cooked and chilled but it still wasn't set. I would divide into two springforms next time as mine was pretty full. Flavor was wonderful.

Absolutely delicious!! I multiplied the crust by about 1.5x to make it nice and thick, and to be able to cover the sides. Everyone absolutely loved it, and other than adding more of the crust, I didn't change a thing. Would absolutely make again!

This was surprisingly easy. I thought it was going to take forever to put together and it did not so don't be scared by the ingredients or the process. It was very good, I did add extra spice.

I made this cheesecake for my friends in my card club and they loved it!!  This recipe is very easy and so very good. I did not change a thing. The pumpkin and spice flavor was just right. Not too strong. And the crust just may become the crust I use for all my cheesecakes. Thanks for sharing!

One word, AMAZING!!!
I loved this recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving, and even the family members who hate pumpkin ate it right up and complimented it. It was also very easy to make. I will definitely make this several times in the future :)

MMMMMMMM......!   This recipe was everything I hoped for and more!  I changed it around a little to make it a bit more healthy...I added sucanat into the crust instead of the sugars, then whipped pure maple syrup into the pumpkin mixture instead of sugar, and finally added 3T of honey with the cream cheese instead of sugar.  You would have never guessed it was a healthy version! I didn't have any mace (I don't think I've ever used the stuff), so I sprinkled in some nutmeg and added a bit of cloves too.  I baked it for about an hour and 10 minutes in a water bath, at 325.  Very good! It seems just slightly softer set than other cheesecakes, but after chilling overnight, quite solid, and that could have been my substitutions...this recipe is DEFINITELY going into my stash.  It was SOOOOO good!

Fantastic pumpkin cheesecake!  This cheesecake was gone in two days and has been demanded for every Thanksgiving henceforth.  I used cinnamon graham crackers because well, it just sounded good (and it was delicious)!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the spices.  I had a Pampered Chef Cinnamon Blend and tossed a couple of teaspoons of that in, in place of the spices.  Also, I served it with bourbon whipped cream.  Oh man!  Great stuff!

I tried this recipe for our Thanksgiving feast and followed it to the letter.  This was my second attempt at making cheesecake and it turned out great!  The ONLY thing that I wish I had done differently was how I baked it.  I read through many cheesecake reviews and found that someone suggested using a plastic roasting bag for the water bath to prevent water leaking in.  I used foil and I think some of the water leaked through, but it didn't really affect the cheesecake that much.  It might have made the crust a bit soggy, but the cheesecake itself was so good, so it really didn't matter.  After baking for the recommended 50 to 55 minutes, I just turned the oven off and left it for about 2 hours.  After that I transferred it to the fridge.  No cracks!  It actually looked like a professionally baked cheesecake!  The texture is smooth and creamy - and very rich.  This one is a keeper for sure!

This was my first attempt at pumpkin cheesecake, but it was not the first time that I have eaten it.  This recipe was good, but not my favorite.  I had to use nutmeg instead of mace, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I cooked it as directed, however in a water bath, and the results were a perfect cheesecake.  Try serving with homemade whipped cream with a touch of bourbon in it.

I have made this twice now. Both times it has been raved over. I always double the crust and use gingersnap cookies instead of graham cracker crumbs. I also substitute 1/4 tsp. cloves and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg in place of the 1/2 tsp. mace. Both times it has been great and will remain a staple in my dessert box. I highly recommend it. It does have lots of ingredients, but you really don't even notice once you get started, and the compliments you will get for it will make it totally worth it.

I've found that this recipe is even better if you substitute 1 cup of mild molasses & 1 cup of granulated sugar for every 1 cup of brown sugar.

This recipe is well worth it's lengthy list of ingredients.  I make it every year during the holidays, and I have to hide a piece for myself or else I won't get any.  I have never had a leftover slice in the five years I've been making it!

Oh my god! I have been making cheesecake since I was able to hold a spoon. This is the best recipe ever. I added the cheesecake frosting, that somebody mentioned in the reviews (THANK YOU!) and it was a hit at my in laws.
Oh and I used chocolate graham crackers. 
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I didn't find this recipe difficult at all.  I used my coffee grinder to grind the pecans for the crust.  Followed the recipe just as written for a nice result. Great holiday pot luck dessert.

Great as is! But once I had to substitute butternut squash for the pumpkin and it still turned out just as good. I've made this multiple times and it's always a hit.

I've been making this for Thanksgiving for about seven years and it's still sought after around the dinner table. The reviewers that suggest a water bath are spot on. My cheesecakes turn out much better now that I've been doing that. Also, I make 1/2 again as much of the graham cracker crust. I don't feel like this recipe gives you enough to form the side walls. To all those people that complain about the butter making the crust soggy, I'd suggest pouring the butter slowly while mixing. In the beginning I used to just poor the butter in and it really saturated a portion of the crust, leaving it pretty soggy. After cooking for 50 minutes I turn the oven off and leave my cheesecake in there. I restaurantuer suggested I do this, leaving it over night, and I like the end results. Between this and the water bath my cheesecake has become fluffier and more even.

This cheesecake was awesome! Although it does have a heavy load of ingredients, it's definitely worth the time you put into making it! It has everything you'd love in an autumn dessert and more! It's very light, and the flavors combine to make for a very rich dessert. I will be making this more often for our holiday family gatherings, and you should, too!

Amazing!!!  I used crushed gingersnaps for the crust, which complimented the flavor of the filling very nicely.

I made two of these today in preparation for Thanksgiving. The first one I went by the book on the first cheesecake. It didn't rise the way I had expected but with the addition of pumpkin I don't think it's possible to get it as fluffy as my usual cheesecake. The second cheesecake I used 1/4 cup flour instead of starch. Also the original recipe is a little two sweet so I only put 1/4 cup and 1 tbl. spoon instead of two into the cheesecake batter. This kept the balance of flavors in check and thickened up the batter nicely. It raised a little bit better and didn't shrink half as much when it cooled. Also only cook it 40 minutes. The pumpkin thins out the batter so you don't want to cook it the full 50 minutes. Give it a small shake, you'll know when it's ready. Hope this helps ;)

Awsome recipe. Accidentally got fat free cream cheese and wasn't sure how it would turn out...was so pleased it came out amazing! I increased the cornstarch amount by about a teaspoon and only baked for about 45 to 50 min. But I also used a 10 inch springform pan. Definitely a keeper recipe!

This was awesome! I made it for Christmas dessert instead of pumpkin pie and everyone loved it!  I followed what some people said about doing 1.5X the crust, and I would highly recommend that.  I also couldn't find mace so I just used nutmeg instead.
