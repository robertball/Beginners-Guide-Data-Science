We liked this a lot, especially with the usual added accompaniments (sour cream, green onions, avocado).  I think that next time I make this I'll cut up the chicken and go directly to cooking it in the margarita mix because it got kind of too dry by cooking it first.  By the time the margarita mix disappears, it leaves a yummy film all over the chicken.  I did add some pepper to the finished chicken.  Thanks for a great idea for quesadillas!

Just made these tonight and they had so much flavor!  I diced the chicken, covered it in margarita mix, and refrigerated over night.  When I cooked the chicken, I added fresh mix right in, along with the lime juice, lemon juice, garlic and I added citrus seasoning.  After I baked them, I topped with avocado and sourcream.  So good - will definitely make again!

Ok. I expected a stronger lime flavor. May  try marinating chicken overnight in the lime mixture.

The concept was good but the chicken was pretty sour. I sautéed onions and peppers to add to the chicken. Cheddar and Queso fresco added to the final tortilla  combinations. I thought it was good but the prep took more time than I thought it was worth.

This recipe was a cinch to make, but my chicken came out tasting a little too sour for our liking.  Maybe if I left out the lemon juice it would be more to my liking.  I was expecting more of a flavor from the margarita mix.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Excellent very flavorful.   I did change  the liquid part,I cut up frozen chicken and placed the margarita mix in plastic bag with chicken to thaw.When ready to cook , I strained the chicken over a bowl to fry the meat,then just followed recipe.

Tried it twice.  2nd time I used skinny girl margarita mix and would not recommend that unless you doctor it up a bit.

The chicken was so good it almost didn't make it to the tortilla. I seasoned chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder and browned it (high heat) in avocado oil before adding margarita mixture. I fried the Quesadillas (no oil) instead of baking them. I made Pico de Gallo to serve with it along with avocados...very good. Will definitely make again, I think the next time around I'll add  some sautéed onions and bacon to jazz it up a bit.
