Excellent soup and easy to throw together in a rush. The flavor is unbeatable. I did use half pumpkin and half butternut. Thank you for the recipe.

It was a little bland but okay. It was actually quite good cold, and then I served the rest like onion soup, hot with a thick layer of broiled  parm, and everybody loved it. Also , I gave it a shot of red pepper flakes.

This was quite a hit! We loved it. I didnâ€™t have enough squash so I used sweet potatoes to make up the difference. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I definitely recommend this one.

I made a few modifications to fit my diet needs: full fat Coconut Milk in place of the heavy cream, no onion at all, 4 cups of pumpkin I had already cooked instead of butternut squash. It is absolutely delicious!! I love the flavor of the pears and the creamy texture.

Excellent soup! And so easy in the Instant Pot! You may want to add a bit of pepper or other spice to amp it up a bit, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

This soup was delicious.  I used butternut squash and pumpkin and vegetable broth. I also added about 1 tsp fresh crushed ginger.  Mom dressed hers up with a big dollop of sour cream. I will make this again.
