This is an absolutely delicious cookie.  I can't make enough of them for my family and friends.  They disappear by the fistful!  Yummy!!!  I have also made them using the fruit used in fruit cake and dipping them in colored sugars for different holidays.

As a Brit i have to tell you although these are nice  "cookies", English Teacakes are not meant to be cookies, more roll like that is often toasted and spread with butter and jam ( jelly )
