I am the submitter of this recipe, and just wanted to note that I had written the recipe with the SPAM as sliced and sauteed, not cubed, and the bread as toasted in a toaster, not broiled. I had no idea how much they edited recipes! We still enjoy this recipe and make it regularly.

Quick, easy recipe. A little salty but I guess that's the spam. I sliced the spam instead of cubed it.

This will sustain you in poverty, depression, and war time, but itâ€™s about as good as eating baked beans cold from a can with a spork.

This was really good, and we don't even care for spam all that much. Toasted bread in toaster to make sure it toasted uniformly.
