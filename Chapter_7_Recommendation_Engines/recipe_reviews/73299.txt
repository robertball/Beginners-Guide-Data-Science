My son cannot have sugar this was the perfect substitute. Great texture fluffy - almost merringue-like. I put it on a wheat-free sugar-free birthday cake...it tasted awesome! (and all the party-goers had no idea it had no sugar!)

This was light and tasty. I know that Lila's post was in 2006 but there is no need to throw out a pan that has hardened sugar syrup in it. Put water in the pot place on the stove bring to a boil turn off and cover for 10 to 15 minutes. Empty the hot water carefully into the sink. The sugar should have dissolved and the pot is ready to wash.

finally found one that useI s real maple syrup and not artificial flavoring! I added a little vanilla. Tastes like a light maple marshmallow. I microwaved the syrup in a glass measuring cup/has no problems.Don't know why the first poster had to throw out the pan. At worst putting water in it and heating it should have dissolved off any stuck on stuff. As cookie or cake icing I give it a 3 to 4 but I did find a fab use for this stuff...it makes awesome whoopee pie filling!

This is the same recipe that my Great Aunt used. Fancy grade Vermont Maple Syrup has the best outcome. Be patient when boiling down the syrup it is worth the wait. A couple of changes; we use three egg whites and no salt. The third egg white ensures enough frosting for round cakes.

Nice flavor and texture. I used on an apple cake that is made with little sugar so the sweetness of the icing was welcome.

I ve made this at least a dozen times! It s sooo good! I also found if you spread it out on a silpat and bake it at 325 for 10 mins you get a delicious crispy maple meringue brittle! Cook the syrup in a heavy bottom pot. Non-stick coatings don t do well with hot sugar. Soak the pan after you ve cooked your syrup and you won t have any issues cleaning it!

After several failed attempts at getting stiffer peaks I gave up and that and tried to make sure the syrup was well incorporated. This was my first attempt at making icing and it was fairly easy. The flavor was so good and I can literally just eat the icing with a spoon and be happy.

This was surprisingly easy to make. It whipped up like magic and had a texture unlike anything I have ever had. Smooth and creamy. The flavour was amazing.
