This is the simplest appetizer EVER!!!! Best taste EVER!!!!! I just mix 8 oz cream cheese with 1/2 a tub of Bertolli pesto in the fresh pasta section. Slice a baguette thinly on the diagonal. Put the bowl of pesto in the center of a platter with some knives. Surround with the sliced bread. No fuss app that everyone loves.

My basil is growing like crazy in my garden so this was a perfect recipe to try.  I recommend using the “Easy Pesto” recipe on this website.   The only change I made was to bake them in individual dishes for ease in serving.  Be forewarned, this is addicting. So good.

In addition -- it was really easy to make!

I made a boo boo with this recipe. Had my 2 year old grandson here and saw the ingredients and just started mixing it up. Well it never would mix up right. He went home so I read the instructions and put it in the oven as it says. Turned out super yummy. Easy and I’ll never forget how to make it lol.

Went great with pita chips. Added some shredded parmesan to the top. Very good.
