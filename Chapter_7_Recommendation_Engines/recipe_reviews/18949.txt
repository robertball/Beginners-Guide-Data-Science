I had a candle party for the ladies. I made a huge punch bowl filled 3/4 the way and I still had to make a second batch. LOVED IT!

Tastes like a martini: subtle sour-lime style.

This recipe was okay. It's almost like a cosmopolitan with some lemonade added in. I would just as soon drink a cosmo but that's my preference.

Excellent summer drink. Just strong enough but light and refreshing. Didn't change a thing except used cran/grape juice because I don't like strait cran juice thanks
