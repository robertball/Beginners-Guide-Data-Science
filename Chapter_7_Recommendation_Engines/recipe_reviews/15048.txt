We made this cookie today in our shop and it turned out great.  We quadrupled the recipe and added a hand full of mini chocolate chips, mini butterscotch chips and a half cup of chopped candied cherries.  It was delicious and it made a beautiful cookie.  Our customers raved.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I think it's going to be one of our most requested.

This cookie has a very nice taste and texture.  It is more of a little banana nut muffin than a traditional cookie.  It is a nice change.  I got 4 1/2 dozen from the recipe.  The recipe said it only makes 2 1/2 dozen.  Mine were regular cookie size (about 1 rounded teaspoonful).  A bigger cookie might be more appropriate considering the cake like texture of these.  Overall they were good and I will proubaly make them again....especially when I have an abundance of bananas.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just got done making these. Pretty good but I'd call them mini-cakes rather than cookies...extremely soft. But tasty.
Being a nut lover but not mixed with my desserts I processed a jar of marischino cherries & drained them & added them instead of the walnuts.  I just wished I had added some chocolate chips as well.  Good cookie - will try it again for sure.

After reading reviews, I decided to bake this batter in my mini-bundt pan. I left out the nuts and cloves, because I didn't have either one. These came out lovely. I sprinkled the tops with butterscotch chips before baking, so they have a butterscotch "crust" in the bottom when you invert the pan. I see this recipe as having great potential for my creative muse.

Very good cookie... I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1/2 c. mini chocolate chips, 1/2 c. dried cherries and 1/2 c. chopped nuts. Next time I might add more mashed banana too. Nice to find an alternative to banana bread when you have over-ripe bananas!

This recipe is so easy!  To make it a true "Banana Split" cookie, I added chopped dried cherries and chocolate chips.  Delicious!

I am new to baking and will make these for my dance friends and family. Every one loved them. I frosted the cookies with cool whip and cut the cherry into a zig-zag line and they looked like easter eggs! That was what i was going for if you were wondering. I also added cholet chips in thecookie  mixture.                                      
At first, I thought 30 would be to much, but then I wrote down all the names & realized i might run short! So I did 40 anad 1 extra! Another for me! :)

I agree that these cookies are like mini banana bread, but very good. My daughter came home from school and devoured 4 straight away. What more can you ask for. Thankyou.

These turned out all right, but a little soggy.  I'm not sure if it was the recipe or something i did when i made them, but they weren't my favorite ever.

I was looking for a way to use old bananas other than making banana bread.  I chose these and they turned out very good, but they still tasted like banana bread, texture and all.  Next time I will try adding sherries and nuts and see if that makes them different.  They were good, just not different enough from regular banana bread.

I made these a couple nights ago.  They were tasty, but they reminded me of banana cake rather than a cookie.  I will probably make them again as they were pretty good. They reminded me of banana nut bread only bite size.

I found these cookies just so-so.  I anticipated that they had a cake-like texture and was looking forward to them.  They didn`t taste bad, but I found them a bit bland, even with the spices.  I will keep looking for another way to use my ripe bananas.  I also don`t think that the name suits them.  I did not find anything reminiscent of a banana split in these cookies.

Wonderful cookie! My house smells like fall. I made up a little pineapple drizzle to top some of the cookies with. Like little pieces of heaven.

These cookies taste delicious, however, are more like mini-cakes.  They are very soft- but overall a great recipe!

I loved this cookie!! It was amazing! The only difference I made was add vanilla extract instead of cloves and cinnamon. But all in all, it was pretty good!
