I loved the idea of this dish but thought the vegetables would be overlooked and mushy, so I skipped steaming them and roasted them at 400F for half an hour then poured the cheese sauce over and added the bread crumbs, which I mixed with a bit of cheese instead of all the extra butter.  I reduced the heat to 350 and baked about 20 minutes until the top was browned.  Thanks, Angela

Very tasty; just enough of a cheesy taste to make you wonder what the flavor is . . . I do think this made too much sauce; next time I will do half-again as many veges for the same amount of sauce.

I've made this multiple times; I even took it to Thanksgiving Dinner. It's always a big hit, whether it's for our household of 3, or for the 40 at Thanksgiving.

Very tasty.  I used fat free milk instead of the half and half.  Also, I used half light mozzarella and half javierino cheese.  I used dill seed and black mustard seed as well.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks

I followed the recipe exactly for the first time in my life.  I felt I boiled away much of the veggies nutritional value.  If there is a next time I’ll either stream, roast, or sauté them instead.  It was alright but not impressive

I use to make a version of this with chicken.....so I saw this recipe and used it on some rabbit (it work just as good on chicken).  It was delicious.  My modifications......I don't precook anything but the meat, I grind my vegs up with a food processor and add in 1/2 a small onion & a little peppers with a little heat, up the dill a little, use french onion dip instead of 1/2&1/2 and use just a 1/3 of a cup, I mixed my bread crumbs into the mix, used 1/2 the butter suggested, I also use chicken bullion powder instead of cubes.  I know...lots of changes.....but I never can leave a recipe alone.

The biggest change I made was add some diced garlic.  Everybody loved this and it was so easy.  I did cook the carrots in my waterless cookware so as not to lose any nutrients from boiling them.  I did not add any salt either.

I don't know why this isn't an insanely popular recipe because it's literally like crack. So delicious. I always follow the recipe exactly (sometimes I cut down on the boullion depending on the brand) and the result is an amazingly rich, slightly sweet, buttery dish of goodness. It's a bit rich to eat a big bowl of as a main dish, but goes great as a side for a chicken or fish.

I put too much zucchini in this, which was my mistake.  The zucchini came out kind of mushy and overpowering, but the rest was excellent.  I used Tillamook Cheddar cheese rather than colby-Jack.

This is so, so good and a big time family favorite! We make as directed and it always turns out great. My zucchini hating husband ADORES this recipe. And I can think of worse ways to get my boys to eat their veggies!

Didn't have cream so I just used milk. Probably cut down on the calories but not the taste. This was really yummy and a good way to use up the carrots from my garden.
