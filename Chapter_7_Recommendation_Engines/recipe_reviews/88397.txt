YUMMY. I honestly love anything that has nutella as an ingredient. Since hubby got me Tivo a while ago I have watched the Food Network religiously. Giada always used this stuff so I thought I would try it...now it is a staple in my pantry. Delicious...thanks for the post.

This was an interesting combo. I usually have bananas with almond butter and honey. I found that the almond butter over powered the nutella. But I'll try it again with more nutella.

I've been eating Nutella sandwichs since I was a teen and went to Germany. Now my three kids get this treat about once a week. When I was a skinny kid and not concerned about health and weight I added Doritos crunched in the middle of my Nutella sandwich! My kids get the bananas...
