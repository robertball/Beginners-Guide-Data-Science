We followed many of the steps taken by other reviewers. Instead of using water we used chicken stock & doubled all amounts to use as a main course vs. side dish. We also used frozen baby peas (I added them a couple of minutes before serving) This is one of the few times we used butter & it made a huge difference in the taste outcome. As others have said the red pepper flakes really compliment this dish - as does a good shave (or 2) of fresh parmesan cheese over the top. Quick easy & tasty!

This was kinda bland and needed seasoning. I used a different pasta and frozen petite peas. I added garlic and onion powder and a splash of olive oil. I also topped with parmesan cheese.

I thought this was excellent. I tripled it feed my family of four. It went great with grilled chicken. It was so simple and quick. I didn't have canned peas so I used frozen peas. The crushed red pepper gave it a good kick. We topped it with parmesan cheese everyone goggled it up!

What a quick and delicious side dish when you want something different. My husband isn't a pasta eater and he had 3 helpings. Thanks for helping me find something to do with those staple items in my pantry.

I added a little cornstarch with water red pepper butter and 1 can Chicken Broth. I also added mozzarella cheese and topped with parmesan cheese. Light flavor which is just what I wanted.

Quick and easy and I finally used that can of peas that has been in the cupboard for ages! I used a little more chicken stock and added freshly grated parm. I'll make this again if I'm in hurry (and in the mood for peas...)

I made this using 3 cups water 6 oz shell pasta and frozen peas. I ended up straining some of the water out as it was simply not cooking down and the pasta and peas were definitely done. I did add crushed red pepper doubled the butter and a hearty amount of grated parmesan cheese. The cheese got melty and stringy and this actually turned out well. We liked this and gave this dish a thumbs up! Thanks.

Not bad I used mini farfalle pasta and didn't follow the directions. I boiled the pasta in water then drained it and added the boillon granules (just a pinch) and the butter and peas. The kids liked it!!

Very good except cut down the red pepper flakes to about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon! My mouth was on fire! Luckily I paired it with the Breaded Turkey Breasts so it toned down the heat a little. Other than that DELICIOUS!

This was very good! I doubled it and my picky 5 year old loved it even though he picked out the peas.

I liked this but it seemed to be missing something. It was very easy though and I did forget about the pepper flakes so maybe that is what I was missing. I cooked a 1/2 box of farfalle and didn't measure the water and used about 3 Tbsp of butter for that amount of pasta.

Easy to make but I thought it was bland. It seems to need more seasonings. My family thought it was just ok. Probably would not make again.
