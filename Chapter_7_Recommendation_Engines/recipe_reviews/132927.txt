I tried this recipe last night.  It had a good flavor, but following the instructions almost to a T, the shrimp was overcooked and the sauce watery.  I will try it again (And this time remember to pick up fresh parsley first), cook the shrimp less initially since 20 minutes of baking would cook them through, and reduce the Vermouth to 1/2 cup.  I will also cook the tomato/ vermouth mixture until the tomato juices reduce some, too.

WHOA! By far this is the BEST shrimp dish I've had!!! DELISH!! I used fresh Roma tomatoes, and dried oregano, I also trippled the garlic!  I would also suggest if you want a bit more sauce, increase the vermouth.  I served it with pasta and garlic bread.  A WINNER IN MY BOOK! Thanks.

If you like feta cheese and shrimp, this is an excellent and easy dish to prepare.  I have my doubts about serving six people unless you include h'orderves, salad and bread.  Great quality meal.  I used a little more garlic than suggested, about three large cloves, and I used large cooked shrimp for ease.  Other than that I followed as prescribed.  You can also prepare the night before, just don't bake.  Pull it out of fridge and let it get to room temperature then bake till parts of feta just start to turn brown.  You must serve over orzo (must)!  I've made this several times.  Good luck. Top Notch.

This is my first review I have given, and I have used this site for over a year now to find my favorite recipes.  This recipe, with only a few additions & substitutions, is BY FAR the BEST shrimp dish I have ever found!!  I have made it on numerous occasions and I thought I would share how I perfected it for my boyfriend and my tastes - maybe you will agree:  I more than double the garlic; use about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of 1/4 tsp (we like spicy food in our house!); add some crushed black pepper (to taste); use a teaspoon (instead of 3/4 tsp) of dried oregano; substitute a tablespoon of DRIED parsley instead of fresh; use sliced roma tomatoes IN ADDITION TO the canned diced tomatoes (I like to use the cans that have basil, oregano, & garlic already in them); and I add a bag of fresh spinach to the vermouth and tomato mixture as it is cooking.  I usually broil the mixture in the oven for a few minutes before I take it out, just to brown the feta a little.  After it is finished baking, I serve this mixture over orzo (a wonderful suggestion I read)....it is absolutely delicious!!  Great Garlic Knots (from this site) go wonderfully on the side of this dish!!

Quite yummy!  I threw in some fresh spinach that I wanted to use up.  Added good color and vitamins.

This is excellent!  I did a few things different though.  I sauted some onions in the butter and then added the garlic.  I served it over orzo with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  So good!

What a great find! This is a delicious, easy to prepare dinner that would work for either a work day meal or company. I thought I had all the ingredients when I went to make the recipe, but didn't have a can of tomatoes, instead, I chopped up 1/2 fresh tomato and added it to half a 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. I cooked the tomato and sauce for 5 minutes in a saucepan, just to soften the tomato, before adding it to the reduced vermouth. Thanks for the recipe Laura.

I actually made this with chicken and it was excellent. I followed the recipe and just browned the chicken before I put it in the oven. I used more garlic and added Italian spiced tomatoes.  Can't wait to try this with shrimp!  Thanks.

It was very watery.  The recipes sounded good....but.   We used goat chesses instead of feta and it was the only thing I liked about this dish.  Cooking the shrimp for 20 minutes was WAY to long. The shrimp was like rubber

Fabulous!  The best shrimp dish I have ever made.   A few keys to a five star dish:  1. Don't cook the shrimp for five minutes otherwise it will be overcooked when you finish baking it. Cook the shrimp until it's light pink and then take it off the stove and out of the hot pan so it doesn't continue to cook. 2. Don't add salt; the feta has enough. 3. Cook the vermouth down then add the tomatoes and cook the tomato juices down as well otherwise it will be runny.  Baking will not evaporate the extra juices. 4. The feta won't brown but when it becomes heated throughout, it's done.  I also used dried parsley because that's what I had on hand and it worked great.  This is a definite keeper.  This recipe is so simple yet an impressive date night recipe.  UPDATE:  I made this again using overly ripe cherry tomatoes and it is so much more elegant.  The fresh parsley and tomatoes make it look like an expensive restaurant dish.

It tastes good, but I wish I'd have read the reviews before I started.  I would have cooked the shrimp less.  I didn't get any Orzo, but I put it over Jasmine rice, and it was just fine.  Served it with Stouffer's creamed spinach.  Oh, I cooked it at 350 for 10 minutes and then broiled for 5 more minutes.  I also had sprinkled a little Parmasan cheese on it before cooking.  The feta did brown after all.

I feel bad about giving this 4 out of 5. We really liked it just as written but it could easily be so much better with some tweaking. Mine came out with a lot of liquid after baking. I wish I had drained the canned tomatoes and used less vermouth (I did reduce it to half). I also think it needs more feta cheese and something else to give it more flavor. Maybe more herbs or red pepper or maybe sliced kalamata olives would work. I'll definitely make this again, with some changes.
Like most of the reviewers, I served it over orzo pasta and that was perfect for this.

We really loved this dinner.  I used both one can of diced tomatoes and a container of grape tomatoes-halved.  I increased the vermouth slightly to have more sause.  I also added more feta because we love it so much.  I also made it with 2 pounds of large shrimp and served it over orzo...loved the orzo/feta/tomato combination!

Got my 1st iphone, downloaded the allrecipes app and used it to cook this recipe for dinner the same night! Loved it, it had great flavor. Like some other reviewers, I made a few minor changes. Using what I had on hand, I used dried parsley and fresh tomatoes. I had to sub the vermooth for white wine, but it still tasted terriffic! I served it along side a fresh spinach salad. It reminded me so much of shrimp scampi the way I made it that next time I will serve it over pasta. Fab app and website that I will continue using. Thanks for the recipe!

This was runny, shrimp is tough .  I only cooked for about 25 minutes.  Cheese hadn't even started to brown.  Can't imagine what this would have been like if I had cooked until golden.

I have made this twice now. The first time I made it exactly as it was written and served over linguine noodles - it was wonderful! The next time I added diced green pepper and diced onions at the same time as the garlic. I cooked until soft. I found I was out of feta and so used grated parmesan. Served over rice and it was a wonderful and filling dinner. Kids liked it better with parmesan (they aren't fans of feta!). Highly recommend as a quick and filling meal!

Wonderful! I made this for my boyfriend's birthday, because he loves shrimp. Two of his friends came over and ate with us. They all LOVED it! I served over coucous and used white cooking wone b/c I couldn't find vermouth. I can't wait to try it again with the real ingredients.

Absolutely delicious and I am P-I-C-K-Y.  Not a picky eater so much but more like a food snob - I do not like a lot of processed food, casseroles, etc.  I like fresh, easy and delicious.  This is awesome and I followed the recipe to a T! Very easy and quick to make if you use bagged, peeled and deveined shrimp.  I also served over orzo pasta and it was P-E-R-F-E-C-T!  For the people who said it was runny or had too much sauce...yes it was runny but we felt all that good thin sauce was just excellent with the orzo.  Served in a bowl, but don't throw that away - it is what makes it!  I also think you could use vodka if you didn't have vermouth.

I agree with many others that the sauce was runny. ...  But the first time I make a recipe from this site, I do like to make it as it is written.  Which I did.  We served it over Orzo.  And we just used a slotted spoon for dishing out the shrimp/feta/tomato bake.  We loved it! .....  It is a recipe we will make many more times.  We will probably tweak more to our family's tastes, but as written, it was delicious!  Thank you for this one!

Wasn't really sure about this recipe but decided to try it. I'm not a big vermouth fan but I'm tired of the same old grilled shrimp and was looking for something totally different. Very, very good! I only cooked the shrimp about 3 minutes in the pan so the shrimp wouldn't be overdone. I doubled the garlic and used fresh herbs. This will be a regular in our house from now on.

What an easy, elegant meal! Fit for any night of the week--yet a wonderful recipe you could serve to guests! I followed the ingredients of the recipe--using fire roasted diced tomatoes. Such amazing flavor! I sauteed the shrimp about 1.5 minutes on each side...slightly undercooked. Then baked for 15 minutes; much longer and you risk overcooking the shrimp. Served on top of orzo with "Baked Zucchini Chips" and fresh fruit. Yum! It really is an impressive looking dish!

Lots of flavor! Unless your taste buds are dull you will only need a regular serving to get your fill of this dish. This is a special treat and not something I'd make often since their is so much flavor. But it is so good that I may not be able to pass it up for the next special dinner.  It's a wonderful departure from the typical shrimp and noodles or scampi dishes out there. Next time I may try it bruschetta-style.

This is so delicious and easy to prepare.  It is light and fresh.  I used fresh roma tomatoes and more feta  cheese and served it with orzo pasta.  My guests loved it and all wanted to recipe.  Thanks so much!

This was really good!  I used rice pilaf instead of orzo b/c my grocery store doesn't carry it. I think it was really flavorful but next time I will use fresh tomatoes as someone suggested and more feta.  I don't think I used enough and it wouldn't brown on the top. But overall this recipe was very tasty!

I tried this and wasn't as impressed as some. I used sweet vermouth but don't think it was because of that. It was good but I can't say great. Not sure would make again because there is so many great recipes you can put shrimp into.

I made this dish on vacation for my best friend and her husband, and we ate every bit! I put the shrimp raw into the oven, as sauteeing them would have overcooked them. Awesome recipe - thanks!!!

This is a very tasty and satisfying dish!  I tweaked it by adding finely diced celery & onions to the sauteeing butter & garlic. I also doubled the oregano & added basil. Lastly, I ran out of vermouth & substituted dry sherry. I love this dish & it's become a staple at our house!  Thanks!

We enjoyed this, and it couldn't have been easier to make.  It took more time to peel the shrimp than anything else.  Like other reviewers, I thought the sauce was a bit too juicy, so I boiled down the tomato-vermouth mixture until it was almost dry.  I would normally serve this with pasta, but since we had pasta last night, I just served it with hot pugliese bread.  Wonderful for soaking up that yummy melted feta sauce!

Fabulous recipe and so easy to do ahead! Great for a big crowd bc it keeps in the casserole dish till ready to bake.  I switch the order and start with the butter garlic then tomatoes so my tomatoes can cook down a bit, then add the shrimp for the last 5 minutes so they don't overcook.  I also skip the vermouth and red pepper so my kids can enjoy.

This is an amazing dish for how easy it is to make.  I served the entire meal over orzo.  I usually don't like any leftovers with seafood/shellfish, but this was still delicious the next day.

Great basic recipe. I did make a few changes. I sautéed olive oil, onions and garlic in a cast iron skillet. Added oregano, crushed red pepper, basil and Italian parsley, then tomatoes. Let tomatoes reduce by half (important if you don't want a watery dish). Layered shrimp, a drizzling of honey and the feta cheese. Served with a spinach salad, saganaki (flaming cheese, Opa!) and honey wheat pitas. Not a crumb left. It was fabulous. Will definitely be making again.

I made Major Points with my BF with this dish. I followed the recipe steps, just made a few ingredient changes to suit our tastes: reduced the butter to just what I needed to saute; tripled the garlic, doubled the oregano, added a little red onion and used both fresh diced tomatoes and the can of tomatoes. Used feta with meditranean spices, prob double the amt. Did not cook the shrimp all the way and added artichokes before it went in the oven. Next time I add mushrooms too! this was so yum.

I opted to replace the butter with olive oil and leave out the vermouth. I also drain the tomatoes so it doesn't turn out so watery. It was great! It a new go to recipe. I serve it with steamed broccoli.

I've made this several times and it always tastes great! I'm not crazy about oregano, so I leave it off and just add more garlic. We never have any leftovers!
