Very nice caramel sauce, but a word of caution.  Once you stop stirring, don't walk away from the stove, watch it VERY closely because mine turned dark amber within 30-45 seconds.  Also, do use a larger pan (as Chef John recommends in his video)  because when it starts to bubble, it climbs up the saucepan.  I could tell from the smell of the smoke that it was well on its way to burning...but it didn't, thankfully.  Will thicken up after refrigeration, giving you a beautiful, rich,  and decadent caramel sauce.

The heavy saucepan is a must for this recipe. Follow this recipe exactly as the video instructs and you'll not be sorry. The finished sauce thickens nicely and goes great with apple slices or ice cream. The flavor reminds me of caramel corn from the beach. Wonderful!

My first time making caramel sauce.  I had no idea it was so easy and the results so amazing.  I followed the instructions in the video exactly and had excellent results.  It took less than 30 seconds of boiling without stirring for my sauce to reach the desired color.  Added salt to suit my taste since I'm always complaining about all these salted caramel things you buy that you can never tell are salted.  Awesome recipe, thanks!

The flavor is so amazing (WATCH the video) for the ease in creating this sauce.  It is exactly what I've been thinking of since Junior High Foods Class when we learned about the chemical changes taking place in cooking methods of certain foods.  While my sons were board with my 'back in day' story, they were thrilled to enjoy this caramel sauce over sliced apples after school the other day.  This sauce is so versatile!  I froze some to make the kids Slo-Pokes for when they got home from school yesterday.  Today, I am making some pretzels so that they can enjoy the caramel that way, as well.  Oh, and with my 1/2cup of Birthday Bash ice cream last night, the caramel was the BEST part of the Bash.  Yes, it is very tasty on apples, but I'm not one for limits in the kitchen.

I like this recipe a lot, though I had some initial trouble because it appears that my stove is hotter than that which the recipe creators is. I put this on medium high heat and I burned the caramel. I put it on Medium heat, and I got verrrrryyyy smokey caramel. Now I have it somewhere in between Medium and Medium Low and it's worked perfectly. Tastes delicious.

I tried this recipe for the first time this morning.  It didn't take very long for the sugar to turn to dark amber.  It was still fairly bitter so I added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla and that took care of the problem.  I also added a little more salt that was called for - about 1/2 tsp (I like my salted caramel to taste a little bit salty).  Super easy and very tasty!

Made this caramel sauce over the holidays to use in or on two different recipes, one of which is the Caramel Macchiato Cheesecake recipe also from this site.  I never knew that caramel sauce was so easy to make....the video is very helpful.  I will never buy a jar caramel sauce again.

Making this sauce takes some concentration, but in the end, it's worth it!  Sweet, thick, salty...  It's perfect for an ice cream topping or even drizzled over the whipped cream on top of an iced coffee!  The sauce should NOT by any means taste bitter.  (If it is, you've cooked it too long.)  Keep a close eye on it and make sure you don't let it get too dark.  Well worth the effort.

I was so not thrilled with this recipe.  Chef john makes it look really easy. But the flavor is not sweet and its a pain to make. It solidifyed to my spoons and whisk...it was everywhere.

I made it today. It looks very easy and I've made caramel sauces before that are quite good as well. Just a word of caution, DON'T let it get too dark or too smokey. My first batch was bitter because I let it get very dark like on the video. I made it a second time and it turned out delicious, I just didn't wait for it to smoke. I think that's too long to wait. But good job Chef John.

I think the heavy cream is integral to this recipe; and I think it definitely has to be close to room temp. I tried this with milk from the fridge in its place and all of the ingredients were like NOPE in the pot, and even the butter slinked out and floated on top. It would still bubble but never got hot enough to re-incorporate. Now, this wasn't bad in the least, because I was making it to incorporate into a cake filling and no one could tell. I think my original strategy for the filling was a bit off, but for a lovely caramel custard just use milk instead of cream and nearly double the amount. Once you've taken it off the heat, just add in a whole egg and whisk whisk whisk! It should become a "pudding" in due course -- you may want to strain it to rescue some scrambled egg bits but then you have a lovely caramel custard for all your cake-filling needs. :D Happy accidents are the best! (I will definitely use this recipe as a base for that custard again. Also, I will give this another stab once I have cream.)

I was good, but it's not necessary to stair the sugar until it begins to melt, save your arm some time. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and it was perfect. To those who said it was bitter, perhaps you had sugar built up on the side of the pot or it was just cooked too long?  I would use a pastry brush to brush any loose sugar that finds its way up the side back into the pot to prevent this.  If you use a candy thermometer bring it to 345 (really 350, but -5 for carryover cooking) and remove it from the heat.

my stove top must be hotter than the chef's...first batch...burned.  It was the dark amber color like in the pic but was burnt sugar, bitter tasting.  2nd batch cooked lower and slower and it's lighter in color (aka not burned)but still has a slight bitter taste to it. Is it supposed to be bitter tasting?  I've only had the store bought stuff so can't compare.

Delicious! Although not as easy as I'd hoped. Like many others, my first batch burned - I didn't know that at first, but it did taste a little bitter. So I tried again, lower & slower. And Eventually I got the butter & cream incorporated - with NO bitter taste. (Yay, me!) So that's your clue - if it's bitter, you burned it. Sorry. Thanks, Chef John for making me get back on that horse!

Had the same trouble as some other reviewers, burned the first batch following the written directions, so then read reviews and watched video twice and second batch tasted awful too. So then really lowered the temperature below medium and it turned out ok.  My granddaughter said it was great. Might try it again just because I don't want a recipe to defeat me!  I make caramels a lot and expected it to taste like that, only softer. But it has a different flavor, not as sweet and creamy.

Very rich and buttery. I overcooked it the first time, so it was a little too dark, but second time turned out great.  Its not quite sweet enough for my husband.

I need Chef John to make this for me!  Kind of freaked me out and the first batch I burned, so keep in mind how well your pot holds heat.  I have a very heavy cast iron pot which I used both times.  The first time I follwed instructions completley.  The second time as soon as the sugar melted, and was still light in color,  I moved to a different burner.  Did not take long from there for the sugar to turn dark and smoke then I continued as directions say.  I'm making a apple crisp cheesecake which I will use this on top of...If there is still some left come Thanksgiving day!  Also, as someone who has never tried homemade caramel and am use to the bottle at the store kind.  The flavor on this can't be compared.  Don't expect the store, overly sweet stuff.  This has a little bitter bite to it.  I added about 1/2 tsp vanilla at the end to lighten that up a bit.

It's great - just DO NOT EVER walk away from the stove. This recipe is more about taste and eyeing than exact timing, everyone's pots are a little different.

I just made this sauce after watching the video twice (Chef John has a very soothing voice), and reading thru all the reviews. I was a tad apprehensive as a few people reported that their sauce tasted bitter. Well, mine came out GREAT! So yummy, a tad sweet yet salty. 
I used my large enamel cast iron dutch oven, that has a bisque-colored enameled interior. I had the gas slightly more than medium as I feel these cast iron pans retain heat very well. At first during the whisking, the sugar seemed as though nothing was happening. Then it started clumping into little chunks of sugar, but still remained white. I kept whisking and checking the clock. Soon enough the sugar began melting and changing in color from a clear to very light yellowish to light amber with no sugar chunks remaining. I stopping stirring/whisking, and watched the sugar until I saw little wisps of smoke coming off of it - I did swirl the liquid sugar a few times like Chef John, just lifted the pot a bit and swirled. Once it appeared to have darkened in color a bit, I took it off of that burner and onto another - whisked in the butter until incorporated, then the heavy cream. I had no French salt, so I sprinkled a bit of Himalayan pink sea salt (Trader Joes) into the caramel, mixed that in and tasted. WOW! Not bitter at all, just sweet enough without being overpowering. I am washing out my equipment and making another batch straight away to give as a gift. TY Chef John! Ciao Smuckers.

It was a mess to make and to be honest, not that great, in my opinion.  Too bitter.  I prefer the caramel sauce from the recipe "Almond Cupcake with Salted Caramel Buttercream Frosting" from this site.  Easier and tastier.

I just whipped up my first batch of this salted caramel sauce, and it's exactly what I was hoping it would be. It's thick, dark amber colored, it's sweet and salty, and right now it hasn't quite cooled yet and I'm about to enjoy it over ice cream. I followed the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing.

I highly recommend watching the video before making this. Even for experienced cooks this was a little tricky. I ended up just slightly burning the sauce, and some of the sugar clumped together. Despite all this the taste was still very good. After watching the video I realized what I had done wrong - not letting all the chunks dissolve completely before stopping stirring. Also the recipe is a bit off for the timing of here 3-8 minutes. I let mine sit un stirred for 3 minutes and came close to burning It. However, it was a fast easy recipe for a delicious sauce, so I will try it again and hopefully it will be even better!

Amazing! I've made this many times now and I don't wait around for it to turn a darker shade of amber.  That's because the first time I tried, I waited. And the sugar continued cooking after I removed it from heat and I got bitter caramel with the 30 seconds waiting. Usually by the time my sugar melts completely in my pan, it's a light amber. I kill the heat and grab the butter, and that 30 seconds seems enough to get it to the right state of caramelization. I guess different pans behave differently so watch the color carefully.

Amazing!  I can't believe something I made tastes this delicious. I ruined the first batch because my enamel cast iron pot was bigger than the burner, and the sugar crystallized on the edges.  I tried breaking it up with my spatula, but ended up with bits of silicone in the sauce.  Moved to high-sided sauce pan and the second batch turned out great.

I burned the first batch by tryiing to match the deep molasses color in Chef John's video.  The trick appears to be to watch for the wisps of smoke, not the color.  If the sugar boils, it's toast.  It will taste bitter and burned.  Take it off the heat the second you see the vapor.  The second time around it turned out terrific!  I used it over pretzel brownies.

A fabulous recipe which made for a delicious caramel sauce! Pouring it over my homemade brownies I served it to my friends, the whole thing was gone within maybe 10 minutes, spending the last 5 purely eating the caramel sauce out of the pan. Will definitely be making this again as it vamped up my brownies from delicious to heavenly and was great on its own also! :)

This is delicious!  I can just eat it alone its so good.  I did watch the video which helped, but I would recommend that you take the sauce off the heat almost imeediately after the first small wisp of smoke--not 3-8 minutes!.   Otherwise you burn the sugar and it becomes bitter.

It probably would be good, but you can''t follow the timing and temp in here at all. With my gas stove at medium high, the sugar was turning brown well before it was all melted, and I couldn't get the temperature back down enough for it to cook long enough to fully develop flavor. Had a burnt tang to it and I had to throw it out. I'd try these ingredients again using my own good sense for timing and a lower temperature, but this recipe shouldn't assume every saucepan and burner is the same.

Very tasty! It took me two tries to get it right though. I've never made caramel sauce starting with DRY sugar before, so it took a bit of experimentation to get the burner temperature right. Evidently my burners heat higher than Chef John's, because medium to medium high in less time that he indicated gave me burned sugar--not just amber. (And that amber stage comes VERY quickly after the sugar has melted too.) The second time I watched only temperature and ignored time, as well as turning my burner down to medium low, and it worked perfectly. I had to put it back on the burner just for a minute to get the butter fully incorporated though. Still, great-tasting sauce once you get the process down!

My salted caramel sauce was DELICIOUS and so easy to make! I halved the recipe as I only needed enough to drizzle on whipped cream so I used my heavy-bottomed stainless steel skillet vs a saucepan & it worked well. Would have needed a saucepan for the full recipe, I'm sure. It is a WONDERFUL recipe. Thanks for posting it!

I removed the sugar from the heat once it was melted and added the butter and stirred while still off the heat source. While the pot was off the element I also reduced the heat to medium. I put the pot back on the element and stirred in the heavy cream, letting it summer for around a minute. Then I added sea salt and a dash of vanilla. No bitter or burned taste! Delicious, thanks for the recipe!!

Oops... Submitted my other review prematurely. I found this sauce very bitter, and not very enjoyable. I cooked the sugar for about 5 minutes less, and t was much better. I don't recommend cooking the sugar until it reaches the "dark Amber" color, and rather just melting it and turning a lighter Amber.

I made this sauce to go with the Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies recipe I also made. Both were delicious. The only change I made to the brownies was to eliminate the chocolate chips. Also, on this sauce recipe, is there a difference between the heavy cream and the heavy whipping cream called for in the recipe? If so, I didn't understand the difference so I just used heavy whipping cream. It did seem to take a long time for the sugar to start melting and I fought the temptation to turn up the fire. Glad I didn't though because I think the sugar would have scorched. Turned out perfect though!

AWESOME!!!! I followed the recipe as written and it turned out great. One other reviewer stated the it stuck to her spoons. I used a silicone based spoonula (spoon/spatula) and didn't have that problem. I only used the spoonula and no whisk since my whisk is metal and was afraid of it sticking. Can't wait to have this over my homemade vanilla ice cream (also Chef John)

Delicious.  I didn't like the look of such a dark sauce as in the photo, I made mine the traditional camel-caramel color.  Followed the recipe and the video instructions.  I ended up with a few hard bits, like caramel candy, in the sauce so I put the pot back on the stove at a very low temp for a few minutes and it soon melted back in fine.  I'll be making this again for sure.

My first homemade caramel sauce recipe!  I really liked it, though my stove might have been too hot; it took way less than 8 to 10 minutes to turn amber, and it does have a slightly burnt flavour, but in the same way creme brulee tastes.  Plus the leftover whipping cream can be whipped for added toppings! I will definitely make it again.
p.s. I used it on my apple mincemeat crisp!  Yum!

I needed a caramel sauce quickly as company was on its way. Most recipes I found used brown sugar, but I wanted one with white sugar and whipping cream. This was so easy to make and was exactly what I was looking for - a perfect sauce for ice cream and to drizzle over cakes. Like others, it didn't take long for the sugar to turn amber after all the chunks dissolved - maybe even less than 30 seconds … although I did use a large sauce pan. Thanks for sharing!

Total WOW factor!  I made this for my son's wedding.  I put it on carrot cake with Carmel whipping cream and drizzled it over the cake and whipped cream and it was fabulous.  The only thing I did different was to use vanilla bean sea salt that I purchased at my local grocer.  A total hit and I felt like a pro!  Thanks Chef John  for making me a star!

I made this caramel sauce to drizzle over a chocolate cake.  I have never made caramel before and felt confident after watching Chef John's video several times.  After the third botched attempt the fourth was the charm.  First, I had too small of a pan.  Use a large pan!  The next two times I burned it.  It went from a light amber to a burnt, smelly, dark amber mess in a matter of SECONDS.  Adding the butter once the sugar is melted will increase the temp. and change a medium amber mixture to being burnt. My suggesting is completely ignore the suggested cooking time and go by the color.  By the fourth attempt I pulled the caramel off of the heat when it was a light to med. amber color then added the butter.  Then once the butter is melted I added in the cream and stirred until it was creamy.  Super taste, but a bit stressful!

I followed exactly as the video, although I probably could have cooked the sugar longer to a darker amber, but the smell of sugar possibably burning made me stop. To turned out wonderful. Easier then I anticipated.

I just made this recipe, it's the first time I've ever attempted a homemade caramel sauce. It's amazing how delicious it is considering how easy it was. Very rich, very buttery, and the perfect consistency. I glazed brown sugar banana-nut muffins with it, but I can't wait to try it on ice cream.

Needed some caramel for my ice cream. Very easy to do just copy the video.  Very smooth and creamy good over ice cream and apples so far. I added a 1/2 tsp of Mexican vanilla.

wow! it worked just like chef jon said! looked pretty scary at the bubbly stage, but the end result is amazing! i used a heavy cast iron skillet so i worried about burning the sauce since the pan gets so hot. i'm glad i did because the color is perfect and it was big enough to contain the bubbles. thanks!!

This sauce is so delicious and very easy to make! Do Not attempt unless you have a heavy bottomed pan! It will scorch very easily!

Fantastic easy tasty sauce.  Mild yet just what is needed. I did two pinches of sea salt and it was NOT very salty, so adjust accordingly based in how salty you want this (based on what you are paring it with)

Holee Molee is that good!! Watched the video, twice just to be sure, and then followed the directions exactly as Chef John said ... A-M-A-Z--I-N-G! I will never buy store bought Salted Caramel Sauce again! Chef John knocks another one right out of the park!

Followed recipe exactly. Very bitter. Took Another reviewer's suggestion & added some vanilla to cut the bitterness. Didn't help much. Even drizzling it over apple crisp & vanilla ice cream it was still bitter. Definitely won't make it again.

Excellent Caramel Sauce! I used this recipe as my second attempt to make caramel sauce since the first recipe I tried did not come out as expected. This is absolutely delicious. Timing on my stove was different than stated in recipe. Pay attention to the color and the smell and not to the clock.

This recipe is perfect. I watched the video and didn’t change a thing. I was worried about the pot and whisk I used because it had burnt hard sugar that had to be removed. I boiled a big kettle of water and let it sit for about 15 min till it dissolved... then I washed it as normal.

Delicious! My first batch got a bit too dark and tasted slightly burnt, so I take it off the heat while there's still a few chunks to melt. The heat of the melted sugar will continue to melt the chunks for a while.

I tried twice. The first time was definitely burned, and I only cooked it about 2 minutes as apposed to the 3-8 stated in the recipe. The second time I barely let it boil one minute. It looked better but tasted very bitter and not edible. Disappointing to waste so much time and ingredients.

I love this sauce! It takes close watching. And I don't like the flavor of my sauce quite as complicated as Chef John, so I don't let it sit as long. Sometimes complicated means tastes burnt. At least that's what my family thinks.

I made this recipe and found using my enameled cast iron pot made the mixture swirl smoke and turn amber brown just as the first ten minutes were up. I have a glass cooktop and know it is a hot burner so I had it set to med.  (wished I had a gas stove) so that maybe why.  So, I took it off the burner waited 30 seconds, added the butter (didn't bubble) added the cream once the butter melted. The mixture cooled to fast so I couldn't incorporate the cream well and sugar seized up. Put back onto the burner and stirred like crazy. Then after a short time with no luck, I turned the burner to the lowest setting and continued to stir. It finally started melting and incorporating. It has a wonderful deep almost toffee flavor. Will be drizzling onto the apple cheesecake recipe. Here's hoping....think I just need to practice

I love this recipe! This is my second year making it for my family and friends at Christmas. I just double the recipe and it makes 3 -8 ounce mason jars full. Everyone raves!

Made no changes, but I learned to slow down after burning batch #3. You CANNOT rush good food. Take time preparing it and enjoy time eating it. I've used it as a fruit dip but will try it over a slice of apple pie.  Soooo good!

Excellent sauce.  1.  Didn't like the bitter taste in the first batch, so for batch#2, took off the heat soon after all the crystals liquified, the color was turning "caramelly", but before it reached the smoke point.
2.  Added more cream than called for, also a half tsp vanilla.
3.  Big mistake - added cream WAY too fast.  If you are making gravy, that is an easy fix, but with sugar, it turns it to rockcandy!  Had to keep it over a low heat and whisk it for a LONG time to get it incorporated.  .
In the end, though, delicious.  Great recipe, never knew it was so easy and so much cheaper to makke my own caramel sauce.

I used this sauce on a Salted caramel apple cheesecake + it was spectacular!  I had numerous requests for the recipe as well as complements + had VERY little to take home for family to try.  Definitely a keeper!  Also, a LONG wooden spoon to stir to prevent burns on the HEAVY pan...

First thing you need to know about this recipe is PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT! The first time I made this, I overcooked the sugar and it smelled wonderful but tasted so bitter! I tried again in a stainless steel pot so I could see the color better and took it off the heat sooner and it came out great! My kids raved and ate half the batch along with every green apple we had in the house. Don't give up if it doesn't work the first time. Chef John makes it look very easy, but really this is something you have to learn how to tailor to your own tastes. Next time I will try a splash of vanilla. Thank you for the share, Chef John!

fantastic and very easy. My suggestions: Use a white coated pan, it helps better understand the color and the right moment. be prepared cause the golden moment only laast a few seconds and it is easy to miss it.

This is very tasty. Make as directed, it does thicken up, and may be too thick for ice cream topping, I added 1-2 Tbl. additional cream plus 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  super!  Makes a nice fondue sauce for dipping fresh fruit and cake squares.

This caramel sauce is easy and tastes amazing! I put it on top of my cheesecake with dark chocolate and it was to die for! Thank you for the recipe.

turned out great for our caramel brulee cupcakes, though one word of advice is to be careful to add the butter while your melted sugar is still a clear amberish rather than a cloudy amber, I added mine just a hair to late and it had a slightly darker taste than I would have liked :/ all. in all though this was FANTASTIC!!!

Decidedly bitter. Added more vanilla and salt which helped somewhat, but don't think I will be including this in my gift baskets as planned.

Your cooking time will be much shorter if you use a conventional sauce pan. Making caramel takes only a few minutes! It's quick and easy and oh... so good! Try it!

Yea! Chef John, once again you've managed to put one in the winner's circle, (sorry, horse racing is the only sports metaphor that I indulge in); it was sumptuous.  I feel certain that you are married, but do you have a brother who cooks like you do?

Once the sugar melted it went really fast!  Definitely less than the time on the recipe, but I caught it in time and it was great.  Perfect amount for two small jars of sauce. Hostess gift for tonight, check!

I read the recipe carefully, watched the video twice, followed all the directions and made the recipe two times ina  row. Both times it came out terrible. It was so bitter we couldn't eat it. The first time I thought maybe the sugar got burned so I tuned down the heat and took it off much earlier the next time and it was still terrible. What a disappointment!

Absolutely the best. I whipped it up to drizzle over a boxed spice cake because I was too lazy to make it from scratch and it has to be one of the best toppings I've ever had.
Chef John- no blasphemy! Its better than hot fudge.

My go-to salted caramel recipe.  After I make it, I pour it over a pan of chocolate brownies and let it get all gooey.  My daughter asks for this every year for her birthday!

This recipe is to die for!  Definitely watch the video to get a better sense of colour etc as it's cooking, but this sauce seriously is delicious and goes with everything from fresh fruit to cheesecake.  Mmmmm!
