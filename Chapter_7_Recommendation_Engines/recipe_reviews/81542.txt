Very Good....and SO easy to make.  I used a whole tail piece of salmon and not individual filets which worked out nicely (less individual stuffing, cutting etc).  I cut a small slit through the entire length of the tail and almost to the back of the fish, creating a nice pocket.  I stuffed the herbed goat cheese & packed it down.  I then salt & peppered the the top of the fish & made a mixture of light mayo, dijon mustard, parmesan cheese & bread crumbs.  Baked on a foiled lined baking sheet (sprayed) at 350 for approx 15+ minutes, then turned on the broiler and broiled just for a minute or 2 to get the top crust nice & brown.  WOW!  Delicious!  And incredibly easy.  Serve is with couscous and it might be the easiest & most delicious meal you'll make all week.

This was an easy to make recipe - yet quite an elegant presentation. I used plain goat cheese; sliced off pieces and rolled them in dried dill weed (fresh would be good too, but I didn't have any on hand) before stuffing the salmon fillets. I made my own blend by combining 1 tbsp each of Dijon mustard and light mayonnaise - which was plently to spread on top of the fillets. Before baking, I put more dill on the mustard-mayo topping. A definite make again.

Good dish.  A few changes I would suggest..1.)cut back on the mayo-dijon atleast by half.  2.)add back plain dijon mustard to make up for what you took away.  3.) thicker salmon works better, you can make a nice hole to stuff the goat chesse in about every inch or so. 4.)  put some goat chesse on top as well, it well brown up just like the picture.  Enjoy.

Goat cheese and salmon, who would have guessed?  This was delicious!  I did make a LOT of changes to make it more to my taste and healthier.  First, I used plain goat cheese.  I also chopped some fresh spinach and added that with the goat cheese as part of the stuffing.  I don't like mayo, and I was a little skeptical about the mustard/goat cheese combo, so I made my own sauce by whisking together juice from one lemon, 1 tbsp olive oil, and dried dill.  After stuffing the fish, I salted and peppered it and poured my sauce over it.  It came out juicy and delicious!  I plan to make this for my future in-laws when I go to visit in a few weeks.   I think they will be impressed!

Tired of the pseudo teryaki recipes that dominate salmon recipes, I tried this one and was pleasantly surprised. Didn't have herbed goat cheese, so I mixed in plain with basil, thyme and ROSEMARY (the best) along with some sun-dried tomatoes. Coated the salmon with mayo-mustard just enough so it was barely covered, and the result was juicy and yummy!

I combined this recipe and the one listed for Wrapped Salmon.  I used squares of puff pastry dough to wrap the salmon fillets after stuffing them with the feta cheese.  Used garlic and herb cheese and omitted the  mayo topping.  Made a quick sauce using: 1/2 c mayo and 1/2 c sour cream and added dill weed, salt and pepper to taste.  Thank you for the idea to use feta cheese - its my favorite way to prepare salmon now! :)

This was really good. Next time I make it I'll add some dill for more flavor and color. I also might try broiling it for a minute at the end to get the top to brown like in the picture. Thanks.

The goat cheese is a nice match for the salmon, though very rich. Thicker pieces will work best for this dish. The mayo-mustard was ok, 
very rich dish.

Wow this is a delicious recipe!  I absolutely loved the flavors of the herbed goat cheese and the salmon together.  My husband added some parmesean cheese to the dijon/mayo mixture.  He also broiled it for a couple of minutes at the end.  I can't wait to try this one again.

This recipe is super tasty! I did tweak it just a bit though. I cut a single, long slit in the side of the filet and stuffed the whole thing with goat cheese. (This might not be a great idea if you don't love goat cheese as much as I do!) I used a VERY minimal amount of the dijon/mayo and sprinkled a light parmesan/bread crumb mixture on top of it. Topped with some fresh chives and rosemary. I should note that I did have to bake it about 6-7 minutes longer. Did anyone else have this problem? If not, I'll just attribute that to the size of the filets, not the author's instructions. I will absolutely be making this again!

Super easy and everyone loved it.  I also put it all between two sheets of puff pastry and it was really impressive looking.  This can be put together for a week night dinner with no sweat.  Great recipe.

Hmm...  Sorry, I didn't care for this one much.  I've been searching for a salmon recipe that is not a soy sauce base so I tried this.  I really liked the herbed goat cheese itself and I was eating it while I was baking the salmon, and I love anything with mayo, I thought this would be my next favorite dish but it came out rather blunt.

This was sooo great! I was not feeling very ambitious, but I still wanted to make an impressive dinner, and this recipe really delivered both in ease and sheer, unbridled deliciousness. I followed the recipe exactly except I used plain goat's cheese. I made it for my boyfriend, who used to think he was the Salmon Master, but after tasting this he has conceded that title to me :) I think next time I might try this with curry mayo in place of mustard mayo. Thanks so much for this recipe!

3.5 stars - The salmon lover in my house was ill and could not eat.  The rest of us thought it was good.  I may have skimped on the goat cheese thinking it would overpower, but that was the best part!

For simplicity and taste this doesn't get any better than this!  Goat cheese is my all time favourite cheese, but I would of never thought to pair it with salmon  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I followed the advice of another reviewer, and did a mixture of grainy dijon and dijonaise.  I also sprinkled diced green onions on top.  I found it took 25 minutes at 375 to get the fish cooked and the cheese bubbly.  MAKE SURE TO USE GOOD FRESH FISH FOR THIS RECIPE!  I will make again!  Thanks!

I only had plain goat cheese and I added fresh garlic to the mayo/mustard mix.  Sprinkled it with salt and pepper and my husband was in love.  I served it with rice and a salad.

My family loved this recipe. I did, however make one change. I used healthy (naturally low calorie) honey/dijon salad dressing instead of the mayonnaise blend. Better for you and tasted wonderful. I also had a thicker piece of salmon and had to cook it for 30 minutes.

WOW!!!! I'm not a big fan of salmon, but know that I need to eat more of it and am always on the lookout for good recipes...  This one is AMAZING...  I did make a few tweaks.  I used about 4 teaspoons of dijon mustard and mixed it with 1/2 teaspoon mayo, sprinkled some dill on top of that and covered it all with a layer of panko.  I also had to cook a little bit longer than 15 min - closer to 30 min.  Will definitely make this again and again!

I tried this recipe last night and both my fiancee and I thought the goat cheese was a bit strong.  I ended up making more sauce by mixing 2 TB of mayo and 1 TB of each mustard(honey dijon, dijon and coarse mustard).  I also added some italian breadcrumbs on top of each salmon before baking. The topping turned out really good.  Next time I'll not stuff the salmon but instead replace the mayo with the goat cheese.

Incredible that something so simple can be so delicious...  It is even easier if you prepare it as one huge stuffed fillet and then slice it into the sizes you want to serve.  Hats off to whoever thought up this one.  Superb!

Hubby and I thought this was great. I liked how easy it was to prepare. I did omit the additional salt since goat cheese has a salty flavor to me. The prepared dijon mustard mayo blend- I mixed equal parts dijon mustard with olive oil mayo. I know there is the dijonaise stuff out there but I didn't have it.

I liked this a lot and for my first time cooking salmon, it was fool-proof!
However, it did take 25 minutes to back so make sure you carefully check the fish.
Also, it was a bit rich for me. My guy did not agree and thought it was perfect but it was almost difficult for me to eat too much due to the richness. Going to play around with this but it's a keeper for sure!
I served with broiled cauliflower and it was a yummy dinner.

This was pretty yummy.  I also used a whole fish fillet and cut a slit through it.  Then I mixed the goat cheese with spinach for stuffing.  I also mixed 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese with the mayo-mustard topping and added some whole black peppercorns for a little kick.  This turned out great, a little sweet but tangy with the pepper.  I'd definitely make this again, great salmon recipe.

This was easy and very delicious. I added extra cheese to the top! I will be making this again.

Was awesome and really easy.  Added honey and parmesan to topping and stuffed whole filet instead cutting into individual pieces.

This was a nice change from the normal sweet or buttery salmon recipes, but it didn't go over well with my family.  They enjoyed it but don't want me to cook it again anytime soon.  My DH thought it was too many different flavors. I myself thought it was good and a nice change of pace. But when I saw 2 pieces remaining in the pan, I knew I couldn't really cook this one again.

This is REALLY good, and prep for me was more like 5 minutes at the most...and I'm usually really slow at prep.  This is great if you're trying to show off your cooking and don't have much time.  People will think you're a fancy chef if you make this...trust me!  Delicious!!

I love this recipe! I like making it for company because it is so easy but the tast is so rich and fancy! The only thing I do differently is that I mince some garlic and put that in the salmon with the goat cheese. Oh and I also but half mayo half sour cream

I made this for company along with a tenderloin and they were impressed. I didn't really "get" how the recipe wanted the cheese placed in so I make a slice down the middle and one on each side and filled them with cheese. A little fresh dill and it made a beautiful presentation.

This was delicious! The delicate salmon matched with the rich goat cheese was gobbled up by my husband and friends.  I did add some breadcrumbs to the mayo/mustard blend to give it some more body.  Overall though, excellent!

I made this for my husband and I tonight.  I enjoyed the fish, but it was slightly too rich.  I would use less goat cheese next time even though I am a goat cheese freak.  I also found it a a little too salty.  Next time I will not pre-salt.  I used another reviewer's suggestion and baked the fish for 15 minutes at 350 and then broiled it for 2 minutes.  It browned nicely.  Overall, I would make this again.

Great, easy and quick dish to make. Watch the amount of goat cheese that you use, however.

Sooo good! I only had regular goat cheese, so I sprinkled some dry herbs over the felets- garlic salt, and some Italian herbs, then basted the salmon and goat cheese with the dijon mustard and mayo.  My husband and I thourghly enjoyed it- and I LOVED how easy it was and that the ingredients were easy to come by!  Thanks, I will definitely be using this one again!!!

The taste is amazing.  you don't need much mayo, or mustard for that matter - it's a pretty creamy dish to eat with all the goat cheese in the middle.  And it's pretty fool-proof as far as cooking goes - impossible for this to seem dry at all.

Easy - Wonderful - Tasty.  Made my own Dijon mustard mayonnaise blend which allowed me to make it to my taste (and cut back on fat/calories by using low fat mayo).  Served this with a jasmine rice as suggested.  Modified the rice by adding saffron and peas.  YUMMY.  This is a quick and easy weeknight dish.  TRY IT, You will love it.

Incredibly delicious, yet easy to prepare.  like others, I didn't have herbed goat cheese, so I used fresh basil, a little powdered garlic, and a touch of dried rosemary.  Similarly for the mustard-mayo blend, I made my own by adding equal proportions of Dijon mustard and low-fat mayo.  I thought it would be really good, but it beat my already high expectations.

I did not like the herb goat cheese so next time I think I will use regular. I think that change will make this a 4 star meal. Thank you for sharing!

I'd like to had more specifics on the mustard/mayo blend. I did a 50/50 approach.  The goat cheese had a very rich flavor almost too much.  I did do a wrap which helped (puff pastry salmon) but followed this recipe other than that.

This was very very good.  I'd give it 4.5 stars because I think the Dijon Salmon recipe is even better however the combo of goat cheese and salmon was tasty.  I added a little bit of mustard on the top of the fish to give it a bit more flavor.

Easy and delicious. I might use a honey dijon mustard next time to give it a little bit of sweetness, just to balance out the salty goat cheese.

I like salmon, but for me this was a little overpowering. I liked it the first few bites, but by the end I couldn't eat it anymore. Thanks anyway!

So Simple and so yummy.  I had never worked with goat cheese before.  I will be in the future.  My five year old loved this, what a surprise.

The flavors of this dish go together perfectly. I would have never thought to put goat cheese and salmon together but they work. This is a very rich dish so I didn't use as much of the topping as called for. This is now one of my favorite ways to prepare my salmon, yum.

The goat cheese & salmon combined is delicious! I would make about 1/2 of the mustard/mayo mix that the recipe calls for. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted great. Very easy to make.

WOW.  I love goat cheese.  I love salmon.  Why have I never put them together before?  This recipe took about 10 min max of prep time.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again for me and some guests.  It melts in your mouth!

What to do with two servings of left-over poached salmon and a little goat cheese?  While the salmon gently heated in the poaching liquid, I preheated the broiler and then stirred together ½ Tbsp. Dijon mustard, ½ Tbsp. light mayonnaise, ½ Tbsp. dry bread crumbs, and approximately 1 ½ Tbsp. crumbled goat cheese.  When the salmon was warm, I placed it on a broiler pan, skin-side down, and topped it with the mustard mixture.  Two minutes under the broiler, and it was ready to serve.  Delicious!

I loved this recipe.  I'm not a big salmon fan at all, but I really want to eat more of it since it's so healthy.  I tried this recipe last night and not only was it very easy, but so yummy.  My very picky husband even liked it.

Very good!  Make sure you buy a "tall" cut of salmon so you have room for a nice pocket/slit to put the goat cheese in.  I took the advice of another reviewer and mixed parmesan cheese, garlic & herb bread crumbs, Dijon and low fat mayo for the top - broiled it for 2 minutes after baking for a nice crust - Yum! I used a garlic & herb goat cheese (and used a little less than the recipe called for).  It came out delicious! This is a keeper!

My husband and I loved this, although he likes it with just a little of the mayo/mustard topping and I like lots of it. Also, I forgot to add salt & pepper the 2nd time and I made it and it was too bland, so I'll remember those next time.

I thought this was really delicious!  I loved how the goat cheese sort of melted over the fish. I did, however, cut down quite a bit on the mayo/mustard and found it still quite good.

Great recipe! I was skeptical about the flavor of the goat cheese with the salmon but they really were great together. I didn’t have herbed goat cheese so I made my own with a little dill , garlic salt and olive oil. I also passed on the mustard topping and drizzled lemon juice and olive oil over the stuffed filets instead. After 15 minutes at 350 I turned the over off and left the dish sit for a few minutes. The salmon browned nicely and the flavors were amazing! Will make again

I cook salmon once a week because my 9 year old and I LOVE salmon. I've never met a salmon that I didn't like. But, THIS recipe is our favorite way to prepare salmon...BY FAR! Such a huge pay out for such little work. How can you not try this recipe?! However, even though my son and I LOVE the goat cheese in this recipe, it's not for everybody. So, I may substitute cream cheese in the future if I plan on having guests. But, as far as I'm concerned, this recipe is perfect!

delicious! and a very forgiving/flexible recipe. I didn't have enough goat cheese (I had plain)so I added additional cream cheese and herbs. My salmon was thin so I just stacked them -turned out perfect!

Substituted frozen, breaded Alaskan pollock for the salmon.  Good!

Thank you for the recipe. This was easy recipe and I had all the ingredients at home so I tried it. 
I let it in the oven for half an hour and it was so delicious. The goat cheese and salmon = super tasty. :p will make it again. :)

The flavor was good, but the cook time was off. At 15 minutes, my fish wasn't even warm.

Easy to make and let me tell you goat cheese and salmon is a match made in heaven! I cut my slits lengthwise and stuffed the goat cheese inside. I didn't have dijon mustard and used a spicy brown and it worked out perfect. I also broiled for the last 5 minutes to brown a bit on the top. Great dish!

This was so good and so easy. I used a salmon tail and cut it into 5 pieces, then stuffed each peice. I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used honey mustard instead, no mayo. I also crumbled some goat cheese on top after baking and broiled it for a few minutes.

This was really good, a very different change to the typical salmon. Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous! Quick, easy and a nice change from plain fish. Had Feta cheese on hand so used in place of the herbed goat cheese. Definitely will make again
