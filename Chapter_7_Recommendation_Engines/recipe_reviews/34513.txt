Nice autumn dish.  Loved the mingled flavors of apples and onions!  The apples and onions were so good, in fact, you may want to double those!  I used a Granny Smith apple instead of the Cox apple.

This is a very good recipe!  However, I noticed that the fresh thyme wasn't noted in the recipe instructions.  I assumed it was to be sprinkled or pressed on top of the pork chops before browning, so that's what I did.

I didn't sprinkle the cooked apples with sugar, as I used a Braeburn apple and it was quite sweet enough.  I used Woodchuck Granny Smith Cider.  I'm not sure if that's the right item (it's sold with the beer in stores here in New England) but it sure tasted very good!  A definite keeper.

Living in the UK made me anxious to try this with local ingredients (we actually live in Somerset).  I do agree that it was bland even with local dry cider (much different from what you get in the US).  Less cream might solve the problem but to the sauce just didn't have a lot of taste even with three different types of fairly tart apples (Cox, Braeburn & Delicious) and the dincredibly strong onions they have here. The pork however was extremely tender and my kids like it (passed on the sauce completely after the first taste).  Probably won't make it again.

I was rather disappointed with this recipe- it was bland and not as creamy as I would have hoped- I had to add other spices too it- honestly, I don't think I will make it again

This was very nice although I made a few changes. I used butterflied pork steaks instead of chops. I cooked the pork, then cooked the sauce then added the pork back to the sauce to heat through all in the same pan. Didn't have any apple cider so used a 1/4 cup of cider vinegar and made up the rest with chicken stock. Because of the vinegar the sauce was slightly tangy but it worked well with the sweet apples.

I liked this recipe, but I thought it missed something.  It was a little bland.  Next time, I will double the apples and may even mix some BBQ sauce into the cider for more flavor!

The combination of flavors together were a great together.  The sauce is nice as well which can be used over a side dish like potatoes or noodles.  I also think the Granny Smith would be a nice substitute, but I only had a Gala apple to use.  The tartness would be a great addition.
