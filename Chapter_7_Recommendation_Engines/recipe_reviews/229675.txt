Instead of mayonnaise, I used sour cream. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. At the last minute, I folded in half of a small bag of mini marshmallows. I made no other changes. Instead of letting it set up in a serving bowl, I spread it in a 9x13 baking pan. Once it set, I spread the top with Cool Whip. This is to DIE FOR. We all loved it.

Took this to a Thanksgiving supper at Lodge and everyone raved. Requested again this year.
Of course made at home also. Jackpot. A Keeper.

I can't wait for this to set up all the way! From what I could taste, it is so delicious! And that was without all the combined textures!

It's excellent and I'm often asked to bring it to holiday functions.    I leave out the nuts because of allergy issues.

This is the exact recipe I've been looking for.  However, I don't have cream cheese so I'm going to use cottage cheese.  Hope it works as well.  Will also add some chopped celery.  Love allrecipes - can always find what I'm looking for!

Due to food allergy's we had to omit the apples and the walnuts, we also used sour cream instead of Mayo and it turned out very good.  Thought about adding pecans but didn't just in case there was also a food allergy to them also
