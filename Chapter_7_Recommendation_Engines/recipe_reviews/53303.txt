I made this for myself this morning, planning ahead for lunch. I prepared it as the recipe directed, gave it a taste for seasoning (salt and pepper), was satisfied, so I thought, with the 3-star rating I planned on giving it and put it in the fridge.  And then I took it back out of the fridge, not completely happy with it. While it certainly was ok and acceptable, it lacked contrasts in color and textures and the flavor fell somewhat flat.  It lacked interest.  It was sort of boring. So I went to work on it to take care of all my criticisms - I added sliced celery, chopped green onion, and thawed, frozen peas.  Added a little more mayonnaise to compensate for the additions.  Gave it a taste and it was much improved. I put it back in the fridge and as I did so I noticed the bacon I had in there....  I pulled it back out, nuked some bacon till crisp and folded it into the shrimp salad.  These additions definitely elevated this to 5 stars and was SO good it never made it till lunchtime.

I had some leftover shrimp and since my hubby loves egg salad I decided to give this a shot.  He turned his nose up at first, because he thought it sounded weird, but he ended up asking if I could make more of it!  I added some chopped celery and served it in pita pockets with lettuce and sliced tomato. Excellent, thanks for the recipe!

This was really wonderful.  We used whole wheat tortillas and made roll ups.  Next time I'll try egg whites rather than whole eggs, and low fat mayo to see if it makes a good lower fat meal.

This was easy and delicious.  I did add some diced celery to give it a little crunch. I plan on leaving out the dill the next time I  make it.  We served it on fresh croissants and it made a wonderful meal for a hot summer night.

I doubled this recipe and brought it to a 4th of July cookout last night.  It was the first thing to go!  My husband, who is not a fan of egg salad, loved it.  I served it in a large glass bowl lined with lettuce leaves as I would potato salad.  This recipe would be awesome as a sandwich.

Great reciepe!!! I did not have dill, so I added a little cilantro.
Very yummey!! So much so, to me, it is worth buying shrimp just for this purpose. I had used left over large shrimp, just made yesterday for peel and eat.

this receipe is good, not great. i think adding some red onion and celerey along with more mustard would make it better.
I don't think it is worth it to make this since it does not taste much better than regular egg salad without the shrimp.

This sounded so weird but so good at the same time that I had to try it. Boyfriend was a bit leery of it at first as well, but he agreed with me that it was really, really good. I didn't have any dill, fresh or otherwise, so I added garlic powder, onion flakes, a bit of Old Bay, and a lot of black pepper. Next time, I may use fresh garlic and onion. We had it on both whole wheat tortillas and Flatout bread. 

It may take a few moments and bites to warm up to, but it is definitely worth it. The leftovers were even better. Thanks!

Amazing. Never liked egg salad because I don't like crunchy onions and celery but had some leftover shrimp I wanted to use. Served on crackers. Was absolutely delicious. Definitely making again!!!

Great way to use left over shrimp.  I added celery, onion and cayenne pepper, though, to give it a little kick.

This just didn't do that much for either me or my hubby. It seemed like a waste of shrimp because we couldn't really taste it.  We'll just stick with egg salad sans shrimp.

I loved this salad! The shrimp and egg work well together. I did follow Naples' suggestions and added chopped celery, green onions, thawed frozen peas and salt and pepper. Nice light lunch over lettuce. Thanks for this excellent recipe that will be great in the warmer weather especially!

I gave this a 4 only because I felt like it needed more seasoning because it was a bit bland. I made it exactly as the recipe was written to start off with to be able to given an honest review. Refrigerated it a few hours for the flavors to blend together. I added more dill and some salt and pepper which made a difference. I then added celery for a little crunch. It was perfect. I then made the mistake of adding bacon as another reviewer did and it changed it up to much. You loose that awesome dill flavor by doing this. I will make this again with extra dill and some celery but no bacon.

It was very good, but could've used some more flavor.

His recipe turned out great.  It is a definite keeper.  I did tweak my a bit with a few of my favorite ingredients.  I added chopped celery, garlic powder, fresh parsley and cilantro, a little crushed red pepper flakes and served it on a bed of iceberg lettuce with fresh tomato wedges.  My husband loved it.

Love this. Great low carb meal. Lightly seasoned the shrimp with Old Bay, added some chopped white onion and fresh cilantro. I think the cilantro really gave it that "fresh salad" taste! Will definitely make this again.

I added 1/2 cup of finely chopped red onion,  1/2 cup chopped green onion, 1/2  cup finely chopped celery,  one table spoon of sweet pickle relish.  2 roma tomatoes quartered.  It disappeared in short order.  will make it again.

This was a wonderful recipe for leftover marinated shrimp from allrecipes.  I did not have a pound of shrimp leftover so only added 2 eggs but did add the suggested celery, green onion, and peas suggested by another reviewer.   It was so good I doubt there will be enough leftover for lunch tomorrow!
