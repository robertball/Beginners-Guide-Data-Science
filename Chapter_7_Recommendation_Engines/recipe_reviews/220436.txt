Our guests loved this soup; makes for a nice presentation as well. This was a bit thick, but then I didn't weigh my potatoes...so that could have been the culprit. Easy to fix with some thinning. I used evaporated milk for a creamier soup (no diluting.) Thanks for the fabulous recipe.

I followed this recipe to a T but had to use cornstarch to thicken it. My family loved this soup! Even my daughter who is not a fan of asparagus loved it! I will make this soup again, however, I will make a few "tweaks" for our preference. Instead of heating the milk in the microwave I will put it on the stove top. When the milk starts to boil I will put in 1 tsp of cornstarch so it will dissolve. Then lower the heat and add all other ingred except bacon. I will use the bacon as a garnish. Also I will not mash the potatoes.

I used Yukon gold potatoes, because that is what I had on hand.  I had the opposite result from the other reviewers, because I had to add milk.  I enjoyed the combination of flavors and textures.  Usually potato soup is very creamy, so with the addition of the crunchy asparagus and the crisp bacon, the texture was interesting.  The recipe directions do not say what to do with the asparagus, once it is cooked, so I used it as a garnish, along with the bacon and chives.

I loved this recipe!  It is delicious and hearty.  I read through the comments and noticed people having some thickening issues.  I used two extra potatoes in this recipe.  The added starch from the potatoes acted as a thickener.  Carrots make a nice addition to this soup!

The asparagus was a great touch,  but MAN was this bland! I may experiment with this in future plus some Tabasco sauce and other spices.

I liked the addition of the asparagus to the traditional potato soup.  Like a couple of others, it seemed verythic to me, which was easy enough to fix. Also, I agree with one other viewer that I will not mass next time, rather will coarse chop.

Loved it, we decided to add cheese to ours and some of us added a little extra salt but that is personal taste. Super easy to make and delicious. It does come out a little thick but we were ok with the thickness, would be very easy to thin out if you wanted to though.

I followed recipe to a tee, but waiting for husband to get home from work the soup was getting to thick so I added some chicken broth.
