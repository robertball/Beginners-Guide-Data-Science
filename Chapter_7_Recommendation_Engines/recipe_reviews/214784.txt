I made these and they were good, but it was touchy getting them to cook without burning them. I just watched an episode of Jacques Pepin and he did kale chips, but he put them on a wire rack and baked them at 250 degrees for 20 minutes. I tried that the next time i made these and they were FANTASTIC.

After washing and thoroughly drying kale, I tore into small pieces and placed on cookie sheet.  I sprayed with Pam olive oil and sprinkled sea salt over kale, baked in 350 degree oven for 9 minutes, then turned off the oven and left the kale in the oven to continue to crisp.  This way it does not brown but stays a beautiful green and tastes delicious.  You can keep it in the oven with the door closed for about an hour and it will be perfect.

These were to die for.  I used sesame oil and red wine vinegar instead, and only cooked them for about 5 mins in the oven.  The kale was from my backyard and was so delicious. I couldn't stop eating them and finished the entire bowl. I can't wait until the kale grows more so I can do it again.  GREAT recipe, thanks for sharing! I had always heard about kale chips but had never tried them, or kale before. Amazing way to use it. Do be careful with the cooking time b/c they can cook soo quickly. 5 mins was enough for me, if I left them in for 35 minutes I would have had nothing left but ashes! :)

Fantastic! I used balsamic vinegar, because I thought I had sherry, but when I went to the cabinet-all out! Oh well. It came out so wonderful, anyways. The only thing bad about this recipe is that you have to be careful not to choke, because you will want to INHALE them! yum, I think I'm going to make another batch tomorrow!

These are surprisingly delicious and a healthier alternative to regular chips.  I used red wine vinegar and pink sea salt.

Not bad at all!  I was cautiously optimistic about this recipe...it was only in the oven for about 20 minutes - and it came out nice and crispy.  Next time I will probably tear the kale into larger pieces and check more frequently.

I don't like kale in general, but from now on, if I have to eat some, that's how I'm going to eat it. Check your chips before 35 min in the oven... I had 2 trays in the oven and my chips were ready in 20 min. Also, eat everything at once. The chips don't taste good the next day.

This recipe is simply perfect. You can simplify things by skipping the bags and just using your hands on the kale in a large bowl (as suggested). Any good vinegar will do. We used a Pinot vinegar and garlic sea salt. If you have trouble with timing, it means you need to buy a thermometer for your oven and start cooking at the proper temperature. 35 mins is EXACTLY right: any earlier and the texture and flavor will not be right, any longer and they will burn. In a single layer (which you want), a good sized bunch of Kale will take up two medium-large baking sheets. Finally, be SURE your kale is dry. If it isn't you will be steaming it rather than roasting it. If you don't have a salad spinner, do as I did and put the kale in a dish towel, grab all the corners, and swing it in a circular motion a la Pete Townshend. Enjoy!

This is a fantastic recipe.  You do have to be very careful that you don't over- or under-cook them.  Also, make sure the kale is evenly spread out and is not clumped together.

I have an abundance of kale in my garden so I decided to try this. It fits all the criteria: fast, easy, healthy and strangly addictive! Even my 11 year old son ate some!  As another reviewer said watch the time. Mine were a step away from being burnt. I'll cook them shorter next time.

Very light and crispy. Can't stop eating them. Careful not to sprinkle on too much salt. The flavor is already very intense.

Different snack idea.  You can really change the taste by the type of vinegar you use.  If it gets chewy in a couple of days - just put back in the oven for about 5 minutes and it crisp right up.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Been wanting to try this since last summer and am glad I did!  Great combination of flavor and crunch!  Used ingredients I had on hand, but stayed pretty much to the recipe; Sesame oil and seasoned salt with a bit of garlic powder.  Highly recommend this one, so thanks for the post.

wow this is so weird but it really is good! i never had kale before but trying to get healthy i bought 2lbs of it and had to find creative ways to use it. this is a great way but it does not have to be more difficult than tossing in a bowl with oil/any vinegar then to bake and keep an eye on it. very simple and very tasty with soy sauce instead of vinegar too. kale is #1 nutritionally so try it

Soundly rejected by my 10 year old daughter, but I think they are fairly tasty, and a good way to use kale and create a nutritious snack.  Very light and crispy.  Watch the time though--mine only took about 15 minutes to roast.

I tried again and again to determine the perfect cooking temperature and time to make these without burning them and finally got it PERFECT when I used spray olive oil and put it into a 300 degree preheated oven... TURNED OFF the oven and walked away for an hour while the oven cooled down.  I can now make the chips consistently crunchy without burning them!

Made these last night after receiving my weekly organic produce box.  Super YUM!  Couldn't keep my hands out of them, but wasn't able to finish them.  Popped them into a warm oven for about 5 minutes to crisp them up again and they were even better!  I used garlic/herb flavored oil.  Even my husband liked them!

these were amazing! i made these with one change i used original pam instead of olive oil because my dad is allergic to olives...the best part about this is they sell kale chips(in plain,ranch and 3 cheese) where i live in an 6oz package for 7 dollars....i bought a pound of kale for a dollar and made my own :)

This is fantastic. I had my kale too crowded at first but when I split it and spread it out better it was amazing, even my veggie-disliking husband ate a LOT. My red wine vinegar was on the weak side, next time I will use 2 tablespoons to the 1 tablespoon of oil, since I ended up sprinkling on more afterwards. The bag method of oiling the kale is amazing, I never would have thought so little oil would go so far. I didn't use any salt because when I tasted it, it already tasted salty enough from the kale alone. THANKS for the awesome recipe and thanks to the person who mentioned not needing much salt and the people who warned to watch it in case it's done early!

I have had sauteed Kale and I couldnt stand it. When I got Kale in my CSA box today I was like oh great what am I going to do with this stuff - bleh.  Then came this recipe and OMG I am now a Kale chip super fan. I could have devoured the whole bunch in one sitting but I held back just a little. These were ugly but so crunchy and delicious that the appearance didnt matter. I didnt have sherry vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and then followed the instructions from there on. Kale you and I are on our way to being BFF's

This was insanely good. Don't be afraid to use a lot of kale as it bakes down to nothing.  This was so good I'm going to start growing kale.

Ohhh my!!! This is  just fantastic!  I have cooked this twice, the first time following the recipe.  The second time I was curious to see if I could get the same flavor using just a spray to cut fat as I can sit and eat the entire batch ;)  Just as good. And then...I made a discovery.  I had put some of the kale  chips on a chopping block that I had cut rosemary on...and talk about awesome!!

These are great, and contrary to many of the reviews, I did bake them for 35 minutes, as the original recipe said, and they were perfect.

Pretty good... did not use the vinegar and probably did not cook for 35 minuties.  Watch these closely or they'll burn and don't skip removing the inner ribs!  This is the first time I've tried kale (I cooked this twice since  had so much,) and I learned after the 1st batch how incredibly salty the kale is... I basically ruined the first batch as I did not remove the inner ribs (didn't have ths recipe), overcooked it to almost burning it, and salted it way too much!  I cut down on the salt considerably on my 2nd batch (and had this recipe,) but it was still too salty.  I would consider not salting it at all until it's done and taste it first.

I am not sure why some are complicating these so much. I spread some kale out (pre-chopped and washed) on a cookie sheet lined with foil, sprayed evenly with PAM spray (plenty), and salted lightly.  Baked in preheated oven for 12minutes @350 degrees and they turned out awesome.  ...no turning...no wilting...no burnt.  It really doesn't get much easier, folks.  Will be making again and again. Thanks TMPNORTH

Surpringly good! I used balsamic vinegar with great results. After reading other reviews, I baked these at 270 for 20 minutes, or just until crispy. They do shrink quite a bit, but a delicious way to sneak in those leafy greens! Definitely a keeper.

I loved these guys and will definitely make them again for sure! My fiance was not much of a fan, but I didn't mind cause there was more for me! Some advice is to lay all the pieces flat on your baking sheet and don't have pieces on top of other pieces otherwise they won't turn out crispy. I cooked mine on 275 for 13 minutes and they came out perfect. Give them a try you will love them!

These are addictive! I love them. They aren't as crunchy as real chips, but are still so good. I love them with red wine vinegar and garlic salt. I've tried apple cider as well.

This recipe is the bomb...in a good way. Every time I received my organic basket, I was so excited when it contained kale. I would rush home and make this recipe right away. So, so good. Thank you for posting this excellent recipe.

Holy awesome!  I had the oven temp at 350 and my small pizza sized tray was done in 5 min.  I skipped the vinegar and just oiled and garlic salted them.  They actually crunch! YUMMY!!!

We switched this one up a bit, and it was really delicious! The vinegar we chose was rice vinegar because we love it in our sushi rice, and it happened to be what was in the cabinet!  Instead of 300 degrees, we set the oven to 350. Cooked the chips for 5 min on one side, then flipped them all over. Then I took a sheet of foil and pressed it on all the chips for a moment. This will make the chips nice and flat. cooked 5 min on the other side. I can't imagine leaving them in for 30 minutes or more. Ours would have been burnt.  The kids loved this one, it is cool to see leafy greens turn into chips!

Not sure if I like. Followed directions with olive oil, basalmic vinegar, sea salt. Cooked 350 for 9 minutes. Very crunchy, but feel like I'm eating old leaves off the road. Would not make again. This may just be me & nothing against the recipe

Better than I thought!  Most of my kids liked them with ketchup, a couple ate them straight up. I liked them plenty and now I don't need any more vitamin A for a week.  Served as a side dish with Red Beans and Rice, along with cornbread too.

Really tasty recipe! Couldnt stop munching on them. The only difference I made was I cooked mine in small batches, they got crispier that way when there was more space between them. I also did not flip them in-between cooking or cook them as long. I cooked only 10 minutes, checking at 5 minutes then at 7. Really keeping an eye on them so theY didn't burn.

If you don't like kale this recipe won't make you like it.  I like kale and I enjoyed this recipe.  Giving it 4 stars because I followed other advice on the time/temp.  250 for 15 minutes was perfect for me.  

It has a light and crunchy texture.

needed lots more of everything fro seasoning, but pretty good. Crunchy greens aren't really comparable to potato chips, but if forced to give a comparable item I would have to say chips as well- but it is a lousy expectation! They are completely unique, and worth a try at least once.

Try these with nutritional yeast sprinkled on them prior to baking. For those unfamiliar with nutritional yeast, it tastes similar to parmesan cheese but its very healthy. I learned about it from a vegan friend who uses it as a pasta topping, rather than parmesan. Whole Foods sells it in their bulk aisle for about $7/lb.   Also I prefer using the dinosaur kale AKA Lacinato kale for making chips.

Oh, boy! These were great! Did a small batch in the toaster oven so they were easy to watch & keep from burning. They never made it to a plate. I ate them right off the pan! :-)

Combined a couple recipes for kale chips together-used diced fresh garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and salt,tossed it, then added some honey and tossed it again. spread on foil covered cookie sheet and since my oven only goes down to 170', cooked for 1 1/2 hrs flipping them and testing as I went. My chiropractor keeps trying to get me to eat more cruciferous veggies and especially kale-this way I can do it. They were surprisingly good.

Glad TMPNorth shared putting the kale in a plastic bag with the oil and seasonings for a more even coating.  Makes it so much easier.

Great recipe, will definatly make this one again.

I noticed some negative feedback. Also noticed that most of these were made early on in the kale season. Kale is best after it has had frost on it. It tends to be bitter up until that point. Frost will make it much sweeter, and it can withstand temperatures down to -15 degrees celcius without damaging the plant. Most people do not realize this and give up on kale before giving it a fair chance.

These were AMAZING!! My husband and i tore them up! Even my 7 year old son loved them. Only change i did to the recipe was omit the sherry vinegar since i didnt have any. Just drizzled some olive oil, sprinkled some kosher salt (sea salt would be better) and baked at 350 for roughly 7 minutes and voila!

I didn't like this recipe as written, the chips came out half chewy and half scorched.  The family gave it a try, but were unimpressed.  Recently I used my dehydrator to dry a bunch of kale, and I think THAT texture was what this recipe was going for.  Thanks for the idea!

This recipe was really fantastic and I absolutely loved it! I used apple cider vinegar instead of sherry vinegar (both because it's my favorite vinegar and because it was all I had) and instead of using sea salt, I sprinkled a little lemon pepper on top of them and it turned out *amazing*. I do agree with the other reviewers, though, that you have to watch the cooking time. Mine were done in fifteen minutes, so thirty-five seems to be a bit overboard.

Excellent!  Made them as written... I had several layers of kale on the cookie sheet and cooked it on 250 for about 40 minutes turning chips twice.  I was eating the crispy ones while waiting for the others to come out of the oven.  So good, that two people ate over 1/2 bag of kale (chips) as we watched a movie.

Delicious!  My husband and I couldn't get enough of them.  Be sure to really dry the kale well before tossing with the oil and vinegar.  I think that is the key.

YUMMY!! I am a skeptic, and yet, these surprised me!  I used 'apple-cidar' vinegar and less salt and they are really great!!

This was amazing! My 2 year old even gobbed them up. I think he ate almost as many as me. I used a tuscan blend olive oil and red wine vinegar. Don't forget the sea salt. That small pinch goes a long way. I WILL be making this again.

I put them on a rack as well, they didn't all fit so I put the other half on a baking sheet and baked them at 250 for 20 min. I left the ones on the sheet in 5 more min for the extra crisp.

these were great!!! I just used extra virgin olive oil and put into a bag and put some sea salt in then added the kale pieces and coated the kale pieces put on baking sheet and into the oven (350) for 15 mins and they were gone within minutes. Next time I might try some different seasoning and see how they taste.

Per another reviewer's advice, I upped the temp a bit, and turned off the oven half way through. They ended up crisp and perfect. I have trouble sharing them after.

If you're like me you'll be tempted to add more oil than the recipe calls for. Don't do it. Too heavy a hand will make these soggy and not really a healthy snack anymore. After adjusting to less oil they came out great. I also prefer Apple cider vinegar so I used that instead, delicious. One recommendation, let them dry out over night in a bowl or a tray. If you bag them up too soon they get soft and not crunchy. Crunchy is way better.

I was desperate to find an alternative to potato chips and heard about kale chips on a cooking show.  OMG, as a diabetic, this is my new go to snack.  So easy!  I am addicted to salt & vinegar chips so in place of the sherry vinegar I used cider vinegar and in place of salt as I am on a salt-restricted diet, I sprinkled onion powder on it.  I had a problem with my oven crisping the kale so I had to increase the temperature. Next time I am going to use Betty's suggestion in her review of baking for 9 mins and turning off the oven, but leaving the kale in for about an hour.

These were awful. I don't know what I was expecting but mine turned out like dried leaves that you rake in the fall. I love veggies but this was all wrong. Maybe I overcooked them but I can't imagine how they would taste good at all.

I have been wanting to try these for a while now. And I was not disappointed :) Light and crunchy. I put in two batches, one on a cookie sheet and one on a wire rack on a cookie sheet. The wire rack worked perfectly for me, as the ones on the sheet stuck and slightly burned. I also only had to leave mine in for 10 mins at 350, but I think altitude has something to do with baking times.

I love this! Instead of store-bought bagged kale, I bought whole bunches so I can control the sizes of the chips. Rice vinegar, any flavored vinegar, allows you to play with flavors. I also sprinkled the finished chips with toasted sesame seeds. Healthy and addictive! So nice to have a healthy addiction. :)

I was quite pleasantly surprised! I used balsamic vinegar, and sprinkled lightly with garlic salt.  I baked them less than 35 minutes - started at 10 min, turned the sheet around in the oven, and then checked every 5 min. I put cooling racks inside a jelly roll pan to bake.  There were still a few left this morning - I think they still taste good.

I love, love, love kale chips! I do bake them slightly different though, I usually do 350 for 9 minutes. The vinegar taste isn't quite as strong as I was hoping for, but since I know this works I have been turning leftover (dressed) kale salad into kale chips. So thanks for opening up my eyes to new ways to use leftovers!

I love raw kale; I did not care for the kale chips.  They were bitter and I just really didn't like them.  I was happy to learn that the sherry adds a lot of taste even if the kale is raw.  I will definitely be making a sherry and kale dish again even if it is not the chips.

I just can't give these 5 stars because they're so finicky.  There is such a fine line between too little and too much salt...too over done and too under done.  I haven't been able to get them "perfect"...but I'll keep at it!  My niece had the same results as me.

I don't know if it's just me, but I tried baking these twice, and they are SO WEIRD. I wouldn't compare eating these to eating potato chips at all because a better comparison would be eating dry, crisp leaves that you rake up in your yard in the fall. The flavor isn't bad, but the texture is...bizarre. And they get stuck ALL over your teeth and lips! I have to say though - they were an interesting experience that I am glad to have in my repertoire.

I liked this OK, mainly because I knew it was good for me, but my husband thought it was awful.  I think a bit of garlic would have helped, but crisp, baked greens will never be my favorite.  I much preferred the Sweet and Savory Kale.  If you try this, be sure to watch it.  It only needed 20 minutes of cooking time.

I followed the recipe without making any changes. I should have read the other comments for ideas of what to add to it,though,this just didn't do it for me.

I followed the 300 degrees but baked for 20 minutes. I used 1 tbsp for each of the following: olive oil, sesame oil, balsamic vinaigrette. Then a dash of lemon pepper and sea salt.

My 3 year old that doesn't like veggies much loved these.  I cooked these with a preheated oven for 40 mins and I think a few could have gone longer.  I gave it 4 stars because Im not quite sure how to cook these still.  Some are still soggy and some are really crispy.

This didn't really do it for me. it just tasted like salt. mine only took 15 minutes. make sure to do in a single layer for best results. I think chile roasted kale is much better.

It's a good guilt-free snack. I liked them, but I just haven't been able to convince myself to buy a bunch of kale to make more, as we aren't fussy about kale in general at our house.

I only had to cook mine for 9 minutes and even that was too long for a few of the pieces on the sheet.
Next time I'll use a little more vinegar or maybe a sprinkle of grated cheese

Super tasty healthy snack.  These cook down quite a lot.   I like some of them still a little moist as it contrasts well with the crunchy parts.

I was completely skeptical when I read this recipe and trusted that people reviewing it, would understand that I am incredibly picky.  

I recieved kale in a co-op basket I purchased and thought I would try this recipe out and was stunned at how delicious it was.  I discovered that a "pinch of sea salt" is really all you need (I used a bit too much).  

Fantastic flavor and crunch. Thank you for sharing!

So I gave it 4 stars because they weren't bad and bordered on good.  I've never had Kale before so I don'tknow how good/bad it can be.  I would eat them, kids weren'tfond of them. Roasting anything tastes good and so these do follow suit.

Wonderful, totally changes the taste of kale!  I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I used tarragon vinegar instead and it ended up tasting nutty, almost like pine nuts.  I had baked it at 325 for 25 minutes and it was done.

These were super easy and incredibly delish.  As suggested, I checked them every 10 minutes, and took them out after about 25/26 minutes.  I also sprinkled a little chili powder at the end for a "kick."  I am very sad they are gone!!!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but I was quite disappointed with the taste.  I watched it carefully as others advised, and took it out exactly at the right time.  I usually enjoy kale, both cooked and raw (in smoothies), but this recipe just wasn't for me.

I prepared Kale for the first time in another recipe but I had left over Kale. So, I found this recipe and had to try it.  And I loved it.  It's so tastey.  Now, I'm looking forward to buying and eating kale again.   Thanks so much!

I can not believe that so many people have recommended these.  The vinegar was overwhelming and the chips were very thin.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was inedible to say the least.  I was disappointed because I was excited about a healthy alternative.

These are amazing! I just made a batch, and I can't stop eating them. I may never eat another traditional chip ever again. I didn't have any olive oil or sherry vinegar in the house, so I just used vegetable oil and red wine vinegar. I highly recommend these!!

WOW!!  These were very odd and amazingly good! I agree with the reviews on the addictive nature of these. Used balsamic vinegar and sea salt and they were delicious.  Will make them again and maybe actually share them with my family.  Mine took about 30 minutes and some were a little soft but still tasty.

Added a little bit of creole seasoning and just used the olive oil pam spray. Super easy and yummy!

I really like this. Be sure to use larger pieces of kale so it bakes right. I used balsamic vinegar and avocado oil, sprinkled with slap ya mama. excellent. baked about 260° for about 10-15 minutes. watch them!!! Experiment with cheeses, and different toppings. use sparingly.

This is the second time I made them and I love it so much as the first time.  So I lined a cookie sheet with waxed paper, then I washed the kale and tore it off the main stem into smaller pieces and placed each piece on the waxed paper.  I then poured a little bit of Olive Oil in a small bowl or container ( use your own judgement on how much to pour) and dipped my pastry brush into the Olive Oil and then brushed each piece with with the Olive Oil.  Then I lightly sprinkled some salt and some Lemon Pepper. I put into 300 degree over for 15 minutes. I took them out of the oven and enjoyed.  We finished all of them.

This was my first time making Kale chips and they are really tasty! I followed this recipe with the addition of a teaspoon of soy sauce. I will try it next time without salt. A big hit in my family!

I recommend looking at other sites too. Different temps and times are used in some recipes. Some recommend baking on a cooling rack for improved circulation vs flipping them over halfway. 

Regardless, these DO NOT take the place of potato or corn chips. They taste like greens. That isn't bad, but let's not pretend these are something they CLEARLY are not.  When one is making health choices, these are a great salty snack- as long as you are willing to invest the time for 10 minutes of snacking pleasure. 

On that (salt) note- I recommend using table sea salt. The small grain size will stick to your kale better.

First time having kale chips and they were fantastic.  I agree that watching the time is crucial.  Did 13 minutes in a convection oven and they may have been just a tad overdone.  Will cut back to 10 minutes next time.  Very tasty though.

I used balsamic vinegar, but probably not enough..  I think the flavour could have been more intense, if I had a more precise amount of kale given other than "1 bunch."  Kale can come in large bags, already prepared, or, taken straight out of the garden, as mine was.  So a better description of the amount is needed.

I've never had kale and thought these were OK.  They weren't awesome, yet I couldn't stop eating them.  They definitely only need to be in the oven for about 15-17 minutes.

My family wanted to know if they could rate this recipe with negative numbers! They likened it to dried leaves. I watched them closely in the oven for 5 min, then 1 and 2 minute intervals until it was in for about 14-15 min. Apparently that was too long even though they were still nice and green (not burnt). Son thought they were too crispy and they were just a little ashy with not much flavor. They couldn't even tell that I'd used olive oil, vinegar, and salt. I won't be making these again. We'll stick to our white beans and kale recipe.

I found 35 minutes was much too long to bake and they were too crispy. I prefer baking for about 15 minutes, shaking them around and then baking them for another 7 or so minutes.

Got kale from our share in the local CSA and was hesitant to eat it as I thought it would be too bitter for my tastes, but this is excellent!  Whole family loved it - including my husband, my 9 year old and 13 year old, even the 3 year old couldn't get enough.  Will definitely make this again!

Didn't like these at all. Perhaps baked them too long. Also the bunch of kale I bought was pretty small leaves. Will not try this again.

These are very yummy!  I also added a little seasoning salt.  I did 1/2 with cheese and 1/2 without.  I think I like them without which surprises me since I'm a cheese lover.  So glad I found this recipe!

I can barely cook these 7 mins without burning them and my oven works just fine.  Wondering if my kale is thinner than everyone else's?  The vinegar is a nice additive and I think the taste if not burned is pretty good, but it's a lot of trouble for a skinny easily to burn treat.

Just an observation,  the first photo on this recipe is actually not kale, but looks like chard.   I tried 15 mins at 300, @6200 ft, and they were crunchy with a little chew.  Which turned out just right imo because they still had substance.

This is the first Kale Chips recipe I've tried...baked 20 minutes & decided to turn the oven off.  I kept taking small portions out & trying different seasonings.  I didn't have any problem with burnt chips.  Very good & will keep experimenting with the seasonings.

Just made a batch and have to say that I will definitely be making them again. I put a bit too much salt so they were not great. As some of the other reviews mentioned, they turn out best if the kale is dry first and the pieces are not too big. Cook them for 10 minutes then turn the oven off and let them sit for another 5. Perfect!!!

Winner Winner!! Loved these and the kids scarfed them down and asked for more. I did half a bunch of kale to test them out and of course need more. The Kids were scraping the bowl for the tiny pieces that broke off. You do need to eat them fairly quickly. I also baked them for 10 minutes and then stirred and flipped them over and went another 8 minutes so that the other parts could crisp up. Very easy and tasty way to add a great veggie to the meal. We paired them with cooked carrots in a light brown suger glaze and the combination was great! Sweet and salty!

They turned out GREAT.  12 minutes was just right. I read another recipe and it waid 10 minutes only.  Plenty crunchy, not burned at all.   I added pumpkin seeds (pepitas) and edamame (soybeans) to the mix and they roasted great. I put everything in a plastic bag, shook it and poured it all out onto a jelly roll pan with sides.  Spread out in a single layer, not too much at a time.   It helped to buy the already chopped and washed kale and the more tender variety is better also (Trader Joes).  I used sissors to cut away the veins, faster that way. I used lemon juice, olive oil, sea salt, white wine vinegar.  Go light on the salt.  What a munchy winner.

They get soggy fast, but if you cook them too long they turn to dust. Maybe I just haven't perfected the right amount of cook time yet...? Probably won't make these again.

I have never had Kale before.  This recipie was really good but called for a bit too much seasoned salt.  I am going to try it again but I think I will use sea salt and not as much.

Fabulous! Thanks for showing me how easy this is! I made it with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and salt. My oven cooked it perfectly for about 20 minutes at 300 degrees. They definitely shrink, so don't break your pieces too small! Thank you!

I seriously LOVE kale chips and usually just toss them with some olive oil and salt before baking, but the vinegar added a really nice kick! Reminded me of salt & vinegar potato chips. Yum!

The kids ate kale.  You can't get a better review than that.  
It is essential to watch the oven carefully.  They go from soggy to burnt in about one minute.  If you catch them at just the right time, they are crispy and delicious.

I never rate recipes, but after watching my 2 1/2 year old INHALE these, I thought it was necessary this time.

We actually made this with chard, just because I have way too much chard around and needed some new ideas.

I didn't like it, my husband liked it alright, but my daughter ate almost the entire batch.  I bet it tastes even better with kale!

I made these with swiss chard and no vinegar.  It was delicious and crisped up just fine!  Kale tends to be bitter and the vinegar cuts the bitterness but isn't necessary with chard.

I made the mistake of not checking on these while they were baking. I baked these for 30 minutes (the recipe actually states to bake for 35) and they came out totally burnt! Maybe will try for 20 minutes next time and definitely check on them. Super disappointing.

Loved them.  Even my kids loved them (which really surprised me).  They are comparable to potato chips, but with a different aftertaste that lets you know that you're eating a "real" vegetable.

The taste is wonderful, and so easy.
I didn't have sherry vinegar, but used white wine vinegar and it worked. All but 5 or 6 were crispy in the 35 minutes; I gave the last ones an extra 5 min and they were fine too. Took it to a party and it was a hit with everyone.

good! I tried them at 250F for 20 minutes as one reviewer had said, but that didn't do much, so I put them on 325F for a couple of minutes and they turned out so nice and crispy! yum!

I liked these a lot.  I am looking forward to trying different seasonings.  One I want to try is soy sauce, and another is balsamic vinegar.  I'll also try regular sea salt once, maybe some garlic powder another time, possibly Italian herbs.  :)

I shook the pan every two minutes and baked them for about 12 minutes.

My two year old ate about 5 pieces (pretty good for him).  The rest only lasted about 15 minutes because I couldn't stop. 

Thanks for posting the recipe!

Um...delicious much?  Great recipe!
I don't remember how long I left them in the oven, but it wasn't 35 minutes.  Be sure to check them often!

These are the best! My 10 year old loves it! They never made it off the baking sheet.
I used garlic salt instead. 
I turned the kale every 10 minutes or so to keep them from burning.

maybe I did something wrong, but I'm not a novice in the kitchen, had fresh farmers market kale and this just tasted nasty. I had to throw it out.

Love these! Made them with Collards the other day and they were incredible. They're a great way to deal with a large amount of greens on hand although mustards don't work for these; but collard greens & turnip greens do. I cut the stalks out with a chef's nice and save them to blend into other recipes (like beef and barley soup or home made shepherd's pie.) Also you can't wing it with the measurements on the oil and vinegar/using this method of measurement of oil then oil then vinegar in this recipe works every time I just hand toss them in a bowl. They need to be spread out in a large baking sheet helps also. First time I thought I'd burn them but I haven't adjusted the cooking time much from this. Mainly I check them til they look right, when they're just crunchy but not too dark of a brown they're perfect.

My first experience with kale. Really easy recipe, and super tasty. Chips might be an overstatement, but flakes would be appropriate. I added cayenne pepper for a little kick. Will definitely make this again.

I thought this was a yummy and very creative way to sneak in some greens!  I only gave it four stars because my husband did not like them.

I've never had kale before and had no idea what to do with it when a neighbor gave me a bunch from her garden. I really didn't enjoy the flavor at all. Not something  will do again.
