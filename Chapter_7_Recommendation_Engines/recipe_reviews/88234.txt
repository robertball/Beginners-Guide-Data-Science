I made this for my fiance with great results. I made some slight modifications to the recipe however: used apple cider instad of "hard" cider, added a clove of garlic when browning the pork, used McCormick's Montreal Seasoning on the pork while browning,   added a 1/4 of 14 oz can of saurkraut to the apple mixture before baking, and ended up making the sauce more of a gravy by thickening it with flour in the end).  Served with mash potatoes and steamed asparagus.  The gravy has a sweet taste and was delicous and the pork was excellent - very tender. I'd make it again. My fiance loved it.

This recipe was pretty good.  I found the 'sauce' to be more like a thick applesauce than a gravy type of sauce but it was flavorful.  I doubt I'd bother food processing the mixture next time and would just keep it whole and pour over the pork. 
I did think that 45 minutes was too long - it was slightly overdone but maybe my loin was slightly smaller.  I'd check it after 30 minutes and go from there.

I really liked this. I was halfway through making it when I realized that I needed a blender (which I don't have), so I didn't puree the onions and apples. I actually prefer it this way, I think, because I like having the pieces to eat along with the pork. The sauce doesn't really get thick, though. It does *thicken* but it's not a thick sauce. Still, very yummy. I'll definitely make it again.

We thought it was bland. There are no seasonings in this.  I like a spiced brown crust on my meat to give it some flavor! The sauce was very bland as well. I guess the word "bland" sums it up for us. I'm glad others liked and enjoyed it but it just isn't our type of dish. I won't be making it again but appreciate your sharing it. :o)

Loved this.  The sauce was sweet, but not too sweet.  It had a good apple flavor, with an undertone of onion.  I used Hornsby's hard cider in Crisp Apple flavor.  I found that some hard ciders seem to have more of an apple flavor than others, so go for the more apple ones.  The sauce was excellent over noodles.  The pork was extremely tender, and the sauce complemented it perfectly.  It was a really nice autumn dish.

Love this recipe and have added it to my regulars.  You have to use the hard cider though.  Apple cider is too sweet.  Also I use a little more heavy cream than the recipe calls for and I use a hand blender to puree the apples and onions right in the pot.

We loved this!  Decided to make it but did not want to run to the market for a few items I did not have.  I had a jar of Palaner Fuji apples in the juice I used instead of the cider and a fresh apple.  I added a splash of apple cider vinegar to cut the sweetness of the juice.  We did not puree the apples and onions as they had cooked down quite a bit.  Served with fresh steamed asparagas for a low carb dinner.  Wine was a Pinot Noir which tasted great.  Saving this one for when we have guests!

This was great! Good company dish. If you have leftovers of sauce and meat, cube the meat, mix with sauce and serve over noodles.

I made this for dinner tonight and what a wonderful way to serve a pork tenderloin! Made it just as the recipe is written and served it with fresh asparagus, topped with a fantastic Hollandaise sauce from this site. I really impressed my guests with the whole dinner! Truly a wonderful meal!

A really high quality result from a novice like me! I was totally impressed, this dish goes really well with potato wedges or fresh veg. 

I used Pork Chops instead of loin and reduced the oven time to 25-30 minsand it seemed fine.

I also scaled the servings to 2 and there was enough sauce for at least 4 so tonight I'm using the left-overs as a pasta sauce. :)

Thanks
Minow

Except for adding a bit more cider and chicken stock, I made this as written in my cast iron skillet.  Don't neglect to brown the tenderloin, because this helps seal in the juices. My Brit husband loved it, and we had more than enough for another meal. Served with roasted root vegetables including taters. I have been to and eaten in Normandy, and this brought back memories of great meals. Lovely.

This was a great recipe that everyone enjoyed.  I had a bottle of Granny Smith Apple Cider that I wanted to use in a recipe and this was perfect for it.  I made it entirely stovetop and cut the pork into cubes but otherwise followed the recipe and it was great.  Served it with mashed potatoes and steamed veg.

This was delicious!  I had more meat so I doubled the recipe.  I made some minor modifications like using regular apple cider and adding some garlic during browning.  I just blended the sauce at the end in the vitamix and served it without cooking it further.  There was plenty of sauce left afterward, so I used it later over some minute steaks.  Yummy!

Super delicious! I decided to slow cook it cuz I had the time and I love slow cooked pork. Used all the same ingredients but combined everything and threw it in the crockpot for about 6 hours. Served it over mash potatoes. So good. Definitely making this again!

Did not care for this too much. I followed some reviewers' suggestions to add more flavor but still felt like this was tasteless. Perhaps it's my American palette since European dishes are often less flavorful than what we concoct in the States. In that vein, this recipe may be exactly what Pork Normandy *should* taste like. But as a fan of spices and flavors, this just wasn't my cup of tea.

I noticed a lack of seasoning so I added salt, pepper and thyme to the pork before browning it. I put it in a casserole dish and used a little more chicken stock and apple juice instead of cider. When it was done I didn't blend the apples and onions but strained the liquid and then thickened it with a little cornstarch before adding the cream. The meat was so tender and juicy and had some great flavor!

Incredibly easy and very tasty dish!  The apple "gravy" is very delicate and almost worthy of a bowl for soup once all the tenderloin is complete.

I followed the recipe pretty closely except for using creme fraiche instead of heavy cream and rather more then 3 tbs.  Love the results, except next time I would reduce the amount of Calvados and raise the amount of stock.  I like the taste of Calvados, but my wife and I thought the dish was a little too "liquory".  Still, the recipe is a good one and is a great way to prepare tenderloin.

Excellent!  I made this for my elderly French neighbor who grew up in Normandy; She was skeptical of my attempting French (particularly Norman)cooking, but approved this dish highly (as did the rest of the dinner party).  My only recommendation is to blend the sauce in small portions since hot liquids expand quickly - as I found out the hard way.

It was a simple recipe with a great flavor.  I used pear slices instead of apple and used creamy celery instead of cream.  At our annual pot luck, my dish was the most popular one and got cleaned out almost as soon as the pot luck started.  This will be on my list for our house warming dinner party with friends next month because everyone wanted me to make it again.  I think with a slight modification, I think this can be a very popular dish next time as well along with BBQ ribs.

Was good but think it needs stronger apple flavor. Will be adding more cider and less broth next time. Plus more apples and onions.

I liked this, especially how tender the pork came out!  I couldn't find hard apple cider, so I used apple juice and it worked out fine.  I also added a cup of mushrooms between the onions and apple slices, I'll do that again...delicious!  I also blended only half of the sauce and the unblended chunks added a very nice texture, I'll do that the same way next time too!  I served it over white rice.

To those that see this as sweet or bland I'd say that to me all recipes are guides and this is a great base to start with.  I added a little hot sauce, the vinegar balanced the sweet a bit, and some herbs gave it depth.  Great idea and flavor with the onion and apple.

This recipe was so delicious!  I doubled the gravy and did not blend the apples and onions.  Can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for such a good recipe!  Betty

A nice easy recipe, especially when you have limited options on your pantry. I did use the food processor (see magic bullet) and it was nice to have the smooth texture. I felt like the dish needed something not so we served it over noodles and the family very much enjoyed it. Be aware although the dish tasted great, color was tan in tan in white noodles so it is not the prettiest looking dish.

This was delish! I did everything as written except I added a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic with the onions. After everything came out of the oven I took out the pork, and instead of blending it I added a tablespoon of cornstarch (with water) to the sauce. Then I added the cream. It was really yummy! Thanks!!!

Absolutely loved this.....I didn't have hard apple cider, so I just used apple juice. Great recipe just as is, but I also added sauteed mushrooms at the end after the sauce was blended. My husband all but licked his plate! Served it with baked potatoes and put some of the sauce on the potato as well.

I thought this recipe was very good.  It was easy to follow and the only variation I made was using regular Apple Cider rather than hard cider and I reduced the temp to 325 degrees and baked for 40 minutes.  My family and I enjoyed it.  I do intend to make it again for my family, though not on the usual monthly rotation.  I'll probably make it 3 or 4 times a year when we're looking for something 'a little different'.  It paired nicely with white rice.

Only changes were to use apple cider, & to not puree the sauce but to serve it up  straight from the skillet. As well, used skim milk instead of heavy cream (waist-line!!). Very tasty dish! - the apple cider added a tart element that was a perfect complement to the other ingredients.

This time when I made it, I took the advice of other readers and did not puree the sauce before adding the cream..definitely just as delicious just a different texture.

Awesome recipe.Tenderloin was moist and tender.Shredded with a fork. I baked for 40 minutes and didn't have heavy cream so I substituted with sour cream and it worked well.Also I did not blend the onions and apples in the sauce since we like it this way.

I used pork sausage instead of the tenderloin and broke it into pieces as I browned it. I didn't have the hard cider, and although thats an important part of the dish, I had to use chicken stock instead. I added a dash of red wine vinegar to give it a little twang. Apple cider vinegar would've been better. I added about 1 tsp of sage, 1 tsp of chili powder (my DH loves it on everything!) and a lot of garlic. Then I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese because it looked like it "needed" something when it was in the dish. It was a little naked. All in all, 4 stars. a great dish! Something new to do with pork. A good change from the mundane.

My family is the pickiest eaters you've ever seen and they all rated this a 5 star.  My 2 daughters don't even like pork!  Absolutely the best recipe I've tried from this site so far.

I have terrible luck with pork, but this turned out very tender and good.  It needed lots of salt and fresh ground pepper.

My Boyfriend loved this dish - he continued to use the gravy on bread the rest of the week.  I found it a little bland - but good for something different!  Thanks!
