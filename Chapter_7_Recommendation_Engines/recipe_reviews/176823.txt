I started out making this when I was really super broke and the only meat I could afford was bacon. It always increases easily with what you have on hand and however many people you have to feed. I make this now for my boys and add in bacon, add a little bit of spice and toss with parmesan cheese. Never fails to get smiles!

I made this at my hubby's request. I have not eaten this dish before so I went on his description of how his dad used to make it as to how this was supposed to be. This turned out wonderfully and my husband was well pleased. He said it was exactly like his dad's were except he wanted it soupier, so the next time I will add some tomato juice instead of sauce or maybe in addition to. I didn't have bacon grease, I just doubled the butter. Thanks for sharing this, it brought my hubby some warm fuzzies as he has some great memories of his dad. Plain and simple, this is good comfort food!

My husband requested "tomato mac" like his mother used to make, I couldn't get ahold of her so I found this recipe hoping he would have liked it. This turned out okay and it wasn't anything impressive. I'm not a big fan of noodle dishes to begin with anyhow. I did finally get ahold of my mother-in-law and her recipe was so much more simple and so few ingredients I thought surely it was just going to taste worse than this one. I was so so wrong. All it required was butter to your liking (we use about half a stick or so) per one big box of dry macaroni, a diced onion, and one can of diced tomatoes. You melt the butter, soften the onions, throw the macaroni in as well as the can of diced tomatoes and one can of water. The BIG BIG difference I think in her recipe is that she tosses her macaroni in dry and then stirs it all well, throws the lid on and turns the heat completely off after bringing it up to a boil and lets the pasta sit and absorb all the tomato juices and butter.

THANK YOU for sharing this!  I was scrolling through looking for a new macaroni dish when I saw it.  This is one of those all time favorites that I grew up with, and now my kids make it for their families.

My version is only slightly different. I use the bacon grease & butter to sweat half a diced onion before adding everything together, and I always use petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed. (as a kid I hated all the little bits of celery & stuff in the stewed ones). If using diced instead of stewed...use a pinch more sugar.

Thanks again for sharing this!

I'm so glad i discovered this! As a poor college kid, I'm always excited to find cheap, yummy recipes, and this is definitely one of those!! So easy. I used extra butter instead of bacon grease, and added some garlic salt and Parmesan cheese. Will definitely make this over and over again!

Wow I thought we were the only ones who ate this...lol My husband won't even try it...but growing up in PA, my mom would use elbow macaroni, a jar of her home canned tomatoes, little butter, and pepper (salt was already in tomatoes) and I loved it! I make it frequently for myself, however...I never had it with bacon grease in until now...this version is very good...I think bacon flavor makes everything good...but I'll probably stick to my mom's version because I like just the taste of the tomatoes...thank you for the great recipe!

I was shocked to see this recipe! I thought only my family ate this. Since my dad wouldn't allow garlic in the house my step-mom came up with this acceptable recipe to satisfy the kids desire for spaghetti. Macaroni with canned tomatoes and tomato juice. I grew up loving this and so did my daughter. We thought it was so weird that we joked that we needed to lock the doors and draw the shades so nobody would know what we were eating! Who knew so many other love it as much as we do!

My Mom made this a lot growing up.  When we went to visit in the country she made it with home grown tomatoes.  That was the best!
We sometimes added ground beef and no, no to sugar or butter.  Just the bacon grease, macaroni, one small diced onion, 1 small can tomato sauce, 1 large can whole crushed tomatoes, salt and pepper.

I ate a ton of this growing up!  Still love it today.  I like it pretty basic.. with no sugar or bacon grease, using canned diced tomatoes instead of stewed, using only butter and seasonings: a dash of garlic salt, creole seasoning, and salt and pepper, if needed.  Mama never added tomato sauce way back in the day, but I do like that addition for more body. Soo good with hot cornbread!  Great childhood memories associated with this dish...

Oh how this brings back memories of my childhood!  This is a great recipe. True comfort food.  It's also great with some browned ground beef added as well.

This certainly brings back memories.  My mom used to make a similar version of this, in fact exactly the same, with one exception - she would add about a cup of Cheez Whiz. Served with a salad, fresh buns and beef sausages - great comfort food in the fall and winter!

I am 64 and have fond memories of my Mother making this when I was a child.  Mom just used a can of tomatoes and no tomato sauce, otherwise it is the same. I will be making this soon for my grandchildren.

Good. I like to fry up a package of bacon crispy and crumble up and use tomatoe paste small can with 1/2 cup water instead of the tomato sauce and the stewed tomatoes. Also, cut up onion and saute in the bacon grease and add some garlic powder.

This came out good! I didn't have any bacon (well didnt have time to thaw it) and since this was a quick last minute meal and what we have on hand i added sausage. My kids love it and ate every bit of it.

This is fast,inexpensive comfort food. When my sprogs were little they gobbled it up(no chunks or pieces of veggies!). When they were always hungry teenagers home during summer vacation I made it almost every day(2 bucks!! for a big pot of food) We never tire of it. Now it's just my old guy and me and I still use a pound of macaroni. Great recipe, thank you for bringing macaroni and tomatoes to people who may never have tried this classic comfort food. this recipe needs no changes except maybe... more butter! :D

I could hardly believe my eyes, that this recipe is on AR.  My Mom often made it - her version, now my version (as these things go), was to boil macaroni and add 1 can of condensed tomato soup (soup only, no water).  Stir the condensed soup into drained macaroni, add a bit of butter, salt & pepper to taste and enjoy!  mmmm, good!  Some reviewers talk about adding ground beef, tomatoes and tomato sauce:  in our family, that was called goulash and we had it often.  My brother and I both now cook goulash with onions and a green pepper (or another color pepper). (Our Dad would not eat onions or peppers -- poor Mom!  poor us!)  We add canned tomatoes -- brother likes his juicier, so adds tomato juice to it as well.  It *is* good.  But when I hear folks talk about jazzing up macaroni and tomato soup (or this recipe, macaroni and tomatoes), I just think, Nooooo!  :) It is what it is, and it's perfect that way.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!

I have been making something similar for years.  I use egg noodles, instead of macaroni, add plain, stewed, or rotel tomatoes. Add the sugar, salt and pepper.  That's it... It is more like a noodle soup, but so good. SHM

This is a great recipe.  I used rotel tomatoes for extra flavor and also added ground round to make a 1 pot meal.  We love this in the fall.  A good comfort food.

I make something similar with orzo noodles.  I can diced tomatoes, I can tomato juice, 2 cups water, salt pepper and butter , or olive oil.  Put it all in a large saucepan, bring to boil, reduce to simmer.  Cook for about 30 min, adding more water or tomato juice if it gets a little too dry.  Stir every once in a while.  When the pasta is done to your liking, it will have increased in volume a lot.  Adjust seasoning.  Sprinkle with feta cheese, or parmesan if you like.  My husband could eat the whole pot by himself!

Overall, this is basically a healthy recipe. I bumped up fiber by using whole wheat pasta. Its cheap, easy and better for you than many other pasta or rice dishes. Win-win!

I LOVE this! I've never had macaroni and tomatoes, and had never even thought to try such a combination. It turned out excellent! If you like tomatoes, go for it. I want to say that it's ALMOST as good as plain ol' mac and cheese.   I altered the recipe a little bit and added: -1 medium red pepper chopped -2 tablespoons of bacon bits -1/4 cup cheddar, mix in a little and top the macaroni with remaining cheese.

As a bonafide meat eater, this recipe didn't catch my eye right away. However, I couldn't resist the rave reviews and simplicity of the recipe made me go for it.

I have late tomatoes from garden so stewed them.  Used no tomato paste but all other ingredients.  Very tasty.  Will definitely make again.

This was a comfort food for me as a kid too. Very easy, although the bacon grease adds good flavor dont be afraid to leave it and the sugar out if you are cutting fat and calories.

What a wonderful memory brought back to my taste buds. I loved it. I altered it a wee bit by blanching about 5 tomatoes and removing the outer layer( peelings) I then chopped them up and placed them in the pan with 2 cups of macaroni along with the other ingredients. I added just a touch more bacon grease and it was lovely..... followed directions as stated and it turned out just right Thank you??????

I love this and have made it several times.  I first had macaroni and tomatoes at "Lambert's" restaurant.  This is very similar.  I sometimes add a little crushed red pepper if I want extra spice.  I've also done it with only the diced tomatoes, omitting the tomato sauce when I didn't have any.  That was good too.

I grew up on macaroni and tomatoes, with canned tomatoes out of the garden. I will settle for store bought canned. this recipe is perfect, I tried it with sugar, it was good. my preference is without the sugar and add salt! thanks

I grew up with some of my aunts making this. But I had never tried to make it. I almost cried because of the wonderful homey feelings of childhood it brought back. I put the butter and bacon grease in a skillet & sautéed some onions while my noodles were boiling. I added the drained noodles, a large can of diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, sugar, & pepper. Definitely gets better the longer it sets, so make it the day before & reheat.

We ate this a lot when I was a kid!  I needed to see a recipe because I couldn't believe that the dish I remembered was literally macaroni and tomatoes-almost nothing else. I left out the bacon grease to keep down the fat.  To the second helping I added some chopped fresh basil and that was a wonderful addition.

Looks a lot like what my mother used to make. Unfortunately the site has changed and I can no longer print the nutrition information or the modified size. Since my wife is on peritoneal dialysis the nutrition info is very important. No pleased with the new site.

I grew up on this recipe. It's total comfort food. I don't use bacon grease, butter or sugar. I also use diced tomatoes instead of stewed and mix some shredded cheddar cheese in to taste, cover the top with cheese, throw it in the oven and cook until it's bubbly & brown on top. YUMM!

Perfect comfort food!  I didn't have bacon grease and used fresh tomatoes (with juice)because I had tons of tomatoes from the farmer's market.  Also added chopped fresh basil just for fun...YUM.  Even my husband liked it (and he hates elbow pasta...go figure). Thanks for the recipe!

I make a variation of this all the time for my family and it is hearty and sits well with everyone.  I use 1 pound of ground beef with mine and the various flavors that Hunts' Chopped Tomatoes carries, i.e. Basil, Garlic, & Oregano plus I use 1 can of Tomato Sauce as well.  You can add mushrooms if you like and you can add cheese.  It is good!  We call it homemade "Beef-A-Roni".

My kids would say 5 stars, I say 4 because it is tasty and easy but I like a little more flavor added, but it's always easy to add more flavor and harder to come up with a good base recipe like this.

I decided to look up something to make with ingredients I had on hand, and this is what I chose.  It was surprisingly very good!  I guess you can't go wrong with macaroni and tomatoes.  I did add a pound of ground beef and an extra can of tomato sauce.  Will be making this again.
