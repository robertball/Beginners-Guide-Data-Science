Easy and delicious! I substituted the oil for apple sauce and did not melt butter on the bottom of the pan, instead I greased it with cooking spray. Also I omitted  the cherries as per another review I read! Thank you, it was a hit!

really really good. the addition of sour cream makes this cake so yummy and moist!! in fact, its so good that i use it as a base for other cakes instead of the directions on the cake mix box. i didnt care for the cherries in this cake, they tasted a lot like cough syrup to me but thats just a personal preference. I would definitely make it again but without the maraschino cherries or maybe use fresh ones. besides that i loved it!

Followed the recipe except for baking it in a bundt pan once and an angel food cake pan another time. Cake was well received and used Cool-Whip on top.

I'm a pretty good cook but am the furthest thing from a baker you'll find, And even I didn't mess this one up. Everyone raved over it. Thanks, It's a keeper!! Easy enough for the baking impaired.

I really loved this recipe.  It was easy to follow and the cake was awesome!  I used a large muffin pan and made 12 small cakes.  Cooking time is about 20 minutes with this adjustment.

Absolutely wonder.  I made them in cupcake tins, and they turned out perfect.  Shorten the baking time, but otherwise, came out superb.

I am NOT a baker but this was easy to do and turned out great!  The cake is so moist (I had to extend the baking time).  My husband loves pineapple and coconut so he got this for his birthday.  Big hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I love baking but am not a fan of pineapple upside-down cake.  I made it for my husband on his birthday since he loves it and it turns out I liked this recipe!  It's VERY easy to make and came out great.  Thanks!
