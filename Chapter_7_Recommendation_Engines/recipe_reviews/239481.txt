I've been cooking apples in the microwave for years.  It didnt say to peel the apples, but I always do.  The one thing that I didn't care about with this recipe is that the apples are on the dry side.  If you add a little water right at the beginning, this will help.  The recipe says "diced," and I went ahead and diced them, but I simply didn't like them this small (personal preference), and will go back to cutting them into larger chunks in the future...takes a little longer, but not much.  And your cooking time will depend on the power of your microwave plus the size of the apple pieces.

I made this recipe and it is delicious! It makes a very simple, fast, and yummy breakfast for the mornings. However this dish tastes better if you microwave it for  one to one and a half minutes longer to get that sort of syrup at the bottom of your bowl. Also if you want it to be more healthy, leave out the sugar it will taste very much the same.

I'm giving it a 5 because I wouldn't have even thought of doing this in the microwave.  I had pink lady apples, not Galas, and even with 2 mins cooking they weren't oven soft.  But raw apples hurt my teeth, and I could probably put them in another minute if I want.  I did add a bit of butter to this and used light brown sugar instead.  Yummy!  I may use Truvia next time so this becomes a healthier alternative.  Thanks!

Doubled the recipe, cooked on lower heat for a little longer (covered), used larger chunks and subbed maple syrup for sugar.

Super simple, quick, and tasty! Skip the sugar, and it’s a great snack or breakfast for babies 1 year and older, toddlers, and kids.

I have some Granny Smith apples I need to use up for a family member with upcoming dental work (who also doesn't like applesauce), so I was looking for a quick and easy way to soften them. I omitted the sugar and added cloves for their oral anaesthetic properties as well as their flavor. Although it doesn't say to, I peeled and cored the apples before dicing. Because I wanted to make them softer, I also covered the dish in the microwave and cooked them 1 minute at a time for about 4  minutes total plus 3 or 4 minutes of  stand times. The way I made them they are quite tart, and I might feel like adding the sugar when I make them in the future.

I just used one big apple instead of two. It tasted good. Very cinnamony. I wish I looked at the number of servings before I dug in! My brother and I ate half a bowl (two servings), and very soon after ... we fell asleep. Probably because of the cinnamon. I think the softness depends on the type of apple you're using. I used a hard red one so it did get soft, but not too much.

a new staple both at work and at home.  i made a huge batch for a breakfast pot luck at work and all that was left was the empty dish. my gluten free co workers appreciated a dish they could enjoy. At home,  my kids said it tastes yummy like Apple pie filling.  i can't believe its so easy to make!!  Thank you for the great recipe.

Easy peasy and a hit. Tart Granny Smiths are the perfect match.

I made this according to the stated recipe. I did peel the apples first, and instead of water on the bottom I had some leftover mango juice. I used artificial sweetener instead of sugar, but it turned out excellent anyway. I'm going to make the full recipe next time and turn it into applesauce!

These are pretty good, but I did have to microwave them way longer than it says to get them soft. Could just be my microwave though.
