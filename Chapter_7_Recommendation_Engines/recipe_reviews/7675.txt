I went to post this same recipe tonight and saw it was here already!! It is great. The only thing I do differently is cut out more than 50% of the fat by using 1/2 cup oil and the other cup I use fat free sour cream.

One of my family's favorite cakes. Sooooo delicious, you have to try it if you never have! It is very rich and moist and flavorful and chockful of good things, and children love it, too. The cake ingredients are just stirred together, so it couldn't be simpler to make. The cream cheese frosting is also fool-proof and is the perfect complement to the fruit flavors in the cake ('though I make double the amount of frosting and use it all!). By the way, this makes a big, magnificent birthday cake.

This was a delicious cake. The only thing that I would change for the next time I make it is add another can of pineapple. I didn't really taste it. But other than that it was perfect.

Made this cake for Christmas dessert and it was good.  I did sub apple sauce for the oil only because I did not have any and it tasted great very moist.

I loved this cake.  I added an extra 1/2 cup pineapple, drained and frosted with Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting from this site.

I know I'm the lone wolf reviewer, but this taasted like bananna bread with runny icing.  The icing did set up a bit after refrigerated, but it was a bit too thin.  (My cupcakes were completely cooled, so it wasn't heat that melted the icing.) I left out the nuts, and made 24 cupcakes with the cake mix because I was having about 10 children over.  One of boys told me "they weren't very good", and sadly, a few were left unfinished.  The kids that did like them, said they tasted like bananna bread.  I think I'll pass on fixing this again.

Let me tell anyone out there who wants to make this cake...do not HESITATE another minute. This is my go-to cake for any event. It is the most fabulous and you'll have to tie down people hands from eating the whole thing right then and there...before dinner even LOL. I frosted just the top with vanilla frosting, but I'm sure cream cheese frosting would be wonderful. My method was: mix all wet ingredients, then dry making sure the bkg soda has no lumps (yuck) and is mixed in well. Then incorporate the bananas and pineapple and walnuts just to fold them in and stop mixing there. The cake is dense and just so lovely with just enough cinnamon. I think I would add raisins too for a variation at times.

Terrific cake. I scaled it up to 16 servings, which makes a very generous 3 layer cake in 9 inch pans. I added extra pineapple and banana. In addition, I used not only cinnamon, but also nutmeg, cloves, and allspice. When it comes to spices and seasonings, more often than not, I cook by instinct, so I didn't measure the spices, but the cake was excellent. I made a double serving of cream cheese frosting, as I do not like to skimp on frosting.

I thought this would be a nice change from banana bread/cake - I like the idea of the pineapple... but it massively lacked in flavour to me. The only thing that saved it was the cream cheese frosting. I'll stick to my banana bread thanks...

Made this into a 9x13 sheet cake. Came out perfectly. I especially liked the frosting -- mine wasn't runny at all. I do think I would add another 8oz of pineapple in the future. Thanks for sharing!

This cake was moist and delicious. The only modifications I made were that I used pecans instead of walnuts and I used cake flour.  Yummy!!!  Thanks!

Excellent cake!  I made a similar recipe for my host father's birthday when I was a foreign exchange student in Austria two years ago. The only difference between this one and the one I used (which I've checked against this one and they have the same proportions of ingredients) is that the one I used called for another cup of chopped walnuts to be sprinkled on top.  I'm mentioning this only because by mistake I put the whole two cups of chopped walnuts into the cake!  The only other changes were that I put in more cinnamon and the cake was baked in a bread loaf pan because we didn't have any cake pans.  Also, I didn't bother with the cream cheese frosting because it was so good without!  I definitely recommend the extra cup of nuts and leave off the frosting if you'd like it a bit healthier.
