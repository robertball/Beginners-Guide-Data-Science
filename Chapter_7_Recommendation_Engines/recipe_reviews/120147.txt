I had been looking for this recipe for years.  Like another reviewer, I added 2 boxes of pudding & a handful of chopped pistachios to the whipped topping.  It is wonderful!!!  Next time I think I will add a little more pineapple and reserve the juice to combine with the pudding mix before I add it to the whipped topping (to make it easier to incorporate without making it "gritty").

I make this every year for Thanksgiving.  I only use 8 oz of Cool Whip.  I have never added the green food coloring, but I do garnish with mandarin oranges, and use either walnuts or pecans.  Very pretty, and the oranges  help to cut the sweetness of this dish.

This is excellent! The food coloring... Although I didn't have any on hand, I do see why one might want to add it. With 16OZ of whipped cream, the color of the pistachio pudding mix fades out. It is a prettier green when using just 8OZ of whipped cream. Which I did first for comparison. I also added crushed nuts into the mix as I did for garnishing on top. My #2 grand-daughter came into the kitchen as I finished making this. I gave her some to try...(her eyes lit up as she put a spoonful in her mouth) and she said, "Granny, this is SOOOOO GOOD!!!". I guess that says it all! :)

Happy New Year 2009"

We always made this with cottage cheese instead of marshmallows. Still tastes sweet and yummy but a much healthier choice.

This is a favorite of my husband. I don't make it too often unless I am bringing it to a potluck since it's more dessert than salad. I have prepared it by using an 8-os size whipped topping and adding a cup of sour cream with the pudding. Makes it a bit less "fluffy" and more flavorful. Try some toasted coconut as garnish.

Make this! It's so easy and resulted in rave reviews- both kids and adults just loved it. Make sure you build in enough time to thaw the whipped topping- up to 5 hours in the fridge.

This is always a hit.  If you're not a big marshmallow fan, it's good with less or even no marshmallows.

This is so good.  I made a few changes.  Added  pineapple tidbits(drained) instead of crushed.  Loved the texture.  Also added unsweetened shredded coconut and less marshmellows than what the recipe calls for.   Didn't have food color so I didn't add.  Next time I will try it with sugar free coolwhip combined with extra creamy cool whip.

Really good made with real whipped cream.  I don't add the food coloring, it's green enough already.

I've always loved this stuff at pot-luck dinners and decided to finally make it myself. This recipe was fantastic! I used a 12 ounce container of cool whip instead of 16. Other than that, I kept everything else the same. Oh, and I used walnuts because pistachios are insanely expensive, and it was perfect!

Yes to fluffiness! My brother had made this for xmas eve and I thought it was pretty good considering I don't like pineapples that much. The only change he made was ro use pecans (finely chopped) instead of walnut or pistacios.

I have been making this for many years...I use 1 container of Whipped Cream (Not sure of the size), 1 Pkg of Pistachio Pudding, 1 Pkg Coloured Marshmallows, and 1 Can of Pineapple Tidbits (Drained, but not all the way).  It's a great salad.  I've never added food colouring or nuts...but as a twist, you can add: Chopped maraschino Cherries, Coconut, Mandarin Oranges, or even fruit cocktail!  Just make sure you drain any of the add-ons completely, or your "salad" will be too juicy!

OH YUM! How can something so simple taste so good? I did something a little different with this, however. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I only chilled it for about an hour & then put it in a graham cracker pie crust as a dessert. I did have some of the filling left so will serve that with dinner tonight. Two meals in one recipe..now that's a bargain!

Really very good and so quick and easy!! Very similar to another recipe I use all the time. I was looking for something a little different. Definately worth it! Will make again! Didn't need the food coloring, the color was fine.

Hmmm... This was just so-so for me. My hubs wouldn't touch this (he's not a fan of Jell-O based salads), but my parents really enjoyed it. I remember this from my childhood (and liking it MUCH better then). Either my palate has changed or what I had as a child was prepared slightly different. For me, the pistachio flavor was overwhelming and the pineapple was pretty much non-existent. I was hoping for a bit of sweetness, but all I could taste was the pudding mix (and I even used less of it - 3 (1 oz.) packages worth of the sugar-free variety). NOTE: Feel free to use fat-free and / or sugar-free ingredients. I did and could not tell a difference (and saved a few calories to boot). Pretty pastel marshmallows made this Easter appropriate although I would suggest NOT adding the food coloring (or use less of it) if you want to see them lol! Thanks anyways, Pattie. :-)

It was good.  My mother-in-law makes something like this and since I couldn't reach her I went to this recipe.  I did not add the food coloring. I saw no need to and I added a few sliced green marchino cherries.  It was a quick and easy potluck dish and it was enjoyed by most who had it.

This recipe was great.  I drain 2 cans of fruit cocktail and add them to the mix and 2 cans of mandarin oranges.  It tasted great.  Everyone loved it.

Great!  I topped it with maraschino cherries instead of nuts and used it for a Christmas potluck.

Very yummy and quite easy!  I took this to a potluck and I made the night before.  The prep time was about 5 minutes, which I love anything that saves me time.

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch and it was a big hit!  I used chopped walnuts in place of pistachios and used multi-colored flavored marshmallows and it was wonderful!  Will definately make again!

This was a fairly easy and tasty recipe.  But, I think it needed a little something extra.  Maybe some more pineapples or pineapple juice, I tasted a lot of the marshmallow flavor.  It was still really good and we definitely ate it all up!

Very rich, and yummy, and quick!  I used regular fruit cocktail instead of pineapple and added a larger helping of fruit than recommended to help cut the sweetness.  I also suggest blending the nuts into the salad.

This was a hit at my office potluck today. I was a bit disappointed that I didn't have the food coloring, but evidently it didn't matter too much. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful!  Only used 8 oz of Lite Cool Whip - and left off the nut topping so the kids would eat it.  I'll make this again and again!  I made this day before the dinner party.

This is always a hit.  Sometimes, I add in a couple of sliced bananas and a drained can of mandarin oranges when making this salad.  Great for a side dish or dessert.

I have loved this salad since I was a child. So glad I found the recipe. There are quite a few on here and some are called 'Watergate Salad' however, I believe, at least to me and my family, that this is the best recipe on All Recipes. This version has the measurements as they should be (IMHO) and it is critical that you do not drain the pineapple. Quick to whip up and holds in the refrigerator a minimum of four days. Our usually doesn't last that long. I always make it on Thanksgiving and Christmas. I do not add the food coloring but the green of the Jello Pistachio gives it the color you see in the picture.

Reminds me of the Pistachio salad that my Grandma use to make! It's a little too sweet for us but very yummy.

Delicious! Made it for a graduation party and changed the serving size to serve 50. It made two huge bowls of it and there was a ton left over. I put marshmallows in one dish and left them out in the other.

Very easy and really good!  I used 1 cup whipped whipping cream instead of coolwhip and it wasn't too sweet at all.  Will make again.

My fam. liked this one.  I added bananas (I love them in fruit salads) I used 8 oz of cool whip in the salad and used the rest as a dollop on top to mellow the pistachio flavor.  Don't skip the nuts!  I used chopped walnuts on top and it was my favorite part.... def. more than just a garnish here!  Thanks!

Used this as a St. Patrick's day dessert for our family dinner. It turned out very nice. I only used an 8 oz. Cool Whip (lite) because that was what I had on hand. It worked fine and everyone really enjoyed this... thanks for a keeper!
