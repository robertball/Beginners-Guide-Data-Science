This was really yummy and even prettier to serve.  I blended a spoonful of Cool Whip into the yogurt.  It gave it a smoother texture and was a little stiffer, so the top layer of yogurt didn't run down over the blueberries, hiding those pretty layers.  The layer order went yogurt, cookie crumbs, blueberries, repeat.  I served these at a brunch baby shower and put them in little punch glasses with a mint leaf on top (that's my picture with the recipe) and they just looked so classy sitting at everyone's place setting.

This is a great dessert!  We substituted vanilla yogurt for lemon and used wild blueberries we picked at the top of Pleasant Mountain in Maine.  I will definitely make this again!

We bought WAY TOO MANY fresh blueberries so I was searching for ways to use them before they spoiled. We have had this for a dessert three times in the past week and everyone polisheed off every bite - all three times! Its a nice light summer dessert that is very refreshing and so good for you!

Who knew something so yum could be so good for you too? I used Greek yogurt and was thrilled to see the health benefits of ginger snaps! This makes a terrific breakfast as is and if in a hurry, would also make a super smoothie. Thank you!!

We loved this. We added some strawberries for 4th of July picnic. Big hit! I also added the cool whip to yogurt for creaminess. Excellent!

I really liked the combination of these flavours together. I used wild blueberries because they're sweeter and have more flavour. A really nice change for breakfast.

Cool and refreshing.  I used Yoplait original blueberry acai yogurt instead of lemon yogurt but I would like to try it that way next!  I also used graham cracker crumbs.  A very nice quick and healthy snack.  I enjoy all recipes that make use of the abundance of South Jersey blueberries we have in July!

I used crushed oatmeal cookies instead of gingersnaps and lowfat vanilla yogurt instead of lemon. HUGE hit with the fam. This can easily bend to fit whatever cookie/fruit/yogurt you have on hand. This will be a great afternoon snack or quick dessert, too.

This was really delicious. With no lemon yogurt in the fridge, I mixed in a little lemon zest to vanilla yogurt which worked perfectly. I love the combination of flavors, and this is quick and easy for a snack, breakfast, and would even be great for a light dessert. If you don't have gingersnaps, crush up a few graham crackers and add some ground ginger. Gingersnap granola would work well, too. The flavor really is nice with the lemon and blueberry.

I am rating as a 4 just because I am not big on ginger snaps.  I did like the flavor, and nutritious value.  I used Yoplait thick and creamy lemon meringue yourt.  It worked well.  Next time I may try crumbled graham crackers or granola instead of ginger snaps.

Yummy and healthy snack or dessert.  The flavors are very complementary together. I will make this again and again.  It looks pretty in a parfait glass too.

Fresh and light tasting.  It was really good.  Since I was taking it to a friends house I also added the whip cream, but at home I'd spare myself the calories.  I wish the ginger snaps would have stayed crunchy longer so next time I will assemble at the party rather than at home.

Yum! This was very good. I used blackberries because that's what I had. Like others, I also scooped a spoonful of coolwhip into the yogurt and used graham crackers. My family loved it!! Thank you!

This was delicious. I love gingersnap cookies and anything that is blueberry. When I read the recipe I felt I could not afford the ingredients but decided to splurge.  I live on a tropical island and everything is imported, so prices are astronomical.  When trying a new recipe, I must give it a lot of consideration before spending money on something I may not enjoy. I knew by reading the ingredients and the comments that I would enjoy. It did not disappoint.
BTW, these 3 very simple ingredients cost me the equivalent of $24.00US but what the heck, will fore-go some other little luxury food item this month.

This was good for a quick dessert fix.  I think I would like it better with strawberries which I will try next time.  Just a personal preference.  I did take JODILICIOUS's advice and added fat-free cool whip to the yogurt.  Thanks

This was really good. All the flavors blended together nicely.  Great summer time dessert.
