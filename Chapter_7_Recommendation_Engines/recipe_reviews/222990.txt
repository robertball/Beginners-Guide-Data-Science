I made these for some guests who can't have white potatoes and they LOVED them.  I was making a double batch, and I didn't want to take the time to fry them, so I put all of the ingredients into a Ziploc bag and tossed to coat.  I then baked them in the oven for about 40 minutes or so until the sides were a little crispy.  Everyone wanted the recipe!

Yum! These are a great, healthy way to sneak vegetables into your kids. My three-year-old had no problem polishing off his helping! The spices add to the sweet flavor with a bit of kick. The only thing I would recommend is baking the fries at 425 for 40 minutes on a cookie sheet instead of pan frying them. I tried pan frying a handful of them and then baked the rest in the oven, but the pan fried ones didn't turn out nearly as good as the baked ones. It is true that sweet potato fries don't get as crispy as regular potatoes, so don't expect these to be crunchy; just expect them to be delicious!

My family devoured these! I followed the recipe with the exact ingredients, then I baked them on my perforated pizza pan at 425 degrees for 40 minutes. They were deliciously crunchy on the outside and soft and sweet on the inside. These will be made with many dinners in my household!

These were awesome! The seasoning was perfect, and we cooked the fries in batches.  The whole family really liked these. It was a nice change of pace from russet potatoes!

I love sweet potatoes and have been looking for a great fry recipe. I found this one but did not want to pan fry. I made the recipe using all of the spices as they are in the recipe only I used just 2 very big Yams (yams are sweeter than sweet potatoes). I baked them at 450 for 40 minutes. Halfway thru the time I pulled them out and flipped them. I put maybe 2T of olive oil on the baking sheet to keep them from sticking. They turned out great!!

I made these sweet potato fries with seasonings per recipe, with the exception I fried them in my Phillips Air Fryer (how I love this appliance!)  I only used a few drops of olive oil to toss them with the seasonings, set air fryer at 350º for 10 minutes.  I scaled the recipe down for 1 serving with a small sweet potato.  The fries came out crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside and not oily at all. Air Frying is a healthy alternative for fried food lovers (also cooks a great steak). I had the fries for breakfast with some sausage and sliced tomato.  Delicious.

These were great, but I did make some adjustments (just for my own preferences, nothing wrong with the recipe itself)! Like some other reviewers, I opted to bake them at 425 degrees for 40 minutes... the frying and turning just sounded too time consuming. I used cumin instead of steak spice and added a dash of cayenne. Spicy & delish!

Awesome recipe. Took out the paprika. 2 large sweet potatoes made enough for my family of 4! We will be making these a weekly side at my house.

Very yummy! I baked instead of fried and the last few minutes broiled to get them a little crispy.

These were great!  Everyone liked them except for my wife.  She normally hates sweet potatoes but she tried one and thought it was ok.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is the time needed to cook.  I made several batches and it took a while to pan fry them.  I might try baking them next time.  Thanks!

I made these on the BBQ and they were amazing. I microwaved them first for about 2 to 3 minutes then coated them with olive oil, and then the spices. Turned out amazing. I make them with either a portobello mushroom burger, or a black bean veggie burger. One of my favourite recipes!

These were fantastic. I used 2 sweet potatoes as that was plenty for us. Instead of baking I put them in an air fryer for about 12 minutes and they were the perfect amount of soft and crispy. I will definitely make these again.

Didn't have steak seasoning and used some mustard powder and a bit of extra garlic powder. They came out great & we'll definitely have it again! Good recipe!

I've been making this recipe for years - it's THAT good!! I only use 1 or 2 tablespoons of oil to toss the fries in, add the seasoning, then bake in the oven at 425°.

Delicious! Inhaled them so fast. However, a little disappointed that they're soft and not crisp and crunchy.

The spiece blend is fantastic, deffinitly going to make it again. Just make sure your watching over it to insure you end up with crispy fries. If you overcook or undercook you'll waste the flavour potential....trust me :s

Would make again, but used air fryer  no salt is needed or necessary.  Used crushed 4 cloves of garlic instead of powder. Added turmeric.

Thanks for sharing!  Lost my spicy fry recipe and have been looking for years for another.  This is it and much easier than the one I lost!  I’ve been trying to cut back on oil so omitted the oil and added a squirt of mustard - just enough to add a little moisture so the spices would stick.  Used Montreal Steak seasoning.  Cooked at 400 for 13 min in air fryer.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe & mine turned out mushy soft. I pan fried uncovered for a while to dry up & crisp the outsides. I recommend baking instead of pan frying. Baked SP fries always turn out great

I have to watch my postassium and sodium.  I twice boiled the sweet potato and omitted the salt.    I think they came out great.  Twice boiling removes about half the potassium.  I use this method when I make green bean stew with sweet potato

They turned out fantastic. I didnt have steak spice so i used seasoning salt and omitted the regular salt. I also cooked mine in a pot of oil simply because i find it safer. Loved them and will definitely make them again

I made these and they were fantastic! I baked them at 400 for 40 minuets turning the potatoes over half way through. Will make them again super easy.

I must admit I baked them in the oven and was disappointed that they did not crisp up, but such is the nature of the sweet potatoe, I believe. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.

I made these this afternoon for the first time.  Wow.  My husband was stunned with how delicious they were.  We used a little ranch dressing as dip.  

I put the lid on snugly, and after the first 5 minutes of cooking, there was a lot of moisture in the pan and the fries hadn’t browned. So I tilted the lid just a bit to allow the moisture to escape.  That did the trick.  The fries came out browned and tender.

Flavor was good even though they were kind of soggy.  Don't think you can really get fry texture unless you deep fry!  Didn't really measure the seasoning just sprinkled it on to our taste.  I did like the steak seasoning flavor even though I was a little apprehensive.

So I followed exact recipe minus doing in the oven as others suggested. 40 minutes was way to long and most of them burned. Will try 20-25 minutes next time.
The ones that I actually tasted though we're really good.

Might have been the steak seasoning I used, but we didn't love the taste. They were also pretty soggy. Hope you have better luck!

I also baked mine for 40 minutes or so at 425 degrees. The flavor and texture are delicious.  I used Chicago steak seasoning and it really is the mystery ingredient. Terrific recipe!

I had no garlic powder.  I substituted crushed, finely chopped fresh garlic and mixed it in with the dry spices.  It was yummy. :)

I'd do this again. :)

Excellent results!  Better than ones we've had in restaurants :) I served them with Sriracha mayo from this site and we polished them off in no time! Will also try them in the oven as others suggested . Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good!! Couldn't get them crispy, but I guess that's to be expected with Sweet Potato fries! They were delicious! I added more black pepper and some extra creole seasoning... Mmm!! Served with Jalepeno CC burger. Perfect! Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)

These were fantastic. I baked these to go with some bakes salmon and they were all gone almost immediately. I used a Montreal steak seasoning and extra pepper for a little kick. I also broiled the fries in the last 5 minutes, and they really crisped up! I will be trying these fried using some cornstarch next time.

I ran the sweet potatoes through a French fry attachment on my food processor, leaving the peels on for added nutrition. We took the advice of another reviewer and used cumin instead of steak seasoning because we don't keep steak seasoning on hand. I also baked them, covered in foil for about 45 minutes at 400 degrees instead of frying them. We really enjoyed them!

I was looking to make sweet potato fries and came across this recipe.  The seasonings were "just right" and easy to prepare the fries.  I did bake mine in the oven, rather than frying on the stove, but that worked well for me--although, next time I would use the non-stick type of foil for ease of removing them from the baking sheet.  Loved this seasoning combo!  Thanks for the recipe!

These fries were fantastic and will go in my favorite column. I followed the advice of other reviewers and did not microwave them. After cutting in wedges I tossed them with all the other ingredients using my hands. This made it easier to coat the fries more evenly. I placed the fries on the sheet pan all facing the same direction. This makes it easier to make sure that all the fries get turned half way through baking. I baked them for 25 minutes per side. They came out perfectly cooked. I used the 50%mayo / 50% maple syrup dipping sauce found on AR adding some lemon juice to balance the sweetness. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for dinner tonight, the fries turned out great! I mixed everything in a gallon size ziplock bag and baked for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. Delicious, this recipe is a keeper. Thanks for posting!

Really liked this recipe and I took the advice of others and baked them instead of using a skillet. The seasoning was perfect and I cant wait to make them again.

These fries were fabulous ! Just the right amount of perfect spices. I will definitely be making them again and again. The only thing I did different was  I baked them in the oven @ 425 for about 10-15 minutes. Crispy and delicious :)

This was a good way to make these. Usually, I bake them and they burn a bit.  This way seems better but you must watch them closely the last 5 min or so because they can start to burn quick.  The seasoning was spot on, I just added a touch more garlic because we love garlic. Will make again!

This is a pretty danged good base recipe.   I would like them crisper than what this recipe gives me, so I think next time I will pan fry as this recipe calls for, but finish them off in the oven.

Loved this recipe. Baked at 450 degrees for 40 min, just as another reviewer suggested. Added a little nutmeg and cinnamon. Will make again.

LOVED these! Big hit when I brought them to a party! However I cooked them significantly longer, about 20-30 minutes more!

these were very yummy.. tried making them in the oven and maybe we sliced too thin bc 40 mins at 425 was wayyy too long.. we checked at 20 min's and they were cooked.. bf wanted to see if we could get a little crisp on them.. from what we were able to salvage, we totally loved them.. will maybe try cooking in the pan.. just wish i could do it all in one batch.. either way.. ty for the recipe

This was awesome!  It was just me so I only used half a sweet potato, added spices, cooked in olive oil and it was delicious!  Thanks!
