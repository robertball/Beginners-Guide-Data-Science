Had to bake them a few minutes longer, but they turned out fine, The teenager loved them, we'll be making them again.

We liked it a lot! Really easy to make, very adaptable to either large or small groups, and it tastes pretty good. Ours cooked faster than rhe recipe said, but that is the only change I would suggest.

Hubby said he'd make again, but we'll change things up a little.  We'll use more mozzarella cheese & pepperoni.  Think might try adding some mushrooms also.  It is a good basic recipe & you could use Italian sausage or different bacon also.

These are very good. I did cut recipe down to use only 1 tube biscuits. Instead of cubed cheese I shredded it. It's just like eating mini pizzas. I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe. Next time I will try adding some sauce inside biscuits.
