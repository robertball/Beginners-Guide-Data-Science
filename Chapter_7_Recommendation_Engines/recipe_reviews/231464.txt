I made this recipe according to the directions, and even though we love each and every ingredient, they just didn't seem to go together very well.  Maybe just leaving out the honey would have made it better.  The beer flavor doesn't really add much for us.  It smelled yummy while cooking this, so I had high expectations for the results.  Maybe someone can come up with a better way to remedy my review!

It's not bad. I tried it Heineken, though. I'm in the middle east and I can't find Sam Adams. So, maybe that detracts from my final judgement. I think it could go without the rosemary, though. Then maybe it will be worthy of a higher ranking. I might make it again, though. Except this time put it on some fish. It would probably be good with tilapia.
