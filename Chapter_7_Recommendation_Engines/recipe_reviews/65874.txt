I didn't actually make the Ham of this recipe, I made the cranberry relish.  I live overseas and you can't buy fresh or frozen cranberries here and I really wanted to make a cranberry sauce for Christmas.  The only thing I did different was I pureed it after it was cooked.  Not quite the same as a fresh cranberry sauce but, a very tasty and close substitute~!^^  Thank you

I didn't use the glaze in this recipe, but I did use the relish- I wanted something different from the normal cranberry sauce out of a can. I made it today for our Christmas dinner and everyone LOVED it!! I made it one day before and chilled it overnight. It has a beautiful presentation and the taste was wonderful.
