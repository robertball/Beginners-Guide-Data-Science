I happened to have a sweet potato that I needed to use, but no almonds or coconuts. So it went without. The fluff was soft sweet tasting, without any unusual flavors or textures. Definitely good, nearing impressive, but not really worth the calories. All that butter and sugar! Hense the 4. Don't tell your guests what's in it and I'd give it a 5.

This recipe is certainly more a dessert than a side dish.  We enjoy it, especially the crumble topping.

A tad too sweet for my tate as a side but I made it the second time in a graham cracker pie crust and was an excellent dessert. If I make it again as a casserole I'll cut back the sugar and a cinnamin

My family really liked it but I felt it was to sweet. Next time i am going to double the amount of sweet potatoes and slim down on the brown sugar pecan topping. Otherwise it was delicious tasted just like pie.
