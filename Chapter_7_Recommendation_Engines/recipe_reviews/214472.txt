I took another reviewer's suggestion and added what I had left of a small jar of artichoke hearts hanging out in the fridge. I just made sure to drain them and pat them dry. I made no other changes. This. Is. CRACK. No, really. I can't get enough. I've been spreading it on sliced cucumbers and carrot chips and I can't seem to stop. Dangerous dip.

I made this as an emergency appetizer for book club and it was a big hit.  I used about a half cup of feta because I love it and also added a little mayonnaise because my favorite store bought version has a slight mayo taste.  To avoid a trip to the store for sun dried tomato pesto, I attempted to make it myself.  Based on another recipe from this site, I added two sun dried tomatoes (in oil), a few fresh basil leaves, a splash of balsamic vinegar, and about a half teaspoon of garlic paste.  Finally, I added a splash of fat free half and half to thin it out a bit as it was very thick with the added feta. I will definitely make this again and not feel as guilty as when I eat the store bought kind.

Quick and easy recipe that is great served with crackers, warm pita bread, or veggies (for crackers I recommend a wheat or multigrain cracker to balance the flavor). I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and added an additional half tablespoon of the sun-dried tomato pesto.

First of all, I brought this dip to a bachelorette party and it was a HUGE success. That being said I did make a few changes. I couldn't find sun-dried tomato pesto, so I just used regular. I also threw about 3-4 maritnated artichoke pieces into the food processor as well when blending.

Beyond that I agreed with another reviewer that made as directed the dip comes out almost more like a cheese log consistency, which would hold up fine to cut veggies but was a little too thick for the pita and bagel chips I had. So I added about 1/4 c each lite sour cream and fat free creamer. This made it more dip like and absolutely addictive. 

I loved this and so did my company. I gave 4 stars since as is the recipe was too thick in my opinion but the flavor was spot on!

Very good dip!  I used lite cream cheese and reduced-fat feta with great results.  I refrigerated overnight and then served with crackers and veggies.

Tastes great, calling it a "dip" is a stretch though, it's very thick!  Thinned it out with some milk and added chopped artichokes.  Yummy!

I made this and let it sit overnight. I did double the recipe, as I was making it for a crowd. My mistake was to use the grated parm in the green container...it was pretty overpowering, and not in a good way. The other flavors are nice, but I should have used a better quality parmesan, and will do so next time. Served with parmesan-basil wheat thins. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for an appetizer on Thanksgiving to hold off the starving pilgrims while I waited for my turkey to finish.  They absolutely loved it! I followed the recipe to the t and it was FANTASTIC! I served it with both celery and crackers. WONDERFUL! Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is great!  So fast and so easy!  I actually added an extra tablespoon of the sun-driend tomato pesto.  One tablespoon is a great starter and it is easy to add more depending on your taste!

This was a good dip. The feta cheese is a little overpowering, and I love feta cheese.

This dip was so easy to make, I made it for my friend and I when we had a girls movie night. The two of us ate the whole thing. The flavor was outstanding. Thanks for sharing.

This was good, but not exceptional - it definitely come out more like a cheese ball than a dip

VERY important....as others have said this is a cheese ball type consistency. I needed a dip, as I was presenting in a bread bowl and wouldn't work if made as is. Another reviewer mentioned adding milk and am I glad I read that! I didn't measure, but added a TON and it turned out great. Tastes good, but I'm sure will be fantastic once it sits overnight. With such powerful individual ingredients I think letting it sit overnight for the flavors to blend is probably pretty important.

O.K.  but I thought it needed a kick--like hot sauce or cayenne or even diced jalapenos.  I used with bland vegetables:  celery, carrots, cucumber, colored peppers.

So incredibly yummy that I'm trying not to eat the whole thing before Bunco tonight.  That's in 2 1/2 hours.  I may have to make another batch. Who would have thought these four simply ingredients would make such an unbelievable dip?

Not my favorite. Maybe it's the tomato pesto flavor that I didn't like?  I won't be making this one again. Company did eat it...  But the hummus (from this site) went WAY faster.
