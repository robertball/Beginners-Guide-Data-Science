One of the best homemade Indian recipes I have tried. I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I 1) used canned green chiles because I forgot to buy a fresh one 2) added fresh cilantro at the end (along with the lemon juice). Served with jasmine rice and oven roasted cauliflower. Hubs liked it and so did the kids!

Seriously yum!  And simple to make. I used canned diced tomatoes, but other than that made it as described.

Love this. So delicious, a terrific balance of flavors... Just A+ all the way around. Even my husband, who doesn't particularly like chickpeas, liked this.

This had a decent taste spice wise (not very hot) but was too strong of a tomato flavor for us.  Also didn't love the consistency/texture - not sure exactly why.

So so so good.   Finally a recipe that matched the taste of a local restaurant’s channa masala that sadly closed down.  I used (2) Serrano peppers and 3/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to bump up the heat.  Also added fresh chopped cilantro at the end into the mix and then as a garnish.    Will for sure be making this again.

This is a great weeknight recipe, very simple and delicious. I don't use tomatoes and instead use a small can of tomatoe sauce. Has a rich flavor and is easy on the wallet too!

Excellent! I was making tandoori chicken & wanted to make an Indian side dish to compliment. I happened to have all the ingredients (except the jalapeño, so made a quick run to the store) and was able to put this together for dinner tonight. It was better than the chicken. I have to admit that I used canned garbanzo beans and canned stewed tomatoes, but it was still soooo good! I only used 1 jalapeño, but we love spice so will use 2 next time. Topped with cilantro and also had jasmine rice and naans, but the Chana masala was the star of the show.

I used a can of diced tomato instead of a whole tomato, and let it cook longer.  It also needed more salt than just a dash.  2 dashes at least..

I love Indian food,but here in my small town we do not have a restaraunt and I have to make my own to get my fix. This is delicious! I serve it with Nam and rice and spinach paneer.

I did make this again but I cut down on the lemon. The first time I made it I used a fairly large lemon and it was too much.

This is simple and great, simply great! I doubled the tomato sauce and yogurt as well as added chicken. I, too, used canned green chilies and it was still delicious!
