Loved the freshness of this dish! No packaged seasonings or other ready-made ingredients. And I swear bacon makes EVERYTHING taste better! I didn't bother to remove the cooked bacon from the pan - just added the onion and peppers into the drippings, then proceeded with the recipe as directed. Simple fresh ingredients that made for a delicious side dish with Quick and Easy Mexican Chicken and Best Black Beans, recipes also from this site.

I didn't have jalapeno peppers so I used taco seasoning mix from a packet (has chili powder, cumin, etc.) Just DELISH!!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, it's easy and a keeper.

This turned out really well. I used half homemade chicken broth and tomato sauce in place of the plain water. I also omitted the jalapenos because I'm feeding little mouths. Very good. This one's a keeper. EDITED: This needs more liquid, about 1/2 c. or so. Otherwise, it dosen't cook all the way. I did have to nuke it for a couple minutes to finish cooking it.

This is THE best recipe I have ever found for Spanish Rice.  The only thing I changed is that I didn't actually add the bacon at the end--I just let the drippings flavor the rice.  YUMMM!

OMGosh, I love this rice recipe! I also didn't have any jalapeno peppers (or chili powder) so I took the feedback of another reviewer and added a half a package of taco seasoning mix.    Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It's going to be used and loved at least once a week around here. ;)

I'm sure it was good as written, but knowing my family's tastes I made adjustments. I added 1/4 tsp each of cumin, black pepper and saffron, and 1 tbl minced garlic, used canned tomatoes and sliced jalapenos, added one beef bouillion cube, and 2 small bay leaves. It was great. I couldn't give it 5 stars because it needed help even as written, but was a good enough starter recipe. With a few adjustments, it turned out fantastic, definitely rating a good solid 4.

Simply delicious! The whole kitchen smelled wonderful while this was cooking. I used a half pack of bacon, cut into pieces with kitchen scissors for ease of eating. My son is just under 2 years old. I also left the bacon and drippings in the pan when I added the veggies and mushrooms. I used brown rice since that's all I had on hand, and canned tomatoes, 4 of them chopped with a spoon, left over from a previous recipe. Seasoned with my favourite non-salt-seasoning, Herbamour by Knorr, and voila! Delicious. I will definitely make this dish again.

I submited this several years ago to taste of home quick cooking magazine.They changed it to be healthier.I used just the bacon grease less water and more tomatos. It was usually made in the summer and we used all garden fresh veggies :) and tons more peppers I prefer the small cayenne peppers and several more of them.I am so glad everyone liked it It was too good to keep to myself. I do love garlic but have never tried it in this...Thanks for the nice comments.David

This recipe is excellent, the bacon adds a lot of flavor.  I used a can of diced tomatoes and it was delicious.

I followed the recipe and my rice was crunchy, even after additional liquid and cooking.  Maybe I browned it too long?  The flavor seemed to be good, but not the rice itself.  I have cooked it even longer and refrigerated, so I am going to try it again.  It had too many good ingredients to throw away without an effort to save it.

This was bland.  The bacon didn't do much for it.  I added some sour cream and salt to my serving and then it tasted very good.
