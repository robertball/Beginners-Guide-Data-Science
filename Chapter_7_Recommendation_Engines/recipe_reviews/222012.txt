Hubby's coworkers love it. Also, when people ask, "What is in it ?" or "what are these green slivers?" I answer "mild hot peppers". My experience in making several times is that "The less they know the better, they eat it, and they love it". If you actually say, "cactus", most often they snub their nose. People don't like to think outside of the box or even close....eat up...yum yum.

This recipe was a big hit on my Super Bowl table. People came back for 2nds and 3rds. I had to hunt all over for the cactus but it was so worth the effort.

It was good except was very salty. I would perhaps try it again if I can find low sodium ingedients. Maybe use my own chili powder and cumin instead of the packaged taco mix to reduce the salt.
The nopalitos were a pleasant surprise, with a mild flavor. I just let people think that the nopalito pieces were peppers instead of telling them that they are cactus.
