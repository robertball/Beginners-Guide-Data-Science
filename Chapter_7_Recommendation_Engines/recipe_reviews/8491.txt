Absolutely love this version!  I did however take the advice of one comment that suggested I scale the recipe to 36 servings for a 9x13 pan and it was a perfect measure.  On making this a second time I made 2 changes: First I swapped 1/2 the white sugar for packed brown sugar and instead of allspice I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Both ways are great, the moistest recipe I've ever made!

This seems a bit too greasy.  I still gave 5 stars because this is the best banana cake I have ever made.  I made a banana cake using recipe from this site that called for sour milk and wish I could go back and change that rating to maybe a 4 because the flavor and texture of this cake is excellent, much better.  I will make this again with margarine instead of butter or less butter.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  Try the Butter Cream Frosting II submitted by Kris, also a keeper.

Super!  Turned out much better than others I have tried.  I used a 9x9 pan.  It was great with a simple cream cheese frosting.

The absolute best banana cake recipe I've ever tried! This is now The One Cake I make consistently and is the most requested by family and friends. It never fails to get rave reviews, and it's so simple to make. I have adjusted the serving size up to 48 and baked it in two 8" round pans, a 9" pan, and some individual silicone baking cups for the leftovers. I've also baked it into a 9x13 pan as well. No matter what size you do, it'll always come out right. Usually I follow the recipe exactly, but I've also sub'd Greek yogurt for some of the butter, did 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar, doubled the allspice, and added nuts. Frosting it with cream cheese frosting spiked with Nutella will make your toes curl and just drizzling it with some Greek yogurt mixed with honey and vanilla (instead of an all-out frosting job) before serving will get you marriage proposals! You just can't screw this one up!

I have never made a banana cake before, and I usually don't like bananas.  This case was AWESOME.  I looked at the other comments and scaled the recipe to 36 servings for a 9 x 11 pan, and the amount of cake was just right.  I also halved the sugar, halved the amount of butter and replaced it with canola oil, and replaced the eggs with two egg whites per whole egg.  My family's not into sweet desserts, and even with the cut sugar, we found that it was still too sweet for our tastes.  The moisture was perfect, though, and I would definitely make this again.

I made this for my husbands birthday and everyone liked it.  My only complaint was that it didn't raise very much.  I added a 1/4 cup of finely chopped nuts into the batter before I poured it.  I used 2-8 inch round pans and used banana cream pudding between the layers and frosted it with cool whip.  HINT:  Use 1/2 a package of instant pudding(I used banana) pour it in cool whip container and mix very well.  Makes a GREAT topping for any cake.  I also sprinkled cake with finely chopped walnuts.

Excellent cake! It's a bit sweet, so I would cut definitely cut down on the sugar by about 1/3 cup- especially if I'm adding icing.  I also added an extra 1/2 tsp. baking powder. It doesn't rise very much, but the texture is lovely. It's yummy! :-9

This is the tastiest banana cake I've ever eaten! It's incredibly moist with great banana flavor. I used 1/4 cup canola oil instead of butter and rice milk instead of regular milk, and it came out great! It not at all like banana bread, it's much lighter. It's not fluffy, but it's very light and moist. Will definately make again.

I LOVE this cake!  It's so moist and just delicious!  I added some crushed walnuts to the batter, frosted it with Pillsbury Cream Cheese and topped it with remaining sifted walnut 'powder'.   This is a really yummy cake and very simple to make.  The batter tasted so good, and it smelled great while baking!   
Everything's an A++   Thank you Lyle!!

WOW. This was sooooo moist and delicious! I took it to a church potluck and it disappeared. My daughter and I shared a piece and I am so glad we got one in time! The only changes I made were to follow other reviewers' suggestions to cut the sugar, and I did scale it to 36 for a 13x9 (perfect!), and swapped half the allspice for nutmeg and added another 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  I made a peanut butter frosting (8oz creamcheese, 1/2c peanut butter, 1/2c litecorn syrup, little powdered sugar) and it was sublime. I definitely will make again and again when I have browning bananas! TIP: If you don't have enough at one time for a recipe, put them in a freezer bag and save them til you do--they defrost super fast and are more than ready to mash perfectly.

This was an excellent, moist & flavorful cake.  Besides adding walnuts, a dash of cinnamon it was perfect.  The cream cheese frosting is and added bonus to an already wonderful cake.  It is true that it doesn't raise much so you may want to increase the recipe size if making a layer cake.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could... My family loved this cake, but I thought it was a bit bland and bread like (after I refrigerated it) I may have used too many bananas, so I'll give it 5 stars instead. Definitely something to try out.

I followed this recipe to a "t", making no substitutions whatsoever.  I made two 8" round layers as I did not have the 9" pans.  Presumably this would result in a higher, more risen cake....but noooo.  This cake hardly rises at all, as a few other reviewers have said, therefore the 3 star rating from me.  Everything else is like a regular banana cake, nothing too special.  Very sweet.  Chocolate icing was a nice compliment.

I was looking for a good banana cake recipe to use up a bunch of overripe bananas I had sitting on the counter, so I decided to give this a try. I altered it a bit by using 1/2 a cup of white sugar and 1/2 a cup of packed brown sugar, and instead of dividing it into two 9-inch pans, I just used one and cooked it a bit longer. Then, topped it off with a simple buttercream frosting I whipped up on a whim. Turned out fantastic! It tastes pretty much like a less dense banana bread. Will definitely be making this again.

This is the best cake EVER! I wasted so much time on other online recipes, this was by far the best!

I substituted a few things....used Splenda instead of sugar, Soy Milk instead of whole milk, and crisco (butter flavor) instead of butter. 

For the frosting I mixed, one box of vanilla sugar free pudding, enough soy milk for the consistancy I wanted, one teaspoon of vanilla and folded in sugar free cool whip. I also added some coconut per my husbands request. Iced the cake and put in fridge to set. Served Chilled, SO YUMMY!

I've been looking for a recipe for banana cake with cream cheese frosting that my parents made when I was a kid, so I picked this one because it was described as being "sponge-like".  I made it tonight, and even though it was really good, it's still not the one I'm looking for.  I followed the recipe except I used cake flour instead of all-purpose, and like a few other reviewers said, it came out short and a little dense.  Also, it was very sweet.  Definitely cut back on the sugar if you don't like really sweet things.  I made it in a 9"x13" pan and frosted it with a cream cheese frosting recipe I found on this site (which was very good)!  This is a very good cake, though, but I'll keep searching for that light and fluffy cake recipe I remember as a kid.

I would rate this 4 1/2 stars but I am sure once I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup or maybe even 1/2 cup it will be a 5 star recipe.  I made it in the two 9 inch pans and as many mentioned, it does not rise very much.  I cut each 9 inch cake in two (horizontally) and whipped up 2 cups of whipping cream with a splash of vanilla to top each layer and spread over the top of cake.  It was absolutely delicious.  I served it with fresh strawberries, raspberries and blueberries and it was a big hit.

Great recipe. Made this for a small dinner get-together & they loved it. Personally, I found it a bit too sweet so I'd cut down on sugar when making this for myself only, since everyone else loved the sweetness as it was. So its just a matter of personal taste on sweetness. The texture and flavor of this was very good. Used mini loaf pans and they came out great. Would definitely make this again.

This came out sooo well! I followed directions exactly except I added some chopped walnuts.  Everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe! I didnt add frosting because I didnt think it was needed. I let the bananas sit for 2 weeks so they were very ripe! Thanks for sharing, I love that it is simple and requires limited ingredients.

This cake was moist and delicious.  Not everyone here likes cream cheese frosting, so I used Butter Cream Frosting II (fabulous)  submitted by Kris.  I also used two separate pans, and mixed walnuts into the batter for one.  Everyone (except for one who doesn't like banana's :o) )  loved it!  I will make this again!

Recipe was easy to make and turned out excellent. The texture was perfect. I opted to used a bit less sugar but added 1 C. chopped walnuts and 3/4 C.chopped choc. chips. No icing needed. I think a light dusting of powdered sugar would be perfect. Thank you!

This was a really good banana cake which my family loved. I did not have allspice, so I made a mix of nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and coriander, enough to equal 1/4 tsp. I also had only two ripe bananas, which came to a bit less than 1 and 1/2 cups, so I added applesauce to make up for the missing 1/4 cup of mashed bananas. These changes are minor, so I imagine I'd be equally pleased if I followed the recipe to the letter. Thanks for a good, easy recipe!

this is a very good recipe. Very easy to make and I have great success with it every time I have used it. Try topping it off with a peanut butter icing for extra flavour.

This is a great cake.  I have made 2 of them in the last couple days.  Since I was taking the second to a potluck I doubled the recipe and made 3 layers instead of two.  I frosted it using a cream cheese frosting recipe which I added one ripe banana to.  All I brought home was an empty plate.

This is a great recipe. First I tried it in a 9 inch pan. It tasted great but it did not raise much. Second time I changed the serving size to 36 and baked it in a 9X13 inch pan.I also added a little extra baking power and replaced the sugar with 1/2 brown sugar and also added a handful of blueberries into the batter. It turned out great. Its a keeper. Thank you Lyle.

This recipe was such a disappointment! It.didn't rise and it tasted too sweet with the frosting. Even my son said it was just ok. I wont make it again -I have a recipe that I've been making for years but I wanted to try something new.

Delicious! I baked in a 9 x 13 pan and sprinkled powdered sugar on top. Tasted like banana nut bread, but without the nuts. I would definitely make again!

This tastes exactly like the delicious banana spice cakes I remember having as a child in the midwest at potlucks and get-togethers. It is absolutely fantastic. I made mine in a 9x13 pan without changing anything and it turned out perfect. I did grease and flour the bottom of the cake pan, although I noticed the recipe doesn't call for it, because I didn't want the cake to stick. I will definitely make ths again.

I was skeptical of this recipe because every banana cake I've tried turns out like more of a bread than a cake.  I was pleasantly surprised how this turned out....and believe it or not....I didn't change a thing. Ingredients and prep was simple. Topped with cream cheese frosting (homemade, of course) and it was delicious!!

I made this exactly like the recipe except I might have used more than 1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas...I mashed up 4 aged bananas.  I made cupcakes and they are outstanding.  Moist, fluffy, delicious.  They only needed to bake about 17-18 minutes.  I like another banana cake recipe, but I didn't have vinegar for sour milk and I didn't have sour cream for another recipe.  I found this one and I am so glad I did.

It was awesome! Made some changes though.. Modified recipe to 36 servings, used margarine, added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of all spice and I halved the sugar..then used half brown and half white. The brown sugar gives off a lovely smell when baking! Very moist and tastes great. Slightly too greasy. 
Sugar definitely needs to be halved, or 1/3 less. Next time, I will try reducing the margarine slightly too.

What a good cake!  I made a few small changes.  I added a little less sugar and added 1/4 t. each of cinnamon and cardamon. Although this time we enjoyed it without icing, next time I think I'll serve it with slightly sweetened whipped cream sprinkled with blueberries.  I think that would be delicious.

Great way to use brown bananas.  I used 1/8 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. cloves in place of the allspice, and it turned out yummy.

I was a bit short on some ingridents, but it still turned out great.  I used 100gms of butter, I left out the egg white and just stuck to 2 eggs. I only had 2 bananas so just made do.  I only had baking powder so used 2 teaspoons and used mixed spice. It turned out very light and fluffy. Will probably just add another banana next time.  I also just used a loaf pan to cook, about 40 minutes.  Just use a skewer to check until it comes out clean.

I made this in an 8" springform pan. I only have one so did it in two batches.  I'm glad I used an 8" instead of 9" as the recipe states as each layer was pretty thin.  I used the Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting on this site.  Yummy but very sweet. It'd be great as an afternoon tea cake with fresh fruit, but it's too sweet with ice cream.  It'd be really yummy with a dark chocolate frosting instead of cream cheese I think, and added nuts or cinnamon would be good too.

Very nice recipe!! Very moist and spongy... I added a bit of cinnamon and cardamom cause I did not have the all spice... also a bit more of milk... but so far is the best banana cake that I have eaten. Thanks.

My Aunt doesn't like banana bread. She *loved* this cake. It's one of the fasted from scratch cakes that I've made. When I make it I don't even bother with frosting the cake is so good all by itself.

I used a 9x13 pan and baked for 30 min.  Came out great.  Denser and more moist than banana bread. ... Update: I've made this several more times and it always turns out great and people love it.  I've also tried adding chocolate chips or butterscotch chips - both are great, but I cut back on the sugar a bit if adding these or it ends up too sweet (especially with butterscotch chips).

This was my first time trying a banana cake and I was very pleased with the results.  It was fairly quick, easy to follow and tasted delicious.  After checking out many other banana cake recipes, I chose this one because I did'nt have any buttermilk on hand, that a lot of the other recipes required.  Overall this recipe is a good one and will become one of my regulars.

Very good recipe !  Only changes I made were to  use spiced rum in place of milk,  mixed 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice in place of  allspice.   Sprinkling chopped nuts over the top before baking gave this a pretty presentation in a loaf pan lined with parchment paper.

Very  soft and moist cake. I had almost 2 cups of mashed banana. So I decided to just up the amount of banana. It was great! We ate it without the frosting and it was wonderful. I will definately be making this again.

I've been making the same banana bread for years.  This recipe surpassed mine by miles. I might play around with different spices next time.  Excellent!

I made this a few moments ago. It did not rise as high as I thought it would and yes it is dense. I added chocolate chips along with the banana. It is tasty but I was expecting it to rise more and be more of a standard yellow cake. I will keep looking for a better recipe. By the way, I only filled one 9 inch pan.

Easy and excellent flavor. Wish the recipe made more batter, though.  Makes a rather shallow cake. But the wonderful taste and texture overcame a potential 4 star rating.

My family likes this recipe. It is nice and fluffy. I use No Cook frosting with it, like a meringue fluffy topping and it tastes like a good banana flip! The last time I made this cake, it did turn out dry, so I'm not sure what I did wrong.

I thought the recipe was great.  I made it exactly as written.  I found it easy to prepare and it came out very moist and tasty.  I made cupcakes out of the batter and they took about 18 minutes to bake.  I got 21 regular sized cupcakes out of the recipe.  I made them into banana split cupcakes by filling them with strawberry preserves and frosted them with pineapple cream cheese frosting and drizzled with hot fudge and topped with a maraschino cherry.

Loved this recipe! Made quite a few different banana cakes, this is way up there. Made mine as cupcakes, and iced with lemon buttercream. Followed advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 tsp baking powder, and swapped 1/3C white sugars for brown, doing only 3/4C sugar total. Yum!

Best banana cake I've ever made. I made in a glass 8x10" pan and used NO frosting.  My boys hate cream cheese :(  But the cake didn't last 24 hours.  They ate for dessert last night and finished it for breakfast this morning!  I ADDED CHOPPED PECANS. yum! this is easier and faster than banana bread and much moister!!! (the cake didn't last long enough for me to get the photo!)

This cake was excellent. We upped the servings to 36 and baked it in a 13x9 pan as mentioned in another review, which worked out perfectly. Then we cut out a banana shape and decorated with chocolate buttercream icing and chocolate chips for my boyfriend's niece's 4th birthday party. The cake tasted delicious and was even borderline nutritious! A note of caution, however: this cake is more akin to banana bread in cake form than banana flavored cake. It's a bit denser than a normal cake, but I think that is better for a banana cake :) Because it's a little less sweet, the leftover scraps made a great breakfast :) Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Finally a wonderful tasting banana cake using ingredients that I always have on hand.  I didn't alter the recipe except for adding a few chopped pecans. So simple and quick to make.  Thanks for a true winner.

I've made this cake twice now and both times I received rave reviews. Even family members that generally dislike cake were taking seconds. It is absolutely delicious and extremely moist. For frosting I made a banana butter cream (1 stick butter, 1 mashed potato, 3 cups powdered sugar, 1 T vanilla) and it was the perfect complement

This came out beautifully!  I separated all of the eggs and whipped the whites separately and then folded them in at the end.  My cakes rose perfectly and were nice and light.  I used the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site, put some mini chocolate chips in the frosting between the layers, and caked the sides of the frosted cake with walnut bits.  Thanks for a great recipe!

DE-LI-CIOUS!!! So much banana flavor and very moist. I also split the spices portion with 1/2 cinammon, 1/2 all spice. I also added about 1/2 Cup of Chocolate Chips because Banana and chocolate go PERFECT together. Used a delicious, but basic cream cheese frosting and encrusted the outer edege of the layer cake with crushed walnuts. Then a light sprinkle of coconut on top! This cake was gorgeous and tasted like the fabulous cakes you find in bakeries. I plan to make this many more times!

This recipe was moist, baked quickly and the taste was great.  I substituted veg. oil for the butter, and cut the sugar to half, like the other suggestions.  I can't wait to try it in muffin tins. It used ingredients I have on hand and mixed in a jiffy. Thanks.

This was a great recipe. I made a double batch and family and coworkers alike are gobbling it up. I topped it with powdered sugar because I thought it was sweet enough without frosting. I also substituted a cinnamon blend for the allspice.
