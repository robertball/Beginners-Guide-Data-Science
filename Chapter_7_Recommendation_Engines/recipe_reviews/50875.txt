Bland, but much better with extra salt, pepper & garlic powder added to flour mixture.  I had extra zucchini so "french fried" it as well; it turned out FAR SUPERIOR to the eggplant.  The zuccini was a HIT WITH OUR 5 YEAR OLD!

Pretty messy to make, tasted pretty good but bland and not worth all the effort in my opinion.  Maybe would be better with some spices added to the cornmeal/flour coating.

This tasted good using StoveTop cornbread stuffing (processed finely) instead of the flour mixture, and had a lot of flavor. I cut them in 1/2 inch thick circles instead of julienne-style, and used mayo for dipping. Even my 12-year-old and 3-year-old liked them.

With ranch, these were okay.  They're bland otherwise.  They were incredibly messy to make.  Maybe a deep fryer would work better.

I'm not an expert cook by any means, but the breading was somewhat bland and the oil combination caused a ton of smoke in my house. The eggplant tasted ok after we added an excess amount of cayenne and salt and pepper..

I agree they were bland. We added lots of extra cayenne, some adobo and allspice and they tasted a little better. The eggplant underneath the batter was good. They definitely need some kind of complimentary dipping sauce.

These were okay. I wouldn't go out to buy another eggplant just to make them, but if I got another eggplant in my bountiful baskets, I would make them again. I added garlic powder and onion powder to the flour/cornmeal mix.

Fantastic and easy to prepare. Use a deep fryer.  Add additional spices to the flour mixture to your taste. I lightly salted the eggplant and left the pieces in a bowl for about 1 hr. prior to frying and I only dipped once in the egg and flour mixture. My kids loved them with ketchup.

I used breadcrumbs since I didn't have cornmeal and added spices after reading the other reviews (basil, oregano).  They were good (like all fried food is!) but a lot of work.  I'd recommend using a deep fryer.

Little one ate 'em up, although I found them a little bland.  Didn't use enough salt/pepper.  Could probably use "something else" (like seasoned breadcrumbs or something else - as others have said).  Pretty easy and quick to make.

I made this and it was a hit!! the spices I used and generous portions at that- turmeric, paprika, garlic salt, onion salt, cayenne, salt and pepper. Also I used polenta instead of corn meal because it was what I had available and it was mighty crunchy. Coconut oil is the oil to fry in most definitely!! this tasty bites only take a little bit of time which was perfect. I used a delicious dipping sauce which consisted of yogurt, cayenne, turmeric, paprika, and minced garlic. That really made the meal complete. so  good. it needs the dip though.

It was pretty bland. next time i'll use more spice. It was also super thick with the double batter...i would only do it once next time..and water down the egg mix.

Seriously bland. Far too much flour. Far too little actual spice. A pinch of cayenne against two cups of flour was meaningless. After my test batch I added 1/2 cup of hot curry, a tablespoon of paprika, and a tablespoon of tumeric. That made it rather tasty but is obviously nothing like the original recipe.

The process of making these were a bit annoying. I only dipped them once because doing that a second time was time consuming. I did put spices in the flour, and I seasoned the eggplants before hand. Lastly after dipping them into the flour I rolled them in some Italian Breadcrumbs, and they turned out really good.

I didn't have corn meal, so I tried using breadcrumbs instead.  I replaced the veggie oil with coconut oil - was very good!  Had some that were in veggie oil and they were more soggy and just tasted more oily.  I'd recommend coconut oil.

I tried these and must say that we all loved them. I don't like any vegetables and have been trying to try new things this summer. I had never liked eggplant and my husband and daughter had never tried eggplant. Will definitely make these again.

I made this recipe just the way it was,with the exact ingredients called for.  I thought this was an excellent recipe,so did my better half. We did use a dip-Ranch and it made the fries even more delish.Loved this!
