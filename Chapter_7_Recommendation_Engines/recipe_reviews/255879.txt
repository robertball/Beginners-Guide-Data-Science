This recipe is a keeper only because it's basic. I followed the recipe to a T (except I used coconut oil instead of canola), and they were incredibly bland. I whipped up a cream cheese frosting to make them edible (they were that bland). In the future I'd add fruit or chocolate chips or peanut butter etc.

I made this recipe exactly but substituted almond milk. The muffin its self turned out wonderful. Not getting a dry texture like other reviews said.  This recipe is an excellent base for making oatmeal muffins but just understand that one its own there is not much flavouring here. I added chopped apples and cinnamon and they turned out great. Will make again.

Made these for my husband's lunch box.  They were a bit messy to take to work but fine for home.    Tasty and loved the streusel.

I made this muffin step by step and they tasted like nothing... Almost a bread. The only thing that was sweet tasting was the top part

This is the second time I've made this recipe. First time I added raisins, walnuts and cinnamon. Good but a bit dry and bland. Second time I tried carrot, dates, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves and still bland. I just realized there is no salt in the batter. I think that is the problem and I'll try again adding salt next time!

These muffins were very dry.  The second time I made them I even added extra oil to no effect.  Even baked them a couple minutes less.

These were very easy to make. I followed the recipe as is the first time but found them a bit bland. Because we use unsalted butter, the second time around, I added a pinch of salt to the  streusel and about 1/2 tsp to the muffins along with some cinnamon and nutmeg.
