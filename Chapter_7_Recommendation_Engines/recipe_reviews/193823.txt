Love it, love it. I did halve the recipe and only used just over 1/4 packet of dressing mix. It was just the right amount of Ranch flavor, so next time I will do the same. Served it as a dip last night, but will definitely make again to use as a condiment for tacos, burritos, etc. My husband is a bit leery of avocado anything, but he really liked this. Thank you! :)

this is so simple to make,economical but basically is rach dip with a couple of avocados mashed. It needed 'something'.  I added a sprinkle of smoked paprika and that improved the flavor.  maybe a sprinkling of some Tex-Mex seasoning may be in order if one finds it too bland.

I made this for a Halloween dip as a substitute to go with another recipe on this site and it was really yummy! I messed up and got this recipe and another that I was considering mixed up and added taco seasoning, but it turned out really good. I served with tortilla chips and beans and salsa. Next time I'll leave out the taco! My mistake!

I cut this recipe in half BUT I did not change the amount of green onions. I used my own homemade dry ranch dressing mix. Quite good--the longer it sits the better it gets. I ate this with sliced cucumbers and carrot chips. I'll make this again, this will be good for family gatherings/girls night in.

Great Flavor. I'm surprised at how much dip you get out of even just 1 avocado. Very good stuff.

This was too salty and Ranch-y for us as written. I ended up adding another avocado to it and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!We like it a little spicier so I used a bit more cayenne pepper and I got the regular sour cream (oops) and this was fabulous as a dip and also to put on top of our tacos!

This is great!  I made half a batch and it could probabl use more ranch dressing than what I added!
