Okay,for starters,I used a can of spinach and drained it VERY well...I also used a clove of fresh minced garlic,omitted the dried onion and used the fresh minced onion.Also used in place of garlic powder,garlic salt! It didn't taste fabulous,so I added fresh grated parmesan cheese for creaminess,YUM! Just the way I like it,with a great deal of modifications!

The garlic and onion flavors just didn't mesh well with the taste of spinach.

I thought this was really good...I followed the directions exactly because I wanted to be able to keep the spinach dish low-fat. The only change I will make next time is to add a dash of nutmeg, a pinch of salt, and to bake it instead of cooking it on the stovetop. My three year old also seemed to really like it.

I used this recipe because it had the texture I wanted, and I was hoping the evaporated milk would be creamy.  I really like the method of using the blender, but was disappointed with the flavor as written.  I ended up adding about 4 ozs of cream cheese, salt and pepper, and am happy with the final results.

This recipe is good.  I am trying to match it to a side dish I had at a resteraunt in San Francisco and this is the closest yet!

A little watery, but a good way to eat spinach.

I can't say I really enjoyed the taste of the spinach as a stand-alone, but when eaten with something else it tasted pretty good.

I loved this recipe, with a few alterations. I put 1tbsp of light cream cheese in mine. Other than that, I made it as it was written. However, in the future, I will leave out a great deal of the 1/2 cup minced onions.

This was an awesome, easy recipe. I used canned spinach and added just a touch of buttermilk and some fresh garlic. It was great. Thank you!

Overall the recipe is fair. I added sour cream and Parm. Cheese to the recipe which helped with the flavor. I also did not use the minced onion I just added more fresh onion.

This is a winner. I did not bother with a blender or food processor. Just mixed it all well. Easy peasy

I'll have to say I did not know if I would like this. I've always thought of cream spinach as something old people eat. I did not have evaporated milk and I did not have frozen spinach, however, I had fresh spinach and  decided to use half-and-half. I did not blend it up. Other than these small changes I followed the recipe and I actually enjoyed it!
