Used this recipe for bagged cookie frosting at Christmas time.  Just using ziplock bags to pipe. I used flavor (almond & peppermint in diff. batches).  I did use extra water & a little less meringue because I didnâ€™t want it to set up too quickly & I needed a recipe that did not require corn syrup since I was out. It worked perfectly.  Will use it again.
