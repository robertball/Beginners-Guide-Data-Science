This was easy and very tasty but I think the "wild rice" ingrediant needs to be clarified. Real wild rice takes at least 50-60 minutes to cook so this recipe needs a variation/rice mix like; Uncle Ben's Long Grain AND Wild Rice. This way you can keep the simmering to 30 minutes. I recommend not using any flavoring packets and using low-sodium Cream of Mushroom soup. I used 2 cups chicken broth and later added another half cube while simmering (in lieu of flavor packet). It was delicious. Thanks.

This far exceeded my expectations. I just wanted something different without making a trip to the store and this recipe came up in my search. I put it together and after a while my house started smellin all good...this totally delivered great flavor without being too spicy for the little ones. This is definitely gonna become part of our dinner rotation.

This is very delicious and super easy! I made this for a potluck and it was a hit! I used Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice and still used the flavor packets. I also used some cayenne pepper to give it some kick but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee and did it all in my rice cooker! Just threw it all in there, hit the button and came out PERFECT! Yum!!

Nice change of pace! I went out on a limb and made a few changes. I knew there would be a lot of flavor from the sausage so I figured dinner would turn out regardless. Another reviewer made the point that actual wild rice takes about an hour to cook so I started the wild rice (and chicken broth) in the rice cooker earlier than the rest of the meal. I added a cup of extra water and let it keep cooking longer than usual. I didn't have enough chicken broth and I think it showed through in the end result. That mistake I won't make again. In one skillet I cooked up finely diced chicken, Maui onion and minced garlic with a tablespoon of olive oil. When that was partially cooked I added a cup of broccoli cut into smaller pieces than normal. In the other skillet I let the andouille sausage crisp up some. I omitted the mushrooms and mushroom soup because we don't care for mushrooms but I think they would have gone well in this dish. Also, I was in the mood for something lighter than the cream soup would make. I added the rice to the chicken mixture with some reconstituted chicken bouillon to help it break up some. When that was a nice fluffy consistency again I added the rice and chicken into the sausage pan and mixed it up will. It turned out delicious with great color, flavor and presentation!

This is so very good. I made a homemade cream of mushroom soup instead of canned and used beef sausage because my guest does not eat pork. Fantastic.

It couldnt taste much better. Great for healthy eating. I used some moose sausage rather than the requested sausage and it was really good.

I am giving this 4 stars because my kids and husband really liked it. However, it was just way too salty for me between the soup and the sausage. Had a good base to build on, tho. Thanks for the recipe.

Good rice dish. If it had a little more kick to it I would be five stars. I didn't add the sausage, only because I made chicken breast stuff with sausage. But next time I'll add the sausage and maybe some cayenne pepper.

Was looking for something to go with some smoked brisket and came upon this recipe.  Loved it!  It will be in the rotation to make often.

Very simple and delicious. I really enjoyed it. The wild rice gave it a really satisfying chew.  Next times I might try cheese or throwing in a chopped red pepper. White pepper might be good, too. Thanks!

i used this recipe as a base for making one of bf's lunches.. i fried up a 7 oz kielbasa sausage,  the onion (red) and mushrooms (baby bellas) in some bacon fat.. then added about 2 1/2 cups leftover cooked white rice, the mushroom soup, and 1/2 cup of water.. i subbed 1/2 tsp of garlic powder for the fresh and added about 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning.. i also liberally sprinkled black pepper and paprika into the dish.. i'm sure some bell pepper would make this pop but i was short on time.. ty for the inspiration

Super yummy and hearty meal, and so easy to make! I was looking for a great recipe for wild rice and found it. This dish was a meal on it's own, and since had a good amount of protein, veggies, and good carbs, it's ideal as a South Beach diet phase 2 meal. I ended up not adding the cream of mushroom soup at the end-- when everything was done cooking, it already tasted so good that I didn't want to change it-- maybe next time I will try adding it. It was easy to double the recipe, and I added some Thai chili sauce in the beginning for an added kick. Looking forward to making this again-- Thanks!

Used 14 oz andouille, added some cayenne, way more onion and way more mushrooms. Otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out good! Will make again but with more veggies.

I added a total of 13oz andouille sausage, green peppers, onion, celery and cream of chicken soup. No mushrooms or cream of mushroom soup. I simmered it for about 50 minutes and it turned out delicious!

This was pretty good!  I didn't use the sausage but even still, I found it pretty salty. If I make this again I'll probably add more mushrooms, and if I use the sausage I would probably use low sodium cream of mushroom. 
   This would be great bed to serve meat over!

I guess I'm just not a fan of canned soups. I thought this recipe was great- without the soup. I added a jalapeño for heat and extra garlic. I would eat this without the soup again.

Awesome taste.  I used real wild rice so 30 min was not nearly enough time to cook.  It was closer to an hour.  I added 14 oz. or regular sausage, more onion and mushroom.  My kids loved it and we did not have leftovers which meant it was a hit!

This turned out better than I expected!  I used Uncle Bens based on other reviews, just one box with half of the seasoning package. I added black beans at end and skipped the soup. Oh, and I added Cajun seasoning. Excellent!

wild rice is expensive.  cook it on its own first as it takes twice as long to cook as written in this recipe.

I had a box of wild rice someone gave me and needed a "one time recipe".  Well, this recipe is a keeper that I will make again.  I used chorizo sausage, jalepeno chicken sausage and cajun seasoning.  And, like another reviewer, I decided it was just perfect without adding the mushroom soup.  Thanks Josh for a terrific recipe!

Made this last night. Turned out great!  You could use any type sausage.  I used  Aidells chicken/habanero I had gotten at Costco.  Also added a can of Cuban black beans.  Great recipe to play with and add whatever you have.  I did add the soup, but if you don't, it still is very good.
