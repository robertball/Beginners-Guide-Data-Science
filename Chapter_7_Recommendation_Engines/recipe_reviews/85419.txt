These tasted good and were liked by the family but they were difficult in the pan.  I make plain crepes VERY OFTEN and they are easy to flip and slide out of the pan...not so with these.  Since the family liked them and wanted them again I used my plain crepe recipe and added a bit more milk and cocoa powder to that one and they were much nicer.

I had some friends over for impromptu coffee, so based on what I had in the cabinet I made these crepes.  Everyone really enjoyed them.  They were quick and easy, and best warm.

They tasted great, but they were really hard to manage. They crepes were thin and hard to spread, and the chocolate had to be done at a low heat and put on the crepe right away. Be ready for a challenge on this dish.

I made the recipe as stated but substituted Dark Creme de Cocoa liquor for the hazelnut.  They came out perfectly.  I filled my crepes with Mascarpone and sour cream filling, topping them with Bananas Foster II recipe found on AR here.  Add a touch of chocolate sauce and whipped cream and you have a gourmet dessert fit for anyone. :)

I just made the crepe portion (not the sauce) of this recipe and it was great! The only substitutes I made was I used half coconut milk and half half and half (that's a lot of halves!) since I didn't have milk and I omitted the liquor since I didn't have that. I was worried this might change the texture of the batter. No issues with the batter and the crepes were the perfect texture and flipped easily! They weren't quite as "chocolatey" as is hoped, so next time I'll definitely use a chocolate liquor. I filled these with Greek yogurt and raspberries and gobbled them all up myself!! Just remember this recipe only makes 3-4 medium sized crepes, so you'll need to expand the recipe as needed.
