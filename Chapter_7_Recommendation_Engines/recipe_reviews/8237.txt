Interesting cake, but not outstanding.  It does resemble a Twinkie.  I made it for a get-together and was disappointed that no one made any favorable comments about it nor requested the recipe.  Will not make it again.

I made this cake for our cook-out over the Memorial weekend.  I followed the suggestion to make it a day ahead.  It was FANTASTIC!!!!  All of my guests couldn't wait to try it and all agreed it tasted like a Twinkie, but even better.  I used a Duncan Hines yellow cake mix.  I think Duncan Hines are the best cake mixes.  The filling was fabulous and went together easily although you need to be prepared to beat it for several minutes. I agree it needed to be a tad sweeter and I ended up adding maybe 3 or 4 tablespoons of sugar. I made it Saturday afternoon and we ate it Sunday afternoon.  I saved back a piece for myself and ate it Monday night.  It was even better then.  The second time I made this cake, I did it for church treats.  I baked the cake mix in two cookie sheets.  It was very thin.  I doubled the filling and topped one cake with the other.  They looked exactly like Little Debbie Banana Twins after I cut them.  The entire church went crazy over the cake.  One Lady said she had never had wedding cake that tasted as good. I will make this cake again and again and again.......Thank you Carol!

I had to add more butter and sugar to the filling to make it taste right, but I think my shortening may have been a little old and was distorting the taste. Once I got the filling to taste right, it was really good. I used dental floss to cut through the middle of the cake, and it worked like a charm! Definately make this a day ahead. The longer it sat the more it tasted like a Twinkie. We ate a little each day for five days, and it tasted good up until the last day!

I too have had this same recipe for years.  When I slice the cake in two, I cut the cake in half first.  That way you can remove the top from each side easier.  I also make sure I have enough left to frost the top with it too.  This is THE favorite birthday cake with my grandchildren.

good- yum, yum
fyi- a cake cutter can be purchased at a craft store for about $3. this will make spliting cakes lenghtwise sooo extremely effortless-reminds you of a cheese slicer just a bunch bigger :)

This is awesome!  The only change I made was I added 1/4 cup sugar to make the filling slightly sweeter.  I used devil's food cake and made Suzy Q's and it tasted just like the real ones only better.  For a variation, I divided the yellow cake (I used the butter recipe cake mix) and added 2 teas. banana extract to the cake mix and 2 teas. to the filling and made Banana Flips.  It was incredible!  Will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks, Carol!

While it's not really the flavor of a Twinkie, this stuff is TOO GOOD.  Be sure to follow the "curing process" of letting the cake sit in the refrigerator and then for a day or so out of the 'fridge.  I tried the cake as soon as I filled it and topped -- it was o.k. -- two days later, it was GREAT!

This cake was quite a hit at my office. I made it for our August birthday celebration and now I have been requested to make it again for the Sept party.  I used about a 1/4 cup more sugar in the filling (I recommend tasting as you go).  I wrapped it in saran and refrigerated it for about 36 hours. Delicious!

I made this in a Bundt pan and piped the filling into the middle with a pastry bag.  Much better than a twinkie!

Great Twinkie style Cream Filling!  Instead of cake method I made cupcakes and then piped filling inside with a pastry tip.  Grandkids loved them!!!

Made a Sponge Bob Squarepants cake using this recipe.  Everyone loved the cake's taste as much if not better than the theme of it.  SO GOOD!

here's an easy tip for filling cupcakes with creme --- use an apple corer to remove a "core" of cake from the center of the cupcake(don't push it down all the way to the bottom).  pipe creme into the empty space and then plug up the top with a "cap" of cake.  easy peasy!

This is my husband's favorite cake.  We all love it and I use it regularly to make cupcakes to take to any function.  By using chocolate cake mix, the frosting as listed and drizzling melted milk chocolate over the top, this turns into a very elegant dessert.

Like another reviewer, I also had trouble cutting, then reassembling the cake.  I think it would be much easier to use two 9inch cake pans instead.  However, I will not be trying this one again b/c my filling turned out to be lumpy and runny and I followed the instructions exactly.  As well, all of my ingredients were at room temperature so I don't know what went wrong.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed with this recipe.

I don't know-this one was really disappointing. I made for my husband and daughter, as this recipe is right up their alley. The filling tasted so greasy, it left a film in my mouth. It was really just sweetened Crisco. My family usually fights over leftovers, but this cake sat in my fridge for a week before I finally gave up and tossed it.

family loves this cake...have also increased the filling part of the recipe by 1/2 ...UPDATE:  still do the increased filling recipe, using it as frosting on top.  Recommend making it the day before, and then bringing it to almost-room-temperature before serving.

A hit at the parties.  Both kids and adults love it.  I had trouble slicing the cake lengthwise, so on my second attempt, I used to 9 inch rounds and put the filling between them.  Much easier for me!

I made the twinkie filling for a birthday party for a five year old and it was a hit!  I was asked to make several other birthday cakes.  I added a little powder sugar to the filling to make it a tad sweeter and added a little extra vanilla when I did the milk and flour base.  Once again excellent!

I was skeptical, but the cake turned out great, and without that chemical Twinkie after-taste!!  It stayed moist for days.  Carol has great recipes!

I made this for a coworker's birthday and it got rave reviews.  I use coconut oil generally in place of shortening or vegetable oil in my baking so I substituted it in the filling and the cake mix.  I also used coconut milk instead of regular milk and the filling was so yummy and creamy.  I will definitely be making this again.  Also refrigerated it for 24 hours then took it out and it was another 36 hours before we actually ate it.  So the advice in the other reviews about letting it sit a day or two was good.

This recipe is very nice, but I wouldn't say it's the "best" use for yellow cake mix.    I followed the recipe but made cupcakes instead and then filled them. They ended up tasting like gourmet Twinkies.

This cake is amazing and tastes very much like a twinkie. A twist that I found on accident was using Maple extract instead of vanilla. What you get is a "Pancake Cake" Tastes just like your morning pancakes. I also make this as cupcakes, keep all the ingredients the same just slice the cupcakes in half, spread the filling and refridgerate. Everyone loves them!

This was just okay I was expecting something great from the reviews but didn't get it. The filling was too runny from beating it that long. The cake was not easy to assemble, adn was well...a mess. I sould've refrigerated the cake and the filling for about an hour before attempting to assemble it and it would've been much easier to work with. I refrigerated the mess that I had made and then re-assembled it the next day. Wasn't pretty but tasted okay. Sort of tasted like a twinkie, but I was not impressed.

I'm only rating the filling because I made a sponge cake for this recipe. One out of six people thought this was O.K. but the rest of us didn't like it at all. For me personally, knowing that there was shortening in the filling just kind of sent me over the edge. Sorry.

I made this for my friend who is "addicted" to twinkies...he now wants the cake instead.  Grandkids want if for birthdays.  I use a "butter" recipe cake mix for a very rich cake.

My family loved it.  Other cake mix flavors can be used.  Chocolate is also good.

my kids loved it and it was super easy to put together. I did as others had suggested and left the twinkies whole. I am sure I'll make this again for the kids. (too sweet for me)

This recipe turned out to be a childhood favorite that a friend had been searching for. She was thrilled when I surprised her with it. I think it will be a childhood fave of my kids also. Everyone loved it! It disappeared in a hurry. We'll definitely make it again!

This cake really tasted like a Twinkie.  But, it is a bit of a challenge to assemble.

This cake is very delicious. I made it a day ahead as per other reviews. I used two round cake pans and sliced each round into half with the filling in between which made a four layer cake. I even had some filling left over to ice the cake a bit with it. I would make this again.

I admit, I always taste everything I make as soon as it's done to make sure it's good.  But this cake definitely is better the next day as the recipe says!  The filling is a little work to make, but turns out yummy.  (Didn't taste like a Twinkie to me, but still good.)  I even had enough to frost the top.  Cutting a 9 by 13 cake in half lengthwise is not easy!!  I think next time I will make 2 round cakes instead as previously suggested.  That will make it a lot easier!

I made this for my daughter's birthday.  Yum!  The leftover cake stayed moist and delicious for days and I didn't want to keep eating it but I couldn't help myself!  The filling was delicious even though it is extremely bad for the waistline!  It was wonderful though and tasted even better than a Twinkie!

This was ok, might make again.  It only sorta tasted like a twinkie, but it was good in its own way.  Definitely need to make it at least 24 hours ahead.

I made this as a Bundt cake. I didn't let hubby touch it for two days thanks to previous reviews. It was tough to keep him away, but well worth it. What a delicious and unusual cake! The filling does take a little effort but is well worth it.

This was one of the most popular cakes I've ever made.  My sister who is a Twinkie fanatic LOVED it!  It got her through the "Great Twinkie Famine".  I will make this cake often.
