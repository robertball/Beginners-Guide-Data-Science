It's missing something. Additional seasonings would maybe help it out. 

I followed the recipe except I added some leftover pinto beans to the rice mixture to use them up. I also only had 1 fresh tomato so I used that plus 28 oz canned whole tomatoes and did not need to add additional tomato sauce. 

Was overall pretty good and I will likely be making it again and trying to tweak the seasoning.

I loved the basil in the rice filling, and the tomato sauce was delicious...but the green peppers were still bitter.
