I've made this cheesecake twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The texture was exactly what I was hoping for and it tasted great. Unfortunately the cake developed a gigantic crack while it was cooling. I think the baking temperature was too high and it got overbaked/dry. I really loved the flavor so I made it again with a couple alterations. This time around I used only 8oz of sour cream, and added another 8oz of cream cheese. I made a cinnamon graham cracker crust for it. I also baked it at 475 F for 10 minutes, then dropped the temperature to 200 F for an hour. I let it sit in the oven for about 3 hours after it was done baking, then set it on the counter to cool completely before putting it in the fridge. I blended up some fresh strawberries, and diced a few and mixed them together to top the cake. This time it didn't crack, the cake was very soft with a fluffy texture, and it tasted amazing! Quite possibly the best cheesecake I've ever had.

This is the best recipe by far but I've added some of the tips from my own experience that worked perfectly.  I preheated at 350 degrees and then turned down to 325 to cook.  I wrapped the base of the springform pan in 3 layers of tin foil (take my advice and try not to be cheap on the foil).  I placed the pan in a roasting pan and then put about 1-1/2" of boiling water in the pan after its in the oven (easier not to spill or tip).  I then bake for approx. 1-1/2 hours at 325 degrees instead of the 350.  The center will still wiggle (area about the size of a 1/2 dollar) and then I turn off the oven and leave it in for 3 hours and I make sure once I check for it to wiggle, I don't open the oven door again for the entire 3 hours.  I take it out and leave it on the counter for another 2 hours and then put in the refridgerator overnight.  If you follow exactly the time limits, you are sure to have no cracks, no soggy crust from water seepage, and the most deliciously moist cheesecake you've ever had.  I also add 1/2 tspn of lemon zest which gives it a nice slight lemony flavor which my family loves.  I will continue to use this recipe and thanks for the hints.  I hope I've helped.  Enjoy!

This is MY grandmother's recipe, too!  I was just handed this recipe from my mother, who decided of the five of her daughters, I was the only one qualified to get my grandmother's recipe book!  Awesome cheesecake - but I leave it in the oven for 3 hours (don't even open it!) after it's cooked, then leave on the counter for another two hours, then chill it.  And, to avoid a split top, bake the cheesecake inside of a shallow pan with about an inch of water.  Keeps the cake moist and it won't crack!

I decided to make this cheesecake because it's true Italian with the use of Ricotta. I followed the ingredients; exactly. I also used a water bath by adding warm water and wrapping the 9" spring pan in foil, so that the water would not seep into the pan. I let it sit, after cooked, in the oven for 2 hours and then refrigerated overnight. Let me say--this is the BEST cheesecake that we have ever had! By "we" I mean about 12 people for dessert on Christmas. Everyone there was from New York (we now live in Texas) and they were beyond impressed. I was asked for the recipe by everyone. I will be making this again for New Year's Eve for some local friends. THIS IS A KEEPER and I will be making it often!!! THANK YOU!!!!!!

It's a basic good recipe-it's much like the Argo Cornstarch recipe of years ago. But by no means whatsoever is it an authentic Italian recipe:sour cream and cream cheese...these ingredients are just not Italian or used in Italy in  ricotta pies or cheesecakes. Sorry. It's not a bad recipe-it just irks me when something is billed as authentic Italian fare and it's just not. Americans of Italian descent living in America would make this and call it "Italian". I would call it American-Italian. Like Ragu.

Very good cheesecake!  Not too sweet.  It was light and creamy. 
I followed the recipe exactly as it called for.  I never opened the oven after the first hour of cooking, and left it in there another hour.  After I took it out the cheesecake jiggled in the middle - I was so worried it wasn't cooked enough.  But after the 6 hours of chilling in the fridge, it was awesome!  Thank you!

Easily the BEST cheesecake I've ever eaten!  And with no crust to distract from the creamy "cheese" taste...yum!  It took me 4 tries to finally get zero cracks on the top.  After mixing the cream and ricotta cheeses until smooth, add the sugar, eggs, lemon juice and zest, vanilla, cornstarch, flour and butter and combine all at the same time.  Don't over-mix!  Gently add sourcream last and don't pour everything right into the middle of the pan--try to evenly distribute.  I also added two 9x13 pans filled with boiling water on the rack beneath the cheesecake.  Baked at 325 degrees for one  hour only and left in the oven for 2 hours with the hot water.  After 2 hours removed the pan with the beautifully, un-cracked, perfect cake!  After greasing the springform pans, you may want to cut a piece of parchment paper for the bottom before pouring in the batter.  When releasing the pan, remove the ring, but leave the cake on the bottom (with the parchment) and place on a lovely footed cake stand for serving.  The parchment will protect the cake from picking up the "metal" taste of the pan.  Also, it is a necessity to let the cake sit in the refrigerator at least overnight prior to serving--make sure it's covered so it won't pick up the flavors of nearby foods.  I've noticed that if it sits in the frig for a couple of days prior to serving, it tastes better.  GREAT recipe--thanks SO MUCH!

Very good cheesecake. I did substitute lower fat ingredients (1 block of 1/3 less fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream - other than that, regular ingredients).  It was very quick to make since there is no crust.  Just the right texture and wonderful flavor.

This cheesecake recipe is EXCEPTIONAL! I made it for my mom for Thanksgiving as she prefers and authentic crustless, toppingless cheesecake. I made it in a bain-marie and it turned out beautifully. The cake itself is light and airy and not very sweet at all, just like the cheesecakes at the deli! Tastes even better the day after!

Perfect as is, but I made some changes to make it more buffet/pot luck friendly.  I used a glass 9x13 pan, sprayed with baking spray.  The big advantage here is that you can cut into easy-to-serve squares for people to serve themselves, a little easier than delicate slices.  Press a cookie crust into the bottom (chocolate wafer crumbs, almond shortbread, anything you like.  I save leftovers in the freezer).  I like to add about 1/2 tsp each of orange and almond extract and mini chocolate chips...not necessary, but very good.  Some people like to add orange and/or lemon zest instead of extract, depends what you have and what you like.  I bake this the same time and temp. as written, but it fits inside a lasagna-type pan 1/2 full of hot water (cold water adds to the baking time).  Unlike a springform pan, you don't have to wrap this pan in foil to prevent leaks.  Avoid cheesecake cracks in general by not overbeating ingredients, especially with the eggs; too much air has to escape.  the water bath helps too. I love this recipe because you can mix it all by hand.  After the second hour cooling, you can open the oven door and let it cool slowly inside.  I sometimes sift cocoa over, like a tiramisu.  Can also decorate with strawberry slices or raspberries.

I made this cheese cake for my mother in-laws party with her German friends.  It was the hit of the party.  Everyone wanted the recipe and wanted me to make it the next time they got together.

Excellent cheesecake.  I always read the reviews for tips. I used a 11 x 9 pan, preheated and full of water on the lower rack, as well as 3-8 oz of cream cheese and 8 oz of sour cream. Baked for an hour at 325, sat in the oven after baking for an hour. I also lined my spring pan with parchment to avoid any metallic taste. No cracks at all.  Aging a day at least is a must for the true flavor.  Some reviewers wrote its "not authentic" Italian.  Yes, you could use Mascarpone and next time I may. 
As an Italian American, let me remind those reviewers that when most Italians first came to the States, homeland recipes were altered with local ingredients. True Italian ingredients were not available like they are now.
Update: This time, made it with 16 oz of Mascarpone, 8 oz cream cheese and 8 oz sour cream. Used the same baking method. Delicious!!! 2ndUpdate:   3-8oz Mascarpone and no cream cheese, ricotta and 8 oz sour cream is great.  It seems this recipe has been changed a couple of times on this site.

Real Italian Cheese cake recipe came from Italy many years ago. Italian cream cheese is Marscarpone, which not even close to American cream cheese. I do not question that the recipes are good tasting but cannot be considered Authentic by any stretch of the imagination, thus the 1 star rating.

Authentic ricotta cheesecake!  Definitely do a water bath another thing that works well with cheesecakes is to get your cream and ricotta cheeses to room temp. and don't over mix.  Although it didn't call for it, I did a graham cracker crust. This was light, fluffy and very good.  After cooking, I let it chill, or "set" in the fridge for 6 hours.  I topped it with cherry sauce and whippd cream.

The ingredients are perfect with perfect portions. Thank you. I had to adjust baking time (which many people may have to with all the different ovens) but no biggie because I was putting a topping on anyway. It didn't change the flavor.

We made this recipe 2 months ago for the first time and I served it that same day.  It did not go over too well with my friends and a lot was left over which went into the fridge for a couple of days.  When we tried it again about 3 days later - OMG - what a difference.  The cake needs "aging" at which point it becomes irresistible.  It actually becomes better day by day but doesn't make it past 5 days in our house. The texture is creamy and light with just the right amount of sweetness. We since made the cake three more times and the only thing we changed in the recipe is that we used a bit more lemon juice as well as a good amount of lemon rind.  HEAVENLY!!

First of all, this is the best homemade cheesecake I've ever had!
I baked it in a springform pan, suspended over a casserole dish with 1" water in it, and had to add about 20 extra minutes to baking time (I think the water cooled down the oven?). Followed other reviewers' advice and left it in the oven for an additional hour, then put in the refrigerator overnight.
It only developed a small crack in the middle, which didn't really take away from the aesthetic of the cake. 
Texture is unlike any other cheesecake - fluffy and creamy without losing any of the decadent flavor characteristic of this dessert. 
Served with strawberries, this is the perfect ending to a formal dinner!

Good stuff!  Definitely something different from your average ho hum all cream cheese cheesecake.  I'm not sure if I like the slightly bumpy texture of the cake because of the ricotta but it is certainly a lighter cake from a regular cheesecake!  Also I added 2-3 tablespoons of lemon zest and it really gave the cake a nice fresh taste so I didn't even need a sauce.  To prevent a cracked cake, bake in a waterbath with foil wrapped around the springform to prevent water seeping inside the pan at 325 for 1 hour. Then when it is no longer super jiggly, turn off the oven and leave the cake inside for at least 2 hours. Then remove and leave on counter to cool completely for 1-2 hours. Then refrigerate overnight.  I made a little strawberry raspberry sauce for the top to add some pizzazz by melting half a jar of strawberry jam, then a tablespoon or so of lemon juice, a tsp or two of sugar, then adding some frozen raspberries at the very end so they are still whole in the sauce.

We loved this cheesecake.  DH is a cheesecake freak and I do believe that this is now his favorite cheesecake recipe.  The texture is light and almost "egg custard-y;" almost like egg custard pie.  If you're looking for dense, super smoothe, NY-style cheesecake, you need to look at other recipes.  The ricotta cheese is prominent as well as the texture.  Mine cracked horribly but I followed the recipe and method to a T.  I do believe the temp needs to be at 325 degrees farenheit and the cake would probably benefit a water bath while cooking to prevent the cracks.  The flavor is absolutely wonderful and, if covered with a sauce, is presentable.  Oh, and I love the fact that there is no crust!

I had high expectations after reading all the rave reviews. I was greatly disappointed. The texture was not creamy, more "fluffy." The taste was bland. It has no crust, which I find strange. This recipe needs it to bring some flavor to the table.  I won't be making it again, there are much tastier recipes.

I've made this twice now.  It is wonderful and special.  I love how it is not so heavy and dense like most cheesecakes.  It doesn't have the crust either.  Its pure  lovliness :)  The second time I made it I subbed almond extract for vanilla and all cornstarch instead of 3 cornstarch/3 flour.   Whenever I make cheesecakes I always have water in a separate dish in the oven to prevent the common crack that cheesecakes are known for.  LOVE IT!  THANK YOU APRILS GRANDMA! EDIT TO ADD...make sure you use a good italian ricotta...not store brand.  I used Kroger this time and it was watery.  It was full fat too.

I have made this recipe twice with adjustments from other bakers.  I used 3 pkgs (8oz) cream cheese and only 1 cup sour cream.  I also made my own ricotta (which is super easy and way better than store bought!).  For baking time I preheated the oven to 350 degrees F than dropped to 325 for 1 1/2 hours.  Turned off and left in oven for 3 hours and then on counter for an hour before refrigerating.  

First cheesecake we made into a coconut cheesecake, no recipe anywhere so we created our own by using cream of coconut instead of sour cream.  For coconut lovers - yummy!  

Second cheesecake I made into a chocolate chip cheesecake by stirring in 1 cup of mini-chips.  It is FANTASTIC!  Very light but full of flavor.  

Only issue was I used a 9" spring form and should have used 10" - it rose over the top and dropped edges off (darn, had to eat those first...).  

Overall this is great cheesecake and you won't be disappointed.  Also knocks the water bath method out of the water!

This is absolutely the best cheesecake ever!  I am from Italian decent also and I have had family members make the "authentic Italian Ricotta Cheesecake" when I was a child.  Over the years I have asked for theit recipe but was always told "Oh, I'll give it to you", but no one ever actually shared it with me.  Thank you so very much for sharing what is clearly a family secret.  I, like you, believe that everyone needs to know how to make this very authentic and traditional cheesecake.  THIS WAS FABULOUS!  And I will surely share it with my daughter as this is going to be a family favorite of ours for years to come!

awsome recipe, very similar to one I have used for years (we are Italian also)  A quick tip.. The water bath with all that foil etc. is not really necessary. Just put a small bowl of water on the other oven rack & the steam will give you th same results.

This was my first attempt at making an Italian cheesecake. 
I placed a pan of water above the baking cheesecake; I must say this is the first time I have ever made a cheesecake in a spring-form pan that did not have cracks!  Does it really matter if the pan is in the water or not? I provided a humid baking environment and it turned out awesome. I used marscapone cheese instead American cream cheese, to make it even more Italian. I baked at 475 for 10 minutes, reduced oven to 325 and let it bake for an hour. I then shut off the oven and let it rest for three hours in the oven before even attempting to open the door. I took it out, let it cool further before putting into the fridge uncovered.   The flavors were subtle, so I think next time I may add lemon zest in addition to the lemon juice and vanilla. Or maybe even lemon extract. I won't say this cake has a gritty texture but more of a, maybe, curdled texture. After conferencing with my 84 year old mother, she told me that when adding the melted butter to drizzle it in as opposed to dumping it all in, to better incorporate it.  I read elsewhere to drain the ricotta cheese in a sieve and then run through a food processor to make it more smooth. I will definitely make this again!

This is my favorite recipe for cheesecake.  It ALWAYS gets rave reviews! I follow the ingredients exactly as it's written.  However, this cake WILL crack in the center if you don't bake it in a hot water bath.  Wrap your pan in aluminum foil and place in a large roasting pan with about 1.5 inches of boiling water.  After you turn off the oven, DO NOT open it.  Leave it alone.  I would also recommend leaving it in the oven unopened for 2 hours as opposed to 1.  This is a great compromise between your traditional Italian cheesecake with a New York twist.

This is my go-to cheesecake recipe.  I've made it several times - mostly because my family always requests it :-)  In my opinion, this recipe is a cross between a new york style cheesecake and an italian cheesecake.  It's not too cream-cheesy and the texture is light.  It's awesome and would definitely recommend this one if you're looking for a good cheesecake recipe.

First time I made this followed recipe exactly with the exception of: I added the zest of a 1/2 lemon and the zest of a small orange, also cooked in a water bath...The results  OUTSTANDING just like the Ricotta cheesecake I ate as a kid living in New York....The flavor and texture are perfect as is....Just add the Zest and water bath and it will be PERFECT.....Enjoy

I thought this was just okay. I made it as written except I added a crust.  The flavor was kind of bland and the texture was odd.  Although I did a water bath and left it in the oven for 3 hours, it still cracked.  I put a whipped chocolate ganache on top which gave it a bit more flavor.  I won't make this again.

I followed this recipe to exactly.  I am not a huge cheesecake fan, but this makes me like cheesecake.  My husband says it is close to the best cheesecake he's ever had (in Italy) but not quite there.  He says it needs to be creamier...which I think can be solved by using Mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese.  

Also...I almost didn't make this because the recipe did not state what size spring-form pan to use.  ***I ended up using a 9".****

Without a doubt this is one of the best cheesecake I've ever tried!  I followed Dan le Chef's suggestions (added the extra cream cheese and dropped the sour cream to 8 oz.), but I also added a container filled with water underneath to add moisture.  My cheesecake was immaculate!  Not one crack and the taste was absolutely delicious!  I plan on making another one this weekend because the first one was consumed so quickly.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, it really is fantastic!

I followed the advice of the other bakers and baked it at a lower temperature for longer, wrapped it and placed it in 1 inch of water.  There was no cracking, but the cake was too moist.  Next time I will try without the water bath.  The cake was incredibly tasty.  I served it with a blackberry sauce and whipped cream.  It was a big hit! I'm only giving it four stars because I prefer a less rich ricotta cheesecake that my husband's grandmother passed down to our family which is simply ricotta, sugar, eggs, and flavorings.  The cream cheese and sour cream make this cake very rich.  I highly recommend it!

I was jealous of people here saying that this cheesecake was great for them until I baked one myself. I am not sure why some people have cracked results, but if you bake exactly to the directions it comes out perfect. I gave it a water bath and I added freshly grated nutmeg and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon. This was most perfect cheesecake ever! If those of you who followed the directions and still got cracked results, it might be the oven temperature then because my oven's temp. runs higher than most recipes call for. Thank you for this valuable recipe. I will keep it for life.

My Mom has wanted me to bake an Italian Ricotta Cheesecake forever, so for Xmas, I gave this one a try. It was simply the best we had ever tasted, and I was asked for the recipe! Not overly sweet, light and creamy texture, light golden brown on top and we served it with fresh berries. Italian cheesecake has No crust, and it didn't need one. I followed ALL the tips by previous reviewers, and wrapped the springform pan base with 3 layers of foil, and baked in a boiling water bath. Left it in the oven after baking  time 3 hours, and then on the counter an additional 2 with no cracks at all in the cake. This is a classic winner!

Great recipe! I did not have ricotta and so I used Indian cottage cheese called 'Paneer' here in India. I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and used an additional 8 ounce package of cream cheese. I blitzed the cottage cheese first in a blender with a few tablespoonfuls of water to give a creamy texture before mixing with the cream cheese. Omitted the sour cream and baked a chocolate sponge base before pouring the batter and to top it all, I melted some dark chocolate (about 8 -10 ounces) and swirled it in the batter before baking. As suggested, I left the cheesecake in the oven for an hour before taking it out. It was perfect, with no cracks! Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

This cheesecake recipe wasn't for me.  I guess I'm too used to cream cheese based cheesecakes which are smooth.  This recipe is not smooth it retains the  ricotta cheese texture which is kind of grainy.   Also taste wise it tasted like ricotta cheese despite the addition of cream cheese and sour cream.  This was my first  time making a ricotta based cheese cake.  I think this will be my last.  I would like to add that the recipe I followed is based on one reviewers suggestion which adds additional cream cheese and takes out some of the sour cream.

I have to agree that this is an excellent recipe. The texture and taste are far superior to other cheesecakes I've made. I consider this equivalent to one of those fancy cheesecakes you can get in a high-end bakery. Yum! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It was unbelievable! I followed some of Dan le Chef's tips.  Truly a gourmet cake.  I did top it off with lemon curd.  Received rave reviews from family and friends.

I followed the ingredients exactly but halved the recipe, cooking it in an 8" springform pan, but allowed it to set in the oven longer (after it was turned off) since we were leaving for a while. The taste is wonderful, but I don't much care for the texture of the ricotta cheese, seems a little grainy for my liking. I'll stick to cream cheese and sour cream cheesecakes I think. Are some ricotta's creamier than others?

I made this cheesecake for a dinner party I was invited to. Everyone loved it, and I had a couple of people asking for the recipe. It was a little more jiggly than I expected. I cooked it in a water bath for 1 hour and 15 minutes, but took it out because the top was geting rather brown. Next time I will leave it in the oven for longer (maybe 90 or 100 minutes) and cover it with foil for the first hour. The texture on this was fantastic, it was light and airy!

This ricotta cheesecake did not have the density of ricotta that I was hoping for (hence 4 stars) but it is a winner nevertheless!  I added long shreds of lemon zest to mine (about 1 TB., or the zest of one lemon) and it was a HUGE hit with the family at Easter.  Light and slightly lemony.

It was easy to mix up by hand in no time.  I took the advice of others here and placed a large pan of water in the rack below the cake.  It did still get a crack, but that settled in upon cooling.  Perhaps I overbaked it? Adding another 15 minutes when I thought it was too "wobbly?"

I used frozen cherries to make a fruit sauce to spoon over the top.

This cake was so popular with the family that I am making another for Mother's Day.  (This time with freshly sliced strawberries and a little sugar.)

 THANK YOU SO Much for sharing what must have been a family secret, with this Irish-American who loves good Italian food.

I had never had a cheesecake like this before. It sounded interesting so I decided to make it. Am I ever glad. It was amazing!! Everyone loved the flavor. Several did comment on the texture, so when I make again, I will try to make it smoother. Wonderful cake.

This is delicious!  However, my cake did not cook all the way through. I left it in for 1 hour and 20 minutes, AND I let it cool in the oven for three hours afterward. I never opened the oven. I then put it in the refrigerator for three hours. It never cooked in the middle, and my oven is only a few years old.  Also, I have had Italian cheesecake from an Italian bakery, and it had far more ricotta. However, this was still a great cheesecake, even though it wasn't what I was expecting.  Overall, I give this four stars because of the failure to cook properly and the texture, which was more American than Italian.

Thanks for this recipe, April! It is wonderful!! I made a couple of alterations based on others reviews..I added 8 more oz of cr. cheese and used only 8 oz of sour cream, per Dan leChef. I also baked it in a water bath at 350 for and hour and a half and then left it in the oven for 3 hours. It was perfect...no cracking!!! I also made a fruit topping for it with strawberries...very yummy! I am making this for my mother's birthday and will make a chocolate sauce to drizzle over the top!! Terrific recipe and easy, too!!

Delicious recipe. My secret for getting a crack-free cheesecake is to wrap the springform pan in foil and put it in a larger pan. Fill the outer pan 1/2 way up the springform with COLD water, not hot. The theory behind this is that as the water heats in the oven, the sides won't overbake before the center is done. Works for me.

Love this cheesecake!  I did not make it far enough ahead so the center was still warm.  I can't wait to try the really chilled leftovers tonight.  Only thing I changed was I left it in the oven 2 hrs after baking.  I did have a huge split in the center (yes I used a water bath) but that did not hurt the taste one bit.  It is light in texture, creamy and just sweet enough.  It pulled away clean from the pan like no other cheesecake has done before.  Loved it!

Tried this recipe using the variation that Dan la Chef recommended. My cake cracked within three minutes off being in the oven. Also no where in this recipe does it say what size pan to use. I used a 9" but would have been better with a larger size. Taste is great. Cracks had to be distinguished with fruit topping

Thanks! Like apparently many others, this recipe was used by my Italian-american grammy, but I couldn't find it so came on here.   This cake is the best.  To those complaining it's not "authentic", you are missing the point, it's a style of cheesecake, and yes some ingredients have been adapted and swapped out for american counterparts, but recipes are fluid things and that's what happens over time.  It is authentic Italians american style, and this is what italian -Americans call it. 
Also, if you have trouble with cracking, try a water-bath.

Update : 3.  This cheesecake is creamy, delicious and  presents wow factor with the ricotta cheese.  I blended the cream cheese with half the sugar until creamy then added/blended in the ricotta.
I whisked the eggs with the wet ingredients.   Mixed the remaining dry ingredients together and added both at same time.  Sour cream I added last as per the recipe. NOTE:  I used  an electric mixer for the cheeses BUT switched to a wooden spoon for blending the remaining ingredients.  It is imperative to not over mix.  I placed in a 9 inch pan, wrapped in foil and water bath.  I left in oven for 3 hours.  No cracks at all.  This is the forth time I have made this and I have made with and without a crust!  Recipe will accommodate either.  BOTH are great….. Finally I topped with blueberry sauce recipe from this site!!!  Umm!

I made this exactly following the recipe, except I followed the advice of other reviewers, wrapped the springform pan in 3 layers of aluminum, and placed 2 round 9" cake pans filled with water on the rack below the cheesecake. Baked for 1.5 hours, left it in the oven for another 3 hours, then rested it outside the oven for 2 hours before putting it on the fridge. No cracking at all as some people complained. Just out of preference I added a graham cracker crumb crust and a strawberry glaze. I served it after letting it sit a day in the fridge at a family Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! I was surprised by how easy it was, just requires appropriate resting time.

Ok mine cracked like the San Andreas fault, but I did not care. It was delicious!! Best and easiest cheesecake I ever made. I did not miss the graham cracker crust at all. The cake was lighter then NY style cheesecake and not as crumbly. Had a delicious flavor. Not exactly like my Italian grandma used to make (I think she used all ricotta) but still the best cheesecake I've ever had.

Oh, my, a very good cheesecake, and I love that it doesn't have a crust.  Mine had some major cracks despite the ice cubes thrown in the oven twice during baking.  No matter, it was for just us.  I must say, however, that after tasting it the day after making it I wasn't impressed.  BUT....the next day and the next it just got better and better.  Even my cheesecake-hating husband likes it.  Very, very good....just wish it was prettier!

This recipe is the best!  Thank you for sharing! I have made it several times now - take others advice and use the water bath to keep it moist and uncracked, leave in the oven for two hours after cooking... All great tips!

I have so far made 3 of these cheesecakes, they are awesome, last time I made two of them and I cut the sugar in half, and it was still awesome.  I did not alter anything else.  I do put tin foil around the spring foam pan, and then I place on a flat cookie sheet.  I cook for one hour and leave in oven for one hr then the frig.  My son in law at the cake in 3 days, he woke up in the middle of the night to eat it.  It is light but yet dense, it is the perfect combination of ricotta cheese, cream cheese and sour cream, I added orange zest.  This cake is way better then some brand names and it's user friendly to make, and it smells amazing.  It is alot of cake too, and would cost a fortune, had I have to buy it in a bakery.  It is a keeper. It gets thicker after a few days, and transforms into AMAZING! Yummo!

Great cheese cake I make it every year. I am of Italian decent and my great grand parents are from Naples Italy. Although my grand mother only used Ricotta (no cream cheese) this cheese cake  is better than the ones I purchase at Eileen's , Juniors and D’aiuto  in NYP. I use the recipe  but bake at 335 for one hour with two cake pans of hot water underneath the cheese cake  and let it rest in oven for two hours, no cracks

I actually found this recipe by punching in 'ricotta' into the ingredient list and omitting 'tomato'. I feel that it is very versatile and you can really substitute pretty freely. I had to do this since this was a "last of" cake. I used the last of a few things that I needed to get out of the fridge. I only had two eggs, only had orange juice instead of lemon (and used it generously, probably about 4 tbsp), had no sour cream so I used about 13 ounces honey flavored greek yogurt (full fat) and had about 20 ounces ricotta. I had less than the needed butter as well by about 2 tablespoons. Had this turned out horribly I wouldn't have rated the recipe but it was divine. No crust needed, no fruit needed, it's just a great basic recipe that you can alter to your taste or available ingredients.

I've made this cheesecake three times now, and it has never disappointed.  And understand that I am a 50 year old father/husband who just likes to cook but has no training or background in culinary arts.

I do wrap the springform in multiple layers of foil and place it in a roasting pan with about an inch and a half of water.  I cook for 1.5 hours at 325, then shut the over off and leave it for 3 hours.

Never had a crack.  Always has amazing flavor.  My wife was shocked to discover that she did not miss the traditional graham cracker crust at all!

I substituted low fat ricotta cheese.  I followed the baking directions as listed and had wonderful results. The top browned a bit more than I had hoped, but this didn't affect the the cake's taste.  It was incredibly delicious; wonderful creamy, light texture.  The favor was rich and so we were able to get more than the 8 servings!!  This is a keeper.

I enjoyed the flavour of this cheesecake, but the texture was a little bit too dense for what I was looking for. I thought having the ricotta would make for a lighter cake. I got rave reviews from my guests. Next time I think the temperature should be lower - maybe 325. I got a deeply cracked top and slightly browned edges, but not enough to affect the flavour - I trimmed the golden brown edges anyway, and covered in cherry sauce with whipped cream, so no one could tell.

Wonderful, traditional Italian cheesecake -- no crust, and not too sweet.  To avoid all the hassel of wrapping the pan, etc., I just put a pan of water on the rack beneath the rack the cake sits on.  (Use one about same diameter as the springform pan or whatever pan your using.)  No cracking, ever.  Remember cake may be a bit "jiggily" in the center after removing from oven, but will firm up in fridge.  This is as it should be; don't overbake the cake!  You can even make this in an 8X8 pyrex dish if preferred and not overly concerned about serving it on a cakeplate, etc.  And if you don't mind it being a bit less traditional, you can add a pinch of nutmeg and/or cinnamon to the batter before baking.  Nutmeg adds a nice touch of flavor.

This was one of my best cheesecakes. I know use the water bath method to keep the cake from cracking and retain moisture. I also cut up fresh strawberries with a little sugar and put them on top of the cheesecake.

I'm going to give this 5 stars even though I had to make it a second time using someone else's recommendations.  The first time i made it as it says, but it turned out dense and dry.  The second time, I wrapped the bottom in foil, baked it at 325 for 1.5 hours, cooled it for 1.5 hours in the oven, and then let it rest at room temperature for 3 hours.  It was light, fluffy, delicious, and no cracks!!  I've also played around with adding things like coconut extract and sweetened coconut flakes, and it's equally as tasty.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is identical to my Italian mother-in-law's recipe. The previous reviewer missed the point. Italian cheesecakes don't have the graham crust and the flavors of the vanilla and lemon are subtle so that the creaminess is the focus. I love this recipe. Do go by feel if you are using a deep springform. Baking time may take longer. If it cracks in the center (which they sometime do) it will not affect the taste at all. Great with a raspberry or strawberry puree but I like it best plain.

Definitely the best cheesecake I've ever made.  It was smooth, rich and creamy.  I made one small change.  I substituted the lemon juice for the zest of one orange.  What an amazing bright and fresh taste that offered.  This cheesecake didn't last very long once I put it on the table.  I've gotten many requests to make this again.  Thanks April - for sharing this wonderful recipe.  It is definitely one of my top 5 desserts to make!

The very best Cheese cake recipe I have ever made.  I made the recipe as written.  Did not read the reviews until after making it.  So I did get a couple of cracks on top.  I covered it with Cherry pie topping.  mmmm, so creamy, I think I over beat it because while baking it went over the top then came down while cooling.  company flipped over it!  The next day was 10 times better if you can imagine.

The first time I did this I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing! The second time I tried to add a brown sugar crust like someone had posted, but I did something wrong because it came oozing out of everything and made a mess of my oven. Gets a 5 because it's amazing as is!

Great italian cheesecake!  I had no cracked top after using the "water bath" technique.  I also cooked for an hour, let sit in the oven for an hour, left on the counter for an hour, then put the cheesecake in the fridge overnight.  Added 3-4 TBSP. of cocoa to make it chocolate (other than that I followed as is).

I made this cheesecake for my husband's birthday.  It is time for my son-in-love's birthday and he asked my daughter if I'd make it for his special day!  I will be adding a cookie crust this time.  Thanks for sharing a great one!!!

This was soooooo good, ricotta can be a little bland so I added a scant amount of fresh grated nutmeg and served with blueberry sauce that I added a little nutmeg to as well.  Helps a little to keep from cracking if you put a pan 1/2 full of water in the oven w/the cheesecake.  Thanks for a lighter authentic cheesecake recipe!

Unbelievably good...I followed teh directions to the letter and my finicky 13-year old son wolfed it down like there was no tomorrow. Rich, creamy texture and the taste is sublime. Thank you for a great recipe!

Everyone loved this cheesecake!  I've been looking for a good ricotta cheese recipe and now I've found it!  It wasn't too heavy nor too light - just right!  I followed others' advice and wrapped the bottom of the springform pan w/foil and baked it in about a 1-inch water bath.  Baked 1 hour, and then let sit in oven (without opening) for another 2 1/2 hours.  Cooled on counter for another 1 1/2 hours, then refrigerated overnight.  My daughter helped me top it with fresh blueberries and sliced strawberries.  I've tried many cheesecake recipes and we all really liked this one.

This recipe was delicious!  I had leftover ricotta, so I tried this recipe.  I didn't have enough ricotta or cream cheese, probably about 3/4 of each.  I simply cut back on the other ingredients a little.  The fact that it was still delicious says a lot about this recipe. I did add a brown sugar crust by mixing about 2 cups of brown sugar with 1-2 tbps. butter (just enough to make crumbly) then press into the bottom of pan.  I also did not have a springform pan, so I improvised with a square cake pan and it still turned out great, although it may not have looked as pretty.  For a little something extra sprinkle chocolate chips on top before baking or drizzle caramel on top just before serving.  Excellent recipe, I will definitely make again.

Fabulous cheesecake. I'm originally from NY and living in the Midwest and all I've come across here is very creamy textured cheesecakes. I made this for my holiday party as well as for my daughter's teacher's birthday all with rave reviews. My only change was 2 TBS vanilla. I also did one with potato flour for a coworker who eats gluten free and she loved it.

I really don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but this has to be the most tasteless cake I have every made.  No flavor at all.  I love cheesecake, will eat ricotta straight from the container and sour cream and cream cheese.  I followed the recipe exactly (I do the first time) but after a taste, I actually threw it out.  And I never throw out food!  Very bland. I made a Lemon Icebox Cheesecake from  the Cook's Country Cookbook at Christmas (substituted shortbread cookies for crust) and it was incredible!  
I don't understand the 5 star ratings. This is definitely NOT and Italian ricotta cake of any sort - and I'm Italian.

Yummy@ Light, fluffy, and everyone loved it. Also, I didn't have the correct pan, so used 9" pie tins. I sprayed them with "baking" cooking spray and the edges were perfectly brownd, no sticking to the pans at all! :)

I have been making  this cheesecake for years, we call it Father Sarducchi Cheesecake.  An authentic Italian cheesecake does not have a heavy crust,  I think this is part of the reason I love it so much.  I have tried it with both marscopne and cream cheese and I prefer the cream cheese (less expensive).  I have given this recipe to so many people after they have tried it.   Always a soft creamy texture.  If you're finding lumps or a curdled texture, you're not mixing it enough or you're using a store brand ricotta.  Also, I only use 'whole milk' ricotta.  Excellent recipe, mine came from my Grandmother who came over from Italy in the very early 1900's.

This has ruined me for for any other cheesecake. I made it as written and it is wonderful.  Smooth and creamy it melts in the mouth.  It is moist and creamy.  So good it really doesn't need a crust or topping. Just incredible!

Yummy! Halved in case I didn't like it (cheesecake isn't cheap) and used a cupcake tin. I filled 11 cups to the top and put hot water in the 12th, baked for 25 mins and turned off oven for about 40 mins. They rose high while baking but then fell so no batter leaked. Still used a tbsp of lemon and sprayed the tin but this made the bottoms a bit soggy so I'd recommend grease/flour for the pan. To those who feel this isn't authentic Italian, you can sub the cream cheese and sour cream for mascarpone, extra ricotta and egg yolks but I don't find those produce a creamier or tastier cheesecake than this plus the cost doubles. Thanks for sharing!

I have been making the "Lindy's" recipe for cheesecake for many years,  but  I decided to try this one.  So glad I did!!  My family loved the texture, the flavor and the lightness.
I  used the "Lindy's" crust recipe as we all like our cheesecake with crust.  Great cheesecake and not hard to make.

Thank you very much for sharing your family recipe.  This is my first time attempting to make an Italian cheesecake with ricotta and it was soooo good . . . so nice and moist!  It tastes like it's from a bakery!  The perfect dessert for those extra special occasions!  I will definitely make this again!

I made several changes as suggested by others: 1 tsp lemon zest, 1 and 1/2 tsp orange zest, I tsp vanilla extract as suggested and added 3 tsp of anisette.  I added 5 eggs, instead of 6.
I also used Polly-O ricotta which I find to be creamier and smoother than most other brands.  I also covered the bottom of the spring pan with heavy aluminum foil and put a large shallow roasting pan beneath the cake. The cake did not sink in the middle and did not crack.
Overall, the cake was very good but not sweet enough for our taste so I served it with cherry preserves on top.

This recipe is amazing.  I just made a half-recipe and followed the reviewer Dawn's advice.  I pre-heated to oven to 350 then turned it down to 325.  Put the cheesecake pan in a water bath and after baking left it in the oven for two hours.  We couldn't wait until it was refrigerated to taste it.  It is so amazing warm.  I wish I had made a whole recipe.  My husband is having a huge serving instead of dinner.  This cheesecake is so light and flavorful.  I'll be making this again for sure.

This is the cheesecake recipe I've tried! I was actually short on the eggs - I only had 2 - and it still turned out. It cracked a little more than I would've liked - probably because I was short on the eggs. However, I covered it with berries anyway. The important thing is it was still DELICIOUS! Everyone loved it! Thank you for sharing your grandmother's recipe!

This I should my 1st try at cheesecake.   It turned out tasty, though cracked.....I don't think that's the fault of the recipe, instead it is my lack of experience.  It's not particularly sweet, which I liked.  And it's tangy which is also liked. Lastly, its lighter than NY cheesecake.

I made this cheesecake for Christmas and received several compliments on it.  I love cheesecake and have made many, but this was my first ricotta cheesecake.  It's definitely not as sweet as I'm use to, which can be a good thing.  I was a bit skeptical since there's no crust (I've never made a cheesecake without a crust), but it was great...really didn't need a crust!  It would also be great with fresh fruit, pie filling, caramel, chocolate ganache or chocolate shavings on top!

This is probably the best cheesecake I've ever eaten. So light and creamy and not overly "wet" as most ricotta cheesecakes are.   I followed the directions exactly but used whipped cream cheese instead of the regular packaged one.

Delicious and light. Everyone raved about it. I made a few modifications as recommended by other reviewers and the cake was perfect--no cracks either. The water bath was key, I think.

My modifications, per other reviewers: reduced sour cream to  8 oz  and added an extra 8oz cream cheese. Preheated oven to 350 degrees and then turned down to 325 to cook. Wrapped the base of the springform pan in 4 layers of tinfoil. . Placed springform pan in a roasting pan and then put about 1-1/2" of boiling water to the roasting pan. Baked for approx. 1-1/2 hours at 325 degrees instead of the 350. The center will still wiggle (area about the size of a 1/2 dollar). Turn off the oven and leave it in for 3 hours. Do not open oven door during three hours. Remove from oven and leave it on the counter for another 2 hours and then put in the refridgerator overnight.

I'm so excited.  I've been trying to find this  recipe that I had lost 15 years ago!  Now that I've grown a bit as a cook, I'm curious.  Has anyone tried making this with marscapone cheese instead of cream cheese? Hope someone sees this question after all these years since the original post!

I made this just recently and did it according to what the one reviewer said. I made a cinnamon crust, added an extra package of cream cheese, and just 8 oz of sour cream. Then baked it at 475° for 10 minutes followed by dropping the temp to 200° for an hour. Turned off oven and left cake in for three hours before cooling completely on counter, and finally putting in fridge overnight. There was a little crack but I think that was my fault, I almost forgot the butter and had to stir it in while batter was in the pan. I think it cracked because I wasn't able to stir the butter all the way in but it turned out great tasting and firmed perfectly. I normally hate cheesecake but I loved this one and am planning to make another soon plus it was devoured by my family and my boyfriend's family.

Some minor adjustments had to be made, like a 15 oz container of Ricotta Cheese instead of 16 oz (its all thats sold locally), increasing oven time to accommodate a new oven, etc... small stuff. The results though, are DELICIOUS! For me,  the baking times have to be adjusted if I use a flat beater or a wire whip beater, and if you like your finished cheesecake with a creamy texture or a more dryer texture.

This was the best cheesecake I've ever eaten.  I lowered the temperature to 325 degrees as others suggested and put two 9x13 pans of hot water on the lower rack under the cheesecake while it baked.  Then, I left the cheesecake in the over for two hours and then took it out.  It still had a small crack on the top so I guess I have to work on that, but the small crack did not take away from the awesome texture and taste of the cheesecake.  It was delicious and so easy to whip up!  I cannot wait to make this again and share it with all my family and friends!  Finally, understand that you cannot eat this on the day you make it...it has to be made in advance.

Second time making this cheesecake and we love it! The only things I do that aren't in the directions are to line the bottom of the springform pan with parchment paper (This way, even if you get a crack you just flip the cheesecake over and remove parchment for perfect presentation), and I put two 9X13 pans filled with water in the oven with the cheesecake and don't open the oven until it's completely cooled. Otherwise, awesome recipe!!

I have glanced at recipes on AR over the years, as well as other recipe websites, but have never felt compelled to return and review AND comment, until NOW: this cheesecake is INCREDIBLE.  Light and airy, absolutely on the mark with taste and texture.  Unlike other cheesecakes, which are extremely dense and rich - overkill after a few bites -  this one leaves you wanting more!    

I made only two changes: xylitol (birch extract) to replace the sugar [for low carb impact], and a grain-free baking mix to replace the starches in the batter [for a grain- and gluten-free product].  I also added a basic nut crust before pouring in the batter, because I love the juxtaposition of the fluffy filling atop the crisp texture of a crust.  I am THRILLED these minor alterations integrated smoothly, and I can spoil myself with an amazing cheesecake on my bday.

Definitely the best cheesecake recipe I've ever had. Not too sweet, light and almost fluffy, a perfect cakes to serve with summer fruits.

Thanks to Dawn's review tips, I wrapped it 2x. First, I put the bottom on 2 overlapping pieces of foil and set it into the rim, smashing the foil against the inside wall. Good thing I did because the second outside wrap still allowed water to get through. Then I set it in a big roasting pan, poured in the boiling water to surround it about ~1".

My oven may need adjusting because at 325°, I needed to bake it for 1 hour 30 minutes.

Came out beautifully with no cracks. Not bad for my first ever cheesecake. 

One piece of advise,  do not start baking this in the evening. I was up until 3:30 to remove it from my oven after 2 hours.

Oh my god, this cheesecake is awesome! My family is Italian but we've always just gone to the bakery to get desserts, so I tried this recipe liking the ingredients in it and it was a HUGE hit with everyone. Definitely a keeper...thanks for sharing!

I tweaked the recipe to make it THM (& diabetic) friendly.  I subbed 1/3 T. coconut flour for flour, 1/3 T. glucomannan powder for corn starch, & I used swerve instead of sugar.  As other reviewers had said, this is a very light cheesecake with a wonderful flavor!  I will be making this again!

This is my new favorite cheese cake! My daughter and I are both Celiac, so the only change I made was to substitute Gluten-free All-Purpose flour substitute for the regular flour.  Otherwise kept to the recipe. I have already made this cake four times and have referred many friends to it.  Thanks, April!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  It is very easy to make and I have had many requests to bake it.  It's light, not heavy and rich like NY cheesecake.  I made a cherry compote from canned cherries in the pie filling area of my local grocery store and served a tablespoon of it with each slice.  Absolutely fabulous!

This cheesecake reminds me of the same cake @ my favorite Italian restaurant, here in Southern California. Authentic homemade Sicilian style Italian cheesecake. Perfection. Don't even need to make a crust. ??

I made this a couple of weeks ago for a dinner party and incorporated some of Dawn's notes from Dec. 24, 2009.  I preheated to 350 but decreased to 325 when I put the cheesecake in the oven.  I baked it for almost 2 hours, then shut the oven off and left it for 3 hours before removing it to cool on the counter.  I also added a fair bit of lemon zest which gave it a very fresh taste.

It's not overly sweet, everyone loved it, even my significant other who doesn't care for cheesecake.

Word to the wise -- don't panic if your cheesecake is very jiggly after it's been baking for the requisite hour (or longer if at a lower temp) - leave it alone in the oven (do not open the door) for a few hours and it will set.

I also put a pan of hot water on the rack below my cheesecake.  And I wrapped the springform in a few layers of heavy duty foil.

No cracks, absolutely gorgeous and delicious.

Loved this recipe! THis is by far the world's best cheese cake ! I have made it with a graham cracker crust,added lemon zest, & lemon extract. I made it in a rectangular pan ,lined it with parchment paper & increased the recipe by a half. I was able to take the cheese cake out of the pan & topped it with lemon pie filling. WOW!! Have made it 3 times since Mother's Day! :P

This was very easy to make and just the right texture and sweetness without being heavy or sugary. We like our cheesecake less dense. I left out the butter by accident but didn't miss it. I did place two bowls of boiling water in the oven along with the cheesecake to ensure it didn't dry out, then just a couple of hours to chill in the frig. Topped the servings with Trader Joe's morrell cherries in a jar. This will be a regular dessert in our house

Very light and not too sweet.  I cut the recipe in half and put it inside a graham crust.  I used palm sugar instead of white, and it gave it a nice, almost mocha flavor.  I will be making it again!

This cheesecake tastes really good. I've baked it three times now. Do NOT taste it the first day or you may not like it because it has more of a ricotta texture. It's much better after chilled for 24 hours after setting. I've never had a problem with cracking like the others have had and I followed the recipe exact but I did follow others suggestions and wrapped the bottom of the pan in aluminum foil and set it in a 9x13 pan with water to bake. The last time I even over baked by 30 minutes on accident and it was still great. Overall it's a better presentation  cheesecake compared to American creamy style and the taste is awesome if you can get past the fact that it is a different texture. Be open minded and you'll love it as much as I do. I'll defiantly make it again.

I've made this several times now and have had rave reviews!!  I've added a fresh raspberry sauce a couple times and when I do I add a little sugar to the cheese cake and keep the sauce tangy.  Cooking for one hour and leaving in the oven a couple hours has worked to keep it from cracking as well

Well. I only made this because I had ricotta and sour cream that was going to go bad. I was prepared to give this one star after I mixed the filling. It seemed grainy and soupy. I went ahead and baked it anyway. WOW. Not a traditional cheesecake, but it promised that in the title didn't it? SO light and creamy. A little too sweet maybe? But great. THANKS!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was simply wonderful.  I loved the fact that it was creamy, rather than thick and not too sweet.  It actually resembled a custard cream cheese cake.  I pureed frozen raspberries in my mini prep food processor, and reduced it on the stove after adding a few Tbsp. of Chambord.   This glaze was delicious on top with additional fresh raspberries & blueberries.   Beautiful too !   My cake did crack, and not sure how to prevent that but I'm not that fussy.  It tasted amazing :)   Thank you April for the recipe.  All our guests wanted the recipe !

too much fat and carbs in recipe as printed.
i used fat free cream cheese and sour cream, part skim ricotta, egg substitute, 2 tbs. each of flour & cornstarch, 1 tsp. xanthan gum, and splenda instead of sugar.  trust me, you'll never know the difference.  otherwise a good recipe.

FOLLOW DIRECTIONS or use another recipe, follwed Dan le Chef review and the baking time is completely off, just took it out of the oven after letting it sit for 3 hours and it was not even cooked all the way through, just put it back in the oven to finish baking, not sure what will happen when re-cooking the cheese cake, but hate to loose the whole thing, this is very dissapointing as I wanted it ready for valentines dinner tonight, it would be best to follow orginal receipe, I will do that next time.

I was patient enough to leave in oven for the hour recommended; however, I did not wait for it to cool and certainly didn't wait for it to chill.  Sooo very good.  Mine cracked so you may want to follow the directions of those whose didn't crack.  Will definitely make again.

This was my first time making a cheese cake and was soooo happy to have tried this recipe. It was wonderful and every one that tasted it loved it. I followed all of the steps and as I read in other reviews used the pan with water. In order to prevent cracking. I made an easy heavy whipping cream with sugar and vanilla extract whip cream to top it off with and some fresh strawberries and it was a hit. I have passed this recipe along to several friends and I intend to make it at least once a month. WONDERFUL!!!

I did a couple of things differently but I think they only added to the amazingness of the CC. 
1 I omitted the flour
2 I added 3 tb of lemon juice and add my cornstarch to this to add to the cake
3 i made a crust that was like a thin cake (gingersnaps, melted butter, water, and 1egg) baked till set and then cranked the oven to 425. 
4 added a large baking dish filled with water to my lowest rack
 5 baked cheese cake on sheet pan on the middle rack

6 lowered temp to 350 once i put the cake in
7 baked 1 hour and w door shut left for 3 hours.
8 refridged for over night
9 enjoyed the next day pulling it from the fridge about 30 min before service.

10 IT WAS AMAZING.

First time making a cheesecake...took it as a dessert to a friends house after an Italian meal.  It was so good, added some blueberries and strawberries on top and it was perfect!  Thanks!

Giving this 5 stars, because the TASTE is PHENOMINAL! And I WILL be making this again! The question for me - because I'm not a baker - is...I live 7000 ft above sea level. How do I modify it to be more solid? Did it in a water bath at 350 for an hour, turned off oven and let'r stay there for 2 hrs. Thinking I could cut back on the sour cream, maybe do a tad more flour and/or corn starch...cook it for 30 minutes more...Any hints would be helpful. Regardless, although it was a tad mushy, the TASTE sold me, and I will figure out how to make it perfect next time. Added defrosted frozen blueberries....YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!

This is a great recipe for a delicious cake..very easy. I have made it at least ten times and it came out perfect every time except the first. The cooking time needs to be longer by twenty minutes, then one hour with the oven off but door closed. Also, I add a Graham cracker crust and it makes it even more yummy! Everyone loves it!

Followed the recipe to the tee and with a few hints from other reviewers it turned out beautiful and with no cracks. Made a nice blackberry sauce to serve with it. Just wonderful.

So great! I didnt have a springform pan, so I used non stick spray on a large pyrex pan, worked just as well. Added confectioner's sugar and sliced strawberries and I made sure to refrigerate for 6 hrs before serving. Delicious!

WOW.  This was...I mean, WOW.  Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this fantastic recipe!  I know how it is to have a recipe you want all to yourself, so thanks again for sharing it.  :)  Drained the ricotta with cheesecloth for an hour before adding, and since I was out of lemon juice, I added dried lemon peel I had on hand.  If you're having trouble with the cheesecake cracking, fill a pan with water, and place it under the cheesecake to let it steam with the cake.  DO NOT OPEN OVEN until AFTER the 2 hours.  It's important to keep the temperature constant.

This is a beautiful and delicious cheesecake. I like to make it with a cinnamon graham cracker crust. Friends at work loved it so much, and I've sold this cheesecake to 3 different people. Many praises for this recipe!

It wasn't pretty, but it tasted darn good!  Followed the recipe exactly and did water bath and it still cracked, but that doesn't matter because it was the best cheesecake ever!  Served with cherry pie filling and cool whip and got lots of compliments.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Very smooth and creamy, almost identical to the cheesecake recipe I always make only with Cottage Cheese instead of Ricotta and 1/3 cup of corn starch instead of corn starch and flour.  Delicious!

This cheesecake was delicious...I used natural Greek yoghurt instead of sour cream...because I had it on hand..I also goofed the time, and misread the Celsius temp, so had on low for 1/2 hour and then went to where it was suppose to be for another hour.  All worked out perfectly.  I did wrap the springform tin with 3 layers of foil, and poured in hot water while cheesecake in the oven...Great idea...I am originally from NYS, so taste made me homesick...Now live in Australia...So glad I made it...Had 4 people over for dinner and they all loved it!!!  Thank you...

The quickest cheesecake to put together not counting the oven and chill time. Even with the water bowl inside the oven, large cracks developed on top of the cheesecake but can easily be covered up with toppings. Superb texture and flavor with mediocre appearance.

I think this is in the top 3 cheesecakes I've ever made.  Follwed directions to a t (altough water bath is needed to prevent cracks), and it came out perfect.  Great flavor and texture.

I thought this cheesecake was outstanding. I made it as written and left it in the oven for 1.5 hrs after baking. I did get three really large cracks on the top (I did waterbath) but I covered it up with a thin layer of homemeade whipped cream and pecan bits. I also made a Mixed Berry Sauce for the top, it was awesome. Thanks for the great recipe.

As usual I followed the recipe to a 'T' and got rave reviews.  I am not fond of the ricotta cheesecake, but those who love the New Yok style that I bake, preferred this.  So, it looks like I have a new favorite cheesecake recipe.  Thanks.

Absolutely wonderful. I followed the directions exactly, but it was too runny. This was probably due to my oven, so I put it from refrigerator to oven for another hour. It came out fantastic!!

Made this for my husband and he gave it a thumbs up. Since I'm dieting, I did not taste it but my husband said it was very light and not like the usual heavy cheesecake. I did use graham crumbs to make a crust on the bottom and sides. It's a very simple and easy recipe to make and one to be used in our house again, again and again.

I didn't like the texture of this cheesecake. Maybe I did something wrong. It also had 4 giant cracks in the top. How do you prevent that from happening?

This is the first cheesecake that I have ever made.  Wow!  It was easy to put together and bake. And the flavor is outstanding.  Everyone absolutely loved it and I got many compliments on it. For the cake itself, I followed the recipe exactly.  However, my spring form pan has a slight gap in it so I made a graham cracker crust to put the filling in.  Delicious!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, I know I will be making this many,many times.

It overflowed my springform pan during baking. Should have used my taller 3-1/2" springform instead of my  shorter 2-3/4" springform. It's in the refrigerator now. Will taste tomorrow.

Very tasty! I used a shortbread cookie crust that complimented the cake perfectly. Water bath method recommended to avoid cracks!

Love this cheese cake. It's light, it's easy to make, it doesn't take a ton of ingredients, and it taste wonderful. I usually make a fruit topping, but next I'm going to try a lemon custard type topping. I'm still working on getting the bake time down right since the one hour called for doesn't fully bake it in my oven. First time I baked it just as the recipe calls for, one hr bake time, then turn off oven and leave in oven for another oven without opening the oven door. Problem with that is, if it's under cooked, you don't know until after that second hour. So, start early in the day in case you have to reheat the oven, bake an additional 20 to 30 mins, leave again for another hour, then wait for it to cool before putting it in the fridge. That is unless someone can say, with confidence, that you don't need that extra hour in the oven the second time around. Putting in some extra effort to prefect the timing on this one is well worth it. The taste and texture is to die for!

This is the best cheesecake! So simple to make and with a topping of fruit, sensational!  I used golden kiwis and everyone loved it.  Made it twice now, second time with peaches.  I used a 10x 3 spring-orm pan.  It rose well.

I will make this again!  Made a substitution. I used Philly cream cheese SPREAD instead of the "bricks."  It worked but made more batter  than I expected - we ate every bit of it!  Don't over bake.

Super creamy & light in texture! I added 3 packages of cream cheese  along with the ricotta and sour cream plus a bit of lemon zest.  I also added a graham cracker crust. I'm giving it 4 stars because of the bake time/temperature. Cracks all over the place,  but excellent in the creamy texture and light lemon flavor.  No.topping needed. Yum!

I can’t believe I found this recipe on all recipes! My grandmothers been making this cheesecake since she cut it out of the New York Times in the 1920s. This is by far the best cheesecake. The only thing she did differently was that she added the ingredients one at a time in a specific order and beat it way longer than you think you would need to this turned into a really light cheesecake.

My family has made this for years. Just a few different things we do.... All ingredients are at room temp! We add the eggs last and don't over mix. Over mixing can cause cracks. We then place it on a baking sheet filled with water. After baking for one hour, we turn the oven off and  crack the oven open laying a towel over the open oven door. We leave in for minimum of  1 hr.   Then place on cooling rack for hr,  then in the fridge for 4 hrs. Though, who really cares about cracks...its just an excuse to add strawberries, blueberries, cherries etc. Lol!  This has always been a hit wherever we take it.

This was fantastic! I read the other reviews and did use the water-bath under the cake pan.  Did the lower temp too as suggested by many to 325 and found after the 1st hour was up the cake had not even tanned one bit so I turned heat to 350 and gave it 10 more min. then shut off and let stay in another hour.  No cracks in my cake either, do not open the oven to check on it at anytime.  That may solve folks with their cake cracking.  FOLLOW the recipe don't substitute for cheaper, less fat etc.  ingredients , make sure cheeses and eggs are a room temp before you start. 
I will make this again and again!

1st time followed exactly. I make different cheesecakes about once a month but had never tried ricotta.
I could taste the flour & cornstarch. 
Also it cracked even with a water bath. Thats bc of overbeating the eggs.
So 2nd time.
I replaced the sour cream with greek yogurt. Replaced butter with heavy cream. No flour or cornstarch usex 3 whole eggs 2 egg yolks. And half confectioners sugar half white sugar.
Add eggs last. Ive baked a cheesecake in a 350°F oven for 1 hour no water bath & if i add the eggs last it doesnt crack.

This was exactly the texture of cheesecake that I wanted. Light and fluffy, but maintains the perfect amount of richness. Tastes amazing alone or with the additional of fruit on top.

A good, basic recipe that works wonderfully with any topping or none at all.  I thought the temperature would be too high and create cracks, so I baked it at 425 for 10 minutes and then knocked it down to 225 until done.  No cracks!

Followed the directions exactly, except: Wrapped outside of pan with foil. Put 9x13 pan of hot water on rack underneath cake. Cooled in oven 3 hours. Did not crack.  So easy and so very delicious!  Will make it again soon!

Made it!! Tasted amazing, developed a giant crack in the middle, followed the instructions with the exception of adding strawberries. This is my very first cheesecake but I'm pretty clueless how to fix it but I will continue to experiment.

I'm new at scratch cheesecake, but I had ricotta leftover and didn't want it to go bad so a search brought me to this recipe. I read all the reviews to get extra tips and added my own flare. Best cheesecake ever! I used vanilla bean paste, as it's the only way to go. I didn't have lemon so I used the zest and juice of a whole orange. I used chocolate Graham cracker crust as that's all I had in the cupboard. (orange and chocolate are a wonderful pair). I did a water bath on 325° for 70 minutes, left in in the oven for 2.5 hours, cooled on counter 1 hour and refrigerator over night. The orange flavor is amazing, and I didn't think I would like the chocolate crust, but it's wonderful with orange creaminess of this magnificent cheesecake. High five

It came out great! And was my first attempt at a cheesecake EVER. I followed the suggestions posted by Dawn as well, as far as temps, times, and the water bath. Not one crack and nothing but compliments! About to make it for a second time now.

needed to use waterbath, first one was ugly and cracked, used waterbath on second attempt, turned out prettier, tasted the same. Did notice that if i aged it in the ice box for 3 days it really brought the flavor out.

I’m half Italian, and always wanted to try making a ricotta cheesecake. This one tastes just like my grandmothers.
It was a big hit. Everyone loved it.
Very easy to make, I didn’t change anything.
I will be making it again in a month!
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It was too much batter for the 9" springform pan. I ended up using the 9" springform and two 6" cakepans, (I lined the bottom of them with parchment paper) and baked in a waterbath. But it was sooo good! I will make this again. I gave away the 6" cakes to two different neighbors, and they really enjoyed them.

Fantastic cheesecake - made as directed.  The dry texture from the ricotta and cream cheese is perfect.  Much better than the New York creamy style IMHO.  I did use a cookie sheet with a few ounces of  water and it came out with no cracks.

This recipe was easier than my go-to recipe. I needed a recipe that could convert to keto friendly which I did with Konjac gum for the cornstarch, artificial sugar, and almond flour (used conversion charts online). Tasted delicious! My attempt at a keto crust was a fail though, so next time will make this crustless. I used parchment paper underneath to help lift from my springform pan. Thanks for the awesome recipe. Next time I'm going to make as written for me and my hubby (but I already know it will be fantastic!!).

Just made this for my sisters birthday.  We’ve had NY cheesecakes and she was longing for one! This was perfect! The ricotta was the perfect addition.  Only change I made was adding a graham cracker crust and used a water bath when cooking. No cracks - excellent texture and not too sweet.  Added a macerated strawberry top.  Will make again.

Looks good, but I hate to be a "Debbie Downer" here, Italians don't use cream cheese in cheesecakes. They don't have cream cheese because it was invented in the U.S.

Just made this. Loved by all. This is not your dense NY cheesecake. It has a lovely light and creamy texture. Comes out picture perfect no cracks. Serve with  sliced strawberries, blueberries , etc for an absolute elegant desert. We are a gluten free house so I eliminated the flour and increased cornstarch to 4 tablespoons. Thank you for this great recipe!

I have been looking for a good recipe for this delicious cake for years.  My Aunt bakes every Italian cookie and dessert there ever was, but although my Dad offered to put her in business, but she refused.  I loved baking.  My mother tried it once and that was enough for her.  Why didn’t they put me with my Aunt to learn the Art of Italian baking, I have no idea.  I regret it especially now that I’m older!  This cake is a wonderful addition to my favorite Italian recipes.  Thank you so much for sharing it!

Made exactly to recipe and it turned out well. Typical heavy cheesecake, but less sweet and a more grainy texture. Everyone loved it except me.

Adjusted on the site to cut the recipe in half.   Used half stevia  and half sugar combination due to diabetes.  Cut back on baking time as suggested on the stevia package.  


Baked in an aluminum pie dish.  Don't have a spring form pan.

Even with all of these adjustments the cheesecake turned out great, moist and tasty.  

Thanks to April Caudle who shared the recipe I now have a cheesecake recipe  I can fall back on for special occasions.

Even baking only half the recipe gave us enough for several days.  wonder if this cheesecake can be frozen?

It was easy to make and so good. I noticed in pictures that others had a problem with cracking. I read that using the mixer makes air bubbles. Next time I will only use the mixer when blending the cheeses, and then mix the rest in of the ingredients in with a spoon.

The absolute best, Italian or otherwise, that I have ever eaten in my seventy-two years! First time ever making ANY cheesecake and it was perfection, and so easy. I did put a 13" x 9" pan half-filled with water on the bottom shelf. There is no doubt in my mind that whenever church functions call for desserts, this will be my contribution. Company coming? This will be dessert. I just can't rave enough about it. Thank you!

After reading some of the other comments I decided to add water to the bottom of the pan. Other than that I stayed true to the recipe. I baked for one hour, then let it sit in the oven for three hours. Even after adding the water to the pan it still cracked in the center. When I took it out of the oven it was still a little jiggly in the center. I put it in the fridge for 14 hours. After removing it was still very moist in the center. I will definitely try this cheesecake again. Although I didn’t feel it was sweet enough, I think next time I would cut the sour cream in half and add more cream or ricotta cheese. To help with the liquid center I will try some of what the other commenters have said to figure it out.

Made this twice now - it’s easy to make and the finished product is restaurant quality!!! I topped with a blueberry/raspberry reduction and it was incredible. The cheesecake is flavourful and not overly sweet

My first time making American Italian cheese cake ?? I made regular cheese cake before but I ran into a lot problems, so I read everything very carefully and it came out beautifully I just wish it was a lil bit more sweeter and the top came  out reallly dark brown, so since I didn’t make a crust I just flipped it and it looked good. I wish we could post a pic to show are work I’m so proud of myself especially since I don’t cook and this was my first time  my next recipe is a savory one I’m so excited

I used the juice of  1/2 lemon and salted butter. That little bit of salt makes a big difference! I have made this cheesecake many times over the past 25 years ever since my mom found the recipe in the local newspaper. I have topped it with fresh fruit, whipped cream, sour cream, and different pie filling. I have also marbled it with raspberry preserves, added chocolate chips, and added canned pumpkin and spices (add an extra egg per one cup pumpkin). Easily the best cheesecake recipe ever!!!!

I had to use up my cream cheese and ricotta before it expired and found this recipe. I had everything on hand except for the sour cream so I decided to improvise (even tho the recipe suggests not to). I only had "Oikos Grapefruit swirl" (limited edition) greek yogurt on hand so I used that. I also added about 5 extra tbsp of cream cheese to make up for not having enough yogurt or ricotta. I also added 2 tsp of lemon zest. The texture is creamy, light and fluffy, however it did as another reader mentioned; it got a large crack in the middle after baked. It gives it a rustic look tho. It tastes really nice and light, not dense like new york, and the added citrus makes it refreshing. The greek yogurt worked well for me. I made a strawberry couli with a little grand marnier to go with it and this made it really easy to eat half the cake (in one night) lol. Very good!

Incredible texture!!!! My favorite  cheesecake recipe!!
Authentic Italian might not be the right the right name.
"Old Fashioned"  would be a better suited name!
Highly recommend this recipe.

I made this cheesecake twice now.
First time I made it with Low fat Ricotta, Low fat Sr. cream and 2 x 8 oz regl. Cream cheese because that is all I had.
I preheated the oven at 350 and baked it at 325 for 75 min. (with two 9x13 dishes with hot water in bottom of oven).
Than I let it cool for 3 hrs. in the oven. 
It had a nice big crack in the middle. With the ricotta and cream cheese it tasted really lumpy instead of light and fluffy. 
The second time I made it I replaced the cream cheese with Mascarpone cheese and cut the sugar to 1 cup.
I preheated at 400 and baked it at 325 for 1 hr (with the two water dishes underneath). 
Let it set in the oven for 3 hrs. again.
This time it was perfect - no crack. Making it more italian  with the mascarpone instead of the NY style cream cheese made it so much lighter and fluffier. Never using cream cheese again!!!!

Easy to understand and create! I used chèvre in place of cream cheese as trying to find uses for all the goats milk in the house. Family loved this recipe and I will definitely be making it again.

I followed suggestions from the reviews and lowered the baking temp to 325 for 1.5 hours. Used 6 drops of  vitality lemon essential oil instead of lemon juice. It was perfect. No cracks, great texture, great taste.  Topped with fresh strawberry sauce.

My husband made fresh ricotta. I think this is an excellent recipe, but the freshly made ricotta hit it out of the park. I made a crust using crushed Nilla wafers and butter. I added no fruit or toppings and it was still fantastic. Very light and fluffy. The lemon juice adds great flavor as well. resist messing with the recipe the first time.

Flavor is wonderful and mild with just a hint of citrus to it. I put a pan of water in the oven to help keep it from cracking. I also made a homemade blueberry sauce and a homemade blackberry sauce to go on top. It was a perfect addition to the slight lemon flavor!

This is the very first time I have ever attempted baking a cheesecake! I chose this recipe for the easiness of it, the reviews and pictures. It is an absolutely delicious cheesecake!! The only change in ingredients I made was using part skim ricotta cheese because I felt it would be too heavy using whole milk ricotta cheese. The sides came out a little over done but that just may be my oven so I'll have to figure that out! The consistency and sweetness is exactly how I wanted my cheesecake to be! I think placing parchment paper on the bottom of my spring form pan next time is a good suggestion I read in another review so I can slide the cheesecake onto a serving plate. My cheesecake didn't crack, I followed the instructions to the "t". I let it chill for 5 hours before serving and I'm sure it will be even more delicious tomorrow! I also want to find a recipe for a graham cracker crust to try next time as well! I'm going to experiment with a strawberry topping, but only to serve on the side, because it's perfect as is!! I can't wait to make this cheesecake again to share with my family and friends, I know it will be a huge hit!! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!

This is my go to recipe and have received requests for it !  I make a nilla wafer crust.   I substitute amaretto for the vanilla.  I cook down the raspberry preserves.  Put a layer in the middle and swirl raspberry jam hearts on top. Just drag a toothpick thru dollops.  Finish it off with powdered sugar just before serving.  Impressive. Thank you for sharing ??

Hello Folks!
 This was My first attempt at cheesecake.
I looked at many recipe's and landed on this one and I am glad  to have done so!.
I bought a pan and went to work following the recipe exactly and everything worked out FANTASTIC!
I love this so much more than many that I have tried because of the Ricotta.

this was actually easy to do.  it  came out great and everyone loved it.  I only had the band of the pan and couldn't find the bottom so i used a flat pan for the bottom and put in parchment paper first.  It leaked out a little but not a big deal.  I also made some fresh strawberry jam (recipe on all-recipes) to top it with.  Next time (with the right pan parts ...) i will try for the graham cracker crust.  this was a winner.  followed directions exactly.

Omg! Absolutely outstanding! Aside from a small crack in the top, my cheesecake turned out fantastic. It looked and tasted like a pro made it. I made a standard graham cracker crust before adding the cheesecake filling. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I got nervous when the cake started to rise 1/4” above the side of the pan but it stayed intact and shrunk back down to height of the pan once it cooled. Also, the center will be jiggly when the cheesecake is done baking and it will set once completely cooled. Thank u, April and your grandma for this awesome recipe! Definitely a keeper!

I made it as is, except instead of vanilla extract I substituted Fiori Di Sicilia which I get from King Arthur Flour company.  That added a nice hint of citrus and vanilla to take this over the top.  I used fresh ricotta from the deli, not the one you get it the refrigerator section.  I made it for Easter dinner, and my mother-in-law who is from Italy and is an excellent baker actually asked me for the recipe!  I served it with fresh strawberries, and a strawberry sauce I also found on this site, but it was fantastic without any toppings.

Followed recipe as written and cheesecake was good flavor but texture was too ricotta-y for us - plus big crack on top.   I recommend people follow the tips in other reviews and use a hot water bath, cook longer on a lower temp, and don't open - or only slightly crack open - the oven for 2 hours after baking which would have improved my outcome.

Overall my family preferred my old recipe so this is one and done for me!

The only cheesecake I will make from now on. Our family came for Easter today and just loved it.  I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and I also used low fat ricotta. It was wonderfully creamy and I made a mixture of berries cooked with a tablespoon of tapioca to use as a topping.

Made this with all ricotta and omg delish! First time I added powdered vanilla pudding but will probably skip it this time since I think it made the inside softer even though I baked it for a little while longer. Anyway, recipe made exactly as written is very good. This is actually my mother's recipe also except all ricotta, no cream cheese. Recommend.

Made this last weekend for the High School drama departments cast party and it was loved by all. I added a strawberry swirl into the batter and would most assuredly make this again. It has already been requested for next year.

Although this was a delish cheese cake, it was waaaay too much for a 9" spring form pan and didn't get done in the middle. I could only use half of the sour cream called for. I would use a 12" pan the next I bake it. It's my new "go to" cheese cake!

It was a texture issue for us. I guess we are used to a smoother creamier cake. The flavor was still amazing, but the texture was kind of sandy

This cheesecake is really good, and it’s best if you add some sort of fruit glaze (I did strawberry) on top since it’s not very sweet on it’s own.

The different blend of cheeses makes this cake  amazing. The texture alone gives it that extra over regular cheesecake and makes it stand out. I love that it has no crust so you get right to the creamy goodness bite after bite. This is my go to cheesecake from now on, absolutely wonderful.

However, I did end up with a nice star shaped crack. I’m attributing this to the fact that I may have over mixed the batter when adding the sour cream after adding the eggs. I baked at 325 for 90 minutes, but based on how even the cheesecake is tasting/texture is looking 24hours later, i don’t think it could’ve been the temperature. Theirs only one way to find out: MAKE MORE CHEESECAKE !!!

I made more than 30  times, Usually 3 at a time. I always get raves. People cant believe I made it and that its not store bought. I'm a guy what do you expect. I always keep three in the freezer just in case I'm need a desert to bring with to a party. I have topped it with several different  canned toppings Strawberry/rhubarb, Blueberry, Apple, peach and cherry. Never a complaint. Also works well with chocolate graham cracker crust.

I made this for the first time following the recipe exactly.  Very tasty although for some reason the edges rose higher than the middle so the top wasn't flat, but instead had a ridge on it. Still tasted great though!  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I also made a fresh strawberry topping for those that wanted it.

I made this cheesecake the day before Christmas to serve Christmas Day. The flavor was good but the texture was sort of grainy. Is this from something I did or has anyone else had that result?

I made this cheesecake, with the addition of 1 cup of Hershey's mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, for Christmas today. My family raved about this cheesecake. I will be making this again. 

Pro: Light, not too sweet aside of the chips, and utterly delicious. 

Con: A huge three-pronged crack appeared in the center of the cake. Another review mentioned temps might have been too high during cooking/cooling.

This is the best cheesecake I have ever had in my life! I even botched the recipe,  combining the ingredients in the wrong order and had to use an electric beater to get the lumps out and it was still THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER. I also followed a lot of reviewers' tips: I put a large pan of hot water on the shelf below the cheesecake which prevented it from forming a crack on top. I also let it sit in the oven (turned off!)  with the door shut for 2.5 hours after it finished baking; let it sit out on the counter to cool down and covered tightly with foil before putting it into the fridge overnight.  The longer you let it sit in the fridge, the better it tastes, so do make it ahead of time.

This is a great basic cheesecake recipe.  It is not Italian though.  My Great Aunt gave me the recipe a few years ago.  She got the recipe from the Women's Home Journal.  If you are looking for great tasting cheesecake, this is a very good recipe.  If you are looking for authentic Italian Cheesecake, I would look elsewhere.

Loved it! Did not change a thing. Was not as creamy as I expected and as the review indicated. I liked the density more. Definitely a keeper! I will have to cut the recipe in half since there is only two of us. It was huge!

I lowered the temperature to 325 degrees and cooked for one hour then left in the oven for 2 hours.  It is a good cheesecake but lacks the sour/sweet bite I particularly like in my cheesecakes.

I followed the recipe for the cheesecake exactly, but did add a basic graham cracker crust.  Love the complexity of the flavors from the  cream cheese, sour cream and ricotta (that's ree-co-ta not rick-a-ta ;) ).  Add some berries on top and buonissima!!!!

This is my second time making it. The first time the top cracked (thank goodness for blueberry pie filling- it hid the 'scars'), this time SUCCESS! I think the secret is to not over beat the mix when adding the eggs. I beat the eggs lightly with a fork before adding to the mix, then minimum beating when adding the sour cream. Wrapping the bottom of the pan in foil and baking in a water bath also minimizes cracking. We love this cake!

This is a awesome recipe, I did make changes to it to make it even better. 1) take out all your ingredients Cream cheese, ricotta, eggs sour cream and let let come to room temp. first before mixing, this helps with the moisture and cracking. I did add 1 TSP lemon zest to batter to give it a little more flavor. Cover your pan with foil and put in oven 325 degrees and water bath it ( place your springform pan in a larger pan with about  3 cups boiling water, ( prevents cracking and keeps moist) bake 1:45 minutes. open door make sure its almost cook. it should jiggle a bit. Turn off oven sit for 3 hours DO NOT open door. Than I let it sit on the counter for 2 hours and than put in fridg, for next day. I used Red red Raspberry pie filling to top it with, and Whipped cream, Will  make again Awesome

This is probably the best & easiest cheesecake recipe I've found. I've made it twice and find that is very forgiving if you don't have the exact amounts for your ingredients. The first one I made I had 1 full fat & 1 low fat cream cheese & only had 1/2 the amount of sour cream called for and it turned out fine. The 2nd cake started out quite liquid-y (extra large eggs & poured quite a bit too much lemon juice!) so I added an extra tbsp. of cornstarch...again, great cheesecake! They did crack both times despite pans of water in the oven for the 2nd cake. Doesn't matter...just top with fruit topping or dulce de leche :)

made it exactly to the recipe at 1000'  and it sucked . i think my oven maay have been a few degrees too hot or 350 is too much for an hour cooking then an hour cooling in the oven. I aborted after about 20 mins of oven cooling because i could see it drying out.  Im guessing that caused it to fall down a bit . it was spongy and kind of doughy, however looked exactly like the picture i terms of texture . I felt it had too little sugar and was very bland taste like semi sweet rogotta and eggs . had no cheesy ring to it at all kinda reminded me of tofu .My girlfriend who loves cheesescake threw it back in my face (so to speak)  Ill try it again but thiis time Im going with my modifications   stand by ..for greatness

I've made this twice and we have thoroughly enjoyed.  I increased the vanilla to 1 Tbsp. and added the zest of 1 lemon.  I think the butter could safely (without adversely affecting recipe) be decreased to 1/4 C. or perhaps 1/4 C. plus 2 Tbsp.
I make this recommendation based on having butter ooze out of the bottom of my pan while the cheesecake was cooking.

For those of you who might have difficulty with cracking, etc. just a suggestion about baking. I never use a spring form pan. I use a deep or even normal sized cake pan (9" round cake pan halve the recipe). When you halve the recipe you do not halve the baking time you bake for about 70-75% of the time called for in the recipe. I prep the pan with a very thin coating of shortening followed by a dusting of flour. I preheat the oven and fill a baking dish or pan with warm water.  When the oven is ready, I put the cake pan into the warm water bath and bake in the water bath. After the initial cooking time is over (for me, in this case, I baked the cake for 45mins. Then, I turned the oven off and let the cake remain in the oven, in the water bath, for 35 mins. This , and other baked cheesecakes, are basically custards. If you are concerned it may become cracked, browned, etc. check at about 10 mins before end of baking time and see if it is firm around the outside and jiggles just in the middle. If so, turn of oven and leave cake in for  another hour. When removing from the pan just dip pan into a little warm water to loosen the cheesecake.

Made this  Ricotta Cheesecake for Easter.  Was definitely not sweet enough.  I covered the top with fresh blackberries and confectioners sugar, but very bland.  Either put a sweet compote on top or double the sugar amount.  Will try again with these changes.

Best cheese ever!  Took it to work and got rave review from all.  It's the light cheese cake I have been searching for.  Followed the recipes exactly turn out great, except for the fact that it cracked in the middle.

The cake tasted great and looked fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the center of mine did not set.  I will increase oven time the next time I make it.

I loved this.  The texture is much like a New York Cheesecake, but a little creamier.  I liked the fact that I could mix everything into one bowl.  I count carbs and so I also liked that there was no crust.  I would add to the directions that you need a large spring form pan.  This is a big cheesecake.  I am going to make the next one with a sugar substitute to see how that goes.  But, this recipe is great!  Mine did get a big crack when cooling it, but that is easily fixed with a water bath.  So, next time I will bake it with a water bath.

Used a 9" pan, and the centre was mushy when I cut it.  The taste was wonderful though!  I will try it again though, with some of the changes that I've read that other people did.

I've made this Cheesecake 3 times now.  
I followed the recipe exactly - and I made it in the "EzyCook" bench top cooker.  Because it has a glass bowl, I can see what's happening inside, without lifting the lid.  I let it cool completely before removing. 
  I've never had it crack, it's always perfect.
I also wrap it in foil, and freeze it for when I'm expecting visitors.
It freezes without any problems.
I love this Cheesecake, - and so do my guests. ?

Excellent!! Followed the ingredients just at they are - everything at room temp.  Loved that this did not have a crust.  I also used as a topping the Supreme Strawberry Topping recipe on this site.  I did end up with a crack in the top but did not care.  It still tasted great.  We live in Europe so my oven only need 45 minutes to bake. I left in turned off oven for another two hours, then set on counter for another hour.  Left in refrigerator overnight.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Woah. This is the exact same recipe I have been making cheesecakes with for 10+ years. That's freaky. Mine is a family recipe too. Important notes to this recipe 1.)use a water bath 2.) make sure the cheese and eggs are at room temp, and do not over beat the eggs.... After doing some research on the science behind cheesecakes I have also found you should never bake your cheesecake at a temperature above 325F. I bake my cakes at 300-315 for 1 hr 20 mins, then turn the oven off (DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR). If your oven is ancient like mine  (and leaks hot air), turn the temp down to 200F for half an hour, and then to warm for another half hour. Taking these steps will prevent cracks and give the cheesecake a creamier texture.

It's important to read up on the science behind cheesecakes. You don't want the eggs to over coagulate, and there are multiple steps one must take to prevent it.

I was doing an Italian-themed meal; I thought this looked different.  I always read the reviews as I have found the advice to be excellent.  I had been having issues with my oven; still haven't figured out what is wrong--but I decided not to bother with the advice and just make it.  I figured if it didn't work out, I'd just serve it in glasses layered with fruit.  It turned out perfectly.  There was no crack at all.  I followed the directions exactly.  My Too Much Chocolate Cake wasn't baking properly at all--but this recipe was fabulous.  I'm not a dessert lover, but I LOVED this as did my guests.  Go figure--?

I made this recipe and used Neufchatel cheese and really enjoyed the flavor. We used a water bath and started at 475* for 10 minutes and reduced to 200* for an hour, then left in the oven for 3 hours while turned off.  This was delicious. Next time I will try the heavier Mascarpone!

This has to be the best cheesecake I've made!.  I needed it to be gluten free so I substituted GF flour and had a little trouble mixing it in.  I baked it in a $3 silicone baking dish that sat on a metal pan.  No water bath, no cracks.  It was perfect.

Very nice! Made it for the first time. took some suggestions and preheated to 350 then dropped to 325 when I put it in. Also used a dish of water below the cake on the bottom rack.

Used a 9'' pan which was a bit too small for all the batter, I am kind of a newbie so I put it all in anyway and the cake grew about an inch over the rim of the pan and during the 1hour oven cooling I think this is what caused a giant crack that was about 1'' deep in the center.

a bit embarrassed by it I had the idea to flip the cake upside down on the serving dish after it cooled and wahlaa, it looked perfect and everybody just loved the texture, I used lowfat ricotta cheese and I can't compare it nor will I ever because it was great and I'm going to use it again.

(EDITED MONTHS LATER) After about 20 perfect cheesecakes under my belt now, no longer a newbie. Have made this successful many more times. A real waterbath made a huge difference. Love the texture of this cake, one of my 3 go-to  cheesecake recipes and the others I've created myself. This recipe is forever my in my arsenal because the other ones I make are distinct and this one is versatile. I normally go with a Nutella ganache to top if off with. I use a 9'' with this cake, waterbath = less rise.

I usually do not rate things but I've made this three times and it is perfect. Not to sugary texture is right. I will keep making this recipe when we want cheesecake. I bought pre made Graham cracker crusts to put it in and also tried spring pan.

Followed directions using a spring form pan. I did however make it on top of a graham cracker crust because why not? Soo delicious. It did take quite some time to cool enough (1 hr) before I put it in the fridge. I forgot to add a water bath to the oven so the top did crack but didn't change the taste! Definitely will be making this again.

Excellent! I halved the recipe and used the three mini-springform pans that I just purchased (they're great!). In addition, I also got two mini-loaf pans out of the half-recipe. I followed top reviewer Dan le Chef's tips for cooking the cakes, and that worked great. (I still got small cracks in the mini-springform pans, but that didn't bother me.) I made the Graham Cracker Crust I and used it with all but one loaf pan here to see how it worked; with or without crust, it was still very good! Very high quality cheesecake which reminds me of something you would get in a great bakery. Had some topped with cherry pie filling...yum!  Thanks April....great recipe!

This is wonderful and I don't even like cheesecake (made if for cheesecake loving company and then tried it myself). 

I didn't realize how important the refrigeration part was but don't skip on like the 4 hours in the fridge (at least). It needs that time in the cool air to set up. Just sitting in the cooling oven for an hour will not be enough, mine almost fell apart (a small chunk did come out). 

This was delicious by itself but I added a raspberry drizzle (couldn't find one on this site sadly) and it was heavenly. 

Will make again!

I thought I was taking a chance making this the first time for Xmas dinner, but it was a complete hit. Everyone loved it including me. Some cheese cakes are so complicated, this one is so easy.

Wonderful and delicious cheesecake.  I made it for Christmas dessert but.prepared it 2 days in advance to make sure it turned out ok.  My only problem is that it developed multiple huge cracks even though I also put a dish of water in the oven as well.  It wasn't exactly aesthetically pleasing but it tasted so good, I didn't care!  
The flavor and texture was a perfect balance of being both rich and nice and fluffy, and it wasn't as heavy as a traditional  cream cheese only based cheesecake.
The only change I will make in the future is to play with the cooking temp to better suit my oven and possibly make a crust out of crushed shortbread cookies.

I loved it!  I decided to make it into cupcake sized pieces instead because it is so rich and people often cannot finish a whole piece.  I think it takes longer than 15 minutes to prep and I would allow more like 30.  I also added a graham cracker crust to the bottom. 1 and 1/2 cups graham crackers, 1/3 cup sugar, 6 tablespoons butter.  It does not need to cook for 1 hour and depending on the size of the tins, I would recommend 30 to 45 minutes.  Shut off the oven and leave them in the oven and do not touch for a few hours.  Chill thoroughly.  These pieces can be easily frozen and then pulled out for many wonderful treats during the month.  Leave them plain and cover with fruit once they are thawed.

Thank you for posting this. !!!
I was given this recipe 25 years ago from a former co worker. She was an older woman and as Italian as you can get!!  
 I only make it once or twice a year (Always for Christmas ) I did not make it this year because I have misplaced the recipe. I knew what went in it but was not 100 percent certain of the specifics (how much of each ingredient/ cooking temp and time )I could have guessed from memory but decided against it. 
Everyone was so disappointed when I did not make it this year so I decided to see if I could find one close on line.  I am sure this is the exact same recipe!!!  It is wonderful all by itself I do not bother using a topping and and everyone raves over it. My son will be so happy when I surprise him with one.  Thank you

Made this delicious cheesecake for a dinner party.  I used the ingredients as stated per Dan le Chef.  I baked at 325 for 1.5 hrs. Way too long as I received a huge crack for my efforts.  I was worried it was too "jiggly" at 1 hr (note to self). Next time I'll try to curb my instinct. Lol. I did leave it in the oven for 2.5 hrs to cool then another 2 hrs on the counter.   I hid the crack by covering with berry preserves diluted with orange juice to a spreadable consistency, topped with blueberries then drizzled with white chocolate. It look gorgeous and tasted incredible. Will definitely make again.

I wanted to make/try to an Italian Cheesecake since my grandma is from Sicily. I made it following everything just as it is. I, my husband, 6yr old son, and co-workers LOVED IT!  I/we love that it isn't really rich like a New York Cheesecake, which is good too, but it is creamier, and lighter. I will be making it for Thanksgiving desert. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is just what I've been looking for! I was told years ago that "true" NY style cheesecake is "baked", without a graham cracker or cookie crust. I have eaten this baked cheescake many times, and IMHO, it's the best!

This recipe is awesome. It is soooooo easy to make. I did however lower the calorie content by using half sugar and half Splenda . I also used reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat cream cheese.

I made this recipe as written (besides the addition of a water bath) and was not thrilled. I guess it's just personal preference, but I did not like the ricotta texture of the cake. I will stick with Chantal's New York Cheesecake from this site.

This recipe was awesome.  I tried it for Christmas and it was a hit.  I actually made little individual cheesecakes in a muffin tin and used a graham cracker crust.  It was amazing and I got lots of compliments on it.

It's definitely the best cheesecake I've ever made.  The only reason it's a 4 instead of a 5 is that it ended up being a little dry and it had a fairly decent crack in the top of it.  I'm pretty sure there are ways to avoid that, I just don't know what they are yet. Overall, it tastes fantastic and with some chocolate covered strawberries and whipped cream topping, I think I can cover up the crack.

This was incredible! Not too sweet and the consistency was perfect- I added a graham cracker crust and deleted the lemon juice.  Other than that- followed it to the letter.  I will make this again!

Very good! Everyone liked it so much. I used reduce fat sour cream & it turned out just great. I also water-bathed it when baking & left it in the oven for another hour. Thank you so much for sharing such great recipe.

This one is just like the one my German mama used to make!  Fantastic to find it.  She used to add golden raisens to the mix - but she'd make me one plain just like this if I begged!  My husband loved it and the whole 9" cake was gone between the 2 of us in 2 days - oh my.  The little bit of texture from the ricotta makes it for me!  ;)

I made this in the morning for dinner that night, first piece that night I was not impressed. Then the following night I decided to try it again and found in delicious, day 3...ever better. I was worried when I tasted the batter becuase it tasted very flour-y and when it came out of the oven, it had a HUGE crack. I followed the directions exactly, so next time I will try a different cooking method. I'm going to try to make it again and see what happens.
