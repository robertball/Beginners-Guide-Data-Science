I followed the directions but added a chopped carrot for extra color and flavour. Delicious! My family loved it. Great for that evening when the ingredients were just what I had on hand and we were in the mood for warm soup. I will be making this again.

Where did the cabbage go?  I followed the directions exactly and used my Instant Pot. The result was a very thick, heavy but flavorful soup. The cabbage seemed to melt into a thick creamy sauce.

Great soup.  Used chicken stock and all whole milk.  Ended up natural releasing for about 10 min while I finished up something else, then did pressure release.  Thickened up quickly after adding flour.

Made this exactly according to the recipe, and I wouldn't change a thing! It was absolutely delicious, both my wife and I loved it.  Creamy, a little thick, just the right kick from a combination of the sausage and the black pepper. Mmmmm........

I did not use an instant pot, just on the stove.   I used More broth, probably 4 cups, more potatoes and more cabbage but the left the milk & 1/2 the same.  I also didn't have sausage as I wanted to use turkey sausage and couldn't find it.  I used ground turkey and used a seasoning recipe from Allrecipes for the 'mock' sausage flavor.  We loved it.  I will make it again.

Great meal for a cool evening. Made it on the stovetop and eliminated the Allspice. Took about 15 minutes longer,  so still pretty quick.

SO delicious!    I added chopped  ginger root (about a teaspoon) just for  good measure and it turned out fabulous.    My hubby is  still raving and wants another batch!    Will double next time.   Used my slow cooker.

We loved it.  Made a nice change from other soups. I made it gluten and milk free by using almond milk and corn starch to thicken it.

Only change I made was to use a pound of little creamer potatoes, chopped, instead of the russet potato.   Simple to make.  Took me a bit longer as I had to figure out how to use our seldom used pressure cooker.    :)    

Great on a cold gray wintery day.
