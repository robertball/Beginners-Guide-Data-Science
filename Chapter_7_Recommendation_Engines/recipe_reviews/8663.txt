We added some peppers, extra fresh mushrooms, diced up 1\2 an onion and used leftover chicken instead of a whole one. The flavour was good, add some corn or brocolli and use white and wild rice instead. Also  we were unsure of whether it should be 1 cup rice before or after cooking. Definately 1 cup (or a little more) before cooking. This recipe has a ton of potential. We are looking forward to making it again.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this casserole. It's a keeper. I used fresh mushrooms and it was great, think I might try adding broccoli to make a complete meal.

This recipe was great. My family really enjoyed it. Next time I would cook boneless chicken breast instead of whole chicken. Would save a bit of time.

This was great!  We used fresh mushrooms and did 1 cup cheddar 1 cup monterey jack.  Also added some frozen broccoli.  This is the chicken and rice recipe we will be using from now on.  Thanks so much for sharing! I've been searching for a good chicken rice recipe...

Gosh – where do I start?  This recipe was FANTASTIC – but also was VERY economical – with a couple of ideas!  I used a package of raw chicken tenders (about 10 to a package) instead of a whole chicken.  I boiled those with celery, onion, garlic, and a lot of different spices in a big pot of water.  To help with the budget – I used only 5 of the chicken tenders once cooked and used 2 cups of cooked rice.  I also added some of the strained veggies from my stock to add texture and color.  I used only half of the cheese sauce and topped with crushed buttery crackers.  Came out great – good comfort food – good food for a snowy day!  The economical part – I used the rest of the stock, veggies,  tenders, in addition to a small bag of frozen stew veggies, and a little “soup” pasta  to make a fabulous chicken soup!  I added a tiny bit more milk to the leftover cheese sauce (and spices) to add to a little bit of leftover pasta and veggies that were in the fridge to make a nice lunch!  I could have also made creamed peas with the rest of the cheese sauce too – but had to use the other leftovers first!  So – I highly recommend this recipe – it can be stretched and if you keep the stock and veggies – you can get two plus meals out of one!!!!!!!!  Thanks a million!!!!!!!!!!!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Was a great way to use leftover turkey and a wild rice/quinoa blend I had.  Made as directed, but didn't have mushrooms so omitted and replaced with broccoli.

When making the cheese sauce, i just added some granulated garlic and onion as well as some sage plus salt and pepper.  Very tasty! Everyone really enjoyed.

Great.  I used leftover turkey, didn't add the cup of chicken broth (didn't have any) and I added frozen peas.  It turned out great and was a great way to use the leftover meat.  The sauce was super easy to make even with a toddler in the kitchen!

Great dinner to make for the family.  I always add broccoli for some extra greens.  Cheese sauce makes it more desirable for the kids!  Great all-around recipe!

I nixed the mushrooms and added in 1c broccoli & 1c califlower. The cheese sauce is fantastic too. I used BLSL chicken too, using the left over stock instead of buying it from the store. I also took the onions from the stock and pureed then added to the cheese mixture...a shame to waste them. Definitely add 1/2-1c more of rice though. It's a great "from scratch" recipe that I will make again.

This casserole came out fabulous for me.  I did make some changes based on other reviews.  First, I had leftover rice and chicken which I used for the casserole.  I used about two and a half cups of cooked rice and five small boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  The ingredients for the sauce seemed like it would make too much, so I cut those in half.  I didn't have any mushrooms on hand, but I did add about a cup and a half of frozen mixed veggies with the sauce, rice, and chicken.  I also seasoned it with garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper.  I baked the casserole for an extra ten minutes since I started out with mostly cold ingredients and wanted to make sure the veggies had time to cook.  Finally, I sprinkled a bit more shredded cheddar on top of the casserole.  My kids loved it, and I was thrilled to find a chicken and rice dish that didn't call for canned soups.  The sauce was really good, and we had a nice one-dish meal for dinner.  I will certainly make it again, but maybe with a bit more sauce (or less rice).

I bought a cooked rotisseri chicken at the grocery store and deboned that and diced it up instead of boiling my own chicken.  This recipe would have been perfect but I think I messed up the amount of rice.  I cooked the rice first and used 1 cup cooked rice as the reciped indicates, but that wasn't anywhere near enough rice.  As another person pointed out it would have to be 1 cup rice BEFORE cooking.  I had to bake it an extra 45mins with the lid off to get it to a 'casserole' consistency.   When it finally got thick enough it was delicious.   I just need to add way more rice next time.  I think the rotisseri chicken meat added great chichen flavor.  I mixed some of the drippings from that container into some plain chicken broth to flavor it up a bit as well.  I'll try this again sometime and try to get the amount of rice right.

Excellent recipe. Changes I made: used 1.5  cups chicken broth, 1.5 cups skim milk; Used fresh mushrooms; Added onion and celery from the broth to the final casserole mix; Used 1 cup cheese; Increased rice to 2 cups rice. The family loved it. We will make this again.

A good, stick to your ribs, family dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good.  The picky kids loved it.  I steamed broccoli for the side. Next time, I'll spice it up a bit for my family's taste, but it's VERY good as is.  Worth the time and leaves a nice chicken stock for soups and other recipes.

I liked this a lot! Comfort food at its best. We didn't have mushrooms, but I used fresh green beans and some frozen mixed veggies. It does need quite a bit salt and pepper. I could see myself taking this dish to new moms! It filled a 9 x 13 pan easily. This pregnant mama can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow!

This recipe is a great starting point for an easy casserole.  You can use whatever vegetables or cooked grains you have on hand which makes it very versatile.  Today I made it with quinoa and brown lentils instead of rice and blended mozzarella and cheddar cheese because I did not have enough of either.  On hand today was red pepper and peas and that is what found its way into the casserole.  It was delicious.  I highly recommend this to anyone!  The only reason this recipe is not a 5 star is because 8 tablespoons of flour for the roux was far too much.  But other then that, follow the recipe.

Although not bad, I thought it was a little bland. Definitely needs more spice than just salt/pepper. Next time I will definitely add some garlic powder and onion powder.

This recipes lays the foundation, but you need to get creative to make it work.  My 2 cents:  
1) 1 cup of rice is a bit much... I recommend 3/4.  This also fits much better in a 1.5 qt dish.  
2) 1/2 an onion was plenty.  
3) Saute some fresh mushrooms if you have them instead of canned.
4) I threw in a green bell pepper when boiling the chicken.
5) Celery didn't do much for flavor. Next time I'll use frozen broccoli.
6) Salt, pepper, garlic powder, etc. are definitely needed.
7) On a sidenote, I used 1 lb. of chicken breast, and it worked great.

Very good recipe, but I had to make a series of small changes due to what i had on hand.
I didn't have a whole chicken, so I cooked a large chicken breast and utilized 2 cups of cubed chicken. I sauteed the onion, carrot and celery with the chicken  and added it to the mix.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned ones. Next time I'm going to add 1/4 cup of white wine and see how that works out.

My grandkids love this. I make it quite often. But they like the chicken cubed and mixed the rice. It’s quick and simple. Serve wth some greens and biscuits. It’s a winner every time

I made this recipe because I had leftover cooked chicken and rice.  Even though I didn't have mushrooms this recipe was delicious!  Will add mushrooms in the future.  I would like to also try roasted red peppers in the future.

Was looking for a recipe to use up about 3 - 4 cups of cooked rice.  Reduced the flour to 3 tblsps and omitted the chicken stock (made a basic cheese sauce).  Sauteed celery, red and yellow peppers, onion, broccoli.  Mixed it all together and had it as a side dish with fish.  Very nice!

It was a great basic casserole. I did add some more spice, poultry seasoning and salt. Plus some veggies. Will definitely make it again.

Good recipe. I used fresh mushrooms and put the onions and celery from the boiled chicken into it as well. I also cut out the milk and used the stock from the boiled chicken for all the liquid.

I really liked the flavor. I used four large breasts and chopped them up. I saved the onion and celery from the chicken boil, and used it in the casserole as well. Instead of canned mushrooms, I used fresh. I also used Basmati rice for the flavor. I had to use a 3 qt dish to hold it all. Cooking time was increased 20 minutes.

I used the basic concept of this recipe but used leftover chicken breasts and leftover uncle ben's chicken flavored wild rice blend for the rice (rinsed to remove the extra seasonings).  Half this recipe was more than enough for my family of 4.  Since I had leftover chicken, I decided to keep the celery and onion and just sautéed them in some butter with salt and pepper until they were soft. I added the butter and flour to the onions and celery and just proceeded with the cheese sauce in the same pan, then added the chicken and rice.  I think either the rice ratio is a little off or my leftover rice "blend" with wild rice, white rice, and orzo, just didn't pick up the cheese sauce like straight rice would.  I would not double the rice, but maybe just add another 1/4 c each time until I got the right ratio.  I left out the mushrooms due to taste preference of my family.  I thought it looked a little boring without a topping so I crushed up some ritz crackers to add a topping.  This was really cheesy and delicious, a nice change from a canned cream soup based casserole.  It was so easy too!  It will go in the rotation AND I will tinker to make different casseroles with the same basic concept.  Update:  The leftovers were fine with the ratio of rice to sauce.  I bet it would have been dry with more rice.  If I add more rice, I would only add 1/4 c. TOTAL to avoid the leftovers being dry.

I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts. Cooked with fresh mushrooms,celery and onion. Added 2 bouillon chicken cubes and the 2 bay leaves to make the broth. Also added 1 clove of garlic and home made season salt to taste. Cooked about 20 minutes to make the celery soft, I have a family member who must have all vegetables well cooked or purried. Drained the broth and put the vegetables aside. Made 2 cups rice using the broth, then used the remaining broth about a cup and a half and a cup and a half of milk for the cheese sauce. Mixed in the vegetables and rice, sprinkled with bread crumbs. Came out great!

Loved it!. I added a tablespoon of Rosemary to give it a bit more flavor before I put it in the oven and I topped it with mozzarella cheese.  Came out great.

I've never had so many accolades from my family over a meal! This is really sooooo good. I added fresh spinach leaves (torn into sm. pieces). It distresses me GREATLY that I can never, ever cook it again, though b/c of the calories and fat!! Is that info accurate?
