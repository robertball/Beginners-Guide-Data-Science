We love these! I don't cook it the way the recipe states. I cook my meat, drain it, then season the meat with the taco seasoning and a little tomato sauce so it's not dry. Sometimes instead of black beans, I'll use refried beans instead of black beans and just spread it onto the crescent roll dough. This is also good with monterey jack or pepperjack cheese. I like to make a reduced fat sour cream/salsa mix "dip" to serve with. Reduced fat crescent rolls work just as well. NOTE: If you don't have crescent roll dough, you can use whomp biscuits instead. Just flour your counter a little and roll out the biscuit a bit, add your fillings on one half of the biscuit, fold over and seal the ends together with a fork (think crescent "pie") and brush with a little egg wash. Either way you make it, it's always a hit.

Everyone really enjoyed these burritos. Just love the flaky ness of the crescent roll. Gives the burrito a whole new look and taste. Gonna' have some fun thinking of other fillings for the Crescent wraps. Love em'.

I read all of the comments before I made these and was pessimistic, at best. We filled the crescents with homemade refried beans (Refried Beans Without The Refry on AR) and cheese, as we don't eat meat. The beans were seasoned enough that I didn't think adding taco seasoning would bring much to the final product, so I left it out. I am happy with the result -- a warm, filling, easy meal that all three of my kids enjoyed. A lot of comments said that a tortilla would have done the job just fine, but I would disagree. These are good because they're different. The crescent roll pocket makes them more of a novelty instead of the same 'ole thing.

This doesn't taste like a standard burrito, but I mean that in a good way.  The crescent roll dough gives you more of a buttery flavor, as opposed to what you'd get from a flour tortilla.  I browned the beef first, drained, and then added the beans and taco seasoning.  I was concerned that if all three were cooked together, I'd be draining the taco seasoning when I drained the ground beef mixture.  I used Taco Seasoning I as well as some frozen black beans from Black Beans 'N' Rice, both recipes from the AR site.  Served with sour cream and homemade pickled jalapenos.  We liked this and will be making it again.

I made these with the kids and we all agreed they were a little dry.  You could serve with salsa and that would help or even mix some salsa into the meat mixture.

I made these vegetarian for a friend coming over.  I just left out the beef.  Very tasty and she liked them, so it's nice to know I have something to go to when she comes to dinner.  I tried them and thought they were pretty dang tasty, too.  Very versatile recipe.

I love Pilsbury Crescent Rolls and I love burritos...just not together. This recipe isn't something my family cared for at all. The tecnical side of the recipe wasn't written very well either. It said to combine the cooked and drained meat, and the rinsed and drained beans with the taco seasoning mix and boil. There was nothing to boil... I did add a little bit of water so the taco seasoning would mix together with the meat and beans. Also, it was WAY too much work and use of the oven for the end result. I'd rather just put the mean/bean mixture in a tortilla, roll it up and eat it. I won't be making this again.

I used the FLAKY cresent rolls but I next time I'd used the regular ones. (they are great as rolls but a little greasy for this dish) This was tasty and quick! I had some taco shredded pork available and it works perfectly! These need to be eaten from the oven and great with salsa and sour cream!

While I found these lackluster, Mr. LTH said they were "good".  I prepared the ground beef/bean filling the night before (and I prepared according to the taco seasoning packet directions, using slightly less water than called for) so they made for a quick throw together meal the next day, but I wouldn't choose these over traditional tacos/burritos, so I'm not getting the selling point.  The crescent flavor is definately not a match for the taco flavor.  I can't foresee a reason I'd ever make these again.  They're ok, just not up our alley.

as others stated...a bit dry, so when I decided to this, I doubled the batch and added a 1/4 cup of water after adding the taco seasoning and cooked thoroughly before adding mixture to the crescent rolls. Then added a little extra cheese to each one. I only had 3 cans of Crescent Recipe Creations seamless dough. So I took a can of plain refrigerator biscuits and made little crescent muffins along the same lines. And with the added juice to the mixture made it help a little more. I can see some different plays on this recipe.

These are fantastic! The filling is delicious and hearty. I'm a huge fan of crescent rolls, so this recipe is on my go-to list! I served them at a game night, and our friends loved them!

Update: My husband requested these for his birthday party. That is a huge compliment!

I really liked this idea. The only thing I did different is that I used refried beans instead of black beans. This made the meat mixture really creamy and yummy.  It reminded me more of a meat pie, except that it is wrapped in burrito style and has the tex-mex flavorings. Nice snack or light lunch!

we loved this. I only had 1 package of crescent rolls and they were the flavored kind, so I used one of the french loaf rolls and just unrolled it. I cut it into 8 strips. Worked out well. I would like to try this with the crescent rolls (add the flaky) Also I read the reviews before and some said it was pretty dry so I added about 1/2 can of enchalada sauce. worked well. I also used a whole pack of taco seasoning to add some more flavor.

These were very easy to make!  Family devoured them in minutes!  I made them the night before since we wouldn't have time for me to prepare a meal the next day.  Reheated them in the oven and they were perfect!

I made this at a friend's house when I was playing nurse to her.  She and her husband both liked them but said that they felt that the crescents were too sweet for the dish...the sweetness didn't go with the beef and beans.  They did think the filling was pretty good.  I'd have to agree.  My husband didn't like these at all because of the crescents but he did say he'd like the filling if it was wrapped in a tortilla.

Yummy. These turned out really well with a few adjustments to fit our tastes. I halved the recipe, sauteed the beef with a clove of garlic, and added about 1/2 cup of salsa along with the beans and taco seasoning. As others have pointed out, there is nothing to bring to a boil if you make the recipe as written. The salsa remedied this and kept the burritos nice and moist on the inside. I served them with salsa, cilantro, and plain Greek yogurt. Thanks Pillsbury!!

My husband said it was "Really good," so there you go! I baked them with the dough in muffin tins, then spooned in cool beef/bean mix, added cheese, pinching the tops closed. More cheese on top, of course. Easy. Good.

These were ok for us.  My husband doesn't like black beans so I used refried beans instead.  I browned the ground beef, drained the fat and then added a bit of water and the taco seasoning.  I spread the refried beans on the crescent roll rectangle, then added the meat and cheese.  Hubby said he would have liked using tortillas instead since the rolls were a bit buttery!

Unfortunately, we did not care for these. First of all, it says to mix the cooked and drained ground beef, beans and taco seasoning in a pan and bring to a boil??? Everything was dry, so there was nothing that was going to boil...I did add a little water and let that simmer a minute. To us, these had little flavor and a 'dry' taste to them. I wish there would've been some other additions, like salsa, garlic,  green onions or something to boost the flavors more and make them a little 'juicier'. I served this w/ salsa on the side, which helped, but I think it should've been specified in the recipe to do that. I liked the taste of the crescent rolls, and the concept was a good one, I just think that for us, the recipe needs adjusted. Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought this was very yummy!  My kids ate it up.  

Variations:  Add some water to meat with taco seasoning to keep from being too dry.  Instead of pure ground beef, I used an "Italian" mix of ground beef, ground veal and ground pork - once package from grocery store.  I think it made it even better!

I will definitely come back to this recipe.

These were okay. Kind of dry. It could have used some green chilies, maybe some cream cheese? I didn't really like these but the kids really liked them. Don't think I would make these again.

Instead of hamburger I used some leftover grilled flank steak sliced and diced. Very good recipe my wife and I both enjoyed these and expected nothing less from Pillsbury... 4 stars because my wife wanted some kind of sause over hers... I thought they were great just as written.

We enjoyed this. It had good flavor and I will definitely make this again, but I will take the suggestions of some of the reviewers and add some liquid to the hamburger bean mixture.

The recipe was fine, but I didn't really think the crescent rolls mixed well with Mexican seasoning.  Guess I will stick with tortillas.

I loved this recipe!! The crescent rolls really just made it for me. The flaky buttery taste is very tasty. I drizzled some enchilada sauce over the top of the burritos before baking and it was very good. Not dry at all.

I used Hormel chili and beans instead which made the recipe much easier to prepare.I served the leftover chili as a side along with sour cream it was perfect for  a quick lunch.Although for next time I will definitely try some salsa, it was a lil dry but overall quick and good!
