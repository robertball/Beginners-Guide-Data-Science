Wow! I just tried this recipe, and my roomie and I absolutely LOVED it. I did make a few adjustments, however. I substituted 2 tbsp of corn starch for some of the flour to make it fluffier and less staunch. I know it's a shortcake, but we were in the mood for more "cakey" cake. I also used the light Karo syrup instead of the golden because it's what was on hand, and added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon and cornstarch into the glaze to make it slightly reminiscent of pumpkin pie, and thicker. I used a loaf pan and adjusted the temperature to 375 for 23 mins and it came out divine. Thanks for the great recipe!

This shortcake is fabulous. Easy, quick, and delicious. I had to add about 2-3 Tablespoons of milk to mine before it was even close to a "firm dough", but I am not known to be a precise measurer, so that is most likely my fault. Regardless, it turned out beautifully. I served with fresh sliced strawberries in sour cream/brown sugar. Heavenly!

This is what shortcake should be!  I love that little bit of ginger spark.  Used this for strawberry shortcake. YUUUUUMY!

Tasty but recipe has issues.  Either it needs more liquid to make it a "firm dough"  Or it needs to be changed to something that specifies it is not a dough but more of a graham cracker crust consistency.  It didn't form a dough at any point.  Recipe is slightly misleading and that is annoying. Like I said good tasting shortcake though.

Far from being a shortcake, this was more like a cookie. The only reason why I give it three stars is the flavor was okay.
