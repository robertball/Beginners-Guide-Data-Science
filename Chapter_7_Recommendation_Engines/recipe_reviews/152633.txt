This was sooo good.  I used a chocolate cookie crust (on this site) instead of a graham cracker crust.  Next time, I will add more oreo pieces to the filling and garnish with more oreo pieces on top.

I altered this a bit.  Here is what I did:  To make the crust, I melted a stick of organic (really does make a difference in taste - much creamier) butter and hand-crushed oreo cookies.  Because I crushed them with my hands, they remained fairly chunky which was nice.  I spread and flattened the "crust" into my 9" glass pie plate.  Topped the cookie crust with a thin layer of the cool whip, then poured the pudding/milk mixture in.  I think next time I may add about ten crumbled cookies into the filling, too.  We tried it after four hours and while it was very good, it was infinitely better after it had spent the night covered in the freezer.  It's like an ice cream cake!!

This was yummy.  Added a bit more chocolate to the bottom than called for. Also, it could use more Oreos.  Next time, I would chop them up and add them to the pudding mix.

Yum, but why in the world would you make an Oreo pie and not use Oreo crust?? That's the best part! But with Oreo crust instead, this looks great!
