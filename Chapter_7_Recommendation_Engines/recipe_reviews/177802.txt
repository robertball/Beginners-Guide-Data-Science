A great easy and quick weeknight meal. My boys all loved it ( 1, 4, 7 and 40 years old). I used fresh ingrediants not pre-cooked or frozen. Therefore I fried the chicken with garlic and onions before I added the broccoli soup and fresh broccoli. Quite yummy and simply filling!

My family loves this! I used fresh chicken, added 1/2 an onion with the potatoes and used an additional can of cheddar cheese soup. It took about 30 minutes to get the potatoes cooked all the way through. Definitely a keeper!

It's easy, it tastes good and it's healthy!  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of the vegetable oil--it's healthier because it has the good fats.

Hubby loved it and he's kind of a picky eater. I added some seasonings (garlic powder, pepper, salt, dried minced onion, etc) while cooking the potatoes. I added fresh chicken after the potatoes had cooked for a bit, just threw it on top. Cooked great without getting dried out. Also used cheese soup, since that's all I had in the house. Came out great!

Not good. I used cream of broccoli soup though, so maybe that is where I went wrong. I am normally a casserole lover, and this just didn't cut it for me.

This was great!!!  My daughter wanted more and more.  This is going to be a recipe I turn to on my "I need something quick" nights, and there are always a few!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because it was a little bland, so I added some salt and more parm!

Like Lisa said, nothing to write home about.  I will not make this again.  I followed the recipe except for roasting fresh chicken breast because I don't care for the pre-cooked.
