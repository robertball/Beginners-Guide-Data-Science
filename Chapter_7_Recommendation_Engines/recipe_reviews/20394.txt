We have updated this recipe to include 2 teaspoons baking powder. The baking powder was omitted due to a typo. We apologize for the confusion. - The Staff

I rated this 4 stars because you have to fix the recipe-obviously you would not use  2 teaspoons of salt in a dessert. 1/2 teaspoon is sufficient.  Also it is alot more moist using 1/2 c butter/shortening instead of 1/4 c.  With these corrections it's the same as the other buckle recipe-excellent!

Delicious!!!!!  I made this for work and everyone raved about it! It turned out moist and even the crumb topping was perfect.  I'm getting requests for not only the recipe but to make it again soon.  
I followed this recipe almost to the T.  The only thing I changed was decreasing the salt to 1 1/2 tsp.

I also thought this was too dry and "bready".  Not enough topping.  Would not make it again.

This recipe was okay as listed on site.  I reduced the salt immediately knowing that 2 teaspoons for a 13x9 was going to be too much.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was better than average, but not great.  I decided to try again, and increased the blueberries to 3 pints, used 2/3 C buttermilk and put in 1 t vanilla.  I used all the topping (it's a lot, but people loved the topping).  It was great warm with ice cream, and I also used it for breakfast and got rave reviews.  The recipe needs a bit of tweaking, but now I will be using it often in the summer.  I think you could put a teaspoon of almond extract rather than vanilla and get a different but very nice coffee cake, too.

I liked this recipe. It was easy to make and used ingredients I had on hand. After reading other reviews, I increased the butter to 1/2 c., decreased the flour to 1 1/2 c., and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. I also used brown sugar in the topping instead of white. I would definitely make it again.

It didn't have a lot of flavor even though I added some vanilla. Not really sure if I would make again.

This recipe couldn't be easier to make - all of the ingredients can be found in your pantry - just add berries. I made this for a coworkers birthday - everyone raved. I got lots of compliments.

I had an abundance of blueberries and have made some delicious desserts in the last few days. I'm sorry to say that this is not one of them. It's more of a bread and way too salty even though I cut back to 1 tsp. It has a beautiful presentation, too bad the flavors don't come together. I should have followed my instincts and moved on to the next recipe. But I thought I would give this one a shot. Big Mistake.

I completely screwed up this recipe and it was still delicious. I  used whole wheat flower, for a bump in nutritional value. I accidentally put the crumb topping in the wet mix, instead of the dry ingredients, then had to scramble to measure out the right amount of ingredients. I forgot to fold the blueberries in so I layered them over the cake and under the crumb topping. The cake ended up a little drier, but very pretty and tasty. I'm looking forward to making this again the right way. It'll probably be bumped up to 5 stars.

Taste was great.  Alittle more like a sweet bread than I had hoped for but over all was good.

I tried this, and even though my husband really liked it, and I thought it okay, my concern is with that "crumble crust". I know I followed the directions as printed, but I'm wondering if that flour/ butter ratio is correct for the crust- it turned kinda goopy and baked up as a fairly hard crust instead.

This recipe looks simple and sounds tasty, but it wasn't tasty at all.  I agree with Chris (another review) isn't it missing baking powder?  It was so haeavy.  I couldn't bear to share it with anyone but the trash can!

These are now one of my favorite blueberry recipes. They are the best when eaten right out of the oven. I think they taste better when they have been reheated. They have a cake-like consistency, and yet stay together like a bar. I would not adjust the recipe what so ever, but they probably would be good with a little more blueberries.

This was too salty and too much baking powder.  Even added 1 extra cup of sugar, a small tin of pineapple, and more fresh blueberries.  Ice cream didn't even help it.  If I try it again will add only 1 tsp baking powder and a lot less salt.  Sorry, but this was recipe is out of proportion

This recipe was a hit. My company loved it and my husband, who doesn't care for dessert or blueberries, couldn't get enough of it. For my preferences, next time I may lessen the salt and add a little more sugar to sweeten it up.

The first time I made this it was terrible.  I used the baking powder as updated but the salt was too much.  I think 1/2 teaspoon would be fine.  Other than the salty taste I think it would have been really really good.

Great recipe!  I also used 1/2 cup butter and cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  Everyone loved it.  I think it would be wonderful with any fresh fruit but really like it with black berries.

We used this recipe for a baking group.  Instead of blueberries we used peaches and it was wonderful.  Everyone came in to see what we baked because they could smell it in the hallways.  We can't wait to try this with Strawberries. Thanks.

Works very well in a food processer until you get to the blueberry part of course.  The kids absolutely loved it.

This turned out well.  I reduced the salt to 1.5 tsp. and increased the milk to 3/4 cup because it was too thick to add the blueberries to without mashing them.  We have it as dessert with vanilla ice cream and it makes a great dish for breakfast or brunch.  Will make it again.

This recipe came out wonderful. I am increasing the butter slightly for personal tastes in regards to moisture. In regards to those who are decreasing the amount of salt, you are also reducing the fluffiness of your batter upon baking. With the amount of sugar and other ingredients the salt isn't tasted in the slightest. This recipe is awesome, I'm making for the third time in just as many weeks. My partner, friends, and family love it...and so do I!!! Great recipe and easy to make!!

This is my favorite blueberry breakfast. I've done it before and everyone loved it! I'm doing it for breakfast right now because my mom loves blueberries and it is her birthday.
