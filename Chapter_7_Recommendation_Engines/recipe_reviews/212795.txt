I didn't think this salad was that great. Rather bland in my opinion. I would not make again.

I made this salad for my husband and parents and they all loved it! I grilled and shredded my own chicken rather than buying a pre-roasted one. I used "Lite House" Caesar dressing instead of the recipe's recommendation. It was a delicious salad!

Really delicious! I added croutons and used a different brand of dressing, and it was just awesome!

Our family loves this salad! The fresh basil really makes the flavors sing, I think. When we're in a hurry, I've used canned chicken and it works fine.  If I don't have feta on hand, fresh parmesan works just as well.  This is also a great dish for potlucks!

This was a great salad!!!! I used frozen grilled chicken strips (cut prep time in half) and added kalmata olives. The basil and parsley were fresh from my herb garden. Everyone loved this salad.

Very good and tasty too!  Love the added garlic and basil flavors in the caesar.   The only changes I made was I replaced the feta with shredded parmesan, used a low cal caesar dressing and used pre-cooked refrigerated diced chicken.

I'm still learning to cook and this was very easy to prepare. I wasn't sure about lettuce and hot pasta but it turned out to be really tasty. This recipe is going to be a keeper!

Excellent recipe.  I did not add the chicken and I must say, I did not miss it.  It's good w/o it as well. I think the basil added a lot to this recipe.
