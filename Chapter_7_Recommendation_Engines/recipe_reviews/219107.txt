Made exactly per recipe.  Awesome.  Wings were tender and juicy, but most importantly, the flavors were great.  A very nice sweet-hot-mustard combination, a great change to the tradtional wing (if there is such a thing).

Yum! These were fantastic, and a nice change from the typical buffalo and/or soy sauce-based wing recipes. I didn't find them very hot at all, so I might add a touch more hot pepper sauce next time, but they are very tasty as is.

These were fantastic. I didn't have any honey so I substituted maple syrup. My guy who loves hot wings said we could have these anytime instead.

I'm not a big fan of mustard based sauces or dressings, but I LOVED this recipe! We like things spicy and grilled at my house so I increased the hot sauce for extra burn and grilled the wings, basting them as they cooked. It works great on boneless breasts or strips too. A real keeper!

Sorry, Chef, but your orignal hot wing recipe completely seduced me :)  This isn't hideous, but it doesn't touch the quality of the original.

Really enjoyed these, and so did my guests. I used 4 tablespoons of dijon mustard and white vinegar since I didn't have any regular mustard or cider vinegar. Very light on the salt and didn't miss it at all!

I have made these many times since originally seeing the recipe on Chef John's Foodwishes blog.  The sauce is sweet, tangy, spicy, perfect.  The sauce is also great for grilled chicken legs

My husband has a favorite wing recipe and I don't remember where I got it from but it is called grilled wing zingers.  Every time I plan to try a new recipe he pouts.  He really really didn't even want to try these as he is not a "honey mustard" fan.  After he ate the first wing he said are these called crow wings?  He said because he was definitely eating crow.  He LOVED them and coincidentally so did I.  I didn't change a thing except I used cayenne pepper instead of black pepper and I doubled the hot pepper sauce because he likes hot.  Thank you Chef John for bringing some wing variety in my house.  Weeeee

Great wings! Like the description said, I wanted a change from the usual buffalo wings and this is a great alternative. Unfortunately, I didn't have any dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown mustard instead and a pinch of sugar to keep it on the sweet side. This didn't hurt the recipe at all. Really goes great with rice pilaf and a ice cold beer. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

These are delicious! I love mustard anyway so I was expecting them to be great and I wasn't disappointed. We had them with curried rice and salad.

I have made the sauce this way (5 stars) and then the second time I changed the hot sauce to wing sauce (Sweet Baby Rays) and added 1/2 cup to the rest of the ingredients.(5 stars, as well). Tasted, and added a little more honey.  It was devine!! Thanks again for the great recipe

The first time I made this and it was delicious.  Tonight I made it again.  I didn't have Dijon mustard.  So, as usual, I had to improvise,  I used extra yellow mustard to replace the Dijon.  I also added some garlic power and onion power.  My family loved, loved, loved  it.  Then I also had a chicken breast left over and my son heated it up and stirred it into the sauce.  This sauce is a must for chicken from now on.

I've decided these are my favorite wings of all the wing recipes I make. We have wings almost every Saturday night so I have a lot of wing recipes.  These are sensational. I've made them three times now and last night I decided they are my favorite and hubby agreed.  Easy to do, you probably have all the ingredients already and so tasty.  Thanks Chef John! Once again, a winner.

I made these sans the "hot" (we're a bunch of wimps in my house). For that authentic 'came from the wing joint' taste, I threw these in my deep fryer after baking for that crispy outer layer. These didn't make it past an hour....not a leftover in sight.

Nice change from the typical buffalo sauce wings. I expected them to be hotter. If you like your wings very spicy, I suggest adding more hot sauce. My bf and I really liked it.

I don't eat chicken wings but family seemed to enjoy these wings. Sauce was very easy to make just add a little extra hot sauce if you like a little spicier flavor. In which case we did.

Easy to make with a tasty glaze of the right spice.  Nice change from smoked wings.  Cooks in oven just right per directions.  Another fine tasting recipe you can make at home from Chef John.

Is there a support group to stop eating these? They are great.
I would suggest making a double sauce batch. One for cooking and the other for dipping.
..had no apple vinegar and used balsamic instead.

These were enjoyable.  I tasted the sauce and found the mustard to be way to overpowering so I did end up doubling the honey.

I actually didn't have any "yellow" mustard in the house. I ended up using a rounded teaspoon of Coleman's,  a rounded teaspoon of spicy brown, and the dijon.
I also only used 1/3 of the honey. 
All of the flavors were noticeable. First the mustard then the sweetness topped off with a perfect spiciness. 
This recipe is definitely a keeper although I will try yellow mustard with the Coleman's (I don't want to lose the heat it gives off). Keep it up Chef John, you rock!

I adore anything honey mustard and also adore spicy hot, so this combination was perfection!

SAUCE ME! I was looking for a sauce for my wings that I had already made tonight. I found the sauce recipe and although I modified it I could still tell that it would have been good as is...(4 stars) but with the substituted items I used...I thought it KICKED it UP! Sriracha mustard, spicy brown mustard and a teaspoon of regular mustard...along with the BRAGGS apple cider vinegar. It was spicy, sweet and ummami! (5 stars with the substitutions)

I made exactly to recipe on a gas grill,coated them at first and basted them again halfway through and it was wonderful! I usually make the traditional Frank's hot sauce buffalo style which I love also,but these are a great change. My husband doesn't like the real hot ones so we will be making half like this and half hot wings now.

These were different and we liked them! I used a beer infused dijon mustard. Not too overpowering, but had a nice flavor. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was absolutely awesome! I'm a big buffalo wing fan. They're my favourite, but this was such a delicious change. I wasn't sure I'd like the mustard aspect of this but boy was I wrong. Nice and tangy. A great alternative from the same flavours all the time. Will certainly make again.

I really like this baked-wing alternative! Two alterations I made were (1) I soaked my wings in clder vinegar for about 5 hours - the time to and from church today - and (2) I used all 1/4 c. of my homemade mustard instead of the 50-50 split Chef John used. YUMMY YUM YUM, wings for the tum!!!

This is a great recipe. I did make some changes. I deep fried our wings instead of baking and added more hot sauce. My daughters (8 & 10) like spicy but not too spicy and this was perfect after adding a tad more hot sauce. This recipe does make a little too much sauce but we had some wings we couldn't finish and the leftover sauce was perfect to re-sauce the next day :-)

Next time, I will grill the chicken and baste the sauce on towards the end. Cooking to the recipe, I would say this is okay.

The sauce is very tasty and easy to make - like some other reviewers I would like to use it on chicken breasts or other pieces. It was also a nice change from the more "standard" style of wings. But even though I tossed tge wings in some seasoned flour and allowed them to stand a bit before cooking them, the sauce couldn't help but make the nice crisp skin a little too soggy for our taste. We liked the flavors a lot, but probably won't make these in this exact format again.

I love Chef John's recipes but this one didn't win us over. Followed recipe exactly, I won't be making this one again.
