This is the *start* of a great recipe. It will be a bit bland if you make it as-is. I added some chopped onion and garlic along with a bit of salt. Saw that another reviewer added some Worstershire sauce and that is a brilliant idea. I also think paprika or some chopped mushrooms might be a good addition depending on your tastes.

Pretty easy to make, and would be very easy to cut in half or portion out for meal-planning if you're cooking for one like I am. Another time I will cook one squash only, and freeze half the stuffing for another week.

(I used a smoked andouille sausage and it was delicious.)

I used the turkey version of the sausage, and I decided that it needed a touch of olive oil while browning.  I also added just a splash of Worchester sauce.  I would suggest that the time for precooking of the acorn squash be a bit more.  I needed it to be cooked more than just tender.

I also added onion, garlic and apple like another reviewer did, and used beef summer sausage.  I think this made for a delicious fall dinner.

I followed the recipe except for a few things:
I baked the acorn squash instead of microwaving it.
Instead of using fresh sage & fresh thyme, I used dry seasonings and halved the spices.
I used Caulirice (packaged cauliflower rice) instead of brown rice.  Oh and I chopped up about a half cup of onions and fried it with the sausage.  Best recipe I have tried yet.

the squash turned out great microwaved and I loved the vinegar drizzled over it. YUM!

My family loved it! I am not a great cook and it was a very simple recipe.
