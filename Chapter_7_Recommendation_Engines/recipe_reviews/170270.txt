My husband and daughter loved this soup! I was in a rush for time so I did use the whole bag of hashbrowns seasoned well added with 1 tablespoon of butter and it was a hit with my family. I made this recipe for 8-10. Thank you.

Just ok.  Made as directed, except frozen vs. canned corn.  I didn't like the cream corn in it.  I won't be making this again.

The recipe was "ok".  The ratio of bacon to the other ingredients was a bit over the top, but saved it.   The canned corns added a "yuk" factor.   This recipe would be far better with fresh or frozen corn.   All in all, it was ok for folks who liked canned vegetable, especially creamed corn.

Loved it but not my favorite corn chowder. I don't like peppers in my chowder. Wasn't hard to make at all and prep/cook time was very reasonable. Bacon ratio was good for me. I also added a bit of milk because that is the way I like it.
