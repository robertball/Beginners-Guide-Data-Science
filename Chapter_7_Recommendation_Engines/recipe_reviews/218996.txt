WOW!  I have a favorite dipping sauce that my husband and I like very much to use with coconut shrimp, but, this receipe as of dinner last night became our all time favorite.. however, I did not have stone-ground mustard instead I used dijon mustard.. then flavor was GREAT!

I had to use Apricot Jam because I did not have orange.  I doubled the recipe but only used 1 tsp of horseradish because the only kind in my frig was EXTRA HOT...which I use for cocktail sauce. I used combo of Dijon and Stoneground Brown mustard. It needed a little dash of sour for our taste and to cut the sweetness...so I put a teaspoon of key lime juice.  I also think this would make an awesome ham glaze with some honey or brown sugar added to it.

We love horseradish, so I added a heaping teaspoon. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written, and it is awesome! I used Coconut Shrimp I recipe from this site, and it was delish!

The sauce was pretty good and taste exactly like the dipping sauce at Outback. However I didn't have the stone ground mustard but I used regular mustard and that was fine.

I just made a variation - we don't keep horseradish so I doctored my version with some ginger and added some very finely chopped fresh pineapple. Yum! I never would have thought of adding mustard to marmalade. I imagine this might work as a glaze too if thinned out with some Karo or Lyle's syrup?

Perfect pairing for "Baked Coconut Shrimp" on this site. I was a little concerned because I'm not a big fan of orange marmalade but the stone ground mustard did a great job of toning down the sweet and the horseradish brought a nice punch to go with all that sweet of coconut and marmalade. I did go a little heavy with the extra hot horseradish which worked for us that love the heat. Not generally an aesthetic guy but the stone ground mustard did a nice job of toning down the bright orange. I'm sure dijon would work but if you have the time get the stone ground. Just a better flavor here.

DELICIOUS!!!  So easy too!  I didn't have stone ground mustard on hand and subbed dijon and it was still wonderful.

We loved this! As well as the coconut shrimp recipe! This sauce was perfect although I had to tweek it bc I didn't have horseradish separately from mustard. What I have is a mustard with horseradish in it so I used same amount of orange marmalade and 2 tbs of the mustard. Delish!!!

I didn't have orange marmalade on hand so I took a cup of orange juice and a large squirt of honey and reduced to half over medium heat then added a corn starch slurry to thicken then added the mustard and horse radish. It turned out great perfect with the baked coconut shrimp. Yum!!!!

My family has found the horseradish to be way too harsh in this sauce. We prefer to leave it out and allow the mustard's gentler heat to shine.

i was surprised how good this was. i only had sugar free marmalade in the fridge at the time and I used that and it was very tasty. I added a bit of honey only because the marmalade had the 'sugar free bitter' taste.

Doctored it up a bit with apricot jam added to the given recipe along with some cherry juice from a jar of maraschimo cherries. Made it much better.

Made this tonight to go with some chinese nibbles so tweaked it a tad. Added a pinch of chilli flakes a few drops of sesame oil and a small splash of chinese wine...made a change from the usual sweet chilli sauce. Very nice.

Goes great with coconut shrimp. I used my rhubarb orange marmalade since it was open and ended up adding some fresh chopped pineapple to stretch it.

I know I know you shouldn't rate a recipe you haven't made but this is the exact same recipe that a high end restaurant here serves with fried alligator tail. Don't let the easy or the odd combination fool you this is a great sauce.
