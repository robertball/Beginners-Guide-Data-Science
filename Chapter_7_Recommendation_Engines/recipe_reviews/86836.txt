If you have some imagination, this turns out very good.  I had to add a vegetable, and it happened to be corn.  Also, I had onions with the meat.  Used shredded cheddar instead of american slices, but that's to be expected.  Everyone loved it and it was all eaten.

Good basic recipe that got tweaked just a bit. Didn't have any golden cream of mushroom, so we used regular. Added onions after browning the meat. Layered a can of green beans on top of meat, then potatoes, then shredded cheddar (instead of American). Sprinkled chives across the top. Tasted great and was easy to put together.

Sooo good!  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I added worstershire to the hamburger along with onions.  I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom since we're not big mushroom fans.  I used shredded mexican blend cheese instead of american, I added frozen peas into the middle of the pie, and lastly I did half potato and half cauliflower for the topping.  This dish was so good I'll be making it again very soon!

I'm giving it a 3-star rating, because I think this recipe is a very basic recipe for shepherds pie, I think most people would make adjustment for flavour.  It is good recipe because it's simple and doesn't require tons of ingredients for the times you just can't be bothered to do elaborate cooking.  I didn't have mushroom soup or mushrooms on hand, so I guessed on making a gravy for the beef.  For the gravy flavour About midway through browning the meat I added 2 chopped onions, and let it continue to cook, stirring every so often.  Then after a short time, I then added more flavourings... sprinkled about 3 tsp beef bouillon powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1 tsp salt and stirred it around to make sure it mixed througly. To make the gravy  I added a sprinkling of 2 tbsp of flour, mixed it around so that the flour coated much of the meat, and then added about 3/4 cup of milk and about 1 tbps soya sauce.    I didn't need to add chopped onions but I like the texture and flavour of cooked onions with meat. You could use onion powder instead.  For the mashed potatoes, I use some milk butter and salt.  I topped the potatoes with shredded cheddar, since that's what I had.

Awesome! I left off the cheese and added sauteed onions, frozen corn, peas and carrots. Use instant mashed potatoes. Went over big at my St. Pat's dinner. Thanks!

This recipe was a success...both my husband and I enjoyed it.  I used cheddar cheese instead of American and added some sauteed mushrooms to the meat.  Next time, my husband asked me to add more vegetables, so I think I'll try some carrots and peas.  Also, I put too much mashed potatoes on top and it bubbled over, making a mess out of my oven, but I'm pretty sure that was my own fault for using 5 rather large potatoes.  Next time I'll make sure to put a cookie sheet under it, though!  Yummy!

Really good.  The combination of the meat, soup and cheese melted together and made a cheesy, creamy blend that tasted excellent!!! 

The second time I made this, I added frozen corn on top of the meat mixture before the american cheese and added shredded co-jack cheese on top of the potatoes.  My husband whom normally doesn't Shepherd's Pie thought this was really good and said he would like it again.

I tweaked this a little, like many others, but this is easily my favorite recipe for shepherd's pie.  I had been looking for a good recipe for a couple of years.  My husband is Irish, but I don't love the way his family makes it.  I tried several methods, including making the gravy from scratch.  This recipe, with the golden mushroom soup, has the best flavor and is SOOO much easier!  
  I did add frozen peas and corn to the beef mixture, used cheddar cheese instead of American, and made mashed potatoes my way with butter and milk.  
  One thing I did learn from the Irish--once the potatoes are spread on top of the beef mixture in the baking dish, I score the top in a criss-cross pattern with a fork.  It makes it look nice and makes it easier to tell when the potatoes are browned just right in the oven.
  This will be my go-to recipe for shepherd's pie from now on:)

I used regular cream of mushroom soup and everything else just like directed.  Surprised at how much I liked it.  I really like the american cheese slices with it.  Simple yet good. :)

Like most I modified the recipe and should I have followed it to a T it would have been very plain in my opinion. I added onions, salt, pepper and italian seasoning to the meat and garlic salt, butter, milk and a bit of sour cream to the potatoes and it turned out quite tasty.

I do like the cream of mushroom soup added in the meat. Like most, i did not have cream of golden mushroom so I used the standard cream of mushroom.

I did this with ground lamb. I added canned stewed tomatoes, corn, and peas. I also added a browning sauce, and used shredded mixed cheese instead of sliced.  I made mashed potatoes as i normally would and topped it with them and baked as instructed, came out really well. :)

Followed the recipe exactly and it tasted very good, but the meat "crust" didn't stay together as it does on other shepherd's pie recipes I've used.  I also like a layer of vegetables between the meat and potatoes.

My family loves this recipe! I have tried with the Golden Cream of Mushroom Soup and the regular Cream of Mushroom Soup and the regular is just so much better in my opinion. I spread a layer of can corn over the meat, add cheese, potatoes and top with more cheese. I use any American or Sharp Cheese I have in the house. Always delicious!

Mucho delicioso!  I had to make a few changes to this recipe so that it could accommodate my dietary needs since I track my calories but it still turned out FABULOUSLY at only 371 cals per serving!  Here's what I used:

1lb. 96/4 lean ground beef
4 small russet potatoes (about 20 oz total)
2 slices 2% Kraft singles (50 cals each) cut into 4 triangles
1/2 can cream mushroom soup
1/2 jar of Heinz savory beef gravy
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup of chopped carrots
2 tsp minced garlic 
1 tsp onion powder
salt/pepper to taste

I made this exactly as written, perhaps the first time I've ever tried to make a shepherd's pie. I used medium-sized "Russet Burbank" potatoes, and I think this may also be the first time I'd ever mashed potatoes (using a fork, which wasn't too tedious). I cooked the potatoes for 10 minutes, and the whole dish for 25, at which point the top was not even close to "golden brown". I ate this over 4 nights for dinner, and I thought it was pretty tasty for a fairly simple dish. It is kind of light on the spices (you only get what's in the soup), but I suppose this dish isn't supposed to be all that spicy anyway. I think that the reheated leftovers might have been even a little better than the fresh serving. This was a fairly nice dish to have.

Fast, fast, fast.  I used instant potatoes and regular cream of mushroom soup.  I didn't have American cheese on hand and used slices of cheddar, and it turned out just fine.  I also added about half a can of peas.  British hubby says it's not as good as his mother's, but he was still pleased.

Love this variation as I don't care for Shepherd's Pie.  But this was wonderful!  Used shredded cheese instead of slices and added onion and garlic in the beef.  Added a can of corn too.  Green beans were good in it also.

Super easy!  I added a cup of garden peas and a dash of worcesterchire sauce.  I used shredded cheese instead of sliced, and regular cream of mushroom, not golden.  Looks pretty on the plate!  I think it would go well with a pint of Guiness...

my husband loved this!!! I think next time I will substitute the ground beef with ground turkey to cut some of the fat out of this recipe but other then that it was really delicious! I added onion in with my ground beef and it turned out super good!! The can of mushroom soup gave it a  white gravy flavor!

I make this when it's cold and dreary out (or when I need a quick & easy recipe)! However, instead of cream of mushroom soup I add a packet of dry onion soup mix and water while browning the ground beef. I put mashed potatoes on the bottom, a layer of the meat, a layer of frozen corn, another layer of potatoes, meat & corn then top it with shredded velveeta cheese and bake until cheese melts and it is hot all the way through! Great easy meal and reheats beautifully! You could probably even freeze it but I haven't tried that yet!

Great base recipe but I tend to add to it.  Particularly veggies, sometimes bacon, cheese, chives...just use your imagination.  Overall, a quick family meal that is pretty good.

This recipe was super easy and turned out great!  I actually didn't have any cream of mushroom so I used cream of celery soup and added some canned mushrooms.  Also threw in some canned corn and frozen peas to add some bulk and it turned out great.  Nice easy recipe!

My family loved this recipe. I changed it a little bit by adding shredded cheese to the mashed potatoes and adding in a can of mixed vegetables with the hamburger. I will be making this one again!

Good baseline.  I did use this recipe to jump start my imagination.  Ground the beef with onion.  Added the golden mushroom soup to the beef.  Topped casserole with potatoes as directed, but topped potatoes with a garnish of fried onions and grated cheddar cheese.  Baked until top was crispy.  Very good basic recipe if you have an imagination to "tweek" it to your own families tastes!

I wasn't expecting much from this recipe but my family and I absolutely loved it. This was the only shepherd's pie recipe I looked at that included cheese and I almost didn't include it because of that but it definitely made the dish. I didn't have slices so instead I grated about half a cup of cheddar. Next time I think it'll be closer to a cup. I also added veggies like most reviewers, just some onions and carrots cooked with the beef and then some corn. I cooked it in a casserole dish instead of a pan to avoid any spills. This was more trouble than I usually like to go to for dinner but it was worth it. I'll definitely be making it again.

This was an easy shepherd's pie to make. The only thing I added was an onion (diced) and a clove of garlic (minced). When I added the mushroom soup, I also added some corn. It was good.

This is great if you need something easy. And it's very openly advertised as a no-nonsense kind of recipe for people who don't care about impressing a gourmet crowd. This saved me when I didn't know what to make. Thanks!

Great Base recipe... I added a can of kernel corn and a couple handfuls of frozen peas and diced up some green pepper and onion and sauteed them with the meat.   I also used Sharp cheddar both in the pots and then on top as well.

This was excellent.  I'm always on the lookout for budget/time friendly meals and this fit the bill.  I did make some changes to fit personal taste/preference.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to add some spices for flavor.  After browning and draining the grease from the hamburger I added 1/2 t. dried basil and about 2 cloves minced garlic to the hamburger and let that cook for a few minutes before adding the soup.  I used regular cream of mushroom soup (generic brand) to keep cost down.  I added about 1 1/2 c. frozen corn on top of the hamburger mixture, then the cheese slices.  Instead of using "real" potatoes, to save on time, I made 4 servings of instant mashed potatoes as per the directions on the box (with a little extra butter as I always do) then topped it off with a sprinkling of fresh ground pepper.  I let it bake until it started to brown slightly on top and it turned out wonderful!  A great budget and time friendly meal that both my husband and I enjoyed.  I've made this twice already as it's become one of our "regular" meal items.  Easy and versitle, definately a keeper for my recipe box!

This was good for such a quick meal. I was looking for something hubby could make for dinner when I am working. I put the cheese on top in error, but it didn't matter. It was a little on the bland side though. The only comment they made was it needed more beef. Not my favorite recipe for SP, but easy and something my guys can fix by themselves. Thanks, this was a winner.

A great comfort food dish!! I followed the recipe as above but I also added some onion, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, & black pepper. I also added sharp cheddar cheese on top of the potatoes the last 10 min's of baking. I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty!  Will definitely make again.  Added sauteed onions to the meat, only had regular mushroom soup on hand, and added a can of corn over the cheese.  I think I may try shredded sharp cheddar on the next go around.

This was a really easy recipe to follow probably because of the amount of ingredients! Even I, who hasn't cooked for about the last 3-4 months, changed the recipe some to add more veggies into my family's diet! I also added a can of cream of celery soup with the mushroom soup as well as corn and beans (only veggie they will eat!). I also only had cheddar cheese on hand, so I topped the mashed potatoes (instant here, never really made the "homemade" ones) with that. In all, a simple recipe that can be adjusted to whatever your tastes or what you have on hand! Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe was perfect! I made Yukon Gold mashed potatoes with sour cream and garlic and butter and milk! 
My favorite thing about this shepherds pie is that there’s no vegetables! I detest them.

Easy, delicious recipe.  My family liked it because there were no vegetables in it (I was able to make a favorite vegetable on the side), and we had all of the ingredients on hand.  We all fought over the leftovers.  (This was great the first day, but even better the next day!)  To add a twist, I used Johnsonville Chicken Sausage Three Cheese Italian Style (decased and minced), instead of the ground beef.  This added zip and lots of extra flavor.  This will be a favorite in our house no matter which way I make it (original recipe or with a twist).

Very simple to put together.  I added chopped onion to brown with meat. I also used shredded cheddar and added about 2 cups mixed frozen veggies.

I read all your reviews and I must say you all had the right touch! I stuck with basic... green beans and cream of mushroom, along with cheddar cheese! Perfect, but it did take me longer than an hour, I made serving for 6!!!! Thanks

Manwich was on sale at the store and I've never made Shepherd's pie (I've had it dining out and found it bland), so Gluten Girl had a recipe similar to this one with Manwich in place of mushroom soup.  It turned out pretty good, but I'd add tomatoes next time for added tang and texture.

My 11 year old and 7 year old love this with our twist on it!!!  2 cans golden mushroom, 1 can corn, 1 can peas, and 1 can carrots all mixed for the bottom layer.  And I use a 9x 13 pan so it all fits!!!

Oh wow.  That is good.  I took the suggestion of another member and cooked the beef with onion and green pepper, but otherwise followed directions exactly.  Well, I accidentally added the butter to the potatoes before mashing, so didn't dot on top ... but still.  OH SO GOOD.  The only problem is this wouldn't have fed our family of four if my husband was home so next time I'll need to double or at least add 50% to the recipe.  But wonderful flavor, super easy, and faster than I expected.  This is a keeper that I'll definitely be making again!

LOVE, LOVE this recipe!!  This will be the 3rd time in 2 weeks I am preparing this dish.  Very Easy and so flavorful.  Very easy to adjust to one taste, but I like it just as it is.  I do add a "tiny" amount of milk to the potatoes, but that is all I do differently.  Enjoy!!

as a basic recipe this is so easy and quick, but when I went to make it I discovered I had no ground beef in the freezer, I did however have a half of a roasted turkey breast from the day before in the fridge, so I diced it, and to the soup added a quarter teaspoon of poultry seasoning, topped it with mild cheddar as this is all I had in the fridge too, came out wonderful, with the leftover biscuits and cole slaw we had a quick, easy, delicious meal, hubby loved it, next time I will try it your way, but I do have to say, my quicky turkey pie came out pretty darn good.

This was ok, I was using up left over mashed potatoes.  I added a bag of frozen peas and carrots, should have heated them up half way before adding them, they were still chewy.  Looking forward to heating up leftovers -- hoping that will heat everything evenly making it the right consistency.

This recipe is so easy and simple, that my simple additions, made me feel like a gormet chef (I'm usually not a "smart" enough cook to just "know" what to add)!  While I did make several additions, I think that this recipe would still be a 5 star on it's own.....reason being, I think it is the soup that makes it!!  It gives it tremendous flavor and moisture.  The things I added....a sprinke of garlic salt and an  onion to the ground beef, a layer of peas and carrots, and I made the mashed potatoes with a touch of milk, garlic salt.  Will make again.

I love this recipe.  Very simple and easy to make but tastes great.  I substitute real potatoes for box potatoes when I'm running short on time and it comes out delicious.  I also use cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom.  Then in the meat mixture I also add about half a can of corn and green beans.  That's why I really love this recipe, there are so many options to use when you make it.  Try it and you won't be sorry!

I only gave this 3 stars because I only used it as a "starter"! I think made as is would be rather bland...I seasoned my meat with garlic powder, onion powder and Tony's cajun seasoning. I also cooked some bacon and added a can of green beans and corn to my meat. I only had regular cream of mushroom soup but it worked fine. I also added milk, butter, salt, garlic powder and onion powder to my potatos. My husband, 6 yr old daughter and I all loved the way it turned out! Oddly, the only one who didnt like it was my 1yr old daughter who usually eats ANYTHING!

This recipe is SUPER easy, but not that exciting which is why I gave it a 4. I added frozen corn and carrots on top of the meat and threw in some garlic. It was delicious and the leftovers were amazing!

5 stars for ease and 4 stars for taste. I liked the flavor the golden mushroom soup added to the meat. I threw in some peas and instead of American slices, I used Swiss. Easy to change up, so we will be keeping this one.

Delicious!  Especially as left overs.  I added steamed carrots to the top which really helped.  Of course I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of sliced american.  And I only used regular cream of mushroom, but either way will be wonderful I'm sure.  I also added onions, chopped celery and white pepper to the hamburger meat while it was cooking.  Absolutely wonderful!

Delicious!  Added corn and green beans and topped off potatoes with Cheddar cheese instead of American.  Easy, simple recipe.

I make quite a few changes to the recipe.  I used instant mashed potatoes, shallot, yellow and orange peppers, sage, sea salt and I topped the potatoes with shredded american cheese and mozzerella/parmesan.
My family loved it.

Whole family loved it, although I did add peas and carrots.  We even had unexpected company that night and they loved it too.

I had all of the ingredients on hand except for the American Cheese, but used Colby Longhorn instead & it melted nicely.  My husband doesn't like alot of vegetables or seasonings so this simple receipe was perfect for him.  It was still very flavorful.  He ate most of it except for maybe a spoonful. Will definitely make it again!

Good, but a bit salty.  I may try again with some veggies.

Great recipe!  This was EASY to prepare and tasted wonderful.  I substituted potato flakes for the potatoes (which made this faster to prepare), and mixed in peas and carrots.  My 2 yr old loved it and so did mommy and daddy!
