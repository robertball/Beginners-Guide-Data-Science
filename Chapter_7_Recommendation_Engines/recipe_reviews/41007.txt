This was great, It is a little difficult with 2 kids running around to roll, other than that, excellant. 50 times better than frozen chicken stuff, like kiev
I used brownberry italian croutons and proccessed them in lieu of bread crumbs. excellant.  Will definately make again, maybe next time kiev style.  Thank you for the recipe

This was easy to make, looked great and was absolutely delicious! It definately needs to cook more than the 20-25 minutes stated.  I cooked mine for about 45 minutes. My kids weren't crazy about the sundried tomatoes but they just picked them out and ate it up! I thought they added a nice flavor.  I would make this again and again.

I made this on Mothers Day for my mom, and everyone really liked it, I skipped the sun dried tomatoes but added Muenster cheese with the Sharp Chedder, everyone seemed to like it, I also used Three Cheese Bread Crumbs for the coating, it tasted very good.  I had to cook mine for about 45 minutes for it to be done, not the 25 noted in the recipe.

Quick and easy, made it without the dried tomatoes and it was great!  The kids liked the "surprise" filling.  I like the fact that no toothpicks are needed.  We'll make it again (maybe next time with a piece of ham wrapped around a stick of swiss!)

This was deeeelicious. The sun-dried tomatoes weren't the biggest hit, though. They were a bit strong for my family. The kids chowed down on the chicken, though.

This was so easy.  It really didn't take much more time than popping the frozen keivs in the oven but they were 100% better.  I love them.  I will definatly cook again.

Not bad!  Easy to prepare.  Sundried tomatoes add a huge flavor, I would use more sparingly next time!

WOW! These are easy to make and sooo good! I made a slight variation on the filling since my boyfriend won't eat sundried tomatoes. I used white cheddar cheese and steamed broccoli... turned out great! I will definitely make this again.

These were really good, but very filling. Plan on having leftovers or making less than you think you might need. Really tasty though! Will definitely make these again!

I used this basic recipe and stuffed it with what I had on hand. I lightly sauteed some onions, zucchini, mushrooms and roma tomatoes and used that as a stuffing. I also used mozzarella cheese. I followed the recipe for the breading. It came out very good. I cooked it (I only made one chicken breast) about 40 minutes as some reviewers suggested, but it was a little dry so next time I will try 30 minutes.

This recipe turned out great!  The chicken was very moist and tender.

Good recipe..I had a hard time "rolling" the chicken up, so a lot of cheese melted out. I also added a little bit of fresh garlic for taste. The Husband loved it!

The coating on these is just fantastic!  Did not have cheddar so I used Provolone and fresh sauteed mushrooms - wonderful.  They did take a bit longer to cook...maybe I didn't flatten them enough...  Will make again

This was a very easy recipe to follow. I made a few changes. I omitted the tomatoes. I also added 50/50 pepperjack cheese and sharp cheddar. It added a bit of a zing and was very good. I did have to bake it the whole amount of time so that the jack cheese could melt. I think next time I will serve it topped with the green chili sauce from chicken enchilada's II recipe found on this site. I will be making this for my family again.
