I used blueberries and a frozen berry mix. My husband is on a bland diet, so our dietary choices are very limited, but he really enjoyed this for a nice change.

I made this using blueberries. I liked that it wasn't thickened using banana. Even though it was thick, it had a very light, fresh taste to it, perhaps due to the white grape juice. It was enough for 2 people as an afternoon snack.
