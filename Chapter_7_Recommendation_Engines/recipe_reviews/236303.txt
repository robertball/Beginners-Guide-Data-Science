Really delicious! And versatile as I did make a few changes to accommodate what I had on hand. I wanted to do them open-face style so I first boiled the halved poblanos for about 5 minutes to soften and then plunged into cold water to stop the cooking. Since I had 12 halves to stuff I was able to increase the stuffing amount so I doubled the amount of mushrooms (cremini) and Parmesan cheese (the real kind) and diced up a tomato and mixed it in. I had no creole seasoning so I improvised with some chilli powder, cumin, cayenne and salt and pepper to taste. After stuffing I topped them with a sprinkle of smoked paprika and baked at 350 for about 25 minutes. I covered them with foil for the first 15 minutes but it probably wasn't necessary. The peppers were perfectly tender and the result was yum!

Delicious! I turned these 1/2 way through broiling, and some of the filling ran out, but once they cooled a bit, I was able to put the filling back inside. I had 3 large poblano peppers and that amount of filling was just enough to fill them. Great flavor and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was unsure if the broiler was meant to be set on low or high. Apparently it’s high. Delicious recipe!

We grow poblano and jalapeño peppers, and we never know what to do with all of them. Last summer, I found this recipe, and it is a hit! Most ingredients are on hand, easy to make, and delicious. The only alteration I make is doubling the amount of mushrooms.

we had it with dinner tonight and my family loved it.  Had to watch broiler to make sure didn't burn (over burn) because the peppers roast. I will definitely make again.
