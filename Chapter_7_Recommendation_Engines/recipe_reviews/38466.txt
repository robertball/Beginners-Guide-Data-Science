I’ll give this a 1 star because it lacks total authenticity. I mean, if you order a fillet mignon in a restaurant, would you be happy with any piece of cooked meat? Absolutely not! While this is a tasty sandwich, it is NOT the true Cuban midnight sandwich. Try buying Cuban Bread (most Wal-Mart’s have it on the bakery section) No Italian dressing (use mayo and mustard) No turkey meat (instead use roasted pork), ham, Swiss and pickle slices are OK. Sprinkle with a little bit of salt, pepper and grill until cheese is melted. I always make these on a flat griddle-press so that I don't get grill marks on the bread. Also some people like spreading a bit of butter on one side of the bread and mayo-mustard on the other. Source: Myself. (Cuban/Cook)

GREAT sandwich! Complimented our soup wonderfully! I used a little less mustard but I mixed it into the mayo/italian dressing mix. By the way - the mayo mix made enough for 8 sandwiches with plenty to spare.  Knowing this, I may cut that part in half next time. Also - doing the sandwiches on the stove was a pain.  I just put them in the oven (open-faced) for apprx 5-10 minutes and worked out better this way (and more could be done at one time). Still, a wonderful sandwich - authentic or not - that we will be making plenty of times! Thanks!

Delicious! Follow the recipe EXACTLY as others have said. FYI-The idea of the foil and plate is to press down the sandwich while it cooks so whatever accomplishes that will do. I used a small frying pan lid to press down. Also, I would recommend you microwave the meat to warm it and take the cheese out ahead so it's not really cold. This will help in the process of cooking the sandwich so that the cheese melts, the meat warms and the bread gets crispy.

good flavor. quick to put together and cook. i used the george foreman grill -- i cooked them for 4 minutes, making sure to apply some pressure to the handle of the grill and press the sandwich.

This was terrific!  My husband and kids loved it!  I thought that one cup of mayonnaise was a bit much for 4 sandwiches.  I cut it down to 1/4 cup and it made more than enough spread for all the sandwiches.

Very good, and easy to prepare on a busy night.  I cut the sauce ingredients (mayo, italian dressing) in half and thought that was plenty. Also just mixed in half the amount of mustard with the sauce and spread it on all at once.

This is definitely one of our favorite sandwiches.  I've made it so many times, I don't even need the recipe any longer!  The flavors blend beautifully, and the outside of the roll gets super crunchy with the fruity olive oil taste.  Even though I'm always anxious to take that first bite, I force myself to grill it slowly to make sure it's warmed through completely.  It's a meal in itself.

These were great. However we had way too much sauce so you really only need to make half as much as it calls for.

Yummy, hot pressed po'boys at home.  These are great.  I did have to turn the stove down to about medium to keep them from burning.

I did these open faced under the broiler without frying on both sides. These are a favorite and though they're not like the ones you can get in Miami they are still tasty!

So yummy and super easy!  Will def. Make again with a few changes.  I used sweet Italian loaves (all the grocery store had left) and pan-fried as directed.  Could probably get away with half the mayo, may do half-mayo half-greek yogurt next time and will def mix the mustard in.  Will def use toothpicks next time to keep it all together.  The mustard and pickles and sweet bread are key to keeping it Cuban-inspired.  Almost as yummy as cubans in a restaurant and def. Super easy.  A must try!

All of the Cuban Midnight Sandwiches I've had have included a slice of pork tenderloin, but this was good just the same.  I'm a fat watcher and I like to point out when recipes misstate the fat grams.  This recipe assumes that you use all of the mayo dressing and the entire ½ c. of olive oil. Not even close!  I used 4 – 6” hoagie rolls.  I brushed each side with olive oil and it took a total of about 2 Tbsp. Same goes with the mayo sauce.  The recipe yields 1 - 1/3 c. sauce, but I used less than 2 Tbsp per roll and had well over ¾ c. left over.  That makes a huge difference when calculating both calories and fat.

Anything I can get the entire family to eat gets five stars. LOL This was very good. I hate pickles, but I notice they accent the taste very well. Very quick and easy to make. I highly recommend for a quick and easy meal!!!

Very good sandwich. Not 100% authentic but  WHO CARES AS LONG AS LONG AS IT TASTE GOOD!! yes this sandwich is not an authentic cuban sandwich its really more of a cuban inspired sandwich.  I have to admit i was a little hesitant at first because of the mention of the mayo/italian dressing combination. Then i was going to maybe put the mayo on after i put it in the panini machine. At the last moment i decided to follow the recipe exactly and i'm glad i did. It was a very good sandwich. This along with a bowl of soup is a very satisfying combination.

May not call this "Traditional" or "Authentic" but sure can call it "DARN GOOD!" Used a George Foreman as a "Sandwich Press" and turned out "Perfecto Mundo!"

Very good! While traditional cuban sandwiches are made with pork, I love the modification!  Great for turkey leftovers-which is what I used instead of deli meat.  Just because this isn't the traditional cuban sandwich doesn't mean it deserves 1 start.  Try it before you rate it.  Goodness.

You can change meat if you want as it will come out yummy every time. Pickle will add spice so if you are making for children leave it off...

This was easy and tasty and pretty quick too.  There was way more sauce than you really need.  I'd cut it in half at least.

This was a great variation on sandwiches. My husband and I liked the sauce a lot, but it makes it very slippery, so everything falls out. May want to use toothpicks to hold it together.

Might not be a "real" Cuban Midnight Sandwich, but sure is tasty! Good way to use up hamburger buns! We cooked on the George Foreman(about 2 min.- preheated), Mixed 1/2 cup REAL mayonnaise and about 2 Tb. bottled zesty Italian dressing. Spread the mayo mixture on one side of the crusty roll, then topped with the cheese, turkey, dill pickle, and ham then spread the mustard on the side that touched the ham. When pressed and grilled, the outside gets slightly crusty and the middle is hot and melty. Yummm

Great recipe...however way to much mayonnaise...I stated filling the measuring cup up as I was reading directions.  When I realized it was just to make the spread I stopped filling it up.  I only used a little over a half cup and I still had plenty to toss.  Because I used less mayo I also cut back to 3 tablespoons dressing.  I used mayo with olive oil & fat free 15 calorie wishbone Italian dressing...made a great combo. For the mustard just a plain yellow mustard was wonderful... I also used my George Forman to grill them...a hint if you use your George Forman for any sandwich prop the front up (I use 2 small cans to do this) that way it grills it without being at an angle so it doesnt squish the sandwich that much...would also be great with mozzarella cheese.  The only reason I rated it a 4 was because of the extra mayo, even though I tossed some I still felt I put to much on each sandwich trying to use it all.

We enjoyed this sandwich. Even my 2yr old liked it and he is picky. I did cut the ingredients in half. Will make again. I even enjoyed it cold. I used butter instead of olive oil.

I totally just made this for breakfast and LOVED every bite of it, lol! I scaled the recipe to make only one sandwich, but didn't really measure anything, just eye-balled it. I used my George Foreman Grill as a sandwich press and went to town. It was GREAT! I don't really care if this is 'authentic' or not...it's one tasty sandwich and I will be making it often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Authentic or not, this is a great sandwich. I agree that there was a surplus of the mayo mixture. I'll cut it in half the next time. I used a heavy cast iron skillet as a sandwich press ~ it worked like a charm.

I prefer pork loin slices to turkey, so that's what I used. I baked my own rolls and used the extra mayo / Italian dressing for a dipping sauce, because our local deli does that for their grinders and we have become addicted to it. If you try that, slice the rolls into very skinny wedges to make it easier to dip.

Want authentic? Use pork instead of turkey, skip the Italian dressing, and use Cuban rolls.

Amazing! I added tomatoes and they were perfect. I recommend squishing the bread down before putting anything into it in order to flatten the top a bit, followed by cooking the bottom first.  They were a bit messy to eat but well worth it.

OK, so maybe this isn't "authentic," but it's a pretty decent sandwich nonetheless. My hubs and I had a heavy lunch (Giordano's Chicago-style deep dish pizza... yummm!!!) and it's been hotter than heck here in the Midwest. We were both a little hungry around dinnertime, but not for super filling fare or anything that required heating up the stove. This fit the bill perfectly. To ease prep, I used my panini press, but that didn't work out too well for me. :( My press flattened each sandwich so much so that the fillings oozed out the sides! Other than this slight mishap, I had no issues with the recipe itself. NOTE: You can reduce the amount of mayo mixture by half and still have more than enough to slather on your sandwiches. I halved this recipe (and the mayo mixture), but still ended up wasting over half of it. I also think the mustard can be reduced by half (i.e. half a T per sandwich). Another observation? Use a wire whisk to mix your mayo / Italian dressing. Mixing with a spoon will do, but your mayo will appear curdled because the oil wasn't properly incorporated (yuck!). Served with black bean soup, sweet potato chips and cuban mojitos, this was a fun Saturday night meal. Thanks for sharing, Maruchy! :-)

I made this for my husbands lunch w/o telling him what I was making. After taking his first bite his words were 'WOW this is delicious!" I love when I can make something that is super easy & still get fabulous comments on how good it is!! Thank you for a great recipe. I will certainly be making this again..

Love these sandwiches! This is such an easy recipe to follow, and uses basic ingredients. I used some leftover pork roast instead of ham, and some deli turkey meat. Came out GREAT! Thanks for sharing!

I, too, severely cut back on the mayo--just a quick swipe on each sandwich.  We opted out of the olive oil too, since we used our George Foreman grill.  A little Pam and you were good to go.  The fam really liked the sandwich and they were so easy!

Serve with sandwich pick inserted, otherwise the sandwich slides apart while eating it. It was a winner with my family. I agree with others, it only needs half the amount of mayo/italian dressing.

This was delicious! I thought it was restaurant quality. I never had this sandwich before and have no concern about it's authenticity. However, I didn't at all understand the ingredient amounts. So, I just did them all to taste. The only thing I didn't have was the turkey, so I left that out. I used 4 large slices of bread from a Tuscan round loaf. I couldn't understand if the Italian dressing was the liquid kind or the dry packets. I used a Kraft Tuscan Italian bottled dressing. I mixed some up to taste in some lite mayo. I did about 1-2 Tblsp on 2 slices and put a small amount of dijon mustard on the other pieces of bread. I put 2 slices of square ham and 1.5 slices of baby swiss with about 5 hamburger dills each on the mayo slices. To cook it in, I just used about 1 Tblsp. of olive oil. It made the sandwich so much crispier than butter. I am not sure why anyone would need 1/2 cup of olive oil or the full cup of mayo. That seems extremely excessive. My sandwich was still plenty moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. TY

Delish!! I used fat free mayo, which I seasoned up with dty italian salad dressing mix. I had some yummy herb foccaccia that I used for the hoagie rolls. I bought some deli honey turkey since others have mentioned the traditional bread is a bit sweet, added a little deli ham, lefrover pork tenderloin and used a laughing cow swiss cheese wedge. I added in some mustard, kosher dills and instead of the oil, I sprayed my pan with cooking spray.  I had this with a salad with beans and a little rice along with some mixed greens and really enough my dinner.

This was a wonderful sandwich...I made it for my boyfriend and another couple.  I added bacon like suggested by some other reviewers, and had provolone cheese instead of swiss (I don't like swiss cheese) and went from there by the recipe...It was a wonderful, quick dinner and was great with the black bean soup.  The only other bad reviews I saw was towards the name of it, which I don't care what it is called as long as it is good...and by how much mayo there was.  Well, you get to pick how much mayo goes onto the sandwich and the rest of it can be used with any other sandwich you need to make (I make a bunch since I pack my own lunch for work, so for me it worked out great).

I used a loaf of Italian bread split in half and buttered on both sides per a previous review.  I have a large cafe sandwich press and it worked great on this sandwich.  I mixed the mayo, mustard and dressing together and used a dipping sauce...wow!  So simple and so GOOD!  Thanks!

Didn't care for the turkey, mayo or Italian dressing on this sandwich and never saw it on a Cuban menu with 2 words instead of one 'medianoche'. I'll go back to just mustard and get rid of the turkey and put in the pork like it's supposed to be.

This was a good sandwich! We changed it up a little...I rubbed olive oil along the top half of the panini and sprinkled whole rosemary leaves for additional flavor. My husband also added horseradish to his mayo. We only used turkey ham, not turkey and ham, lol. Will be making again. Thank you!

Quick and easy solution for dinner. Hub's was on wheat bread and he did mine on a tortilla (less carbs).  Next time will use the flip side of the waffle iron, flat griddles for panini.  Didn't think of that at the time but should be perfect.  Thanks!

What a great sandwich! I cut the sauce in half (1/2 cup mayo-2 1/2 Tbsp Italian dressing-and just mixed in the 2 Tbsp mustard instead of spreading it alone)Cooked them on my George Foreman grill and they were so good! We will be having these often.

Fun sandwich.  Quick & easy to build.  The pickles are key.  I pressed it in the Foreman Grill.  Great results.

Sounds like a great sammy!  And this is a pretty light version...which means the 'real deal' is sinful!!  Gotta have PORK, baby.  No mayo either; it's the pickle juice that steams the whole thing.  Used to stand on Calle Ocho and eat these with a slug of Cuban coffee.  *sigh* Bonita!  But I've made this version and it's AWESOME!

These were easy and really good.  I broiled them open face for a few minutes. We don't really like pickle slices but I did want the pickle flavor so I added 2 tablespoons dill pickle relish to the spread.  I also just mixed the mustard in with the spread to make for faster and easier preperation. They were great!!! Oh, I had a ton of the spread leftover... could easily be halved.

The first time I made it I didn't put on mustard and pickels and it was OK. I made it again and put those two things on with all the other ingrediants and it was PERFECT. I am a sandwich eater and very picky about them. This is my favorite.  Thank you!

Super easy yummy sandwich.   I used my cast iron skillet as a weight and it made the sandwich extra flat.   I definatly think the recipe is more for 8 sandwiches.  And use pickles - even if you're not a big fan - it adds just the best bite!  My only problem was that my cheese wasn't all the way melted the first time.  I used shredded swiss the second time I made this, and it worked perfectly.  So make sure you use shredded cheese (shred your own).  Altogether, I loved this recipe!  Thanks.

Authentic Cuban sandwich or not, it was just delightful!  I used Creole mustard for a little extra kick and also added a few leftover slices of salami so they wouldn't go to waste.  As long as you use the mayo/dressing combo and cook it as described, I think most any combination of meats & cheeses your family likes will be a big hit.

The recipe seems so simple, but the combination is excellent.  My only suggestion is that you can use a lot less mayo and Italian dressing mixture, it made way too much.

I can't believe I am giving a sandwich 5 stars, but I am.  This is a great way to use up holiday turkey and ham.  The mayo/Italian dressing is surprisingly delicious.  I used up some Hawaiian rolls, which were very, very good and also made one on a hoagie. Again, a great way to use up leftovers.  My only issue was I used cast iron and the bread was done before the inside was hot.  In the future, I will have the meat at room temp or warmed.  Again, delish.

I joined this website for the sole purpose of giving feedback on this...wasn't quite sure on the sauce but it came together fantastically!  Although instead of turkey, we used thinly slice pork tenderloin, and then provolone (not a swiss fan).  My husband's exact words, "Now this is restaurant quality for sure".  FANTASTIC and thank you for sharing!  oh, the only thing is I only made 1/4 of the sauce, was more than plenty for two sandwiches and still have some left.

These are very, very delicious! I did sub out the Swiss for provolone- but that was mainly because my family doesn't like Swiss quite like I do. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was great! I will make this again!

Very yummy!  I made them pretty much as stated but I used ciabatta bread instead of hoagies and heated the sandwiches in the oven instead of on the stove.

These were nice and easy to make.  I loved the idea of using oil instead of butter - they grilled up perfectly.  The only ingredient/flavor that really stood out in this sandwich were the pickles, otherwise, it was kinda bland.

This is great for someone who is desperate for a little bit of Cuban taste (in the ham, pickle, mustard mostly), and otherwise just a tasty sandwich in general. I make it on the stovetop and prefer it to putting it in the oven. (I can use that very flimsy, but healthy low-cal bread and it grills up nicely). I didn't even realize it had the directions about using the plate before now, so that doesn't seem necessary IMO. As far as the mayo/dressing spread, I know it's not authentically anything (except American), but I like it just for something different... It's just me and my fiance, so I just mix up about 1/2 quantities into a small plastic container, and keep it in the fridge for a little while until we use it up... so the fact that it makes a lot, is actually convenient for us.

Good, but I do agree a cuban sandwich has pork thinly sliced and not the turkey. I used ceasar dressing on it instead of the italian dressing mix.  This was tasty and filling.

Traditionally it's served on a sweet potatoe loaf bread and it makes all the difference. Also never heard of italian dressing it's normally just miracle whip, mayo, and pickles. Bread is buttered, lightly toasted and then you put your sandwich together and press it in a hot plate press. YUM

Delicious!  We used left over spiral cut ham because that's what we had on hand.  Next time, I'll make less mayo/dressing mixture because we had quite a bit left over.

These were pretty good. I used them on my George Foreman grill with a little pressure. I just like that I can customize it for each person. I could only fit 2 sandwiches on at a time so it was difficult to have everyone's done at the same time and still hot...but a nice change of pace!! Thanks!!

This was not bad at all.  My hubby liked them more than I did, but I think it was just a matter of taste.  We did end up with WAY too much of the mayo mixture.  Would probably cut that in half next time.

well, even though this sandwich tastes NOTHING like a cuban sandwich (i am not even cuban i know know that) but it's a pretty freaking good sandwich nevertheless. i baked it first (open faced) and then fried it on both sides afterward to give it a crispy bun. very yummy and will make again!

Needed something quick for dinner a few weeks ago. Husband had gaming night, and eldest son had pep band. was delicious. I don't have a panini machine so I used my griddle and a cast iron skillet to flatten sandwich. Served with coleslaw and put pickle on the side.

This sandwich is so easy and so tasty. We lived in Miami for a few years and got really used to having media noche whenever we wanted. Now that we're in Germany, we've been missing it and were really happy to find this recipe. We eat it all the time and it's a great quick lunch.

I'm always looking for new kinds of grilled cheese. I admit that I was skeptical when I started assembling it.....mayo, Italian dressing and pickles on a HOT sandwich? No. It works. And it's SO good. The only thing I changed was using butter to fry the sandwich. I will be adding this to my "Must Make Again" recipe pile. Yum, yummy, yummy, yum.

Wow, just delicious!!  LOVE these and make them on a regular basis, but they can be made easier than directed.  Make sure to combine the mayo, italian dressing and mustard all together.  Also, I have made these using a foil-wrapped pan as a press and there is no need for this.  Just use a spatula and press hard...this gives you more control and I found that the meat/cheese does not squish out this way.  My dad loves Cuban sandwiches and said that this version was one of his favorites!  This recipe yeilds the same taste and style of a real Cuban sandwich without having to use all that nasty pork that's on authentic Cuban sandwiches.  SO delicious! Served up with either sweet potatoe fries or black bean soup and you can't go wrong!!

This is a great sandwich!  Only gets 4 stars though because the amounts called for, for basically every ingredient!, are WAY too much!  We used turkey, ham, and swiss as called for, but used a regular amount - 4-6 slices of each meat and 1-2 slices of cheese, depending on the person and size of bread.  We used 1/4 amount of everything for the "condiment" and it was enough for entire loaf of ciabatta's worth of sandwiches (literally).  We also used dill pickle sandwich stackers.  The second time we had this, we wrapped in foil and let everything warm through and the cheese melt and it was even better than the cold sandwich!  Highly recommend for a great twist on sandwiches!

I made this sandwich for company last week and everyone loved it.  Also, I had doubled the recipe and had some left over.  Yesterday I wrapped it in aluminum foil and reheated it slowly in the oven.  It tasted better than before.  Please try this it is  so good.

These sandwiches were awesome!!! My husband and I enjoyed them for a quick dinner one night.  I used Ciabatta rolls for the buns.  The hard crusty bread is what makes them sooooo good.

Had a recipe for Cuban Sandwich, but will now use this one instead. Husband said this one wasn't dry like the other. Did cut down on the mayo, like others suggested.

Delicious - didn't need that much mayo mixture.  The pickle is a nice addition to the sandwich.  Both my husband and I enjoyed this dish.

Excellent sandwich!  Didn't change a thing.  Will definitely make again.  Only suggestion, 1/2 the mayo dressing combo is more than enough.

This is an awesome traditional Cuban Sandwich. Most Cubans (especially here in Miami) prepare it with thinly sliced pork instead of the Turkey. This is the more traditional way to make it. :)

This recipe is definitely authentic.  I visited Cuba a few years ago, and one of the things my girlfriends and I said when we got home was "I wish I knew how to make those little sandwiches they serve at the coffee bar after midnight."  As soon as I saw this recipe...well, thanks for the trip down memory lane!

REALLY GOOD!!! I will definitely make this again! I used rye bread since we had it around.  About the fat content, if you follow the recipe as it says it will certainly have a lot of fat.  1/4 cup of mayo for each sandwich, olive oil, cheese, and the meats all are very fatty.  I tried to lighten it up.  I used a smart balance spread instead of olive oil, used light mayo and mustard as a spread, and went easy on the meat and cheese.  I didn't feel like it was missing anything!!

Delicious; enjoyed by kids and adults at a picnic. They are very easy to make, and came out with great result. Cut back on the mayo as 1 cup is a lot for just a few people, but otherwise followed perfectly. Thanks for sharing.

Very good sandwich. The mayo/dressing combination makes an ordinary ham/turkey and cheese great. The grilled bread turned out nice and crispy. Didn't use mustard because we don't care for it. My family really enjoyed this sandwich.

Sorry, didn't think this was anything special...kind of a glorified ham/cheese sandwich melt.  The recipe made way too much mayo sauce for our tastes.

Like others have pointed out this is not authentic but it is very good. I used leftover pork loin & ham from the deli counter as my meats in the sandwhich. I halved the mayo & salad dressing. I also added the mustard in the mayo mixture, it is pointless no to. I cooked these for 2 min on the George Foreman grill. Make again. Thank you.

Very good sandwiches with a few modifications- we use ham and leftover pork loin, and either mustard or mayonnaise, or both. As is or even with these modifications, these are great sandwiches!

Super yummy and very easy to make. I used my george foreman grill to make cooking easier. Kinda made the ingredients slip around, next time I'll use a non-slanted grill.

I only made half of the mayo/dressing spread and I still didn't need all of it. There's nothing special to this sandwich. I only ate half of one and gave the rest to my dogs.

George Foreman grill is perfect for this.  I used sliced Italian bread to reduce the amount of bread and to have smaller mini-sandwiches.  We also used the sauce as a dip for the sandwiches which was excellent.

These sandwiches are soooooo yummy!  My husband and two kids really loved them!  I usually make some changes to recipes to kind of make them my own, but there really was no need to do that with these!  I am not a huge fan of mustard and pickles on my regular sandwiches, but this time I didn't omit them from this and I am really glad that I didn't.  By coating your bread with olive oil it really gives it a yummy flaky texture.  I also put a heavy can from the cupboard on top of the plate to give it a little extra weight.  The dressing mix is divine and the pickles really make the sandwich what it is - PERFECT!!!!  Thanks for a great recipe we will be making this all the time!

I just tried this and I love it!  I am trying to do low carb so I used a low carb tortilla and cooked it in the G. Foreman.  It would be heavenly with bread!!  One thing I used that made it  fast & easy was the Oscar Mayer sub kit layered with ham & turkey.  I find it less expensive than buying it from the deli.  Thanks!!

I tried this as suggested and found that we like it the more traditional way.  Without the mustard, mayo or salad dressing.  You will proably not find Cuban bread so the best substition is fresh French Bread.  Simply butter both sides of the bread (the inside not the outside), add the pork (which we had leftover from Sunday's meal), ham and swiss - add the pickle slices.  Spray some Pam or oil in skillet and lightly brush some oil on both outer sides of the bread.  Cook over medium heat for about 2 mins.on both sides. I use my cast iron skillet as a weight.  We serve mustard and mayo on the side for dipping.

Best sandwich I have ever made! Per another, used less mustard and also mixed it in with the mayo and italian dressing mix.  Great creative and mix and match a variety of meat and cheeses (and perhaps other toppings such as lettuce, red onion, green bell pepper slices, pepperonicini, etc...) This recipe will appear many times throughout the football season (and many times thereafter)! Thank you Maruchy!

Very tasty.  I especially liked the sauce, but cut back on the quantity of the sauce.  It still had plenty of flavor without being excessively messy.

My family and I absolutely loved this sandwich!
Be careful not to burn, you may want to turn a little sooner than two minutes. I will definately make again.

These were absolutely wonderful!  My family is so hard to please especially when it comes to trying new things and they loved them!  My daughter said they were "tré belle"!  We will definitely be making these again!

Exactly what I was looking for!!!   I tried one of these sandwiches at a festival this summer and fell in love. I will have to agree with other reviews that the mayo/dressing makes too much for what is used. But that's okay I'll make more sandwiches tomorrow. (I also added the mustard to the mix, made no sense not to). Followed exactly as written, with one change from another recipe on this site I added sliced Porchetta. (Pork loin). Yummy!!!

SO good. We had some leftover Cuban pork roast that I used for the meat. I sliced a little off the top and bottom of the rolls to soften the bread and lessen the amount of carbs. They kept well in the fridge, and I looked forward to eating them for lunch every day.

This sandwich gave me life.  I loved it.  I did cut down on the mustard and I added slices of Roma tomatoes.   Those tomatoes were everything.  I will be cooking this again tonight.

Wow!  This is so easy and so tasty.  The mayo and Italian dressing definitely make the sandwich.  I used Havarti cheese because it's my personal favorite.  Will be making these for drop by guests.

I grilled the bread first, then added the meats, swiss cheese and toppings (Italian-mayo on one side and mustard on the other. After putting the sandwich together, I put it in the microwave on high for 30-20 seconds. Delicious!!

I just made this for a late lunch for myself after scaling it back to one serving. It makes way to much sauce and the Italian dressing gives it a weird flavor that I certainly would not consider Cuban. It was just okay.

YUM!  I have a daughter who is vegetarian so I made this with mushrooms and no meat. I used leftover baked ham for the rest of us meat eaters and to both versions I added mild pepper rings.  You do have a lot of leftover dressing but that's ok.....use it on another sandwich!

Yum! That was so good. Instead of using a hoagie, I actually bought Italian bread from the deli but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. The sauce was a true standout and the combination of meat and Swiss with pickles truly made this a "gourmet deli" made from the comfort of my own kitchen. This was the best sandwich I've had in a long time and I am including those from known restaurants as well.

Used a loaf of French bread and cut into 5 pieces. Cut mayo to 1/3 cup, italian dressing 3 T and added banana pepper rings.  Used foreman grill. Everyone in my family loved this sandwich, and it was quick.

Straight outta Miami! Very good sandwich, I agree the mayo/dressing sauce goes far. We used French's spicy mustard. The foreman grill made the best makeshift sandwich press! Will make again!

Made a batch of chicken noodle soup and needed a sandwich to compliment it. Scored a home run with this sandwich. The only variation was that I used a Chiabatta bread which presented a challenge because it was to thin to use in the traditional manner. The solution was I cut it in half lengthwise for thickness and then flipped the pieces so that the crust was to the inside and the exposed bread was toward the griddle which browned nicely--a great sandwich bread. Thanks for broadening my culinary and cultural horizons.

When shopping for ingredients for this sandwich I saw Boar's Head "Jamaica Jerk Turkey" behind the deli counter.  I sampled a piece and knew that this would be a huge difference maker.  Well, it was OUTSTANDING... just the right amount of kick to give this the Cuban zing that it deserves.  That's the only change I mind to this great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

Pretty good. DS dislikes mayo, so I only used a little, and mixed it with dijon mustard and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Didn't have pickles. Served on King's Hawaiian rolls and used the Foreman grill. Thanks for the post!

This isn't authentic, since it uses turkey instead of roast pork, but it's not too bad at all!  If you're making these for a crowd, wrap each sandwich in foil before heating up. That way, the skillet stays clean sandwich after sandwich. And it's easy to eat them out of hand right from the foil.

These were really good!  The blend was nice and the taste was great.  If your a sandwich eater then this is a great sandwich.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I probably won't make it a lot, but will definatly make it again.

I thought this was a great sandwich.  It was quick, easy, and tasty.  I used hamburger buns instead of hoagie rolls because that's just what I happened to have, and I also used Provolone cheese instead of Swiss because Swiss is a little strong for our liking.  I think a tomato slice would be great on this sandwich and we'll be doing that the next time we have these, which will probably later on this week!!

This gets 4 stars because I personally didn't care for these much, but the others who ate them loved them.

Excellent sandwich.  I have made several times and changed to my liking.  I skipped the mustard prefering to allow the taste of the the mayo/italian dressing to come through.  I used my italian dressing mix made with balsamic vinegar.  This would work with just about any roll.  I love how crispy the roll becomes!

I used 1/2 the amount of mayonnaise and italian dressing.  This was good, a nice alternative to the boring sandwich.

I substituted sliced pork loin for the turkey and mixed the 3 condiments all together (as others had suggested). I grilled them on my panini press and my family gobbled them up!!!

My husband and I love this recipe!  The only variation I make is to use provolone instead of swiss cheese since neither of us care for swiss.  We make these for lunch or sometimes dinner along with some rice and beans.  They're great :)

These were really good. I cut back on the sauce mixture, and couldn't get the insides warm by pan-frying so I moved them from the pan to the oven to broil them open-faced. The result was great, because everything was warm and melty but the hoagie was still nice and crispy-toasted on the outside. It's just a bit more of a process than originally planned...

This sandwich is absolutely delicious! We got turned on the Cuban sandwich several years ago. And whenever we are in Spanish countries that have it on the menu it is a must get. This sandwich is just about as good as eating it there!

I really liked the sandwich spread and will probably use it on other kinds of sandwiches. Since I had leftover Easter ham, the deli turkey was a better alternative to pork. For a touch of sweetness that I couldn't get from Cuban bread (unavailable in my area) I used bread-and-butter pickles. Grilled on a pannini press and enjoyed! Thanks for a great idea.

I made this for my sons who are hard to please.  I changed from mayo to salad dressing and instead of italian dressing since I didn't have it, I used caesar dressing.  My sons loved it and it was easy and quick to make for dinner

These were quite tasty!  Like some of the readers here, I halved the mayo(fat free).  1 cup is way too much for 4 hoagies.  Very simple and easy to make.

GREAT SANDWICH!  My hubby and I both loved this easy sandwich.  The only change I made was using Provolone instead of Swiss since that's what we had! This recipe is a staple in our home!

absolutely loved this simple sandwich!!  I used 1/2 c mayo, 5T italian dressing, and 2T mustard.  We thought it was just the right amount of everything.  So much wonderful flavor you barely noticed the meat and cheese.  Thank you!!

Very tasty sandwich. Didn't change anything. Only observation was (along with other reviewers), recipe made far too much mayo dressing. As well, 2 min. both sides did not melt the Swiss. Perhaps lower temp for 3-4 min per side. Served it up with Black Bean Soup - GREAT combination!

This sandwich reminded our family of one of our favorite sandwiches at "Potbelly" - the "Wreck". I made one huge sandwich on a loaf of French bread and baked it openfaced in the oven until hot. I brushed the outside with a bit of olive oil first. Oh, I also added a little roast beef and used less than 1/3 cup mayo + 2-3 T. dressing. I thought it could have used some more of the mayo spread mixture, so will up it to 1/2 cup for a big French loaf. I don't care if it is truly Cuban, or not - but it is a truly great sandwich!

My husband and I love the Cuban sandwichs at a local restruant.  This recipe is not exactly authentic, but I've made 3 for myself within the last 4 days, so that just shows how good and easy they are!!  I've heated mine on my GF grill with excellent results and no problems.

Fast, easy - and so good you can easily serve as a dinner. Black beans and platains work great as sides.

Yum! I love the pickles in this. I, too, used the Foreman grill and it worked perfectly. Instead of hoagie rolls I used this new bagel bread that was really nice. I used the already sliced pickle strips to make this a cinch to put together.

Awesome!  I loved these!  My husband wasn't quite as excited about them as I was, he thought they were a bit greasy.  I may have used too much oil on the buns when I warmed em.  Anyway, I loved them! They're great reheated too!

These were really good.  Next time, I think I will use less meat, though.  And I did not need a whole cup of mayo for this recipe - that was way too much.

My picky husband raved about this recipe.  We used to live in Miami and my husband said this tastes just like he remembers.  This is a keeper.  The only change I made was to   use 

1 can of black beans.

Delicious, the best cuban I've ever had. The sauce was a perfect compliment!  I had to cut the sauce in half since I ran out of mayo, but it was still great.

This was pretty good.  I used a loaf of Italian bread cut in half instead of hoagie rolls.  I thought there was too much mayo, next time I plan to use half.  This is perfect to serve at a party.

This sandwich was AMAZING.  Very good, easy to make, and quick--what else could you ask for in a meal?  The only thing I will do differently next time is cook the sandwich on Low instead of Medium, allowing the meat and cheese to get warm before the bread is done.

This was very tasty as is, but if I were to make it again, I would probably add some red onion, and maybe a slice of extra-sharp Cheddar. I made this on the Foreman grill, and it worked really well. Thanks!

I took the term "layer" a little too literally and ended up trying to press down on a sub sandwich with the plate! Next time I will do only one layer of meat and cheese. Overall, taste of the sandwich was really good. Would make it again.

This was a good twist on traditional sandwiches. The crispy bread complimented the heated meat and cheese wonderfully. I don't think it's anything to rave about, but overall it was pretty good.

Oh my gosh this recipe is awesome!!  Fast, easy and unbelievably delicious.  We used our small counter top George Foreman grill... put the sandwich in, closed the lid and cooked for two minutes.  It cooks it and squashes it perfectly. Makes a better Media Noche than our local deli! Will use this recipe ALOT!

This is the best sandwich I have ever had.  I am not a fan of mayo or pickles but tried them anyway.  I now never make this sandwich without both those ingredients.  It's fantastic!  This recipe is worth all five stars.

This was excellent.  I only made half the mayo mixture and then only used about half of that. (I also used light mayo). I just don't like that much on my sandwich.  I also used Pam to coat the bread before grilling and it worked great.  Pickle adds a great flavor.  These were really, really good.  My kids even loved them!  I grilled mine on the George Foreman grill which gave them that "compression" factor.  MMMM!

I had a similar sandwich at a Cuban restaurant in Florida and have always wanted to try to make it at home. Well, I tried it out tonight...first of all, I found one cup of mayo plus the Italian dressing and the mustard to be way to abundant.  The sandwiches were so wet and slippery, they fell apart in the skillet.  I shoved everything back in and tried again.  The first sandwich was a slimy gooey mess.  By the time got to the third one, I cut way back on the wet stuff and it turned out much better. That one went to my husband.  He added a little more mayo and mustard
when he sat down to eat and it turned out just fine.  They were very tasty, and when I make them again, I will experiment and try to come up with a way to make them a little neater (perhaps I will invest in a sandwich press)!

This was a VERY good sandwich.  I followed the recipe as stated except for leaving off the pickle (personal preference...I don't like them) and I made them on whole wheat hamburger buns, b/c thats all I had on hand.  I look foward to making them again on a whole wheat hoagie (we don't eat much white bread)and I might use a different kind of cheese b/c the swiss I bought took a long time to melt.  Very good sandwich though!

Great sandwich, Maruchy.  One bad rating because of the name?  Go figure!  Just call it Midnight Sandwich and try it because it is very good.  The next time I make this I am going to leave out the pickle and add sautéed onions.  Can't wait!

This recipe would have gotten five stars based on taste alone. It was also very simple to make and filling, BUT I made the mistake of serving it when we had Cubans over to the house and I learned that a REAL CUBAN sandwich does not have mayonaisse or italian dressing or turkey. It was DELICIOUS though!

I haven't the faintest idea what a Cuban Sandwich is but no matter the name this is tasty, easy and versatile. I followed some of the other reviewers and cooked them on the George Foreman Grill. I sloshed quite a bit of the mayo/italian on, only a little messy and as per other reviewers cut down on mustard by a tbl. and mixed it in. Instead of brushing olive oil on rolls I brushed on grapeseed/garlic oil - it is excellent.

This was great! My fiance and I loved it! I will make it again, but I will leave out the ham. I don't really like ham, but as a novice, I wanted to follow the recipe and give it a chance first. The ham didn't really take away from the sandwich. The only thing I didn't like about this was all of the fat in it. I suppose you can substitute regular for fat-free. This was a very filling lunch!

I do Have to agree with the guy about this not being an authentic Media Noche' pork, not turkey, Cuban bread not regular bread, butter, on  one side, Mustard, mayo on the other side flat sandwich press, etc. it's a good sandwich but it's not a Media Noche' (Midnight Sandwich);Source:   Authentic Cuban food lover

I followed this recipe as written with two substitutions--I used regular sandwich bread & Muenster cheese because that's what I had on hand.  For all of us, this was only "meh".  Fine for a one time thing, but none of us wanted to have it again.  I was a little sad about that because I love an authentic Cuban sandwich, but this was not it.  Also, the mayo/Italian dressing combo made a ton.  I will likely use the excess as a starter for a pasta salad this week.

I liked it. It might sound silly but I used salami as my meat. I know its not the true way of a Cuban sandwich but that's the type of lunch meat I enjoy in sandwiches. I mostly wanted to use this recipe for the addition of swiss cheese and the condiment that along with it. The added cheese was so so. Maybe not one of my favourite cheeses. I enjoyed the condiment. I added some fresh dill to it, to enhance the dill flavour from the pickles. It turned out good. Overall I did like the sandwich, found out that I am not a big fan on adding swiss cheese to sandwiches but did find a new condiment addition for other sandwiches. And I always love a good pickle to any sandwich!

This is not a traditional Cuban sandwich, however it is still a delicious sandwich that comes together pretty quickly. I used a griddle and pressed several sandwiches with a cookie sheet, this way I was able to make several sandwiches at once.

Really tasty and  a breeze to make.   I found that two minutes per side on my commercial grade stove was a bit too long, but the sandwiches weren't ruined....just a tad darker than I'd like.  I just made two, cut the recipe by 3/4s and was very pleased.  I used leftover ham and smoked turkey breast and since I was out of that bright yellow stuff, I used Dijon mustard.  Also just used part of a huge jar of hamburger dills for the pickles and they worked fine.

Will definitely make it again! Didn't have the Italian dressing. Mixed a little Olive oil with mayonnaise, fresh lemon juice and minced fresh garlic together for the spread. Placed in my Panini sandwich machine and achieved deliciousness! Thanks to the contributor.

These were terrific.  Made by the recipe.  Used my pizza pan and large cast iron skillet.  Came out great.  I will be using this recipe often!

it was a really good sandwich!  it was personally too much sauce for me, but ill just use half the amount next time. flavor was fantastic. oh, and instead of doing it in the pan, i wrapped them individually in foil and put them on the george foreman grill pressing down.

The recipe makes quite a bit of the mayo mix.  We do not mix the mustard with the mayo because I think the mustard flavor gets lost.  We love this recipe and make it fairly often.

Use ciabatta bread instead of the hoagie roll and will use sliced deli pork or thin sliced left over pork roast in place of the turkey.  Had some problems weighing down the sandwich on my electric griddle at first but got it mastered the second time around.  Nice sandwich change up.

It is a wonderful sandwich...when I want to wow my grown twin sons this is the sandwich...so wonderful...I lived in Fla when I first fixed it for them...and I had real Cuban Bread..it was every where...but here in OHIO I used either Everything Italian or Boboli bread...and it's still wonderful...I serve it with pickled beets ...my touch...and let them chose the pickles...and good chips..

This was a great sandwich.  it's easy and quick to put together, and it is all around yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was posted, as it was the first time trying it.  The next time, I may try a little something different.

This recipes was fantastic! SUPER easy, flavorful, and a nice break from traditional meals (for our family anyway) My only thing to mention, is this makes a TON of sauce... I halved the recipe, and ended up using 1/2 of the already halved amount of sauce.... and the sandwich was just dripping! Some people really like that, but I couldn't taste much more than that, so just wiped a little off and it was perfection!

Excellent sandwich! We've made this several times now, I can't believe I've never gotten around to rating this, we have switched this up several times according to what's in the fridge, pastrami is a great alternative and the flavor with the sauce is amazing!

this sandwich is good- I said I would never make this again no matter how good- because it was so messy to make....I have revised my opinion now that I have tasted it! 4 stars-but yes- maybe substitute pork for the turkey. I also used a loaf of french bread instead of hoagie buns- I cut the loaf of french bread in half for 2 humongous sandwiches- decided after they were cooked, they could each be divided in half again for 4 very large sandwiches, or even 6 regular sandwiches. yummy! I used an electric skillet with a griddle on top to press and used coconut oil to fry in.

As an amateur cooker, this looked both easy and delicious. I made it today and it was a hit with the family! It's very hard to find something everyone in this house likes. What made it even better is that my super-picky grandmother kept raving about it! It's definitely a meal I will be making again, especially on rushed nights. Cutting the amount of mayo, mustard and Italian dressing down is also advisable-- I ended up wasting most of what it asked for!

Didn't have bread so I made this with tortillas. I spread the sauce on one tortilla, placed another tortilla on top of it, arranged the ham, cheese, and pickle, and folded the tortillas in half. I baked them for about ten minutes on 350.

While I didn't use turkey or olive oil, and I had way too much sauce, this is so delicious. Half of my family (including myself) don't normally like several of the ingredients (swiss cheese, italian dressing, mustard, mayonnaise), but we loved this.

I needed something that used the ingredients in my refrigerator and took very little time, so this was perfect. I'm sure it tastes even better as originally written.

Fantastic sandwich. I used a little less mustard and Italian dressing in mayo for our preference, easy to adjust. By the way, I used less mayo too.

These sandwiches were okay, but the flavor of the Italian dressing threw me off - it didn't feel authentic. I would not make these again.

Yummy! My family loved these sandwiches. I halved the sauce like others and had some leftover. I also mixed the mustard into the sauce. The sauce was so good. I used the Good Seasonings Italian dressing, and mixed as directed.

I was looking for a recipe for left over roasted turkey breast. This is a fantastic sandwich! I've made authentic cuban sandwiches before, and never thought of using turkey! The mayo, italian dressing sauce is great,(you can add a little horseradish)! Served these with roasted red potatoes, and everyone enjoyed the extra sauce on the potatoes! Great Recipe!

Made it at home for my roommates, and it was great.  Added in a few changes though: I mixed in some spanish paprika and ground annatto seeds with the mustard, which gave it a bit stronger taste - I also used spicy mustard for some extra kick.  For the meats, I stuck with the turkey and used virginia ham, but I made up some pulled pork the day before and mixed the mustard into that.  It may not be a "true" Cuban sandwich, but it still came out delicious...isn't that all that matters?

This was a very tasty sandwich with a unique combination of flavors.  I just made one sandwich for my lunch so just added the ingredients to taste.  And no rolls; I just used whole wheat bread.  This was lovely, and I wil make it again.

This was an okay recipe for me.  It was a nice quick meal and that's always good but it wasn't my favorite combination.  I'm not crazy about mustard so  maybe if I made the sauce without it I would like it better.  Also, not crazy about the dill pickles.  My husband really liked the sauce and the sandwich but we made his without the pickles too.  He liked the sauce so much that he had me make extra to have the next day on his ham and cheese.  We will try these again only I may change a little to everyone's taste.

This is an excellent sandwich! I didn't use the mustard on it (I am not a mustard lover) but it didn't matter, I loved it.  Thanks so much for sharing.  I will use this every time I make deli sandwiches from now on. Delicious!

I used what I had on hand, which wasn't exactly what the recipe called for but came pretty close, otherwise, it probably would have gotten all 5 stars. Even though it wasn't exactly to the recipe, it was still a great sandwich. Thanks!

These were good. I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you for sharing! I will enjoy making/eating these again! I used my George Forman grill. Instead of an attractive panini-style sandwich with grill marks I got sad looking smashed mess (that tasted delicious). I will have to work on my presentation. :-)

Very tasty, tastes just like the sandwich that a cuban woman I know makes. I made a few changes, though (who doesn't?). I used honey mustard, which gave the sandwich some sweetness, and I used Frank RedHot as a dipping sauce. The flavors of the sandwich were great. Thanks!

These sandwiches were fantastic! Despite a few other reviews suggesting using less than the 1 cup mayo the recipe calls for, I made it exactly as written. Having said that, I will definitely be using way less mayo next time, probably 1/4 to 1/3 cup. Aside from the extra mayo leftover after assembling the sandwiches, the only other change I made was a minute one-- I opted to use canola oil spray rather than brushing the rolls with olive oil. They crisped up nicely on the stove & I used the suggested plate wrapped in foil to apply pressure. My husband and son raved about these. We will most definitely be making these again! Thanks for a great submission.

Big hit for our Cuban Themed dinner!  I had a "make your own" bar for picky eaters and used yogurt instead of Mayo.  Also took the advise and used the George Forman grill.  Tip - use pam or other spray and hold the top down.  I have the big GF grill and it fit three sandwiches, but we held down the top and then flipped and rotated the sandwiches after a few minutes.  Served with plantians, beans and rice!

I'm really not a sandwich person so I rated it a 3 but my husband loves sandwiches and rated it a 5. I put a lot of the mayo mixture on each sandwich and still had a bunch left over so you don't need that much. I also made mine with ciabatta bread an cooked it on a panini grill. Great for Saturday lunches.

One of our standard 'go-to' recipes when we don't feel like cooking a whole meal for dinner- and one of the greatest weekend lunches.  We modify a little- russian/ thousand island dressing for the 'sauce' part of the sandwich.  A truly delicious classic!

Delicious. Fixed it Sunday night (Desperate Housewives night) for the girls with some black bean soup and Italian margaritas. Everyone asked for the recipe. The mixture of Italian dressing with mayonaise is genuis! Fixed it as written, except added some sliced tomatoes and red onions with the pickles. Burnt my first one, but after turning the heat down to little under medium, the rest came out perfect!

These were very tasty!  My boys loved them and had fun squishing them in the pan.  I used a nonstick Calphalon grill pan so we took it easy on the olive oil.  I think next time I will also halve the mayo mix.  As delicious as it is it was just too much mayo for our taste.  Overall, very yummy, quick and kid-helper friendly!

I love this sandwich!!! This was really easy to make and only took a few minutes to throw together with the help of my two year old.  I've made this a few times now and my family loves it. I've started using Good Seasons make-at-home italian dressing instead of bottled and it really makes it that much better.  Since my children are young I make some on regular sliced bread and that seems to work better for little hands.  We'll be having this for a long time to come...

I just loved this sandwich!!Deceptively simple recipe. I am not a normal fan of "cuban sandwiches", but this was delicious. My husband used dijon mustard and we agree the mayo/dressing really makes it tasty. I'm saving this recipe!

I made one modification and that was to eliminate the pickles - only because I don't care for them.  The sandwich without the pickles was excellent and very easy to make.  Great for a quick and casual dinner.

Good, quick dinner.  The pickles add a lot to the sandwhich!  I wasn't watching very carefully and they got a little over-done, but still tasted fine.

I don't care if these are authentic cuban sandwiches or not...they are VERY good.  We left out the italian dressing, and cut the mayo/mustard in half.  Used provolone instead of swiss and used french rolls.  I used my cast iron skillet as a weight.  I could not believe how incredible and incredibly easy these sandwiches are!

Great tasting and easy to throw together.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding red onion and grilling the sandwiches on my indoor grill which made it like a panini.  we'll do this one again for sure.

I made this sandwich for a "food day" at work.  It was a huge hit. I customized it by using tomato-balsmic hoagie rolls and provelone cheese instead of regular bread and swiss.  I also skipped the mustard and pickles so the diners could add them if they preferred them. I have had them requested on "food days" many times since the first time.

This was a great change from the ordinary sandwich.  You do not have to mix the mayo and Italian dressing together before spreading it on the bread; simply spreading the mayo and drizzling the dressing inside makes the sandwich tasty and keeps you from having to wash a bowl!  Swiss was not on sale so I used provolone instead, and the sandwich was still incredible.  My husband and I will be making this again and again!

Turned out great, I make one to take to work for lunch a couple of times a week. I don't like mustard, so I used good quality honey mustard and it was fantastic. I would, however, recommend using low sodium meats as everything does turn out pretty salty if you're concious of those kind of things. I definately recommend.

Outstanding!! This was sooooo good! My whole family loved these sandwiches. I love that you flatten them a bit and using the olive oil gives the bread such an amazing taste! I was leary of putting a pickle right on the sandwich because I normally don't do that but it was so good on the sandwich! Great job Maruchy!

I've always heard of Cuban sandwiches but I never knew what they were so I tried it out. It was soooo good. I followed the recipe exactly the first time but since I figure I'll eat them often I made it again but I cut down on the mayo and toasted the hoagie with the swiss cheese on it so I wouldn't have to use the olive oil. Delicious!

These sandwiches were great!  My four year old even loved them.  I followed the recipe exactly but used my George Forman grill to cut the time and clean up.  This is an easy, quick meal that doesn't even take 15 minutes.  Perfect for busy nights.

What a quick and yummy recipe! To cut down on dirty dishes, next time I'll spread the mayo and Italian directly onto the sandwiches instead of mixing them in a separate bowl.

This was excellent! I ran out of regular Italian dressing one time, so I used creamy Italian and it was just as excellent.

So simple and delicious. I used reduced fat mayo and cut way back on the amounts used and it was still great. Also used my George Foreman grill as previously mentioned, and I wouldn't do it any other way! My husband was impressed and wanted to know where I got the recipe!

Excellent blend of flavors. I used full packet (.6 oz) of Good Seasons Zesty Italian; unsure if it's 5 tbsp but it was flavorful & will do again.Unsure how much meat,cheese to layer with so I kept it light and everyone loved it. That left me with alot of leftover meat & cheese, may reduce in the future. Altogether a keeper!

Very quick and delicious.  I took the advice of using grilled onions rather than pickles, and it was fabulous.  Also, I just made them on my little double sided grill rather than using a plate to press them.  It pressed the sandwiches perfectly.  The olive oil gives the outside a nice crunch.  I will definitely make them again.

Yum yum yum.  We loved these.  I made them on my griddle, and just poured some olive oil on it, and pressed a plate on the sandwiches while they grilled.  The bread came out nice and crusty, and the smooshing seems to make the sandwiches stay together nice.  They look great, and my husband is still having a fit over how much he likes them.  My picky son even liked it, minus the pickle.

These sandwiches are fantastic! I'd never tried Cuban sandwiches before,and even though they aren't authentic Cuban,my husband requests them every day for lunch.The only change I made was less mustard. These are a keeper!

Great quick dinner sandwich.  Warning though, I used baguette style sub buns and once they had been toasted in the pan, were so crunchy that when I went to cut into one of them the filling shot out the side onto the cutting board! (I ended up with that one!)  I thought the mayo was a bit rich--but that's just personal preference.
