I loved the concept .... I made the recipe as given, using Greek Salad Dressing instead of Italian.  It was really good but needs tweeting. The zucchini was cooked perfectly.  I think I need more color of the bread crumbs when cooked.  I loved the faint mustard taste. I had to use plain GF bread crumbs so next time I will add some cheese, basil, or oregano, etc.   Just having something breaded that is so good when we are avoiding gluten is a BIG PLUS.  Thank you.

The mustard adds a nice zing to this.  Easy to make and take places.  Thank you!

This recipe is really good if you are trying to avoid using milk and egg. I wanted to try it just coz it was different - it's BAKED, not deep fried! I looooved that. Anyway, it does have a zingy taste b/c of the brown mustard and the italian dressing so it may not be for everyone. Personally, I loved it. I did try to avoid too much tanginess by adding about 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the breading mix. I would say this helped a bit. Mine were also bites because I had a rather giant zucchini to use up. I hope more people give this a try! I definitely will be bringing this to more potlucks.

Very yummy stuff. The only bread crumbs I had were a batch of homemade shake and bake so I used those. These reminded me a lot of the fried zucchini that I get at a fast food chain but a bunch healthier. Thanks for the tasty submission.

This looks really good, but I didn't like it at all.  I think the Italian dressing goes terrible with the zucchini.

I made a bunch of changes.  I didn't use the mustard.  I used yellow squash instead of zucchini.  I sliced a squash into thin discs (1/4 inch).  I coated them with italian dressing. I ran out of bread crumbs, so some of the discs ended up being coated with a mix of flour/grated parmesean.  The ones that were coated in the flour/grated parmesean where much better!  The kids actually ate it!  (I tried some with cornmeal/parmesean mix and they were the worst of the 3 types).  I baked them at 400 degrees for 30 minutes (as other recipes on-line recommended).

I make this several times a month, to use up the excess zucchini from my garden.
I see where some people have said "it is way to salty"   but nowhere in the recipe do I see where any salt is listed.

For extra crunch and lower carbs, swap the bread crumbs for crushed pork rinds.

It was a major fail for me. I’m not sure if the recipe or  my cooking skills that were way off. I haven’t been successful with zucchini.

This was good. Followed the recipe as directed, but was surprised there wasn’t more mustard flavor as all the reviews stated. I cooked them for 15 minutes, but they weren’t crisping up. I ended up drizzling melted butter over them and increasing the temp to 350 degrees. That helped. I also added salt because they were bland otherwise. I would try this again.

These were delicious. Made a few changes. My fiancée isn’t crazy about Italian dressing, so I used 2 tablespoons of mayo. I cut 2 zucchini’s into quarters, put them in a large bowl. Then I added the mayo. Next mixed them so that each zucchini piece was covered, then added a cup of plain bread crumbs, and a cup of fish fry. Again I lightly mixed until all pieces were covered, then I poured the zucchini into a baking pan lined with parchment paper. After leveling zucchini, I sprinkle top of zucchini with more breadcrumbs and fish fry (dry mix), put in oven on 400 for 30 minutes. Was a huge hit for my family!!! Came out crunchy and full of flavor.

I expected more from this recipe. Zucchini had a stronger mustard flavor than I expected and unfortunately I am not a mustard fan, I'm one of those ketchup on hot dogs people.

This was pretty good.  Next time I may make without the mustard.  I didn't see that it added much.  Certainly easy to make.

I made it  using gluten-free breadcrumbs and it turned out ok.  There was a strong mustard taste, I would use less mustard in the future.

These were pretty good but they were really salty.
