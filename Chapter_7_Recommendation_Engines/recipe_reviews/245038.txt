Instead of making one large 12 cup bundt cake, I intended to make a smaller 6 cup bundt cake and two small ones in my quartet bundt pan.  The recipe only made for one 6 cup bundt and 1 smaller quartet bundt.  Had I known that, I would have added more of the coconut filling in the 6 cup bundt; so if you are intending to make smaller bundts you may want to keep that in mind.  Also, I chose not to add the raisins but did double the pecans – personal preference, but I may try it with raisins the next time.  I dusted the cakes with a little confectioner’s sugar only to dress them up a bit.  The taste and texture was very good.
