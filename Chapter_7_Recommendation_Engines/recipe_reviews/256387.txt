We love this pasta salad! I have been making it since I first found it in his recipe box (before it was published). It's such a different style of pasta salad, but the flavors are soooo good together that it becomes addicting. This is my second go-to pasta salad recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

1.23.17  I mixed up the pasta and dressing last night, put it in the fridge, and then added all the veggies today.  The recipe author commented that you could cut back the salt and MSG, so I reduced the salt since the recipe also includes olives (just personal taste preference), but left the MSG amount as indicated.  I think the addition of the fresh lemon juice and seasoned salt (instead of regular salt) to the dressing really enhances this pasta salad, and I like the variety of all the veggies.  The tri-color rotini and all of the different ingredient colors give lovely presentation as well, lots of eye appeal.  We like pasta salad, and this is a good one.
