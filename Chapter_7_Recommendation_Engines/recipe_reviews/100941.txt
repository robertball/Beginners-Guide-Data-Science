Very good!  I added some chopped fresh rosemary to the steak before searing and served with sauteed mushrooms

I agree with the previous review that the wine and broth mixture did not add any flavor to the meat.  Going forward, I would add the mixture to the pan with the meat still in it.  The garlic butter was very tasty and we would use that again.

This was fantastic.  We're vegetarians, and substituted Morningstar Farms veggie steak strips for the meat and a veggie seasoning cube for the beef stock.  Sometimes it's hard to find a recipe that can be adapted that way, but this was just wonderful.  Thanks.

Good Stuff.  This was amazing.  I added some rosemary like another reviewer suggested and it was delicious.  Definately easy to make and worth every bit.  Thanks for the post.

Simple, yet it makes an elegant meal. The garlic butter was a big hit - we spread it on the bread too. A side of asparagus completes the dish. I loved all the flavors and will definitely make it again, perhaps adding mushrooms to the sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful. I used the wine sauce to fry the steak with, and it was delicious. The garlic butter was amazing and delicious on bread.

If I ever make this again, I will probably grill these steaks over charcoal.  I'm not a fan of pan frying steaks.  This wasn't bad but will not use the broth and wine.  It just didn't add any flavor to the meat.  However, the garlic butter was good.  My family was not impressed but I'm easy to please and enjoy trying new recipes.  The tough part is getting my family to try them.

These steaks were so good! I didn't use the reduction, but I did use the garlic butter which was fantastic on the steaks. I love the pan searing method because I always seem to over cook my steaks on the grill.

My sauce didn't turn out but I was interupted by the door bell.  The meat was excellent.  I added a little bit of fresh garlic to it while seasoning.  My husband raved about it.

This was so flavorful!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except I changed the servings to 6, and it still came out perfect!  This is quick and easy enough for a weeknight meal, and the flavor is impressive enough for entertaining.  Thank you Pam for sharing this recipe, it is a keeper!
