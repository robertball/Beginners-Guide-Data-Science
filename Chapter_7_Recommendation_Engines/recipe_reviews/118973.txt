Really loved this salad.  The flavors are such an interesting mix.   The chutney is an excellent complement to the pork and we love the sweet and salty combination of flavors.  Great way to use up leftover pork and make it a completely different meal!

This is delicious! I use this recipe whenever I have leftover pork. I make the recipe as written, except i toast the walnuts.

This was a delicious salad. I had a ton of leftover pork roast and was looking for a quick dinner.  I didn't put it in a croissant,just ate it as a salad. Yummy!!

A great way to use left over pork.  We served as a salad on iceberg lettuce.  Young and old liked it.

I made these to take to the ski hill- LOVED by all - including 7&8- so easy- best if made the night before to allow the flavours to 'marry'. I'm making them again tomorrow.

I was looking for something to make with seasoned leftover pork loin.  I found this.  Of course, I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I just left out rather than substitute.  
I made the recipe EXACTLY, omitting the chutney, ginger & croisants.
That being said, I can't imagine it being any better!  My tenderloin didn't "dice"well.  It was more like "pulled" or "shredded" which didn't change the taste.  I served on the lettuce since I didn't have croisants.  I think next time i will slice the grapes rather than halve as they were difficult for my younger children.  
   The best description is that it resembles tuna salad. 
   As I write this my 5 year old is busy scraping the last bits from the bowl onto her plate!
   This was served to 7 children ranging in age from 3 to 7. Six of the seven requested seconds.
   That's a six-star rating in my book!
