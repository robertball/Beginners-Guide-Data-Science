I usually make recipes that has a  lot of reviews but i was drawn to try this one and was NOT disappointed!!! My kids and I loved it! I added onions and fresh garlic cut into big chunks which added some crispiness to the dish. I will definitely make this again and again.

Made this for an Easter dinner side. Everyone loved it! I prefer my carrots soft, so I steamed them and then followed the recipe. Roasting time was shorter since the carrots were already cooked.

Really, really excellent and easy!  Like some other reviewers, I just tossed the garlic salt and oil together with my hands on the pan, not using the plastic bag method called for in the recipe. I also did not peel my carrots, as I love the flavor with the peel still on with carrots.

I also drizzled some really good balsamic vinegar over it before serving (after it's out of the oven) and boy, that was the finishing touch for an already awesome recipe!!  

Will make this again and again.

Roasted Parmesan Garlic Carrots Haiku: "Doesn't say what size. So I cut mine into 'rounds', maybe half an inch?" Recipe doesn't specify how to cut carrots, just "peeled", so I went w/ bite-sized, which I guess turned out fine, b/c in 45 min., plus the 10 min. after the parmesan went on top, these were soft, delicious and slightly charred in places.; the perfect amount of sweet/salty/cheesy. What little leftovers there were, I ran thru the food-processor for my baby and she loved them too! Nice, easy recipe that I had in the oven alongside some quartered rosemary red potatoes, so everything timed well as sides.

I used ingredients as instructed. I microwaved the carrots for 3 minutes to par cook so I could bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes with my main dish. Turned out perfect and the family enjoyed this new carrot recipe. Easy to prepare. It's a keeper - thanks for sharing!

Made according to recipe (cut carrots into uniform size pieces) and my daughter said they were "spot-on" and nice change from  the expected sweet or  boring-bland cooked carrots.  I need to watch the sodium, so next time I will use fresh or dried minced garlic and rely on extra cheese for saltiness.

this recipe is quick, easy and YUMMY!! since I like my veggies crispy next time I'll only cook 30-35min.. also I eliminated the extra step of tossing them in a baggie and just mixed them in a large bowl.. I used shaved parmesan. NO clean up was NICE!! a definite KEEPER!!

Easy and a big hit with my husband, who doesn't usually like cooked carrots.  I added some garlic powder and used butter-infused olive oil.  The parmesan was the best part.

If you like roasted vegetables, you'll love this.  I peeled then cut carrots in 1/4 inch long strips.  They cooked perfectly and tasted savory and delicious.

Found this recipe in the recent addition of the Holliday Issue.  My husband made these tonight with help from the kids.  I would never have thought to try this recipe.  I was wrong. They are amazing!!!

I enjoyed the roasted flavor of the carrots, especially the browned edges. If people keep in mind, this is lighter fare, they will be pleased. If you are looking for artery-clogging, butter and brown sugar drenched carrots, you shouldn't make this. I believe this recipe would also work for those on the Beachbody 21 Day Fix.

You can really taste the bourbon! I’m not a whisky drinker (husband is)  but I would definitely make these again. My glaze didn’t thicken enough so I added some flour.

This recipe is very good. Was very quick and extremely easy. I used thin carrots. They cooked in half the time. I will next time forgo the salt and just add the cheese to make up for it!

I made a huge batch to freeze for later and share with another family with a new baby.  It was super easy and smelled amazing as it cooked.  I added Trader Joe's Multipurpose Umami Seasoning Blend.  It seemed to add another dimension to the flavor.
Next time, I'm going to add a herb to the seasoning.  Perhaps oregano or rosemary?

Made it for a side of turkey meatloaf. I added quartered asparagus and mixed some honey and black pepper with it. 
Came out delicious.

Very good and very easy. Followed directions exactly except for using parchment paper instead of aluminum foil. I also mixed the carrots with the oil and garlic salt in the bowl instead of in a plastic bag. No changes to the recipe per se.  Will definitely be making this often!

I used baby carrots, did not have to pre-cook them. I used garlic on half and a little brown sugar in the other half and  slow cooked them by turning down the heat to 375. Both turned out great tasting.

Made as is, and while the seasoning and roasting was spot on, I don't think the parmesan cheese goes with the flavor of carrots at all. I'll save that for asparagus!

My husband and I really enjoyed this carrot recipe. The roasting brings out the sweetness of the carrots. I prefer roasting my vegetables to preserve the nutrients that are lost in the stovetop process. I will definitely make this recipe again.

You can buy sweet potatoes or carrots in the grocery store that are adequate for this recipe.  It takes almost no time to prepare and turns out great!

Pretty good. Might add some black pepper next time. I definitely used too much oil, so make sure you measure it. I didn't, which is my own fault, not the recipe's. I wanted a carrot recipe that wasn't sweet, and this one worked well.

I added thick cuts of onion, and chopped fresh garlic.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as directed.  I love how the Parmesan cheese browns and turns crispy after adding it near the end of the cooking time.

Delicious.  When carrots were about half way through cooking time,  I added asparagus prepared the same way to the roasting pan.  Came out great.  I will definitely make again.

These were FANTASTIC!!  My son who hates vegetables said they tasted like french fries.  The next day he asked me to make more.  I used baby carrots and only cooked them for a total of 40 minutes.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I microwaved the carrots for 5 minutes before roasting. I also just mixed the oil, garlic powder and salt as well as black pepper in the dish instead of a bag. After 30 minutes, I sprinkled with parmesan and continued roasting. These came out soft and sightly charred on the bottom as I wanted. These came out great!

These had no flavor, but I did use real Parmesan which is all I had, they might be better with the stuff you buy in a jar.

Great base recipe.   I never use garlic salt.   I separate all my spices to have full control of the flavor. I have canned garden carrots and that soft texture will work for this recipe.  I cooked it over an iron skillet.   Add generous garlic, a hint of salt and sprinkle the Parmesan at the end. Delicious.  I will definitely do this again and again.

One of my favorites! I make this all the time, even as a yummy snack. I never do the plastic bag step, I just put the olive oil and salt in a bowl and dip each carrot in. The longer you cook them, the more they turn into like a french fry texture. So you really can cook them however long until they suit your preference. I'll never eat carrots without parmesan cheese again!

Quick and easy recipe. I cut whole carrots in pieces and they were done in half the time. They were good, but were missing something. Not sure what. I will try this recipe again.

Easy and delicious! I made them in my toaster oven. Pushed the temp to 425 degrees so they were faster, and used baby carrots. I'll be making this recipe again and again!

I prepared and cooked as suggested, but decided to make a change when I pulled it out of the oven to add the cheese.  I had onion grilling in a cast iron skillet, so decided I would throw the carrots in for a few minutes.  I then added the Parmesan cheese and finished baking in the oven.  It was delicious.

Used freshly grated Parmesan, was ok.  but not that flavorful.  I've tried roasting carrots a few times, and they just don't roast as well as sweet potatoes.

I cooked mine with a roast chicken at 450 (for 25 min) and burned the  out of them. Nevertheless, they tasted great and the parm really added something special. Added a little extra garlic and splashed with some balsamic to finish. Nice change from the brown sugar and bourbon carrots I normally serve.

I made this for our contribution to the family holiday dinner and it was extremely well received. Cutting them into larger diagonal slices made them a bit more festive. Enjoyable dish.

I have made these again and again and again!!  I really appreciate the comments and made them using the suggestions.  The balsamic idea is great!  I wouldn't try grilling as I am not sure how you would make the parmesan to stick.   I loved the baby food idea!!  And yes this is lighter fare.  Meant to lighten up a bit during the holidays when there are so many calorie laden dishes.

Easy recipe and my husband actually ate them too! only reason they get 3 stars. I wasn't a fan and probably won't make them again- they tasted really bland. I made the recipe as listed (although on the grill, don't think it was the cooking method that made them bland) and these were noticeably missing something.

I don't know what I did wrong but they burned on one side.  The flavor and texture was nice otherwise.
