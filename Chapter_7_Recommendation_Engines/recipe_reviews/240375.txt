Classic dip. Red Gold is so much better than Rotel. Of course you can always add hot sausage or chorizo plus a few chopped jalapenos.

Have made this recipe for years, though I usually add 1/2 lb. browned hot sausage, I like it just as well without the meat.

I have made this recipe before and was pleased with it. I've also eaten it with some cooked/drained breakfast sausage.  I'm planning on making it with some cooked/drained Mexican Chorizo.

I did not drain the can of tomato/chili  because it was not in the directions and the dip was runny. I had to add flour/water mixture to thicken it. I was disappointed.
