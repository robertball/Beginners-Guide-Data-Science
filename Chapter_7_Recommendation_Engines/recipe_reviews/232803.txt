Great flavor! I did take the shell off of my shrimp for easier and less messy eating. The sauce was a little too oily in my opinion but that might have been because there was no shell to soak some of it up. The oregano gets lost so I would either add more next time or leave it out altogether. Overall this was a good recipe and one I would make again. Using Valentina is a must!
