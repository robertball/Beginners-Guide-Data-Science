This was really good! I thought it was a little on the salty side, so next time I will use no-salt-added green beans (or frozen green beans), and a low sodium cream soup. Otherwise, it was a hit at Thanksgiving, Thanks!

Came out delicious. A little more kick than your usual green bean casserole.

One of the best green bean casseroles I have tried.  I doubled the recipe and added 1 can of mushrooms chopped into the casserole.  I didn't have the french fried onions so I substituted crushed potato chips.  It was a big hit.

This was okay, but not the best.  The taste was too overpowering.  It was too salty i think.  Next time I won't be using as much garlic seasoning.

This was one of the best green bean casseroles I have made.....most notably because of all of the cheese and especially because of the Velveeta. A hit with everyone.

it was easy but too rich for my family and I.  Next time I would use less cheese and garlic

i kept to the recipe except i used 5 cans green beans, added a splash of milk and omitted the salt. everything else stayed the same. this is fantastic. it made a big roaster pan full and it was almost all gone at the end of christmas dinner. i like it with the cheese in it. i liked this recipe because it didnt call for velveeta which isnt a staple in my kitchen. awesome recipe.

this is good, but very spicy and salty. the mushroom flavor didn't come through much. i would change it by using low salt mushroom soup, less of the garlic and herb seasoning blend (i had montreal chicken seasoning), and no fresh garlic since garlic is in the herbal seasoning. thanks for the recipe.

I got assigned Green Bean Casserole for a Picnic I was invited too. I normally do not like this dish so I found this recipe!!! It's AWESOME!!! It might be too "garlicy" for some (it wasn't for me) so if you are not a garlic person, cut back on the minced garlic and garlic seasoning.

I only used about 1/2 the garlic / herb blend and 1 cup of cheddar and found the flavor a little too strong - so just be careful of seasoning depending on how potent the blend you're using is! :) I liked the addition of the garlic flavor to this cheesy green bean casserole dish.

This is the only green bean casserole I make anymore. It's just slightly different but it makes a world of difference on taste.  Love it!
