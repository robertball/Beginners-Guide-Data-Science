I made a few very minor alterations after following the recipe exactly the first time.  All of this is just FYI.

With the second batch I skipped the milk chocolate chips.  They made the first batch very fudgy, and my preference is a cakey brownie.  It is also a great lesson learned to ensure that the cream cheese is definitely softened but also, cutting it into cubes before you blend it is also helpful.  It makes it much smoother and easier to spread.  Finally, I took the reserved cup of batter the second time around and dropped many more much smaller amounts than the tablespoon size the first time.  this just made it easier for me to marbelize it.  :-)

GREAT recipe - love it, my husband loves it, and it's worth the home-made effort!

These are really rich, but if you want a chocolate fix, this is definitely one of the best brownie recipes I have baked! And I bake all the time.  YUMMMMMM!

I only had one 8oz. block of cream cheese.  A lot of the reviewers were complaining that the cream cheese was too much so I just used the one block.  They turned out great and were even better after they had been in the fridge.

We had a blast making these and they looked and tasted great.  We fallowed other reviews advice and used less cream cheese and more peanut butter. I whipped that mixture together first and set aside at room temp before mixing the brownie mixture together.  That made it very easy to work with because it had softened so much.  I even used light cream cheese adn reduced fat peanut butter and the taste was awsome!

The brownie part of this dessert is AWESOME, but I think the peanut butter/cream cheese part could be different. I didn't think it tasted very peanut buttery, but then again I like a lot of PB taste with my chocolate. The only thing I modified was the cooking time, as I had to bake it about 15 minutes longer than suggested. The last few dishes I've made have had to be baked longer though, so it may just be my oven. These are soo good, you won't want to make them if you're trying to watch your diet.

Out of this world!!! Two modifications: 1) I left out the chocolate chips; and 2) I subbed oil for the butter (a little bit less than the amount of butter called for).  Rich, gooey, and the perfect balance of peanut butter and chocolate. Plus, the marbling looks so pretty!  These hit the spot like nothing else when you really need a peanut-butter-chocolate fix. If I don't eat the whole pan tonight, it will be a miracle!

These were very good brownies. The cream cheese and peanut butter keeps it moist and the chocolate part is neither too dense nor cake like. They were pleasently delicious. It is more like Peanut butter cheesecake brownies.

I was in a hurry so my review is only based on the peanut butter/cream cheese part of the recipe.  I used a boxed brownie mix for the other portion.  I wasn't sure about the pb/cream cheese combo when I tasted the dough but once cooked it is amazing!!  This recipe is going to make me fat because I ate half the pan in one day!!

My MIL just made these while visiting.  They were so YUMMY!  My husband loves peanut butter and wanted more peanut butter flavor rather than cream cheese.  I, however, am not a big PB fan and thought it was great as is.  I will be making these myself soon.  Thanks!

I'm still trying to come down from my sugar high!  This was the perfect balance of chocolate and peanut butter.  My husband wanted pb brownies with vanilla ice cream and this recipe defintely did not disappoint. I didn't have chocolate chips so I omitted them; And I only had one pkg of cream cheese. Other than that I stuck to the recipe and it was perfect!

I made these the other day and took them over to what I call my test team, (a florist shop where my Mom used to work) I am always trying new recipes on them. They just loved these and said to put this at the top of the Brownie list for being number one. The others who tried these at home thought the same thing. I think that says it all. I am baking another batch today to take to a nursing home tomorrow after church. They were even better the next day.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe Tara.

I added an extra 3/4 cup of peanut butter in place of one of the packages of cream cheese.  I cooked them for 35 minutes.  They were a little dry, but still quite good.  I probably won't make them again.

Thick and rich.  Next time i'll use a bigger pan to thin these out a little.  I had a hard time getting the temp/time right.  They started to burn on top but were still undercooked inside, so i lowered the temp and left them in 15 more minutes.  I added almost a full cup of peanutbutter, and used mini chips in BOTH batters.  It's a really good, easy recipe. Next time, i'll just need to bake them at a lower temp for longer.**Update** These are 10X better the next few days!!

Base is a good basic brownie recipe.  Nice compromise between gooey and cakey.  I used only 1 block cream cheese.  Everyone at work loved them.

I made this recipe after reading how great all the reviews were and honestly, I don't understand all the four and five stars.  My peanut butter part tasted sour and it seemed like no matter how long I baked it for, it never cooked all the way through.  All I can say is I'm glad I decided to taste the first batch before deciding to double the recipe.

I was not overly impressed with this recipe. The brownies baked fine, but the peanut butter with cream cheese just seemed a bit much or something. I frosted mine with chocolate icing but I still wasn't crazy about these...sorry!

I made this yesterday for the first time.  I've never made brownies from scratch before!  I was nervous because the batter seemed so thick to me, but they baked beautifully!  I was so excited.  I had been craving PB brownies.  One thing to note, I almost added way too much cream cheese because I saw it said 2 packs, I didn't realize it was 2 3oz packs.  I already had 8oz in the when I noticed so I just left it and it turned out great anyways.

These are really delicious, but not quite as easy as the recipe and other reviewers make out. It's not real difficult, either, but it took me much longer than 20 minutes to prep them. It took me more like 50 minutes to prep them. But it was worth it. It is, as another reviewer has commented, like eating cheesecake with a brownie for a crust. It's very rich, so if you are turned off by rich desserts this is not for you. 
Other reviewers have mentioned not liking the cheesecake/peanut butter combo but I think it's an excellent flavor. If you have ever had and enjoyed peanut butter cheesecake, that is about what it tastes like. 
I brought these for a potluck at work and everyone loved them except a few people who don't like their desserts too rich.

It was pretty good.  As others said, it was not peanut-ty enough.  Probably will not make it again.

I love recipes that use every-day ingredients, have straight-forward directions, and taste outrageously delicious!! I followed the directions exactly - however, I lined the pan with tinfoil to make getting them out of the pan easier and cutting goes a LOT smoother when I can do it on a cutting board rather than in the pan (doesn't create ugly, jagged edges). I cannot wait for people at work to try them! I think they are amazingly rich, beautiful brownies. The peanut butter is relatively mellow, so if you're like some and really expecting the PB to pop, it does seem these are more about the chocolate. Perhaps experiment and try upping the PB and reducing the cream cheese a bit. YUMMMM! **Just realized these are like Michelle's Peanut Butter Marbled Brownies on this site (I've made those too), but her's uses less of the cream cheese... maybe give that a shot. The Cream cheese will be less intense, but if you don't mind it, I say this recipe is great--certainly richer.

These were totally lacking in flavor. I added extra peanut butter, and still it had a weak PB taste.

Like others have said, this doesn't have a strong peanut butter flavor--but they're still really good! If you like regular cheesecake brownies, this will be a nice change from your usual recipe. The brownie part is really nice and fudgey, which is perfect for me since I don't really like cakey brownies. Like most things that include cheesecake, this also gets even better after it's been refrigerated for a day or two. These were really good, but I would still like to find a more peanut buttery recipe, which will probably be one that doesn't include cream cheese.

These were yummy but way to rich for brownies.  I would definetly increase the amount of peanut butter and decrease the amount of cream cheese.

Good, but the peanut butter taste kind of takes away from it...just not as good as plain cream cheese brownies...next time I will try to modify it to just be cream cheese...the brownie part was REALLY good....

Delicious and really easy! I reduced cream cheese to 8 ounces and increased peanut butter to 1-1/2 cups. I also had to increase cooking time to 50 minutes. Will definitely make again.

Everyone loved these.  I did not get a picture but they were beautiful.  I only had one brick of cream cheese but had read a review where a woman was in the same situation and they turned out great.  I cooked about 38 minutes and they were perfect.  The edge was dark but in no way burnt.  Thanksgiving newbie.  I want to make them again with two blocks of cream cheese to see if they are better.  These were rich.  They did not have a huge peanut butter taste but they were so good no one cared.  Easy too.  Heated with scoop vanilla ice cream was amazing and better than anything you could get at a restaurant.

This is a definite favorite recipe.  I made several changes: 1 package of cream cheese, 1-3/4 cup of sugar in 'base' mixture, 1-cup peanut butter, 3/4-cup butter, 1/2-cup chocolate chips.  Added 2-tablespoons  PB2.  As suggested by other reviewer, combined room temperature cream cheese, peanut butter and PB2 separately ahead of time.

Unfortunately, the cream cheese flavor overpowered everything else. I couldn't taste the peanut butter at all, and it would've been OK with a cheesecake brownie taste if the cream cheese had been sweeter. Instead it  tasted just like brownie with plain cream cheese on top.

These were amazing!! I left out the chocolate chips. Perfect sweetness, perfect texture, perfect flavor! Brownie part was perfect, PB/cream cheese part was perfect. These are now a family favorite! ***UPDATE***I substituted unsweetened applesauce for half of the butter, and it turned out just as awesome, just less fat & calories!

I baked mine in my multi- function rice cooker, so they took an hour and a half to bake, but turned out pretty good. I cut back on cream cheese like others suggested, and wished I wouldn't have. I can taste it, but it only makes me want to taste it more. I upped the peanut butter to 1 cup, and that was good. Next time I make it, I will bake in oven and follow the recipe exactly to see if I get even better results.

Pretty good.  I thought the chocolate portion could have sweeter, for my tastes.  But it got rave reviews when I took it in to work.  Might try altering it later, but I'll keep it in my recipe book!  I added PB chips into the cream cheese mixture akong with the PB.

Used Light Domino sugar, GF flour, Xanthan gum and soy milk.  Made the peanut butter topping first and then the brownie mix. As the brownies cooled, they got better. Might use the peanut butter mix for PB pie.  YUMMY.

This was an awesome brownie! I left out the cream cheese and added extra peanut butter and melted butter to the peanut butter mix. I think it definately needs to cook a little longer though. My family ate half the pan while it was still warm! Will def make again!

I can appreciate the brownie part of the recipe. The only problem I had was that I didn't really get a hint of much peanut butter flavour.

I found this one took more time then the given amount to prepare - it was pretty messy!  When it came to the brownie portion, it had a good taste, but thickend quickly and I had a hard time spreading it in the pan and decorating the top with it.  The overall taste was pretty good, but if I needed something quick for a party or bake sale, I'd pick something else that required less time and less mess!

If you are a chocolate and peanut butter addict do not try these. You will eat them all.
Made them with my 8 year old grandson and they were easy and sooooo good.

This recipe is okay.  If you go by the recipe, you'll notice that the ingredients do not match the preparation directions.  There is one additional egg and one additional 1/4 cup of sugar needed to follow the directions for preparation.  The brownies were all right, but I don't think they had enough peanut butter flavor.  I used JIF and added an additional 1/4 cup of peanut butter and still found it lacking in taste.

This was excellent!  Moist and very tasty.  I think I might add some more peanut butter next time . . . just to punch it up a bit!
