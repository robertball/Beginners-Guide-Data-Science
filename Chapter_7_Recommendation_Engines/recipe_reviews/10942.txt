This recipe uses way too much flour and makes way too much dough. The cookies don't have a whole lot of flavor and I only used brown sugar to sprinkle on top hoping to make them sweeter and less floury. They were ok but I won't make them again.

I'm afraid I agree with the other reviewers. These cookies are extremely doughy and very bland. Won't make these again sorry.

The batch is very large. The cookies are extremely bland and the consistency of the dough was all wrong. I either did something wrong or this recipe needs to be redone.

The dough looked more like batter and they didn't have any flavor at all except maybe a hint of the buttermilk.
