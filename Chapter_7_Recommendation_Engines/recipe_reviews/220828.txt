Very good. I used dates and 1/2 cup dark cocoa. Do not add water ! Just keep processing till the nuts have time to become nut butter.

I followed the advice in the recipe description and used cherry Craisins in place of the raisins because I prefer them.  I also used 1/3 cup cocoa powder.  When I tried forming the "dough" I found it was extremely dry.  The fruit and nuts were just covered in cocoa dust and not blended.  I added 1/4 cup of water and re-mixed to make it come together, although this did make the dough quite sticky.  When I tried them, they did not taste very good to me.  Admittedly, I usually do not make raw vegan desserts, but I figured since I liked all the ingredients I would like the final result.  I really did not.  I think I would have been better off eating the fruit and nuts separately instead of making these.  Sorry, this is just not the right recipe for me.

I LOVE these brownies.  First time I tried the recipe, I followed it exactly.  The taste was great but my bars crumbled and were dry.  If your brownies are dry use prunes, dates, or baking raisins.  I modified the recipe to: 1/2 cups raisins, 1/2 cup prunes and 1/2 cup craisins (I like thicker brownies), I up'd the cocoa, and use 1 rounded cup of almonds.  The result is super moist brownies.  The craisins and cocoa go so well together!  This is a wonderful natural recipe, thank you!!!!

being vegan + gluten free, this is WONDERFUL. I did have to add almond milk... it wouldn't blend into a formable dough for me otherwise... Oh, and I used dates. Altogether, seriously delicious. I didn't realize it would be sweet, but it is. almost like a BROWNIE, wow :) So happy with how tasty they are!

I would never recommend using something as processed as Craisins. I've tried this and another raw brownie recipe and was wowed because I chose to stick to the original recipes as opposed to changing them. Try it again and see what develops. Trust me, I've been a raw vegan for 48 years (from birth until now) and had never considered nor had a desire for brownies before until a friend, who is also a lifetime raw eater, turned me onto the AllRecipes site. Now I make these a LOT. LOL!!

Very yummy, i enjoyed this recipe a lot. I did, however, add honey to it for a sweeter taste but it tastes very fudgy and crunchy! The dough formed quickly the second time I tried this recipe. It really is a fail proof recipe if you follow the instructions and you won't be disappointed!

A great way to satisfy a sweet tooth in a healthy way!  I really want to give this recipe a '5'...after following the recipe, I thought that it tasted pretty good, but wanted to add a little bit more of something.  So, I drizzled some honey, splashed a bit of vanilla extract, and added a dash of sea salt into the mixture.  Also, I folded a handful of walnut pieces into the "dough".  For added firmness, I chilled it in refrigerator before serving.  With these little modifications, I'd have to say that I'm very satisfied with the results! :) It's a keeper!  Thanks for the nutritious dessert idea!

I just made these! I didn't have raisins or nuts, so I used prunes, hemp, and flax seed. I also added some raw agave syrup to sweeten it up. Yummmmie!

I have a cousin on the raw food diet, that swears by it for optimal energy and rapid weight loss. I told him I would test and pass on recipes he might like. I made 1/4 recipe and didn't feel like the ingredients transformed themselves into anymore then they were. To top, when I ground it all together I had more of a ground nut look then something that could be shaped. I had to sprinkle water to shape the pieces. I made a reduced amount of another raw brownie recipe on the site the other day which tasted more like brownies or like a no bake cookie. It had honey instead of the raisins. This is healthy, but the predominant flavor is raisins. I am not getting any real brownie flavor. It is more like a cocoa raisin bar.

I love these - perfect, and easy to make for vegan family members.   Plus I always have the ingredients on hand.  I don't press into a pan, which is difficult - I roll the dough into 1 inch balls.  They hold together great, if you've processed the ingredients enough.  The recipe as written makes about 20 1 inch balls.

This is a fantastic recipe. I use it as a Weight Watchers  recipe and count a brownie as 3 points. It is a great healthy alterantice when you are craving a sweet snack. I used dates for sweetness and they complement the cocoa nicely.

I make this recipe with dates, half a cup cocoa, a little salt and vanilla. I DO add a little water to thin it a bit. I often form little balls and roll them in unsweetened coconut flakes. Might taste good with rum flavoring? One of my FAVORITE desserts!

Transitioning from the typical western diet to a vegan lifestyle/diet and had a serious sweet tooth this weekend. Looking for a good vegan brownie recipe and decided to try this one because it was the most simple (cooking on a daily basis is another challenge I am having) and the ratings were consistently average. As far as taste they satisfied my sweet tooth. Used dates and added 1T of honey as suggested in one review. However, next time will add a little almond soy milk instead. The honey was overwhelming and the brownies were a little too sweet. Not so great on the final product as far as panning and cutting into squares. Recipe is crumbly but adding more moisture would make the mixture too runny or pasty. Decided to roll into balls as someone else suggested. taking some fudge balls to work tomorrow - want to see what some of my co-workers think. Not difficult to make so that is a plus.

I just made these and quite enjoyed them! I used walnuts instead of almonds. I rolled them into little balls instead of pressing into a pan and slicing them. My two year old son also enjoyed them. These might not be for the person who has a super sweet tooth, but rather for a chocolate lover who likes a little bit of sweetness.

I added coconut milk and honey and added cranberries and dates.  I also would say to use a smaller pan then suggested in the recipe. I would like to add that if you don't want to use honey you can you guava syrup.

I was looking for a quick-to-make-vegan dessert and found this vegan brownie recipe. I used raisins and prunes. And I boiled the raisins and prunes for about 10-15 minutes to soften them up. I added coconut milk to bind it together a little better.  It was simply delicious, especially with fresh strawberries on top.

This was a very simple and surprisingly good recipe. I did add one pack of Splenda and a teaspoon of vanilla. You can see that it balled up very nicely in my food processor. It makes a very thin brownie so you might want to make a double batch however I would make it into separate batches. I also used  good quality almonds that were very fresh. I took a picture of the ball of "dough" that formed in my food processor so you could get an idea of how mine turned out following the recipe with just two little additions.

Just made these after I tasted something similar yesterday. I used 1 cup dates and 1 cup prunes.  Added one cup pecans and 2 Tbs raw honey.   Also used 1/2 cup cocoa powder, locally mae in Trinidad where we grow world renowned cocoal that is so good, just a little is used to make cocoa from other parts of the world taste better.  Look it up if you want.  Trinitario cocoa. 
I love it.  My daughter wasn't a fan of the one I bought yesterday so she probably wouldn't like these but I think they are great.

Great recipe! I used prunes instead of raisins, walnuts over almonds, and added honey and vanilla but kept the ratio of cocoa.

So cool! I've never tried making raw vegan brownies before. I was surprised that 3 simple ingredients can combine to make such a nicely textured dessert that is easy to slice and tastes good and chocolatey! Thanks for sharing :-)

I used prunes instead of raisins and this recipe worked great. I needed something to fix my afternoon chocolate cravings. A little messy but worth it. Try putting the "batter" in a tupperware container instead of a pan for easy storage.

I actually think these are pretty great.  I had to add a little water every time to get the texture right, but considering what is in them, I was pleasantly surprised by how close they are to real brownies.

These are amazingly simple and delicious. My bars also crumbed a bit... bummer, I'll have to experiment with them to get them just perfect. :)
