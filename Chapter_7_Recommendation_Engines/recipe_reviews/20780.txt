I found that the wings were not quite done at 1 hour so I cooked them another 15 minutes.  Could be differences in oven temps.

We started doing this recipe on boneless/skinless chicken breasts and it's one of our favorites now.  Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM YUM YUM. I just cooked the wings and dripped honey over them after they were done and put a fresh mint leaf on top. It was absolutely wonderful...

I made there for a birthday party bbq.  The flavor was good but after abour 1 hr 20 min in the oven my guests still didn't think they were done so we had to throw them on the grill.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I made this for an Iron Chef-themed dinner party/friendly competition in which "lemon" was the themed ingredient. Everyone loved this, except the lemon taste wasn't strong enough for us to be a good contender. ;) That said, this was still an easy, super-delicious yet very different chicken recipe! I used a family pack of drumsticks because I prefer dark meat. Followed the recipe exactly for 6 lbs of chicken/8 servings. I set my oven for another successful roasted chicken recipe I use as a benchmark. 425F for 1 hr and about 15 mins was perfect, checking every 20 mins. As I had to transport the dish, it steamed under foil for an extra 30 minutes which made the chicken extra moist.  I do recommend at a least 2" deep pan. I used a 12x17 jelly roll pan since I was making so many drumsticks, and the otherwise yummy carmelized honey glaze totally dried up in that pan vs the 9x9 pan I used for the few pieces I had left over after filling the jelly roll pan.

We were not crazy about these when made strictly according to the recipe.  However, I had some leftover wings from another recipe that I had lightly coated with in a mixture of 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp salt, and refrigerated for an hour.  I spread the garlic mint mixture on top of those instead of trying to force it under the skin, and dipped them in the honey sauce and they turned out really well.  We will probably make these again with that light coating of flour and spices and without the mint (we're not big mint lovers).  The lemon honey butter sauce alone is 5+ stars.  Some of it dripped onto my green beans and they were so good that I plan to make a batch of the sauce to toss with green beans next time I want a special side dish.  Thank you!

I forgot to glaze with the juices halfway through cooking, but these still came out great! I cooked for about an hour and 10 minutes. Will make again!

Such a great mix of flavors. It needs a little more lemon, but other than that it is perfect. I will be making these for parties.
