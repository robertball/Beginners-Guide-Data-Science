I had a few problems with this recipe.  The first is the fact there were too many "bowls" to get this together.  Next time, I will melt the butter and the chocolate together in the microwave.   I also sifted my flour before adding to the batter.  I *always* use 2 mini loaf pans instead of 1 regular size pan when making any quick bread recipe from this site (even if I have to scale it down).  This in part because the outside get browned too fast and the center is not completely done.  That being said...I think the cooking time is way off.  Using the 2 mini loaf pans, at 32 minutes the loaves had burnt edges. As the recipe submitter stated, this bread crumbles when cut, even when totally cooled.  Since I made 2 loaves I will cut the other one tomorrow to see if there is better results.  I will try this recipe again using a standard sized pan but will NOT cook for an hour.  Since my bread was over cooked it was dry, but had a nice flavor.

this was disappointing, dry, and chocolate overpowered the date flavour. Continue looking at other recipes
