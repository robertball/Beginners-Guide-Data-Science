I've rated quite a few recipes on this site, and given a lot of 5 stars, but this is the first recipe where I really want to give it more than 5 stars!! Really, really excellent... like something you'd eat at a wonderful Italian bistro. My guests were very impressed.... I served it with Italian Marinated Chicken (also from this site). Thank you so much, Emily, for submitting this recipe and making me look good :) !

Quick recipe and really tasty...

I used sun-dried tomatoes (in oil) instead of boiling the sun-dried tomatoes...And used a combination of black and green olives..Yummy!!!

This was great!  As others have said, it was a bit dry, but I served it under another Allrecipes dish that helped out with that:  Garlic Chicken (by Martha Banks - a Taste of Home Recipe).  The Garlic Chicken has a great sauce that went PERFECTLY with this pasta and gave it just the right amount of moisture.  The pasta alone, I'd give 4.5 stars, but in combination with the chicken, 5++ stars!  Absolutely wonderful!  So healthy and serves WAY more than 2 (I'll probably get 3-4 large portions out of it).

Great dish!  This really was very easy to make.  I added some pepperoni slices with the mushrooms, and some parmesan at the end to help hold it all together.  All the flavors blended very well.

This is a nice alternative to tradtional pasta, although, because it lacks a real sauce, it tasted better the next day as a cold pasta salad (when it was served hot, it seemed dry to me, even though I added about 1/3 c. of the pasta water back to the pot). I followed the recipe as listed except we had a big jar of sundried tomatoes in olive oil, so I skipped the step of sauteeing them in oil and just the tomatoes right from the jar. We sprinkled some parmegano reggiano cheese on top. My husband really liked it. I thought it was a little bland, so I added some extra salt and red pepper flakes to my serving.

This is my first review of a recipe and it really deserves at least 5 stars.  It is  a healthy and more than filling alternative to a dish with meat.  I omitted the olives due to the sodium and was extremely happy with the dish.  Thanks Emily for a great dish!!

I'm giving this five stars because I would make this again.  Some changes I made was that I did not boil tomatoes. I just chopped a big fat tomato into small peices and added it. I also added just a tad bit of water to give it slight gravy.  I also added a chicken knorr cube.  It turned out great. I would make it again.

Fabulous mix!  I used gluten free pasta and added some extra EVOO.  Served it over broiled fish.

Loved this recipe.  It was easy!  Next time I'm going to try the tomatoes in oil to eliminate that step.  I added feta cheese and more mushrooms.  Will definitely make again!

It was OK, I liked all the ingredients but it was really dry. I added some olive oil the next day to the leftover I had and it was better but I was disappointed with the recipe.

This was excellent! My non-vegetarian fiance loved it!  Given that others said it was a bit dry, I added a bit of canned tomatoes and a bit of the oil from the sun dried tomatoes.  I also did not use the breadcrumbs.  It wasn't dry at all once these changes were made.

Recipe was good, but lacked the creamy sauce i prefer in a pasta dish. I probably wont make this again, but i think it was worth a try. The green olives were a nice addition.

Excellent combination.  Though I used sun-dried tomatoes in oil and ommitted the sauteing step that rehydrates them.

I thought this recipe was ok.  I only had sun dried tomatoes packed in oil, so I did not rehydrate as the recipe states.  After cooking the garlic and onions, I added the mushrooms and dried tomatoes, and found it to be a little dry, so I added about 1/3 of a can of diced tomatoes, which worked very well.  Overall, I thought it was tasty, but needed a little tweaking.

We are living in Sicily right now and love the simplicity of the Sicilians pasta dishes we've had here.  I tried this last night and it was a HUGH hit with my "Not to easy to please" family!

My family really did not care for this.  The sun-dried tomatoes were too strong compared to the flavors of the other ingredients.  I used good quality olives but still they did not make up for the tomatoes.  If you really like sun-dried tomatoes, you might like this recipe.  Otherwise, stay away.

I thought this dish was edible but thats about it. The only change I made was using artichokes instead of the sundried tomatoes. Despite having the olives in it I just didn't think it had much flavor and it was kind of dry. Overall we ate it because I hate wasting food but I was with the kids on this one I would have rather had peanut butter and jelly. Sorry.

Super easy and delicious. I added zucchini and left out the bread crumbs. Based on other reviews I used sun-dried tomatoes in oil.

We really liked this! Like many other reviewers, I, too, used sun-dried tomatoes that were packed in oil.  I just used a bit of the oil from the tomatoes to saute the onions and garlic. My family agreed that the bread crumbs really didn't add anything to the dish (except dryness), and would prefer some freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead. While I did not drain the pasta, I just scooped it out of the boiling water and went straight into the pan with the condiments, it still needed more "sauce". Next time I will add a splash of wine and maybe a bit of butter at the end. Overall, we enjoyed the flavor combination in this recipe, and will make it again with a few tweaks!

It turned out really well! The store was out of sundried tomatoes so I just used whole tomatoes that come in the can and squeezed most of the juice out of them. I also thought it was a bit on the dry side, so I added mozzerella cheese on top. My husband is a VERY picky eater and he said it was "pretty good" which is as close to perfect as his taste buds can aprove of... unless of course it is his grandma's food!

This recipe is delicious! I left out the sun-dried tomatoes since I didn't have any, and added diced artichokes and chicken. It was wonderful. My fiancee ate the whole thing in about 2 days. Thank you.

This is a terrific recipe!  I made it as a side to baked chicken, and it was wonderful!

This is now one of my favorite vegan dishes.  The sun-dried tomatoes give a great flavor, and it is easy to prepare!

This dish was very tasty although we found it a bit dry.  Maybe I'll leave out the bread crumbs next time and just sprinkle the Italian seasoning on top. Very quick and easy to make.

I had to hurry and put the other half of this recipe into a storage container so I wouldn't eat it all!  Loved it. Wonderful, robust flavors. I used sun dried tomatoes in oil, b/c it's all I had at home.  Still turned out very tastey.  Not as healthy with all that extra oil.

I loved this recipe!  It was so easy, but you'd never know it by the taste!
