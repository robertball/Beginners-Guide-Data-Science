I have made these twice and so far I think it would be safe to say that they are nothing short of wonderful! 
   I do have a few modifications of my own. I made the dough in my bread machine on "dough" cycle. I add a little bit of vanilla into the dough for those of us who choose not to have frosting. ( I think cream chese frosting would also be very tasty) I sprinkle a little olive oil on the dough before adding the filling. I also find that when rolling into the log, the more times you can roll it the better the buns come. I think that thats the true trick to making these. They will have more filling and stay more moist. So put a little extra effort into rolling it into a log and they come out doubly better! And to make them SUPER moist put a VERY small pat pf butter on top of each roll before baking.
   One more thing- when i made these the second time, when I tool these out of the fridge in the morning I found that some of the filling had liquified and there were little puddles of it around each bun. If this is the case try to scoop this up and put it on the buns BEFORE cooking them! If you do it after it will carmalize into a rock hard tooth-breaker. And to top my review off- baking them for 20 minutes makes for a much better out come!
   Once again- Perfect!

to avoid flattening the rolls when cutting, use a length of thread, place under the roll where you want to cut it holding the ends. Tie a knot... easy as pie.

Very good recipe-the dough is easy to work with and they raised very nicely.I save my tuna fish cans and use them as pans instead of a muffin tin.They form perfectly shaped rolls every time. My yield(with the tuna cans) was 18 for this recipe. I also use the tuna cans for  making large muffins.

Wonderful, charming comfort food, and easier than I thought it would be to cook.  I particularly enjoyed checking on them in the morning and seeing how plump and delicious-smelling they had become overnight.  I also like the fact there are no weird or expensive ingredients.  I'll use a little bigger pan next time because they were a bit overcrowded, and I'll add just a little more brown sugar & cinnamon.  Be careful not to let them overheat during rising or they will stop rising too soon and be like little hockey pucks.

i made this recipe twice. first time i followed the directions to the letter(following the advise to use cream cheese frosting). it was ok but the second time i made some changes. i added an extra 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp. more salt, and a 1 tsp. cinnamon to the sort of bland dough. i slathered a generous layer of soft butter to the dough before adding cinnamon-sugar mix.  i bake it at 350 because 375 is just too high for a tender dough like this. this came out fantastic!!!! still with the cream cheese frosting. it gets easier to make the more you do it. please note that my dough didn't rise during the first rest period or in the fridge...but in the oven..MAN OH MAN! PERFECT!

I doubled the amount of cinammon and thought that a little less brown sugar in the filling would still have been plenty.  The recipe calls for one 9x9 pan but two are required.  Some tasters wondered if I was a baker !

Like some others, I did find the dough a little goopy, but I added a bit more flour at a time and kneaded it the whole 8 minutes advised and it was smooth and supple by then.  I did add about 1 Cup more of flour in the kneading process.  I used all the brown sugar the recipe called for but there was SO much filling it ran out the sides so next time I will use less.  I included chopped pecans in with my brown sugar...not listed on the ingredients list but nuts are mentioned in one step.  I highly recommend the pecans!  Next time I will try a different frosting; this one was good but just shy of what I wanted. Overall a big hit with my whole fmaily!

Outstanding!!  This is a GREAT recipe.  It was about 87 percent humidity when i made the dough and had my doubts as to whether it would rise properly  but it did and they baked up gorgeous and cinnamony.  My boys were actually quiet for the full 15 min they were eating these delectable doughy delights!!  Next time I make them, I'm going to make an extra batch to freeze!!

I made this one to spec to be fair and found a number of serious problems:

1. The dough comes out extremely dense for a cinnamon roll - I even cut back by almost a full 1/2 cup and, while the rolls rose in the oven, they were still quite heavy.

2. The filling was terribly dry - I think this could have been influenced by the consistency of the dough, but while the lack of any kind of fat (i.e. butter) in the filling may make these a little healthier there was nothing to allow the cinnamon/brown sugar mix to properly melt and give that gooey consistency you tend to crave in a cinnamon roll! (Besides, who's going for healthy in a cinnamon roll anyways?)  

3. The icing needs some major work - this is little more than a basic sugary glaze. Combined with the sand-like brown sugar/cinnamon filling which dissolved into pure sugar in your mouth, this topping was the sugary straw that broke the camels back and simply overpowered the entire recipe.

I was interested to try a new recipe, but know now that I'll stick with my original cinnamon roll recipe  - "Clone of a Cinnabon" - also from Allrecipes

Great recipe. You may bave to proof the yeast first, though. I didn't and the dough didn't rise at all after an hour and still looked pretty sad in the morning. I put them in a very, very low oven (about 150 degrees) with a damp cloth over top for about 1/2 hour before I baked them (350 for 15 minutes). They came out perfectly! I prefer these to the ones with the brown sugar/butter topping. These are less rich and you can control the amount of frosting on top. Thanks!

Just what I was looking for. I made them in two 9" round cake pans and froze one pan instead of letting it rise in the fridge overnight. To use the frozen pan, let it thaw on the counter for a few hours, then stick it in the fridge to rise and follow the directions for baking the next morning-- nice to have on hand!

Perfect for company coming for coffee in the morning. I don't really care for icing on my cinnamon rolls. Instead, I put butter, brown sugar and pecans on the bottom of the pan and place the rolls on top. Bake like the directions say, but when they're done, flip them over on a tray, and you have delish sticky buns.

Yum! These are so light and fluffy! I finally got around to making these after saving the recipe a few months back. I did a few things different, I used quick rise yeast and mixed it in with about 3 1/2 cups of flour along with the other dry ingredients and reserved the other cup for kneading. I beat the eggs in a separate cup, I also microwaved the milk, added the butter and microwaved it again mixed it well and used a thermometer to check the temp before adding to the dry ingredients.
I mixed the milk and butter mixture with the dry ingredients and then mixed in the beaten eggs. added a little more flour and then put it on a floured surface for kneading. let the dough rise/double in size in a greased metal bowl, rolled out the dough and brushed butter all over and put the brown sugar and cinnamon on top and rolled and cut into 12 pieces. I also didn't refrigerate over night I let them rise again and baked. so tasty, so glad I finally found a cinnamon roll recipe I can get to turn out and tastes great!

I used my KitchenAid mixer to make the dough for these rolls. I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl for ten minutes with the sugar and milk (I used buttermilk), until the yeast "bloomed". I then added the melted butter, eggs and all the dry ingredients. I did need a little more flour than what was called for to get the dough to jump on the hook, but not much. I kneaded the dough with my dough hook for five minutes or so, then set it to rise in a greased, covered bowl on my warm heating pad until it doubled. I rolled it out and set to spreading the "innards" on the dough. I did use 1/2 cup of softened butter, I doubled the cinnamon and I added nutmeg to the filling ingredients. I mixed it together all in one bowl and spread it over the dough. I cut my pieces and set them in my largest cake pan, covered it with foil and let it sit overnight in the fridge. Once I got up in the morning, I let it sit on the counter just to take the chill off, then set it on the warm heating pad to rise for the second time. Once it doubled, I baked it at 400* for about 15 minutes. I used a different icing recipe (one that uses cream cheese) for the tops of these. This roll recipe was good, but I think my adjustments made it better. It really did need the extra spices and butter in the filling. This one didn't rise as much as others I've used, so if I make this again, I'll double the amount of yeast called for in this recipe.

Oh...what a blissful way to start the morning!  This was my first time making cinnamon rolls, and they are amazing!  I followed the recipe almost exactly as written but used a bit more filling than called for.  Before baking, I put a small dot of butter on top of each roll.  Also, I didn't have any light corn syrup, so I made the glaze by creaming 3 tbsp soft butter with 1.5 cups powdered sugar and a tsp of vanilla.  Then beat in about a tbsp of milk a little at a time to get the right consistency.  Spread it on warm rolls and then sit back and watch my kids' eyes pop out of their heads.  :)  I think this will be our Christmas morning breakfast this year!  Thanks!

made these for christmas morning, they came out well and are easy with the steps split up and rising overnight. they didn't rise that much in the fridge but did when sitting out before baking. the 375 degrees was too hot, they browned too much, so will do 350 next time. also, i will put more filling in next time, we like lots of that, and spread the dough with butter before putting on the filling. they were tasty and tender and a keeper.

I have never baked with yeast before, so I was pretty nervous about this recipe, but it turned out great! Rave reviews from each person who ate one.  Because of my anxiety about working with yeast, I read all of the other reviews and let the yeast dissolve 10 minutes in the milk mixture before adding the other ingredients.  I was concerned that the dough was too sticky and not rising enough, but in the end it was just fine.   I also brushed the dough all over with melted butter before adding the filling.  I agree with the reviewer who noted that you should use extra care in rolling the dough into a log.  I wasn't able to get it as tight as it should have been and the filling fell out a bit, but it still turned out great.  I also added a little pat of butter to the top of each roll before baking, although I don't know if that was necessary.  I used the frosting recipe from the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe and doubled it.  There was frosting left over, but I don't think one batch would have been quite enough.  The frosting was super sweet, decedent and delicious.  Overall, a great recipe, even for a novice baker like me!

This is a really good recipe. Previously, whenever i have made Cinnamon rolls the dough had a dense texture, these were lighter and fluffier different (in a great way).

The filling left a little to be desired. Next time i think i will use the filling from a different recipe. In addition, this time i went with a cream cheese icing as i like cream cheese icing the best. 

In preparing the dough, I would recommend using a candy thermometer to measure the temperature of the milk and butter mixture prior to adding the yeast. It should be within a (110 to 120 degree Fahrenheit). This recipe doesn't specifically state it, but I allowed the yeast to get frothy and activate prior to adding the flour and kneading.

Another tip that i have recently learned. Is that kneading is very important, and should take the recommended amount of time, and usually absorbs more than the recommended amount of flour. For cutting the rolls, the Dental floss trick is amazing. There are a few good tutorials on Youtube that explain it well, if you are wondering.

My final tip is to keep an eye on them while they are baking. I took a peek 20 minutes in, and they were a good golden brown color. If i went with the recommended time, i am sure that i would've burned them.

I made these buns on Christmas Eve, ready for Christmas morning!  They were delicious!  Resting the dough overnight helps to develop the yeast flavour of the rolls.  I did make some changes because the recipe looked a little rich: used 2 eggs instead of 3; spread a little butter on the rolled out dough which I also made thinner and bigger (the butter helps the brown sugar to stick better); increased the brown sugar to 1 cup and cinnamon to 4 tablespoons; eliminated the glaze altogether.  With the increased brown sugar, the rolls were plenty sweet enough and wonderfully cinnamon-y.  It's a wonderful recipe and so easy to make.

OMG, overnight rolls are the way to go!  I've made tons of cinnamon rolls through the years, but never done overnight ones.  These were soft and fluffy and absolutely wonderful!  Thanks.

I ended up needing to use 5 cups of flour, and 2 baking pans [a 9x13 and a 8x8] so that the rolls would have room to rise.   I doubled the cinnamon, and added a 1/3 cup of butter and a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the filling.  Before baking in the morning, I also brushed the tops with one tablespoon melted butter.  Yeah, more butter.  It's not like you eat these that often. Ended up being more of what I want out of a cinnamon roll than the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe -- which until now, was my go-to cinnamon roll recipe.  Nummers!

LOVE this recipe.  I took the advice of a couple of other reviewers and used string to cut off the rolls.  Will definitely use that trick in the future.  I also soaked the raising overnight in rum which adds a little extra. Next time I make this, I will also double the filling.  Overall, a fantastic recipe and was a special treat for a cold Christmas morning.

WOW! These were outstanding! I made two double batches on Christmas Eve, which made enough for six 9-inch round cake pans. I gave five away as gifts and kept one for us. They got rave reviews from everyone! I'm making this a Christmas tradition. I added chopped pecans to the filling (in the same amount as raisins.) These are even good reheated, 18 seconds in the microwave for one large roll. Next time, I'm going to try an orange instead of vanilla icing. Fantastic morning treat! 
Icing tip: if you give these as unbaked gifts (as I did), put the icing in a zip-top baggie. If they put it on the stove while the oven is preheating, it will heat up to drizzle nicely, so they can cut the corner off the baggie and drizzle the icing. Yummmmmm!

I've been using the same roll recipe for cinnamon rolls for a long time and they kept turning out okay.  I starting looking for a real cinnamon roll recipe, not just a roll recipe turned into cinnamon rolls, and this one turned out great!  I even overbaked them slightly (something I HATE to do) and they were still great with a cream cheese frosting!

The only other cinnamon roll recipe I've tried is the Ninety Minute Cinnamon Rolls recipe from this site, so that's what I'm using for comparison.  

I thought these rolls were good, but not great. The dough is harder to work with and turns out kind of dry and hard when you eat the rolls at room temp.  I liked the "refrigerate overnight" procedure because it made the morning baking very easy, but I think I prefer the taste and texture of the other recipe better (plus the dough was easier to handle).  I tripled the amount of cinnamon.  I used Cream Cheese frosting for both recipes.

Overall, these produce a fine result that you'll enjoy.  I'm just still going to look around for that ultimate recipe.

I made these for Easter brunch and everyone was so impressed.  They said they looked and tasted like something you would get at a bakery.  I followed the dough recipe as listed and changed the icing to a cream cheese frosting.  I used 4oz softened cream cheese, 1/4 cup softened butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla.  So yummy!

What a delicious recipe! It's so easy to make! My kids helped a lot and had so much fun,and we were definitely rewarded the next morning after we baked these up and ate them while they were nice and warm and gooey! This is honestly the best recipe for cinnamon rolls I've ever had. Better than a lot of bakery cinnamon rolls I've had! We had our friends and some family try them and they were a big hit, and now they have the recipe, too. The only thing different that I did was as I rolled the dough up I would slather butter on the other side, too. Double the butter, double the flavor!

These are great! I had never tried letting something rise overnight before, but it worked perfectly. they are wonderful without the glaze--in fact, I think I like them better that way. If you make the glaze, milk works in place of half and half.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I thought these were a little dry.  They were also way too thick for our taste.  I think if I made them again, I would cut them into more than 12 rolls.  I might try them again.

So easy and delicious! A couple other reviews said the cooking time was too long. I'm glad I read that, I started checking them at 20 min. They were perfect after about 27 minutes.

I'm rating the roll part of the recipe only since I think I'd be run out of town if I didn't top these with cream cheese frosting. This is an excellent recipe for cinnamon roll dough. I used my KitchenAid and did have to add a little more flour than called for but it was beautiful dough to work with. Silky smooth and easy to roll out. I let my yeast sit on top of the warm milk/butter mixture for about 5 minutes to come alive before adding the other ingredients. Don't make the mistake of not adding melted butter to the rolled out dough before sprinkling on the sugar and cinnamon. The filling really must have butter to mix with or it will be dry. I used 1/4 cup melted butter and a mixture of brown sugar, white sugar, and cinnamon. You can find cream cheese frosting recipes on many other cinnamon roll recipes on this site. I will definitely use this roll recipe again!

I have used this recipe for Christmas breakfast for the past 2 years. This year will be #3. I pop them in the oven while kids go through stockings, by the time they are done so are the rolls and everyone gobbles them up forgetting there are still presents left to open. 

You can tweak it a bit but the original is still amazingly yummy!

Like many others, I had trouble getting these to rise. I proofed the yeast 10 minutes in the milk mixture, but it didn't 'bloom' very well, and I threw it out and started over, but had the same issue. I've never had a problem proofing yeast, and I figured maybe it just looked different in milk as I've only proofed it in water before. I went ahead and continued the recipe, and had to add over a 1/2 cup of flour in order to work with the dough. It hardly rose in the greased bowl, but I continued on. I brushed the rolled out dough with 1 tbsp of butter total, doubled the brown sugar, added nutmeg to the filling, and took away the raisins. I cut 24 smaller rolls out of the batch - as we don't like giant rolls - and froze them immediately. When I prepared them, I let a few thaw in the fridge overnight, first spraying them with PAM and covering them with plastic wrap. They didn't rise much in the fridge, so I followed another reviewer's advice on this and covered them with a damp cloth and let them sit in my oven at 170F for about 20 minutes. They looked good at that point, so I baked them at 350 and pulled them out after about 10 min as they were more than done. They were about Pillsbury cinnamon roll size when complete. I made a cream cheese frosting which I loved, but my husband said he'd prefer the traditional glaze made from powdered sugar and water. They had nice flavor, but could be moister. I'll follow the tip of putting a small pat of butter on them before baking.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  These are the most amazing cinnamon rolls I have ever had!!!  I get nervous working with yeast because I don't have the best track record...but these turned out great!  The key I think is to make sure you leave them in a really warm space to rise!  Regular room temperature just isn't enough.  The only things I changed with the recipe was to leave out the raisins and I didn't use the suggested glaze (my own preference - I don't like corn syrup).  I used the glaze from the "Savory Cinnamon Rolls" recipe on this site.  I cut the glaze in half and it was plenty for these rolls.  I can't say thank you enough for posting this recipe!  It is amazing!!!!

I double the filling for this recipe and rather than mix the entire filling together I spread the butter and then sprinkle on the other ingredients.  Easier to get an even the covering.  Also, I would recommend pulling this out a little longer before baking in the morning for fluffier rolls.  My kids love this recipe and since it takes some time to make I usually make it after they go to sleep and surprise them in the morning.

Pretty good!  My very first time working with yeast, so I was nervous about how it would turn out.  The texture was spot on, and the taste was good, but missing a little flavor.  Perhaps adding a small pat of butter to the top of each before baking, as another reviewer suggested.

These were great. The only thing I changed was to double the cinnamon and I will probably add even more to the bread dough next time. I also think I will brush the dough with butter before adding the cinnamon and brown sugar next time. But these were easy to make and everyone loved them.

This was a great recipe, worked like a dream!  The dough itself was a tiny bit bland, I'm going to add a little vanilla next time.  Also,  I second everyone that has said to brush the dough w/ melted butter just before adding the cinnamon/sugar mixture to make it "stick" better.

These were great. I spread butter on the dough before spreading the cinnamon sugar over it for moistness and so that the cinnamon sugar would stay in the rolls better. The icing was tasty too. Mine didn't rise much in the fridge either but I let it rise for an hour before baking and they puffed up beautifully! I only cooked them for about twenty minutes

Needed a lot more flour than listed.  Dough did rise nicely overnight and when baking...but wasn't tender or very flavorful.  Nothing special.  And if you don't eat the rolls warm right out of the oven, then they turn hard as rocks (not the filling:  the ROLL itself).  Microwaving to refreshen and soften the next day didn't even help.  OK if you plan to eat the whole pan at once.  Thanks for sharing.

My family could not believe I had made these from scratch! They disappeared in the blink of an eye.  The recipe is perfect as is.  My only suggestion is to spread softened butter on the rolled out dough, prior to sprinkling with the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Tried these with the cream-cheese icing, but I think I prefer them plain...no glaze...That's how good they are!

Mmmmm mmmm good!  If you let rise in and oven that is off, with a pan of boiling water on the rack underneath (for both risings) they rise really well.

These were good- they just didn't rise much in the fridge.  They did rise in the oven though, and turned out very well in the end.  I included some whole wheat flour, and used walnuts in half of them.  I left out the raisins.  I found it didn't make enough glaze for all of the rolls, so I ended up making more, but that wasn't hard.  We had these on Saturday morning!  Leftovers are great warmed in the microwave for 20 seconds or so.

I would say I was so happy to find something I could make in advance, overnight.  Mine ended up on the dry side, although the neighbors loved them. I tend to undercook when I bake but it didnt work this time.  I will blame it on the weather or the Phoenix climate. I used the cinnabon recipe for the icing, which went over great.  Will try again.

I enjoyed the balance of sweetness as the dough was not super sweet however the dough did seem to be a bit on the heavy side. This was my first time baking with yeast so maybe maybe it was something I did or failed to do. I also used the food processor to bring together the ingredients so maybe that had something to do with it. I will try this one again!!!!

I made these for all of the people in the kitchen at the restaurant where I work.  They loved them and even started fighting over them!  I put all of the ingredients in the bread maker and let that make the dough, then finished them and let them rise.  I baked them at work and then frosted them while still in the pan.  Thanks!

I have made these a few times and received nothing but rave reviews! I used cream cheese frosting to make them super-decadent, but otherwise I prepared them exactly as it says and had no problems. I have tried other recipes in the past that ended up dry and flavorless - these are awesome! People have told me they put Cinnabon to shame...well worth the effort!

I tried this recipe, but I think I used too much butter since the dough became too sticky..so I kept adding more flour to make it manageable. It looked delicious but I failed miserably as it was too heavy and no taste at all.

I must say these were sooo good! I know I should'nt have but I did try one. I have tried many cinnamon roll recipes and this is one of the best!Instead of letting rise over night I made them on valentine day for breakfast. I made them in the shape of a heart they were so cute and my family and siblings loved them. To make a special touch put one drop of any food coloring in the glaze.I will be making these again. Oh and make sure you leave them in the oven at about 25 degrees for about an hour then take them out shape them and then put them back into the oven for another hour if you are... "not"... making them over-night.

Lovely!  I took the advice a few people and rubbed a bit of butter across the top before baking. I made a cream cheese/ sour cream glaze as well. 

As for the recipe, I followed it exactly.  I made these by hand (no bread machine).  The initial dough rise was very large.  I rolled them out and ended up with 16 very large slices.  

I covered them and placed them in the fridge.  I actually left them on the counter for three hours in the morning while I was waking up.  They doubled again and they turned out lovely. I also cooked less than directed so the bottoms didn't carmelize beyond etible.  

I served with a spinach Fritatta and fresh strawberries for brunch.  Delightful!

This is an excellent recipe that eats rave reviews every Christmas.  I add double the cinnamon.  Next time I might remember to take he eggs out of the fridge a couple of hours earlier so their coldness doesn't mess with the proofing process.  Super easy!

These turned out mighty good for such a simple recipe. I say "simple" because I looked at a lot of other online overnight roll recipes, and this one had fewer steps and ingredients than the others. It produces a delightfully soft, rich dough--a joy to work with. However, I had to add a little bit more flour than the recipe calls for because the dough was too soft and sticky; I probably added about 1/2 cup more. And the rolls did  did not rise overnight. In the morning they had risen only a little bit, so I put them in a slightly warmed oven and they rose right up. Nevertheless I'll definitely make these again. I strongly recommend that you use dental floss to cut the dough into individual servings. Super easy and yields perfectly cut rolls.

meh, I've had better. I think I will stick to my recipe. I would suggest to REDUCE the temperature to 350. 375 is too high. 350 @ 30mins.

I really loved these cinnamon rolls, but I'm rating it 3 stars because I had to do some tweaking. I ended up using around 6.5 cups of flour to actually make the dough. 4.5 cups made a soupy mess. The finished product was a perfect texture and consistency. The color (because of the eggs) is beautiful! 

I also used a cream cheese frosting instead of a glaze. Doing this made them taste like Cinnabon. I bake bread for a living, so I'm not just blowing smoke here. :) 

Oh, and I've made these 4 times now and never gotten fewer than 16 rolls out of them. My kids want me to make them every night!

Fantastic! When I made the dough, I found that I didn't need quite as much as is called for, and left out about 1/4 of a cup or so. I let it chill overnight as indicated, and set it out to room temp for about an hour. After reading several reviews, I set my oven at 350 and let it cook for about 25-30 minutes. I have 4 children, and ALL of them, and I do mean ALL of them, thought that they were the best cinnamon rolls that they EVER tasted! :)  I will definitely be making these again!

Great recipe! The only different thing I did was I warmed up the oven and let the dough rise for a couple hours more after I took it out of the fridge. Popped them in the oven and they were done in no time, probably about 10 minutes. Oh, I also used a different glaze because I don't have any corn syrup on hand. My family loved them!

This is the Way To go!! Loved the easy handeling of the Dough, It was so easy to work with. I am definatly making this recipe again. The rolls were very moist and fluffy and did not have a overly yeast flavor like some do. I did put Melted butter on the dough before I sprinkled the cinnamon sugar mixture on. I also made a more of a buttercream frosting instead. But overall taste of the cinnamon roll was great. highly recommend!!

What a great recipe for an easy breakfast/brunch recipe! I can't stand raisins so I left them out and doubled the rest of the filling ingredients. I love nuts so to half the filling I added some very finely chopped walnuts (pecans would be good too) I then filled half the dough with one filling and half the dough with the other. When slicing the dough use a length of thread or unflavored floss, place under dough bring ends up and cross then pull until tough is sliced, this will prevent a squished cinnamon roll. I did use another icing recipe from this site that looked better.

This recipe was good. The dough turned out great. Nice and fluffy and not too sweet. But I felt like it needed more filling. 
I made less glaze, and I think that was a mistake!!! I should have made the full amount.
I don't think it's necessary to let the dough sit for 30 minutes. I popped mine in the oven immediately and they were great.  
I will definitely be making this again. I will try buttering the dough and lightly dusting it with flour before putting the filling on the dough. 
Better recipe with some slight changes to the recipe.

Delicious! I made these up last night and like other reviewers, didn't really notice them rise during the wait time or the overnight time, but they rose a bit on the counter and the rest of the way in the oven. Regardless, they were delicious and helped me impress the inlaws :) I made them with cream cheese frosting instead because I had some on hand, but they were amazing- thanks!

Great cinnamon rolls.  I didn't proof my yeast at the beginning so I had to leave the dough in a warm oven to rise for 2.5 hours,  but they still came out great!  I topped mine with cream cheese frosting.

I made this over the weekend for a group of ladies.  I will say I accidentaly used self-rising flour, so mine didn't turn out exactly right.  But the dough was easy to work with.  Despite my mistake, they tasted great!  I made cream cheese icing instead of what it called for, because I didn't have corn syrup on hand.  I am actually going to try these again tonight for a work function tomorrow.....but I think I will pay closer attention to the bag of flour I grab!  :-)

These were fantastic! I loved being able to make them in the evening and just pop them in the oven in the morning. Mine turned out pretty dry because our oven was on the fritz. I cant wait to try them again now that I've repaired the oven.

I haven't made these yet but plan to.  I wondered If the next morning I could bake some of them and freeze the rest and take out as I wanted to, thaw and bake or perhaps let them thaw and rise in the fridge then bake as directed.

Fabulous! These are soft, gooey and the perfect snow day treat. The overnight rise means that it's only an hour from wake-up to breakfast! I added a little extra cinnamon to the filling and I rubber the dough with a few tablespoons of butter before adding the filling. I also used a cream cheese frosting. YUM!!!

I thought these were great.  Made exactly as written except the raisins.  However, next time I will double the filling and icing.  We like our rolls extra gooey.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Overall, this one of the better doughs for cinnamon rolls I've seen. I made a few modifications to the fillings due to personal taste and my own experimenting in the kitchen. I also did not make the glaze but instead turned these into caramel rolls; it worked out very well. The whole family loved them! I would have liked to see these rise higher, though (thus the 4/5 instead of the 5/5).

awesome! my hubby is probably about to go into sugar shock but claims he'll die happy. I made the dough in my bread machine and it was glossy and very easy to work with after the rest. made in two cake pans lined with parchment and froze one pan. my oven must be running hot as they were a bit over browned but double thumbs up. Instead of raisens i used currants and instead of making frosting i used store bought creamcheese frosting to finish the tub. will def make again as they were very easy and delish

Perfect for our Christmas morning, these were gooey, sweet, and DELICIOUS.  I did spread soft butter (about 1/2 a stick) on the dough before adding the sugar/cinnamon mixture. I also used chopped up pecans. I definitely suggest kneading a little extra flour into the dough but the main thing is make sure you knead for the whole 8 minutes! This will be the recipe we use from now on, especially since i can make it the day before!

Really great recipe, pretty easy to make too! I like to top mine with a cream cheese frosting (specifically the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this site) instead of the glaze because I'm a sucker for cinnamon rolls with cream cheese frosting.

This recipe scared me at first- the dough didn't rise very much at any point- but they doubled in size while baking!  My only warning to others would be to check on them after about 15 minutes instead of 25-30.  I waited 20 and they were more than done.

These were good, but not great.  The dough turned out good and rolled out easily.  They rose beautifully overnight in the fridge.  But after baking, they didn't have that gooey cinnamon roll flavor.  Next time I make these I will add a little butter in the filling before adding the sugar and cinnamon.  The kids still really liked them and are excited that there is enough leftover for them to have at tomorrow's breakfast.

These we good, but not spectacular. I like my cinnamon rolls super extra sweet and gooey so they make you sick. These didn't have enough filling for me, but other people liked that about them. It's just a preference thing :)

Awsome!  The ultimate cinnamon roll.  They were moist and flavorful.  Very easy to make.  I found that I had to let them sit out a litter longer after I took them out of the refrigerator as they didn't rise a whole lot overnight.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

These turned out light and fluffy, easy to make if you have experience making bread.  The next time I make them I will add butter before putting on the sugar mix, as they were a bit dry even though I put butter on top before baking.  My gang prefers a sweeter glaze, so I'll be adding a sweeter icing instead  of the recipe's.  I will definitely make these regularly.

These were sooo awesome!!  I made these exactly like it said with the exception of raisins.  I deleted the raisins and increased the brown sugar to a cup (my family does not like raisins).  They were such a big hit!!  this is definitely a keeper!!

As the Mommy/cook in the family I am always trying to make something that everyone will enjoy, even if it means cutting out some of the fat (without telling anyone)! In this recipe, I halved the amount of butter, and added an equal amount (as to equal 1/3 cup altogether) of unsweetened applesauce. I have made cinn rolls for years, and this did not alter the taste whatsoever! Plus, I did not have any light corn syrup, so I used dark, and the glaze on the top was still white, and tasted the same! This is a great alternative to baking cinnamon rolls the night before. I love the idea of having warm right out of the oven without having to get up at 4 a.m. to make them!! Thanks for sharing!! :)

These were surprisingly easy to make and turned out really well!  I skipped the glaze though.  I prefer a thick cream cheese frosting, so I used the frosting recipe from "Clone of a Cinnabon."  Can't wait to make these again!

This dough is very tasty.  I think an 9x13 pan might be too small because mine squished together and ended up a little dense.  I'll have to give this recipe another try.

These were GREAT! Such a gooey mess, but wonderful! Very rich, so lots of leftovers for hubby and myself, but would make these again in a second when company will be around. I did only cook for 20 minutes, as another review suggested, to get that extra gooeyness.  Also, I added a very small pat of butter on top of each one before baking. Wonderful, thanks for the recipe!

I baked it for only 20 minutes.   I am VERY glad I did.  They shouldn't have been baked more than that.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  These were really good and made a great start to the day!  Highly recommended!

I made these cinnamon rolls for a bake sale, and, man, did they go fast!  I find that when making overnight breads, it is best to allow the dough to sit in an unheated oven over a pan of boiling water immediately after removing them from the fridge.  It sounds odd, but it really makes the rolls puff up.  I also made a cream cheese icing instead because I was short on time and corn syrup! Thanks for the recipe!

I made the dough in the bread machine and it came out great with just a tad (1/3) cup more flour.  When I rolled out the dough, I spread a layer of margarine just because I couldn't imagine it without that addition (I thought maybe it accidentally omitted in the recipe).  Overall, it depends on how big you roll out the dough as to how much cinnamon/sugar you need.  I like lots of layers, so mine took more.  I think it still could have been more cinnamon-y.  I flipped the pan upside down as soon as it came out of the oven and that took care of any juicy goodness escaping the rolls.  Flipped them back over after a few minutes to serve.  I made a cream cheese frosting because I don't like the flavor of glazes.  (I'm only rating the rolls minus the glaze here.)  It was a good cinnamon roll, but not the best I've ever eaten.  They were pretty easy to make.  Oh, and I left out the raisins. I like raisins, but not in cinnamon rolls.

Worked great, even with some necessary diatery changes (using soymilk and soy margarine due to dairy allergies). I loved being able to do all the work the evening before and just pop them into the oven the next morning for a delicious breakfast treat.

This is the first time I have written a review, but I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to say how wonderful these were!  My first time at cinnamon rolls, and still a novice in the bread area in general... I thought for sure I messed it up!  It turned out so perfect and my family thought I was a fairy godmother I think!  Thanks for making me look so good!  =-)
Oh, I did spread butter on the rolled out dough before I sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.   I know my mom used to do that on hers.

These are great -- I made them the day before and then served them Christmas morning. I, too, have never worked w/yeast before, but they still were a success. I was very worried b/c the dough never really did rise, and I'm certain I didn't knead the dough correctly or roll it out flat enough. However, it all worked itself out in the oven - so I'll be making these every Christmas. Thanks for sharing the recipe and creating a Christmas memory for me & my two young children!

These cinnamon rolls are absolutely decident.  They did not rise well in the refrigerator - I took them out and put the pan in the oven while it pre-heated, then took it out and layed a towel over it so they would rise.  Worked like a charm!  Turned out huge, not too ooey-gooey, soft and yummy!

Yummy...A hit with everyone in my family.  I followed the ingredients to a T.  But I let them rise a second time on my stove top (while it was preheating) for about a hour instead of leaving them overnight.  I didn't use the frosting (no cream cheese on hand) but they where go enough without it. Thanks for the great recipe.

Great recipe! I let the yeast dissolve for 10 minutes in the milk mixture. I warmed the oven while kneeding the dough, which gives the dough the warmth that it needs to rise. My rolls turned out great and were very plump. My kids thought there was too much filling, so I will just reduce the amount.

Great basic recipe.  My family loved these and my kids loved making them.  We will make them again, but next time I think we will roll the dough thinner before adding the cinnamon/sugar mixture; they were a little doughy.  Icing is great, too!

Decadent! I used a cream cheese icing, so that made it even more outrageous. They definitely are best while still warm from the oven. I had a leftover one later in the day and it seemed a little dry.

Really good, although the dough seemed a bit dry as a finished product, but that may have been due to an error on my part.  I changed the filling in the middle slightly, spreading melted butter on the dough after it was rolled, and sprinkling on cinnamon and brown sugar, without the raisins.  Overall, a yummy treat!

This was my first attempt to bake anything with yeast. I made the recipe exactly as written with one minor exception; I did brush the dough with melted butter before adding the brown sugar. My wife was REALLY impressed and told me that the rolls were EXCELLENT.  I thought they were as good as any bakery ones that I've ever had. They were a really nice golden brown color and smelled great while cooking!

We love this recipie!  I brush the dough with butter before putting the cinnamon/sugar on the dough.  Also dab with butter before baking and it really helps in keeping the rolls moist as opposed to dry.

I made it this morning. It reminds me of the county fair cinnamon rolls. I made the dough and left it on the counter to proof while I went out shopping. When I got home I put it in the frig  until I was ready to rolll it out.  That way it didnt over proof. After a few hours I went back to my dough and rolled it out on lightly floured counter. I smeared softened butter all over rolled out dough and put a layer of cinnamon and suger rolled it up sliced and put it in a buttered baking dish. I got 15 pretty good size cinnamon rolls. Covered with plastic wrap and put in frig until morning.  Baked them off and everyone enjoyed them.

I don't think I let the yeast proof because it didn't really double in size when I let it sit for the hour but I just kept going. In the morning it didn't rise at all and I was disappointed but I followed other tips and let it sit in a warm oven and they rose nicely. 

As for taste, I agree with others that the dough is bland. Mine wasn't super soft, but it was nicely like a roll. The bland dough works with the super sweet icing. The filling was paltry as others have said. Perhaps I'm spoiled by store bought rolls.  I even put butter on the dough before adding the sugar mixture. Overall I'd say these are like the Little Debbie cinnamon rolls I used to take to lunch for school. If you like those, you'll like these rolls.

I am going to try this overnight thing. It looks delicious!! Saves me from waiting in the daytime for the dough to properly rise, but the one thing I will exclude is putting it in the refrigerator. The house is already cold, LOL.

These rock! The only thing I did differently was to spread butter on the dough prior to sprinkling on the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture, I cut by sliding dental floss underneath and criss crossing on top (cuts super easy that way), and adding a tsp or more of cold butter to the top of each roll before baking. Definitely not for the calorie counters.

Quick, easy, yummy! Family loved it. Used only half a cup of powdered sugar in our glaze and added a bit of the leftover cinnamon sugar. Next time I think I'll add a bit more sugar into the dough.

This is the BEST cinnamon roll recipe ever. My husband works in a kitchen and all the chefs ask him to have me make these rolls (pretty impressive!!). I do add a bit more cinnamon than called for, skip the raisins, and frost these with cream cheese frosting. My kids go NUTS when they see a pan of cinnamon rolls in the fridge!!! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE, IT'S A KEEPER.

I thought the dough was easy to work with.  I mixed it in my kitchen aid stand mixer with the dough hook.  I also like others add butter to the rolled out dough before I put the sugar cinnamon mixture on. They were a big hit at work this morning.

Made these last night to bake on Christmas morning - they were delicious!! Just like from a bakery. I made sure to knead the dough a full ten minutes and rolled the dough tightly into a log before cutting. I used a different icing recipe but I think any icing would be good on these!

The rolls were decent, but I had to do a serious amount of tweaking.  I used my Kitchen Aid to mix the dough and I used at least 6.5 (or more) cups of flour.  And 375 for 30 min was WAY too long.  I wish I would have followed my instincts (and read some reviews 1st) and tried 350.  I did 375 for 22 min and they were quite brown on the top.  I also used more sugar and cinnamon and added a little butter to the dough before sprinkling the sugar....

very good!! after these rolls have set in the fridge overnight there was a huge amount of sugary luiquid in the bottom of the pan. I found that i had to transfer and turn them upside down to avoid a hard cracking sugary bottom. they still did a little but it was quite pleasant. I need to figure out a way where it doesnt get so liquidy. Any one else have this problem and can i let them rise outside of the fridge so i can bake them sooner?

The ingredients list does not ask for nuts, but the instructions do. I used 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I had trouble kneading the sticky dough, but found this method on youtube and will try this next time. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yno_JaLvfOc

Even with my challenges (this was my first attempt ever at bread dough making).... they turned out wonderfully!

These rolls were amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, only I used a cream cheese frosting in place of the glaze. Like another reviewer suggested, to cut the cinnamon rolls I took a length of thread, placed it under the roll where I wanted to "cut", and tied a knot, making the perfect slice without crushing the dough. (I wound up putting some raisins on top of a few of the rolls before I baked them, which I recommend NOT doing as they kind of turned into little raisin-stones during the baking.) Will definitely make these again!

I have never made cinnamon rolls before so I was a bit nervous.  In fact, I left out the butter from the dough by accident!  The dough was very sticky and I used about a cup more flour than called for.  It was easy to roll out and I added chopped pecans to the filling.  I used rapid rise yeast so I did not have to do the first 1-hour rise.  I put the rolls in a glass baking dish, covered with saran wrap, adn put in the frig.  In the morning, I put the rolls in a cold oven and heated it to 375 degrees.  Because of this, it took 50 minutes to cook.  The outside rolls browned quicker than the inside ones so I had to cover with aluminum foil after about 20 minutes.  I took them to work and everyone raved about them!  Next time I may try with a cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze.

I have been having trouble with yeast recipes, My kids found this recipes and really wanted me to make.  I must say it was so easy and I was amazed that the next morning they were fluffy & beautiful, ready to bake.  They said they will NEVER eat cinnamon rolls from a can again.... Great recipes, turned out delicious!  Thank you

Really great rolls! Loved 'em. I used pecans instead of raisins though and changed the frosting up a little bit.

Very nice recipe.  I added softened butter to the filling and the rolls only needed 20 minutes of baking time, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  The rolls were light, fluffy and absolutely delicious.  I used two baking dishes, 9x13 and 8x8, to give the rolls plenty of room and they needed it!  Next time I'll add a little extra filling.

Unbelievably good! I used a cream cheese frosting for these instead of the regular thin icing, and they were SO yummy. Easy to make and even easier to eat! :D

First time I've made cinnamon rolls. My dough didn't rise properly, it didn't double in size. I still rolled it out and put in the fridge overnight. I had nothing to lose. Much to my surprise when I took them out the next morning before I put them in oven they started to rise. Excellent recipe! Will make again and again!

This was so easy and so, so good.  Way better than Cinnabon.    I did tweak it a bit, I doubled the filling and added some nutmeg.  Also, when I rolled it out, I smeared the top of the dough with softened butter before adding the filling.      I discovered I didn't have 10x sugar so I used a can of cream cheese icing and it was phenomenal.

I made these last night to have on Christmas morning and they were terrific!  I made them so late at night/early in the morning that I left them out instead of putting them in the fridge. (It was only 4 hours until I was going to cook them.)  They came out just fine.  The only things I'll do differently are putting a little butter insdie with the filling to make them super moist and I'll keep a closer eye on them.  My oven is old and can be a little off sometimes so cooking them for the full time made them browner than I'd like.  I like super gooey cinnamon rolls though!  Everyone loved them and I've now found an easy way to add a new Christmas tradition!

I decided to use whole wheat flour for this.  It was a little heavier because of it.  It also doesn't rise overnight as much as I was hoping that it would but it was still a good recipe for overnight rolls.  The basic glaze was just so-so.  I might try a thicker more flavorful one next time.

amazing! I ended up messing up the first batch because I put the yeast in before the milk cooled to lukewarm so the rolls did not rise and were still doughy even after they were in the oven for 30 min. The 2nd batch turned out amazing, I took them to work today and once people noticed they were there they didnt last an hour. Just make sure you let the milk cool before adding the yeast and they will turn out awesome!

I made these Cinnamon Rolls on Saturday night, then baked them off on Sunday morning.  They were really easy to make and the taste of hot home made Cinnamon Rolls filled out home!  I used ready made cream cheese icing instead of making the frosting from scratch...quick, easy and delicious.  I will make these again!

These are amazing! My husband raves every time he eats one. "They taste like Cinnabun..no, better!" These will become a signature in our home. The only change I made was to proof the yeast in the warm milk with a pinch of sugar before adding it to the flour and other ingredients. (I wanted to make sure with all the flour being used that the milk wasn't going to be too hot for the yeast to activate.)  Thanks so much!

These were good.  Nice to be able to pop them in the fridge and finish in the morning, however mine came out a little tough with the suggested cooking time.  I suggest checking these at 20 minutes to make sure they don't bake too long.  Good recipe, thanks!

Followed the recipe to a T. Did everything what it said for, and I did not care for these. They didn't rise in the refrigerator, so I left them out for 30 mins thinking it was just a process to go thru. Nope they never rose not even in the oven. ( It was my yeast it was brand new). I baked 25 mins on 375 and they came out sooo heavy. i think each one weighed 3 pounds!!. The icing was ok reminded you of the kind you get in the can. But probably will never make these again. Not impressed.

I was a little worried at first because these didn't rise in the fridge. I've made overnight rolls before and they always proofed in the fridge. But I took them out and put them in a warm oven with a pan of steaming water for an hour, and they proofed nicely. Turned out great!

This  recipe worked nicely and made for a pleasant Sunday morning. I chose it because it didn't call for a bread machine and I had all the ingredients on hand. However if you want the decadent, indulgent experience, I would try a different recipe. Next time I will try other reviewers' suggestions of rolling the dough thinner to get more turns in, and changing the sugar to cinnamon ratio. I applied a thin layer of butter before putting the filling on, (I couldn't cram all the cinnamon/sugar on, even leaving out the raisins and nuts) and it could have used even more butter. I baked them on a half sheet pan lined with Silpat, and they did not get overcrowded and it saved me greasing a pan and did not get too messy. The corn syrup glaze did not sound so good, so we used a cream cheese version instead.

I made these for Christmas morning, the best part is that the hard part is done the day before. Christmas morning into the oven, the wonderful smell of cinnamon buns filled the house. Planning on making it a Christmas tradition and make them every year, Only one change did not add raisins. For the glaze I made a buttercream icing by using milk instead of cornsyrup delicious!!

Not only can you make these the night before, but due to circumstances beyond our control we found out that you can make them two nights before you need them.  These are heavenly!!!  The dough lasts in the fridge up to three days!!!  Next I'm going to experiment and see if you can freeze them, thaw them, then cook them.  I'll keep you posted! ;-)

I had never made cinnamon rolls before trying this recipe.  I made them Christmas eve late and had them for Christmas morning.  It will be a new tradition!  Everyone loved them.  The dough does seem gooey and loose at first but as you are kneading it more and more flour gets worked in and by the time you are finished it is perfect.  I rolled mine out a half batch at a time to make it easier to roll and used string as suggested in other reviews to slice.  I added a stick of softened butter to the cinnamon and brown sugar as well as pecans.  I did let them rise about an hour on the table in the morning before baking just to make sure they would be perfect.  I made my icing with a block of cream cheese, vanilla, and almond extract, a little karo and powdered sugar.  I couldn't make up my mind between cream cheese icing and just gooey sweet icing so I combined the two and it was amazing!  Had the cream cheese zip but it stayed creamy and soft thanks to the karo.  LOVED IT THANKS!!!!

Very good!  I added chopped pecans, pressed the filling into the dough with my fingers before rolling to keep it from fallin gout, and used melted butter instead of corn syrup for the icing.

I actually made a different type of cinnamon rolls and didn't want to use their cream cheese frosting.  This glaze was perfect.  I will be making these next time.  Thanks

Easy and delicious.  Made them last night.  I used quick rise yeast and skipped the first rise.  Took them out of the fridge this morning and they hadn't really risen so I worried I'd ruined them.  They rose beautifully in the oven.  I flipped the pan over & let them cool a bit.  Other than that...  followed the recipe exactly.

My mom used to bake cinnamon rolls at a local coffee shop.  They were the best in town.  We have never been able to find her recipe. I think I just did. This recipe was quick, easy & scores very high on the comfort foods list. Boise Nana

very good rolls.  however, mine did not rise in the refrigerator overnight.  i took them out and let set out for about an hour, then put in the oven on low heat to rise.  this helped and after cooking for about 20 minutes, they completely filled the pan and were great.  i added 1/4c more brown sugar and 1T more cinnamon to the filling.

I just made these rolls and they are fabulous. Easy to make - especially making the dough and forming them the night before. However, the oven temp is 375F and mine cooked at 20 mins and were very brown. I have always used 350F for cinnamon rolls - Next time - I will bake @350F. I did not put icing on them because we are having them for for breakfast - but they are delicious!!!!!!!

Very good.  The only change I made was using the cream cheese icing from the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe.  My only word of caution is to make sure that these are really well covered in the fridge overnight.  I didn't make sure to have a tight seal on my pan, and the rolls got pretty dry overnight.  I think this definitely inhibited the rising process.

I was skeptical when I put these in the fridge - the hadn't risen much and I wasn't sure how they'd turn out. But I put them in the oven the next morning as instructed, and wow, they were nice and tall! I made one modification: I topped with a cream cheese icing instead of the glaze included with the recipe. Yum!  The only reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is because my husband likes gooey cinnamon rolls and thinks these need more filling. I like a "lighter" cinnamon roll, so for me they were perfect as is.

Very tasty!  Followed the recipe and will make this one again.  The next time, I will roll the rolls out a little thinner.  They ended up being a little thick when I rolled the dough out to 10 X 14.  Make sure you eat them all the first day because by day 2, they are a little hard.  Nothing that 15 second in the microwave won't take care of though.

This has become a favorite gift with my friends.  I started giving it out when in college, and I had no money to buy things.  My friends all prefer to have the frozen dough available to bake these treats at home - It's the coveted gift.

These are so good and I've impressed many-a-friend with this recipe!  If you don't want as much crust, scale the recipe down to 9 and put it in an 8x8 baking dish (making 9 rolls instead of 12) - that's the way I like it.  So good.

made these for Christmas morning and they were awesome! I think this is a new tradition in our house.  Recipe is extremely easy. I usually don't like to listen to people run on about all the changes they make to recipes but in this case I did add more brown sugar and replaced raisins which I don't like with pecans.  I also made Cinnabon cream cheese frosting instead of glaze.

Not that impressed...
I picked this because it had such great reviews. I also liked the fact I could prepare it the day before, but once we baked them they were more like biscuits than they were puffy cinnamon buns.
I think the cinnamon spread could have had a little more gooey-ness to it too.
The glaze was ok...  but again...  I had to add more cream to get the glaze to drizzle over the buns.
Over all it's an ok recipe.

Without question, the very best cinnamon rolls I've EVER had. Totally easy to make, I made them with quick yeast the first time and the next day made them with regular yeast (I was out of the quick kind) and just let it rise, kneeded it again and then put it in the fridge overnight and baked in the morning. I used the cream cheese frosting suggested in the first review. So good!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great afternoon treat during Raider football! I didn't put on the icing since we just like them warm with butter. I did put butter on before the cinnamon sugar, since I always make mine that way. It was super having them ready to go, all I had to do was pull it out of the fridge and let it sit for an hour then bake, yummy!

Amazing! I used my bread machine to make the dough. Ran out of regular flour so I used 1/2 regular and 1/2 whole wheat. I doubled the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture and rolled up dough tightly (to make lots of layers). The came out wonderfully and my family just loved them. May replace my strawberry sauce topped pancakes as the favorite:) Thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic!! These were so easy to make. I really appreciate the reviewer who reminded me about useing a piece of string to slice the dough, so that it all came out in pretty rounds instead of all squashed. I did add extra brown sugar and cinnamon,both to the inside and as topping the next morning right before baking. I also spooned about half a cup of melted butter over the tops before sliding them into the oven. Unless  you like crunchy rolls then 25 minutes should be the maximum time in the oven. I will definately be making these again..and again...and again...

This is the best home-made cinnamon roll recipe I've made so far (and I've tried plenty).  The only thing I would do different next time is to double or even triple the cinnamon.  I used unwaxed dental floss to cut the roll into same-sized pieces and used the frosting from the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe.  My family raved and raved and the 5 of us devoured these delicious cinnamon rolls!

These aren't bad.  I made them to bring into work, and I was a bit rushed, so I really didn't check the doneness before I brought them in, and they were a bit underdone.  My mistake since I didn't check.  They didn't rise much in the fridge overnight, although taking them out 1/2 hour before putting in the oven seemed key, as they rose during that half hour to fill the pan.  I didn't use the glaze--maybe with it they would've been spectacular; don't know.  I used the remainder of a tub of frosting I was trying to get rid of.  Overall, good, but I will have to monitor a little more closely next time and try the glaze.  I should know better--no one's oven is the same, so it's important to check for doneness each time.

The only change I made to the recipe was to double the amount of cinnamon.  I added a little more flour, maybe a half cup.  It would have been easier if I would have made two sepereate rectangles because it was a lot of dough.  But other than that, they turned out wonderfully, moist in the middle.  The only thing I'm concerned about is that I won't be able to reheat them and eat again tomorrow.  They seem like they will be hard.  They are probably way better straight out of the oven.  I will probably end up throwing the rest out.      *updated*  I take that back, they come out of the micowave just as they did out of the oven, great recipe thanks

I tried this for a Christmas brunch at my husband's work.  I needed something homemade that I could prepare in advance and that my husband could put in the oven with few instructions.  This worked really well and got great reviews.  During preparation the day before, I was concerned my dough ball wasn't rising after an hour, so I put it in a slightly warmer location and, whether or not that made a difference, after another half hour, it looked like it had risen some.  I was still a little worried, but I rolled it out, put in the filling, cut the dough into rolls (by tying a piece of thread around it and pulling) and put them into the pan for the next day. By the next morning, they had plumped up nicely and my husband took them to work with him.  I had him put a little butter over each roll before baking.  Afterward, he topped the rolls with a can of cream cheese frosting (so he wouldn't have to make the icing).  He said they were delicious!

The recipe is bad. Ifollowed it the first time. The rolls didn't rise in the refrigerator. The second time I tried it, I used more yeast and they still were disappointing. In baking I've found that trying to cut corners gives poor results. I'm going back to my mother's recipe.

A sweet treat that says "I love you" to my friends and family.  I omit the raisins because I don't care for them, but no other changes.  Truly special!

These were easy and turn out perfect ever time I make them.  I do change the filling to what ever I have on hand i.e. chocolate chips, peacans, walnuts, peanuts, dried cherries or apricots.

These are great! I spread soft butter on the dough first, which added alot. 
I covered these so that they would last, but the next morning my dad and brothers had taken the whole pan to eat while hunting! =) Oh well. They enjoyed them!!!

My daughters and I made this recipe for Easter morning breakfast.  It was a HUGE success! We left out the raisins because of personal preferences, and I don't see how these could be any better.  They were thick, soft and not a bit dry.  I brushed the dough with melted butter before adding the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture as did a previous poster; and only baked them for 20 minutes.  We can't wait to make them again!  Thanks, Marilyn!

These cinnamon rolls were great.  The brown sugar gets a great caramel flavor to it.  I didn't feel like waiting overnight to cook them, so I just let the rolls rise for an hour or two at room temperature after they were formed.  They do get awfully brown in the oven, but they taste great.

I doubled the cinnamon/brown sugar filling because I am “extra” that way!  Otherwise, these were easy to make and I would compare them to Cinnabon! Will be making these again for company next time!

Great recipe! My first time using a yeast dough and this recipe was the perfect one to use. I do recommend checking the oven after 20 mins because at 28 mins mine were pretty crispy! Next time I’ll definitely cut back the baking time. I also used my own recipe for icing.

These were really, really good!! I followed the recipe except for a couple of things. I softened 1/2 a stick of butter & spread on dough before adding brown sugar/cinnamon mixture, followed a more simple icing recipe (I didn't have corn syrup or half & half on hand- recipe I used just called for milk, powdered sugar, butter and vanilla) and also baked at 350 for 22 minutes. Oh- and did not add raisins. :P The dough was great. Rose just enough, good density, good flavor- not too sweet or yeasty tasting. Saving & will make again!

I missed the 25-30 cooking time frame and pulled them out at 27 minutes and they were a tad bit dry.  For our family, I will increase the cinnamon mixture in the  middle.  For the glaze, I substituted blue agave nectar for the corn syrup and it was perfect.  Second time I made them,   I made adjustments to the time and  the temp

These aren't my favourite, either the rolls or the icing.  Too sweet. I prefer a simple butter, icing sugar, vanilla and milk drizzle over the buns.

I've been making these for my husband, who loves cinnamon rolls, for years. Sometimes I freeze them so I can just defrost them whenever I want. (I freeze them after I roll & cut them then when I want to make them I just let them defrost in the fridge overnight & let them rise & bake them.) Sometimes I glaze them & sometimes I frost them.  These are very good cinnamon rolls & I have actually used the dough as rolls too. They are delicious as rolls- a little heavy & sweet.

This is now my go to recipe for cinnamon rolls.  I do however use a cream cheese frosting instead of the one in the recipe (Just because I like cream cheese).  Highly recommend this recipe even though it is a bit more time consuming.

Good not great. Easy. Might make again with these changes. Made 28 rolls. Kinda dry ( not sure how to fix this).  Add total of 1 cup sugar, 2 tbsp of vanilla, and 1 tbsp of cinnamon to batter.  Add soften  butter to  rolled out dough before adding sugar filling. Double filling with equal parts brown and white sugar. Double cinnamon. Allow to rise a little longer than an hour, rose well. Second rising at room temp didn't rise as well, maybe also a little longer than 30 mins. Rose well while baking. Cream cheese icing a must!

The dough is perfect. I used instant yeast instead of traditional. I had to double the filling portion listed in the receipe. Like many others I added some soft butter to the filling. For glazing I used another reviewer recommendation and used butter instead of corn syrup, made it richer. This is a keeper. Thanks

Definitely will make again. Dough turned out very well, though a tad dry. Need to find something to add to it.  I did add apple pie filling on top of the brown sugar. Makes it a little harder to roll but definitely worth it.

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years, but am just now getting a chance to review. I make dough exactly as written. I bake these in a 13x9 and am able to get 12 huge cinnamon rolls from the recipe. They are always perfect, and I love that I can throw them in the fridge before I got to bed, and have a homemade breakfast ready quickly for the kids before school.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did add a little vanilla to the dough and put melted butter on rectangle before adding cinnamon topping.  Topped with my own cream cheese icing recipe - they were scrumptious!  Loved that most of work was night before.

These were so good!  I altered the recipe to make it dairy free for a friend, just by using almond milk and dairy free margarine.  Plus I spread margarine on the rolled out dough before spreading the brown sugar and cinnamon on.  They rose beautifully in the fridge overnight and were ready to burst out of the pan after cooking them.  Served with my own cream cheese frosting and they were a huge hit. I will absolutely make these again and again!

This is the second cinnamon roll recipe I've tried and is my new go-to! I followed the instructions exactly both times and both times had beautiful results. I kneaded the dough by hand for 10 minutes and the dough was silky smooth in the end. My personal preference would be for the recipe to yield more icing, but that's a pretty easy fix (I like mine super sweet!). I highly recommend this recipe and will definitely be making these again and again and again! My whole family loved them!!

This recipe is perfect!! I made these for Christmas morning breakfast and they were a hit!! It's nice to be able to make them the day before with the kiddos and then just pop them in the oven the next day. I didn't change anything. I did use a stand mixer with the hook attachment, but ended up kneading it by hand for 8 minutes like the recipe says. These were beautiful, puffy cinnamon rolls. THEY WILL BE MADE AGAIN!!

I made these following the recipe almost exactly. The only change I did was to spread the dough with softened butter before sprinkling on the brown sugar and cinnamon, prior to rolling it into a log. My family loved them and have asked me to make them for Christmas morning. I, unfortunately, didn't get to taste them, as I knocked the pan off the counter, losing  over half the batch.

Easy! My family loves them. Instead of a glaze, I put butter, brown sugar and pecans in the bottom of the pan before placing the rolls. Then after baking I turned them out on a platter. Caramel sticky buns!! Saves the extra step in the morning.

I substituted 2 cups of whole wheat flour and otherwise followed the directions as written.  I had some trouble rolling out the dough but I should have let it rest longer to make the rolling easier.  The flavor was good.  The sugar did run out of the bottom of the rolls so the pan was messy but it was worth it.  I'll be making these again.  My family loved them.

What a great start to 2016! Made these New Years Eve and refrigerated the dough overnight.    Followed the roll recipe as posted, except with some minor modifications.  Painted melted butter on the dough with a marinade brush prior to adding the filling.  Baked in 325 deg oven set on convention for about 30 - 35 min. Pulled from the oven when the internal temperature reached between 185 and 190 degrees. Covered the rolls loosely with aluminum foil for the last 8 minutes, since the rolls were nicely browned. The final roll was very delicate and light when baked this way, even though the dough seemed very dense when originally rolled out. Topped with a Browned Butter Icing. Will make again!

This recipe is amazing. I made these for Christmas morning. My family went wild for them with milk and coffee. I was told that they were better than Cinnabon.  I made no changes to this recipe.  You must take the time and roll the dough tightly. It makes a huge difference. This was my second attempt at this recipe. My first rolls weren't rolled tight enough, but the flavor made me give it another try. Glad I did.

These were AMAZING!  My first try with homemade cinnamon rolls and they came out perfectly.  I made the dough in the bread machine and omitted the raisins and otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Perfection.

This is delicious - I have made this recipe for years for Christmas breakfast.  I make it as stated but slather on about one whole stick of butter on the dough before sprinkling on the cinnamon-brown sugar and raisin/walnut mixture.  I only sometimes add walnuts, which are sortof mentioned in the instructions but not the ingredient list.  My kids love it : )

These are insanely good.  I wanted to make real, old fashioned cinnamon rolls from scratch and that's exactly what I got.  They were cinnamon-y and gooey and sweet and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I think next time I might use a different icing as I didn't love the slight powdered-sugar taste of this icing but overall they were delicious.  I will be making these for Christmas day.  Love that I can do most of the work the day before and just pop them in the oven in the morning.

I just made this recipe and it came out pretty good.  The dough tasted a little bit "yeasty" to us.  When you bake them for the first time, I suggest dropping the cook time by at least 5 minutes.  I did 25 minutes vs. the 30 minutes and they were definitely done...a bit too brown to my liking.  The glaze should also be doubled if you are looking for ooey gooey cinnamon rolls. Overall, a good recipe, I will make it again.

I made the rolls a couple of times and they were great, but I will never stop using the fantastic glaze!! I tweaked it a little by doubling the vanilla in the recipe, and I liked it better that way.

This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls for christmas this year and they turned out wonderful!  They were easy to make and rolled out so nice.  I let the dough rise for about two hours in a warm oven.  I used twine to cut the rolls off.  So happy I tried these!

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner... I made them the night before and refrigerated them.  They traveled well to my parent's house and we cooked them after we ate dinner.  Oh. My. Goodness!  They are amazing!  I was able to get 16 of them, not 12 and they were definitely huge.  My next effort will be to find freezable pans that will fit just 3 at a time and freeze them that way, as it is just me, my husband, and son, and we can't eat more than one at a time.   AMAZING!!!  Thanks for this recipe!  I will definitely make it again and again!

I was surprised these turned out as well as they did - and they turned out very well!   Like others said, the dough was goopy seemed like it took FOR-ever for the dough to get to the consistency I needed - my Kitchenaide was actually hot to the touch when I was done.  The dough took an hour and 20 minutes to rise, but rolled out very well on some heavily floured Silpat. They were very brown on top at the 20 minute mark so I covered the pan loosely with foil and moved it to the bottom rack.  

However, the kids and my husband love them.  I rarely eat breads for breakfast, so I just had a slice and it was pretty darn tasty.  I'm going to try proofing the yeast next time, and will probably add more filling.

Turns out every time. Love it! I use cream cheese, vanilla and powdered sugar for the frosting. I like it better, not as sweet.

My family and I Didn't Like these. The Cinnamon Roll it Self Was Too much Like a Biscuit, and Just was not appetizing to us.

These were very good. Wished I had put some butter inside along with cinnamon and brown sugar before I had baked. Instead I put a little on each top before baking.

Not as easy to make as the title suggests, this being my first time to make cinnamon rolls from scratch, it took me some time to read through the recipe to make sure I had it right.  Almost missed the adding of only 3 !!! cups instead of 4.5 of flour.  I didn't have a mixer, so I made these entirely be hand, with some elbow grease to kneed them for the entire 8 minutes.   I added extra cinnamon to the filling, and plenty of pecans and almonds instead of raisins. I recommend binding the bread more tightly, I had loose rolls that I had to tighten 2/3s through the cutting process -- hint hint, use floss to cut the rolls.  These made 2 pie dishes worth of rolls, and they both went into my refrigerator with a lot of my other holiday food.    Morning arrived, and I happily pulled breakfast out of the fridge.  While baking, I used the cinnamon rolls II Cream cheese icing because the reviews gave it such a poor rating.  They were yummy! Make for a crowd! And enjoy:)

Delicious cinnamon rolls! This was my first time making my own cinnamon rolls from scratch, and I was interested in this recipe because you could make the dough the day before and let it rise overnight. I followed the dough recipe exactly as written, other than the raisins (substituted sliced almonds) and the rolls were delicious! Slightly crispy outside, soft and delicate inside. The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because the glaze is somewhat lacking in flavor, so I made a cream cheese frosting instead, which made these cinnamon rolls a 5-star recipe with that added to them. Made our Christmas morning extra special, thank you!

I don't know what I did wrong but things went terribly wrong someplace.   I followed the recipe exactly but the dough never rose and was incredible dense after baking.  I'm glad I tried these ahead of time.  The plan was to make these for Christmas morning. I'll probably just make a coffee cake instead.

I made this cinnamon roll recipe and found that it had too much flour.  I will decrease the flour by 1/2 cup.  I found the dough after baked--tough and dry. I also put more brown sugar in the roll out than suggested; along with using cream instead of half & half. Made a richer icing.

I make these at night some times and take em to work the next morning and throw em in the oven there. People think they have died and gone to heaven. I do use a different icing though. One with cream cheese.

When I first made this, I was multi-tasking and got the dough confused with my one for pitas!  It was still edible, but I had to try again.      They were good.  I think you could do the overnight trick with almost any other recipe too.    Some of the filling seeps out of the rolls overnight.  I also think I will add cinnamon to the dough next time.  These are very pretty.

I made them for Easter Sunday Brunch and they turned out just wonderful. I did add a tablespoon of softened butter to the filling and doubled the amount of cinnamon to give it a richer taste. I also used cream cheese icing (Cinnamon Rolls III) instead of the one given in this recipe and it melted just right on the warm rolls. 
A friend made the same recipe just as it is for another brunch and they turned out great as well. She did substitute the cornsyrup with honey, though.I guess it just depends on personal preferences.
I made 8 rolls in a 10"-springform pan and they were done after 20 minutes (I had to put aluminum foil on the top so they would not burn after 15 min.)

We loved these.  I didn't make them the night before, I made them in the morning for a brunch.  I will make them overnight next time though.  I looked at other, more indulgent recipes, but I am so glad I went with this one.  I wouldn't have wanted it any richer or sweeter.  This recipe made me feel like an accomplished baker - the results were not only tasty, but beautiful!

Ok, I rarely post reviews but these rolls are excellent.  I made them up the night before Easter and was sure they would flop.  Took them out before church and did pop them in a warm oven for a few.  They baked up amazingly good.  I kept to the recipe with the exception of some butter on the dough to make the sugar mix stick and lowered the temp to 350.  I did not proof the yeast and it worked perfectly.  Thanks for the perfect end to Easter brunch!

I have never had much luck with dough but this recipe seems foolproof and the rolls were a big hit.  I will definitely make this again and also probably try it with other fillings.

I made these just last night and into this breakfast.. they were really tasty.  The only problems I had was: the dough was a little hard to work with, the glaze needed more flavoring and I put them in for the whole 30 mins.. which made the tops a bit tough. But these are all probably my fault.. so I won't degrade the recipe..  =)

What can I say, another big hit in this house.  My kids are very fond of cinnamon rolls and needless to say, they didn't last very long.  We all enjoyed them.  The kids are asking for me to fix them again.  They love to have them for breakfast before school.  But there again, they love them anytime.

Very good recipe.  My family loved these cinnamon rolls.  I did make a couple changes.  When I took them out the next day,  I melted 1/3 c. butter and 2/3 c. brown sugar over medium heat and boiled 1 min.  I poured this in the bottom of a pan and then placed the rolls on top of that sauce.  Its wonderful because it soaks into rolls while they are cooking.  I also used a cream cheese glaze and did not add raisins.

These were absolutely fantastic! My husband is such a cinnamon roll fan, but I never make them because they take so much time. This was the best recipe because I made them Christmas Eve and had the best Christmas breakfast ever:-) Great job.

I liked that you could split the preparation time up by doing most of it the night before. They rose beautifully once in the oven. The bread part didn't have much flavor though. Not sure what to add to that. I didn't have corn syrup so made the icing from cinnamon rolls II.

My frist time making these-easy to follow  instructions. I left out the raisins for a more traditional roll. I found these to be quite bland for my taste. I would recommend more sugar & cinnamon in the dough. I like my Cinnamon Rolls SWEET!

So the cinnamon rolls themselves are AMAZING.  Delicious.  The glaze... not so much.  I think I'm going to switch to a cream-cheese glaze, perhaps with just a HINT of kahlua.  Tasty.

Awesome! Everyone in the family loved them, so they are now a staple on Saturday mornings. I use golden raisins... they are juicier. There isn't enough glaze in one batch, though. It usually takes 3 or 4 batches to get through. And also,it doesn't just make 12... one time I made 25 large rolls out of one batch! I usually get around 14 or 15.

Let me quote my husband...The Picky Eater..."Tastes just like they came from the bakery.*" I made up the dough, the night before. In the morning, I shaped the rolls (using 1/2 cup brown suagr and 1/4 cup white sugar)...Let them rise for 1 hour and baked them for 25 minutes. (9x13" pan..thirteen rolls...*Baker's Dozen..ha, ha)We are not into too sweet, so I only used half of the icing. Ground nuts, sprinkled on top and...Perfect!

This is now my go-to cinnamon roll recipe. I've made them several times and they always turn out delicious.  I do make sure to coat the dough pretty thoroughly with butter before adding the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I also use my own cream cheese frosting recipe and they turn out divine.

These were quite good and a fun project when you have the time. Overall though, I will probably just buy the oven-ready cinnamon roll dough from now on. It's a lot easier. This is nice if you want something special and homemade.

Mine came out a little dry.  I may have overcooked the rolls.  I did have to add more flour than called for because the dough was sticky.  I will make this again to perfect.  This was a great Christmas morning breakfast for my family.

I'm giving this recipe a five based on the flavor of the dough and the easiness of the recipe.  I used the filling and icing from the "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe on this site because it sounded more appealing to me.

I made these, as is, without raisins.  I think they were delicious.  They didn't rise in my fridge at all, so I was worried, but they did rise during the preheat and baked nicely.  I enjoyed the fact that they weren't TOO goo-ey.  Even my 'difficult-to-cook-for' father enjoyed them when I took them over for him.

This recipe will make you the workplace hero! I brought these to work this morning all warm and yummy! I was a little worried because the dough wasn't rising but they came out of the oven perfect! Next time I will make 2x the icing. I will be making these a lot in the future!

Great recipe that is easy to follow.  I haven't used a recipe that required yeast in a long time and was a little worried that the dough wouldn't rise properly.  I omitted the raisins and added a little more cinnamon (the way my kids like them).   I also made my own icing using a little cream cheese and butter, instead of the corn syrup.  My family loved them!

I haven't made these yet, but I've eaten them, and they are wonderful! My friend actually made them vegan — substituting apple sauce for the eggs, soy for the milk, and some butter alternative — and they were wonderful. I never would have guessed they were vegan, and they weren't too sweet. Great for the rushed morning, too!

I am so impressed with this recipe. It was easy to make and turned out wonderful.  I did not put nuts or raisins in the rolls, and forgot to turn the bread over so it was oiled while it was in the bowl rising. I did use a thermometer to make sure the dough was at 82 degrees (I had a ceramic heater going nearby). This is definately a KEEPER!

I'll give these another try at a later date, but the initial run left a little to be desired.  Going by the "golden brown" tops wasn't a good inidicator of doneness and they were slightly underbaked this time.  The overall flavor was good and I did double the glaze as others had recommended - my family definitely has a huge sweet tooth.  I did like the fact that they could be prepared the night before and baked the next morning - they did rise in the fridge and a little more in the 30 minutes to room temperature phase.  I had to use a small wire whisk to dissolve the yeast in the luke warm milk/butter mixture as it wasn't dissolving with just stirring.

I liked these for 2 reasons: 1-you make them overnight, so you can pop them in in the morning and 2-they were really good fresh out of the over. Tasty breakfast treat. But one thing that isn't good about them is that they aren't good the next day. They are kind of tough and stiff. So I threw some away cuz I knew we wouldn't eat them if they weren't very tasty not fresh.

I changed this recipe a lot. I added sugar and cinnamon to the dough.  Before adding putting the filling on, I smeared the dough with softened butter.  I used more  filling than recommended.  It was fabulous.  I realized (after they were all gone) that I had completely forgotten the eggs... oops.  Couldn't even tell.  Messy, but delicious.

The only thing I would have done differently is add more filling.  Dough was beauiful and extremely easy to roll out.

Easy and delicious- I didn't have any problems with the dough, although I did make sure I kneaded it for the full eight minutes and let it rise for plenty of time. Very delicious overall! Will make again for a special breakfast.

This recipe is absolutely AWESOME!  I've made these several times and the results are always consistent and delicious!  I've even used the recipe to make dinner rolls by simply leaving out the cinnamon.  My family raves every time.  Thanks so much, Marilyn, for sharing this recipe!

This is a great recipe!  We made them for Christmas morning, and they were wonderful!  I will make these again, maybe as a new tradition in our house!

We loved this recipe.  I usually avoid yeast breads, because I can never get them to rise properly.  This recipe was so easy and very yummy!  My husband said, "These are blue ribbon, State Fair quality rolls!"  Thanks!

I found this dough hard to work with - it was a bit too wet.  After rolling, I added some butter, then the sugar and cinnamon, but it didn't roll up well, and when I cut it, the dough stuck to the knife and flattened the rolls out.  They didn't fare well overnight.  They did rise nicely in the oven, but because of the consistency of the dough, the butter, sugar and cinnamon had slid to the bottom of the pan and pretty much evaporated during baking.  I ended up with frosted bread.  Pretty disappointing - I'll keep looking for another recipe.

Much better than store bought, delicious filling and harder crust. My husband made a full batch of these and baked them fresh daily as we wanted them. A good standard recipe, better may be out there.

This recipe didnt work that well for me, i followed it to the letter and my rolls didn't rise in a warm place or overnight. If i make them again i will spread some butter on the dough before sprinkling the cinnamom and sugar because it didnt stick at all so when i cut the log up all of the filling fell out.

Mmmm... So good!
I did a little mistake though: I divided the recipe by 3 to have 4 rolls, but added 1 tsp of yeast, which I think was too much...? But they baked wonderfully, and I am not sure less yeast would have been better... Anyway, delicious! Thank you! Oh and for 4 rolls, the rectangle = 6 x 14".

These are great!  Not too sweet, and not too overloaded with cinnamon.  They are best right out of the oven, but are delicious anytime!

Absolutely delicious. I used bread flour instead of regular. I think this made them lighter. My friends want me to open a bakery making only these every morning.

I followed this recipe exactly.  It turned out nice but a little dry.  I'd say it is definitely better than Betty Crocker's version but nowhere near Cinnabon.  I don't think I'll try this again.  But, if you're looking for a VERY traditional version this is quite adequate.

These were pretty good.  I did something wrong with icing.  I don't know what, but it just wasn't right.  Other than that, pretty good.  Nice to make the night before and bake in the morning.
