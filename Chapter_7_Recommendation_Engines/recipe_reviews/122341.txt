this was delicious!! I used an 8oz pkg of sliced mushrooms & it was perfect.  I also blended most of the onion/mushroom mixture after sauteeing because I don't like the huge mushroom pieces, it turned out really good.  my family LOVED it!

take some mushrooms put them in a bag of flour and shake it around, it will taste about the same as this recipe. Seriously, about the only thing you taste in this one is flour. If you make this cut back on the flour.

So simple and so delicious!  I did blend the mushrooms a tad, but the recipe is perfect.  I added some italian seasoning and olive oil and topped with Parmesan cheese the second time I made it and it was awesome.

This was a great mushroom soup.  I reduced the cream by 1/2 a cup and used 1/2 cup of 1% milk; I don't think it  make a difference to the taste but helped to reduce fat content.

Cream of mushroom soup just as it should be - clean, fresh flavors with just a few simple ingredients,  the mushroom flavor clearly center stage.  No garlic, no sherry, no herbs or any of a million other add-ins to distract.  I used heavy cream rather than half-and-half but I also reduced the amount of flour to 1/4 cup.  I used mini bella mushrooms and threw in some fresh chives for color and interest.  This was perfect.

Great recipe.  I followed the recipe except I used self rising flour and only about 4 tbsp. of it and I also added a small amount of Extra Virgin Olive oil to the butter at the beginning. Very tasty.  It has allot of flavor.  Doesn't need extra salt because the chicken broth was salty.

Very good and simple.  I added a tsp of garlic powder and substituted 1/2 tsp celery salt for the regular to spice it up a little. I also took the advice of another user and pureed the sauted veggies as well. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent soup - comfort food at it's best.

I made it exactly as listed (the only way you should if you're going to post a review).

Five stars!

So delicious! Simple, easy and so, so mushroomy! I used a mix of cremini and white button mushrooms and it made a lot, which is what I wanted to have for lunches all week. It was a bot thinner than I expected, but that's easily fixed with less broth.

I often make recipes calling for canned cream of mushroom soup-- something that I do not keep on hand. This recipe works beautifully both on its own and cooked as part of a dish. The larger mushroom pieces and better flavor will really make your recipes stand out. I make it in large batches and freeze in can sized portions.

Absolutely delicious, my husband never eats vegetables but this recipe has converted him. Didnt use half and half (single cream in UK?) So used double cream, but less of it. Excellent!

Very simple, very yummy.  A quick meal when you're home late on a snowy evening.  I blended a small amount with the imersion blender for a deeper consistancy.  The thyme was perfect.

My friend and I loved this soup, although we altered it a bit... we used oil instead of butter, more stock and less cream, shallots instead of onions, but, we LOVED it!  It was very simple and delicious!  We also used a mixture of Chanterelles, porcini, regular and oyster mushrooms; we also blended some of the mushrooms prior to adding some of the stock.

I LOVED this soup!  It came out so incredibly yummy; WAY better Campbells in a can!  I was looking for a recipe that would replace just that, actually, as an ingredient to another recipe and I thought, "Well, I'll just eat up the extra soup!"  My family hates mushrooms (except me) in small quantities, so I got to enjoy every last drop.  Lol. Anyway, as my replacement, I used a little less than 3 cups of pre-made chicken broth instead of getting the canned version.  At the simmer part I admit I let it simmer a little longer than 15 minutes so it could really get good and thick and I also added a dash of garlic powder since I love garlic.  As for some people saying it was "flour-y", I wonder if they made sure they pre-mixed the flour with the broth (I mean REALLY mixed - no clumps, broth should've turned a creamier color)? Anyway, the recipe is super easy - Thanks, you've made one happy mushroom lover.  :).

Tasted like flour.  Used Swanson's Organic Chicken broth ... not sure if I will try this recipe again using my own homemade broth.  It had a nice consistency and otherwise looked good but the flavor just wasn't there.  I even added a boullion cube but could still taste too much flour and then boullion.  Sorry.

Used baby bellas & added a bit of dried thyme and a cup of white wine (+ T. cornstarch) - delicious! I was afraid it wouldn't have enough flavor without these additions, but think it would be great as written also!

This was delicious.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the method needed changing, I thought.  I added the flour to the onion and mushrooms (in their oil) and cooked that roux until the flour was cooked - THEN added the broth and proceeded.  Very good.  If you have a sprig of fresh thyme, that is a good addition, but is great as is.

This recipe was just what I needed for my green bean casserole after no cream of mushroom soup without garlic could be found in any store. I bought a pound of mushrooms and made the recipe finding that I needed to cut the muchrooms smaller after I had sauted them. It was exactly what I wanted and I will never buy the canned soup again.

This soup was excellent very creamy and full of flavour.  I would thin it out a bit using less flour or more chicken broth.

I made this recipe today and it was the best cream of mushroom soup I've ever had.  The only different thing I did was add some fresh grated garlic and Tony's seasoning.

I did add 2 cloves or minced garlic to my onions after Ihad sauted for a few minutes and I used my imersible blender to incorporate the ingredients before I added the half and half and then once again just for a quickie swirl. Very good and I am hoping it will freeze well. I have enough to serve my boyfriend and I for another dinner!!! Yummy.

This soup was excellent!

I added some frozen corn.  

This would also be good with chicken, broccoli or any other vegetables

I bought some mushrooms in bulk at a farmers market..and needed a recipe to save my mushrooms..before time got to them.  This recipe was GREAT!  I followed this basically. I added a little more spice and tripled the recipe. My entire family (including those who do not like mushrooms) Loved this!! I highly recommend this!!  I will never buy canned again.

This was very tasty!  I used green onions, used garlic salt instead of regular salt, and pureed about 1/2 of the soup once it was done.  I don't usually cook on Friday evenings but this was so easy and quick that I am glad I cooked!  Great with a grilled cheese sandwich!

Really good and simple.  I used cornstarch to thicken it and added 1 cup of soy milk instead of half and half and I blended it until chunky with a hand blender.  It came out really great, served it with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and feta cheese salad.  Delicious!

I followed this recipe to the letter. The flavor is very good but I thought the amount of mushrooms was skimpy. I would at least double them next time. Also I didn't have chicken broth so I used chicken bouillon and therefore left out the salt. It ended up needing just a touch of salt in the end.

Very good basic recipe. I used a rehydrated mix of mushrooms that I had on hand. As many others did, I cut the flour to about 4 TBSP and used about 3/4 cup of 1% milk and only 1/4 cup half and half to cut down on the fat. Added a few shakes of thyme and garlic powder and a splash of white wine at the end.

Wonderful flavor; tasted restaurant quality!  We used half & half in place of cream, used a mixture of the small portobellos and white mushrooms and added sherry to the sautee mixture and let it simmer long enough for the mushrooms to absorb.  Pureed at least half the soup, to thicken it up, and it was the perfect consistency - still had some mushroom pieces in for a rustic feel.  I was surprised how great it tasted, given the simple list of ingredients!

I had mushrooms that needed to be cooked, so I made this soup.  The only change I made was to use milk instead of half & half.  It's delicious! I used Portabella and brown mushrooms.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent soup.  First time making mushroom soup and it was fabulous.  
I used shitake mushrooms and added 1/4 tsp. of Thyme and a pinch of Tarragon.  This has so much flavor I was amazed.

This was a great, easy soup and made a real hit with my family. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 white buttons and 1/2 baby bellas. First time around I followed the recipe pretty closely. Next time around I may add a few simple herbs, less salt and a dash of sherry at the end.

My husband just loves this website.... Now he thinks he is a chef or something. Now he wont even let me tell him any of my secrets. He took this recipe and doubled the flour, pepper, onions, and mushrooms to add to egg noodles for swedish meatballs. They did turn out great.

This was a really good soup. Like some suggested, I cut down the flour to 4 tbsp and I only used about 20 oz of broth. I also added garlic. I simmered it, then blended it. Very good, especially for a first meal after dental work. It was even better the next day after the mushroom flavor had time to permeate the entire soup!

This is the best soup.   I added 1/2 teas of minced garlic to the onion.  Then I chopped the mushrooms before cooking.  This made the mushrooms cook quicker and brought out the flavor more.  I didn't have any half and half so I used whole milk, but the soup was delicious anyway.  I am going to try the samed recipe only substitute some chopped chicken in place of the mushrooms.

I picked this soup because of the short cooking time and thought it was excellent. I added to the recipe 2 cloves of minced garlic while cooking the mushrooms and at the end while simmering i added a dash of worcestershire sauce. It was great! Thanks for a great winter soup in 30mins.

This is really delicious & easy! My husband loves Cream of Mushroom soup & we usually just heat up a can,but this is so much tastier & fresher. He loved it! I made it exact to the recipe even those there's only 2 of us,because tomorrow I'm trying the Gravy Baked Pork Chops (on this site) & using the leftover soup for the gravy part. I'll write a review afterwards. Next time I will try half of all the ingredients & it should work out great for 2 bowls of soup. Great recipe!!

Great receipe. Used half regular and half shiitake mushrooms.  Boiled the broth separately using the stems from the shiitake mushrooms for a more mushroomy flavor.  Also, used white cooking wine while sauteeing the mushrooms to give it a richer flavor. I used a 1% milk vs. half and half. This gave it a lower fat content and a lighter consistency.

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was creamy and delicious.  The proportions were perfect. I then added some leftover  chicken, corn and peas from last night's dinner. It was a great way to use up leftovers and the corn actually added a nice crunch.  I will definitely make this recipe again - with or without leftovers.

Yum! I needed a quick dinner option in a hurry and had everything on hand. Although I followed the proportions, I made a few healthy subsitutions: organic mushroom broth instead of chicken broth, whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and whole goat milk instead of cream. I also used a medley of mushrooms, which included portobello, shiitake, and a few others. I think mixing up the mushrooms is the secret to making this a tasty soup! As for using milk instead of cream, I was pleasantly surprised how thick the soup came out in the end - and especially the following day. I kept the mushrooms chunky (personal preference) and we gobbled it up in no time. Thanks for this simple, but tasty recipe. :-)

Great recipe with a few changes to it, Instead of 3 cups of mushrooms i added 6 cups as my husband loves mushrooms. i added 2 cups of white button mushrooms, 2 cups of crimini (brown) mushrooms and 2 cups of sliced portabello. and i added 1/2 cup of onions instead of 1/4. also to cut down on the flour taste i used cornstarch , less of it but twice the thickening power. it was thickend i added about 1/4 tbsp of celery salt. made it that much better.

This was really delicious! I combined the flour with a bit of water and made a paste first before adding it to the broth so it wouldn't clump. You do have to stir it a lot. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken and added a touch of parsley and cayenne pepper. My husband raved about it!!

Delicious,simple and elegant! I don't purée the mushrooms at my husband's request, this simplifies the process further.

This was SO YUMMY... My family loves mushrooms so I took a 12oz pack of mushrooms, blended them up in the processor so they where really mushy, then took another 12oz pack & chopped them in big chunks... I also used heavy cream instead of half-&-half, I didn't add salt, chicken broth was salty enough... It was VERY Yummmmy!!!!

No flavor, not worth the effort to make as is.  After several changes, such as less flour to thicken, addition of sherry and nutmeg, less chicken broth, addition of garlic and herbs - then it was good, but then it also wasn't this recipe!

This soup is excellent.   I don't use the onions because I don't like them, but it still has a lot of flavor and is perfect for cold weather.  I put a fresh slice of real unsalted butter in each bowl when I serve it and I serve it with fresh bread.  You can also make croutons by slicing the bread, putting a bit of olive oil and parmesan cheese on it and sliding it into the oven until the bread is crunchy.  Then put the croutons in your soup!!!

Just OK! Added less broth because the mushrooms made quite a bit of juice when sauteed, even after rinsing and letting them sit on a towel on the counter for a few hours. I also used fat free 1/2 and 1/2. I've been adding to it to try and jazz it up a bit. Doesn't really taste like much. Maybe my mushrooms had no flavor?? Might try again because it is easy!

This was wonderful.  Very rich soup.  I followed the directions exactly.  One thing that I would change would be to mince at least part of the mushrooms.  I felt that they got a little overpowering.  The broth is excellent.

Wonderful! I only had two cups of mushrooms on hand (half portbello and half white), but it didn't seem to make a difference. I also followed Erin's advice and added celery salt in leiu of regular salt, and a few dashes of garlic powder. Oh, I also used one shallot instead of a regular onion. All in all, a very high quality soup. Restaurant quality, and very easy to make.Thanks for sharing this!

It was very good. I added a tsp of garlic powder as did one reader. I also coarsely chopped my mushrooms and used fat free half & half.  Next time, I would use a full pound of mushrooms and less half and half.  I served the soup to my husband for lunch along with homemade herb and garlic bread.

I thought this was an easy recipe to make with a lot in my control.  I used cremini and button mushrooms.  I used about 1/2 more mushrooms, as I really like mushrooms.  It was also thinner than canned versions which I prefer.  I also control the salt which I can't do in canned versions.

I've made this several times and it's yumo. My only negative comment is that when I make a recipe that calls for a can of cream of mushroom soup, I recommend you don't use this. This recipe is way to tasty to do that with. Super easy as well, people think you cooked this hours.

I have used this by itself, in casseroles and in pot pies.  It comes out great.  As far as Chipper's review, all I can say is make sure you cook the flour.  That's true for any roux.

Made this a while ago to put into a casserole and decided it was good enough to try as a soup alone. Just made it and was so right. I used crimini mushrooms and it was so good.

Being my first attempt at the soup, I REALLY liked this recipe. I added 1 TBSP butter, used 8oz cremini mushrooms sliced very thin and 5oz pulsed white mushrooms. Also added 1/2 cup white wine while I sauted butter, onion and all the mushrooms. I also used heavy cream. Oh, and only 4 tbsp of the flour. I really enjoyed it!!

I've printed out several mushroom soup recipes from the site.  Instead of using half and half I chose to use heavy whipping cream instead, gave it richer taste.  While I'm not a heavy fan of cream of mushroom soup, I have to admit it was delicious.  If your disabled and live alone like me it's a nice little project to pass some time.

I made this soup and it was wonderful.  I did not have 1/2 and 1/2 so made it with heavy cream, excellent. I reduced chicken broth to one 14.5 oz can and 3 Tbs of flour.  I like lots of mushrooms in my soup.

Such a good soup! I added a roux, which even though it adds fat, added so much taste. Definitely going to make this again

Doesn't even compare to canned mushroom soup. So deliciously good. I didn't have cream so I sauteed a zucchini with the onion and butter then blended in the food processor, helped thicken the soup and turned out great. Looking forward to making again!

Came out just fine, but I added my flour to the butter mixture, made a roux, cooked that for a few minutes, and then I added the broth. It thickened up nicely during the last 15 minutes of cooking.

I found I wanted a thicker soup. I think next time I might double the mushrooms and puree half the mushroom/onion mixture.

It is quick and simple but I definitely think garlic powder and a dash of celery salt is needed.  Otherwise all I tasted was the flour.

This recipe was really flavorful. I let my kids help me prepare this one and they LOVED it even though it is like pulling teeth to get them to eat any kind of soup.  

I will say that I ended up using heavy cream instead of the half-and-half (yeah, I know). It was all that I had and while not the most healthy way to make this recipe, it sure tasted delcious!
