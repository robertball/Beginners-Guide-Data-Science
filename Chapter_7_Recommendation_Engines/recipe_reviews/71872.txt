I was a little surprised at how good this came out. It is a bit cowboy-like, but it tasted very good and is low fat. I did make a few minor modifications, but I think the dish without alterations would be good. First I sauteed the onion with some garlic and chopped green pepper before adding the meat to brown. I don't know what ranch-style beans are, so I used black beans. Following some reviewers comments, I added a can of creamed corn. And I put the whole thing in the slowcooker. Throughout the week, I served this in different ways and it always was delicious, especially with some homemade southern style cornbread. I'll certainly make this again.

It's aiit but has definite possibilities. It's a bit bland for my tastes but worth working with due to the low calorie content.  I can't decide if I want to add garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano or all of the above.  I am leaning towards all of the above : )

I love this recipe! So easy and tasty.  My son feels the plain hamburger was a bit bland so we may experiment w/ country sausage or with seasonings for chili as suggested by another reviewer. We're having casual supper on Christmas Day and I plan to make a huge pot of this. Thanks for sharing it.

This recipe was as tasty as people implied. Originally we contemplated seasoning the beef but I'm glad we didn't. Also the amount of onion was a bit scary but I'm glad I put the whole thing in because the taste was fabulous. We removed the seeds from the chile and also added the equivalent of 2 cloves of garlic. I'm so excited to have so many leftovers of this simple tasty recipe.

this recipe is truly easy and delicious. I substituted ground turkey for the beef as a matter of preference. I also used canned green chopped chiles to make it even easier. I'll defenitely be making this again.

This was tasty, crowd-pleasing, and super easy. I added ground red pepper, and it would also taste good with any seasonings you'd use in chili. Thanks for sharing.

Really liked this.  Made it for a bean bake-off at church and it was popular.  We let it simmer longer - the flavors blend better and the beef ends up more tender.  When I make it again (and I will) I use more corn.

This was great.  There's only the two of us so we had 1/2 left.  Put small box of mac and cheese in left overs and finished it the next night.

Decently good, not at all spicy, perhaps a little bland. I substituted a can of green chilies for the two fresh ones, which could be why. I'd make it again, but not a show-stopper.  It was very quick and easy, however.  And one my toddler-aged kids could totally help with (dump cans and rinse).

Glad I halved the recipe, since there are only 2 of us here.  I used no salt tomatoes, rinsed the kidney beans and used 3/4 cup frozen corn, so I had to add about 1/2 cup of water to the mix, then I added about 1/2 teaspoon smoked salt.  Perfect, easy to make variation on chili.  Will make again.

I've made this recipe 5 times now.. always something is a variation, an extra can of corn, didn't find the ranch style beans the last time and diced tomatoes with different types of hot peppers in them. Tonight's tomato is with Jalepeño peppers. Always yummy. Thank you for sharing!

Just OK. On the comfort food side of things. Underseasoned, bland. I won't make again without some big changes—perhaps add some chipotles in adobo, and some chile powder.

This is a wonderful treat!  We loved the flavors and textures in the stew. I took the leftovers and frozen them in single serving containers which made great lunches.

My kind of recipe.  Tasty, easy to make, and also easy to change ingredients based on what's in the pantry or frig.  I added sliced carrots that I wanted to use up.  The recipe makes a lot of stew.  I decided to use only one can of beans.  I like spicy hot and I like dishes that are not spicy hot.  This is not a spicy dish.  At least not with the green chilies I used.  But it is always easy to add more fire.  To change up the leftovers just a little, I am going to add more heat and serve with a dollop of sour cream and some chopped cilantro.

I prepared this as is and I thought it was a little bland.  So I added chili powder, oregano, and cumin and it was delicious!
