Excellent marinade for fijitas.  I nixed the cayenne pepper because I don't like spicy.  I let the chicken marinade for 1 hour.  As it was marinating, I cut up the veggies.  I then placed about 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil in the cold skillet.  I put the skillet in the oven and then let it heat up to 425 degrees. When the oven was preheated I added the veggies and raw chicken in the hot oil.  Baked it for 30 minutes.  Tasted just like what you'd get in a good Mexican restaurant.

By far, the best thing I've made since joining allrecipes.  The spices blend beautifully and play off of each other. The marinade time of two hours was ideal. I'm not a big fan of cayenne, so I substituted Badia fajita seasoning and gave the marinade just a dash of cayenne. I will definitely make this again!  Feel free to contact me with any questions. I'm always looking for foodie friends. My email is ljs4141@aol.com.

This marinade was enough for 5 pounds of blsl chicken breasts, which I pounded to 1/2inch thickness.  Since there were no directions for marinating time, or cooking, I marinated in a large freezer bag for only one hour, and then grilled.  DS said "I like the chicken this way."  this is a huge compliment, for he usually doesn't say anything!  I liked the flavor, and DH did, too.  The chicken was moist and tender, with a delicate flavor.  I will likely make this again, though I probably won't serve it in a tortilla.  My only sub was to use about 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, in lieu of the garlic cloves. Edited 1/16/17: I see the time listed in the description of the recipe, at the top of the page, beside the photos.  Oops!

OMGoodness!  I did use fresh squeezed orange juice instead of bottled and chili powder for the cayenne because that's what I had. I also added an extra lime because we love the flavor.  I poured over four boneless/skinless chicken breasts and four drumsticks into a plastic freezer bag making sure to get all the air out and marinating for three hours.  The results were fantastic. Juicy, well seasoned chicken with a tantalizing layer of flavors.  The chili powder added a nice smokiness that my family liked. We will definitely use this marinade again.  A+.

Excellent marinade!  I halved the amounts for 1 lb of chicken breasts.  I also added a tsp of chili powder.  This will be my new "go to" recipe for fajitas.

Excellent marinade, although the recipe doesn't indicate how much meat to use or how long to marinade it. I marinated 2 lbs. of chicken for 2 hours and it turned out well.

This marinade was spot on.  There was a little kick from it, but the heat factor was just right in my opinion. I like things hot but could see where others might find it too much.  My wife who is very picky devoured two fajitas at dinner and actually reheated the leftovers.  She never does leftover chicken. If that doesn’t tell you everything you need to know, I don’t know what else to say.

I made this marinade for 250g of chicken, cut up into small 1cm cubes. Divided the recipe measurements in half. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and added a tablespoon of cilantro chimichurri because I didn't have fresh cilantro on hand. After marinating the meat for only about 40 mins, I poured the entire thing on my pan and cooked the meat until all the marinade is absorbed and the chicken is seared. I tried this marinade for 250g of beef but added a tbsp of dark soy sauce. It was yummy as well.

I'm sorry, there was no flavor and I followed the recipe to a T.....maybe it needed to marinade overnight.

I didn't use cayenne, instead used the Hot "Slap Your Mamma", and used less oil, and lemon juice instead of lime"  

It was a hit and will make it again!  I marinated it overnight.

I went searching for an orange based chicken marinade for grilling and this came up.  It was made as listed with Korean red pepper vs. cayenne (less heat, more flavor in my book).  It was excellent used for a grilled chicken salad, light but flavorful.  While I haven't tried it as chicken fajitas, there is no reason to think that it wouldn't make a great fajita marinade  with spice adjusted to personal taste.

Made as written.  Fajitas turned out very good and chicken breast stayed moist.   Will likely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it did produce an edible grilled chicken but it did not taste like fajitas.  The only real flavor that came through was garlic - and it was definitely too much for us. This would be much better served on a salad with fruit (like oranges and apples).  If we have again, the recipe would just be a base and I'd add other seasonings like chili powder, more cumin, some onion powder, etc.  Oh well, not every recipe will be to our tastes.  Thanks for sharing.
