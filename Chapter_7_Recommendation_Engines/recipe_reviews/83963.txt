These were pretty good but they were missing "something". I think that adding tomatoes, a little lime juice and possibly some garlic would help.  I like Monterray Jack better than Pepper Jack, but hubby loves the Pepper Jack. I like having sour cream and jalapeno peppers for the side. Thanks for the post.

This was easy and very yummy. It was even good warmed up in the microwave the next day.
