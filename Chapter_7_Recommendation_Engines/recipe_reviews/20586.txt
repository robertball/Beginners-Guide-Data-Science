THis is a basic pudding.
I have read all the troubles people have been having with 'lumps' I did NOT follow the recipe as written. Everytime I have had to use cornstarch to thicken, and to add in a liquid I have ALWAYS known that the very best way to have no lumps is to disolve it in  COLD liquid. SO the easy solution...put all the dry ingrediants in the pot, including cornstarch. Add COLD milk/soy, whisk briskly until nicely disolved, THEN kick in the heat and continue. Wala! No lumps.

Yummy!  I love this recipe because it doesn't use eggs, which are, (to be perfectly honest!), a bit of a pain when making home-made puddings.  TO AVOID LUMPS, do not follow the directions as written.  Blend all dry ingredients in the pot you're going to cook the pudding in.  Then slowly whisk in the milk until it's blended.  THEN turn on the heat and start cooking!  I added cinnamon and nutmeg, which is absolutely delicious, but makes the pudding not as "pretty" because it turns it a bit dark.  We don't care...just like the flavor!  I also added 2 cups of cooked brown rice, to turn it into rice pudding.  If you like raisins in your rice pudding, just put 1/2 cup raisins in a 2-cup glass measure, add 1 cup water, and microwave 1 minute to "plump."  Drain and add to the cooked pudding along with the rice.  Raisins are an iron-rich fruit, and also add a lot of flavor!

This is a light and creamy pudding and delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to put the sugar, constarch, and salt in my saucepan first and then slowly added cold soy milk - stirring constantly. When well blended I turned on the burner and cooked until thickened. No lumps!  Another time I might add a little more vanilla.

I altered the recipe a bit, but my main complaint is that it was too sweet to eat (and I like sweets). I did not change the amount of sugar, but would cut it in half if I made this again. I did use only 2 Tbls. cornstarch, but added 1 egg yolk for thickening, richness, and color. I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. The flavor and consistency was great, just way too sweet.

I used half & half instead of milk.  I like my pudding rich and thick (spoiled by store-bought, I guess), so when it was thick enough to coat the back of a spoon I let it cool a bit, then whisked in 2 egg yolks and continued cooking & stirring until it was thick enough that it divided to show a streak of the bottom of the pot when stirred.  Was great, exactly what I was craving.  Would make a good pie filling too.

The consistency of this pudding was the best thing about it.  Perfect thickness for pie or pudding.  I got lumps the first time I made it, so the 2nd time, instead of heating the milk first, I put the dry ingredients in the pan & added the milk gradually while stirring, then cooked it, stirring constantly.  This prevented lumps.  Also it was too sweet for my taste so I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup.  I liked it better with less sugar, which was surprising because I am a huge sugaraholic.

I loved this! I put all of the ingredients except the butter in a lidded jar, shook to blend & then proceeded with the recipe as written. I had a vanilla bean which added tons of flavor. I had no problem with it setting up too thick, it turned out perfectly. I even used 1% milk! I can't wait to try it using other flavors & I might see how it freezes. Thanks so much for such a quick, easy, & delish recipe!:o)

This one is another winner! Whisking the mixture while cooking is the key and you don't have any lumps or cooked on piece and clumps from the bottom of pan! This is so easy and my favorite!! You have to try this!

Excellent and easy. I, too, used soy milk and it came out great. I disolved the corn starch in a couple of tablespoons of milk before adding it and that eliminated any problems with lumps. This would make a great custard topping for fruit, or any dessert.

This was good enough, but I did miss the richness  egg yolks provide. Should others decide to make this, looking over some of the reviews outlining a better, more traditional cooking method is advisable for guaranteed success.

I would definitely give this 5 stars for ease and taste, but I gave it 4 because I didn't follow the directions exactly.  I, like others, whisked all the dry ingredients together before adding the milk, and then turned on the heat.  I've never been successful with cornstarch and hot liquid, so I knew I should mix it with the cold milk.  

Otherwise, great basic, simple, tasty, comfort-food.  Will definitely make again and keep as my stand-by homemade vanilla pudding.

I have never made a pudding without eggs and was pleasantly surprised how delicious and easy this pudding is. I doubled the recipe and used half for chocolate elairs, and because I had so much left over,I used the other half for rice pudding. Both were DELICIOUS!!! The pudding has a custard like consistency making it perfect for rice pudding. To make rice pudding, add desired amount of cooked rice to pudding and top with cinnamon. For a full recipe of pudding, I would suggest using 2 cups of cooked rice. If the pudding does develop lumps, pour the hot cooked mixture through a sieve.  For the most flavor, use real vanilla extract. Unlike some puddings, this pudding keeps its consistency very nicely. I highly recommend giving the recipe a try!! It has become a permanent addition to my recipe collection.  Thanks for sharing!!

Yummy yummy yummy. Thank you for keeping me from boxed puddings. Some notes of caution to first-timers though: 1) Over-cooking the flour will cause your pudding to become stickier and stickier, until it's like glue. Don't do that. Turn off the heat when it's reached a consistency a little looser than what you like. It should thicken up as you continue to stir away from the heat. If you heat it until it reaches a consistency you like, the cooled mixture will be over-the-top gluey and not as fun to eat (although, I had fun with it). 2) Eating it cold? You'll need to add more sugar. Eating it hot? A little sugar will suffice. 3) Try spicing it up with cinnamon, caramom, lemon juice or even cocoa powder (for chocolate pudding)! Hope all your puddings turn out. Thank you for the recipe!

I modified this one quite a bit observing the suggestions above and decided to try them all out in one recipe! A little different than Rosemary's Original but she still deserves credit! Thanks Rosemary!!! 
So, using the original as a base, I mixed in all ingredients while still unheated EXCEPT vanilla- I added that last after taking it off the stove at the end.. Mixing everything together at the beginning prevented lumps 100%, and cooked all the flavors together gorgeously. I added 2 egg whites and used 2 tblspn. of butter. To avoid the annoying 'film' when pudding cools, I filled the base of my sink with ice water and stirred until slightly chilled. The most mouthwatering vanilla pudding you've ever tasted!

Also, I separated the pudding in half, put the other half on medium low heat, and stirred in 2+1/2 tsp. coco powder, whisked it in, and 1+1/2 tblspn. Magic Shell Chocolate Sauce. Sounds crazy but OMG! The Perfect Chocolate Pudding. Chilled it the same way. ENJOY!!!

This is SO good! AWESOME! I didnt change a thing- okay I fibbed. I didnt have real butter so I used butter flavoured crisco- so good! I had some warm and am cooling the rest. 
This definatly doesnt make 5 servings though- if you are a pudding lover like me. I ate the whole thing myself! It was that good!
I wish I would have found this recipe sooner, it would have gone down nicely a few weeks ago when I was suffering from mojor morning sickness!
BTW- I also tried a chocolate version 2tbs cocoa- double yummers! Tastes a little like an oreo!

Lumps? I didn't get any lumps and I couldn't even find my whisk to stir it with...did the lot with a simple wooden spoon! Followed the recipe exactly as written and got a great pudding as a result. Easy. Perhaps a vanilla bean instead of extract would impart better flavour but this was good enough. I sprinkled nutmeg on top and served it still warm poured over a sliced banana. It was also great poured warm over the lemon cupcakes I'd just made. Yum!

Delicious!!!  Took the suggestions of others and mixed my dry ingredients up first then added the cold milk, which was skim.  Added a dash of cinnamon and after waiting and waiting (and waiting :) ) for the pudding to set, found it far better than any store bought.  I'll make this often, only I will reduce the sugar by at least half the next time. Thanks!

I made this using coconut milk instead of regular milk and it was the best coconut pudding you will ever taste. The dry ingredients I added first with a bit of cinnamon and i stirred to break up all the lumps. Then turn the heat on and slowly add the milk while stirring. You can dress it up with a lil toasted coconut on top but it's also good without.

Yummy, easy pudding. The problems people are having with the lumps can be solved by simply putting all the dry ingredients through a mesh strainer. That will elimate the flour/sugar lumps and be better absorbed by the milk. Also used 2 tsps of all-purpose flour to substitute for the corn starch and turned out fine.

I began following the recipe using all the listed ingredients.  I also mixed the cornstarch with the cold milk first as others suggested.  Once the mixture thickened I decided the vanilla extract wasn't enough (probably would be better with a real vanilla bean), so I added a dash of almond extract.  This gave it a little extra flavor.  I was really craving some crème brulee, so after I cooled the mixture in dished , I sprinkled sugar on top and held them super close to the broiler until the sugar was bubbling.  They came out super goooooood!  Added some fresh mint from my garden and blueberries.  Easy to make, with ingredients you usually already have.  Definitely will make again!

Not bad at all.. I added and extra 1/2 tsp vanilla. Used 1/3 cup sugar and only 2 TBSP cornstarch. This was the first time making pudding and I had no idea how easy it was. I'm never buying the box again. I'll use this recipe from now on.

Great pudding! It did get clumpy after it thickened, but a good whisking solved the problem and yielded a nice, smooth consistency.

This pudding is great because you can make it in the microwave. I literally stirred everything (even butter and vanilla) together in one glass bowl and cooked it on high in the microwave for 5 minutes, stirring every 1-2 minutes. I didn't cut down on the sugar but wished I would've. If you can't have dairy, this recipe turns out great made with rice milk!

This recipe initially looked a little bland, but it was great!  Very easy and very creamy.  This made two servings.  I tried it just as the recipe was written (I use soy milk), and would only give that 4 stars.  Then I tried it with cinnamon and raisins plumped in Ameretto, and it was FANTASTIC.

Great pudding. It couldn't be easier or faster. I was really pleased with the texture and flavor and would describe the flavor to be nearly identical to Hagen Daaz vanilla ice cream. I made this exactly as the recipe states and had no problem at all with it setting up perfecly. Thanks Rosemary, for a great recipe that I'll make again.

A very yummy pudding.  As others have suggested, I mixed the dry ingredients in the pot, then added the milk and stirred until dissolved.  Then turned on the heat and stirred constantly until thickened.  You can also add 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder to the dry ingredients for a delicious chocolate pudding.

This was very easy to make; it is currently setting up in my refrigerator, however, I decreased sugar to 1/3 c. and it was still way too sweet.  I am using this in a trifle and fear it will add too much sweetness.  I would make it again with even less sugar next time.

I cannot believe that so many people thought this to be one of the best pudding recipes.  Usually I am not disappointed with so many rave reviews.  However, this pudding tasted like extremely  sweet, jelled milk.
I wanted to give this recipe no stars, but the computer made me give it at least one, in order to enter my review.

I used vanilla soy milk. We don't drink cow milk. The kids (6 and 2) LOVED IT!!  They cleaned the pot!  They would've ate it all if I hadn't already poured it over the banana's for after dinner desert. AWESOME 'VEGAN' vanilla pudding! (I used a butter 'substitute')

Great - I did as many suggested and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, I increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons and my grandchildren loved it.  Almost the same as my Homemade Chocolate Pudding recipe (just missing to cocoa).

A very good pudding recipe.  I would've given it 5 stars but the directions need to be amended to avoid lumps and in my opinion, it's too sweet once it cools down.  Cut down on the sugar and this would be a perfect pudding!  A good base for rice pudding as well.

DEEE-LICIOUS! This pudding was setting up before I got the butter into it.  If you follow the recipe EXACTLY, you won't have any trouble.  Waiting for the milk to get hot before adding the sugar mixture is critical.  Also, be sure to SLOWLY add in the sugar/cornstarch.  I didn't have any lumps.  All in all, this pudding is delicious, easy to make, and economical.  Don't be afraid to try it.

This turned out great, no problems with clumping.  We ate it warm (we needed breakfast lol) and it was wonderful, my kids are begging for more!  I also would say that it doesn't feed 5 people, (unless you eat it on something) we ate it plain and it fed 3 of us and smaller helpings at that.  I next time will probably cut the sugar down, but YUM YUM. . .just almost like my mom used to make.  (only her recipe had eggs in it)

I didn't have any trouble with lumps, as I made sure to add the cold milk to the dry ingredients and bring all up to temperature together. I thought it was very easy and quite tasty. I used a whole vanilla bean instead of the extract so I had these lovely little specks. :-). 

This is a great recipe for a quick pudding.

This pudding is FANTASTIC!!  I just made it with the changes that other people suggested...cold milk into dry ingredients and I put a little cinnamon in it.  It was so delicious my two year old was licking it off the counter top!  I will be making this simple but delicious recipe again!

i just made this pudding using all of the suggestions from other reviewers...
add 1 egg to the milk (I used skim) decrease sugar to 1/3 cup decrease cornstarch to 2 TBS, 1/4 tsp salt, 2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp cinnamin, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 TBS butter.
I wisked the egg and milk together. Then mixed all dry ingredients together. I then poured enough of the milk egg mix into the dry ingredients to make a runny paste and wisked well. I then poured the rest of the milk egg mix into the pan and followed the rest of the directions in the recipe. It tastes great...still in the refrigerator chilling now though! EASY as box mix!

Really good stuff. I followed some reviews suggesting mixing the dry ingredients 1st, then adding cold milk.Came out great. No lumps due to my constant stiring. Let it get close to a boiling point, then remove it. It set up beautifully after a couple of hours. I even tried this with skim milk and only used 3/4 cup sugar, still was really good. My son crumbled vanilla wafers and put a couple bananas with this and almost ate all this.

Very good vanilla pudding.  To avoid lumps, place cold milk in the saucepan, add dry ingredients and whisk until lump free and then cook as directed.  If you like, place some fresh fruit in your dessert bowl and pour on the pudding.  Thanks Rosemary.

Healthy Version: (See below for "lump" tips.) I substituted "Stevia in the Raw" for the sugar, light olive oil for the butter, and used 2% milk. I followed the directions exactly - no lumps. Tasted great, but a little sweet, even with the Stevia. I remedied this by adding a teaspoon of cocoa powder - perfect! A quick and tasty dessert with almost no fat or sugar, and no nasty aftertaste or chemicals. I can't wait to play around with other flavors, and I'm definitely going to try rice pudding! As for the lumps - I have 2 tips. Have the dry ingredients ready while heating the milk. Once the milk has scalded, remove from heat and gradually add the dry ingredients, whisking quickly. Return to heat and keep whisking until the pudding *almost* reaches a boil. Remove from heat, keep whisking for a few more minutes as the pudding cools a little. Immediately place a piece of plastic wrap on the surface of the pudding while cooling. This will prevent a skin from forming, and creating lumps when ready to serve. Enjoy!

I made this while watching a season five episode of DS9. I couldn't wait for it to finish solidifying in mon fridge. It tastes heavenly and like my ex-wife, when it is warm and gooey still. Try it! Next time I am going to inject it into some chocolate cake!!

As another reviewer suggested, I combined all the dry ingredients and added the cold milk ~ No lumps!  I also reduced the sugar by 1/3, and it was still plenty sweet.

Just made it and couldn't wait for it to cool. I agree with others, put the cornstarch in with the sugar and add cold milk. Whisk constantly because it goes from too thin to scorched quickly! I also recommend cutting back on the sugar. I thought it was way too sweet, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Next time I intend to try it with brown sugar instead to see if it will taste like caramel!

This is good, I made a couple of changes.  I only used 1/4 cup of sugar, added 1/2 tbsp more of vanilla.
Topped it off with a little cinnamon and it is a nice change from the homemade chocolate pudding I make.

This recipe was so easy and only calls for a few basic items.   I started with a small purchased pound cake, sliced, then cubed it into a large bowl. To this I added some fresh pineapple tidbits and a handful of coconut. I used the juice from the pineapple (approx. 1/3 cup) and drizzled over contents in bowl. When the pudding was prepared, I let it cool for about 10 minutes. In the meantime, I gently mixed above ingreds. in the bowl. Finally when pudding was lukewarm, I poured it over the cake/pineapple mixture and refrigerated for a half hour. Served it with whipped cream. It was so easy to prepare and versatile. Its a great way to use up berries or fruit and inexpensive but delicious. Better than a trip to the donut shop!

I give it a solid 4 stars. the starch clumped a little bit and took a really long time to thicken. I had to keep scraping the bottom of the saucepan. It was rich too. Really good as a simple desert.

I made this with some changes that were suggested by others and from my own experience (you never mix cornstarch into a hot liquid):  Whisking cold milk into dry ingredients, doubling the vanilla, and cutting down on the sugar.  I thought the taste was very good, however, I prefer the extra richness that adding egg yolks bring so I'll probably stick with my other recipe.

Looking for a healthy homemade pudding I could give to my 16 month old son.  Used full fat milk, half the sugar and double the vanilla, as others have suggested.  Mixed the dry ingredients first and then added the milk.  Wow, what a fantastic pudding!

This is a great recipe! I've made it twice now, once making it as the recipe was written, and the second time I tried adding a bit of nutmeg and chopped peaches. It's fantastic both ways, although I find I end up adding an additional 1/2 to 1 tbsp of cornstarch to get it to the consistency that I like, and I reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup. As suggested by another reviewer, I just mix it all in a glass casserole dish and then cook it uncovered in the microwave, stirring every 90 seconds, for 5-6 minutes total. Thank you so much for posting this recipe, even my 3-year-old son (who hates anything soft or mushy) loves this pudding! :)

Yum! I thought this was great - I followed the suggested "no lump" method though rather than what is stated. I whisked together the dry ingredients, then added the milk, then heated until thick. So good! And very easy. I added raspberries as well and mixed them in.

Better than boxed, almost as quick, and certainly cheaper than those little boxes of store-bought. I doubled the recipe, but added two yolks to enrich it a little (adds a bit of color, as well.) I also added about 1/8th teaspoon cinnamon. If you substitute or omit the butter and don't add seasoning or enrich it SOMEHOW, it is rather 'thin' in FLAVOR, not texture--sort of like the 'instant' puddings are (to my taste buds, anyway.)  Has a smoother texture than instant boxed puddings, however. Good recipe to use when eggs aren't available or a 'lighter' filling is desired rather than a full-flavored 'pudding'. I let it come to a full boil (JUST) rather than as directed and added the yolks from the beginning with the milk, then added the mixed dry ingredients to the milk mixture. Vanilla was added after removing the completely-cooked mixture from heat.

I did as others suggested and added all dry ingred. to the pot before adding the milk.  I had no problems with lumps.
I used 1/3c vanilla sugar, not 1/2c as the recipe called for.  It really would have been too sweet.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I used fat free milk and the pudding tasted quite rich. 
I poured all of the pudding into one large bowl - which was a big mistake.  Take the time to make single servings.  You'll enjoy it much more.

This was the perfect fix for my midnight sweet tooth =) I Followed the directions exactly, Except since so many other reviews noted that it might be a little bland I added just a dash of cinnamon and a very small dash of allspice to my dry ingredients before mixing in.  It gave it a homey flavor that was just right!  I had no trouble with the lumpiness mentioned by others....just don't allow the milk to get too hot and Slowly mix in the dry ingredients while Constantly stirring...and like any other stovetop pudding, Don't stop stirring until it's done! =) wonderful, thank you for the recipe

This Pudding is awesome! 
I would just make a few changes. Here is how I make it. 

1.	In medium saucepan, wisk together milk & cornstarch till the cornstarch is completely mixed in (NO lumps!). Simmer till thick, stirring occasionally. Add sugar, salt & vanilla. Simmer just a little more, but don’t boil it. Stir in the butter. Pour into serving dishes. 
    Its great either warm or cold, and even better with whipped topping!

This pudding tastes perfect.  I found that it was a little tricky to get it to thicken without scalding the milk, but once it chilled, it firmed up nicely.

This recipe is amazing.  I took the advice of someone else and put my dry ingredients into the pot first and slowly wisked in the milk then kicked up the heat.  Turned out smooth and delicious. I added and extra half a teaspoon of vanilla. Great recipe!  You could even cut back on the sugar too and it would still  be good

I just made this and it turned out great! I tweaked it by adding all the dry ingredients first in the pan, added the vanilla to the milk, and then combined before heating. I wanted a vanilla pudding for banana pudding and so far, so good!

Hey, I enjoyed making this recipe for my birthday yesterday! Everybody loved it! I was a bit worried about it not setting too well. Don't know if I was comparing it to custard consistency, but never the less it was a hit, I added a lil whipped cream and a cherry. Everyone enjoyed it! I took the advice of the previous comments and I added all dry ingredients to the wet! Had a few lumps but none the less it was a hit!

I juSt made this pudding for the second time because the first time I made it, it was sheer perfection. Yes, it is a basic recipe, but what's wrong with simple when the taste is divine?
I used 1% lactose free milk also, which did not deter it from being creamy and smooth. The dry ingredients were added in a small bowl, stirred thoroughly, and slipped into the milk a little at a time, just like it called for. What I did do that might be different is I used a whisk to stir the milk constantly, until it could coat a spoon. This didn't take long at all.
In about an hour my family will be able to enjoy a good and simple homemade dessert. Yum!

I agree it's basic but good... I also agree with adding all ingredients  to the cold milk whisking then heating, I modified this recipe and added 2 egg yolks and some cinnamon.. I put all of the ingredients in the sauce pan minus the butter and whisked then blended the mixture in my nutribullet, I then added the blended mixture to the saucepan and turned on to medium heat and added the butter, I whisked vigorously until it thickened and then put the pudding in a glass bowl, sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon sugar  on the top and chilled. I served it with whipped topping and homemade cinnamon sugar chips.

Absolutely no problem with lumping or getting it to thicken. I mixed the milk, sugar, corn starch and salt in a bowl first to get rid of lumps, then put it in a pot on the stove and cooked and stirred constantly for about 7 minutes on medium heat. Then add the vanilla and margarine at the end like specified once pudding is thickened enough to coat a spoon. I made my pudding into pudding pops this morning though :D

So much awesome. I solved the "lumpy" problem by making a bechamel first, then dumping in the sugar, then using an electric mixer in the pot while I sprinkled in the rest of the flour for roughly a decade. But it turned out amazing! Also? Skipping the vanilla and adding 1/4 cup of cocoa powder magically turns it into awesome chocolate pudding! Can't wait to try strawberry jam in it. :-D

I'm only giving 4 stars instead of 5 due to the appearance.  It looked like very white, thick milk.  I thought the dark vanilla and the yellow of the butter would of tinted it at least. We didn't garnish it with anything and kids had it gone before it could fully cool.  They loved the taste but not the look.  Next time I may add a drop of food coloring for the kids  VERY SIMPLE VERY GOOD.  It's a keeper.  The only change that I made was in how I combined the dry and wet ingredients to prevent lumps before heating.  This took longer but was well worth it.

I kept the measurements the same only added the dry ingredients into the pot and then whisked in the milk. This is delicious, my whole family loved it and I will make it again! Thank you for the recipe.

i know Rosemary says there's no substitute for the butter, but when you want pudding and have only margerine, it works.  great recipe, as the reviewers have said, its best to dissolve the cornstarch in cold milk to avoid lumps.  i've also subbed vanilla bean paste for extract and made it addictive.  someone said they double the vanilla and that's the next way i'm gonna try it!

This recipe is very good. Pudding is sweet and well balanced. I made a few changes just to suit my family's taste because we love strong vanilla flavor. I used the seeds of one Madagascar vanilla bean, doubled the amount of vanilla extract, and used 2 Tbsp butter. Delicious! Also, as others have said, I add dry ingredients to pan first and add the cold milk to prevent clumping. Good recipe with or without the changes.

This is a GREAT recipe! My first time making pudding and it almost went off without a hitch. I would suggest though, adding all ingredients to cold milk to prevent bubbles. It works better for me.

Excellent! I was going to use pudding/pie mix but was out so tried this...SOOOO much better. Never buying the mix again. Wish I would have tried this years ago. I made it according to the original directions and it turned out perfectly.  I added fresh fruit on top and everyone loved it! yum!

Easy and delicious.  I followed the directions exactly.  The trick is the whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and salt to an even consistency.  *Then* whisk the dry mixture into the bubbling milk.

My grandson Anthony and I were preparing to make Grandpa a bowl of banana pudding, and found we didn't have our usual box of vanilla pudding in the cabinet.  So we got brave and decided to make the pudding from scratch and used this recipe.  Anthony and I agree that this pudding should get 5 stars, it is easy and tasty!  We used a wire wisk for stirring and got no lumps!  (Grandpa says he would give it 6 stars if he could!)

It's an okay recipe. Nothing beats old fashioned eggs and heavy cream, but if you are looking for a quick and easy way out... this is the recipe for you.   This recipe lacks richness. There is not much fat, so I used heavy cream. Btw, if you add choc powder to the dry ingredients, or chocolate chips at the end with the van, you end up with a very thick hot chocolate, or you can call it chocolate pudding.

I did not care for this.  I was looking for a simple pudding recipe without eggs, and this is simple, sweet and without eggs, but I found the taste to be super sweet and a 'flat' flavor.  I'm giving it 2 stars because my 7 year old liked it, of course, because of the sugar, but I don't think this was tasty for adult tastebuds at all.

When I put this pudding in the refrigerator to cool, it solidified, the way that Jello does. Will make again, but will just let it cool slightly on the counter instead.

Great recipe!  I've looked forever for a pudding recipe that is light (a.k.a. no eggs), and this is the best I've found.  I sometimes blend up a banana and put that in for a banana pudding.  I have also tried chocolate and other fruits.  This is a fantastic and diverse recipe to keep in the front of the cookbook!

This works out great for banana pudding, although it's super sweet.  It tastes like the milk at the bottom of a bowl of frosted flakes.  :)  The first time I made it, it was way too thick to soak the vanilla wafers the way I had hoped it would.  The second time, it was way too runny and all the wafers floated up to the top and I couldn't get them to stay down.  So, it's better to cook it the right length so it thickens up.  But next time we'll use less sugar.

My husband was craving something sweet but didn't want chocolate. This was perfect! Ingredients that  you always have on hand and super fast to make! I as mentioned before put all dry ingredients in the pan, whisked together and added the milk 1/2 cup at a time until blended ... voila no lumps! I added the butter and vanilla at the end and this was devine! Thanks for a great recipe!

Not sure why so many people had trouble with this recipe. I followed Rosemary's directions exactly and got puding, just like I thought I would. Not opaque (white because there's no added coloring), not lumpy, not runny. Just pudding. I used it to make peanut butter cream pie and did add a little yellow food coloring so that the pie didn't look too one-colored but it was totally perfect as it came out of the fridge after cooling. Only 4 stars because it was a bit sweet for me, but my son loved it as it is written.

I was happy to find a pudding recipe which didn't require eggs. I used reconstituted dry non fat milk, almond flavoring instead of vanilla and 1/3 cup of sugar. I mixed the dry ingredients first and then added cold milk to the pan to prevent lumps. I think this is a very good basic recipe which can easily be adapted with different flavorings. It would be richer using whole or even 2% milk but I used what I had on hand.

A great basic recipe that is just about fool-proof, and the variations are endless.  I added 1 tsp. lemon extract and 1/2 tsp. vanilla to mine, and the taste is subtle and delicious. Next, I will try 1 tsp. vanilla and add in 2 squares of grated chocolate- I bet it will be great too. Also, I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup liquid coffee creamer- I was low on milk. So if you don't have a lot of milk, substitutions don't hurt the recipe.  The reasons I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because 1.) you really should mix everything together, make sure it's smooth, and THEN put it on the heat 2.) if you want a thick pudding (I did), you should let it come to a boil, or else the cornstarch can't do its job.

I picked this recipe because it didn't call for eggs. It has the best "homemade" flavor!  I will never buy a box of instant pudding again!  Before putting it in the fridge to chill, I covered the pudding surface with cling wrap.  Doing this keeps the pudding creamy and prevents the "skin"-like top layer that sometimes develops.

This had a very nice vanilla flavor, and was a big hit at Pudding Fridays in the office.

This is one recipe that has kept me coming back to allrecipes for the past couple of years...it was the first recipe I tried and my whole crew loved it.  Make sure you whisk it while heating it to the right consistency...don't change a thing cause it's delicious!

Didn't have a problem with lumps at all; sugar needs to be cut down a bit though. Added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Delicious.

Very easy and good...... I folded in some cooked white rice to make rice pudding. It took maybe 10 minutes to make.

Wow! I followed the  suggestion  of adding all of the dry ingredients first, and it turned out great! I also only added 1/4 cup of sugar, and the sweetness was perfect! The only thing I would do differently next time I make this would be to add another teaspoon of vanilla, and some cinnamon and nutmeg. I will definitely make this again!

This was my first time making home made pudding and I found this recipe to be very easy to make and also delicious. I did not have regular milk here at home so I used a 12oz can of evaporated milk and added 4 oz of water to make 2 cups of milk. I whisked the dry ingredients together in a bowl before I added them to the hot milk to break up any lumps in the cornstarch and then added them as instructed in the recipe. It turned out very smooth and just perfect! Will definitely make this again!

This is now our family's favorite vanilla pudding recipe.  To prevent lumps:  mix dry ingredients first.  Then pour cold milk and whisk until thoroughly mixed BEFORE turning on the heat.  We decreased sugar.  The pudding was so smooth, creamy, and yummy!

Our favorite way of serving vanilla pudding is warm from the stove with sliced bananas and a bit of half & half.

This pudding is awesome! I did follow the reviewers sugestions of mixing dry then adding cold milk, and finally heating.  I doubled the recipe and added a teaspoon of cinnamon.

This pudding was good, but not what I was looking for.  I thought it tasted a lot like hot milk with white chocolate.  My husband did not like it at all.  I cut the sugar back to 1/3 C like people suggested.  I was very glad I did.  I love sweet stuff and even with 1/3 C instead of 1/2 C it was plenty sweet.  I also took others' advise and mixed all of the dry ingredients together in the pan first, then poured in the cold milk.  Even though it was not what I was looking for it was ok.

Great recipe for a simple vanilla pudding, I added 1/2 t nutmeg, then as it cooled, some sliced banana, and served it over a square of puffed pastry with whipped cream to top. Personal banana cream pies, fantastic!

I just made this today, and it turned out GREAT!!  I made sure to whisk in the dry ingredients a little at a time, and the only thing I did differently was add an egg after I added the dry ingredients, and I only used 1/3 c of sugar.  This would have been perfect even without the butter and vanilla, I will probably omit them both the next time around.  I made banana pudding with this and some ripe bananas, yummy!

Made this recipe twice this week, the first time just as the recipe says :( and nobody at home liked this!! the second time I added 6 egg yolks, substituted a vanilla bean for the vanilla extract and cut down on sugar a little bit.... yummy!!!!!! egg yolks help to thicken your pudding and give a great flavor/texture!!

Very quick and easy pudding.  I followed the recommendations and mixed all dry ingredients together, then added milk, then put on heat.  NO LUMPS.  As some reviewers mentioned, it is a bit on the sweet side.  I found it to be a little too thick after refrigeration.  Next time I'll try reducing the cornstarch to 2 Tbs to see if that helps.  A very good basic pudding that was tasty on its own and would be great as a base for others.

After reading reviews I made two adjustments to this recipe. I mixed the sugar, salt and cornstarch in the saucepan and then whisked cold milk in bit by bit then heated slowly stirring all the time. It worked no lumps. Also I reduced the amount of sugar to a third of a cup and it was still quite sweet so you could reduce it a bit more. Used this in fruity tart from this site and the fruit helped to reduce the sweetness a bit. Good basic recipe with these changes. Thanks.

This recipe isn't bad. Tasteful. I read reviews saying it was lumpy for them, but it definitely wasn't for me, perhaps it was my technique. I heated the milk, put the dry ingredients in a liquid measuring cup; once the milk was heated through I added a small portion of it into the dry ingredients to dissolve them completely before adding it back into the saucepan. Wisk that for a bit, add the butter/vanilla and voila..pudding. I'm actually going to be using this for a cake filling, so it's in the fridge now to thicken up even more and cool down. :o) This is a pretty decent 'base' pudding mix, I'd think you could add any flavor, banana, chocolate, mint, etc...even tapioca. :o)

I think this was ok for vanilla pudding.  I would have to say it would be better as a custard tho.  I added the cornstarch with the cold milk and stirred it till it dissolved (about 1 minute) then added in the sugar and salt.  I cooked till thick and added in the vanilla and margarine.  I would probably add 1/4 cup more milk and an egg the next time and make a custard.  It was really thick.  There was something missing and I think it was the egg.  I would use this recipe when making cream puffs with a chocolate drizzle over top.  It is not bad.  Just different.  Thanks for the recipe cause without it I would have not come up with a custard.

Yummy! Some have said it didn't thicken up after chilling...2 things...make sure you use the correct amount of corn starch as this is what thickens it and make sure you cook it long enough. Although it says not to let it boil, it's important that it cook long enough. I used 2% milk. I also added a touch of almond.

OK...I have got to try this again because I can't believe it turned out so weird. It wouldn't gel...I had to dump it back in the pan and reheat it when I realized it wouldn't stiffen up. And it still wouldn't. I ended up adding more cornstarch to thicken it and an egg yolk but no cigar (just got lumps from the cornstarch). I have never had problems with a pudding recipe from this site before. I hope it turns out better next time...and next time won't be the day I have company over!

It was a bit bland and runny for me.  I was very careful with this recipe because of all the reviews saying it turns out lumpy.  So instead of lumpy, it seemed a little runny, so I refrigerated it.  Well, after refrigeration it turned out clumpy.  This pudding was an addition to a slice of apple pie.  It needed something....just wasn't smooth or tasty enough.  Next time, I'll use ice cream instead.

Excellent flavor, though I do cut the sugar back a bit.  Regarding the cornstarch, following the instructions almost guarantees you'll have lumps. Reserve 1/4 c of the milk to mix with the cornstarch, sugar and salt; stir in some of the hot pudding to the cornstarch mixture, then add it all into the hot milk. Or add all the dry ingredients to the pot, then slowly whisk in the liquid.

Delicious! I added about 1/2 cup tapioca. If you burn the bottom of the pan, don't worry- simply make sure that you only stir the top. I did this with my second batch and it tastes fine!

I made this like I do my chocolate pudding. I added all dry ingredients, then added the milk. Then cooked till boiling, stirring constantly. Then I let it boil for 1 minute,boiling constantly,  removed from heat, added milk and vanilla, and turned out great. Thanks for this recipe, was ni e it doesn't use eggs.

The main reason some are getting lumps is you are adding the cornstarch mixture when the milk is too hot. Stir in mixture when it is warm not hot. This is also true when making pan gravy.

Usually when I make pudding I place all of the dry ingredients in the pan and then add a small amount of cold water to dissolve everything.  Then I put the milk in a glass measuring cup and microwave on high for 2 minutes.  Add the warmed up milk to the dissolved dry ingredients and heat and stir till thickened.  This reduces the amount of time you have to spend standing and stirring at the stove till thickened.  I liked this recipe but it was a little bit too sweet for me so next time I will reduce the sugar a bit.

The first time I made this pudding I thought it came out very good.  I struggled a little with needing to whisk out lumps, but not many.  It set up well and I love that it is much more healthy and wholesome than box mix puddings.  
I repeated the recipe tonight and noticed it said to cook only enough to coat the spoon, not to boil the milk.  I had not noticed this instruction the first time I made it and probably overcooked it.  That said, after putting the bowl of pudding in the fridge to chill I realized it had not set enough and would remain liquid.  Put it back in the pot and cooked it, not to a boil but to the point where the pudding was thickened and I was having to fight lumps.  This time I can see it will be fine again.  Perhaps my training of what constitutes a liquid that will coat a spoon differs from the author of the recipe.
The pudding is sweet, but not overly so.  I added a good dash of nutmeg while I was cooking & stirring, gives it a little more depth of flavor.

This is a great basic pudding recipe, and it can be used to make any other pudding you want!  I have made it with almond milk and have not had a problem with getting the right consistency.  
-Add all the dry ingredients, stir in cold liquid, and then heat.  Voila, no lumps.  If you do get lumps, push it through sifter.
-Add some ginger (1/4 tsp)  and cinnamon (1/2tsp) powder for a spicy vanilla pudding.
-Add some cocoa powder for chocolate.

Seriously the possibilities are endless.  This is a great recipe to have on hand.

The recipe as written does produce a fantastic pudding with lumps.  The "reverse" method suggested by other reviewers will make this a 5-star recipe.  It's sad to think that the only pudding I can compare this to is in a Jello box.  It took 50 years but I've finally found something better.  I'm noticing that this pudding recipe was added over 10 years ago.  It's survived a decade of scrutiny.  It's a good one!

I mixed the cornstarch in w/ a 1/2 cup of 'milk' that I reserved. I used 1 1/2 cups of half and half, with 1/4 cup water b/c I had no milk. I couldn't find my vanilla beans, until RIGHT after I potted up my dessert. 

I love this recipe, and this site. It never occurred to me that I could make pudding from scratch. I was a bit grossed out when I read the ingredients on the instant pudding mix my husband brought home tonight, so I ran here to see how I could avoid that mess. 
Thanks Rosemary!

I made this recipe with the ingredients exactly as written using the microwave method that is used for "Hasty Chocolate Pudding" It turned out perfect. I used a large microwave safe bowl added the dry ingredients, whisked in the milk until completely blended, then microwaved for 3 minutes. I then whisked it again and microwaved at 1 min intervals until it reached the perfect consistency which in my microwave took an additional 2 and a half minutes for a total time of 5 and a half minutes. I then stirred in the butter and vanilla. I topped mine with a little cinnamon and nutmeg and it was fantastic.

My husband asked for dirt cake for his birthday so I had to find a pudding recipe. I have a custard recipe but it is a bit too rich for dirt cake so I found this, the first recipe I came to. I skimmed the ingredients, simple enough. Checked out the reviews, and became a bit scared to try this. I decided I would try it like it says, make no changes and give it an honest shot. Guess what....it turned out perfect! I heated the milk, waited until it was warm and slowly added the dry ingredients. I stirred the mixture the entire time, about 6 minutes give or take a few, but constantly stirred. I changed direction in stirring every few turns but stirred that pudding. It is delicious, not too sweet, not too plain. No lumps. I say don't be intimidated by the recipe or reviews. Follow the directions and its great. Just make sure you stir! Cannot wait to have the dirt cake tomorrow.

My 5th grader made this for us.  All the kids here and the adult (me) agree that it's between a 4 and 5 star recipe.  The flavor is lovely (we did add a splash more vanilla as we do with most things).  But this is definitely a cooked pudding recipe and so the texture was much different then they were use to.  :-)

Except for mixing the cornstarch mixture into cold milk, I made the recipe exactly.  It was wonderful.  The person who said that this pudding tasted like custard was right.  Don't know how that can happen with no eggs!  The texture is smooth and light maybe because I stirred it with a whisk while cooking.  The second time I made it I added 2 Tbs of cocoa powder, but it would be great with any flavoring extract.

This was the first time that I've ever made homemade pudding.  I doubled the recipe, but only added 3/4 C sugar instead of a whole cup.  The pudding was still very sweet.  This was easy to make and turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

I love the taste and texture of this pudding!  I doubled the vanilla (I use the expensive kind) and it gave a more intense vanilla flavor.  Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar which should bring out the vanilla flavor.

Creamy, thick and pretty yummy as a basic pudding recipe. No strong flavor, though. But I will keep it as a good go-to recipe. Took the advice of others and did dry ingredients first while mixing in wet slowly before turning on the heat. Perfectly smooth. After we added a little cinnamon and nutmeg which made it delicious. Might be fun to try adding other flavors.

Made this for dessert tonight. Great recipe! My husband and kids really enjoyed it. Didn't change a thing. I had all of the ingredients on hand so I thought, why not? This recipe took only minutes to make and was cheap!  I had no problems with lumps, but agree that it was a tad too sweet. Next time, I might subtract a couple of tablespoons of the sugar...or maybe not. I will never buy store-bought pudding after having this. Will definitely make this again! Thanks:)

I ran out of Cornstarch so I used 6 Tablespoons of flour instead, turned out perfect! 
Next time I will be adding 8oz Cream Cheese to this to make cheesecake pudding, so I can make Cheesecake Popsicles for the kids, by layering the pudding, crushed graham crackers & fresh fruit in Popsicle molds and freezing, Yum :)

This recipe was okay. It has more sugar than I care for - I think half the amount would have suited me better. I also had to add extra thickener. I probably won't make it again. I prefer the richness that eggs add and will use a recipe with eggs in the future. This recipe was easy, however.

Well, I followed the directions of others first, and then it turned out perfect!! Sadly, I didn't heed the warning of it being too sweet...But I still like the pudding! Next time, I need to really taste it when it's cooking to adjust the sugar amount.

We really loved this recipe with a few tweaks. To avoid lumps, I mixed dry ingredients with cold milk before putting over heat. I took another user's advice and use 1/3 cup of sugar, but it was still too sweet so next time I will only use 1/4 cup. We got impatient and ate it warm, but it was so delicious we might eat it warm every time!

While I'm not a dessert person, my husband and kids are.  I made this following the other reviewers suggestions of adding the milk after the dry ingredients and only one ingredient change (less sugar), and my daughter said this is "crazy yummy!"  Really quick and easy recipe.

this hit the spot. I made it with fat free milk. I added the dry mix while the milk was warm (no bubbles yet) and whisked the pudding while it cooked. no lumps, tasted nice warm even. I sliced some bananas to the pudding while it cooled. I lowered the sugar slightly, just personal preference.

This recipe is pretty good, but to make it easier to have no lumps, you should use a little bit of milk to the corn starch first and mix it, When it's a liquid, drop it into the hot milk and it'll make mixing it a whole lot easier.

I love this!  I've made it twice, mixed everything in a bowl then microwaved it, stopping to stir a couple of times.  First time I made vanilla, the second I added unsweetened cocoa for chocolate - YUM!!  Now I have to figure out butterscotch... : )

My boyfriend was in the mood for vanilla pudding but we didn't have any in the cupboard, so after he left for work I decided to surprise him with a homemade one when he got home.  What a hit!  This recipe is creamy and the flavor is great.  I did as most all other reviewers said, mixing the dry ingredients in your pan first and then adding the milk slowly.  No lumps at all. Thanks for the recipe!

Not sure why this came out too salty for me.  It set up right but was definitely surprised when I tasted it and it was salty.  Not sure if I'd make this again.

The pudding gave me trouble. I ended up having to cook the pudding, which wasn't apparent in the directions for the recipe. It never set cold, so I heated it up for a few minutes, let it thicken, and then left it in the fridge to set. 

Topped some strawberries on these bad boys and they were fantastic!

On a low sodium diet so eliminated the salt completely.  Cooked the whole thing in the microwave and it was smooth and creamy.  Takes about 2 minutes to heat up the milk before adding the dry ingredients.  How long after that to get the consistency depends on micro strength.  Mine took about 5-6 minutes with timeouts for stirring and to check for thickness.  Then added the butter and vanilla.  Turned out great and without any salt.

This was my first attempt at making homemade pudding. This recipe was easy and good. I doubled the recipe for my family of 6. Next time I will cut the sugar in half as it is really sweet.

My kids ask me to make this pudding all the time! It is pretty sweet so sometimes I cut back on the sugar a bit...also for variations I sometimes add a small amount of almond extract, or lemon extract...yummy!

Yeah, ditto to all the reviews saying to mix the dry with the wet in the pot first. I also added an egg yolk and extra milk since it was too sweet for me. The kids I babysit liked it though.

Made this using the exact measurements, but used brown sugar for a more caramel pudding.  Also followed another reviewers suggestion of mixing the dry ingredients in the cold pot, adding cold milk and mixing well, then heating.  No lumps.  Well loved by my daughter, my mom, and me.  :)

Thank you Rosemary for this recipe. I made this tonight for the first time and I am very pleased with the results.  The only addition I did was added and extra teaspoon of vanilla to kick-up the vanilla flavor. It was excellent. Will definitely make again.

Made this with only about 2 tbsps of sugar and threw 3 chai tea bags in while the milk was boiling. Make a slurry with cold milk and cornstarch to avoid lumps.

I'm sure this pudding is normally delicious... but it definitely doesn't take well to using Rice Milk instead of regular milk and Xylitol instead of sugar... So any allergy people out there that are like me, don't bother substituting!

Great recipe, very simple. I have never ever made pudding before not even from a box. I followed the recipe as described but with some minor changes. I used 1C of milk and 1C of heavy whipping cream and I dissolved the sugar and cornstarch as much as I could in a cup of cold milk first. Will definitely make again. Thank  you

This is great! My grandson is allergic to eggs and has not been able to enjoy pies and banana pudding with us. This solves that issue. It taste really good and compares to my regular egg pudding and pie custards.

Five stars!! The only things I do different are, instead 1/4 cup cane sugar, and arrowroot starch instead of cornstarch. I am allergic to corn. It works great! You can also add more protein by adding some vanilla protein powder, or gradually mix in 2 eggs. If you add the eggs you must wait until slightly thickened, and after you continuously stir it in, you must keep doing this for 2 full minutes. GREAT recipe

I found that if you put the dry ingredients into the milk at the beginning, the pudding will be lump free.  I tried it as written first, and could not get the lumps completely out.  I have been looking for a good pudding recipe without eggs and this is it!

THIS was amazing! I never even though about a homemade pudding and then came across this recipe! It is so nice! You can use many extracts to flavor it, too. I'm thinking butterscotch is next. How? I hope they have an extract! Thanks so much for a fun family recipe.

I would have given this 5 stars, but the directions are all wrong!  You must dissolve cornstarch in a COLD liquid (same goes if you were thickening a gravy, you would dissolve it in cold water, then add it to your hot sauce - then voila!  it's thick!).  Next time I'll use a little less sugar and use real vanilla beans, but this was fantastic as is!  I'll never use store bought again!

This pudding came out smooth with a nice consistency. I did mix all dry ingredients first in the pan, then whisked in the cold milk thoroughly before cooking. This is the best way to add cornstarch without lumps.  I liked this pudding but didn't absolutely love it.

Oh wow. I may never eat anything but pudding again. This is so good! The only change I made was using 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of whole milk. I had some cream I needed to use up. So it's really fattening, but man does it taste good!

The flavor of this pudding was excellent.  However, my pudding, once chilled, had the consistency of flubber (like my children make in Science class.)  Perhaps we over cooked it.  Caution - stop cooking immediately after it thickens.  We will try again.

This recipe is tops!  Everyone loves it!  Very easy and quick to make.  I've also used it as filling for the Cream Puff Shells by Ginger P.  and I've  made it with canned milk for half the milk called for. I've made it with skim milk, too.  I did cut back a bit on the sugar and doubled the vanilla.  It's good with all kinds of milk or milk combinations that I've tried so far.

Yummy!  For those of you having difficulty with lumps, you need to pre-mix your cornstarch ( I believe it's called making a slurry).  Take equal parts of cornstarch and milk and make a paste.  It's kind of a wierd consistancy but anyway, once you have that smooth, pour it into the rest of the milk.  I doubled the vanilla and will probably try halving the sugar next time.  It's good the way it is but if you can cut some sugar out without loosing flavor, why not.

as the recipe stands, it's way too sweet. I used half the sugar called for. Made it with half skim and half 'half& half', added egg beaters, the butter and vanilla and it was really great. There's no reason this  should be lumpy. It is always perfectly smooth, takes little time to make and there's No reason to resort to less-than-suitable instant pudding mixes.

good basic recipe. however, i used 4 cups organic milk, 1/2 cup organic brown sugar & only 4 tbs of cornstarch. i didnt get any lumps. I first cooked the milk & in then in a sep. bowl added all the other ingredients w/ a bit of cold milk to dissolved the cornstarch & blend everything. then added it slowly to the milk. Sometimes for my son, i add a mashed banana in it w/ a pinch of cinnamon.

I was looking for something to serve with fresh strawberries that are slightly under ripe. This was fast, easy and I had all the ingredients. I should have read the reviews first as I did get a few small lumps.  I will combine the dry ingredients with the milk before cooking next time.  The sweetness will benefit these strawberries but for future, I will use only a 1/4 - 1/3 cup of sugar.

Making pudding is similar to making a gravy with cornstarch.  Cornstarch needs to be mixed with cold water first and then heated.  If you add it to boiling water without mixing it with some cold water first you will get lumps. So ladies and gentlemen try it that way if you are having problems with lumps.

This was easy and delicious. I had no problems with lumping - I stirred continuously with a fork and added the sugar/cornstarch mixture very gradually. My kids and I ate this warm for breakfast, I cut up a banana into theirs. We all loved it!

I use this pudding as a base for rice pudding.  It is fabulous with about 1 cup of cooked rice, which is added after the pudding is completely made, allowing it to sit together for a few minutes on the stove, then in the fridge.  To flavor it I usually put in 1 cup of chocolate chips, or whatever other flavorings I've got around (raspberries/strawberries/cinnamon) added during cooking make a wonderful flavor pudding.  This is my version of Pudding on the Rice, a popular dessert chain.

I took other's advice and put all dry ingredients in the pot then whisked in the milk slowly. Once incorporated I then turned on the heat. Kept stirring until thickened then added the vanilla and butter. Boyfriend loves this.

Lumpy, but still good. Will use what I should have done, mix in cornstarch with milk and just cook till thick, quick and easy, since it took me like, 5 minute to make. Will make again if I need a break from Chocolate Pudding

Wonderful. Tasted great. We used Trader Joes Tahitian Vanilla extract which has little bits of vanilla pod in it. As other reviewers suggested, mixed dry ingredients first, then added milk, blended, brought to a boil and cooked till thick. Then added vanilla and butter :-) (My husband loved it!)

I followed the suggestions and added the milk cold, and since I was out of vanilla I used almond extract.  I used 1/3 cup of sugar.   I added cinnamon and  grated some nutmeg on the top - delicious!  I'll definitely make this again and double the recipe.

Trust me, never make this with skim milk!  It had an unpleasant color to it, sort of an opaque color.  Also, hold back 1/2 cup of the milk and add the cornstarch to it to make a slurry.  Once the milk begins boiling, add the slurry and quickly whisk it.

Vanilla pudding is one of my favorite desserts...  I  dissolved the dry ingredients with cold milk and then proceeded with the cooking because that's the way I've always made pudding.  The first time I made this I used whole milk and was satisfied with the taste and texture even tho it didn't have egg.  I made it again using 1% milk and didn't care for the rubbery-texture I ended up with.  This time I made it with 2% milk and cut the cornstarch to 2 1/2 Tblsps... I absolutely love the flavor of this pudding and it's so easy to make  (It's good warm poured over sliced bananas!)

I never comment on the recipes but I loved this one.  I love to cook and prepare WOW dishes for my family.  When my husband saw that I made homemade pudding he was impressed and I was delighted because it took no effort and was easy clean up.  I will double the recipe next time because I wanted more!

Excellent recipe! Neither too sweet nor lumpy if you do follow the other reviewers' instructions : a) Cut down on the sugar(1/3 cup. b) Mix dry ingredients first, then add milk. Other than that, I added 1 tblsp. vanilla extract instead of 1 teasp. and omitted the butter. The result was fantastic. Very yummy warm or cold.

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a quick vanilla pudding base for my banana pudding opposed to the custard recipe I normally use.  TERRIBLE, it was too sweet, too lumpy and too runny.  Not good at all, needs flour instead of cornstarch, eggs yolks and less sugar. I've learned my lesson from taking shortcuts.

This is such a great and more importantly, easy recipe. I, like some of the others that tried this put the dry ingredients in first then added the milk and I had no clumping. I also added an egg as it thickened as one person suggested but after I did I noticed it really didn't need it. I used slightly less suger as well. As you can tell from all the reviews this recipe can really be played with to suit anyones personal taste and it still ends up being quick, easy and delicious!!

Really simple and good.  A touch too sweet as written.  I added an egg as it began to thicken as per someone else's suggestion.  Good.

I think this was beautiful. I used 1/3 cup sugar like others suggested but other than that I thought it was wonderful. Served it warm over frozen mixed berries - my husband and I cleaned the pan!

Very good basic recipe..I also mixed all the dry ingredients in the pot, added the cold milk and whisked. I cut back on the sugar, and the cornstarch. Cornstarch needs to be cooked to get rid of the raw taste, a few minutes will do it. Topped with fresh strawberries in their own syrup. Very tasty!!!

Nice flavor.  It came out a little "gloppy" though.  I could see wisking an egg yolk into the cold milk and stirring constantly then cutting back on the corn starch.  Maybe that would help with the consistancy.

This is a great pudding to have like at 9pm when you're craving something sweet!!  I love sugary things and it seemed a bit sweet for me, I might add less sugar.  Also, I followed another's advice and dissolved the sugar and cornstarch in water before adding to milk so there would be no clumps, I also added a bit more cornstarch because of other reviews that said it didn't set, mine did fine. I would describe this pudding as easy and good but not a very rich pudding, I might call it albino pudding, it's so white and clear!! thanks rosemary

This is a nice, easy recipe.  To make it with no lumps, just mix dry ingredients and milk together, turn on the heat, and stir constantly. To change things up, sometimes I add some cocoa to make chocolate pudding, or some cinnamon, nutmeg, cooked rice and raisins for a rice pudding.

I followed another reviewers advice by putting all the dry ingredients in the saucepan first and adding cold milk.  That way the cornstarch would dissolve.  Then I heated it up and followed the rest of the directions.  Turned out perfect, not lumpy and just the right consistency of pudding.  Tasted great too.  Will definitely make again.

This went together very fast.  Mine was a bit 'spotted' with teeny tiny lumps that I didnot stir well enough...but It tasted good and It was easy and I had all the ingredients on hand and it took minimal time to prepare.  Mine had looked like thickend milk, But tatsed wonderful.  Will save this one!!

I usually make rice pudding, but this was good, and very easy.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract in addition to the vanilla. I had to reheat on the stove to get it to thicken. A good basic start to add to...

Tastes great!  To avid clumps I mixed the corn starch in 2 tablespoons of cold water, then mixed in the sugar and added it to the hot milk.
It came out beautifully.  Unfortunately I only had half the starch the recipe called for, so it did not firm up as much as I would like.  I'll try again!

This recipe, even when mixed with a little milk, it clumped. I had to use extra milk, vanilla, and cornstarch for it to even taste a little good. not worth the time.

I made some changes. I whisked the cold milk and corn starch together in the same pan I planned to use for cooking. then added the rest of the ingredients in no particular order and whisked them until everything was mixed, oh, and I cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup. Then cooked over medium heat, whisking constantly. No problems, no lumps.

1/13/20:  It was very good and easy to make.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 was because it did not quite thicken like I thought it would.  It probably deserves a 4 1/2 star rating.

Used 2tbsp of cornstarch, one egg yolk. I mixed the sugar, starch, salt first in pot. Then added cold milk (2.5cups) as suggested to prevent lumps (it worked). I stirred it constantly until it was thick. I might add less sugar next time. It’s pretty sweet.

Tasted great and was so simple to make. Next time I will use 3 and 1\2 tablespoons of cornstarch only because my husband likes it a little thicker than it was. Of course, he ate it minutes off the stove and didn't let it sit to cool down and set up.

This was a great recipe as written. I followed it to the (T). No lumps (ad dry mixture slowly) while stirring. (I used a wisk to stir) I added 1 extra Tsp. If Vanilla and 1 Extra Tbsof butter that was for my husband's taste buds.this Pudding is being used in a punch bowl cake recipe. Like I mentioned previously it was great and really did not need any altering to me. I will definitely make again to eat directly and to use in other recipes. THIS WILL BE MY GO 2 HOMEMADE PUDDING :)
Thank you for sharing ; )

You can't make good pudding without eggs!  I followed the directions (which were very vague) and ended up with a runny mess with lumps in it.  Had to dump it all out!

I made this just now no problem with lumps smooth pudding easy to make.  I just did not like the taste of this pudding....sorry it was way to sweet. I love  vanilla pudding over chocolate cake I couldn’t enjoy the cake.  Would not make it again or  recommend it . I don’t like writing bad reviews.

I learned to make pudding in a double boiler (or metal bowl over hot water filled pan for lack there of).  I followed ingredients fairly closely.  I'm a not measure person.  It came out good.  I'm making for a banana cream pie, have some left over almost old bananas to use up.

This is incredibly sweet and fairly runny. I like my pudding much thicker.  If i were to alter this recipe,  I would add 25% less sugar and 25% more cornstarch.

I used the suggestions in the comments about adding the cold milk to the dry ingredients and it came out perfect. I did use a little less sugar, and being the vanillaholic I am, I used pure vanilla and added a little extra. Next time I am going to use vanilla beans.  But not only was it a hit for me, but it was also approved by my cat.

This is my second review.  As soon as I pressed send I realized I was unlikely to eat a 2nd serving and 3 stars was way to generous.  I divided into 4 servings so the recipe ratio is 2 T of sugar for 1/2 cup of milk - extremely sweet.  I'd only make this if someone was allergic to eggs and I'd use 3 T of sugar and I'd lower the salt if using salted butter or no salt with salted butter. Egg based custards are way, way better. I had no lumps. Just whisk away.

I cut back on the sugar and still thought this vanilla pudding was overly sweet. I’d cut back even more if I made it again — maybe just 1/4 cup.

This recipe was too sweet for me even when I reduced the sugar to 1/3c. Next time I will try 1/4c. 
I followed some of the advice from other reviews and put the dry ingredients into the pan first, however, I also added an egg yolk at this stage with a small amount of cold milk. Once all the dry ingredients were well-mixed, I slowly added the milk while whisking, then put it on the stove. No lumps! I also added an extra tablespoon of butter at the end just because butter makes everything delicious. The pudding turned out rich and velvety! Yummm. Looking forward to trying it again with less sugar.

Made this today. Wanted some vanilla pudding/comfort food for my unhappy tummy. It was very good! I read the reviews and, then, from my own cooking experience, made some changes. I find it annoying when people say it was a great recipe and then tell you all the changes they made - which makes it NOT the recipe they are rating - but here I go doing it!  Mix all dry ingredients together with a wire whisk, then whisk in the cold milk, stirring constantly. (I love very sweet things and I put in the amount the recipe called for but , honestly, next time I will cut the sugar back to probably 2/3 cup). After doing this, I remembered that my mom always put an egg in her puddings, which makes it richer, so I took one egg. Whisked it to make it frothy, then added it to the pudding mixture. Put on medium heat and stirred it constantly with the whisk until thickened (which happened faster than I expected! Probably the egg made the difference.) Removed from heat, added vanilla and butter, and 1 drop of yellow food coloring. Stirred together until butter was melted and well blended. Delicious! Next time, if I decide to add an egg again, I might cut back a little on the cornstarch, to make it a little thinner in consistency. But I definitely will make this recipe again as written, but cut back on the sugar. Planned to put it over some sliced bananas but it was too good plain!

I made this with no problems. I did only use half of the sugar 1/4 cup & substitutes cream cheese for butter, but I put it in with cold milk so it could melt. I normally mix corn starch with cold liquid to avoid lump, but I think because I mixed it well with the sugar then slowly poured in while using a mini wisk, no lumps! It tastes great and I plan on using it on a cake tomorrow.

Be warned, it turned out  very well only because I added the  cornstarch to the cold milk. Cornstarch becomes lumpy and difficult to dissolve in hot liquid. After that simple change we had a smooth and creamy vanilla pudding. Will make again.

This is a great starter recipe. I took the advice of a couple of reviews and whisked the dry ingredients in with the milk before heating. (no lumps) I also substituted 1/2 cup of whipping cream in place of 1/2 cup milk. It has a lovely flavor and texture. I personally didn't find it to be too sweet. I will most definitely use it again.

I have done this 4 times already and the only way it would come out without clumps is if I mixed in the cornstarch with the milk prior to heating. I also cut back on the sugar as I found it too sweet, and added cinnamon instead.

Very good if you like very sweet vanilla pudding.  Nothing magical about  it, but easy to make and can be modified any way you like.  I would reduce the sugar a bit and use real vanilla extract.

It was incredibly easy to make and I followed the directions. The secret is to keep stirring, keep an eye on the temperature and add the dry ingredients slowly. However, it's a lot easier to make, if the ingredients are mixed together beforehand. I have also experimented by cutting the sugar in half, with no ill effect. It actually tastes better with less sugar, as it brings out the vanilla flavor.

Following the instructions of the previous reviewers this came out really nicely. Although I have to admit I am much more partial to puddings using egg yolks, but this was delicious and a lot quicker for me to whip up.

Easy recipe. Very very sweet!! Too sweet. Next time I will cut back on the sugar by atleast 1/3. 

Tip: 
You cannot leave this on the stove or you will get lumps. Keep stirring, have everything ready to mix in before you put the milk on the stove. 

Otherwise a solid recipe!

This might just be the most addicting thing I've ever eaten! Before making, I read the comments and did what they said, I blended everything dry before heating. The first time I did wind up with a small handful of lumps, but the second time I started my heat low and very slowly turned it up until it was done. No lumps this time! I stirred it more often than once or twice a minute, so maybe that helped.

Made it.Love it! just like my gma made. 
This time I used only 1/3 C sugar & small extra shake of salt & used 1/2 c evap milk + 1/2 C water+ 1 C reg milk
Make sure you mix cornstarch with 1/2 C of the milk, mix well, use whisk if have one, then add to pot.

Today ,  i could not find my boxed pudding stretcher recipe, so i cut this recipe to 3 servings omitted the sugar & added to a boxed mix, I do not care for a real sweet pudding.
I put this in a jar and shook as another reviewer Dee had done, great tip!!

Excellent pudding.  Reminds me of my childhood. I followed the recipe to the "T" and it came out perfectly.  No lumps at all. I used a hand whisk on the dry ingredients first, then added it slowly to the hot milk while whisking all the combined ingredients.  Next time I will cut the sugar to maybe a 1/3 or 1/4 cup. Not because it was too sweet, but I just remembered that's a lot of sugar.

Quick, simple and satisfying.  I use it all the time in desserts that need a pudding layer, and it works all the time. I despise the no-bake instant pudding flavor and texture. My advice to others:  use whole milk, good quality butter, and the best real vanilla extract you can buy.  In a recipe this basic, all the ingredients need to be of highest quality.  If you use I

For our large family (9) I made 4 batches and there were leftovers.  This was fantastic!  I followed other reviewers and used extra butter.  For 4 batches, 1/2 cup.  It was very good but not overly rich like some of the puddings I've made with egg yolks, too...  I could have easily used 1/4 cup butter and 2 egg yolks for a similar taste, I bet.  Thanks!  New staple for us!

As others stated I put dry ingredients in pot first then cold liquid and stir then turn on the heat. Easy great tasting pudding and the kiddos love it! I reduce sugar to 1/3 cup and use almond milk!

Made this about four times  and only changed one ingredient.   Instead of corn starch, I used Cornaby's  NON-GMO, Ultra Gel, simply because I just love the results I get from using it.   I used seven level TBLS to create a soft gel and adding one or two more TBLS will naturally create a more firmer consistency if that's the texture you're looking for.    But, my husband and I like the soft texture.

This is an easy basic pudding as long as you first mix the starch with cold liquid. 

First time, I followed the recipe exactly. A little too sweet for us.

Second time,  I reduced the sugar slightly (just didn't  fill the measuring cup full). I also added a vanilla bean to the warming milk and let it heat up very slowly.

Hummm third time....maybe add some lavender instead of vanilla

This is my second time in 2 days im making this recipe. I'm using it as a base for my banana pudding. Someone suggested starting cold. Adding everything to the pot then turning on the heat to avoid lumps. I did this and havent had a lump yet.

This is such a great recipe. I agree with another reviewer to wisk everything together except the vanilla and butter before you put it on the stove.  The cornstarch should dissolve in the cold milk and you won't have lumps. Once it thickens remove it from the heat and add the vanilla and butter. I added leftover jasmine rice and made rice pudding and it was awesome!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is by far the BEST pudding recipe out there! I did what a few of the other comments said and added the milk, sugar, and cornstarch into the pan COLD, and then stirred constantly. 
It's also delicious topped with cinnamon or nutmeg (or BOTH!), and despite what the recipe says, it's good either warm or cold! :D

I need a larger portion to fill a shortbread pie crust I made. I combined the base recipe and took the advice of several other users.  I added 1 c of heavy cream, 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch, 0.5 tablespoons of vanilla, 1 tablespoon of butter and 3 yolks.  I added all the cornstarch, salt and sugar to the cold liquids and whisked everything to dissolve them and them placed it on the heat. When the liquid came up to a bare simmer I tempered the yolks and added them. I simmered everything for another minute, removed from heat and stored in the vanilla and butter. No lumps, gloriously rich texture, not too sweet (I didn't add additional sugar) and it was thick enough for a pie filling.

The ingredients  are fine.  However, cornstarch tends to lump  unless added to cold liquid.  After 50+ years of cooking I suggest strongly that the dry ingredients be whisked together and then stir in the liquid prior to putting over the heat.to cook.

First, I doubled the recipe to use as banana cream pie filling. I used banana extract instead of vanilla and added 2 extra tablespoons of cornstarch. I also made it with Splenda instead of sugar for the pie living diabetic in my life.  It was a huge hit! Everyone loved it, both diabetics and sugar eaters lol.

Delicious pudding!  I doubled it and layered it with vanilla wafers and slices of banana for a great banana pudding.  I did not change the ingredients but used the cold milk method other cooks suggested.  No lumps!

Followed others' advise to mix dry ingredients, add the cold milk, then heat. Used 1/3 cup of sugar and could probably go down to 1/4 cup.  Also used arrow root instead of cornstarch (same measurement) and sprinkled in some cinnamon and allspice. Excellent!

Great flavor and really easy.  I agree that it is too sweet though and I have a terrible sweet tooth.  Whole milk makes it richer.

I whisked cold milk, vanilla as well as 2 egg yolks in pot.   Whisked dry ingredients in a bowl,  using 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 c white sugar and only 1/4 tsp salt.  Whisked dry into milk then heated over medium heat til thickened.  Removed from heat then added butter.   Daughter loved cinnamon and nutmeg added.

Perfection! Half the sugar, double the butter and add an egg yolk for a more custard like taste and texture. As one commenter noted, to avoid lumps, put all of the dry ingredients  in the pot and add the wet ingredients cold.

I followed the recipe and listened to someone who said in a review that there was too much sugar.  I reduced the sugar to about 2/3 and could have reduced  it to more like half and it would have been just right. When adding the premixed cornstarch sugar and salt I used a whisk and had no problem with it getting lumpy.  Also, I've never heard of not fully cooking corn starch to a light bubbly heat because this pudding did not set completely and it's watery. This is why I gave it 2 stars. it tastes fine but it's like eating vanilla soup with bananas and vanilla wafers and I'm very disappointed.

I used half the sugar, 1/4 cup, and for me the taste was better. This is very creamy and smooth. To keep it from lumping, which cornstarch does, I put the milk in the freezer for a few minutes to make sure it was very cold, then mixed all the ingredients (except the butter) together in the cold milk. Then, put it in the pot, added the butter and heated. No lumps at all. Put plastic wrap on the surface and it won't form a skin.

This recipe is just okay.  I agree that it is missing the rich taste of eggs.  Also, definitely must whisk milk slowly into the dry mixed ingredients.  Do cut back on the sugar.  I used scant 1/3 cup. I will go back to my old tried-and-true Betty Crocker vanilla cream pudding.

This is a good pudding recipe. I have never made homemade pudding before making this, but it was very simple. I read the reviews, which is why I am taking the time to do it myself. The suggestions to use less sugar are definitely warranted. I doubled the recipe and used about 1/6 less sugar than what was suggested and I feel I could've used just about half the amount listed. Per 4 cups of milk, I would try 1/2 cup sugar...perhaps just a little more, but not a full cup. Other than that, I'm also glad I read the suggestions about the cornstarch trouble with lumps. I added all of the ingredients except the vanilla and butter while it was heating so that the cornstarch had a chance to really get stirred in before getting hot. I started it off really low heat too and then bumped it up to medium heat. After a few minutes I added vanilla bean caviar and then when it got thick I turned the heat off and added the butter. Someone on here suggested making a rice pudding out of this and I believe that's what I will do next time I make it. They added a few spices too ( cinnamon and nutmeg) and I'm all about that! I'm happy I didn't run out and get a pudding mix this time! Thanks for sharing!

I agree that it is too sweet. Other than that, I did exactly as written and had no problems with lumps. I added cooked rice after it had thickened and wala... Quick and easy rice pudding!

I followed this recipe to the tee and it was awesome! Once I did the heating of the milk, I used a whisk to slowly add the sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Once it was all encorperated I used a large spoon to stir constantly till the spoon was coated, mixture was thick, but not boiling, stopped heat and added butter and vanilla. Awesome, I will definitely use again and again!!!

I made this because one of my kids had a sore throat and was not liking solids, but this was so delicious and easy that I plan to make it again purely for the sake of how great it is.

Based on reviewing others' suggestions, I modified as follows:
(i) doubled the recipe, 
(ii) halved the sugar to 1/4 cup, 
(iii) doubled the vanilla,
(iv) included some heavy cream instead of all milk,
(v) added 2 eggs,
(vi) mixed dry ingredients, eggs, cold milk/heavy cream, and microwaved until thick (with frequent breaks for whisking to temper eggs), and then added butter and vanilla, and 
(vii) put the cooked pudding in the refrigerator in the same bowl I microwaved it in.

I served with blackberries on top, although serving it plain or all the other suggested variations would be great too.

For something so easy and basic it sure tastes good!!!

First of add all the dry ingredients to COLD milk and after a few good whisks place on the flames. you'll end up with a soft and creamy pudding in about 5 minutes.

I used vanilla paste (real not imitation) and threw in two dashes of cinnimon and one dash of nutmeg (finely grounded) and the family didn't eve wait for it to go into the fridge!

perfect for a weekend get together and super cheap.

Excellent recipe! You must follow the instructions for it to turn out perfectly smooth and creamy. I poured the pudding over vanilla wafers and bananas for the most delicious banana pudding ever!!

I loved  this. Just like the recipe said sweet and simple for this first time attempt at ever making homemade pudding. I cooked all the ingredients together in a pan and added milk like a previous user said to avoid lumps.  I'm gonna top the pudding with rainbow sprinkles next time.

I couldn't find my recipe for pudding without eggs and with the exception of butter and the way it"s mixed  this looked close. 

The biggest issue for me is the sweetness. I usually cut down on the sugar in most my recipes. If I remember correctly the reviews are a mix between those who didn't  think it was sweet enough and those who commented it's too sweet. I generally start with 1/2 to 3/4 the sugar called for.  I decided best start with 1/2 based on reviews. Even at that it was WAY TOO SWEET!!!  If this happens to you have are some options to cut the sweetness: IAdd cooked rice for a rice pudding {maybe a few raisens if not too overly sweet).  For chocolate lovers add cocoa when cooking or after for chocolate pudding.

Also, I'm not big on putting butter on a lot of things but based on the comment in the recipe that it's what makes it I chanced it despite the extra fat. Didn't care for the heavy taste of it. 

I did do the cornstarch mixed with the dry ingredients and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked with no lumps. 

it's a good starting point until I can perfect it to my taste preference. I usually add more spice to thing like this and change them around depending on what flavor I'm in the mood for. Think about using flavors other than vanilla. You can put the pudding in individual dishes and try other extracts like hazelnut, maple, butterscotch, lemon or rum (or use the real things). What candy do you like  cinnamon hotties, butterscotch, sour apple ??, .wate

Very nice with cinnamon and tennis biscuits sprinkled along the sides. Takes very close to milk tart. Came out smooth no lumps. Set decently in the fridge in an hour. 3 out of 6 people served and said was a bit too sweet but otherwise nice. So I'll use this recipe again but with 1/4 cup of sugar.

It turned out ok but my family loves chocolate pudding more. Seems like something is missing from this recipe but I can't quite put my finger on it. In any case, a strong recipe.

Like other people, I also added the corn starch to the dry ingredients first, then whisked in the milk (I used 1c heavy cream and 1c milk). The taste is quite lovely and silky. Thanks!

Pretty basic recipe. I've never done one without eggs so I was willing to give this a try. It came out entirely too sweet for my taste. Even my boyfriend, who LOVES sweets, said it was a little too sweet for him. I will definitely be cutting the amount of sugar next time.

I made it exactly as stated except I increased the vanilla by 50% (because I love vanilla) and I doubled the recipe to make a banana pudding. I also added the dry ingredients to cold milk in the pan and stirred it with a whisk. Tastes wonderful and the consistency is perfect.

I doubled the recipe...used half and half instead of milk and put dry ingredients in pot first then whisked in half and half..i used vanilla beans while it simmered then added butter and vanilla extract at the end then strained into a large bowl topped with saran wrap to prevent skin on surface of pudding..patiently waiting to fully cool. i tried it warm and it was delicious!!!!

I followed a suggestion from another reviewer and began with all of the dry ingredients in the pan and slowly added the milk for a lump free pudding. I originally doubled the recipe but could tell that the sugar was WAY too much. To cut the sweetness I added 2 more cups of milk, 3 more tbs cornstarch (dissolved in warm pudding mixture in a small bowl), etc. to bring everything up to triple. I also added vanilla bean. 

This is a really easy, delicious pudding that I will certainly make again.

Good recipe to follow.

For health reason, I cut down on the sugar. Instead of the recipe's 1/2 cup of sugar (~= 1 cup = 200ml [ though it's not stated in the recipe ], but I believe it's safe to state that 1 cup = 200ml, so, 1/2 cup = 100ml), I added only 15ml of sugar.

Also, I added all the ingredients into the  cold milk, then blended for about 1 minute. 

Heated the medium pan with very  little amount of cooking oil added, then poured the blended ingredient  into the pan, stirring continually.

Avoided boiling (like what some of the people here advised).

After the blend had thickened enough (subjective judgement), poured it onto a container.  Cooled it, before putting it into the fridge.

I love it!!! This pudding is very delicous and easy to make.   I used Lactaid Fat-Free Milk and 1/2 cup plus 1 teaspoon of Splenda rather than sugar, and mine turned out light and delicious but a little thin ..... probably because we ate it immediately, before it had time to set.  This is a keeper.  Will be making this many more times.

I love it because it is so easy to make! I can't remember having an easier time making pudding. Best of all I like it because you can add anything to it. I added banana to the pudding and it tasted great. I also tried whith blackberries and it was even better. My favorite part is to eat it when it is warm!

Yum! I followed the reviews to do the dry ingredients then add the cold milk and it was really good. It's a little sweet when it's warm, so I may cut down the sugar a bit. I made a banana cream pie with it, and it was so good! ??

I made this twice. Both times I followed the recipe exactly, and both times it didn't turn out. The first time it turned out too lumpy. The second time it was wayyyy too runny. It was like soup. What did I do wrong?

Great recipe for a basic vanilla pudding, used it to fill cupcakes. I also didn't follow directions because you need to mix the cornstarch with a cold liquid first to avoid lumps so I mixed all the dry ingredients in the pan, added the cold milk, whisked until combined then turned the heat on. Also for all the reviewers that added egg to this you have now turned it from a pudding, which is it's intent, into a custard. (still very delicious as a custard base though)

The taste was really good, but this pudding is much to sweet and have too much vanilla in it.  So when I make it again I will use 1/3 cup of sugar and 3/4 teaspoon of vanilla which should make it about right for me.

I followed the recipe exactly.  This turned out perfectly.  I had no lumps; it was very smooth.  I whisked the milk non-stop as I added the the mixed dry ingredients a little at a time.  I did not stop whisking until after I took it off the heat.  Also, the pudding set really quickly, so I didn't have to whisk for long at all.

I tried this recipe out of curiosity and it was great! I took the other reviewers ideas and put in dry ingredients first. It was still a bit lumpy but the flavor is great! Thanks for the great pudding idea!

Did it first time no lumps tasted very good almost like a custard but with no egg's. For people with the problem with lumps, when you put the corn starch mixer into the milk you cannot leave it a second soon as the corn starch hits the milk you need to mix or whisk. Best results is using a nice balloon whisky to get rid of the lump and a spoon will not work well.

I just used this recipe for banana pudding. It was great! I added some cream cheese after the butter and vanilla as an afterthought. It made it really rich. Great basic recipe to have in my box. It is super easy. Definitely mix the dry ingredients with cold milk first though to avoid lumpy pudding.

This was just ok for me. The flavor was good, but only after I added extra vanilla, close to a tablespoon. I made Chocolate Cornstarch Pudding(by Kelly) from this site last night and the texture/thickness was perfect this one needs tinkering with in my opinion. It just didn't thicken up as much as I would have liked, and it's nearly impossible to add more cornstarch because it would thin it out(not sure of the physics behind that, but that is what I've always been told about adding more cornstarch to something that's already been thickened). It had more of a creme anglaise thickness, which was fine since I was serving it over some pound cake I had leftover in the freezer, but it definitely was not "pudding" thickness made as stated. Even cooking on medium heat and constantly stirring, it still scorched on the bottom a bit, and I have brown pieces floating around, it won't deter me from eating it, but I wouldn't serve it to company. I'm not sure if I'll make this again, since I had better luck with the other recipe, I may try that one, but leave out the cocoa powder and add extra vanilla. The method is different too, mix dry first, add milk, then heat. Maybe I'll try this recipe again doing the method like that. Thanks so much for the recipe anyways, it'll give me a challenge to tinker with it(I like tinkering!)! :)

I think store bought puddings with all the artificial flavors have ruined me. This recipe seems a little bland. I think as pie filling or parfait it would be better (other flavors to mingle with the vanilla).

Tried this because I needed to use up a lot.of whole milk. Wow, it was like liquid sugar! You could easily reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup and still have plenty sweet taste. I also added a little extra vanilla. The whisk also worked well to avoid lumps.

Lesson learned: read the reviews before you make the recipe!
To remedy lumps in this or any cornstarch recipe (gravy) strain through a wire strainer while it is still hot.
We had to add chocolate syrup just to make it palatable, way too sweet!

Ya'll who complaining of lumps obviously don't have pegs for your aprons in the kitchen. No offense, but it really is something so logical for a seasoned cook or baker. Cornstarch lumps in any hot liquid. I altered the recipe, but stuck really close to it. I used the same measurements, but as a lactose intolerant, logically, I used Almond Breeze Original Milk instead of the milk. For starters, WHISK WHISK WHISK in your pot the milk and cornstarch first until you get a frothy appearance with lots of bubbles. Then add all but the vanilla and whisk all over until it is more bubbly frothy like the first time. Then turn the burner on Medium (4-5) and KEEP WHISKING. Add vanilla. KEEP WHISKING. I whisked until it set (thickened). Poured in a bowl, stuck it in the fridge and forgot about it til it was time to serve. I found a only one thing... the sugar was overpowering the vanilla flavor. How to solve it? Again, Aprons Up! Add 1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla. Problem solved. I loved the texture, consistency, flavor. I put this in the recipe box and it will be made again.

I used PattyJoy's version of the recipe and it turned out perfectly the second time! It was my first time making pudding and I did not know that you have to stir it A LOT so I turned out burning the bottom of the pot a little bit. The second time I did it I knew that I had to stir the pudding much more and it came out perfectly! It was absolutely delicious and I would totally make it again!

I followed the recipe the whole time I was making this pudding, and it turned out thicker than normal pudding should be. It was almost like a custard by the time it was done. Other than that there was nothing wrong with this recipe, It tasted amazing and everyone loved it.

Great recipe. My mom use to make this for me when I was a kid. My only suggestion would be not to mix cornstarch with dry ingredients. To avoid clumps separately wisk a little cold milk with the 3 tablespoons of cornstarch then add to hot milk, this will make your pudding clump free!

My daughter, who is soon to give me a grandbaby, was craving banana pudding. I was going to make Banana Pudding IV from this website. My husband bought the wrong sized box of pudding required. I didn't want to disappoint the woman that would soon give me the greatest gift. So, I made this recipe to incorporate with the box of pudding. I have yet to make the Banana pudding recipe, but this was very tasty and easy to make. I had all the ingredients on hand and will use this recipe again when my grandbaby gets here. Like another reviewer suggested, I added the dry ingredients to the sauce pan first. I then added 1/2 cup of milk and mixed until dry ingredients were dissolved. Then added the rest of the milk. No lumps. I haven't given it enough time to set up and chill, but I am sure this recipe will work great for what I wanted it for. Not quite the same as boxed pudding, but good for a homemade treat anytime. Will try to add some cocoa powder next time.

Dear Rosemary,

Thank you for the ingredients list, I tried it, eagerly waiting to try it once it's chilled : )

I added 1 egg yolk to thicken it and follow the reviews in making the pudding.

When using cornstarch it is always best to divide the liquid being used, remove 1/4c milk and place into separate container and as you heat the rest of the milk place cornstarch alone into the 1/4c milk and whisk. It's important to whisk to prevent lumpy and create a good consistency. It's important to add the cornstarch when the rest of the milk is warm enough and place the salt and vanilla at same time. Last step put in butter. 
There are also some variations, you can place the cornstarch in and allow the liquid to boil for up to 2 minutes before pouring into the serving cups. Just make sure to stir constantly to prevent burning and you can omit the butter if you boil.

Delicious. I made a half recipe. Whisked an egg yolk into the milk and poured into dry ingredients then heated it. Perfect consistency. Poured warm pudding over sliced bananas. Mmmm. Gluten free bananna pudding.

Good recipe.  I avoided lumps by slowly whisking in the dry ingredients. This worked perfectly in a peanut butter trifle recipe that was a huge hit at Christmas!

I completed this recipe substituting the cornstarch for ap flour (I added one additional tsp). Instead of adding the vanilla and the butter once the boiling process had completed, instead I added it after sifting in and blending the sugar mixture into the pot, bringing to boil. The final results were DELISH!! Thanks for such a great recipe.

This turned out GREAT! I used 2% milk and added 2 egg yolks like reviewers suggested. I also slowly added the dry ingredients to the cold milk stirring w/ a with a whisk and then heated up the milk stirring constantly adding the yolk as I stirred. Taste testing as I went I was worried it was going to be too starchy. But NOPE! Not at all! Came out delicious! Next TRY, Rice Pudding!

This recipe is pretty good. For some reason my craving has been vanilla pudding. Yes I got lumps couple times but I ended up putting it in the blender lol. Also what helps not get lumps is putting all the ingredients in the cold milk and then put it in the pot.

Tried the recipe with a couple variations, the first was increasing the sugar by a 1/4 cup and adding an 1/8 tsp of coconut powder into the dried ingredients.

This recipe was too bland and sweet for pudding, it was more like icing. Though, I'd be interested in some of the suggestions of using an egg and cutting down on the sugar.

I thought this recipe was great...a simple but delicious vanilla pudding.  

I did make a few minor modifications though: i used half and half instead of milk and i used a very high quality vanilla (when using vanilla they are NOT all alike.  Do yourself a favor and buy the good stuff for the richest vanilla flavor).  I also used 1/3 cup sugar instead of the directed 1/2 cup.  I reserved 1/4 cup of the cold milk, or in my case half and half, and blended it with the cornstarch, sugar and salt to a well blended consistency while the rest of the milk was heating in the saucepan.  Once it was warm i added my cornstarch milk mixture and continued to stir until thick.  The pudding once cooked had a very nice creamy consistency amd did not have cornstarch lumps.

I did as Kyo suggested, put in all the dry stuff and added in the cold wet stuff.  Worked great!!  I also used raw milk (which is legally sellable in my state) and this was a great use for it as it is cooked...and the supercreamy milk only added to the richness!! 

Instead of vanilla extract, I just split and plopped in what I had left of a Madagascar vanilla bean (I already had maybe a quarter of it cut off to make something else and wanted to use it very soon), and let it sit in there during the whole cooking process, taking out the bean pod when the pudding was thick enough.  It only made this more wonderful and rich.  The flavor really comes through because of using the cornstarch and not using eggs.  

I also just bought three Tahitian vanilla beans, which do NOT have the same smell and taste as the Madagascar beans...and I bet you'd really be able to tell the subtle difference in the beans using *especially* this recipe!

Next time I might quadruple this.  The original recipe doesn't make enough.  I already doubled it and my mom ate almost half of it in one sitting.  Thanks mom.  :P

"Whoda thunk" that changing flour for cornstarch, adding sugar and vanilla would change a simple white sauce into Vanilla pudding!  omg, it's DELICIOUS!  I'll never have to buy boxed pudding again.  
A few notes: This needs to be made a day before or early in the morning so it cools off to be edible, but it's delicious.   
A few recipe changes tho:    I added the sugar and salt into the milk first. I added an extra tbsp of cornstarch and dissolved the cornstarch in tepid water before adding to milk. (prevents lumping) I also added a bit of Coffeemate French Vanilla as I use imitation vanilla not real vanilla.  Delicious!

Quick and easy, with an excellent taste and texture.
I did put the cornstarch in the pot with the cold milk.
I would make this again and again, beats the boxed stuff and doesn't have a chemical taste!

Bad. There's no real taste besides the thick corn starch - and 3 servings makes only one cup of pudding. But I guess that worked out in my favour because it tasted horrible.

I am not sure what happened when I made this, but it went hard, like really hard lol. The flavour was ok, not overly sweet or anything. But I went wrong somewhere even after following the recipe exactly. lol I rated it a 3 based on the flavour itself and not my mistakes. lol I will make again and see what happens next time, I like to try a recipe twice before I make my mind up.

My pudding never got thick, it actually got thinner even though I followed the recipe exactly. It was also WAY too sweet (for someone with a sweet tooth), so I wish I had read others suggestions beforehand. Next time I will use 2% milk, 1/2 the sugar and play around with the heating and hopefully it will work.

It won't hurt to blend the cornstarch and milk before cooking, but if your cornstarch is relatively fresh it should not be a problem.  The process of whisking the cornstarch and sugar together should break up any lumps before blending.  I added half a cup of raisins as it cooked, and a pinch of cinnamon.  Eaten warm is just right for that grandma made it taste.  It is a tad sweet, I would probably reduce the sugar next time.

I made the pudding as directed, and I had no problem with lumps. Maybe because I was stirring with a wisk? It was very smooth and creamy, but I, too, thought it was waaaay too sweet. Will definitely cut the sugar to at least half next go round.

Very good and easy. Glad I read the reviews. I followed their advises. Add the cold milk to the cornstarch, sugar, and salt: then heated it up. I also added half a table spoon of vanilla. Now I need a chocolate pudding recipe this good and easy.

I used this recipe for a pie filling. I was stuck with a pudding recipe that just did not work, and this was my first result on google. It is so easy and simple, it took no time to make. Now my pie will be ready for my 4th of july party! Thank you!

This recipe is SO EASY and its delicious!! One thing though...just like everyone else...mix dry ingredients w milk cold and whisk then heat so you avoid lumps. I have celiac disease so love this recipe using corn starch. It is a little sweet so next time will only add 1cup + sugar but still is awesome. Will also try adding cooked rice next time to try rice pudding.

this was excellent
i have also made this 
adding in a couple egg yolks 
that i have tempered with some pudding
for an even richer pudding
always start with cold ingredients mixed together 
then bring up till almost boiling
and you wont get a single lump

I made this for a recipe that called for vanilla pudding (which I didn't have on hand) - this was wonderful! I used a whole vanilla bean instead of the extract and it added a great richness. Will use this instead of a box in the future.

yum! added cocoa, almond extract and 2tbsp honey & 1/2tbsp extra corn startch. Omitted butter, was velvety smooth without it but will try next time to see what it does.  to prevent clumps: sift dry ingredients to mix.  put back in sifter. sift into milk.  I stirred for the first bit and then let it sit on the stove on its own for 2mins, when it began to boil i stirred it for 1min.  turned out perfectly.

Yummy.  This recipe is good.  Except I only use 1/4 cup sugar.  But the pudding is smooth and tasty.  I'll use this pudding to fill my eclairs.  So fast and easy to make.  Next time I'll use real vanilla insead of that imitation stuff.   Thank you for the recipe.  A keeper.

I have have never made home made pudding before except making custards and pudding for pies...but this was AWSOME!  I love how there is no egg yolks!  I used skim milk to make it extra better for me.  Too bad I ate the whole pot of pudding.  As other reviewers have stated, I also put all the dry ingredient together then added cold milk.  Its the only way I've made custards and puddings.  I do think it needs to be thicker but I still loved this.  I used a really good mexican vanilla and nutmeg.

I gave it a four star because the ingredients was good.  Also, I did not want to use eggs cause I tend to make a mess of recipes that ask for it.  I wanted something easy and this was very easy but if your not mixing all the time you do get lumply.  I did use less of the sugar, more of the butter and instead of cornstarch I used flour.  Just make sure to mix all the dry stuff and then add the milk in slowly till you have the lumps out.  I did add the butter when cooking and had no problems. Keep mixing all the time.  Came out great. I used it hot over some fried bananas with fresh strawberries like a vanilla sauce. I will be making it again and next time I'm going to add chocolate cocoa for some chocolate pudding. Also it took less time to cook for me.  Good luck and those who have tried I would say try again.

The trick to no lumps is: 1. Sift all dry ingredients 2. When the milk is heated, all about half to the bowl with dry ingredients and stir.  3. Add everything back to the pan and finish.  4. Chill, and you end up with silky, rich, tastes and texture of heaven.

Very good.  Made it to use in banana pudding for my son who cannot have corn syrup (found in all the pre-made pudding mixes I can find).  I added a little extra sugar and always add some extra vanilla.  I'll definitely add this to my kitchen arsenal.

Made it the recipe way and it was good.  Then doubled the recipe and added (in addition to the doubled ingredients) 2 blocks unsweetened chocolate and an additional 1/4 cup sugar.  Served it hot and it was fantastic.

Good.  Not as epic as claimed by many.  To me it takes like crazy sweet, thick milk... with an odd background of starch.    Admittedly, I tried it warm, maybe I will like it better once chilled.   I can totally imagine this being a good "base" recipe for adding stuff to...

This is a very experimental-friendly and easy recipe. I made it using goat milk, and it turned out very good. I have also added cocoa (about 1 Tbsp) and I have made it using Almond milk. I did use less sugar, because we found it too sweet. Instead of 1/2 cup, I used 1/3 cup.  I has problems with it lumping up after it got cool, so either I am cooking it too long, or I should cool it in ice water. I'll have to test that one.

Made this for school lunches when I was out of desserts to pack...took 5 minutes and was so easy. I combined all of the dry ingredients in the pan, then added organic low fat milk and stirred with a wisk until it came up to gentle boil and thickened. I added vanilla. Omited the butter. All I can say is wow. delicious, satisfying, fast and very special. It's a keeper. Low in fat and I got a serving of milk into my kids.

This was pretty good, but it was too sweet, and without eggs it wasn't quite rich enough, and was strangely pale. If I'm in the need for a dessert that doesn't require eggs, I'd make it again, but would definitely use whole milk or some cream, and would add a few drops of yellow food coloring. I'd also cut the sugar back to 1/4 c.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  We liked it just as is.  Added the dry ingredients with cold milk like others suggested.  We did not wait for it to cool.  The kids, my husband and I all enjoyed it warm.

This was very easy to make and so impressively delicious. I used skim milk but a couple of teaspoons of heavy cream for a bit of fat and flavor.  Definitely mix the cornstarch in milk before heating.  Watch it constantly, since it forms very quickly.  Next time I might use leftover rice to make a mean rice pudding.  This is a thicker pudding, like you would read about in Dickens - not your runny plastic cup stuff.

Very good but I would cut down to 1/4c sugar just a bit to sweet. Make sure u cover it right away or else you will get a film on top!

Very buttery pudding, thinner consistency than I was looking for.  I like my pudding to be near pie consistency, so typical pudding consistency is thin for my tastes.  I mixed the dry ingredients in the pan, put the pan over heat, and whisked the milk in slowly to not get lumps.

my first time making this kind of pudding - made a small amount to serve immediately and it was very good.  Later tried to make one full liter and, while it set quite well, after a day or so in refrigerator it began to separate, sweat or whatever is the correct term:  most stayed set but liquid formed on top and , the longer it stayed in the refrigerator, the more liquid formed.  Used ultrapasteurized light (10 grams milk fat per liter) - 3-1/2 cups plus 1/2 cup ultrapasteurized half cream (half and half type), 1/2 cup of sugar (plenty sweet), 1/2 tsp salt, two tsp. vanilla and 2 TBSP I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.  Stored in the plastic container the margarine came in, with plastic film over to avoid skin.  Please help!   I really like it (both vanilla per recipe and chocolate just by adding some chopped/shaved dark chocolate to hot vanilla pudding) and, if necessary, will only prepare it just before serving BUT would prefer to make a liter or two at a time and have on hand without the liquification problem.  Thank you to anyone who can help me.  Carmen

Like everyone else is saying, mix in the dry ingredients cold to avoid lumps, cut way back on the sugar - I'd use maybe half, and don't use anything less creamy than 2% milk.

Simple and easy. I left out the butter and added cinnamon and nutmeg. I also tried it once adding an egg, which gave it a bit of a richer taste.

Honestly? This is wonderful. The possibilities are ENDLESS! I add a tinyyy bit more vanilla than it calls for, and i agree that u need to whisk the dry ingredients w the cold liquid, but its just awesome. Thank you so much!!  oh, and for those who think it isn't thick enough, you're not cooking it long enough. Be patient. It thickens w more time, and then even more in the fridge!

Excellent recipe. I headed the words of some of other reviews and reduced the sugar to a rounded 1/3 cup. I also substituted potato starch for corn starch (used 2.5 tbs instead of 3)and it is so good! I've never made homemade before and now I see no reason to do otherwise. It's so easy and healthier than store varieties that have fillers and artificial ingredients.

Just made this vanilla pudding.  It thickened gret while I was cooking it.  I took the advise from a few other reviews and only put in a quarter of a cup of sugar and it's plenty sweet enough.  If I had added a half of a cup like the recipe says to it would have been way way toooo sweet.  I was a little skeptical about no egg yolks but it really is good.  I will make it again for sure.

This recipe is awesome! Its a simple way to make homemade pudding. I tried the original ingredients. I didn't think it was too sweet, however I'll most likely double the milk, butter and vanilla and try it that way. I love that it doesn't need eggs. Its yummy hot too!

I'm tired of sugar free Jello pudding - it has an aftertaste and you can't eat it with fruit because the fake Jello sugar makes real sugars taste nasty.  Like some said, the recipe came out a little lumpy but not much.  I'll try the other mixing methods next time!  But the flavor is great, and it's easy to make.  I altered it a bit, using low carb soy milk instead of real milk, and splenda instead of sugar - still tasted groovy :-)

My grandma's recipe for vanilla pudding uses eggs, and I didn't have any eggs, so this was what I was looking for.  It was very flavorful and had a nice sweetness.  Tasted great on top of my grandma's bread pudding.
I did follow another reviewer's instructions and mixed the dry ingredients together first, added whole milk and mixed it all together, then turned on the heat, stirring constantly with a wire whisk until it thickened (to keep lumps from forming).  I removed it from the heat and then added the butter and vanilla.  That is exactly how my grandma made pudding except her ingredients were a little bit different.
Thanks for the recipe.

This was great!  I was looking for a topping for waffles (I normally use purchased vanilla pudding - the kind you have to cook - but I made a mistake and bought instant).  This is MUCH better than warm store-bought puddings on waffles (with peaches - YUMMY).  

I'm only giving this four stars because it really does need an egg.  Although, maybe if I'd used whole milk I wouldn't be saying this.  However, even with skim milk, it was wonderful.  I'll be using this recipe again.

Wins points for being super quick and easy, but I would not serve this to guests.  Did mix the cornstarch and sugar in cold milk, however should have read more reviews - used skim milk and the finished product was an odd color.

I followed the instructions given by the member before which was very helpful. Though I wasn't sure whether to put in the butter and vanilla extract in with the dry ingredients all at the same time, I did it anyway. This was my first pudding and it was creamy and yummy! It could have been thicker though, maybe I should have use regular milk and not fat free? After refrigerating it, it became too solid...oh well, not a bad recipe overall.

Absolutely delicious! I made this with a 1/4 cup browm sugar and it was excellent. I also used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and it didn't affect the consistency ir taste at all. Yummy!

Was a good basic pudding. Very easy and quick to make. A little too sweet, will cut the sugar and thicken more next time.

Excellent recipe!  I mixed the sugar, cornstarch, and salt together and added them to the milk as the milk was heating, stirring constantly until the milk came to a boil.  No lumps.  I like this method of adding cornstarch, and I like that there are no eggs in this recipe.

this recipe is also perfect for making Rice pudding just as left over cooked rice to it and you have rice pudding that's quick and easy and doesn't require heavy cream or cooking the rice while you make it. Makes Nice rich pudding.

I made this last night but with a few modifications. I used soy milk and I added one banana while cooking it down along with cinnamon. It tasted terrific but it did not look pretty with my additions.

It came out kind of a strange consistency...although I did use skim milk which may have been why. Other than that the flavor was good and it was easy to make.

We loved the way the pudding tasted but when we made it, it came out watery and we followed the directions exactly. we let cool in the fridge for over night. It also came out a little bit lumpy. Once again the taste was wonderful so we are going to try it again.

I have to admit, I was hesitant to try this cause of all the mixed reviews but I am very happy I did. This turned out quite delicious! I cut down the serving to one and it was just enough for a small snack. I also followed other reviewers advice and put all the dry ingredients in the pot, then whisked in the cold milk. I then put it on the stove and whisked it all the way through. I added extra butter and vanilla and it came out super rich but oh so good! I got to admit, I did not cut down the sugar but will next time around. I love sweet but this was just a little too sweet. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, will be making this alot.

However I like vanilla so much, I didn't care for this. When I added cinnamon, I immediately liked it very much!
I did get lumps, although I tried the reviewers suggestions: first mix it in the pan before boiling. 
Maybe it was because I had to add more cornstarch to thicken it a little bit more.
The added butter gave the pudding a beautiful shine.

I followed recipe exactly, very sweet and lumpy. I ended up using this in a cake recipe, just too sweet and lumpy to eat 'as is' for my taste. Highly recommend to follow other reviewer's advice by mixing ingredients first, then add milk to avoid lumps - also cut back on the sugar.

I made this for my little boy and he liked it, although he'd much rather chocolate pudding (he's a chocoholic like his Dad).  But mommy really enjoyed it!  I did cut down on the sugar like some people said, and it turned out oh so creamy it was like silk!  I have never made pudding from scratch before, but now I will!!  I also made it for my Grandmother who will be 98 in May and she loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good pudding- I read the reviews and decided to cut the sugar in half.  This was a good move- the sweetness was just right.  It would have been too sweet otherwise.  I used skim milk and it thickened up nicely.  I served it warm with a sprinkle of chocolate chips melting in.

This was so easy, fast and tastes wonderfully homemade.  I put the milk in the pan, turned on the heat to medium just like the recipe says and started mixing the dry ingredients.  As soon as they were mixed, I poured into the milk which was slightly warm.  I whisked together and no lumps at all.  The final product was smooth and creamy.

This was very easy to make, I followed another reviewer's idea and mixed the ingredients together before I heated it and it was smooth. My big problem was the flavour it tasted gross to me, I'm not sure if this is the way homemade vanilla pudding should taste but I much prefer instant vanilla pudding.  I threw it away.

This was really good. My pudding did have some lumps but it was still really good ( the texture didnt bother me.) I will definitely make this again and add fresh fruit to it.  Thanks Rosemary.

Great pudding(wonderful texture)... I put sliced stawberries in the bottom of my dishes and then poured the pudding over. I think it would have been too bland without the strawberries. I would recommend adding some sort of fruit. 

Used splenda instead of sugar and it turned out great

Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!!!

Great taste.  Lousy texture!  Lumpy lumpy.  Even after whisking.  It was almost enough to make me gag.  Maybe I'll mess around with the recipe to see if there's a way to make the texture better, because I really liked the taste (my husband REALLY liked it!)

I agree with the other reviewer that the taste was great, but that it didn't really firm up...is it because I didn't cook it for long enough?  I did cook it until it coated the spoon...I'm not sure.

it is a normal vanilla puding, it was good but only enough for 2 people. Also I didn't follow the recipe because it would make lumps, so I add the starch into the pan before heating and mixed well.Later when I looked at the reviews I saw that many people ahd problem with that. But mine was good! :) I recommend using caramel sauce on top.
