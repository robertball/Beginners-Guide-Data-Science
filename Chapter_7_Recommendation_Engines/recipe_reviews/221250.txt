Yum.. very tasty. Been a while since I had real blue cheese and I forgot how strong it is... in a good way though. The only thing I will add next time is some meat.. ham sausage.. etc. I like meat in my omletes. I used a mixed blend of mexican cheese instead of mozz as I had that in fridge

Loved this! Very earthy flavor with the mushrooms and I used beet greens instead of spinach. Only used 2 eggs and it was a hearty breakfast for one. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good but it was a little bland. Next time I will use fresh garlic.

The recipe is  a great combo of flavors...maybe a bit too much pepper. Five star combo though. However the cooking method I take issue with. Sauteing the onions and then pouring the egg over the top definitely led to burned onions...the second omelet I made, I sauteed about a minute and poured the egg. Turned out a lot better.
