Holy moly this is gooooood! I made this as written but used Black Forest Bacon and I do believe that rich bacon flavor added to the experience. I should mention I did fry the ground beef in the bacon drippings with the onions, mmmmmmm. So So good, did I already say that? It does make a crazy amount and I think next time I will make just half for my family of four. Putting this into regular rotation.

Very good. Recipes like this I usually make the day before cooking them, to meld the flavors (also added 1T. Worcestershire sauce). I put it in a 9x13 pan, & it came to within a 1/2 inch of the top & weighed a ton! I cooked it low & slow for several hours. The only problem I see with this recipe is leftovers.   It's going to be very dry & will need plenty of liquid doctoring before reheating.

This reminds me somewhat of Calico Beans which I bake in the oven.  It definitely has a good blend of flavors and beans.  I’m not convinced that it needs 6 hours in the slow cooker, then refrigerated overnight, and reheated in the slow cooker for an hour the next day.   I slow-cooked it today, we ate it today, and it was very good!  Slow cooking may be a convenience for some, but I think cooking stovetop or even baking in the oven also would be fine.  I did omit the liquid smoke which we don’t care for.  Terra, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made these for a family reunion and everyone loved them. They were getting a little dry towards the end of the cooking time so I just mixed up a little water, ketchup & bar-b-que sauce and they were fine. I would definitely make these again.

I made no changes. These beans are no easier nor more convenient than my decades old family recipe using dry beans  soaked overnight, seasoned, and baked in a slow oven.  In fact, the old-fashioned ones are much healthier.

I have always loved this combination....used to have it as a a main dish when my kids were growing up!  Made it for a friend's surprise birthday party/barbecue, and the recipe was requested by several.  I followed the instructions to a 'T' .  My only comment other than accolades is that I don't think 6 hours in the crockpot is necessary.  Mine became mushy and, like another reviewer, they were somewhat dry and I had to add more bbq sauce/ketchup/water.  I wondered if, in fact, the oven baking might not be better.  That being said, who wants to heat up the kitchen in the summer? BTW, this recipe freezes beautifully!  Thanks, Terra, for sharing.

Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out excellent. Made as a side for Father's Day BBQ and got rave reviews, though it was a little sweet for my taste. When I make it again (and I definitely will) I'll cut the brown sugar by maybe 1/3 or even 1/2.

Yummy, didn't change a thing. Did get better with age, in my opinion, but very good!
