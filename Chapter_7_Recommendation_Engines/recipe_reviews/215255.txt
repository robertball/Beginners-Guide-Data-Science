Quite good but required constant stirring.  I will definitely make this again, though, before adding to my recipe collection.  I served this with grilled lemon pepper chicken and steamed carrots - made a nice presentation.

This was excellent!  I added 1 T. of lemon juice (from the lemon I grated) which was a nice contrast to the creaminess of the risotto.  Cut the asparagus spears on the diagonal for a fancier touch!  I used 4 c. of chicken broth (instead of 3 - I just used a whole carton, which is 4 cups), and 1 less cup of water.  By accident, the first time I made it I forgot to add the last 2 T. of butter at the end, and it was just as good -- and cut the fat/calories in half!  I now cook it this way every time.  DELICIOUS and one of our new favorites.  Yes it requires constant stirring, but you'll only be stirring for about 20 minutes... it's not that bad for such a great end result!  Restaurant quality for sure.

What a great recipe! Thanks!  335 saved but only two reviews?  Honestly, only thing I did differently was skip the second round of butter to save some calories!  So good, a bit labor intensive but not difficult at all. Love.

Great recipe. so simple. i added three cloves of garlic half way through cooking the onions. the lemon zest really adds a great fresh taste. as prev. noted, i cut back on the butter to reduce calories. next time, i will add shrimp and red pepper to make it a more substantial meal. 
Thanks

This was a really great recipe.  Risotto is always a labor of love but worth it in the end.  I added a couple cloves of garlic to the onion saute and a little more parmesan... it was wonderful!!

A beautiful risotto dish. I've made this about five times now and it was always delicious. I do cut down a little on the parmesan and butter sometimes if the meat I serve it with has a sauce with butter in it as well (just seems too rich), but it's always came out beautiful, creamy and the little tang from the lemon really cuts through the rich flavors of a good pan sauce from the meat. Five stars again and again. I've also made this with veggie stock for my sister (vegetarian), and it was still excellent. cheers.

Easy and very good.  Never made risotto before and this was easy to put together.
