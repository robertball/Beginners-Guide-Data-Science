I really enjoyed this, but man is it filling once you add crust to the jamablaya! Also, the bottom crust got a little soggy. Next time, I will probably do away with the bottom crust, and just go for the top. I also like to add tomatoes to my jambalaya, so I iwl likely make that addition as well. Overall, nice and creative use of leftovers for me.

Not sure how to accurately rate this recipe. Flavor wise this was great. Presentation wise, not so much. For starters, this is very expensive to make. Secondly, this makes enough filling for 3 pies and that is before you even add the rice to the mix. On the rice note, mine sunk to the bottom of the crust and basically became part of the crust. Tasted good but looked horrible. Neither the top or the bottom crust held together once you cut into it. This would have been better made into individual pot pies and not one big pie for sharing. Or should I say 3 pies for sharing? No way no how can you get all of this filling into one nine inch pie. It is impossible. With all of that being said, the flavor is great.
