I made this recipe as stated...it turned out okay, not bad and not great. I do agree mixing the orzo and peas together(on your plate) makes for a better bite with the salmon. careful with adding the "whole lemon juice" to the orzo a bit much in my opinion. better off adding half and serving with a wedge.

I made the Orzo with chicken broth, cooked the peas with it, mixed in the bacon after, along with the lemon and butter.  This tasted even better the next day after the orzo soaked up the lemon flavor.  This is an exceptional meal, fast, easy,affordable.

We really liked this. Made it as instructed except I added a few grates of parmesan to the orzo. Good enough for company.

This was very simple and easy to make and had good flavor.  I had fresh spinach I needed to use to instead of the peas, I saut√©ed the spinach in a little butter and added it to the Orzo.  I will try it again with other vegetables.

This is a good dish, and I will definitely make it again. I substituted asparagus for the peas. The only change I will make will be to not add the salt to the bacon and vegetable. The bacon is salty enough!

This won 5 stars from my family! The lemon seasoned orzo pasta was perfect with the seasoned salmon. I used pancetta in the peas rather than bacon. I had it in my fridge and it was easier than chopping the bacon. The peas were delicious. Such a great  combo! No difficult prepping, everything cooked quickly and Sunday night dinner was wonderful.

I've already made it twice.  My family liked it and it was an easy dinner to make for guests (and it seemed more impressive).  I did add a vegetable bullion cube to the water for the orzo but I also like things a little saltier in general.  Otherwise this was great.  While it is more than one pan (my usual) it wasn't too bad for clean up either.  We will definitely have it as a regular dish at our house.

Didn't have frozen peas so used frozen mixed vegetables. Steamed them and then added to bacon. It didn't say if I was to drain the bacon or leave it in and add vegetables so I drained because grease like that is not good for veins.

The only thing that turned out alright was the peas.  The lemon overpowered the orzo and the salmon was bland.

This was absolutely delicious...even for a family of picky eaters. We don't eat pork, so the only substitution I made was for turkey bacon. It was amazing!

This was delicious! My husband and I loved the combination of salty and sweet/acidic from the lemon. I added the peas and bacon to the orzo as others suggested and used the juice from one small lemon. I used 1/2 the amount of garlic powder it called for and thought it was plenty. I will definitely make this again!

What a delightful salmon recipe with well balanced sides. I used 1 tsp of dried basil. I did not make the bacon. Made extra butter sauce accidentally with all the seasoning in it (overlooked the instructions) but was fine. All together I was very pleased with the results.

This was a simple dish and easy to put together. I've made some tweaks--instead of fresh basil, I've used dried. I've used frozen fish instead of fresh, lemon juice instead of a lemon, and wished I had enough sauce to go around. I would make it again.

I made the 2 sides with an Allrecipes recipe for scallops. They were both delicious. The bacon would work with so many vegetables-what a great idea.

I made this very nearly as written.  I didn‚Äôt have sea salt so I substituted kosher salt.  Also my husband and son aren‚Äôt nearly as fond of lemon as I am so I didn‚Äôt add the lemon juice over the top of the fish at the end.

I only cooked the salmon portion of the recipe but it was excellent! The only thing is that I washed my basil before I cut it and so when I mixed it with salt and garlic powder they turned into clumps like breadcrumbs so the salt didn‚Äôt spread well.  so next time I will apply the salt and garlic powder separately from the basil but other than that it was great!  Will make again!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for the amount of lemon juice that I added to the Orzo. I added the lemon juice a little at a time and tasted, I don't like too much of a lemon flavor, ended up using about 1 Tablespoon, it was the perfect amount for us.
