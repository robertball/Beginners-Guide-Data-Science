A friend gave me some pomegranates today so I used the seeds for this recipe. I also substituted balsamic vinegar,  white onions for the shallots and honey for the sugar. I blended it all in a Magic Bullet and you couldn't even tell the whole seeds were used. It was great!!!

Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of cutting the sugar in half (personal taste preference) which resulted in the perfect balance of sweet-tart for us.  Garnished salad with some fresh pomegranates, and I would make again.  Very nice dressing.

This is absolutely delicious! I didn't blend it because I didn't feel like it. It tastes amazing on lettuce with berries, goat cheese and chicken...love it. Thanks for sharing!

I used to have a fabulous pomegranate dressing recipe which I misplaced so I tried this as a replacement. To me, the proportions on this recipe aren't quite right. The vinegar was way too strong. I made the recipe as written, then made a lot of tweaks to get it the right taste for our family. My recommendations: Cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup and increase the pomegranate juice to 1-1/2 cups. (I reduced 2 cups pomegranate juice on the stove to about 1 cup reduction in a subsequent attempt at this recipe and liked it even better so you may play with the pomegranate juice.) I increased the shallot, garlic, and pepper and used about 2 tsp. salt. I've also tried replacing the sugar with honey and find I like that better as well. Thanks for the recipe, Mel. It's a good starter base for a good dressing.

Delicious salad dressing for the Rosh Hashanah meal. I added a few tablespoons of  fresh pomegranate seeds and used 4 Tbs honey instead of white sugar.

I decided to copycat Wendy's Apple Pecan Chicken Salad, which is amazing, and I used this recipe for the dressing. It's better than the dressing that comes in the packets with the Wendy's salad. It separates very quickly, so it's important to shake it every time. I love the tangy,  sweet sour vibe of this vinaigrette. And so easy!

This was good, but I felt like it was missing something. I might tweak it a bit next time.
