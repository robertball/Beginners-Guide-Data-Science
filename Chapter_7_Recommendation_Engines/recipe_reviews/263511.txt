I used a can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce to hopefully make it a little thicker. It turned out wonderful and will be made many more times.

Made this- it’s he best thing we’ve made in our Instant Pot since we got it! It is a bit soupy and I had reviewed the comments and was expecting the same. So when adding the coconut milk- I only added in the milk solids and not the water. Also added some cornstarch  at the end to thicken the liquid. Otherwise- loved it!! Will definitely make it again.

Turned out great, tastes like restaurant food!  Mine turned out darker/“browner” than others (maybe because I used too much tomato paste, as I followed that tip and did tomato paste instead of sauce) but it’s very good.  I also did 4 T. of curry powder, instead of 3.  Also, to make mine thicker and to have all the flavors blend more, I cooked the full can of coconut milk right in with the rest of the ingredients, rather than at the end.  I was a little concerned about under-cooking the chicken, especially since I had added the coconut milk, so I cooked longer-I used the POULTRY setting.   It turned out thick and perfectly cooked (meat thermometer tested over 165°).  Served over jasmine brown rice, made separately in the IP while my coconut chicken curry stayed warm on stovetop (extra IP stainless steel liner is key!), and with a side of steamed broccoli.  I added a little crushed red pepper (maybe 1/4 tsp.) before I put the lid on, because I think the recipe needed just a little kick.  I never experienced the “burn” or “error” message on the IP (as others expressed concern about), and I think that’s because I had plenty of liquid ingredients..  I would make again with less tomato paste (but still with paste instead of sauce).

Love the taste, I made the following modifications
 1 tbl extra of curry 
 1 tbl of Garam Masala
Used tomato paste not sauce
Used Coconut Cream (10 oz) not coconut milk
Before I added the coconut cream I used my immersion blender to blend up all the onions and garlic...Delicious!!!

Yum!  This turned out great!  I used large chicken breasts so I cooked for 20 minutes on high pressure.  I took the advice of others and used tomato paste in place of tomato sauce and also used just the solid portion of the coconut milk.  I think the sauce was a perfect consistency!  Definitely a keeper!

This is very thin, more like a soup, not even a stew.  I used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breasts, and a bit more than 2 pounds, because boneless skinless breasts are often so dry.  I served over rice in bowls.  Family liked the flavor.  Not too heavy on the spices.

The only change I made was to add a bit more curry to the chicken and it's delicious! Easy to make and it exceeded my expectations. This recipe is a bit soupy like others have  noted, but I like it just how it is. Will definitely be making this again.

Tomato paste for sure vs. sauce, but got two 'burn' notices on my Intstant Pot when cooking the chicken (which added 20 extra min as I had to release the pressure & stir).  I had to double+ the chicken broth to keep everything at the bottom from sticking/burning - and it cooked off (not too soupy).  Another option is to saute in a different pan and place the tomato paste/etc on top of the chicken with the broth on the bottom.  4 Tblsp of Curry Powder as well.  Kids loved it with rice!  Might add in some shrooms or green/red peppers next time.

Several posters suggested substituting tomato paste for tomato sauce, so I did. I don't think this is necessary so I will follow the recipe exactly next time. My only change might be to add a little more curry powder. Also, the recipe does not specify whether the chicken breasts should be on-the-bone or boneless skinless. I went with on-the-bone breasts, but trimmed off excess skin. When it came time to shred the meat, it came off the bone with ease. I think cooking it that way made it all the more flavorful.

I LOVED this dish and will make it again. I served this over brown rice. Everyone went back for seconds!

This is a great base recipe but should be labeled as a soup. IMO it needs some changes to be considered as an every day meal!! First, drain the diced tomatoes. Second, add 1 tablespoon corn starch. Third add tablespoon of teriyaki (or soy ). Per your taste add Sriracha sauce.. Still a bit soupy but if you make it a second time you can name according adjustments and enjoy!!

Family really REALLY liked it! I used a med spice curry and it had a nice kick . I also added peas and cut potatoes to thicken it up because it was a little watery. I do not own a pressure cooker, so I made the recipe as it stated but cooked the chicken in the pot, with the sauce for 25-30 minutes, then I took out the chicken, shredded it and put it back in the pot to cook with the coconut milk to soak in the flavors - yummy.

At the end I left it in sauté rather than the warm setting. This helped thicken it. I would suggest tomato paste instead of sauce. I agree with a prior review that it is missing something. It didn’t have the “bite” that I like with curry. More curry and ginger maybe? This is not an IP recipe but I prefer it.

This was very good. Was not sure what curry to use so I used the red curry paste and used three Tbs. Like I said we really enjoyed this served over Jasmin rice.
I will be making this again.

This was a welcome change to our weeknight meals. Made with .83 lbs chicken, increased the amount of sauce and broth. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of sauce. Topped with toasted coconut and served over noodles instead of rice. Very tasty.

This was great! I used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can crushed tomatoes because that’s all I had. I also added only the solid part of the coconut milk can and saved the coconut water underneath for smoothies. Mine turned out thick and rich and was delicious!

It was ok.  I would try a different recipe next time though.  I wish it had been more flavorful.  We added quartered new potatoes, upped the curry to 4 Tbsp, added a pinch of red pepper flakes, and it was still on the bland side, though pleasantly sweet with the coconut milk. Be sure to deglaze the pan after sautéing the onions and seasonings or you will get a "burn" message when putting it to pressure.  I used a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce, as it is soupy as written.  I served it over rice with steamed broccoli.

Delicious! I will definitely  make it again, however I will have to adjust the cook time.  My Instant Pot beeped , flashed "burn"  and then shut off before the 10 minute cooking time was over.  It was slightly burnt  to the bottom of the pot.

Enjoyed it!  Needs thicker sauce, so next time I'll include just the solid part of the coconut milk.  Also required a fair amount of extra salt at the end - the flavor needed to be perked up.  Ate over rice.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I served it over rice with a cucumber salad on the side.  I made a few changes: I used olive oil instead of coconut oil, added 1C of chicken broth instead of 1/2, used chicken thighs instead of breasts for a little extra flavor and cut them into strips which cut the cooking time down by about 10 minutes..  I also used 3 cloves of garlic, minced instead of chopped.  This is a definite keeper!

From the comment reading I edited a bit... ok... a lot lol! I did not use tomato paste or sauce. Instead I used the diced tomatoes and added a can of fresh pears. I also added green pepper and carrot at the sautee stage.  For seasonings I also used dried unsweetened coconut. Halved the sugar. I added half the can of milk during the cooking,  added 1/4 to the brown rice I made with it then added the last 1/4  in the final warm setting cook. The pears thickened it up nicely and sweetened what sugar reduction lost. Total yum!

I've made this recipe twice now and think it's delicious! A few small changes I made were adding a little garam masala, a pinch of red pepper flakes to spice it up, and about half a sweet potato (cubed). The sweet potato becomes completely mashed by the time it's done pressure cooking with the chicken, which I think helps thicken up the sauce a bit.

This is delish! I omitted the sugar, and added tomato paste instead of tomato sauce., because that's what I had on hand!
I skipped the poking the holes in the chicken step, and just threw the chicken in, and then added the rest of the curry powder. 
The sauce was divine.  I served over Jasmine rice.

We loved this dish!  I'm always looking for recipes that I can tweak to make them even healthier, and this one was perfect.  I omitted the sugar and used stir fried cauliflower rice rather than basmati or brown rice.  It was delicious and even better the next day. I will definitely make it again!

This was a pretty good dish. I personally love the coconut flavor it has. The family had mixed reviews. They called it bland and added a lot of salt and sriracha to it!

Turned out great! I added just a little less than half a can of coconut milk. It made lots of sauce. The only thing I added was a few shakes of cayenne pepper for some heat. I cut it more in chunks instead of shredding. The whole family liked it. I'll definitely make this one again.

I turned it into a vegetarian dish  by substituting tofu and vegetables for the chicken.  I set the pressure cook time to zero and then ended up manually cancelling the pressure cook cycle before it actually hit the pressure cook zone.  The vegetables were still a little on the firm side, which I love.  I ladled the curry mixture of sauce, vegetables and tofu over some delicious brown rice.  Absolutely delicious.  Will make again.

The first time, I followed the recipe to the letter, save for discarding the liquid from the coconut milk. It turned out delicious, but completely watery, which I don't like. I had to add a lot of corn starch. But it tasted very good. This time around, I used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. I am in my fifth "burn" notice, and this dish is taking over an hour to cook (loss of pressure, rebuilding of pressure, etc). I'm still at it.
I will make it again, but with sauce, and lots of corn starch instead.

I found it delicious, because it wasn't very spicy.  Boyfriend found it good, but bland.  I got the dreaded "burn" notice from my InstantPot 3 times during cooking, resulting in pressure release, adding more water, and restarting.  This must be why the recipe calls for tomato sauce and not tomato paste ( which is what I used, following the advice of others).  I'd like to make it again but aim for a richer, deeper curry flavor.  I served over steamed rice.

Loved the taste. Mine turned about a little watery...I think my chicken breasts were a little frozen in the middle.  But- still tasted great. Next time I may add a little more curry because I love the taste.  I served it with basmati rice.

My husband LOVED it so I will give 4 stars from his opinion. I was not a big fan, but I am more of a picky eater. Very unique taste and not nearly as spicy as I expected. I served it over jasmine rice.

This was ok...I feel it needs something to give it more flavor. Next time I will marinate the chicken first and maybe sauté it before I add the sauce etc. It was a very mild curry flavor so I would recommend increasing the curry powder as well. 
Not the worst recipe I’ve had, but definitely needs something extra.

So good! I used an instant pot and followed the recipe exactly. I would agree it was a little soupy but I stirred in rice and billed it as a “stew” and it was a huge hit! Will definitely make again. I added in a bit of cayenne pepper at the end because we like spice and it was perfect.

Loved this!  Based on the other reviews I did use 1 small can of tomato paste instead of the can of tomato sauce.  I let it simmer after cooking on the stove so that I could make brown rice in the Instant Pot.  I will definitely be making this regularly.

This was extremely easy to make and tasted great! I didn't have coconut milk on hand, so I substituted a can of evaporated milk. I definitely will try it with coconut milk soon, too.  I found this to be much simpler than other curries I make with a similar outcome in taste! I did also add a cornstarch slurry at the end to thicken the sauce a bit.  Served it over brown basmati rice (also made in a pressure cooker) with naan on the side. My 5 kids all ate it up! I will be adding this to my regular rotation.

Really enjoyed this meal. Had to used crushed tomatoes since somehow we were out of diced, so I cut out the chicken broth. It was delicious. The sauce consistency was good until you add the coconut milk, so I may add cream next time to see if it is thicker.

This was a little bit soupy for my preferences, but the flavor was good! I used frozen chicken breasts and it still turned out, which is a major plus in my book.
