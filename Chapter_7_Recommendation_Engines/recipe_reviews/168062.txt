Ok...I know that it sounds like an odd recipe, but give it a chance.  My son is taking a "home ec" class and had to find a recipe to prepare on his own for his family.  He chose this one, and I was skeptical to say the least.  Long story short...it was fabulous.  He prepared it exactly as written, no additions or alterations.  And if an 8th grader can make it, so can you!  We ate it all, no leftovers.  And my son got an "A"!

These were really good.  They taste like comfort food, but are really quite healthy.  My only complaint is that they were a bit bland.  They had good heat due to the cayenne, but were laking in something.  Next time I will use garlic & onion diced tomatoes rather than plain. These will likely become a regular at our house.

Strange, but in a good way.

Yummy!  I substituted Special K for Rice Crispies.  It's what I had on hand and I always call it Rice Crispies for grownups anyway!
