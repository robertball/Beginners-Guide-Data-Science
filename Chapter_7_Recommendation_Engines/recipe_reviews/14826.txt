This recipe is good if you use 1lb. of Jimmy Dean sausage, 2 cups of Bisquick, and 2 cups of sharp cheddar.  We have been making these for years and they are so good.  We always have water on hand and add a little at a time just to make it easier to mix.  Makes all the difference in the world.

You should absolutely pre-cook the sausage.  That way, you can drain the sausage and get rid of a lot of the grease.  The mix it in with the cheese and Bisquick, and bake until golden brown.  This is an easy, tasty appetizer that freezes well, so all you have to do is thaw them and pop them in the oven (or microwave, but oven is better) to warm them up.  I do suggest using hot sausage, or a mixture of hot and sweet, because mild sausage makes them a little bland.

There is way too much baking mix in this recipe.  After I used it my mom told me she only uses 3/4 cup per pound of sausage for hers.  I couldn't even get most of mine to absorb.

We have used this recipe for years and just love it. We always use Jimmy Dean Sauage, and Sharp Shredded Cheese, and sometimes we will put in a bit of parmesan. If it is too dry we add a few drops of water. The JD Sausage has very little fat compared to most brands and we do not precook it. Its a Christmas Eve tradition in our house, have probably been making it for 20 years. Highly recommend it :)

This recipe made as listed is a disaster, only when you modify it does it become something good. 4 cups Sharp cheddar cheese, 1 pound of sage saugage, 1 pound of hot sausage and 2 cups of baking mix will give you the best sausage cheeseball you've ever tried.  And don't forget to mix VERY well.

These are exactly what sausage balls should be.  They should be on the dry side, with crispy oozing cheese.  I made mine exactly per the recipe with sharp cheddar cheese.  If you want your sausage balls to look like meat balls, this is not the recipe for you.  These are true southern goodness.  I had to pack my ingredients together and room temperature sausage is a must.

I don't know what this recipe is like as written because I followed the advice of the other reviewers.  I used 1 lb sage sausage, 1 lb hot sausage, 3 c. sharp cheddar, and 1-1/2 c. baking mix, and they were very good.  I used the dough hook on my stand mixer, sprayed my foil with non-stick spray, and drained them on a paper towel - all great suggestions.  I don't cook/eat greasy meat like this, but I was having a brunch and needed something to go with the Baked Omelet Squares (another fabulous allrecipe recipe).  I tried a sausage ball before the brunch and couldn't believe how good they were.  I'm giving this recipe 3 stars, but what came out of my oven (with the changes) was much better than that.

After these were made, my boyfriend and I did not really like them.  They were very dry and I thought the recipe called for too much baking mix.  One of the other reviews said they were much better the next day so I waited to post my review.  They are a lot better!  I microwaved them to heat them up and could actually taste sausage and cheese this time.  I would suggest if you're going to make these, to make them the day before serving and just reheat.

As others have said, the baking mix needs to be cut to prevent the sausage balls from being too dry. I used a cup and a half of Bisquick-- I bought one of their smallest packages and just used the whole thing.  I also used one pound of Jimmy Dean Sage sausage, two cups of mixed cheddar and monterey jack cheese, and I decided to add a half cup of milk to ease the mixing process and just a little worcestershire sauce for flavor.  I browned the sausage in a skillet first, then mixed it with everything else in a bowl.  I then formed it into balls and baked on a foil-lined, greased cookie sheet at 400 degrees for 14 minutes.  They turned out wonderfully.  I brought them to a party and not one was left; everyone complimented me for them.  They make great appetizers! I am a beginner at cooking, but they weren't difficult at all.   *****EDITING TO ADD***** I know some people have said to not cook the sausage first, but I still do it that way and still can't take them anywhere without being asked for the recipe. This is my go-to appetizer when asked to bring something to a gathering. Instead of fully draining the grease, I add a little into the mixture with a little milk as stated before, and that prevents them from being dry. I use Jimmy Dean hot sausage now instead of sage; it gives it better flavor.

Geez Guys! I was in a hurry and trusted your 4 star rating without reading the reviews. My bad!!!!! Please rate the recipe as written! I wasted time and money on this one and had to come up with something else last minute to take to my party. As this recipe is written, it is a TOTAL disaster. You only taste the baking mix -

Wait! Don't trash this recipe like others have. It's a tried and true sausage ball. Try letting your sausage warm up to close to room temp. before mixing it. It makes the sausage easier to work with and allows it to absorb the other ingredients. Will still take a while to mix everything completely. Hope this helps!

Used the baking mix recipe from this site, which I whizzed up in my food processor. Since the whizzer was already in use, I just threw the sausage in with the baking mix and whizzed it. I left out the cheese because we didn't have any - added an egg to make up for it. They came out PERFECTLY. I expected a ton of grease on the pan, and there was none. My kids LOVED them - my son loved his dipped in ranch and I really liked them dipped in melted raspberry jam. My 1 year old just liked them and walked around eating them all day.

Since before I was born, these sausage balls have been a Christmas tradition for my family.  I took over the tradition officially when I was about 10 and have been making them ever since, in fact I just took a batch out a few minutes ago! 

For a more flavorful sausage ball I always use hot sausage and extra sharp cheddar cheese.  So good!

Loved the taste of these!  I gave this 4 stars because I think I need to tinker with this one a little bit.  I followed another reviewer's advice to only use half of the baking mix but I think I might use 2 cups next time.  I baked these in the oven, then put them into a crockpot to keep warm for our guests.  Worked well except they melted into each other and stuck together.  I baked one batch on parchment paper and the other on foil and the parchment paper was definitely the way to go - no sticking.  I'll keep working on this in time to serve over the holidays, they have such a great flavor!

Wow these are tasty.  BIG HINT!  USE YOUR BLENDER WITH A DOUGH HOOK!!!  I used 1 1/2 cups bisquick and 3 cups cheese, on other suggestions.  Just throw it in the blender, and use a mellon baller to make portions easy. I cooked mine on a stone and let them drain on paper towels for a few seconds after taking them out of the oven.  Again, thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Absolutely wonderful.  This appetizer is very quick and easy to make.  Everyone just loved them.  I doubled up on the sausage as well and used Italian sausage instead.  They taste great with a dipping sause such as pizza sauce.

I made these sausage balls for my husband's poker party and the guys loved them! I baked them earlier in the day and then heated them in a crock pot. After reading other reviews, I used 3 lbs. sausage, (2 regular, 1 hot) 3c Bisquick, and 6c of cheese. They turned out great! Be sure to spray non-stick cooking spray on the foil prior to cooking.

I made these for a Thanksgiving appetizer and they tasted terrific. I added a few dashes of tabasco, some Italian Seasoning, and used low fat Bisquick.. It is really important to mix these thoroughly. If you keep mixing, the heat from your hands will help draw out some of the fat from the sausage, which will allow the mixing in of the baking mix and the cheese. Mine turned out just fine. Don't skip on the aluminum foil step. I sprayed mine with cooking spray and had only a little trouble with sticking.

I made these over the holiday and they were just a great finger food. I put in fresh basil and parsley for 1/2 of the batch. These are addicting, you can't eat just one. I used very fine cheddar cheese and this made it easier to work with. You have to really work the dough for it to hold but it cooks up great. Make sure that you form small balls when making. I froze part of the batch after baking and will just heat them up and serve as needed.

Three stars for the recipe as written. Cut the baking mix in half and the world is good, 5 stars adapted! Also,after many times of peeling these off of the foil or scraping them off the bakeing sheet, have found that puting parchment paper down  helps a lot and they come right up!

This is how my mother always made them (I think with half the cheese, but that part isn't critical).  The trick is that you have to use your hands to mix them, so all the Bisquick is absorbed by the sausage and cheese.  They are supposed to be a very firm dough.  If you use less Bisquick, they will flatten out and not be balls.

This is simply the best recipe for these guys, they are always a huge hit during holiday times.  The great thing about them is you can use whatever sausage or cheese you like and they'll turn out great.  My favorite is sage sausage with sharp cheddar and peper jack cheese.  Try em!

These are SUPER easy and really good.  If you think there is too much baking mix, simply use a cookie sheet to mix all the ingredients together, the pound it out into a thin layer and it should be moist again to absorb more mix.  I usually do this about 5 times and it soaks up all the mix and the kneading of the sausage helps soften it up also.

Great for parties, serve with a mustard dipping sauce and put toothpicks with them!

I've made these for over 30 years and for what it's worth add some a medium diced onion (very very small dice) and a bit of chile or chipolte powder (I like spicy). I agree with others that the correct ratio is 1 sausage to 1 1/2 baking mix and 2 cups cheese. Use extra sharp chedder and hot sausage. I've given the recipe to so many people over the years I've lost count.

These are a long time favorite and have been around for ever. This is an easy thing to put together for Christmas morning and is delicious served with apple butter on the side. One tip I've learned over the years: in order to avoid having this all over my hands I actually put all the ingredients into a gallon ziploc bag and knead it together. It takes a long time to get the ingredients incorporated and you can't knead it too long. Make sure you combine the ingredients really really well before you start rolling them into balls. They will be greasy but that holds them together. Also, I bake them on parchment paper because they will stick to your pan, even if you spray with cooking spray! But we love them and they freeze well after they are baked for breakfast on the go later. Love it!

I use this recipe all the time!!! I cut the baking mix down by about 1/4 cup, as I like my balls a little meatier.  My boyfriend and roommates can't get enough of these.  Also, I dipped them in maple syrup and it was AMAZING.  I might figure out some sort of maple flavored dip.

I followed the 2lbs sausage ( Jimmy Dean - one Hot and one Sage) with 3 C shredded sharp cheddar and 1 1/2 c Bisquick. Have not even made it to the party yet and they are almost gone! 12-13 min cook time gives you that delicious crispy oozy cheese!

Simply amazing, and simple to make. I use this recipe frequently when I'm asked to bring appetizers to a get-together. Instead of using three cups of Bisquick per pound of sausage, I used one cup, and it came out beautifully. I've been asked to make this recipe again and again. It's a great one to keep on hand in case of emergency!

These were delicious!! Not as "sausagey" as others I have made, which is what I was looking for. Also, I made half a recipe and ended up with 30 (fairly large) balls! Don't know how that happened, but I was glad later when they were all gone.

This recipe as listed is not a good one. The BEST recipe for this is 2 packages hot ground sausage (or 1 hot/1 regular italian sausage), 1 package large shredded cheddar cheese and 2 cups bisquick, 20 min at 400 degrees. THEN they will be perfect!

I wish I'd read the reviews before I made this. I made it as written and, yep, there is way too much baking mix; I should have cut it by half at least. They were ok but very dry, and not terribly flavorful. If I were to make them again I would add some garlic powder and Italian herbs. I think they would be good with marinara sauce too.

I'LL GIVE 2 STARS because this recipe has the right basic (but bland) ingredients, but amounts and seasonings are way off.  BEWARE folks - this recipe is only 1/3 right!  A recipe rating is supposed to be for the recipe as IT is written, maybe w/some MINOR personal changes!    I should have read the reviews before preparing, but with the four stars, I thought it would be a SOMEWHAT safe bet.  WHOA!  You reviewers that are changing the recipe SO much, yet giving it 5 stars, should submit your own winners - they are GREAT, those are the recipes that deserve 4-star ratings!!

First time I made them with only the 1 package of sausage.  Works so much better and not as dry if you use 2 pounds of Sausage.  These are great.

I have been making these sausage balls with Bisquick since I was 27 years old, and I am now almost 55!  When I was first married,  my husband's grandmother taught me how to make these.  It was a little different, and they were better to my way of thinking, so I will share!  
She used 2 pounds of bulk Italian Sausage.  1 pound hot, 1 pound mild.   2 1/2  cups Bisquick.  4 cups shredded Cheddar Cheese.   And Water.  
You remove the casings off the sausages and mix it up well, then you cook it until no pink shows.  You then drain it well on several paper towels.  Also, put towels on the top to soak up the grease.  When the sausage is well drained you can then add the Bisquick.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP!  If it is dry then you may add a few drops of water at a time until it is damp. 
You may then add all of the cheese now and mix very well.  After mixing well, cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or overnight.  
You then take you the meat/Bisquick/cheese mixture out of the refrigerator and set your oven to preheat at 400* 
You next take a cookie sheet out and cover it with foil and spray with Pam.  Then take a small ice cream scooper and scoop out your mixture, and put it 1 1/2" from each other on your sheet.  
Bake at 400* for 12 to 15 minutes until they are browned slightly.  They will need to cool a little before you taste test them or you will burn your mouth!  They taste so good! 
Let them cool completely before you freeze them if they last that long!  I just put them

I made it like this: 1 pound of SAGE or HOT Jimmy Dean sausage (Regular works too but it is not as good, and the Italian tastes like pizza rolls)

1 pound of shredded SHARP cheddar cheese

2 cups of Bisquick

It makes about 80 1-1.5 inch diameter balls ("walnut-sized") and they are soOoOoO delicious.

I used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar. Delicious! Also I baked them on a wire rack - no sticking and no grease.

Like all the other comments, I cut back on the bisquick and cheese.  Made this for a main dish, but was kind of rich.  Would be better as an appetizer.

With all the different reviews of how much of each ingredient to use... I just "guesstimated" amounts untill it looked right.

 I used 3 cups of shredded cheddar, 1 pound of sage sausage, 1 pound of bulk italian sausage, and approximately 3 cups of baking mix. I also used 1 32oz jar of sauerkraut, rinsed, drained, and excess liquid squeezed out. 

I used an ice cream scoop to make the balls, and put them on a foil-lined cookie sheet. I'd advise using non-stick spray on your foil, as they stuck rather badly. I baked for 15-18 minutes at 400.

My husband was leery of how they would turn out, but he loves them, as do my 4 yr old and 6 yr old. Will DEFINITELY make them again soon!

I cooked my sausage with some sweet onion.  Had to add some milk to bring it all together.  Used a cookie scoop to put on the silpat....they were delicious.  Didn't know it was so easy....thank you

Always anticipated by the men and children in my family at the holidays. The best tip to avoid sticking and drain some of the grease is to crumple a piece of foil (heavy duty works best), stretch it out a little, leaving some texture in it. Spray lightly with cooking spray. The grease drains off into the nooks and crannies, and you can simply pick them off with tongs. I cut back on the baking mix to a little over 3 cups. I like JD sage sausage and mix a little cajun seasoning in the baking mix before adding the other stuff. Honey mustard makes a great dip for these.

I used this recipe as a base, and added the same amount of cheese and soy sausage but a little less baking mix.  They turned out WONDERFUL, and even my meat eater husband loved them!

Biscuit-mix sausage cheese balls are one of our family favorites for breakfast gatherings and holidays.  I've found that this recipe will vary depending on where you live.  Baking at higher altitudes, in general, calls for reducing the fat in recipes, increasing the flour (or biscuit mix), and adding a little liquid.  So, living in Denver, I cook and drain the sausage, and add 3/4 cup water as I'm mixing everything together.  I bake them at 450 degrees for 10-12 minutes.  You may need to experiment with this recipe a couple of times to get the balance of ingredients just right for your location and your family's preferences.  All the oooh's and ahhh's you'll get will be worth it!

I'm glad I did a little research before following this recipe. The majority of similar recipes I saw called for 2 pounds of sausage to 1 1/2 cups of baking mix. As written, this would be VERY dry. I made them (using 32 oz sausage and 1 1/2 cups baking mix) for an anniversary party that I did lots of finger foods for. Several people asked me for the recipe. I have a hard time quitting once I start eating these.

These are good, but I didn't know whether to cook the sausage before putting them into the balls.  I cooked it a bit, then crumbled them up into the Bisquick.

We have made this one every Christmas for years. We have them out every Christmas brunch, usually in a crockpot set on low.  They go fast, so make a lot!  We also tried adding crumbled bacon one year, and that was also a hit.

Something different and really good! I mixed one regular ground sausage with one hot ground sausage-- more than the requested pound on the recipe. I got many compliments on these as well as the other recipes. People at Easter Dinner were so filled up by all the great appetizers I made that no one touched the main Easter dish my mom made!

With changes recommended by other reviewers, this was a 5 STAR RECIPE!!! Ingredients: 2lbs  COOKED sausage (I used 1lb Sage and 1lb Hot) 1.5 cups baking mix, and 3 cups cheese.

I didn't use foil, just my non-stick cookie sheet. This recipe makes just enough balls to fill up my 9x13 casserole for transport. I made beer cheese dipping sauce and it was the party favorite. Next time, I might try all hot sausage or a mix of hot and italian to pump up the flavor. There will definitely be a next time!

l have made these forever ... l would also like to say l am a professional cook, that being said, for each pound of sausage of your liking, uncooked add about 1.5 cups of shredded cheddar cheese and no more than 1 cup of  bisquick. Make balls about 1" bake 350 for 10 - 15 minutes.

I made this recipe today using the ingredients as listed and they turned out great. The secret is to use room temperature hot Jimmy Dean Sausage and room temperature finely grated sharp cheddar cheese. I use a large bowl so I can really mix it and squeeze the ingredients together.

For those who say there is way too much baking mix in this recipe and they could not incorporate it, I had the same problem.  I added some milk so the mix would not be so dry and I could incorporate it in with the sausage and cheese.  It gave more of a biscuit quality to the sausage cheese balls, which was ok with me as an appetizer. Everyone ate them without any complaints; none were left.  If you don't want to add milk, you just have to work more at smashing all the dough into balls, they will have a rather dry feel to them but the cheese will melt and make up for it.

Yums. Lot less baking mix though. I only used about 1 1/2 - 2 cups of baking mix. But i could see using less cheese as well. 4 cups is an awful lot.

I love this recipe but I add my own ingredients. I add one jalapeno, finely chopped yellow onion, and some finely chopped red bell pepper. It gives the sausage balls intense flavor that my family and friends crave.

Taste was ok but think the baking mix could go down to 2 cups.  I doubled the sausage and it was still too 'doughy' for us.

This recipe is too dry - it should have twice as much sausage (like other recipes I've seen online). The mix was too dry to stick together, and the balls baked up dry and crumbly. For the second bath, we doubled the sausage and they were perfect.

I did it exactly per the recipe and had a lot of trouble making it stick together.  So I had two different types of sausage balls because I had to add water to get the rest of the bowl to form balls. It was very good both ways.  This is a very versatile recipe.

These were really good. I took the tip of another reviewer, to crinkle tin foil for the grease to drip in  to, but there was no need! No Grease! I added chopped fresh rosemary and sage, and cut the ingredients in half. 1/2 lb sausage, 1 c bisquick mix, 1 cup cheddar. these turned out really great

My family and I love these! I make them every year at the holidays. I usually add a drop or two of milk to keep them from being too stiff. I use hot sausage and sharp cheddar cheese. I usually use Jimmy Dean sausage. I've never had any compaints on these.

Yeah, cut the biscuit mix down to half. I do two pounds of hot breakfast sausage. I use sharp cheese and add 2 diced Jalapenos. Nice kick with the peppers and hot sausage. I did use 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 velveeta once, all I had. Just as good, and maybe a bit better.

I added 2 lb of sausage and kept the other stuff the same.  They were okay, but not exactly what I was expecting.  Also, I found them a bit bland, they definately need something else...I don't think I will make them again.

These were delicious!  I took the advice of another person and didn't use as much baking mix.  I used about 1 1/2 - 2 cups instead.  Also, mine stuck to the foil so next time I will lightly spray with cooking spray before baking.  I served these at a wine and appetizer party and they were the first appetizer gone!

Don't give up on this if you think the mixing is too difficult.  I put the ingrediants in my food processor (with the metal blade) and it was beautifully mixed in minutes...try it!

I believe either the sausage amount or the baking mix amount is incorrect. Mine turned out very dry.
Could have been better with maybe reducing baking mix to 1-1/2 cups for 1 lb of sausage OR Using 2lbs of sausage with the 3 cups of baking mix.
I may try to adjust it and see what happens.

I followed some other reviews changes. I did 2 lbs sausage, 2 cups cheese, and 2 cups Bisquick. For the sausage, I used 1 lb of hot Jimmy Dean's and 1lb of sage. I didn't precook the sausage, and they came out great.

So easy to make.  Nice quick appetizer.  Be sure the balls aren't too big or you will have to bake them quite a bit longer like I did.  Lesson learned.  Thank you.

I've been making this for several years by the recipe. I've recently started using the baking mix recipe on this site. I always shred my own cheese and use gwaltney mild sausage. I let my kitchenaid do the mixing, bake as instructed and never have any leftovers.

Tastes amazing!!  1. The key to this recipe is to grate your own cheese.  The fresh cheddar cheese has oils in it that give the sausage balls moisture. 2. The other key is to make sure you mix the baking mix into the sausage BEFORE adding the cheese or the mix coats the cheese.  There is not too much mix for this recipe, just be patient when incorporating.  Use your hands and squeeze and twist.  3. The last thing, just don't overcook.  We used a kitchen thermometer to test ours until they came out perfect temp and now we know how many minutes.

As others have noted, this recipe yields a very dry product. It was close to impossible to get all of the baking mix incorporated into the dough. But bullheadedness and/or perseverance came to my rescue. I don't think the ratios are as off as some have stated. I do agree with the person who said that these sausage balls were better the next day. Hot out of the oven, they had little flavor. But I tried one later in the evening and was quite impressed! I think I will try making these again with one simple adjustment. I will reduce the baking mix by a half cup. Anything more and you may as well make a meatball. These should be more like a hush puppy. Reluctantly, I give these a 4 star. They probably deserve a 3 star. One last thing. I think They would also benefit from some chopped scallion and/or roasted chiles.

I agree with everyone else. WAY to much baking mix in this recipe. I had to send my husband to the store for more sausage so this mixture didn't go to waste.

Should have read the reviews first. The proportions of the recipe are WAY off. I followed it exactly and had a TON of baking mix and cheese left over. Added a second pound of sausage to it, still didn't use up all the mix. Probably get a way with 1 cup of mix and 1-2 cups of cheese to the 1lb of sausage.

Only gave 4 stars because I modified the recipe after reading some reviews. I used mild sausage only 1 1/2 C bisquick, and 2 C of cheese. I also added Tabasco sauce for a little more flavor. I don't like anything hot flavored & these were not hot at all... just perfect!

The reason there is so much more Bisquick in this recipe is because the sausage is not precooked.  I don't precook mine either.  The sausage ball is very moist. If you precook your sausage, then you should cut back on the Bisquick or they will be dry.  I get rave reveiws on my Sausage balls.  I also premelt my cheese before adding to make it all squoosh together good.

i used 2 pounds of sausage and 3 cups of baking mix and lots of cheese and added a packet of ranch. i mixed it very well it took a few minutes but it did mix all up without adding water u just have to be patient. the sausage i use is owens because it does have a little grease which keeps it from being so dry

Great and EASY recipe. I cut out at least a half a cup of the baking mix and add extra cheese and sausage, but that's just a preference. We love dipping them in pizza sauce!!

These are always a hit at parties. Never tried them for breakfast! I serve them with a dipping sauce made of mustard and sour cream. They disappear!

I have made thousands using this recipe over the past 20 years....The only think I do differently is use 2 cups of cheese and I melt it before I mix it together. The oils in the cheese make it stick together a lot easier ,and they're not dry.

I've made these for a long time, but mine is just a little different.  I use 16 oz. of cheese, HOT sausage, and 1/4 c. diced jalapenos (I like it a little spicy).  You also need to add a little water to it so it's not so dry.

These were really good.  My boyfriend loved them.  The only thing I might change is a little less bisquick.  They seemed just a bit dry for me.

I have mades these about 4 times in the last 2 months. We make them and put them into tupperare and they are our "snacky" food. I make mine with lean sausage, 2% cheddar and Carbquick Baking Mix and they are FANTASTIC! The entire family loves them and they aren't bad for protein either!:)

These were pretty good, however I had to make several changes. I only made a half recipe, as I only had 2 cups of shredded cheese. To that I added about 1/4 cup of milk, as the mix was too dry without it.  Also I increased the cooking time to 18 minutes, turning them halfway through. With those two changes these make a great breakfast food or snack for Game Day, but as written, only three stars.

I have been using this EXACT recipe for alomst 20 yrs. EVERYONE who has tried them has since called for the recipe  to make them themselves. It is difficult to mix but the product is well worth it. This is the best recipe for sausage cheese balls and I have never heard of complaints except when my aunt made them using a different recipe then called me for this recipe. She has had no problems since switching to this recipe. They are fabulous!!!!!

way too much baking mix!  I ended up using this recipe but with 2 lb of sausage.  Turned out fine!   I wish I would have made them smaller balls though.

Mmmm, mmmm good.  These are great for breakfast or anytime.  They disappear at parties so if you entertain with them make LOTS of them!  No need to alter the recipe.  I recommend that you use your favorite lean sage sausage & sharp cheddar for the best flavor.   I use a butter scoop and usually get about 60 out of the 1/4/3 recipe that is posted. Enjoy!  We do!  Thanks for the recipe.

I make these for almost every family gathering. They are easy to make and everyone loves them.  The mix will seem very dry at first, but as you keep working it together with your hands, it will come together nicely.  I usually make extra and freeze them before cooking to have on hand for a quick appetizer.

I tried to follow the recipe to the letter because I, too, am used to the dry southern type.  I only had 2 cups of Bisquick, though.  They still turned out to be delicious!!  I got lots of compliments on them, even from one of my pickiest friends!  Delicious!

These are SO good!  They are very easy to make, as long as you use your hands to mix them up.  I used a lot less Bisquick, though.  1 cup to 1 lb. of sausage, then 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I also added a bit of milk for consistency, a little onion powder and a little garlic powder for flavor.  My husband bragged on these at our party all day!

I made this recipe using Bisquick, 1 pound of mild sausage, and 1 pound of Colby-Jack cheese.  At first there wasn't enough moisture in the mix so I added a bit of water as I was kneading the dough.  I flattened out the dough by hand, added cooked sausage, and topped with shredded cheese, then begain rolling it all together until well distributed throughout.  I baked half of the balls, and froze the rest.  I have to agree that perhaps sharp cheddar would have been better, and also a medium-hot sausage for more flavor. At any rate, it was still VERY GOOD!

Wonderful recipe. I use a bit of water to help the mixture combine. Dont worry it doesnt change a think while baking. Use a good brand of sausage so there is less grease. Use a hot sausage for better flavor.

I thought these were excellent! - They are like mini cheese/sausage biscuits. I added about a tbsp of onion powder to the mixture to help with flavor.  I only added 1/4 cup of milk to help it stick together as suggested but probably could have done without it.  I put the sausage into the bowel with the bisquick and finely shredded cheese while it was still hot (you must cook the sausage first) - this helped soften the cheese and make it easier to form into balls.  10 minutes in my oven at 400 degrees made them perfectly brown.

Thanks to all who gave advice on this recipe.  I never had these before, but they were pretty good.  I offer this advice.  Only use 1-1/2-2 cups of Bisquick.  When mixing, add a little water to help all the ingredients stick.  Add a little PAM on a foil lined pan, and MOST IMPORTANT-Turn over the sausage so that it does not stick and please cook for 20 minutes so that it is thoroughly done.  This was OK, but I will try another version in the future.

This recipe as it is is terrible. If you make it as the recipe calls, it is so dry the ingredients won't blend. At all! I added milk in order to to blend the ingredients. I also added diced onions and garlic salt for extra flavor. I added 1/2 cup milk and a handful of diced onions. I should have added more cheese as it is sort of dry and crumbly. I also recommend spraing your foil with some cooking spray or they will stick. The balls are delicious and even better when you zap them in the microwave. It almost brings out more flavor. My two year and eleven year old both LOVE these! Hope this helps!

Not much flavor. I did what other reviewers said to do and did half of the baking mix. I just wanted something with a little more kick and not so dry. Good news is that my MOPS group ate it up.

These were delicious!  I used hot sausage and reduced fat cheddar along with bisquick.  I don't measure anything, just kind of eyeball it but they were absolutely perfect!  Thanks so much, our new favorite!!

I halved this recipe, as I was looking for a way to use up a half pound of sausage I already had.  I like sweet and savory though, so I added a little maple extract and brown sugar.  I also thought the mix was very dry so I used a splash of milk to moisten things up a little. Served them up for breakfast instead of an appetizer with some scrambled eggs. Very good end result!

This recipe was easy and great. I used a mixer to combine 2 pounds of sausage, 3 cups of cheese, 1 cup of baking mix, and about 2-3 tablespoons of hot pepper sauce (ex. Tabasco).

Using my heavy stand mixer and the dough hook mixing was easy. I have tried many recipes for sausage balls that have came out looking like sausage cookies. These were very tasty and maintained the ball shape while baking.

we served these for Thanksgiving with family and at our first annual christmas party. They were a hit! I did follow the advice of other posters and modified the recipe. I used 2 pounds HOT sausage, 1 cup bisquick and 2 cups sharp cheddar.

I made these for a ladies brunch and they were a hit.  I followed the recipe and added a tablespoon of maple syrup, rolled them into balls and froze them until I needed them.  I drizzled with a small amount fo warm maple syrup once I transfered them to the serving platter.

This was a very good recipe. YES, it takes some time to mix..........roll up your sleeves and mix with your hands....it's the easiest way to do it.
I did increase the sausage to 1 1/2 LB and only had 2 1/2 cups of baking mix. Used homemade venison sausage with lots of spices!
Great to have made ahead of time and pop in the microwave as we are headed out the door!  Thanks for a great recipe

these were disappointing; made exactly according to recipe, and they were dry and very low on flavor.  Will probably not make these again.

Stick to the proportions and resist adding anything extra. My box of Bisquick was a little more than 3 cups, so I dumped it all in. As a result, I ended up needing to moisten it with a little milk. It wasn’t a big deal, but the final product ended up being a little dry. It was my fault.

This recipe is a disaster! I haven’t even tried them yet, only put them in the oven. There is WAY too much baking mix or something because the balls wouldn’t even form correctly. I would suggest using one of the alternates listed in the comments. DO NOT USE THE AMOUNTS LISTED!

My grandmother, mother, and me have been making this recipe for decades. It’s absolutely perfect the way it is- but- the recipe should mention that combining the ingredients and kneading the dough take some time, probably about 20 minutes. You MUST make sure that the ingredients are totally combined with almost no baking mix or cheese left at the bottom of the bowl. If you roll the balls a small walnut size and bake about 12-13 minutes they will be perfectly cooked! Set on paper towels after removing from the baking sheet to drain some of the grease. I use Jimmy Dean hot sausage and they are perfect every time!!

1 lb Jimmy Dean original sausage(don’t pre-cook),
1 cup baking mix,
2 cups cheese,
Garlic powder and
Dried minced onion.
THIS is best combination.  You have to use equal parts of baking mix and sausage or they will be really cakey and dry.

I followed the recipe and the sausage balls were too dry and they burned on the bottom after 12 
minutes. I think it calls for too much baking mix and cheese. Also, the temperature is too high. Very 
disappointed.

This was a very dry recipe.  it needed some wet ingredient, the temp was too high and the time too short.  I wasted good ingredients time and effort and the recipe does not work and the sausage balls tasted terrible.   maybe reduce the flour to 2 cups not sure just didn't work.

I lost my MIL's recipe and decided to try this one.  I was shocked at how  dry the mixture was when I started. I ended up not using half of the baking mix called for because the mixture was so dry. Even then, it was hard to shape balls that would hold together. I also needed to bake them longer. I used Bob Evans, my preferred sausage, and have had great results in the past. I think  I will try another recipe in the future as I cannot think of how to improve the measurements and ingredients. In the end, there was no sausage or cheese flavor, just baking mix

Agreeing with all the reviews that say too much Bisquick. I too made the recipe before I read the reviews and was embarrassed to bring dry dough balls to my friends party.  Very high rating but no one made the actual recipe.  What good do the ratings do when no one has followed the directions???

Made these with my deer sausage which is much leaner so no grease.  Few tips that enhance the flavor:
Let the sausage reach room temperature, use only 2 cups of baking mix and use sharp cheddar and add some Parmesan cheese as well.  For a little more kick add red pepper flakes if using a mild sausage and pump up the spices.  Onion, garlic and basil all add a little flar.  Last I put a table spoon of chipotle Tabasco for a little more moisture and a little smoky touch.  Great

I tried this recipe using healthier ingredients because we are on Weight Watchers I used 1lb of turkey sausage and fat free cheddar cheese. It was good. It made 20 balls and Each sausage ball is 3 Smart Points for Weight Watchers if anyone is interested.

I'm giving this a high rating even though it didn't turn out like I thought.  I carefully followed the directions thinking that it called for a lot of baking mix.  With all the baking mix, the balls wouldn not stick so I added two eggs.  I baked as directed.  They are very good,but less like a meatball and more like meaty, cheesy bread (nothing wrong with that).  Our kids love them and refer to them as "meat biscuits."

Instead of looking for my 50+ year old recipe for sausage cheese balls, I decided to try this with the recommendations to reduce the Bisquik, increase the sausage and reduce the cheese. I was very disappointed! These are not meant to be like meatballs! They are suppose to have a fairly thick crust while being able to taste the sausage and a hint of cheese. I baked half of the batch using foil and they stuck to the foil. I added another cup of Bisquik and another cup of cheese to the 2nd half of the batch and baked them on parchment paper and they almost rolled off by themselves. I knew there was a reason I never use foil anymore! Out of curiosity I retrieved my old recipe and it is the same as this original recipe (that is if a 1 pound block of cheese (grated) is really equal to 4 cups listed on a bag of shredded cheese. The only difference was it stated to bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 25 min. I will forever stick with the 3 cups Bisquik, 1 lb sausage and 1 lb sharp Cheddar cheese (grated)

This recipe calls for too much baking mix.  The correct amount should be two cups instead of three.  The resulting appetizers are more like biscuits than sausage balls, very disappointing and unsuitable for serving guests.

Made as directed. Kneaded mixture like you would a very stiff bread dough. Takes a little time but it will give the desired consistency. Not too dry at all. I think this is a keeper.

I followed the directions exactly, and the first batch was awfully dry. I added a little bit of vegetable oil to the second batch and it was a little better. I thought they were meh, but our guests loved them, and our teenage son loved dipping them in ketchup.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. This recipe is a disaster and completely off on amounts. I didn't have extra sausage to account for the extremely far off bisquick mix, so I had to add water and egg. Extremely disappointed

I changed a lot and that is why it has a  low review, but if you get 2 pounds of sausage, I used turkey spicy, and 2 cups of any pancake mix, and 2 eggs with a jalapeño and sage...It is amazeballs...you see what I did there? I chose not to use cheese because I can't eat it but this recipe gave me a base.??

I agree with the other reviewers who stated that there is too much baking mix.  My mom makes these and I should have called her for the measurements.  I followed another review who said to use two cups of baking mix, two cups of cheese and a lb of sausage.  Even that was too much mix.  Next time, I will use only a cup of baking mix and definitely sharp cheddar (I only had regular).  I don't see why you need to precook the sausage; I didn't have a problem.

I like the way these sausage balls taste, but I do have to say it is WAY too much baking mix and cheese. I could have gotten by with 8 oz. of cheese and 1 1/2- 2 cups of baking mix. That is the only thing I would do differently next time!

I've made this recipe for years. Not intended as a main course. I use less baking mix. It makes it too dry. (2 cups) I use spicy sausage and serve with gourmet mustard(Chipotle or spicy brown) as a dip.

My boyfriend loves sausage balls, his mom makes them for him every time we visit.(We now live 1700 miles away)  But since we moved, I needed to find one similar to what she did. I past the test and he absolutely loves them! Plus they are so simple!!!

I have used this recioe many times. This time I did my own little twist and added to ingredients.  Add 8oz. sour cream and half pkg. of chopped spinach. You have your meat and a veg. Really good. I always add more sausage and cheese than it calls for. Try it.  Adds a little different taste.

If your mixture seems much too dry, as mine did, add buttermilk to the mixture until it sticks together.  We did that with this recipe, and it was the best batch we've ever made!

First, if you are going to make these, use your KitchenAid.  Second, I would not suggest making them. For all the time I put in to make these balls, I was so disappointed.  They are dry and really, really need something to dip them in for more flavor.  May be able to salvage by making a sauce and serving them for dinner with pasta.  Will not make them again.

I really enjoyed these. I didn't stray too much from the original recipe, but following other people's advice, I brought it down to two (I used a tad bit more than two) cups baking mix. I also used 2 cups cheddar cheese and added about a cup of Manchego cheese. Delicious!

I wasn't too impressed at first but then I found them strangely addicting! LOL Next time I'll take the others advice and add less bisquick so you can taste the sausage and cheese more. I used honey garlic sausage and a strong aged cheddar and you could barely taste them; regardless the recipe was very easy and liked by all so I'll try it again for sure!

This recipe was easy and tasted great...the perfect appetizer for a chilly afternoon.  I used a bit more sausage than the recipe called for, roughly 1/4 to 1/2 lb. more and also added maybe a tablespoon of milf to get the mixture to stick together a bit better.  I also sprinkled the tops of the balls with paprika to add a punch of color.  Everyone at the party loved them, especially the men!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe! :)

Very good version of a great snack. Like other said I backed off the Biscuit mix to 3.5 cups. Then I used 1/2 hot and 1/2 mild  sausage. I used Tennessee Pride. The cheese was sharp, 4cups. The trick is to MIX BY HAND until everything is mixed. I added a drop or two of water on my hands to keep it from sticking. Also I baked them a little longer as I make rather large balls and I wanted them done. Not greasy at all. I wonder if a food processor would have done the mixing better or at least quicker??

This recipe is good.  I used Jimmy Dean 50% less fat breakfast sausage (uncooked), about 1/4 cup milk and a little onion powder.  I lined my baking sheets with parchment paper for easier clean up.  Using this sausage, there was not one drop of grease!  They taste like a biscuit with cheese and sausage mixed in.  Pretty good, but not fabulous.  I might make them again.  My 4 and 8 yr. old liked them.

I prefer a cheesier, meatier sausage ball. I left out 1/2 cup of baking mix and still they were VERY dry. The is the first time I've used this recipe and the first time my family didn't polish them off! I won't use it again.

Easy and quick!  Great appetizer and good left over for breakfast.  Don't overcook - they will start to disintegrate and dry out in the oven.

I wish I had read the reviews first because I too would have made the changes..up the sausage, and cut the baking mix. As the recipe reads..it was very dry, but with a pork gravy...very nice!. I did them up as a trial before Xmas Eve..and I will now do them with the changes recommended by the readers.

Quite an interesting recipe.  It beats standing over a hot stove making breakfast for five.  A bit on the dry side, but I thought they were pretty good.  I would reduce the baking mix by 1 cup and the cheese by a cup and a half, depending on your liking.
