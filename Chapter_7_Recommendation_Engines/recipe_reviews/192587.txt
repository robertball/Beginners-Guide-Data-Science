This is a great recipe. I have been looking for a good pesto recipe that is easy and doesn't require Pine nut (those things are expensive).  This is super tasty and a great compliment to cream cheese.  This will now be a staple in my house.....

I actually first came across this recipe in an issue of food & family magazine that my MIL gave me. I used store bought pesto (because I am too lazy to make my own) and it turned out great! This is simple and delicious appetizer or snack.
