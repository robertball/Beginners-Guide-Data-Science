I ended up adding some soy creamer (or half and half if you prefer) to this because it was a little dry and not as creamy as I had hoped. But still delicious!

VERy unique. I needed to add a bit oh half and half as it needed a bit more thinning down and I also nearly doubled the amount of beans. This makes plenty of sauce and for me a little goes a long way.
