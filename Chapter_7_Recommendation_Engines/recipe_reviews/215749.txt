Great and unique recipe. Was loved at a brunch I threw with friends.

I would have liked the Chai flavor to be more pronounced so I might try increasing the amount used.

It was very very sticky (I'm at a high altitude of 6,300') so I added about 6 more teaspoons of flour. It sank very slightly in the center, but not enough to be considered a catastrophe.

I'd have to noodle with the recipe a bit to make it really sing, but overall it was a fun and different alternative to the normally over-sweetened selection of brunch cakes and breads.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It didn't seem to rise much but it turned out to have a nice texture that wasn't dense, but wasn't light & fluffy. If you like wine, it has a great hint of wine taste. I think this would make some great French toast. It is a nice change.
