The pie seemed to go over well at the pot luck lunch. It tasted okay cold, but I think it would taste more fantastic hot (but that wasn't an option for me for this lunch). Modifications: Instead of using two regular onions, I used one regular onion, a Spanish onion, and a red onion. I sauteed them in butter until limp and translucent. Also, I used more than one cup of cheese and two eggs instead of one.

I, as well, browned the onions first instead of boiling them.  I also added more cheese.  It turned out yummy.

This is a really nice simple and quick recipe for cheese & onion pie. Don't saute the onions in butter as other reviewers suggest, it will completely ruin the texture this dish is supposed to have and along with the cheese make it far too greasy. The onions are best boiled for a maximum of 3 minutes. I added a teaspoon of English mustard and omitted the salt - it isn't necessary with cheese, and used fresh ground black pepper. I have often made cheese and onion pie. I have also made it without egg, using one red and one yellow onion, after boiling them for 2 minutes I drain and return them to the pan and stir in 1 tablespoon of flour and about 1/4 cup 18% cream, over a low heat stirring until it slightly thickens, then remove from heat and stir in the cheese (6 oz) and one pre-cooked diced medium potato along with the essential teaspoon of English Mustard.

I made this pie exactly as the recipe said except I had to make my own shortcrust pastry and it was great just like mother made and that's saying a lot.

I carmelized the onions in butter, rather than boil them. Otherwise followed the recipe, and this was okay for me and my Dh. Kids hated it tho.

Instead of boiling the onions in water, I sauteed them in a bit of butter until they were nearly caramelized.  I did everything else the same, and it came out great!!!

Not all that great.   Maybe some additional spices would make it a little less bland, or maybe the onions need to be caramelized, but it was definitely missing something and no one wanted seconds.

An interesting side dish for meat...steak on the grill was our choice.  I didn't think the cheddar sounded good and had some Jarlsburg to use up. Glad I did...it was very tasty.  I also recommend sauteeing the onion on a small amount of butter/evoo and add a touch of garlic.

I could have given this recipe 5 stars except for the fact that the amount of salt needs to be stated rather than S & P "to taste".  IMO, at least 1/4 tsp salt is required.  An excellent dish, very quick and easy, I followed the recipe exactly just because I wanted to know if changes were required.  I will make this again, exactly as called for.

I loved it, but did the following changes. Only used one shell (saves on calories and makes this pie into a quiche). Added some sour cream, less cheese, more onions, 2 additional eggs and ham. If I had had it my way, I would have added caraway seeds to make it into a true German onion tart, but my husband isn't too keen on them. But even without the caraway seeds, it was really yummy!!!!

The recipe was great.  Made a Gf Crust with Cloud nine AP GF flour...I did not pre par broil the onions as the recipe advised as was short on time.  Baked it longer at 400 degrees F... Very good
Served with spinach salad, basic balsamic vinegret dsg and Branston Pickle!

Great simple recipe. I agree with the reviewer who said to follow the recipe and boil, do not sautee the onions. The recipe says 5 minutes, the reviewer said 3, I added the onions to the boiling water and started the timer right away and went the full 5 minutes and it was fine. The recipe seemed a little bland (probably because it's next to impossible to get real sharp cheddar anymore)so I tried the suggested 1t Coleman's English mustard and that was nice but I wanted more so the next time I also added a TB of cider vinegar which added a little bite. I made 2 pies at once using 4 red onions and 3 extra large eggs. I found the extra egg to be welcome. The only hard part of the recipe is getting that darned prepared crust to come out of the pan to sit on top. Anybody got any tips?
