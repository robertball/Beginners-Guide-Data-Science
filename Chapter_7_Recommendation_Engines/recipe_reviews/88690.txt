YUM!  This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I used low-sodium fat-free chicken broth, omitted the green peppers (I don't like them), and used dried parsley instead of fresh.  I also accidentally tripled the garlic to 2 tablespoons. I loved it.  I served it with a loaf of fresh sun-dried tomato bread and it made for a nice hearty dinner.  One word of caution: where the recipe says "large pot," it really means "the biggest pot you've got!"

EDIT 01/28/2009: This is my most frequently used and requested recipe.  I've made this more times than I can count!  A couple things I've learned over time:  1.  For a bit more flavor, mix hot and sweet sausage half and half.  2.  Cook the pasta separately (or add a lot more broth).  I cook and store the pasta separately, except when freezing portions.  To freeze it, I add the pasta and cooled soup into one container and freeze immediately.  This prevents the pasta from soaking up all the liquid in the soup.  Thanks again for a great recipe!

Very nice soup as is, but I played with it a little, adding some things, not measuring precisely and just simply enjoying cooking (and the aroma).  First, I used homemade chicken broth that already had pieces of chicken in it. The combination of the chicken with the Italian sausage was a nice contrast in flavors and textures! I added fresh cremini mushrooms, Italian seasoning rather than just basil, leeks as well as onions, zucchini, cannellini beans, a good glug of red wine (an appropriate Sangiovese) and a Parmigiano-Reggiano rind (I keep them stored in the freezer).  I also subbed fresh escarole for the spinach (had I used spinach I would have used fresh). Quick, easy, aromatic, incredibly flavorful and immensely satisfying.

THANK YOU for this 5 star recipe!  A definite keeper, so versatile.  As Jackie said, feel free to add...and I did.  I added chopped celery and a can of rinsed canaloni beans and used fresh spinich.  I forgot to add the parsley, but it was fabulous the way I fixed it and I don't think I deviated too much from the recipe originally posted.  Next time, I'll add zucchini.

This soup was extremely easy to prepare.  I used bulk sausage instead of links and did not change pans.  I just used a large skillet and kept all the juices together.  I also rounded off the measurements to use full pagkages of the ingredients.  It smelled fabulous while cooking and, to my amazement, tasted even better.  I served it with French bread.  You would be hard pressed to find an easier or more satisfying meal.

This soup is perfect on a cold and rainy evening.  It also freezes well - just don't add quite as much orzo as it calls for as it will soak up too much liquid during the freeze/thaw process.  The whole family liked it - just don't tell them it contains spinach ;)

This is 5 stars PLUS, for how easy yet delicious and nutritious it is. My sausage loving husband loved it, declaring the flavour of the broth "excellent", and took a huge container for lunch the next day. My young children ate it all, and said they liked it! It was a quick, satisfying weeknight meal for us that will be made many, many times again! I added a can of drained and rinsed romano beans for a little extra nutrition, but this soup would be great exactly as the recipe instructs. Awesome soup, Jackie - THANK-YOU!

Thank you Jackie!  My family loved this soup.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  My mother-in-law came over when I was cooking and took some home with her - she too loved it and she is one of the best cooks I know.

We loved this hearty soup, even my 9 yr. old daughter loved it. I added rice instead of orzo, and low sodium broth. I will definately make this again.

So hearty and good!  First big pot of soup of the season and this was a great choice.  Added lots more veggies; celery, carrots and garlic.  I used large elbow macaroni.  Loved the spinach.  We had crusty Texas toast to soak up all the broth.  Even better as lunch today.

Delicious soup!!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I had to use half boullion and the other half canned broth.  Oh, and added pepper.  I thought the green pepper was going to be kind of weird but it fit in perfectly with the tomato and sausage.  Served with crusty French bread.  One of my new favorites!

DELICIOUS & FLAVORFUL! I used turkey sausage and added chopped carrots, leftover penne pasta and garlic salt. I would have added zucchini but it was it was a bit moldy. Omitted chopped garlic and spinach. Used yellow bell pepper instead of green. This was so good that I would serve it for company.

This soup is fantastic!  We like spicy foods so I used hot sausage.  It was very tasty.

I have made this several times, and everyone who eats it LOVES it. I did boil the orzo first and added just the right amount to keep it from getting too thick. It seems like 1/2 pound is too much. I never add it all. Also-- I use Italian sausage made from turkey or chicken to keep it low fat--- we like hot rather than sweet. I usually use more chicken broth as well.

Delicious soup!  I made the soup with ingredients I had on hand: had dried parsley and minced garlic. The kids even loved this soup.  Definitely a keeper.

Wow, this soup was way better than I had expected.  Its so simple, but delicious!  I used chicken sausage, left out the green pepper (don't care for them) and also skipped the pasta to make it a friendly low carb meal.  I spiced it up a bit with some red pepper flakes.  Really great, thanks for an easy awesome meal

This soup is SO good and SO easy.  The only change I would make next time is to use diced tomatoes rather than whole.  Also, if you plan on having any leftovers, I would suggest cooking the orzo separately and then adding it to the individual bowls. Absolutely delicious!

I adore this soup!  However, I was trying to duplicate an Italian Wedding Soup served at a local restaurant.  Their soup did not contain tomatoes so I left those out and it was exact.  Yummy Italian wedding soup and so easy.  I realize you could use meatballs in this but the sausage is so much easier.

I've made it twice now and both time were delicious. The second time I added cannoli beans, used elbow macaroni and also added a can of mild Rot-Tel. I did use frozen spinach both times because it was what I had on hand.  A warning like most others are saying that this makes a HUGE pot. It goes a long way. This recipe is now one of my goes too for dinner parties and also as a great meal from the freezer.

This was super easy and delicious. I used chicken and gouda sausage and cut the orzo in half and used the other half lentils.  I also tossed in a 1/2 cup frozen peas when I tossed in the orzo. Delicious, thanks!

What a great soup on a cold night. I only modified this recipe slightly, I skinned and crumbled my sausage before I cooked it, and I cooked in the soup pot. I then added my peppers, onions & garlic and cooked them slightly before I added any liquids. I also sub'd fresh kale for the frozen spinach and am so glad that I did. I will definitely make this again, but I think I'll try different pasta next time.

Very good. I browned the sausage, without it's casing, on the stove until almost done and then put everything in the crockpot including the spinach at this time and the spinach was still frozen. I forgot the pasta which I was going to to use cheese tortellini and add it at the end. I then cooked this for 3 hours on high. Really good soup, nice to have a hearty healthy soup in my recipe box.

Simple hearty soup that wasn't overly time-consuming to make. The recipe is good as is but I prefer to lower the fat by using chicken & asiago sausage.  I also added 2 bay leaves while it simmered and used fresh spinach just stirred in at the very end.

I made the recipe exactly as is and this soup is AMAZING!  It has so many flavors and is such mind blowing.  I highly recommend making this soup x 3 and having for left overs or give some to your friends.  The recipe says 8 servings and it really does make 8 big servings, FYI.

EDIT:  Now 5+ year later (today is 5/26/14) I have made this several times.  I have found that I like to add in frozen cheese tortellini.  HOWEVER, I omit it for the time being (stay with me!)  I make a big batch and I freeze it for later.  I just pop it in the big pot on low and let it work it's way back slowly.  Once it's simmering, I add in the frozen tortellini - only take a few minutes to cook.  If you keep it in there (and freeze it) the pasta gets very soggy and bleh.

What a surprise this ended up being. I made it for my husband who loves peppers, onions & polish sausage. I used polish sausage instead of sweet italian sausage and I double all ingredients except the broth. I used 12 cups of broth instead of 16. I don't like peppers but the broth tastes so good that I had to try it and I have to say that I loved it. The more I ate the addicting it became. This is deffinately a keeper. Only complaint my husband gave it I need to add more polish sausage. Another tip...would also be good with chicken or both chicken & sausage. Thanks for the recipe.

This is pretty good.  I like how many veggies you can get into one soup and it tastes good but not a lot of zip.  However, it's a great way to eat veggies and protein.  Thanks!

This was wonderful and pleased every picky member of the family.  Made it in a slow cooker, browning sausage and sauteeing onions, garlic and peppers before hand. I substituted crushed for whole tomatoes (family preference) and added  french cut green beans and some carrots! It was fantastic and is definitely a keeper! (You must keep the orzo separate to avoid it sucking up all the juice and getting mushy)

My entire family loved the soup. I followed  the recipe with the exception of using fresh spinach vs. frozen. It was very filling. As a family of four, we were able to get at least 3 meals out of it. I would definitely make this again.

This was soooo good!  I loved it, but be careful with the pasta.  Like another reviewer, I added too much and it soaked up too much of the broth.  It was really, really good!

I didn't have any fresh basil, so I used pesto. I forgot tomatoes, so I used a can of Amy's tomato basil bisque. I used 1/2 hot Italian sausage and 1/2 sweet. I added a bag of cauliflower crumbles to add more veggies. This soup was FANTASTIC.

My husband LOVED this, ate the whole pot himself.  Only minor changes- used rotini (cooked separately) instead of orzo, and fresh spinach instead of frozen. Nice to stumble across a winner!

Saving!  This was very easy and very flavorful.  What a great tasting soup with a lot of nutrients.  My kids and Hubby gobbled it up.  The only thing I changed was I used Bulk Sausage and used 8 bouillon cubes with 8 c of water.

Delicious, and very easy. I added a can of cannellini beans, omitted the parsley, and used mild Italian sausage sliced instead of removed from the casing.  Those were the only minor changes I made, and the recipe was fantastic!

I made this a couple of weeks ago but just noticed I haven't rated it yet - it was great and easy, perfect combination in my opinion! I followed the recipe exact, except I believe the sausage I used was marked wrong, because this was spicy - the sausages had to be hot - DH, DS & I are ok with spicy, but not step-son.  But that has nothing to do with the recipe, and we will have this again!  **Update** I made this again last night with regular diced tomatoes (no chilis) I believe that's what made it too hot before, and I had tomato juice to use up so I used that (maybe 3c) and about 5c chicken broth to make the 8c, that's the only change and this is really just so good!

Unfortunately I did not have a chance to taste it fresh because I made it for weekday lunches and not dinner or a lunch at home.  The soup smelled fantastic while cooking but I think the sausage was a little overpowering.  Otherwise it tasted great.  I cooked the pasta separately and added it just before I put the soup in the microwave.

It was AMAZING! Enough to feed an army. Super easy to make. The only thing I changed was, not putting in as much spinich and had to add salt and pepper. Other than that, it was sooooo good! Oh and don't forget the crusty bread to dip in this wonderful soup. It only makes it that much better!

This soup is delicious! I used Italian style turkey sausage, and it was really good. I also omitted the spinach, because I didn't have any. I think it would be even better with the spinach! I used ring shaped pasta instead of orzo as well. This was really good; even my little brothers and sisters who dislike soup really enjoyed this! Thanks for sharing; I will make this again!

Great flavor!  We served this at our church soup supper and got great reviews. Would recommend Barilla orzo.  We used a rounder shaped orzo and many wondered what kind of "seed" was in the soup?

My family loved it. I make it every 2 weeks, it's that good. My 11 year old says Yeah! when he sees what I'm making for dinner. He comes home from school begging for the left overs. My horribly picky eater will eat it with out complaint. I used hot italian sausage. and fresh spinach. loved it so much, I always make it like that. I gave this recipe to my sisters for christmas. Thanks for this recipe. Some recipes are the best gifts!

OK, I wasn't crazy about this soup. I used low sodium chicken broth and ended up adding 2 bouillon cubes and black pepper to add flavor. That didn't do it for me. The orzo absorbed most of the stock - I should have precooked it as suggested, but we do like a thicker soup. It just didn't seem to have any flavor. Maybe hot sausage or red pepper...I do like Italian wedding soup, so this was a disappointment for me. My husband ate a bowl out of obligation and my son at least tried it. Use a big pot if you do try it!

Excellent!  Went back for seconds.  I added more garlic than called for and sauteed the onion, garlic, and pepper a little, then cooked up the sausage, and then added the tomatoes, broth, etc.  I also used a pound of fresh baby spinach that I chopped up instead of the frozen.  Yum!

This is my new favorite soup!  I left out the green pepper (personal taste) and used italian cheese & parsley sausage from the Italian market.  Top with some good parmesan or romano...manja!

Made this for my family and they loved it, as did I.  Now everyone wants the recipe.  Didn't need to add any seasoning just cooked as told.

This was a great find! I did, however, store it right after I made it in the fridge, and the orzo soaked up all of the liquid. It became a delicious pasta dish the next few days,but it was still great! I used turkey sausage, which made it healthier, but still so yummy :) I will definitely make again, but next time I would put half the orzo in and reserve the other half and, also, cook with a parmesan rind to give the soup a good flavor. Make this soup-- totally worth it!

UPDATE: I'VE REATTEMPTED THIS TWICE NOW. THE SECOND TRY WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE FIRST (I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M MISSING THAT OTHERS AREN'T). MY LAST ATTEMPT WAS PHENOMENOL!!! CHOCK IT UP TO MY CHANGING TASTE BUDS, I GUESS LOL. :) I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS TO SHARE. FIRST, DEFINITELY USE FROZEN SPINACH. IT'S ALREADY CHOPPED FOR YOU (MAKING PREP EASY PEASY) AND TASTES JUST ABOUT THE SAME AS FRESH. SECOND, I USUALLY USE A COMBO OF HOT / MILD ITALIAN SAUSAGE BUT FIND THAT I LIKE THIS BEST WITH ALL SPICY SAUSAGE (BUT THAT'S JUST ME). FINALLY, COOK YOUR SAUSAGES, ALLOW THEM TO COOL AND THEN COARSELY CHOP THEM INTO BITE-SIZED PIECES. GROUND SAUSAGE ALSO WORKS WELL, BUT I LIKE THE TEXTURE OF THE CHOPPED SAUSAGE. IF YOU MAKE THESE CHANGES, YOU'LL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED HOW GOOD THIS IS! This was so-so. I liked this, but didn't "love" it. Other than substituting a generous amount of fresh chopped spinach for frozen spinach (I didn't have time to thaw and didn't want to mess with the microwave route...), I made no significant changes. NOTE: This makes a TON!!! I obviously had leftovers, so my bf warmed some up the next day. THREE bowls later, we still had a LOT left over. Serving steaming bowlfuls with fresh grated Parmesan cheese and a side of crusty Italian bread hit the spot. All in all, this was good, but nothing special. If for nothing else, I was at least able to use up my box of orzo and leftover broth from Thanksgiving. :-) Thanks for sharing, Jackie!

I loved this soup!  My only changes were to use a bag of fresh spinach, added 2 chopped up zucchinis and left the bell pepper out (only because I forgot to buy one).  So quick and so easy.  Yum!

Delicious and SIMPLE. I used Spicy Sausage (as opposed to sweet), and it was very spicy and delicious.  Definitely will make it again - it's  going in my favorite recipes book!

The entire family (including teenagers) loved this recipe.   Did not have sweet italian sausage so, I used 1 lb of hot italian sausage with about 3/4 pound of pork sausage.  Store was out of orzo and used bowtie pasta instead.  Used 1 (14.5 ounce) can of the stewed and sliced tomatoes and 1 (14.5 ounce) can of the diced with jalapenos tomatoes.  (My kids sometimes don't like too many tomatoes so, that way they can "eat around" the stewed and sliced ones a little better).   Absolutely terrific.

This soup is wonderful!  I made a few changes because of what I had on hand.  I used bulk sausage, 14.5 oz can of crushed tomatoes, and 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes with garlic.  It was quick to assemble and enjoyed by all.  I can't wait to taste it tomorrow!

Outstanding soup. So flavorful. This is one of the best soups I have ever had. I made only a couple of very minor changes based on what I already had on hand.  But nothing that changed the soup.  I used a red bell pepper and I also threw in some shredded carrots to use them up.  I made this soup yesterday to serve today.  I added the pasta and spinach today.  I served it with a splash of lemon juice and the Parmesan.

I have made this several times for my family.  Everyone loved it.  I've used both pork and turkey sausage.  I've also used both hot and sweet sausage.  You just can't go wrong!!  It is best served the next day.

Loved it!  I did make a couple of small changes though.  I put the garlic, onion and pepper in to saute along with the sausages.  Also, I replaced half of the canned broth with liquid I had reserved from boiling chicken for another recipe.  Anyway, we really loved it as a quick supper between a Pats game and the World Series.

This soup is now at the top of the list as one of my favorites.  It's even better the next day!  I followed the recipe exactly except instead of using 8 cups of chicken broth, I used 6 and I didn't need to ad orzo or rice at all.  It was good all by itself!

I've been making Tuscan Soup from this site for quite a long time - we love it.  I decided to try this since one of the top pork reviewers just made it.  The ingredients in both are quite similar so I guess the reason I gave Tuscan Soup a five (this one four) is because my family prefers the potatoes over pasta, the milk vs the tomatoes, fresh spinach vs. frozen - although you could interchange the ingredients in each recipe so easily.  Thanks submitter.

Thought this was pretty good. I left out the spinach but instead added a bag of frozen squash, zucchini, red and green peppers. Also, added some roasted red pepper and eggplant spread and a splash of red wine. Used hot Italian sausage.

What a great soup!  Very easy and tasty.  This is a keeper recipe.  I would recommend using low sodium chicken broth and I will cut down on the orzo a bit the next time I make it, which will be soon!.

My husband and I loved this soup.  Being Italian we will probably substitute shredded escarole for the spinach next time and use a little less pasta.  The pasta thickened the soup a bit too much but tasted great.  We did use mildly hot sausage and loved it.

I always get great compliments on this soup. I use a pound of bulk hot Italian sausage and a pound of bulk mild Italian sausage, a bag of fresh spinach and 3 quarts of chicken stock. If I don’t plan on serving it all at once, I use Penne pasta as it holds up better on reheating.  All else the same.

Very good. Tasted quite similar to other Italian sausage soups on this site. Added the whole box (16oz) of orzo, so this became more like a casserole in consistency, but we like more of a stew so that was ok. I would just add more veggies (another pepper, a zucchini, and maybe some carrots) to balance the extra pasta next time.

I made this last night and it got the family approval!  I did tweak it but kept it true to the spirit of the dish.  I did add celery and carrots as recommended.  I used an orange bell pepper since that is what I had.  I used fresh where I could - basil, garlic, spinach, etc.  I cut the amount of orzo down to 2/3 cup but will do 1/2 cup next time as my leftovers aren't very 'soupy' anymore.  I also used spicy italian sausage, as again, it is what I had.  Very tasty!

This was very good I used 4 hot italian sausages and a large bag of fresh spinach I got from walmart. For my notes next time I would like to try it with some beans, celery.  black pepper and mix mild and hot. Taste even better the next day.

I enjoyed this recipe although I changed it up. I used turkey sausage and brown rice instead of orzo pasta. I didn't have the bell pepper but would have left it out anyway.  The spinach is a nice healthy add in. My husband and I really enjoyed as dinner and the left overs were great. Thanks for a great recipe!

We enjoyed this! It was simple to make. I made some small substitutions including adding pepper and a bouillon cube from another user's review. I also added a dash of hot sauce to make this dish less bland, used fresh spinach that I quickly sauteed in oil, and left out the parsley.

This soup is so awesome! I had to vary the ingredients just a little due to not having some. I had to use dried parsley in place of fresh, red bell pepper instead of green, 1 cup dry Ditalini instead of orzo and I used my own homemade chicken broth,(Chef John's recipe also from AR), so I added about 2 tsp of kosher salt. My homemade broth was not as salty as the store bought. I also added just a sprinkle (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 tsp) of cracked red pepper on top and threw in a can of kidney beans. I let it all simmer on low all afternoon. I also made some Crusty French Bread also from AR but started it in my bread machine on the dough cycle and then shaped into 8 rolls before baking. It was a yummy dinner on a cold night. I'm having some leftovers for lunch today and I think it tastes even better! Thank you Jackie for a great recipe. I shared it to FB so my friends and family can enjoy it too.

I added celery, and carrots,  canned white beans, used kale instead of spinach, rice instead of orzo, and added more herbs and spice. It was delicious. Very good with a good loaf of bread. I will make this again. Good recipe to modify to suit your taste.

I looked at several recipes for Italian sausage soup, but decided on this one. I'm glad I did! I only had regular sausage, but the family thought it was delicious anyway. I made a hot Italian sausage soup a few months ago that they thought was too hot, so this was good. I made a separate vegetarian version for myself. I did add some kelp and chia seeds because I add them to everything I can, but I'm sure they didn't change the taste at all. I used homemade chicken broth. I added tortellini(about 10 oz. to each pot) and fresh, chopped spinach and kale at the end. The broth was so savory and delicious that I could have eaten it all before I even served it (speaking of the non meat version, but I'm sure the meat one was great, too! Thank you!

I made this recipe exactly as written the day after Sandy came through our area, a cold rainy night!  This soup was perfect for that and I would not change one thing about it!  This will become a staple recipe for my family.  We served with warm rolls.  Yum!

I have made this 3 times now.  Best soup, loads of flavor.  I used hot italian sausage instead of sweet and diced tomatoes instead of whole.  I also used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen.  I did use 3 colors of bell peppers as I always chop them and freeze them so I always have them on hand.  My favorite soup of all and hubbys too!!!

Great soup. I used hot turkey Italian sausage instead of the recommended sweet style pork sausage and added in some kale and cauliflower I had in the fridge. I didn't have dried basil so I substituted fresh and no parsley. I must have used more orzo than it called for because I had to add an additional 32 oz. of chicken stock to the soup. It came out delicious. Thanks for the great starter recipe, I will make this again.

this soup is fantastic! i threw it together in under an hour between dropping my boyfriend off at class and then dashing to my own, and we both loved it. the only change i made was adding some pepper and hot sauce (we like spicy food) and a can of white beans. other than that, made it exactly as directed and it's delicious. love it!

I didn't have sausage, so I substituted canned chicken...it was just as tasty.  Small shells or any small pasta works in this.

I made this when I was feeling very bad; so I had to use ingredients I had on hand.  I used Rotel green chilies and tomatoes and tomato sauce, mushrooms, chicken bouillion instead of chicken stock.  I feel strengthened now; the taste is sensational and it was really nutritious.  I highly recommend it!

Very healthy and filling, great for left overs. My husband loves spicy foods though so I added some hot sauce. One of those soups that becomes a family staple and made again and again over the years.

Yum!  Made mine with spicy Italian sausage since that's all I ever use.  I also added a couple shakes of crushed red pepper since we like spicy.  I totally forgot to get parsley so I skipped it and it still tasted delish! Great soup for a cold night.  Thanks!

I have this soup simmering on the stove right now.  I halved the recipe but followed it exactly, except I used fresh spinach.  One warning, use low sodium chicken broth.  The sausage I used is already plenty salty.  I read reviews saying the orzo will absorb a lot of liquid but the soup still seems thin.  I added a can of drained and rinsed black beans.  
Overall, not impressed.  Maybe it'll taste better tomorrow.

Excellent!  Very flavorful!  I forgot to buy bell peppers, so didn't add them.

This soup is awesome! I used spicy sausage instead because I think it would have been too bland if plain sausage were used. I think the spicy sausage gave it more flavor and it wasn't too spicy but just right. I made it for my husband and brought some for my sister-in-law and her children and they all had seconds!

This was great.  I used broken wheat pasta and added a 28oz can crushed tomato for a tomatoee taste and I used fresh spinach.  Next time I will use ground turkey to make it healthy.

Boy this was good!  I made a couple substitions though...  I used chorizo instead of sausage because that's what I had on hand.  I also used rotini instead of orzo.  Think the rotini sucked up more water than the orzo might because the leftovers were pretty dry.  I think that will be easily remedies by adding another 4 cups or so of chicken broth though.  This is something that I will definitely make again.  It got all thumbs up from my family.

This was delicious, definitely a perfect soup for those cold winter evenings. I didn't have a pepper, but I kept everything else. I used apple cinnamon sausage and cooked it in the big pot, and when it was almost done, I tossed in a chopped onion and 4 whole, peeled garlic cloves. I also cooked the orzo separate so that it didn't soak up all the broth and added it with the spinach and then heated through for 5 minutes. Yummy!

Good soup, but it lacked that something to make it awesome.  However it could have been my sausage- it was rather bland.  In the future I might add paprika/ tobasco/salsa/ or use a spicy sausage for more flavor.  Overall- a good way to use sausage.

I used 3 turkey italian sausage links, added zucchini and carrots, and a squeeze of fresh lemon and a couple of grinds of black pepper at the end to punch it up.  Great way to get kids to eat veggies!  Would be good if cannelini beans were added for the last 10 min.

I am new to making soups and this turned out wonderful!  We like things spicy, so I use hot Italian sausage. I add a bit of sliced carrot, a bay leaf and use bow tie pasta instead of the orzo and alll the other ingredients given.  We all loved it!!

This soup was fantastic! I added some celery that I had on hand, as well as some frozen corn. I omitted the spinach & subbed bow tie pasta for the orzo. Don't forget to top w/ parmesan!
