Great recipe! Perfectly ideal to use as a spread for sandwiches or just on crackers of your choice. I made a few minor changes to suit my personal taste; reduce dried thyme down to 1 tsp. and lightly sprinkled some Himalayan sea salt.
Now here another twist to this recipe born from a screw up. Instead of using sunflower seeds, substitute pumpkin seeds and soak for 8 hours as well. It is actually quite good and either one is extremely healthy and fun to serve. Thank you Misty for sharing
