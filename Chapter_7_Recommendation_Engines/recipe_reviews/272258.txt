My family absolutely loved it! The only change I will make next time is to add some tomato paste or sauce for a more tomato flavor.

Thanks for posting this recipe France C...! I made it once and am going to make it again, today, but however, since I am a diabetic, I use the basics in this recipe to cook the beans, then the sauce I use is G. Hughes sugar-free hickory smoked barbecue sauce for the flavor.

Trying to incorporate more beans into our diet and less meat. Found this to be good and hearty addition.

Very good baked beans and so much easier than using a slow cooker as I have for years. Will make again and freeze in serving size containers so I won;t have to buy any more canned beans.
