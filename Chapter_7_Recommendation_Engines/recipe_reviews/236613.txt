Yummy. I used leftover salsa chicken that I had. I left out the black beans and red peppers and used the optional cheese. It was very filling, and I was surprised how much I liked the summer squash in it. I'll try this again.

This is a fabulous recipe! I have a bumper crop of yellow squash and a very health-conscious but picky family. I used this as filling for burritos and they loved it! I also added some onion and a tiny bit of cumin and chili powder.
