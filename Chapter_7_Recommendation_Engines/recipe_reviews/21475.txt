This was a good basic recipe.  I made a few changed/additions.  Like other users, halved the mayo and added 2 eggs.  Used a bit more crab meat, as I like mine full of crab.  1/2 saltines, 1/2 bread crumbs.  about 1/3 cup dried parsley, some lemon juice, some worchestershire, and definitely more old bay (I'm from MD).  I couldn't bring myself to broil these, I've always pan fried, so I used 1 Tbsp butter and a few Tbsp Vegetable oil on med/high heat.  These are filling, so I served on toasted buns with tomatoes and a wonderful veggie medley on the side.    Thanks for the recipe!

AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS: I tried this several recommended ways, and this seems to be the key to a happy crowd for us.. 1) changing mayo amount to 1/2C or it turns out to be very greasy to us.  2) add chopped green onion and red pepper (eyeball amount) esp since most our friends aren't onion fans 3) add 1/8C parsley  4) 1.5t Old Bay Seasoning, and lastly I followed the advice of putting a dash of Worcestershire's and lemon juice. What a hit this was.  If you use the broiler instead of frying on med-high ...please check them often as they should not dark in color as some have shown but a golden brown.

These were really great! They made me homesick for Baltimore. Too salty for me so I replaced the crackers with bread crumbs and added a bit more Old Bay instead. I think next time I'll try unsalted crackers. I like the cracker consistancy and a strong Old Bay flavor but saltines were too much. Thanks!

I made this for my wife and she loved it. We gave some to our neighbors who also liked it and now want the recipe. It tastes great and is easy to make. Since the recipe doesn't ask for frying, clean up is easy and the house didn't have an oily smell.

I used a 1/4 measuring cup to help shape the cakes. Just pat down with your palm to make the cakes a little flatter but wider.

These were awesome!  I used Club crackers instead of saltines.  The butter flavor really added to the recipe.  I chopped the onion and celery super fine and used just a little less onion than 1/4c.  I was skeptical about broiling them because I have always pan fried my crabcakes, but WOW!  They were as good if not better that pan fried.  It took about 5-6 min per side under the broiler.  I used whole lump crab on sale 2lb for $16.  I will be making these this way from now on.  As a topper sauce I took one part mayo, one part Di'jon mustard and a splash of Worstershire sauce and mixed it and placed a dollop on top.  EXCELLENT!

I have made this recipe more times than I can count.  I use 1 cup breadcrumbs instead of the saltine crackers and made the cakes considerably smaller (about 2 inches in diameter - I get about 20 cakes) and broiled them 5-7 minutes each side.  Great as appetizers.  My friends always request them!

I love crab cakes and now my own crab cakes are my favorite.  I can never stick to a recipe, so I added to this recipe, but it was great.  I used bread crumbs and corn meal instead of saltines, I added green onions and some other spices, but it was great!  I served it with "Trader Joe's" tartar sauce and everyone flips over them!!

these crab cakes were really good and im excited about them! ill definitely be making them again. i changed the recipe slightly:

used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup mayo instead of a whole cup.
added green onions and chopped red pepper.
extra old bay seasoning
multi-grain club crackers instead of saltines.

they were a little too wet when i added the amount of crackers called for, so i added some extra. also used canned lump crab meat which was fine.

they stuck together GREAT and made perfect patties. they tasted perfect. im a big fan of the broiling technique instead of frying, less cleanup and much easier. 

THANK YOU!

This is a great recipe! Like others, I added a few of my own ideas.  I added a little cajun seasoning & cayenne, and I increased the amount of mustard.  I sauteed in a very small amount of olive oil, then I put them on a broiled portabello mushroom, sprinkled with a little parmesan, and my husband went through the roof.

My fiance floats into the kitchen, cartoon-style, when he smells these! I have made them many times, and they always come out GREAT! I have even used canned crab (three small cans, drained) instead of fresh, and they come out fine! Usually, I make them with half Saltine crumbs, half breadcrumbs, and lite mayo. I also put a little fresh parsley in if I have it. Always delish! Thanks!

This was a great base recipe to work from as we did not have all of the ingredients but made it work with what we did have and they turned out awesome! Instead of crackers we used panko breadcrumbs, used 1/2 mayo, added 2 eggs, added dried parsley and Italian seasoning. I sauteed them with some EVOO and they were fabulous!

I really wanted to give this recipe 5 stars, because I've finally gotten the "base" recipe that I needed to make the crabcakes that I love so dearly... as do my fellow Baltimorian neighbors.  Unfortunately I agree with the other reviewers that some tweaking is definitely needed.  I agree on halving the mayo and adding a couple of eggs.  I've played with this recipe a good deal and while they seem a bit wetter, the final product is considerably better in both flavor and texture.  I would also HIGHLY recommend measuring your Old Bay with T rather than t.  Granted, I'm in MD where Old Bay is more popular than salt and pepper, but while I don't measure, I've got to be around 2T and I've gotten nothing but compliments.  Enjoy!

My husband's already asking for more!  He loved these crab cakes as well as my in-laws.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except I added a bit more Old Bay Seasoning and used Club Crackers instead.  Delicious!  I think the Club Crackers are less salty than regular saltines, and add a nice little flavor to the crab cakes.  This recipe is a definite "keeper".

Utterly, utterly delicious. Took the advice of other reviewers & used breadcrumbs instead of saltines and also upped the Old Bay a tad. Apart from that, followed recipe exactly and all 6 cakes went down one greedy (and highly appreciative) throat. Fresh crab is easy to get here, so this is one I'll be making over and over again. Thank you.

I took the idea from other reviewers to cut the mayo in half and add two eggs.  I also pan fried them.  Yum!

I made these by the recipe and they were pretty good but not great.  I am going to make these again using an egg for binding and add tablespoon by tablespoon of however much mayo is needed.  I am going to omit the celery and add roasted red bell pepper.  I will use Panko bread crumbs instead of the saltines; will also coat with the Panko and fry them instead of broiling.

I increased Old Bay Seasoning to  1 1/2 tsp.  Added 1 tsp parsley for color and seasoning.  I refigerated the mixture for a few hours before shaping.  I also put them together about 8 hours ahead of time and they were great.  I cut them out using a cookie cutter as I wanted them to look professional and they did. I baked them at 350 degrees until hot and cooked through.  Then I put them on a low broil setting for 2 minutes on each side to make them a golden brown. I served them with crab cake sauce from this site.  The one submitted by sal.  This was all delicious.

Fabulous - and so easy to make!  My friends are demanding more and begging for the recipe.  I used Phillips canned crab from Costco and served them with a simple avacado/mango/lime juice salsa. I left out the celery and prepared them the night before w/out any problems. 1 batch makes 6 cakes.

This was my 1st attempt at crabcakes after looking at about 100 recipes. They were great.  I used Light Mayo. I also added a 1/2 cup of thawed a "Seasoning Blend" of already chopped celery, onion, green & red pepper I found in the frozen section of the supermarket. A real time saver and perfect flavor. Definately will make again!

I have eaten crab cakes many times before. I decided to try making them myself. I looked at all the recipes and chose this one. I'm glad I did! They were a big hit for the holidays, everyone loved them. I used a creamy mustard sauce on the side. Really easy to make but a little pricey.

Good stuff! My wife loves crab cakes... she comes from a non-seafood family but she got hooked on crabcakes at a lovely restaurant on our honeymoon. This recipe is as close as I found to those crabcakes yet. She's not quite rolling her eyes back in her head and sighing with luxurious exuberance when she tastes these... but it's close. :)

Super easy, as good as any you can buy!  I used a combination of ritz and saltines.   Need to watch the broiler cause easy to burn.   New Favorite recipe!!!!

Very tasty, but too salty.  Maybe I will try panko bread crumbs next time.

This is just okay.  I prefer to use 1-2 tablespoons of soft breadcrumb, much less may and one egg to bind it together.   I do not like the onion.  Also, you should shop for fresh not canned meat, preferebly lump blue crab.

This recipe isn't bad- I've used it a couple of times, and the crab cakes are pretty tasty.  However, they are overly greasy due to there being too much mayo in the mix.  They also don't hold togther very well for the same reason- they are way too wet with so much mayo.  Reducing the mayo and adding more Old Bay (and perhaps another saltine or two) would make this a great recipe.

GREAT CRABCAKES!!!!  Very nice taste and they held together wonderfully.  We used Ritz crackers in place oif the saltines and also added some red pepper for color and taste.  Wonderful...  WIll be saving this one.

I made these for my husband tonight and he loved them. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I changed the recipe a bit. I used just regular prepared mustard instead of the brown mustard, I also did not have the celery so I didn't put that in. For the seasonings I substituted red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, paprika and hot mustard powder and some garlic salt in place of the old bay seasoning, I also added an egg to help it stick. Finally I used imitation crab meat instead of regular crab simply because I didn't have any regular crab, and I fried them instead of broiling. I must admit that the spices added a little bit of a kick but not so much to make it too hot to handle and my husband and I like spicy foods however the kick was mostly in the after taste. We dipped them in ranch dressing. Needless to say they were a hit, I will definitely make them again.

So easy to make...and I followed some alt suggestions as posted by previous reviews...breadcrumbs and the use of eggs.

We really liked these! I halved the recipe and used wheat saltines. I served these as a side dish to the seafood enchillada recipe from this site. I will be making these again. Thanks!

I thought I had a good crabcake recipe, with not much but saltines, egg, and some spices mixed with the crab meat then fried. But this recipe is much better, IMHO. 

I had to substitute Club Crackers for Saltines, which made the dish a little sweeter than I would have liked. I think with saltines it will be great. 

And next time I might add just a bit more mayo, since I love it so much. And after that, i might mix in some some melted butter with the crab, because it's, well, butter.


I used Phillip's Backfin, in the can. 
I may have set the pan too close to the broiler, since they started to overbrown at about 6 minutes. So keep an eye on them while broiling. 

This is a definite keeper!

I love this recipe. I use a little less mayo and replace it with honey. Honey adds sweetness and brings out the sweetness of the crab. I also use less old bay and always broil these. YUM

I followed this recipe almost exactly. I used a little less mayo as others suggested and I used canned crab. The taste was great. But,they did fall apart. I would still use this recipe again. Thanks!

This recipe is great!  My husband and I loved it.  Part of the crab we used was canned (1/3 of it) and it worked great.  I used the recommendations and added an egg and used half bread crumbs/half saltines.  They fell apart a little even when I added an egg, so I believe this addition is a must.  Same goes with using half breadcrumbs.  I can definitely see how they would be too salty using all saltines.  This is a definite keeper and as good as any restaurant crab cake I've had.

Okay, so I was looking for something to do with imitation crab meat instead of a salad.  So I tried this.  The flavor was good, but it didn't hold together at all.  So if I try this again I think I will chop up the meat a little more and maybe add an egg. I used the recipe as written except substitited imitation crab for the real stuff.  I'd like to try with the real stuff also.

My husband and I have been craving crab cakes and I thought I would attempt making these homemade.  Real crab is extremely expensive where we live and I this recipe just had to turn out good.  I was not disappointed...the crab cakes turned out great!  They were flavorful and tasted exactly as I expected they should.  I added a little bit more Old Bay seasoning and some fresh cracked pepper, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Thanks!

i used imitation crab in these cakes, and while they turned out well, i would recommend chopping or tearing up the crab flakes to very small pieces, as the large pieces made for unwieldy cakes. still quite good though.

This was so easy to make and was delicious. I didn't have saltines so I used the generic equivalent of Carrs water crackers. Broiling them made them nice and crispy on the outside, and they held together nicely. I made them a bit smaller and thicker so I yielded 10 cakes. This will definitely be a regular meal at our house.

As someone who's lived (and eaten crab cakes) in Maryland most of my life, I can assure you that this crab cake recipe is the real deal.  I've used this recipe about 5 times and have found that the cakes seem to stay together a little better if you dice the celery into small pieces rather than chop them.   I also kick up the Old Bay by 1/2 teaspoon because Maryland is all about Old Bay seasoning. Use fresh back fin crab meat from Maryland, Virginia, or Delaware if it's available in your area.  Serve with saltine crackers and cole slaw and a cold glass of beer. Thanks for posting this Maryland tradition.

Wow, sorry, that's way too much crackers and mayo for me. I had a hard time with this. I'll find a different recipe. Sorry Jeff! I like just a little mayo and a little bread crumbs with an egg to hold together. Keeps the cakes nice and fluffy and lumpy! Can somebody tell me if some of the pics are so dark that the cakes look burned and flat or is it my computer screen?

I needed to use canned crabmeat (3 cans = 18oz) and had to adjust a bit for that, but I combined the main recipe with suggestions from an earlier review. Hubby said fresh crab would have tasted better, but canned was still very tasty. Also, I am allergic to eggs, but my Vegenaise tastes just like mayo and the kids even liked these. 1/2 C Vegenaise, 1 1/4 C regular bread crumbs, and 1 1/2 tsp of Old Bay are the changes I made - I will be adding this to my recipe box and this one's going in the monthly rotation!

YUMMY AND EASY!!!  The only changes I thought  made were to decrease the mayo to 1/2c, 2 eggs - But I re-read the ingreds, and I added 1T of old bay, (yikes) and then I added another 1/2T!!!  But, both of the kids (10&12) and my hubby LOVED them. I don't think it/I ruined them in anyway.

This recipe has made me a legend among my family and friends.  Living on the Eastern Shore, you HAVE to know how to make good crab cakes.  I only make these with fresh, jumbo lump crab meat (at $25-30 a pound!) and only for special occasions.  I use Ritz crackers.  There is just enough good stuff to hold them together without compromising the taste of all that yummy crab.  My husband won't order them in a restaurant anymore. THANK YOU!

Excellent recipe! I used stone ground crackers instead of saltines and had to increase the quantity a little but since we don't like our food very salty these came out perfect. I served them was a tomato bisque also found on this site and they were perfect on the first cold snowy day in Colorado.

Bottom line:  This is a bullet proof recipe, simple and elegant.  We used fresh crab meat from Crisfield MD, the alleged crab capital of the universe.  Can be modified in different ways for different tastes, but basically, it's the best we've tasted.

These were excellent. I think I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I probably used fewer crackers than the recipe asked for because I didn't want to open another sleeve. They still turned out great! I will definitely be making these again.

I am from New Orleans and this is not the sort of recipe that I am used to with sea food, but I had about two cups of left over crab meat and thought I would try it. I was blown away. The crab flavor is not lost in overpowering spices. With the addition of an egg, per some of the reviews, what we had was a firm, tender, succulent delicay. My teenaged kids went nuts over them. Next time, it wont be to use up left overs that I make these. Fit for company, for sure.

Loved this recipe!  

I made it for our family's New Years Eve dinner.  They received rave reviews!    I made just a few changes based on a combination of what the other reviewers said.  I reduced mayo to 1/2 cup and used 2 eggs.  I added a green onion, fresh parsley and a little bit of cayenne pepper.  I did half saltine crumbs and half bread crumbs.  I also put a little bit of butter on the pan when cooking. I  served the cakes with a dollop of lime-cilantro mayo sauce and a garnish of lemon slices. They were so good!  Will definitely use this recipe again and again!

Perfecto! I used other reviewer's suggestions and used 1/2 the mayo and egg.  I also used green onion. I will be making this again.

Awesome Recipe! I would have given it 5 stars except that I had to modify the recipe as per the other reviewers by halfing the mayo, adding 2 eggs (1 egg & 1 egg white) and also adding green onions and red peppper. The texture was excellent and they broiled up perfectly! Better than most restaurants. The family loved them. Definitely a keeper!

I don't claim to be a crab cake expert, but these were definitely VERY good! I used bread crumbs instead of saltines, and added some chopped red bell pepper. They were perfect. A little squirt of lemon, and they needed nothing else!

These were a big hit with my friends!  I grated the onion so that there were not big chunks and also added an egg as suggested.  I did half bread crumbs and half saltines, but it was still a tad bit too salty for my taste.  I will probably just use bread crumbs next time.  They broiled up great!

Excellent.  The best crab cakes are like these, lots of crab, very little breading, but with just enough spice and kick to accentuate the flavor of the crab.  I did follow others' suggestions.  Used one beaten egg to hold the mix together.  Mixed half plain bread crumbs with half saltines.  And used only 2/3 cup of Mayo.  Tasty!

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I used sweet & spicy mustard, roasted garlic mayo, and Veggie thins, instead of saltines.  Also, I don't keep Old Bay seasoning, so I got creative.  I used my late grandmother's special homemade masala blend (curry powder).  I also added chopped shrimp and cilantro instead of parsley.  All in all, it came out tasting great.  I served it over a spring mix salad, and chilled white wine.

These are excellent, have become a family favorite. I use 3/4 c mayo split half light mayo and half reg and added 1 egg.  All low fat didnt work out and all regular was a bit oily for me. No egg was tasty but fell apart easily. Very tasty!  Thanks,

Have to disagree with the 5 stars - too much mayo in this recipes makes for an overly greasy crabcake, not light full of crab flavor.

Not at all Impressed!! Living on the Chesapeake Bay my whole life, I consider myself knowledgable about Crab Cakes if anything but thought I try soemthing a bit different. A waste of Crab Meat--too much mayo and not nearly enough zing!! My hubby could not believe how blah they were--Do Not make these!!

These were okay. Easy to make but it tasted too salty. Perhaps too much Old Bay Seasoning?!? I didn't taste the crabmeat at all and I LOVE crabmeat. Next time I will cut back on the seasoning and add alittle more of the crabmeat.

Simple recipe that's DELICIOUS!!  I'm an addict of Pampered Chef products, so the chopper made this recipe quick to make!  I bought imitation crabmeat & it was wonderful! I doubled the recipe & made these with the Scrumptious Seafood Linguine recipe on this site.  Wonderful!!

Excellent!  Used whole wheat bread crumbs instead of the crackers and they were GREAT!  I recommend letting the cakes stand for 3 or 4 mins after removing from the oven, to let the firm up some.  We will definitely cook this again.

I have made this recipe a few times.  I am not from Maryland, but I do like crab cakes. The last couple times I have roasted a couple jalapeños and chopped them up.  This adds a little kick. But these are really good with or without the jalapeños.

Great recipe! I made them tonight and my husband was really impressed bc this was my first time making crab cakes. I followed the reviews and did 1/2 cup mayo and 1 egg instead of 1 cup mayo. I also refrigerated the mixture for about 1//2 hour before making the crab cakes and they were super easy to mold and shape without falling apart. Next time I'm going to try and make them a little bigger, but this is a great and simple crab cake. We live in MD so we get a lot of good crab cakes at restaurants and both agreed that these were better then most restaurants serve! Thanks for a great recipe!

First time making crab cakes. Everyone loved them. I used the club crackers and canned crab and should have added some bread crumbs to firm them up. You learn from trying.

I prefer to use oyster crackers or stale bread instead of saltines. I use less mayo (as I am allergic to egg) and the smallest possible amount of oil to keep these together. I find backfin meat to be the best crab cake meat.

Love it! I used round crackers instead. It was the only thing on hand. I fixed it with Amatricana. It went together perfect. You can look the recipe up on here too. I will be making this again.. maybe for guess! Thanks for sharing this with us!!!

Excellent!  These taste even better the next day when reheated, so I remember this recipe when I need to prepare things ahead for entertaining. Also the first time I made the recipe I used Ritz Crackers and that gave them a nice buttery taste.  Either cracker works well. As a rule, I prefer to reduce the mayonnaise to 3/4 or 1/2 cup and they are not as mushy.  GREAT and EASY recipe

Definitely took me longer than 20 minutes to darken enough but other than that pretty good.  I threw in some green onions and used a little less crab meat.  The patties had some trouble sticking together, not really sure how to solve that though.

Outstanding! We were on the OBX sound side and caught our own crabs. I left out the celery and added about a 1/2 lb of crab than what the recipe calls for. I also used dijon mustard.

We are very picky when it comes to our crab and these are perfect!  Chill mixture and use ice cream scoop, cookie scoop or 1/4 cup measure to form a perfect cake!  I used buttery crackers instead of saltines - definitely more flavor.  Used only half cup of mayo but added an egg. I get a dozen 1/4 cup cakes from 1 lb of premium lump crab meat. Great for entertaining ~ $1 crab cakes but they taste like a million...you can make them earlier in the day and then just pop them in the oven when you're ready!

We made these just as the recipe states and they turned out wonderful!  We prepped/shaped them earlier in the day since we had a very busy evening and then broiled them for a quick dinner.  So delicious!  Next time I'll add more Old Bay because that's what we like.

Yummy! I used this recipe combined with the one on the side of a 1 lb can of crab. So I ended up using 1 cup of breadcrumbs,1 whole egg and one egg white.I used the lite Mayo as well. Old Bay is not available where I am so I used another brand of seafood seasoning then added a little salt,onion powder,parsley and some black pepper.I baked them at 375 for about 30 minutes,flipping them after the first 20 mins. Mine didn't break apart at all and I ended up with 9 medium cakes.But very nice and full of flavour especially after they sat for a while and soaked up the flavours. I also made a sauce of mayonnaise,dijon mustard,hot sauce,worcestershire sauce and seafood seasoning which complemented the cakes so well.

I used this recipe for making crab cakes for the first time. I use less mayo (probably half as much), a little mustard, and substitute breadcrumbs for the saltines. I also saute the onion and celery in a bit of butter (don't like biting into crunchy veggies crab cake). If you have time, definitely let the shaped cakes settle in the refrigerator for some time. It helps to keep the cakes together, especially if you are using less mayo. This is very good and the only way I make crab cakes. I do broil on low instead of high because I noticed the first time that the tops of cakes started to burn before they were heated throughout.

Yummy. The tip about using a 1/4 cup measuring cup to form the patties is very helpful. I also used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup mayo and refridgerated the patties for 1 hour. Cooked them on a pancake griddle and topped with some mango salsa and they were gobbled up.

I followed the recipe exactly, I even used $12 lb Maryland crab!--but it did not turn out.  The cakes fell apart and, even after baking, did not stay together.  I'm really not sure why... I followed the directions exactly.  They still tasted pretty good though.

I have never made crab cakes but have wanted to try them for eons. Being a crab cake virgin, I am not sure the experience satisfied as much as I anticipated it would though. I scaled this recipe for 4 and still had enough for 6 good-sized cakes. I made this ingredient-wise to a tee except I used crushed Oyster / Chowder crackers. (They are just like Saltines except little and round to float in soups and such.) I had some expensive claw crabmeat and wanted to stretch the 1 lb. can to make another recipe for the Holidays. When scaled the recipe called for 11 ounces (nearly ¾ of the lb). I used only half of it (8 oz. or so) AND when I crushed up my crackers I had more of those than the scaled recipe needed too. So less crabmeat and more filler crackers but the patties held together well with the same amount of mayo. I liked this being a broiled recipe too. I did put a little butter on top to broil. I found that they did fall apart if you try to flip them before they are really brown on top.  Giving them plenty of time to crisp and firm up on the first side aided in turning them immensely.  Probably a good recipe but personally I think cold crab salads and spreads bring out the flavor of the meat better. Hot cooked crab suits me better in hunks with drawn butter or perhaps in a fancy cheese rarebit.

Fabulous! Great that they were broiled, not pan fried. I substituted an egg for 1/2 of the mayo and they turned out fab.

Loved it! I also did the green onion/red pepper addition and used only 1/2 cup of light mayo. They were delicious and the broiling method is so much easier and more healthful than frying. I'll make this recipe often.

The overall rating of 4 and a half stars is exactly right.  The crab cakes were good, but not great.  One little change could bump this recipe up to 5 stars.  I would make them again.

This was a great recipe, I followed others suggestions and did go heavy on the Old Bay.  I used the saltines and I agree that it was a little salty, maybe I'll use the low sodium saltines next time.  I saved 1/2 the mix to try them fried too. I made patties, coated them in Panko flakes and fried in a little oil...excellent fried, although it's not as healthy fried!  I dipped them in sweet chili sauce - really good.

Very good! Had to use canned crab meat because fresh is not easily accessable to us. I have made crab cakes before using bread crumbs, so I did try it with the saltine crackers and I think I like them better that way. The only thing I would do different next time is maybe add some green pepper and some chopped celery. Seemed like they needed just a little more flavor

These were great crabcakes, and I have to admit, I somehow missed putting in the mustard! Super easy and my family really enjoyed them. I mixed bay seasoning with sour cream for a sauce and served on a bed of shredded lettuce. I will make again using the brown mustard....

Delicious.  I used homemade mayonnaise (flavored with Dijon mustard, pepper, and a little cayenne pepper) as a binder, which added more flavor.  I coated the cakes with bread crumbs and put them in the frig for a couple of hours, which helped hold them together, and sauteed them in olive.  Similar in quality to those I recently enjoyed in a nice restaurant-for over $20.

I have made this recipe about 5 times now.  It is one of the best recipes I have ever made!!!  People who have tried it think I have slaved over it for hours.  I usually double the recipe and use one pound of lump crabmeat and one pound of claw meat.  It goes faster than you can say YUM!!!

I have tried numerous crab cake recipes from this site and this one is definitely the BEST!!  They are super easy to make and there's not a big, sloppy mess to clean up afterwards!!  I crunched up some oyster crackers (with a little extra salt) instead of using Saltines and I formed the patties using a couple of sheets of plastic wrap (so I wouldn't get my hands all yucky).  What an EXCELLENT and healthy (not fried) crab cake recipe... Thanks!!

i used less crackers as stated by other reviewers, green onions instead of onions and added chilli chopped finely (deseeded 1st) for colour. My guy doesn't care for celery so i left that out. Even canned crabmeat worked! i love that raw eggs are not used because it means i can shape the cakes and leave it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours beforehand. Only thing is the cakes were very fragile and threatened to fall apart. But nothing a little extra care wouldn't take care of.

These crabcakes are delicious, but I admit I messed with the recipe. I added a little Chipotle Tabasco  cracked black pepper, and used 1 cup of mostly bread crumbs with some corn meal instead of saltines.

After vacationing in Maryland we enjoyed the crab cakes so much that we wanted to make them at home. This recipe is delicious and easy to make. My husband and 1 year old son can't get enough of them.

Good recipe but I made a few changes -

use 1 1/2 lbs of lump crab meat
no onions and a little bit of chopped sweet pepper in its place
1/2 cup crushed saltines
1/2 cup plain bread crumbs (plus a little extra)
2 eggs
dry mustard instead of brown mustard (cause I didn't have any)
extra old bay

These were so easy and really excellent. Not greasy like the kind you get in restaurants. Needed a little more mayo than called for. I mixed the ingredients with my hands because spoon or fork just left big clumps.

Really good!!  I didn't have saltines so I used bread crumbs and substituted a small amount of corn meal for some of the bread crumbs. Also added a wee bit of cayenne pepper because I like things a little spicy. Definitely a do again!!

Made this with the following changes/substitutions: 1/2 cup of crab meat, a generous 1/4 cup of vegan mayo (egg allergy in the house) and swapped the celery for red bell peppers. I just halved all the spices, onion and the rest of the ingredients to make half the original recipe. It made 6 small/medium cakes which was perfect for our family with 2 adults and 2 young children. My SUPER picky 5 year old inhaled his whole crab cake and younger brother tried a few bites (first tastes of crab) and the two adults had two nice sized cakes to eat. The flavor was great!  They were super quick to make and to cook (broiled for about 5-6 minutes since they were smaller).  I will definitely make these again!

These are absolutely delicious! In addition to the celery and onion, I add  about 1/4 cup finely minced green bell pepper for extra flavor & crunch!

I serve them up by a portion of two or three cakes. I pour a generous portion of my doctored up thin brown gravy. Here's what I do:

I take a packet of cheap plain brown gravy, following the instructions on the packet. To the gravy I add a couple of fat palms full of green peppercorns (sold by the jar in water). Make sure you strain the water off in a fine mesh sieve before adding to the grave, else the gravy becomes too thin.

Plate them up with a serving of Fettuccine with Roasted Garlic Alfredo and a Cheddar-Garlic Biscuit like they serve at Red Lobster (you can find the recipe all over the internet for these). The combined flavors are like a party in your mouth! You can make about 16 cakes with this recipe. You can freeze or refrigerate the leftovers. If you freeze them, reheat by putting them on the tray of your toaster oven set to 350. Cook for 4 minutes per side. They retain their crunchy coating when reheated this way.

These are very good.  I cut the mayo in half and added an egg instead, they stayed together well.  For the crab meat, I used all fresh crab- 1/2 lb lump crabmeat and 1/2 lb claw meat.  Great recipe.

Absolutely wonderful! I chopped the onion and celery very finely and cut the mayo in half as suggested. My husband thought they were perfect. They could have been a little more moist for me (I will try sauteing in butter and/or adding eggs next time), but are still some of the best crab cakes I've ever had...and I'm VERY picky about my crab cakes. I was surprised that such simple ingredients (esp the saltines) worked so well. No mealy or grainy taste. On top of it, they're better than and at least half the price of what we would have paid in a restaurant! I will DEFINITELY make again!!

Fantastic! I substituted half the mayo for 2 eggs as suggested.    I was at a friend's house when I made them and had no Old Bay Seasoning on hand so I improvised with as many as the spices used in Old Bay as I could (minus the cadmium, celery salt & ginger).   My friend was out of bread crumbs so I just used the saltines. I added a tiny amount of Miracle Whip to cut the saltines and I lightly sauteed in butter-WONDERFUL!!

Tried this recipe which I found to be a bit bland and soggy.  Depending on your taste for more zest - you may like to substitute dijon mustard. Also, I ALWAYS use panko crumbs now as they are so much lighter and crispier (found in the Asian food section at the market).  Bought fresh crab from the store and made the following adjustments on the next round. I also added a bit of lemon juice, soy sauce, and hot sauce for flavor. Mix all of the wet ingredients together first then carefully mix in crab so that it doesn't break into small pieces. Excellent!

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I made these last night - but I didnt have real lump crab.  I had to use the imitation crab, because I just couldnt wait to try this. I know that for purists that might be a mortal sin, but it turned out FANTASTIC.  My guy said "it's the best thing I have ever eaten in my life" Now I have to go out and get the real lump crab - which will probably curl his hair :) and get me flowers :) Thanks!

Followed the recipe and they are awesome!! Have eaten them over and over.  Will serve to company.  For the saltine crackers I used whole wheat.  4 cans of jumbo lump crab meat make a pound of crab meat. Made 7 LARGE cakes.  Does not need sauce but would be nice for company. Sprayed them with pam and flipped at 10 minutes broiled an additional 5 minutes on a middle rack.  I don't like them as dark as in the picture.

Great flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, and had difficultly with the first flip of the cakes (as they were falling apart and sticking to the spatula). After removing from the oven when done, I let them stand for a few minutes and then hads no difficulty removing patties. Served them over pasta with a bit of parmesean, basil, olive oil, and crushed pepper--fiance loved it. I will most certainly make them again.

The cooking time under the broiler was way too long.  I set my timer for the first side and about halfway through they were already black.  The flavor under the burnt outer layer was ok, but nothing exciting.

This was amazing!  It tasted just like the real thing.  Mine came out just a tad burned, so I'll broil a little less next time.

I made these for Valentines day and they were a huge hit with my very picky husband.  I cute the mayo in 1/2 and used one egg.  They held together great and tasted awesome!

Amazing crab cakes! My husband is a huge seafood lover and he loved these. He said that they were the best he has ever had - at home or at a restaurant. My husband claims he added a bit more brown mustard to give it a bit more spicy taste, but he loved it just as much. We will be making this again!

I followed the advice of other reviews and reduced the mayo to 1/2 cup and then added an egg. They came out really dry and really bland. I even added cayenne pepper,lemon zest and green onions. I think I prefer my crab cakes pan fried and dredged in bread crumbs instead. It seemed like a waste of crab for me.

My husband is from MD and I make these every few months.  They are delicious.  You have to be careful when turning them b/c mine have had a tendancy to break apart.  Using two spatulas to turn has helped and also allowing them to get pretty crispy before turning them.  Enjoy!
Thanks for the recipe,
Laura

Wonderful!!!  I have tried several recipes trying to please my husband who has wonderful memories of Maryland crab cakes.  This finally did it!!!  As others, I cut mayo in half and added 2 eggs plus 1/4 cup red pepper. Thanks for the recipe!!!  Note:  These are very nice accompanied by "Crab Cake Sauce" also available on allrecipes.com, submitted by Joan.

The crab cakes were ok but pretty blah.  I followed others' advice anc cut down on the saltines by using club crackers and adding a little cayenne and some diced red bell pepper with a little dab o buter on top, and also an additional egg for cohesiveness.  Also used extra Old Bay seasning. We ate them ( they were not horrible ) but had two extra and tossed them out as no one --including me--was interested.  I later found a recipe for 'spicy crab cakes' which is wonderful  and has the taste we desire.

We enjoyed this recipe. All of the adults who tried it agreed that there was "something" missing in the flavor department. I used lowfat mayonaise because that was all that I had. That may have been the reason why it wasn't quite as flavorful as we would have liked. I followed the advice of another reviewer of this recipe by using a 1/4 cup measuring cup to portion the crab cake mixture and it was a great idea.

I followed the recs to reduce mayo to 1/2c and use half bread crumbs and have crackers.  I didn't have Old Bay so I substituted a mixured of 'cinamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt, peper, creole seasoning, garlic, red pepper and paprika'  I think it was close enough.  I enjoyed the cakes and will make them again but I did find that 1/2 pat of butter on top made them just a little tastier and moist

I cup the mayo to 1/2 a cup and added 2 eggs. I also did only 1/2 cracker crumbs and half bread crumbs.They came out looking beautiful but were a bit bland. They need something to give it more flavor. My kids did not like it. Not sure I would make it again.

After reading the other reviews, I reduced the mayonnaise to ½ cup, added 1 egg and used breadcrumbs instead of crushed crackers. The crab cakes were wonderful. In my broiler, 7 minutes per side was perfect.

I tried this recipe last night. It was my first time making crab cakes- which I LOVE- and it was pretty good. My variations: Used half claw and half special crab meat b/c of cost - don't think it made a difference; did half miracle whip and half mayo to limit calories- that was fine; used breadcumbs as suggested by other reviewers to limit salt; added more old bay and a little tony romas for added flavor; and sprayed the pan.

So overall the taste was really good and I liked the toasted/baked touch. Very light and non-oily.
But they did fall apart. I think next time I will try to add a little liquid egg white to see what happens. I made smaller cakes (12). But I would definitely make it again. It would be perfect if it stayed together.

I didn't really care for these.  Maybe I measured the ingredients wrong, but they were too wet and didn't hold their shape.  Even after broiling they weren't firm enough for my taste.  I also felt like they were lacking in flavor.  I did use canned crab though, so maybe that was part of it.

I have made plenty of crab cakes and nothing ever satisfied my taste....UNTIL I made this!  The BEST I have ever made!  My wife and kids LOVED it, my mother-in-law LOVE it, even raved to others how good it was.  Made for Christmas EVE and it was a tremendous success.  Thank you for this recipe.

Only had crab cakes once before and I think these turned out almost as good as the ones from the restuarant.  I used bread crumbs instead of saltines and added a dash or two salt.  They didn't stick together very well...is this normal??  Very simple and tasty.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks

I have made these for more than a year now and just love them. I sweat the onions and celery before hand and use dijon instead of brown mustard, but other than that, exactly as written. I serve it with mayo mixed with capers and it's always a hit.

Way too much crab, not enough breading.  It was, however, very easy to make, and I loved the fact that they are broiled and not fried.  If I could rate a 3.5, I would. Will probably not make these again.

I made these crabcakes for a large family dinner and everyone loved them, especially the ones who are picky crabcake eaters!  Interestingly, I put in, by accident, Bells Seasoning instead of Old Bay - No one could tell and again, everyone loved them.  I am making them again this weekend.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm so confused by the raves for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly but the crab cakes were dry and did NOT hold together whatsoever. And we didn't think the taste was restaurant quality either. I was very disappointed because of all the great reviews! It was a passable recipe, but not 5 star.

I didn't have any saltines so I added breadcrumbs instead and these turned out pretty well.  They didn't fall apart, but I tried frying them instead of broiling and I found they were cooked on the top and bottom but not all the way through.  (I think that's my fault for putting the heat too high.)  I will try these again and see if I fare better next time.  I also used the Costco canned crab and I thought they needed some more crabbiness to them so next time I will mix with some imitation crab meat chopped small and see if that helps intensify their flavour.  I think fresh crab meat would be the best choice but being that that isn't readily available here (without spending a small fortune) I kind of have to make do with what  I can get.  Worth trying!  I served with horseradish marmalade mixture.

Fabulous! 
I halved the amount of mayonnaise, added an egg and fried them. Next time I'm going to add a touch more Old Bay since we like things on the spicy side, but don't want to overwhelm the crab flavor. This was so, so good!

Great recipe!  I pan-fried them in butter rather than broiling them.  I am pleased to have found a recipe that doesn't use eggs!  Thank you!

I made these with three cans of crab. My parents loved it and my mom took the recipe home with her. We did find them to be a little salty though. Next time will cut back on the Old Bay.

I made these for my grandmother's 80th bday party.  They were a bit hit! Everyone loved them.  I made them "mini" and omitted the celery.  I also pan fried them a bit before I put them in the broiler.

These crab cakes were easy to make.  I really liked that they are broiled instead of fried.  They tasted very moist and had a great flavor.

My husband loved these and ate 3 of them! These are very easy to prepare and broil.  I served them with rice and green beans.

These were good but not like the kind that you get in a resturant like others have rated.

Even using reduced-sodium, saltines, these crabs cakes were too salty and overwhelmed by the taste of onion and celery. Instead, try using fresh breadcrumbs, 2 Tbs. minced onion and 2 Tbs. minced celery.
