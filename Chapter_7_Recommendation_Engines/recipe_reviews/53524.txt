This is such a great recipe!  I lived in Thailand for a year -- this is just like the kind of delicious chicken sold by street vendors all over Thailand.  The chili sauce is key!  Note: If you want a short cut, you can buy it in asian groceries. The Thai name is "Nam Jem", but it's often sold as "sweet chili sauce for chicken."  The Vietnamese name for this sauce is "Nuoe cham ga."  We always have a bottle of it on hand!

Very good, strong flavor.  The dipping sauce is perfect.  Make sure you follow the recipe on it, though.  I thought it would be too thin, so I simmered it longer and it turned into a really tasty, but thick (the consistency of thick honey) concoction after it cooled.

I'm not even close to being an allstar cook, but when I made this for my husband, his mind was blown. The marinade was so awesome I had to sample the chicken even though I am a lifetime vegetarian!!! Now I'm going to try it out with tofu also.  And the dipping sauce can't be beat... just don't put your face over the steaming pan as you are making it-- trust me on this one. Thank you Michelle for submitting this ten-star recipe!

Quoted from 2 sources tonight, "This chicken is awesome." I made kabobs from marinated boneless skinless breasts (because thats what I had). Love the marinade - will definitely make again! Thanks!

This chicken recipe is delicious!  I think the key, though, is a long marinating time.  Not by choice, I ended up marinating chicken thighs for 2 1/2 days.  Wow!  Fabulous flavor!!

This chicken is AWESOME! I used drumsticks; next time will try it using wings. Great for parties because it tastes good served at room temp, too.

This was terrific.  I ended up marinating the chicken for 3 days, wow!  My only disapointment was that I did not find the coconut milk to have really lent it's flavor to the meat.  Next time, I will make some extra marinade and baste the chicken as it cooks.  We really liked the dipping sauce (also poured it on the basmati rice I had made for this meal, yum!) I found there was a "mising link" between the chicken and the sauce. It liked it's sweetness, but I think next time, I will tie the 2 items together by adding fresh ginger both to the marinade and to the dipping sauce.

Pretty good chicken recipe. My husband used chicken breasts instead of half a chicken and marinated them in the curry mixture overnight. Next time he says he'd cut the amount of fish sauce in half because it made the chicken pretty salty. The dipping sauce is a thin (watery) sauce, but that's not uncommon for Vietnamese and Thai dishes. Overall, the dish had good flavor and was easy to make. Just reduce the fish sauce in the marinade!

I found this an interesting way to marinate chicken and the flavours were quite pleasant.  I put in extra cumin so that spice seemed stronger than any other flavour.  I used a whole can of coconut milk, and even though it marinated overnight it didn't seem to come through.  However, it created a very tender piece of meat and in the future I might play with the level and combination of ingredients.  I used chicken breast meat and cut them into bite-sized pieces and skewered them over the grill.  The sauce didn't seem to have as much appeal.  The flavour from the chicken itself is probably good enough to stand on its own.

Yummy--
I did make some changes-- used plain yogurt in place of coconut milk in the marinade. I also preferred to leave the breasts whole for grilling. 
Also, I used ground fresh chili paste which may be similar to minced chili.
Very good recipe with the sauce being particularly delicious-- thanks.

This was delicious. I used boneless breasts for the chicken and replaced the bird's eye chile with red pepper flakes (don't think I can get those here) but otherwise made as written. The sauce was really thin, but it tastes great and goes really well with the chicken.

make sure to reduce the sauce until it's red.  Otherwise it is waaay to vinegarry (if that's even a word)  Other than that (which was totally my fault) this was a great blend of flavors!!

The flavor of the chicken seemed to contrast with the flavor of the dipping sauce. I really did enjoy the dipping sauce though...

Awesome, I cut down the white pepper out of personal preference.  Had friends over and everyone raved about it.  Served it with coconut rice and Asian slaw.

Pretty good. Worth trying. I marinated for 24 hours but would recommend longer if possible. I used chicken thigh parts and lifted the skin to get the marinade under there. We grilled them. Yum! I was not crazy about the sauce and they were plenty flavorful and moist without.

Hubby gave this a 9.75 out of 10 - loved it!  I doubled the marinade, and I doubled the dipping sauce.  I didn't have birds eye chili so I substituted 1 tsp Cayenne Pepper and a couple of tablespoons of jarred cayenne chillis, cut up into little pieces.  I used chicken breasts cut into strips and stir fried because I was worried I'd over-do the chicken on the grill.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It would probably be more stars if I had marinated chicken longer.  It didn't seem to have much flavor.  But the dipping sauce, while stinking up my entire house, was awesome.  I will probably double or triple that next time.  We loved it.

This was a great recipe! I didn't even get to marinade the chicken for 4 hours +...I only got 30 minutes, and the chicken was great! Thinking of using it for a marinade for chicken kabobs next time!
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was Great!! Was a bit worried that the garlic would be to much, but came out with a nice and not over powering flavour. I didn't make the sauce, but went for a brand name bottled Thai Garlic Chile sauce served over cool rice with chopped cilantro and added some peanut sauce on the side as well.  Like another reviewer put on skewers over the bbq. Think will try in salad with some peanuts and mandrin orange slices.

The dipping sauce is phenomenal!  And the chicken isn't bad either ;)  I think next time I will make the chicken on skewers or make something like chicken fingers.

Absolutely delicious.  We frequently bake it in the oven rather than grilling, but both ways are great.

This was delicious!  I cut the chicken into 1" pieces before marinating and only marinated one day.  I put the pieces on skewers for grilling and recoated with the marinade about halfway through cooking.  I also substituted a serrano pepper for the bird's eye chile.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and was really happy with the results.  The chicken was very juicy and tender and the sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  My husband loved it as well; we ended up with no leftovers!

Excellent!  Use less or no water in the dipping sauce or it's too thin.

15 years later, I am still a HUGE fan of this recipe & keep coconut milk in the pantry just for this! (The dollar store now carries it - can't beat the $1 price tag!) I've grown to really appreciate cilantro- fresh is better but dried will do ok in this recipe. I use bone-in chicken thighs & marinate at least 2 days in the fridge, then outside grilling is a must. One shortcut: Frank's Red Hot Sweet Chile Dipping Sauce is a close second to this one by Michelle.

Original review:
WOW! This chicken is identical to the Gai Yang from my favorite Thai restaurant!  It's so tender and flavorful.  I skipped the cilantro (not a fan of it) and there was plenty of zing from the other spices. I served with jasmine rice. The dipping sauce needed some extra sugar.  I've been looking for this recipe for years!  THANK YOU MICHELLE!

This was amazing. I used chicken thighs and followed the directions exactly. Everyone loved it. Well... I used some Korean chilies instead of the birdie peppers it called for. Very good!

I didn't change much except for one key ingredient! I don't eat chicken, so I replaced chicken with extra firm tofu and baked it in the oven instead of grilling. It was absolutely amazing! I only had time to marinate the tofu for a half hour, and I kept the leftover marinade and heated it up to pour over the cooked tofu. I will definitely make this again!

One of the best dipping sauces I've ever made. Could be good for other things like eggrolls. Yummy chicken too. Thanks Michelle

This recipe is a sure-fire crowd pleaser.  I have made it three times now, always with rave reviews.  I like to marinate for at least one day, but have actually been known to leave in marinade for up to three days and it still tastes perfect.  I like to buy high-quality chicken breasts, which seems to make them stay more moist.  They don't even need the dipping sauce, but I make my sauce super spicy for those guests who love a kick.

Love everything from this recipe! The chicken tasted great - I used chicken thighs instead and I didn't grill them because I don't like the charred parts that comes with grilling... Cooked them in the skillet and broiled them for a short while to finish it off. I like the chile dipping sauce too although I cut the sugar to 2tbsp as I figured I could add more if I wanted to later and found I didn't need to. Also, used red pepper flakes instead as I didn't have the bird's eye chile. All worked out well for a great chicken dish!

My family really enjoyed this dish and we especially enjoyed the dipping sauce. I didn't know what bird's eye chile is so I subsituted with red chile flakes and I used baker's sugar (very fine sugar). I will definately make this again but next time I will double the dipping sauce. Thank you Ms. Chen, this is a great addition to our grilling recipes.

Excellent Recipe - I reccommend also adding just a squeeze of LIME to the chicken before serving it...it really gives the flavor a kick.  We skipped the dipping sauce though.  Thank you...our whole family enjoyed this very much :-)
