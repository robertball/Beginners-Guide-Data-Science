I had this exact drink recipe when I went down to New Orleans in the summer. Apparently, it's quite a popular (and better!) alternative to the traditional summer mojito. The cucumber is a must! The lemon, in my opinion, can be substituted for lime or orange. Delicious!

This is my summer drink! Love it with 7-up or sprite sometimes instead of the ginger ale. Add a cucumber spear (sliced lengthwise) to follow the true British way of enjoying a Pimm's. VERY refreshing!

Enjoyed this very much. It’s quite refreshing. I didn’t use the garnish.
