THE KIDS LOOOOVED THIS! (ages 8, 7, 6). Next time I will "hide" some spinach, since they asked for more and more. I didn't have prego; I had Trader Joe's organic tomato and basil marinara, which already had "green spots" in it, so I can up it a notch next time. This should surely make the list in Kid Friendly Recipes!

This is a good, basic recipe (especially if you have picky eaters). However, those of us with a more mature palate definitely need to dress this up a bit. I added a dash of cumin, a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and a light sprinkle of garlic powder. I also nuked two hot dogs, sliced 'em, and tossed them in as well. Reminds me of good ol' "mac and cheese with dogs" that I pretty much lived on as a kid. Great recipe base- the possibilities to jazz this up are pretty much endless. Thanks for sharing.
