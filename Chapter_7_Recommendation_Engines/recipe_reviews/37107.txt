i liked the spice combo for this.  I used it on a Boston butt pork roast in my Turbo Cooker... 3/4 cup of sugar turned out to be too much... but i loved the flavoring... it was very very nice!

Nice change from mushroom sauce or shake n bake.  If you are using a gas oven don't cook for quite as long and defintely foil your pan for easier clean up!

Compared to other recipes that pair brown sugar with pork this is much sweeter.  It might be good on a cold snowy night but it was too sweet for my family.

Husband really liked this. My steaks were a bit bigger, so I probably should have adjusted the spices accordingly, as I thought there wasn't quite enough salt to balance the sweet and next time I will probably add a little pinch of cayenne for a slight kick and a little more flavor depth. Overall though, it was very tasty!  I didn't use a grill rack and just drained the liquid off my baking sheet whenever I turned the meat. That worked fine. Plus, it allowed me to cover my pan in foil which made cleanup a breeze.  To speed it up a little, I did use the broiler on lower heat to do the final sugar glazing. That worked great. You just have to watch so you don't burn it.

Wonderful flavor and moist juicy meat. Nice change of pace from our usual baked pork chops. Have made this several times and will definitely make again.

I really liked it but some of my kids didn't.  It is sweet like honey glazed ham.

It tasted like candy on a meat and the cinnamon was overpowering,  Yuck!  I am confused how anyone could give this a positive review, apparently they have never had good pork but.  I'm sorry if I offend the person who created the recipe, but I don't want to see anyone else waste a good piece of meet, unless you have money to blow then by all means give it a try.

This recipe is amazing!!! My husband & I purchased pork steaks because our local grocery store was having a sale. Now, this is my husbands favorite pork meal! It's delicious!! I added a little water in the roasting pan just so the brown sugar wouldn't stick to my dish. At the end of cooking time, there was some really great gravy. I put some on the rice. Delish!!!
