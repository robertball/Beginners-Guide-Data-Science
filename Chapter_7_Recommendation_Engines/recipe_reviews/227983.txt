I made this today and it was super easy and delicious (even though it had to sit out uncooked for about two hours when the power went out, ha). I also substituted regular milk for unsweetened vanilla almond milk, which worked beautifully. We had family friends come over and they all loved it. Thanks for the recipe; I'll definitely be saving it.

Tasty, but in a 9x13 pan there is no way this takes an hour to bake! Granted I had to use canned blackberries today, but it was golden brown and DONE in 30 min.  It's a keeper recipe, though!

Good but not the best.
