This is a great summer recipe - quick, fresh tasting and delicious too!  I used thin chicken breasts so that the bacon and rosemary didn't get overdone.  The rosemary flavor is very subtle, with the bacon flavor being stronger.  It is an elegant dish that would be impressive for guests, but is simple enough to enjoy on a busy weeknight as well.

HOLY !!! Um.. SERIOUSLY... BEST chicken that's ever come off my grill. I dont like bacon, and I dont like rosemary, but this was FANTABULOUS!! I will be making this as often as possible. Oh, and I didnt have fresh rosemary, so I used dried rosemary and it was still perfect. The best part is all I have to keep on my grocery list is bacon and chicken. Garlic powder and rosemary are always in the cabinet. THANK YOU SKOO!!!

We made this exactly as written and it was so very good.  Don't let the amount of garlic powder scare you away!  We sprinkled 1tsp on each half breast (1/2 tsp on each side).  The bacon wasn't super crispy but that didn't take anything at all away from this.  We even accidentally lost track of time and the probe said 190 degrees...we panicked a got it off the grill asap and it was still moist and tasted great!!  VERY EASY!  Might try a different bacon next time for variety.

I made bundles so the rosemary would be completely enclosed...also added a sprig of lemon thyme inside. They were very good and moist

Also works on a stovetop grill. I cooked extra for planned leftovers. The best chicken/bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches. Also worked in salad.
This recipe has taught me a valuable lesson. Can't judge a recipe by stars rating alone. Can't believe someone would rate it poorly because they don't like an herb. I've cooked long enough to be able to look at a recipe and tell if it will taste good, as I'm sure most of us can. Thanks for posting this recipe, truly a keeper.

This was absolutely delicious! Made the breasts as the recipe directed, but made some thighs using some garlic grill shaker seasoning I had instead of the garlic powder and they turned out great as well. Served these with a sauce made of two parts dijon mustard and one part honey BBQ sauce. Yum, yum, yum!

Rosemary is terrible. This chicken tasted like it had run through a pine tree and got stuck there. I like the bacon and garlic on the chicken breasts, just that alone would have been so much better.

Skoo....you've hit a home run with this one!  To add even more flavor, I cut a slit in the middle of the chicken breast and stuffed two thin slices of goat cheese and 2 or 3 basil leaves.  From there I followed the recipe directions except I baked it in the oven at 350 for about 45 min.  Delicious!!

This was very good!  A perfect combination.  Rosemary is one of my favourite herbs to cook with.  The chicken came out moist and tender with a pleasing flavour.  I am not a fan of garlic powder so I made a rub with fresh minced garlic, freshly ground sea salt and pepper. Absolutely delish!  I would serve this to impress.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was quite delicious.  I had issues with keeping the bacon on the chicken while grilling, but I think I need to use a different bacon next time (for reference, I used Smithfields hickory smoked thick cut bacon).

I just made this today with "farmland thick cut bacon"( 1 pack has 12 slices) and 12 slices of chicken tenders/fillet. Did everything like the recipe stated but went easy on salt as I expect the bacon to be salty. As chicken tenders are quite slim compared with the entire breast, i could wrap/ encase the entire tender with one piece of bacon and secure ends with a toothpick.I also tuck in the ends of the tenders to ensure these do not dry out. I had no  grill and after consulting other recipes that bake chicken tenders, I Baked in oven on a baking tray oiled with butter for 8 mins each side at 425F( at the end it was internal temp of 185F!!) and broil for about 4 mins.
Very Yummy and delicious when just out from oven! Easy to prepare. Next time I will try adding a slice of cheese like the other review suggested.

Very simple and tasty recipe. Great for a weekday meal. I made one change. I used proscuitto instead of thick bacon. It sticks to the chicken without toothpicks, its less fat and still has that nice smokey bacon flavour.

I made this last night w/ turkey bacon, and chopped my fresh rosemary, and sprinkled it on my chicken before wrapping in bacon.  It was just too hot to grill, so I baked at 350 for an hour (they were pretty big breasts!) and they came out perfect!  The BF kept raving about how moist and juicy they were.  Will make again!

DELICIOUS!!  The flavor is amazing!  One of the best grilled chicken recipes I've ever made.  This is a keeper.  I can't wait for lunch to eat the leftovers.

I've been making this recipe for a while and never disappoints. I don't use any garlic salt or seasoning since the bacon itself give the chicken very good taste. Want to make it better? Put a slice of ham and/or Swiss cheese inside the chicken roll. Yummy!

I never knew that there was so many ways to fix chicken until I started using this site! I once served chicken every night for a week ( got a good sale) and nobody commented, "Chicken AGAIN?" But this recipe is by far the best tasting and simplest to make that I've tried! I have never used rosemary before and didn't know what to expect-- all I can say is "WOW!" I pounded the chicken to a uniform thickness, just not too thin. It was so moist and tender. I just can't wait to make this again!

Fantastic!  My sons (19 & 22) asked if we could have it again tomorrow.  I made one change.  I do not ever use garlic powder for anything, so I made a rub out of minced garlic, kosher salt and pepper.  A note concerning the reviewer who said it tasted like a pine tree - you have to remove the rosemary sprig before eating. The perfect chicken recipe, easy to prepare and quick to cook, tastes wonderful.

This recipe was good.  I liked the chicken with the rosemary and bacon flavors together and it was very easy to make.   The bacon was definitely the stronger flavor.  However, my husband and I prefer a little bolder, spicier flavors than this.  Next time we might add some cayenne or wrap a jalapeno with the rosemary.

Very yummy!  After the chicken was cooked/taken off the grill, we cut it in half the long way and put on a Tomato Focaccia bun with pesto and avocado on top.  Delicious!

This recipes is the epitome of "less is more." 4 ingredients, short prep and cook time with delicious results. I can see myself making this several times during the grilling season. I grow my own rosemary on my balcony in a pot.

Made this just to try something new.  My family loved it.  My 7 y/o daughter who likes most things, her face lit up when she tried it. My 5 y/o son, who likes far less, raved about it, then cleaned his plate. 

A nice quick, easy recipe when you don't have much time, or just feel like making it easy.

This is quite good prepared as written.  Be aware that if you use dried rosemary to replace the fresh sprigs that the rosemary flavor is much more pronounced than with the fresh sprige.  If you don't like rosemary this is probably NOT the recipe for you.  To the reviewer who complained of rubbery skin -- READ THE RECIPE because it calls for bonesless SKINLESS chicken breasts!  Common sense should have told you not to expect crispy skin if  you wrapped the chicken with skin INSIDE the bacon!  If you want to use skin on chicken (and I have used skin-on boneless thighs with good results) chop the bacon up and roll it it inside with the rosemary.  This really does need to be grilled on an outdoor or open grill, not made in the oven or on a foreman-type grill.  If you choose to preparation by oven you will need a very high temperature -- 450 or so -- so be prepaered for the smoke (and possible smoke detector alert)!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used no garlic powder as my dh does not like garlic and just used salt and pepper.  It was still terrific.  I would recommend using a thicker cut of bacon because all I had was the regular and it was hard to get it to stay in place.  Loved the rosemary flavor, but if you don't like rosemary don't choose this recipe.

LURVE it! Thanks so much for this recipe. We are constantly grilling and this was super easy, and really tasty! My husband even asked me what I seasoned it with and I said "duh, bacon." He said "I had one of the ones that didn't have bacon, it was really seasoned well." I then remembered the garlic. We are huge garlic lovers, but I've never thought of just sprinkling straight up garlic on. We loved it! I just realized I forgot the s&p, oh well, successful dinner for me!! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I loved this!  The bacon stayed on a lot easier than I was expecting.  It had great presentation.  I served it with roasted brussels spouts, pairs, red onion, pecans, & fresh thyme sprigs, served over rice.  I will make this one again!

ok, no one in my family liked this.  the skin was still kinda 'rubbery', because the bacon around it is what got crisp.  so the bacon was good.  the skin was nasty.  the rosemary under the skin was not something any of us eat, unless it's chopped up or something kinda small, but using a whole twig of it, we had to remove it, then it was just like eating, crispy grilled bacon, rubbery chicken skin and plain chicken legs.  many thumbs down all around the table.

Pretty good but the rosemary was pretty overpowering where the sprig was attached. Think I might try one reviewer's suggestion where they made tin foil bundles so that it is scattered throughout the bundle instead of tied to one location. Good flavor though.

Very delicious with very easy prep and no cleanup! Great recipe! Remember to take the rosemary out before eating, I made the mistake of getting a huge bite of it...and the flavor is a bit much. My Husband and kids (age 6, 3, and 2) liked it as well.

I love rosemary with chicken, and then add bacon . . . well . . . need I say more.  Because I didn’t have thick cut bacon I sliced the chicken halves lengthwise and then wrapped them with the regular cut bacon.    I turned them often to keep the bacon from flaring and used an instant read thermometer so not to overcook them.  They came out perfect and had that great rosemary flavor.  We thought it was a great dish.

This recipe was perfect just the way it is written! Absolutely DELICIOUS! Easy to prepare, the rosemary goes beautifully with the chicken breast, and it also came out delightfully juicy too! We really did enjoy our meal. I served it with rice pilaf. Yum! Outstanding recipe! Thanks Skoo!

Just wanted to Thank Skoo for the great recipe! Chicken was moist and tender and very flavorful!So simple to prepare a head of time. I found that making it and letting the herbs blend together with the bacon infused all the flavors.You think that it is to much garlic but it is just enough.Also works great for those indoor griddle/grills without having to use the outside grill.

I slit the breasts and tucked three asparagus spears in each before wrapping them in bacon and rosemary.  Delicious!  Cut medallions with cold leftovers the next day for sandwiches.  Also delicious, and pretty.

This recipe tasted good (what doesnt taste good wrapped in bacon!} & was very easy to make but I didnt hink that it had enough flavor.  I think next time I would add some sliced garlic with the rosemary.  I think that I liked the leftovers better because I sliced them up and used them in wraps, bacon chicken clubs! I would make this again but would try adding a little something extra.

This is a very simple recipe anyone can do! I used turkey bacon and broiled the chicken (my gas grill was out of propane) it was still delicious with the modifications. I also used shish kabob skewers to keep the bacon wrapped around the chicken and it stayed put.

Quick and easy to prepare and tasty.  Next time I make this dish I would like to cut pockets in the chicken and add a rich creamy cheese.  Or I will prepare and cook it as directed let it cool, slice into "rings" and then pour cheese over the top to garnish.  Only use the freshest rosemary, otherwise it is like biting into a piece of tree.  This flames up VERY easy while cooking. Yes I will make this again.

I make a different version of this recipe. I use  jalapeo in place of rosemary & thinly sliced the chicken breast before making the wraps. The taste is fantastic.

This was really good, but unfortunately I didn't have good thick bacon so that flavour wasn't very strong, will do better next time, Costco maple bacon would be wonderful with it.  Also next time I would use real garlic, minced.  This recipe could be used as a base recipe too, onions, a bit of curry all kinds of options.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are really flavorful. I wouldn't change a thing. My chicken breast were pretty big, so I pounded them so they were thinner and easier to roll. I used three pieces of bacon and 4 toothpicks  each.

This is a wonderful easy recipe.  Also, I always like to use my green/red/yellow bell peppers from the garden, quarter or half them, stuff the chicken inside and wrap the bacon around securing with a toothpick.  Grill it that way, it is wonderful

This was just "OK" for us.  I too, used thin chicken breasts, and even grilled it on low, but the bacon was still too rubbery to enjoy. I was afraid the chicken would dry out if I cooked it on a higher setting. Probably wont make it again since we're trying to eat healthier.

This chicken recipe is so delicious! I made it tonight for dinner, and DH raved about how good it was.  I had reservations about the amount of garlic powder, but it was not overpowering at all. A definite "make-again" recipe.  Thanks Skoo!

Not as good as I thought they were going to be.  They were good, but my family was not raving.  I will probably try them one more time and if nothing is different will probably take it off my radar.

Excellent recipe.  As others suggested I used sliced garlic cloves and fresh sage with the rosemary.  I also used kosher salt.  This one will definitely be added to the regular rotation! Thanks Skoo!

Served these up for a few of our friends.  Apparently they will never turn down a dinner at our place again.  Chicken came out juicy.  The rosemary was a little strong for my liking, but that is an easy enough fix.

The rosemary gave it a great flavor, they cooked perfectly on the grill, the bacon didn't burn, it was a little salty for my taste but it's a great recipie. I would recomend it :)

We loved this - don't skimp on the garlic powder, follow the recipe.  Will make it for guests next time.  Flavor belies the simplicity of the recipe.

The rosemary taste was too much for my family.  We baked it instead - they would prefer poultry seasoning next time,  My son said it tasted like keibasa

Great taste, easy, quick to prepare! What more could you ask for?!

I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and doubled up on bacon slices because my chicken breasts were a bit large (from Costco)... but those were my only tweaks. Will make this one again and again!

I used boneless chicken thighs and this recipe was fantastic.  Grilled on the grill along with fresh yellow squash, green bell pepper, onions and mushrooms.
Also corn on the cob and a capreze salad!  Superior!

We didn't have a grill and you most certainly need one for this recipe -- making it on the stove top is too difficult. However, this is an awesome dish and it is delicious.

My boyfriend taught me this recipe last summer (without the rosemary) and he called them "Fly-away Birds". When asking why, he told me to watch what happens when they come off the grill .... guests didn't even wait for them to cool!!! So delicious!! 
I am making them in the oven tonight because it is raining out, and I'm trying some other reviewer suggestions ... lets see how they turn out! :)

The bacon really helps keep the chicken from drying out.  And, of course, everything tastes better with bacon.  Yum!

Very good recipe, wasn't sure what rosemary tasted exactly like but between that and the bacon, the chicken had lots of flavors and was delicious and easy to make.  I had larger chicken breasts so I actually split each breast into two, cutting the fat end in two.  Used 1 piece of bacon to wrap each breast and came out great!

Was pretty good. Didn't have fresh Rosemary, so I used the dried... I was not able to BBQ so I pan fried it. It was tasty.  However, had I followed the recipe to the T....it would have been a five star....I"m sure of it.

Very tasty and moist, even for the leftovers. Only thing I changed was adding garlic cloves with the rosemary, under the bacon. I also used peppered, regular-sliced bacon. Next time I won't used the peppered and will probably still used the regular-sliced bacon instead of thick cut. The bacon was nice an crispy this way.

I prefer my chicken with some sauce or gravy, otherwise I would have probably rated this as a 5.

Excellent Dish****I used whole garlic cloves instead of powder.  I halved the breast and then cut a slit.  I put the garlic cloves in the slit and Rosemary on top and wrapped with peppered bacon.

It was VERY simple an delicious.  I followed the instructions except I put garlic salt together instead of Garlic powder and salt.  BTW my husband hates chicken and he loved it.  The rosemary really makes the difference and the bacon of course :)

I cooked this chicken in the oven instead of the grill.  I also used turkey bacon as a healthier alternative.  Overall my family enjoyed it.  It was good, but not great.

Not as wonderful as I thought it would be.  Will do it again if I happen to have the ingredients sitting around.

Cooked as recommended - chicken was somewhat bland and was extremely dry. Not impressed by this recipe at all. I doubt I'll ever make this again.

This has fantastic flavor and gave me a reason to use the fresh rosemary I have been growing. I butterflied the chicken breast because they were the small flash-frozen ones. The grill crisped the bacon nicely and I am impressed with the calorie count, given the bacon and flavor. My chicken did get a little dry, but that was my fault because it was difficult to tell when it was ready.

I tried baking this, because I was too lazy to bring out the grill.  It was pretty good, but I think I overcooked it.  Next time I'll improve.

Very tasty. I don't care for rosemary and didn't have it on hand, so I used fresh basil.  It was delicious. The bacon makes the chicken so moist. Will definately make again.

While I really liked this dish, It didn't bowl me over for 5 stars.  Yes, it was good - love the chicken and bacon combo (anytime you can cook with bacon is a PLUS!), but it's not so fantastic I have to have it again later this month.  It'll go in my recipe book as "something different" when I need a change.

I like to follow a recipe exactly as it is written the first time I make it, THEN decide if I want to make any changes for the next time I prepare it. I have become very particular about recipes since changing my dietary habits 3 years ago (whole foods, gluten free by choice, no processed foods), and this recipe is wonderful as it is written; simple, healthy, and delicious....definitely a keeper! The second time I made this recipe I used fresh, minced garlic because as Italians, my family loves garlic! I also always use thin chicken breasts  (cutlets) when making any recipe that calls for chicken breasts.

The fam loved this chicken!  Will use less garlic powder next time, as it was a bit much for me.  I made one addition by spreading some herb goat cheese directly on top of the chicken before the rosemary, then rolled up the chicken and wrapped  the bacon around it - fabulous!

Very easy to make and tasty too!  Rubbed with sea salt, minced garlic and pepper mixture and placed on a cookie sheet rubbed with olive oil.  (  I had to cook in the oven since we do not  have a grill at this time. ) Baked it at 425 degrees 8 minutes on each side.    Served with wild rice and roasted brussel sprouts.

So good and no extra garnishment or marinating. Just put the rosemary on top of the chicken overnight in the fridge in the container I had put the chicken in and then wrapped with bacon and grilled. Doesn't get much easier than that! So yummy!! Guest worthy.

This was absolutely delicious! We used regular bacon instead of thick cut because that's what we had (3 halves per breast), and it was perfect. We cut a slit in each chicken breast to put the rosemary in so it would be better secured, and it worked great.

We loved this recipe. It was easy and delicious.  After cooking, I pulled out the rosemary sprig so my son wouldn't fuss, but I kept mine in, and it was very tasty either way.  The only change I made was splitting the breast into two pieces and wrapping finger like pieces of chicken with bacon rather than the whole breast.  The smaller size was perfect.  We will definitely make this again.

I can't wait to try this. Love the idea of also adding a sprig of thyme. Skoo I am so jealous of you having so much Rosemary. I wanted to grow herbs this year, but didn't yet and I'm not sure how to start. Guess I could look it up online.

Made this recipe for Memorial Day.  I only made a couple of minor changes due to what I had on hand.  I used boneless skinless chicken strips, putting two together when I wrapped it in bacon.  I put the rosemary between the strips.  The second change was that I used some Honey Bourbon flavored bacon I got at Walmart.  It was delicious!  The meat was moist and flavorful because of the garlic powder, bacon and rosemary.  I got a thumbs up from the family so I will be making this again.

Very good recipe. I used chicken tenderloin pieces and wrapped a 1/2 slice of thick cut bacon around each 1, along with a sprig of rosemary. I'm always looking for new ideas to incorporate rosemary in recipes. I love it. Thanks Skoo for a great recipe.

This was just ok for us. It was nice and juicy and cooked very well with the bacon wrapped around. But we just didn't love the taste.  It was kind of like diet food minus the bacon... not bad but I probably wouldn't make this again which will please my 20 year old son who said his mouth tasted like a pine forest after eating!

Tried this dish out and LOVED it. Didn't change anything except for using 2 slices of bacon around my chicken instead of one. MORE BACON = MORE YUMMY! :)

This came off the grill moist and full of flavor. We did cook it to 165.  The bacon was a bit rubbery, but still good.

Loved this quick and easy recipe.  I used 2 pounded breasts cut in half lengthwise to make 4 smaller rolls.  When placing the Rosemary sprig inside I left about 1/3 of the bottom end of the sprig sticking out the side.  After rolling with the bacon the portion of the sprig sticking out was used to hold the bacon on (1 bacon stip per roll.)  Used indirect heat on the BBQ grill - watched closely and turned every few minutes.  Wonderful flavor and will make again soon.

Yummm...This was so easy and good! My 5 & 3yr old are picky with chicken but they ate every bite and some of mine! My husband was pleasantly surprised how moist the chicken was. Will definately make again and for company!

This was ok. It was nice and juicy. I just didn't love the taste. I didn't feel like the rosemary and bacon went to together well. I probably won't make it again.

This recipe is delicious and easy. I didn’t have enough boneless breasts, so I used one bone-in and just started it earlier, closing the lid and turning the grill heat to low. I also sprayed the breasts with avocado oil spray before wrapping them in the bacon and seasoning them. This prevented sticking to the grates. Both styles were delicious! I did watch carefully to make sure the bacon didn’t flare up, especially with the lid closed. Great flavors!

These were really good.  I think this would make a nice elegant dinner.  I used BLSL thighs instead and cooked them in the oven.  I put a cast iron skillet in the oven so the meat would sizzle.  It took closer to 25 minutes to cook.  I put them under the broiler for just a few minutes at the end to crisp up the bacon.

Made this on the bbq grill with fresh rosemary from the garden. Don’t think it would do as well if cooked in the kitchen. It was amazingly delicious for such a straightforward and quick dish. The whole family gobbled them down and asked for more.

Always put lemon juice over my chicken wrapped in bacon then sprinkle it with the rosemary. I also like to rub my chicken pieces in Olive  oil after seasoning.  And the smaller the chicken bites wrapped in bacon, the better to my family! I've been making this for years and I was curious if other people knew this recipe. Family favorite

I enjoy the flavor of rosemary so I thought I'd give this a try.  I had some costco bacon in the freezer which I got out at 4:00 pm for a 6:30 dinner.  The bacon defrosted easy enough and the only change I did was to use fresh garlic as I don't like the flavor of dried.  Just chopped it up then added a pinch of kosher salt and smashed it into a garlic paste.  Put that on the chicken following the rest of the instructions.  Okay, I did use a blow torch to crisp up the parts of the bacon that the grill didn't get to, but I like my bacon crispy and it was great.  This is a keeper

These turned out beautifully!!! So delicious!!! I stuffed them with goat cheese and baked them in the oven uncovered in a 300° oven for 1 hour. Then baked them at 350° for 20 minutes to let the bacon get crispy. My family loved these!!! I made nappa cabbage as a side dish.  Super yummy!!!

Was very good.  However, you need to really watch carefully.  The bacon will easily burn if you are not paying attention.  Happened with one of the chicken breast.  Grease from the bacon created flares up in the grill, burning the bacon and over-crisping the chicken.

I made it exactly as written except I used two strips of bacon per chicken breast. Regardless, it was very, very bland. The chicken was moist though and had a nice muted flavor from the bacon and rosemary and garlic powder. For plain grilled chicken, this is a nice change from the usual, but I will likely not make this again. If I were to make it again, I would likely make it with skin-on boneless chicken thighs for more flavor.

I followed the recipe as it was written,  I cooked it on a cast iron griddle so it did need to cook longer than the 8 min per side, took more like 12 to 15 per side at med high.  It was juicy and did have a terrific flavor. My family of 4 shared 1 and 1/2 of the 4 piece we cooked. Me and my husband are looking forward to using up the left overs!

Typically I find boneless, skinless chicken breasts to be dry and tasteless when compared to bone-in breasts or thighs, however these were juicy, tasty and easy to prepare.  Will make this recipe again.

This was awesome and very easy. I didnt use all the garlic powder as it seemed a bit much and im glad I didn't as it was just the right amount. I probably used 3/4 tsp per breast. It was a big hit and definitely a do-over in this house.

Made this one exactly as written,  other that cooking with indirect heat. Paired it with the fettuccine with sweet pepper and cayenne sauce found here : 
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17702/fettuccine-with-sweet-pepper-cayenne-sauce/
since we had ingredients left over from the night before.
We will definitely keep both dishes in the rotation and if I did decide to change something it would be minor.

I generally don't need toothpicks, but I can see how it might help in certain cases.  I also like to use fresh minced garlic instead.

My husband could not stop RAVING about what a great way this is to make chicken !!!!  We both thought the presentation (with the rosemary tucked between the chicken and the bacon) and the taste of this was PHENOMENAL !!!!!!  We eat a LOT of chicken, but this is our favorite by far !!!!  So simple to prep,,,, and DELICIOUS  to eat !!!!  Thank you for making this our new 'go-to' recipe involving chicken breasts !!!  : )

I used dry rosemary as our rosemary bush isn't as productive as the author's, with real garlic and onion powder, etc.  
The herbal qualities didn't come through and I think a lemon/lime garlic basil marinade would work better.  Addition of bacon is always a plus. :)

Easy and very good!  I brined my chicken for a few hours before grilling to keep it moist. Do not eat the rosemary! If you did and gave this a bad review, that's your error not the recipe.

I really did like this dish but did not feel it was 5 star worthy. It is certainly easy to make. My husband liked it, he says bacon makes everything taste good. It is, however, a good dish to have in your back pocket when you are late starting dinner and you want something quick and easy. I will make again.

This was great I followed the recipe except when it comes to seasonings I just add until it looks good.  Tasted great, good as leftovers also.  If you don't like rosemary you won't like it.

Delicious and so easy! I cut the chicken into thirds lengthwise and wrapped the strips individually. It made it easier to get the bacon browned well on all sides.

Made this according to the reviewer who's name is "gotrecipe?" Suggestion. Just 1 basil leave is plenty with the goat cheese and I cut the garlic powder in half.  They turned out beautiful in the oven.  Tender and delish.  I used Smithfield bacon. Regular cut.  No need to use thick when baking in the oven.  A new family favorite and when entertaining

Delicious recipe, I seasoned the chicken before I wrapped it as well as a little seasoning on top of the bacon, fresh herbs always work best, thanks for sharing.

This was fabulous.  I pounded the chicken and it made it easier to wrap the bacon.  I used dried rosemary instead of the sprigs and stuffed the chicken with cojack.  The company raved about it.

This was a big hit although I modified it quite a bit.  I used chicken tenders which I marinated for a couple of hours in olive oil and lime juice, rosemary, garlic powder, salt and lemon pepper.  I wrapped in prosciutto.  Grilled and put a piece of mozzarella on top at the end.  I served for company and everyone raved. Next time - and there will be a next time - I'll use goat cheese or something a bit more flavorful.

Super easy to make. I used thin cut chicken breasts, rosemary sprigs from the yard and thick cut maple bacon. Prep took about 15 min and cook for about 10-15 min over direct heat, turning often. Only deal is you have to babysit it, because the bacon grease will cause it to flame up and char parts of the chicken. Super juicy though.

I loved this recipe and it was so easy to make. I will say it took 3-4 pieces of bacon to wrap each breast, but the more bacon the merrier. I also used two rosemary sprigs per breast, one on the top and one on the bottom. Didn't feel like firing up the grill so opted for the cast iron skillet instead. Worked wonderfully.

This was delicious. I didn't have the opportunity to grill it tonight.  I seared it a couple minutes per side and then stuck it in the oven at 400 for ten minutes and it was great. I do love rosemary and bacon of course though.

Excellent recipe! However my chicken breasts where way too big to wrap a piece of bacon around so I cut the breast in half lengthwize and it worked much better. The first time I made this I didn't grease the BBQ grill.. big mistake - the bacon stuck to the grill... second time around was much better. I also used regular sliced bacon instead of thick  sliced. I didn't have fresh rosemary so I sprinkled some rosemary powder on the chicken before I wrapped them in bacon.

Chicken was good but the bacon wasn't crispy like I like it to me, which kind of disappointed the dish. I don't think I'll make this again.

It was difficult to cut into the chicken with the rosemary stem, since part of the stem was thick, too hard to cut through or eat. Also, though my bacon was not super thick, it seemed to not cook through enough all over. finally, do not use colored toothpicks, as the color leaches through to the chicken!

Love it! Simple and YUMMY!  The second time I made this I used an awesome garlic salt from Trader Joes instead of garlic powder and salt. I'll be cooking it again and might add some cheese in the middle. White cheddar sounds good! :-)

I didn't have fresh rosemary, used some dried rosemary seasoning instead, but it was still fantastic! My whole family loved it. Didn't take long to make either.

We had this tonight, and everyone loved it. Simple and easy to do. For my individual piece of chicken I added some fresh jalapeño. Oh my, oh my! For the rest of the fam I followed the recipe exactly. This will be added to our recipe rotation for sure!

I should have known this recipe would be great. Bacon and chicken are two of my favorite foods. My boyfriend and I kept asking each other why we had not thought of this combo sooner! Only change I made was to use less rosemary. Can wait to make it again!

Add me as a plus one to all the other positive reviews for this easy recipe. It is quick to put together and presents beautifully!

I made the classic chicken mistake and cooked it a little too long; thus, it was a tad dry, but still delicious. I will definitely try this again and monitor the internal temp a little more closely.

Cooking note: I cooked this stove top using my grill pan. A bit of olive oil in the pan with an extra sprig of rosemary just for good measure! Served with new potatoes and green beans!

Simple, delicious and very easy to make. The best part is that you don't have to let it marinade like other meats to be grilled. I added a pat of butter under the bacon. The boys inhaled it.

This was wonderful. I prepared exactly as written. The rosemary flavor was not overpowering and nicely complimented the bacon and garlic. This was a very simple dish to put together and impressive once done.

I made this with chicken thighs instead of breasts, and my only complaint was that I had dried rosemary, and I think I overdid it. The flavor was nice, and the bacon was a fun touch.

Amazing recipe.  I was nervous about the amount of garlic but it really does work.  I used toothpicks to hold the bacon on and its not the best idea.  The ends tend to burn off and then you have to dig for the piece that's still in the middle.  I'm going to use rosemary stem next time.

Absolutely LOVEd this!  I used tenderloins instead of breasts because that is what I had. Would use thin sliced bacon next time so it would get crispy. Going to try to figure out how to make it under the broiler so this can become an easy weeknight staple during the school year!!

This is delicious... but you do have to love rosemary. My husband does not, so I wrapped sliced garlic under the bacon instead for him.

I wasn't able to create this dish the way you did but I was inspired to wrap some pieces of chicken breast meat (slightly pre-cooked) with some amazing bacon...result?  My family loved it as an appetizer :)...thanks for the idea!

I've made this with and without rosemary and it is wonderful both ways. Grilled on bbq and bacon crisped up perfectly, just don't make chicken too thin. And one piece of bacon won't kill anyones healthy eating now c'mon :)
