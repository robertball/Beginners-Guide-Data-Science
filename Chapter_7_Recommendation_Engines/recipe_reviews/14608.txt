I make this all the time but keep meaning to rate this so here goes. I rate this a 5 with my alterations, otherwise it is a 4. I usually use a 4-5# roast, I use the recipe as listed plus I place a sliced onion on top. After this has cooked 6 - 8 hours or so, I take it out, drain the juice out, shred the beef and return to the crock pot. I then add another 18 oz of barbecue sauce and simmer it until whenever we are ready to eat, usually another one to three hours. Sometimes I buy the economy 32 oz of barbecue sauce and use 1/2 in the beginning and 1/2 after shredding. I have had best results with KC Masterpiece. I have one son that likes Sweet Baby Ray's but that is a bit sweet for most people's tastes. For work functions I cook this in the crock pot all day, come home, drain and shred, place meat in fridge. Next morning I add the meat plus the extra jar of barbecue sauce, take to work and put in slow cooker on low and it is served for lunch approximately 4 hours later. It gets RAVE reviews! This is highly requested and so simple! I can usually find roasts on sale for 1.79/lb plus so it is economical when feeing large crowds. Try this, I don't think you will be disappointed!

This recipe, was a HUGE hit with everone (60 ppl) at my party recently, and was the most requested recipe of all time for me.  For absolute success, I have two tips:  USE EYE ROUND ROAST! It's leaness allows the meat to slow cook for 8 hours without diluting the BBQ sauce with liquids from fat. After the meat is cooked and cooled, slice it thin and return it to the crockpot on low.  I used (4) 4 lb roasts cut in half. (Remember, 60 people and 4 crockpots!).  Half way through cooking time, I turned the sections over to allow them to cook evenly in the sauce.   Second, if you haven't spotted the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce recipe submitted by Kevin on this site yet, you should.  It's better than great.  This combination made the dish to die for.  All I could hear in the crowd was "the barbeque beef is sooooo good".  If you really want your cooking to please, this combo does the job.  Thanks!

I used pork tenderloin instead of chuck roast.  I've used chuck roast for these types of recipes in the past and thought they were too fatty.  You end up having to pick out the pieces of fat and a lot of it cooks off into the sauce making it greasy.  I believe this is why a lot of reviewers felt they needed to replace the cooking sauce.  With the pork tenderloin there is almost no fat at all and the meat comes out super tender and easy to shred.  You can put it right back into the bbq sauce it cooked in which adds additional flavor.  No need to drain.  Perfect and easy!  Mine was tender enough to shred easily after 8 hours on low.

So easy, and if you follow other reviewers' tips (drain fat and a lot of the juice towards end of cooking time, add new bbq sauce to the shredded meat, then finish cooking for the last hour or half-hour), you'll have a great meal with little effort. You can use pork or beef and vary the kinds of bbq sauce for variety. Try one of the mustard-based sauces -- yummy!

TRY THIS! I bought a 3.5lb chuck roast, put it in the crockpot and seasoned with the onion and garlic powder and pepper as the recipe states. THEN, I poured Dr. Pepper (really!) over the roast until it was covered completely.  I then added a generous amount of salt to the liquid. The combination of the salt and Dr. Pepper really tenderizes the meat. Cook on low for 8 hours WITHOUT any BBQ sauce. Once the 8 hours is up, the meat literally falls apart on it's own! I discard all of the liquid mixture and shred the beef. Then, I add my BBQ sauce and mix together and leave the cooker on warm until it is ready to be served. It is phenomenal-a must try! I made my own BBQ sauce which is great too! Recipe for that follows: 1/2 tsp oil, 1/2 onion(minced), 1 clove garlic (minced),1/2C ketchup, 2 Tbsp worcestershire, 2Tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1/8 cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup Dr Pepper, brown sugar (if desired).  Heat oil in pan on medium. Sautee onion and garlic til soft & fragrant then add rest of the ingredients. Simmer for about 45 minutes (sometimes longer) until sauce thickens.

We make this at least every two weeks, because its delicious and so easy. It makes the whole house smell good. If you live in or near Texas, I'd definitely recommend Stubb's Barbecue Sauce. I put half of a bottle in it all day.. then I pour most of this down the sink because there's alot of grease after it cooks all day. Then I shred it and pour the other half of the bottle on it at the end. Its delicious.

I would give this more than 5 stars if I could!  It is THE BEST recipe ever!  Very easy and so delicious!  I used about 4lbs of brisket and  onion soup mix along with the bbq sauce and garlic salt.  I live in the UK and it's hard to buy decent bbq sauce but I found some called New Orleans Smokey Blues, and it's fan-tab-u-lous!  
I put it all in the slow cooker this morning before work and the house smelled so good when I got home!  I'm actually still cooking it cause my husband wont be home until late.  It's been in the cooker now for 13 hours and it seems the longer I leave it in, the better it gets!  (I've been picking it at all evening!)
Thank you so much for an excellent recipe that, if it weren't for my diet, I'd make ALL the time!!

Superb! My husband took the leftovers to work, heated it up in a bowl in the microwave and spooned it onto some crusty sub buns- he said the guys at work just freaked. The easiest, tastiest thing in the world. I usually add my spices near the end; I find that the long cooking time destroys especially the garlic powder.

Easiest recipe I have tried here!  I was randomly looking for something for my slow cooker with ingredients I had on hand,,and came to this one.  I actually used two thick, FROZEN steaks, about 10 oz of bbq sauce and the spices.  My honey,,,(who never eats leftovers!) requested this until it was gone for three days!  I am totally amazed!  Too easy!  Thanks Brandy!

Delicious!! I used a 3 lb pot roast that I had and Baby Rays Honey bbq sauce. Threw all ingredients called for into pot and cooked on high for 4 hours. I then took out and shred meat, emptied the crock pot greasy sauce, put shredded meat back into pot, and added another bottle of bbq sauce and cooked for another 30 minutes. We loved! I'm not the best cook, I do the best I can, and we were happy:) Served on subs with red potatoes and a baked bean/black bean mixture. Thanks so much!!

This recipe is absolutely AMAZING!!!! It's super easy and tastes wonderful!

I read the reviews first and made a few changes. First, I used a 3 lb EYE ROUND ROAST because it is a leaner cut. I also cooked it, first, in DR PEPPER with generous amounts of salt, pepper, hot sauce, and a little smoke flavoring. Also, instead of using garlic and onion powder, I used about 5 small cloves of garlic and a whole yellow onion. After cooking for 6 hours, I drained the liquid, shredded the beef and added the bbq sauce to let cook for 2-3 more hours.

Instead of using a store brand bbq sauce, I made my own using the BOURBON WHISKEY BBQ SAUCE recipe on here.

I would recommend this recipe to anyone!!!

As per other reviews, I drained half way through and added more BBQ sauce. If you can stgop eating it out of the pot, it is great on toasted Texas toast with pickles and onions....

This is a great recipe! I did make a few changes. I added the beef, real garlic and real onions and cooked for 6hrs. Then I shred the beef, replace the bbq sauce as others have suggested but then I add 3tbs of brown sugar and 2tbs of spicy mustard along with fresh onions and garlic. I have made this for my parents and for friends at work and it has been a big hit.

MY spin - Used 2 onions, quartered, instead of powder. Added minced garlic not powder. As others have done, one hour before completion I removed the meat, drained the liquid, reserving the onions. Then I shredded the beef, added 16 oz fresh bbq sauce and previous cooked onions. Continued cooking for 1 hours as recipe suggested. Served on toasted onion rolls. Was a big hit.

This just didn't turn out for me.  I think it's all about the sauce & meat you use.  I used Jack Daniel's, and maybe it is just too thick to not have extra liquid. Also, my meat was a leaner cut.  After about 7 hours, I had a burned, sticky pile of inedible expensive ingredients.  It was SO disappointing.  It seems to have worked for others & my crockpot is not usually hotter than average, so I think it comes down to the sauce & meat selected.  I recommend making this (the first time) when you are able to check on it after 4 hours and adjust the liquid if needed.

My first time ever using a slow cooker, and it came out really good. Husband really loves it. I did drain the juices and fat before shredding, and added a new bottle of BBQ sauce as others have recommended. Will try pork next time. Thank you for posting this.

My husband really dislikes pot roast...but it's so easy to just throw one in the crockpot..so I looked for a BBQ recipe that would change the taste. He LOVED it!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, onion powder, kosher salt, minced garlic and cracked pepper. Drained crockpot then, re-applied sauce. We separated the meat and made sandwiches with whole wheat buns..served with red potatoes and baked beans.  Husband said it was delicious and would love to have it again!  Thanks!

This was very easy to make and tasted yummy!  My two girls loved it.  Definitely spray with non-stick spray for easy clean up.  I also drained all grease and sauce and put in fresh sauce for the last hour of cooking after shredding.

I have a family of 3 (2 adults, 1 child) so I used 1 lb of a leaner chuck roast and reduced the cooking time to about 4 hours before I pulled it by hand and put it back in the slow cooker for another hour. I also used fresh organic sweet onions and fresh organic minced garlic. This turned out to be amazing! Made great leftovers on toasted bread the next day as well!

IMHO, beef or pork should be seared a bit before cooking in a crock pot. It adds a nice crust to the meat, and makes it more like real outdoor bbq. Not cooked, SEARED, as in an iron skillet, or under the broiler. Not a bad idea to marinate it overnight before crocking too. We do this with pot roast, or bbq. Sear chuck in a pan, and we sear ribs and pork roast under the broiler. Makes such a difference. Only takes a couple more minutes.

It was okay. It wasn't as tender as I would of hoped. i thought it would of shredded easier. I added cajun seasoning before the bbq sauce and some honey at the end with the second sauce.

This was the best recipe I've made from this site so far.  It was unbelievably good.  This is the kind of bbq I would drive to a restaurant for.  The fact that it was practically effortless is the best part.  I actually cooked the roast on high for the first 5 hours, cut in thin slices with the grain, then threw back in crockpot for another hour.  This way, the sauce wasn't too reduced, and when I pulled out the meat, it practically fell apart.  Perfect, easy, and scrumptious.  5+ stars.

Turned out really lovely.  I used chuck roast and seasoned it with steak seasoning, then browned it first.  I always brown meat, no matter what the recipe says.  It caramelises and does something yummy with the sugars in the meat, or whatever!  Anyway, I did that, then sautéed some sliced onions and garlic.  I used a local (Qatari) brand of barbecue sauce, but about 1/3 of a bottle, which was more than enough.

I cooked it for about 6 hours on medium heat.  The entire family loved it!!  There were no left-overs.  Even the three-year old was hunting around for seconds.  I served this with mayonnaise scones (what you americans call biscuits) and tinned sweetcorn.  It all went down fantastically and is definitely going to be on my repeat list.

I also used another poster's tip (thank you) about putting dishcloth under the lid of the slow cooker to soak up excess moisture as I find slow cooking always springs too much water.

A real winner!!!!

I tried the suggestion of cooking in Dr. Pepper instead of BBQ sauce and then draining the liquid and adding the sauce - it was awesome!! The meat pretty much fell apart when it was time to shred!

First attempt ever to make a pulled bbq anything.  Turned out excellent and had fantastic comments from friends.  A couple things I did, added 1 finally chopped yellow onion rather than onion powder and a couple tablespoons minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and about 1+ tablespoon black pepper.  Also, cooked it in the slow cooker for 10 hours, completely drained and shredded it and then put it back in the slowcooker.  Also, added back some of the juice drained originally as well as another bottle of bbq sauce (local recipe from the grocery store).  Wasn't soupy, just saucy. ;-)  Cooked for another 3 hours and served.

Quick note about the bbq sauce-just used a cheap local recipe rather than the typical brand name stuff because of other reviews recommending a good bbq sauce.

It was a homerun!

Tried this over the weekend and my family loved it. Didn't have onion powder, so I added slices of onion. I did as others suggested and drained the juice after it cooked for 6 hrs, then added more bbq sauce to cook another hour. Very easy and tasted great!

OMG. I made this for a potluck at work. It was gone in an hour! I had such rave reviews about it, I was ordered not to come back to work without a second batch! They even made a money collection so I could buy more meat! I took the suggestion of one of the reviews and added a 2nd bottle of sauce after I drained the fluid, that definitly added to the flavor. I also added ~1tsp worshire sauce at the beginning and used red onion sliced up on the top. Overall this is an excellent and very easy recipie!

It was just mediocre.  We had tried another BBQ pork recipe where we first cooked it in root beer, drained it, and then added the BBQ sauce for the last hour.  That was so much better because of the extra flavor from the root beer.

Very tasty. Added some honey mustard, liquid smoke, two types of BBQ (Original & Hickory) and used boston butt meat. Boiled it for a little bit before cooking to speed up the time. Will make it again and again!

I used a pork roast and had some fat but not alot.  Used full bottle of bbq sauce, half at beginning, half two hours before serving after shredded.  My husband loved it and I enjoyed it also.  Lots of leftovers.

I don't own a slow cooker, but decided to try this anyway in a covered roaster.  I bought a pork roast and sprinkled it with onion and garlic powder, salt, and pepper then roasted it for 3 hours on 300 degrees.  I then "pulled" all the meat and added it back to the pan with the juices (having removed all the fat). At this point I added the BBQ sauce, checked the seasonings, and cooked for another hour or more, stirring occasionally.  This turned out fabulous served on hot toasted buns with cole slaw and french fries.

I used a round of pork and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. I didn't have onions so I used onion soup mix and it came out SO GOOD! It wasn't greasy & maybe next time I will try it with beef.

This was just ok.  I used the Bourboun-Whiskey BBQ Sauce from this site.  The sauce was delicious, but the meat was just ok.  I used a round-eye roast as suggested.  Also, I didn't shred my beef as I wanted bigger slices. It could have been something I did wrong, but I just wasn't crazy about it.

I used a English Cut Pot Roast, trimmed of all exterior fat. The sauce was Sweet Baby Ray's original. Followed recipe as written but I put an old kitchen towel between the top of the slow cooker and the lid. Rotated towel a couple times, draping damp part back on the glass top. This kept the sauce from getting too thin and meat shredded easily. Try it if your cooker tends to make too much liquid.

I make it starting the night before:  add chopped onion and garlic to the bottom of the slow cooker, add the chuck roast (or 7-blade roast works well, too) and add a bottle of beer.  Cook on low overnight, about 8 hours.  The next morning, take meat out and shred.  Drain most of the broth into a bowl and skim off the fat  Save a couple cups of the broth.  Add the shredded beef back to the slow cooker along with a bottle of barbecue sauce and 1 cup of the broth.  Continue cooking on low until ready to serve.  Add a little more of the reserved broth if it starts to thicken too much.  Great make ahead party fare.  Set out a basket of onion rolls and sourdough rolls and a couple of salads and everyone can serve themselves.

The flavor was terrific, but mine wouldn't shred at all.  I spent over $13 for a boneless chuck roast and it wasn't worth it.  I'd like to try it again, because it was so easy, but I was really disappointed.  Can't figure out what I didn't wrong.

I used a pork tenderloin and a bouron barbeque sauce when I made this.  Delicious!!  I served it with Kaiser rolls, cole slaw.  We had relatives visiting us while we were on vacation and this was a simple way to make a great meal without spending a lot of time in the kitchen.  I will make this again.

I browned the roast in a little oil first, then put in the crock pot and poured a can of french onion soup over the roast. I removed it after about 7 hours, shredded the beef, then returned to the crock pot and used Sweet Baby Rays regular BBQ sauce and cooked for another hour. We loved it!!! Served it with potato salad and baked beans.

I've made this so many times I've lost count - made it for Super Bowl parties, TX/OU weekend (go Longhorns!) and for just evenings at home with the family.  And it is always a hit.  I also have taken the advice of other reviewers and use fresh onion and use two bottles of bbq sauce.

This was good and so very easy!  I just sprinkled the roast with garlic and onion powder, so I have no idea how much I actually used.  More than 1 tsp each though!  I took the advice of some others and only used 1/2 the bottle of bbq sauce to start.  After 6 1/2 hours I drained the juice, shredded the meat and put it back in with the rest of the bbq sauce for another hour.  We served on hoagie rolls and it was enough for 6 people.

Excellent!  I trimmed the fat off of the roast and then cooked it for 6.5 hrs on high - I then drained off the liquid and the roast just fell apart - no shredding needed :)  I added more bbq  sauce to taste and cooked on low another 30 mins.  Served with Amish Slaw from this web site.  Will make many many more times.  THanks!

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I used Cattlemen's Honey BBQ sauce and it came out great.  We placed a slice of provolone cheese on the roll before adding the beef.   The hot beef melted the cheese and it really made it tasty!  Everyone in my family, including a 7 and 5 year old, enjoyed this meal.

Not quite sure what happened with this recipe, but we didn't like this at all.  The meat wasn't tender enough after 8 hours & the BBQ sauce tasted bland & almost burnt (I used Sweet Baby Rays - one of my favorites!). If I make this again, I'll cook the roast in beef broth w/onion & spices all day, shred the beef and then add BBQ sauce at the very end.

It was perfect.  I used whole cloves of garlic, about 10.  I also added half of a yellow onion.  I used Bullseye honey garlic to start the roast off with.  30 minutes before it was done, I pulled the roast, drained the juice.  While I did that task, my boyfriend shredded the beef.  IT JUST FELL APART.  FABULOUS.  I placed the shredded beef back into the crockpot and added another bottele of Bullseye original flavor and let it cook on high for 30 minutes.  We served it on hoagie rolls, and with coleslaw.  It was the best.  I wish I wouldv'e found this recipe in the summer time, it would be so perfect.  Thankyou for such a great dish.  Peace.:)

This is unreal!  I've made this several times with homemade BBQ sauce.  I used the "Nana's Barbeque Sauce" from this site, which was a simple, mainly ketchup based sauce.  Serve on buns with a little cornbread on the side.  Delicious!

It really couldn't get any easier than this. I was able to throw it all together in about 5 minutes one morning, while simultaneously making breakfast and packing school lunches. The result was outstanding, and I didn't alter the recipe at all. I served it with fresh BBQ sauce on the side (I chose a different kind than what the meat was cooked in), buns for making sammies, and homemade french fries. My 8 year old had several helpings, and asked me the next morning to heat it up and put it in a thermos for his school lunch. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for posting!

Sooooo good!  After reading through some reviews I used a pork roast instead.  I drained some of the juice, but not all of it and then added more BBQ sauce once I had it shredded and back in the slow cooker.  This is now one of our favorite dinners.  Thanks so much!  And thanks for all the reviews.  They are helpful on every recipe on here.

YUM!! Although, I did follow advice from other users and drained the liquid before putting the shredded meat back in the slow cooker. Then added 1/2 bottle sauce and diced onions and cooked for about an hour. YUM!

I love this recipe with the slight change of dumping the juices after 6 hours and adding another 18oz bottle of BBQ sauce then letting it cook for another hour.

Great recipe the only thing I changed was I added water to the bbq sauce while cooking and then drained it before pulling the meat then added more sauce and set my crock to keep warm for a few more hours it turned out great and we all loved it.

AMAZING.  I threw a frozen chunk of beef in the crockpot in the morning, covered it with Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce (plus a little water to swish out the bottle), added a sliced onion, and cooked it on high all day.  Shredded it at the end, threw it on a bun w/ cheddar cheese on top.  PERFECT!  Serve w/ baked beans and KFC cole slaw to be in heaven!

This was the best bbq beef ever my family loved it.  The only thing I changed was when I took the meat out to shred it I removed all the bbq sauce and fat. Then put the shredded beef back in the slow cooker with some fresh bbq sauce for about 30 more minutes.  It turend out really tasty and it will definately be made again in.  So with they way I did it you'll have to double the amount of bbq needed.  I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.    Thanks so much Brandy

Very simple to make for a first time slow cooker user. I cooked for a co workers going away and everyone enjoyed it greatly. I used Jack Daniels No. 7 recipe BBQ sauce. Its great for people that are not crazy about overly sweet sauces.

This was wonderful and so simple to make!  I had a crowd so I used a 5 lbs roast and added some extra bbq sauce.  I let it cook on low for 8 hours. I drained most of the liquid out so I would lose the extra fat.  I added a new bottle of bbq sauce into the pot - shredded the meat and heated through on low another 30 minutes.  We served on sub rolls with coleslaw and it was wonderful.  We are going to use the leftovers to make a bbq beef pizza. Definitely a keeper and makes a ton if you have a crowd - great game day recipe - just cook it overnight and it will be ready for the afternoon.

All time favorite! This is a simple, great recipe. The only thing I did differently was add half the barbeque sauce while cooking and used 1/4 cup of onions which I put under the roast and added 2-3 garlic cloves. Drained the liquid when ready to shred. I then added the other half of the barbeque sauce and added the liquid to taste. Sometimes, half, sometimes it all back. Also, remember that leftovers need more liquid for better taste.

I substituted a two chopped onions and a few minced garlic cloves for the powders.  After the 8 hours, I strained the sauce and discarded the fat.  I removed the fat from the shredded beef and added another bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's.  It was wonderful.

I use a Foodsaver vacuum sealer, so I froze some and sealed it (I was stockpiling for after our baby was born.)  I reheated it in the bag in a pot of boiling water.  Husband and I both loved it!

We apparently left the meat to cook too long, and the sugar in our bbq sauce burnt, giving the whole batch a very unpleasant bitter flavor.  We had to throw the whole thing out.  You could tell that if that hadn't happened it would have been a great recipe, but I think next time we'll let the meat cook first, and then add the bbq sauce in.  Oh, well, lesson learned.

I used a 3.64 lbs. boneless chuck shoulder roast ($1.99/lb.). Instead of powders, I used a large coarsely chopped onion and a lot of diced garlic from a bottle. It cooked for 7 hours, then sat for approx. 45 minutes. I agree with the other reviewers; the "au jus" was too runny. So, I did drain most of the liquid. Then I coarsely chopped the meat (it did not "shred" well with forks), put it back in the crock-pot, and added most of another bottle of bar-b-que sauce. I left it on low for another 30 minutes, until it was time to leave for the party. I used "Sweet Baby Rae's" bar-b-que sauce, which my husband thought was quite sweet, but I liked it. We received many compliments. I will definitely make this again.

OH MY GOSH - this is GREAT!  This morning I had an urge to make something in the crock pot for dinner tonite, but really didn't know what.  I browed through my favorite Allrecipes site here, decided to go with this recipe and was I ever glad I did!  Not only is it a "no-brainer" - you just dump, sprinkle and pour, but it's delicious!  I haven't even officially eaten it yet - still have about another hour to go before it's "bun-ready", but I couldn't resist sampling it.  I used a combination of Ken Davis traditional BBQ and the new Jack Daniel's BBQ glaze-sauce (about a 3-1 ratio).  It's PERFECT!

Thanks, Brandy, for the recipe.  Used your basic 
idea, but bought a 4-lb. rump roast, KC Masterpiece
Honey Smoke Barbecue Sauce, 1/2 large onion, and 3
large garlic cloves.  Cooked for 10 hours.
ABSOLUTELY DEE-LICIOUS.  Every bite was eaten at an
all-adults birthday party.  I'm making another one 
for my husband and myself.

THIS IS THE BEST BAR-B-Q BEEF I EVER HAD. MY HUSBAND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.  TO MAKE IT EASIER I PREPARED EVERYTHING IN THE SLOW COOKER POT AND PUT IT IN THE FRIG AND IN THE MORNING I TOOK IT OUT AND TURNED IT ON. THE BEST PART WAS SHREDDING IT CUZ I WAS ABLE TO PICK AND TASTE.  BETWEEN TWO OF US IT LASTED 2 DAYS. YUMMY AND EASY AND JUST USE YOUR FAVORITE SAUCE OR TRY DIFFERENT ONES.  I WILL SURE PASS THIS ONE ON. THANKS BRANDY

I've made this as written a bunch of times & it's always comes out great. I use Weber BBQ sauce because it's one of the few sauces that doesn't contain HFCS. Many reviewers mentioned throwing out the sauce due to fattiness then adding a new jar of sauce.... that seems wasteful. While I shred the beef, I put the sauce through a fat separator then pour back into the pot. Works for us. Thanks for the recipe.

This is easy and delicious! I started by rubbing the meat in with the roasted garlic grape seed oil from Wildtree. Then I seasoned and rubbed the meat with the Wildtree Ranchers Steak Rub and Wildtree garlic and herb blend. I used Stubb's beef soy, garlic, and red pepper BBQ sauce to give it a kick.

This BBQ recipe tasted great but burned my crock pot sadly. I had a really hard time cleaning the burnt sauce off the side of the pot. If I were to make this again, I'd stir the pot more frequently.

I made this for my family last weekend and it was well received.  I started it on Saturday morning and went right by the recipe.  I let it cook for 8 hours, drained it, shredded it, and put it in the fridge.  I added a fresh bottle of sauce and reheated it for a couple of hours in the crockpot on Sunday.  Will likely make this again.

Bought a roast, and husband really wanted to slow cook with vegitables. I talked him to making BBQ sandwiches with it. He was not disappointed. I always use cola and water when slow cooking a potroast for BBQ sandwiches and drain before shredding meat.  I have made this many times for party's and get rave reviews.  Can even buy slider buns and serve at super bowl party's.

This tasted good but I would never use a chuck roast again. I had to throw about half of it out when I was shredding it in the end to get rid of all the fat. I will definitely use this recipe again, but with a leaner cut of meat. 2/5 stars with a chuck roast as written, I think it would be 4-5/5 with a leaner cut of meat.

This meal is in my crock pot as I am writing this review.  At hour 7 i took the meat out to shred it and i had to sample it!  Yummo!!!!!!  My picky 3yr old even likes it!  My husband said its better than our favorite bbq place!  I used generic sauce in Mesquite flavor.  I read a review about the grease and fat chunks, well i cut the fat blanket off before i put it in the pot and i ladeled the grease out while i had the meat out to shred it.

I tried this recipe and it turned out fabulous! I read some of the reviews prior to making it. And I didn't have any trouble with extra liquid and I did add more bbq sauce after I shredded the meat. I think that the next time I make this, I'll only add a little extra sauce after shredding it because the meat was very flavorful. It went great with homemade slaw on kaiser rolls!

I used a pork loin and it turned out great.  I cooked it over night and warmed it up 2 hours before everyone came.  One warning, use a really good BBQ sauce it can make or break your meat.  I chose a cheap one and I am still regreting it.

This was fantastic, my son and husband couldn't get enough of it.  I used a 5-6lb cheap roast that I'd bought several weeks ago.  I made as recipe directed, but did take the advice to drain to the crockpot in the last hour of all the grease and add a bit more BBQ sauce to the shredded meat, cooked for another hour and it turned out wonderful.  This made so much yummy beef, hubby's having it for lunch today as am I and I'm making a casserole for dinner out of the rest.  Thanks!!

I bought chuck roast, which I never buy!  Early the next morning started the crockpot with all the ingredients and 8 hours later took the chuck roast out and cut into pieces.  We had so much Bar B que sauce that the sandwiches were soupy!  The meat was chewy and the dinner was a bust.  Next time I would use rump roast and not as much Bar B que sauce.

A huge hit with everyone who tried this!  Added a diced onion and used Tony Roma's BBQ sauce.  After cooking 8 hours I skimmed off most of the fat, shredded the meat, and added more BBQ sauce.  Cooked another hour and it was perfect.  Served with sandwich rolls, baked beans, and cole slaw.  A fantastic recipe!

I have made this and all sorts of other hunk-of-meat crock pot recipes.  Always turns out so tender that it almost falls apart!  I usually add a splash of liquid smoke in with the roast at the beginning (often throwing in a still-frozen roast) and let it cook ALL day- 8-10 hours.  Drain the fat, shred or slice, add a little more sauce, and keep warm until ready to eat.

This has been a HUGE hit in my house! I am from Texas, so beef bbq is what I am used to, rather than pork- my husband was used to pork bbq- anyway, I made this with a pork butt first, with the kevin's bbq sauce from this site, and it was good. Then, the next week, I made it with a chuck roast, so that my husband could get a taste of good beef bbq- now he is sold! He asks for this dish all the time, and it is definately a once a week dish for us- it is soooo good and easy! Usually I make my own sauce, but I have used the Jack Daniels BBQ sauce too, and that is pretty much just as great!

Wonderful recipe! For a bit more zing I like to add 2 - 3 dashes of chinese hot chili oil to the sauce I use. I then serve this tastey BBQ on Kaiser rolls with dill pickle slices and monterey jack cheese. YUM!

This was my first time making BBQ beef and it was very easy and tasted very good.  I followed the recipe exactly but the beef wasn't as sweet as I normally like it.  I even used honey BBQ sauce.  It also made much more than 8 servings - more like 12-15.

Very good!  I used an eye round roast due to its leanness, but I think a different kind of roast or even pork would have been more tender. Like other reviewers, I drained the juice out after 7-8 hours, sliced the roast, added another bottle of bbq sauce, and cooked it on low another 2-3 hours. It made great sandwiches!

Can I give more than 5 stars?? This was easy and very flavorful. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and served it with coleslaw (Restaurant Coleslaw I) on hamburger buns. Even better the next day.

Tip: Be sure to add a bit of water to keep the sauce from burning.

I'm struggling with this review.  I have never been a big fan of any shredded meat sandwiches, I chose this recipe to serve at my son's birthday party specifically for the adults.  We did a Thomas Train theme and I needed to create a 'hobo' like meal, so I chose a shredded meat recipe.  I used a boneless chuck roast that shriveled down to very little.  The meat required actual cutting, not shredding after 7 hours on low.  But after I tossed it all back in the crockpot, it did tenderize nicely after another couple of hours.  I used Famous Dave's Texas Pit BBQ sauce.  I would suggest leaving out the garlic and onion powder because I think the sauce has enough flavor.  Not one person said they liked it, but it was gone by the end of the party.  Maybe silence is consent?  I don't know the hot dogs were gone too.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't spectacular, it was just okay.  I will probably not do this recipe again.

nobody really liked this at all. I used sweet baby rays sauce and added a new bottle towards the end like suggested. the meat was not as easy to shred as I'm used to, and it just didn't taste like barbeque. Thanx but I'll stick to my recipe

This was so incredibly easy and DELISH.  My husband is very picky and had two helpings of it... I even caught him gobbling it by the serving spoonful from the slow cooker! :p I used pork shoulder, Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and fresh chopped onion based on others' recommendations.  It turned out great and will definately make this one often!

SO easy and everyone gobbled it up when I made it for a crowd. I added a chopped onion and I did remove beef and discard oily sauce.  Returned beef to crock pot with additional 1/2 bottle of sauce and let it cook another hour.  I've also made this with pork but I thought the beef was better.

I can't begin to say enough about this recipe.  IT IS AMAZING.  We have made it for several friends of ours when they have come for dinner and everyone RAVES over it.  They have all begun to make it at their houses too!  I have to say tho, that it never comes out the same, because I just use what ever bbq sauces I have on hand, and it's just awesome.  Thanks so very much for sharing this one.  We make this several times in a month now, lol.

What an easy dish!  Not only did I come home to a pleasant aroma, that first bite was a fabulous melt in your mouth experience.  I have a new dish for family reunions! 
Thank you,

Irresistible!
My roast was slightly smaller, and I had fresh garlic and onion on hand, so I used those. So ridiculously easy, so yummy. It's going to be hard to eat just a reasonable portion rather than 2 or 3!!

This reminded us that we don't like chicken cooked in the crockpot, it's greasy no matter what you do.

I made this and took it to work. My coworkers loved it and it is hard to impress a group of firefighters. I am not known for cooking ability. I made this with ease and was able to cook it while I was asleep because I work nights.

I added a little onion soup powder and chopped onions on top of the brisket before adding bbq sauce. I only used about 2/3 of the bbq sauce at first. At about 7 hours slow cooking I drained all the grease and sauce and then cooked another hour with the rest of the bbq sauce drizzled on the shredded beef.

This made a lot! I used a tender chuck roast, and Bull's Eye barbeque sauce and it was delicious! There were no leftovers and my husband has asked me to make it again twice since. :) I highly recommend it

It smelled great all day and tasted good too!  The meat and sauce turned out to be a little greasier than we would have liked, but that may have been due to the chuck roast I used.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I made this for a bbq we were having on the weekend and I sliced the beef instead of shredding and served it in crispy hotdog rolls.  Just delicious and everyone commented on how tender and nice it was.  You didn't need anything else in the roll but the meat.  I used topside roast beef and a whole bottle of bbq sauce and just kept basting it thru the day.  A great recipe to do for when people are coming over to watch a game and you don't want to be stuck in the kitchen the whole time.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This was excellent! I used an eye of round roast and used a store bought rub to put on the meat before dumping the BBQ sauce over it. Also,i added a bit more sauce after shredding.

This is why I loved this recipe:  1) Easy to throw together before work.  2) Easy to shred the beef after work.  3) Quickly appears on the table with kaiser rolls and a salad.  4) Family fed and happy.  5)  Done :-)

My family loved this dish!!! You do need to drain the excess liquid before you shred and then add more sauce and continue to cook for another hour or so.

This recipe is so easy and oh so good. I didn't want a smoky bbq taste so I used "Bone Suckin" bbq sauce. It has the best flavor. When I took the beef out to shred, I spooned off the fat from the sauce. Then I added a little bit of coarse salt, pepper and dark brown sugar. Wow! It gave the sauce just the right amount of sweet to go with the tang. I also prepared my homeade coleslaw to serve on or with the meat. We ate it on steamed onion rolls with the meat and slaw. Too good. I will be making this one of my go to party dishes for sure.

Very good!  I used a rump roast and two bottles of BBQ sauce - one regular and one spicy.  I added sliced onion and crushed garlic and removed it when I shredded the meat.

Made it for a group event, and got raves!  I'll definitely make it again.  I used a packet of onion soup mix instead of the spices just because that's what I had on hand.

This was delicious! I used Kraft Spicy Honey BBQ Sauce and it was great. I didn't have two bottles to use but next time I will make note of that. I agree with the poster that said to trim the fat before putting the roast in the crock pot. I will be making this again.

Amazing!!! I used a 3 1/2 pound chuck roast, 2 cloves of garlic and 1 whole white onion instead of the garlic & onion powder and 1 bottle of K.C. Masterpiece Hot & Spicy BBQ sauce. I followed the advice of others by draining & shredding the meat after the initial 8 hours and using a second bottle of BBQ sauce for the last hour. It came out perfect! I served it on onion buns & got rave reviews! This was my very first crock-pot attempt, and I will definitely make this again - it was SO easy! I would recommend trimming the fat off of the roast before cooking - it was sort of a pain to remove after the sauce was cooked into everything. I also think I'll add some hot peppers in the future for a little more kick!!!

Very good - just what I thought it would taste like.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce.  Next time though I'll PAM the perimeter of the crock pot - the BBQ sauce burnt around the edges and was a nightmare to clean off.

Love this!  So easy and yummy.  I've found that sometimes I need to drain fat off after cooking for the 6-8 hours, as others reviewers suggest... but sometimes the meat turns out a wee bit dry if I pour it all off.  Likely best to leave some liquid, and it depends on the cut of beef you use.  Overall I love to make this;)

This recipe is a keeper..I used pork because I didn't have the beef.I added some BBQ seasoning and rubbed it all over the pork before putting it in the slow cooker. I also added some chopped green peppers..Next time I'm gonna use the beef..

I rated this a four bc I have to add alot to this to get it to be what my family loves.  I always s/p my meat sea salt is essential when seasoning a slow cooker roast or grill.  but i always throw in a onion and bf bouillon cube and some whole cloves or garlic.  Pick your favorite bbq sauce this is key.  we personally like sweet baby rays but you might like masterpiece kc up to you but a good recipes.  You also could use leftover pepperconi bf for this to change the beef around for a night.  enjoy.

I was sick and didn't get to try this, but those I did feed said it was one of the best sandwiches they've ever had!  I did do a few modifications like the others' reviewing this did.  I put in one bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce in when it was cooking, then after it was done and time to shred, I emptied the crockpot and shredded the beef (very easily with a fork, I might add) took out the fat, and added another bottle of sauce to cook on low for 30 more min.  I also cooked this on low for 4 hours, then turned it up to high for 2 hours.  The meat shredded wonderfully.
Great recipe, thanks!!  =)

This recipe is easy, easy, easy.  Did I mention easy?  My one piece of advice is to cook it on low if possible.  When cooked on high, the sauce can overheat and scorch a bit on the bottom and sides.  If you have to cook it on high because of time constraints, make sure that you add water from time to time to thin it out.  In the last half hour you can add some more of the sauce to thicken it back up again.  It really is quite yummy and is delicious alone or on kaiser rolls.  This recipe is a permanent fixture on our family's meal rotation.

These were sooo good.  I dumped out the cooking liquid and added a new bottle of bbq sauce.  Instead of shredding the meat I sliced it very thin on a meat slicer.

did this for a pot luck party, it came out awesome!  My friends all loved it and were all amazed I made it... We are all under 33ish and haven't really gotten into cooking...  but this was delicious!!  After 5 or 6 hours cooking on low, drained all sauce and shredded up the beef.  Put back in crockpot and added another jar of BBQ sauce and cooked for another 2 hours or so. SOOOO yummy!!  I also added an onion chopped up fine and a couple cloves of garlic. Put it on potato rolls....mmmmm...

I don't normally make such simple fare, but I'm trying to use my crockpot more, and this recipe seemed like an easy thing to pop in on a weekday morning.  It was really good, and best of all it took fewer than five minutes in the morning, and about ten minutes to shred the beef and toast the buns that evening.

Made this last night. I used rump roast instead of the chuck roast. The only other thing I changed was: after shredding the meat..I added 1/2 bottle more of BBQ sauce. (I left original juices in crockpot too.) This made for a whole lot of sauce! I won't add it next t ime. I used Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce. But I like sweeter sauce so may look for an alternative. It turned out REALLY good though. Nice and tender. It really does not need a lot of "tweaking," but everyone has their own tates. It was quick and simple, too! I'll just experiment w/ different sauces.

There is a lot of great flavor for such a simple recipe, and the cooking method softens up the chuck roast wonderfully. There is a lot of grease from the roast, which makes for some pretty soupy barbecue, however that's to be expected from this cut of meat. As many others have noted, draning the "cooking sauce" and adding a fresh bottle of barbecue sauce for the last hour would yield a thicker, more traditional sauce for the meat. A quick easy meal that's filling and makes the house smell great - thanks!

Very easy, worked perfectly. I used two smaller pieces of beef instead of 1 larger and 1 bottle Jack Daniels BBQ sauce while in crock pot, then got rid of sauce for last hour of cooking after shredding. Will likely make again.

What a great recipe!  I let mine cook for about 10 hours, and the meat just fell off the bone.  I used a chuck roast which ended up being really fatty.  Next time I'll use a leaner cut of beef.  I also sliced an onion and threw that in along with Famous Dave's BBQ.  After I shredded the meat, I cleaned out the Crock Pot, put the meat back in and added new sauce.  Fantastic!!!

absolutely awesome. I followed the other suggestions on using a bottle before and after. I put it in last night before I went to bed. Then when I woke up this morning, I drained the juice,shredded it, and added another bottle of Sticky Fingers bbq sauce. I left it on low for 1 hr and now have it on 'keep warm' for the remainder of the day. my husband is from North Carolina and he knows bbq and loves this. I used Boston Butt pork, tender and easy to shred, the only draw back is the amount of fat. With that problem you can just pick the fat out when you are shredding.

This was SO SO SO good! My husband went on for like 10 minutes about how this is restaraunt good, and its probably the best he tasted! The meat was so tender, I was taking it out with tongs to shred it, and it just started falling apart; so really I just used the tongs to shred it. I used a 3 pound chuck roast and did use 2 bottles of BBQ sauce. I drained the juices and put a new bottle in the last hour. My husband likes spicy foods so I used KC Masterpiece Spicy, and it was heavenly! I will DEFINITELY make again!!!

Awesome! It's so easy, even shredding the meat was quick and easy. I agree with the others about added the extra bottle of BBQ sauce during the last hour after shredding the meat. Will make this often!

This is a great and easy recipe.  Gives a different way to cook roast.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and drained off the excess liquid before shredding and used fresh bbq sauce to simmer.  My family loved it!

I made this recently on a cold & rainy weekend. I had not used the crockpot in ages. It was easy & very tasty-the ultimate in "fix & forget" meals. My boyfriend & roommate loved it and said that it is definitely a "keeper". It surpasses any takeout BBQ beef sandwiches.  Although I do not have kids, I can see that it would be a winner.  I plan on passing this on to the "crockpot" affectionados that I know.

Large portion!  We Loved it! Cooked it while away at work all day.  Definitely did need to remove any fat prior to last hour of cooking.  It was a huge hit with the family.  I will make it again due 5 stars for ease and taste.

I made this just the way it was explained and my family loved it!! It was the easiest thing to make! No need to change anything , I cooked it on low for 6 hrs then shredded the meat on a cutting board put it all back in for 1/2 hour more , it was perfect! Thank you for posting this recipe!

Very good! We had this with coleslaw on Kaiser Rolls, Costco style. It was delicious!(Taste depends on the bottle of BBQ sauce. We used "Stubbs Sweet Heat"

SO GOOD especially with "Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce by Kevin".  I took advice from others and put chunks of onion for flavor in the crock pot so I could separate it from the meat after cooking.  I only put about 1 cup of BBQ sauce while cooking, drained the juice, removed the onion, shredded the meat and then put it back in the crock pot with the remaining BBQ sauce.

I'm not much of a bbq fan but this recipe was very good, i added in a bit more garlic and some spices that the recipe didn't call for.  I served it on kaiser rolls, very delicious and easy recipe.

Very easy and delicious. I used others' advice and poured out the fat about 2 hours before serving time. I shredded it and poured new bbq sauce on it. It was a hit!

This is a good alternative to smoking meat, which takes a lot of monitoring, I've found. I didn't have any problem with it being greasy, maybe it was the meat I used. Followed the recipe almost exactly, but I did add 1/2 diced onion to the pot because I had no onion powder. Came out very flavorful. I'll make it again, but will add some cayenne or use spicy bbq sauce next time, to me it needed to be a little spicier. I used the leftovers to make bbq nachos.

Very easy. Just like many people I drained it after the original 8 hours.  I don't see how you can not as it is just a big soupy mess.  I even trimmed off as much of the fat is possible beforehand.  Draining it and then adding in more sauce made it amazing though!

Yummy! Baked in the oven instead of slow cooker. As others suggested, put half the sauce over the whole roast and then the other half after shredding the meat.  Will definitely make again.

Ver good, but for some reason the next day leftovers were not very tasty. Definetly better fresh and right out of the crockpot.

I give this recipe 5 stars with just a few changes.  I used a pork tenderloin and seasoned it with Tony's, onion powder, and garlic powder. I start by seasoning the meat and placing 1/2 of each bottle of BBQ sauce.  I like using Stubb's BBQ sauce and Sweet Baby Ray's.  Try mixing it in a bowl before adding it to the crock pot to make sure you like the taste.  When only 45 minutes of cook time remain, I add the rest of the sauce and shred the meat.  My family can't stop asking for it!!!

Good. My friends loved it. But if you like spicy go with spicy bbq sauce or double the onion and garlic powder/add an onion. Following the recipe has a mild flavor. Also will opt for the shorter slow cooking time...9 hrs was too long.

This was so easy and very tastey! One recommmendation is to not leave it in the crock pot more that 9 hours or it tends to get a bit chewy. I used eye of round meat.

Couldn't possibly be easier.  I added sliced onions, used pork butt instead of beef (it was on sale), and used Stubb's Spicy BBQ sauce.  Definitely a keeper.

This was so good and so easy. I live in Texas and barbecue from a crockpot was hard to come to terms with, but I'm so glad I tried this. I did take the advice of other reviewers and ended up adding a lot more sauce but the only other thing I changed was adding a whole vidalia sweet onion and minced garlic. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Delicious but a little greasy.  I will try the suggestions from other posters to drain the liquid from the meat and replace with more bbq sauce after shredding.  My husband LOVED it!  Will absolutely make again.

These are great!  I used a bottom round roast because I did not have a chuck roast on hand and and it still turned out wonderful.  I used Bulls Eye Original BBQ sauce which is the only sauce my husband likes, and they were delicious.  I also took recommendations and dumped out the sauce the roast cooked in and added a new bottle after the meat was shredded.  They go great with the Sweet Restaurant Coleslaw recipe on this site...add it to your sandwich and you have a great meal and leftovers!!  Thanks!

I bought an eye of round roast on sale so I used it and it turned out really good. I cooked 8 hours, drained, added fresh bbq sauce, and cooked on low another hour. Mine shredded up really nicely and looked delicious. The only reason I didnt rate as 5 stars is because the sauce I used was too sweet. I made the bourbon whiskey sauce and used that and it was way too sweet for this recipe. Because it sits for so long in the sauce I think it needs a sauce with more kick. I will definately make this again, but with more spicy/less sweet sauce. Previous reviews are right on the money.. you have to love the sauce.

this is a great recipe.....I have made this for several family gatherings and following the suggestion of draining and adding a new bottle of barb sauce made it even tastier, I will continue to use this recipe for many gatherings I may have. thank you for sharing

Lol... my mom has been making this for YEARS before allrecipes.com came around. It is a very basic crock-pot recipe but also VERY wonderful. I've made this for people who were totally floored by it and asked with wonder "How do you make this?". Lucky for us all, it's really REALLY easy!
This is DEFINITELY a wonderful staple to add to you cooking repertoire if it isn't there already. 
You will love it!
Don't be afraid to tweak it either... maybe add some fresh chopped onion, or green peppers depending on your mood. 
Thanks for sharing!

Okay, This is awesome. I couldn't believe how simple, quick and easy this was!It tastes better than any of the packaged stuff in the grocery stores, for sure. I did tweak it just a bit, I added Chili powder to the seasoning before cooking to give it a little kick. I also used a Sweet Southern BBQ sauce and it was incredible. I will make this over and over again, especially if I have company coming. It's such a time saver, and SO good. I have a two month old daughter, and this allowed me to have some time to myself in the evening instead of cooking! You've gotta try this one!

Great!!! I served this at my daughter's birthday party and it was a huge hit. Some people could not believe I went to so much trouble to make it. Ha! What trouble? Very, very easy.

This was defintely good! We used KC's Masterpiece (2/3's of the bottle added at the beginning). I drained it probably an hour before serving then added sliced onion rings and about a third of a bottle of the bbq sauce. If you use a leaner cut you won't have to drain.

We do this all of the time, since BBQ sauce is always on crazy sale, but we do it with whatever meat we got on sale - pork roasts, chicken breasts (don't try it with skin on chicken - blech).  It's a great topper for potatoes.

Love this recipe!!  Have made a few times and it is now a permanent on my monthly menus.  My son loves BBQ but I am not a big fan, am so glad I found this to satisfy him and it is a  no brainer for me!!!  A good summer recipe...it simmers all day while I am at the beach and we split rolls, add a salad or fries and we are set!

This is the greatest find of the decade!!  It's so easy and taste sooo much better than anything  you can find 'eating out'.  I add some other seasonings to really spice it up and use a really spice b-b-q sauce, but I love this recipe.  I use a big roast (or 2 small ones) and freeze the extras.

My kids loved this and it was so easy.  Used an eye round roast as someone suggested for less fat and cooked on low for approx 81/2 hours then shredded beef.  Put back into crockpot and added additional Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and cooked for an addition 60 minutes.  Served on potato buns.  Toasted them with a slice of provolone cheese.  YUM!

This couldn't be any easier.  I initially put it in the slow cooker with the spices and just poured enough BBQ sauce on it to partially cover the top of the roast. I was at work longer than expected, so mine cooked for 10 hours before I drained it and shredded it.  I thought it would be burnt but it was awesome and the meat just fell apart when I went to shred.  Added more of the spices, enough sauce to where it tasted moist, but not over powering, and kept it in there for another hour before my boyfriend came home for dinner.  I didn't measure anything when I made it. I could see making this no-fuss meal for a casual get together. Thanks for the recipe!

Very simple to make!  Tasted good on sandwiches.  My cut of meat did not shred with a fork, I had to cut it all up in small pieces, which was a pain.

I followed recipe except cooked meat in broth.  Discarded broth, shredded meat.  You could even eat w/o sauce, so tender.  I would use less sauce next time.

I served this a few nights ago at a family/friend get together   and although I also served a really yummy chicken dish and delicious baked salmon, the beef got the biggest compliments.  Without a doubt, I'll be making this again.

My carnivore was not thrilled with this one. He loves roasts, BBQ and just about anything I do in the crock pot... but he felt - like other reviewers - that this was too BBQ-y. (AND I used his fav sauce!) The meat was very tender, but if I did it again, i would cook in a simple sauce of beef stock, onions, etc, and THEN add the BBQ just for the last hour of cooking. I won't make this recipe like this again.

This was super good!  I used a pork loin (all I had on hand) and Grandpa Crott's BBQ sauce (from this site) and it turned out awesome!  I didn't have a problem with it being to greasy as other reviewers did (maybe becasue I used pork instead of beef)will definately make again.  Thanks for the super recipe!

I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  You will not find an easier, tastier crock pot recipe than this!  Some didn't even make it to the toasted buns, it was eaten right out of the bowl.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My wife and I loved this. We added a half a corsely chopped onion and a bell pepper for the last hour and we added about a Tablespoon of dijon and and a couple teaspoons cayanne pepper at the begining for a little spice. Surely a keeper.

There are enough rave reviews on this recipe that you really don't need to hear my 2 cents...but...I like to rate all recipes I try from here.  This was excellent, but I do agree with others, drain the pot before putting the shredded meat back in and add another jar of BBQ sauce.  Will be making this dish again SOON!

This was amazing! I used pork mainly just b/c I had it in the freezer.  I put in one big bottle of BBQ sauce and let it cook for 8 hrs, then took it out, shredded it and put it back in with a little bit more sauce.  I also strained the sauce that was left in the crockpot with a slotted spoon.  I cooked it for maybe a half hour, and couldnt wait any longer! It smelled so good allll day.  My husband and I both loved it.  It made great leftovers as well.

Awesome.  I knew this was a hit when my son said he loved it.  He has never liked pulled BBQ before, but this time he cleaned his plate.  Even my husband asked for seconds.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this last night, used two bottles one KC masterpiece spicy original and one Kraft brown sugar BBQ sauce. I cooked it on low for 9 hours, drained some juice off and shredded it, then cooked for another 1/2 hour. IT WAS PERFECT! yummy, served with nice crusty rolls, and cole slaw. I will make this again...and again...and again. Next time i want to try a mustard base sauce.

Awesome BBQ!  I used KC Masterpiece and also added sliced onion.  A big hit with my boyfriend!

This was so easy to make I will give it a 5.  The meat was deliciously tender, but I was hoping for a tad more flavor.  I used garlic salt and real onions instead of the garlic powder and onion powder.  According to others, I poured half the BBQ sauce in at the beinning, drained the juices before shredding and then poured in the other half of the BBQ sauce and cooked for one more hour.  Next time I think I will pour half the BBQ sauce in immediately before serving so it has a little more zip.

This was tasty but nothing special.  The beef was slightly difficult to shred. Maybe I should have let it cook even longer.  It was a lot of work (shredding) for average taste.

Great recipe!  I used a pork roast instead, and used a combination of a vinegar-based sauce and a sweeter, spicy sauce.  I also used a sliced yellow onion and a couple dashes of Tabasco.  Cooked for 12 hours, drained off most sauce, pulled the pork and removed remaining fat, then added the other halves of both bottles of sauce and cooked for another hour.  Delicious on toasted french bread.
This is the second time I've made this recipe, and my boyfriend practically drools every time he talks about it!

My husband asked to take it to work with him the next day!  It shredded very easily in the crock pot for me.

Wonderful and easy. The sauce the beef cooked in was too runny, so I drained it and added another bottle of barbecue sauce, then cooked it for about another hour. My family thought it was great and I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was ok.  I found the sauce watery at the end, so I drained some of it (along with the fat), and added a new bottle of sauce for the last hour. I also added some sautéed onions. Kids weren't thrilled with it, but my husband enjoyed it.

Who would have thought something so easy could taste so good?  This was so easy to prepare, and after cooking for 8 hours, the meat almost shredded itself.  Excellent taste and my husband ate it up!  I took some to work the next day and it was still delicious.  This one is definately a keeper.

Great BBQ beef in the crockpot! I am pretty sure this recipe was great as is, but I needed to tweek it a bit to suite our taste. I substituted 1/2 chopped clove of fresh garlic along with a teaspoon of garlic salt and plenty of fresh ground pepper, along with 1 chopped whole onion. I used a 12 ounce can of beer and half a bottle of BBQ sauce to slow cooker for a total of 6 hrs. The addition of the beer tenderized the round roast I used. After 4 hrs cooking on high, I drained the grease and added a whole bottle of Chris & Pitts BBQ sauce and put the mixture back  in the crockpot, and cooked 2 more hrs. We served on hoagie buns with seasoned curly fries on the side. DELISH and super easy!

Not sure what I'm doing wrong, but this was not melt in your mouth. My meat was super tough after barely 5 hours, it was impossible to shred and had to be chopped. This has happened before using bbq sauce and a different cut of meat; chucks always turn out great when I cook them in liquid, so next time I will cook it in broth and seasonings then add the bbq sauce after it has been cooked and shredded.

instead of adding the bbq sauce, I added 32oz of Dr Pepper. Once the meat had slow cooked for about 12 hrs, I drained most of the sauce and added a over the counter honey bbq sauce. It turned out great. I will make it again and next time attempt a homemade bbq sauce...

This recipe is awesome. I make it with pork or beef also, But I have modified it I pour a can of Dr. Pepper over my roast or loin when I put it in the Crock pot, then I add BBQ sauce. My friends and family can't believe it is cooked in crock pot.

I only say that because if your significant other usually smokes a butt for bbq, you won't care for this.  Very blah.  For those that are not accustomed to smoked bbq, you might like it.  On the positive side, the meat was very tender.

This was fabulous!! I took pictures but the download is not working. The smell throughout my whole house was magnificent. My daughter and her friend LOVED the pork. As recommended in another review I marinated the pork in Dr.Pepper and an entire bottle of Barbecue sauce. I used Garland Jack's Six Sweet Brown Sugar Barbecue sauce. This meal was heavenly and will be made again many times in our house. FANTASTIC!!!

I used a bone in roast and rubbed it with a BBQ dry rub.  I added some BBQ sauce .  When it was done, I removed the roast and shredded it, skimmed the fat off the sauce in the crock pot and then returned the shredded beef to the crock pot and added more BBQ sauce to reach my desired consistency.   Delicious!

Freakin DELICIOUS. I still prefer pulled pork, because I find beef to be a bit dry BUT it was soooo good. I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and it was perfect. Side of Sweet potato fries and a salad. It was a WINNER.

Good base.  Did a couple different things.  Used Arm Roast...much leaner and tender!  Salt and peppered it on both sides.  Put in the crock pot.  In a small bowl I added the onion powder, garlic powder, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and half a bottle of Gates BBQ sauce.  Mix well and pour over roast.  Cooked on high for 3 hours or you can do 6 hours on low if you want.  Just scoop some of the juice and pour it over the roast once or twice.  Shredded it with a fork which was way easy and assembled the sandwiches on buns and just added more sauce on top.  First time using Gates sauce.  I have used KC Masterpiece before and love both.  You can use a whole bottle but I think half is enough. Anymore would be a waste of sauce you would end up pouring down the sink anyways when done.

Really loved the ease and taste of this recipe which I made per the instructions.  Will make it again following some reviewers' suggestions and drain the juice when cooked, add more BBQ sauce (and some chopped onion) then cook another hour.    08/30/13 Note:  Made 2nd time & cooked on low for six hrs, removed & shredded then drained juice out.  Put shredded beef back in with chopped onion and green pepper plus fresh BBQ sauce.  Since I didn't have enough new BBQ sauce I mixed an envelop of Brown Gravy mix with some of the beef juice and put that in.  Really wonderful!!  Change to five-stars

YUM! Both my hubs and I really enjoyed this. What I like most about this recipe is how easy it is to prepare. For us working gals, this is a staple - economical, quick and fuss free! Although I'm sure this would be perfect as written, I too made one slight change. I removed and shredded my chuck roast, drained the greasy sauce from my slow cooker (ewwww!!!) then added a second (18 oz.) bottle of BBQ sauce to everything and continued cooking on low for another hour as directed. We piled our sandwiches on onion rolls and topped them off with deli coleslaw (mmmmmm...). Kettle chips and baked beans rounded out our simple meal. My husband liked this so much, he actually looked forward to the leftovers we had days later! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Brandy. I'll be making this often! :-)

This was a hit for the Superbowl party.  So easy, and it smelled and tasted great.  I followed the directions exactly, except omitting the garlic powder (I didn't have any on hand).  Will definitely make this again and next time will make more.  I used Stubb's spicy bbq sauce.  One 18oz jar of sauce was easily enough.  I did have to skim some fat out of the cooker before shredding the beef, but it was easy to do.

This is going right into my regular recipe rotation.  So easy and tasty.  When the recipe says "shred the beef and cook for an hour or so more" it doesn't say anything about this being so easy--the meat just falls right apart and is so tender.  Yum.

My husband loved this and has already requested it again.  I followed the recipe.  I used KC Masterpiece sauce like someone else suggested.  I also used Eye of Round Roast which shreds pretty good.  Fantastic easy recipe.

SOOOO good!!! I used a 2 pound chuck roast, and an 18 ounce bottle of sweet baby rays hickory and brown sugar sauce. after hourse of cooking, I poured the top part of the liquid out, (where all the grease is) and kept the rest. Didn't use a new bottle, the half of it I kept was plenty for a smaller roast. I will be making this once a week now! thanks!

This turned out great thanks to all of the suggestions others made.  I only had one bottle of barbeque sauce (I used an organic one from Whole foods which was yummy - sweet and tangy I believe) so I used 1/2 a bottle to cook it and then when I took out the roast to shred it, I dumped what was in the cooker and added the other 1/2 with the shredded meat.  It was definitely the right amount of sauce.  I also added 2 tablespoons of maple syrup and 1/2 of water to cook the roast.  The roast actually only took 3.5 hours to cook plus another 1/2 hour after I shredded it.  Definitely will do this one again.

I enjoyed this concept - I used pork instead of beef and I also added a little hot sauce with the bbq sauce.  I tried other reviewers' tips to drain the bbq sauce off after cooking and then add fresh bbq sauce. This makes it much better.

So very good!  I used Montgomery Inn bbq sauce and it was unbelievable. I did not have a problem with the fat skimming off the top.  Perfect for a weeknight meal or family gathering!!!  Keeper recipe.

I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because you really have to follow other posters advice and drain the meat when you shred it and add a fresh bottle of BBQ sauce, what was in there was WAY too thin.  But following that added step it turned out wonderful.

I used an eye of round roast, sliced onion and KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe as posted. It was very tender and delicious!

I've made this a lot and we really enjoy it. I have made double batches for parties and people always ask for the recipe. It is  so simple they can't believe it. Sometimes I add a bit of ketchup and some water to it. Delicious!

Pretty good. Next time I will make sure I have enough cook time. This time I was rushed and cooked it on med/hi for 6 hours and ended up with only semi-tender meat. I think a low for 10 hours would have made it much tastier. Also, next time I will use a barbeque sauce that is not so sweet.

Very nice ..... our family has never made meals like this before "Canadians" :)
My husband says --- he almost forgives me for not making a Roast Beef, Yorkshires, Gravy, and Potatoes.... with the roast I used for this recipe. That's a BIG compliment, as Roast is his favorite meal.
I will make this again. Mmmmmmmm!

Took other reviewers' advice and drained some of the fat/juices when shredding the meat and then added another partial bottle of sauce.  Very easy meal, and both my little ones loved it (surprised me!).  Used a "sweet & zesty" bbq I liked, but think I might try something with more of a kick next time.

This BBQ was great! I cooked this on high for 5-6 hours. When I tried to shred it with forks, it wouldn't budge. So I transfered the roast to a cutting board, sliced it, and returned it to the pot. I cooked it on high for another 1-2 hours, then the shredding was easy. I used our favorite sauce, Sweet Baby Rays Original. This made for a delicious sandwich on potato rolls. I served this with kettle cooked potato chips and cole slaw on the bun.

this was awesome, i used 2 blade roast so that we would have lots of leftovers.  I also used the whisky bbq sauce from this site like others did, but i found that it made alot of bbq sauce.  I'm thinking that next time and there will be a next time, I won't add as much bbq sauce in at first but if needed i will add after i have pulled the meat apartr

This was very good.  Made it twice.  It helps to use a barbeque sauce you really like. The first time I tried a new barbeque sauce and we didn't like the sauce as much.  Second time we stuck with our favorite barbeque, it helped a lot!

Delicious.  Definitely a new favorite in our house.   Make sure you taste and looooove the bbq sauce you use.  Stubbs is good, so is Barbie's Award Winning recipe you can find on allrecipes.  Shred the beef really well; it can be difficult to bite through little chunks.

What an AWESOME recipe! I have 8 children so I do double this up and it still turns out perfectly!  I like lots of garlic and onion so I shake in more of this as well as some brown sugar if the BBQ sauce isn't sweet enough.  Once I drain and shred, I put it back in the cooker.  I always drain the cooking liquid off when I take out the roasts to shred them and add new BBQ sauce at that point.  I have left this to simmer for hours and it only gets better!!  My family likes it on good stiff buns so it soaks up lots of the BBQ sauce.  The boys will add a thick slice of cheddar cheese to theirs for a different taste, especially if they think it is too sweet.  Absolutely a no-brainer on this one!!

This is a very easy recipe and is really good if you choose a good barbecue sauce.  Just pick your favorite one and you should be fine.  I recommend using a firmer type of roll - if the bread is too soft it soaks up the juices too quickly and becomes soggy.  If you only have a soft roll - toast it first and it should be fine.

This was a delicious change from pork BBQ sandwiches.  I followed the recipe except I waited until after I shreded the meat to add the BBQ sauce, and put them all back in the slow cooker to heat thoroughly.  That way it wasn't as messy.

This really was a great barbeque. Just make sure you get the right cut of meat. I spiced it up a little with hot sauce, but other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect. Will make again.

This was excellent!  
I used half of the bottle of BBQ sauce at first and added the rest towards the end.  My husband begged for more!  I really would not change a thing myself.   My family doesn't like things very spicy but if yours does....spice it up!  YUM!

This was good but a little dry.  I added a can of beef broth instead of the BBQ sauce while it was in the crock.  I dump out all of the sauce then added in the BBQ sauce about an hour before serving.  It was just OK.  I am not sure if I will make it again or not.  I will have to spice it up again if I do.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't horrible.

Great & Easy recipe.  The bbq sauce was a little burnt so next time I will add half way through or try a thinner sauce.

I used London Broil and it was very tender.  Very BBQ taste.  Tasted great.

Extremely simple and tasty recipe. I followed the recipe with the exception of the second hour of cooking. It was still wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe for a 4th of July barbeque. Added two bottles of Kraft barbeque sauce and cooked on low about 11 - 12 hours. Meat shredded very easy. Served the next day reheated with extra sauce - everyone really loved. Great and easy recipe.

This was very good.  When I took the meat out to shred it, I removed the fat before placing it back into the crockpot and that made my husband very happy.  I will try it with a honey bbq sauce next time (not a store brand original) but it was still very tasty.  We served it on rolls and it was messy so we will serve it without rolls and with sides next time too.

I used a pork roast.  Had to drain and add new BBQ sauce for last hour.  Husband really liked, the kids and I are not big on BBQ but it was okay.  Too much fat for me, next time I will try a piece of meat with less fat on it.  Also needs to cook 8 hours before shredding the meat.

This was amazing.  Like previous reviewers I do not think you need to drain the crock pot and add another bottle.  I loved it so much and so did my family.  Will definately be using in our menu rotation.  We were saying "MMMMMMMMMM"  with every bite.  Thanks for submitting the fast and super easy recipe.

I can't believe how easy this barbeque is.  My wife said it was the best barbeque she has ever had.  We used a Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and it was GREAT.  We'll definitely put this in the menu rotation.

Just tried this tonight. It was ok, but I too had to take it out and use a knife to shred it. I used a spicey bbq sauce which probably wasnt that great of an idea. But all in all this was easy and good. Great with corn and cucumber salad. :)

I did like many others suggested and added a second bottle of bbq sauce after the meat was cooked. Turned out yummy, filling, and easy to make. Thanks for a great recipe Brandy!

This was very good.  I have 3 teenage boys in the house, so this was an easy way to fill them up.  I used ABOUT 4 LBS. of "Beef strips for BBQ" instead of the chuck steak, and a bottle of sweet baby ray's bbq sauce and added two chopped onions.  I cooked on low for 8 hours, shredded than simmered on high for about 35 mintutes.  Served on hoagie rolls with some raosted potatoes..  Very good, easy and an inexpessive dinner with some leftovers!

This was just OK.  I thought that it needed some extra kick; I'm not sure what.  I also had a hard time shredding the meat with just forks.  I had to get out the knife and chop the meat.  In a nut shell, nothing special.

Great recipe! I used a 1 1/2 pound chuck roast and Famous Dave's barbeque sauce. I used a mixture of two different flavors. I thought it was really sweet, but the boyfriend loved it.

This recipe was really good but I don't agree with the servings. For a three pound roast, it may feed six people with one small sandwich per person. When I make it next time, I'm getting a bigger roast.

I've had this sitting in my recipe box, untried, for almost two years!!! Finally, yesterday I used london broil (GREAT sale price)this weekend and it was delicious.  I cooked it for about 8 hours and then we decided to go out for pizza (never turn down a meal out!!).  So, I shredded the beef, put it into a rubbermaid container, and reheated it tonight for dinner.  Served on nice sub rolls with sliced swiss cheese along with a greek pasta salad and we all enjoyed it.

This is tasty and easy.  Good game-day, tailgate party fare.  I'd suggest using PORK SHOULDER for the tenderest results.  You won't have to add water.  I used a fresh onion, too, instead of onion powder.

I didn't have any onion powder so I doubled the garlic powder. It didn't seem to me that 1 18oz. bottle of BBQ sauce was going to work so I added another (total of 1 honey, 1 original). I thought without adding water the sauce would char, even on the low setting, but it was fine. My husband took one bite of this and thought he'd gone to heaven! You know it's good when he says "You can have whatever you want if you ask me now."

A great, easy recipe which everyone loved.  I used KC Masterpiece Spicy bbq sauce and chuck roast.  The meat was not anywhere near "shreddable" after the 8 hour cooking time, so I had to cook it about 3 more hours.  Then I shredded it and cooked it another hour. Next time, I think I'll use a different cut of meat. Nevertheless, a wonderful recipe.  I also served it with "Angie's Dad's Coleslaw" recipe from this site, which was a real winner.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe is perfect!!!  Sooooo yummy.  My husband, 6 yr. old and picky 4 yr. old absolutely loved it and they all raved about it. I used fresh chopped onion and 1/2 the bottle of barbeque sauce with 1/2 a cup of water instead, and it was perfection.  I added the other half of sauce at the end after I shredded the meat - WOW!!!

It is hard to believe something this good is so easy to make. I have made it several times, both with beef and pork. Pork has very little fat to drain. I use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce which is excellent. It is better than any I've tasted in a restaurant. Try it in a quesadilla - Yummy!

I made this for my husband who is from Texas. I had never heard of it before but he raves about it, so I tried this recipe and its great. Just use a good sauce that you know you like.

I thought this was good, but one important thing to note.  Make sure you use a bbq sauce that you've tried and loved.  I used one I hadn't tried prior to making this and that's why it was just okay to me. I will make again with another bbq sauce I'll try first.

Excellent and easy!  I used pork roast, and I did what a lot of reviewers recommend - drained the juices when I shredded the meat and added a new bottle of sauce.  My husband loved it as did my one year old.

I used pork shoulder and Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy Barbeque sauce - I only needed 18 ounces - did not need to add more - it was moist and delicious - I had no leftovers!

My family really enjoyed this recipe and we'll definitely have it, again. The only change or addition I made was that I added some sliced onion to the crockpot.  I used a chuck roast and followed the advice of the other reviews.  I drained the crockpot and added another bottle of barbeque sauce during the last hour of cooking.  The meat was tender and had a lot of flavor.  As a special treat, I served homemade french fries with it.  Thanks for a great recipe, Brandy!

Delicious and easy!  After the initial cooking time, when shredding the meat, I drained off the cooking juices and bbq sauce--it was a little to thin and greasy for my taste.  After shredding I did place back in the crockpot and added another bottle of sauce and finished cooking--it was terrific!

I would use a cut of meat that is less fatty - just so I don't have to trim it after it has been cooking.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and it was great!  This was easy and DELICIOUS,

Being from deep in the Deep South, I like my barbecue to be running down my hands when I'm eating it and making a big ole mess. This was definitely not a "Red, Hot, and Blue" copycat recipe. Too dry. There are better recipes out there.

I made this for my Bible study group last night and everyone loved it.  I did as other reviewers suggested and pour off the juice at the end and add fresh bbq sauce.  I ended up having to use a different flavor but it still turned out great.  Will diffently be making this again

This was kinda bland and runny at the end.  Next time I make it I will drain it when I take the meat out for shredding and then add more BBQ Sauce.  Going over the reviews..this seems to be something others are suggesting. 

The whole family loved it!  We let it drain before putting it on buns then added a little more sauce.  It was great the next day too!

This was so quick and easy!  I think the taste has a great deal to do with the barbeque sauce you use, too.  I used KC Masterpiece Honey Steakhouse with some cubed Top Sirloin we had on hand and we had to put the leftovers away so that we would stop picking at it and actually have leftovers for lunch!

I made this on a recent camping trip for 11 people including 7 young children.  It was a hit!!!  I used KC Masterpiece Barbecue Sauce and regular hamburger rolls.  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  I will not go back to the old traditional way of making this dish.  Why bother!!!!!!  A definite 5 stars!!!

dinner, and by the time I went through the line, 
it had vanished. I'm glad I tasted it at home,
because it was delicious. I used celery salt,
garlic powder and salt and pepper as my seasonings.

Very good and easy to make. Next time I would reserve about 1/3 of the liquid after cooking for 6 hours and add bottle of BBQ sauce to it.

This came out really good. My husband and kids liked this recipe. I put my own dry season on it, such as season salt, garlic salt, parsley, Greek season, lemon pepper and bbq season. I also used season blend from the frozen aisle. That tip on putting the shredded meat back into the sauce in the crockpot for an hour made it tender and flavorful!

Cooked in Dr Pepper with fresh onions, garlic, salt/pepper and chili powder. Then dumped out the liquid and continued cooking in Stubb's BBQ sauce for another couple of hours....took hints from other reviews. Turned out great!!

Delicious! My boyfriend hunts and we had a ton of venison left from last season, so I used some stew meat and a couple rib eyes. About 3 pounds. I had some "essence of emeril" left over from a previous recipe so I sprinkled the meat with about 2 tsp of it. Then smothered it in weber all natural hickory smoke BBQ sauce. It's still cooking but I sampled some and it almost tastes awesome. Going to serve it over some spicy quinoa I have left over, with diced red onions and celery to garnish. Can't wait!

This was a crazy easy recipe. Made this for my son & future daughter-in-law and they loved it. I used my favorite BBQ sauce combined with one that was more hot, gave the beef the perfect kick. I will definitely be making this again.

This has good flavor and smells delish, but in the future if I make it, I will use an oven roast instead.  This had way too much fat floating around for me to want to serve it to my family let alone eat it myself.  By the time I was finished fishing out the fat, there was only 1/2 left.

This is great, if you slightly brown a london broil all around in a pan first, and then put it in a crock pot for several hours, w/ little water. Then drain broth (don't discard)shred meat and then add KC Masterpiece original and cook for a few more hours. Don't add too much broth or water in it. If you do, it wont thicken up good and wont keep its flavor. We make this about 3-4 times a month. My family loves it

Cut off the fat before you brown the meat. and there will be none to fool w/ later on.

i dont add anything except the sauce and salt/pepper

This was EXCELLENT! I used Sweet Baby Ray's original barbecue sauce and Publix Premium chuck roast. Instead of the garlic salt, I used one packet of Lipton onion soup mix. I cooked this a little longer than required (I left it in my slow cooker until I got home from work). The beef was tender and juicy. My husband and I loved it, so I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Pretty Good.  I slow-cooked it for seven hours and the meat came apart easily.  I followed the advice of others and drained all the liquid.  I added only a half bottle of barbecue sauce (which was plenty) and cooked another hour.   I think next time I'll go with pulled pork instead of beef.

Pretty tasty - I added more BBQ since I used basically a whole bottle while the meat cooked and then added more after it was shredded.  I cooked the meat with onions and garlic cloves and it turned out pretty tasty for my first time.  I have to say that shredding beef is not my favorite activity and I had some battle scars, but worth it in the end. I may try a better quality of meat next time and that will probably make it easier to shred.  Good stuff :)

Had to cook it a bit longer that suggested and skim fat off (should have cut some of it off in the beginning) but this was delicious. Excellent for a pork salad, yum!

Excellent recipe!  One warning - with slow cookers, I tend to let things go and go and go...the sugar content in the BBQ sauce is so high that it will burn and taste a little scorched if you don't follow the times.  I know better for next time! Family raved anyway!

My husband was skeptical but the results were awesome! I cooked the roast in one bottle of bbq sauce, drained it, and poured a fresh bottle over it for serving. I added a few things to make it more our taste, too: approximately 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tbsp. liquid smoke, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and about 1/3 c. brown sugar. Yum!

This was an excellent delivery method for barbecue sauce.  I was not impressed with the meat.  It wasn't as tender as I thought it should be.  I cooked it for an additional hour, hoping it would become more tender.  Good thing I used a tasty barbecue sauce; otherwise it probably wouldn't have been fit to eat.

I make this all the time, especially when I know I won't have a lot of time to cook.  I like the fact that it's baked after it cooks, because it dries out the meat a little bit so that it's not so mushy.  My husband and I love this recipe!

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  The meat was very tough and couldn't be shredded.  The taste of the sauce was delicious though and saved the dinner.

Have made several times.  My family prefers BBQ sauce that is not too sweet with this dish.  KC Masterpiece seems to work well.  I drain the liquid and add new BBQ sauce for final hour of cooking.  This is so easy and tastes great.  A big hit with teenage boys.

I made this yesterday and it was excellent.  I was worried cause it didn't look all that good till I shredded it with a fork, and added bbq sauce, but it was great.  WE ate it by itself with mashed potatoes and corn.  Will definately make again.

I would definetely recomend this recipe, it is incredibly easy and you end up with a delicious result. I added more barbeque sauce at the end and used a vennison roast instead of beef otherwise following the recipe.

Made this for a family at church that had a baby.  Turned out good but not as spicy as I would prefer.  I would make again but if making for my family I would spice it up alot.

Let me start off by saying I never have any luck with anything to do with roast.  It always turns out tough.  WIth this, I used a chuck roast and followed the recipe to the "T".  However, my roast did not shred like I thought it should.  It was more of a sliced roast beef.  It could have something to do with the power being off for 2 hours during the afternoon.  Overall, just so-so.

This was very good.  I used KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce and a little bit of Baby Ray's when I ran out of KC.  My husband loved it.  It tasted pretty good to me too, though I didn't get my own sandwich because my husband hounded it.  :o)

Very good - although I suspect that it all depends on what bbq sauce you use - if you like the sauce, you'll like this dish.

Wonderful!  I did follow the suggestions to drain the bbq sauce it cooks in and add a new bottle.  Very good recipe!

I loved this! I'll probably omit or cut down the garlic next time, but that is a personal preference. I used Famous Dave's BBQ sauce. I froze the leftovers in sandwich sized portions, but they only lasted 2 days, so I don't know how well it freezes. : )

My family thinks its better than what you get at a restaurant.  It is so easy and shredding it makes for wonderful sandwiches on buns.  Add a few fried potatoes and you've got a quick meal!

We used our favorite BBQ sauce for this and we didn't like it at all.  It was too much BBQ and nothing else.  My husband LOVES BBQ but hated this.  Won't make this again.

This turned out perfect. The only change I made was to use a pork roast versus beef. The next time I make I will try it with the beef. This would even work with chicken

It was REALLY easy to make.  According to my fiance, it was good but not amazing.  He liked it better the next day cold.  I went with previous suggestions and used eye round roast.  Maybe not worth the $12.00 I spent on the meat for an average rating.  I will definately try it again in the future, but with something cheaper.

This recipe is user friendly. Very tasty,I recommend using fresh sliced onion. I used Dianas Maple Barbecue Sauce. I also tried this recipe with ribs. Put them on in the morning,before going to work. Delicious fall off the bone, serve with rice.

My husband ate 4 sandwiches of this beef tonight....I couldn't believe it!  This is very easy to make.  The only change I made was to add 1 cup of water after 2-3 hours of cooking, because it looked very dry, and I was afraid it would burn.

My husband raved about this recipe.  He ate every morsel of the leftovers as well.  I, on the other hand, thought it was only a little bit good, but I give it five stars because it is extremely easy to prepare, and I'm sure that once I switch up the cut of beef and the brand/flavor of bottled sauce, I'll eventually stumble onto a true keeper. Thanks for a great base recipe!

Great recipe!!  I made it for a luncheon at work.  I cooked it during the day the day before, shredded the meat, pitched the sauce that was in the pot, added a new bottle of sauce and then finished cooking it at work in the crockpot the morning of the lunch.
Everyone loved it.

This was absolutely delicious.  I made my own BBQ sauce and drained it halfway through and added fresh BBQ sauce.  I also made the "sweet dinner rolls" from this site for homemade buns.  My husband LOVED this!  So did I!  YUMMY!

Got a crock pot for Christmas after complaining that I was sick of fast food.  Mom picked out some recipes and this was the first attempt at cooking.  Super easy and the room mates loved it.  I used Bullseye Smokehouse Hickory BBQ sauce.  It tasted like beef jerky on a bun.  Will definatly make again

It was very easy, tender and juicy!! Also made great leftovers. Trust me, you will have them!! We used the two bottle method also. The BBQ sauce we used was from our favorite BBQ restuarant. Now, I don't ever need to go back b/c my meat tasted better. :-)

I used pork, as it was what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. My husband loved it. To me it lacked 'something'. My sauce might be at fault for that. We will make it again and try it with beef!

I used an eye round roast, and at the last hour of cooking drained the pot and added a new bottle of sauce. The meat was great. The meat was very tender and shredded easily and had a good BBQ flavor. My whole family loved it.

This had a really nice flavor...I used honey/garlic bbq sauce. My only complaint was that the meat was a bit tough...parts weren't and parts were. Maybe it was the cut??? Not sure but hopefully next time it'll be better.

This recipe was so easy and very very tasty!  I will definitely be making this over and over again.  One thing I did do different was use fresh minced onion/garlic.  I also used pork roast and did not have to drain any juices. Thanks Brandy!

It's good for a slow cooking. The best thing is the taste of the food is depends on us by putting your favorite bbq sauce. I did the same thing what most of the reviewers did, when I shred the meat I also drain the meat juice and replaced with another bottle of bbq sauce... For a start I used Jack Daniel's Whiskey Barbeque sauce. Then as for the 2nd bottle of sauce, well, I had several bbq sauce and we ended-up having bbq sauce tasting. I decided that I like the vinegar taste of one of the sauce and the smokey/ sweet taste of the other, so I mix them together and use it toward the end of cooking the food. It was great! It tasted just the way we like.

This was certainly easy to make and ok for taste.  A bit of messy eating if you have children but otherwise a good meal.

Not bad.  Really easy.  Make sure to have plenty of napkins on hand...this one is messy!  Flavor wasn't all that great, however, that may simply be due to the brand of BBQ sauce I used (I have yet to find one that I really like).  As far as prep time, it was a breeze.  I shredded it and put it back in the sauce for another 45 mins prior to serving.

This recipe was very bland. Perhaps it was the bbq sauce I used, kc masterpiece. But it had little flavor and wasn't real tender. The family was unimpressed...I think I'll keep searching...

So easy and so good! This was the first thing I ever cooked in a crock pot. Now I'm hooked. Who knew it could make beef so tender! I used KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce. Carving the beef was the most time consuming part, which wasn't all that bad. I served on Kaiser rolls. Excellent. Now I just need the low fat version!

Excellent taste and very easy to make!  I have also substitued a packet of lipton onion soup for the garlic and onion powder.  Tasted just as good!  Family and friends can't get enough of this and I'm always asked for the recipe at potlucks.

Despite my three year old asking for the recipe, I didn't like this as well as a different recipe where you make the sauce.  The key must be getting the right bottled sauce.  Good but didn't knock my socks off.

It's A Keeper!  I made this last night and I couldn't stop picking at it throughout the day.  The aroma is intoxicating.  My husband came home and said "wow, it smells fantastic in here".  The meat was so tender and tasty. I definately will make this again. (I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and it turned out great!)

I purchased the suggested meat in the recipe and was disappointed.  Maybe a different cut of meat would be preferable.
