This was delicious! My oven was full, so I just cooked it on the stove, by covering and simmering for 20-25 mins. I will make this again!

This was one of the easiest and best recipes I've tried.  It came out with a nice, slightly caramelized flavor and wasn't sticky.  A definite time saver when you don't want a complicated pilaf.

This recipe looks identical to a Craig Claiborne recipe my family has relied on for years. It reliably makes a moist and flavorful pilaf. You can brown some chicken tenders and lay them on top halfway thru baking for a nice combo meal.

Quick and easy, especially if you use a rice cooker. Simply sautee the onions in butter, add the rice and continue sauteeing until lightly browned. Transfer the rice to the rice cooker and add broth. Cook as usual in the rice cooker. So simple!

This rice is easy to make and super delicious!  I have made both as written, and also with a few changes.  When frying the onion I also add 2 cloves of garlic and chopped up carrot (or sometimes with a frozen veggie mix - carrot, beans, peas and corn).  I then spray the pan with cooking spray.  When I transfer the rice to the dish I add another approx. 1/8 cup of chicken broth.  I then stir rice about every 10 mins to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the dish or from getting to crunchy on top.  When cooking I also add about another 1/8 cup of broth.  I have cooked the rice at 350 as well (due to having something else in the oven) and cooked it for an extra 10 minutes - I did not have to add the extra broth during cooking this way.  This rice is fantastic - my husband requests it at least once a week, enjoy!

My husband told me twice how good this rice is.  I added a little bit of minced garlic after the onion was done.  Instead of baking it, I added the broth then brought it to a boil over medium heat.  Then I turned it down to simmer and covered it.  It took 15 minutes for the rice to absorb the broth.  Definitely will make again!

Great basic recipe to modify to your tastes!  I paired mine with baked chicken.  Instead of using 2 cups of broth only, I used the drippings/marinade from the baked chicken and added broth to equal the two cups of liquid needed.  I also added a small can of mushrooms.  I omitted the onion and salt due to the presence of both in the marinade.  I did brown the rice in the butter.

Not only is this simple recipe super yummy, but it can EASILY be turned into some of the best fried rice you've ever had!!

I made a double recipe of this, adding only peas.

The next day there was a ton left over and I wanted more of the egg flavor, so I decided to head up some leftover rice by frying it in a pan, broke in an egg and scrambled it in, and then added soy.  OMG!!! It's the best fried rice I've EVER had, like Habachi style and sooooooo yummy, that I actually use this as the base for my fried rice now!

Simple and very flavorful. Only thing I added was some fresh minced garlic. I used my own homemade chicken broth. Went nicely with Swedish Meatballs.

The first few times I made this, I followed the recipe exactly........perfection !!!!  So easy and I love that it is cooked off in the oven. The great thing about this recipe is you can take it so many places....adding herbs & spices or garlic to accompany the rest of your meal which is what I do now. I love it & so does my family. So say good-bye to all  Rice-A-Roni flavors  FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I really love this recipe!  The first time I made it I didn't have chicken broth so I used beef broth and added mushrooms and halved the onions, otherwise I followed the recipe.  It was awesome and I will be making it for years to come.  The second time I made it I followed the directions exactly and found it a bit too oniony.  So I will continue to use half of an onion rather than a whole one.  All together a great, easy and very tastey rice recipe that will be added to our regular meal rotation.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This was excellent! I made as written except I only had brown minute rice so used that. The onions just made the rice so savoury and delicious. This is the type of recipe that you could easily add in different veggies, spices etc. to suit your tastes but is also great as is. I did make this on the stove top and then the oven but if your oven is in use, I'm sure this would also work fine if you finished on the stove top. Thanks for sharing this delicious, versatile recipe, Elaine!

So easy, so simple.  Made it with the chicken cordon blue II.  I didn't time it right, so I added a touch more broth, turned off the oven and left the rice in there until the chicken was done (another 20 minutes).  It was PERFECT!

I followed it exactly and didn't get much flavor.  I mean it was good, but just tasted like rice with a few onions in it.  I was hoping for a more chicken-y, cream-y, pilaf-y dish.  I'd make it again because it was better than just plain white rice boiled in water, but wouldn't use this for a "pilaf" recipe.

This is a good base for any leftover meat and vegetables I have on hand.  On its own, it's a bit bland for my family's taste.  A bit of salt and garlic tends to fix that, if we don't just add a splash of Tabasco.

I wanted to serve this with a Mexican meal, so I substituted a little tomato sauce for some of the chicken broth. It's my new favorite Mexican rice. I like to have it without hot spices to balance the hot chilies in other dishes on the same plate.

I thought this was a very good basic pilaf though it was a bit bland.  This was acceptable to me as my family tends to like bland foods.  However, tossing it with some vegetables might make it taste better.

Thanks for sharing, I followed the receipe and only added  2 cloves of crushed garlic  with the onions.  Very yummy, had with pan seared dry scallops.  By far the best rice pilaf I have ever tasted!  Cannot wait until tomorrow to make fried rice with the leftover rice.

Awesome dish however, I doubled up and threw in a few accesories like Cilantro, minced garlic, oregano and an envelope of spanish sazon (I'm from the caribbean). All I can say is that my party guest were licking the plates. Thanks

This was exactly what I was looking for in a rice dish. Didn't want anything crazy and with ingredients we had around the house. Be sure to add some salt (we use salt free chicken broth), it makes a big difference, and don't feel like you have to skimp on the onion. This turned out wonderfully, will make again!

This recipe is my "go-to" for Pilaf. Packaged Pilaf is overloaded with salt. This gives you control over the sodium level. Sometimes I add orzo or vermicelli pasta & chopped parsley.

I've always struggled making good rice on the stove. This is about as simple as it gets and works every time. Be sure to let the rice rest 5 to 10 minutes before fluffing, it helps. I like to add a couple cloves of minced garlic at the end of the onion cooking also.

Just like what was promised - quick and easy!  I added additional seasonings (garlic powder and some pepper) and no salt since we are watching our sodium intake. The rice came out light and fluffy.  Much better than stove top cooking.

I did not follow the recipe exactly. I continued cooking it on the stove top after boiling the broth and let it simmer about 15 minutes. Should have gone longer as it was a bit al dente. Will do that next time. Flavor was great!

This reminds of a recipe called "Perfect Rice" from my hippie days. I only used 1/2 tsp of salt, but a full teaspoon is probably what it really needed.

This is so easy and delicious! I will never make the boxed stuff again. My boyfriend asks for it all the time. I love how the onions soften up and add a little sweetness to the rice. YUMMY!!

I'm a big rice person but this for some reason was kind of bland and the rice was not as fluufy and soft like when I make them my old fashioned way.  Very disappointed!

A good basic recipe but far too much onion for my taste.  And I put onion in almost everything I cook.  Next time I'll either double the rice or only use half an onion and toss some garlic in, too.  Very easy to make.

I loved this quick and easy! However I doubled it so I did not have a dish large enough to bake it in so I just finished it on the stove in my large sauce pan. I used my homemade chicken broth that had shredded chicken in it and it turned out great in the rice. I also added some cumin and crushed garlic. YUM

This rice was simple but still very tasty. It was just a simple butter flavored rice but goes great with a flavor filled dish. I'm trying to get better at cooking rice and this came out perfect for me so really easy to follow. My family ate every bite of it!

I added a bit more chicken stock and added a can of mushrooms that I chopped up.  My family loves it so thank you for this recipe.  Finally a way to use rice that my family likes!
Next time I am going to try to add some toasted orzo pasta to see how that goes.

Good flavor. It didn't seem to be cooked enough (the rice was a little chewy), but that may have just been the very old oven.

What a great recipe!! I used jasmine rice since I think it is more flavorful than ordinary white rice and I added a teaspoon of minced garlic. Otherwise made as directed and it was spectacular, I honestly could have eaten the entire bowl by myself.

Made a few changes.  Didn't have chicken broth so used 6 chicken cubes and 4 cups of water.  Also added garlic powder and pepper to suit our tastes.  Turned out good. Will probably make again.

Simple dish. The only change I had to make was using bullion cubes and water instead of chicken stock because I was out. I look forward to making it again soon.

Made this tonight per recipe for the most part, used Jasmine rice instead of Long Grain White. Turned out wonderful. This will be on regular menu now, will get some white rice next time. Tanx for the recipe.

I am not a very good cook, but this turned out fantastic. I made it along with spicy grilled shrimp as a mild side dish, but it stole the show!

As is, this is super easy and fast to make.  I love that I can decide to make this very late in the day and I usually have the necessary ingredients on hand.  My husband (HUGE fan of rice, but not usually one to take second helpings of anything) gobbled this up until it was gone the first time I made it.  Instead of broth, I use a refrigerated chicken base - I just think the flavor is great - and I also leave out the salt, as the chicken base is quite salty.

It was just OK, very bland.  I added garlic and still it needed something more.  Might try again as a basis for rice pilaf but will definitely be checking the spice cabinet.

I was looking for a easy side dish and I didnt really have much to work with. This was such an easy recipe with stuff i always have in my pantry!! My oven was full so i did it on the stove top (as read in some reviews) and it was so delicious!! Also a good starting point, on other nights i think i will experiment with this one! thanks for saving my dinner tonight!!!

This was so easy to make, and it was delicious! I prepared it exactly as directed except for using garlic salt instead of regular salt.  The onions give it a semi sweet flavor.  This one is a definite keeper!

Great recipe if you want to make it vegetarian, use Knorr vegetable base to flavor the 2 cups of water instead of chicken broth.  Saute some fresh chopped mushrooms & finely diced carrots  with the onion.  Basmati rice is best for a fluffy texture.  You can also add some turmeric and saffron in small amounts to taste.  It's a family favorite.

Great recipe!  So easy.  I added a bit of minced garlic and pine nuts to flavor up a bit.  Thanks for sharing.

So basic and easy yet soooo delicious. I sprinkled a little dried parsley while frying to compliment a steak and scampi dish. I also served this with a curry dish and had added raisins sprinkled cinnamon after frying just before placing in the oven.

I thought the flavor wasnt good and it took forever to cook and then was still really soggy.
