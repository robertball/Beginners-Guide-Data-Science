A staple for your spice rack. Your first instinct may be "why go through all this trouble when I could use ground cardamom?". Don't fall for the easy route. This is well worth the time and elbow grease. I used a pestle and mortar. I enjoyed this in my tea and mixed with some butter on my biscuits. I'm not a fan of cinnamon and this gives you a nice spice twist without that woody/barky flavor of cinnamon. Thank you for the recipe.

My original recipes recommends grinding about a teaspoon of cardamom seeds, once they're removed from the tough husks. Enjoy!
