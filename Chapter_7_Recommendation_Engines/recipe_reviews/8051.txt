I've made this cake 9-10 times and only came here to print off a clean copy.  I'm shocked by the low reviews and problems reported because this comes out for me every time as high, fluffy, moist, and delicious.  If you substitute butter for the shortening, you'll have the cake that made the Magnolia Bakery in Greenwich Village famous.

Perfect, just as I was hoping it would be when I saw that this recipe called for shortening rather than butter. The little bit of butter flavor that's sacrificed is more than made up for by the fact that you gain incredible moistness, since butter cakes can have a tendency to be dry. I'm sure the recipe is perfect as is, but for added richness, moistness and color I added two more egg yolks.  For the lightest texture, be sure to cream the shortening and sugar very well, 2-3 minutes if using a stand mixer. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. When adding the flour mixture with the milk, begin and end with the flour. Thanks for posting the recipe - I couldn't have been more pleased!

Very delicious. I've been looking for a good recipe using all-purpose flour (instead of cake flour) and this is it. I used the exact ingredients but increased the recipe to fill an 11x15 pan. I got a little nervous when the middle didn't crown but it was fully cooked, I didn't have to level it off and the texture was better than I expected. Thanks!!

** Revision **  I made this for the 2nd time today and the finished texture was very light and fluffy! Thorougly creaming the shortening & sugar is definitely the answer. I didn't have enough shortening so I ended up using 50/50 shortening/butter, which I beat together for a few minutes before adding the sugar. The creamed mixture should look silky and light, sort of like whipped butter. After I added the last of the milk, I turned the mixer speed up a little (one setting above "stir") and beat for about 30 sec. The batter looked smoother this time and had a nice body to it, not runny as with some box mixes.  This recipe does work and will be my only yellow cake from now on.  Thanks SO MUCH!

This is an 'award winning' recipe! I've been making it for the past 2 year and this summer entered a cake in the local fair. There was enough batter in one recipe to make 3 short 8" round layers, I used coconut flavoring instead of vanilla and homemade buttercream. I won first place and best of show, one of the judges wrote on my tag that it was one of the best cakes she had ever eaten!

Finally the moist cake I've been looking for-I used all butter and made my own chocolate icing.Great.In fairness if you are not used to making scratch cakes,give a few times to perfect your technique here. You can't expect to have your first scratch cake come out great and must follow directions.Ingredients act differently if not done according to directions. It's a keeper and am adding a pic. Will say though it was hard to get out of greased pan, will use parchment on bottom next time.

I did not have a box of yellow cake mix, so decided to try this as I had the ingredients on hand. Not very impressed with this recipe at all. It seems to have too much sugar, as it doesn't rise well and then the sugar caramelizes and forms a hard crust on the out side. The texture was dry and crumbly and did taste a little like cornbread, but not even good tasting cornbread. I felt bad to waste my home made raspberry buttercream on this cake, but that was the only thing that made it edible for my hubby and kids. It is still sitting on the counter being ignored. If you want moist and yummy yellow cake, use 1 box of yellow cake mix and add all called for ingredients, then add an additional egg + a 3.9 oz. box of jello instant pudding. That is a yellow cake worth eating!

This is the first time I have ever made a cake w/o using a box. I did however read over other recipes and made a few adjustments to this one and it turned out better than I anticipated. First I used 1/2 cup shortning and 1/2 cup butter. I also used 3tsps of vanilla and only 2 1/2 tsps of baking powder. Everything else stayed the same. I would recommend this recipe to both new cake makers and seasoned makers.

Wonderful, easy yellow cake recipe!  I used half butter and half butter-flavored shortening and added one extra egg (guess I could call it five egg yellow cake) and baked it in two 9 inch cake pans. I could tell just by the batter this was going to be a moist, delicious cake.  It's worthy of you're best chocolate icing!  I used "Chocolate Butter-Creme Icing" from this site.  This one's a definite keeper.

This is the perfect basic yellow cake recipe. Light and fluffy, yet moist. It has excellent flavor (I did use the 1/2 shortening-1/2 butter suggestion). I don't understand how people get the cornbread taste or texture. However, be sure to really cream the shortening and sugar VERY well-this can have a huge effect on the end result and really mix all the ingedients thoroughly if you want to right texture (I use a Kitchen Aid stand mixer). This is now my  base cake for my mom's favorite Hawaiian cake!! Thanks for sharing this recipe with all of us!!

My first attempt at this recipe was a disaster, however after reading countless reviews I figured out where I went wrong, and compiled the information for my review. It IS possible to make this cake and have it rise and taste like excellent yellow cake (and not like some kind of mess thereof). I will summarize what I think would help somebody in my predicamentâ€”fairly new to making scratch cakes. First, use all shortening and mix with the sugar very well as many reviewers suggested that not mixing well into a creamed texture was the cause for many mishaps (no, the sugar wont be entirely dissolved). Second, Adding one egg at a time during mixing was a preferred method. If you use ALL butter instead of shortening, be aware that your cake could separate during baking (eggy top and tough gummy bottom) which some had described was similar to a chess cake effect. I used all butter the first time and the cake came out this wayâ€”I ended up tossing the mess. Instead I used butter flavored shortening as recommended by other users. Use all purpose flour and you donâ€™t need to sift it.  There are lots of variations that can be done and good for the more experienced bakersâ€¦but I tried to compile a review that could help the beginner avoid adding more variables and chances for error. Thank you to all the previous reviewers who gave such great explanations for common cake baking issues in this recipe! It was the previous reviewers that gave me impetus and information to try again and make it

I made the recipe with 5 eggs and used 1/2 cup shortening, 1/2 cup butter.  Came out very light and airy.  Baked it in a bundt pan @ 350 for 55 minutes. May add a little more vanilla next time.  Very good basic yellow cake recipe...especially if your short on time/ingredients.

Ah-mazing!  I read quite a few reviews and altered the recipe just a bit.  I used 1/2 cup softened butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening.  I also added 1 tsp of almond extract with the 2 tsp vanilla.
Here are a few tips for baking-newbies: Proper creaming of the shortening/butter and granulated sugar is a MUST and is key to a light, fluffy cake.  I usually cream my butter/shortening/sugar for about 5 minutes until it is very light and fluffy.  I use a KitchenAid stand mixer, but you can get the same results with a hand mixer.  Sift the flour first, spoon into measuring cup and level off with the straight edge of a knife.  Don't shake it!  This is Martha Stewart's way of measuring flour and it has never steered me wrong in recipes that don't use weights.  And my last and most important advice is to make sure your eggs and milk are at room temperature, not cold straight out of the refridgerator.  Room temperature eggs and milk combined with proper creaming and measuring of flour will give you a superior, moist, fluffy cake!

You should not rate a cake poorly if you alter the ingredients.  Many used butter and omitted shortening altogether.  Butter alone, while tasty, lends to a drier cake.  The shortening gives cake the moistness.  Those who thought the cake was dry should either bake the cake as printed or should use half butter/half shortening.

I love this recipe! No shortening on hand, so I substituted 2 sticks of butter. I can definitely see how some people might have problems with this cake, but if you do, you should probably get a little more practice in with making scratch cakes before you rate this one. :) I was worried about this cake turning out dry, but a little advice about separating the eggs and adding the yolks alternately with the flour mixture and milk helped a LOT.  Cake turned out fluffy, moist, and perfect! no water bath needed, even for my crappy 70's oven that bakes funny.   I think the key is BEAT THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS out of that creamed mixture of shortening (or butter) and sugar!!! And then? Beat the  out of the mixture after EVERY EGG. Be patient. Take your time with it, watch your show or something on a laptop. Be kind with that milk, it started to curdle the batter really weird-like when I added it, so it was wee splashes at a time, just in case. If anyone can tell me it doesn't hurt to have that kind of reaction in the batter, I won't worry about it again, but note to all inexperienced cake makers: When in doubt, slow down, read the directions again, and mix WELL.

This cake was one of the best yellow cakes I ever made. The only thing I changed was I used real butter instead of the shortning. I also sifted the flour BP and salt together before adding it to the butter sugar mixture. When makeing any kind if layer type cake always sift the dry ingredients. This helps keep it light and it gives you a lighter fluffier cake in the end. Also make sure you cream the butter and sugar till it's really creamy and then add eggs one at a time and beat after each one till it's super creamy. This will also help avoid that really dense texture that some people were complaining about.

Cook time is too long.  WAY too long.  If I do this again, I'll cut at least 10 nminutes off the cook time, because 45 minutes gave me an overdone cake.  And this isn't my first rodeo.

I made this recipe side-by-side the Wilton Basic Yellow Cake... there's simply no comparison!
I made this exactly as stated [with exception of sifting the flour], even though I dislike using shortening, and it's incredible. We had a blind taste test for our family- my three year old and five year old both adamantly declared this one the winner, and my husband and I had no hesitation declaring this our favorite as well.

It is light, moist [incredibly, lovely and moist, so much like my favorite chocolate cake!], and very delicate. Not crumbly or grainy, or 'eggy' or dry, it is the perfect, PERFECT cake. I can't rave enough.
I have been searching years for the right cake to add to my recipe book [only tried and tested recipes get written down] and this has already been added!! Honestly, I have tested more recipes than I can keep track of now, nothing coming close to this. Phew, no more searching!

Thank you, thank you, for this lovely cake! It will be a highlight at many many birthdays to come.


Edit: I'm now reading the poor reviews in shock. This cake is absolutely not like cornbread [yes, I have come across this in other recipes!!], and is so light! I truly think this must be user error. I know after reading several cookbooks/baking books that mixing is key. Yes, creaming the butter is vital, but it's once all of the ingredients are combined that's key- mix it at least 1min on med/high after you think it's done. Try it!

This is an excellent yellow cake. Perhaps the best. I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect.  

Make sure to really cream the sugar/shortening to the max so its creamy, not crumbly. Add the milk/flour and beat just enough to mix it together and then STOP.  Do not over beat.  Cakes get tough when you do that.  

Cover with chocolate icing. You will love this cake.

I substituted 1 c. butter for the 1 c. shortening. Such a great cake! Moist, flavorful...not too sweet. Love it. I made cupcakes--the full batch made about 40 cupcakes (I filled them 1/2-3/4 of the way full, which was perfect, and baked them for 15 minutes per pan). This will be my go-to yellow cake recipe. No need to keep searching. Thank you so much for the recipe!

If you are used to boxed cake mixes, this is not the recipe for you! I am a very experience baker and followed directions very well. The texture is so-so, not really moist, but passable. The taste however, was very, very floury. I can eat without displeasure, but my family hated it. I usually make white texas sheet cake and that is what they ar used to. I probably won't waste my ingredients on this one again, but I won't throw away the one we have.

I made this in a 9x13 pan and I would say it is so good that icing is not required.  Really better than any box cake.  Nice and full, great texture & flavor and good color.  A keeper.  Thanks. Update: June 4, 2016 I still have this as my go to recipe for yellow cake. In fact, it is in the oven now.  Our favorite way to eat it is with fresh strawberries and cool whip.  I still never buy a box mix.

I am a pretty good cake baker but this recipe is the worst one I've ever made.  I give it a one star rating only because it did mix together well and looked really pretty before it was baked.  After that it was all downhill.  I don't understand where some people were able to get it to turn out with the texture of cornbread.  Mine turned out more like an egg custard with it's own crust.  I will not be making this recipe again and I discourage anyone else not to waste their ingredients or time on it either.

I made this cake, following the directions exactly, four days ago.

Usually things I bake have, at most, a two hour survival rate (and that's only if the two teenaged boys aren't home).

There's still almost 1/2 left of the cake.  Definately won't be making this again...... extremely disappointing!

This was really good! I was surprised it turned out as well as it did, since I only had a little bit of milk and had to use 3/4 cups of water. Plus, it was almond milk. I also followed what one reviewer said and seperated the eggs and beat the egg yolks in graually with the milk and flour. EXCELLENT. I used this cake for Honey Bun Cake which is usually gone in a few hours, and it was!! By the way I'm 14 and this is my second cake from scratch?

Excellent!  I used 4 eggs plus one yolk.  1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening.  2 heaping cups of sugar, "buttermilk" instead of regular milk. 1 tbsp of vanilla, and 1 tsp of butter flavor. I used cake flour but did not sift.  This cake came out so moist and flavorful.  I made a homemade chocolate icing the first time.  I'm making it again right now but going to frost it with a homemade caramel frosting. YUM!!

This is a fabulous recipe. VERY moist--tender and flavorful!! I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, kept all else the same but made cupcakes instead. It made almost 2.5 dozen. Baked for 22 minutes. Thanks Carolyn!!

I just made this cake yesterday and it was a hit at the office today. :-)  I followed the recipe as written, except that I used butter instead of shortening.  I split the cake and filled it with whipped cream, sliced bananas and strawberries and frosted both layers with the sweetened whipped cream.  It was delicious and there was not a piece left.  Thanks Carolyn for a great quick and easy yellow cake recipes.

This cake is awesome! It's always moist, always delicious, and always perfect. This is my go to birthday cake when I make fancy cakes for the kids. I use my own buttercream frosting recipe (passed down from my nana) and it's GONE before the end of the day! Never a crumb spared :-)

I rate this four stars because it stuck to my greased and floured pan, and also it was a bit crunchy on the edges. Other than that, loved it! I was a bit indecisive about what kind of cake I wanted so I ended up using two whole eggs and four egg whites. I made cupcakes and an 8 inch round from one batch. I will make this again with a little less sugar to get the crunch to go away.

This cake was perfect.  It was moist and fluffy and was not dense or dry like some other reviewers had described.  I frosted it with a chocolate frosting recipe from this site and the combination was better than anything I could buy at the store.  I will definitely be making this again for special occasions or whenever I have a desire for cake.  Thank you for an excellent recipe.

This is one of the best cake recipes ive ever made. Couple of pointers. 1) You have to beat the shortening and sugar at least 5 minutes. This is the secret to your cake being light and fluffy. At this point you really cant beat it too much. 2) Make sure your baking powder is fresh. And have all your ingredients at room temp. And alternate adding flour mixture and milk. If you just dump all of it in at once your cake will be heavy because you just took all the air you beat into it... out.

I  just made this yesterday and it was even better than I remembered. It's as light as and as fluffy as any box mix, but 100 times better tasting. It also doesn't round in the middle which makes cakes with multiple layers easier to do.

Rich, and delicious! I beat in the eggs one at a time; sifted the flour, baking powder, and salt; substituted butter for the shortening, and added one more teaspoon of vanilla extract. It probably would not have been nearly as good without all of these changes, so I recommend that everyone make these changes.

This is an excellent basic cake (definitely better with butter) and requires that the butter be very well creamed with sugar added gradually.  Certainly it takes longer than a cake mix but at least it tastes home made.   Thanks for a great recipe.

This cake is moist, soft, delicious! I didn't have a cup of shortening and I didn't even cream it correctly with the sugar and this cake still came out delicious! Most, very thick, southern style cake is what this is. Not the average thin, fluffy, box cake. This is the homemade tasty thick cake your mother made. This is a kepper! The edges might be crisp but this is a keeper with some buttercream frosting!

I am not an experienced baker at all but have had decent results with other cakes I have made, but this one didn't turn out so well. It didn't bake evenly at all. It didn't bake evenly and it does look a lot like corn bread. Any tips on what I might have done wrong? I would like a yellow cake that is light in texture, not too heavy and I prefer to not use a mix. Thanks!!

I followed this recipe to the 't', using all butter, no shortening.  I have to say, I was very disappointed.  It truly does have a cornbread type consistency.  It doesn't taste sweet at all...very 'bready' flavor.  If you don't like your cake sweet, then maybe this is a good thing.  The only positive I can say is that it was very moist & fluffy.  But I won't make it again based on the taste & consistency...think I'll go with the cake box recipe plus pudding & an extra egg that was recommended in other reviews.

This was a pefect and easy recipe with great results. I followed the recioe exactly, I used 1/2 cup (2 sticks of margarine) for the  shortening. This cake reminds me of an old fashioned scratch cake. Moist and dense.  A plus is that you use all purpose flour (vs cake flour) which most of us have on hand.  I made it for my family after a long snowy day. Quick and easy. Love It!

Fabulous homemade yellow cake recipe! Here's what I did: I used  real salted butter (I do not like to use shortening in anything that I make) and omitted the teaspoon of salt. Also it is important to CREAM the butter and sugar. Creaming should take about 5 minutes (maybe longer depending on the power of your mixer). The trick to a homemade cake batter is getting the butter light and airy before you add anything else. Beating in eggs/vanilla should only take about 2 minutes max. once you have added all of the ingredients together (and my preference is to end with the dry ingredients when I am alternating while mixing), you should mix on medium to medium high speed (once again depends on capability of your mixer) for about 2 minutes to ensure the air is added back into the batter for the light, springy texture you are looking for. Adjust mixing times accordingly depending on your preferences. This cake was delicious! Everybody at our New Year's Eve gathering loved it! Thank you!

Wonderful basic cake. Lovely crumb delicate flavor. I substituted buttermilk for the milk. I put it in the fridge for a few hours, the batter was thicker but after they baked it was lighter and puffed up higher. I also made cupcakes. Added orange zest and a little orange juice and then frosted it with chocolate. Amazing. My husband doesn't like frosting and loves these little cakes just plain.

This cake is very moist and flavorful. The only change that I made was instead of the shortening I use butter. I made this for the first time for alot of people that where getting together and it all disapeared. I even have to make it again this weekend. I would suggest that you make this and any other cakes at 25 degrees less and bake for 5 minutes longer. Like I said it was very moist and very flavorful.

I was out of shortening so used butter instead (measure for measure).  Light, moist, great texture.  Made 3 dozen cupcakes.  Will use again & again.

Delicious! This is the first time I ever made a cake from scratch. I followed the suggestions from others by substituting with: 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter; 3 tsp of vanilla; 2.5 tsp of baking powder. I made sure to thoroughly mix the butter/shortening with the sugar first and then added one egg at a time. I manually mixed each ingredient as instructed. The cake turned out extremely fluffy and light, and not overly sweet. Perfect!

This is a very good recipe for yellow cake. I substituted butter for the shortening. This cake has very good flavor, an excellent crumb and texture. It is almost like a pound cake. I added the eggs one at a time and mixed the batter well to incorporate the eggs. After all ingredients were combined, I mixed the batter for a full five minutes to incorporate air into the batter to make it smooth and creamy. I don't understand the reviews that say the texture was like cornmeal or had no flavor. I will say make sure that you are using the freshest ingredients possible and follow the directions. My cake turned out beautifully and my family enjoyed it. I will be making it again in a few weeks for my daughter's first birthday party. Thanks for the recipe!

Good, easy-to-make recipe.  Per other reviewer's suggestions, I substituted butter for shortening and it came out perfect.  I liked that the cake was a little more dense than some other recipes I had tried.  Very moist and flavorful.  I will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe last week for some bake sale cupcakes and was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, and at the end of mixing was concerned at the look of the batter. The cupcakes didn't rise very well, the tops of the cupcakes got crunchy and the sides of the foil were coated in melted shortening. They looked more like corn muffins than cupcakes. instead of rising well, the cupcakes flattened out on top and stuck to my baking tins, making cupcake extraction very difficult. They tasted okay, but not good enough for me to want to try this recipe again.

This recipe turned out spongy and tastes like eggs.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I knew something was wrong when it didn't rise up when I checked on it in the oven.  Also isn't anything like a yellow cake should be.  Very heavy cake.  Wouldn't try it again in the future!!

This cake was so good I forgot the vanilla but it was still awesome I got rave reviews at home. I used a butter cream icing that I found on here and everybody tore it up.  Will make again and again and again. Thanks

After reading all the rave reviews I thought "I must make this cake". 
  Well to say I am dissapointed is an understatement.
  It still sits on the counter uneaten.  The cake is so firm almost dry, but it isn't dry, it is just hard and stiff.  There is not much flavor either.  I even added 3 tsp of vanilla and still not much flavor.

  I am sadly dissapointed and will not be making this cake again.
  I was looking for a moist, flavorful yellow cake, I guess I will still be looking.

Excellent!!  I haven't had much luck with yellow cakes made from scratch; they always turn out dry.  That changed when I found this recipe.  This cake turned out perfect and so moist.  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  This will be THE ONLY yellow cake recipe I use.

This was the best homemade yellow cake I have ever had!  It was moist and flavorful.  I did use 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of butter flavor Crisco instead of shortening.  I frosted the cake with a butterscotch frosting and it tasted just like the Tastykake Butterscotch Krimpets I had when I was a kid!

I was excited about this cake because it looked so good when I took it out of the oven.  I was mistaken because when i took the first slice, it was gel like and not at all like the cake texture I was hoping for.

I am in agreement with the other reviewers who claimed this to be a good substitution for a "box mix." I love that the ingredients are all things I already have in my kitchen! I made the batter for this cake into cupcakes and it turned out perfectly. I plan to keep this recipe close at hand.

I over baked it, I did the 45 minutes and than realize I should have been watching it after about 35 minutes. For those of you that bake a cake and not a 13X9 watch it after 35 minutes.
I found it was very tastie and so did my family. I used a buttercream frosting, however, next time I make this I will be using a cream cheese frosting.

This is a really good yellow cake. Note it's a yellow cake, not a butter cake. Butter gives a cake a nice flavor but the texture of this is much better due to the shortening. Ive been looking for a good yellow cake for a while...and this is it for me. Its better after sitting covered at room temperature for a day or after being frozen and defrosted. I also use butter flavored Crisco in this. My family really likes this cake. Thanks for sharing!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I followed everything to a "T," and had to cover it in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for several hours before I could frost it. The cake was so dry we ended up throwing away 75% or more of it. I am giving it two stars instead of one because the time in the fridge in plastic wrap may have been partially to blame.

I made two 9 inch round cakes. I substituted 1/2 and 1/2 butter and shortening. The taste was okay, but the moisture was off a bit. I think 45 minutes was too long. Next time I'll try 35-38 minutes.

Finally found a yellow cake i can stay with, for it's texture and simplicity, although I did not have enough flour, so used Self Rising Flour   (Selfraising Flour in the UK) and left out the salt and baking powder, and used only 1-3/4 cups sugar, then added one cup of raisins to pick up the sweetness, didn't have butter so used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup crisco,( cant wait to use butter) as i didn't have any.  Next time I  will use lemon extract and zest for a change. ...Went down very well with my cuppa tea, cant wait to serve it to my friends, they will I'm sure ask for the recipe...... Thank-you Carolyn.....Forgot to add I sprinkled slivered almonds on top, so they added a wonderful toasted crunch.

I've made this so often, I now have it memorized!  It always turns out perfect, whether you're making cake or cupcakes.  Make sure you blend the butter/shortening and sugar VERY well and sift dry ingredients (I combine them in a separate bowl and whisk to add air). Use cake flour if you have it.

The "Special Buttercream Frosting" recipe on this site is delicious with this cake!

Made this recipe for a friend; fantastic stuff! Rich without being sickeningly sweet. We subbed out butter for shortening and covered it in foil while it was in the oven, but two thumbs up!

Cake crumbled.  I agree with others that taste is cornbreadish.  Edges got to cooked and crispy like a cookie.  Inside cake was airy and fluffy texture.  Cake didn't come out of pan and is a crumbled mess.  Won't try again.

Delish!  I substituted 1/4 cup flour for 1/4 corn starch (a trick for when you don't have cake flour) and the cake turned out moist, soft, and crumbly.  Per another reviewer's tip, I added the eggs one at a time as well as started and ended with the flour mix when beating that in with the milk.  
Really, really good recipe!

I'm not sure how fair this review is since I used it as a base for the coconut cake III on this website, but it turned out really well regardless.  Changes I made were using butter instead of shortening, and adding a bit more vanilla.  Then per the recipe I was using I also added 1/4 c. cream of coconut, 1 pkg.vanilla pudding mix, coconut and walnuts.  The cake was seriously delicious and moist, it made three good sized layers and was just right for what I needed it for.  But as you can see I really modified the recipe so I am not sure how it would turn out as written.

Used this cake for pineapple upside down cupcakes and it worked perfect.  Bonus the batter is delicious (way better than a box)!

Great flavor, very moist, but a very fragile cake. I made this as a 2 layer cake and it broke apart on me. It stood up well with the frosting though (swiss buttercream!) This does have the perfect moist, crumbly sweet homemade "corn bread" taste that a good yellow cake should. I definitely didn't hate it, but would probably not make it again.

This was my FIRST homemade cake for my son's eleventh birthday. It got rave reviews from everyone. It was even better the next day as the icing melded with the cake more. I followed the suggestion of another review and used 1/2 c. shortening and 1/2 c. of butter. Perfect cake!

I thought making a cake with shortening sounded weird but after reading the other reviews I decided to try it with 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter. It was VERY dense, almost thick like cornbread. Maybe this would taste better if you replace the shortening with butter. "David's Yellow cake" (also on allrecipes.com)is FAR superior.

I agree with another reviewer, call it Cornbread Cake. Very good for cornbread, but not the birthday cake it was supposed to be. I mixed everything thoroughly, did half shortening/butter and added an extra egg. Cooked it perfect. Taking it out of the pan was difficult, it ripped some, but that's fixable. Then tasted the part that ripped and was so disappointed tasting the cornbread flavor. I won't be making this again.

I read many of the reviews and was somewhat hesitant to make it but finally decided to.  In order to try and avert other cook's mistakes, I used room temperature butter and C&H baking sugar.  I used a hand beater and mixed it for 3 minutes and the only changes I made was to use 3 tsp vanilla and used cake flour with no sifting.  The batter itself came out light and fluffy and has a great texture.  I made cupcakes which took about 25 minutes to cook.  They came out beautiful and come off the wrapper just fine as well.  The finished product is light and fluffy and tastes great.  I will be using the chocolate frosting off of the Hershey's cocoa canister to finish it off.  The cake itself does not look exactly yellow but it isn't white.  This cake seems like it would be great by itself or as a basic recipe to add other flavors and ingredients.  I would definitely make it again!

I think you should rename the cake Cornbread Cake. First bite, tastes like cornbread. Second bite, no tastes like cake. Third bite, yup, it's cornbread. The first cake I've ever made and it tastes like cornbread.

I admit that I accidentally used expired baking powder and may have substituted water for the milk incorrectly, but this cake was amazing! I brought it to work and it was gone in less than an hour. They keep asking me when I'm going to make it again! (a day later)

I made this cake hoping it was at least on par with a boxed yellow cake and was really disappointed. My cake did come out reasonably moist, but the flavor was not at all what I expected--it tasted more like cornbread than a cake. Next time I want to make a sweet cornbread I'll use this recipe, but for a cake it was really lacking.

I was disappointed that the cake didn't have more flavour.  I doubled the vanilla as some users recommended and then the "vanilla extract" flavour was way overpowering.  Next time I will try the recommended amount of vanilla and maybe another flavour of extract.

I really tried!! I am not an experienced cook, but I'm not a beginner. I tried so hard to follow everyone's directions, I creamed, I sifted... but this still did not work for me. It was dense like a brick.  Sorry I don't know what I did wrong... but I guess my suggestion is...Don't try this for the first time for someone else (like me who tried it for my new husband's birthday. My first cake for him! It was a good laugh for us, and he'll never admit it was bad! But I know it was!!)

i made this with butter instead of shortening and while it was moist it was to strong of an 'egg' taste, after that no flavor. I'm using this cake for a boston creme pie so hopefully the custard and ganache will help make it work. Probably will try one more time to make it because the high ratings bug me I usually agree with them and I want to give it one more shot.

Like several other reviewers I found this cake rather heavy and dense. I did follow the recipe exactly as written. My sons did not care for it and did not finish their slices. The flavor is good, it was the texture that turned them off. It was crumbly rather than fluffy.

Ahh, this was awful! IT TASTED LIKE EGGS. Even buttercream frosting didn't save it =(. It was so dense, I wanted a nice light cake! It didnt rise at all eitha! Wat a waste of all thoze ingredients :-(. It really just makes sense to buy a 1 dollar box of betty crocker or pillsbury cake mix.

One of the best cake recipes I've ever tried! It was a hit (especially with the grown-ups) at my son's birthday party -- everybody went for seconds and thirds.  I substituted soy milk for the milk and it still tasted wonderful, with a great moist texture. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I used this cake as a base for a marble sheet cake.  It was fabulous!  I used real butter instead of shortening, and beat the butter and sugar for over 5 minutes until very creamy.  I did think that the cocoa added a lot of flavor, so it is possible that the cake was a little bland as originally written.  But, the texture, height, and moistness was really good.

I was very disappointed with this cake.  Like other reviewers mentioned, it came out tasting a lot like corn bread.  It did not cook evenly.  I tested it in several different places and they all came out clean but I later discovered that the middle of the cake wasn't done.  I will not be making this again.

Very good taste and texture. I used butter instead of shortening for a butter-cake taste.  Goes together easily and quickly. My cake was done within 35 minutes in a dark metal pan, so it's important to test your cake before the timer goes off.

I followed the recipe to a T and everyone loved it. Just the right amount of sweetness and the body was moist, fluff and held up well. I would recommend this cake to anyone.

Usually whenever I have to make yellow cake, I just use a boxxed mix, but this time I wanted to shake things up while making Boston Cream Minis... I was a little dubious my first time making this, but I'm glad I did. This recipe was absolutely delicious and had a nice texture. I'll definitely make it again!

6.4.13 ...https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8051/four-egg-yellow-cake/ ...  A good sponge cake.A very good sponge cake.I will use this recipe for sponge cake!  :D  I used 1 stick smart balance omega3 & 1/2c shortening,reduced sugar to 1 3/4c, & subbed 1/2t of the vanilla for almond extract.Although no one mentioned it that I read,it looked like too much batter for a 9x13 so I went a little bigger with a 9.5 x 13.5.'Done in 40-45 min.One of those cakes with the browned (but flattened) bubbles on top & a somewhat glossy rectangle in the middle.That's typical of sponge cakes.I gave it a good whipping :D,maybe 2 minutes,before panning it.Guess a knife through was in order to help the bubble situation but it's not a big deal anyway.A  9x13 may have worked,but it'd be a full,full baby.When it cools,it shrinks considerably.Not too low,but as long as it doesn't overflow while baking in a 9x13,it'd be okay.  :)  'Glad I tried this,but am still looking for the perfect yellow cake.K said I should make it again.What do you know?An unsolicited indirect compliment.  :o  ;D Topped with "Panda Frosting" which is my version of "best white icing ever".Yummy.THREE days later:Still moist & K wants it for her birthday cake with Panda frosting!Yay!Baking note:The cake tastes fine with Smart Balance,but it does have a division in the batter.You don't taste it,but see it It's happened before with another cake using it.  Guess leave Smart balance for cookies.6/13 Yummy,but too flat for cupcakes.

I needed 2 yellow cakes.  Used this recipe and "David's yellow cake".  Hands down this is the best cake and so easy to make.  I used butternut flavoring also.  YUMMY!

I love this recipe!  I bake and sell cakes and use this as my basic butter/yellow cake recipe.  It never fails.  I sometimes use a 1/2 cup of butter and a 1/2 cup of shortening if I want that buttery flavor.  I also add a little butter and almond flavoring to give it that extra zing.  This ones a keeper!

i made this recipe a couple of weeks ago for my sons bday party, and it's delightful!  i made one tiny change, i used all butter instead of shortening just personal preference and made it into cupcakes.  dense but fluffly and moist they were, with a very nice vanilla flavour.  and kicked the pants off a airy nothing box mix.  i'm not a vanilla cake/cupcake person, but this is a winner and will be my go to for vanilla cake!  thanks for a yummy recipe, delish!!

It tasted pretty good, and was fairly simple to make, but I was a little disappointed that is was dryer than I had hoped. Even my husband made a comment about it being a little dry. Will keep searching. Thanks anyway!

This recipe is fabulous. Utterly wonderful. I used all butter, (rather than all shortening) but I think half butter, half shortening would be wonderful. For kicks and giggles, I added a box of vanilla pudding to the wet ingredients. The resulting cake was incredibly moist, with a small, tender crumb (similar to a mix, but with the flavor of homemade). Will be most certainly making this again. And again. And again.

Butter, not shortening.  Make sure all the alternating ingredients are mixed before adding the other.

YUM!  My first yellow cake from scratch, if that matters to anyone.  This cake was moist and SO tasty, my bf even liked it and trust me, he's not into sweets, normally I end up throwing out a lot of leftover cake and pie.  I ate it with fresh strawberry puree, it was excellent, I will make this cake again, and probably again!

Taste is pretty good. Used it for a fancy cake, so it held up well to cutting and moving around to make a dragon.

This was not my favorite cake recipe...I thought the texture was wonderful - light and fluffy.  I gave the low rating because of the taste.  The cake was fairly bland.  In fact, I thought it tasted most like flour.  I will look for a new recipe the next time I want a yellow cake.

I made this cake for my sons first birthday yesterday, and it was fabulous...... 
I did however only add 1 and a half cups of sugar, just because I don't really like sweet cakes too much. But it worked out perfect, it was moist and fluffy. I made my own cream cheese frosting with fresh strawberries. and today there is barely any left, it really went down a treat. Thank you carolyn I was looking for a good yellow cake.
Also I think it's pretty bad when a person who is used to only making a cake from a box, give such a low rating because they don't know how to bake from scratch. I don't concider myself to be the best by far, and it turned out perfect for me.

This is a great starter recipe when you want to add your own ingredients. I made a Banana Praline layer cake by substituting 1/2 cup butter for 1/2 cup shortening, 1 cup brown sugar for 1 cup white, one and half smashed over ripe bananas for 1 egg, and I added cinnamon and nutmeg to taste . I also lined the bottom of each pan with half cup of brown sugar and walnuts and sliced bananas.

With mostly positive reviews I thought I'd give it a try.  I didn't understand the "corn bread" reference in several reviews.  NOW I do.  

I am a intermediate baker and assumed "mine would be fine." The cake is VERY moist, but the odd flavor makes it a NO for us.

Depending on what you are looking for this is a very vanilla flavored dense texture cake.  Good flavor.
I only have one piece left--if I hadn't said I'd save it for my husband I'd eat it myself!!

I tried this recipe on a lazy Saturday and loved it!!!  ((Purposely left 3 exclamation marks)))  I did add one more egg (just because it seemed right at the time) and instead of plain vanilla extract, I used a vanilla/nut/butter extract.  Of course, these changes could've contributed to its pound cake-like texture, but for me, it was a great addition.  Also, with 2 cups of sugar, it wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be; yet, I preferred it without frosting.  This cake was good enough to stand on its own.  I WILL NOT buy packaged yellow mix again.  I'm sure that not everyone will have a perfect cake every time (as personal tastes, locales, and altitudes may vary), but this recipe is versatile enough to 'tweek' as needed.  Thanks Carolyn!

It had a hard shell and the inside was dry and crumbly.  It tasted more like corn bread than cake.  It was edible at least it tasted okay.

I use this cake as the base of my tres leches cake and it's fabulous. I'm sure it's great as is, but I've been using it as my yellow cake starter. I would highly recommend it!

Yum! Very moist, a bit heavy but delicious!  I did end up using 1/2c shortening and 1/2c butter but that's the only change I made to this recipe - I'll make this again!

I made this cake with a little twist. I always add pudding to my cakes for added moisture even boxed cakes. it was super moist and using butter instead of shortening made it a rich and delicious cake. i will use this easy recipe  from now on :) no more boxes mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

This cake turns out moist, delicious, and not-too-dense. A bit more eggy tasting than other yellow cake recipes I've used, but very good. I used the Chocolate Butter-Creme Frosting from this website with this recipe for my husband's birthday cake; he loved it.

Oh my goodness this cake is wonderful.  I just found this recipe an hour ago and made it immediately.  I have been looking for a good yellow cake recipe for years.  I divided the recipe and made a quarter of the recipe just as a test.  I substituted the shortening for butter.  I also used Penzey's Mexican vanilla.  I will definitely have to make this one again.  Thanks for posting this one.

This cake turned out great! I substituted butter for the shortening and used cake flour instead of all-purpose. I sifted the flour and creamed the butter and sugar for six minutes, until it was very light. THe batter turned out very pale yellow and frothy and the cake baked up beautifully for my husband's birthday. I will definitely be using this one again.

It was very moist and delicious. My friends raved about it! I cooked it for about 40 mins instead of 45 and next time I think I will check it at 35 mins.

i baked this cake tonight, following other reviews advice to beat the eggs and sugar well and to mix well after each egg. i used all butter as well. i think reading the negative reviews threw me off because i was looking for it to have a corn bread quality. so i tested on my very critical husband and he was very pleased with it. i enjoyed my slice as well. i feel it could use SOMETHING, maybe more vanilla. but a great recipe that i will use again!

I made this yesterday as a two-layer birthday cake, and it was delicious! Very dense and moist. I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening though.

I use this recipe for all of my 'yellow caked' based recipes like Lemon or almond cake. I always use 12/ canola oil and 1/2 butter and for the texture I like I, whip two of the 4 egg 'whites' to soft peaks and fold them in at the end

I am just beginning "scratch" instead of box.  This was fantastic.  I used 3/4 cup buttermilk & 1 cup milk and all unsalted butter instead of shortening.  Came out light, fluffy & tastey!  Used basic chocolate icing.  Now if it passes the "test" tomorrow at work! I mixed eggs & milk in a blender to keep from beating them too much to get them mixed in the batter.  This may have helped alevite the cornbread texture.

This is a great recipe for yellow cake.  I've made it several times, following the directions exactly and subbing out half the shortening for butter and it is great either way!

Oh my gosh! This cake was sooooooooo good... My friend and I used this recipe to make a theme cake for a co-worker's birthday and the parts that we had to trim off to get the cake shape we wanted were instantly devoured. I substituted butter for the shortening and got such a moist, spongy cake... Everyone at work and home said it was probably the best yellow cake they've ever had! It was great with cream cheese icing.

This cake is delicious! I used all butter instead of shortening after reading some reviews. I will try this again using the shortening and maybe 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening, just to see how it turns out. This is my yellow cake from now on. Everyone loved this, the flavor and texture is great! Thanks (:

Excellent, very moist.  I think the person who gave this recipe bad ratings should give it one more shot.  I used butter instead of shortning also.  And used banana,vanilla and almond flavorings.  Scrumptious!

This was my first time making yellow cake, and it turned out great. I made cupcakes (this recipe yielded 30) and baked them for 19 minutes. They are very moist and the flavor is great. I did use butter instead of shortening, and sifted the flour, as other users had suggested. I also made sure to cream the butter and sugar very thoroughly, until it was nice and fluffy (which is what you should do with any cake, anyway). An excellent and simple recipe!

This is an amazing cake recipe!  I double sifted the dry ingredients, which resulted in a very light, fluffy cake.  I substituted soy milk for the cows milk because my daughter is allergic - this worked perfectly for us!  The recipe yielded 30 cupcakes.  Change bake time to 20 minutes for cupcakes.

Perfect. You just have to take your time with creaming the sugar and shortening, or in my case, butter. Also, add each egg individually. It was moist and delicious. My kids and I ate a ton of it plain!

I did as others recommended and used half butter, half shortening. I cannot imagine how this would be with all shortening. The cupcakes are greasy, crispy on top, and rubbery from the shortening. I will try again with all butter. I will also do as others recommended and cream the butter and sugar together until smooth. Then add the eggs one at a time. I added the eggs and sugar together like the recipe stated, and the batter looked grainy.

Really, an excellent cake, tender, moist, great flavor. I used butter flavored shortening, self-rising flour, and a mixture of skim milk and whipping cream.  I definitely will be making it often!  Thanks a lot Carolyn!

Searching for yet another cake recipe and hoping it would taste better than all the other ones I've tried I stumbled across this one and read all the reviews.

I'm glad I found this one because it definitely had a great flavor and texture.  

I did take other people's advice by using butter instead of shortening.

Let me tell you, these were the best cupcakes ever and I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks for posting it!!

Yummy! I made this as cupcakes for a party my family was hosting. Very moist and fluffy, one of the best yellow cakes I've made so far. The cupcakes didn't rise very well, but the shape wasn't an issue once I frosted them. A keeper, thanks!

Nice cake, turned out light and fluffy. A little delicate. Mild flavor, you could use any flavor icing or fruit and it would go with this. Pale in color, not really yellow at all. This made 1 9x13 cake, and it filled the pan. It would have made two thick cake layers easily. My son described the texture on this as like cornbread especially the edge pieces and I have to say I do see what he meant by his statement. Thanks, this was decent.

I bake professionally and wanted a new recipe for a yellow cake and found this recipe.  A DEFINITE KEEPER.  Used it for a children's birthday party cake last weekend and it was a hit.  Several folks asked for the recipe.  The only change I made was to use half shortening and half butter.  The taste was wonderful.  The texture excellent.  I've found my new favorite for yellow cakes.

Excellent cake for sculpting.  Careful not to overcook or it gets dry edges.  Tastes a bit like french toast (eggy?), but I haven't compared it to anything else besides box mix (which it is better than).

I found this recipe after I had accidentally overcooked one of those Pillsbury boxed cakes (that's what happens when walk away from your timer..lol).  I changed the shortening to butter, as have some of the other reviewers, but hadn't read any of the reviews prior to making this.  All I can say is, I'm glad the store boxed cake got ruined, cuz this one is much fluffier and lighter and sweeter.

Like all things in life-- you get out what you put in.  A good cake has the proper ingredients with the proper proportions; this has both.

Technique has something to do with it as well, however, and anyone having problems with this cake should try using only butter (as I did), and sifting the dry ingredients together, and then sifting them into the *thoroughly* creamed butter/sugar mixture with patience.  The cake comes out wonderfully moist and delicious.  No reason I'm not going to keep this recipe as a cake base for future baking.

I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews but gave the recipe a chance anyway and it turned out wonderful! I halved it to make one smaller pan, used half shortening/half butter, and added 1 1/2 t. of cinnamon to the flour mixture since I was feeling lazy and didnt want to make a frosting! It was a very fluffy cake with good texture, Im wondering if others who are having issues with density are creaming the butter/sugar mixture long enough and aerating the flour before measuring? Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and the result was very easy and very good, I  baked the half batch about 35 minutes which was just right. This will definitely become a staple in my recipe box, thank you!

This is an excellent recipe. The key is good baking powder and soda, beating all ingredients well. Take your time and it will be great. I made 30 cupcakes, 350 20 or so minutes.

After reading the great reviews I decided to make this to accompany a nice pot of chili for dinner. Imagine my disappointment when it came out of the oven tasting not like cornbread, as so many reviewers claimed, but like a delicious yellow cake!

This cake was OK, but I was a bit disappointed and not impressed at all. I was looking for something fluffier and lighter. This one was way too dense.

I was not impressed with this cake. I was excited after reading all the good reviews, thinking this would be an awsome cake, but it definetly was not in my opinion. It was spounge like, not as moist as I would have liked either. I'm sticking with the Moist Yellow Cake recipe on here!

This cake is delicious. This is an awesome cake. I made it just like it said and frosted it with a chocolate fudge frosting. Delicious! I tasted some of the cake without the frosting and that was delicious also. I probably didn't even have to use the frosting. I give it a 5 because that is what it deserves!!!

I thought the cake was simply ok. It was extremely dense and reminded me more of corn muffins than a sweet dessert. Although I appreciate a good sturdy cake, this was a little too much so. I baked a small cake and a fe cupcakes and I would recommend the recipe for those rather than a cake.

This cake was exactly what I was looking for.  I made this cake at the  last minute (More people showed up at youngest son's birthday party than was expected!) and I had everything in the pantry to make it!  It was so good with the fudge frosting that I also found from this site.  I did sub 1/2 cup of butter for the shortening, but other than that I kept it the same.  I will be making again for oldest son's birthday next month.

I'm sorry to say, but this cake was really not what i expected. When it came out of the oven it looked very promising, but after cooling down it became a very heavy dense cake, not what i was looking for. I frosted it with white frosting, and it tasted delicious, but way way way to heavy.

This basic yellow cake is truly a winner. It was especially easy to make, and came out very moist with a light texture and delicious flavor. I have been looking for a good yellow cake recipe, as I never use box mixes. The only change I made was to add about 1 tsp. of pure almond extract. My son just came home from college, drove 10 hours to get here, and was rewarded with  a homemade cake fresh out of the oven. I iced it with the Decadent Chocolate Cake icing from Silver Palate, and it was perfect! Thanks Carolyn..well done.

After reading all the reviews I tried this recipe with only 2 changes. I used butter flavor Crisco and I baked two 9 inch layers instead of one 9x13 pan. Unfortunately my results weren't very good- the layers sank in the middle, were too dense and didn't have much flavor. What went wrong? In comparison to other yellow cake recipes this one seems to have too much milk for the amount of fat & flour. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

I made this cake for my best friend's birthday party.  I made it into 2 8 inch rounds and layered it with a simple chocolate cake.  It was great. I put chocolate fudge frosting between all four layers and covered the entire cake with white chocolate almond frosting.  Everyone loved it and days later, I am still getting rave reviews.  A keeper!!!

This is the best yellow cake ever!!  I have even used and abused this recipe and it always turns out great!!  I use butter flavor shortening regularly and if I am out of white sugar I use brown, I tend to use whatever flavoring is at the front of the shelf!!  The recipe doesn't really specify how long to beat it and I have done it for everywhere from one minute to 10(I had to answer the door!)  It is an excellent cake!

First of all this cake didn't have much flavor, even after adding and extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and using 1 cup vanilla pudding in place of 1 cup of milk it was still pretty bland. It was moist enough I guess, but nothing great. I might use this again if I change a bit more of the recipe.

I have made this recipe quite a few times and it is always a big hit.  I am no longer looking for a yellow cake recipe :)  What I usually do with this recipe since I didn't have a round cake pan was make it into cupcakes.  It made about 36 cupcakes all together if I make the whole recipe.  It was so easy and simple to make and it is so delicious.  I have colored the batter once with food coloring (pink).  I finally got a round cake pan and am thinking about making this cake for mother's day this weekend.  I usually use a buttercream frosting on it...delicious!!  No more store cakes :) Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I made this several times when recipe called for a cake mix.  This worked great in place of cake mix.  The only thing I did different was substitute butter for the shortening.  I would use again.

This was my first time making this cake. I used 1 cup of butter instead of shortening. Since I read the reviews saying that butter will make it dry, I added 4 tablespoons of mayo (you can't taste it in the cake at all) for added moisture. It helped bring a lot of moisture without taking away texture, and the taste was wholesome and decadent. I also used the sour cream chocolate frosting recipe (on this site as well) and the combination was amazing. I will make this again!

Iâ€™ve made this twice now. The first time with all butter and it was awesome. I made cupcakes this last time with half shortening and half butter and I was heavy and gummy. The flavor is still amazing but Iâ€™ll use the butter from now on. I filled the cupcakes with apple pie filling and made a cinnamon brown sugar butter cream. YUM!

Just made this for my boyfriend's birthday, and this will be my go to cake recipe from here on out. I only used to make box cake and recently tried Davi'd cake recipe on here that has tons of great reviews. It was so dry and crumbly, so I decided to try this  one. I followed the recipe to a t, except I added a little more milk. It is sooo moist. Not sure how others ended up with a dry cake.

This is a wonderful cake recipe! My family loves it. Used 1/2 cup of butter in place of some of the shortening because I only had half of the shortening called for. This is a keeper! Will be making this one over and over again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made it several times, it's moist, slightly dense (like any good yellow cake) and gets the perfect sticky top. 
I usually don't even bother to frost, if I do it's a thin! layer of chocolate frosting.
Tastes absolutely delicious with mini chocolate chips sprinkled in (especially as cupcakes with or without thin chocolate frosting on top)
**Small fyi, while the flavor is not too far changed, definitely recommend the shortening over butter for a nice golden color, butter left mine looking quite pale)

I wanted to make a quick dessert for my family. It actually took me about 35 minutes to find the right recipe. This cake was perfect. I made a small change (instead of 1 cup of shortening I only a used 1/2 cup an added 1/2 cup softened butter). This cake was moist an delicious my family loved it.  I didn't use any frosting I just dusted it with icing sugar. A wonderful recipe.

I have been looking for a yellow cake recipe for years and this one is awesome!!  It's light, fluffy and has the perfect amount of sweetness. I love the fact that I can use all purpose flour which is a huge savings when you bake a lot. I used 1/2c butter and 1/2c shortening instead of 1c of shortening......because I love butter! The batter is enough for a 3-layer 8 inch cake or 36 cupcakes.

I made this for my daughters 2nd birthday. The whole family loved it. It was moist light and fluffy and just sweet enough. I read the bad reviews and have no idea what was done to botch up the recipe but I followed the recipe exactly with one small addition w was vanilla extract and it came out AMAZING! 5 stars from me and I will definitely make this again. P.S. I am not an experience baker and this was SUPER easy for me thanks for the recipe.

This is my go-to cake recipe. It is quick and easy as far as cakes go and always turns out great. The only change I make is to substitute 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening.  Definitely a family favorite.

Wonderful, tender cake.   I used 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter, and changed no other ingredients.  Reduced oven temp to 325, and baked 9" layers for about 38 minutes.   Had none of the negative issues described by other reviewers.  I've been looking for a great yellow cake recipe for years, and I think I've finally found it.  Thank you, Carolyn.

Made this for my girlfriend on her birthday because it's her favorite kind of cake! She loved it and said it was very moist. I stuck to the recipe except I added two extra yolks to the original four eggs. Will make again!

I got a request for a golden butter cake with chocolate frosting, using the famous brand cake mix. I no longer buy cake mixes for several reasons and settled on this recipe to try out. I made exactly as written and it was superb. I actually prefer the taste without the chocolate frosting, as I believe the cake stands on its own and is overpowered by chocolate. Wonderfully moist, magnificent crumb texture, a perfect cake. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious cake recipe when you're out of butter and need to make cake.  For those that said it tastes like cornbread I don't know what kind of cornbread they've been eating.  It tasted like cake to me.  It's moist but not as flavorful as a butter cake.

I ended up using cake flour (I ran out of AP. I swear that other bag of SR was AP when I bought it!), and this turned out lovely. The taste is perfect with the suggestion of butter, though it is also pretty good with the shortening in the recipe. It's not gooey moist by any means, but it's cakey and amazing. Will make over and over.

Absolutely perfect recipe! Made for our dinner this evening and was totally surprised at how delicate and tasty it was. I have read some of the reviews saying it did not rise right or was too sweet or what ever. I truly believe these people either did not get the right ingredients or failed to beat it properly or perhaps even had to small of eggs. I used Grade A large eggs and it was perfect. My son was delighted. I added a thin layer of chocolate butter cream icing and we needed nothing else. I highly recommend this as a wonderful desert.

AWESOME! Do I give it 4 or 5 stars (I made two substitutions)? I read reviews and a couple other yellow cake recipes, so I used have butter and half shortening. I also added 2 extra egg yolks. i made a small 2 layer cake for an upcoming fair entry and used the extra batter for cupcakes. I just "tested' a cupcake and the cake even without frosting is wonderful. It has a delicate sweetness to the cake and a very fine and moist crumb. It may have been just as good without the modifications. I will have to test that later. I am excited to use this a a fair entry. Now I just have to leave the cupcakes alone per doctor's orders.

My family loved this cake. I made it for Fathers Day. I used butter and used 2 extra egg yolks. It was very moist, light, and fluffy. The taste and texture were spot on. I iced it with a homemade chocolate buttercream and decorated with candies. It was a huge hit. This will forever be my "go to" recipe for yellow cake.

This is a very moist yellow cake recipe that can be used as a base for many others. I used the recipe and substituted Mango juice for the milk and it turned out great. Made a Mango juice icing to pour over hot out of the oven.

Great simple recipe. I made this cake for a going away party and got several requests to make it again for upcoming birthdays. 

The only change I made was to use butter instead of shortening. I made sure to cream the butter and sugar VERY well, as others have suggested and it came out the perfect texture. This made three 8" rounds.

I have been using this recipe for several years and love it. If you cream the shortening and sugar together thoroughly it will not have any resemblance to cornbread. It is light, fluffy and moist. After many times, making this, I have found a few modifications that I think makes it even better--I use cake flour for a softer texture and substitute 1/2 cup better for 1/2 the shortening. Enjoy.

Exactly what I was looking for!!! I was looking for a pourable batter to make a Zebra cake,  My mix method was the same as the video. I Followed all the ingredients listed - plus 2 egg yolks for added moisture. My cake baked up beautifully, however it shrunk considerably when it cooled. But the end result was a perfectly flavored, perfect crumb and very moist cake!!

Fantastic cake recipe!! It was the first cake I've made from scratch, and it turned out so deliciously moist and rich, even though I used butter instead of shortening. I read the reviews first and followed the suggestions to have the ingredients at room temp, mix the sugar and softened butter well, add the eggs one at a time, and not overmix the batter after the flour has been added. My family loves it, including my toddler whose birthday I made it for!

This cake was simply fantastic! Of course I tweaked it I mixed the shortening with butter and the cake simply melted in your mouth. I also made the cake a Lemon cake by adding lemon flavoring in addition to the vanilla and also adding some lemon juice. I used lemon curd filling in between the layers and made a lemon cream cheese frosting. Turned out excellent. This recipe never fails. I don't understand how it could get a bad review or how you could have a dry cornbread cake when it calls for a cup of shortening.. Lol

OK...I can see where people think this tastes like cornbread ~ because it does...it has the same flavor as a sweet cornbread, without cornmeal. It's still yummy (I like cornbread:-))and I think it will still be good, once I get the frosting on. I followed the directions - and I am a rather experienced baker, so I had everything room temp and beat the shortening/sugar/egg until light and fluffy! It's all about each person's individual taste!!

I made this cake this evening.  I used two 3"x 8" round pans.  I think three 2" x 8" pans would work well with this cake.   If the recipe was any larger it would have been too much for those two pans.  For some reason I had never tried to make a yellow cake from scratch before.  This is just too easy to make to ever buy another box yellow cake mix again!  It is moist and tender, and it smells heavenly and my nose is a good indicator for how something will taste!  (Haven't cut it yet.  Going to serve it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.)  Didn't change a thing in the recipe.

Very good.  Instead of shortening, I used one half butter, one half vegetable oil and unbleached sugar and it turned out very nice! Great color.

Because of my wife's food allergies we substatute equal parts butter for the vegtable shortening. Let the butter stand until it gets about half way to room temp. Then cream with the sugar per the recipe. If the butter is to soft before creaming the cake will not rise as much.

Otherwise everything the same as the recipe. Great cake. Our family's favorite!

This is an excellent recipe. I followed it exactly. I creamed the shortening and sugar for about 5 min. The crumb and texture were really nice. I did find it a little sweet, so I may reduce the sugar by about 1/2 cup next time. I used this recipe to make a 3D doll cake, and it worked beautifully. Thanks for posting.

This recipe is what my Oma made every grandchild for a birthday each year and called it "1-2-3-4 Cake" She always topped it with a simple cream cheese icing and piped Happy Birthday on it. I only have a very old scrap of paper handwritten by her (which I treasure) with her basic ingredients and few instructions but I am so happy to have found the details of this wonderful cake and so many tips for making it.  It is exactly what I remember eating so many times growing up and is a perfect cake recipe for birthdays.  The only difference in ingredients is that she used 3 cups of flour vs. 2.75, hence 1-2-3-4 title for the amounts of the 4 main ingredients, shortening, sugar, flour, eggs.  Thank you for posting and for all the very helpful instructions.

This was a perfect yellow cake. Not too dense, not too sweet. I used half vegetable oil and half butter only because shortening is not available where I live. Other than that I stuck to the recipe. It did sink a little upon cooling, but made a perfect surface for decorating. Was sturdy enough to slice into 3 small layers and fill.

This is a very easy and delicious recipe.  I followed the directions exactly when I made cupcakes but adjusted the baking time.  30 cupcakes [2/3 filled] took 25 minutes.  Since this isn't my first rodeo I knew to check often to see if they were done since I hadn't made this recipe before. You do need to let them stay in a bit so they will turn golden on the top.  I suspect the cake may take a little less time, but again check often.
 
The cake is more dense than a box cake, but still very, very moist with a nice crumb.  Also the cupcakes don't crown like a box mix, but they still look great and taste wonderful. 
 
I filled mine with homemade strawberry jelly [picture 33] and topped them with the peanut butter frosting recipe found on this site.  They were a big hit at my daughter's school banquet.  They are also delicious plain. We ate 1/2 dozen before I could ice them.  Quality control you understand. heehee
 
Enjoy!

This recipe is simple as pie even though it makes a cake when followed well. Substituted all butter for the  shortening for best taste and texture.  

Not to sound mean but it seems from the problems a lot of people had with this cake, they either didn't follow or understand the the directions or made unfortunate choices in substituting ingredients. Another common problem is that many home ovens often are poorly calibrated. Don't think that just because you set your dial on 350, that's the temperature you're going to get. Use a good quality oven thermometer to make sure.

This is a good simple recipe. I give it four stars instead of five because it could be written a little more clearly. I've been a professional cook for over 25 years.

I've made this several times as written, and it has turned out well every time. Sometimes I will also use half butter for the shortening, and sometimes I add butter flavoring. I am confused by the people who say it tastes like cornbread. Maybe the problem is the cornbread you're eating tastes like cake. The result I get from this recipe is nothing like cornbread. And if the recipe has failed for you, perhaps it's your mixing equipment or technique. Following the recipe has never failed me.

This is a delicious yellow cake!!! We absolutely loved this recipe. I had been looking through many recipes & trying them, but did not like the flavor of the cake because they tasted to much like the vanilla. This one taste really good. The only change I will make is adding pudding to the recipe as other people have posted, to make it a little more moist. I made this recipe & filled it with a homemade raspberry white chocolate chip cream cheese filling & crumb coated with homemade buttercream & covered in a homemade fondant. It was so good & the cake held up under the fondant very well!!! Thank you Carolyn for such a delicious recipe!!!

I'm so confused by this cake. I'm not an inexperienced baker, I read a ton of reviews so I knew what "tricks" to do to make it better and I still don't understand what happened.  I used half butter, half shortening. I beat the heck out of it. I added one egg at a time and beat it after each egg. I alternated the flour and milk beginning and ending with flour. The batter was beautiful, creamy and whipped perfectly. I thought any negative reviews were of those that just didn't know how to make a cake from scratch. I baked it, it crowned although people said it wouldn't. But THEN, it cooled. It fell flat (which is fine, easier for decorating), but it tasted like cornbread! I couldn't understand why people were saying that. It wasn't the consistency of corn bread, but the flavor was that. After multiple times tasting it, I came to the conclusion that I think it's the shortening that gives it that flavor. If you can get past that then you taste the vanilla and it tastes pretty good. It also didn't have a very buttery taste, which I wanted so I think to solve this problem next time I'l try all butter and hopefully get rid of the cornbread flavor.  I think it's at least worth the try, but if it doesn't work better next time I won't be making it again. Good luck!

I made this into cupcakes and they turned out great! I did subsitute all butter for the shortening.  Cook the cupcakes for about 17 min. This is better than ANY box cake and just as easy.  The cupcakes were moist and delicious.

This cake was pretty good. It was much heavier than I would have liked but was moist. I made it for my mothers birthday and she kept saying it reminded her of her aunts pound cake (a good thing). I did use butter in place of shortening. Next time I will make sure it is warmer but not melted (Mine was room temp but my house is cold) and I will make sure my eggs and milk is room temp. I also may cut the sugar by 1/4 cup as it seemed a bit too sweet for me.

Disappointing, and very cornbread-esque, as another reviewer noted. Even loaded with frosting, this is basically inedible.

I used the suggestion with 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and it turned out awesome. I also mixed the whole thing for alot longer than suggested and wow was it a moist sweet cake..  Thanks for all the ideas.

After reading the reviews about "cornbread texture" I decided to use half shortening/half butter and shorten the baking time. It was perfect. I used two 9in round pans and only baked it for 35 mins and rotated the pans 15mins into the baking. I probably could've gone a few mins less and been okay. I lined the bottom of the pans with wax paper for easy release. I made this for a birthday cake for my two friends and they both loved it along with my other guests.

I tried this cake for my boyfriend's birthday.  I used butter instead of shortening cause it was all I had, and I used cake flour cause oddly that's what I had instead of AP flour.  It turned out a bit dense for my liking, more than made enough for two cake rounds, but it was sorta heavy.  The flavoring was wonderful, though, really good!  My boyfriend was very impressed.  The sugars in it caramelized on the outside so I'm trying to think of how to fix that.  Over all?  Pretty darn good cake.  Oh and the parchment paper in the bottom of the pan?  Worked BEAUTIFULLY for helping get the cake out.

I did what many suggested and swapped butter for shortening.  I have never rated a recipe here, but wanted to boost the rating on this one.  It is a more dense cake.  Everyone LOVED the flavor.  It came out perfectly.  It is a keeper and I cannot wait to make it again.  I frosted it with chocolate, but with the richness of the cake...next time I will do a whipped white icing.

Loved this recipe! A definite keeper!  I used a combo of butter flavored Crisco, Smart Balance Spread and margarine, since that was all I had on hand.  I also used pastry flour and it turned out to be a very light and airy cake.  I would highly suggest using parchment paper for the bottom of your pan/s.  I didn't and it was difficult to remove.  It was a hit at my house!

I made this recipe a few days ago. My husband and kids loved the cake. The called it Mom's poundcake. I make one change to the recipe, I used Bisquik instead of flour and reduced the sugar by 3 tablespoons. I will probably make this again in the future.

First off: I subbed butter for shortening because it was what I had on hand.

The best part of this recipe is that it's quick, easy, and requires no odd ingredients. I was scrambling last minute to get a cake recipe and this was the first one I found that had stuff I always keep on hand anyways.

The cake wasn't necessarily dry, but I can see how it would be probably better with the extra moistness that shortening provides.

The flavor is just fine, lends itself well to frosting. The cake actually came out a slight dense sponge consistency, and seems like it would be really great for a layered cake. 

I will definitely keep this recipe on hand. Easy, quick, came out just fine.

Sorry I followed this to a T and I am a good cook and excellent baker and this cake tasted like cornbread. I made it for my husband's birthday since he wanted a yellow cake and I heard my brother-in-laws saying this while I was in the other room and I had to agree with them. The cake was moist at least and tasty just wasn't looking for a cornbread taste in a yellow cake. Won't make this again.

Just as good as store bought!  I used 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup shortening.  It was very moist...don't know if that change contributed or not.  This will now be my go-to recipe for a yellow cake.

This was much like a Pound Cake in its batter form. Once cooked it tasted like a lightly sweetened cornbread (which worried me). My daughter was taking them for cupcakes for her class so I was worried about them. This morning after tasting them however, they were sweeter with a more cake like consistency.  For best results make it the day before you plan on eating it.  I followed the directions and ingredients not changing a thing. In the future I think I will use more vanilla, maybe even vanilla and almond extract together. Good basic recipe, I'll use it again.

I'm struggling with the review on this a little.  I thought the taste was good but mine turned out rather dense.  I will give this a try again because I think it's possible I did something to cause the problem  I am giving the recipe the benefit of the doubt and saying it's a 4 star.

I followed the exact instructions, and I was a bit nervous because I live at high altitude but it turned out perfectly! In fact I dare to say the BEST yellow cake I have tried or tasted!  Super moist! Make sure you cream the sugar and shortening/butter really well! Thanks for sharing this recipe, as I type my children are asking for more!

Excellent!  I'm a decent cook but no baker.  I used half butter, half shortening.  Just made this for my son's 10th birthday, and built Lego bricks out of it.  It was perfectly sweet, dense, held up to cutting into shape, just exactly what I wanted it to be!!  Take everyone's advice and cream that butter for longer than you think!

I don't understand why this recipe only has 4 stars.  It is a good dense cake.  I made the recipe as directed and it turned out great.  I baked 2 round 9" cakes and 10 cupcakes with the extra batter.  Then I carved the cake into the shape of "Hello Kitty", it turned out great!  My friend loved it!  Its the perfect texture for carving, it held up well.

I just had my first piece of this cake, and I loved it. I did make a few changes. I used all butter, no shortening. I also separated the eggs. I added the yolks when the recipe said to, one at a time. I beat the whites into a nice foam and folded them in right before pouring into the pan. Very light and fluffy. Will definitely make again.

the taste was nice, but it was dense and dry. I used half shortening and half butter however. Maybe I will try this recipe again with an extra egg and all shortening, and try to find butter flavored shortening.

I have hunted for a good scratch yellow cake for years and this one is great!!!  I do add a pkg. of vanilla pudding and reduce the sugar to 1 3/4 c.  I also whip the batter for one minute after each egg and then for a few minutes after all eggs are in.  It definitely makes a difference so you don't turn out with a heavy batter but instead with a light and fluffy batter - bakes up awesome and tastes great... thank you!

I'm only give this recipe one star, because the system required me to pick 1-5 stars.  I am a wonderful cook/baker and I've never had a dish turn out like this cake.  I followed the directions and even took a few review suggestions...using sifted cake flour and butter instead of shortening, and this cake was literally solid on the inside, I could barely get the birthday candles in the cake.  It was so solid that when I took the cake out of the pan I could hold it with one hand and it didn't break.   I WILL NEVER MAKE THIS CAKE AGAIN!

Have been looking for a home made yellow cake that didn't require cake flour.  This recipe is delicious.  I was  hesitant to use 4 eggs since I buy large ones, but I did put the 4 in and feel that contributed to its success.  The only change I made was to take another reviewer's suggestion to use only 2 1/2 tsps. baking powder, because 3 seemed too much.  I also sifted the flour twice.  I had prepared a tube pan, but on pouring the batter in, saw I was going to have way too much, so hurridly greased and floured the 9x13 dish recommended.  Only problem I had was in releasing the cake from dish after it was baked  Always slip a piece of wax paper on the bottom, but prepared this so at the last moment. that I skipped that step.  Letting it cool 20 minutes, then cutting it in half, and using spatulas to slide under, I was able to lift each half out onto a rack to finish cooling.  Thanks for sharing this recipe that is reminiscent of my mother's cakes when I was a kid.
Adding a picture taken of cake made as a birthday cake with raspberry flavoring in the frosting and a layer of raspberry jam on top of middle layer of frosting - it was delicious.

Nice recipe for sure. I substituted butter for the shortening. It was light and fluffy and wasn't dry, I made a three layer cake. Frosted with the hersheys chocolate frosting recipe and decorated with  fall colored m&m's around the edges! Just a tip, make sure to sift dry ingredients and really mix the butter And sugar good. Cheers!

This is a great recipe for a yellow cake from scratch.  It's definitely going in my recipe box and I will use this from now on!  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening instead of all shortening.  I also used only 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and added 3/4 teaspoon of almond extract.  Creaming the butter mixture and sugar and adding the eggs one at a time really made the batter fluffy.  Of course, when alternating dry ingredients and liquids, it's best to start and end with the dry ingredients.  I used this recipe when I baked a birthday cake and got compliments from the guests--one even runs a bakery and she was impressed!  This recipe looks like it will be a winner for the wedding cake I will be making for my son in two months!

Baked this for my dad for Father's Day and it was a big hit at our house. Next time I think I will try using half butter and half shortening, as I felt the cake was missing that buttery taste.

I followed the recipe exactly with the only modification I made was replacing the shortening with 1/2 shortening 1/2 butter. I was very pleased with the consistency of the cake, very light and fluffy. Not corn bread like at all like some of the reviews said. Make sure to cream the butter, sugar and egg mixture really well. I am a relatively novice baker, but I was able to get this right. I made this into cupcakes which I clearly overfilled. If you are making cupcakes, fill only 1/2 way. My biggest problem was something that made me question remaking this recipe. Once the cupcakes were cooled, I realized that there was a sticky film on top of each cupcake. It was thick and gooey and caused each cupcake to have a sheen to it. It appeared very plastic-y. I was able to successful conceal it with icing, but I still found it gross that I was eating that. I assume that it was because of the shortening. If I remake this recipe again, I think I will try with all butter. It's a shame about the goo on the top of the cakes because this recipe is fabulous in every other way.

YES! This was the best cake. I did use butter - and this cake with chocolate frosting was gone fast. Perfect consistency if you like dense wedding-ish cake. I do!

This looked really weird going into the pan, kind of gloppy without a smooth texture but it turned out great!  Everyone raved about it and my friend who hates cake ate 2 pieces and said it was the best cake he ever had! It did have a heavier texture, similar to cornbread but the flavor was amazing, tasted homemade and more substantial than any cake I've ever had.   Definitely making again!

This was fantastic!  This was the first time I made a yellow cake from scratch and it was for my husband's birthday!  I was nervous it wouldn't turn out yummy so I made two different recipes.....this one was the best!!  I recommend this recipe to even the novice baker--that is what I am!  I did use cake flour instead of all purpose flour and sifted the flour, baking powder and salt together.  This was very light, fluffy and tasted spectacular!!  It was a hit with my whole family!  I used a chocolate frosting from here also, it is titled Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting and it was perfect with the cake.  The frosting is very rich so you only need a thin layer.  I will use this recipe over and over!

I really, really love this cake recipe, it turned out light and moist with a wonderful texture and flavor. I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter, creamed really well with the sugar until it was pale and fluffy. I have recently learned that the way you measure the flour is extremely important, I didn't realize I had been doing it wrong for years. The flour should be lightly spooned into the measuring cup and then leveled off. I learned from the King Arthur Flour website that if you scoop the flour out of the bag with the measuring cup, and then level it off it compacts the flour substantially. Too much flour in the recipe results in a dry, tasteless cake. I also sifted the flour before measuring. The only other change I made to the recipe was to add 1 teaspoon of butter flavoring in addition to the 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. This one is definitely a keeper in my book!

I'm shocked at the bad reviews too! This is only the 2nd cake I've made from scratch and it was perfect - light fluffy and moist! I topped it with an orange-flavored chocolate icing and my family loved it.

I really wanted to give this recipe 5 stars but its missing a little more flavor, just a little though. Other then that the texture on this cake is amazing, ive never made a cake from scratch thats tasted better than this. Its soo moist and fluffy, it can definitely withstand a lot of frosting and fondant. Will be using this recipe for many years!

AWWSOME! My first time trying to make my own yellow  cake and it was for my son's 3rd birthday. Taste great!  I doubled recipe and it was enough for a 9x9x4" square pan and a 8x8x3 square pan...so I had extra and I dared to make a 3D Hot Wheels cake.  Thanks for the recipe.  I followed recipe to a T.

First of all, I'm giving it 5 stars because it's made from scratch and anything NOT out of a box with Betty's name is good in my book. 2nd, I really like this recipe. I followed advice and mixed very well in between ingredient additions. I made cupcakes with this batter and they rose very well, then flattened on top. Maybe non-risers have stale baking powder? Note: The cupcakes were very difficult to remove from the papers, next time I'll grease and flour instead.

I love this recipe!! This is my birthday cake recipe now.  Make sure you cream the butter and sugar VERY well and don't over-beat the eggs.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I used butter instead of shortening.  Maybe it can only be good with shortening... I bake all the time and just wanted to play around with a new recipe.  I did not care for it at all.  Very chewy texture with butter.  That was my only substitution.

Great recipe, even with all purpose flour.  I upped the health factor by using a ground flax seed mix in place of the four eggs and then adding two egg yolks.  You just soak 4 tbls ground flax in 3/4 cups of warm water for 5 minutes and stir.  I also replaced 1 cup of white flour with whole wheat and it came out moist and fluffy anyway. Added colored sprinkles.  YUM

This cake turned out AWESOME!  I made it for my husband's Battle Buddy's birthday, and he LOVED it!  I frosted it with Fudge frosting, and it was delicious!  It does come out heavier and a little more dry than a box mix, but what cake from scratch doesn't?  This was awesome and a definite make again.  :)

Somebody help me! I just recently got into baking home-made cakes b/c I ate a pound cake someone made for me and LOVED it.  BUT, I've tried this recipt THREE TIMES now, have researched possible reasons 'why', and still mine is not moist (to my satisfaction, anyway).  I creamed (and creamed) shortening, sugar and butter, beat in eggs one at a time (even tried beating them individually first), tried cake and regular flour (alternately), everything at room temp, cook until cake tests done in center, etc. etc.  Does it just seem dry to me b/c I'm used to box mixes?  My pound cake is heavy (understandably) but far from dry.  Any advice?  I'm willing to try one more time for success, but then that's IT for home-made YELLOW cakes if I can't fix my problem.

This cake was not what I expected, to say the least. It did not rise at all and burned on the outside and did not cook on the inside. The inside was also very dense and thick. It was dry and tasted of corn bread without the corn. I don't recommend this to anyone.

Very moist and a great flavor. It doesnt have that corn bread flavor like a lot of other yellow cake recipes Ive tried. I adjusted some ingredients to work with the higher elevation I live in, and i added an extra egg yolk.  Delish!

I have made this cake several times now - all with wonderful success!  It turns out very light, moist and flavorful every time.  I always use all butter instead of shortening, and I always make sure to cream the batter until it is very light and fluffy.  A fantastic cake that friends constantly rave about!

This is my favorite yellow cake recipe! It's so moist because of the shortening and bakes to a tall beautiful cake! Very easy to ice as well. I highly recommend following directions to a T. It always comes out well for me!

Awesome recipe!! The only reason I gave it a four star rating is because I always use butter or Earth Balance instead of shortening. It's seriously delicious with half EB and half coconut oil, too! But this has definitely been my go-to recipe for yellow cake - few ingredients and easy to put together.

I am happy I found this recipe. I use butter instead of  shortening. I also sift my flour before adding in the baking powder and salt.I also use unbleached flour. It turns out great every time.

Really a great recipe and it makes light fluffy cupcakes that are great sans frosting!  I put chocolate frosting on some for the kids but left some plain also.  I used butter and creamed it well with the sugar.  Also, I beat in the eggs one at a time.  Lastly, I started and ended with flour per another user's advice.  This will be the "go to" in the future for cupcakes & cakes!

Oh my gosh, I LOVE this recipe!  I just got done making mini cupcakes and they were amazing!  I already ate two of them, not even frosted and they are amazing!  I basically followed the recipe, I just used butter instead of shortening.  I just don't like the idea of eating a ton of Crisco.  Baked at 350 for maybe 1/2 an hour.  Just keep checking and when they look done, check with a tooth pick.  This is the perfect homemade cupcake!

Didn't turn out.  It burnt on the outside and the inside looked underdone.  It was incredibly dense.  Didn't enjoy it at all.  One start for having a good flavor (I used all butter).

I made this cake before, it is VERY easy. I don't really like to use shortening, butter makes it very rich and delcious. I've made this particular cake time and time again and it disappears fast.  I am with others, I don't think the recipe deserves a low rating.

I will not make this "cake" again. It had a texture like cornbread and was very dense. I can't blame this on the fact that i substituted butter for shortening. this is just not as good as advertised.

This makes a great cake.  It always raises well and tastes good.  It's nice and moist too.  I have made this with both shortening and butter; I prefer butter.  I have also made this with Splenda and it turns out good.

I made this as my daughter's birthday cake, and while it's not bad, I can't say it's five stars either. I did add some mini chocolate chips to try and make it a chocolate chip cake, but ultimately my issue with this cake is that it's just not quite what I was looking for in a yellow cake. It's not bad - it's a good cake as long as you aren't using too heavy of an icing (the buttercream icing I generally use for birthday cakes was just a smidge too much for it). But it ultimately doesn't have enough of its own flavor to survive with many icings, since I'm still not sure you would have been able to really taste it with a chocolate icing either. I will say that if you're going to serve it without icing, it's quite good. (We had extra and tried some of the extra without icing.) So my suggestion would be to either use a very light icing or glaze, or stick to powdered sugar on this one. In terms of a yellow cake to use with icings, I will be looking elsewhere. So while I would make this again, I probably won't do so unless I'm wanting a cake to use with a light chocolate glaze or just a bit of powdered sugar.

After reading so many ratings on this recipe which reported replacing 1/2 the shortening with butter, I did the same.  I wish I had replaced ALL of the shortening.  The cake has a terrible, plastic-y shortening flavor which is unmistakably apparent.  It's not even edible with the terrible shortening flavor.  :(

This is a very good recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to use all butter.  It came out moist and delicious.  I did as others suggested and beat the sugar and butter for about ten minutes and also beat in the eggs one at a time until completely incorporated.  This is now a favorite.

My husband and I love this cake! I've made it several times now, and it's turned out perfectly moist every single time. I've never much liked cake without frosting, but even though I do frost it, this cake can really hold it's own! I've found it's even better a day old too. :)

This has been my favorite yellow cake recipe since I found it. But, today I used cake flour instead of all purpose. WOW!! It raised more than usual and turned out lighter and fluffier than ever.
Still the best. And no, it does not taste like cornbread at all.



My 15 year old and I make this cake so much, I had to post again. This is the ONLY yellow cake recipe we use. It's sweet, flavorful, light and fluffy. Perfect basic cake for anything. As I posted in an earlier review--thoroughly creaming the butter/shortening (I use 50/50) and sugar is essential to get the right texture in the end. YUMMY!!

I made this recipe as a two-layer birthday cake. Although it was light and fluffy on the inside, the outside was a bit crispy. As others have stated, the flavor is quite a bit like corn bread.

This is a great cake base.  It was more dense than I thought it would be, but still delicious.  I used all butter, and added almond flavoring.  I also made a chocolate almond mousse for the filling and frosted it with the recipe from the Hershey's cocoa container, minus one cup of the sugar. It was a huge hit at work, and my husband was so happy that I was able to bring a piece home for him too.  I will definitely make it again.

Great flavor, but didn't rise very well at all - very dense, not light and fluffy like cake should be.  I was disappointed and will probably try a different recipe next time.

WOW! This was the best yellow cake from scratch that i've tried. Perfect density and flavor (it didn't come out tasting like a biscuit like many that i've made). The only change I made was to use butter instead of shortening. I frosted it with the "perfectly chocolate chocolate frosting" from the Hershey's cocoa container. YUM!

I was really happy with this cake. I loved the taste, and the fact that I didn't have to use eight egg yolks for this. The only things I changed was the vanilla extract, and I used half butter and half oil, though I think shortening would be better. It's an excellent recipe overall.

I made this cake for my birthday and loved it! I used 1/2 vegetable oil and 1/2 butter instead of shortening, and a few tablespoons more oil on top of that to make the sugar/oil mixture fluffier. It had to bake a bit longer because of that but it came out super moist and perfect. I did two 8" round instead of a 9x13" and frosted it with a rich chocolate frosting. Yummy!!
I just finished the last piece, five days later and I'm sad to see it go. It was just as tasty today as it was the second day! (but not as tasty as it was freshly frosted and unrefrigerated!) I'll definitely make this again!

I used butter instead of shortening and I found the cake to be really heavy even though the batter was really light and simple. Next time I would definitely use the shortening because I found the butter to be too rich (if there is such a thing when it comes to cake).

Love this recipe. I tried it out the other day and it was great. I just thought it was a little too dense, so i might try separating the eggs and beating the egg whites and folding it into the batter next time to see if it lightens it up a bit. I'll let you know how it works.

blech. the only thing that saved this cake was the chocolate frosting. i used the 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening suggestion, but it was still way too dense and overall lacked flavor. i will not make this again.

Very good cake. I made these in the reynolds wraps star cupcake tins and they were so moist, they kept the star shape when popped out of the tin. A keeper! one piece of advice, make with a mixer vs.in the food processor so it doesnt resemble sponge cake vs. yellow cake.

I was looking for a great cake to impress my inlaws but this was not the one. My search continues...however, I hope my son develops a taste for choclate cake like the rest of us. 

Item to note: I used a HUGE star shaped cake pan. The recipe filled the pan, I just  didn't have a cake plate big enough to fit it!! But my 7 year old didn't care how it tasted. He cared that it was decorated and had his name on it. :)

I was looking for an easy cake to accomodate a party guest who was allergic to chocolate.  This was used as the "yellow" side to a decorated cake.  This recipe also works as written when using a 12 inch round cake pan.  Frosted with a buttercream frosting.  The children enjoyed this cake, they didn't just eat the frosting.  I also plan to use slices of cake for a "biscuit" for a strawberry shortcake dessert at an upcoming cookout.  Thank you, Carolyn, for sharing.

As written this cake is a 2 star at best, so I tweaked it by using 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shorting and I also use 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon lemon extract.Still there was something off with it maybe using buttermilk will help. Fyi if you ever find yourself without buttermilk for a recipe. Use vinegar 1 tablespoon to 1 cup of milk etc.

Great cake!  Moist, tender and no seperating eggs.  I usually buy mixes for easy prep.   Never again!  I'd rather spend the time making this cake than serve a bland, out of the box cake.  Served this cake at a family function and even Grandma (the great cook) wanted the recipe.

I made a marble sheet cake using 1/3 cocoa powder in 1/3 of the batter. It was moist and delicious! The texture was much lighter than pound cake but firm enough to hold its shape when cut. I baked it on the convection setting, 325F for 45-50 minutes and frosted it with "Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting". This was a big hit for my friend's birthday cake!

Delicious yellow cake! Last time I made a yellow cake it ended up tasting like cornbread, however this recipe had a wonder buttery flavor and was delicious. I will definately make this again!

Great recipe!  It wasn't overly sweet which was a good thing as I made two rounds, filled the center with lemmon pie filling and covered and decorated the whole lot with a sweet buttercream icing for a birthday cake.  The cake was very moist and dence but light at the same time.  As others have mentioned, I substituted butter for the shortening and it was great! very similar in texture to a pound cake.  Thanks for the great recipe! :o)

This recipe is worth making again. It is extra moist and light. Was real happy with the results. Used it as a boston creme pie.

Very good cake recipe. I've tried several others and so far this is one of the best yellow cake recipes so far. The texture and moistness was excellent although it didn't quite have the 'sweetness' of a cake that i'm used to but certainly worth making! Use the right frosting and you've got yourself a winner.

This is a very nice recipe, easy to prepare and very moist. I used half shortening / half unsalted butter and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. I reduced the sugar because I added a pineapple upside-down topping. All-in-all, a nice recipe.

Was a success--first time making cupcakes from scratch. Read the comments. I did use salted butter (I didn't see if ppl used salted or unsalted---so I went the fun way), was sure to sift the flour, there's was no indication on what type of milk to use, so I went with 2%.  Blended well, I do have a nice Kitchen Aid, 6 qt mixer--it's my baking best friend! I did put in the fridge for about an hour -- saw someone left overnight to better the texture, although I didn't have all night, but some fridge time did seem to help. Baked at said temp for 15 min, filling standard cupcakes up about 3/4 full. Came out fully and moist for me. Good Luck!

The milk amount is wrong, should only be a cup.  The eggs should be separated with the yolks being added to the sugar and butter, and the beaten egg whites, added after  the flour and milk mixture, and should be folded in. Also 1 cup of sugar is more than plenty..

I used this as a base for a Saint Patrickâ€™s Day pistachio cake since I didnâ€™t have a cake mix. I think it turned out great! I only used one teaspoon vanilla and added 2 teaspoons almond extract and a package of pistachio pudding.

Very good yellow cake recipe, creaming shortening and sugar is key (at least 4 minutes) the crumb in the cake came out similar to pound cake, a very tight moist crumb which is what I like. I used it for a birthday cake and frosted and decorated it with a crusting cream cheese buttercream. Itâ€™s even better after 2-3 days.

I found this cake to be the easiest to bake.  I made it in a 8 X 11 pan. Had enough batter to also make a 6 inch cake.  I put my homemade  chocolate icing on the larger one. Then put my canned peach jam on the little one.  Needless to say, I had to sample both while still warm. This will be my go to yellow cake to make!!

Pleasantly surprised. We made it as a family and as suggested I did 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. I creamed them together for more than 2 minutes and added the eggs one at a time. Fairly new to scratch made cakes but I think it came out well. It cooked for almost an hour and Iâ€™d consider trying another flavor or an additional tsp of vanilla next time.

My daughter is planning on getting in to culinary, and she wanted to make yellow cupcakes all on her own.  We tweaked this recipe a bit using the suggested 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening, and substituted the milk with half n half.

This was the best cake I have ever made and I have made a lot of them over the years.  It looked great and tasted even better.  My husband even asked me to make another one as soon as we finished the first one ( in record time I might add).  The only modification i made to the recipe was to use 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 oil instead of one cup better.

Iâ€™m searching for the perfect yellow cake recipe.  Duncan Hines moist deluxe is really good, but itâ€™s not â€˜homemade.

This recipe turned out an excellent cupcake but only a mediocre cake.  The cupcakes were made with King Aurthur AP flour.  The second batch was with Swanks down cake flour and the esults were less hat satisfactory.  Actually threw half he dake away.

Thid recipe (second cake recipe) was returning to King Arthur AP flour.  It was better than the previous cake but still not light and moist to rate it best.  Great for cupcakes, average for a layer cake.

This was my first try at a yellow cake from scratch and didn't love it.  I've been making other cakes from scratch for years.  I did half butter and half shortening, but otherwise made it as written.

A decent cake if properly made. First, have all ingredients at room temp.  Use at least half butter, using all shortening  compromises the flavor too much. Cream shortening/butter and sugar until very light yellow and fluffy. Using a stand mixture, maybe 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating at least a minute each time to thoroughly incorporate. Consider adding an additional teaspoon of vanilla extract or 1\2 teaspoon almond extract to up the flavor profile.  Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together. Add flour mix in three parts, alternating with milk and ending with flour. Mix thoroughly with each addition. Scrape down sides and bottom of bowl and beat for additional minute after all ingredients are in. I baked it in three 8" layers for about 20 minutes and frosted with chocolate buttercream.

Absolutely fantastic recipe !!! Reminded me Starbucks  madeleines but more delicious . Iâ€™m never going to Starbucks again . My nephew 5 y.o  super picky and absolutely loved it  . One thing  : Instead of 2 cups of sugar I put one cup and it was plenty sweet for my family .  Plus when i made chocolate cream its more sugar so I I think we need to take it easy on sugar

When you combine the sugar and eggs! 
The eggs need to sit out at room temperature for at least 10 to 15 mins along with your butter its really important to add one room temp egg at a time let it mix fully with your hand mixer or kitchen aid.  You'll noticed the difference in texture it will be thick and fuffy! ps let your milk sit out for 5 mins to knock the chill off!

I made this for my mother's birthday.  I followed the recipe exactly.    It was good... But I was disappointed in the moistness.  Was hoping for moister.   If I make this again I would decrease baking time significantly.

A waste of eggs.  It's a decent recipe but the extra eggs leave an  unpleasant taste.  I actually regurgitated the cake and had to throw it out.  I had guests that day and they disliked it also

Best cake ever. I followed other reviews and mixed the ingredients thoroughly to get a fluffy, light batter. I frosted it with a simple vanilla frosting. This cake stayed fresh and moist for a few days.

I think this is a good cake. I actually make it according to the recipe as it's so basic it's not worth it to dress it up. I use this recipe if I have to  provide a cake for something (work, school, etc.). It is a dependable and easy recipe.  I use butter instead of shortening.Once I tried to use oil but I wouldn't advise that. Sometimes I use almond instead of vanilla for a change.

The flavor was good, and when I first  pulled it from the oven it looked fluffy. However,while it was cooling, it deflated? Not sure what I did wrong here: followed the directions, exactly. Luckily, I was able to make cake pops, so not a total waste.

I made this cake and at first bite everyone fell in love  with it.  I added on 1 teaspoon of coconut extract.  And for people who do not like coconut,  you will probably like it to.  I made it with no help.  :)

I used this as part of my "fruity shortcake" cake. I made two tweaks....1 cup of water and 3/4 cup of half and half for the milk and 2tbsp potato starch and 1/2 cup of water for the eggs (my "real" eggs are precious for my family of six). It turned out really moist and was gobbled up quickly!

I made this tonight. I used two 9" round cake pans instead of a 9x13. I used strawberry preserves in between the layers while the cake was still warm. Turned out light and fluffy. Everyone loved it and went for seconds!!! I would highly recommend this recipe to any one. Very versatile!! From fresh fruit to buttercream. I saw a few comments about not getting the buttery flavor from the shortening but, I used the butter flavor shortening and you get the best of both worlds :)

I substituted coconut almond milk in place of dairy milk simply because I was out. I ended up adding 1/8 of a cup of heavy cream and then 2 more table spoons of sugar to compensate for the slightly bitter taste of the milk. Finally I substituted butter in place of the shortening just because butter is healthier. The cake was wonderfully simple and smelled wonderful baking. I will be frosting the cake with an all natural almond strawberry buttercream. Thank you so much for this 'award winning' recipe!

Such an easy cake, and DELICIOUS! It's a heavy, dense cake, but still so moist and creamy. It is so flavorful, it goes fine with just a vanilla frosting. It made a fat, gorgeous, bundt cake, and I was thrilled with the results!

This would be my fourth time making this about. It just needs something to keep it moist so I put a tablespoon of olive oil hoping that will do the trick.

I followed the recipe, and it could be my lack of baking skills, but the cake had a very large crumb and unappealing texture for me. The taste was good, texture was not.

I made cupcakes and they came out good but a little thicker than I wanted.  I think I will have to cream the butter/shortening/sugar mix a little longer.  It was my first time with this recipe but I will make it again.

We just tried this recipe as we start a new tradition on mother's day...baking as a family! My kids LOVED the cupcakes! They came out fantastic...extremely moist, delicate and hmm hmm good. We did, however, use 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening. I think, for those whose cupcakes didn't come out the best, try sifting the dry ingredients together. But also, as my husband the chef says, it's IMPORTANT to have your "Misenpas" which is everything you need for the recipe in place before you get going. We had a blast baking today and I enjoyed even more seeing our kids enjoy their "creation"

We really love this cake.  I have a daughter who cannot eat dairy, so we make it with coconut oil in place of the butter/shortening and coconut milk.  Very yummy!  We have also baked this in a 9" x 13" pan and dolloped peach pie filling into it.  That way is a family favorite.

This is a truly excellent cake, if you like yellow cake. I only use box cake mixes as a last resort. I followed the directions on this recipe exactly and got beautiful results. It is not overly sweet. I agree with another reviewer, that it is great to eat without frosting. This will be my only yellow cake mix forever. I was extremely impressed with the results even though I don't really like using shortening in a cake batter.

Delicious!!

I did what many reviews recommended - I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and made sure it was creamed well. I also added the eggs: 1 at a time. I put 1 tablespoons vanilla AND 1 teaspoon almond extract -  (I was using this recipe for a banana cream poke cake) AS WELL as 1/2'd the recipe for a 8 x 8 pan.

The cake was so flavorful!! I do see what others have said - the cake is quite fluffy but I bet it would be a tad dry without the pudding.

All-in-all - it is a good recipe for an AP flour cake that is convenient, easy to follow and fast to prepare!!

Thank you for the recipe!! =D

Just pulled them out of the oven!  I used butter instead of shortening and increased the flour to 3 cups since it was very "liquidy."  I also used 1 Tablespoon of Baking Powder instead of 3 teaspoons.  That's a joke - 3 teaspoons IS one tablespoon!  Lol!  Anyway, the batter tasted heavenly.  They rose well and baked up with a nice firm crumb.  Nothing at all resembling corn bread!  They had a larger crumb, not a fine one, so I think that may be where people are getting the cornbread thing from.  They tasted wonderful!  My friend was here when I pulled the out of the oven and he suggested more butter.  Next time I will put a teaspoon of butter flavoring in them to see if that makes a difference.  I was going for more of a butter cake than a yellow cake though so that's why I was thinking more butter flavor.  They held up well to being filled with ganache and I think it is a nice, basic, versatile cake recipe that I will add to my arsenal for sure!  I see it as a perfect blank canvas to make my own variations with - a good, solid contender!

Excellent, this cake came out very moist and fluffy. I did use butter instead of shortening. I also replaced 1/4 cup of pineapple juice for 1/4 cup of the milk, so that my cake would have a small hint of pineapple. I have to say I was a little bit nervous about making a cake that was not from a box, because I had never done so before. But it came out wonderful, better than any box cake, my family went crazy for it. I will definitely be using the recipe again.

My first attempt at making a cake from scratch, and it was beautiful. I thought it was a little on the heavy side, but I will try again using some tips from other reviews... maybe more milk, or an aditional egg... Definitely a keeper!!!!!!... Update... we added the extra egg, and whipped the mix just a little longer... results were fabulous. Photos to come soon

What a great recipe! I only made a couple changes. Used all butter instead of shortening, added 1 extra egg yolk and a bit of almond extract. The texture is perfect. I also did sift the flour. Excellent!!!

I think everyone should purchase an oven thermometer and check the oven temperatures before even starting a new recipe and then complaining about the results!!! Of all the stoves/ovens I've had, only the Jen-Air temperature was the same as the thermometer. This makes a world of difference in how a recipe turns out, I.e., crisp edges, dry body and disappointment . Of course, the way you mix and add ingredients also count; which in this case, were explained Very well. You Can't fly blind, and neither should you Cook blind!!! :-) I think the recipe was great! I made it the way it was written. Upon additional re-bakes I did make some changes, only to amuse myself. They were All great. That's the nice thing about a great Basic recipe - you can make changes to fit your tastes.

This is a great yellow cake added with some homemade pineapple filling.  I cut down cooking time 10 minutes, blended the shortening and sugar very well.  It makes three 8" rounds. You may want to try substituting butter for shortening.  Lots of compliments on this cake as is.

In spite of the fact that this tastes okay, I was disappointed with the result. It is rated very high and usually the reviews from before help me to alleviate any issues for recipes rated so highly, but that was not quite the case for this. My husband really liked it so perhaps if I take away the title "yellow" and just call it "cake" it's fairly good. I used butter instead of shortening and 5 eggs instead of 4 to help it be less dense as other reviewers had suggested. If you get it out of your head that you're making a typical "yellow cake" it actually does taste fairly good. I also made a chocolate frosting on top with powdered sugar, brown sugar, butter, and cocoa powder, which helped.

Wonderful cake - I used yolks only and added a fifth egg yolk.  I think Crisco shortening is creepy so I used lard.  

This is an old-fashioned cake - more dense than boxed cakes.  It doesn't dome when you bake it - I made it as a fudge-iced 2 layer cake so it was perfect for that.  My Dad declared as good as the cake his mother used to make for his birthday as a kid - we celebrated his 70th birthday with this delicious cake.

This was my first time making yellow cake from scratch.  It was a bit dense, not really light as I wanted it.  It also sunk in the middle and tasted a bit egg-y for me.  I did cream the shortening and sugar for 5 minutes, beat in the eggs one by one, and kept the milk and eggs at room temperature.  Maybe it was because I continued to use the mixer after the dry was added.  I do see how other reviewers could relate this to cornbread - while it does not taste like corn bread, the consistency was very similar.  Other people liked it, but I think I will be trying another yellow cake recipe in the future.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  So this rating is for the recipe as shown.  The flavor of the cake was nice.  The texture was more of a very very dense egg like cake...if you're planning on making a tres leches this would be the type of cake you would want....reminded me of an "egg cake" if that makes sense...best way to describe it...just an odd texture.

I was making a strawberry whipped cream cake and found I didn't have a mix..found this recipe and read some of the reviews and thought I would try it...the strawberry whipped was all we could eat ..I had chilled the cake after topping it and the cake looked like it absorbed all the shortening or something..it was just awful!

Let me just start by saying I have been trying to perfect a moist yellow scratch cake recipe for the longest. My issue has always been that they always come out dry or they come out too sweet. This recipe helped so much! The only thing I did differently was used 2 cups of milk instead of 1 3/4 and I used 2 sticks of butter (1 cup.) I made cupcakes and a cake yesterday and I only have a half cake left. Thanks!

I don't know why anyone would have a problem with this recipe.  The only thing I can think of is not cutting the shortening/butter into the sugar well or not using an electric hand mixer to blend it all together.  This is a wonderful and easy cake recipe.  Does it give you a box mix cake?  No.  What it gives you is an honest to goodness old fashioned yellow cake.  Better on the second day too! :D

This is an excellent recipe! Rose perfectly and perfectly flat as well. Very moist. Very little crumb to knock away prior to frosting. I made it for a special occasion for a special friend and used a MSL Maple Syrup Frosting with pecan crumbs decorating the top. Guests were intrigued by the ingredients and swooned over the the look, taste and perfect crumb of this cake. Many had second pieces. I really dislike boxed cake these days yet rarely have cake flour on hand. The ingredients for this cake are always on the shelf, it is easy to make and the end product is fantastic! I'm making another one today..... Thank you Carolyn your recipe and making me look so accomplished!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because although it tastes good, it does not taste like yellow cake, it tastes more like cornbread, it also didn't help that the icing I used was a buttercream, so the result buttered cornbread...

I quartered it as I am learning how to bake a cake.  It came out perfectly nonetheless.  As I made a smaller amount, I used an 8" round cake pan, lined with waxed paper.  I mention this because I momentarily wondered what happened to that, but then, it slipped my mind.  Then, I proceeded to frost on top of it.  I am grateful this was a test, not the real presentation.  Better to make my mistakes early.  I frosted the cake with 1/4 of the following: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/white-frosting/.  This also worked out well.  I didn't change the ingredients or modify.  It has been many years since I tasted a scratch cake.  From that point of view, this was a fabulous endeavor.  I will make it again for the real event for which I practicing.

I was SO disappointed in this cake.  I made if for my sweetheart's birthday, instead of taking the easy way out and buying Dunkin Hines.  Well, I wish I had taken the easy way out!  This cake was tasteless and had the consistency of DRY corn bread!  If we hadn't had vanilla ice cream to accompany it, I'm not sure we would've been able to swallow it!  AWFUL!!  Never again!!  Tomorrow, I'll be making him a do-over cake and I'll follow another poster's recommendation regarding the addition of an egg and a box of instant pudding.  ANYTHING will be an improvement on this "cake", err DOORSTOP or PAPERWEIGHT!

Love this recipe. It's easy & quick..The problem I had the last time was I put it in two 9inch round pans & it cooked out of the pan! Haha There is a lot. But this time, I'm using a good 9x13 glass pan to cook it in. Hope it turns good.

This recipe turned out beautifully. Make sure to thoroughly cream the sugar and butter. The texture and flavor if this cake were rich and delicious. I will never purchase a box cake again. I paired this cake with homemade lemon curd between two cake rounds and on top.

This was really great! I wouldn't say it was "fluffy" (although I whipped the butter/sugar enough that the batter was SUPER fluffy going in), but it had a wonderful texture! Kind of between a cake and a pound cake. The only change I made was cutting down the sugar, which probably change it a little (I used one heaping cup).  sliced it lengthwise with a serrated knife, and spread a thin layer of strawberry jam, iced it with vanilla buttercream and topped with blueberries and strawberries. It was beautiful and my husband's family loved it! I'll definitely make it again! Don't even mess with boxed cake mixes again!

I saw the shortening in the recipe and hesitated, but thought hey! This is something different, might be a good change. Wrong! It had an off flavor. I suppose if you substituted butter for the shortening it would be better, but...then it would be more like a pound cake. At least the texture was fluffy. Out of my recipe box you go!

This recipe was PERFECT. I substituted butter for shortening like many others and halved it to make about 15 just above the liner cupcakes (you could squeeze 16 cupcakes out of half this but I'm a habitual batter eater). I've already eaten two before they've cooled because they're too yummy I didn't want to wait to frost them! 
To those negative reviewers, I imagine that they didn't really mix things in. You need to seriously cream your sugar and butter before proceeding (thank heavens for mixers) and add the other ingredients SLOWLY. I did cheat and add the baking powder and salt just tossed in before the milk and flour instead of mixing it in with the flour because I was too lazy to get out another bowl. Then I added 1/3 cup flour, then 1/4 milk, alternating til I'd done it all and making sure the previous addition was fully integrated before proceeding. It gave me a perfectly light spongy, moist cake.

I also suspect many people are unhappy it does not taste like a box cake, but I think it tastes much better, and certainly more natural. This is plain and simple good baking.

This cake is delicious and dense. I throw an orange zest for fresh flavor. It's a hit for yellow cake lover.

After reading some reviews I made a few changes:  I used butter flavored shortening and I sifted the dry ingredients.  I don't have a Kitchenaid so I had to use my hand mixer (which works quite well).  I mixed the shortening and sugar VERY well, for about 6 minutes, and mixed in one egg at a time.  I alternated mixing in the milk and the flour as directed. I made sure the whole concoction was well mixed. I put the batter in 2 round 9" pans. 

My end result was this:  The cake looked beautiful and had no problem rising.  I did get a caramelized coating as other reviewers mentioned.  It was light and fluffy, but too sweet, and I thought overall it was not very tasty.  I'll continue my search for a delicious yellow cake.

I made this cake about a week in advance to my wedding last year. I had to make several for the amount of tiers I needed. I also tweeked the some of the ingredients to fit what we wanted...I added 2 tablespoons of bakers concentrated raspberry puree to the mixture as well as substituting 1 cup of milk for 1 cup of champagne. After baking and cooling I added another 2 to 3 tablespoons of champagne drizzled over the cake and then securely wrapped the cakes in plastic wrap and then foil to prevent any air from getting into the cake. It kept all week in the freezer until I needed to decorate it the day of my wedding. It was PHENOMINAL!!! I also added Bavarian Cream in between the layers for a little extra something. The reviews from our guests were no less than extraordinary. If you follow the recipe properly and you know your oven then you can't mess this one up. Baking is a science and intuition, if you don't put love into what your baking it will never come out just right.

I love this cake! I made it for a co-worker for his birthday and he loved it along with everyone that tasted it.  I also made it to go along with Sunday dinner and my family loved it.  I changed a few things like I used 6 eggs and 1/2 cup of real butter and 1/2 cup of shortening. It was great and I will be making it again this Sunday!

This is the best cake I have ever made! Way better than a box cake and just as easy.  One recipe is the perfect size for two 8" pans. I used this recipe to make a decorated cake and it was great to work with. Dense enough that it didn't fall apart easily but tastes light and fluffy. This will now be my go to cake recipe!

My 16 y/o daughter made this into cupcakes. It didn't rise up like a box cake and she was worried she had messed it up. But when we tried the cupcakes it was WONDERFUL!! Her friends at school who she took them to said they were the best cupcakes ever. Even my hubby who doesn't like sweets really liked them. We liked them so much that I am writing this review and I have never commented on any other recipe before. I bribed her into making more!! Yummy!!!

Big hit! Makes great cupcakes - a light, not-too-sweet, spongy cake, with a slightly crunchy exterior. Good with or without icing. Made cupcakes (6 doz with a double batch) using this recipe and a triple-batch of "Simple and Delicious Buttercream Frosting" this week. Received unsolicited raves from kids and adults alike. This recipe makes about 30 cupcakes. My adjustments (per batch): Substituted 1 cup of the AP flour with 1 cup, plus 2 Tbsp, cake flour; Substituted salted butter for 1/2 the shortening; Used butter-flavored shortening; Added 1 extra egg; Baked for 25-30 minutes @ 350 "Convection-Bake" setting in a convection oven; Used a large, 24-muffin tin,so had to rotate the pan every 10 minutes or so to ensure even doneness; Used cupcake cups to line pans, so no need to prepare pan. This one is a keeper! (PS: Substitued salted butter in the icing, too.)

Delicious and easy! I swapped 1/2 the shortening for butter, made sure all the ingredients were at room temp before I started, and baked the whole thing in 2 9" pans.

I also added one extra egg, and used butter instead of shortening. It was amazing. I also added a tablespoon of peanut butter and layered it with bananas and chocolate. It was one of the moistest cakes I have ever made from scratch. This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe came out tasting just like cornbread. I made it according to the recipe and was not pleased at all.  My family scraped the icing off and just ate that and left the cake.

Cake was a disaster.  Did not rise and deflated the moment it was taken out of the oven.  Waste of money as I calculate the cost of igredients. I read the reviews, positive and negative and decided to make it in spite of the few negative reviews.  How could so many people have success and give such glowing reviews?  I really wanted to have a positive experience.

This was my first attempt at making a cake from scratch.  It came out great!  It was very moist, the texture was perfect, and it was just delicious.  I'll never buy a yellow cake box mix ever again.

This cake was really good and moist. I typically don't like yellow cake but I will make this one again.  I have a convection oven and I think that the temp was too high. All in all the cake have great flavor.  I did however add an extra egg yolk.

This cake is good, although its not really a cake, more like cornbread. It would go great with chili, not frosting.Its thick and heavy instead of light and fluffy. I followed the recipe as written, no substitutions.

This gets five stars if using some of the suggestions by other reviewers. Creaming in an additional 2 yolks made for an incredible batter and a rich, very moist cake. I used 2 inches of vanilla bean instead of the extract. I prefer the taste of butter and used that instead of shortening. Also, when using this as a base for coffee cake, I substitute buttermilk for regular milk which makes a richer, less sweet-tasting cake. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Carolyn!

This turned out great! I used 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 shortning and added 1 egg white. I made a 5 (thin) layer cake and cooked for 12 min. They were super moist & delicious!

This recipe is awesome and will now be the basic cake recipe for me. In addition to the ingredients, I added an 8oz of sour cream, 1/2 box of instant vanilla pudding and 1/4 cup of vegetable oil.  OMG, this has a down home taste just like your mom and grandmom used to make in the cast iron stove.  I will use this same recipe to make an Apple Jelly cake.  Soooooooo good!

I have to agree with the "dense" cake idea.  I have made a lot of cakes in my lifetime and this one just didn't turn out. I read the reviews and was going to find another cake instead because I did not want a dense cake then I read the most recent review and the person said she had to reprint the recipe and everyone loves the cake.  The only thing I can say is maybe because she advised to use butter instead of shortening and I used margarine (I don't use real butter for anything).

This in my opinion was not an ideal yellow cake.  The cake was very dense and heavy.  There was a sugary crust that formed after baking.

Tried this recipe and it was the worst cake I ever baked.  It was not sweet and was not moist.  I followed the recipe using 1 stick butter and 1/2 cup shortning.  Will end up throwing the cake in the trash.

What a delicious cake this is! My changes: I used butter instead of shortening, I doubled the vanilla and added 1/4 cup more milk.  I made a Bundt cake and it was gigantic! (I also made a mini cake to taste test it in advance) A box mix would have given me 2/3 of the size I got from this recipe. I think the texture was fine, you can tell it is a cake from scratch, it has a different density but still tastes yummy! I plan on using chocolate frosting on it because it will be a birthday cake, but honestly, no frosting is needed! Thanks for a great recipe, it's a keeper!

Very delicious and moist. The only change I would suggest is to use 1/2 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup of butter, instead of 1 cup of shortening. It makes it so the cake is moister. Also, to make the cake lighter I would suggest sifting or whisking the flour mixture. Makes a big difference. As long you follow the recipe exactly when it comes to combining the ingredients, you will have one delicious yellow cake!!

I made this cake to put fresh sliced strawberries and whipped cream on. It was amazing!!! The leftover cake we have been eating plain! It has a wonderful flavor and is absolutely delicious! I did use the 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening idea. YUMMY! Will make again for sure!

I tried this recipe today instead of the one I have used for years. I made it for my brother's birthday but was disappointed and will be making another one for him. I wanted a two layer yellow cake with fudgy chocolate frosting.   This cake came out very moist but too dense. However the worst part to me that it is way too sweet. If I were to put frosting on it I think it would be overwhelmingly sweet.   I did use coconut oil for the shortening which could affect the texture some, altho I usually have good luck using the coconut oil even in cake mixes. But it is just too sweet. Two cups of sugar to 2 and 3/4 cups flour - I think that ration is just too much. It would taste good for a soft cookie and I may try to make this into biscotti. But I will make a different cake to frost.

This is a very good and moist cake. I have never made a homemade cake before and this was really good. I follwed the recipe except did 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter. The edges came out a little crispy so I shaved them down and with my homemade buttercream icing it looks and tastes wonderful. Will definately use this for future yellow cakes. Thanks!!!

Delicious cake,I only change the shortening to 1/2 cup of Crisco butter flavor and 1/2 of butter,also 45 minutes was too long,35 minutes was perfect,the secret to moisture and flufiness is mixing the shortening,butter and sugar with a mixer..I mixed mine for about 10 minutes probably not necessary but it was delicious..I  was stuck at home in a snow storm so I decided to make it from scratch...it came out beautiful..

I made this as my first-ever from scratch cake and it turned out wonderfully! Using AP flour instead of cake flour did make it a trifle denser I guess would be the word, but that's how my husband loves it! He was eating it without the frosting! ha Great flavor and very very moist!

Great basic recipe. Cake was moist with a good texture. VERY dense, but that could be because of my alteration. Sub 1 jar of babyfood pears for 1/2 of the shortening. Hubby and kids loved it. Topped with cream cheese frosting

This cake did taste a little like cornbread. I took off a piece while putting it together. I stacked two of them and it did indeed taste a little like cornbread. :/ Maybe if I add a brown sugar butter glaze it might taste better...made it for Thanksgiving, hope my folks aren't disappointed in it. They were pretty excited when I said I was going to make it.

This is my favorite yellow cake recipe from now on. I love to bake and I am always searching for new recipes to try and I found this. The cake came out perfect. It was nice and light, fluffy and moist all in one. And it is very simple and easy to make. My whole family enjoyed this recipe.

I follewed quite a few of the suggestions and still end up with a cake that had a cornbread texture.  Dont get me wrong the taste was good but the texture not so much.  Next time I will try the cake flour and hopefully it will be more cake like.

I do a fair amount of baking, but I've never made a cake from scratch before. I read the other reviews and made sure to cream and beat everything well. I followed the recipe as is, no butter. Just tasted the cake while it was cooling and... tastes just like cornbread. It looks like a lot of people have had success with this recipe but I'm not sure what I did wrong. Think I'll try another recipe next time.

this was a good cake to make since i had all ingredients on hand, however i think i'll keep looking or just buy box mix next time. it wasn't bad tasting just really had no taste at all. i did use 1/2 (room temp) butter/ 1/2 shortening, increased the sugar 1/4c. more, extra tsp of vanilla and was surprised it wasn't more flavorful. as far as fluffiness and moistness it was excellent and i think the key to that is mixing well, i mixed butter and shortening first making sure they were well blended before adding my sugar, basically i spent at least 10-15 min total blending time and added the flour/milk alternation very slowly taking my time and i think as a result the consistency of the cake was perfect. but if i ever make again i think i'd increase the sugar to 3c. total. oh and also i added yellow food coloring after the eggs and vanilla to make it more obviously a "yellow" cake.  i didn't have any complaints, i just personally didn't think it was that awesome

This is a great recipe.  Needed a cake recipe for a birthday cake while at our cottage. The ingredients are so basic, so it was easy to pull it together. I also used butter instead of the shortening and it was wonderful!  I was in Canada when I made it, and our friends there were  impressed. I WILL use this recipe again.

Love love love this recipe!  I have been using it for about 3 years now and always get rave compliments on it.  The only thing I change is I add a tad bit more sugar...we like it sweet!    I have found that it cooks up much differently if I mix the ingredients using a stand mixer vs. a hand mixer.  That's probably because the use of a stand mixer is pretty new to me and I need to learn proper techniques for using it.  Anyway...  In summary, LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Decent.  It may be that I just don't know what to expect from yellow cake.  My wife liked it, but maybe she was just being polite.  I found that it tasted much better after sitting for 24 hours, but I really doubt I'll make it again.  Then again, the milk chocolate frosting I put on top was most excellent. (3oz semi-sweet chocolate chips, 3.5oz milk chocolate bar, powdered sugar, butter, and milk)

This cake is flavorful and moist.  Just keep an eye on it as baking times may differ and you do not want to overbake it so that it comes out moist.  I use it as a base for many other cakes that I make.

I went the 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening route and it tasted great. I made cupcakes & noticed that they raised better in my airbake pan than the silicone pan. But both pans taste just fine. I baked the cupcakes for 30 minutes.

WOW! It was airy, and so delicious! I have been struggling with finding a good yellow cake recipe and this is it! I love it! and it goes great with birthday cake ice cream (i made it into an ice cream cake)... the key to the recipe is following it step by step.  Do NOT add all ingredients to a bowl and blend they need to be done in steps.

Not a bad cake, but I wouldn't say it is the best.  For me it had slight cornmeal-y texture and somewhat flavor, kind of like cornbread with sweet butter.  I followed the recipe.  A lot of people rated it 4 stars, but only after they had changed it, which doesn't make sense to me.  I rate it 3 maybe less.  I guess if I made a bunch of changes it would be 4 stars, but then I wouldn't be rating this recipe.

I just made this cake for my daughters birthday, and it was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, and baked it in 2 (8 inch round) pans. I have never had a great recipe for yellow cake, and this one is it! I put strawberries and frosting in between the two layers and used the "sturdy whipped cream frosting" recipe on this site. The result was great. I received many compliments! This recipe is a keeper!

Thank you for this recipe! This was only my second cake I've ever made from scratch. I doubled it and made a 3 tier cake for my daughters first birthday! (see pic :) I did use butter instead of shortening, maybe added a little extra vanilla, but that was all and it was delicious! We all loved it and even my husband who doesn't like cake very much thought it was great.  Was worth the effort to make it, because it was so much better than a store bought cake!

This was my first venture into making scratch yellow cake. It was a decent first attempt. I read a bunch of reviews beforehand and made sure to cream the sugar and butter thoroughly and add the eggs one at a time mixing every time. I also used butter flavored shortening hoping to get the best of both worlds. The texture was good, light and fluffy, a tad dry, but I think I'm just used to really moist cakes. I do have to agree though, it did taste a little cornbread-y to me. While sweet, the flavor was just kind of bland, it was lacking something. A decent recipe but there has got to be better yellow cake recipes out there!

Eh, the texture was good, but the flavor was just not there. I wanted to incorporate just a little bit of butter flavor so I used 3/4 cup of shortening and 1/4 cup of butter. The cake was flavorless, I ended up eating it with a fruit jam glaze in the middle which helped. I don't think I would make this again.

This was a great cake, although it did have a bit of corn bread flavor texture. I'm not sure how to fix that, but while it was fresh out of the oven, I poured a can of crushed pineapple over it and a can of sweetened condensed milk and the refrigerated it. For frosting- prepared a box of vanilla pudding and a tub of cool whip to top the cake. DELICIOUS!

I am not sure why, but cake turned out very dense and did not taste good.  My husband just ate the icing after his first bite.  I used butter instead of shortening and I added eggs one at a time mixing well after each addition as a few reviews suggested.  I followed the rest of directions in recipe.  I am disappointed since recipe had such great reviews.  I may try it again to see if I get better results.

This was pretty disappointing. I did all the right things: I substituted butter for the crisco, I beat the heck out of the butter and sugar, and I added the eggs one at a time. The cake was very dense and maybe even a little oily. I have to say, though I didn't want to, this definitely reminded me of corn bread. I gave it two stars because it IS edible, but I won't be making this again.

Ever since finding this recipe, it has been the only yellow cake recipe I use.  I have had multiple people request that I make this cake for their kid's birthday parties, and it is always a winner!  Usually the first thing people say when they bite into it is, "Wow, that's a moist cake!"

Finally!!!! A moist yellow cake from scratch. I took some of the advice that was given and I went 50/50 butter flavor Crisco and butter.  It turned out perfect. Chocolate frosting really topped it off and it didn't last long in my house. This is the only yellow cake that I'll use again.. Thanks...

I've tried many different cake recipes and this one is the best so far.  I did use cake flour instead of all purpose and the cake came out light, moist and perfect.  I also weigh my flour to get an exact measurement.

Very good, better than the "yellow cake from scratch" recipe. Not enough to make this for my son's party, so I broke down and used the box.  I liked the taste, though I was looking for a lighter fluffier cake..  Just like the other recipe, it came out like a corn bread consistency.  "might" try this again another time.

Great basic cake/cupcake recipe. Little changes: 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening; 3 tsp (high-quality) vanilla extract; 2.5 tsp baking powder. And like others have said, the fats and sugar must be creamed for a long time, and scrape bowl down and beat well after addition of each egg. I made one 8"x8" pan for a small birthday party (split and made into 2 layers with buttercream frosting) and the rest as cupcakes for my husband to take to work. He said his coworkers were upset because there weren't enough for everyone to have seconds!

I'm not sure what i did (and i am sure it was me and not the recipe...) but the texture of this cake was weird.  I am pretty sure i over beat the eggs based on reading other reviews.  The flavor of this cake was good, just be careful not to overbeat!  i will probably try it again....

It's a little sweet for my taste. It's also a bit tough. I think cake flour might help- otherwise this is certainly the type of cake that could handle juicy fruit and added flavoring (like rum, or expresso) after baking- it's sturdy and can be carved easily.  If you looking for delicate and subtle this isn't the right recipe.

We made ours into an Oreo cake.  Just add 2-3 cups of chopped Oreos to the batter before you pour it in the pan.  Yummy!

I used butter instead of the shortening. The cake was incredibly sweet, dense and moist. I would have been better off cutting them in 1in. sq. pieces as they were so intense. We all loved it but got stomach aches afterward. The sugar caramelized on the edges of the cake and it was hard to get out of the pan. If I made this again I would reduce the sugar and butter.

Last week I decided that I wanted to learn how to make a yellow cake from scratch because I was tired of using the box mixes. I found this website and decided to go with this recipe. My 3 year old is always eager to help me in the kitchen even if he isn't going to eat the finished product. Well, along with my 3 year old we made the cake and it was delicious. My husband  was very impressed that it came out so delicious and moist on the first attempt. I added chocolate icing and the rest is history..and so is the cake..it's almost gone! Thanks!

I did not care for this recipe.  I creamed the shortening and sugar for over 3 minutes and it seemed perfectly creamed.  The cupcakes, as others said, were coarse and dry- with the consistency of cornmeal muffins.  I put chocolate icing on the cupcakes and gave them to my boyfriend to take to work.  I would not make these again!

Loved it! I forgot to add my milk, so i didnt add it alternating with the dry ingredients... so My batter turned out a little lumpy looking, but it baked fine.

This was a really moist cake. I've never made cake from scratch, but this turned out great! The only thing I didn't like is that is lacks that true "Yellow Cake" flavor. I don't know if that makes sense... It almost was too sweet, and not buttery/salty enough. Maybe I will try using all butter in place of shortening (this time I used half and half). Still, it tasted very good! I think I'm just to used to the taste of box cake. :)

Delicious!  Substantial!  Only substitutions were 2 sticks of salted butter instead of shortening.  Made this with Quick and Almost-Professional Buttercream Icing for my son's birthday cake.  It was great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not sure what happened but I followed the recipe exactly and it did not turn out very well.  It was heavy and the kids said it tasted like sweet cornbread without the cornmeal.  The liked it and did eat it. For this I'm giving 3 stars.

I LOVE THIS CAKE!  I have made this with both a 50/50 shortening butter mix and with shortening only.  Either way is is wonderful, moist, and very yummy!  Best of all if freezes really well so you can make it ahead and frost it when needed!

I liked the cake; husband optional. I may try and add more sugar (although I don't think that it needs it) but maybe the hubby will like it more with more sugar. I followed the instructions exactly...you really do need to cream the sugar and butter (I used butter only) and it turned out very light and moist.

I made this recipe exactly as written and I wasn't impressed by it.  I thought it had a funny texture, like it was a but crumbly instead of smooth.  It was moist and had a great flavor though.  My only complaint was the texture.  Everyone who made the cake loved it except for me, so maybe I'm more picky than most.  If I ever need a yellow cake recipe I will make it again because of the good reviews from everyone who ate it.

this cake was not at all what i expected it to be like. i started out making cupcakes, they took twice as long to bake and still looked underdone and dense in the middle. i used the rest of the batter to make a 9inch round cake, which didn't rise at all, and is also underdone-looking inside. Maybe, because of the 4 eggs, it's SUPPOSED to be pudding-like, but from reading the other reviews, i wasn't expecting that. won't make it again.

Amazing! I tried it the first time and my cakes usually come out hard or have holes and terrible texture but this one was lovely. Soft and moist and it tasted great. I added 1/4 cup of coffee and 1/2 tbsp of cinnamon to it too and it's great with vanilla ice-cream!

It's a scratch cake, only slightly better than a box mix.  It tastes like a box, except for the texture of the outside.  It might have benefited from the use of butter, but I followed the recipe exactly.  Cannot.recommend.this.cake.

Instead of a cake, I made cupcakes and they turned out to be very crunchy on top. They were only ok but not as sweet as a cake should be. I found the flavor to be just a bit bland. They can not stand alone. The only thing that saved them was my Mocha Madness frosting.

Great cake recipe.  The first time I made this I was "multi-tasking" made a HUGE mistake.  I was thinking I was putting into the flour mixture the suggested amount on baking powder, but after in was already in the oven it dawned on me...I put baking SODA instead.  I knew I was going to throw that batch in the trash (and I did), but not before I tasted a sample.  It was okay.   I went ahead and made another batch with the CORRECT ingredients and I must say it was pretty good!!  I just might keep this recipe as a base for something else.  It was not as light and fluffy as boxed cake.  It was a very heavy cake and seemed just a tad dry the next day even even though the cake was covered. I might just ue it as a bundt cake or something.  I'll try to make again to see if it wasn't a fluke.   It was still a very great tasting cake!  It didn't even need the frosting I put on it.  It isn't everyday I can say that.

I followed this recipe exactly based on some expert level reviews, and I am happy to say that I have moist, fluffy, and not-to-sweet cupcakes for my daughter's birthday treat at school. Phew-all of the reviews made me nervous! If you want a very sweet cupcake/cake, this probably is not the recipe for you.

This was the best cake recipe I have come across. I made cupcakes for a party and everyone raved about them. Even suggesting I open a bakery! I substituted the shortening for butter and they were fabulous! For the frosting I simply used butter, confection sugar, a little milk, and raspberry flavoring which always catches people by surprise. Thanks again for posting this awesome recipe!

I decided to make cupcakes instead of cake for this recipe. The cupcakes were so light and buttery. They had a good taste. I did do half shortening and half butter. The tops of my cupcakes did get a crispy (like other reviewers stated), but I decided to cover it up with a lot of icing. I will make again! Much better than box.

The flavor was very good. Everyone wanted it without icing; however, it was a little dense and crumbly. It was hard to level out for stacking.

I tried it the way the recipe stated, and it was great.  Then I tried using butter flavor shortening. Even better. When I make the layers, I use a jam or preserves as a filling.

Tried this cake for the first time.  I used some of the tips from other reviewers......used half shortening and half margarine...creamed with sugar very well...beat very well after each addition.  It was a decent cake; not exactly the "yellow" cake taste from the box...but I would bake it again.  Did have a little bit of the crunchy crust and I can see what people mean about it having the texture of cornbread.

So yummy! Light and fluffy- be sure to beat the batter for a good amount of time after each addition of ingredients and use room temp ingredients. I reduce the sugar to half the flour. Strangely, this cake is perfect fresh out of the oven, but gets rubbery and dry as the day goes on.

Excellent!  I used butter instead of shortening--it was moist, dense and very yummy--just the way I like a yellow cake--I served it with a home made chocolate butter cream icing and it was fabulous!!  Thanks for sharing!

Really awesome cake.  The flavor reminded me a little bit of a sweet cornbread and it's the only reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.  I've never been a big fan of yellow cake always been a chocolate cake fan, but I needed it for a cake class so I looked up this recipe and was debating between this and another.  I'm glad I went with this one.  It is super light moist.  I would have thought it would be so much denser because of the 4 eggs, but it wasn't.  I subbed out milk for soy due to allergies, and my 1 yr old loved it too!

A recipe I hope to make again and again! Quite easy and I normally have all of these ingredients at the house, which is even better. I did use 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter. Cake was delicious and moist- I received many compliments. Works well with a chocolate icing too.

This cake was delicious.  My dad and husband loved it.  The only thing I noticed was that the cake seemed somewhat heavy instead of light and fluffy.  I followed the directions exactly as shown.

This recipe was pretty good.  I did not find it to taste or look like cornbread at all.  It was not overly sweet, but it was just enough. I added chocolate chips too, and it was good without icing, though with icing it tasted good too!

Great recipes.  Easily the best "yellow" cake mix.  Way better than that box stuff.

I made this cake for my daughter's second birthday decorated as Diego (from Go, Diego, Go). I feel somewhat bad rating this having adjusted ingredients (50/50 butter/shortening, 3 tsp. vanilla, only 1 1/2 C. milk), but I must say that I think there might be several things that are contributing to a poor outcome for some people. My recipe was somewhat runny, so I omitted the last 1/4 C. of milk, but I live in a slightly higher altitude (problem?). It might also be because there is a large # of eggs in this that if they are not very well incorporated, and butter is used instead of shortening (or in part) and perhaps not creamed fully, that this may be causing the butter and eggs to separate in the cooking process, similar to a chess pie (which has similar ingredients), causing a different consistency and a strong egg smell. But mine turned out very well. I made it twice because I managed to break the first one handling it (the 1st was 9X13, the second was 2 9in round pans). The cake was slightly reminiscent of yankee cornbread in taste, but it's ingredients are similar, minus the cornmeal. Still, it was very tasty and very moist, but dense enough to be handled for decorating. I would recommend doing a crumb coat with the frosting and using baking/parchment paper to line the bottom of your pan. My family devoured the first ruined cake even without frosting.

This cake is wonderful! My ten year old daughter wanted to bake something (she'd never baked before) and this is the recipe we used. It was simple and it turned out great. I did use butter instead of the shortening...I don't like to use shortening. I'll definitely use this one again.

Wow...super dry!  I was very surprised that such a basic recipe could turn out really quite horrible.  I am not sure what it was but suspect it may be the 45 min baking time...who knows...yuck.  On to something else I suppose.

I made this cake according to the recipe, other than using butter instead of shortening. It came out perfect.  This is one of the best cakes I have made from scratch, and I have tried many.  The trick, as others have said is to really beat the shortening and sugar until fluffy.  I also beat the batter in between eggs and a little extra at the end.  It was light, moist.  Mine took longer than the 45 min, more like 52-53.  I topped with Chocolate Frosting I from this website and it was wonderful.

This was okay. I used butter instead of shortening. It tasted fine, not great but not horrible. It had a cornbread consistency, which is probably not what it's supposed to be like. It also somewhat tasted like a sweet cornbread. I've had much better homemade cakes, so it's not just me being unaware of what a non-box mix cake tastes like. I personally think boxed cake mixes taste better than this one. This cake was also not the color I was expecting... it was more of an amber color instead of yellow. I also think 45 minutes was 10-15 minutes too long of a cook time. My cake was a little dry.

I followed the directions exactly except did 50/50 butter and shortening and it turned out very dense and didn't have a great flavor.  I ended up buying a boxed cake mix instead.  What a bummer.

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday and followed the recipe exactly.  It took a little longer than 45 minutes to bake but looked great when done.  I had to cut out some of the cake to decorate it, and the kids and I devoured the scraps - delicious!  Unfortunately, because of time constraints, I had to make and frost the cake two days ahead of time, so by the time we actually got around to eating it at the party, it tasted a bit drier than when it first came out of the oven.  However, it still received rave reviews.

This was a great cake. I used Tracey's Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe, and the cake was as beautiful as it was delicious. I might have slightly overcooked it because the edges were dry and too crispy. I used round 9" pans and set the timer for 30 minutes. At 25 minutes, it smelled done so I checked it but it was too late. The middle was fine, and my husband said it was one of the best cakes I've made, but I like a really moist cake. I'm going to try again with a 9x13 pan.

I'm a big fan of cakes and baking them and I'm pleased with this recipe.  What I baked didn't come out dense or like cornbread, mine came out fluffy and light. My cake did rise unlike what happened with negative reviewers.  I did tweak the recipe a bit by: adding an extra quarter to half teaspon of additional baking powder; adding 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla; exchanging lard with 2 sticks of butter; replacing 2 eggs with a half cup of egg substitute; and, reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (I don't like my cakes too sweet).  When I beat the butter and sugar together I made sure it was fluffy and light as I do with most recipes that requires creaming butter with sugar.  I'll have to agree that there was an eggy smell in the kitchen afterwards so when I make this recipe again I'll reduce the amount of eggs used by using 1/2 cup egg substitute and 1 egg.

I followed this recipe exactly and the cake was very crumbly.  I wiped the pans with shortening and dusted with flour for easy removal but that didn't help this cake.  It stuck to the cake for all it was worth.  I ended up having to dig it out with a knife.  The cake didn't rise very much either.  Not my idea of a good cake.  I should have just run out to the store and bought a box cake.

Baked the cake into cupcakes instead of a cake. Made the adjusments as suggested by using half butter and less baking powder and more vanilla. The cake tastes ok frosted. Unfrosted the cake has a corn bread consistency. The cake overall lacks flavor.

We still can't figure out what we did wrong. Followed the recipe exactly, just substituted butter for shortening. Made it in a 9" round pan and it came out oily, dense like a brick. Our 7 year old cousin, who helped make it for his birthday, thought it was great, thank gosh.  So many people had great results, but many had trouble too.

I found this to be a wonderful recipe, perfect for those who don't want all those perservitives that you find in boxed versions. I used an egg sub. since we are egg free. I also added a cherry gelatin ( one cup boiling water to gelatin mix prepared after the batter and set aside to cool.) to the top after taking out of the oven:) Great for snacking, or add whipped cream for a great formal dessert. I will be using this recipe again and again

The batter was fluffy and light however the cakes all sunk in the center when cooking. They tasted good but had a cookie like texture.

I thought this cake was okay. I couldn't find the recipe for my buttermilk cake so I tried this one. This cake wasn't as heavy was I wanted. It kind of reminded me of a box mix. I might try it again using buttermilk to see if that would change the consistency. Overall... I didn't like it very much...

This was a great recipe.  The dozen or so people who ate it gave it two thumbs up. Followed the recipe exactly, and lined the bottom of the pan with parchment.  Worked great!!!  Thanks!

I have made this cake a number of times, and enjoy it every time.  I did like other's suggested in regards to 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter... Great flavor and texture...Will never go back to box mixes.

Very good. It didn't last very long at all. I made it for my granddaughter's birthday.  It is like a recipe I had many years ago.  I used a homemade caramel frosting.

It was okay. I used butter flavored shortening and two 8" pans for 25 minutes at 350 instead of the 9"x13". Very fluffy and easy to make.

Ok, I bake a lot, but I am little shy with cakes. I took the advice of previous posts (creaming the sugar & shortening, adding extra vanilla, beating mixture after adding the eggs), it helped avoid the problems I read, but it really wasn't that tasty. It came out fine, just not flavorful. It was not moist nor dry just OK. I don't think I will use this recipe again. I will try another one. Oh and I did substitute half butter for the shortening (did half & half of each) and I used 2% milk. Just FYI. It came out well and not crummy, just not as good and I hope taste wise.

Came out soft but didnt rise much - hence the four star. But it did have good texture, did not crumble, was moist did not smell of eggs, the top did not crust. But this is not THE yellow cake recipe....needs a bit of tweaking to make it rise fluffy.

This was ok, not very yellow, a little bit plain. I used 3tsp vanilla, baked in 2 9"round pans for about 30-35min. Texture was good, a bit dry.

This was my first time baking a non-box mix cake and it turned out great.    I agree that the key is to cream the butter and sugar really well.  Thanks!

With 1/2 butter, the flavor was nice, but it came out dense & tough compared to the many cakes I make. The edges set and baked before the center rose, possibly due to the high proportion of liquid, causing a center hump. I would give this a "1", but I did change 1/2 of the fat to butter, so I am giving 100% shortening the benefit of the doubt.

My daughter is allergic to dairy products, so I can't use most boxed desserts.  For this recipe, I used rice milk (only 1 1/2c because it's thinner than regular milk).  I still had to add a little extra flour because it was too thin.  Next time, I think I'll reduce it to 1 c. of rice milk and see from there.

I made the recipe using the 1/2 cup shortening and butter option and it turned out just perfect.  If you like a dense, rather then fluffy yellow cake you will like this. I used a variety of pans, greasing and flouring them and after cooling the cakes, they came out easily.  I used them to make a theme cake and they took well to my cuttings even though I had just made them that day.  Highly recommended.  Thank you for the recipe.

Im eating it as I type, this cake recipe is definatly the best ever!!! I added a teaspoon of orange juice and instead of 1 cup butter i only put in 3/4 cup. This is beyond good and better than any other cake mix I've made!

This cake was ok. I took one of the other reviewer's suggestions and used 1/2 cup shorting and 1/2 cup butter. It had a slight cornbread taste to it but it was still good with frosting on it. Would make this again if I had a really bad sweet tooth and there was nothing else in the house. All the ingredients in this recipe are already in my cabinet so that was nice!

What a disappointment!  Although the cake baked beautifully, its consistency was very coarse.  I could have overlooked that, but it had NO taste.  If I hadn't put chocolate icing on it, it wouldn't have been worth eating.

This recipe was very disappointing.  The texture of this cake was coarse, like cornbread. The taste was okay but I was making cupcakes for a child's birthday and my kid testers didn't like them.  (I ran out of time and had to use a boxed mix.)

I used half butter and half shortening and a 9x13 pan and it came out great.  Not too sweet and a little "crumby" leaving frosting to be the star.

This cake is WONDERFUL!  I made it for my son's 4th birthday party and everyone LOVED it. It's a very simple cake to make. I used butter flavored Crisco instead of plain.   It rose perfectly and was moist and delicious.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

Sorry to say but did not enjoy this cake, it baked up really nice, did not stick to the pan and was and was moist. I guess the problem if found was it tasted more like a bread then a cake.Sorry but will not make again.

I made it into about 36 cupcakes, and added a 12oz bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter before baking. They added a nice sweet touch to the cake, which isn't overwhelmingly sweet on its own. I can't wait to try this recipe as a layer cake.

My guy and I enjoyed this with a white mountain frosting. It was moist and tasty and we both likened the texture to a very light cornbread. Not quite what I expected, but good nontheless.

A good recipe.  When it cools it becomes very heavy-almost like a pound cake.  Would be a good basis for strawberry shortcake-- not an ideal birthday cake with traditional frostings--- its too heavy.

I made this recipe into cupcakes for my son's second birthday party.  I was looking for a recipe that wouldn't be too sweet so the kids wouldn't climb the walls, and this was a hit.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I personally wasn't a big fan of it:  it had too strong a flavor for a plain cake.  But even my in-laws (who do everything from scratch and prefer yellow cake over chocolate) raved about how good this was.  So if you aren't sure about yellow cakes because you prefer chocolate (like me!), definitely give this a try!

Easy to bake, turns out moist and delicious.  Especially good when iced with a chocolate icing with a bit of orange zest in it.
