Quick and easy recipe with big flavour. I had to leave out the cayenne because we have a heat wimp in the house. I have to admit I was doubting that 5 minutes would be long enough to marinate but that was all the time I had so that's how long it sat. Surprise! It was awesome! This is going into our summer rotation. Thanks kaid711!

This was a really wonderful and flavorful preparation for grilled shrimp!  I marinated this for about 1 1/2 hours and prepared as written.  Only tweak I'll make next time is a little less oil, really only needs one, two tablespoons max.  Great grillining recipe, thanks for sharing with AR!

Really loved these. Recipe was bang on, flavour was amazing.  I marinaded them for 1 1/2 hours and cooked as directed. I didn't make any changes, they are wonderful as written.

This is an excellent marinate! I placed skewered prawns on a plate and brushed both sides with the marinate five minutes before they were barbecued.  The prawns had a beautifully subtle flavor of the marinate and it was not overpowering.  However, just like Volleyballmom, I also have a Heat Wimp in the house so only added half the cayenne and pepper flakes.  But my Wimp didn't even notice the heat!  So next time, I'll add the entire amounts!  Thanks Kaid711 for this wonderful recipe!

Definitely a keeper. I used 1/2 t. of ground ginger instead of fresh. Loved the kick!
