I have done this cake twice. First time following the instructions to the letter and the result was OK, not great. The second time around I reduced flour quantity by half a cup and baked it for a little over 50 min and it was just fantastic. I was so proud of myself for baking such a delicious cake. I highly recommend it.

Great! but If I hadnt made these changes I think it might have turned out dry:
1. use 3 cups flour (I used normal all purpose flour)
2. Mix differently: First cream butter and sugar together. Beat in eggs one at a time, add vanilla. Then add the premixed dry ingredients SIFTED to the batter alternating with the milk (1/3 flour mixture - 1/3 milk ending with milk) When you put in the cocoa to the 2 1/2 cups of batter SIFT THE COCOA
I used salted butter and omitted the extra salt. Also, I used the whisk advise to creat a marbled effect. I put 3/4 of the chocolate batter, then all the white batter and then spooned in the rest of the chocolate batter and spreaded with a knife, then stuck in the whisk all around the cake. Perfect!
Glazed with easy chocolate bundt cake glaze from this site
NOTE: this is a dense but moist cake making these adjustments. You WILL need a glass of milk!
I am giving this 5 stars ONLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT WITH THESE CHANGES ITS WORTH A TRY, AND TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO TRY IT! if I were to rate this recipe as is i wouldnt be able to because I didnt follow directions because in my book ingredients arent mixed that way and im not going to risk my ingredients
Update: ok, so a day has past and this cake is definetly a 5. it is still moist. its covered only with plastic wrap. forgot to say i glazed this with a glaze found on this site: 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 1 (14 ounce) sweetened condensed milk. heat on medium heat stirring constantly until chocolate

The look was fantasctic, but the taste was not to die for, next time, I would cut down the amount of flour to 2 3/4  cups only, because the flour ratio is big comparing to the  to the other ingredients ratio.
 Just cut down the flour, and you canâ€™t go wrong with it.

Very nice pound cake with just the right amount of sweetness.  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 9x5 inch glass baking dish.  I creamed the butter and sugar together, then added the eggs and vanilla (2 tsp.).  I cut the cake flour down to 1 and 1/2 cups and mixed the dry ingredients together then added that to the creamed mixture alternately with the milk, starting and ending with the flour.  I then removend part of the batter and added the cocoa and twisted the layers to obtain the marlbed effect.

Used regular flour less 2 Tbsp per cup.  Easy to use recipe.  Nice texture and flavor, not at all dry.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and decreased the amount of flour.  I also reduced the bake time from a full hour to just 50 minutes.  I was glad to have the tips ahead of time because they seemed to be just the ticket to a moist cake.  My only complaints are that I have quite a sweet tooth and I would have liked the cake to be just a little more sugary.  (I was looking to recreate something akin to Starbucks' marble loaf.)  The other thing was the order of the ingredients being added was a little odd to me.  The flour was the third ingredient and it made the batter like a thick cookie dough until I got the milk added.  I may change the order in which I add them the next time I make it.  Overall, it was good and I'll try it again someday.

Really really good, everyone LOVED it.  
Following others suggestions, I just did 3 1/4 cups of flour, (and we're high altitude, 7800 ft) and then added a TBSP of milk to the choclate mixture when I added the cocoa, baked for 50 minutes exactly and it came out wonderfully moist and deliccious. We sliced it and had it with strawberries, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream~ it was lovely. The kids delared this "version" of strawberry shortcake THE BOMB. It was a great mix of not too chocolately or sweet, but satified all those together.  Mmmmm

Thank you for this great recipe, I will make it often!

Loved this cake!  It's exactly what I've been looking for.  Since others had posted that they thought it was a bit dry, I cooked it 5 minutes less than the recipe said and made sure my oven was just slightly on the under side of the temp. listed.  It was not dry and didn't last long at my house!

Incredibly easy, beautiful, moist, and tasty! I baked this in a 9x13 for 35 minutes. Would have been great with chocolate buttercream frosting, but frosting is so not necessary. Will DEFINITELY make again

I have never ever written a review here but i am so happy with how my cake turned out. I come from germany where "Mamor kuchen" is very popular and this is just like the one my family back home makes it! Just make sure you use 3 cups of flour NOT 3 1/2!!! First cream your butter and sugar, then add the eggs one by one. Then add flour/milk in little portions. What i also did was use nesquik chocolate powder instead of unsweetend cocoa (thats what we do in germany) and added 2 tbs of nutella. This cake was SO moist! This is def a family favorite from now on!

I made this cake for an auction at my church fete. Needless to say, this cake was splendidly-wonderful. (I cut the flour to 3cups - coz the proportion seemed rather huge compared to the other ingredients - and the sugar to 1 2/3 cups)I didn't agree with the method stated in the recipe for mixing the ingredients. And so, I creamed the butter and sugar well (until light and fluffy), added egg one by one and beat well after each addition, then added vanilla, and added the sifted dry ingredients alternately with milk, and used the electric mixer to mix well. After removing 2 1/2 cups of the batter, I added the sifted cocoa. I missed the part that said whisk in the cocoa, and used the mixer to mix it in. Luckily it was on low and let to beat for less than a minute. I used a 9" square pan. Poured the cocoa batter first. Then the vanilla one. And covered completely with remaining cocoa batter. I used a spoon to give twists and thus marble it. This took me 45 minutes to bake. Once cooled, I glazed with 'Satiny Chocolate Glaze' (recipe on this site). Fantastic combo! Although I bet the cake would be just as delish even without the glaze! :D

As written this recipe would produce a dry cake, normally cake recipe proportions are 1 part fat, 2 parts sugar and 3 parts flour, so I reduced the flour to 3 cups. I also remember my grandmother whisking the cocoa with equal amounts of hot water when she made her marble cakes, I used 1/4 cup of hot coffee. I used some fat free sour cream I needed to use for the milk, I topped it up to 1 cup with skim milk, I needed to add more milk to the batter as it was still too thick.  I increased the vanilla to 1 tbsp as well. I checked mine at 45 minutes, I had few crumbs on the toothpick, I turned off the oven but let the cake sit for 10 more minutes and it was perfect. I used Baker's Joy spray and the cake slipped out of the pan perfectly. This brought back wonderful memories of my grandmother's house on Sunday afternoons.
1/2 recipe bakes in a 9x9 pan in 25 minutes.

Like many others, the recipe AS WRITTEN DID NOT WORK for me. It came out dense to the point of tough; dry, and not edible to the kids. I tried it a second time, following the many excellent suggestions to reduce flour, change sequence of preparation, etc. The result was dense and MOIST and quite tasty. Here's what I changed: **Flour reduced to 3cups. **Baking powder increased to 2tsp. **Doubled the vanilla increased cocoa powder to 1/3 cup of more. **also used brown sugar instead of white, cause that's what I had. **Whipped butter then sugar for a long while. **Added eggs one at a time, beating til smooth each time. **Added flour-mix and milk in alternating thirds, mixing just enough to blend. I checked for doneness long before the stated time, and removed as needed.

I halved the recipe, and I also used 1/4 cup less sugar (instead of 1 cup). I put in a lot of baking powder, so it really rose nicely. It was really good. My family really liked it. I also used a loaf pan, cause I don't have a tube cake pan. I like how it got crusty around the edges. Parents said it tasted better than the pound cakes from the store :) 
Thumbs way up!

I've made this recipe before and I'm currently baking my brother's wedding cake using it.  You must must must cut the flour by 1/2-2/3 of a cup or else it will be DRY!  Also, cream your butter and sugar first, then add the eggs (1 at a time) and vanilla.  Alternate the mixed dry ingredients (sifted) and the milk and you can't go wrong.  This cake is dense but it's so moist.  The wedding cake I'm making is 4 tiers high and it's the perfect density for stacking!

I followed the original recipe and it turned out to be too dry.  Too much flour. Then I read the reviews and realised that indeed the flour should be reduced.  If the flour amount is correct, it would be a good recipe.

Followed the recipe to a T. Its a good, pretty cake thats easy to make. It keeps for DAYS as well but dried out a bit. however, if you want to infuse some extra moisture into it, dampen a paper towel, wrap a piece of the cake into it and nuke it for a couple of secions. great cake!

Delicious! This recipe got rave reviews at home and the office.  I used it as a basic pound cake and left out the marbling since I didn't have any cocoa powder on hand.  
It was amazing!  Tasty and rich, sweet but not overpowering. My roommate who rarely craves sweets loved it. We ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

Some tips:  I used whole milk because I had boughten it by mistake and I think it went a along way in keeping the cake moist.  Also,  50 minutes was enough baking time in my oven.  Watch it toward the end as too much time in the oven may cause the center to fall in. (Still very edible though!)

Like others, I reduced the flour to 3 cups and baked mine 50 minutes.  I didn't bother measuring the batter I added the cocoa to.  I just put a little less than half in a bowl, added the cocoa, poured about half the remaining yellow batter in the bottom of the tube pan, then the chocolate, then the rest of the yellow.  Then took a case knife and made a bunch of circles for the swirl.  This is the kind of cake that will go in one setting at my table - moist, tender, so delicious you are picking up the crumbs with your fork!  Never had a better marble cake - thanks for the great recipe!

I decreased the flour to 3 cups as others recommended. I split the batter between two bread loaf pans and that worked perfectly.   The recipe is what I was looking for - sweet but not TOO sweet. If you have a huge sweet tooth this probably won't do it for you.

A very good basic recipe. Some modifications were needed to make this a moister and wonderful textured cake.  I agree that reducing the flour by half a cup worked well.  I mixed it a bit different also.  Creamed butter and sugar, added eggs one at a time and then added one tsp. vanilla and one tsp. almond extract.  Added milk alternately with the mix of flour, salt and baking powder.  Turned our great.

Adjusted the recipe to 2.75 cups following suggestions from before and the cake texture is awesome. Fine and melts in the mouth. My family couldn't stop eating it.

Yup, cut down to 3 cups flour and bake for 50 minutes. I added 2 tsp instant coffee dissolved in 1 Tbs hot water to the chocolate portion and I upped the vanilla to 1 Tbs in the whole batter to ensure the vanilla portion had strong vanilla flavor. Will definitely make again!

I followed other people's suggestions and cut back on the flour and only used 2 and 3/4 cups..everything else was the same. It tastes great!! I really didnt expect it to taste so good but mann was it yummy...everyone loved it and its already half gone. I had extra chocolate batter b/c i didnt divide it evenly so i baked it in a smaller pan. My dad who will not TOUCH chocolate ate the whole thing!! Try it..it is sooo good!! BTW - to get a good swirl effect going..alternatively spoon the batter in the pan in a sort of checkerboard pattern...and you dont have to swirl it using a spoon or anything...itll bake up fine.

I followed many of the other reviews tips and lessened the flour (3 cups, minus 2 tbs per cup of all purpose flour). I also added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to my cake, sooo good!  Baked for 50 min in a bundt pan, cake was moist and perfect with some powdered sugar on top!

Marble cake is one of my husband's favorites, but though I've tried many recipes, I've had a hard time finding what we consider the perfect texture - flavorful, somewhat dense, and moist. Well, this is it! As others said, cut the flour to 3 c. and the baking time to 50 minutes. I also used a bit more cocoa. Perfect!

I have a wonderful pound cake recipe, but I was looking for something different. The chocolate swirl sounded good. It was ok, but it did not have the consistency of pound cake. This cake is very spongy and light! Pound cake should be heavier.

I bake a lot of cakes, and I will be using this recipe again. As others suggested, I reduced the flour by about 1/2 cup. It turned out moist and delicious. I also used 2 8" pans instead of a tube pan and reduced the time. Beautiful!

I didn't follow the recipe instructions, which weren't specific enough. I put the sugar in the blender for 20sec to turn it into superfine sugar, so it would dissolve more readily into the batter. Then, I creamed the butter for 3mins, added the superfine sugar and beat for another 3mins, added eggs and beat until smooth and fluffy, about 2mins. Then I sifted the dry ingredients except cocoa together, and added to the batter alternating between the flour mixture and the milk. At this point, I was using a spatula to fold the ingredients in. After taking some batter out for the choco part, I also sifted the cocoa powder to get rid of lumps. Not sure how it would have turned out if I wasn't so fussy about mixing, but mine seemed fine. Also used both almond and vanilla extracts. I also reduced flour, and a bit of sugar. It still seems a bit dry. My mom liked how it was nice and crusty around the edges fresh out of the oven though. Well, let's see how its like tomorrow. UPDATE: Blergh. It's too dry... I like my old marbled yogurt loaf recipe better.

This is a very good everyday pound cake with simple ingredients.  Followed the recipe to a "T" with no substitutions or omissions.  Because cocoa chemically drys out baked goods you REALLY need to stay on to of the baking time and take it out at the first signs that it is done.  For those who want to ensure moist cake I might also advise to cover immediately and let the cake stay covered until cool.  If you wnat something basic this is worth a try.  Play around a little as well with the extracts (almond extract might really spice up this cake).

Made a loaf for the first time yesterday.  I was all gone today so I had to make another loaf. I took suggestions with using less flour, 1/2 tsp cinnamon,  1/4 tsp nut meg, use 1 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and use Starbuck cocoa powder (since that's all I got). It came out perfectly moist and not too sweet.

I followed the recipe exactly and in my household everyone was hiding it just to get another piece! It was gone in 2 days! The only thing i changed is that i used a bunt pan to bake the cake. It turned out to have a crisp outside and a moist inside.

I can't give it 5 stars b/c I had to do some changes. After reading nearly ALL reviews, this is a summary of what I did. 

- I decreased the flour to 3 cups
- I increased the sugar to 2 cups and 1 tablespoon
- I increased the vanilla extract to 3 teaspoons
- I added 1 teaspoon of almond extract (although I think you can get away with only 1/2 tsp)
- Mixing order: I creamed butter and sugar, then added the eggs (one by one ), then I added the vanilla extract. After this, I added the dry mix alternating it with the milk (I used WHOLE milk). 
- When I separated my batter, I added the almond extract to the white batter
- I cooked at 345 degrees for 55 minutes. 
- Once I removed the cake from the oven, I immediately covered with a cloth and left it to cool
- Once it was a little bit cooler, I added a simple confectioner's sugar icing (c.sugar, milk and vanilla extract). 

With these changes, the cake was moist (still moist 24 hrs later) and it was delicious. Next time, I might add some coffee to oomph the chocolate flavor.

I am hesitant to give this 4 stars, but I didn't completely follow the recipe.  I used vanilla soy milk instead of milk because it's what I had in the fridge.  I followed someone else's suggestion of how to blend the ingredients in order.  I added a little coffee liquor to the portion of batter with cocoa powder, but didn't really taste the coffee at all afterward, I only added about two splashes.  I also added strawberries to the white part of the batter.  I had about 1/3 of a bag of frozen strawberries, heated them up with a little butter in a double boiler then put them in the food processor to turn them into liquid.  I was imagining this would turn the white to a brilliant red color but really it was slightly pink, but the flavor it added I felt was really needed.  My friend said the cake tasted great, I thought it could have used even more strawberries and found it a bit boring but nice and moist.  I used 3 1/4 cups flour even with the extra liquid from the strawberries because I wanted to make sure it was moist.

I followed the advice to decrease flour to 3 cups. I added in a few drops of almond extract into the white batter, and into the chocolate batter added a handful of melted chocolate chips and 2 heaping tbsp. of Nutella(!). Great recipe.

This is a great recipe but I think it's too sweet for me.
I used only 2.5 cups flour and it's fine.  Next time, I'll reduce sugar to 1.5 cups.

LOVE this recipe! Especially if I'm making a cake that needs to be carved! As others suggested, I cut the flour to 3 cups. I would HIGHLY recommend watching it closing for baking time as it only took 30 mins in my 9x13 and then it started to get dark.

I've been a member for years.  Thought I should sign up to tell you all that this is not at all a cake that tastes like a "pound cake."  I was expecting a dense, rich, sweet cake.  This is more of a angel food cake.  So if the the name is changed to "Marble Swirl Angel Food Cake" then maybe the ratings would be higher.  However, if you're looking for a sweet, Starbucks tasting marble cake..look elsewhere.

Perfection! This is my new favorite marble cake. I followed others suggestions of using only 3 cups of flour and I substituted canola oil for the butter. Next time I will try it with 1/2 applesauce.

This was very easy to make and I definitely recommend following katieluvs2bake's suggestions on how to mix the ingredients (find her review from 2008).  If you layer and twist the 2 colors it turns out lovely in a bundt pan.  Will make again.

It came out rather dry and was not sweet enough, in my opinion. I may try to alter the recipe, but more than likely I will just try a different one next time.

I came across this recipe last night and decided to give it a try. I was a bit hesitant because all the reviews said they changed it in some way. So I decided to make a few alterations myself: I replaced the 1 cup of butter with 1/2 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of apple sauce. I replaced the 2 cups of white sugar for 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I used 3 cups of whole wheat flour. Left out the salt. Everything else remained the same as the original. First, I creamed the oil, applesauce and sugars together. Then I added eggs in one at a time, followed by vanilla extract. In a separate bowl sift together flour and baking powder. Alternatively add in flour mixture and milk, 1/3 at a time. Mix together. Remove 2 1/2 cups batter and separately add in the cocoa powder. Butter and flour the pan you'll be using. Add in 3/4 of the chocolate batter, top with all the white batter, and then spoon in the remaining chocolate batter and spread with a knife. Use a whisk to mix batter and give it marbled effect. Bake for 60 minutes at 350F. ENJOY WITH A CUP OF MILK! :) Using this variation, it'll come out healthier and not as sweet!

This pound cake is excellent.  I followed the suggestions of others and used less flour and it turned out perfect.  I also used a recipe for chocolate icing found on this website.  I drizzled it over the cake - YUMMY!  I DEFINTELY WILL MAKE THIS CAKE AGAIN.

Like the most recent post, I took the advice of others and decreased the amount of flour. My family thought it was very tasty and it will definately become a "to keep" recipe ;) The only thing different was that my cake took at least an hour and a half to bake!

Wonderful Cake! I took the advice of many & decreased the amount of flour by a half a cup and only cooked it for 50 minutes and it was a hit! Used it for my cake business & the customers were very pleased!

I, also found this cake too dry. Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews until I had already mixed it up, but I still had time to add an extra egg, probably about another 1/2 c. milk, and about 1/4 sugar to the chocolate half. Didn't make a difference, it was still dry. If I try this recipe again, I would definitely cut the flour down, at least 1/2 cup less than suggested. Disappointing for a pound cake with so many eggs in it to still be dry.

I wanted to use up some cake flour, and decided on this recipe.  The batter was better than the cake.  The finished product was a bit dry even with the decreased amount of flour.  Average at best.

It's ok. I have tasted better from the store. Took longer in my oven but I think it's because I used a pampered chef ceramic loaf pan. I used less flour and added water to the cocoa batter, because it was like cookie dough! I probably should have used more vanilla or maybe some imitation rum to make it more fragrant. I think I might play with this one once more. Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of this cake was pretty good, but my swirl didn't turn out very pretty ... I think that if I try it again, I won't swirl, I'll just pour the chocolate on top.

Has great flavor.  I didn't know what a tube pan was so I tried putting it in a bread pan but there was too much batter so I ended up putting 1/4 of the batter in one bread pan and the other 3/4 in another bread pan and kept and eye on it in the oven for doneness.  I later found out that a tube pan is a bunt pan.

This was absolutely fantastic. So moist and silky smooth. I think one of the problems other users were experiencing with the flour being too great an amount is probably due to it being measured by volume rather than weight. Make sure you scoop your flour into your measuring cup and then level off rather than scooping with your measuring cup. I recommend putting it in a bowl and whisking it, then scooping it back into the measuring cup and leveling off again. You'll probably find you have way more flour than you need. All that extra flour would have ended up in your cake. If you only have AP flour, whisk 3 cups plus 1 tbsp of APF with 7 tbsp of corn starch to sub for cake flour.

I made this cake for my uncle's birthday. It's good and very moist. I made two 10" rounds and two 5" rounds and I barely had enough batter after doubling it. I would highly recommend! It tastes really good, looked really professional and was super easy.

I followed the recipe perfect! It was dry and I think it calls for too much cocoa powder and not enough butter. Don't make this unless you make a lot of changes. I think a whole star is too much. If I could do a half A star I would.

I've done this cake twice also, one time for my fiancee's birthday where my 2 little brothers (7 and 6) ate the cake in cupcake form without even needing buttercream! My mom also loved them so I ended up making them again for her birthday today and everyone still loves it. This will definitely be on my recipe box.

I reduced the flour and used cake flour as suggested and in the recipe but the cake was not sweet enough as some mentioned.  It was light but bland.  The chocolate part tasted little of chocolate.  I think that to make a real. chocolate cake you have to use semisweet baking chocolate.   Very disappointed and will not make again.

I made this the first time two weeks ago but tweaked it a little. I was looking for a chocolate pound cake so I adapted this receive. I used an additional 1/4 cup of cocoa, I sub. 1tble spoon of vanilla (instead of 2tsp-what can I say we like flavor enhanced.) I also used strong unsweetened  tea (loose leaf brewed-black-too lazy to waste/make a cup of coffee just for the cake) to the mix to bring out the cocoa. 
I added a ganoche adapted drizzle to the top using 1 tble spoon of sugar, milk, butter and chocolate chips. This was a "Chopped"/Paula Dean inspired experiment. 
(PS I only use real butter in stead of the chemical rich sub).

 Results-family loved it. I was gone in two days. My teen recently passed up the offer of one of those really rich chocolate cakes at the bakery while shopping yesterday, opting instead to ask me to make this again. I almost fell over there in the store (she is a very finicky eater). We loved it but adapted. I imagine the base recipe is very good that is what I worked off of.

Just okay.  I reduced the flour to 3 cups, glad I did or it would have been dry.  Doesn't have much flavor at all.  Hoping for something like the starbucks marble cake, not nearly as good.

Turned out well and was delightfully easy! I used a 9X13 rectangular pan and cut the flour as other reviewers had suggested. I will make this again.

Cake was a little dry but seemed to get better over a couple of days. I will reduce the flour a little more and  will probably add a cup of sour cream or yoghurt next time.  My son wants it again for his birthday cake and everyone enjoyed it so it is definitely a good cake!

Followed reviewers advise and decreased the flour.

I found the cake not dense enough to be a pound cake. it was more like the texture of a sponge cake. Still yum tho :)

Really good cake.  4 stars because i had to follow the suggestion and reduce the flour and add the ingredients in a different order.  I also added a 1/4 cup less sugar for my mom who doesn't like super sweet desserts.  Next time I think i'll make it even less sweet.

Cake flour has a smaller gluten content than bread or all-purpose flour, so if you are not using cake flour than you will have to reduce the amount of flour in the recipe.  I used 3 cups bread flour and it was still a little on the dry side, but it wasn't dry to the point of crumbling apart, and after icing it it was fine.  The second time I used 2+3/4 cups and the texture was perfect without a full layer of icing.

I took the popular advice and used only 2 3/4 cups flour and baked about 50 minutes. And yet, it was still a little dry. The flavor was nice, but I think this recipe could have used more eggs and maybe even less flour. If I make it again, I might be adventurous enough to experiment with 2 1/4 cups flour. We'll see.

Oh, I really hate to give this recipe such a bad rating but it was really awful! It is extremely dry and the outside got crunchy-I was very disappointed in how it turned out. I am wondering if perhaps using oil or even applesauce in place of some of the butter might help. Atleast my kids like it and maybe it will be better today. I may try this recipe again with the applesauce or oil later on...

Delicious! I used Coffee flavouring instead of vanilla, and added that part after it was seperated - so it was a real Mocha Treat!

A very delicious cake.  I used 1/2 a cup less sugar and it turned out wonderfully.  So easy to make!  I think that I did overcook it, though, because it is a tiny bit dry.  I think next time I will cook it on the convection setting of my oven and monitor the time more closely.

Important not to overbake it though, it becomes dry then.
Nice to serve with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.

This cake totally did not work for me.  It turned out very dry, I ended up throwing half of it away.  It was very hard to mix, my electric mixer almost broke while I was trying to mix it.  And, it took an hour longer than the recipe said to bake.

I made this cake had very good results. I did use allpurpose flour. When using API flour,  take out 2 Tablespoons from each cup and add 2 Tablespoons corn starch. It came out perfect and is very tasty.  It is not real sweet, the cocoa takes away so much sweetness. I will make again. Myra

If it tastes half as good as it smelled when mixing and baking, it'll be a winner. It was easy to mix and I can't wait for it to be cool enough to cut!

It was too dry. Will do it again and most likely take away half cup of flour.

Followed recipe exactly and baked for 53 minutes. Came out moist but I found the flavor lacking. Could this be from too much flour like everyone is saying?

I changed it to the 3 cups of flour after reading the reviews and it came out just fine. It wasn't very chocolaty though so I think next time I would put a bit more cocoa powder in.  Also remove the cake immediately!!!!  Don't wait!! I waited and then I couldn't get it out so I read up on line and found that you should not wait before trying to get it out. Next time...and now I better see if I can make a nice chocolate glaze to keep it put together. :(

I do love this cake.  It has a great flavor.  In fact, this cake, topped with fresh whipped cream, is one of my favorite summer desserts.  It just isn't quite the crumb I would expect in a pound cake, hence my rating it 4 stars

I followed the instructions given by the reviewers and put a bit lesser than 3 cups of flour with more than 2 cups of sugar and got a moist dense marmor cake. I would have given it 4 if the ingredients were a bit more accurate. 
it was nice, my husband enjoyed it but i would try to make it next time with my own twist.

I found the cake to taste more like bread than cake, but it was still very good. I made it for my friends, and they all liked it! I topped it with vanilla glaze, made following another allrecipes recipe. The the thick, bready cake plus the sweet glaze made a perfect combination. I reduced the amount of cake flour to 3 cups due to the advice of the other reviewers. The only thing that went wrong was parts of the cake crumbled and fell apart when it was taken out of the pan. This was likely because I forgot to grease the sides of the pan. Remember to grease!!

If I could, I would give this 3 1/2 out of 5 stars for the recipe as is.  But the first time I made it I did read the reviews and made adjustments.  I used cake flour and decreased it to only 3 cups and used a tab bit more cocoa powder than the recipe called for.  I didn't do so well with making the marble effects when mixing, so it turned out to have sort of a chocolate center.  All in all the cake tasted pretty good and I would suggest it to others and make again.

As per the reviews, I cut the flour to 3 cups. I also added 2 tsp milk to the chocolate mixture. Baked for 55 minutes. 
Still, it was dry to the point of crumbling. Also, the chocolate part was not chocolatey enough. If I try this again, I will use melted chocolate instead of cocoa, and cut the flour even more.

First time making this cake.  Next time I will use only 3 cups of flour, it was a little dry.  Also, I like to add a little almond extract to my cakes. I like the idea they tell exactly how much batter to use for the chocolate.  No guessing.

Kids loved making and eating this cake.  Did follow the recommendations of another review as far as cutting flour back to 3 cups and sifting all of the ingredients.  The cake is moist and lovely with a chocolate glaze.  Will definitely make again.

This is a very good recipe. Like the other reviews said, it is dry. I agree and what I did to fix it was instead of 3 1/2 cups flour I did 3 cups. I added one tablespoon of milk and baked it for 50 minutes. It turned out really good.

I followed some readers instructions and cut the amount of flour, which I think helped because it was moist and not dry. It is very dense though, but everyone still really liked it. I would make it again but I had made it for a birthday cake which I would prefer something fluffier for a birthday cake. But this is a great cake to make to go with coffee or tea.

Made this recipe yesterday. After reading other reviews, I decreased the amount of flour to 2 3/4 cups, and I also decreased the cooking time to 45 minutes because my oven tends to cook hotter than most. Otherwise, I followed directions exactly as written. The first problem I had was that the cake would not release from the bundt pan, even though it had been thoroughly greased and even after following directions for cooling. I tried to use a plastic spatula to help the cake release, but it was stuck to the top of the pan and ended up tearing when it came out. Regardless, I figured it would probably taste good, even if it wasn't pretty, but the cake is just ok. The chocolate flavor really doesn't come through, and even though I decreased the amount of flour, it came out very dry. Definitely need a glass of milk to drink with it. I think the recipe could call for some oil to make the cake the cake more moist, and I think next time I might substitute baking chocolate for the cocoa powder.

I always bake and followed these directions exactly, however it was way to dry and thick to the point that it wouldn't even bake fully after an hour and 20 minutes.

Oh my goodness, these were so easy and so good!  I used all purpose flour, reducing the amount by half a cup.  I increased the cocoa to 1/3 cup because I like my chocolate cake.  Instead of swirling, I layered the batters on top of one another.  The more alternating layers you make, the more swirl effect you will get.  Not one cupcake was the same.  The cake was moist and delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought that this Pound cake was delicious, not too sweet and great with a cup of coffee. I also used 3 cups of flour as someone suggested. I made this in two pre-sprayed loafs and it came out great. I will make this again for sure.

It's a nice starting off recipe but as others have mentioned, it is dry unless you make some adjustments. 
My changes:

Increased eggs to 5
increased sugar to 3 cups
to the chocolate batter, I add a heaping TBS and a half of mayonnaise - just like the commercial.  I also squirt in a little Hershey's syrup.  It's a big hit.

I bake it at 300 for about an hour and 15 minutes.

I made this cake for my bf's birthday, but it didn't come out too great.  Even after I reduced the flour to 3cups, as others had suggested and only baked it for 50min, it was still very dense and dry.  I was hoping for a moist cake, but this was dry.  I don't know if it's because I used all purpose flour, but maybe next time i'll add some oil and reduce the flour some more.
