This was excellent!  Used "soft" silken tofu and a low fat granola pie crust and reduced salt to 1/4 tsp but left everything else the same.  Why would you want the eggs and dairy in a pumpkin pie when it can taste this good!  Great recipe!

Updated review: On the first day, this was edible, but not that great. The second day, however, this pie tasted very good! Definitely make this a day ahead of time to let the flavor improve!!
I do not have a blender, so I used a hand mixer, which I do NOT recommend if you're sharing this with others, simply because of the lack of visual appeal (it looked completely disgusting with beige chunks). I'm not vegan, and I do think regular pumpkin pie is better. I still might make this again, though, since it's so healthy and simple.

Very, very good! I made this for the first time this year for Thanksgiving (made the day before). It was very creamy, & no one knew it was made with tofu! (except for my mother - I made the recipe for her)  No one else questioned that it tasted "different". However, the reason I gave it 4 stars & not 5 is because 1) both my mother & I thought it needed more of a real "pumpkin" flavor and 2)everyone noticed that the clove taste was a little strong. I think the next time I make it I'll use pumpkin pie spice instead and maybe a little extra pumpkin as well. Otherwise, I would absolutely recommend it to serve to anyone who can't have dairy. I'll be making it again.

This pumpkin pie is fantastic and easy to make.  People don't know they are eating tofu.  I give this recipe 5 stars!!!! Not only does it taste good but high in protein and fiber.

love this stuff! I used graham cracker crust last time I made it and while that sounds different it still turned out great. I only used cinnamon as that was all I had and it still came out wonderful. If you are finding this bland, you are not adding enough spice and sugar with the all important dash of salt. Also, VERY important to use SOFT not firm tofu, or it will have a weird texture, along with a very good food processor.

I made this exactly as written. I loved it! It set well and I thought the spices were perfect. I think this will be my go-to pumpkin pie recipe. Thanks for submitting Christopher!

This is so bland.  It needs way more spices.  I even added pumpkin pie spice.  This was a waste.  Sorry.  This is my first bad review.

You can definitely trick people into thinking this is the real thing. You can sub all the sugar for Splenda without anyone knowing. Double the spices. I served this with a bakery made fudge cake and the tofu pie was the sure winner.

We recently switched to a vegan diet, and I've been looking for good low-fat vegan desserts. This one I will make again. My husband loved it and my grandson gobbled up 2 pieces. Thanks for the recipe Christopher!

Followed recipe exactly as shown and it wouldn't set. After baking for nearly double the suggested time the crust burnt so I had to take it out of the oven. It was still like liquid. Needless to say I couldn't eat it.

If I hadn't made this pie myself, I don't think I would have guessed it had tofu in it!  It was creamy and delicious.  I couldn't find a 10.5-oz package of tofu, and I used one that was 12.3-oz.  It worked fine.  I left out the salt as we are on a low-sodium diet, and I used a store-bought deep-dish 9" crust.  Exactly right!  Thanks so much for this great pie.

This is good if you are craving pumpkin pie but can't eat the real thing. Nothing tops the real thing. I found this to taste a little too much like tofu. Even under all the spices. The texture is more like pudding than the firmness of pie.

I also want to add something: I noticed someone's pie was really dark. Before you put it in the oven to bake, make a hood out of foil for your pie. It will protect it from getting scorched on the top. :)

I'm getting my wisdom teeth out tomorrow and can't eat solid foods for a week.  I was looking for a recipe that wouldn't be too unpalatable or caloric and still was high in protein.  This fit the bill!  I used firm tofu (higher in protein), one can organic pumpkin puree, stevia instead of sugar (it's a 0 cal sweetener), and pumpkin spice.  I had to add some almond milk.  I've read it's better the second day, but I'm pleasantly surprised!  I am actually looking forward to eating it!  I divided it into four, and each serving is only 120cal, but packs a load of protein and vitamins!

I had to use firm tofu because our store was out of silken tofu. I threw everything into the Vitamix and it came out nice and smooth. I thought the pie had a distinct tofu taste-nothing whipped cream couldn't cover. I think next time I would add a bit more spice- maybe some nutmeg. I had to bake the pie 10 minutes longer then the recipe indicated. Good overall. A healthy option vs a protein bar :-)

A little runny so we had to broil it on low for ten minutes on the high rack.  We substituted pumpkin spice for cloves and 1/4 cup of coconut sugar for 1/4 cup of pure sugar.

This was the first  I tried this, it came out amazing!  My husband loved it!  No more traditional Pumpkin Pie for us.....  I used coconut sugar instead of the process sugar.  Had just the right hint of sweetness.
