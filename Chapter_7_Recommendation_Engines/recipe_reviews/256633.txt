This was so delicious! Great recipe. Cooked in a regular oven. We reduced the honey and added a little extra sriracha. I would definitely taste as you go! Cooked perfectly and topped with  green onion, cilantro, and a drizzle of sriracha.

I do not have the oven called for in this recipe but the combo of flavors made me attempt it in a regular oven. The base ingredients lend themselves easily to adjustments based on personal tastes. More or less ranch, chicken, or cheese. Even the chicken sauce can easily be heated up or toned down. 400 degree oven for 12 minutes on a parchment lined jelly roll pan worked perfect for me. Will have fun playing around with the ratios of ingredients but the recipe as is, is A+++ in our family's opinion.

I made this pizza for lunch on garlic Indian nan flatbread today it turned out really good I used mozzarella cheese and some toco cheese I had since I didn’t have any cheddar jack cheese it was very tasty, I would add more Sriracha to the honey and a little less honey to the mix since I like some spice?, I totally would make it again thanks for sharing the recipe

Like other reviewers I cut the honey in half - and that was still too sweet. To compensate I added some Sambal Oelek (Asian pepper paste). I usually follow recipes more to the recipe on the first run but since I’m not a fan of ranch dressing I subbed low fat sour cream and added spices used in ranch (onion powder, garlic, parsley, dill). I also mixed all the sauces together

This was an awesome recipe! I didn’t have the oven used so I used the directions on a Pillsbury pizza dough canister and it turned out great!

Excellent!  Another great recipe for the CIO!  Seriously, the flavors in this are wonderful- I was a little skeptical about the ranch base as that's not normally my thing but went ahead because of all of the glowing reviews and I'm glad that I did.  That honey sriracha mixture?  I could eat that with a spoon.  Seriously amazing.  I drizzled most of the extra over the top before baking and reserved a little extra for dipping.  I made chicken nuggets for my son for dinner and even made an extra one for myself just so I could dip it in that amazing sauce!  I followed the recipe exactly except I did add some sliced green onion.  Definitely a keeper!

So good!  We used a little less honey in the chicken and added a sriracha drizzle  at the end.  Perfection with green onions and cilantro added on top.

This pizza is delicious! I added more Sriracha, because I like it spicy. I also added some cilantro and green onions of top- why tasted great. It's a perfect Friday night pizza treat. (Let's be honest- I'd eat it every day if I could!)

A nice combination of flavors but a little sweet on my opinion. Next time I will reduce significantly the honey and maybe add more Sriracha sauce.

I wasn't sure how a pizza would taste using ranch as the sauce, but, it was fabulous!  The flavors worked wonderfully together!  The honey and sriracha were just the right balance for us and the ranch  was the perfect savory sauce to the sweetness and spice of the chicken.   I will definitely be making this again.

This was a really unique pizza, the flavor profile is like nothing we have had before. We enjoyed this but found it a tad sweet for our tastes.  We will cut back on the honey next time to let the spiciness of the sriracha shine.

I made my own pizza dough and then  used parchment paper because I like a really thin pizza dough.  Worked out great!  Very easy and great flavor.  We loved this.

Get out your fork and knife for this recipe! It's great to be able to make it all on pan. When making it again we are going to cut the honey in half to go for a more spicy flavor. Easy to make and everything on hand.

5 stars all the way! Hubby and I like our crust paper thin and since I am dough challenged I decided to buy a pre-made ultra thin crust. This has the perfect sweet/spicy blend and we very much enjoyed it. I loved how the Panasonic oven gave the bottom of the pizza grill marks and yet browned it perfectly on the top at the same time. This one is a keeper!

What a great idea for a pizza! This was fantastic . . . and like no pizza that we've ever had before. I loved the sweet, yet spicy flavors you get from the honey/sriracha mixture. I made half a recipe, as I was using the rest of the pizza dough for another pizza recipe. Because of this, I used the 9" pizza setting on my Panasonic countertop induction oven, rather than the 12" setting. It turned out perfect! I loved how the bottom crust had the grill marks from the grill pan, and it was nice and crispy. I will be making this again in the near future, but will be making the full recipe, for sure. Yum!
