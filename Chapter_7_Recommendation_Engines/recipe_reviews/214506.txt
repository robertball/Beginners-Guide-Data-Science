Very tasty, made it for Father's Day.  I tried using whole shrimp, but it made it very difficult to eat, so next time will use chopped as the recipe calls for.  Found new type of brie at store that is in shape of a small tube - exactly the size needed to put on a piece of french bread, and with a thinner, edible rind.  I used chili powder instead of cayenne pepper.

Perfect! I added cilantro, as was suggested.  I also used frozen mango chunks which we have at home for smoothies.  This was so good, I wanted to log-on to allrecipes to rate it before dinner was even over!  This would also be good over an arugula or watercress salad as a first course.

This is an excellent recipe. I didn't use as much cayenne as the recipe called for and I think that was better. I also added some fresh mint.  RAVE reviews from all.  I will definitely be making this one again!

Very tasty. As with everything,  I used the recipe as a guide ssnd made lots of changes. 
1- Didn't have bread, so we turned it into a pasta dish.  Melted the brie in the pasta and topped it with the 'salsa.' Cooked the shrimp in the water as it was  heating. Took them out, put the pasta in and prepared the rest while it was cooking. 
2- Cut out mango open and it was brown, so we used half frozen mango and half frozen pineapple that we had. Works just as well with pineapple, in my opinion.
