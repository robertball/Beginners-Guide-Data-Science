Big smiles with this drink! Everyone loved it and with all the different topping combos, the flavors of Baileys, chocolate, caramel and ice cream.. So good! Definitely a keeper and also tastes great with an additional shot of maple bourbon and cinnamon horchata ice cream or even cookies and cream ice cream. ;)

We have made it three times now. It's super easy to make, very versatile, and great for parties. First we made it as listed, no changes. Then with vanilla ice cream and extra chocolate sauce to replace the chocolate ice cream. My favorite is using cookies and cream ice cream with vanilla ice cream instead of chocolate and going lighter on the caramel and chocolate sauce. Whipped cream with a light caramel drizzle is my go to topping. Highly recommend.  Easy and very decadent.

We both actually really liked this.    I wasn’t sure going into this recipe if I would like it.   I have never had Baileys Irish Cream before.     But, I made it as described and would do so again.   Can’t wait to try this again!

We all enjoyed this very much. If you prefer your milkshakes thick. i would add less milk. Otherwise, wonderful
