Excellent butter cream frosting! I couldn't have been more pleased.  I scaled this to 32 servings (4 cups powdered sugar) for my 9" layer cake and still wish I would have had more for decorating. I beat the butter a few minutes until fluffy, gradually added the full amount of powdered sugar called for and enough coffee until I got it to the consistency I wanted.  I beat the frosting for several more minutes after that, until it was light, creamy, fluffy and silky smooth. This is pleasantly light chocolate - not too strong, and not too sweet, with just a hint of coffee flavor.  I found the proportions of all ingredients perfect, and this will be a recipe I'll certainly be comfortable referring to again, whether I use it with the coffee or without, with the chocolate or just as a traditional vanilla buttercream.  This frosting as written, however, was the perfect choice for "Chocolate Mocha Cake I," also from this site.

Great consistency, but I found this frosting too sweet with too little flavour. I increased the coffee and cocoa to about 3 tablespoons each to increase the mocha flavour.

I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E. Delicious. I loved how light and fluffy the frosting was, easy to spread with just a light chocolate flavoring, and plenty of heavenly coffee. I did add a bit extra espresso, and instead of mixing the ingredients all together I whipped up the butter, added the cocoa and coffee, and lastly added the sugar until it was perfect for me. Almost too good to be true, it's so simple. Thank you very much for sharing.

Wow, this icing was so good! I took the advice of others and only used 1 cup of sugar and added 2 tbs of coffee. I brewed 1 cup of water and added 2 tbs of coffee grinds in the coffeemaker, which I think made the coffee strong enough for the recipe... a lot of flavor!

This is a delicious mocha icing.  I used it on Black Magic Cake and it was wonderful.  However, it does not make very much and my 9x13" cake had what I considered to be too thin a layer of icing.  I can't imagine trying to ice a layer cake with just this amount.  Next time I will double it.

This didn't have the taste of coffee enough even with a VERY strong coffee, which I used, in it...  So I applied to one of the reviews and added 2 more tablespoons of coffee! The taste came up a bit but not so much! In this recipe, I think you should be a tester in your amount of coffee added ;D!

Used this to frost mocha cupcakes, and it was perfect.  I did have to double the recipe to frost all 24 cupcakes.  It turned out light and fluffy, and definitely had a distinct coffee flavor.

This frosting came out so great that is tasted and looked like it was bought right from the bakery.  I made two 9" x 13" cakes and spread the frosting in between.  Double the amount of frosting if doing so.  EXCELLENT!

Wow! Awesome recipe! I made a lot of the recommended changes (used 1 cup of sugar, doubled the cocoa powder and coffee, and doubled the recipe) and I'm really glad I did.

If you're using this for a layer cake or a cake in a 9x13 pan, you absolutely have to double this recipe; otherwise you won't have enough.

As with most recipes, I do recommend taste testing to make sure that you're happy with the flavor. For me, the coffee flavor was perfect, but I love coffee. If you only want a hint of coffee, don't double the amount.

I started with an electric mixer, but the butter kept getting stuck in the mixer do-hickeys (wish I knew the official name). So then I switched to a wooden spoon. This requires a lot of elbow grease, but it at least prevents you from having to tap out the mixer do-hickeys after every second addition of the sugar / cocoa mix. If using an electric mixer, choose your attachments wisely.

I used this for the Black Magic Cake, also on this site, and it complemented it very well.

I have a feeling this would be an excellent compliment to any cake. I used this as the frosting on a spice cake.I used a little more coffee in it because we love coffee anything. Next time I will use more than the suggested 2 cups of confectioners since I felt the cake taste dominated the frosting and I make cakes for the dessert appeal, sweetness.
The consistancy can be changed by just popping it in the frig. Anyone can make this suit their taste. Double it you'll be glad you did.

Delicious!  I swear I could eat the whole batch of frosting right out of bowl!  It took all of my self control, but I did manage to use the frosting to top my cake (Chocolate Mocha Cake I).  Perfection!

I am using this as the frosting for Cake Balls by Allison. I followed suggestions and decreased the sugar to 1 cup. I needed a more intense flavor to use in the cake balls so I used 3T. cocoa, 3T. coffee, 3T. kahlua. Very good!

I had to add more coffee, AND instant coffee powder to give this a noticeable coffee flavor. But once I did, it was great. I used this to ice the Chocolate Mocha Cake I.

I made this frosting for a black magic cake and it turned out DIVINE.  The only thing I did differently was add a tsp of cinnamon for a little extra flavor and it was the icing on top of the cake (pun TOTALLY intended) so I definitely recommend adding that for a special surprise.  I WILL make this again.  ; )

This recipe was simple and delicious. I paid attention to some of the other comments and made a few minor adjustments.

I simply doubled the cocoa and coffee to make sure the flavor wasn't overpowered by the sweetness. 

The only issue i've run into is getting the frosting onto the cake before someone eats it all.

I only had 2 Tbsp of butter so I used shortening for the rest. I know, I know, the name is coffee BUTTER frosting, but I really wanted to make this. Also, I used 5 Tbsp of cocoa, 5 tbsp. of coffee, and some additional powdered sugar. The coffee flavor is very subtle, but the result is delicious. I put it in the refrigerator before frosting the "Simple 'N' Delicious Chocolate Cake" I made into mini cupcakes and it was perfect. Thanks Ginger!

Magic cake (from this site) and wow, that is all i can say WONDERFUL combo. Doubled the recipe because i made a 2-layer cake.

Tried this as a replacement for my usual mocha butter cream frosting.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut back the sugar to one cup and increased the coffee to 2 tbsp.  I think the coffee taste was a little too strong so wouldn't do that again.  It was a very light consistency which was nice.  I doubled the recipe and was just enough to frost my layer cake.  Not sure if I will try this again.

Best homemade frosting I've ever had!  I didn't think the recipe would make enough to frost my cake so I increased the ingredients a bit.  I used 1 stick of butter, 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 Tbsp cocoa & 3 Tbsp triple strength coffee then whipped with electric mixer.  Turned out light, fluffy & better than store bought frosting!

Great frosting, just a little too sweet for my taste. I ended up using about 2-3 tbsp. of cocoa powder and 3-4 tbsp. of the coffee for a much stronger coffee flavor (I love coffee!). Overall this was a nice base for frosting that can be easily tweaked for personal taste.

Not bad.  It had a good flavor, but was very chocolatey, I couldn't taste the coffee at all.  I'm going to play around with it to see if I can get a stronger coffee flavor, maybe leave out the chocolate completely?

Delicious. I did make changes, as I saw other reviews mention recipe might not cover my 9X13 cake and I sort of put my old family frosting recipe spin on this. I used 1 stick butter, 1 t instant espresso, 2 T strong coffee, and 2 T coco. Blended all that really well, then added maybe 1.5 to 2 C powdered sugar. Mom used to make it this way (scant milk and 1 T vanilla instead of the coffee) and she'd always mix by hand adding more sugar a little at a time to get the consistancy right. I will be making this more often, yum! Can't keep my hubby away from it.

This was an excellent frosting.  I made it as written but then had to add a bit more coffee because it was so thick (probably would not have needed more coffee if I had sifted the powdered sugar).  Made enough to frost 24 cupcakes, used the Black Magic Cake recipe and the two were great together.  Will be making again.  Thank you

Very yummy. However I used 1/4 cup less sugar and added 1 tablespoon more coffee. Added water to get it to a more spreadable consistency.

Oooo, this recipe was delightful!  I frosted some plain yellow cupcakes and all my friends LOVED it!  My only suggestion is to put a little less sugar than suggested.  I was a little skeptical about putting in 1 1/2 cups of sugar in, so I just put in 1 cup and that was just right.  Any more sugar and my teeth would've fallen off.  :)  And like a lot of reviewers have mentioned, adding a little bit more coffee gives it a better flavor.  I put in about 2 or so tablespoons.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the awesome receipe!

This was the first time I ever made my own frosting, and I loved it! I increased the sugar by about a cup, because I needed more frosting, and also added about 3 more Tbsp. coffee and a dash of vanilla. I used it on yellow cake, and sprinkled pecans on top. It was a hit!

The icing was a little to sweet and didn't taste much like the strong coffee that I added. To make it less sweet I added another tablespoon of coffee and an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder.

Wonderful base for an icing. When I first tried it it was way too thick and way to sweet but I added about a third of a cup of half and half and it helped a ton!

i tripled the recipe to ice a 2 layer sponge cake 9 inch. i reduced the sugar and made mocha paste-1 table spoon cocoa powder and 2 table spoons instant coffee mixed with 1 to 2 tablespoon lukewarm water, stir quickly to cool d paste. followed one of the reviews to add the paste with the creamed butter to make it well blended easily with the butter only then i added the powdered sugar which i sifted first so that there are no clumps. i beat it longer using my sand mixer until the color of the frosting becomes pale....ready to ice the cake.

This icing was delicious, though I added a tiny bit of extra instant coffee granules to the coffee. I wanted a stronger coffee flavor. I used this to ice the Chololate Mocha Cake I. We had friends over and they each enjoyed theirs, raving especially about the icing.

Pretty yummy, but it does need a stronger coffee flavor. I think espresso would be the best. I made it a second time using amaretto in place of coffee (2 tablespoons) and this was also quite good.

this was the PERFECT frosting for my chocolate cake!This wasnt a typical children's bday cake frosting which is always too sweet and sugary, better suited for children. This coffee frosting was light, and perfect for adults- very 'whippy'. I will definentley be making this frosting again and again!

This was great!  I used the recommended butter, 1 tablespoon coffee, 1.5 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder and I started with 1/2 cup confectioners sugar and then added little by little until it reached my desired sweetness :)  This was a huge hit at my office!  And my boyfriend loved it too!

Luscious! I will play with the coffee more, mine was not a really strong coffee flavor, mostly tasted the chocolate.  Great texture, consistency.  Great tasting, easy to make frosting!  I used this to fill and ice the sides of my "Dark chocolate overload cake."

I'm giving this three stars because I think it was too sweet.  Let me tell you, I LOVE frosting, it's my favorite part of a cake--I think whipped icing is a waste of time! :)  This was still too sweet for me.  I used VERY strong coffee (I brewed 2 cups worth with 5 tbsp coffee grounds) so the coffee flavor was prominent, but still...too sweet.  My opinion...

This is a really good frosting recipe. I used 2Tbsps of coffee and only about a cup of powdered sugar. It wasn't too sweet... was just right. I frosted a chocolate cake over which I had poured half a cup of orange juice. Was amazing..

Per others suggestions, I did reduce the sugar to 1 C. because we don't like anything too sweet.  It came out perfect. It has a delicate coffee flavor (I used strong left-over coffee). It was light and creamy and spread wonderfully; perfect for the chocolate cake.

The texture of the icing is perfect! However, it was a little too sweet and didn't have a very strong mocha flavor. As others have said, make sure to use 3 Tbsp of cocoa powder and brewed coffee instead of 1, it makes it taste a lot better.

Delicious!  I will echo other reviewers' comments.  You need to at least triple (scale to 36 servings) this recipe to have enough frosting to fill and frost a 8" layer cake.  I made very minor adjustments from there based on others' reviews. I used 4 1/4 cups of confectioner's sugar and 1/2 C cocoa.  I measured these into the large bowl, stirred them together, THEN sifted them into the smaller bowl.  Note-especially with confectioner's sugar, it makes a difference if you measure before or after sifting. Cream your butter well.  The mixture will be stiff and dry when you mix in the sugar/cocoa.  I used 3 TBSP strong brewed dark roast Starbucks  coffee to start then added by the tsp until I had a good consistency.  I ended up using about 4TSP (1/4 C) of coffee.  Once I filled the middle I decided the frosting needed to be a little fluffier but didn't want to add more coffee because I thought the flavor was perfect.  So, I used 2-3 tsp of milk until I got the fluffy consistency I wanted.  Remember the amount of liquid you will need will vary with the weather and whether you sift your sugar before or after measuring or not at all! 
This is a perfect mocha frosting,  Neither the coffee nor the chocolate predominates when you use the proportions I mentioned.  I've made it as written in the past and it is wonderful too.  As others have said, perfect on the black magic chocolate cake on this site.  Enjoy!

Fantastic recipe! Had so many compliments. I doubled the chocolate and doubled the coffee after reading reviews. I made a triple batch to go with the black magic cake recipe on this site. People thought it was gourmet. Thanks for a great recipe!

Light, fluffy, and silky smooth is just what I expect from a buttercream frosting, and this recipe delivered! I decreased the powdered sugar to 1 cup and added 1.5 T cocoa and 2 T strongly brewed coffee.  I fully expected the need to add more coffee since I prefer a prominent coffee taste, but after a quick taste test, I was pleasantly surprised to find the flavor spot on!  Since DH isn't fond of ANY frosting, I used the recipe amount for his entire 13x9" chocolate birthday cake, so there was only a thin layer, however, doubling the amount would be the way to go for a sheet cake. Kahlua would also make a fine substitute for the coffee.  I will definitely make again!

Love, love, love this recipe. My family, who is very skeptical of home-made frosting, loved it. I used it on the Chocolate Cake II recipe from here.  Just for giggles, I sprinkled dry coffee grounds over the top and it added just the special thing our little birthday cake needed.

This recipe calling for 1 1/2 C. of the sugar; still a little too sweet. Next time I will do just 1 C. sugar. I did add 4 more tablespoons of coffee though. Tastes good. It kinda tamed the sweetness a little, but I will still do it next time with 1 C.
I like it otherwise. Thank You
I can't believe some of the other butter recipes call for 4-6 cups of sugar. OMG!
Thank You for sharing :)

Thanks so much! Great easy recipe! I doubled the recipe since I was making a layered 9 inch chocolate cake. And I added more coffee b/c we are coffee lovers here and I could barely taste it in the original recipe. Also...it helped to thin it out more...my frosting was really thick initially...But turned out great and had plenty of frosting left over.

I love this recipe.  I originally found this exact same recipe in the American Woman's Cookbook published in 1938 by Consolidated Book Publishers, Inc.  For a 9 inch round layer cake, I increase each ingredient by 1.5 to have enough frosting.

so tasty and you dont even need an electric mixer! The recipe yields enough to do a thin layer over a two layer cake.

I added 4 tablespoons of coffee and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder because 1 tablespoon of flavor simply isn't enough for me, and because the coffee wasn't that strong anyway.
Turns out I added too much, because the frosting didn't end up as a frosting, it ended up being a glaze. Which isn't really a big deal because they ended up tasting AMAZING with the Cinnamon Mocha Cupcakes I made (also from this website). They had the perfect amount of coffee, and my friend LOVED the Cinnamon Mocha Cupcakes that I made for her birthday!
Will definitely make again!

This is a rich, easy to work with frosting. If you want strong flavor use 1.5  times the amount of cocoa and make the coffee very strong (doubling it will throw off the consistency). This make very little frosting - to cover the top and sides of a 9 inch round make 1.5 times the recipe, for two layers, double.

Sorry, I didn't really like this much.  WAY too sweet for my liking, almost taste like a cup of coffee that is grossly sweet.  If I were to make it again, I'd up the butter and lower the sugar.  Also - I had problems with the consistency, which may be because of where I live.  It was too dry/thick so I added more espresso and milk to make it more fluffy.  This piped well after adding the liquid, but unfortunately it didn't hit the spot for me.

Excellent frosting recipe, althought it did not have as much coffee flavor as I had hoped (and I doubled the chocolate and tripled the coffee amounts).  Next time I think I will add espresso instead of coffee.  I quadrupled the recipe for a 9 inch layer cake and did not need that much - even with decorations, I ended up with a lot of frosting left over.  I would recommend tripling the recipe for a layer cake.

Wonderful flavor! I love mocha and was so excited when I found this recipe. I did end up adding 2 T. more of cocoa and coffee based on other reviews and it really helped. Will make again!

This frosting was really delicious.  For icing a 2 layer cake, you really need to double the recipe.  We brewed some really strong coffee.  I think for this recipe, the stronger the coffee the better.

Fabulous as an alternative frosting for German Chocolate cake.  Added just a touch of vanilla extract to make the flavors pop a little more.

This was a really delicious icing.  I used it as a change to the usual buttercream icing I put on the black magic cake from the site.  I doubled the recipe, and further doubled both the cocoa powder and coffee in the recipe. It was the perfect combo of chocolate with a hint of coffee flavor.  Yum!!!

I used 2 c powdered sugar, 1/3 c butter, 2 T special dark cocoa powder and 3 T espresso. it was just barely enough to cover a double layer chocolate cake. Great taste. I think next time I'll use 3 c powdered sugar, 1/2 c butter, 4 T cocoa and 3 T espresso dissolved as much as it will dissolve in 3 T water or milk. Add milk to the right texture.

I was searching for a caramel frosting recipe for black magic cake cupcakes when I ran across this.  Checking the reviews, several of them said they couldn’t taste the coffee.  Using my Kuerig, I brewed a 4 oz cup set on strong (Dunkin Donuts if it makes a difference).  Then I boiled it down by about half in the microwave and doubled this recipe.  I was just shy of enough butter so I added a couple tablespoons of cream cheese as I was originally planning a cream cheese frosting on them.  I ended up using more powdered sugar than 3 cups due to a little extra liquid and then I kept the frosting on the “soft” side.  Not runny but thin enough to just dunk the cupcakes to frost.  I can definitely taste the coffee and this recipe is just delicious.  Thanks for posting it!

The texture was awful and it started to separate. Thankfully I saved it by adding more butter and coffee, half and half, vanilla extract and cream cheese. I scored this low because I had to significantly alter the recipe.

Great recipe, but I tripled the coffee.  And next time I will at least double the recipe.  Not enough frosting for a nine inch cake.

I doubled the recipe, also I added 1 tablespoon of finely ground hazelnut coffee. as far as the liquid coffee, I used 6 tablespoons of a really strong coffee so that I could really get that coffee flavor into the frosting, also is lightened the frostings consistency. I would say this a great recipe to tweak into your own very easily.

Read a few of the helpful reviews.  Used the tip of one of the reviewers to triple the amount of the cocoa powder and coffee.  My final feedback is that the buttercream frosting, as an individual product, it tasted a little bit too sweet for me but very rich in the “coffee” flavor, which I liked very much.  Since the frosting is already sweet, I reduced the sugar in the dark chocolate (sponge) cake I baked.  After assembling the cake, I also put salted caramel on top.  The sponge cake and caramel sauce helped lessen the sweetness of the frosting.  The cake, as a whole, was 100% perfect.

Absolutely no coffee flavor, at all.  Even though I doubled the coffee and coco powder.  Would NOT recommend this recipe unless you enjoy gritty, overly sweet, flavorless frosting.

To get the full taste of the icing with cake you need to double receipe and ice thick.. also used on a white cake.. would be much better on chocolate cake.

This recipe requires far too many adjustments to make it even remotely worthwhile. It is incredibly sweet, lacks coffee flavor and textually it is wrong for a buttercream. Don't waste your time,  there are far better recipes for coffee buttercream thst do not require any adjustments to make it delicious.  I was quite surprised that this had so many stars, but it appears most adjusted the recipe.  That means to me the recipe is inferior and should not have been awarded many stars because it's not the recipe.

Fantastic and easy recipe! I followed the other reviews and doubled the coffee in there, because I really wanted a stronger coffee flavor. I piped this onto chocolate cupcakes and dusted with some espresso powder for a final kick, and they were perfect!

I used really strong coffee and this icing turned out great.  Everyone LOVED it.  When initially beating it, it was very crumby and I got nervous it wasn't enough butter, but once I got the beater up to high speed it started to fluff up nicely.

It ended up being great, but only after significant alterations in proportions. I ended up having to add another quarter cup of margarine or so, and only used about two thirds of the cocoa-powder sugar mixture.  I do prefer my icings on the slightly less sweet side and have the tendency to alter icing recipes, but this was to a larger degree than I usually have to. I also added three tablespoons of coffee until I could taste the flavour. I think this recipe is a good starting point, but I'd go into it with the mindset that you might have to alter proportions as you go (add the sugar gradually and taste as you go). That being said, the icing I ended up with was fantastic. Perfectly sweet (or unsweet, rather) to my taste, good but not overpowering coffee flavour, and very easy to use to frost a cake. It applies very smoothly and isn't too soft so it sets well, but does not harden.

Excellent frosting. I had to add a bit more coffee (total of 4 tablespoons) to give it a stronger coffee taste. Other than that, no changes. Super easy to make.

Delicious buttercream frosting!  It has a great consistency.  I could absolutely taste the "mocha" flavor.  I honestly could've eaten a bowl full of this on its own.... and I'm not one to just eat frosting by itself....

It was great, but I agree about the flavor of coffee being to light. I substituted with half a tablespoon of coffee extract and a half tablespoon of water.  Definitely a very sweet frosting, so take that into account when you put it on something.

Excellent texture.  I had to triple the recipe to frost an 8"  Chocolate layer cake.  Doubled the cocoa, doubled the coffee, and added powdered cappuccino, as well, so I can't rate it 5 stars.  Turned out incredible with these changes though.

Fantastic  recipe.   I added essepresso instant coffee to 1 T of how watter.  It was a little light in coffee flavor and I doubled the recipe for a 9 inch two layer cake. If you like lots of icing you might want to triple.

Substuted Kahula for the Tablespoons of coffee, came out nice, tasted good, I frosted the Black Magic Cake from  this website with it, I doubled the recipe and had just enough frosting to frost one 13x9 inch cake. Very sweet though.

We absolutely loved this frosting.  I doubled the recipe to frost a 9x13 inch cake (Black Magic cake from this site, TO. DIE. FOR.).  I started off by beating the amount of butter, cocoa and coffee called for.  Then I started beating in the powdered sugar and more coffee until I got the consistency / taste I wanted. So delicious and DANGEROUS.  I will make this again, but only for special occasions because the temptation to over indulge is just too great.

Great taste. Lovely texture, spreads beautifully. Just not enough icing for a double layer cake. Need to double the recipe. Used this recipe to go with the chocolate mocha cake from this site. Made coffee stronger than what was written in both recipes and I'd say that the combination is just right! Will be making this recipe again!

VEry easy to make, the texture is really creamy, but it turned out a bit too sweet. Also, it does not yield as much as it says. I Had to make a second batch to finish icing my cake. Next time I will increase coffee/cocoa, maybe it will not taste as sweet.

Yummy! But I put a lot more coffee than the recipe asked for because the coffee flavour is delicious! I paired it with a caramel cake and it was amazing!

I just make this to go on chocolate cupcakes.  My hubby said, "Wow, that's good."  I just gave him a taste to try, we have not even put it on the cupcakes yet.  :)  I did add more coffee because I was not careful measuring the sugar.  Sooooo good.

Delicious and has a very strong coffee flavor(I did use very strong coffee) I found 3 recipes covered a 4 layer cake perfectly. Used it on Simple'N'Delicious Chocolate Cake (also on this website) and it was awesome but also rich - that might have more to do with the fact that I also drizzled quite a bit of caramel on the whole thing though. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

Great taste, great directions, great consistency for spreading.  This frosting is a winner!  This is a fabulous fluffy mocha frosting.  This does NOT have a strong flavor or either coffee or chocolate, but is a lovely nice combo of both.

Vey easy and very tasty frosting. Used it for the first time on a chocolate cake and it was really good. I don't even like coffee and I added 2TB instead of one for a really good flavor. Will use again.

First time making frosting from scratch and this was so easy and really delicious.  I made the recipe exactly as is but doubled it.  Used it to frost a bundt cake and had about a quarter cup left over. Also used very strong coffee.  Love the fluffy and spreadable consistency.  Will never go back to store-bought frosting.  Thanks for the recipe!

This icing is absolutely amazing. I use it for everything. Its easy to make and use. I use different extracts such as vanilla, butterscotch, lemon and it works out perfect every time. I changed the servings to 32 so I can ice cakes also use for piping. Also instead of just using the coffee, I use different juices to make all different flavors. By far the best recipe yet and I will not buy another store bought icing.

The only reason this doesn't get five stars is that i followed some other suggestions and added more cocoa and coffee, less sugar and about two tbsp baileys and it was perfect. Excellent with bblack magic cake also on this site. I will definitely make this again!

Foudn this recipe while trying to find one to duplicate a friend's. It didn't turn out as good as hers, must be a missing ingredient, but it was still pretty good. I doubled the recipe, without doing so there wouldn't have been enough for a 9x 13 cake, and added an extra tsp and a half each of the coffee and cocoa. I suggest tasting as you go along, adding more sugar each time until you get the desired sweetness, I ended up adding all of the suggested sugar because I like my frosting sweet! Used on a devils food chocolate box cake, and refridgerated the icing before frosting the cake. Yummy! Thanks :)

Just made this for a simple 8" round cake. Will be plenty of icing. Like others have said, be prepared to flavor to taste. I used more powdered sugar, coffee, and cocoa than the recipe called floor.

This frosting is light and airy, as well as decadent with the right modifications. For sweetness I used a little over a cup of icing sugar to reach my perfect sweetness. As others have stated, increasing the amount of coffee and cocoa powder is a must. I decided on 3 TBsps. of each. Perfect flavour! This makes a very small batch of frosting though, and I would recommend doubling it if you're planning to frost a layer cake. Pairing this with "Chocolate Mocha Cake I" from this site.

I did not care for this recipe. the flavor is nice, I followed the advice and added an extra tbsp of cocoa and coffee. The texture, however, is awful. It reminds me of a weird, fluffy mousse.

This was a good recipe - I used it as a filling between white and devil's food cake layers.  It doesn't make a lot though so you might consider doubling the recipe.  I also added 2 tablespoons of STRONG coffee to up the coffee flavor and also because I needed more moisture in mine.  Will definitely use again.

This is amazing.  You can add more coffee or cocoa to taste and thicken it with more powdered sugar if you like it thicker and not as creamy, but overall this is a wonderful basic recipe.  I did not have coffe left so I used some instant coffee crystals in water.  Be careful not to make it too strong.

I made this for Amanda's birthday cake. It was absolutely gorgeous and so very delicious. I used the cake mixes from scratch and variations on this site. I did he yellow cake. It was perfection. The only adjustment was I almost doubled the coffee in order to get a great spreading consistency. Was great on the Gob cake from this site too.

This frosting was good although it was a little bit too sweet for my taste.  I used 1/2 cup less sugar than called for and the next time that I make it I will use even less.  I think I might add a little more coffee too.  All in all a good recipe.  Thanks!

Really good. I was low on ingredients and needed to make something quick for a simple white cupcakes that needed a bit of oomph. This frosting was it, had great consistency and taste. I upped the cocoa and coffee an extra tablespoon each. Will make this one again!

Oh YES!!!  This was a HUGE hit!  I was looking for something really different and decided to try this one, even though I usually only go for the ones with 5 stars.  This is very under rated and definitely deserves the best rating!  Did only use 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and kept adding very strong expresso coffee to get the desired consistency - about 4 Tablespoons.  Even those who don't like coffee were smacking their lips on this one!  Thanks!!!

Great texture and sweet flavor especially chilled. Like other I up coffee/coca ratio.  After some experimenting I use 3.5 tbls of cocoa, 3 cups of powered sugar, stick of butter, and 4 shots of strong expresso!

This frosting was really easy to make and very delicious.  I would recommend making a double batch.  I like extra frosting and this didn't make enough for me.  I will definately use this recipe in the future.

I used it as a cake filling (using espresso) and it was really great, only a bit too sweet. Easy, fast and tasty :)

This recipe is very tasty and easy to make.  My only suggestion is to add about a teaspoon of vanilla and to double or maybe triple the recipe if you want to make a multiple layer cake with some decoration using the same frosting.

We really enjoyed it.  I added a splash of almond extract and it was great.  But it probably didn't need it!  Was really great!!

This is a wonderful and easy frosting recipe.  The second time I made it, I increased the coffee by 2 teaspoons and added 1/4 cup of finely chopped walnuts.  It is great on a butter cake!
