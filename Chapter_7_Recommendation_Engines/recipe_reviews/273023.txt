I made this as described and it was very good.  However, I would definitely use fresh potatoes next time even though buying ready made hash browns saves a lot of work. They just don't have the right consistency for good potato soup and need a good run thru the blender.....which means the ham gets chopped up too.  Then I would feel good about five stars !

I replaced the hash brown potatoes with frozen califlower rice to keep carbs in check. Although the califlower rice were not as hearty as hash brown potatoes, this slow cooker soup with the cream cheese,and sharp cheddar cheeses still tasted creamy,satisfying and delicious!

Very good!  I cooked it on High for 4 hours then added the cream cheese and Sharp cheddar cheese cooked for the 30 minutes.  I used shredded hash browns and finely chopped the celery.

Delicious. I made a few variations to the recipe. 
I used russet potatoes added more pepper, and garlic powder. Also, added carrots and corn. 
In addition to the soup I made homemade cheesy biscuits.

Great taste.  Suggest more pepper and garlic powder.  Don't worry about the cream cheese...it adds a lot of flavor, tempers the saltiness, and helps in thickening this luscious soup.  Freezes well.

This was so easy and delicious and very filling. Perfect to have on a cold winter night like tonight. I've made small adjustments: since I didn't have leftover holiday ham or deli ham, I've used a ham steak in its place. And instead of diced onion, I've used minced onion. You can barely taste the difference. I would love to make this again.

I will definitely make it again.  The celery was al dente, so next time I may soften it in the microwave.  My family and guests loved it!

The flavor was good however I like a chunkier texture for potato soup.  Cooking the hash browns for so long made for a smooth texture for the soup.

This was the best soup for leftover ham. It turned out perfect and went great with fresh sourdough bread!

I use my leftover augratin potatoes from christmas dinner to make this.  It is delicious.  I do not add more garlic because I use a lot of garlic in my potatoes.-

Wow, this turned out great !  I only made a few “adjustments” out of necessity; the recipe as written is totally solid: -Doubled the ham-Freeze dried onions-Canned sliced new potatoes-Added a can of sliced carrots-Used chicken ‘bone’ broth-Slow cooker on High (not Low) for same indicated durations-Velveeta instead of cheddar.  And...it’s awesome.  Flavors of the indicated ingredients is honestly all you need..resist the urge to add additional seasoning, thickening, or alter ratios on your first try with this recipe (‘cept maybe upping the ham qty).  Though it’s clearly an excellent starting point to get imaginative with other veggies, proteins, etc..next time round’. Thanks for a great soup to start the new year:)!

I made this with potatoes that I diced myself and I added extra cheese.  Velveeta to be exact.  I also didn’t have time to slow cook it so used a pot stove-top.  Sautéed the onions and celery until al-dente.  Turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Super good. I used a bag of cubes hash browns.  It was a 32 oz bag instead of the 28oz the recipe called for. I also used more broth than the recipe called for just because I didn’t want to waste the rest of the broth in the box I bought. I cooked on high for 4 hours (I totally missed it in the recipe where it called for low temp-oops). It turned out fantastic. Will definitely make again since it was super easy and gave me a way to use the extra Christmas ham.

Very good. I'd put in more ham and also be sure not to use extra sharp cheddar as it will likely break and impart a gritty texture. Otherwise it was fantastic.

Family loved it! I too used fresh potatoes because that’s what I had on hand. I also added corn and bacon but I also used smoked turkey stock since I had that on hand too. Sooo good!
