It turned out great! I used flour instead of cornstarch, and minced garlic instead of powdered. It was super easy to throw together and quick to make! I served it alongside rice and tilapia.

Got back into town from a work trip and didn’t feel like going to the grocery store; had all the ingredients and voila! An easy meal that tasted good and the kids scarfed. Next time I’ll probably use fresh garlic b/c that’s the way I am, and I did throw in some parsley.

Super easy and yum!  Served over mashed cauliflower for a shrimp and grits kind of texture, while staying low carb. Added some Old Bay to half of the shrimp. Thanks for the great recipe.

Made with flour instead of cornstarch and added Parmesan cheese at the end. The picky boyfriend loved it.
