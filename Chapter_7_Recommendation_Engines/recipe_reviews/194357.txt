Very good and quite simple. My six year old did most of the work and we all enjoyed it as a family. Toasting the nuts is a necessity, please don't skip this part. NOTE: Toss your bananas with a little lemon juice to keep them from browning.

Texture is creamy, tasty, and not too sweet. Refrigerating four hours, I carefully cut the pie bar and lifted out. Crust did not crumble, however it was not a “bar” consistency. Followed all steps with perfection, using vanilla pudding. Prep time was more like 25 min;, not 15 as mentioned. Definitely a keeper.  ... UPDATE - 1/20/10 - made again, only this time I used 1 stick butter (1/2 c) and 1/8 c Apriva sugar w/ required measurement of Nilla cookies. Melted butter in microwave for 40 seconds, and stirred it into Nilla cookies/sugar in a bowl then put in baking dish. Both times I used my Salad Shooter to crumble cookies. The 2nd time, I forgot to add chopped pecans to crust before baking. After cooling, I layered pecans on top of crust. In error, added 1 c cool whip to (Pistacho) pudding and spread on top of crust. Added rest of cool whip to pudding, spreading final layer on top. Garnished with sliced bananas and refrigerated. Crust was much firmer this time. In future makings, I will use 1 stick melted butter for crust. Suggest you do likewise. Of the two flavors used, I prefer Pistacho - yummy!

I used Fat-Free pudding and low fat graham crackers, and Whipped topping. An EXCELLENT way to use up bananas.

Made this with my 5 year old so it was a great activity together.  Made it in a pie pan instead and added a little more margarine to hold the crust together. Skipped the nuts and made the first layer an 8oz package of fat free cream cheese with 1/2 c powdered sugar (mixed together) then I chopped my bananas for the next layer (mixed with a bit of lemon juice to not turn brown, then sugar free fat free banana pudding, then the pudding/lite cool whip combo, then light cool whip by itself.  Hubby said it's the best banana cream pie he's ever had!  Will definitely make again, next time might try the cream cheese and then cheesecake pudding?!

This tastes great, I used low fat pudding (banana cream) and sugar free cool whip and it was still fantastic.  It did not last long in our house.  I did end up using a little more butter to make the crust less crumbly.  Thanks

This was so quick and easy. I wanted something different to do with my aging bananas. I was getting tired of banana bread. I followed the recipe exactly. Would not change a thing!

This is delicious and simple. I made a smaller version of this using this recipe's proportions as a guide. It was a hit even though the "bars" crumbled coming out of the dish and turned into more of a triple layer pudding.

It tastes very artificial.  But if you replace half the whipped topping with fresh whipped cream + real vanilla, and also add lemon juice and/or zest to the pudding mixture, that helps reduce the artificial taste of it.

I definitely would recommend toasting the pecans for just 5-7 min. before combining in the crust....gives it that VERY YUMMY roasted taste and ohhhh so easy! Definitely a keeper!

I cheated and used a nilla wafer crust from the store, I can only imagine how good it must be on a homemade crust, but that substitution turned this into an easier no bake recipe.  Use a deep dish crust/pan. Also good with banana pudding. Big hit at my house!

This is the first banana cream pie I have made and it was great!! I didn't have enough nilla wafers to fill the whole 9x13 baking pan so I had to add some crushed graham crackers and i didn't have the pecans. Very good!!
