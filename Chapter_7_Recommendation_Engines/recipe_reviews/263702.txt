like the last person the coconut flakes would not mold into a ball. I was using wide flat unsweetened coconut flakes .I used Agave instead of honey due to the lower glycemic Index.  I placed the coconut mixture into a small cup muffin tin then into the freezer. the fat bombs did come out of the tin easily and taste great.

These fat bombs are very satisfying, and they keep me from over snacking.

I really am having a hard time rating this recipe. The taste is fantastic; however, I followed the directions to the letter, but the  balls would not hold together. They kept falling apart and weren't pretty, tight balls. I tried using a small cookie scoop, I tried using my hands, I let them harden in the freezer some and then tried squishing them with my hands. I finally gave up and just drizzled the chocolate on them and got the best picture I could. I wonder if the type coconut I used was the problem.  It was the unsweetened tiny flakes (like hairs), not the wider kind. Perhaps the broader coconut would have held together better?
