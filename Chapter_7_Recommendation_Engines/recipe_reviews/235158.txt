I don't normally go ga-ga over a recipe, even if I like it. I have to say, however, that these were the best pork chops I have ever eaten. I chose to bake the chops due to weather. My wife even told me to go online and give it five stars. No argument from me!!

I baked it in the oven. 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  I turned them over every 15min, so twice. When I turned them, I brushed them with the glaze. They were so yummy, I'm making it again tonight. I used garlic salt instead of crushed. I'm so happy I found this recipe!

Very tasty, John Chandler!  I must admit that I used pork chops that were way too thick!  I will promise myself to only use bone-in pork chops from now on!  I did brine my chops for a few hours before BBQing them.  The sauce is very mild and very delicious!  Thanks for a very delicious pork chop that will be repeated in the future.  Afterthought:  I was thinking about this sauce in the middle of the night. I think next time I'll crush rather than mince my garlic, and I'll mix up the sauce several hours ahead of time so the flavors really have more of a chance to meld.

How do you turn plain ol pork chops into something SPECIAL on a Sunday afternoon? You make THIS!! MY OH MY! I didn't have enough honey so I added a squirt of maple syrup and a few dashes of Chipotle hot sauce and about 5 garlic cloves! Out to the grill I go..... Seasoned the chops with salt n pepper, grill for 4-5 minutes, slather with sauce, turn over, 2-3 more minutes and slather again. Watch them like a Hawk, they will burn in a HOT MINUTE! This sauce CRAZY GOOOD

We loved this! I'm not great at grilling so I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes. Also, I only had about 1/4 cup ketchup until I ran out so I mixed it with 1/4 cup Heinz 57. Turned out to be a happy accident! In the future I might add a pinch of ginger or some brown sugar to change it up a little. Will definitely be having this again. DELICIOUS!!!!

Very good! Added a splash more soy sauce, 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2, and 3.5 tbsp of honey instead of suggested amount. Made these on my George Forman grill with boneless chops... Kept the top open and seared as suggested before coating with glaze. Coated multiple times and flipped halfway through. As the glaze ran off the grill I collected it in a plate so I could use some of the thickened glaze to pour on the chops at the end before serving. Nice and moist!

Easy to do and tastes great. Ate it with a side salad and garlic bread. Next time I'll try adding some sirracha to add a kick. We really like garlic so I used 4 cloves and I minced them instead of crushing as suggested. It's a keeper for sure.

Very good sauce. I couldn’t grill these so this is what I did. I seared each side in a pan and then put the chops in a pan. Poured the sauce( which I doubled) into the hot pan to carmelize a bit. I poured the sauce over the chops and baked them in the oven uncovered for 45 minutes at 350. The sauce is what makes this so delicious. UPDATE: I bbq’ed these and they are just as delicious. Make sure you follow instructions to pull them off when the internal temp is as directed. That’s what keeps them moist.

I also baked it in the oven, as others did.  I was not impressed at all.  I had pork in a watery sauce and the meat had no flavor.
I decided to broil the meat slightly to make it crispy, and I thickened the watery sauce and put it over the pork as I broiled it.  Which was better than after just baking it.  I may try this on the grill, I don't use my grill much in the winter.  Otherwise, I will not be making this recipe again.

Great flavor!  I had to bake the chops because it was too cold to grill but they turned out very tasty and moist. I would definitely make this again.

I found this recipe a few weeks ago and i have made the sauce for this probably 6 times already.  I have put in on pork chops, and chicken.  The sauce is awesome.  Only thing i have done different from the recipe, is after browning the chops or chicken, i pour the sauce over everything in the skillet, and let everything cook that way.  It thickens the sauce very nicely  and glazes to the meat.

I LOVED this recipe. I brined my bone-in pork chops in water, salt, and mesquite liquid smoke for about 4 hours before searing them on the stove and slathering them in yummy honey garlic glaze, then finally finishing them off in the oven. Also, another thing which I think is a MUST is adding some type of spice to the honey garlic glaze. That sweet and spicy flavor is to die for. A+ recipe. Definitely try this out for a tasty change up from traditional pan-seared pork chops. Especially if you enjoy sweet and savory oriental-like flavors. Serve with roasted red potatoes and some veggies and you got yourself a fine meal!

After reading other reviews stating it was too tomatoey, I decided to change the honey for molasses.  I think it really worked. It was really good.  I also added Wright's liquid smoke, a little balsamic vinegar, and some Tobasco.  I did charcoal grill them, but I think the molasses and liquid smoke would kick it up a notch if cooked in the oven as well.

I like simplicity in a recipe, and this is great just as it is.  Chili sauce also works instead of ketchup.  May try chipotle ketchup another time.  Today I happened to have half a lime that needed to be used, so added a bit of lime juice, which is not necessary, but was nice. There is more than enough basting sauce. I think next time I'll hold back about half, cook it in the microwave a bit and serve it on the side with the chops after glazing them with the rest of the sauce.  This recipe is a keeper!

I came across this recipe 3 weeks ago and have already made it twice.  It is absolutely delicious.   I baked it at 350 for 45 min and turned them over twice (like Jill in the comments suggested) and coated both sides with the glaze each time.  I modified the glaze the second time i made this and added 3 tbs of honey instead of the suggested amount, added a pinch of garlic powder, onion powder and ground ginger.  I also seasoned the pork with salt and pepper.  I served this with roasted potatoes and carrots and cheddar broccoli and cauliflower.

Uniquely subtle; yet bold at times, sweet taste that brings something new and different to the dinner table. 

I marinated the chops for 1 hour beforehand using a marinade that included apple cider vinegar, lemon zest, raw honey, garlic, soy sauce, and some salt and pepper. Delicious!

I baked the pork chops rather than grill them and they were wonderful.  I refrigerated the leftover sauce and used it later on chicken and it was just as delicious.  I think I might add a bit more garlic next time just to bump the flavor up a bit. Definitely a keeper!

I made it as outlined. I was pleasantly surprised given the ratio of ketchup to other ingredients. I was worried it was jut going to taste like ketchup. But it didn't; it was really tasty. It paired very well with the pork chops--my spouse loved it! If I were to change anything, I'd add a bit of cayenne to give it a spicy kick we love. However, easy and  great as is!

The only change i made was that i added 1 tsp of sriracha sauce to add a kick. They were great. Perfect for the grill. Made with potato salad and it was a perfect meal.

To be fair...I cooked the chops on the stove top and not the grill...I don't have a grill but I wanted to make pork chops a different way and this sounded good. I did LIKE this and it was different...but with the soy sauce in the ingredients I just expected more of an Asian flavor...which is why I went for this recipe. It was Good but I'm giving it 3 stars because it just tasted like a honey garlic barbeque sauce... I personally did not taste the soy sauce...the ketchup was more of what I tasted. Perhaps next time I will try it on a grill and have a different experience. However, I am keeping this recipe as its a GOOD, Quick honey BBQ sauce to make from semi-scratch verses buying BBQ sauce in a jar overflowing with preservatives... Yiick!

As a novice in the kitchen, this was a very easy recipe for me. It was also absolutely delicious and we will definitely be adding it to our repitoire. I baked our chops instead of grilling it, but the sauce was so tasty!!

I don't have a grill so I had to cook it on a stove top. Very simple and yet still very savory. Something is missing, but a nice recipe when you are short on time. I will definitely be trying this again on a grill!

This is a keeper! I didn't have pork chops the 1st time, so used chicken. It was equally as good as the 2nd time around with Pork! Like others I upped the garlic and sirracha was a nice little kick to this recipe. I've even used brown sugar when I was out of honey and it works fine. I finally found a way for my husband to eat pork chops.

The prep time and cook time were accurate.  Taste was flavorful. Next time  I think I'll add some chile flakes and balance that sweetness with a little heat.

I’ve made this recipe many times and it’s never let me down. Also note that this sauce can be used on pork ribs too. Boil the ribs for 10-15 min until white. Then Marinate the pork ribs for 1 hour or so in ziplock bags and then BBQ. Keep basting the ribs with the extra sauce in the bags. I posted a picture. HUGE hit with the family. Excellent sauce!

I don’t usually submit reviews... but, these were Absolutely the  Best pork chops I’ve ever had! I made them in the oven, due to the weather, but can’t wait to try them on the grill. Also, want to try on chicken. Good job! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was not my cup of tea. Reminded me of an Asian seasoning...tangy and sweet. Just wasn't my flavor. After the reviews I was trying to open my mind and mouth to new flavors... this wasn't it. Sorry.

I was really excited to try this recipe. After reading the reviews, I made the sauce a day ahead so the flavors could meld overnight. It was just ok. I probably won't make it again.

I made this recipe with boneless, thinly sliced chops and I added Asian garlic paste to the ingredients to give it a little kick. I also season my pork chops with smoked paprika and garlic powder before I put them on the grill. Yummmmm!

Thank you for a great recipe. I made this exactly as written but as a reviewer suggested, I made the sauce a few hours in advance so the flavor would have time to develop. Really nice, really lightning fast for a weeknight meal. It actually makes you look like you spent a lot of time in the kitchen. Very yummy!

We liked that this was quick and easy. We are going to try putting the glaze on after the first side sears. We didn't get good carmelization of the glaze. It was a decent flavor for the effort.

This was so delicious ! I used boneless pork chops,  brined them in salt water for 10 minutes then grilled and basted. I added some crushed hot pepper in the sauce, my family likes the kick! The chops were juicy and my family loved the glaze!! It is definitely added to the  whats for dinner menu in my house!!

Followed the directions, seared the pork chops on both sides turning frequently on the grill and  lathered the sauce on each time they were turned.  When the porkchops were done, I used the remaining sauce when they were put on the plate, they turned out great!

Made as directed and used on Pork steaks. Really, really good and so simple!! 2nd time tweaked it to my preference and still great! Cut down the Catsup, added a tiny bit of BBQ sauce, added (maybe doubled) honey by taste. Used on Chicken and thick pork chops.  mopped a few times while cooking. This is a great, easy, common ingredient recipe that is so easy to play with. Thanks for sharing it!

Very good flavor.  I cooked the pork chops in the oven as well and think it would be better on the grill.  It would give a better sear to the meat.

I did make changes. I didn't have much ketchup, so I decided to use my almost empty bottles of ketchup, bbq sauce, yellow mustard, and sriacha, in addition to the garlic, soy, and honey. It made a pretty good sauce. I browned the chops first on the stove and then finished in the oven, basting with the sauce every 10 minutes or so. I would like to try it on the grill, but this works either way. I used the broiler at the end to caramelize the sauce. I also seasoned the chops with salt, pepper, and a coffee bbq season rub I have.

Sauce was like a super runny BBQ sauce.  I used the grill and the sauce wouldn’t caramelize and ran right off the pork chops. Maybe next time I’ll try brown sugar instead of honey to get a good caramelized flavor and some corn starch to thicken.

Great recipe and SO easy!

I doubled the recipe and had a little too much sauce leftover.  But it was worth it to have plenty to drizzle on after the cook.

I laid on a lot more sauce and cooked for the last few minutes to really caramelize and thicken the sauce to make it sticky.

I baked it after reading the reviews. Came out fantastic. I did marinade the pork in the marinade for about an hour, threw it on a rack and basted it in some more marinade before baking it. Baked it at 350 for 45 min. Turned every 15 min. Served it with rice and broccoli. Even my fussy hubs liked it. Will definately make it again.

I actually used this for a pork tenderloin.  I marinated it after poking holes in the tenderloin.  Marinated for about 2 hours. 

Cooked for 20 min. at 425 degrees
Thanks for the recipe...

My family loved it!

I just added a little liquid smoke because I had some in the cupboard but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It was so good! I think it is my new favorite way to make pork chops.

I thought they were just okay.  They were easy to make but not something I would crave or  want to eat all the time.

Wonderful recipe.  Easy to make and makes a taste treat to the pork.  I think this would work for chicken and turkey.  Can't wait to try it.

I used the posted recipe plus added a little pepper and a chopped onion. I added one cup of water since I was using my Presto Pressure Cooker (17 minutes cooking time). The mixture made a delicious gravy over the meat and our mashed potatoes.  My husband and I both loved it and will definitely have it again.

Made this on the grill and they really came out great. I used thick cut boneless pork chops. Had 8 of them.  Made the sauce and marinated for 2 hours. Made another batch to put on while grilling. My son who is a picky eater loved it. Recipe is simple too. Oh yeah I just used regular gluten free soy sauce at it was not salty.

Really good.  Followed other's suggestions.  Seasoned pork chops first- s&p, garlic powder.... (I did a quick 2 hour brine- internet).. and added a little cayenne and Worcestershire sauce to the mixed sauce.... no complaints.  Saved a little sauce to try with chicken as others in comments said.  OH!!! almost forgot,  will try on the grill next time...... after sear on both sides put in oven 350°/30 minutes.  Basted with one turn in oven after 15 minutes

The glaze has ingredients that are always on hand and it was easy to make.   Before I put it on the pork chops I saved a little on the side to use after they were cooked.  Added a nice flavor to the chops.

I made this exactly as instructed and we thought it was just okay. The glaze didn't seem as "sticky" as the pictures posted. I probably won't make it again as written.

It tasted like Baby Ray's BBQ sauce to me, so it wasn't really worth the extra trouble to make. Don't get me wrong: I liked it--just nothing special. Maybe if you're looking for a gluten-free BBQ sauce, you could make it with Tamari instead of soy since I'm guessing BR's has gluten; otherwise, just not worth the extra step

I used Stubbs BBQ sauce, some prickly pear cactus honey, the soy and garlic.  I had brined the chops for 6 hours in a salt, garlic and whole Rosemary brine before grilling.  They were very moist and delicious.

I seared them in the frying pan first.  Baked them at 350 for 30 min. Did the turning and basting, they came out really good. The perfect option to plain frying. Oh and the sauce was very good.

Very tasty sauce for pork. I think I'll try it on chicken next. My husband loved it too. First grill out this season and well worth it. Awesome grilled flavor.

I made it a lil  different  Than yours I made in the oven than put under boiler. Instead of  garlic clove I used garlic power and added a dish of  Hot sauce. Great job me.   Thank you for showing the way.     Icyndaddy.

Baked it in the convection oven for 1hour. Basting and turning every 20 minutes. My chops were perfectly seasoned and done! I will make them again. After tasting the barbecue sauce I decided to add some lemon zest and a little minced onion.

Followed the recipe and fixed boneless country ribs in an air fryer and they were really good.  Love that it’s easy and made with ingredients usually on hand.  Anxious to try pork chops on the grill.

I haven't tried this, but in my opinion the recipes needs a little bit of a kick, and some complexity. I would season with black pepper, paprika. Maybe some thyme, and oregano. Maybe rosemary? Or instead of those, just a dusting of Old Bay seasoning. Just looks a little bland as is, but a good base to start from.

Just mediocre nothing special. There’s not to many ways to make pork chops so this is certainly an option, they weren’t bad just not fantastic!

I had to improvise as I had no soy sauce, and not enough honey.  I used worchestershire sauce and added some brown sugar. It was delicious.

My seven year old son LOVED this recipe, and my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I had brined the pork chops ahead of time - as some people had suggested - and it made the pork chops extra juicy.

It was good and my pork chops looked just like the picture. They were moist too. They just didn't taste extra special as I thought they would, though like I said, they were good. I added 4 cloves of garlic because we love garlic and also some hot sauce because it seemed a little too sweet. I will probably make it again.

It didn't have any pizazz!  The sauce was too mild for my taste.  I followed the recipe exactly except I broiled it instead of grilling it.

It tasted as good as it looks.  Simple but tasty dish.  Cut back 25% of the soy sauce and replaced it with Worcestershire sauce.

We didn’t love this. Sorry, but wasn’t anything special and just mediocre. Three for actual flavor. Gave it a two because I felt like a decent bottled sauce could give same or better results.

This sauce was just okay. I baked instead of barbecued, but that didn’t affect my opinion of the sauce. It needed ginger or something more zippy.

I enjoyed this. The only things I did differently were that I thickened the sauce in the pan and cut up the pork chops into strips (after frying them) and let them cook longer in the sauce. Next time I will serve this over rice, as it has more of an Asian dish taste to my husband and I.

Since it is extremely cold where I live,  after browning lightly, and  covering with sauce, I baked these for about 30 minutes, turning once, and coating with more sauce. I used boneless pork chops and they were very tender. I didn't think the sauce was that special, even after adding some Worchestershire, and more soy sauce. I make my own BBQ sauce, and then prepare the chops the same way.
; my homemade sauce is just way better.

It didn't glaze as well as I would have liked, but I may have needed to kick up the heat on my grill. My family liked it though! Pretty tasty and easy! I will definitely make it again.

Being from metro Saint Louis, I like my sauces sweet.  I doubled the recipe and added about 1/4 cup brown sugar and simmered the sauce for a few minutes before coating my chops (which I baked rather than grill due to our crazy winter windy freezing weather).  I served with homemade mashed potatoes and corn.  Yummy!

Followed some of the comments and made some personal tweeks! Baked at 350 for an hour turned every 15 minutes for even cooking and layered with more sauce. Drained the excess liquid, turned the broil on low for 10 minutes, flipping it half way through and blazed it with the remaining sauce.

I was so excited to make this for my family. I followed the directions including having extra for dipping on the side. I put the glaze on the chops about 4-5 hours prior to baking. I broiled them on high about 3 minutes each side. Then turned the oven down to 275 degrees for 45 minutes. Temped above 145 degrees. They were very tender and flavorful. But they reminded me of bbq ribs , I was disappointed. But everyone else enjoyed them.

Amazing!!! I thought the ketchup was odd but... OH MY!! Perfection!!! I did not use the grill... instead I used a cast iron pan and basted it everytime I flipped it. The sauce glazed with the heat and was fantastic

These were pretty good.  I cooked in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes.  They were a little dry, so next time I would reduce the time a bit.  I followed the recipe exactly except added some extra garlic because we like garlic in this house.

They were delicious and easy to make.  I did not have the opportunity to BBQ but baked in the oven instead flipping after about 20 minutes (45 minute total at 350) and reglazing.  I would recommend adding a bit more soya sauce and honey for my personal taste.  Overall really awesome, will definitely make again

Delicious!  I didn't feel like standing over the grill, so I marinated the chops in this for a couple of hours and then baked them at 350F for about 35-40 minutes.  The whole famliy loved them

Made this because of the many glowing reviews and I needed a quick and easy prep for my chops. Recipe was just ok. I felt the ketchup taste was just to much for my liking, and overall it was too sweet. I don’t think I will make this one again, sorry.

I was hoping for something unusual but got a variation of BBQ sauce. It was good for BBQ pork chops but that wasn't what it was called.

Very good next time I will marinate the chops in the sauce and add some red pepper for a bigger flavor. Definitely a keeper.

I put mine in the slower cooker and cut pork into chunks.  Ten minutes before serving I added corn starch slurry, asparagus and matchstick carrots.  It was delicious over white rice

Pretty good recipe. I made this with two bone-in pork chops, so I made half the glaze. It added a good flavor to the chops. And it's quick, so that's a benefit.

Sorry, After reading reviews I tried it. Followed exact recipe Hubby didn't like it at all. Found it really didn't have too much flavour  needed some more zip. (Maybe  a  little ginger?)  not be making again.

These were easy and fantastic.  I had friends over for dinner and they loved them.

The only thing I did differently was add a tsp of sriracha and 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2.  

This one is definitely a keeper.

This is an amazing sauce.  I fried my pork chops in a cast iron skillet then slathered the sauce on, flipping the chops several times to coat and to allow the sauce to caramelize.  My family loved it.

Super quick, fast & easy!  I added a tad more crushed garlic and it was amazing.  My only change would be using a slightly thicker chop; but other than that absolutely no problems with this one! A++++

My family and I liked this recipe. I made it exactly as it's written and it was very tasty. I didn't give it 5 stars only because the recipe says 6 pork chops and I only had 4. My husband did the grilling and he used all the marinade on the 4 pork chops and there wasn't a lot of flavor on them. I liked what I was tasting but wished I had made a second batch for dipping but I had thought the extra sauce would of been plenty of flavor. 
I will make again but next time I'll make extra sauce for dipping .
Thanks for the recipe??

This was so quick and easy to make! I already had everything in my house and was looking for a quick way to make pork that was a little different. I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly and it was PERFECT. The only change I made was I cut up the pork because that's just my personal preference. I served with broccoli and noodles and the sauce was great on everything. This will become a regular meal for my household :) thanks for sharing!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious.  It's key to follow the searing / grilling instructions to ensure the pork chops do not dry out. The whole family loved it.  THANK YOU! :)

Replace the ketchup with honey dijon mustard and make a little extra to dip. Great simple sauce that can go on any pork or chicken.

I made this exactly as written and it was good but a bit blah for me. Two of the chops at the last minute I added my usual dry mix of spices for pork and I did like it better because it added a little more flavor.

With only a few ingredients, I was skeptical...but this was awesome. I highly suggest this one as someone that rarely cooks pork. Definitely will make again.

This was truly super simple and did add a nice flavor.  I halved the recipe and only added red pepper flakes for a little kick, was  very good!

I made the dish as described and it was quick, easy, and delicious.  I added some sliced potatoes and red, orange, and yellow peppers and onions to the grill.  A complete meal done at the same time.  Everyone enjoyed it and definitely have added this to my "favorite" recipe in my recipe box.

Let me start by saying I HATE porkchops. We wanted to try something different and this recipe (exactly as it is) is AMAZING. We have made this 3+ times now because it is so DELICIOUS! I love it! Made a porkchop lover out of me :-) you cannot go wrong with this dish.

This rating is from my 12 and 13 year old sons who cooked these pork chops last night. They added a little ground ginger and marjoram, and then they broiled the chops in the oven. My 12 yo was too busy eating to comment, but his 13 yo brother used every synonym for "this recipe is a keeper" that he could think of.  Easy to make and loaded with flavor!

So fun and easy to make. I baked the chops. Loved the taste, and made enough sauce  to dip in! Will make this again. I love cooking with my girlfriend, good music in the background and a Rum Drink!

Sauce was absolutely amazing I will definitely make this again- will be nice with some added chilli or hot sauce

I followed the recipe but chose to bake them for 40 min. Next time I'll marinade the pork for 1-4 hours and grill them.

Revised:  The second time I made the recipe it was great.  This time I  marinated the pork in 1/2 the sauce for an hour before I put it on the grill and it did wonders.  I also made the grill pan super hot so the sauce would caramelize nicely.  
***Note*** This dish does spike the blood sugar a bit, it did for me the first time.  I drank a liter of water during dinner to counter the spike and it help keep my sugar mostly steady (it went up, but it wasn't as bad.)   

I used an indoor grill pan to make this dish and it was okay.  I flipped the chops over four times and glazed each time.  My problem was the glaze didn't really seep in and flavor the meat like I expected it to.  
Also, I added a tea spoon of salt and 2 tea spoons of pepper to balance the sweetness.  
Next time I think I'll marinate the pork for a few hours before in half the glaze and then glaze while I'm cooking

I cooked these in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes turning and basting them with sauce every 15 minutes. I would recommend putting these on the broiler the last few minutes of baking so that the sauce would stick. I’m sure that these would form more of a sticky glaze on the BBQ. I can’t wait to make these on the grill I am sure that they will be better!

My family loved these pork chops!  I had large but thinner bone-in chops available.  I prepared the glaze ahead of time and let it sit so that all of the flavors could blend.  I glazed one side and baked at 400 for 10 minutes.  I then turned them over and glazed again.  I baked for an additional 5 minutes and then broiled until the glaze thickened.   Delicious!  I think I will try this with chicken or salmon the next time.

Made this to a tee!! (I hate when people change the original recipe before trying it.. then complain)  It was simple and tasted great!! Although my family and myself all thought it was too 'ketchupy.' Will make again, with less ketchup. Might add some brown sugar as well.

I plan on making this again as it was good, just a little too much on the ketchup taste.  I had used less than called for but next time I will use 1/2 of what the recipe says.  For my taste it will then make this a 5 star dish!!

I gave it a 2 & hubby gave a 3 but we won't be making it again. He said it was very easy, but neither of us liked the taste. I thought you could taste the ketchup but it was like the flavors didn't mix. A person could use a teriyaki or BBQ sauce already made & would taste better I thought.

I agree with the person who said it had way too strong of a ketchup flavor.  I baked this then broiled it so the sauce would caramelize some, which helped.  I might try this once more on the grill, but so far I'm not at all impressed.  Will cut the ketchup in half next time.

I made this tonight for dinner and it came out excellent. I was even able to add my own things for my own liking and came out just incredible. I made two sets of sauces and added brown sugar, chili powder, and garlic salt. However, in one I used as a marinade and I added apple cider vinegar to it and it marinated for 5 hours. I did grill it and recommend grilling it. I also tenderized my pork. I recommend this recipe to everyone who loves flavor.

Meh.  I don't get the strong reviews. "Simple" is the key here. Basically it's ketchup with a little flavor. It's not bad, it's just not that good.

I didn't have honey so I subbed maple syrup. I baked them (after marinating them in the glaze for a couple hours) instead of grilling. I feel like grilling probably would have been better because they'd actually be glazed. Baking them made the sauce watery. The sauce flavour was decent and leftovers the next day were better IMO. I think this sauce would be good on chicken thighs.

Had a cousin over and a friend plus my own family.... everyone was going on and on about how good it was. I didn't dare tell them that it was basically just ketchup and honey when they asked if I had made the sauce LOL! Just said "Yep!" Anyway, they devoured it. Will make again as this was super easy, which is why I tried it in the first place... I had no time and was looking for a '5 Star' that I could whip up in no time. Thank you for sharing.

OMG this was an extraordinarily  succulent, tasty, greasy, satisfying, hunk of pork.  Truly  a 7 star and a class act.  Just be warned...the focus here is on drop dead delicious, not for timid health freaks.  This is a masculine dish, for a man's cravings, and don't wear white clothes.  The goal is to present it looking just like the picture.  Here's how.

I've made this many times since finding the recipe - it is great.  LOL - I've yet to try it on pork chops.  I put it on ribs (pork and beef), chicken, and  shrimp.  I made it as is - great.  I've added more garlic as other suggested - better.  I've made it with Sriracha Ketchup - if you like a little spice and sweet it was awesome.  I've also made it with Agave - I don't recommend unless you are a vegan - the honey is way better.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!

Five stars because it was so simple ... and tasty. I used a little less Ketchup and a little Barbecue Sauce,   Chipotle  pepper and 3 tbs Honey.... because that's what I had...  I coated the bone in one inch chops and then realized  my grill was out of gas... So I scored the chops and put them in a frying pan on medium high heat... 7 min. first side  and second side for 5.  They came nicely seared and very moist...  Thank you for sharing!

This was excellent.  I made this on a hot day and made double the glaze and marinated the chops in half of it for a couple of hours.   The glaze is really too thick to submerge the chops like a real marinade but I just spread some on top and turned them over once and spread more on the other side and I do think it added more flavor. 
 I grilled as directed. Don't forget to keep glazing during the grilling with some reserved sauce.  They didn't take very long to cook, about 6 minutes per side.   My chops were from Omaha Steaks so they were excellent anyway, but this glaze made them really something special.  They were tender and juicy and very very tasty. Served them with a little of the glaze on the side and a homemade pasta salad for a wonderful summer meal. My husband devoured these chops and said next time we should add a splash of whiskey to the glaze.

I didn't make any changes except for adding a tad more of honey. It turned out great & yes, I will make it again!

Doubled the ingredients on a 1 pack of country style spare ribs. My family like it, but needs a little bit more soy or salt. Next time I will marinade it overnight before cooking. I bake it uncovered at 500 F for 20 min; then decreased the temp. to 350 for the next 1 hr and 40 min covered with foil. The result very soft, meat is fork tender and fell off the bone!

It turned out great. I eyeballed the sauce and didn't really take any measurements. I ended up cooking my bone-in chops in a skillet since there were 2 of us for dinner.

I followed glaze exactly but my pork chops were only 1/2 inch. Family still loved it. No leftovers except for the carrots I made as a side.

Very tasty, I think I would prefer to bake them as the sauce did not stay on the chops as well as I hoped on the grill. But I really liked the taste of the sauce tho.

This was very good.  I only had about a tablespoon of honey.  so I added brown sugar to make up the difference.  Great flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was a very simple, easy to make and taste delicious. I followed the recipe with the exception of half of the marinade since I wasn't making very many using my George Foreman grill.

I thought the soy sauce overpowered all the other ingredients. If I do this again, I will cut the soy in half & use low-sodium.

This was a pretty good base to work with, but I did make a few changes. I used 1/4 cup ketchup and supplemented the other half with 1/4 cup Sriracha to add some spicy flavor. I enjoyed it but would probably increase the garlic and honey since I mostly tasted the ketchup even after cutting it down (I did have to broil instead of grill so that does impact it). The leftovers were great for pork fried rice the next day.

Easy peasy! My family loved it and would like it again. However, I did broil my dish, it was too hot to go outside and grill. I will try on the grill next time for that smoke taste.  I can see using the sauce on other dishes. A very fast dish to make.

Excellent sauce for these chops.  I doubled the recipe for 3lbs of boneless, loin chops and there was plenty.  I did brush the sauce on one side of the chops and let it sit while the charcoal got going, then grilled for 9 minutes/side.  Super yum!

I always make a recipe as it is written - the first time.  Then I decide if it needs something else (according to our taste).  I made this recipe & was amazed at how wonderfully delicious it was!  I didn't change a thing,   This will definitely be one of my go-to recipes from now on - delicious AND easy!

Followed recipe, very good.  Will use again, just from rating perspective not anything special in terms of ingredients or cooking. Will probably marinate for a few hours in advance to add more favour. Thank you!

I personally enjoyed the chop. I did cook the chop in the pan and I think it would have been that much better on the grill.

I usually murder pork chops, but this time took them off the grill a little early.  Even our picky son ate a whole pork chop! The sauce is perfect!

Really good orange chicken!  I have to admit I did not marinate the chicken first.  I browned the chicken and then finished cooking it in the marinade.  The flour coating on the chicken was sufficient to thicken the sauce, so I didn't need the corn starch.  Served over rice, it was delicious.

My thoughts when making were "This name is more than likely a bit of a stretch".

But  we LOVED this so much we made them 2 nights in a row!! 

"WORLD'S BEST" is an apt description and title!

I made this last night and I even got a compliment from my father-in-law ( first time in 28 years lol). I used 3/4 inch chops as Walmart didn't have 1 in. Works well, just watch your cook time.  I made the sauce as directed? but double and added a dash of liquid smoke. It was absolutely wonderful. Will make again and highly recommend this recipe for a quick griller.

I made this using 1/4c bbq sauce and 1/4 ketchup to make sauce a little thicker. Found it had more zip this way. Thanks for the recipe.

I leave out the soy sauce because of the sodium level but I do add some salt but not at that level. You can also substitute real maple syrup instead of honey and don't forget the pile on the garlic

Not awful, but not fabulous either. I will try it again, but I think next time I will add some ginger root, some extra garlic, and maybe some cayenne. Not a huge fan of sweet, and it kinda tastes like BBQ sauce.

We loved this and will definitely make them again.  I pan fried the chops because it was pouring outside, but I'm sure they'd be even better on the grill.  I plan on using this sauce with chicken as well.  It's so flavorful!

Excellent recipe.  For chops this thick or even thicker, I'd suggest soaking in a maple brine for 8 hours and grill to 150 degrees, slightly pink, for an incredibly juicy chop.

Tasty for a quick easy weekday meal. Used jarred garlic and locally sourced honey. Marinaded chops in the fridge for a few hours in a couple tablespoons of Dales Sauce, then patted dry before basting on glaze. The glaze charred a bit in my Foreman grill, but the overall result was tender and juicy. Don't leave any glaze uncooked unless you like the taste of ketchup, though!;)

I'm vegetarian so I didn't try it but it's the first time I've tried a recipe from this website that my husband actually said he LOVED. He wants me to put it in the weekly menu - I was surprised but thrilled because he's picky and it's so easy. I substituted organic agave for the honey and let them marinate with the first coat for an hour before cooking.

Yummy chops!  I just mixed up the ingredients as published and did add a tablespoon of hoisin sauce and a dash of Montreal seasoning.  I tossed my chops in a ziplock and added this as a marinade.  Hubs grilled perfectly.  Loved the flavor of this easy-peasy recipe.  Thanks for sharing with AR!
