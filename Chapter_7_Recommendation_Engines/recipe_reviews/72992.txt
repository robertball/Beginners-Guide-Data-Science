Love these!  Wonderfully light and tender rolls and so QUICK!  I didn't have self-rising flour and used the substitution of:  1 Cup all purpose flour + 1 tsp baking powder + 1/2 tsp salt....turned out fantastic.

I have to agree with other reviewers here: this recipe by itself makes pretty bland rolls. But it still deserves 4 stars because it only needs a couple of herbs added to make a delicious and easy made dinner roll. Rosemary, oregano, garlic, ... there are no limits.
I did not have self-rising flour but used 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt instead. Thanks for this great basic recipe, Miss Betty! :)

I am not sure why people are complaining that they are plain. What are they suppose to taste like. Well our family loved them. My DH and kids all ate them. We made it to go with our beef stroganof and green beans and it was great. I am not sure what people are looking for when they need all those spices. My husband thinks it must be a main meal. We use our rolls for a light side. The only thing is that this is more like a bisquet than a roll. But is sure tastes good. It would be great as bisquets and gravy. Sorry about spelling here. No spell check ;)

These rolls were a very light biscuit texture. My children and I loved them! I did make one change because I was out of mayo, I used 2 T. ranch dressing instead, which gave them a light ranch flavor (very good!) Since I don't use self-rising flour I used the Betty Crocker substitution of 1 cup flour, 1 1/2 t. baking powder and 1/2 t. salt. I will make these again :)

I made these for lunch today to go with tomato soup. I added 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. of crushed rosemary and 1 tsp. of italian seasoning and they came out great.  These are so simple!

I like this recipe. It's pretty fast and easy to make, but I always add something like grated chedar cheese, bacon, roasted garlic or something because otherwise they are pretty bland for my taste. I like the biscuit consistency and I make them to eat with soups =)

I tried this recipe because it looked so easy and because the reviews were so good. I really didn't expect them to be very good. They are really good. My husband gave me a thumbs up and I will make them again.

I already made 2 batches today!

I only fill them up halfway in the muffin cup, and it ended up to get me 8.  I also put jam in the middle, and my second batch had cheese and ham in it.  I added a little more water (not milk) to the batter, so it came out more muffin like.  The only thing is that I baked it longer, since there's more moisture in the batter.  But definitly a keeper!!

I added garlic powder and cheddar cheese to mine and baked for 20 min and they still didn't brown up.  But they were delicious.  I love the gummy sort of textureand they were very light.  I will definitely make again.

Although this is definitely a biscuit and not a roll, it's a fantastic recipe and we will certainly make them again. It was completely unneccessary to put them in muffin tins, would have come out just as great by plopping it down on a greased cookie sheet. I made two batches, one plain and one with added italian seasoning/parm cheese and both were equally delicious. Very versatile and can be suited to any taste.

I needed a quick recipe for rolls to have with dinner and these were a hit.  Kind of "biscuitey" but served its purpose and I did not have to roll them out. Quick, simple and good!! Will definitely make again.  To those of you who could not get them to brown, I baked mine at 450 degrees for 8-10 minutes.  I also did not have "self rising flour" on hand but made my own.  1 cup of flour, 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt, plus for extra flavor 2 or 3 tablespoons of sugar.  EASY CHEESY!!! = D

For what it is, this is a good recipe. Very quick, excellent soft and airy texture, but bland. In the future I would serve with jam. Maybe even slice and toast after baking like english muffins? If you're out of milk substitute 1 egg, 2 tbs butter, 1/3c water, dash of vanilla.

I rated this 4 stars because they are super quick, and they are good.  However, they should be called super quick dinner biscuits.  When I think of a dinner roll, I think of bread, not biscuits.

My husband really enjoyed these, and I thought they were okay.. I wasn't blown away, but they WERE really quick and simple. I followed the directions exactly, with the exception of using all-purpose flour and adding some baking powder and a little salt as per a previous reviewer's suggestion. :) We had a pot roast, used it to mop up the gravy. It made 6 biscuits.. They didn't brown, so I gave up after 20 minutes and used the broiler for a couple minutes. Worked well for slightly brown tops! Thanks for a simple recipe.. Next time, I'll add cheese and/or herbs!

These just did not go well for me.  They were way to dense, and the outsides were crunchy.  I added a dab of honey and some salt, but they were completely bland.  Decent enough if you don't have time for a dough to rise.

These were great. I added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the dry ingredients. Very moist without any fat. Thanks for posting.

really good.  I add lots of shredded sharp cheese to zip them up.  They aren't going to be my favorite biscuit or roll by any means, but they are a good easy addition to dinner when you need something fast.  Thanks!

These were OK. Not great, but what do you expect from a recipe with 3 ingredients? My kids liked them.  I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder for a little kick.  I will probably make again when I'm pressed for time.  They were quick, that's for sure.

Everyone described these as biscuits and since I hate cleaning my muffin pan, I just made 4 large drop biscuits on a foil-lined cookie sheet.  They peeled off beautifully, even after forgetting to grease it.  I highly recommend skipping the muffin pan!

I also did not have self-rising flour, so I used 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp of salt.  Next time I'll skip the salt as it seemed too strong for my taste.

Overall a super simple and tasty recipe - I'll definitely make again.

I must agree with everyone that this is an absolute hit!! I didn't have eggs but I wanted to make dinner rolls and voila!! (I also had to substitute the self-rising flour like almost everyone- helpful tip and thank you to those who mentioned that in their comments.) I made two batches because it tasted so good and added a bunch of herbs to it. The texture and flavor is so versatile- it can go anyway you want it! My brother was the most impressed! we are gonna put peanut butter and jelly in the middle! (he thinks; this is still a work in progress!) have fun with it!! :)

These are awesome as is for breakfast. I also added garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and grated cheddar for dinner rolls. I just brush the tops with melted butter when I take them out of the oven. This way it tastes just like Red Lobster cheddar garlic biscuits. I think you could tweak this recipe in any number of ways. LOVE IT!

The problem with these muffins is that they are too easy and delicious!  The recipe itself is open to many variations, too.  We do not keep self-rising flour at our house, so I added 1 1/2 t. baking powder and 1/2 t. salt.  I made these twice in one evening!  The first batch, for dinner, had whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and I baked them in 6 muffin tins.  My family loved them.  The second batch, for a lunch carry-in at work, I tripled all ingredients and used 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat.  Also to this batch I added a bit of dill, just for fun, but it vanished into the dough and cannot be tasted.  I baked in 12 muffin cups, and had to bake it longer because of the size.  But everyone at work loved them, too; and my only complaint is that my "nonstick" muffin tin was hard to clean.  :)  Next time I might add shredded cheese, garlic, more dill, other herbs, cinnamon, raisins, pecans, or something else--not because they need it, for these biscuit-muffins are perfect alone, especially hot.  Rather it's because they lend themselves to addition.

This recipe would have been too plain, no flavor had I not done some changing per the advice of others. I used regular flour, 1 1/2 tsps. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt to make my own self rising flour. I added 3/4 cup grated cheddar cheese, and about 1/4 tsp. each of dried oregano leaves and ground thyme. Next time I'll use more of the herbs. I put it in an 8x8 inch square cake pan. It filled about half of it. (Next time I'll double the recipe.) Baked at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. It turned out brown and was delicious. Quick and easy, too. My husband liked it. Next time, I'll try bacon crumbles in the batter for breakfast.

These were super quick but I am giving it 3 stars b/c I had to had 1/2 tsp garlic powder to make them taste good...I found them a bit tasteless..I made them again with whole wheat flour instead and they were much better.

I didn't have any mayo or even eggs, so I subbed golden syrup (similar to honey). They were delicious. I will be making them regularly!

This recipe really helped in a pinch.  Lighter than a biscuit, a bit muffin-like.  I'd have given one more star if it had a TEENY bit more flavor.  Of course, looking at the ingredients, what would one expect? My children loved them with butter and a bit of honey.  Come to think of it, with it's light flavor, it can be used with many different toppings. Will make again, I'm sure.

I did the all purpose flour/Baking powder and salt thing as well. I also added caraway seeds to the recipe the first and second times I made this. The third time I added 2 minced garlic cloves, oregano, and cheddar cheese since I was out of bread for garlic bread and they were great with spaghetti. And last night I added just to try something new, some spaghetti sauce with the cheddar cheese, garlic and oregano! As you add the cheese and sauce you have to up the baking time  by about ten minutes and I even upped the temp by 25 degrees but this is such a fun recipe to play with! Great plain but also great as a quick addition with other seasonings to any recipe! (Caraway seeds was with a chicken and potatoes recipe and the 'garlic bread' was for pasta) I'm gonna just keep using this recipe when I've decided at the last moment on a plan for dinner! Thanks for the recipe!

I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo without realizing it.  They probably could have been baked longer, but came out white and fluffy.  My husband couldn't stop eating them!

This recipe was super quick and pretty awesome. I made these with whole wheat flour for the additional fiber and other nutritional benefits. I added more milk due to this and they turned out really tasty, my husband wanted another, and he is very picky. They took about 20 minutes and I will probably add a little more mayo next time, just due to the whole wheat flour. 
Thanks for any easy recipe! Oh, and I did use the 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt sub.

I decided I would try this recipe just because it's so simple. Well I really like this recipe, but as a biscuit instead of a dinner roll because it has the perfect biscuit texture. It comes out so light and fluffy! I will be using other recipes for dinner rolls, but this is my new biscuit recipe for sure!

I followed a few suggestions for making self-rising dough from (flour, baking powder, and salt). I also threw in some garlic powder into the mix, sprinkled fresh rosemary on top of the rolls, which I'd set on a greased cookie sheet, and glazed with melted butter. In a convection oven, I baked for about 20 minutes, until the fork I used to test with came out of one of the rolls clean. They came out moist, flaky, and delicious! Thank you for the great base recipe!

Great base for adding any seasoning to match your meal.  Very moist, very easy, very fast.  I substituted 1 cup flour + 1 1/2 tsp baking powder for self rising flour.  No salt.

While there's nothing special about these they are super quick. They managed to be done in time to be enjoyed with dinner even though I started these after dinner was completed and everyone was about to sit down. Phew! With butter they are great and herbs would do a lot to help them but they were moist and everyone wanted more! :)

Life-saver in a pinch.  Bread tasted just fine...but as many others said, definitely a biscuit...not a dinner roll=)  Still sopped up our beef tips and gravy just fine!!!

These are good but I thought they were going to be rolls, and they are actually biscuits... I only had all-purpose flour so I added 1-1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.  I mixed them up in a minute or two and threw them in the oven with the rest of Easter dinner, also I think this recipe as written could have made six instead of five.  I didn't have any trouble getting them out of the pan but it was very well greased.  Also good for breakfast the next day and would be great for biscuits and country gravy :)

Delicious, fast, and easy!  Definitely more biscuit like, but sure crowd-pleasers when looking for a bread dish to go with a meal.  I made my own self-rise with the direction of others who posted here (1 cup flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking soda, and a pinch of sea salt) and they were great.  I also had a three cheese seasoning blend to give them a bit more flavor.  I also doubled the recipe and filled the entire 12-cupcake/muffin sheet.  Can't wait to make them again!

For a quick roll, very good.  Love the light and fluffyness of it.  Needs a bit more flavor but that's easy to fix by tossing in a few spices.

They were quick to throw together, which is what I was looking for. I did have to add seasonings in and on top in order to improve the flavor.

This is the craziest recipe ever.  My husband, kids and our/their friends LOVE these things.  They seem a little bland to me, but since my family wants to give them 5 stars, I'll go along.  Add garlic, cheddar cheese or berries to transform these miracle muffins.

I just took a batch out of the oven and they are great! I followed the recipe exactly only doubled and brushed melted butter on top. They are a cross between rolls and biscuits and mine didn't quite look the same as the picture but they are fluffy and wonderful! On a side note I used Miracle Whip not real mayonnaise.

Well, I still can't make rolls, no matter how easy.  I didn't have self rising so I subbed ingredients as others have indicated.  They were good, though.  I served them with Bill's Sausage Gravy from this site. I'll try them again.

This is a super quick recipe! I was very satisfied - even surprised - with the way they turned out. I've made them twice this week and both times, there were none left over. Everyone liked them. These are great for last-minute pull-togethers!  They tasted much like plain white bread rolls, but had more of a biscuit texture, which means you can do so much with them. I would recommend, if you want to jazz them up to go along with a hardy dinner, to add some garlic salt and shredded cheese on the top before baking. Or if you're looking for something sweet, try sprinkling a cinnamon/sugar mixture over the top before baking. But by themselves, these rolls proved to be a great find! I'll be using them often. Thanks for sharing!

What a great "go to" recipe when there's no bread in the house for dinner.  I need to double this recipe for my family of four, though, they go fast!  They're great with a pinch of dried rosemary!

Ly family loved this recipe.  There was not a single crumb left.  I did not put batter in a muffin pan.  I did, however, spoon them on a greased cokie sheet and they came out just as well!

Folks, don't look at the name, look at the recipe. No yeast means it's not a bread dough, which means IT'S NOT A DINNER ROLL. The closest thing to it is a muffin with no flavorings... it's not even a biscuit, because the fat isn't cut into the flour to create flakes.

Knowing what I really made, and judging it on that basis, these are actually pretty good. They're really quick and very tender. I'd use them as a quick starch side if I didn't feel like making real bread, or rice or potatoes; they're good for mopping up thin sauces or gravy. I wouldn't try to scoop up a chunky marinara with this, though; it would collapse and break under the weight.

These were so easy, but mine turned out a bit like biscuits. I think it's because I used the low fat mayo. They were still very yummy and I'll make them again.

I thought these were great.  I think the ease made me put the extra 5th star on the rating.  Very fast.  Great for someone who doesn't feel like spending FOREVER make rolls... very good.

These tasted just like flour. Not one of six people took more than one bite even after putting a generous amount of butter on them. The only positive thing I can say is they were quick.

I agree with the others, this has more of a biscuit consistency, but they were still really yummy. Very southern...I think they would be good with a big salad and fried chicken! Thanks for the easy recipe!

These were just okay to me.  They turned out somewhat gummy - maybe it was the flour.  I added some baking powder cuz I didn't have self rising...

These rolls taste great, especially right out of the oven with some butter.  They are not as attractive as the rolled kind, but who has time for that.  Ready in minutes without all the dirty dishes.

These rolls were ok - but nothhing great.  They were very easy though.  Turned out kind of like biscuits.  I'll probably try them again sometime when I'm in a pinch for last minute bread or when I'm in the mood for light biscuits.  Maybe try adding some shredded cheese, garlic or savory herbs.

OMG these are SO good and SO easy!  I love love love this recipe!  Because people mentioned they were bland, I went ahead and curdled my milk with vinegar.  Used regular flour with a scant T of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt.  I came out with enough for 6 beautiful bisci-rolls (which is what I'm going to calls these from now on ... beautifully soft interior like a roll, with a biscuity type exterior) using around 1 1/4oz per.  Baked at 400 for 10 minutes and they were perfectly done.  I LOVE these!  I went from pantry to out of oven in like 14 minutes.  Note to self, next time drop bp down to 1 1/2 tsp ... I'm getting a little aftertaste there.

I did as other reviewers suggested in subbing 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 heaping tablespoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Otherwise I left the recipe as is and baked for about 17-18 minutes. They came out fluffy and moist on the inside though they didn't brown much on top. With butter and jam or honey they were delicious - and SO EASY!

So easy and so good. We wanted rolls with dinner, but had very little on hand and these were perfect. They're more like biscuits. I was out of self-rising flour, so did the baking powder substitution and we didn't have regular mayo so used Miracle Whip. I mixed everything together with the milk and added 2 slices of crumbled up Colby-Jack, garlic salt, onion powder, and Italian seasoning. I spooned it into 6 muffin spots on my tin and baked for 9 minutes at 450°. To brown the tops a bit I broiled them for a couple minutes. They came out slightly crispy on the outside and chewy but not raw on the inside. Just right. So easy and with some additions, so dang good! Thank you!

Great basic idea... I added lots of veggies that I had that needed to be used, as well as a little Tabasco, garlic powder, Natures Season, and Italian Seasoning to spice things up. Like other reviews had said, it was a bit bland before.

Quick & Simple!! :-)
To make self rising flour: 1 cup flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt. I used butter & not mayonnaise, Im out of mayo for some reason & its my favorite condiment. I substituted butter & it turned out great but a little salty, I have to try it with mayo too though.

I'm making more now, minus the salt & dont forget to roll them or they turn out clumpy, there is no scooping involved.

These are yummy! I had to add baking soda and salt, and I used ranch dressing in place of mayo. They made light, fluffy, biscuits that my kids and DH devoured right up!

I can't say enough good things about these! They are sooo crazy easy and fast to make, I haven't bought a can of biscuits in the few months that I've been making these. I just make these to go along with most dinners. I do have to say that I would never consider the consistency of these as "rolls". They are definitely biscuits to me. But none the less, I'm addicted!!! Been making them like a crazy woman ;) thank you Miss Betty!

These were super easy and fast. And tasted just fine. I made one batch like the recipe says and another batch with dried rosemary, honey, and dried oregano. Even my 2 year old liked them. I will be making these again. (I also didn't have self rising flour, so I substituted 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt.)

These were very nice and quick.  Make sure you use enough milk and they will come out smooth like rolls.  Heavy on the mayo makes them moist.

super easy to make!  make sure to use self rising flour (oops) I'm a scratch cook so dont usually have it.  However, this second time making them properly, I added some sharp cheddar cheese and the consistency was perfect with soup and were great for drop in lunch folks.  Next time I'll add a bit of roasted garlic too.  Thanks for the recipe!  a keeper.

I have used this recipe for years.....it has been very popular with family and friends and I have shared this recipe many, many times.  The name is deceptive as they have the consistency of biscuits. They are especially yummy with soups & stews.  I first found this recipe in a "Clay County Homemakers Extension Club" cookbook. They call them Mayonnaise Rolls. They also make a great "starter" to add additional things to like different cheeses, minced garlic, diced ham or bacon. They are also good for easy "biscuits" for breakfast....baking while you prepare the other items.... Clean up is easy....one bowl and 1 pan! Enjoy!

It was quick and easy so I would give it a high rating for that, but it was too hard on the outside to classify as a roll so I would give it a low rating as a roll.  Therefore, to combine these 2 scores it gets a 3. I like a roll to be soft and easy to pull apart.  This was not like that.  It is a biscuit not a roll, and not a very good biscuit.  If you have a pinch on time, it might be alright but personally I don`t plan on making it again because my family did not care for it.  I make a lot of bread so my family knows good bread from bad and this just did not pass the taste test for my family.

My husband loves homemade bread of any sort, I cannot make anything that requires yeast! For some reason it NEVER works! I was so excited to try this recipe!!  I didn't have any self rising flour so I used SPUDUGAN's advice of the baking powder & salt! My husband LOVED them!!! I am making more as I type!! Thanks so much!

I forced myself to make these with mayo, as I am repelled by the idea of cooking with mayo- but they were good. Quick and easy and versatile. These came in handy when dinner was ready and I realized I had no bread to serve. By the time we sat at the table and passed the dishes around the oven was beeping with fresh bread rolls. :)
I'm never sure what to call them, though. They are kinda biscuit like. I scoop them with an ice cream scoop into mounds on a baking sheet. Good with shredded cheese.
EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE FOR BISQUICK if you are like me and don't buy boxed food. ( I also made my own SRFlour)
* if you don't want to use mayo, you can sub an egg and get a tender, dumpling-style roll.

These were a great fast rolls recipe.  Doubled the recipe and didn't have self rising flour so I used 2 cups all purpose flour with a tablespoon of baking powder and 1/8 tsp of salt.  I also added 2 tablespoons sugar to the recipe.  The family absolutely loved these and couldn't believe this was a "quick" recipe.  Definitely something we'll have again - delicious!

These little rolls were awesome! Very  moist and tasty. I listened to other reviewers when they said they were a bit bland tasting (I could see that if I didn't add anything extra) so added 1/4 tsp. rosemary. Delicious!

These were incredible! I love the biscuit texture! I made two batches. I used up all of my milk on the first batch, so I tried the second batch with water to replace the milk. I found out that I had to add about seven minutes to the baking time. Excellent recipe!

I love these!  I tripled the recipe and it made a baker's dozen.  I figured these would be great and they were!  With sunny-side up eggs, these made a fabulous meal my hubby and kids loved!  There are 11 of us and everyone wanted 2nds so next time I will have to make multiple triple batches.  I used a pampered chef muffin pan and one corelle wear tea cup to bake these in, and both methods were great.  One note though, they did take about 10 minutes longer to bake than stated but that could simply be an oven difference.  Thanks!

These weren't the best rolls I ever had and i'm a bread girl. Because I was having friends over and forgot to pick up some rolls I tried this quick recipe and they were indeed quick and easy. The taste equaled the effort. I poured melted butter and honey on top before removing from muffin pan.

Wonderfull! I made it as a late night snack (which I do often) A drizzle of honey gave it just a little bit of sweetness I wanted, and I made a small loaf rather than a roll. Came out great!

i made these for my daughter one day for a snack, except no one in my house can tolerate real dairy so i used vanilla soy milk, whole wheat flour, and baking powder, and 2 T apple sauce and when they were done put some all fruit jelly and they were the perfect healthy  snack.  for everyone that says there too bland its bread people what did you expect?

Not bad for a quick last minute bread. Although it doesn't use it in the ingredients, it almost tasted like packaged baking mix. Worth trying again with some tweaking. I think next time I will add some mix ins for flavor.

No self rising flour on hand, so I made my own out of whole wheat white flour, baking powder and salt. I just wisked together the dry ingredients before folding in the wet. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk because I had some that needed to be used. Good, but I think it could use some spices next time. We ate these rolls with homemade garlic spread, along with BBQ chicken and Bacon Ranch Pasta Salad.

This recipe is a lifesaver!!! It is a biscuit in my opinion. I doubled the recipe and since I didnt have self-rising flour I added 1 tsp. salt and 3 tsp. baking powder. We had the biscuits with bacon and eggs. Next time I would add some grated cheese and garlic powder. This recipe is a keeper for a super quick biscuit. A great recipe for kids too!!!

Wow! These are really good. I was a little surprised how good they are after reading all the reviews saying they are bland. I did make a few changes/additions to make these perfect... I used butter in place of the mayonaise and I added a teaspoon of dill and a tablespoon of fresh grated parmesean cheese. SO GOOD! Thank you!!!

With a few extra ingredients, my family compared these to Red Lobster's biscuits :) I didn't have self rising flour, so added 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and up to 1/2 tsp salt. Added a shake of garlic powder and onion powder and put some shredded "cheddar cheese with herbs" in as well (bought special from a cheese store). I think just regular mild cheddar would do. Picture of the end product: http://tinyurl.com/4ujffdw  My new favorite recipe! Very easy and quick :)

I gave some quirks to it, because we didn't have mayonnaise. One I made with tomato sauce and Italian seasoning, and then one with ranch dressing. I made two others that didn't turn out so well, because I just used some extra milk. I had homemade self rising flour, so if I were to make the ranch one again, I would omit the salt.  They were excellent!

I have struggled with finding a quick and easy dinner roll recipe for so long.  But no more!  These are super easy and delicious and even I couldn't mess them up.  :)  I added sharp cheddar cheese and garlic powder and they tasted a lot like a famous seafood place's famous cheddar biscuits.  Thank you so much for sharing this!  Our whole family loved it!

Very tasty! I was nervous trying this, but so glad I did.  I am allergic to yeast, so I had to learn to make do without regular bread. This is a fabulous alternative. Yes, a bit more like a biscuit, but you could still spice these up and serve them as a dinner roll without any problems. Thank you so much!

These rolls are sooooo good! I didn't believe my eyes when I saw that it only took 20 min.! And if you're wondering if you can taste the mayonnaise, you can't; well at least I didn't. I recommend these rolls if you are looking for an extremely quick and delicious side food.

Five stars for Quick, Easy and Moist rolls!  So soft!! I added 1/2c white and 1/2 wheat (not the self rising) (I made my own and used the 1c flour and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt)  I also tried the mayo for one batch and then Extra Virgin Olive oil for another (2tbs) and they came out great too. I will make these again and again. You can really spice them up with italian herbs and cheese or you can throw a dash of sugar in there and then use a fruit spread on top! YUMMY!

Definitely more biscuit-like than dinner rolls, but I liked them. Reminded me of the KFC biscuits.  Will make again but maybe play around with the recipe and add different spices.

Easy and Yummy! I took the advice of other reviewers and used the sugg. substitution for self rising flour so I could use all purpose. I also added some garlic powder, rosmary, and a pinch of ranch dressing. It tasted very flavorful, but next time I might try it without some of the additions (it was all just very strong once I added all the spices).

So easy, so moist, so yummy! These rolls get extra points for being so versatile, too-- they might be a little boring for some tastes to start, but the possibilities for customization are endless. A regular in our house.

I will be using this versatile recipe for many years to come. I'm not sure what you have to do to make it look like the photo, though. Mine looked like lumpy Bisquick biscuits. Maybe I was supposed to push the dough down into the muffin pan? Or maybe it had something to do with the high altitude baking conditions. Also, they didn't brown, but I didn't care. They were delicious with apple butter. I plan on trying them with ham and cheese, garlic, jam, you name it. Very quick and easy.

Okay, if you are expecting traditional rolls, you will be disappointed. BUT! if you are looking for the best biscuit recipe ever...this is it! These are light & fluffy but still have the body of a true biscuit. I have made with self rising flour, and flour with baking powder added. It is worth picking up some self rising flour, it eliminates the baking powder aftertaste. I use the larger muffin cups and adjust baking time to a little over 20 minutes. Watch carefully as the tops do not get the "deep brown" color you would find with others. I throw these together, (it is that quick) to serve with stews, creamy or potato soups, and OMG try them on a Sunday morning with "Bill's Sausage Gravy" from this site. Pure heaven. I double the recipe and get 5-6 larger biscuits, maybe 10 in the standard cupcake pan. One last note..most recipes are good for the day you bake them, these hold the same moistness for 2 days of use, no kidding:)

This is like my all time favorite recipe. A golden find on this website. The recipe is so versatile. I add sugar sometimes, spices. Depending on what I am serving these with. This is quicker than buying dinner rolls and popping them in the oven. Thanks so much for sharing.

I also used all purpose flour, 1 1/2 cups, 2 1/4 bp, & 3/4 salt, I used sour cream instead of mayo and added 2 tsps of sugar. (8 rolls) very good!

I make these about 2x a week---great quick bread with just about any dinner--really good with pot roast and stews because the consistency holds up better than rolls. Thanks!!

Great quick and easy biscuit. Made them exactly as stated. They are more like a T Biscuit consistency. My husband loved them with molasses. Will definitely make them again.

These were so easy to make, and so good.  I added some melted butter to the tops before baking and they came out tasting a lot like KFC biscuits, but not as flaky.  Will be making these a lot!!!

the perfect "in a pickle" recipe for dinner rolls. they were a little dense, but it was expected because of the lack of yeast. I did follow the betty crockers substitute for the flour. All in all - i'll use it again and thank you, Betty!

Very good and very easy! Made them twice in the last 3 days. I, too, used the self-rising flour substitute. I did have to bake them 20 minutes and turned the oven up to 375 the last 5 minutes to get them to brown on tops. Great as a quick bread side for any home-cooked meal.

This recipe is a keeper!  It was so quick and everyone loves fresh baked breads for dinner.  Add sea salt, but other than that don't change a thing for perfect rolls every time.

I really was surprised by this recipe, I didn't have very many ingredients on hand, but needed a roll quick.  I agree with other reviews this is definitely more like a bisquit, but very good!  I doubled the recipe and used baking powder and salt like others because I didn't have self rising flour.  Very moist and good! Thanks!

I wanted a small snack but was out of bread and had my mind set on it. I decided to do a "quick roll" search and this came up. Three ingredients, no kneading and 15 mins cooking time?! Perfect! I didn't have self rising flour so I used 1 C. all purpose flour, 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt. These didn't turn out like bread rolls but were more like a soft bisquit-like "muffin". It served it's purpose wonderfully though! They were tender and almost melt in your mouth. I filled it with Cajun chicken breast, chopped lettuce and onions, a small bit of ketchup and hot sauce. This was quite the unexpected treat and I will be making these again! Thanks for the recipe.

These things are awesome! Just made a batch and have to make another one for dinner b/c I ate the whole first batch. Mine had garlic and oregano and I had to bake them for like, 25 minutes to get them browned on top and ooh la la!  They're totally those "biscuity" things you can't get enough of at red lobster.  Miss Betty rocks!!!

They turned out to be more of a biscuit than a roll, but they were pretty yummy and easy to make. I did add some grated cheese to the mixture though. Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe because I ran out of yeast to make my regular rolls.  They were pretty good.  Really simple and easy, we ate them with butter and honey.  I don't think I'll make them as dinner rolls again though.  But they'd be great with sausage gravy for breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe.

yes beware these "rolls" have a runny batter and do come out like muffins.  However that said that are tastey and great in a pinch for rolls.  Wonderful for soup as well. We liked them and plan to make them again

These are dense, heavy rolls that are quick and easy to prepare using basic ingredients. I used the self-rising flour recipe on this site since I don't keep that type of flour on hand. A similar recipe in a book I had recommended adding 2 T. sugar, but I added only 1.

It’s was easy and fast but I must have done something wrong. It’s an ok Baking powder biscuit. It took longer than 15 minutes to bake. After 20 minutes it was dense in the middle. Didn’t puff up.  I will make it again and hope for better results

I used whole wheat flour (was not self-rising, so I added 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp garlic salt), just added a little dash of thyme. It came out great! Very moist on the inside. Definitely will make again!

When someone says "dinner roll" it implies a roll that is light and fluffy with a "bread" type texture.  These are biscuits.  hard on the outside and a crumbly texture.  Unfortunately, I didn't even think they were a good tea biscuit.  bottom line... if you want a dinner roll, you will need to use a recipe with yeast.  If you want a tea biscuit, there are much better recipes out there.  I was really disappointed with this one but serves me right because "good" can't be rushed....

Very yummy! I didn't have self raising flour so I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder like another reviewer said. I also added some grated Parmesan cheese to the dough. Turned out really good.

Boy are these super easy and forgiving! I only had all purpose flour and baking soda, so I added some vinegar to the soda, sprinkled in some dry yeast for good measure, and hoped for the best. They puffed up and browned beautifully! And my husband liked them a lot considering he doesn't like mayo. Five minutes before they were done, I sprayed them with olive oil and topped with rosemary, garlic powder, and some salt and put them back in to brown. These will be my emergency go to rolls, for sure.

These turned out exactly like the Bisquick biscuits that I usually make! I  followed another reviewer's suggestion for a substitute for self-rising flour (as I don't usually buy it), but other than that, I followed the "base" recipe as is. I also added some shredded Cheddar, garlic powder and parsley flakes to the mix before adding the wet ingredients. Then, halfway through baking, I brushed some melted butter over the tops and sprinkled on a bit of Parmesan. Delicious! And surprisingly MOIST! I may have to stop buying Bisquick from now on! Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe and added a little less than 1/4cup white sugar. Made them in a small muffin pan and loved the outcome!

It's very rare that I repeat a recipe I've found on here twice in one month, but I fell in love with this! These are all ingredients I always have on hand, which makes this my new go-to roll recipe. I did the all purpose flower with the 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt substitution, then I thew in a bit of shredded cheddar cheese and rosemary, and OMG... it's soooooo good!!! My husband also can't get enough of these. It's almost like a super easy knock off cheddar bay biscuit.

Very impressive! These are very close to Bisquick drop biscuits & easier! I did not have self-rising flour so used the recommendation of salt & baking powder, though I will use less salt next time. I also added some fresh rosemary, but will make them plain next time so my young men can eat them with butter & jelly for breakfast! Very good, fast & easy!

I really liked this recipe, I have made it twice now.  Super easy!  I used 1% milk and lite mayo.  It was nice to have a recipe that only made 5, since I was only making it for myself and my husband.  They were moist and not crumbly.  My husband thought they were a little gooey.  Maybe I should have baked them another minute or two.

This is and UNBELIEVABLY great biscuit/roll!  I also used regular (130 grams, sifted) flour, adding 1tsp baking powder and 1/2tsp kosher salt. I used my UNFAVORITE mayo -- Dave's and added a packet of splenda.  It added a little depth to the flavor.  Mixed everything until JUST combined, then sprayed 4 ramekins with TJ's natural butter spray, dropped in the dough (not smoothing it) and tossed them in the 350 oven.  They needed more than 15 min.  I just kept checking them every three minutes. I took them out when all the visible dough had some golden color, and the sides that were touching the ramekin became golden, too!  I think the natural butter spray was KEY.  These rolls are tender, moist, with a crunchy top...  just PERFECT and brilliantly simple.

If you called these quick and easy biscuits and added some salt, it would be a 5 star recipe.  These are NOT dinner rolls at all, but if you need some quick biscuits and don't want to use a ton of butter or shortening, give these a try.  I don't understand the reviews that say they didn't rise.  Mine rose beautifully.  Make sure you are using self-rising flour or adding baking powder and salt to your all purpose flour.  Flavor wise, as a biscuit, all this recipe needed was a little salt.

I've made these following the recipe exactly, and I've made them other times adjusting it a little. It's a great recipe and delicious either way! 
Here's how I adjust them:
  I didn't have any self-rising flour so I used regular with 1 tsp baking powder.  I also only used 2/3c flour and 1/3c wheat flour. Plus I added about 1 tsp of salt and 1/2tblsp sugar.  I know some reviews said this was a bland recipe but I thought they tasted great. I think they really needed salt.  Overall,  with cooking time, it took me about 40 minutes to make.  I will definitely be making these again.

I found they 'needed  something' as they were a bit dry. Could I add a tiny bit more milk and maybe a bit of sugar? I'm new at this.

I saw the reviews and summed this up to have no flavor. So I added to this to test it out like a trial run. So I added half a stick of melted better 1 table spoon of sugar,1 egg, and a dash of salt.  I only had five to test out on everybody. They were yummy. So I am still working it out because I know they could be better but the ones I created were great though. I am going to keep playing around with it.

This is a very easy recipe. I substituted buttermilk for milk and added 1 tblsp of sugar per 1c of flour and everyone loved them. They were very moist and fluffy. I was going to take pictures but they disappeared too fast!

Even for a biscuit recipe as opposed to a dinner roll, this was bland. I added garlic powder and Parmesan cheese to the top, which helped.

I have made these rolls several times since the first time I tried them and they are delicious!!  I always triple the recipe so that we have some for breakfast the next morning because to me they are more like biscuits than rolls.  I will continue to make for both meals because they are so good and easy to make!!!

This recipe is super quick to make - only 3 ingredients.  I baked them in my mini muffin pan and got 12 rolls.  Although, they have a biscuit consistency rather than a roll as the recipe title calls them.

I have been making these for years when I find myself short on time and groceries.  If you approach this recipe as a basic biscuit rather than a dinner roll, I think you will not be surprised by the result.  I always use a fine whole wheat flour with baking powder (1 t) and salt (1/2 t).  I've tried many add-ins, but typically go with cracked pepper and garlic.  I also pat them lightly into balls and bake them on a pizza stone at about 400 for 15 minutes.  I simply think they look better this way.  Thank you, Miss Betty!

These were very good. I made chili for dinner and did not have any corn bread or Hawaiian bread (our usual go-to breads for chili). I found this recipe and threw it together quickly. I used Olive Oil mayo. I doubled the recipe, adding 1 cup of colby jack shredded cheese and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. As soon as my husband took the first bite I knew they were a hit when he said "Mmmmmm these are good!" My extremely picky 18 yr old son ate several of them. These a definite keeper in this house. They do have more of a biscuit texture but were perfect with chili!

Simple yet great recipe. I added garlic and rosemary and these biscuits were AMAZING. I was a little disappointed that the tops didn't brown, but i quickly forgot why I was upset upon tasting. I didn't use the muffin pan, i just made 5 drop biscuits on a cookie sheet.

I was so happy to find these super quick and easy rolls to go with dinner tonight.  I had to use the substitutions for self-rising flour and perhaps I didn't add enough salt but I found them bland also. But - the texture is great and they're so fast that I'll try some of the suggestions listed to add a bit more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best 15 minute rolls I've tried.  4 stars though since they are really more like biscuits.

This has to be one of the easiest recipes. I added rosemary to mine and it actually turned out quite good. No fuss and you cannot go wrong with this recipe.

These are really more like biscuits than rolls, but they were sufficient for our needs. Served them with soup.

I thought these were just great. I got my 8year old daughter to mix them up. They were so easy especially compared to the hassle of yeast rolls! I didnt think they lacked flavor and the texture was perfect -lovely and soft without being cake like. I think it would be easy to play around with flavor by adding herbs and cheese etc another time but i certainly didnt think they tasted bad. I think this is a useful recipe that I will use again and again when i want rolls with soup etc.

While these were very quick, they weren't very good. They didn't ever brown, so I cooked them a few minutes longer thinking maybe it was just my oven, which essentially turned them into rocks. Rocks that tasted like biscuits, not dinner rolls. They would work in a pinch if you really needed a bread, but remember, they taste like biscuits, not dinner rolls- and I used self rising flour. I tripled the batch, which was a good thing, because I barely got 12 'muffins' out of it (I have 6 to feed). I had found a dinner roll recipe a few years ago that had mayo in it and it was great, I tried to find it again- this wasn't it.

I don't see what the problem is.  This is a quick means to make bread.  Yes, it is nothing more than a biscuit in muffin form.  What else would expect without a yeast dough?  Next time I will add some herbs or cheese to zip it up a bit, but it is what it is.

I was a little  apprehensive to try these with the mixed reviews.  Followed the recipe without any tweaking, and was pleased with the result.  Yes they are closer to a biscuit than a dinner roll, but with no yeast that's what you would expect.  For a quick and easy bread serving, this is great.

Fantastic! Scaled recipe for 6, used 1/4 c. whole wheat flour (the rest white), added 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp rosemary to go with what we were having. Family loved them! Definitely a keeper!!

Sorry to say this but I don't know how anyone can give these more than 1 star. You must not have any taste buds. Even though I added some seasoning. I'm embarrassed to serve them to my family. You're better off getting in the car and driving to your local bakery. Also, my 2 yr old even said they are "yucky". She usually eats anything!

I honestly don't know what was nice about this one, please respectfully I ask don't give five stars unless something is outstandingly good, I know everyone has their opinion but this definitely doesn't even deserve a star. I mean compare this to clone of a cinabon or Amish white bread ok the later is just bread but it's a five star bread , if you know what I mean

I'm giving this four stars only because, as many users have indicated, the "rolls" are much more like biscuits than dinner rolls. The texture was almost cake-like because it was so airy; definitely not a dinner roll! That being said, as biscuits they are a very quick and easy recipe that I intend to make again.  I added a tablespoon of rosemary, a tablespoon of dried onions, and a teaspoon of garlic powder and they turned out delicious.

I can't understand how anyone could like the texture of these rolls and the color. I made two batches and both never browned. I added 1tsp of italian seasoning and the flavor was okay but I definatley will not make this recipe again.

5 SOLID stars from me.  I made them the other day to go with stew and they are UBER easy to make but they had a "biscuit" texture and not the dinner roll feel and texture I was hoping for.  I WILL make these again due to how FAST they came together and the taste was great.  I would only rate them 4 stars but the entire recipe as a whole gets 5 stars and let me also say for feeding 2 people this is PERFECT as scaling down recipes gets old sometimes.  THANKS for posting this!

Loved them! They are a bit more like biscuits than I expected but they are super light and fluffy.  Instead of two Tb. mayo I put 1 tb. mayo and 1 tb. butter.  They turned out great.  Will make again.  Thanks!

This is a great quick and easy recipe for rolls. I took the advise of another and seasoned them a bit.  I added some Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and grated Romano cheese. They went perfect with our soup.

Great, especially with some garlic powder and shredded cheddar cheese! Just a little doughy tasting, though, so 4 out of 5 stars.

I'm glad to have found this recipe. My family typically buys store-brought dinner rolls, which we did not have on hand tonight, and we never have yeast in the house. I had to make some adjustments, like most others I added some salt and baking power (1 and 1/4 tsp) bc I did not have self-rising flour. I also used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise. I had to make some adjustments to the temperature and time to fit my stove. That's a personal issue with my stove though. Otherwise, these ended up perfect. I do think they taste a little bit more like biscuits, than dinner rolls, but I did not mind it so much. I think it's a plus, it makes the recipe more versatile so that you could use these for Sunday morning breakfast as well as dinner. I topped these with the usual butter and jelly and enjoyed - a little too much thogh because I ended up eating more than I intended!

This recipe by itself is EXTREMELY bland, but the simplicity definitely makes up for it. I'll try this again next time adding other ingredients like cheese or something...should be okay after!

This is a great quick roll recipe.  I added just a little shake of garlic powder and next time I think I'll add just a little bit of grated cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were slightly easier than making biscuits or yeast rolls, but not as good as either.  I ate them up, but won't be making them again.

Very easy to make. I added cheddar cheese and I also used the all purpose flour w/salt & baking powder substitute.  Delicious! They are definitely a biscuit not a roll. I would make them again.

This recipe is just great.  It is a mixture of a dinner roll and a biscuit that is a nice surprise.  I have made it several different times now and have added this and that to change it, I seem to go back to the basic recipe because it is good just as is. Thanks for sharing

These were completely unremarkable. My husband asked why I didn't just make bisquick biscuits as they were much better.  Maybe adding some salt/pepper/herbs would make a difference, but on its own this recipe is not really worth it.

Although it was very quick to make and did rise surprisingly well, the taste was very salty and only pleasant if smothered in jam.  Perhaps decreasing the mayonaise or using another kind of fat would be helpful.

I give it points for being a fast, last minute "bread", but I wasn't a fan of the taste. They were fluffy and more biscuit like, but still made a nice accompaniment to a potato corn chowder.

I'm surprised, these were really quite good. I wasn't actually expecting something so easy to work. But they were perfect for some last minute, quick rolls for just my husband and I. I did as some other reviewers suggested and added 1 and 1/2 t. of baking powder and 1/2 t. of salt since I didn't have self rising flour, and i put in 1 T. of mayo and 1 T. of ranch salad dressing for some extra flavour.

THE BEST "Super Quick" dinner rolls that I have ever made! So easy and so fast! I will use this recipe again and again!  I don't stock self rising flour in my pantry so I did use the substitute recommended on this site of 7/8 c. flour, 1 1/2 t. baking powder & 1/2 t. salt.  Mine puffed up real nice!  Thanks for the recipe!

Help please ...

I've made these rolls a dozen times in the last month and they have been fabulous.

The last two nights they didn't rise.

I used the conversion button on the recipe to make 24 this time.

I was out of self-rising flour so used the recipe from this site:

1 cup all-purpose flour 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 

and adjust the amounts accordingly.

Does baking powder have a limited life span?  There isn't an expiry date on the container.

I used a new jar of mayonnaise and have used a creamy salad dressing in the past with no problem.

Any suggestions?  I want to use this recipe regularly but my house guests aren't going to approve of a third failure.

Many thanks.

Wow!  I always wait till the last minute & then remember the rolls.  With this recipe it's no big deal.  I also use spelt flour for everything.  It came out great.  I just added the 1 tsp. salt & 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder per cup of flour.

I carefully followed directions as well as others suggestions a 2nd time around.  Please forgive me if for being honest but I agree w/ ZOPOOH in saying that they tasted like raw flour even after putting on butter!

This tastes just like the egg McMuffin without the butter. I used Veganaise (soy mayo) and Silk (soymilk) as substitutes for the mayo and milk to make this recipe even healthier. After they cooked, I scooped Boca sausage, Morningstar bacon, and organic cheese slices on top of the sliced biscuit. Warmed it up in the microwave and everyone (including a 1 year old, 2 year old, and my husband) loved it. Husband has his with an egg. Next time I will try baking them with the cooked filling inside the biscuit.

Easy and quick. I would like to try with jam in the middle like one reviewer did. If you are looking for "rolls" keep looking, if you want a quick bread to go with some comfort food then this is it. Will make again!

Well lets just say that I thought the recipe sounded a little tasteless so I decided to sprinkle the tops before baking with parmesan cheese and poppy seeds.  When finished we all decided that the topping didn't help.  But all is not lost ladies, these would make great fluffy breakfast biscuits to serve with milkgravy.

These are alright, my kids didn't like them. If you're looking for a dinner roll these are not the way to go but if you want more of a biscuit, these are ok.

These rolls were quick & easy to make. The texture is a bit chewy but my family liked them.
