I love this!  I like to use a small cookie scoop or melon baller and freeze them on a cookie sheet.  Then I put them into a zip lock bag and store in the freezer. You can take out 1 or 2 as needed.  Tastes great on vegetables, in pasta sauce, spread on corn or bread.  Yummy!

RECIPE GROUP:  The lemon came through a little stronger than I had anticipated, so next time I would either decrease the lemon or add another pinch of sugar so the flavors complement each other better. 
Thank you Mommumma!

I liked this but thought the lemon juice was just a bit overpowering.  I will probably make it again but cut the lemon juice in half.   And yes!  It is good on corn on the cob!

I left out the sugar and salt and it is SO good!  This keeps really well and for quite a while in the refrigerator.  It's good on fresh bread, toast, baked potatoes, steamed veggies and eggs.

Recipe Group Selection:  11, July 2015 ~  We really enjoyed this butter on Italian bread, Italian bread broiled and on corn on the cob.  I took a hint from Christina, regarding the lemon juice and did cut it back.  With that suggestion, this was perfect.  We like the flavor and it is a summer butter that I would make again.

I used one clove of garlic, no sugar, and I didn't use the food processor, just finely chopped everything and mixed well.  Wrapped in plastic wrap and refrigerated until ready for use.  Served on steaks, and homemade garlic bread.  Thanks!

This was great.. and terrible because it made me go through a whole stick of butter so fast! Because of the other reviews, I decreased how much lemon juice I put in it, which was a wise decision. I think next time I will roast the garlic before adding it because I put extra cloves and it was a tiny bit sharp. I feel like roasting the garlic will get rid of that and add more depth to the flavor. I put this spread on bread, corn, anything I could find an excuse to put this on.

I made this exactly as noted. I spread it on crusty Italian bread and make grilled cheese with it. My family won't eat a grilled cheese now unless I use this butter! So perfect.

I love this butter! As other's suggested, I reduced the amount of lemon. This is one of those recipes that tastes better a day or two later allowing the flavors to blend. For me, the ingredient flavors seemed to flow, one by one, as I could taste each of them. Great on toast and biscuits!

Like other reviewers I used a little less lemon juice, and I left out the salt and sugar. I just had to add a good AllRecipes crossover: I made the Basic Crepes on this site with two tablespoons melted basil butter. Then I got to eat very, very yummy mushroom and bacon stuffed herb crepes. I win!

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. My husband ate it like ice cream!I used a cookie scoop to make individual pats that are the perfect size for a single serving.

This butter will brighten your pastas and starchy vegetables in a flash! Try brushing it on calzones or pizza crust after they are pulled from oven. Itâ€™s a keeper in our family.

Fabulous and easy!   However next time I will probably use a bit less salt but that is just a personal choice as the recipe is fine as written.

I must have overprocessed the ingredients because I ended up with green butter.  Tasted ok but not very appealing to the eye.

After I scraped this out of the food processor, I couldn't help but lick the spatula...oh, yum! Great flavor. I used half the salt called for, and my butter was unsalted. Put it on tonight's veggie medley but want to try it on some good fresh bread--will be keeping some of this on hand all summer, thanks so much for the recipe!

Made this for Recipe Group...This was very good, but we thought the lemon was a bit too much (I wish I would've read through the reviews first), so I would reduce that next time. This tasted nice on our corn on the cob. I would make this again (reducing the lemon juice). Thanks for sharing. :)

Wow! This is delicious. I made it to serve with corn on the cob, but it would be great on lots of other things--pasta, bread, vegetables. I almost didn't add the sugar but after tasting it I thought it would help balance out the lemon juice, and it did. I added probably less than a 1/4 tsp. of sugar for a double batch.

I used lime juice instead of lemon juice.  Next time I'd leave out the sugar and salt, as it tastes a bit salty.  I'll just tell everyone not to salt their corn until they taste it! Definitely will make again with the slight changes.
