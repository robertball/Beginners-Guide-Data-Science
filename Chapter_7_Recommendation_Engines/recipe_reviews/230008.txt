These were wonderful!  Better than Girl Scout cookies.  The amount of mint was just perfect, not too much, not too little.  The dough did seem a little too soft, so I added another 1/2 of flour, or enough so that the dough had the consistency of chocolate chip cookie dough.  I used a 1 inch scoop which made perfect, round cookies (About sixty of them), and they were light, buttery, and crisp on the edges while still managing to be chewy on the inside.  They had the perfect thickness- not too flat.  Perfection!!!

These cookies were good!  I love chocolate & mint.  I don't like my cookies flat though so I added 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour.

Very easy (no curve balls on the measurements) and VERY delicious! Mine took longer than 10-12 minutes; just keep adding intervals of five!

This is a really good recipe…makes a very chewy delicious , chocolaty cookie. An easy way to make it more minty is to use mint chocolate chips which you can find at many grocery stores.
Great Recipe!

I was hoping these would be like those my Grandma used to make ahead and freeze.  They were not. We tripled the peppermint extract and did half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips.  They were boring.  Not very minty, not very chocolatey. Definitely won't make again...

These are good.  Nearly didn't make it because of the heading that says peanut butter, chocolate and mint?  EUUUUWWWW.  Fortunately the recipe doesn't have peanut butter.

I've made this twice now.  Once with ingredient amounts listed and once with more flour, like some suggested.   They both are tasty.  Just depends on if you like flat (flour as stated) or bumpy (extra flour) cookies :)  They are very soft and fluffy and TASTY!

These are amazing - sorry no picture because they didn't last long enough. The only thing I changed was that I didn't add the mint extract. I added an extra tsp of vanilla and it was just perfect. I will be making these again just as soon I run to the store to purchase more chocolate chips.

Amazing! These cookies were easy to make and- like the title states- extremely addictive. I followed another reviewer's advice and added 1/4 cup flour to a single batch and 1/2 cup for a double batch. If you don't, the cookies end up extremely flat, which is not our preference, though they still have good flavor. Thanks for sharing, youngcow!

My whole family loves these cookies. I also love that I can use wheat flour and ground flaxseed, nobody seems to notice or care.

First try out I used 1.5 ml peppermint oil, gluten free flour and 3/4 cup butter. The end result was a cookie that was OK tasting and semi-soft but the fat content needs to be increased as the GF flour dries things out; the cookies didnt spread out when baking, they stayed as mini-balls. Not a loss, but a lesson learned.

They're really good! I didn't have mint flavoring so I used mint chip and it was perfect. I think next time I will take the advice of another review and try adding more flour for fluffier cookies.
