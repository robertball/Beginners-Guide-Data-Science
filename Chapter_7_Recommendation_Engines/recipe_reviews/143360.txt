I debated between 4 and 5 stars.  Here is the reason why:  The taste was very good but it was too wet.  Even following the directions of using paper towel to drain excess juice from the strawberries I still had to keep adding more flour in order to be able to knead it.  I must have added at a minimum about 1/2 cup of flour.  I did so a little at a time as I was feeling for it to become the right consistency to allow kneading.  The end result was delicious!

These are amazing!!!  I replaced milk with buttermilk and added mini white chocolate chips.  I didn't need the dough.  I just scooped it onto individual scones.  The batter was wet but scoopable.  It yield 14 scones.

These were excellent.  I didn't have cream or lemons on hand the first time I made them, so I substituted 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt for the cream and vanilla (second time used 1/2 cup strawberry yogurt).  This also made them a bit healthier.  In place of the lemon zest, I added a little lemon juice to the powdered sugar glaze I made.  The dough was very crumbly when I dumped it onto the counter because yogurt is thicker than cream.  It didn't mix in as well, so I had to mix it by hand on the counter to make sure the moisture was evenly distributed.   I made these for my wife for Mother's Day breakfast, and she LOVED them.

I have made this recipe several times now. The first time I made it just as written and although it was very yummy the dough was wet. The strawberries you use directly effect the outcome! If you have very ripe sweet berries you will get a wet and yummy dough, if you get some that rea not so ripe you will have less trouble with moisture but the taste will not be as good. My final solution was to use a combination of dried strawberries and dried strawberry flavored crasins. YUM! Also faboo with dried blueberries. (Be sure to mince them a bit so they are not so big.)

I made Fresh Peach Scones.  Because the peaches were crisp, I did not have to worry about extra moisture!  I really liked the consistency of the dough and the taste of the nutmeg in this.  This is the recipe I would choose to use for Peaches and Cream Scones!

I made a slight variation of these by using a cup of oats ground instead of 1 c of flour.  I also reduced the butter to 3 T.  They usually only have to cook for about 14 min, watch them closely.  My husband loves strawerry muffins, and thought these were delicious.

These were great! I pretty much followed the recipe to a T. I did not knead the dough as long as suggested, nor did I add much more flower. The dough was quite sticky and lumpy (not smooth) when I placed it on the baking sheet with parchment.  I was worried that too much flour and kneading would toughen it.  In the end they had a lumpy appearance, but were wonderful none the less.  (Always use fresh baking soda.. discard an open can after 8-12 months.)

Delicious! I also didn't knead the dough too much. I find that to get the consistency that I like (which is similar to a flaky biscuit); the dough can't be over worked. Also, keep your butter and cream cold! After adding the vanilla to the cream, put it back in the fridge. Keep the butter in the fridge (or even the freezer if you want) until it's time to use.  Oh, and I love the nutmeg in this!

They looked wonderful, but were not very flavorful.  Needs more strawberry flavor.

I am debating between a 4 and 5 for this.   I cooked for about 15 minutes, and they were very moist scones. I like them this way, so it was great, but not exactly what I usually expect from scones.  I substituted the cream for vanilla yoghurt, and a little bit of half and half. I also used a little more salt then it called for.  Did not have a blender, so I just chopped the butter into very small cubes. This turned out fine, but I did have to add a little extra yoghurt. Also, dough was very wet, but this still turned out fine, I just couldn't really cut it, more just shape it.  Very very tasty.

I followed the recipe, but used whole wheat flour, substituted the strawberries for blackberries, omitted the lemon zest and added 2 tablespoons of blueberry yogurt. The scones turned out moist and had a nice wheat texture to them. Served with a little honey, it makes for a delicious, filling breakfast!

Just made scones for the first time... these were fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly except for the lemon zest, but the scones tasted amazing. Might be my new favorite thing to bake!

Simply gooey, unkneadable dough that requires extra flour but still doesn't work very well. These things certainly don't bake in 16 minutes! As far as taste goes, they're dull. I didn't like the nutmeg either.

Glad I read the reviews first.  I used 1/3 cup half and half instead of the 1/2 cup called for and it worked fine.  Really great flavor probably because of the fresh strawberries.  I think I still like the Simple Scones recipe on this site better even though that recipe calls for an egg and more butter.  I might make this again.

I used raspberries and AHHH what a disaster. Don' do it! I had to add soooo much extra flour because the dough was way too wet and then they turned a gray color because of the raspberries mixing in. I don't think I would try this recipe again even with strawberries.

I used light raspberry yogurt instead of cream and orange instead of lemon. The dough was a little wet making it hard to work with but the end result was delicious and I would recommend this!

Though I substituted buttermilk for the cream and added a little too much, making the dough too moist, these were still a hit.  I also substituted grated orange peel for the lemon, but the scones didn't suffer for it.  I'm glad to have my own strawberry plants; no doubt I'll make these with every crop!

while these were pretty good, there were also a few problems. first, they are way too sweet to be authentic scones. while the lemon zest was a nice touch, it was sort of overwhelmed by the nutmeg. should i try them again, i will cut the sugar in half, eliminate the nutmeg, and substitute buttermilk for the cream.

I just made these scones and they were DELICIOUS! Very moist and flavorful.  I didn't have nutmeg or light cream on hand.  I used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon instead of nutmeg and for the cream I used 1/2 cup of half and half mixed with 2 tbsp of melted butter.  I LOVED the hint of cinnamon and highly recommend it!  
As other reviews have stated, the dough is too wet to knead or to cut into shapes.   Instead of putting it in a round cake pan and cutting it, I just scooped the batter onto the baking sheet and formed the scones there.

I made a glaze that I spooned on top of the scones once they were out of the oven.  Just used powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, and a little lemon zest- it was the perfect touch!  I wil DEFINITELY be making these again!

If you are looking for fresh berry flavor then skip this recipe. I used fresh, delicious berries from my back yard and the flavor of nutmeg completely overpowered the strawberries. Also, I think 1 1/2 t of lemon zest is too much. 1t or even 1/2 t would be plenty. I did, however like the consistency of the scone. Very light and crumbly. If I were to make them again I would leave out the nutmeg, cut the amount of zest, and leave the strawberries in bigger hunks to maximize their flavor. After all, isn't that the idea of a fresh strawberry scone?

I substituted blueberries. I also had to add extra  cream.  It just didnt hold together enough to take it out of the bowl in 1 piece. Also I only kneaded 4 or 5 times ( not minutes).  Cut it with a pizza cutter, so much easier for me. Baked it on parchment paper. It was so good! I made blackberry scones too and they were amazing! This recipe is a keeper!

Very good, but I'm trying to figure out what would make it GREAT!  I did not knead.  I try to keep my hands OUT of scones/biscuits as much as possible.  Just get it to hold together and cut.  I'm going to try again with some orange zest this time and perhaps a little glaze...

What a great scone recipe!  Made these for the first time to take to a meeting this morning and everyone raved about how good they were and many requested the recipe.  They were flavorful and moist.  Definitely a keeper!  Like other reviewers stated, I never knead the dough for biscuit type breads.

After reading reviews about the dough being sticky, I didn't use the full amount of cream. I just added a little at a time until I got the consistency I wanted. I didn't knead the dough for as long as suggested either. My unexpected visitors really enjoyed these. Thankyou Annie.

I used orange peel instead of lemon and heavy cream instead of light and they turned out fine. Whenever I make scones, I skip the kneading and just spoon the dough on the parchment. They still taste great and have a pleasant texture. Thanks for this fun use of my summer strawberries!

This is a wonderful recipe and translates well to Gluten Free. I substituted 1 1/2 cup Bob's Red Mills 1 to 1 flour, plus 1/2 cup Corn Starch and 1/2 tsp guar gum. The key is to have really fresh, ripe, flavorful berries.

Delicious and simple! Followed the recipe except I didn't have light cream, and we only keep skim milk in the house, so I mixed 1/2 skim with 1/2 sour cream I had on hand. Let me strawberries drain quite a bit and even changed the paper towel once. No problem with dough, only kneaded for 2 minutes and they came out wonderful! Just in time for my last episode of Father Brown and Mrs. McCarthy's strawberry scones!

I liked this recipe though I did make some changes.  I used self rising flour (so I omitted the baking powder and salt). I also did use salted butter rather than unsalted butter. I did add about 1/4 cup extra flour as it was quite wet when trying to knead it. I also did bake mine for 15 minutes as I spread mine to 10". I also added mini chocolate chips as well!

I have be very careful limiting sugar and carbs.  The recipe just looked wonderful, decided to try it , with a couple of changes, using pastry flour and stevia in the raw.  WOW, so pleased.  Next time will try a combination of almond flour and pastry flour.

I should wait to taste this before reviewing but on recipe alone I’m giving it 3 stars. My dough was crumbly but moist when I turned it onto the counter. The kneading is what makes it so wet. Well dah! I was crushing the berries and there is no way to avoid that. I was afraid to add more flour as scones can be on the dry side anyway. 425 is way too hot to bake these too. I ended up not cutting them because the dough was so wet and just made an 8” circle on the pan.  They needed more flour as they spreaded out too much.  Hope they’re edible.

I made several changes, based on what was in my pantry and on good reviews from the past.  But overall a great, tasty recipe!  
I recommend: 
- Have extra flour ready to add, in small amounts at a time, b/c it could be a wet dough.
- This, at least for me, makes a softer, less dry scone. Which I loved.
- Cutting it before baking was key.

My changes:
- Added a few blueberries when my strawberries came up short. Maybe 1/6 - 1/4 cup.
- Instead of cream: Used 1/8 cup+ of Tequila Rose, a strawberry cream liqueur plus 3/8 cup nonfat strawberry yogurt drink. Those flavors really kicked this up a notch I think.  I think the yogurt drink was a perfect compromise b/t the too-liquid (guessing) cream and not-liquid-enough yogurt others tried.
- Used pumpkin pie spice instead of nutmeg. Added two extra dashes. 

This was so flavorful. A winner for sure.

I was torn between 4 and 5 stars because I had to make some adjustments due to the dough being so wet, I knew from the other reviews that the dough was very wet so I already reduced the cream to 1/3 of a cup but I still had a very wet dough. I also chose to use my mixer to knead the dough so it wouldn't be a sticky mess on my hands. All that being said, they did taste amazing and my children gobbled them up.

These scones were delicious.  Not dry, as some recipes are.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, due to a requirement in my family.  They disappeared very quickly and were requested soon again!  Next time I might add some of the white chocolate chips suggested by another reviewer!

These were pretty good.  I haven't made scones before, but I was looking for what to do with an abundance of strawberries, and found this recipe. It was a good choice.  I added about 1/4 cup additional flour based on other reviews, and subbed sour cream+milk for the cream, otherwise followed the recipe.  Scones are a little crumbly, but this held together well enough.

I did not knead it on a floured surface but used the mixing bowl instead. Less to clean up and did not need to add more flour. They turned out wonderful. Light and moist. Hubby loved them. Will definitely make again

Very good way to use up some over ripened strawberries. I made the recipe as written the first time and they were good.  The second time I wanted to sweeten them up a bit so  I brushed the top with some buttermilk and sprinkled some sugar on top before baking.  I also did not have any fresh lemons for zest so I substituted a Tablespoon of lemon juice.  My changes worked out well.

These were pretty good. I let my diced strawberries sit overnight on paper towel so my dough wouldn't be to wet. I used heavy cream instead of light cream, I can never find that, so my dough was to dry. I added half and half until it was able to be kneaded.  great flavor and texture. I think next time I will shave some white chocolate into the dough.

These scones were delicious! I made them with a friend and we both enjoyed them immensely. We did make a couple of changes to the recipe by adding cinnamon to complement the nutmeg as well as a lot more flour. The berries made the dough way too wet and it was pretty difficult to work with, so we added at least 1/2 cup of more flour. We also threw some raspberries into the scones since we just picked some, but it was mainly strawberries. I would also recommend making a glaze for the scones; we used 1/2 cup butter melted, about 1/3 cup raspberries, and cream and powdered sugar until the glaze is the desired consistency. With a little bit of whipped cream on top, the scones were so good and I will definitely make them again.

Scones came out very yummy! I pretty much followed the recipe as written, but I used frozen diced strawberries.  I actually had to add a little bit of cream to get the dough moist enough, then they needed to cook about five additional minutes.  I also added a handful of chocolate chips.  They came out with great texture and flavor :).

Turned out great! I had a hard time understanding why everyone else said they were too wet. With only a half a cup of liquid to two cups of flour, mine were dry and I had to add more liquid. (Water). Nevertheless they were perfect.

Made this with the cinnamon bun icing recipe I have. It was very fluffy, moist and tasty. Not overly sweet or doughy. I used a scone pan to make wedges and only had while wheat flour, but still, very good. I'll make it again for sure because it was easy and kids could definitely help.

I debated between a 4 and a 5.  I had never made scones before and this recipe seemed simple and easy.  The hardest part was dicing up the strawberries!  After I read many of the reviews I was worried that this wasn't going to work out but they are delicious.  The first time I did them exactly as the recipe was written and they were yummy but just didn't seem right to me.  So I added a bit more sugar (just short of a 1/2 cup) and increased the strawberries to a cup and 1/2.  I also added an 1/8 tsp of strawberry extract to the cream/vanilla mixture.  Let me tell you they are to die for!  I have gotten so many raves about them.  Now when you turn the mixture onto the counter I will admit that it's a crumbly mess - but hang in there - kneading and adding flour as you go.  The mess will eventually become a lovely ball of dough.  I shaped mine into a long rectangle and then cut them in triangles - this made them smaller.  Watch these in the over closely!  Not one second over 16 minutes or the bottoms will blacken.  This is going to be one of my favorite go-to recipes and I can't wait to try it with other flavors!!!

Substituted 1c. Wheat flour for one of the cups of flour to make it healthier. Also used fresh blueberries rather than strawberries. Way too moist once i started kneeding the dough. I ended up adding about 1 cup extra flour. The scones where good but still too moist for my taste. Will try it again though.
