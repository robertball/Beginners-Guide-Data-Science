Mmm!!  This cake is really good.  I didn't have any cake flour so for each one cup of flour needed, I used one cup of regular flour, minus 2 tbsp. and then added 2 tbsp. of cornstarch.  It worked fine!  Also, I decided to use mint flavored frosting.  I'm adding that recipe to Allrecipes...  "Chlyha427's Mint Frosting."  Check it out!  It really made the cake great!

This was absolutely delicious.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Looks more complicated than it really is.  Very easy to make.  I frosted it with cool whip and put some holiday sprinkles on top.  Rave reviews!!

this more like a sponge cake, it has great flavor, and I made a peppermint icing to go on it, next time I'll reduce the eggs and add vetable oil or butter to give more of a cake texture.

This is a lovely cake.  I only used 1 tsp of peppermint because I was almost out and I wanted to frost with peppermint icing too.  The frosting is really what made this cake excellent, thus 4 stars instead of 5.  I used Mint Buttercream Frosting with Dark Chocolate Glaze from this site.  That made it to die for!  Without frosting it's a bit dry.  But still very pleasant flavor and spongy consistency.

While I haven't made this particular Chiffon cake, the recipe is exactly the same as mine for Maple Chiffon - Just sub mapline for the peppermint.  This is a cake I have made for 30 years and it NEVER comes out dry!  Perhaps the egg whites were over-beat and too stiff?  Great Alteration to a classic!  Thanks for the recipe!!

i enjoyed the taste of the cake immensely. it was very fluffy, but i have to agree that it was a bit dry.  I used the "vanilla glaze" from this site, adding in a tsp or so of peppermint extract to the glaze, and then topping off with crushed candy canes.

The peppermint was delicious. It had a very smooth after-taste. The cake was not overwhelming. It would make a light after dinner dessert. I did not have cake flour so I substituted all-purpose flour and just used less.

I've never NEVER rated a recipe so low, but I really had great expectations for this one and it sorely disappointed.  It was a heck of a lot of work for the end result.  I made a glaze with powdered sugar, peppermint extract, and butter.  That didn't even help.  The cake, while pretty, was cardboard dry and really had so little peppermint flavor that I'm mad that I wasted my hard-to-find extract on it.  Hardly anyone ate more than 2 bites.  Bummer... it sounded so great.

Very dense and thick.  Not the usual light and airy chiffon.  The peppermint flavor was good, though.

Pretty good.  I didn't have a tube or bundt pan (packed away for moving) so I had to use a springform pan.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Seemed a little dry.  I wasn't sure what type of frosting to use, so I used the "Mint Buttercream Frosting with Dark Chocolate Glaze" (off this website).  The combination seemed a little sweet for me but everyone else seemed to like it.

Good recipe, but dry and a little tough. The toughness was probably baker error due to over-beating, so I'm going to give this another try.  The flavor is mild, I made a peppermint butter cream, which complimented it nicely.  Very pretty cake, I just wish the texture was a little better.

So sad!  I made this cake and brought it to Christmas dinner.  Luckily we had so many other desserts for back up!  This cake was surprisingly dry and crumbly.  Only two people sampled it and then the word got out so no one else ate it and I had to throw most of it away!  I have made chiffon cakes before and they did not disappoint so I thought this would be good.  I blame myself for once again not reading reviews before making something!!
