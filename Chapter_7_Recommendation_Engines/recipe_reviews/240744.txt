I really enjoyed this for breakfast. What I wasn't prepared for is an uncooked egg.  Generally, I like my eggs cooked hard, but with the texture of the avocado, I didn't even notice that the yolk wasn't completely cooked through.  When prepping, I simply used an egg separator to keep the yolks intact.  And to keep the avocado halves from tipping, I sliced off just enough of the skin so that it created a flat surface.  Set the avocado half in the pan and voila - it doesn't tip!  Quick, easy, and nutritious - I will definitely be making this one again!

I modified this recipe by microwaving for 2 minutes on high instead of using the oven.  Egg poached and was fine.

Wow, I have just found my new go to breakfast. These were absolutely awesome. The buttery creaminess of the avocado and the richness of the egg make for a perfect combination. I only keep large eggs on hand so I did scoop out some of the avocado to accommodate the egg. Equally as good with or without the bacon.

I've added diced red onion and crumbled bacon before putting the egg in the avocado. Topped with salsa when done, was delish.

I seasoned the avocado first and then after I added the egg, I  seasoned the egg. This made all the difference I have tried this recipe once before but I only seasoned after I added the egg and it did not have much flavor. however this one turned out delicious!

This is a wonderful change for breakfast or any time of day.  I did change things up a bit. I only used  Himalayan salt and Telly cherry pepper and a little dab of real butter on each egg.  No  herbs and no pork!  It has such a wonderfull creamy texture and the flavor was very rich and satisfying. 
My husband said it felt like he was eating a a five star resort, but even better.;) This is a keeper for sure.  I like the idea of having the cherry tomatoes and maybe some baked paprika along with it.

Loved this- put grape tomatoes next to avocados in the pan to hold them in place.  The roasted tomato was great with it.  Added fresh cilantro at the end instead of parsley - but this is an awesome combination!

I'm a convert! Absolutely fabulous. However, if you assume you'll be able to fit in two egg yolks and any of the egg whites you'll either have to use a) monstrous avocados or b) quail eggs.  Otherwise, be prepared to spoon out some of the avocado to accommodate the eggs. Then just add back mixed with some pico de gallo and top your eggs that way. Superb. One star mark down is just due to directions missing one point.

I loved this recipe! It was creamy an much better than i expected. I omitted  the bacon and salt & pepped the avacodo before  adding the egg then topped with parmesan cheese and some sour cream on the side. Yum!

I enjoy this very much! Not even just for breakfast but it's a nice post workout meal! When I made this the first time the eggs were too runny. So the second time around before I put it in the oven I covered the dish with foil and cooked for 15 minutes. The eggs came out just how I like them, runny yolks with set whites! Very yummy recipe!!

To solve the problem of fitting an egg in each half of the avocado without having to scoop out and get rid of part of the avocado, I scrambled only one egg and split it between both sides. Perfect! I also did as another recommended and seasoned with sea salt & cracked black pepper inside the avocado before adding the egg. Also put in some shredded cheddar. Turned out excellent. Will definitely be making again.

I can't get enough of the rich creamy texture of the avocado mixed with the perfectly cooked egg! I've made this before and love to add Southwestern seasonings and a little cheese on top. I've found the easiest pan to use is an upside down muffin tin. The avocado halves fit perfectly and I've never had one tip over on me using this method!

I made this exactly the way the recipe stated.  It's beautiful in presentation, but save the trouble.  Make a fried egg and slice some avocado on the side. The avocado tastes better if it is cold and it will be SO much faster.

I add more seasonings to the avocado and the egg, and my family loves it! I use 4 avocados, 8 eggs. I use a muffin pan to bake these, laying no the avocado halves across a muffin cup.  I scramble the remaining whites with seasonings and fill the remaining 4 muffin cups to make egg white "muffins" for the morning. I bake it 10 min, then turn and bake another 5 min. Some yolks are runny, some velvety, but the whites are cooked. Best Brinner Ever!

Super delicious!  Very easy to make and the best part is I can make these up the night before and give it a quick heat up in the morning for a grab - and - go breakfast for my family and I.

Very creamy, will definitely make again.  Trick is to get the whites set but the yolk only heated through.  I added garlic powder and substituted turkey bacon for real bacon to save on calories.

This was fun to make and delish! I baked it a bit longer to avoid runny egg white. Added hot sauce to the egg as well as we like lots of flavour. Very heart healthy except for the jalepeno cheddar bagel I served it with for dipping;)

I had really small avocados so I used two, mashed them up in a small mixing bowl with salt, pepper, garlic powder and smoked paparika.  I split the mixture between two ramekins, smoothed it into the bottom, and hollowed out a hole big enough for a large egg.  I added a little salt and pepper to the egg and cooked each ramekin in the microwave for 2:15 (1200w on high), then covered it for a minute. I also sprinkled a little lemon juice on top to cut the fat.  Keeper recipe

It was a great satisfying breakfast, but it takes longer than 15 minutes to cook. Unless you like raw eggs. Which I don't. Runny is fine, but they were hardly cooked at the 15 min mark. Also, I like to half a tomato, salt it, and roast it in the pan next to the avodacos. It really pulls all the flavors together.

We both loved it!  I've made it several times now.  To avoid having the avocado tip over in the baking dish, I toasted a piece of bread and cut a washer shaped ring to place under the avocado.  It worked like a charm!

This was super simple, delicious, and quick!!! It tasted AMAZING. I didn’t end up using the parsley or chives, but it still tasted great. The recipe was completely accurate with times, plus it was healthy too. I love it!!!

This it's my new favorite breakfast. Suggestions: Skoop out some of the avocado if the pit is small so you have more space for the egg. Salt between avocado and the egg.
I also use a little bit of Carolina Reaper chili powder before I put the egg in. It's very delicious. If you don't want to go that hot I'm sure other chili powders would be good as well.

I did make one change and used large eggs which also increased the baking time for 8-10 minutes. Really delicious , nice and warm breakfast. Yes I will make again!

I found this recipe ages ago.  My 2 favorite foods, eggs and avocados.   425 for 20 minutes makes a perfect poached egg, runny as it should be and a firm white.  Try Zatar as a seasoning to give it a kick.  Would love so see Corning make a special baking dish just for this.

I made this due to essentials that are in a diet I am on.  I sprinkled with tumeric, salt and pepper.  I also added the chives.  I eliminated the bacon.  The taste is more of a 3, but the calories are a five.  It probably tastes much better with bacon, but 197 calories without it.

Trick is: make sure the avocado isn't all the way ripe. It will maintain itself better. I like the suggestion of putting in muffin pan to hold it in place. Fun recipe to try. But, I still prefer poached eggs served with sliced avocado. Simple is best.

I make this as a treat for myself a lot. Having company over this a.m. so will make it to serve for brunch. I add either a dash of cayenne or dried hot peppers. Also liked the idea of adding cherry tomatoes and sriracha which I have in the house today. Wish I had sour cream and chives on hand but do not so I will go with bacon and the tomatoes. It is also nice with salmon on the side...

I popped mine in at 400 and for longer so don't know if it makes a difference, but the avocado definitely had a weird aftertaste that I didn't like.

Loved the healthy idea of this but seem to require more spice/flavor and prefer more contrasting textures. First time I made it I used ground habanero  which helped the flavor but ate it with a piece of toasted homemade bread for texture which killed the paleo goal. Second time I did the same prep, added red pepper flakes, omitted the bacon, and  served it over leftover spaghetti squash putanesca. That added the textures I was looking for and jacked up the flavors substantially while still maintaining the paleo goal (I think).

My new favorite breakfast! I didn't do bacon, but added basil before baking. Then I topped it with sliced cherry tomatoes and fresh salsa once out of the oven. So. Good. Even my 3 year old daughter loved it.

I used liquid egg, scooped out some of the avacado and  mixed it with the egg and chopped mushroom.  I added shredded cheese on top. Don't forget salt!  This recipe is awesome.  Simple to make, yummy to eat and endless variations.

03-16-16 ~ I had a half of avocado that I didn't want to go to waste.  I LOVED this recipe.  I had to scoop out a little of the avocado to accommodate the large egg I had.  Fifteen minutes was a little too long for my egg as the yolk had started to set and I like runny yolks.   The next time, I'll bake for 12 minutes.  A delicious way to use up and avocado.

This was very good with sea salt and chives. The hardest part is getting the egg into the avocado without it tipping. A larger Haas Avocado would work best, and if you scoop out a bit of the flesh, more egg will fit. I placed my avocado halves in a ramekin to hold them level, but next time I may try making an aluminum foil "doughnut". They took 20 minutes to bake, but I think that's because of the bowl around them.

Meh. Looked good on paper, but fell flat in real life. Very bland, even with all the salt, pepper, bacon, chives, and parsley. 15 minutes and the whites were still liquid, 10 more minutes and they yolks were hard (which I like). Hot avocado is a bit to get used to, but the flavor from baking was not for me.

I didn’t have any chives, so I replaced the chives and parsley with cilantro. When it was done, I spread the egg and avocado on toast. I forgot to put the bacon on. It was amazing. My new favorite breakfast!

I didn't add any spices to the recipe.  It still turned out             delightful. Strong recommendation.

Quick and easy to make.  I loved the taste and texture of the bacon combined with the richness of the egg and creamy avacodo.

You really do need to scoop out some of the avocado to have enough room for the eggs, esp if you want a decent amount of egg white. Also-- overcooking will ruin it (texture and flavor wise) so make sure you keep on eye on them! I recommend checking them at 10 minutes. I like the eggs to be cooked a little bit less, so 12 minutes was perfect for me.

I love avocados & I love eggs.  Mixing my two favorite things together was amazing.  Not to mention that a cooked avocado is much more flavorful.

I’ve made this before but it was even better this time. I line the pan with tin foil and use larger avocados and not all the whites.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly— minus the bacon because I didn’t have any— and it didn’t taste at all like what I expected from all the 4+ star reviews. I remember seeing a 1 star review amongst the many 4+ ones claiming that it left a horrible aftertaste, but I decided to give this recipe the benefit of the doubt and try it anyways. Unfortunately it did leave a nasty aftertaste and no amount of coffee or water could get rid of it for a good bit. Disappointing, considering how promising it seemed to be.

I love basil with eggs so I substituted it for the parsley.  I also replaced the chimes with green onions because that's all I had in the house.  I also added a few sprinkles of fresh lime juice, an idea I stole from another egg and avocado favorite of mine.

It was amazing!   Next time I'll make two!

After a long day, I was looking for something easy and healthy for a light supper. This was it. I did take the suggested shortcut of cooking this in the microwave. The eggs came out perfectly after two minutes and the avocado was warm and tasty. I’ll be making. This again.

I am not a fan of cooked avocado,  had to bake it a bit longer than 15 minutes to cook the eggs.  I don't think I will be making this again any time in the near future.

I wanted to shorten the cooking time, so I put the oven on broil on high to cook in about 5 min. It cooked perfectly and the texture was great! Use Lawry’s seasoning which was also really good, even on the cold avocado I scooped out to make my egg fit.  When I read all the other reviews about the avocado tasting fishy I didn’t believe it as I’ve had avocado warm before, but they were right. The avocado has a distinct fishy taste when it’s baked/broiled! Luckily I had cut a few grape tomatoes in half and drizzled them with olive oil and broiled them with it. It helped with the fishy taste! Probably won’t make again due to the fishy taste which is really disappointing because it otherwise would’ve been amazing! Next time I think I’ll cook an egg over medium and eat it with a cold avocado. I skipped the bacon.

I've made this delightful dish at least 15 times now and I really love it.  Avocados are delicious and nutritious and with the baked eggs makes an excellent breakfast choice.  Quick and easy to make and I often use Jimmy Dean crumbled turkey sausage on them for a variation.  You can also use crumbled bacon or ham or experiment, you can't go wrong.  Enjoy!

Mmm... two of my favorite foods put together!  Besides making sure not to break the yokes, it was pretty easy.  Next time I'll scoop out some avocado to make the holes bigger.  One tip: I used an unripe avacado, not soft, skin still somewhat green.  I don't know if this would taste as good with a ripe avacado.

Followed the recipe, but made a topping from the extra avocado scooped out, bacon bits and grated cheese.   Heat bacon and add to smoothed avocado over low heat. Add grated cheese.  Stir.  Enjoy!

I scooped out the avocados because I used jumbo eggs. Using a cupcake pan I use the extra egg whites and some bacon to make extras for later date.      I added some Italian seasoning on top.

I scrambled one egg after reading some of the reviews and split it between both. I still had egg left. Guess my avocado on small side. I baked 15 min at 425 and egg was not set so microwaved about 20 seconds. Added cheese and bacon. Very tasty.

Not that great.
As one reviewer said, fry up some eggs and put sliced avocado beside it.
Add some salsa.
All done!

I took the recommendations of another user, I microwaved it. I used cilantro, lime juice and cheddar cheese. I cooked it for 4 minutes. The flavors went really well with the avocado.

Well I found out and same with my husband that we do not like cooked avocado. I could see the concept was cool but I think if I make this again I'm just going to make an egg and do all the toppings although I did add some garlic with mine cuz I love garlic and then just stick it in a cold avocado.

Is delicious. However since the beginning the avocado has to be big  to rest the whole egg.

Added cheese, put bacon on top before baking. Shredded Mexican blend just out of oven. Use medium size eggs and large avocado. Add red chili pepper for little kick. Bacon and avocado predominant flavor. Quick & easy. 15 minutes was too long for my oven.

I left these in the oven for an extra two minutes so the yolk wasn't as runny and then added feta cheese along with the crumbled bacon and it was delish! A new favorite!

Made the basic recipe but without bacon.  So simple.  I’ll make again, topping with shrimp done in garlic and wine, then hollandaise.  Decadence for my daughter’s birthday.  Thanks!

I did this but instead took half a piece of sour dough bread and put it under the avocado, then cracked the egg. This way the excess landed on the bread and cooked great. Some bacon bits and a touch of spice worked great, then microwaved instead of baked for just about 2 minutes. Sprinkled fresh sprouts and goat cheese and boom. Delish.

Very good but I will try the microwave idea because the recipe does not poach the egg yolk, only the spill over white. Need to figure out how to use large eggs. Most do not keep small around. Used Pensey’s Fox Point Seasoning to get the the chives.

It wasn’t bad,  but unfortunately I didn’t have small eggs, so had to dig a deeper whole into the avocado to accommodate the yolk and some egg white. Lots of salt and peeper before and after it was cooked. And to top it off, lots of salsa!

Would I make it again? Of course, using smaller eggs, and probably not cooking for as long!

This was so quick, easy, and nutritious!  It saves a lot of hassle if you slice a bit off the skin of the avocado halves so they sit flat in the baking dish.  I did not have chives and used garlic salt instead of sea salt.   I had large eggs and didn't bother to scoop out more avocado, just used the yolks and saved the whites for another dish.   It was still delicious.

I give thiis recipe  a minus 0. Messy, tasteless and a big waste of an egg and avocado. The egg yolk fits into the pit well nicely but the whites spill all over. I had to remove the yolk rinse dish and make a small mote in avocado ?? to fit the whites of the eggs. Flavor was disappointing. I will not make this again.

The only thing I added was a sprinkling of parmesan cheese after they were cooked.   The presentation looked great on a large individual plate, which two slices of orange and 4 slices of bacon.

Awesome dish. I did an egg scramble in measure cup and poured the mixture in each avacado. I cooked 6 at time. It only took 2 eggs.  I also did a short cut with rhe bacon. Bought the premade bacon crumbles in the salad isle to save on extra dishes.

No changes at all. Well just one. I had no bacon so I pan fried a slice of cooked ham and chopped it up. My wife loves Avocados. This is the first time in my life that I have eaten an Avocado. Never like the texture. I'm sold now.  Will make this again.

Super easy to make. Change herbs and seasoning to suit your preferences. Better to eat with a spoon than a fork. I served it with tortilla chips to "scoop" it out.

Absolutely delicious! A little bit of a learning curve in not getting the egg-loaded avocado too top-heavy to where it tips and spills the egg white.

Very yummy! I left out the bacon and added feta and tomatoes! My only problem is that you end up taking out TONS of avacodo. I think they should make it clear your eggs will not fit.

Loved this!  Because I was missing the parsley  and green onions added cilantro and onion powder instead.  Also, because I like my egg white completely cooked added a few minutes to the time.  This will definitely be something I will again and again.

This is a nice combination of egg and avocado. I followed the advice of others and scooped out some of the avocado and seasoned it before adding the egg. To stabilize the avocado, I put some slices of smoked sausage which kept them upright and made for a nice breakfast meat as well. Enjoy. I'll make this again certainly

Maybe my oven is just terrible, but i cooked this for over 20 minutes and my egg  still didn't cook right.  Also, baking the avocado seemed to take away the flavor and texture that I really like about avocados. I'll probably stick with my go-to sliced raw avocado topped with poached or over-easy eggs.

Agree not a ton of flavor with some other chefs. Egg was too big to have fully in the avacado & took longer to cook then recipe recommended. I did cook the remaining egg white on the side. Will modify recipe next time to dig out some avacado to make a adobo guacamole for lunch. This recipe Would be a good accent with chile verde & a good idea to make for a Mexicana brunch.

I really enjoyed this dish but I found that the egg and avocado were a little under cooked for my taste to next time I will add 5-10 minutes on the cooking time. I also mixed the egg up so there was only yolk as that is my favourite part of the egg. But apart from that it was delicious but if you only have a small stomach capacity then a full avocado might be to much so only cook half the avocado if your aren't that hungry! This was yummy! Thank you!

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish! I was so afraid the avocado would become mushy, but it actually sort of dried out just a bit, and maintained a nice creamy but firm texture, and also had a slightly nutty flavor.  As for the eggs, I used large, and next time I will separate the egg first so I can put the yolk in first and add the white as needed. I tried to be careful doing that, but it all kind of slipped in there.  I also needed to adjust the baking time as my whites were still ckearvat 15 minutes - some time between 20 and 25 minutes was needed to cook then to my liking.  One last note,vi made a little "cushion" of tin foil to keep the avocado from tipping.  All in all, I really liked this!

I didn't have any chives or parsley but I did use sea salt, pepper & bacon. I enjoyed it with 2 slices of 12 grain toast. So easy & so delicious. Great Saturday breakfast with coffee.
