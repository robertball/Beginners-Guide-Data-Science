I put all the ingredients in the blender but it made it a little too diluted so I wouldnâ€™t  do that the next time.  I would however add a little sugar.

Delicious and just what I wanted to relax with at the end of this hot and balmy day. My strawberries weren't super sweet so I added a splash of simple syrup to this. I also blended it instead of using a shaker so it would be more like a slushy. Perfect cocktail that I will make again.

I made lemonade and then mixed with fresh strawberries that I pureed in my magic bullet. I put half in the shaker and added 1.5 oz grapefruit vodka. For the other half I tried Peach Schnapps. I sugared the rim and used a strawberry for garnish instead of lemon slice. My hubby liked the peach better, I'm more of a sour kind of girl. :)

I am partial to flavored lemonade and vodka. I loved this recipe. I actually made it with a flavored vodka like Svedka Mango and Pineapple and it made it delicious! Love love love!!
