I've made these several times. Wonderful. However, made a few variations -- 2 eggs (makes them softer) increase flour to 1 3/4 cup, added 1 cup cranberries.  They are great! I've had many requests for these - always give them to new neighbors as they move in.  Try them!

Just took these out of the oven and what a nice surprise, they were delicious!  I changed a couple of things though.  I omitted the 1/2 cup white sugar because I only had sweet coconut flakes. Also, I only added 2 cups of oats since another review mentioned the cookies not sticking together.  Next time I would like to try splitting the flour between white and whole wheat.

I love these cookies. I left some in the oven for 10 min. The others I left in the oven for 12 min. I thought the cookies left for 10 min. were much better than leaving them in longer. Nice and chewy

These are phenomenal!  Absolutely delicious!  Wish I had found this recipe sooner!  I love oats, coconut, and white chocolate.  These are some of the best cookies ever!  I was concerned about the amount of butter and wanted to cut back to one cup, but didn't want to negatively affect the cookies so I just left it as is.  I only had medium eggs so I used one whole egg and one yolk.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  Baked 8 minutes for a soft, chewy cookie.  These are the best!!!!

I've been baking these for 6-7 years now and get rave reviews.  It's a great recipe if you're looking for something rich and tasty, but not chocolatey.  I can't count how many times people have asked me for the recipe.  They don't come out too pretty, but they taste fantastic.  I always use real butter, ghirardelli white choc chips, and the sweetened coconuts flakes (Baker's brand).

About some of the complaints I've read--if your cookies are coming out too flat and runny looking, it's because your butter melted too much (it's tempting to melt it in the microwave because there's so much).  If you do let everything soften too much, cool the dough for a bit before baking.  I use a cookie scoop or tablespoon to measure these out.  Also, be generous with the space you give them on the sheet.  They're...territorial.

They were delicious the day they were baked! :)) Wow, nobody could quite get
enough of them. But I saved them for our hike the next day and although they
were still good then, they weren't as good anymore! So just eat them right away...

I love this recipe with my changes!
I cut 1/4 cup of the butter out. I cut 1/4 cup of the white sugar out. I used 1/4 cup of wheat flour for some of the white. I only put in 2 cups of oats. I used 2 eggs. And my secret ingredient? I added 2 cups of shredded summer squash! Since it resembles the coconut, nobody in my house noticed at all! 
My kids and husband are loving these cookies, and I'm very happy they are secretly getting veggies! I'm so glad I found this recipe!

No need to read any reviews... just follow instructions and you will be rewarded with the most incredible tasting cookies. I can't go back to eating plain choc chip cookies after eating these. Made half with white chips and half with semi sweet choc chips. Love them. Thank you so much for posting.

Wow, these were good!!  Note that you can use old fashioned (non-instant) oats.  That's all I had on hand, and they turned out great!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Excellent cookie.  I used semisweet choc chips and added 1/2 tsp of salt.  The cookies were chewy in the middle and crispy around the edges.  My kids loved them.  Might try reducing the sugar a tiny bit next time, since the coconut adds a good bit of sweetness.  Will definitely make again.

Cookies were quick and easy to prepare.  They disappeared quickly.  The next time I make them, I am going to try macadamia nuts either with or without the white chocolate chips.  Also, the recipe states that it makes 2 dozen cooks, I was able to get almost 4 dozen.

What I was really craving was almond and coconut... so I changed up this recipe (gasp!).  I halved it, added the vanilla and then the same amount of almond extract, and tossed in 1/4 cup slivered almonds.  I also left out the egg, adding instead a tbsp each of ground flax and soymilk.  They hardly flattened at all, yet they are moist.  Great almond essence, nice hint of coconut.  Sweet and buttery and entirely too yummy for my waistline.  PS: Halving the recipe STILL got me 2 dozen with my cookie scoop - be warned.  :)

This is the best recipe I have had for any coconut cookies. I changed it up a bit by reducing the oats by 1/2 cup, added a 1/2 cup more of coconut, and added a teaspoon of almond extract. I also cooked them a little less than recommended. The result was a chewy cookie that almost tasted like an almond joy. I will definitly make these again!

Probably the best cookies I've got off All-Recipes.com (out of 10 or so).  Buttery and beautiful.  Easy to make and even easier to eat!

Lots of alterations from reviewers.. I cut the oatmeal to 2 cups; 2 eggs; 1/2 tspn salt; added LOTS more coconut (and still don't have as strong a flavor as I'd like); used white chocolate and semi-sweet chips; baked 14 minutes. They're very good, but not orgasmic.

Added butterscotch and white chocolate chips.  For some reason, I could not get these to cook correctly.  They were flat and greasy in the middle.  Tried several cookie sheets and adding more flour, oats, etc, but no success.  They tasted wonderful, but I like my cookies to look good too!

LOVE THEM! They were soo good! Instead of regular flour, I used gluten free flour, I also omitted the baking soda. I used regular mini chocolate chips instead of white chocolate. Only cook for 10 minutes. Really really good! Also, I used 2 1/3 cup of coconut flakes, so it wouldn't be as dry. It says it's supposed to make 2 dozen, but I ended up with 4 and 1/2 dozen. So yeah! Definitely don't double if you need more! There's already enough in the batch itself. I recommend this recipe! I even pinned it to my Pinterest board! :) 5 stars!

I'm only giving this four stars, because I made substantial changes. I wanted it to be a bit more healthy.

I omitted the white sugar, as per other reviewers, and I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup. I also replaced 1/3 of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and used dark chocolate chips. They turned out great.

The second time I made them, I decided to use just 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar mix and replace all of the flour with whole wheat. They also turned out very tasty like this, however since most of the calories come from fat, using Splenda only saved me about 14 calories. For this reason, I probably won't do it again. 

The third time I made them, I used 1/2 cup of regular brown sugar, all whole wheat flour, and I replaced the butter with mashed banana. This cut down on the calories hugely, but they just weren't as nice. The banana was a bit too strong and made the texture slightly rubbery. I may try this again but only replace half of the butter with banana. Otherwise, I'll stick to 1/2 cup brown sugar, no white sugar and all whole wheat flour.

These are very yummy and addictive. I made them quite snack size which was a mistake as my hub kept poppin them in his mouth! They did not last long in our home. We did not add the chocolate chips though I'm sure they would have been a tasty addition. These actually, oddly enough, reminded me of a shortbread or a spritz cookie - even though they had oats and coconut. They were not too sweet at all ... just enough sweetness to keep us snacking on them! 4 out of 5 because they were not extraordinary but rather pleasantly yummy.

Excellent cookie.  The only changes I made were to use margarine instead of butter, and to use large oat flakes (not quick cooking) because that is what I had in the cupboard.  I rolled them in balls and they were excellent. I think they would be good with chocolate chips too, but then they would be a totally different cookie.  I will definitely make them again.

Excellent recipe.  Great flavor. I substituted Butter Flavored Crisco for the butter due to previous reviews regarding them being too crumbly.  Also used one cup of coconut and a full bag of the chips... about 2 cups.  Definitely a keeper.

These are hands down the best cookies I have ever made and I have made many a cookie.  The only change I made was I used less oatmeal but I probably didn't have to.

I made these cookies last night.  They are absolutely fabulous.  I followed the recipe perfectly.  The one thing I might change, is the coconut flakes.  Next time, I'll buy unsweetened coconut flakes.  The sweetened ones were a bit on the sweet side.  But they still came out perfect!

Decided to make these based on ingredients we had in the pantry. They were delicious, however I was expecting to taste more of a coconut flavor which I didn't really get. They were YUMMY just add more coconut if you want that to be more of a highlighted flavor. The white chocolate chips in this were awesome.

They were ok. Not too much of a fan of the consistency. And if you under cook them even just a bit they are pretty gross.

I still like them but I am confused. My cookies are coming out flat and greasy. I tried decreasing the oats to 2 cups and increasing the coconut to one cup. I use dry coconut flakes and old fashioned rolled oats (not instant). Maybe it is the amount of butter? I cook them on stoneware cookie sheets too...next time I'll try two eggs and increasing the flour to 2 cups. Help with this would be appreciated!

My brother loved these, I loved them, my dad liked them, and my mom, who doesn't even like coconut, ate quite a few.  Of course, these are extremely fatty, but who cares?  They taste soo good.  I like them with normal chocolate chips even better than the white ones.  Also, beware that unless you make really big cookies, you'll have about sixty of these, which is good, cuz they're amazing.

Excellent. These bake very flat so make sure that you space them well. They are baked when slightly brown at edges. I got 4 dozen 2 inch cookies.

yum! These were really easy with very simple ingredients.  i only used a cup of butter (because I ran out), 2 eggs instead of 1, whole wheat flour, and all brown sugar, but they were still great :)

Great cookies.  Next time I'm going to add a pinch of salt.  Beware: If you're going to use a silpat, you may want to reduce the oven temp. a bit.  My first batch got a little too brown on the bottom, but when I reduced the oven temp back to 325, the second batch came out great.

These were pretty good. I used two sticks I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, 1 1/2 cups oats, sweetened flaked coconut, and I left out the white sugar. I personally didn't care for the texture of the brown sugar in these, but my dad and boyfriend loved them.

I was so excited about this combination of flavors ... but I'm so disappointed in the way MY cookies turned out...FLAT & GREASY as all get-out!  What went wrong? Help!  I saw 2 other reviews with this complaint.  I halved the recipe, but still used 1 egg and then used 1 cup of rolled oats.  I baked them on a stainless cookie sheet (ungreased). The butter I used was salted cream butter  - was that the prob? I refrigerated the dough and made them later in the day - was that the prob? Or was it because I live in CO and baked them for 11 minutes????

Funny the day I made them, for some reason they tasted dry and I originally gave this recipe only 3 stars, but the day after they are delicious! Though, they are a little on the heavy side, I might just decrease it to 2 cups of oats and lighten up on the sugar since I used sweetened coconut and white chocolate itself is very sweet.

These turned out fantastic and would be a tuff rivel for any bakery. I did make some small changes though. I used "Just Bunches" carmal flavored cereal (new in groceries) instead of oatmeal and raw sugar instead of brown. I used only 2 sticks of butter (a little less than called for) and bake 14 minutes instead of 12. These are so good, I look foward to the next batch.

A very good cookie.  I think that the flavors meld well together.  The coconut taste is not too overpowering, but just perfect.  My only complaint is they were a little crumby...if I didn't take them right off the cookie sheet, they fell apart.

Made these for work.  Everyone loved them.  Not one cookie left.  Definitely a keeper! 
Update: Still make these at least half a dozen times a year. Done in 9 minutes in my oven, 20 cookies to a sheet. Cookies still disappear fast. One of my favorite recipes!

These were pretty good.  I used only about 1 3/4 cups of oats and added more coconut to get more of the flavor.  Also I used milk chocolate chips instead of white chocolate and took it out of the oven before they looked "done" so that they cooked a little out of the oven and were nice and chewy.  Delicious!

These cookies held their shape really well. I love a soft, thick cookie and that is what these are. I used semi-sweet chips instead of white.

Oh yeah, coconut and oatmeal go perfectly together.  This is a new twist on an old classic and I love it.

These cookies didn't go over very well at my house. They kept falling apart and my husband and kids didn't eat them, I ended up trowing 1/2 of the batch away..

The best cookie recipe I've ever found. They were wonderful just out of the oven and the few that were left were even better the following day. They tend to get a little hard (like all cookies); however, if you put them in a zip-lock baggie with a slice of bread, they will stay fresh and soft for days. Thanks, Claire, for a wonderful recipe!     Violet

These are very good and my husband absolutely loved them.  I am only giving it 4 stars because I am not a huge lover of white chocolate, but that is just my personal preference.  If you like white chocolate, you'll love these.  I cut the white chocolate down to 1/2 cup, which seemed like a good amount.  I took Marjory's suggestion and pressed them down with a fork so they weren't so puffy.  I baked them for a full 12 minutes and they were perfect.  I did not experience any trouble with them crumbling as some reviewers have.

Very nice, my husband couldn't wait to try them when he found out they had coconut in them.  He took some to work and has just e-mailed me to say that his co-workers keep finding reasons to sneek another cookie, even after they've had 3 each!
Nice crumbly cookie.

Love white chocolate so this recipie was a hit in my books.  Definately do not cook longer than 10 - 12 min.  Makes a lovely chewy flavourful cookie.  Froze well too.

Purchased a bag of unsweetened flaked coconut on sale with no plan in mind...the price was great!  Found this recipe doing an "ingredient search" and we're really glad we did!  These were fantastic!  
Added an additional egg and a pinch of salt, otherwise followed directions exactly.  Very warm here yesterday so did put the mixing bowl in the fridge between batches.  
One of our new family favorites...Thank You!  (if you ever figure out how to make these into bars we need to know right away)

Less sugar; only used the brown sugar called for in the recipe. It was plenty sweet with the chocolate chips (regular instead of white).

They were very tasty! I liked the fact that they stayed plump after baking, and didn't flatten out like some cookies. I did add another egg to the recipe. I will make them again, thanks for the recipe!

These turned out great! I used 2 eggs instead of 1, added about a 1/2 cup of slivered almonds and a whole cup of coconut instead of 3/4. They needed a few extra minutes in the oven. Will make again!

I seriously love this recipe! It's awesome. I took the advice of others and cut the oats to 2 cups, and may have been generous in adding the oatmeal and white chocolate chips. I also changed the vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon and added a 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. I like the addition, but don't go overboard there as it's pretty powerful. I recommend chilling this dough between batches because otherwise it spreads a lot. Also for some reason it really spread a lot on my silplat but not on my old cookie tray. I kind of like cookies with a bit more height so those were my preference. Only cooked for 10 minutes and they were perfect. Texture is slightly greasy but taste is a hit!

Amazing cookies! The only change I made based on some reviews I read, was to omit vanilla and add 2 tsp coconut extract. Amps up the coconut flavor!

Loved these - I've made them several times although I leave out the chips because I'm weird that way and like the cookie part better than the chips. Only
other change I make now is to add a pinch of salt, or use salted butter, a little salt gives sweets just a little depth of flavor. But these are now a yearly thing for the holidays.

a good, perfectly respectable cookie, but nothing amazing. not worth the amount of fat between the butter & coconut in my opinion. it makes FAR more than 2 dozen (unless you make huge cookies).  I doubled, intending to give some to new neighbors, and still have some for family -- and wish I hadn't.   I'm over 8 dozen and still going.

These were ok...I substituted 1/2 butter flavor crisco and 1/2 lite butter for the butter it called for in the recipe...maybe that's what was wrong?  They were really super soft...but still tasty.  I was just trying to save some calories :)  I'd make them again...but next time I'll use all butter!

The first sheet of cookies I put in the oven spread out quite a bit and ended up being pretty fragile. Then I learned my lesson and put the sheets in the fridge for 30 minutes. I baked the cookies for 2 extra minutes, and they ended up being more sturdy. I dolled these up a bit with cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves (1 t., 1/4 t., 1/4 t. respectively--and I think that boosted the flavor nicely.)

Fabulous!!!  I loved these.  These were the first cookies I ever made and I
had no problems.  I usually prefer a softer, chewier cookie but these taste great!!!
I took these home for Easter and everyone loved them.  They have the perfect
ingredients, white chocolate and coconut.  I was in heaven.  Thanks for a fabulous
cookie recipe.  A definite keeper!!!

This is a fabulous base recipe that allows you to add your own personal touch. Reduced white sugar a little, used only 1/2C premium white chips, and added 2/3C chopped cranberries. Perfect for holidays. Crisp outside, chewy inside. Watch the cookies in the oven. An extra minute can brown the cookie too much.

Excellent!....except I did a little experimenting and added 1 extra egg yolk and decreased the baking soda by a dash... it made the cookie ultra chewy with crisp edges...delicious!

These have very good flavor and turned out just fine but I like a cookie that spreads a bit more and is alittle more crip. If you like puffy cookies these are good.

These cookies were delicious.  I use them to bribe my sister into babysitting for me.  Everyone who has had them has loved them.  I have however had some problems with them being a bit too crumbly.

I was looking for a cookie that didn't have dark chocolate in it, and this was a pleasant surprise. All my co-workers ate every crumb I brought in and asked for more. My son, who doesn't like oatmeal cookies as a rule, love these!
Definitely a winner.
