I mashed up some avocado and added lemon pepper and salt. I spread this on gluten free crackers and put sardines on top. It was delicious! I would never have thought to combine avocado and sardines if it weren't for this recipe.

This was different and tasty! I only had oil packed sardines, so I used those, and salsa in place of the canned diced tomatoes. Really nice flavors, and the crunch from the toasted bread really gave this a nice texture. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Pretty god recipe. I used rotell and a few splashes of sriracha. I got the idea of capers for my last bite. Was very good. Also used spinach.

I omitted the pepper & added minced garlic. Warmed the sardines in another brief trip to the toaster oven. As a variation, added a bit of shredded cheese. It was tasty & should make a fine appetizer.

I love this recipe!  My husband will not touch a sardine (not yet) so I make this for my lunch, I buy just a couple of crusty French rolls from our bakery, about 5 inches long and split one of them (saving the other for the next day), I brush both sides inside with a bit of olive oil and place them on my stove's grill, while toasting I prep my other ingredients.  I end up with two open face sandwiches.......so yummy!  Sometimes I will puree (smash/mash/smear) 1/2 garlic clove and mix it with the oil I brush on the roll,  if I want to go Nordic I will take a few pickled onion slivers and lay them atop the mashed avocado, add the sardines and omit the tomatoes....Delish!
