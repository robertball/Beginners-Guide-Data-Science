really, really good!  i will use a little less salt next time-substituted walnuts for the almonds, dried thyme for fresh and didn't have coriander seeds and found a site that said fennel seeds can be substituted for coriander seed so i added more fennel seed-used my cleaned out coffee grinder to blend

This recipe seems very adaptable.  I had less than a 1/4 cup coriander seeds, my cumin was powdered rather than whole and I had no fennel.  I also used half the salt (1 tsp), but it was still very salty.  I'd never eaten this before, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it was very good.  It's a bit messy to eat, but I imagine it would be a wonderful topping for mild vegetables, eggs or meat.

Wow! I am so impressed at the awesome blend of spices!!! I cut in half since this was an experiment. Followed as closely as I could but didn't have everything. I only had ground coriander and ground pepper, dried thyme, so here is what I did:
ground coriander 2 1/2 t 
2 T sesame seeds\1 T whole cumin seeds
1/2 t black pepper, ground
1/4 cup almonds
1/2 t dried thyme
1 t kosher salt (was too much-next time cut back to 3/4 t)
put into a small food processor but had to pick it up and shake it as it was running so they would all get to the blade.
home made pita bread with half white half wheat and dipped into the olive oil...


So good! I wish I could give it 4.5 stars since the salt needs to be backed off, and I am a salt lover. Still, delicious!
