I've made this three times in my bread machine with super ripe persimmons I froze whole.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't turn out right.  Much too dry.  I made it again and kept adding water until the dough looked right.  The third time I added the called for water and increased the amount of persimmon to 1 and 1/2 cup.  The bread was really moist and fantastic.

A wonderful raisin bread.Not too sweet, the way I like it. Love the persimmon pulp in it, keeps the bread moist. A hit with the family. I used a half cup raisins instead,though. I will make this bread over and over again.

I tried this recipe and with a few changes per another reviewer, and thought it was delicious.  It was even much better the next morning toasted with a a light buttering.  The changes I made were to increase the persimmon pulp to 1 1/2 cups and the water to 12 tbsp.  I did not use a bread machine and divided the bread into 2 pieces and baked them in 3 1/2 x 6 inch pans at 350 for about 30 min.  While eating the toasted bread, I thought that nuts would have been a great addition!

Recipe needs to be corrected - 5 minutes preparation time and 3 minutes cooking time in a breadmaker is obviously in error!
I'm not sure what the "ready time" is. I'll wait for a correction :-)

for best results, double the amount of yeast, heat the persimmons to body temperature first, add some walnuts and rolled oats, increase the raisins by 50%, use 50/50 whole/white flour, use 50/50 barely-melted butter/coconut oil, and honey instead of sugar.  The recipe needs to be adapted if you don't use an electric bread maker. It came out a bit to wet at first, which was corrected with extra flour.   Truly delicious!

My persimmons where ripe, but still a bit firm, they went into the bread pan chopped and the machine pulverized them just fine. I did use more persimmon,  2 persimmons worth. Increased the water too, 9 tablespoons of water was simply not going to work at all.
