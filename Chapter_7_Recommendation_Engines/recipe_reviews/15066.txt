Unfortunately, I have to agree with all the negative comments about this recipe.  They have got to be THE greasiest cookies EVER and they weren't cookies ... it was just one giant, extremely thin, cookie-like mess on the baking pan (it did taste good if you didn't mind allll the grease). They spread out far too thin - I could hardly scrape them off the cookie sheet.  Would never make again.  Even my husband rated them 1/5 and he is a cookie monster.  :)
My advice to you - keep searching for the perfect chewy cookie recipe - unfortunately, this one isn't worth the time or expense.  If you did want any of the cookie mess, you had to eat with a spoon.

I thought these were very tasty.  However when making them I have learned to add more chips to your desire and also refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes before baking so they don't spread so much.

I have never been able to make chocolate chip cookies stay chewy, but I followed these directions exactly and they came out exactly like they should be -- a little crispy on the edges and nice and chewy on the inside.  MMMMmm!  The only slight change I'll make next time is, I'll stir the chocolate chips right in with the batter, just to make it easier on myself.  These are a winner!

my husband absolutely dies for these cookies! I tried changing a few things, and he sure didnt eat as many!! Fabulous recipe! thanks!! Months later and we are still loving these cookies!! dont know what the rest of you are doing wrong to wreck them! maybe the altitude? I know my recipe's in Africa do NOT turn out the same in Canada!!! Try using more flour or something? I live in Dawson Creek BC in Canada, and these are excellent cookies! :)

These cookies are pretty good when baked as described. They are VERY buttery, so next time I will reduce the butter a little. Also, they definitely need more chocolate chips so I mixed some in the batter and then placed a few more on top. These cookies bake very flat, so be sure to keep your dough balls small and widely spaced, or it will spread too much in the pan and you'll end up with one giant cookie.

This is the worst recipe I have ever encountered. I followed her recipe exactly as described (I don't like making changes to a recipe used for the first time). The cookies turned out thin and broke apart when I tried to spatula them from the pan. They spread out too far in the pan. Very disappointed.

Yummy Yummy! I loved the cookies and so did my husband.  The only thing I did differently was put the chocolate chips within the batter, i found that a lot easier.  But other than that it was a great recipe!

I wish i read the negative reviews before making these cookies.  they taste okay but they spread out so much that I had one giant cookie when they were done baking. Now I have to go out and get more sugar and eggs so that I can make another batch.  I can't use the batch I just made.

This is NOT the world's best cookie.  Not enough chocolat chips, but the way they spread in the pan,  I don't think I would add more.

I'm a professional cook and was looking for something basic but I would never recommend this recipe to anyone.  I could tell immediately that this was not going to come out right.  After mixing the ingredients it was soupy instead of cookie consistency.  I had to add flour to offset the runniness.  Even then, they spread all over the cookie sheet failing to retain any consistency.  As far as taste goes, there was none.

I have made chocolate chip cookies MANY times but could never get the chewy like I like them.  I decided to try a new recipe and I found this one.  They are NOT chewy.  I made them right down to the word and they were cake-like.  They spread WAY too much, and I think I felt an artery clog while eating one.

These are alright, if you follow the original, however, some more flour would keep them from spreading out as much. Also, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips makes them even better.

these were ok, but not great. Defiantly not the "worlds greatest". They were kind of hard and flat. I did change the recipe though slightly that made them better. Instead of vanilla I used choconut extract and some choconut.

This is the worst recipe I have ever baked!!!  There is simply not enough flour and the cookies become one large gelatenous greesy sludge.  What a waste of time and $$$$

I thought this was terrible.  Not sure how the feedback that I read was positive, but these did not turn out.  It seems there was not enought flour.

This recipe was great! The  only thing I'd recommend is to refridgerate them for about 5-10minutes before putting in oven, like someone else had already said. I'd also fold the cookie dough over into little balls, once already on baking sheet, to get chocolate chips better in the cookie. You might want to only put 5-6 cookies on a sheet to prevent sticking and only use a 1/4 cup of butter instead of a 1/2 a cup. These cookies were FANTASTIC!

I liked this recipe because it doesn't make a lot of cookies, I just wanted a snack for myself, not to feed an army. I have enough cookies for a few snack attacks, and don't have to give a dozen or two away just to get rid of them.  I liked that it doesn't use a lot of different ingredients so I didn't make a mess in the kitchen and only had a few dishes to wash. The cookies do spread a lot, but I was prepared for it and only baked 6 cookies at a time. Definately add the chocolate chips to your own taste, I could have used more.  I also put the chips in the batter to make it easier.

They came out a lot thinner and greasier as it has less flower than the Tollhouse recipe.  They were good but I will just use the Tollhouse recipe instead.  Its all in the baking time, to keep the cookies chewy only bake them until golden brown and adjust your oven temp if necessary.

These are really good. The only change I made was to add more chips and put them in the batter. They were crisp around the edges and soft and chewy in the middle. Not to buttery at all. They did spread out in the oven for a flatter cookie, but very tasty.

I doubled this recipe right off the bat. I used 1 stick butter and 1 stick "smart balance light". I also added butterscotch chips along with the chocolate. Other than that, I followed recipe as it was written. While they did flatten out about, we LOVED the flavor and found them to be chewy and delicious. They were not hard to scrape off the pans at all. Will make them again! I also put the dough in the fridge during the second round of baking, and the cookies still spread out about the same. When doubled, the recipe made 5 1/2 dozen.

I must say this was a bit of a disappointment I tried adding extra chips and chilling the recipe first, on my second attempt even with this they still seem to spread far too much and don't taste that great either

I was surprised at extent of negative reviews.  In my first test batch, I added about 1/4 cup of finely chopped pecans along with about 1/3 cup of chocolate chips (I'll use more next time, so that I will agree with).  I mixed the chips and pecans quickly into the batter.  I used a 1 tbls scoop and wound up with 2 dozen medium sized cookies. I baked them on two commercial-grade aluminum half-sheet pans covered with parchment paper.  They flattened to the correct amount and were all essentially perfect.  Brown crispy edges and chewy middle.  If they were baked on dark pans there could be a different result, but using standard professional quality equipment and a correctly calibrate oven, the result was as expected.  I took the suggestion about not overworking the dough to heart and was very well rewarded with the result.  I have saved this recipe and I will make it again.

the cookies were indeed chewy but not as much as i'd wanted.  the cookie tasted good but it would have been better if there was at least a cup of chocolate chips instead of just 1/4.

They spread out a bit more than I expected, but they taste good and are very easy to make. Next time I'm going to double the recipe and bake them as a bar. I'l also sprinkle them with chocolate AND peanut butter chips. Overall a very good cookie.

I don't know what all the people who gave this a negative review are doing wrong, but they are definitely doing something wrong.  I just kinda wing it when I cook so I did do a few things differently.  My butter was straight out of the fridge, so I put it in the microwave for 30 seconds then blended that with the sugars.  I mixed together the flour and baking soda in a separate bowl, and then mixed it in with the other mixture.  I also put the chocolate chips straight in the batter. It was just easier that way.  I added white chocolate chips in too.  This recipe came out with by far the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had!  All my coworkers agreed!  I'm going to go make some more cause they ate them all so quickly!  Not too greasy either, they're cookies! C'mon people, what cookie isn't greasy at least a little?!

I use this recipe all the time. Everyone loves it and its so simple!   At christmas time when the small Lindt chocolate balls come out I use this mix recipe to cover them, refrigerate and then bake and you get perfect cookies with a perfect soft chocolate layer in the middle!

Dont listen to anything negative about this recipe, its fabulous! I like more chocolate chips than called for but these cookies are soft and chewy and stay that way... I've used these cookies for bribery to get my own way many times. Make sure you pull them out of the oven just BEFORE they look done and then them finish on the cookie sheet.

i tried this recipe, and i found that since i live in a high altitude, adding a bit of extra flower will make the "chewy" part of the recipe true!  otherwise, they were too flat and greasy.  i just added 1/4 cup extra flower per batch.  i have found with every cookie recipe, refrigerating for a bit before baking always helps!

Worst, blob Ever! . These cookies turned into a pile of mush. I followed directions exactly. Maybe use less butter. I had a good time eating the blob but they definately weren't cookies.

We made these cookies for a holiday caroling session and something went wrong. We asked our mother what happened and she said, "I don't know," so we read her the recipe's ingredients and she said, "You always need salt when you make cookies," So, maybe you should call your mother and ask her how you can improve this infabulous cookie recipe. Thanks for the time you took writing this recipe :)

These cookies were flavourless. Adding more vanilla and mixing in the chocolate chips, instead of just placing them, helped a little.

Definitely easy to make and not a bad tasting cookie but like a lot of the reviews, I found this cookie way too buttery/greasy.  I was looking for a nice flat chewy cookie and this did deliver on that aspect but the greasiness took over the flavour. I'm still going to keep looking for my perfect flat chewy chocolate chip cookie.

This recipe is really good but I made some changes.  I added about 3/4 cup of milk chocolate chips.  I also baked them at 325 for 9 minutes using my convection oven and removed them from the pan immediately. I made them small for my 2 year old and got 2 1/2 dozen. If you like flat crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside cookies this is the recipe for you.

upon reading that these cookies were greasy, i decided to decrease the butter by 2 tbsp. i spooned the dough onto the cookie sheet and put the whole thing in the freezer for 15 minutes. the cookies still spread very thin and were still very greasy. the taste is alright, it almost seems a bit too rich because it has too mich butter (it also tastes too sweet for me). i think that they are supposed to spread thin, but the greasiness was way too much!

My son is diabetic so I cut the white sugar to 1/3 cup and I used 1/4 cup brown sugar NOT packed, plus I added 1 cup of chocolate chips. These are the best chewy cookies and every time I make them everyone loves them!!! I hand the recipe out all the time because they are so good!

Absolutely delicious. 

They expanded into one giant thick cookie-brownie type dealie-o on the pan, and I just carved it up into cookie-squares.

They expand more than advertised, and I never added the chocolate chips, but I've made another batch since and they're still just as good

I call the holy chocolate chips... Because they fall apart & have holes in them.  The only way I got them to stay together is to let them cool completely on the cookie sheet.  I don't have time to let cookies sit on the sheet for 20 minutes.

These were nowhere near chewy and were way too sweet.  I am overly happy I tried threes before offering them at the gathering I was hosting. Please try another recipe don't waste your time or ingredients on this recipe.

You MUST let these chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours and than role them in sugar before baking or you will have a soupy mess!!! Really wish they would have put that in the recipe. The only reason I knew this is because I have a chewy ginger bread recipe that calls for the same method and they start out at the same consistency as these cookies. If you chill them and role them in sugar they turn out really well! Oh I also add 1/8th cup flour, it helps!

Before I baked this recipe, I reread the reviews for it. I saw that this was seen as very buttery and soft, so I did the obvious. At a 24 serving amount, I only added 1 cup of margarine (or butter) and I baked them for 14 mintues at the same temperature, but checked them at 11 minutes so they wouldn't burn. They turned out crispy around the edges but soft and chewy on the inside! My parents loved them and I made them in less than an hour! I'm definitley making them again. I also stirred in the chocolate chips to save time, but I added a cup and a half. Not to many, and not too few!

Nice cookies. I made them a bit big and made more of a cookie 'cake' as they all joined together at the edges. They stayed lovely and soft for next day eating too though, so I will make them again.

They were like a sugar cookie with chocolate chips. We double the recipe and put all the ingredients in once. They weren't greasy, not flat, definitely chewy. They boys and I love 'em.

Originally tried to make cookies off of the back of the chocolate chip package. BAD IDEA. They were the worst ones Ive ever made. Tried a few others online, and this was really the best one I found. They came out perfect! Crunchy, but light and chewy. Wonderful! Thank you!

I like this recipe so much, I've made it three times in the past 2 weeks!  My only suggestions are to add about 1/2 tsp of salt to flour mixture, and to up the brown sugar to an equal measurement to the white sugar.  They also turn out best when you add the egg at the last step, when you add the chips.  Also, on my last batch, I was out of vanilla, so I added coconut extract.  They turned out AMAZING!.

I was looking for a quick and easy chocolate chip cookie recipe, I found it!  Super easy to put together and didnt take much time to do.  These are wonderful cookies, chewy and crunchy around the outside. I had the first batch ready before my children got home from school. They didnt last long either! I doubled the recipe and put in 1 cup of chips and roasted pecans! Just absoultly wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!!
