I originally found this recipe in a 'Taste of Home' magazine and have made them MANY times! They are great w/ steaks or just a nice big dinner salad...very tasty! :)

These are awesome!  I made this while camping (hence the even more substandard than usual photo) as a beer soaking starchy treat with dinner.  I used a pie pan, as a 9X13 does not fit in our camper oven.  I also used probably closer to a 1/4C butter than 1/2C, simply because that was what I had left to use.  One of our dinner guests is a blue cheese hater and she loved them.  Blue cheese isn't really a predominant flavor, strange as that sounds...  THANKS for a recipe we will use again, jodi!

Simple and delicious and it's only three ingredients.  I put my biscuits in a buttered deep dish pie pan as the biscuits were not huge pieces.  Since I had smaller biscuits, I only used 1/4 cup of butter.  Part of the pan was made with the bleu cheese, for me, and the rest of the pan was made fresh grated Parmesan cheese for my DH. I served this with 'Chicken Club Pasta Salad' from AR and we enjoyed a delicious meal.

I love blue cheese and butter and cooked these in a bundt pan. I put a little butter in the bottom of the pan and when they cooked, they crisped up a little...amazingly awesome!!!

I love blue cheese, so I had to try this and glad I did, very good! Second time even better because I also sprinkled real bacon bits on top as well.

Delicious and decadent!  The whole family loved it, right down to the toddler.  I need to have company over soon, just so I can make this again!  It looks impressive, but was SO easy!  I think I did have to cook it for closer to 20 minutes.

I've made this recipe several times over the last 10 + years & it has become a family favorite. I've also used Feta cheese in place of the Blue (for those crazy people who don't like Blue Cheese) & it's nearly as good as the original.  - My favorite way to serve this is with a side of Creamy Buffalo Dipping Sauce (also on All Recipes). Absolutely delicious!

Used only 1/4 cup butter. These were so easy to make and were very good.

I made this for a bridal shower brunch!  I was a hit.  I increased the amount of cheese to about 1/2 cup and added crumbled, cooked bacon!

Very tasty, but not really sure what the point is in cutting them in quarters...why not just leave them whole?
