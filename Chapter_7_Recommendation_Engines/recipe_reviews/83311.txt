I agree with using shaved or grated parm in place of cheddar.  Also, I put the cornmeal into cold liquid, whisking as I do and then I bring it to the boil, then simmer.  Otherwise, I always get lumps.

I have been looking for a polenta like this, it was FAR OUT! Really creamy and delicious.... although I did modify this a little bit. Instead of cheddar I used shredded parmesan and next time, I will use a courser grain corn meal (or use what's called "polenta" which is even courser ground) and mix it while the water is cold so that it doesn't clump as much. Also, I used the chicken broth as another reviewer mentioned, since it gives it a richer flavor. I think I will also try adding a little bit of sage to make it herbed polenta. Great side dish with cumin & oregano seasoned porkchops and braised kale!

Wonderful!  Another use for Polenta is to pour it onto a pan while warm and let it set up in a thin sheet.  When cool, slice up into small squares or strips for use in casseroles.  Endless possibilities... A favorite is ground beef and taco seasoning, layered with cheese and sour cream/plain yogurt.  Yummy!

I changed the recipe a bit and it turned out great. I cut the milk in half and replaced it with heavy cream, and then instead of 4oz of cheddar I split that up between asiago and parmesan cheeses. I did add a bit more polenta so it would firm up so I could grill it. The grill gave it a great extra flavor boost.

WOW.
I had no idea what to expect, since I never have had polenta before, but WOW. It's like mashed potatoes, only with corn. Absolutely delicious. Wouldn't change a thing. What a great side dish to serve with anything!

Polenta made with cheddar and milk is not the traditional polenta I grew up with but this was a delicious variation, particularly for more Classic American entrees.

I substituted chicken broth for the water, as suggested, and added about a quarter cup of Parmesan cheese along with the cheddar. It was very good, but next time I'll use less salt. Good basic recipe. Very rich and tasty.

The flavor reminds me of 'home'.  We like ours very creamy, so I used chicken broth (organic-otherwise it's a container of chicken tinged salt water) and lots of it- also almond milk (it's what we use) and parm, black pepper, no salt needed.  It sets up fast, keep stirring. I added a hunk of butter. Just keep adding liquid until it looks right. It makes a ton-be prepared to have fun with leftovers!

Loved it - a nice side dish change from mashed potatoes.  Used chicken stock instead of water as others suggested and used skim milk since that is the only kind we drink.  Also substituted parm. cheese for the cheddar.  Added corn meal to liquid then boiled - cooked much faster this way!  Will make again.

The jury is really out on this one.  I followed the recipe, yet it turned into a gluey mess with in minutes of adding the corn meal...I'm not sure what went wrong?  So, though it was a very unappetizing consistency, it tasted....ok.  It's kind of like a blank slate; it tastes like butter & cheese & grain?  It's worth giving a shot and I may try again to see if I can determine what went wrong and try to get a result like the yummy looking photo attached to this recipe!

I also substitute chicken broth for the water.  I added half sharp cheddar and parmesan cheese.  I noticed that with the chicken broth which generally has salt in in and the cheddar cheese which can be salty, and I didn't catch that the butter I used was NOT unsalted, and the fact that with the kosher salt added, I thought the polenta was way too salty.  Next time I will use unsalted butter and omit the kosher salt.  I did add a pinch of sugar and I think that helps balance out the flavors.  I had this with pork rolled up with capacola and a demi glaze sauce.  Marvelous!  I even used the leftover polenta for breakfast the next morning.  Pancake syrup goes great with it!

I have been making this recipe since I found it on this website 4 years ago! It is fantastic, and very simpe, yet makes an elegant presentation. I use half chicken broth and half milk, but I add the seasonings and 2 cloves of minced garlic to the liquids before heating, to infuse the flavors even stronger. I always double the recipe, or triple it, and never have leftovers. It is beautiful with Coq Au Vin, as the polenta soaks up all those wonderful juices from the chicken simmering away in wine for hours. For those who did not care for it when they tried it, I implore you to try again. It is a main staple on my entertaining menu. It gets rave reviews each time I serve it.

I wanted to like this one, but unfortunately I couldn't get past a bite or two.  I had no problems with lumps and it was creamy but after sitting for a few minutes it took on a weird texture.  The husband said it was okay and the little guy ate a few bites.  I won't be making this one again.

I have not made this recipe, but I've made polenta often and it seems like it would work. Substituting water or chicken broth is my preference because I grew up not having a polenta that was so rich. Polenta has lots of possibilities: add cheese, cooked sausage or bacon, caramelized onions, a can of corn, whatever you like. Some people pour it out and let it set in a thin layer, then make a polenta lasagna. It's a great cold weather dish and a staple in the northern regions of Italy.

This was very good and a nice change from mashed potatoes. I did what most reviewers suggested of mixing cornmeal into cold milk and water and then heating. It cooked up quick and then I added the butter and cheese and added salt and pepper to taste. Best to serve immediatley because it does set up as it cools and won't be as creamy. For those who don't know what polenta is it is like cream of wheat in consistency. The taste is mild allowing the cheese flavor to come through and dominate but not overpower.

Another trick to smooth polenta is to mix the dry corn meal with the water and pour it into the boiling milk (or water, stock, etc)whisking as it cooks.

Perfect side dish for pork chops...I will try using the suggestions of others and use chicken broth in place of water and Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar the next time around, however it is good as is.  Thanks!

Tip about cooking Polenta. I sometimes make a plain polenta with cheese, but sometimes I add finely diced onions and pancetta/bacon. In the past when I added the polenta to the water, whether hot or cold, it would start bubbling, splattering and burn my hands. Now, I pour some olive oil with a pat of butter in a deep frying pan or pot, add the corn meal, stir for awhile, then add hot water. If I choose to add finely diced onions and pancetta/bacon, I saute those first, add the cornmeal and then the hot water. It's easier to stir the polenta in this way and I don't get burned anymore!

Holy cow! How is it I have never had this before in my life?! I used half park half Romano instead of cheddar and added about 1/2 tsp thyme and 3/4 tsp oregano and OMG! I mixed the corn meal w water and then added it to the milk and boiled. It cooked up SO fast! I also got impatient and added the cheese and butter while it was simmering which caused small cheese clumps. Oh so good! Plus it gave it a nice texture Imo :D devine! This is a keeper!

This was my first time making and eating Polenta. The only thing I did different was using chicken stock in place of the water. I found it was a bit salty for me but I think it was due to me still adding the salt when I used stock. I really liked this found it was a nice replacement to the same old side dishes. Thanks for such an easy recipe..that I will be making again!

Enjoyed it.  I think I need to add some garlic and use a different cheese to please the palettes in my family.  I will use this as a base and change it up until I get it just right for my house.

Good taste & consistency!  I halved the recipe and used parmesean instead of cheddar.  Also added some snipped fresh basil.  Great side dish - filling!

This is phenomenal! I've made this at least a dozen times. DH and the kids all love it, as do the other people I make it for. I didn't change a thing!

I made this twice  as instructed with water; it tasted great. Then I made it a third time following a suggestion here on the site, and added broth (I used low sodium vegetable instead of chicken). I wasn't crazy about the taste at first, as it tasted like more like broth than polenta, but after I added the cheese (I used grated parmesan instead of mozzarella) and pepper, it was excellent. The broth makes it much yellower in color.

I also followed another suggestion and whisked in the polenta with cold liquids instead of hot, then brought it to a boil. I did that all 3 times and I had no clumping.

Lastly, I cooked this on an electric stove. Be aware when you're letting it simmer after bringing it to a boil. Electric stoves take much longer to cool down, so even if you bring the heat down to low immediately after it hits the BP, it will continue to boil. I would suggest  turning another burner on low, and moving it to that one to simmer.

My first time making polenta, so I didn't know what to expect. This was fantastic! I used nonfat milk, 2 Tbs butter, and parmesan cheese. My husband and I loved it. Thank you! :)

Not our favorite the first night. Maybe it is that we are not familiar with the texture. I put the leftover polenta (we had lots and I didn't want to waste it)  in an 8x8 pan in the refrigerator overnight, then sauteed squares in olive oil, and added ragu and parm. Everyone loved it the second night and said to make it again.

did half whole milk, half 1% milk, and left out the pepper, butter, and cheese. (using polenta as a base for sauce) it was good, but a little salty. would make it just 1 t salt.

Delicious Delicious Delicious! 
I also added chicken stock instead of water and parmesan cheese instead of cheddar and it did turn out a bit salty because of this. We love salt so its not that big of a deal but next time if making those same adjustements I will cut back on the salt for sure. 

I served this with BBQ meatballs for the hubby and I had it with Sauteed Mushrooms on Arugala Salad and it was amazing.

When substituting chicken broth for the water, as I did, remember to reduce the salt that's called for in the recipe. I didn't account for the salt already in canned broth, therefore mine was a tad salty.Added 2 cloves minced garlic to boil in the water and subbed parmesan for cheddar, to go with Italian dish osso bucco. This is a keeper!

What a wonderful basic recipe. There is so much potential. I am Italian and I've always added the polenta to cold liquid to prevent lumps and please use polenta grade grain for this recipe, it does make a difference.

I'm not sure what to rate this because i've never had polenta before.  I also added 4 oz of cream cheese instead of cheddar, because i'd seen a recipe on tv that used cream cheese instead of cheddar and it looked better.  Also used chicken broth for the 2 cups of water.  The consistency was smooth, but i didn't like it, and i'm not a picky eater at all.

this recipe was my first attempt at polenta.  In order to prevent the typical "bland" taste, I added 3 cloves of finely minced fresh garlic just before adding in the cornmeal.  I also increased the butter by 1 Tbs.  Came out very very well.  Fellow dinner guests, more familiar with Polenta found it to be very good.  Thank you.

This turned out great!  It's a great basic recipe that I was able to modify to a low-fat/calorie side dish by using FF Milk, added some chicken like bouillion, didn't use butter and added just a touch of cheese...

Nice change of pace for a side dish.  I used chicken broth instead of water and put the corn meal in the cold liquid and heated up together whisking to get the lumps out.  It was very cheesy and a nice compliment to our grilled chicken & asparagus.

Excellent, easy alternative to the store-bought logs, as well as to rice, potatoes & pasta.  A bit bland to stand up as a side dish on its own, but great base for something saucy.  I put the cold liquid, meal & salt (about half) in the pot and heated them together; no problem with lumps at all.  Think I will add more meal next time to firm it up as it chills.  Lends itself to lots of options for flavoring (garlic, mushrooms, SD tomatoes, etc.)  Will be cooking this a lot.

i loved this recipe,  i was a little worried when it didn't call for parmesan cheese like i was so used to using.  Very nice.  My only recommendaton would be not to use sharp cheese if you don't want that strong of a cheese flavour.  i'm going to be making it tonight and i'm going to try medium cheese this time.

Very good recipe. I have 3 quick comments:
1) TOO MUCH SALT!!! it could probably be cut in half.
2) You can reduce the butter by at least half and substitute 1% milk for the whole milk and hardly notice.
3) The other reviewers are right about parmesan (instead of cheddar) and adding soup stock (instead of plain water).

...Ah. One more thing: coarse corn meal *does* seem to make for a better texture.

Very good polenta recipe.  Only took about 5 minutes to cook.  I'm thinking if you substituted chicken stock for the water, it would make it 5 stars.  But still, very tasty and will definitely make again.

Just made this tonight for dinner.  I used a 1/2 cup polenta, 1 cup 2% milk, 1 cup salt reduced chicken stalk, 1/2 tsp crushed rosemary and 1/2 tsp crushed thyme melted salted butter with the milk, left out the salt brought this to a boil then added the polenta in a slow stream while stirring constantly when slightly thickened I added 1/2 cup real grated parmesan cheese and the pepper.  It came out amazing and enough for 4 people. Serving it with roasted vegetables (butternut squash, mushrooms, onions and broccoli) with a poached egg on top.  Garnished with shaved parmesan.  Yummy!

Yummy polenta... I reduced the cook time by about 40%, added 2 garlic cloves, and used smoked Gouda instead of cheddar. It turned out amazing with a fried egg on top for breakfast!

For my first time making polenta I must say I Aced it! This was delicious and very rich and creamy. I only added 3 tblspn of butter & half of the amount of cheesed. I didn't use cheddar cheese but I did however use Parmesan cheese. If you use salted butter try not to use so much butter in the water. Vice versa

This is the basic recipe for polenta, very simple and turns out just fine every time. I use parmesan instead of cheddar cheese so I usually cut the salt due to saltiness of the cheese. If you want it to be a little creamier as a base for meat and gravy you can stir in extra milk a little at a time during the first few minutes of whisking. It depends on what I am serving it with, sometimes I do add another half cup of milk. I leave it more firm if I am planning to use the leftover for a veggie lasagna or grilling it as a base for seafood with a creamy sauce. This dish is versatile, inexpensive and simple.

I even took the risk of adding half of the butter and using 1% milk, and we still loved it! I did add some garlic powder, cayenne, and dry mustard to treat it more like a homemade mac n' cheese.

Too much milk and water. I would do 1 cup of each next time.

Loved the tips from other users. Mixed polenta in cold milk before adding, and used chicken broth instead of water. I topped it with meatballs in marinara sauce. Great gluten free alternative to pasta.

Use Manchego and some fresh thyme to liven/fancy up the flavor! Also, definitely stir in slowly and wisk quickly, stir more often or it will brown on the bottom. Throw in some nice smoked ham and you've got a lovely Tapas dish!

Wow. This was my first time making polenta, and it was so easy and so delicious that I cannot wait to make it again. The only changes that I made were to use 1% milk instead of whole, because it's what we had, and to add way more cheese, because I'm from Wisconsin and there is no such thing as too much cheese. I used a mix of Asiago, sharp cheddar and mild cheddar, and it was perfect. 10 star recipe!

I used this with a hard goat cheese. I was going to skip the butter, but the flavor was harsh and it seemed really thick. I added 2 tbs of butter and that solved those problems. This is definitely a keeper. One thing is you have to constantly stir it. Mine cooked up in less than 10 minutes.

Wow!  This is a terrific basic creamy polenta recipe.  I added chopped sundried tomatoes, asiago and goat cheeses, a few tablespoons of honey, basil and a few red pepper flakes.  Introduced "something new" to the family and they all had seconds.  I used it as a base on the plate and placed stuffed flank steak rolls on the top

This was so good. I didn't have everything on hand so I made a few substitutions. I used quick cooking polenta for this recipe. I used 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 chick broth instead of whole milk. I also used goat cheese instead of cheddar.

Instead of 2 cups whole milk and 2 cups water, I just used 4 cups of skim milk.  I use less salt than what is called for, adding it to taste when the polenta is creamy.  Also, I like to serve it with grated parmesan instead of cheddar, especially if your dinner features Italian flavors.  This recipe was great and the instructions were very good.  Enjoyed by all--thank you!!

Great taste and side dish with BBQ.  I cooked it a second time with these changes...I added sauteed onions and garlic,  used chicken stock instead of milk and water, and substituted the 2 ounces of grated Parmesan instead of cheddar...great creamy or crispy polenta side with any Italian dish!

This was tasty.  I used chicken stock and parm cheese as suggested by others.  The 1st night, we had it warm as is.  I put the leftovers in the fridge overnight and planned to have it fried the 2nd night.  I sliced it from the loaf pan and tried to fry it but it seemed to melt down and fall apart.  I was never able to flip it.  So I ended up scooping most of it out of the oil and we still had some crispy bits which were tasty but I think the basic polenta needs to be thicker in order to be able to fry it.  I will try again next time by adding some more corn meal to the pot so it firms up more.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this. Next time, I would like to refrigerate it and then fry it to see how it tastes. Served with Rosemary Braised Lamb Shanks, Sugar Snap Peas, garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli with lemon, butter, pine nuts.

This was my first time to try to make my own polenta...DELICIOUS!!  I used chicken broth instead of water and used Bob's Red Mill Grits (Polenta).  It only took about 4 minutes to cook...and I didn't think it needed any butter!  The leftovers are in the refrigerator so that I can make crispy polenta cakes tomorrow night!!!

This tasted so good with water that I can only imagine how great chicken broth will be for next time.  I made the 4 serving version of this with skim milk.  I put the polenta into cold liquid,then boil as suggested and did not have a single lump.  Around 13 mins of cooking I had to bump the heat up to medium because it was not solidifying.  I think I might cut down the butter next time, but the sharp cheddar cheese was excellent.

Fantastic!  I made modifications per other reviewers' suggestions and it turned out so very tasty.
I used chicken broth instead of water, 3/4 cup half and half (all I had) and the rest (1 and 1/4 cup) light plain silk milk.  Next time I will try with just the silk milk (lessen the fat content).  I was tasting as I went and actually liked the flavor BEFORE adding the cheese better (I used parmesan, again.. all I had).  I barely added any butter, as it tasted great already.  I used to only buy the pre-made, squeezed-in-a-plastic-tubey-thing polenta.  Never again!!  ;-)

The whole family raved!   my tweaks were: chicken broth instead of water.   Used half milk and half heavy whipping cream, then omitted the butter( needed to use it up after the holidays)  used a mix of cheddar and Parmesan.  I salted to taste after  rather than adding a proscribed amount.   i might add chives to top next time just for color, but otherwise  a total winner!!!

I followed the recipe but made some changes as was suggested by some other reviewers. I swapped water for chicken stock and cheddar cheese for parm. This was my first taste of polenta and my boyfriend and I did not like it at all. I tried to like; I really wanted to like it, but I don't think the texture of polenta agreed with me.

Tasty with parm instead of cheddar, as everyone else has found. However, mine took longer to cook than 20 min - more like 35? I think the key is not to just turn the heat to low, but to turn it only low enough that it still bubbles a little without totally boiling. I'll try it that way next time and see if 25 min is a bit more accurate. Served with a faux "meat" and veggie (zukes, carrots, and peppers) sauce that I let simmer while I prepared the polenta. It's one of my fiance's favorite dishes!

I love this recipe, and have been using it for almost a year. I don't usually let the polenta simmer for 20 minutes...its usually more like 5 minutes. I stir like crazy up until I hit the point where I let it sit for 5 minutes, and it is cooked through and tastes good.        I use whatever cheese it on hand, and it is delicious! This polenta combines well with the summer squash polenta recipe on here, or is great by itself. Store bought polenta has nothing on this recipe!!!

This was good but was a little lacking. I added a lot of milk after it finished cooking because it wasn't creamy like I had hoped. And even though I used sharp cheddar, there wasn't a whole lot of flavor, so I added a good pinch of garlic powder. It's a good base recipe, though.

The beauty of this recipe is its versatility. I've been making this for a long time. Adding 3 tbsp. or more of chopped scallions to the water/broth is nice. I've used a shredded four-cheese blend with lots of success. I even serve this for breakfast! Spreading the mixture in a cookie sheet to cool and then cutting into triangles or squares is a great way to use extra polenta. Lightly fry the triangles in a bit of butter or olive oil and you have a nice, new side dish.

This recipe cuts down to 2 servings without a problem.  I gave it only 4 stars because of the changes I made.  I too swapped the cheddar cheese for parm.  I also changed the cooking process after reading the reviews.  I heated the milk.  I stirred the corn meal into the water before adding it to the milk to prevent lumps.  With these changes, this was amazingly tasty and creamy polenta.  Thanks to the previous reviews for the great advice!

I really enjoyed this recipe but I found the polenta to be a little thick. It still tasted great so I'm not complaining. I added some fresh chives from my garden to spruce it up a little. Next time I'll try a liquid ratio of 5:1 to make it less firm.

this is super delicious.  I use more cheese (because this is Wisconsin, after all, the dairy state!)  I have instant polenta, which only takes about 5 minutes to cook, so it's super quick.

Wonderful recipe! I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese. I served the polenta with the "Polenta with Italian Sausage" recipe on here. Yum!

FABULOUS! Very creamy and smooth--just like our favorite restaurant. I used chicken stock instead of water and added a slice of hot pepper cheese and we couldn't stop eating it.  If you are looking for a hard "patty" type polenta, this is not it. I believe you need to wait for it to cool for it to be that consistency.

Really good. I used chicken broth instead of water. Instead of cheddar cheese, I used parmesan & romano. Really good flavor.

This was my first time making polenta - so I wanted a simple recipe.  Came out perfect. I made some modifitations to the recipe - broth instead of water, skim milk instead of whole and I used mild cheddar - because that's what I had in the house.  I mixed the broth and milk with the polenta cold then heated and I had no problems with broth. Can't wait to make againand add in more ingredients.

I didn't have any cheddar so I went with Colby Jack, which is I think too mild of a cheese. I went ahead and added some browned garlic cooked in butter and the taste is pretty good, but not cheesy. Next time I'll use cheddar and re-review.

I never had luck with polenta recipes before this one.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  Served with Coq au Vin alla Itaiana recipe from Allrecipes and Green Beans with Walnuts.  That was an incredible dinner!  Thank you for sharing!

While I did alter it somewhat to meet our dietary needs, YUM!!! I used 1/2 Yu rice milk, 1/2 soy cup creamy soy = milk.I reduced the olive oil margarine to 2 tablespoons.
Also, I added a bit more aged cheddar, and 1/4 c. chopped pickled jalapenos.
I also used perhaps a teaspoon more corn meal, and I cooked it a bit longer...I am letting it cool in a shallow loaf pan, and depending on the consistancy, I will either broil it after brushing it with melted butter, or cut it into squares, and fry till crisp on both sides...we're having it with vegetarian chili, tonight...but I already snuck at taste, and...YUM!!! Thank you!

I don't know what we did wrong because it sure seemed like an easy recipe, but we did not care for this at all. My husband said he'd stick with cornbread. We did take the suggestion & put in a loaf pan, refrig for at least 4 hours, then slice & fry as fingers. It came out a mess. We should've stayed with the original recipe, but even with that as soon as I started to whisk the cornmeal into the milk/water it seemed creamy & thick to me. We did cook it still as directions stated. I guess sometime we better try polenta where someone else is making it so we can see what it is supposed to taste like.

Yummy! Loved this recipe. I changed it a bit.  I added 1/2 tsp. less salt and instead of water, used vegetable broth.  I also substituted one of the cups of milk for rice milk.  Noboby knew the difference.

I thought this recipe was awesome, though I admit I made a couple changes.  I used chicken broth instead of water, shredded parmesan instead of cheddar, and I actually used white cornmeal instead of yellow or polenta.  It was GREAT!

I've made this a few times and it always turns out great.  I prefer it with chicken broth, but using water and salt if you don't have any handy works just fine as well.  Cheddar tastes good in this recipe, but if you really want something special, try substituting goat cheese -- the flavor and texture is amazing!

SO Easy & my first polenta! Just made it tonite to go with my chili.  I accidently added the whole bag (8oz) of sharp cheddar cheese.  It did not seem to make any difference in texture or taste.  This cooked in 5 Minutes or less for me.  I felt like it was missing something...some spice perhaps?  I ended up coating it in cracker crumbs and did a quick pan fry, then served the chili over it.  My husband said I should make it each time I make chili. 3 stars on taste as it is but giving it a 4 on potential.

Sooo quick and easy (and cheap!). It was ready 5 minutes after I incorporated the cornmeal. I left out the butter and added a tsp Creole Seasoning. We had this with Cornmeal-Crusted Catfish. Loved it.

Made this for my husband for Valentine's Day with the Basis Ceasar Salmon recipe on the site, along with asparagus and Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad (also from allrecipes) Wonderful! Like another reviewer, I too found that it cooked quickly and was done within a few minutes but added a bit more milk and still came out creamy and yummy! My husband raved about it...will definitely make it again!

This was my first attempt at Polenta and it turned out great!  Perfectly seasoned and the cheese was a yummy addition.  I poured it into a loaf pan lined with plastic wrap to set up.  I sliced it into 1/2 inch slices and lightly breaded it and fried it in olive oil and topped with a vegetarian chili -- SO good!  Definitely a keeper :)

Loved this recipe. Use Gorgonzola cheese instead of cheddar after getting a recommendation from the Italian grocer. I also added mushroom broth and a few chinese mushrooms - tasted fabulous!!

Really good!  I've never made polenta before and this was so easy.  I garnished the top with some extra cheddar, and it was super yummy.  In the future, I think I'll put a bunch of cheddar on top...it kind of melts into the top of the polenta.  My 11 month old babies loved this, as did my husband.  A real crowd pleaser!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  My store was out of polenta so I used corn meal.  I also added extra cheese.  Not sure why but mine was finished cooking after 3-5 minutes even on low.  I poured it into a small bowl, let it firm, then when I turned it out onto a plate it kept a nice round shape and was easy to slice rather than scoop.  A crowd pleaser!

Fantastic- I added the cornmeal to cold milk and avoided lumps, and to prevent it getting heavy as it set, I folded in a whipped ( soft peaks ) egg white. This changes the texture so it stayed light and creamy. Everyone loved it.

YUM! Yes, I made this but I used 1 cup half and half, 1 cup 2% Milk, 1 cup water and 1 cup of low sodium no-chicken broth. I replaced the 1-1/2 tsp Kosher Salt with 1 tsp salt substitute (Nu Salt) and 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt (because the cheddar cheese has more than enough sodium). I made the remainder of the recipe as it is written. It came out delicious.

Used medium ground cornmeal and it was ready in much less than 20 minutes cooking time. Followed the advice of adding the cornmeal to cold ingredients.  Used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar and it was very cheesy.

It was delicious! Since I was cooking for one, I cut the measurements by half . I also used chicken broth and milk, per recommendation of other users and the flavors were amazing! I used Colby cheese since it was what I had at hand.

I followed most of the advice of other reviewers: Chicken broth instead of water. Cornmeal and spices added into cold water and brought to a boil stirring constantly. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and used 1/2 Cheddar 1/4 grated Romano and 1 /4 Mozzarella to make up the 4+ oz of cheese. My only complaint is it wasn't firm enough so next time I'll add more cornmeal and use a coarser grind. 

Question: What do fans of this recipe think of adding a drained can of whole kernel corn (or similar amount frozen, but thawed and drained) to this recipe? I may try it.

Although it was very good, I could barely taste the cheese. It was very thick and not creamy. When I make it again, I'll add more liquid.

It makes a lot, so when I make it for just me and my husband, I cut it in half.  I have also made it with Parmesan too.  Get creative!

We thought it was very good.  I didn't have sharp cheddar so I added extra regular cheddar so you could better taste the cheese.  Very creamy.

I have made this several times. I reduce the corn meal by about 2 T because we like the consistency better. I have made this with Cheddar, Blue, Parm, and Gruyere; and they are all delicious! Our friends are impressed when I fix it for them, and it is easy to make. We love it!

This was so easy. The only changes I made were to add 1 packet of low sodium chicken bouillon granules to each cu of water and reduce the kosher salt. I have a dairy intolerance so I used vegan shredded Parmesan cheese and dairy free margarine. I 1/2 the recipe for just me. I made chicken cacciatore from this site and it went well together. I have 3 more servings to eat this week.

Delicious! My new favorite comfort food! I‚Äôve made it twice now. The first time I use parmesan cheese because it was what I had in the house. I made a sausage and spinach saut√© over it and it was great! Second time I followed the recipe correctly, still delicious! This time I put left over chili and an over easy egg on top. Yum!

So good based off the reviews, I used half and half (that's what I had in my fridge), water, chicken better than bouillon on medium low, stirring every 3 or so minutes once it started to steam and thicken I stirred more often . once it thickened, maybe 15 minutes) I stirred in the butter  then cheese and removed from heat. it wasn't thickened all the way but I removes from the heat a little early because I was preoccupied with other things. I salted, peppered, and added a dash of garlic to my liking and was done. Very simple b
recipe but 110% on the flavor. I served some braised short ribs over this.

Delicious recipe! Have made this may times, much easier than other preparations, it's a hit with family, good "as-is" or served with marinara or bolognese sauce.  Highly recommend! Thank you for the recipe.

I have been wanting to try making polenta for quite a while. Because I was serving it with leftover turkey chili, I used cheddar cheese. Think it would adapt well to any cheese that melts easily without being stringy. I did wisk the corn meal into cold milk and water.. no lumps. Wi most definitely make again.

This was excellent! Did as others and used chicken broth in place of water. only had 1 percent milk  so added half that and half heavy cream. Also used half sharp cheddar and half freshly grated parm. Will definitely be making this again!

This was very good flavor. A little too runny for me.  Ext time I will cut the liquid by a cup to see how it is. I served it under a sausage ragu and we all really liked the flavor.

I love polenta, but never bothered to make it because it seemed so complicated. This recipe is so easy! Like others, I use Parmesan instead of cheddar. Such a hit with everyone -- even the kids -- and a nice change from the rice/potato/pasta starch routine.

I dont know why but mine always seems to stiffen up when cooling. Was hoping for creamy. Maybe next time I will add a lot of extra milk. The flavor is good and I went with white sharp cheddar from Cabot. Even though not creamy, cant deny its tasty and simple to make!

Very tasty creamy polenta. I used chicken broth in place of water, and added a whole cup of grated Parmesan. I did not add any salt. This needs to be stirred frequently so it doesn't scorch. I served it with "Red Wine Braised Short Ribs with Smashed Fall Vegetables" that is on this site. I subbed the polenta for the smashed fall veges. So tasty I could have licked the bowl!

I must have done something wrong. I noticed another reviewer had the same problem. I could not get mine to set up. I had to serve it in ramekins because it was so watery. Not sure what I did wrong but with the cost of the cheese and the polenta itself this side dish was not worth the money even if I could have got it to set up. The flavor was very blah even switching chicken stock for water.

Used 1% milk (that's all I ever have in the house) and used vegetable stock instead of water for a little extra flavor.  Otherwise, made as written.  Served it with a baked ratatouille. Excellent!

Delicious. I subbed fat-free half and half for the whole milk and used a combination of cheddar and aged gouda. I can imagine using up several cheese ends to make this, it's nice to vary and not have all one cheese, and some fresh herbs stirred in at the end might be nice too. This is a really good base recipe that you can adjust on a whim. We found that 2/3 to 3/4 cup of this recipe is enough as it is very filling. I served it with a grilled sausage and asparagus. The remainder is in a loaf pan chilling in the fridge for slicing and pan frying.

Like some of the other reviews, I found this to be OK, but not great.  The consistency was a bit "gooey" for my taste.  Maybe some bacon and green onion would make it more flavorful?

Yum! First time to make. I followed various ideas you all have posted! I used 1 cup whole milk with 1 cup heavy cream, 2 cups chicken broth instead of water. I saut√©ed onions an pancetta, then added liquids. I then used 1/2 a tube of polenta an 1/4 cup yellow corn meal. I then simmered it with fresh sage an rosemary from my garden... This was a dinner hit! Keeper!!

This is great and foolproof.  I've made it 3x in three weeks. I put a little less cheese (cheddar) and butter but then just put some in there without measuring, it's wonderful! thank you so much!!!!

This is a great dish and a great substitute for mashed potatoes. I did one change which is putting in the parmesan cheese and included thyme. The herb just add on to the aroma. Thanks for the recipe. :)

I have made some version of cheesy polenta many times.  This is probably the best and easiest.  I went ahead and made the recipe exactly as instructed. I look forward to making other variations.

Very yummy. I used chicken broth rather than water for added flavor and adjusted the salt accordingly. Then I used salted butter and parm cheese instead. It was a hit. I plan on trying this again with new flavor combination for the polenta.

Never had or made polenta before. Interesting! Kind of like corn mashed potatoes... Couldn't decide if I should give this recipe 4 stars or 5. I subbed water for chicken broth and cheddar for Parmesan. It's good as is... its GREAT with the changes! I also LOOOOOVE butter but misread the recipe and only put in 2 tb. Who knew, but you really don't need all that butter! And I NEVER cut butter out of anything!
This stuff expands as you cook it so make sure your pot isn't super full when you start off.

I made this last night for a groupd of family and friends.  Like others, I substituted chicken broth for the water, used 1% milk b/c that's what we buy (and it's healthier), and used a combination of parmesan and low-fat cheddar for the cheese.  I kicked up the flavor a bit w/ the addition of some Wildtree Herbs' Onion and Chive seasoning blend but you could use a little diced onion or dehydrated onion and chives. (Everyone raved and raved over this quick and easy side dish which complimented a wonderful meatloaf my sister made!  Great alternative to mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again!

Followed the recommendation of others and used chicken stock instead of water, reduced the salt to 1 tsp., and used half milk/half cream.

Good basic recipe.  I've modified it by adding 2 cloves garlic as well as crushed red pepper flakes.  I've also tried both parmesan and cheddar cheeses... parmesan wins, hands down.

This turned out fairly well, but based on all of the modifications that I made, I have to give this recipe only 4 stars. I followed other reviewers suggestions and sub'd chicken broth for the water. I also used a mixture of cheddar, pepper jack and Parmesan cheese. Next time I will either use the pepper jack or the Parmesan, but not both. I would also recommend that for at least the first few minutes, the mixture needs to be stirred constantly. Once I got everything mixed in I let it sit for at most two minutes ( the recipe says every 3-4 minutes) and when I went back to stir it, I had all liquid on top and a thick layer of polenta on the bottom. I got most of the lumps out, but this was definitely not one of my better attempts at making polenta.

Excellent flavor!  This is one that I will add the the recipe box to use again and again...especially with all the great variations that have been suggested.  I made exactly according to plan and think it would be awesome with a chunky vegetable ragout served over it.

Polenta can be a pain to make, but this recipe is easy, foolproof and delicious.  I made it with 2% milk and substituted chicken broth for water and 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan for the cheddar cheese.  Looking forward to trying it with cheddar, because now we're going to have polenta more often!

This polenta is wonderful!  It's like cheese grits on steroids!  I used locally milled corn meal and a little more cheese (and a little Nature's Seasoning and a dash or two of garlic powder).  The kids love it!  I'll be sure to make it again!

So very good!  I can't wait to make this again and and again....  I followed other's advice and mixed all the ingredients (except the butter and cheese) while they were cold, and then turned on the heat.  Once it was thick I added the butter and cheese and stirred until melted.    Simple and delicious!

This was very good; however, I made the mistake of using cornmeal MIX which made it too salty.  I will make it again and omit some of the kosher salt.

This recipe was fantastic!  I have made it twice now, first as the recipe is written and then the other time with a few changes of my own.  I used stock instead of water and subbed out the Cheddar cheese for fresh Parmesan. Wonderful!

very good. Didn't know if I'd like polenta or not but I was pleasantly surprized. Nice and creamy and cheesy.

I also used parmesean cheese and it came out perfect.  Cut the recipe in half for two of us. You'll want to keep an eye on the consistency and add more water if needed so it's not too dry. Molto bene!

Very creamy and tasty.  I added the corn flour to cold mixture and used a wisk to mix it for no clump mixture. I used cheddar and monterey cheese.  Excellent!

I had never made polenta before but my boyfriends mother used to make it for him all the time when he was little.  I followed the directions completely and felt that while it tasted really good, it was a little too thick. I think I might use extra milk next time.  Tasted great though!!

I've never had polenta before, but I've seen it pre-made in the stores.  I made this and it was very good. Next time will use chicken stock and maybe some tomatoes or even tomato sauce. Very good! Thanks for sharing.

Used this recipe to make polenta for the first time and it was a hit!  I stuck to the cheddar cheese because I wasn't looking for a parmesan flavor.  I served it with steaks and baked potatoes.  Will make this again!

This is exactly what I was looking for...I was trying to mimic a cheesy polenta that I got from the deli.  I altered the recipe a little bit...I ended up using instant polenta because that's all I could find.  Using instant polenta made this a very speedy dish, cook for 1 minute once you add to the boiling water, milk, and salt - although I'll probably use regular polenta when I can find it, and cream, to enhance the creaminess of this dish.  In addition, I substituted a blend of 3/4 cup italian cheeses (the blend had mozzarella, smoked provolone, parmesan and romano cheeses) because I prefer that to cheddar.  I topped the dish with an extra sprinkle of cheese, and served it as a main dish.

This is the first time making polenta and I think I really screwed it up.  Like others suggested I used chicken stock instead of water reserving 1 cup of stock to mix the cornmeal in.  When I poured in the cornmeal misture it almost immediately became thick while stirring.  I was afraid to let it cook any longer because I thought it would burn.  I poured it in a small pan and let it set up, when I tasted it, it was grainey.  I will try and cut it and fry it and see how it turns out.

What a yummy polenta! Definately follow the directions and stir every 3-4 minutes to avoid lumps. Also, I used 2% milk and half the butter. Delicious! A definate keeper!

Overall, I enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have chicken broth, so I added a chicken boullion cube w/ the milk and water to give it more flavor.  The problem I ran into was that I kept needing to add more liquid during cooking to keep it from turning into a sticky mess.

My husband wanted me to give it a four but I think five. He did not use the marinara sauce and I did. I also used chicken broth in place of the water. It did give it extra flavor. Very good and easy. Nice change from potatoes and/or rice or pasta. We ate this with grilled pork chops and kale. Different and good! More folks should try it.

I love this recipe as a quick side to almost any dish. I also leave out the cheese and use this recipe with 1/2 finely chopped poblano pepper to make polenta with spicier dishes or 1/8 tsp finely chopped mint to accent sweetly marinated meats.

Yummy!  I made it with a little extra cornmeal about half cup more because my husband likes it a bit more firm.  It turned out great when paired with pork chops.

Excellent polenta recipe.  Served it as a bed for a bbq'd porkchop sprinkled with fresh thyme...delicious!  Also, I agree that it did not take the full 20 minutes to cook.

Very rich flavor and simple--I covered with marinara and soy crumbles with steamed spinach--it was easy and comforting--needed no where near 20 minutes.

Fantastic!  I made it exactly as written, except it didn't need anywhere near 20 minutes.  It was done after about 7-8.  Will definitely be making this again.  Very easy and with ingredients you always have on hand.

This is THE most flavorful, creamiest polenta I have ever made.  I had mostly moldy cheddar, so I used half cheddar and half mozzarella, and it was really delicious.

Yummy!  This was my first attempt at polenta and it turned out perfectly - my polenta was also cooked in about 3 minutes.  I did cut the recipe in half and the only change I made was to add both cheddar and provolone cheeses, the end result was really good.

I too made some changes: chicken stock, milk, and water combination instead of straight water.  I used a combo of cheddar and parmesan cheeses.  Like another writer, I also found my cornmeal cooked within about 5 minutes, so still a lot to prevent huge clumps.  But overall a tasty, healthy, side dish.

I've had better.  Maybe some chicken boullion??? It was totally lacking in flavor and a total waste of my delicious cheese!

I followed the recipe exactly and was not happy with the results. No flavor, I added extra cheese and seasonings and it didn't help.

Sooo good.  I doubled the recipe and there was so much extra.  But I ate it for days... breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I didn't mind.  (I also added a little extra cheese.)
