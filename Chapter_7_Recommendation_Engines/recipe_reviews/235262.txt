There're is nothing to help emulsify the vinegar and oil so they pretty much separated, I need to play with that because the flavors work well.  My grill is snowbound so I broiled the chops and that worked out well.  And as a bonus it is a use for the fancy pomegranate vinegar I was given for Christmas.  I also didn't marinate for the length of time suggested because I was afraid my chops were starting to look like Chinese pork, but I may let it go longer next time.  Thanks, Denise, this is a nice addition to my pork chop recipes.
