The three day waiting period was so annoying because it filled up the fridge.  The end result was not worth it either they  were fine but tasted more like the ingredients than toffee.

I had a hard time figuring out what part of these ingredients created the "toffee".....Could the "3 day waiting period" do something to cause the toffee flavor to develop? LOL......come on!
  I picked right up on the bar part with the flour and sugar, but somewhere the original contributor left the toffee part out.... please do refer to the other toffee bar recipes on this site,..they are great.

These were unbelievable.  I still haven't figured out if the directions to store them for 3 days before serving was a joke.  They were so good, and only lasted 1 1/2 days.
