My girls and I taste-tested different cappuccino recipes from here to use for Christmas gifts. This was our favorite though we will be adding more powdered sugar as we like ours a bit sweet.

Yeck! I only made it because I had some instant coffee that I didn't want to waste. Not good.

Love this stuff. The first time I tried it I didn't care for it much because it wasn't what I was expecting but each time I drank it I liked it more and more. Now it's my favorite. I'm going to mix some up for gifts this Christmas.

This is very good. A combination of subtle flavors of chocolate and coffee. Neither one is really strong so this may not be the recipe for a real coffee lover. Its a very mellow warm drink. Thanks Mary.

This is a great treat!! I did change it a bit since I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I used instant chocolate pudding powder for the chocolate drink mix. I also used allspice instead of nutmeg and I didn't have any instant coffee so I just made a pot of strong coffee and used this recipe as a "creamer". I added it all to the food processor and made sure it was well mixed. I plan to try it again after I get all the right ingredients and give as gifts along with a mug a serving spoon and one of the biscotti recipes I found here too!!! A
