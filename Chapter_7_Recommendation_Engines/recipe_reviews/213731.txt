Absolutely fantastic! I was pleasant surprised by this casserole.  The only thing I changed was to add 1 garlic clove, crushed and grated and also grated a carrot and added some parsley.  Very good flavor and fairly easy recipe to follow.  Will definitely be making this again.

I really enjoyed this twist on a tuna casserole recipe. Being gluten sensitive, I mixed cornstarch with some of the milk and stirred it into the melting butter instead of making a flour paste. This worked quite well. I also added garlic and basil to add flavor.

This was pretty good. It came out a little dry, so next time I'll make sure the gravy is thinned out a bit. I used less rice (1/2 cup before cooking) and two 7oz cans of tuna. I sprinkled a little garlic powder and garlic salt in the gravy, and topped the casserole with parsley. This is very similar to tuna casserole. I might add peas and a little cheese to the mix next time.

This was sweet for my college budget. Didn't have any onion, but the recipe was still flavorful especially with a little bit of Parmesan cheese and Frank's Red Hot on top! (put that s**t on everything)

Surprisingly delicious! I have made this twice now! My husband loves it and so do I! I don't really like the taste of canned tuna, and didn't want to make a traditional casserole. This fit the bill! This recipe is now a standard!

No your eyes deceiving you!! It does look like there are green beans in the dish.   had to do a double take.  I think the bowl is a dark green glasss and that is what viewers are seeing.  Doesn't make it look as good as it is.  The recipe is delicious and simple.  I would add some things like cheese or other items that viewers mentioned.

Delicious!  Simple (And cheap!) to make, my family of 4 loved it, although next time I will double ingredients.  Added mixed veggies.

My husband and I made this together tonight, and as we made it we would only give it 3 stars. I hate to say that as we did not have onion and we added peas like a tuna casserole. We will try it again, but as others have added garlic, and more veggies. Thanks for the filling dish however!

I used brown rice instead of white.  I also used onion powder instead of grated onion.  I like the idea of the recipe, but next time I think I will saute yellow onion and add that.  Also, I think some low fat cheddar mixed in would do a lot for this.  Over all, loved it!

I must have done something totally wrong-but I followed the directions to a T. This was not only a pretty taxing dish to make (not to mention the amount of cleanup needed afterwards!) but the results were not worth all the effort put into the prep. I was hoping for a new twist on a boring tuna casserole but I found myself longing for the same old familiar food I was trying to replace. Back to the drawing board...

Disappointing and bland. I'm wondering if I did something wrong. It certainly didn't wow us. I have a lot of it left over. I think maybe some roasted red pepper or green peas might help it. Doubt that I will make this again

Very tasty!  It seemed to be a fair amount of work but well worth it.  I used almond milk and canola oil in place of the dairy products and it was terrific.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. My family thought it was "just okay". Rather bland. It's a good idea that's looking for some kick! I may try it again but will add some spices and some peas, a touch of hot sauce? It just needs something more.......

I had to change the recipe quite a bit to make it taste better. I added a clove of garlic, a carrot (grated), a cup of sweet peas and a cup of parmesan. Next time, I will also saute the onion instead of adding it raw.

I thought this was very tasty, and my husband even deemed it "a keeper."  I do think it needs a bit more flavor, and I would add peas and cheddar cheese next time.  The only change I made was the onion - we used a finely chopped small bunch of chives from our garden, and this added the nice onion flavor and a bit of color.  I wish this didn't take quite so much orep time (and dirty dishes), but I definitely found this worth the effort.

Really good taste, but needs color. Will try again next time with some parsley or peas, etc. A little time intensive, but tasty.

I had high hopes for this but was unfortunately disappointed.  I whipped the egg whites into stiff peaks and followed the recipe exactly.  However it turned out to be just a casserole and did not 'puff' at all.  I also found it to be quite bland.

I really liked this recipe, but I did not have tuna so I added a can of crabmeat. Very good. Next time I would add hot sauce to the cream sauce and cheese. I would also add some color with green onions, too.

i was surprised when my boys didn't like this because they are big fans of tuna casserole.  if i were to make it again, i would definitely leave out the egg whites, i think that would make a positive difference.

Very good, but seemed like a lot of work.  I added just a few shakes of garlic powder, but that was it.  (Used brown rice as thats what was in house).  Hubby gave a 9 out of 10 stars, that means its made the cut to go in my actual recipe box  :)

This was yummy.  I made it for my family of five and we all enjoyed it.  My husband usually doesn't like tuna, but he even liked it.  I did add some garlic powder for a little more flavor.  The directions were easy to follow also.  I am taking dinner to my mom, who had surgery on her trachea, when she gets home from the hospital and I think instead of soup I'll make this.  It will be easy for her to eat.  I know she will want the recipe.  Thank you.

I love it!  So did my kids, who usually don't like tuna.  I can see where this recipe could easily be customized any number of ways.  I can tell this will become a "go to" recipe!  Delish!  Thanks for sharing!

this is really good/has a light lemon flavor. I also found that making this without the tuna in it makes a really good side dish. I made mine with brown rice to add a nutty flavor to it. My only change was to use half the salt. A dish this small does not need a whole tsp of salt and I try to keep things healthy around here. The flavor is really "light". If you want more robust flavor it will need to be jazzed up. I think next time I make it I will try adding saffron which will compliment the very delicate flavor. FWIW I use a real tuna steak flaked up in mine...I have no fondness for the canned stuff.

I added peas and a little celery salt.  Sprinkled with a little cheddar cheese.  Interesting texture and very delicious.  Family loved it.  Husband even brought up hours later how good it was.  Very modifiable recipe.

Delicious.  Rice was much better than tuna noodle casserole.  I may experiment and add a veggie next time like; thinnly sliced tomatoes? Brocolli or asparagus?  It was great  for saving money.  Thanks a bunch!

It turned out great but there just wasn't enough flavor to it.  Think if I make it again I will add peas.

5 stars for budget friendly, 3 stars for the amount of dishes which is comparable to making lasagna but you can either pop them in the dishwasher or spend 5-7 minutes doing by hand. My prep time was much longer than stated here. 
I chopped up 1/4 of a yellow onion and sauteed both the onion and mushrooms together with salt, onion, garlic powder and parsley.
I drained most of the water from the can of tuna.
I allowed my rice to rest 15-20 minutes after cooking with chicken stock  with the lid off before adding it to the roux so the rice would not turn into a gooey mess once mixed. I also added about a 1/2 cup of frozen peas, more garlic and parsley to the mix as well. During the last few minutes of cooking I topped with shredded Mexican Four Cheeses. I then turned my toaster oven (Breville) to broil and broiled for an additional 2-3 minutes on high. 
The taste:  a little dry (my fault, I drained the tuna). Not bad, but not necessarily 5 stars and I made changes. If I were to make again, I would make the roux a little thinner. As is, this recipe falls into a 3.5 category.

It was relatively easy to make, but I got a lot of pans and utensils dirty getting it all together.  You could almost skip the baking step if you forgot to turn on the oven:) My husband and preteen liked it, the toddler has a food texture issue and wouldn't touch it.  I liked it.

My husband was looking for the hot sauce even after I added a bunch of spices (garlic, mustard, cayenne, and onion powder) .  I also added peas as another reviewer had suggested.

Mmmmmm.... Marcy this dish was so yummy! Next time I will have to double the recipe since there just wasn't enough to use a main dish for two parents and two teenagers! I will also make this as a side dish to impress my guests! Thank-you:)

Came out pretty good! I used cornstarch instead of flour because I'm gluten intolerant. Only downsides are that it was a bit bland and not very filling. I recommend added your favorite spices to it.

It was ok. Pretty bland. I added hot sauce and more salt and it was passable. Quite a lot of work for a rather mediocre dish.

IT'S SO FLUFFY!! I don't have a big oven, so I used a round, deep casserole dish. I got this awesome fluffy result that is so tasty! 
The only changes to the recipe I made were to add in some small pieces of bacon and not measure anything :-p

I love this tuna casserole! Total comfort food. I left out the onions, however sprinkled Gruyere cheese to the top about 10 minutes prior to taking it out of the oven. I also sprinkled a little Fleur de sel right after dishing it up. Yum!

Very good but whip the egg whites just before you fold them in - not first. Also, I garnished this casserole with shredded Asiago cheese for a nice touch.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a nice homey casserole. I thought it was good, but I'm intrigued about adding another ingredient or two to make it really be outstanding. My two year old had seconds and even asked for thirds!

Too much work for not enough flavor.  I even added roasted garlic and New Mexican red chili.
