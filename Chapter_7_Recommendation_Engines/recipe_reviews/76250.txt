The topping was great.  I used 3 large, really ripe pears and 1 large apple and it was perfect.  I used 4 graham crackers because the organic brand I have seemed smaller than most graham crackers, plus you can never have too much topping when making a crisp.  It's the best part.

I made this for my uncle, who is diabetic.  He loved it.  I will definitely make this again!  I used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in the filling rather than 1/2 teaspoon.

This is a very tasty recipe, not too sweet.  I increased the pears to 4 cups because 3 cups seemed too skimpy, and it was great.

This was as easy to make as it was delicious.  I didn't feel like dragging out my food processor so I substituted 1/2 cup of quick oats for the graham crackers and used a fork to cut the butter into the topping mix.  I also didn't peel the pears.  :-)

Absolutely delicious!!  My husband loves this more than the traditional oats topping...and have to admit so do I.  I used real sugar this time, but will try it with splenda next time or just less sugar.  Just a little too sweet for my tastebuds, but otherwise out of this world.  I used about 6 pears from my father's pear tree...scrumptious!  Served with ice cream.

I made this with regular sugar (didn't have Splenda). It turned out great. I will use this recipe again but may use other fruits, such as peaches or apples. A great low calorie dessert!

Used light butter - think I'll melt it next time before adding it to the food processor for a more uniform crumb topping.  Yummy - thanks for the low-cal dessert recipe!!

Awesome!  I didn't peel the pears, used normal sugar, accidentally dumped in a ton of cinnamon and didn't add water (which I think was a good choice).  And used a different topping.  It was just wonderful.

Not one person in my Bunco group could tell that this was sugar free. They all wanted the recipe. I did not peel the pears, and actually mixed several colors for a pretty presentation!

My husband and I loved this dish, it was also better than any apple crisp we had ever had.  I took another reviewer's advice about making extra topping (I only added more graham crackers though as not to add more fat) and that was a plus. I added a few chopped pecans on top too, delish!

This recipe was not only easy to make it tastes great!  I made one adaption, I replaced the graham crackers with 8-9 Sugar Free Ginger Snaps in the crumb topping.  Not only is this a great dessert, served warm makes for a great low fat breakfast treat!

I used this recipe to make individual pear crisps in little oven proof baking ovals (I can't remember what they are called)they turned out delicious and all they needed was a dab of whipping cream or ice cream.
