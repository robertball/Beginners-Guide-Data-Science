Followed the recipe and this came out great. The edges were a little dry and I was looking for something creamier, but I made two of these and they were so rich we had trouble finishing the second!

Oh my gosh. I was wanting to make something chocolate last night so after some searching I decided on this. Who doesn't love cheesecake and who doesn't love chocolate right? I did make a different crust out of oreos because that is what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. I have to say it was better the next day, but I figured it would be because it was completely chilled. It's a must  try!

This was a fantastic cheesecake! I made one change and only because I had a substitute ingredient on hand instead of what was called for. I used chocolate cookie crumbs instead of graham crumbs and it was perfect. I baked it for the suggested time and then shut the oven off and let it sit in the oven for about 5 hours, took it out and tossed it in the fridge for 24 hours and served it for Easter dinner dessert. It was easy to make and very rich!

Oh my...This was absolutely delicious and super easy to make.  I had just about everything on hand and I didn't change a thing.  Hubby said I need to make this more often (I don't think my waistline would agree!!)

I have made this cheesecake at least 9 times according to my notes on the recipe. I'm making it again tomorrow for a book club. Delicious!

This year's Easter dessert, along with a bananas foster upside-down cake! AMAZING cheesecake, very rich, even with one block of lo-fat cream cheese! I had my usual issue with cracking, but covered it with more chocolate, which added to the decadence. The only change I made was omit the sugar in the crust. I'd give it eleven stars if the ratings went that high!

I have made this many times and it is a favorite. 
I have used mint cookies in place of the "nilla wafers called for in the crust and that was a HIT!  
The texture of this cheesecake is smooth and silky. 
I do use a water bath baking it and I think it takes a bit longer but it is always moist.

This cheesecake turned out great. I added raspberry swirl for my kids and they loved it. I have two that request this every birthday. I also used strawberry swirl for my husband. The fruit swirl helps with the richness.

Delicious, very easy to make. I used a graham cracker crust, however the filling is absolutely delicious, smooth and so creamy. Please note that the flavor enhances by refrigerating over night. I won't mention how many calories this has.

I have made it for work several times and everyone loves it, including myself. So rich, and thick it only takes a sliver to sate the pallet. Making it this time for family Thanksgiving.

Excellent cheesecake. I didn't have any vanilla wafers on hand, so I used graham crackers instead. I think I'd like it better with vanilla wafers, so I'll be sure to have those next time I make this. The consistency and flavor of the cheesecake is wonderful. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious! I substituted crushed graham cracker crumbs for the vanilla wafer crumbs because I had them on hand. This recipe was to die for! Chocolate lovers will really enjoy this!!

I've been making this cheesecake for years and it's absolutely the best chocolate cheesecake I've ever tasted.  You will not be disappointed!  My daughter calls it "Heaven on Earth".
