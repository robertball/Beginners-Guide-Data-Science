Moist and delicious are two good adjectives to describe this cake.  It has a nice light pistachio taste.  I made using Sprite soda and toasted the pecans and added toasted coconut.  We really like cold cake so that was a plus in our book.  The flavor did increase on the second day.  Everyone enjoyed this cake and I will be making it again.

So, I gotta tell ya.  I was in one of those "try something new" moods and I stumbled on this recipe.  Very good!  The whole family really enjoyed it and with it being so hot it was much better than a tried-and-true chocolate cake or something of the like.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This cake is good and easy to make. However it is not as attractive as I was led to believe and only 1/2 the oil is needed or it is too wet.

I made the cake using applesauce instead of oil. I also used whipping cream instead of cool whip and added the toasted coconut to the frosting. My family liked the cake so I will make again.

I didn't read the frosting directions adequately before proceeding, it call for 2 cups of whipped topping...not a full container of cool whip! 
Fools rush in :) 
Still tastes great, I added a drop of green food coloring and topped it with chopped pistachios.

I made this for Easter and the adults really loved it!  My daughter and son both love pastachio (sp?) pudding so they thought it was great, my daughter is graduating college this year, and my son is 12, so it really is accepted by all people.  The other children there tasted it but I didn't hear anything like I heard from the adults!

This was a great light and fluffy cake. Not too heavy to serve after a meal. And yummy too!
