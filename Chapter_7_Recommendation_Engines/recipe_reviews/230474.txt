The chicken had a lot of flavor and was very moist.  20 minutes after flipping my 3 1/2 pound chicken it was only about 125 degrees in the thigh.  It took another 25 minutes at 350 to reach 165 degrees.  The final product was worth the effort, though.

The only changes I made were to go a little short on the sesame oil (which I didn't really need to do but didn't want to ruin it for me) and to use scallions rather than chives.  I was hesitant at first to use all the garlic, but it worked out great.  Because of my timing of preparing this, I mixed up the spread, put most of it on the bird, and then refrigerated it.  When I got ready to bake it, I took it from the fridge but didn't really let it come to room temperature.  The downside of this was that it took a little longer to bake than if I'd have followed the directions exactly.  I did save off a couple tablespoons of the butter spread to baste it after taking off the foil.  Moist, tender, and yummy!  I don't know how much butter you actually ingest because there was a lot in the bottom of the pan, but I didn't really worry about that.  Very yummy!

This recipes is awesome!  I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to substitute 2 tsp. ground cumin for the coriander, 1 1/2 tsp lemon extract for the lemon zest, 1 tsp. dried thyme leaves, and green onion instead of the chives.  It still turned out great.

I don't think that as much butter called for is necessary.  After prepping this chicken there was butter everywhere, and it took me forever to wash all the butter off my hands.  I also would have thought using at least some of the lemon juice and orange juice would have boosted the flavor.

Disappointing.  Too much butter and I didn't find the sesame oil added anything.    I couldn't taste it.  I had to cook it 30 minutes at 400 to get the skin to crisp.  Not enough flavor for all the work.  I couple of lemons in the cavity adds more flavor.

I was very disappointed  with the outcome of this recipe especially because I did it for my New Year's Eve supper.  I followed the directions and didn't have problems with the texture but the taste was not what I expected.  It lacked the juices of the lemons and orange.  As a matter of fact I found it a little bitter from all the zest.  Not a keeper for me.

I love highly seasoned food and that is why this recipe appealed to me. I rate recipes on the amount of prep needed to create a great end product.
The method of roasting is a keeper. The bird was the most tender of any I have cooked. Having said that, the first thing that hits your taste buds is salt and then garlic. I can only review because I followed this recipe to the letter. My husband told me to make chicken the way I usually do.
The seasonings are over the top for this little bird. In no way does it show all of the work that went into it.  Way over the top in seasoning and butter.
