I love this one. I use regular cream of chicken soup and leave the chops sit in the mustard for a while before I coat and cook them. Easy and full of flavor.

This recipe sounded really quick, easy, and good. My husband and I both like mustard so I was excited about it, but I think that cooking it in the soup took away most of the mustard's flavor. I might make this again, but they tasted mostly like chicken and rice soup, not like mustardy pork chops. Also, the cooking time was not long enough if you're using pork chops with a bone.

Very nice. I used just chicken stock instead of the soup for a lighter option, and it worked beautifully.

thank you for this wonderful recipe
my husbond loved so much he ate two whole chops. I am not crazy for pork chop, but this one is great.
I would not change anything about this recipe.

This turned out really good. I didnt have canned soup so I made Chicken and Rice soup from scratch, I made enough for the pork chops and then for leftover soup for the next day.

Awesome Recipe!  Only thing I did different was to add about 2 tsp of horseradish mustard to the prepared mustard and my eaters all loved it!  Thanks!

This is a recipe that has been in my family for many years.  My mother-in-law had a German background but lived in Louisiana the first part of her marriage.  She said they "passed the mustard" over the pork chops.  Sometimes, I add an extra can of chicken with rice soup so that there will be plenty of "gravy" and serve with rice.  So good!

I used French's Smoky Mustard, and let them marinade for two days, because we changed our minds on dinner that night.  I also used Cream of Chicken soup because it was what I had on hand.  We had some last minute guests, so I chopped up the meat up before I cooked it.  My husband who was stationed in Germany said that the meal had a Bavarian flavor, and the guests gobbled it up, and even asked for the recipe!  Tonight with the leftovers I am making some rice and adding some sauteed mushrooms too it as well.  I will definitely make again, hopefully keeping the pork chops whole this time.

After frying the pork chops I put them in a crock pot, add the soup and 1/2 can of water then add raw rice to your liking, or following water-rice ratio on rice package .  I start with a cold crock and cook on low all day while at work.  The flour thickens the soup to a gravy.  Make sure you have enough water so it doesn't dry out.

These were delicious! My husband raved...and he usually thinks that cooking pork chops in anything but cream of mushroom soup is too complicated. I used a combination of whole-grain Dijon & a sweet/spicy garlic mustard to make them, and it was well-received by my dinner guests for sure. My husband and I were fighting over the leftovers for lunch the next day!

My grandma used to make these, using chicken noodle soup, placing the noodles on top of the cooked chops.  I withheld this recipe the first three years of my marriage because my husband hates porkchops, and one day decided to make them.  This is my husband's favorite dish (besides lasagna).  Also,  I never equated this with being a German recipe, but I forgot my grandma was German!

I was a little hesitant about the combination. Mustard, undiluted condensed soup. Made me a little nervous!  But it was delicious!  I'm not a huge mustard fan but the chicken soup and mustard were an awesome combination!  I didn't have chicken and rice soup, just cream of chicken soup and it was a very nice combination. I served it over steamed white rice with sauerkraut on the side. Lovely recipe that we will keep! Thank you for sharing!

I loved these pork chops! I didn't have the chicken with rice soup so I used cream of chicken instead and they were great, I will try the chicken with rice next time. I was worried that the mustard might be overwhelming but it gave them a very nice flavor.

Great recipe. Easy !!  It does not need a thing added or omitted.  However, that being said...if you are a pretty seasoned cook...you can vary this dish in many ways to suit your taste and likings. Look at others thoughts and reviews !

Fast and easy to prepare.  My kids loved this recipe. I found it very greasy however; perhaps the next time I make this I will top the chops with wild rice and use a low sodium chicken broth - I think that the mustard is salty enough - don't need the extra salt in the soup.

This was really good; I am going to try it next time using a German brown mustard.  I served it over rice and poured the juice over it. It needed more juice tho.

Made this tonight for the BF and we loved it. Might have liked a little more mustard flavor and I did let the chops sit in mustard for a bit before cooking, but still tasted great! Might try spicy mustard next time. Had enough rice but we wanted another chop! Will definitely make again>

the coating of mustard and flour on top; is more like yellow play dough, not long after it sits in the hot oil all of the breading falls off and leaves a bare pork chop.

So I tried this and I love it! I think key is to marinade chops in mustard for several hours then dredge in flour,wash with an egg batter then re-dredge in flour.This helps keep the "mustard crust" from falling off in the pan frying process.Also while pan frying no matter the topping it's best not to turn the meat more than once, it's hard but wait the 7 to 9 minutes before turning, too soon and it will mess your crust right up! Sooo to whomever said cook until the juices run clear, obviously has not cooked with a sauce. Hello!?! How are you supposed to see the "clear" juices running out of the meat if you can't even see the meat? Timer folks. I hate using a timer but when I can't see the meat it's very important. They can say 3 minutes per 1/4 in cut of meat BUT do you have your ruler out measure your meat cut? I don't, so start with the above rule of thumb then trial and error it with a timer until you get it just right then WRITE DOWN HOW LONG IT TAKES! :) I used 2 inch chops and this recipe took me about an hour and a half give or take from beginning to end. I used Cream of chicken as I had no chicken and stars. I added 3/4 of a can of milk to the soup so it wouldn't simmer dry also allows the mustard flavor to shine thru.I added 1 minute rice to the chops after i added the soup.Because my chops were so thick I needed to add some liquid to my sauce at the end, I simply whisked more milk into the leftover can and added as needed. Other then that no changes and I LOVED IT!

It was very good. I used Peju Red Pepper Mustard, which gave it a nice specie taste and used some dry white wine and not the chicken and rice soup.

This was OK, but nothing I would rush to make again.  It tasted like pork chops with chicken and rice soup.  Both are good, but it's less work just to serve separately

Something different from you average fried pork chop. I tried this recipe for the first time and my family enjoyed it; especially my toughest critic my dad.

My BF really liked these, to me they were kind of bland. One can of soup hardly put any rice over all 4 chops. It wasn't bad but it just wasn't anything that stands out either. Wouldn't make again, but wanted to at least give it a try cause it sounded interesting and different.

Made exactly as written.  My husband seemed to like it, but I thought it was pretty bland.  Kids ate, but nobody raved about it.

I would warn that you need to drain the soup before using it on the porkchops.  I did not do this and it left the meat very soggy.  I also did not like the mustard taste.  I thought that if the mustard was more prominent it would have tasted much better.  But, instead it was a faint mustard taste which I disliked.

Really good! My husband, who isn't a big fan of mustard, liked these a lot. The end product doesn't taste real "mustardy"; just pleasantly flavorful. I didn't have chicken rice soup, so just made chicken broth with bouillon and threw in some leftover rice from the fridge. Yum!

This was really good, my daughter said to make it this way every time. I tried it with cream of mushroom. I may vary the mustard next time just to see.

This was an easy and quick dinner to make. EVERYONE was raving how good it was! I would definitely make this recipe again, but will have to double the amount because everyone wanted seconds. Thanks! This was great tasting pork chops

Like her hubby, I generally don't fancy mustard, but some Kosciusko did just the trick on the chops. My flatmate has a gluten thing, so I traded over the flour with cornmeal, and the taste was top drawer. If I can’t muff this up, it’s a sure outcome for any novice.

I made this dish for my friend that was raised eating many bohemian dishes . Served with pierogi and sauerkraut. We all liked it , full of flavor . Sauce was rich and yummy used cream of chicken soup . Well make again .  After reading reviews I put the mustard in a bowl  and covered both sides of the pork cutlets by dipping into mustard  . A light slather would not have given the flavor needed .

I simplified this recipe quite a bit, just brushing German mustard on both sides of chops, browning both sides of chops in cast iron skillet, added chicken bouillon and water, covered and cooked on low heat til done.  Moist, tasty, and easy.

I made this for myself, and used two chops. Had the second one two days later and it was as delicious as the first one. For one or two people there was enough rice for the meal, I added chicken broth to have enough to make the gravy. If you need more rice, just make it on the side.
excellent one pan dish.Both my parents were German, but this must have been a 1950r 60,s dish I think. Very good then and now.

I grew up with this EXACT recipe, in fact when I was little, I thought it was the only way you could cook pork chops .  I've tried other ways to make them, but I always come back to this one.  There's just something about the mustard that makes it so good.

I thought it was excellent. The only problem was DH thought that when he rewarmed the chops the mustard was too strong. He asked maybe next time dont use mustard. I told him NO WAY. I loved them with the mustard.
