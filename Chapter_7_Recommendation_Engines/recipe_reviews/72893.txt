Made these tonight to go along with burgers and salad. I actually tried preparing them 2 different ways. First, I simply fried the potatoes just like fries and then after taking them out of the oil, I sprinkled them w/the garlic salt and ranch mixture.  Then, I did my second batch exactly as the recipe stated. Both ways came out good. The 2nd way did dirty my oil up pretty fast...as another reviewer mentioned. (ok ok i recycle my oil :-))  I liked the flavor of the fries better when I added it at the very end. Both ways are good though!!! Didn't last on the table.

These hardly made it to the table. We have a pizza place that makes potatoes similar to these and we love them. Now I have a recipe I can modify to be more like the ones we love so well. We dipped ours in ranch. If you like them crispy, slice extra thin. Also the ranch/garlic dip was not enough for my 3 large potatoes. Have extra ranch mix on hand, or use smaller potatoes.

These were pretty good..  I dried the potatoes and tossed them with olive oil and baked them in a 400 degree oven for about  40 minutes (I cut the fries pretty big)  Didn't want the seasoning to burn so after about 30 mins I sprinkled the seasoning on and let it go.  Worked out pretty well.  Thanks for posting the recipe

I will never buy frozen french fries again! These were fabulous! Even after they had cooled off my family kept snacking on them. Perfect as a side dish or just a fun snack!

I pre cooked the potatoes to speed up the process.  I seasoned these with pesto sauce and EVOO to coat.  I put then them in the oven in a pre-heated cast iron skillet, so the oil wouldn't make a mess in the oven.  They were very yummy!!

These got mixed reviews at the dinner table. Some people really liked them, others really didn't. I think that it is actually my fault that they didn't work. I don't think that I spread the ranch mixture evenly on all of the fries, so some of them had a really strong taste and some did not. If I ever do this recipe again, I will only use one or two potatoes for the same amount of mixture instead of three.

I love these fries. I actually cooked the fries first before adding them to the ranch mix and it turned out absolutely deeee-lish!
