Josie, this was a very good rub and process to prepare the brisket. I knew going into this I did not want to boil the brisket in a pot of water. The brisket was so tender and juicy, there was barely a chance to cut it into slices. Not complaining, and neither was anyone else in my family. There are hardly any leftovers from the three of us who eat meat in the house. My brisket was only 3lbs.  I baked it in a roasting pan with  foil  tightly on top of roasting pan and put the roasting pan lid on top of that for 6 hours at 275 F. I know you recomended 250 F and maybe thats why it was just fall apart delicious.
   The ony things I did differently were minimal. I know everyone has their likes and ideas of what they want to do, or, have no idea, and thats what brings them to this site.
   So, this is what I did different. I used only 3 cups of Guinness Extra Stout, and made a 1 cup vegetable broth, of which I only used 1/2 cup, or so. To that broth I added, 1/2 tsp. horseradish (prepared), 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 tsp. worcestershire. In the bottom of roaster I put 3 pcs. of celery, to keep brisket off bottom, onions, then brisket on top. Added stout, vegetable broth (slowly) over top and put carrots,  around it.
   In the city of "Constant Chaos", great food will keep them quiet, for a bit...

This recipe turned out really well.  I followed everything, except I used fresh garlic and onions instead of the powders for the rub.  My only complaint is that the final drippings were quite bitter because of the Guinness and did not make a good gravy.  I didn't like wasting all that beautiful flavour.  Next time I will reduce the Guinness and maybe add more water or beef broth.

Made exactly as written and this turned out very good. The only disappointment I had was in the texture. Don't get me wrong it was super tender but I like it with a little more texture where you can slice it. This turns out more like a stringy roast beef. I did let it rest for an hour after it cooked so I'm hoping the leftovers firmed up in the fridge overnight. Regardless, this was super tasty and got a nice bark on it.

Results were inedible. My oven is partially to blame (it was recently repaired and now it runs much hotter than it used to, so the roast was overcooked), but even if the roast weren't overdone the spice mixture and flavour imparted by the Guinness were awful. I tried to make some use of the leftovers by cutting it up and masking it with a bunch of other good flavours (I'm usually good at that) but this was unsalvageable.

Wow! I'm not opposed to tinkering with a recipe but this sounded so good that I didn't change a thing.
I applied the rub to the brisket and let it sit covered in the fridge overnight.
We had guests over for dinner and everyone raved about it.
Thanks for a great recipe Josie.
