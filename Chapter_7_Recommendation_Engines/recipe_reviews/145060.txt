I've been craving these ever since I moved out of Idaho. This recipe comes really, really close to the ones I remember getting there, and I will definitely make it again.
Freezing them helps keep the batter on - not a totally necessary step, but it does help a lot.

A pretty close job but I have Milo's original recipe from the old Torch Cafe in Boise. Don't forget to use the same batter to make some onion rings or the meal is just not complete.

These were excellent!  I followed the recipe except I didn't freeze the meat strips prior to frying them.  They came out so good I can't imagine the freezing step making them any better.  My husband and my brother ate them as fast as I could fry them.  I'm lucky I got any at all.  Wonderful recipe, EmmyJay1!  Thank you.

I have the original recipe, too.  I think I will try the freezing step next time I make them, though.  It certainly makes sense.    I just wanted to say that no self-respecting Idahoan would eat finger steaks with anything other than fry sauce, which also appears to be a Southern Idaho tradition.  After living all over this darn country, I've never gotten it anywhere else.

These were excellent! My family raved about these. I didn't freeze prior to frying, we wanted to eat right away. Other than that I followed the reciepe exactly and was impressed. The seasoning was wonderful especially the Montreal steak seasoning. Thanks emmyjay for such a great recipe. I will make these again.

I have to say OMG! I followed the recipe to the letter even freezing them before cooking. It helped keep the coating on when frying. It is just my husband and I So I Fried half the batch and kept the other half frozen to cook another night... Ok I admit it was the next night!Yes they are that good!Thanks for the great recipe! :)

Loved the McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning in the buttermilk batter.  I've always just used salt, pepper, and a little bit of garlic powder but the seasoning mix adds more flavor.  I added a tsp of baking powder to the flour mixture; it makes the brown crust a bit lighter.

After partying everyone went to Milo's for something to eat, a perfect ending to a Friday or Saturday night!  Just today I sent an email to my Brother about this GREAT restaurant and its fantastic product.  Devine intervention helped me find this long lost treat tonight and I plan to share it with my wife tomorrow.  NOTHING compares to this recipe!

I've tried the recipe as-is a few times and it is REALLY good, but time consuming.  I had a hectic family day and knew dinner was going to have to be fast and on the fly, so I took a chance on speeding it up.  

I doubled the recipe and "made" buttermilk by adding 1 Tb of white vinegar for each cup of milk and let it sit for 10 min before adding it to the recipe.  (You can also use lemon juice.)  

I put every single ingredient except the meat in a large bowl and beat the tar out of it until it was a thick batter and free of lumps - like pancake batter.  It required a little more flour to accomplish this, so I added more spices to compensate.  I cut up the meat, tossed it in the batter, mixed it to coat, then covered it and threw it in the fridge for the afternoon.

When I got home, I heated up the Fry Daddy and mixed the meat/batter again.  WARNING - using the frying basket did not work for me at all!!  The batter oozed into the drain holes and the meat stuck to the bottom of the basket.  I could not get it off until the basket cooled and I could safely take a fork to it and break the meat/batter apart.

However, removing the fry basket and putting the battered meat directly into the Fry Daddy worked like a charm!  It took a little longer than 5 minutes per batch to get that beautiful brown coating, but it was so worth it!  The kids were waiting in line by the fryer because they were eating them faster than I could cook them!!  Thank you so much for the great recipe!

This was just okay for us. The kids liked it, but it was a lot of work. Followed all the directions and even froze the beef. Will not be making again.

Very yummy. The freezing is important in my opinion. These were gobbled up between another friend and I with the munchies (made less than 1/2 a batch, only had a small steak). I also make onion rings with the same coating. Served with fry sauce (duh). MMMMMmmmmmmmMMMMM!

These were good, but only good. Instead of serving them with ranch, I would go with either steak sauce or bbq.  It was a little bland for our tastes.  It's something interesting to serve at fingerfood parties.

These are quite tasty.  I made them with pre-cut steak strips for stir fry just because it was easier.  I didn't freeze them (because I didn't realize that was a step in the process), but I had no problem with the batter staying on.  They were crispy and the steak was tender.  I will defintely make them again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were very good. The best flour to use, though, is self-rising flour instead of all-purpose flour. It browns nicely and stays on the meat better. I didn't have to freeze the battered steak as the recipe suggests. I had to salt and pepper the fingers after they came out of the oil.

These were ok but I will probably not make again.  They were a little to greasy and jsut to much work for the outcome. The kids weren't to thrilled.

Very good finger steaks. I did not have any buttermilk, so I used a buttermilk substitution of 4 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice with 1 cup of milk. Served with Sweet Baby Rays Sweet n' Spicy barbecue sauce. Will certainly make again.

I'd never heard of these type of steaks (but my family is from Oregon so I knew what fry sauce was!).  We love these!  The freezing is VERY important as is making sure your oil is hot enough.

WOW!!!! I prepared these and froze them last night and then fried them for dinner this evening. DELICIOUS!!! We dipped them in 57 sauce and man were they good! My 16 month old even loved them! He has never had steak fingers before! The only change I made was I used Weber Chicago Steak seasoning because it was on sale and I had a coupon, so it came out cheaper...but it was great!!!! I will definitely make them again in the next week or so!

I followed the recipe exactly and although i dont eat beef, those who had this in my house said they was good but probably not worth the work i put into it. I'm not sure the freezing is necessary but if you do freeze, make sure they don't touch each other because they stick together...probably will not make again

Having lived in Idaho all my life this is a wonderful comfort food! The perfect way to spice up a piece of meat! We love ours with fry sauce or try it with a spicy cocktail sauce! YUMMM!!! Thanks for posting! :)

omg!!!! these fingers were sooooo great.  i made them last night.  my husband said " i dont like steak finger"   he must have at more then half the batch.!!!!  i soaked my meat in the buttermilk mixture for about 5 hrs.  i mixed it up around noon and let is soak up the goodness!  i drained the steak in a strainer breaded and let rest in the fridge till we were ready to eat they came out perfect.  no freezing and the breading was nice, flaky, and super tasty. great overall flavor!!!  i served it with homemade ranch and it was a big hit!   thanks for sharing these remind me of the steak fingers i had as a kid.  my dad made them and we called them "crisy delicouses"  !!!!!! thanks for the keeper of a recipe.

It was really good I didn't freeze it before cooking, but did let it marinade for 2 hours before cooking it was very flavorful and my kids really liked it. It is to fatty to be a weekly meal, but it was the best kind of treat. I also could see severing this as an appetizer and the next back yard bbq. Thanks

I've had steak fingers before, my Mom use to make them and always really liked having them from time to time. I found this recipe and followed it not changing anything. Marinated for 2.5 hours then placed breaded fingers in the freezer. The fingers were frozen solid. Fried in an electric skillet, about half inch of oil 5 pieces at a time.  They cooked fast, and came out medium rare in the middle. The fingers didn't last long, they were eating as snacks, breakfast and anytime walking past the fridge. They are good cold too.

Love this recipe! I served this with mashed potatoes, gravy, and steamed broccoli. Great inexpensive meal for a family of 6!

These were a big hit with my family. Some ate them with ranch, some with barbecue sauce. Either way, they were great. Thanks for the recipe!

I lived in Idaho in the 70's, and a&w had amazing ones . Add 3/4 tsp dry mustard and 2 tsp  sweet (Hungarian) paprika to the flour mix. Amazing!

Decent recipe. But if it's Idaho style it should only be served with fry sauce.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. The only thing I did differently, mainly cause I'm lazy and I didn't want to have a lot to clean up, was I put the flour, buttermilk, etc. In a bag and shook it all together, and then after that I transferred the freshly floured pieces of meat into another bag to freeze, because I didn't read the thing about putting them on a sheet to dry. After letting them sit for 40 minutes, they were mostly froze, but not together, and so I fried themlike that, worked well for me, and I'll repeat next time I make it. Delicious all around!

Just like Red Steer's finger steaks in the 70s.   Forgot how tasty these were.   But I don't remember "fry sauce"?  What the heck is that?   I lived in Boise more years than I care to remember and for the life of me I have no recollection of "fry sauce".  

I remember these being served with country gravy.   Then again, it's quite possible that I have merged the memories of  finger steaks and chicken fried steak.  Either way, they taste great with country gravy and I still have no idea what "fry sauce" is.  :-)

EDIT:  Ok, just looked it up and yes I am familar with "Fry Sauce" but I always thought it was called "Secret Sauce".  Whatever,  I'll stick with  the country gravy.

Really great recipe, but time consuming.  I followed the instructions except I added Panhandle Chicken Fried Steak Seasoning from The Savory Spice Shop to the wet batter and to the flour mix instead of the seasonings in the recipe.  It took longer to fry the pieces than the recipe called.  This makes a lot!!  I froze half and will use at a later date.  After frying the meat, I drained most of the oil, but left enough to make homemade gravy as a dipping sauce.  To the drippings I added 2 Tbs. of flour to make a roux, browned it for a few minutes, added 1 cup of beef broth and 1 cup whole milk, stirring constantly and seasoned it.  We used this to dip the steak fingers in and poured over mashed potatoes.  Delicious!

I'm from Idaho and moved to Michigan a couple of years ago. I was asking around as to where I could get good finger steaks. No one knew what I was talking about. Come to find out they're not well known outside of Idaho. Who knew. Anyway - I found this recipe and it is spot on! Absolutely love it. Thank you!

Excellent coating, and freezing does help it stay on before frying.  I didn't use all the steak fingers pryor to frying, so I stuck them into a freezer bag to pull out for a quick meal later on.

These are very good.  Made the exactly as directed.  I made too many so I left half of them in the freezer for about two weeks before I fried them and they turned out great.

All I have to say is OMG!  These were so good!  I will never crave fingersteaks from my favorite restaurant, and I LIVE IN IDAHO, again!  I did have to improvise but did basically as called for and they were amazing.  My 18 month old son tried one and kept coming back asking for more!  Thank you for taking the time to perfect and share this recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I follow it exactly especially the freezing time.  Makes the batter stay on and not get too dark while the meat cooks.  When I make them I double the batch and keep the extras in the freezer.  Then  throw in a couple of potatoes to bake and fry these up....so yummy and easy!
