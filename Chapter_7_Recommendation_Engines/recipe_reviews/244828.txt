I have to say I was fairly skeptical about this method, but, it turned out absolutely perfect!   The pasta was not overcooked at it had great flavor cooking it in milk instead of boiling it in water.  It wasn't overly cheesy and creamy like a traditional macaroni and cheese, but, was very flavorful.  We loved the pesto.  I actually think I might even mix in the tomatoes & pesto instead of layering on top next time.

Followed the directions and was delighted with the results. Will definitely make again! Don't let the lack of reviews stop you from trying this.

We loved this one.  I halved the recipe since there are only two of us and served it with breaded pork chops.  It was cheesy and creamy and definitely a different twist on mac and cheese.  Already looking forward to heating up the leftovers.  Next time I make it, I'm going to add some crumbled Italian sausage to it for a one-dish meal.  Thanks, Pam, for a really nice and easy recipe!

Made it for the first time when my sister-in-law, her husband and two little girls were in town. She and her husband loved it. Their little girls ate some too. I made a few changes - I did not use whole milk, just the skim milk we normally drink, I added bacon crumbles to the recipe and I did not use a 9 x 13 shallow dish. But instead I used a deep stone dish. I worked great! So yummy!

I LOVE how easy this was to throw together and that there was no noodle boiling required. However, I'm not as sold on the caprese part...  While I did enjoy this, I found some bites a bit acidic for me (and I like both tomatoes and pesto). I'm anxious to try this method, sans tomatoes/pesto. I subbed Gruyere for fontina (our grocery store no longer carries it) and also added some milk white cheddar that needed to be used. This is a really interesting Mac and cheese and is definitely worth giving a whirl. Thanks for the recipe, PAM!

I really liked the idea of this recipe, in that it could be a side dish, main vegetarian dish or a good Italian one-dish meal by adding a meat.  I chose to add Italian roasted and shredded chicken.  The only other changes I made were an additional can of diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano and olive oil. In addition to the cheese the recipes calls for I mixed in some Italian Blend cheese.  Very, very good except there were some hard pieces of pasta.  Otherwise, it was a hit with my husband and two teenage daughters.  Two days later we had leftovers and I transferred them to a newly Pam-sprayed casserole dish and poured some milk in the bottom of the dish before positioning our leftovers in it.  The result was perfect pasta.  So I would just add a little more milk to the recipe if you experience dry pasta.  Will absolutely make again and in many different ways!

I used fresh home made pasta instead of dried, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, cubed fresh bread instead of panco bread crumbs, and fresh basil instead of pesto, and I cut the milk to 2.5 cups because 4 just seemed like way too much liquid. I crisp-fried about a half pound of bacon along with about 1/3 cup chopped onions and added that to the milk mixture before pouring it over the pasta and cheese mixture. I mixed the chopped, fresh basil with the reserved cheese and sprinkled that on top of the then-crispy bread cubes just before taking the pan out of the oven. I always hate it when people rate a recipe they changed a lot, but the only drastic change I made, really, was the addition of bacon and onions. I’m pretty sure it would have been great anyway, but the baconated version was the bomb. It was a little runnier than traditional Mac n cheese, maybe because of the fresh tomatoes or maybe because the fresh pasta didn’t soak up as much liquid as dried would have. A little extra flour or even less milk might have helped.  Not really a problem though.... five people devoured the entire pan In one sitting and loved it!

I was excited to try this simplified version of Mac and Cheese.  I used Penne pasta instead of elbow (just our family preference) and what I got was a lot of "hard" pasta that was sticking out of the mixture above the sauce, not "cooked' and therefore not great to eat.  It seemed there wasn't enough liquid/sauce to adequately moisten the uncooked pasta.  Was this the result of substituting and equal amount but different SHAPE of pasta?  I don't know... I'll try again making sure to leave out some of the dried pasta if it seems insufficiently submerged to get a good result.
