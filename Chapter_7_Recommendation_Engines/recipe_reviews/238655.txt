I bought jicama for the first time, always thought it was a strange thing. But if you haven't tried it, this is a good recipe. The lemon tones down the jicama's sweetness. Nice balance of flavors. I did not have cherry so I used 4 roma tomatoes. I think it would be a nice side dish for anytime you want something light & fresh.

I added chopped sweet yellow pepper for a little color and flavor.  Loved this salad.  Keeps well in fridge for several days.

Wow. Fresh and zesty. Itâ€™s like a cross between an apple and potatoe.  This would be a great side for a steak or burgers.

It came out wonderful. I was looking for a light, fresh tasting cucumber salad and this was just that!
