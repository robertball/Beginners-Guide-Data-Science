This was delicious but the 6 servings thing? NO WAY!  Six sumo wrestlers, maybe..as a side dish, it made enough for many, many, MANY portions.  There was no mention of an oven setting, only the timing for baking - I tried 350F and that seemed to work OK.  Mixing everything in a big bowl worked better than trying to mix it in the baking dish, too.  Overall a good dish :)

Good mac-n-cheese and this is coming from someone who's favorite food is mac-n-cheese!  I used a different shaped pasta and Monterey Jack cheese in the dish and cheddar on top and it still tasted great.

I've made this twice, to take to family potlucks.  EVERYONE loves it! It's always the first thing cleared.  I make the recipe for 16 and serve approx. 35 people.

I halved this recipe and used a casserole dish instead of a 9x13 pan. I added about 2 cups of cooked chicken and about 1 cup of pre-cooked peas and carrots. It was great! I'll definitely be making it again, either as a casserole or straight up mac & cheese.

I had trouble with this one almost from the start.  After adjusting the servings down to 2, it still made WAY too much (the stuff lasted for 4 days straight).  It was extremely messy to prepare, as well (my 9x13 pan was overrunning with the cheese sauce).  My husband kind of liked it but says there's WAY too much cheddar cheese in it - I definitely agree.  If you add other kinds of cheese to this (i.e., mozzarella, Colby jack, etc.), it will taste MUCH better.  I don't believe that 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup is really necessary - maybe 1, even 1/2 a can if you want a "light" version of this.  Be warned - even reducing the servings will make almost too much for you to handle.  Unfortunately I think I'll be sticking to boxed stuff until I can find a better recipe for mac and cheese.  :-(

This was awful! Not creamy enough. Tasteless. I followed the recipe to a tee! It also stuck to the pan even though I buttered it.

Very good!  I did make adjustments though.  I made for serving of 4 (for a side dish, its more like 6).  Used 1/2 lb macaroni, one can of soup, 1 cup milk, 1 egg, 1/2 cup cheese stirred into the mix and 1/2 cup for on top (I thought was plenty), 1/4 tsp cajun spice (will use more next time and maybe change to cayenne or just add 1/4 tsp of that in addition) and 1 tbsp dry mustard.  This was so easy and creamy with the soup instead of a block with just shredded cheese.  Cutting down the cheese to one cup total helps with sodium and calories, and I used 1% milk and no additional salt (made my own cajun spice mix without salt)  Will make again with changes!

Great! After YEARS of making a traditional white sauce with cheese for mac and cheese, I am so happy to find a new recipe that my family, and more importantly ME (:) actually like and is easier. I halved the recipe, added some minced onion, and added a breadcrumb/butter mixture on top of the cheese. Also I cooked at 350 for 30 minutes like I do my traditional mac and cheese. Everything else was as instructed and it was excellent! Thanks for the new tradition.

I too halved this recipe and it still filled a 9x13 baking dish. This was pretty good. I will definitely try fixing this again adding different cheeses to it.

This was really creamy and rich. It tasted a lot like the Kraft Deluxe fancy mac and cheese. I cut this in half and didn't have any eggs. I didn't bake this, we ate it as it and it was great. (DH wanted it like it was but next time I'll try to bake it because I like the crunchy part on top.)

Brought to a potluck and it was the hit!  Used colby-jack cheese.  Followed recipe exactly, otherwise.  I didn't even use salt or pepper during or after cooking.  Pepper would add to it's deliciousness though.  I'll definitely be making this again so my family can enjoy.  For the topping, I sliced the cheese instead of using shredded.  I halved this recipe and filled a 9x13 pan perfectly.

BEWARE! This Mac and Cheese has a very *egg-y* taste. It calls for 4 eggs (we cut the recipe in half, therefore only using 2 eggs). The taste and texture reminds me more of an omlette, rather than a cheesy Mac and Cheese bake. Very fluffy and dry somehow.  I prefer more of a cheesy or saucy mac and cheese... I must say it smelled amazing while baking though ;)

This was really good. I did however, make a couple of changes. I didn't add as much egg as the recipe called for. I also added Muenster cheese so that I used 1/2 Muenster, 1/2 Cheddar. The cook time was a little off for me by 20 minutes or so, but I did downsize the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

When I think of Fall comfort food I think of good old homemade mac n cheese. I cut the recipe in half (only used 3/4 box of pasta) , added a teaspoon of ground mustard, used cheddar jack cheese blend, added  (3 links out of casing) of johnsonville sweet Italian sausage (browned & drained first of course), & topped with breadcrumbs.... Just when you thought it couldn't get any better lol!!!! it came out perfect & was delicious! Exactly what our family needed tonight.

I love this version of mac and cheese, this is requested for work functions whenever I need to bring a dish to pass. Only thing I change is that I add bread crumbs to the top for some added texture and don't use salt. I use the amounts as directed, but usually put it in one 9 x 13 pans to cook immediately and two smaller glass dishes that I freeze. I unthaw the frozen ones and cook as directed, still tastes great.

This was great.  I made it for friends who just had a baby and they loved it.  It was creamy and gooey.  I added some smoked gouda and topped with italian panko bread crumbs.  This will be my new go to mac and cheese.  And to those who think it makes to much just freeze the left overs.  Don't half the recipe it will dry out.

I halved the recipe and baked covered for 20 minutes, added a little bit of crushed ritz crackers that had been mixed with a little bit of butter, and continued to bake for additional 15 minutes, uncovered. Was extremely easy to make, and pretty darn good. Will most definately be making again

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and I thought this mac and cheese was just OK.  For some reason, my teenager boys did not like it as much as I thought they would.  It seemed a bit to "gloppy" and unhealthy.  Sorry, but it's just not one of my favorite mac and cheese recipes.

I made half the recipe, using Campbell's broccoli cheese soup, and combined sharp cheddar and mozzarella for the cheese along with a little parmesan. I used a small amount of prepared mustard as well. I added in (sauteed) 1/2 Echrich kielbasa and a finely chopped onion. Used all the cheese called for IN the casserole and grated additional cheese for the top. Baked in three 1 1/2 qt, buttered Correll casseroles. (Shared with daughter's family and a post-surgical neighbor). Rave reviews all around. This recipe, as shown, is an excellent STARTING POINT for your creativity. Next time I will use regular cheese soup, add salsa, ground beef, onion and green chilies!

My issue with this recipe is that the portions are off. You can't fit two pounds of cooked macaroni in a 9 by 13.

This is a really good, creamy mac and cheese! I did add a little garlic powder and pinch of cayenne pepper which added a little more flavor and a panko topping. I would definitely make this again, it's just not THE recipe yet.

I made this recipe for a labor day bbq with family and friends.  Everyone loved it! What was leftover was fought over as to who will take home the leftovers.  I cut the recipe in half and had more than enough for 12 people.  I'm making it again, this time adding peas and chunks of ham for a more complete one-dish meal.

This was my 1st ever homemade mac and cheese...AND I don't usually cook for anyone, other than my boyfriend and his 12 yr old daughter, I chose this recipe for a surprise, potluck, birthday party.  It was a HIT!  Everyone loved it.  I will definitely cook this again, and maybe even for a work-potluck, where I normally just bring a veggie tray.

This is a great version of semi-homemade mac.  The condensed cheddar soup makes it very quick and easy to get right.  It's not as rich as the other recipes that don't use the soup as a starter, but was still quite nice and much quicker for a week-night meal.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and made half the recipe for a full 9x13 pan.  It was perfect amount for the pan.  I topped mine with crushed cheese crackers for a crumb topping.  Added just the perfect crunch.

Makes a ton! But that's okay since my fiancé and I love it. I'll divide it into multiple dishes and take some over to both of our parents houses and there's still enough for us. It's also good reheated later.

This is delicious Mac'n' cheese. I followed the directions precisely.
While it was very tasty we found it to be a bit too dry. Next time I 
will add more cheese and more milk. I think I may keep it covered while 
baking and then stick it under the broiler for a few minuted to brown 
the top. I certainly will be using this recipe the next time I bake
Mac 'n' Cheese!

I halved the recipe and it barely fit in a 9x17pan!  It was very good though.  I wouldn’t change anything in the recipe.
Thanks for sharing.

Very dry, bland, and not as cheesy or creamy as I hoped for.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it wasn't very good. It was pretty dry and surprisingly not very cheesy. Next time I will mix all of the cheese in instead of putting half on top, and add some cream and butter to make it thicker, creamier and not so dry. This has potential if a few additions are made.

I like this easy Mac and cheese recipe but it lacked flavor for me. I used marble Jack cheese instead of cheddar and added bread crumbs on top. Great consistency but I would add spices next time and sharp cheddar or Colby.

I made this for my boyfriend and son but they ran out of condensed cheese soup at the store so I substituted it for poblano y queso condensed soup. (Green chili and cheese) my boyfriend loved it . His sons taste buds havnt developed yet so the chili mighta been too much for him but it was absolutely amazing. During the last 15 minutes when it calls for you to take the lid off I sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top.
