This is just like the recipe I have used for years.  Many variations can be done, one of which is tinting the dough with colors to match the the holiday or season.  this is a must try recipe!!!!!

These were a huge hit. Yes they are nutty and buttery. So if that doesn't suit you these are not for you! :) I also rolled them in confec. sugar about 2 - 3 minutes out of the oven. This made the sugar melt onto the cookie which made them sweeter. Very good.

Disappointed.   These cookies crumbled too easily.  I lost at least 60% before every being able to serve them.  Also, need to be careful with the size.  Make sure the balls are no bigger than a quarter or they taste too floury.

yummmmmy.  This recipe is so simple and so delicious.  My 4 year old made them with me and they came out perfect.  I halved the recipe since I thought that 90 seemed like a lot but I was wrong.  They are pop in your mouth good and were a huge hit for all ages.  Loved using only 4 ingredients.

I live overseas so I cannot get typical ingredients. I made a very modified version...Used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening and almonds that I ground very fine. Still YUMMY!

These are also traditional cookies in my family, too.  I had lost the recipe and couldn't find it--so glad to find it here.  Thanks so much!

These are pretty good but I think they taste a bit too "floury"

First I made according to recipe, only I used 1/2 cup poedered sugar, but I still thought they were rather unsweetened &floury tasting.  Second time I made them, I used the pound of softened butter and 1/2 cup of granulated sugar, I whipped butter and sugar until light and fluffy, added pecans and flour.  MUCH more tender and tasty

I love these cookies. If you can't eat nuts, you can get a simular flavor using maple flavoring instead of nuts.
