This is a great recipe for the adverterous
cook!  I would suggest that you cook the
dough briefly on one side, then turn and
add toppings.  The whole family loved it!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.....This was wonderful. We took the pizza dough, cooked it on both sides on low-medium on the grill, bring it inside, put on the toppings on broil it until the cheese bubbles. My husband and I will not ever eat any other pizza again we have decided!! It was SOOOOOO good!!!! The only difference that I did with the dough is adding 2 teaspoons of sugar...it gives it a slightly sweeter flavor, I suggest it highly!! If you want to try the best pizza in the world, MAKE THIS!!!

This fantastic!  I'm a yeast novice, so I read all of the reviews and asked for some help on the exchange.  BTW:  "proofing the yeast" means stirring it in the warm water, (I added 1/2 the sugar then, too) and letting it set until it's foamy (about 10 min).  I followed the recipe exactly (except adding 1/2 the sugar to the proofing yeast and 1/2 after).  I used my Kitchenaid w/the dough hook for the *hard* work.  I let it rise for about an hour, then placed it in the frig for awhile when I went out.  I took it out to come to room temp before using.  Mr. LTH grilled w/no issues, though I wasn't very clear in my instructions, so he grilled BOTH sides before I could top, so after topping I popped in the oven on broil to warm toppings/melt cheese.  This is so cheap & easy it will def be a staple at our house...so many topping combinations to try (Mr. LTH had "traditional" cheese pizza and I brushed mine w/EVOO/garlic and topped w/diced red bell pepper, sweet onion, tomatoes, feta cheese, Italian Cheese Blend, and crushed red pepper.).  If you haven't made this yet, MAKE IT!  THANK YOU for an excellent recipe!

My husband and I just loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly but increased the sugar to 1 1/2 tsp per other reviews and I'm glad I did.  I also followed the other reviews who suggested 5 minutes on one side, then remove from the grill and top the cooked side and put back on grill for 3-5 minutes.  Once grilled nicely on the bottom, I move up to the top rack of my grill and the cheese melts...yum!  We will definitely be using this recipe throughout the summer--much cooler cooking on the grill than heating up the kitchen!  Thank you for sharing!!

SOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!  Okay, to be fair yeast breads are my downfall.  It took me 2 tries to get my yeast to proof.  I used my kitchen aid mixer with dough hook attachment to mix.  Even with floured hands, dough was very sticky.  I divided into 2 separate dough balls to rise for 1 hour.  The dough was very delicate and still quite sticky so I added more flour and kneaded some before rolling out into about two 8" circles.  Used a charcoal grill/smoker and got heat up to 250 degrees.   Placed on grill *without* toppings first, because my dough was a bit thick.  Grilled one side, removed from heat and added toppings.  One pizza was basil pesto, fresh mozzarella, and fresh picked roma tomatoes (Pioneer Woman recipe).  Back on the grill another 5 minutes, then put under the broiler on low for 3 minutes.  Second pizza was tomato sauce, shredded mozzarella and pepperoni.  The second pizza we put toppings on *before grilling*.  However, because our crust was thicker in took longer to grill.  Had to place under the broiler for a few minutes also.  Make sure to *place your toppings* on your pizza dough *after* you place it on the pizza peel!   When I make these again I will grill one side first BEFORE adding the toppings.

RAINY DAY tips! Made the dough in the breadmaker, followed the recipe to a "T" otherwise.I let it rise/rest for 15 minutes before I prebaked the crust for about 8 minutes @400. Then added all the toppings and baked for 20 minutes. Easy and really good!

I made the dough in my bread machine and followed the suggestion of others to cook one side and  add toppings after turning the bread over.  I used olive oil, a commercial herb blend and freshly grated parmesan cheese and served this as an appetizer for our Memorial Day cookout.  It was delicious and actually very easy.   You just need to watch it carefully to avoid overcooking, because it only takes a short time to cook.

The pizza was wonderful, however, it was easier to burn than my husband and I had anticipated.  I think next time we will remove the dough from the grill while we add the toppings to keep it from getting too done.

EXCELLENT!!!  I was skeptical at first, but decided to try it anyway and am I glad I did.  I took another person's advvice and cooked it a few minutes and then flipped it and added my toppings. YUMMY!!!  Can't wait to grill again.  Next time I'm going to try making pizza this way.

Excellent recipe. I placed the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, covered with plastic wrap, and allowed it to rise 1-1/2 hours. Will make it again many times over the summer. Already planning my next toppings! Thanks for a new family favorite.

Delicious and easy as long as you have the time to let it rise! Will def. make again! If you were wondering, each pizza is about 12 in if rolled out very thin and 8 in if thick.

Awesome!  I used the bread machine to make the dough, which turned out well and let it sit in the refrigerator for a day.   After shaping the dough, my other half, lightly greased the grill and grilled one side for 5 minutes.  We flipped it over, put the toppings on and grilled for another 5.   Perfect!!!   We will definitely make again.

I thought this was pretty good. I would make it again. I didn't make it into pizza, just bread to go with meat and vegetables. It reminded me a lot of bread or pizza dough one would get out of a brick oven. Watch it, because it does cook fast. I cooked each piece, 3-5 minutes, flipping it one or two times. It puffs up nicely.

The cooking method of this recipe is what sets it apart from other pizza dough recipes.  The dough is just basic pizza dough, and very good by the way.  Don't know why I never tried baking pizza on the grill, it's GREAT!  We made 4 small pizzas.  We cooked one side and brought them in to assemble the toppings on the cooked side, then they went back on the grill to finish.  The texture of the crust was perfect, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  These do cook quick and therefore can burn very quick.  I stayed with them and using 2 spatulas rotated them around frequently to evenly cook the crusts.

This is so good! I add garlic powder and rosemary to the dough then brush with garlic butter and top with mozzarella. As others said, grill one side until cooked, then flip and add toppings.

Excellent!!  We just bought a Kamado Kooker and wanted to try pizza on it.  I followed the other suggestions and grilled for 2 minutes, brought inside and topped the grilled side, and then grilled for 5 minutes.  It turned out fantastic!

During recent family get together had  8 grandchildren helping each other make their own dough "from scratch" Each with dough eventually dumped into zip lock bag to rise.  What a happy messy time. Grille one side, then put toppings on the grilled side and then put back on grill. then to oven to make bubbly.  This is meant to be "an event" a "family activity" in itself.  VERY YUMMY VERY FUN!. It also makes up very easily and unmessy when fixing up for a meal for two adults with leftovers

We love to make pizzas on the grill when the weather is nice - this is a good workable recipe.  I always make sure to add the flour slowly to get a good consistency for kneading.

My family absolutely loves this! I too, cook one on side first, then flip over and add toppings. So far the favorite topping at my house has been to brush the dough with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, top with sliced tomatoes, add salt and pepper to taste, then sprinkle some fresh grated parmesan over the top.

Fabulous recipe!!!  I went by some review that said to grill the dough on one side for a few minutes, pull off, flip over, and then add toppings to cooked side.  Placed it back on the grill for about 5 minutes.  Perfect!!!

Love this grill dough.  Perfection!  Update, this dough is still fantasic and easy.  Out of our bread machine, comes out soft.  After flattening into pizza crust we oil one side and put on grill, oil side down for a few minutes, then flip. Add sauce and toppings.  Heat until cheese melts, somtimes we do in oven.  Crust is beautiful, crisp on outside, a little chewy on inside. You won't regret BBQ pizza, it's out kids favorite meal!  Thanks for sharing this one.

Made dough in my bread maker and it turned out great.  I suggest brushing crust with olive oil and placing fresh mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes on top. Thanks for a fun grilling idea!

I split the dough into 6 personal sized pizza crusts and the entire family made their own.  This crust was perfect!  It tasted so much better than any I can get locally.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This is absolutely the best recipe. It got great reviews from my skeptical husband - I followed the suggestions and grilled one side, flipped it, added toppings and grilled it. Excellent. Making it again tonight as an appetizer.

Really good. I used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 unbleached AP flour. Took me a few minutes to figure out how hot I needed the grill and all. I topped it with a fresh homemade pesto made with basil, spinach, toasted almonds, garlic, parmesan,  and olive oil as well as thinly sliced grilled chicken and mozzarella cheese. I will be making this one again!

WOW. I usually don't have time to review recipes, but considering I want to kiss the person who posted this' feet I figure it is the least I can do. This. is. AMAZING! I have had all types of pizza from all over and NOTHING compares to this when it is made right. I replaced the olive oil with melted butter, and increased the sugar to 2 tablespoons as another reviewer suggested. When it rose, I heated both sides on the grill until done and brought it in for the toppings. I added fresh chopped roma tomatoes, roasted garlic, purple onion, fresh sliced button mushrooms, feta and seven types of cheeses. It came out very 'gourmet' to say the least. I also broke it up into four personal pizzas. If my husband was not in love with me before, he is now! I was going to take a picture, but the pizza did not last long enough. Thank you for this!

This is a great recipe!  The only thing I did a little bit differently is that I generously dusted a board with flour and cornmeal before I rolled out the dough.  That way, it slides right off of the board onto the grill.  Wonderful recipe - thank you so much!

Very basic pizza dough recipe.  Yes, this is a tad easy but if you are starting out, it has the basics, and you can add toppings to your hearts content with this one bc it is a simple, relatively plain dough.  I didn't grill it because it's 37 degrees outside and was snowing earlier, but I baked and used for the Tomato and Artichoke Focaccia recipe on here.  Turned out lovely.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love grilled pizza!  And this is an easy recipe, and works well!

Topping idea......I diced zucchini and sauteed w/ garlic and onion and diced red pepper.  Then tossed w/ pesto.  Put on top of my grilled dough, and topped with dollops of goat cheese.   Yummy at this time of year with all the veggies available!!

Loved it.  Proof the dough by adding 1/4 cup hot water and a 
1/2 tsp sugar let set about 10 minute until foamy and about double in size then add to rest of dry ingredients.  I used a little extra flour and additonal 1/2 tsp sugar.  I used dough hook.  Used about 3/4 cup more hot water to make dough.  Let rise about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.   I divided into two just to make easier to flip on grill and make two different kinds of pizzas.  I also added about 2 Tbsp.  Fresh chopped Rosemary to dough when mixing.  Grilled about 5 min on one side on gas grill with grill cover open took off, added toppings put back on grill for another 5-7 min with grill cover closed.  One pizza we did red sauce w/ sundries tomato, left over steak, red onion, and cheese.  The other with same red sauce Canadian bacon, and pineapple.  Both were super!   Can easily double recipe and still fit on grill.  4 rectangle pizzas worked well.  Nice for party.

We use this recipe for WAY more than grilling! Makes yummy dough for regular pizza in the oven and can be easily used for garlic knots, too! This one's a keeper.

I was afraid to make this, to be honest!  I've never made dough from scratch, much less grilled it.  But this is a definite make-again!  I cooked it over indirect heat on the gas grill 10 or so minutes on a cookie sheet and then flipped it, added the Exquisite Pizza Sauce (from this site), fresh spinach, basil, mushrooms and pepperoni plus swiss (1/4) and mozzarella (3/4) cheese.  I turned up the heat and cooked it 5ish minutes - just untill the pepperoni crisped up a tiny bit around the edges.  I served it with Roasted Beet, Peach and Goat Cheese Salad (from this site) ... dinner was awesome, I wouldn't change a thing!  YUM!

This is the best dough for grilling pizza!  Perfect taste and texture - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I upped the sugar to 1 1/2 t. and it was just right for me.  This was my base for Tomato Basil Squares, another great AR recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We made two batches of this and used one for personal sized pizzas and the other for breadsticks.  I made a simple, traditional pizza sauce and let everyone add their own favorite toppings. Kids and adults loved it!!  A really fun twist on a backyard bbq!  One note - the second time we made these I used Rapid Rise yeast.  It did not taste as good as when I used regular active dry yeast.

Lol, When I read BEANY's review that this is for the 'adventurous cook,' i took it as a challenge! Love the recipe - and thanks to all for the topping suggestions. I'm gonna have a lot of fun with this one.

I couldn't belive how easy and good this recipe was. I made this at least 5 times this summer for family and friends. I also added some dried herbs (oregano and basil, garlic powder) to the dough a few times. Very tasty! Definately take it off the grill to add toppings to the grilled side. The cornmeal will help it slide right back on the grill with out disturbing the cheese etc. My favorites are bbq chicken with smoked mozz. and artichoke and sundried tomatoes. Yum!!!

Love this stuff!  Great with slices of tomato, basil and a little olive oil.  Or make smaller rounds and let every one make their own.

Wonderful dough!  It's pretty much a standard dough... The key to grilling is to have the grill not too hot.  If you're using charcoal grill (which is what my family uses), spread the coal around on the bottom instead of bunched up in the middle.  YES - take it off the grill when you are topping, unless you are super fast at putting your toppings.  If you have two people doing the toppings, then you're ok - otherwise, take it off the grill and then put it back on.  The dough needs to be a bit thicker so it won't fall apart when you put it on the grill.  For oven, bake crust (poke holes in crust) at 400F in pizza pan or pizza stone for 8 minutes.  Put toppings on and then bake again for another 20 minutes.  OR - you can wait for the crust to cool, then put your toppings on, wrap it up with saran wrap and put it in the freezer for home made frozen pizza!  When baking frozen pizza, bake at preheated oven of 400F for 25 minutes. :)  

I did let the yeast poof in the warm water and sugar for 15 minutes before adding all the other ingredients. For my taste buds, I also added 1 TBSP minced garlic and 1 TBSP Italian herb and 1 TBSP of basil and mixed it in with the dough.  I let it rise for 1 hours (at least) before making the pizzas.  It gives a wonderful aroma when baking.  My kitchen smells like a pizzaria after making 4 frozen pizzas tonight. ;)  Love the smell -- wish I can bottle it up and sell it to Yankee Candle or something.

I thoroughly enjoyed this pizza...I took others' recommendations of cooking it for five minutes on the grill, removing it and flipping it to put on the toppings and putting it back on the grill.  So good!

Okay, in the interest of health, we use whole grain whenever possible. Was a little crispy and dry after cooking. I did pre-grill one side as per others. Used pesto toppings. Took a little longer than mentioned and I slid the first pizza onto the other unlit side to complete cooking. Next time I will do 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flours. I think I also would add some seasonings to it as others have mentioned.

This is an easy recipe...and oh so good!  Be careful when you roll out the dough not to get it too thin!  I also followed suggestions of others and precooked dough for 3-5 minutes, removed from the grill, flipped the dough, placed the toppings and returned to the grill for another 3-5 minutes.  Concerned the bottom of the crust was getting burned, I removed the pizzas and put them under the broiler for 2 minutes...that's it!  My family has decided this is the best pizza ever!!!

I have never dared cook pizza on the grill before but I did it last night and it was so easy and tasted amazing.  The base is crispier than oven pizza but much more authentic, just like from a wood oven.  Thank you for sharing, we will make all of our pizza this way in future.

I seem to have issues with dough rising properly (I'm starting to wonder what factors play against yeast-raised doughs) so I only got a one frozen pizza sized pizza and one tiny one. No matter, I went with it. I subbed half the flour for whole wheat. I topped mine with a "Pesto Del Sol" (from AR) and a blend of Romano, Parmesan & marble Cheddar mixed with 1 TBsp. of homemade Italian seasoning. Tasty, and will try this recipe again to make it work for me.

I have tried EVERY way to make pizza. This is by far the best and is GREAT!!!!! I grilled the crust first, then took inside and topped. I put it back on the grill to cook 5 more minutes to melt the cheese. It is crispy, and chewy on the inside. WONDERFUL!!

This recipe is a keeper – easy and tasty.  Per other reviewers’ suggestions, I grilled it on medium-low for two minutes on one side, flipped it, put the toppings on and finished grilling four to five minutes on the other side.  A delicious hearty crust with that smoked flavor.

Ok, I'll be honest. I flubbed the recipe somehow and bought pre-made dough from the store. I let it sit out for a couple hours, rise, get pliable. I rolled it out and threw it on the 'greased' gas grill, waited til it browned on one side, put the toppings on the browned side and put it back on the grill to grill the underneath. It ROCKED!!! It was 35 degrees outside and it was still worth it to cook on the grill as opposed to the oven. Fun and great tasting! Don't put the heat up too high on the grill though.... burn city. And check it often after you flip and put toppings on! :-)

After struggling the first few times to stretch the dough evenly I found a you tube video where a guy put olive oil on a cookie sheet and stretched the dough on that. It helps if you oil your fingers too.  Now my pizza dough is perfectly round and thin! This made the best pizza I've ever had in my life!  We've made it almost every weekend since discovering that we can grill pizza!

This dough was easy to put together and easy to work with.  I doubled the recipe, made 10 individual pizzas and let the kids top their own.  We grilled one side, flipped the dough, topped them and put them back on the grill.  Easy and delicious.  And I loved that I didn't have to turn the oven on for dinner!

I don't often review recipes. I loved this one. I made the dough exactly as the recipe states. I made 1 big pizza. I sprinkled the back of a cookie sheet with corn meal, put the pizza on that and slid it right onto the grill. I also cooked it for 5 minutes on 1 side and flipped it and added toppings. Delicious. Very easy dough to work with. I also think the grilling gave it a slightly smokey flavor like a real brick oven pizza. I want to add, I made it on a charcoal grill using indirect heat.

Great recipe!  I made this with 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 AP, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Thunderstorms rolled in shortly before we were ready to grill so I ended up making the pizza in at 400 degree oven.  I par-baked the crust by itself for a short time then topped it and put it back in the oven until the cheese melted.  Delish!  I can't wait to actually try grilling it.  I think it will be the perfect texture to grill!

I wanted to grill but wanted to do something different. I don't bake and the last bread I made was 20 years ago! This was easy and enjoyed by all! I followed the other's suggestion and grilled one side first before topping. I will definitely make this again. I served grilled pineapple and orange slices for a refreshing side.

Absolutely the best pizza dough. We make little individual pizza the kids can load as they please, and that are also easier to manipulate on the grill. It's always a big success!

This works great on the grill.  We cook it on the first side for a few minutes and then flip it, add toppings and then grill again.  I also made the dough in my bread machine - super easy.

I cannot bake (anything) and this is the first dough I've ever made (successfully).  I did have to add more water than the recipe called for.  With only the recommended amount of water it was a bit dry and pizza dough should be slightly moist and easy to ball.  I only let it rise for about an hour (covered it with a wet kitchen towel while rising).  I grilled it on the recommended heat for 3-4 minutes on each side.  It's important to grill one side, remove it from the grill and add toppings to the already grilled side and then put it back on to finish grilling.   Very easy and quite good!

Fantastic!  Best and easiest pizza dough I've ever made!!  I also grilled one side then added topping and grilled other side.  I also added a tad more sugar to the dough and a little to the yeast to help it along.  Again, awesome flavor, thanks so much for posting it!

I've made this several times and follow the grill, flip, then add toppings suggestions.   The last time we made this, we also made dessert bread.  After flipping, spread approximately a tablespoon of chilled prepared vanilla frosting on top, then top with apple pie filling.  Sprinkle with cinnamon and/or nutmeg.  Finish grilling.  The frosting may drip off the sides.

Finally!! I have been making pizza on the grill for a few years now, but havent found a dough recipe I like--until now. This is great! Crisp and thin and yummy. We like woodfired pizza from a local restaurant and this recipe makes a very similar crust. I used my KitchenAid mixer and let the dough hook knead the heck out of it it for about 5 minutes and then let it rise for about 2 hours. The best way to cook pizza on the grill is to cook one side, flip it and then quickly assemble the pizza and then continue cooking. Depending on how many topping, etc. I will throw it under a broiler for just a bit to carmelize the top. Perfect!

Best pizza dough I ever had - family gave it raves, too!  I made small individual sizes for my grandkids and let them top their own.  We then placed them back on the grill for a few minutes just to heat up and melt the cheese.  This was a REAL WINNER!!

Looking forward to trying this recipe. Its a great idea to mix up the plain old bbq food. -- Hot or cold toppings are great. I used to order it all the time when I lived in Ma.

Finally, I can make bread!  For pizza, grilling for a few minutes each side before adding toppings helps the dough cook through without burning.  Excellent! Good texture, too.  I'm going to try a sweeter version for a breakfast bread next time.

We loved this recipe!  It's very fast and uses stuff I already had on hand.  We took other reviewers suggestions and grilled one side before putting on the toppings.  Since we cook on charcoal we will have to tweak exactly how hot to make the fire.

Pretty tasty dough- I mixed it in my stand mixer and noticed I needed to add another 1/2-3/4 c. of flour for it to come together. End result was yummy! *A tip I just picked up when letting any yeast dough rise, is turn your oven on to 150 and then turn off  while kneading and let the dough rise in your oven. Up north I had no problem with it rising at room temp. But, now in Florida I can't get anything to rise at all unless I do that!

I got a very heavy dough from this and had trouble grilling it to be done. Ended up with burned dough. :(  Maybe it was the recipe, maybe it was the grilling. Not sure if I'll try this one again.

Wow!  This is an easy recipe for something so delicious!!  We just finished eating our grilled pizzas and I wish I had more room in my stomach.  I did as many have recommended and grilled one side first for 5 minutes and then put the toppings on the cooked side.  I then grilled the pizza for 5 more minutes with the toppings.  We also broiled it for a couple of minutes to get the cheese totally melted.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made a double batch of this recipe last night for my family who had come to vist.  My nieces stretched out their own small pizza doughs and got to choose which toppings to put on the pizza.  We grilled the dough on both sides for a few minutes and then took it off the grill, added the toppings and put back on the grill until the cheese was almost melted.  Then we place the pizzas on a cookie sheet and put them in the oven on broil for a few minutes to make the top crust and cheese nice and golden brown.  It was the perfect pizza!! Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Grilled pizza is now one of my favorite foods :) I added more sugar, as suggested by other reviews, as well as cooking the dough on one side before adding toppings.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very well! I will definitely make this again.  I used pesto, fresh tomatoes, bacon, provolone and mozzarella cheeses, and fresh garlic for mine.

Unbelievably delicious!  My entire family raved over this, and we will definitely be making this regularly.  It was so easy to make; used the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook.  My husband did the grilling and my son and I put toppings on, a true family meal!  I took others' suggestions and grilled one side, added toppings to it, and returned it to the grill to finish the other side.  Brushed on garlic olive oil before putting on toppings.  We just did the basics, pepperoni and margherita.  Can't wait to experiment with other toppings!  Thanks for an awesome recipe, Kristen!

Yum, yum, yum! I followed the recipe exactly except I thought an hour and half too much rise time...I let rise 30 min. and it was perfect! Topped with taco cheese, the only topping I had, but I can't wait to try this again with other toppings. A keeper for sure!

Great recipe and great tips in the reviews.  Pre baking one side worked great, no soggy middle.  I used bread machine on dough setting which made it easy.  I skipped the cornmeal.  I used a traeger grill, and pre baked one side @ 275.  Kicked up to high before I put it back on.  Finished with putting it under the broiler for a few minutes to brown and boil the cheese.  Next time I will brush the outer crust with olive oil for a good finish.

This is the best pizza crust that I've made to date.  It made two medium sized pizzas, one that we grilled and one we baked.  Baked one turned out better but that might be due to our grill.

We are snowed in. I desperately wanted pizza. . . I decided to try this recipe! I am giving it five stars because we had no yeast and no grill  I substituted baking soda with lemon juice for the yeast, and used my pampered chef grill pizza pan in the oven and it turned out pretty good! Not bad at all for using what we had on hand! I will definitely make this again. . . With yeast, and a grill . . .

I have made this recipe about five times now. It's fantastic! We normally grill the pizza dough on the stove with our grill pan. We finish up the pizza under the broiler to cook the toppings and melt the cheese. My picky husband loves this pizza dough. I use Meijer brand pizza sauce and it's delicious. It's easy to make, give it a try. Oh one more thing I do, I dissolve the sugar with the yeast and warm water.

I have used this several times for the grill. I use the yeast specifically for pizza crusts with it. Turns out a nice crispy crust.

I didn't change anything, but I did grill one side and then I flipped the crust and added my toppings to the already grilled side. This allowed the cheese to melt while the other side was browning. I also put my pizza under the broiler to brown the top just before serving. The whole family loves it! We will definitely make it again.

I use Wheat flour for half of the flour and it comes out perfect.  This is the dough I use every time I make pizza's whether on the grill or in the oven!

I didn't make this on the grill, I put in the oven set to 450 degrees for about 18 minutes. It's the perfect dough recipe. Very easy. When I make it next time I'll put it on the grill on my pizza stone. I just didn't feel like issuing the grill today and being assaulted by the pollen.

Good and directions were sufficient but not as good as other pizza dough recipes. Any dough recipe will work on the grill. Probably will not make again.

Finally, a perfect pizza dough! This has a little less moisture than most other recipes, which I found made for the perfect combination of crunchy exterior and soft, chewy interior. Much more like a Pizzeria Bianco crust than anything else I've tried to replicate. I proofed the yeast with the sugar, rather than adding the sugar to the flour mixture, but aside from that minor adjustment this recipe turned out great.

I've never tried grilling pizza before, so perhaps it just takes experience, but that was a bit ridiculous.  I added extra flour to this recipe but I think it was still a little too sticky.  Also, I had no idea how thin to roll out the dough since the recipe didn't say, and I think I made it too thin.  Getting it onto the grill was an absolute pain, and let's just say I ended up with many small pizzas when I started with only one.  For anyone else inexperienced in grilling pizza, I would strongly suggest making small, personal-sized pizzas, because they would be much easier to manipulate on the grill.  Other than that it tasted ok in the end I suppose, but it wasn't quite worth all the trouble.

I am intimidated by anything that has yeast in the recipe... but I was amazed as to how easy this pizza dough was!  We put a baking stone on our Weber grill with lower coals.  This way - when we put the cover on - the cheese would melt without burning the crust.  We like the crust thin and crispy - delicious!

I precooked the dough on one side then we put toppings on that side (so the uncooked side was on the grill).  Everyone got to make their own pizza, great!

Outstanding recipe, the pizza was eaten up in a flash. I actually doubled the recipe and grilled all 4 dough/crusts on one day. We ended up adding the toppings to 2 crusts and then saving the extra 2 crusts for the next day.  Again, all we had to do was add the toppings the second day, it refrigerated nicely.  We also doubled the sugar for flavor. My husban is still raving about this!
