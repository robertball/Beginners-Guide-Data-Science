If executed as suggested there would not be enough broth for the amount of time the dish takes.  I used an entire box (32oz) of chicken broth through the duration of this recipe.  This dish is a little bland for us so the second time around I added chopped green onion. Carrot slivers and splashes of low-sodium soy sauce throughout the cooking helped a lot too. It's a great springboard for what your family prefers.

This is a great recipe.  I followed the previous reviewer and also used brown rice and made it separate.  I also put my canned chicken in the fry pan first and fried it (without oil) for a while before I added all the veggies and stir fried, adding the broccoli last so it could steam.  Then I mixed it all up and made "rice bowls".  My family was worried (especially hubby as he's major meat and potatoes guy) but he loved it.  Very easy, quick and good on a hot summer day.

This is a good basic recipe.  I did doctor it up a bit.  I used brown rice and 2 cups of broth in a rice cooker.  While that was cooking I saut√©ed the veggies and canned chicken (instead of turkey).   I added an entire yellow pepper and half an onion to the mix of veggies.

I used brown rice and cooked it separate.  I forgot to use the chicken broth so I put 2 chicken boulion cubes into the rice while it was cooking.  The can of turkey I bought was too small, I should have bought 2 cans.  I cooked and cut up a turkey burger to compensate. I put all the vegies into the rice when it had 5 mins left to cook and cooked it all together for 10 mins.  It was perfect.

I made this tonight, after searching for a dish with rice, turkey & mushrooms. I changed the method a little, cooking the rice (Thai) separately in the broth. I used fresh mushrooms (about 1 pound or 500 grams), and started them cooking first. Then I added the turkey, one chopped roasted red pepper, and finally the broccoli. After stirring it for a bit, I covered the pan and let the broccoli steam. To my taste, it needs seasoning. I added Jamie Oliver's spicy Szechuan blend, which added a little zip, but even plain salt and pepper would be a help. I will make this again, as I liked the combination, but may spice it up during cooking next time.
