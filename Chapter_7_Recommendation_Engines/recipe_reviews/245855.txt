I had to pick out some of the bacon way too much for me next time i will only use two slices i did not change anything this was absolutely the best kale dish i've ever had i had a plate for lunch with toasted chiabbatta bread i will be having this at least once a week along with brown rice (bought organic ca brown rice at farmers mkt i quit eating rice because of the arsenic found in rice )and i love rice but the rice i bought doesn't use cchicen manure where most of the. Inorganic arsenic comes from; you can't buy it in stores only from farmers market.

Very flavorful and the kale was very tender. I used regular bacon. This dish doesn't take long when you're using a pressure cooker. I will make this again.

My kids devoured these greens!  At first, they thought it was collards (which they were not too excited about). These are a new side dish in our home.  Thank you for the recipe!

Original dish was way too salty. Second time used reduced sodium ingredients, and much less boullion. Works well as a side dish, and can be made in a pot on the stove top.

Didnt use broth or bacon since my wife is Vegetarian but the rest of the ingredients I used and it turned out very delicious.

This is my go-to for any kind of greens and I LOVE it! I use 4 slices or real (not turkey) bacon, low-sodium broth, and only one bouillon cube, and it's perfect.
