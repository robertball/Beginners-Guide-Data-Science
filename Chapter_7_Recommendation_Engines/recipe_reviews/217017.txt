Did not care for it. Would have been better with just the honey or sugar.

I did make some adjustment such as adding extra honey instead of using the artificial sweetener, and adding orange zest to enhance the citrus flavor.  I didnâ€™t use dried milk powder so the spread was loose but perfect for using on the whole grain English muffins I made it for.   It made for a wonderful breakfast.
