I spent so much money buying the ingredients for this guacamole to learn a valuable lesson that the simper the guacamole the better...the onion was way too overpowering and the peppers unneccessary.

Excellent recipe - I added garlic too and it just adds that extra kick to it.  Make sure peppers are chopped very finely and try using red onion...again adding a little kick to it.  Found it tasted even better the second day as the flavours infused each other into a spectacular guacamole medley.

Absolutely delicious! I made this for my lunch yesterday. I didn't have any lime juice in the house so I used lemon. I also added garlic powder and left out the cilantro as I don't care for it. Very refreshing David!

Nothing special by any means.  Cilantro was overpowering yet very bland overall.  Will not be making again.

Great Guacamole, David! This was one of the items I served at recent Mexican themed luncheon on my patio. I had a work party over, and they devoured this guacamole. All I heard was Mmmmmmm, Yummmm. Guess that means they really enjoyed this. Thanks!

We liked this recipe, but thought it needed garlic salt and another avocado cut into chunks.

I also added the  kernels of 1 oven roasted ear of corn to this which really enhanced the texture of it.

glad to see one that is not made with sour cream or mayo--like simple and close to the real stuff. having spent most my time in California, Arizona, Mexico, and South America-- I perfer only a total off one bell peper, three jalapenos (seeded), a ground up red chili, and a shot of taquila and triple sec.
