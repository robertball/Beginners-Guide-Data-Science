I avoid making pie crusts like the plague.  Every recipe I've tried comes out sticky and messy - but this one was absolutely perfect!

I cut this recipe down and made two large crusts (more like 2 and a half) for a strawberry pie am just kicking myself for not making my own crust sooner.  Very easy, very tasty - this truely is a perfect pie crust!!

One trick I learned when it comes to pie crusts... before you start, put one or two pieces of plastic wrap on the counter top so that the plastic is a bit larger than the finished pie.  Then roll the pie out as normal - but instead of having to worry about it sticking to the counter, you can just pick it up by the plastic wrap and turn it over into your pie pan.  Works like a charm!

this is by far the best pie crust i have made. i tweaked it just a bit by using 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup shortening. you want to make sure that the butter is softened and your shortening cold. this gives it just a little bit more of a rich flavor. the key to the perfect consistency is using ICE COLD water. i don't mix the water with the egg yolk until right before adding to the flour mixture. i put about 4 ice cubes and water into a little shaker, then strain into the measuring cup with egg yolk to fill the cup. mix and test consistency. i had to use just a bit more water to get it right. for best results you could flatten dough into into discs, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate about 1/2 hour. this makes the crust perfect and very easy to work with. from this recipe i had enough for 2 pumpkin pies and one cherry (double crusted) pie. excellent!!

I am so pleased to have found this recipe. I like pie crust, but I don't like most pie crust if that makes sense. I have been looking for years for a recipe that tastes good and I have finally found it. As a bonus, this crust is so easy to work with, I was able to pick it up and turn it as I rolled it in order to make a more perfect circle. I had no problems with tearing or stretching. This is the softest nicest crust I have ever worked with. This is also the first crust I was able to be patient enough with that I could make decorative edges on my pie. I also used the crust to make a lattice top on each of my pies and I had no issues with cracking when I bent the pieces to weave them, or with sticking when I picked them up off the table. In short, this is how pie crust should be. You may find that you need to add more water, a spoonful at a time until the dough holds together. I also substituted powdered sugar for the white sugar the second time I made the crust and I will keep doing this in the future. Finally, I also substituted butter for 2/3 of the shortening and still had a beautiful flaky crust. 
Also, this recipe makes more than enough dough for 2, 2 crust pies. I imagine it would be sufficient for 1 more 1 crust pie. We used our two cookie sheets worth of scraps as cookies with cinnamon sugar. yum. 
Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

I changed the recipe to serve 12. I did not use 1/2 the water called for with the egg yolk and the dough was very sticky. I remade it again using the right amount of water and it came out great.  Don't forget to adjust the amount of water when adjusting the recipe..Jo

Although this crust has a pleasant taste,it tastes more like a cookie to me. It was also very difficult to work with. It did not roll out easily for a 9 inch pie, but it did roll nicely in small amounts for cutting out the decorative shapes for the edges of the pie. After I added more shortening and water, and mixed it for 30 minutes, it became easier to work with. I have been looking for an easy flaky pie crust. This isn't it.

Wonderful! I cut the recipe in half and used it for Blueberry Banana Cream Cheese Pie from this site and everyone raved about it! The only changes I made was using whole wheat pastry flour, which made it healthier too. Thanks for the post!

I have been baking pies for years and trying to recreate my mother's prize winning pie crust without the results I was trying to achieve!  This pie crust is very different from my mom's recipe and includes ingredients that she didn't use!!  All I can say is "move over, Mom". This pie crust is awesome and the easiest to roll and fit to a pie plate or even a cookie sheet. It makes such a generous amount too which is great making multiple pies at a time;  I did use 1/2 cup butter as was suggested by another someone else and made it in my food processor, the easiest crust I've ever made, thank you so much, I'll make this again and again!!!

Scary as it was, I was forced to make a pie crust this year, as none of the pre-made ones were available here. I've had terrible results before, but this one was tasty! It was OK to make, but I had to keep adding liquid as it was quite dry and wouldn't stick together. The suggested part apple juice/part water was a great idea. WHEW! Finally a crust I now won't "sweat" about making!

Look no further than this recipe- just perfect. I have spent years avoiding home made pie crust and after a disasterous run in with a store bought crust, I decided to go for it. Parred down the recipe to (2) pie crusts and followed the recipe to a T. It was perfect with my peach/blackberry pie and I received many compliments!

Stopped using shortening years ago, so used 1 cup salted, 1/2 cup unsalted butter and WOW!  First time I ever loved leftover pie crust. I ate it all and went for more!  Also, carefully floured and rerolled excess to make two more pies - one 8inch. one 9inch. A big hit at thanksgiving dinner and thereafter. Perfect Pie crust.

I have made this several times now and it comes out perfect every time.  I make the whole recipe then freeze what I don't use and it is still easy to rolls out  and bakes up beautiful and flaky.  This is the only pie crust I now make.

Not perfect.  A little tough and cookie like.  I made pies for Thanksgiving and  saw people sawing with their forks to get through the crust to the plate.  No one complained but they definitely had a struggle that should not come from eating a piece of pie!  This recipe makes alot of dough.  I rolled two crusts and still had enough to make three large discs to freeze.  I will use those up but not make this recipe again.

Nice crust and easy to work. I use a cup of shortening and 1/2 cup butter for the flaky and richness I prefer. I used this for an apple pie I made with my daughter. We also sprinkled Cinnamon on top. Cinnamon makes everything better.

This recipe was ok but not very flaky. Easy to roll out but the texture was a little tough. I think I will stick the Best ever pie crust recipe.

YUM! I have made this about 4 times now. Each time I messed with the shortening/butter ratio. I have come to find reducing the amount of shortening to 3/4c and adding 3/4c salted butter makes for a wonderful flaky crust perfect for almost any pie. It was simply wonderful for a chicken pot pie I made too! Thank You so much for sharing this!

This is a really easy recipe that is slightly sweet and perfect for desserts! I found it to be the best crust I've ever made! I found that it needed more water than the recipe called for. It turned out that I needed about 1 1/4 cups of water instead of just one. You can also add half shortening and half butter. It affects the consistency. (Butter makes it flakier.) When you make this, make sure that the shortening is COLD and the water is ICE COLD. This REALLY helps!! I hope you enjoy this recipe! I know I will!

I don't even like pie crust beyond its uses as a vehicle for tasty fillings, but this one is absolutely delicious. I actually liked it more than the rest of the pie!

The recipe worked well. If you find yourself short on time, (you probably aren't wasting more time reading the reviews), throw it in the freezer for about 10 minutes and then add about 1/2 a cup of flour to the dough. The flour firms the dough without altering the flavor.

After one flop with a different recipe, I went to my best source, Allrecipes.com.  Found this and tried it...was making an apple pie for an "apple pie connoisseur" for his birthday.  Received rave reviews from all, including me!  It is was it says...easy and delish!!  It will be my crust from now on.  Thanks!

If you want a great pie cruset, look no further! I have made several recipes, including one that calls for vodka (!), but this one is the best by far. I used  1/2 C butter, 1/2 C butter-flavored Crisco, and 1/2 lard, and I cut the sugar to 2 T because I made it for a quiche, and it's still a little sweet, but I like it that way. Still, it's best for a dessert, rather than something savory. It's flaky and tender. It requires a little more tenderness when working with it, but it's worth it! Seriously good!

A good basic pie crust recipe. I have no idea why you'd need three crusts though, so when you adjust the recipe to 2, make sure to adjust to 2/3 cup of water as well. Also be sure to switch for lard for a tastier and healthier crust (as healthy as pie crust gets, anyway ;))

I really liked this pie crust and I don't usually like pie crust!  It did have a hint of a cookie flavor but I think it is one of the things I liked about it.  It was also very easy to make.

This is an awesome pie crust! The only change I made was I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon for extra flavor and it turned out great. I made a 2 crust apple pie and I had enough dough left over to make 6 apple turnovers. I found if you chill the dough before rolling it out it works alot better. I always receive alot of compliments when I use this recipe!! I give this 5 stars!

Yaaaaaaay I can make pastry!  I haven't tried for years because it always came out like plywood!  This was so easy.  I just put it all in the food processor and was really careful not to overmix it.  It was a bit crumbly to roll but I followed the advice of another reviewer to roll it on clingfilm and it worked like a dream getting it straight into my pie dishes.  I'll be making all my own pie crusts in future!

This recipe has a sweet, almost a cookie flavor that lends itself well to fillings that may not be too sweet.  As with other crust recipes that use sugar it may be a bit sticky so be sure to keep it refrigerated until you're ready to use.  Will definitely make again.

I made it for pot pie and the crust was crispy on both top and bottom.  The only thing I did different was substituted 1/2 cup butter for 1/2 cup of the shortening.  It was delicious.  I also saved the egg whites and brushed on top of the crust.

I followed this recipe exactly and found the crust to be great in both sweet and savory dishes.  I used another users suggestion of placing Cling Wrap on my work surface to assist with crust transfers.  Thanks for the great recipe.

LOVED this recipe!  I dumped all the dry ingredients together in my food processor and then added the shortening and then added the egg & water.  It tastes great and my family loved it!  We used this for our beef pasties and it was a keeper!

This recipe turned out great! I had to add quite a bit of extra water, but that was fine. It rolled out perfectly and held up well. The size of the recipe allowed me to make two thick crusts (top and bottom) with an extra bit to save for another day. I topped the crust with sugar, and everyone loved it! Thanks!

This crust was easy to make, to create a lattice with and to cut once it was baked. I used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar and it worked well. The taste was slightly sweet, with a thick, almost flaky or fluffy texture. Delicious.

For some reason I followed all the steps and the crust was a little to dry so it would slit when I rolled it out.  I am not too good at making pie crusts so maybe its just me :)  Next time I will follow my instict because I kind of found it a little dry...but it was good and turned out not so bad.

I've tried several pie crust recipes with mixed results.  This pie crust recipe was very consistent, easy to roll and work with.  I chilled the shortening (based on other recipes).  I'm not sure if chilling helped or not.  The recipe works well for me as I often bake a single crust pumpkin pie with a fruit pie.

Great recipe, actually my first attempt at making pie crust and it turned out really well but I had to look elsewhere to find out how to actually cook this pie crust which was annoying. I didn't do any adjustments, I made it exactly as it and was happy with the results for lemon merangue pie.

I am a pure rookie when it comes to baking.  Nothing like free, delicious fruit to get inspired to make something from scratch.  I followed this recipe as written, and considered the suggestions and comments.  This was the first time I ever baked ANYTHING from scratch and the crust of my peach pie turned out PERFECT!! Thanks everyone that contributed to this recipe (by comments and modifications)!!!

I've been making pie crust since I was a kid and was never fully satisfied with any recipe...until now!  I used butter instead of shortening because in my opinion the crust always tastes better that way.  The last time I made this, I used half whole-wheat pastry flour and half unbleached white flour, but it was a little too wheaty, so next time I would probably just use one cup whole-wheat.  It was perfect when I made it with all unbleached flour.  This is the easiest dough to work with and turns out delicate and delicious!

This review is coming from someone who couldn't even manage a boxed cake herself, and now is making her own homemade pie crust!!  I followed the instructions word for word and the crusts came out wonderful!  They actually tasted like my grandma's which brought a tear to my eye because I had to resort to allrecipes.com because I never got her recipe for pie crusts.  They came out nice and moist, not flaky and falling apart!  EXCELLENT!!

Ok.. so I HATE making crust or any doughy type thing.. until now.. This recipe is fabolous, it doesnt stick and it holds together perfectly. Thanks! Now I can stop buying pie crusts and make my own.

Perfect?  Well, I don't know . . .but a decent, very easy crust.  I scaled this down to 6 servings as I only needed crust for a savory tart.  I also eliminated the sugar bc I was making something savory.  Never noticed the difference . . .I think I prefer pie crust without sugar, anyway.  I ended up with a little bit of crust leftover, so I improvised with strawberries and leftover syrup and made a couple of tarts in ramekins.  This crust bakes up nice and flaky.  Thanks for the recipe!

Well, the name serves this recipe well. I have found that it IS indeed the "perfect" pie crust. I have now utelized this recipe 4 or 5 times, and I use this in conjunction with the "home-made chicken pot pie" recipe on this site. This recipes works GREAT for chicken pot pie. I will never use another pie crust recipe.
