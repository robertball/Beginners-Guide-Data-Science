WOW!! An awesome chili. While it’s unconventional, this chili is among the best ever tasted. A few personal tweaks: (i) 1 lb. ground turkey rather than 1/2 lb.; (ii) 1 1/4 cups low sodium beef broth rather than like amount of water; (iii) 18.7 oz. Campbell’s Harvest Tomato w/ Basil rather than 2 cans (21.5 oz.) of regular tomato soup; (iv) Hot Mango Chutney rather than regular mango chutney (only if some heat is preferred); (v) lite coconut milk rather than regular. Submitter and reviewers say this chili gets better the next day but the first batch we made was devoured, and never made it that long. Anyone who really likes this dish, try Sweet and Spicy Curry with Chickpeas on this site . . . some differences but many similarities to this fantastic recipe. usmcwifey . . . this was so, so good that we’re going to try your Curry Chicken Salad, personal recipe. This is a keeper that gets mounted on the wall.

Fair warning for those of you who object to those of us who review tweaked recipes- stop reading now! I used a whole pound of ground chicken and a leftover chicken breast, a large can of crushed tomatos instead of soup, chicken stock instead of water, black beans instead of red kidney, parsnips instead of carrots, and the whole can of lite coconut milk. I used extra hot mango chutney and doubled the amount called for. I added onion, sweet potato, red bell pepper, a pinch of hot red pepper flakes and a tablespoon of fresh ginger. This was delicious served over brown rice. It was sweet, spicy, earthy and rich. This is obviously a very adaptable recipe, however I would definitely not skip the hot mango chutney. It really makes this special. It was extra excellent the next day over whole wheat couscous with an extra dollop of chutney and a sprinkle of toasted unsweetened coconut. I love this recipe idea and will make it often with or without tweaks.

I am making a double recipe as I post. I did add 2 "new" potatoes, too. I can't stop "tasting" a bean or carrot. YUM. Since this is tomorrow's Sunday dinner, I have time to zip to the market for the mango chutney. I plan to serve it on quinoa. (We are having rice tonight.) I think this is going to be my fav way to use ground turkey. Thank you.

Really great taste with a twist.  I didn't have mango and I left it out and it was still exceptional.  Next time I will do it in the slow cooker.

Yum. I added fresh red peppers and basil from the garden. Served over basmati rice steamed in coconut milk. Mine was a tad sweet. Will try with fresh mango instead next time instead of the chutney. Still, a delicious twist on chili. Yummy with fresh lime squeezed over top.

This Chili is awesome.  Great flavor! I wouldn't change a thing, although I am sure everyone will have ideas of how to personalize it.  It can handle additonal tweaks.  I would recommend it if you really like Thai or Indian flavors.

This dish was absolutely AMAZING!! I doubled the turkey and doubled the tomato soup. Used garlic powder instead of minced garlic. Chopped up some baby carrots. Used hot mango chutney because that's all I could find. It was just the right spiciness for me. I had a difficult time finding the chutney. Luckily Wegman's had it. My local Giant, Weis, and Target didn't carry it. I will definitely be making this again very shortly!

I must start by informing you that I tweaked this recipe some. while I am certain that its perfect as is, I must say...this chili turned out to be THE BEST I have made! everybody (children included), gobbled this up. Now, here is what I changed, I sauteed 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil, 3 cloves of minced garlic, & diced carrots for 7 minutes then added frozen vegi crumbles (instead of turkey). I sauteed until cooked through. I then followed the second part of the recipe using 2 cans of tomato sauce(instead of soup) and using vegi broth(in place of water. I skipped adding the carrots & garlic to the tomato mixture since I already sauteed it with the "meat". I used fat free coconut milk and added it at the end, after everything is cooked together for the stated time. I followed the recipes measurements of the spices. I hope these are helpful suggestions for vegetarians out there that are craving a hearty or even meat eaters that want to try healthier options.

Absolutely delicious! I made no substitutions (except my package of ground turkey was closer to 1lb), and it turned out fantastic. It is definitely on the sweeter side, but that's right up my alley. You could easily spice it up with chili flakes or hot sauce. With my ingredients, it came out to ~385 calories per generous serving, so it's friendly on the diet as well :) Thanks usmcwifey.

This dish is excellent! After reading reviews, I doubled the turkey, used a whole can of coconut, subbed beef broth for the water, subbed hot mango chutney for regular, subbed black beans for kidney, added 1 onion, 1 sweet potato, 1 red bell pepper, 1 Tbs ginger powder, and 1/2 Tbs red chili flakes. served over coconut jasmine rice, but it was hearty enough to eat without the rice. one of my new favorites!

My husband made this recipe for my birthday. It was very very good- we used the slow cooker and the only thing he changed was the meat- he doesn't like ground turkey so he added chicken instead. He said it was his new favorite curry recipe (besides his aunt's curry, who lives in Bangladesh)

Excellent recipe! I've made it several times. I've modified it on occasion. I've substituted lentils (trader joes pre-cooked) for the Turkey, added diced baby potatoes, sautéed onion, 1 full can of light coconut milk, and used 1 full carton of roasted red pepper tomato soup (trader joes) instead of regular. Sooo good! I've even topped off  servings with a dollop of siggi's coconut skyr (gelsons/whole foods) Oh, and I used trader joes mango ginger chutney

This recipe was great!!! My husband and 2 kids (9 & 5) loved it.  I have to admit, it didn't sound like it was going to be so tasty. I did make some modifications based on what I had: I used 1 can of tomato basil soup and 1 can of diced tomatoes. 1 can of black beans instead of kidney beans. Chicken broth instead of water. Peaches and lime instead of mango chutney (I had to get creative here). I also added a small amount of cayenne. I used a small onion instead of onion powder and cooked it while browning the meat (using coconut oil), then put it in the slow cooker on low for about 4 hours. Added the coconut milk in the last 30 min. Served it with brown rice. 
-I did not add corn. Many of the pics showed it although it's not in the recipe.

This was too sweet for my taste. I used hot curry powder thinking it would balance the sweetness but that didn't work so well. This is more like a curry for gringos recipe. Won't be making this again.

I don't know that I'd call it chili, but it is better than any chili I've ever had.  Serve with sriracha if you want a bit more heat.

This was surprisingly good! Had to adapt a few things...Substituted kumquat jam for the chutney cuz we had none. Also no tomato soup on hand, but used a jar of tomato sauce instead. Cut the curry down a little because DH dislikes it. Added a few red pepper flakes and WOW! This was a hit! Even my picky DH enjoyed. Next time I'll saute some onions and omit the onion powder and it's a keeper. Thanks for submitting this!

If you're like me, you regularly face the predicament of having to choose whether you're in the mood for curry or chili. Choose no more! This great recipe allowed me to open my eyes to a new world of culinary combinations - General Tso's pizza,  Sushi Poutine,  ramen hamburgers - the possibilities really are endless. For a "little" twist to this classic recipe, try chopping baby carrots instead of regular carrots!

I've made this several times now and its become one of our favorite meals!  First time I made it exactly as the recipe was written.  Since then I've tweaked it based on what I have in the kitchen..example, tomato sauce for the soup, and a puree canned mango's instead of chutney, switched out beans, etc.    I usually leave out the corn and put in diced zucchini to help bump up the veggie factor.    The beauty of this recipe is the base is really good so tweaking the veggies doesn't change how great it tastes!

Delicious.  I made this on chili night with three other chili recipes.  This was the favorite of many.  I made traditional beef/bean chili and a white bean/chicken chili. I wanted to make a venison chili.  I thought that the game flavor would go well with a curry.  I found this and went with it!

My only regret is the I didn't make it the day before because it was even better the next day.  

I  "eyeballed" my measurements.  But even so, the flavors were wonderful.  I served with couscous. I will be making this again!

My husband and I loved this and our two-year-old daughter even enjoyed some parts of it (carrots, chick peas, and turkey bits)! I didn't have all the ingredients, so I modified it quite a bit, but for me the fact that recipe is so flexible means it is better! I doubled the amount of turkey, left out the water, used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with jalapenos, added 1/2 c each of onion, sweet potato, green pepper, fresh mango, and basmati rice, used 2 tsp garam masala, about 1 tsp of chili powder, and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder instead of the curry powder, and used a full can of coconut milk. I browned the turkey on the stove, and sauteed the onions and green peppers with the spices till they were translucent. Then I put everything in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours. It came out great, and leftovers the next day were even better. It was very thick, so next time I might put in a little water.

This was absolutely delicious and overall pretty healthy!  I loved the chic peas and the curry & coconut is a great flavor combination.  

I didn't have mango chutney, so just simmered some diced mango in minimal water with pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice and ginger) while the chili was cooking and threw it into the chili more toward the end.  Also added some onion and jalepeno to bulk up on the veggies and simmered it a little longer than written in the recipe to really let the flavors combine.  Next time I'll use low sodium tomato soup so I can better control the amount of salt.  The high sodium was really the only unhealthy part of this recipe and is easy to modify.  This will definitely go in our soup rotation for the winter!

This was simple and easy.  I used ground chicken instead of turkey, and replaced kidney beans with double chick peas.  VERY flavorful.

I made it without the ground turkey, and it still turned out great! I would recommend adding more chickpeas or beans if you decide to not add meat like I did.

This chili is amazing. I did substitute the water for beef broth and tripled the mango chutney but after tasting it I am so happy i made this today. This recipe is worth all the effort. Instead of buying mango Chutney I made it myself and it did add a little extra heat. In the last 15 minutes i added a glob of fresh grated ginger and some cinnamon and it definitely added new volume to this meal. Will definitely make again.

DEE-LI-SHUS!!! Being pressed for time, the only thing I did was brown the ground turkey.  After that, EVERYTHING went into the instapot all at once.  Set it & forget it.  

The only subs I made were:
- crushed tomatoes vs tomato soup
- jalapeno jelly vs mango chutney
-black beans vs kidney beans

Definitely freezes well.

It didn't taste like anything too exciting to me. I followed the recipe with the exception that my Mango Chutney was Mango Ginger Chutney. I definitely will only use Mango Chutney if I make it again, but I probably won't because the other flavors didn't stand out to me.

From the list of ingredients I though this would be a nice twist on traditional comfort food, but wow I was not prepared for all the flavor and texture packed into that bowl.  Because so many reviewers noted how sweet they found the chili I opted to use only one can of soup and one can of diced tomatoes.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The flavors were excellent. My only recommendation is try the chili before u add the coconut milk. I did and I really like the flavor imparted by the tomato soup and a lot of that flavor was lost after I added the coconut milk. May not add the coconut milk next time

The thing about chili is you can make it different every time, and every time it will be great. I like this as a foundation to work outside the box. I didn't have chutney, so I used fresh mango and salsa. I also added a bunch of fresh parsley so it tasted really fresh.  I used a bunch of veggies and some fresh ginger too. Yum

Amazing ... very different than normal chili, but still enough of a chili flavor and on top of that the curry flavor is amazing.  Already bought the stuff to do again.

We had a chili contest at work on Halloween this year. There were 7 total pots of chili, and this won it!
I did make a few small changes, just used this as a guide.

I used 1lb turkey instead of half.
Replaced water with chicken broth.
Added red bell pepper
Used a bit more curry, coconut milk, and mango chutney- to taste.
Added a bit of red pepper flakes to increase the heat.
Added some ginger.

It turned out really well. My coworkers scraped every last bit from my crockpot leaving several others chili with a lot leftover. It was a huge hit. Can't wait to make it again with a few more little tweaks too. :)

Yum, yum. One of those recipes where you can tweak it a million different ways to suit your tastes, work with ingredients you've got, and with whatever limitations you might have. Will definitely be making this recipe again (and probably never the same way 2x!)

ARE YOU KIDDING ME WITH THIS?! My family loved it! Great flavour.  Served it over coconut Jasmine rice and with slices of homemade pumpkin yeast bread.  My only regret is having it saved in my recipe box so long without trying it.  This is easy and delicious.  Company worthy.

Very delicious! Ate it over jasmine rice, not a traditional spicy chili, but sweet and unique. I like it a lot and will definitely be making it again. I did add a whole pound of ground turkey instead of just the half it calls for, but kept the rest of the recipe the same.

I expected this to be better than it was.  I made the recipe according to the directions and served over quinoa.  It was "soupier" than I thought it would be.  Perhaps it was the tomato soup that I didn't like.  My family loves chili and curries, but no one really liked this.  I won't be making it again.

Made this recipe many times and everyone loves it, I usually add in a few extra veggies and use an onion instead of the powder.

I always double the recipe and freeze left overs.  This has become a staple in our household.  Especially on days like today where it is snowing! LOVE IT.

I've been making this since there were only 6 reviews. I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. This is so easy and delicious and it is always stuff I have around the house. I put double the turkey and double the coconut milk only because I don't like to have half of stuff sitting in the fridge, and it's still delicious. I also have made it adding sweet potatoes, which is really great too. If you follow the recipe exactly, it won't let you down either. This is a staple weekly recipe for us and we make it for company as well.

This was a hit! I made it exactly except I used ground chicken, and cooked it in the crock pot. Honestly it really did not need any meat at all! Next time I will omit the meat and add potatoes like I saw someone else suggest on here.

Nice twist on chili without an overwhelming bean flavor.  I used 1 lb of turkey to make it a more hearty meal.  Simmered only 15 minutes at the end, and that was plenty.

This was great.  I used creamy tomato soup from Trader Joes and mango ginger chutney since that's what I had on hand.  I also sauteed onion with the turkey because I didn't have onion powder.  Really easy to make.  My husband liked it and my five year old had two helpings.  Thanks.

I thought this had really great flavors. It actually made less than I was expecting - less than 6 dinner-size portions IMO. I took it to a chili cook-off where it received mixed reviews.

Without a doubt this is AMAZING. I did not change much. I just doubled it and only used 1.25lbs of ground turkey, instead of 4 cans of tomato soup (because I doubled) I used 2 cans of tomato soup and one can of diced tomatoes. I also used lite coconut milk. Everyone loved it. This will be a usual in our household!

This is so...so good. I followed the top review by adding potatoes, broth instead of water and used the Campbell's soup. I am a fan of Indian/Thai food and this is restaurant quality. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of tomato puree.  I also added fresh basil and used hot mango chutney and hot curry powder (we like spicy).  This was delicious and I will definitely be making it again!

I liked this recipe. The only thing is that it is too sweet for my personal taste. I had to add some hot sauce to it to balance it out for me. I think I will add a bit less coconut milk next time.

This was fantastic.  I served it one night over basamati rice.  On another night I served it over some whole wheat penne.  I almost like the pasta better.

So happy I found this recipe!  I did tweak it.  I used a large can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup because I don't like things too sweet.  I also added onion, red peppers and a couple of potatoes. This would also be delicious with no meat and more beans or vegetables instead.  I served it over brown rice.  Delicious!  A new favorite.

The weirdest, most wonderful "chili" ever.  I used one pound of turkey, chicken broth instead of water, and black beans instead of garbanzo beans because that's what I had on hand.  I threw it all in the crockpot.  It wasn't spicy at all so I stirred in a few spoonfuls of red curry paste.  I'm thinking next time I might do only red curry and no green curry powder.  I like it spicy.  It's bubbling away right now and I'm going to garnish it with fresh basil when it's done, and maybe a squirt of lime juice too.  I liked it with black and kidney beans - made it look like chili, even though it tastes nothing like regular chili.

Loved it! I was scrounging for something easy to make for my boyfriend for dinner tonight, and he loves curry! But, I wanted something different so I gave this a try! Cut the recipe in half and, having no mango salsa, I subbed his mom's corn salsa instead. I added a pinch of cinnamon, and a tablespoon of cocoa powder, something I almost always add to my curry because it really rounds out the flavor and makes it more savory. And, like most of the reviews, I used chicken stock instead of water. Oh! And I used half nonfat yogurt, half coconut milk to add a bit more zing!

This was delicious!  I did make a few changes according to what I had on hand.  I added celery, sweet potatoes and onion (instead of onion powder) for more vegetables.  Instead of mango chutney I had a mango that I cut up and simmered with sugar, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and ginger.  I also used pinto beans instead of kidney beans.  The last change I made was that I didn't put coconut milk right into the chili since not everyone in my house likes it.  We just poured it into our own bowls before eating.  I was really pleased with the way this recipe turned out!!!  Thank you!!!

This was absolutely AMAZING! I was reading over the ingredients and thought "this is just too out there, I have NO idea how this is going to turn out" but I read the reviews and everyone was raving about it so I thought what the heck, I'll give it a go. I made a lot, 2 lbs of turkey chopped meat so I really just eyeballed the measurements and it still turned out fantastic. I used creamy tomato soup because I wasn't sure which one the recipe called for. I added three generous handfuls of salted peanuts at the end (and omitted the salt the recipe called for) and it added a nice crunch. I served it over long grain brown rice. Everyone loved it. It thickened up beautifully and was even better the next day. I will be making this again (and again...and again...)

This was delicious and so easy to make. My husband says it is his new favorite meal. I didn't have onion powder so I sautéed half a diced onion and added a dash of hot sauce. I will definitely be making this again and often. Thank you for sharing.

It's been quite awhile since I came across a true gem of a recipe! This is absolutely out of the world; knock your socks off delish! 
 Made it exactly as written but did not have mango chutney. I subbed equal parts apricot jam, sweet garlic chili, and hot garlic chili. Also added onion, red chile pepper and green pepper.
 Absolutely amazing!

Great recipe!  Modified it to what I had in my kitchen as we use salt reduced diet. Used 2 - 19 oz cans (no salt added)tomato sauce; didn't add any water; (no salt added) can of a bean medley which included chick peas; and a can of (no salt added) kidney beans.  I didn't add the carrots although I'm sure they would have been good too; and didn't have onion salt so added 1/4 cup chopped onion.  My husband thought it was the best, and I will definitely make it again and pass it on to family and friends.

This was amazing chili! I personally love curry but find it to be very powerful so I halved it and added a little extra onion powder. I also added celery and some mushrooms.. delicious! I will be making this again for sure!

Turned out very good. My family had to get use to the different flavors but everyone ended up liking it. It was even better on the second day.

Very interesting.  While I was preparing it I thought "weird", but this turns out to be a satisfying and tasty meal.  I subsistuted sweet chili sauce for the chutney since I didn't have any, and instead of the beans I added chopped onion and sweet potato.  A bit of turmeric went in too.  It was a tad sweet for my taste so I added some hot sauce to balance the flavours. Served over brown rice and garnished with chopped cilantro and avocado slices.  Thanks usmcwifey.
