This was so delicious! I eat low carb so I ate it mixed with an avocado instead of using the tostada shells. Made the perfect lunch! Thank you!

I used limes rather than lemons because that is what I was used to when making ceviche.  I also served it with corn tortilla chips rather than tortillas.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I did end up putting the jalapeno chopped up in the mix.  This made for an easy appy on the spur of the moment, though it did not do as well as leftovers.  Thanks so much for the idea of this way of using tuna!
