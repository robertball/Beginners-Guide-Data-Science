I prefer this with graham crackers instead of ginger snaps or vanilla wafers, and I also cut the sugar just a little bit (to about 3/4 cup) for personal preference. The dip is delicious. 

But if you really want a wow factor use this dip as a filling for pumpkin spice cupcakes (or layer cake) and watch people go crazy! 1/2 of this recipe will easily fill 24 standard size cupcakes. 

Next time I will probably skip the cool whip and make my own whipped cream, since I always have heavy cream on hand for the cupcakes.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe, but used only 8oz. of Cool Whip. I didn’t want to dilute the flavor. I’ll make it again!

I found this to be way too sweet especially if using it as a dip for cookies or anything that is also sweet. If I ever make this again I will cut back 1/2 on the sugar. I agree with another reviewer that his would make a good filling for cupcakes or a layered cake.

This is fabulous with those store-bought semi soft  molasses cookies or fresh crisp apple slices.  I have made this recipe with lighter versions of cream cheese and cool whip and it's still wonderful.  Always asked to share the recipe..

My friend made this for a party, and it was fantastic!  I made it and brought it as a treat for a Christmas Eve party.  Yum!
