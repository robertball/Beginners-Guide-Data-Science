I thought the recipe was delicious.  I will admit my bias is that anything with salmon and avocado has to be delicious.  To the reviewer who was confused about the weight of the salmon, I  agree the recipe assumes an experienced cook.  I think it is intended for  4-6 people, which means 1.5 - 2 pounds of salmon, depending on appetite and additional options available.  A salmon filet that can be cut into 6 pieces  typically weighs  between 0 .75 -  1 pound.

Great alternative to regular tacos. My husband typically only likes meat tacos, but he absolutely loved this recipe. Didn't use the mango salsa; instead used pre made trader joes garlic salsa and added more lime juice, cilantro and some of the extra avocado.

Great recipe!! For the seafood rub, I used Old Bay Seasoning and the fish was delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

I've made this twice now.  It is Excellent!  The spice I used was Weber's Chili Lime Rub.  Because I do not like mangos, I used peaches.  Yum.  My husband says this is a keeper.

My husband isn't fond of salmon so I substituted cod, used one less mango, and served all in low carb, high-fiber tortillas.  Husband really liked it; will make again and may try other types of fish.  Wonder how it would be with shrimp?  The salsa recipe is worth making by itself - does make a large quantity - very good as a side dish or on ham wraps.

I grilled the salmon and that added a nice smokey flavor to that blended nicely with the fruity salsa.  My husband really liked these.  I thought it was a nice change from regular fish tacos.

Everyone loved it.  Even those who said they don't eat avocados loved it.  I used the salmon filets instead of salmon steaks.  I seasoned the salmon early and let them sit in the fridge for about 4 hours.  Added a little more lime juice.

Wow! My family has a new taco for Taco Tuesday.  Prep was a little  longer but next time I will make the salsa and season the salmon the night before or in the morning before work. I made my children eat it as is without cheese and stuff and they loved it.  My side dish was refried pinto beans and Whole Foods tortilla chips.

This will be become regular favorite.  So delicious and healthy!  I did use Haddock instead of Salmon and added red onion to the salsa.  Couldn't find the fish rub so I used Cajun spice.  Can't wait for our next taco night!

we loved this recipe. I dislike the fishy taste of salmon  but the rub and the mango salsa completely eliminated that taste. I did not add the jalapeños as we are not spices fans. Next time I will add fresh pineapple to the salsa.

This is a great alternative to regular tacos which my wife and I love to eat.   She said to me that she cannot imagine eating a fish taco but trusted my instinct on this and was willing to take the adventure.    I followed the recipe pretty well but pared it down for 2 and not 4.  It needed a little salt as my salmon rub did not contain any significant salt.   The sweet married well with the seasoned salmon.   I was not able to secure soft corn tacos and used soft flour taco shells instead.   A wrap would have worked just as well and perhaps even better.  What fun!!  Thanks for the alternative taco.    Love it!

This makes enough salsa for two large fillets of salmon. 
I seasoned the salmon up and let it sit while I prepared the salsa and some Spanish Rice.   I put the cilantro and jalapeno in a separate dish as some of my family members do not tolerate the heat.   
For the rub I used Mrs. Dash salt free SouthWest Chipotle blend. 
Again, since some members of my family don't do spice well I seasoned one fillet with dill weed.

We will be making this again and will be making the salsa just as a relish for other foods or as a stand alone salad.   I did put some ginger into the salsa.   

You could broil the fish if you're not fond of pan frying.

I doubled ingredients so I had leftovers for guys at work, and did shrimp with it seasoned the same as the salmon, it was to die for! I like spicy, however, so I personally next time will be trying this with a habanero pepper, it was great when I added a few drops of el yucateca habanero Chile sauce! But both ways was great!

These were delicious.  I didn't have any sweet and spicy seasoning, so I used some Cajun with brown sugar.  I also used frozen mango for the salsa and it worked just fine.  Will make again.

To make it even healthier- just skip the tortillas and put the blackened salmon and mongo salsa on top of a big bed of lettuce. If you need extra juices spray fresh lemon or lime on top!!!! So delicious and soooo healthy

So good!!! We ate them without the tortillas and it made so much, I had enough to eat some of the filling as a side for another meal. Definitely will make again.
Second time- used lemon juice instead of lime and no one noticed. Super good but too much chili powder for my weak family.

have made several times, always a big hit.  The salsa is good all by itself.  I will try with other meats.  Have used both flour and corn soft taco shells, but could easily skip the taco shells and serve in a bowl or on a plate

My husband and I loved this recipe! It is so quick, easy and delicious. We use daily half cod and half shrimp since my husband doesn’t like salmon. Both were delicious! I liked the contrast of the sweet mango salsa and the fish- very flavorful. My only comment is that the recipe makes a LOT of salsa. I might just make it with two mangoes next time and see if that makes a more appropriate amount.

Tried to put a photo in but wouldn’t let me. But this is a wonderful healthy dish, compatible with many diets. Also, it is SUPER delicious. I made it exactly how it is said other than the rub for fish I used Cali blackened dry rub. Also, I made a savory lemon aioli sauce which complimented the tacos very much. I recommend that sauce with these tacos. So many levels of flavors and textures, tbh words cannot describe how good this meal was. I will probably talk about it for years.

I rate a recipe 5 stars only when I would serve it to company. This recipe is awesome!  I made minor changes. I made my own spice recipe from The Chew (Carla Hall), added garlic to the salsa and grilled the salmon. Grilled the salmon flesh side down first and then flipped to skin side down.  In the winter I will do it in a pan on the stove.  Yum, yum, yum!!

Save yourself the trouble and use skinless fish.  It was such a pain to try to peel it off and it leaves the dark lateral line which makes it a more “fishy” taste.

This recipe does not disappoint! I used 2 lbs Atlantic salmon, and in lieu of the “seafood rub” used the blackened rub in the “Blackened Salmon Filets” recipe (also allrecipes.com). Used a cast iron griddle on the gas BBQ and the salmon was perfect. As noted by another user, cooked to 130 degrees, and I let the salmon rest while I heated up the corn street taco tortillas. The guys loved the mango avocado salsa. This will be on our Taco Tuesday rotation for sure. This recipe would be great for a summer get together with guests. I rubbed the salmon a few hours in advance and kept refrigerated; the salsa can be made well in advance too.

Delicious! I happened to come across this recipe last night. I made blackened Salmon for dinner and had leftover Salmon. So all I had to do was make the Mango Salsa...and used the leftover Salmon. It was very good and didn't feel like we were having leftovers!  I added a little onion to the salsa for added spice.

Delicious and pretty darn healthy recipe.  I usually prefer salmon cooked on the grill but with the spices added in the frying pan, this salmon was very tasty.  Warning, allow mucho time for chopping.  Other than that, this recipe is easy and yummy.  Oh, next time I will use 2 avocados.

Excellent!  I made the salsa as written, though I did use a little extra lime juice.  I did not have a pre-made sweet and spicy seafood seasoning so I threw one together with brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, a little cayenne, a touch of cumin, a pinch of salt, and a little chile-lime seasoning.  I cooked the fish in a hot pan skin side down until almost done and then flipped over and continued cooking until thickest part of the piece of salmon was 130°F and allowed to rest for 5 minutes.  Served for company and received rave reviews!

I used this recipe as a guide. I didn't have all the ingredients and substituted a lot but still turned out beautifully. For the salsa, I couldn't get mango so I used sweet red papaya and I went for corn rather than the orange pepper. Instead of salmon I used rainbow trout with lemon pepper and fajita seasoning. And to add a veggie element I sautéed some zucchini with garlic and dried onion in a little olive oil and and pomegranate balsamic. So, so tasty. I just know if I'd had all the elements for the complete recipe it would have been brilliant too.

Perfect light summery dish! I had a ton of mangoes that I needed to use up and was looking for something light for dinner that wouldn't take me a long time, but would still be delicious. This was really good! The salmon was really good and super quick to throw together. I used a seafood seasoning that I found on pinterest and followed the recipe exactly as written. I will definitely make these again! Chef John never disappoints!

Fantastic recipe, seriously. Simple but very balanced with the seasoning of the salmon complimented well by the sweet and tart of the salsa. I live in Arizona and do like spicy food, next time I may add an additional jalepeno, perhaps a pinch of cayenne and would say don't be scant on the salt. An extra pinch seemed to really bring out the flavor in the salsa and the salmon. We'll be adding this as a go-to for sure. I used street taco size corn tortillas for a smaller ratio of salmon and salsa to tortilla which I think helps the texture concern in another review. I also made sure to cook the salmon until a very dark crust had formed to get a slight crunch, otherwise it could've been a bit mushy when combined with mango and avocado textures.

One change was  I made a paste using apple butter for the rub with spices since I did not have a sweet rub. Only suggestion is cut your portions in strips prior to pan cooking. My filets looked perfect but in cutting after cooking they fell apart. The taste was amazing and very easy to make. My red hat sisters enjoyed this at poolside.

Awesome fish tacos! Next time will add a bit more spice though. Maybe a second jalepeno. The mango and avocado seem to cancel out the heat.
