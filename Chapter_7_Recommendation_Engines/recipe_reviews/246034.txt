Delicious, soft and very fudge-like. I had to mix the dough by hand and it resembled more like a play doh consistency, but that made it super easy to roll into a long log and cut into the size cookies I wanted. Very good vegan cookie.

I did leave out a few things only because i didn't have them on hand and a trip to the market was not an option at that time, I am glad i did as they came out fantastic ! I didn't add the bananas and i used all purpose flour. I used more cocoa powder and added brown sugar  and a tsp of cornstarch so the cookies weren't oily , I also added a tsp of coffee to enhance the cocoa and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon . Definitely keeping this one in my recipe files

I used melted butter instead of coconut oil, so my version was NOT vegan. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to wet mixture. Prior to baking, I weighed each drop of dough to 1oz, rolled into a ball then flattened before putting into oven. 8 minutes at 350 worked well for me. I like that I have the flexibility to make this vegan if needed.

Did these gluten free, not as tasty as I'd hoped, though not horrible.  Could taste the banana & salt

Very chocolatey. Moist. Mine did not flatten when baked. So more like a cookie brownie.  Baked it with all ingredients.

Used reg flour & had to add almond milk to make it i to a doughy texture. Without it, it was a dry powder that just fell apart. Just add non dairy milk

Perfectly delicious. They were even better the second day.  We followed the suggestion to roll it and cut it.

They stuck to the pan. Teenager says they are OK tasting and he will eat them.  I'm not making these again.
