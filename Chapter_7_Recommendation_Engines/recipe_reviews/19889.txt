This chicken was delicious!  The golden brown crust was crunchy and sealed the juices into the chicken.  I prepared this using 10 chicken legs, which I first seasoned with Fiesta brand Chicken Rub (available in Texas).  Because of cross-contamination concerns with the raw chicken, I changed the method of preparation.  In a shallow bowl, I mixed the 1 cup of dry bread crumbs, the ½ tsp of onion powder, and the 1 tsp of dried parsley.  In a separate bowl, I added ½ can of the mushroom soup only.  I rolled my seasoned chicken into the mushroom soup then rolled into the dry crumb mix. This allowed the crumb mixture to adhere to the chicken resulting in a delicious crust.  I drizzled with the 2 TBLs of melted butter, and baked as instructed.  I used the other ½ can of the mushroom soup and a ½ can of milk to make gravy, which we served over white rice.  My husband loved this meal!  Thank you Doris!

My husband and I loved this dish! I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs. I also added fresh cracked pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. As for the concern of using the soup mixture after the raw chicken had been in it, I set aside about 1 1/2 cups before dipping the chicken. We will be having this again!

Great recipe! Here's what I did: I took 1/4c can mushroom soup and a cup of milk and whisked them together.  I also added garlic salt for flavor.  I trimmed the fat off the chicken thighs (which I think are better than chicken breast b/c the bone holds in all the flavor).  In a separate bowl I mixed a packet of onion soup mix and a 3/4c breadcrumbs. Dipped the thighs in the soup mix then rolled it in the dry mix.  I placed them on a wire rack over a pan and sprayed it with spray butter.  Cooked it at 375 for 45 mins.  Was cooked perfectly.  I took the remaining soup, whisked in a cup of milk (added more garlic salt to taste), and about 2 tsp of cornstarch.  I did everything to taste/look.  I cooked rice and some steamed asparagus with it.  Great meal no leftovers!

I was searching for an easy and tasty dish using chicken thighs, and I was very pleased with this recipe.  I recommend removing the skin from the thighs as the crumbs will stick better.  I used reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and 8 oz of skim milk for a light version.  I also recommend Italian seasoned bread crumbs for extra flavor.  This is a nice dish served with flavored couscous and pinto beans.  I highly recommend.

This was really good! Everyone liked it. The only thing I did differently was to add some onion soup mix (dry) to the bread crumbs to punch up the flavor. YUM!

This recipe is simple and delicious.  To the mushroom soup, I added garlic powder along with the onion powder.  I also added some Mrs. Dash because I didn't have any dried parsley.  I  seasoned the bread crumbs with salt and pepper, and still didn't find the end product too salty.  I decided not to make the sauce, because I don't like the thought of eating a sauce that I previously used to dip raw chicken pieces in...even if I am going to boil it!  All in all, my  family loved this and I'll add this to my rotation. Thanks Doris.

Incredibly yummy comfort food recipe, very easy and minimal work - great for busy weekdays when you just want to throw something in the oven and relax after coming home. I usually put on the rice cooker while popping the chicken in the oven and voila! Dinner is ready within an hour, and mama has time for a glass of wine and an episode of something while it cooks. Thanks for sharing this!

After reading all the reviews I decided to try it.  I used unseasoned bread crumbs but added a tiny bit of parmesan cheese to the crumbs.  I used boneless thighs.  It was so easy! My 12 year old liked it without the sauce, while my husband and I enjoyed the sauce.  
I made it a second time, this time with italian seasoned bread crumbs and actually preferred it with the unseasoned.  You need to go with your family preferences.

Sounds delicious!  For those concerned with the "contamination" issue.  The sauce is COOKED... like the chicken... so there will be no contamination issue!  I've cooked and served my teriyaki marinade as my mother always did.  No one ever got sick because it's COOKED.

I doubled this recipe so we could have left overs. Good thing since it was a big hit. I removed the skin from my thighs to cut back on the greasiness. I added about 1/4 cup sour cream to the soup/milk mixture for added kick. Served it with mashed potatoes and a green vegie. Didn't use the cornstarch as the "gravy" was thick enough.

I switched it up a bit and used low fat milk, butter, and soup. This dish was delicious and very easy.  I didn't have to go to the store to buy anything, I had everything I needed at home. The chicken stayed really moist, while the skin was nice and crisp. I served this with stuffing which worked great with the sauce.

An easy, tasty recipe, but, might I suggest you separate the soup mixture into two portions, use as much as needed for the dipping, then discard, using the untainted portion for the sauce, also I add some evaporated milk for extra creaminess !

Easy and tasty. I had to modify a bit to use what I had on hand, and the results were delicious: Campbell's roasted garlic cream of mushroom instead of plain, Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and thyme instead of parsley. I skipped the onion powder because of the garlic in the soup.  SO GOOD. I will definitely be making this again.

I'd be very leary of using the sauce you just dipped raw chicken in for the gravy. Maybe reserve some on the side for gravy. Wouldn't want anyone to get sick!

We loved this! It's definitely a "keeper". However, I did have a concern about using the soup mixture after dipping the raw chicken in it. I put 1/2 of the mixture aside to use as the sauce.

Simple, frugal and positively delightful, this meal can be thrown together easily, and can be tweaked any number of ways to suit individual tastes.  We prepare this one often, and usually don't doctor it up much, preferring to leave it as it is, pure comfort foot.

Very moist and tasty.  I used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs and it was very good.  I also only made half the can of soup first to coat the chicken and then later made the other half to make the sauce.  Didn't like the idea of using the soup mix that had raw chicken dipped in it to make the sauce because I didn't think the heat used was high enough to kill any bacteria from raw chicken.

This didn't turn out well for me.  I used boneless skinless thighs and followed the directions exactly.  The sauce was really thick and made it hard to dredge in the crumbs.  I used plain bread crumbs and felt that the chicken was pretty tasteless.  Definitely needs more seasoning, salt or something.  Also my coating didn't bake crisp.  Needs some tweaking.

Mom made this for us kids when we were growing up and now I make it for my husband and kids. May not be the most eye-appealing recipe ever but it sure was comforting. For me, sometimes you just need those recipes made with the Cream of soups. This bends to use lighter ingredients (like Healthy Request soup, fat free evaporated milk, chicken breasts) and you can spice up your breadcrumbs anyway you choose. I like this best with rice but my boys like it with buttered egg noodles. NOTE: If you brown the breaded chicken, then bake it and serve the gravy on the side, that will give you a close enough flavor to the original recipe without making it soggy.

We thought these were soooooo good! They came out juicy and tender. I did remove the skin before coating. The dipping sauce was a special treat that my husband just loved! I did, however, forget to use the butter and I don't think it made any difference. This recipe rocks! Thanks for posting!!

Nice option instead of fried chicken. To be on the safe side, after I made the mushroom "marinade" I separated the sauce to avoid cross contamination. Better safe than sorry. For health reasons I also removed the skin from the chicken and it tasted great. This process would work great on porkchops too.

very simple to make.. simple ingredients. dh loved these and he's not a fan of mushrooms.... I made a couple changes.. 
I did not save any of the 'soup mixture' after dipping the raw chicken (I used 1/2 a can and tossed the 'used' leftovers and froze the remaining 'unused') I didn't want to push the mushrooms on dh so I didn't using the sauce as a topping, hence didn't use cornstarch.

I baked until crispy.

Great, simple recipe.

Soup mixture was thick enough without adding the cornstarch.

very easy to make and came out delicious! I removed the skin from the thighs and used panko crumbs. I also omitted the milk and diluted the cream of mushroom soup with a little chicken stock.Suggested by another reviewer, I reserved about 1/2 the can of soup for the sauce to avoid contamination. I also added a small can of mushroom slices to the sauce. It was perfect with steamed rice and peas!

This was really good!  The ingredients worked well together with the chicken thighs.  I divided the soup/milk and seasonings in half - used one half for dredging and discarded the left over,  and then I used the other half as the sauce.  I also added chopped fresh mushrooms to the sauce and bit of black pepper.  Other than that, I followed the recipe accordingly and it worked out well!

Cooking time was about hour. I used legs and breasts. Also used about 1/4 can of the soup to coat chicken and 3/4 can for the gravy that I served over garlic mashed. Had left overs following night and just as awesome!!!

I loved how easy this was to make and how good were the results. I like dark meat and my husband likes the white so I combined both and both turned out great. He was raving about how moist the meat was and how the sauce went well with both the meat and TJ fries. I used half the recipe since I made it just for 2 of us and substituted canned milk with half and half since that's what I had in a fridge but it was still great.

My family liked this very much. It was quick and easy yet presents as if I'd taken more time than I did. To avoid the cross-contamination concerns, I simply reserved 1 cup of the mushroom sauce before dipping the chicken. I also added garlic powder, paprika, and dried chives to my bread crumbs. We will put this in our dinnertime lineup.

We absolutely loved this recipe. I have made it a few times and love it-I used regular bread crumbs because we tried it with the italian seasoned and did not care for it that way.

This was great, but I think next time I'll use BLSL chicken breasts. I mixed some parmesan cheese and garlic powder in with the bread crumbs. I skipped the melted butter step and don't think I missed anything.  I DO have a really yummy suggestion: I topped ours with chopped pecans and it was GREAT!  Served with brown rice, corn, and asparagus.

I liked this, but would modify it dramatically the next time. Here's my thoughts.    A 9x13 pan really crowded 8 dipped and breaded thighs. Needed 10 more minutes cooking time  Why can't the mushroom mix be simmered for 20 minutes and served as a sauce? I has not been used as a marinade, and is therefore safe.  Use skinless thighs. I did NOT like biting through the crunchy breadcrumbs into a soft, fatty skin. Each thigh has a mushroom coating which will keep it moist.  I used finally chopped sweet onion in the sauce. My pantry does not contain onion powder. (foodsnob! foodsnob!)   I used Panko breadcrumbs. Nice crunchy texture but I would cook the chicken at 350 till nearly done then finish them off at 375-400 for 10 minutes to crisp up the coating.  Looking forward to the leftovers on this one...

My husband liked this, but I thought it was kind of bland. Next time I will definately add some salt and Italian Seasoning to the breading along with a pinch of flour. I cooked the chicken by placing them on a cooling rack over a pie pan. That way they were raised off the pan and the juices could flow into the dish without making a mess of my stove. I also flipped the chicken half way through cooking it so it was crispy on both sides.

I really enjoyed this recipe as did my kids.
It was very crispy and such great flavor . I only made a couple of changes I used only have the can of soup and reserved the other half for the sauce. Not to keen on reusing sauce tainted with chix blood and I used fresh garlic.
Will definately use again. Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband and I don't add much (if any) salt to our food, so the salty quotient of this dish nearly shot our heads off.  If I make this again, I would cut the soup mix in half and in agreement with a previous poster, add milk to what seemed like a rather thick sauce/gravy.

It was quite bland. I would recommend not using bone in chicken. It was messy to eat. I added garlic and poultry seasoning as suggested by others to add extra flavour but still wouldn't make it again.

I used cream of mushroom with garlic (split the mixture as most suggested) and added pepper, minced onion, and garlic powder to the 'sauce', which I thickened with flour. For the chicken, I used organic BLSL breast meat which I coated in an unseasoned version of the soup mixture, then rolled in panko/onion soup mix, baked on a rack at 400 for 30 minutes and it was delicious! Served with the sauce over rice and it was a hit!

Very quick & easy to make.
Loved it!! used almond milk instead of regular milk and it came out great, just the same.
Didn't need cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  The gravy rounds out the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! My Husband LOVED it! The chicken thighs came out SO tender and it was just so yummy over rice. The only thing I did differently was add less milk and added my own salts and spices as well as remove the skin (: will definitely be making again!

This recipe sounded delicious and it was!  I made it almost exactly as the original - I only added a bit of parmasan cheese to the breadcrumbs and a sprinkle of paprika, garlic and pepper to the soup mixture.  I recommend making the "gravy" - it was fantastic.  We drizzled it over stuffing and egg noodles.  This recipe leaves a lot of room to make it to your family's taste - we will make this again!  Yummy!

This recipe was good, but not spectacular.  It tasted a lot like Shake N' Bake with cream of mushroom soup as a gravy.  I followed the advice of others to make it more flavorful since when I made it as is and tasted the bread crumb mixture before dipping the chicken into it, it did taste a bit bland.  So, I added garlic powder and italian seasoning.  Then, like the others, I dipped the chicken thighs into part of the can of soup (saving the other part for the gravy) with skim milk (instead of the canned milk).  It was easy to make, but maybe I had too high of expectations from the other reviews of how it was going to taste.  It was just OK.

This was easy and super tasty!  The only thing I did to change it was before I heated the sauce mixture in the sauce pan I sauteed some chopped onion and fresh mushrooms...added a dash of white wine, let it cook down for about a minute and then added the sauce to heat through as directed.  Additionally, I topped it with fresh parley...De-lish!

This is a keeper!!!  I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and they came out sooo tender and nicely crisp on the outside.  I did not have onion powder so i used garlic powder instead, next time I will use both.  I served this over rice as pictured, with a side of roasted asparagus and mushrooms (a recipe also found on allrecipes.com).  It was a very elegant and easy meal that tasted like i had spent hours in the kitchen!

I was surprised at how good this was. Followed the recipe as is, and it makes a simple and easy weeknight meal. It is really good reheated too. The sauce is what makes it...easy comfort food. I like to have it with seasoned rice and a veggie on the side. Simple but amazing.

I made this chicken for Christmas dinner last night, but used mashed potatoes. It was very good, (I didn't care for the gravy, but my family loved it). I didn't make many changes, and I think it may have been better if I had left it alone, but I didn't, next time I will not add anything to the ingredients, but this time I added dry Lipton Onion/Mushroom Soup to the mixture before baking,. I also boiled the soup mixture (gravy) at the end, and used a thermometer to make sure the gravy mixture got hot enough, for fear of bacteria. I think that it's a bad idea to follow the recipe and just heat the mixture after dipping raw chicken in it.

This was a good, easy to prepare dinner.  My husband gave it 3 stars but I added the fourth because it was easy.  We enjoyed the flavor of the coating.  For the sauce I added some onions, fresh mushrooms and garlic that I sauted a bit.  I served it with brown rice and green beans.  My hubby loved the sauce on the beans!!  Thanks, I'm sure I will make this again!

The flavor of this recipe gets four stars. It was pretty good. I gave it an overall rating of five stars because it was so easy and cheap. I did not use the sauce but I think it would have made it better. This goes great over rice. I used large thighs and 45 minutes was not long enough. I turned the oven up to 400, peeled the skin back to expose the meat, and cooked for an additional 10 minutes.

I made this last night and it was great, I used thighs and drumsticks added some garlic power to dipping sauce. Used seasoned bread crumbs I also did not make sauce to pour over the chicken, it was great without it.  Will make this again!

My family loved this and they are very picky eaters! I omitted the can of milk and instead used 8 oz of chicken broth and I removed the skins which cut down on the amount of grease the chickens sat in. I didnt flip the chicken like everyone suggested and it was fine. I served it with rice and stringbeans and everyone loved it! Love the cost value of this recipe b/c thighs are so inexpensice compared to other chicken parts!

Husband & Sons liked this one........and thighs are cheap.  I added canned button mushrooms to the gravy and like others, some garlic.  Used Italian bread crumbs, too, and just started sprinkling garlic powder and paprika in with them for a little added flavor.   Served with tri-color noodles and sweet peas....both good with a little of the gravy on, too.  This can become an easy thigh recipe for once in a while around here.

This recipe was wonderful, I made a few changes.  Instead of bread crumbs I crushed a package of preimum plus crackers.  I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  The result was the yummiest chicken cutlets I ever had.  The family loved them.  I will be making this one again!  Barb Sepke

I thought it was okay, but husband really liked this, so I guess I will be making it again.  Might be tasty (though more expensive) to try this with chicken breasts as well.

I will most certainly be making this again. It was easy, looked pretty, and tasted good!  I added fresh mushrooms to the sauce and seasoned the bread crumbs with onion and garlic powder and parm cheese.  Very good for a monthly rotation!

I made this just as specified, except I only had italian bread crumbs on hand, so I used those. Used skin-off, bone-in thighs. My son hates bone-in chicken (it's gross! There are veins!) and also mushrooms. He LOVED this recipe.

Easy to make, but next time I will use skinless chicken thighs...the chicken was swimming in way too much grease by the time it was done.  I should have known better.

This was a very delicious dish, especially since thighs are always the tastiest part of any bird.  I did however remove the skin - in order to cut down a bit on the fat & calorie content. Nevertheless, it was still very tasty & juicy. I used a 50/50 mixture of Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and Panko (since we like our chicken a bit crunchy.)  To the leftover sauce I sprinkled in a couple of tiny dashes of garlic powder and some very finely chopped 'fresh parsley' for yet more flavor and aroma.  This chicken was a huge hit with my family our guests (I doubled the recipe).  I'll definitely be making this again, as it's already in my 'recipe rotation'.

My only comment is that the bread crumbs got stuck to the pan although it was well greased.
 Nevertheless it was delicious. It really got us out of the traditional tomato sauce-based marination.

I made this delicious recipe tonight. The only thing I changed was that I added some sour cream to the mushroom soup coating, paprika to the bread crumbs,fresh mushrooms to the gravy and removed the skin from the thighs.  The family absolutely loved it.   Served with spinach sautéed in garlic, mash potatoes and a side salad.  The family ate every bite.  Thank you for the recipe!

I have made this recipe time and time again, and every person I make it for absolutely raves about it!  I change it up just a little bit.  I mix panko bread crumbs with italian bread crumbs, and with the sauce, I add white wine and garlic.  But other than that, I didn't touch it.  And the first time I made it, I didn't touch it and it came out GREAT! The chicken is always so moist and tender.  It's a simple recipe that when you are done looks like you slaved all day in the kitchen to prepare it. I have prepared it with both skin off and on.  That is all preference, the flavor is the same.  And I always forget the onion powder because I don't use that spice much, and it doesn't hinder it at all. It's a very versitle recipe.

Very easy to make and very delicious.  Did add a package of onions soup mix to the soup mixture.  I sprayed a cookie sheet with cooking spray placed the chicken on it then coated the chicken with the spray, instead of using butter.( made 16 thighs, chose not to serve with extra gravy).  Baked at 375 until done. PERFECT:)

Amazing recipe! I only gave it four stars because I made some changes suggested by other reviews. I used seasoned bread crumbs and added about half a packet of onion seasoning mix. I only used about a quarter of the soup and milk mixture for dredging, the rest for the sauce. I also baked the chicken on a rack over a baking sheet, and that helped the chicken stay extra crispy, especially on the bottom. Served it over rice with the sauce and steamed broccoli. Delicious!

So quick and easy and very taste to boot.  My husband, a very picky eater raved about it.  Seemed like the chicken needed salt, perhaps before coating or in the bread crumbs.  Other than that it was superb.

When I was a child, my mother would make something similar to this:  a can(s) of mushroom soup mixed together with garlic, fresh mushrooms, milk/water and baked together with chicken breast and thighs.  Served over angel hair pasta.  I'm going back 55 years so this was before skin/bones were removed.  Great flavor!  I make it now but I also add a can of cream of chicken.

Very juicy.  I used Panko bread crumbs and added some parmesan cheese to it before dipping.  I also added some diced onion and jalapeno to the soup.  The parmesan cheese browns nicely with the bread crumbs.

This was very, very good.  A little messy to put together, the crumbs and soup were pasty to handle.  I put the wetter results on the chicken and rolled it up jellyroll style and used garlic bread crumbs and cream of mushroom with garlic canned soup for coating.  I didn't need to thicken the sauce. YUM!!

This was an excellent change from just "grilled' chicken thighs, I only added a dash of minced garlic to the "soup" and a pinch of sage.  But only after tasting the soup as it was thickening up to the "gravy stage".  Just a personal preference I suppose, the mixture was great for the baking process itself.  This is a keeper in my book.  Thanks.

I did not care for this. The bottom was all soggy and it wasn't cooked in 45 minutes.  Jacked it up to 400 degrees for the last ten minutes, but still seemed to "juicy".  I even used a wire rack to try and help crisp it up.  Do not recommend at all.

Perfect for cold weather like today! I used crushed Pringles instead of bread crumbs so I omitted the butter. Very tasty! Went perfect with rice and veggies. Reminded me of Mommy's cooking. It is a nice simple recipe that you can doctor to your own tastes or leave it as is. Either way it is sure to be tasty.

When I was making this dish I used low fat cream of mushroom soup. I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used southern chicken breader (like flour? maybe it is the same thing, i'm brand new to cooking!) and I also added french fried onions to the flour/bread bowl. I dredged my chicken thighs (bone with skin) in the mushroom soup and flour. Cooked for suggested 45 minutes. My first bite I thought: "Yum!" but after finishing the first thigh I felt a little pushed to the edge. To me it was rather rich and it was a bright yellow color. I think that was from the flour I used (and I wouldn't use it again for the recipe). I think next time I'd buy boneless/skinless thighs for this dish too. Also, I'd leave it in an extra 5 minutes because it wasn't crispy enough for me.

This recipe came out really great and I only had to tweak it a little. I added salt and pepper to both the bread crumbs and the sauce. I also added garlic powder to the sauce before I coated the chicken with it. Then, I sauteed some onions and mushrooms in the saucepan, added a little salt and pepper then added the remaining sauce and reduced. The chicken got nice and crunchy and was great served over rice with a bit of the sauce on it. Definitely a redo and the family loved it!

My entire family loved this recipe!  The second time I made it, I had to double it.  It is really amazing warmed up too.  The only change that I made was to use twice as many mushrooms because my family loves them.

I didn't know mushrooms had thighs! But I tried it anyway and it was wonderful. Used Panko bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. Really crunchy!

Soooo good.  I removed the skin as mentioned in someone else's review and used skim milk.  I also let the thighs marinate in the soup mixture for about 2 hours or so.  I sprayed the top of the thighs with no calorie spray butter.  Everything was great.  I did not reuse the soup mixture that the thighs sat in therefore I just made a new gravy.

I can't believe I'd forgotten to rate this recipe.  I often buy chicken leg quarters on the cheap, and this is an easy go-to for them.  Sometimes you just want simple, no-brainer tasty food, and this fits the bill.  (Now fits the "bill" better than ever!)

I thought that it lacked flavor. DH stated "this is really good." Even went back for seconds.
Used boneless/skinless thighs,italian bread crumbs and healthy mushroom soup.
Next time I will spice it up and use 1/2 white wine and 1/2 milk.
Thanks for sharing a decemt recipe for chicken thighs.

This was just fantastic.  My husband and kids loved it.  I separated the mushroom sauce into two, one for dipping the chicken, and one for cooking.  I poured the mushroom sauce over the chicken about 15 min. before taking out of the oven, and it turned out great.

I gave this recipe four stars, but it's a four leaning towards a three only because mine came out kind of soggy. With the soup sauce as a base to the breadcrumbs, the chicken never became crispy from baking. If I could go back, I would have pan fried them first or broiled them for 10 extra minutes.

Other than that, I doubled the sauce because I was having mashed potatoes (which it went well with), I topped the chicken with one diced onion and a can of sliced mushrooms. 

I also took the advice of another member and cooked an extra 10 mins at 400 degrees.

Good recipe.  Fast and easy.  I didn't have cornstarch so I thickened my soup mixture with flour.  I used my extra soup mixture to pour on top of chicken and white rice.  It was very good.

It wasn't bad, just not thrilling. I used flavored breadcrumbs(progresso), which added more zing i think. Also-good with mashed potatoes!

This recipe came out a lot better than I expected! I've used soup recipes before, so I had a feeling I knew what I was getting, but the taste here was wonderful!! I did take off the skins of the thighs and added mushrooms to the sauce after cooking them in butter. In all, I totally recommend this recipe!

I've made this recipe a few times and every time the chicken is juicy and flavorful. The preparation time is very short and the sauce is good whether you use it on rice, potatoes, or noodles. The recipe is flexible enough so you can add your own touches such as the spices you like, garlic, sliced onions and other vegetables to the sauce, and much more. A great recipe without any esoteric ingredients which makes it perfect for me.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, with no changes...and I'm sorry to say we didn't much care for this. The chicken breading turned out kind of nice on top, but was mushy on the underside from the breading sitting in the juices the chicken gives off.  If you top it with the gravy, that makes the top mushy too. Even my three tall teenagers, who eat just about everything, asked me not to make this again ... and refuse to eat it as leftovers, which I have plenty of because it didn't go over very well the night before.  Sorry Doris, but I won't make this again.

I liked the basic recipe - prepared pretty much as written.  Might change the cut though as thighs tend to be a bit fatty and greasy.  Everyone enjoyed, may play with this a bit more!

We enjoyed this chicken but I did a little altering...I added some mushrooms and extra an extra soup. I used the extra sauce to pour over my rice. YUMMY :)

I did not try it because I do not like mushrooms, but it was very easy to make and my family loved it.  The only change we did was to just made the sauce a little thicker, pour it on top and sprinkle bread crumbs on top of that.  This will defiitely be made again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was edible, but not impressive. The strong-tasting thigh meat overpowered the bland coating (even though I tried to add a little more zip to it). It might be good with a breast.

I thought this was okay...my fiance thought it was soggy. Next time I would leave off the gravy...let people put it on if they wanted to. I would also like to try it with chicken breasts.

This is one of our favorites. Seasoned breadcrumbs speed it up - if you don't have cream of mushroom soup on hand, mayonnaise thinned with a little milk works. You just won't have the gravy to serve with the chicken.

This was pretty good.  I made my own mushroom soup using morels which I think helped give it more flavor.  Really not much different than most oven baked chicken though which we always like.  The sauce I saved for poring over the chicken after it was baked really didn't do all that much for the meat.  I may or mat not use this recipe again but as I said it was ok.

Very easy.  A little bland for my taste.  Next time I will add Season or Garlic Salt.  I poured the remaining sauce over egg noodles and my      1-year-old loved it.

It was delicious!Very easy to make.  May I suggest that when mixing the soup with other ingredients, so that not to contaminate the entire batch of soup, divide it in half and use one for dipping the chicken and the other for gravy.

I made it last week and we loved it so much I am making it again tonight. I used Italian bread crumbs for a little bit more seasoning but other than that I made it as written and I’ll be making it again and again. Thanks for sharing.

Man, I'm disappointed to say this was kinda bland. The only thing I did differently was use boneless skinless chicken thighs. I had high hopes since I like all of the ingredients in the recipe...but it was lacking depth of flavor. Honestly though, it's not surprising since cream of anything soup is just salt lol (I still like it though!). Thanks for sharing!

Used water instead of milk. No cornstarch for sauce. 45 minus at 350 wasn’t enough so at 45 min mark mode up to 375 and cooked for 20 more mins.

I used 5 chicken legs , went by the recipe. I cooked it in my toaster oven, same temp and time. This was delicious, a little bland, maybe more spice next time. The chicken legs were tender and very juicy. The coating was awesome. I will definitely be making this again soon!  Thanks Twinkles0303

Really liked this recipe. It was so easy to prepare, and was truly the comfort food I craved at the time. The only ingredient I omitted was the cornstarch ... it didn’t seem necessary.  Will definitely add this to my rotating regulars.

The  recipe was very good and I'll make it again however, mine was not crispy even though I baked it an extra 15 min and had drizzled a little extra butter on it. I think the pieces were too close together, next time I will use a cookie sheet/jelly roll pan like I usually to for baked chicken. Also, I used garlic flavored crumbs and added garlic and salt to the sauce.

Great coating, similar to what I've done many times before.  Would experiment with more of my own seasonings and make it exciting next time. Paprika, cumin, garlic... all good options.    The sauce is just ok.  Basically mushroom soup.  May be better by sauteing  some onions & garlic and browning /burning them a bit  ahead to add to the soup to give it more of a roasted kind of flavour.   Always like to play around with these things, and will do that next time.  Crispy coating is great though.  Did it with skin removed.

Made this recipe pretty much according to directions.  I added some garlic powder and pepper and increased the cornstarch to 1 1/2 tsp.  The chicken came out crisp except for the bottom which was pasty.  But the big disappointment was the sauce..  It was bland, flavorless and was not a good flavor match for the coating.  It definitely needed some salt to begin with.  I believe this would be much better tasting with Cream of Chicken soup used as a base for the sauce.  The bottom of the thighs did not come out crispy.  It was gummy or pasty under there.  It might improve the bottom crust if these were cooked on a rack elevating from the bottom of the pan.  Another option would be to avoid coating the bottom at all.  I used boneless, skinless thighs and placed them in the pan flattened as opposed to rolled up.  They were more than done in the suggested 45 minutes - approaching 200°.  But they were still fairly moist and tender.  If you use Panko crumbs, even the seasoned ones, you might want to spice it up a bit with some salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and Parmesan cheese.  Even the seasoned variety of Panko crumbs are pretty much tasteless.  To avoid any potential for cross contamination, I set aside some of the soup/milk mix to use as sauce and used the rest for dipping the raw thighs.  I added another 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch to the sauce because it seemed too thin.

Love love love this chicken! I add extra seasoning to the soup, and sprinkle with Parmesan after I drizzle with butter. Also, I let the chicken sit in the soup mix for a few hours before baking. I use boneless, skinless thighs.

Would make it again, might just bread normal not dip in mushroom soup mix. Breading took longer than suggested to crisp up. Family like breading really crunchy. Overall taste was good and meat was very tender

Only change I made was to double the mushroom sauce. One of the best chicken thigh recipes I've tried. Easy, too

I found it to be rather bland and the mushroom soup tasted like soup not a gravy. I will not be making this again.

I've been making this for years, and my Mom used to make it as well. It's my go to weeknight dish.  Both my Mom and I prefer the skin off the chicken.   I like to season the soup with a bit of wine and/or a splash of Worcestershire if I am out of wine. It enhances the soup with more flavor, and don't forget the white pepper!  Sometimes, I put chicken broth or bullion and uncooked rice at the bottom of the baking pan, so I don't have to make a side dish, which gives me time to create a salad while the chicken cooks.  An easy-breezy weeknight meal.

Came out awesome!!! I used boneless thighs and followed directions with three exceptions: I separated the sauce into two bowls to be sure of no cross contamination and added garlic powder to the sauce. Also I used ritz crackers and herb stuffing mix(used a rolling pin to crush) as the breading.

I loved it and my husband liked it (he does not like chicken).  I used garlic powder instead of onion powder and used a mixture of Italian bread crumbs and regular ones.  Will most definitely make it again.

This is absolutely delicious and Hubby's favorite! The only thing I've done differently is to de bone the chicken, keeping the skin. Perfect to lay over rice and easily cut into :)

Used French fried onions for costing since I didn't have breadcrumbs. I also used rosemary and fresh garlic to the soup mixture since I didn't have onion powder. It smelled so good cooking! The butter made the bottom of the dish oily but the chicken still came out moist and crunchy! Served it with scalloped potatoes and green beans.

I like it.  Chicken to be fully cooked needs to be at an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, so bringing the sauce up to a BOIL, -as listed in the third paragraph-, or 212 degrees F is enough to kill any baddies like salmonella left from dipping the chicken in that sauce at the beginning of the process.  Seems to me that 212 is HIGHER than 165, so it should be enough to cook off the unwanted parasites from the uncooked chicken being in there.  Had no parsley so I added some Italian seasoning.  Baked on a rack over the pan to get rid of some fat content.

I'm sorry I was not crazy about this recipe.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the thighs did not come out crispy like I thought they would. This was very messy to make IMO. I used thighs with bone and skin on.  My husband and I ate it though I won't be making it again.

I used cream of chicken soup and added sliced mushrooms, onions, and carrots to the pan and also garlic pepper and extra butter. My husband hates baked chicken, but confessed that he really liked it cooked this way (even my picky 2 year old cleaned her plate!)

I used skinless, boneless thighs. It was very tender and the mushroom sauce went well with it. I salted and peppered the thighs and lightly coated them with flour before dipping them in the mushroom soup wash. I added herbs to the breadcrumbs instead of the wash. Just small adjustments to fit your own touch. I will make again and try on pork too.

This had gooood flavor! I followed exactly, except I seasoned with kosher salt and cracked black pepper first and I used a little more olive oil to grease the pan. I was unsure of how the breading would turn out because the crumbs got all clumpy and were too dry on the chicken. I put the raw and seasoned chicken back in the dip mixture to moisten and unclump. And followed the directions, it turned out great!

So easy and delicious! I opted out of the butter the second time I made this, because I felt the thighs were juicy on their own. I also got skinless thighs because the coating keeps the chicken moist., and also to make it healthier. I will definitely be keeping this one for easy weeknight meals.

Such a great recipe. My whole family loved it. My 9 year old son who never asks for seconds asked for seconds! Few changes: I used bone in but took the skin off the thighs andit made the crumbs hold together very nicely. For an extra crunchy (messy) coating dip in soup mix, crumbs, and repeat. I didn't use the butter to coat but it wasn't missing because I added it to the gravy mix along with a can of mushrooms, more parsley, and garlic powder. Mine stayed in about 50 minutes just to be sure and they were so tender. Yum! Yum! Yum! Forever in the favorites! Thank u

Very staightforward and easy to make for dinner. Tasty and different. I seasoned the chicken before and poured a portion of the sauce over it before coting in breadcrumbs. Will definitely try this again.

This was very good.  The family loved it.  I did change just a few minor things, and those wouldn't affect the taste at all.  I did not use any butter.  I used all gluten free ingredients.  I was worried about cross contamination as well, so I put some of the soup mixture aside before I dredged it.  This has already been requested to be made again.  Thank you!!

I try not to be critical of recipes as we all have different taste and preferences.  I cooked it exactly as written - not a single change other than using 7 thighs instead of 8.  It was soggy/mushy and the so called "sauce" was nothing more than a can of bland mushroom soup with milk.

I'm new to cooking as I've only been preping family meals for almost a year now.  This was an easy make  with simple ingredients just what I was looking for.  The family enjoyed it and would like to see it again. I got lazy on my sides though.

Four stars only because I think adding a bit of white wine into the sauce really makes the recipe, then it's definitely a five star! I think I doubled the onion powder (accidentally) and added garlic powder and Summer Savoury spice (didn't have parsley). Bit of freshly ground pepper and the sauce was super yummy. Again, the white wine gave this meal a restaurant- quality taste. The thighs I had we're quite large so 45 min at 350 didn't work for me. I'll be trying 400 for 30 to start with next time (or 375 for 45 min). Good base of a recipe, though.

Tried the recipe with my family and was a hit.  Used panko bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  Was careful about adding any more additional sodium to the recipe.  Added poultry seasoning for extra taste.  Did not add as much water/milk to keep a thick cosisteny but used a family sized can of condensed mushroom soup (low sodium).  Very easy recipe to put together.  Thank you.

This is the best chicken recipe I have ever used.  I have used ground cornflakes instead of bread crumbs, but have also used bread crumbs; I think the cornflakes add to the flavor as well.  Recommend this recipe highly!

I have never been so disappointed with a recipe. I followed the recipe to a tee but the coating was all soggy on the bottom and definitely lacked flavour. Easy-to-prepare dishes are awesome IF they are yummy.  By the way, I entertain a great deal and always get rave reviews on my cooking...so definitely not a 'beginner'.

Tweaked for what I had on hand.  Used b/s ckn breasts, blended stove-top cornbread stuffing for bread crumbs and blended sauce since my husband doesn't like the little mushroom pieces.  6 out of 6 of us give it 5 stars!!!  Thanks!

This is a simple and great recipe. The chicken was so moist! The only thing was I didn't like the flavor of the gravy. I think next time I'll try it with cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.

Everyone enjoyed this dish and I will definitely make it again.  I separated the soup mix into two separate containers as suggested by others.  I also added a dollup of sour cream, some grated parmesan and some freeze dried chives to the soup mix.  Maybe it was just me but it didn't work for me to dip the thighs in the soup mix and roll in bread crumbs.  After one dip, the crumbs were clumped together and stuck to the plate.  It worked better for me to dip the chicken with my left hand and then shake bread crumbs to cover over a plate with my right. I used both thighs with bone and skin and some boneless skinless.  We decided that we prefer the boneless skinless though both were delicious.

Thanks Twinkles - this is SO good. And easy. Perfect for my Sunday  - my husband spent the week at our cabin eating mostly sandwiches and toaster treats.  This made me look like an expert cook AND he kept telling me I shouldn't have gone to all the trouble just for him!! This is easy, mostly healthy, and easy to keep the ingredients on hand for the next Sunday night supper. This is definitely a keeper. thanks again

This recipe was fantastic, I doubled the sauce and added lipton onion soup, added fresh mushrooms to the bottom of the pan and used chicken breasts because it's all I had on hand.  I separated the sauce only used a small amount for the "dipping" and saved the rest for heating. My family loved this!!! Will make again for sure!!!!

So yummy! I would serve this to company. I used fresh parsley and added a few more mushrooms to sauce. Panko crumbs made chick extra crispy. Served it on brown rice. Cant wait to eat the left overs!

We loved this recipe. It was delicious. I did change it up a bit by adding onion soup mix to the corn flake crumbs and a little to the mushroom soup mix as well as a can of mushrooms. My husband does not care for chicken thighs but raved about this recipe and asked if we could have it again! Delicious :)

It was a hit in our house!! My husband and I loved it, and my picky eater 2 year old actually ate a good part of it. I did find that with how well the bread crumbs stuck to the soup coated chicken that I needed more like 2 cups but it was nice and crunch, and very moist! I served mine with egg noodles (my daughters favorite) and will most definitely be making this again!! The leftovers went in my husbands lunch, and that tells me he truely loved it!

Made last night.  I used skinless thighs (bone-in), marinated them for 2 hrs in fridge, then brought to room temp.  Rolled them in combo of Panko and Seasoned crumbs  - baked on a rack above my broiler pan for 1 hour 15 minutes, they were good...

The breading stayed surprisingly nice and crunchy but the mushroom sauce was only so-so flavorwise.  Maybe b/c I used a Healthy Request version of the soup, so I'll give this 4 stars instead of 3 assuming that is why the sauce lacked some flavor.  Also, it took about 20 minutes longer to cook these at 350 than stated in the recipe.

I thought this chicken was very good.  I used italian bread crumbs and didn't make the sauce to put on top.  I did have to cook the chicken longer than stated (and I use a thermometer to regulate temp) but other than that it was great.

I loved this recipe.  I didn't have onion powder, so I used garlic powder, instead.  And I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  I thought this was SO tasty.

This was GREAT!!! My spouse loved this recipe and he's not one much for soupy/gravy type stuff but he really enjoyed this and that was an accomplishment. Thank you so much for this recipe, it will definately be a keeper. :-)

This was really good.  Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Think I will try it with chicken breast though since I prefer white meat.  Still very good with the dark.

I used less milk to make the sauce for this recipe, and I had trouble getting the bread crumbs to stick.  It tasted ok to me and my husband liked it even more because he likes anything with extra sauce.

My daughter stated "Yum!" and that I could make this again. This was a very simple quick and tasty meal. I used skinless boneless thighs, and the breading came out crispy. I did add a little white wine to the sauce. NO other changes needed will be making this again.

This was really good.  My boyfriend and his friend raved over it.  I found the soup mixture a little thin so it didn't really coat the meat very well.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I will dip the thighs before adding the milk to get a thicker mushroom coating, then just add the milk when making the sauce.

The chicken turned out well. I just used tenderloins though since it was what was in my freezer. But the sauce.. it was too sweet for my boyfriend and my taste. Next time I'll just use water or even try the chicken broth idea. -- Was decent though.

This intensely bland recipe is more suited to WWII rationing days than the 21st century American palate. I did my best to salvage the sauce by adding more butter, 2 T sour cream, 1 T ketchup, and some garlic powder and paparika. It was ok, but I probably won't be making this again.

I used skinless thighs and they turned out crispy and tasty.  I added mushrooms to the sauce and put in over pasta.  The sauce was OK not as good as the chicken.

This turned out pretty good and it was easy. I took all skin off and some fat and used skim milk (1 cup)instead of canned. I forgot to add the milk to the dipping mixture, but it was still great and I think I'll do it the same way next time! I put the chicken on a cooling rack on a baking sheet to bake as suggested previously, it turned out crispy. My 1.5 yr old ate a whole thigh and he's usually picky!

I really love this recipe.  It is quick to prepare, then you just shove it in the oven.  It doesn't have a complex blend of tastes, but it's great for "Comfort Food".  I added mushrooms to the gravy and in the last few minutes, I put the oven on Broil to crisp the skin.

This recipe is great if you want to make a different flavor for your chicken. My boyfriend loved them for their different taste. If you have kids they will LOVE the all new chicken drumsticks. You can even make the white meat the same way.

Very good.  Hid the cream of mushroom soup can from my husband. What he doesn't know won't hurt him... Added some white wine, fresh chopped parsley, paprika, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper to the sauce to make it taste as if I'd slaved all day.  He loved it.  Thanks!

I love the basic recipe, but changed it a bit and it was fantastic. I used boneless, skinless thighs. Instead of bread crumbs I used crushed up corn bread stuffing (Stove Top). I needed to add a little more milk and butter than the recipe calls for, and skipped the corn starch. It was very filling. No extra carbs needed with this meal!!!!

I loved this recipe! But I used half the soup and added a little chili pepper for spice. I also flipped the chicken half way through the cooking as to no make it soggy. five minutes before the chicken was done I turned the oven to broil to crisp the breading. This recipie also works well with chicken breasts!

Delicious! Added Munster cheese on top of the chicken and poured the sauce around and over the chicken instead of doing it on the stove. So good, that even I pigged out on it (I'm usually pretty critical about my own cooking). Can't wait to make it again. Thanks for sharing. ^_^

I divided soup mix for dipping, used the prepared Italian breadcrumbs, then used skinless breasts for me & thighs for husband.  Baked it all a little longer than suggested, served with rice & asparagus/mushrooms on the side.  Husband gave it a 3.5 (he's a beef person) and I gave it a 4 for ease and overall results.

This was a good recipe, if you like cream of mushroom soup.  I should have removed the skin from the thighs first, but it had a good flavor and was really moist.  But we still took the leftovers for lunch the next day!

I just loved this recipe, so did my husband.  I cut down on the fat by using the 
low fat cream of mushroom soup and also by removing the skin from the 
chicken.  It was delicious.  The sauce was sooooooooo good.  This will be a
recipe that I will use quite often.

A wonderful chicken recipe! If I can get my mom, dad and sisters to eat mushrooms (they don't like them), this is the way to do it. My husband and kids love the chicken.

Simply delicious and very easy. I recommend this one. It's fast too. Works with cream of onion too and with boneless/skinless chicken.

My husband loves biscuits and gravy and this recipe reminded him of that.  We both loved it.
