Soup is great! I've made it a few times, but have tweaked it.  Don't need to cook barley in a separate pot.  Up the amount of Beef stock (can use vegetable stock for vegetarians) to 6 cups.  You will always need to add more.  Saute as stated, adding mushrooms, then barley. Simmer for about 45 min - 1 hr.  Saves a pot to clean & time is the same. Also vary the types of mushrooms - I've used Shitake, Cremini & Baby Bellas combined.  Comes out even more heavenly!

This soup is a good base recipe but I really feel it's overrated. As some other reviewers have noted the result has a hearty consistency but is bland. To make it special but keep it healthy I added 2/3 cup of sherry (red wine would also do nicely), two minced cloves of garlic to the onion sautee, and then minced a sprig of fresh rosemary (fresh tarragon or chopped fresh Italian parsley might also be nice). If you want a richer flavor consider using butter instead of olive oil to sautee the onions and garlic. This revised recipe would rate 4-5 stars but I can only give the original recipe 3  stars because it's just not exceptional without significant tinkering.

This soup was absolutely delicious.  I made it vegetarian by using a vegetable broth ("World's Greatest Vegetable Broth" by Tom West) instead of the beef broth.  Wonderful!

This was so so delicious.  I used a couple of different types of
mushrooms which added interest.  Looking forward to leftovers today with the soup!

Very good, but I would suggest chopping  the mushrooms. Sliced, they were, I hate to say it because it's not like they tasted bad, but they had a somewhat slimey consistency which I did not care for. I would leave everything else the same.

Nice, nice recipe. Using a previous reviewer's suggestion I didn't precook the barley but cooked it in the broth instead. I doubled the carrot, used 1# sliced criminis, used 6 cups of broth (half beef/half chicken), then added my 1 cup of barley.  I let the whole thing simmer for 45-50 minutes, adding 1 cup more of water along the way- but it could have used a bit more since the barley soaked up a lot.  The final broth flavor could have used more of a boost, so next time I'll add a couple teaspoons of the old standby - poultry seasoning. Finally, I placed some thinly sliced baby spinach in the bottom of the bowl before ladling in the soup. Gave it another layer of veggies.  Very nice overall.

thanks so much for this recipe. i love mushrooms but don't like creamy variations too often. this has a real versatility to it. i added one garlic clove and a bit of thyme and only made a half recipe.

This is a very tasty and easy soup to make. I washed but didn't cook the barley in advance and added 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the other vegetables. Note - the day after the soup really thickens - as the barley soaks up a lot of the fluids. Just add boiling water, salt and pepper when re-heating and the soup will be just as good and last a little longer!

This soup had a lot of flavor. I added one more carrot and a few more mushrooms. If you want a good soup to warm your soul and tummy on a cold winter's evening,then by all means, make this wonderful soup. It pairs very well with a good crusty bread also. Dan.

5 stars! I simmered it for a length of time and the mushrooms soaked up the beefy flavour of the broth. Deicious with ground pepper and fresh-baked rolls!

This soup is pretty good although it is not my favorite.  My family liked it.  Anxious to see how it is leftover.  I think if make this again I will probably add some more herbs and spices to give a little more flavor.

tried this for the first time and will definitely make it again for company! this was a great starter before our cheese fondue meal, and the guests requested the recipe (always a good sign!).  my mods: vegetable bouillon instead of beef stock (omitted additional salt); 2 T olive oil and 1 T butter; added 3 chopped garlic cloves.  for mushrooms i used 2 portabello and about 12 whites; i bet you could successfully use whatever sort(s) you like (have!).

Very good soup.  Cooked barley separate (i always make extra barley for other meals) and used about 3 cups of cooked barley for recipe.  I used 7 cups of water and 7 beef bouillon cubes.  Also added some fresh thyme 3 garlic cloves.  For my own bowl of soup, i added some chipolte tabasco and cracked pepper.  Yummy!

Omitted the onions since I didn't have any. Cut recipe in half and it was perfect for me to have for lunches during the week. Healthy and plenty flavorful for rainy days.

This was an excellent recipe.  I put in three carrots and used home made chicken broth instead of beef.  I made a double batch -- in one I added diced up honey smoked ham.  It was actually better than the one without.
Maybe better is wrong -- I just love ham.
I did put in, at the recommendation of another reviewer, rosemary and garlic.
Definitely have added the recipe to my make again file.

I made this recipe as stated except that I didn't use celery, because I didn't have any, and I subbed "no beef" broth to make the soup vegan. My husband and I loved it!

I scaled the recipe to 2 servings, and added more mushrooms and onion than called for.  Omitted the carrot and celery, but added some garlic powder and italian seasoning to the veggies as they sauteed & a couple splashes of worcestershire sauce to the broth.  I like the chewy texture of barley, and this is a tasty way to use some and a KEEPER recipe.

I also add cubed potato, it makes it more starchy. For extra flavor, I add  one envelope of Lipton Onion soup and 3 dry bay leaves during cooking. I also add one teaspoon sour cream into my soup bowl. And I use baby bella mushrooms.

Sometimes simple is best, and this recipe is proof of that.  I halved the recipe, following the ingredient measurements by the T, and it came out absolutely delicious.  I like the fact that it has beef flavour without actual beef, and that it is so quick to make.  Really comforting and satisfying.  I can have this as a meal, and I'm full... without the extra 10 lbs that normal comfort food would bring.  Why haven't I discovered this recipe before?!

I combined several reviewers' mods.  I added about a Tb of dried rosemary, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 cup of red wine, 5 cloves of garlic (will do 8 next time) and did the barley right in the soup instead of separately (used 6 cups of broth)

I used a combo of baby bellas and shiitakes but next time I'll try baby bellas, porcini and chanterelles.  I don't think the shiitakes added much.

I hesitated between 3 or 4 stars because of the amount of mods I made.  It's a great base and I'll definitely be making this again.

As it was noted earlier this is a great recipe for a base (I give 4 for the base, because basic instruction is so necessary to go off of for further cooking experiments!) After I sauteed the mushrooms, I added about a 1/4C of red wine and let it reduce, then added the beef broth. I then added some dried parsley and some sprigs of fresh thyme. The thyme really brings it together. I would add more broth in the future (the barley seems to keep on keepin' on soaking up liquid). If you don't like a starchy soup, don't cook the barley in the same pot!

So good but I use veg. broth instead.  I recommend mixing up the mushrooms using shataiki, black mushrooms & baby bella's.  Oyster mushrooms too.  It gives a really good earthy taste.

Pretty darn good for being converted to being made in a slow cooker.  I really enjoyed it.  The barley ended up a little glutinous so I added some more broth and water.    Good with a french loaf!  Yum!

Excellent. Consider adding 1/2 bottle of cab if tripling recipe. Also shred and add 1/2 cabbage (love cabbage in all soups) and dill.

i followed the instructions that allotted for me to cook the barley in the same pot as the other things, but for whatever reason mine turned out a little bland. i used veggie broth to make it vegetarian, so my choice of broth may have had some impact. i think next time i will add corn and maybe experiment with some more seasonings...

This was great! I made a few adjustments....put my carrots and onion through the grate blade on my food processor.....sauteed in a little olive oil with the celery and 3 cloves of minced garlic.....I used sliced white mushrooms and used 6c. of home made veggie stock from this site...A must!!! The veggie stock really makes this soup. I also cooked the barley in my soup and added a little extra water as needed to the soup. Served for lunch yesterday and today.....great tasting and very healthy!

This was great.  I added more carrots and also only added one package of mushrooms.  I also added 1 clove of minced garlic and 2 more cups of beef broth.  Excellent and even better the next day!

Very good but I added fresh dill parsley and thyme it took the recipe to a higher level. I also blended 3/4 of my vegetables after they simmered and before I added the barley for a thick consistency

Like others, I made the following changes: 1) added 2 bay leaves and 3 cloves garlic, 2) cooked veggies and barley in the same pot at the same time 3) increased beef broth to 8 C and added 2 C water 4) doubled celery and carrots.  The result was a warm filling soup that was rather bland. It needs something else - maybe a can of tomatoes, or some spices, or some sherry. I am going to play around with the leftovers and see what I can come up with.

Good, alreay knew not to expect a "spicy" soup so added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, an extra carrot, 2 types of mushrooms and it was nice, subtle, comforting, filling change.

Not quite sure about this one. Was easy to make. It tasted a bit oily to me and I didn't over do the olive oil, I think its the beef broth. I cut up the mushrooms a bit finer than sliced and that came out well. The soup seems to lack seasoning - I added salt and pepper but it was still a bit bland. I'm not a very experienced cook, so was not sure what other seasoning would improve the recipe. Not sure I'll make this again...maybe it will taste better when its sat for a while?

Like another reviewer, I turn this into a slow cooker recipe although I do sauté the veggies before putting them into the cooker which will have been cooking the barley for a while.   I substitute a little chicken bouillon for salt and use a mix of different types of mushrooms.  In our area they do packs of mixed exotic mushrooms which when added to some crimini are great.  This is the type of recipe which is totally flexible.  You can change the amount and proportions of the ingredients and add spicing with impunity and it still comes out great.

Use standard sized packaging of broth and shrooms and 1.5 onions to adjust.  Added another  carrot, a clove of garlic, a handful of kidney beans, 1/4 cup of red wine and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce.

It is very bland.  I added red wine, Mrs. Dash, more garlic etc. and it just doesn't have any flavor to it.  The rest is going to be thrown away  and I won't make it again.

As suggested, I added an extra cup of broth and some minced garlic . I used  vegetable broth cause it was lent, but would use beef broth next time. Mixed white and baby portobellos. Drizzle a little cream when serving or a little shake of parm. Yummy!

Great recipe! I didn't use the celery, and I cut my own mushrooms, it came out delicious. I Don't see why one would need salt and pepper if you have the beef broth in there, it was perfectly fine without it.

I do a variation of this recipe I grate the  carrots and I add shredded potatoes to the broth. I also use mushrooms from Poland that are dry and I boil them for about a half an hour and then add that as part of my stock. Remove some of the broth whisk in  some sour cream and then re-add to the soup and I guarantee you will love this rendition of the mushroom barley soup.

I turned it into a vegan soup by using veggie stock only and instead of precooking the barley, I toasted it with the veggies after they sauteed and then just added the stock.  i put a couple of teaspoons of herbs de provence, as well with the sauteeing veggies.  Added a 1/2 c of red wine for the simmer.  Delicious!!!

I used Pacific Foods Mushroom Broth for a vegetarian version, vegetable broth works, too. Add "meaty" flavor with 1 tsp worcestershire sauce. I used small can of tomato sauce instead of past - worked fine. This is a thick and delicious soup.

The flavors were solidly good, but nothing that would blow your mind...but the dish was incredibly easy for the above average results.

We enjoyed this recipe, but like other reviewers I changed a few things. I doubled (at least) the carrots and celery.  Then I added 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1 bay leaf, and a pinch of poultry seasoning.  I did not precook the barley, but cooked it in the same pot and ended up using about 8 cups of chicken stock during the hour I simmered it.   I will definitely make it again soon.

It was OK. I expected a bit more. I made some modifications such as more spices (garlic, red pepper flakes, fresh parsley) as per others' suggestions. But it just didn't have the "heartiness" that I was looking for.

This soup was pretty darn good. I made it how one of the reviewers suggested; simmering the barley in more broth, and adding more later when all the veggies were in. I added some zuchinni and, though it was squishy and overcooked, it was still delightful. I'll be making this again, but I think I'll use chicken stock instead of beef-- it was a bit too beefy for me

I liked how easy it was.  It was bland so had to add some seasoning to hit.

This was Excellent.  I mixed some baby bella mushrooms in with the regular mushrooms. I served this with a Pan Roasted Duck. Took the left over Duck meat and soup and mixed together, next weekend we had Mushroom Duck soup. Chicken would work just as well.

I love this soup recipe. It was so easy to make, healthy and delicious. My 2 year old daughter loved it as well. I do think next time i will use a variety of mushrooms and roughly chop them. As well as cut the amount of barley in half, i prefer my soups with more broth. I froze half of the soup because it made so much. Delicious! Thanks for this addition to my rotation.
