My husband and I have ordered these at different restaurants and loved them, so I tried this recipe. Very good! I used frozen green beans (thawed) from this summers garden and I didn't use the toothpicks. I also added cayenne.  I made a dip from mayo, spiced mustard, cayenne, salt, pepper and garlic powder (all to taste). Delicious!

These were very yummy and I'm not much a green bean fan.  I didn't have any buttermilk and just used the 1% milk I had in the fridge.  I bet they are even better with buttermilk.  We will definitely have these again.

These are addictive!  A huge hit as an appetizer for Thanksgiving Day to keep hungry kids not so famished as the turkey was cooking.  The batter could be improved and would allow for personal preferences of spices.

I added cayenne to the batter for an extra kick.  My hubby loved these, but I found them too heavy.  If you like breaded and fried veggies, you'll probably like these!

I served this as a side to filipino lumpias and rice. My mom and I really liked them & Dad & husband thought they were above average.  Next time I will try repeating the dipping process to try and get a better coat.

Used the concept of the recipe and put my own twist on it.  Didn't measure (just threw the ingredients in the bowls) and added curry powder to the flour to give it a zing.  The family loved it.

WONDERFUL!  These were the best!  My husband and kids couldn't get enough. Really if I could give these 10 stars I would! Better than french fries and way better for you.

I only made an adjustment due to my  diet,
I used two and a half teaspoon's  salt. I grow my 
own veg's. The bean's are kind of long, so I
Skewered them in the middle. And like another
review,I double dip!! Perfect!!!! Oh yea! I added
a little baking powder.

These were really good!  My husband and I couldn't get enough!  I'm giving one star less because it was messy and my kids didn't like them.

These were messy to make and the coating didn't stay on so good.  I ended up with a lot of burned coating in the oil which gave some of the beans a burnt/ashy taste.  They weren't horrible tasting just not great and too much work.

These were OK. The coating was light on the beans. I like a nice crunchy coating, so I dipped the beans in the buttermilk and flour and then back into the buttermilk and flour. This gave it a nice crunchy coating. I also added breadcrumbs to the flour mixture and just used seasoned salt.

These are so delicious! My husband made them (exactly to recipe) in the Fry Daddy, and they turned out just as good as the ones we had in a local restaurant.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Went looking for a recipe for these after having them at Applebee's (they are SOOOOO good!)
They didn't quite turn out as good, a little more soggy. I was told that the oil wasn't hot enough. I did it in a pot as I don't have a deep fryer.  It started out hot enough, but if you keep adding and don't let it heat back up it apparently cools down, so watch your oil temp!

Awesome recipe! I love fried green beans and these tasted better than the ones I get at TGI Fridays and PF Chang's! I did add a 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 tsp smoked paprika to the mix. Definitely will make these again!

The recipe came out perfect and I used whole milk, since I didn't have buttermilk. I also added cayenne pepper for some zest. I'm going to try them with the dip another reviewer mentioned. Yummmyyy...I love green beans!!

Made it for the super bowl party and went over great.  Ended up getting them to start serving them at a local establishment.
