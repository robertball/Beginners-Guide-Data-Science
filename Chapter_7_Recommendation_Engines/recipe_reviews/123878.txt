Made this on a very chilly, dreary, wet, blustery fall day here in Austria and it was just the right thing for dinner!  Very tasty!  Surprisingly I had most of the ingredients at home (including the cooked chicken from another meal that froze to use another day) but had to sub a few other things.  I didn't add celery (because I didn't have it) but I added chopped fresh zucchini and red bell pepper (because I had it them in the fridge and they needed to be used!). I also used skim milk instead of half-n-half.  Came out great!  I chopped the fried bacon up into small bacon bits (in my Moulinette chopper) and added it back into the soup. This was a big hit with everyone today!   Thanks!  I plan on making this again as the recipe's written; I can imagine it's good with celery and half-n-half.

This was delicious!  A great meal for a chilly day.  The first time I made it I used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken.  The second time I planned to do the same thing and found that Campbell's now has Cream of Chicken and Mushroom, so I used two cans of that.

Delicious!  The whole family enjoyed this very much.  I used evaporated skim milk for the cream. Unfortunately, I got carried away and added too much broth/milk, making it a little thin so I thickened it with instant potato flakes. Thanks!

This was a very tasty soup that my whole family gobbled up. I absolutely did not add any additional salt since I felt that the bacon and broth provided all the saltiness needed. I also added a bit more chicken broth in order to cover the vegetables better while they cooked. Great hearty soup on a cold winter day - be sure to have some crusty bread on the side to go with it!

This soup is amazing! I used Turkey Bacon and about 1 1/2 more chicken than the recipe called for. This recipe is definitely something I will be making again! Thanks!

Hands down, the best chowder ever! It even tastes better the next day! I only made minor tweaks: skipped the salt, substituted skim milk for the half and half and used cream of chicken (not mushroom) soup. It's a bit labor intensive prep-wise, but sooooo worth it. My boyfriend could not stop raving about it and he never had chowder before! :) I'm definitely keeping this recipe.

This is WONDERFUL! I did have to add more broth to cover the veggies - I acually had to double it. Other than the broth and adjusting the salt/pepper to my family's taste I left recipe as is and it was FANTASTIC! Will be making regularly!

This was pretty good! I omitted the carrots, because I know my family wont eat them. I did grind up the bacon and added while simmering. I also suggest topping soup with shredded cheese

Loved this recipe, although I would make a few minor changes the next time.  I would reduce the salt (used less then called for and still too salty).  I would also use less celery or leave it out altogether (not a celery fan). Also would make sure to crumble bacon (used turkey bacon) smaller next time as my piece were a bit big.  It was delicious though!! Will become one of my favorite recipes!

This recipe was okay.  My husband and I both felt that it was way too salty.  This might have been because of the bacon or because I used canned chicken.

I made this with turkey bacon, using a bit of vegetable oil to saute the onions and celery since turkey bacon is greaseless.  It was yummy.

Mmmmm. Yummy. I used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom. Left out the salt because I was using chicken boullion and water for the broth(salty enough). Also decreased the celery. Tastes similar to chicken wild rice soup. Very good and hearty meal. Served with buttered bread.
Update: I found a product from Minute Rice, it's 2 individual cups of brown/wild rice that you pop in the microwave for a minute. I added a spoonful to my bowl of leftovers and it was pretty good.

FANTASTIC!!!!  I had my mom and brother over for dinner, and served this soup with panini sandwiches.  Everyone ate up all the soup and wrapped up the sandwiches for later!  VERY filling.  I would recommend serving with rolls and salad, as this soup qualifies as the main attraction.  I used a large can of cream of chicken soup as my family is not a fan of mushroom soup.  I will definitely make this again!

this is good I will make it again, however I will eliminate the salt. there is so much salt in the bacon and in the cream of mushroom soup it doesn't need any additional. I also increased the black pepper a bit and used 2% milk instead of half and half.

Very good comfort food.  Tasty and filling.  After reading other reviews, I also decided to veto the salt.  Very glad I did as it was more than salty enough.  Next time I make this I'll use reduced sodium chicken broth, and reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup.  Should be perfect then :)

I loved this soup, my husband helped me make it (he normally doesnt cook) and I have never made a soup from scratch. I followed it except I used Half broth half stock it was great topped it with cheese and served it with sourdough bread, it was even better then next day and to add some substance for leftovers I added 2 cups of rice.

I made this last night for my husband, who doesn't like soup, and my 2 kids. Everyone Loved it! My husband had seconds and took leftovers to work for lunch. It will definitely become a family favorite. 
I forgot the carrots at the store, so it was prepared without them, but it didn't seem to matter. No one left hungry.

Pretty darn good! Made it twice (as I usually do) and second time used chopped mushrooms and added more chicken broth instead of the second can of mushroom soup to cut the calories.  I also cut the half and half and used corn starch and cooked rice to thicken it up.

Excellent recipe! I substituted Cream of Chicken (98% fat-free) soup for the mushroom soup, added a few leaves of home-grown thyme and marjoram, and used fat-free half & half. Will definitely add this to my personal recipe stash. TFS!

This was very good on a cold wet night! I added a can of creamed corn, a chopped pasilla pepper, and only 1 cup of half and half. The leftovers only lasted a half day.

This was a very good basic recipe.  I used it as a base, but made several changes to it.  I added 1 cup corn as well as a diced green pepper to the veggies.  I also used stock instead of broth to make it heartier, and doubled the amount of it.  I let the veffies simmer for 35 minutes instead of 20 and then used an immersion blender to puree it a little bit and thicken it up.  Because it was so thick, I skipped the cream altogether, and only added 1 can of mushroom soup.  With a little pepper added before serving, it was great!
