Either I got this entirely wrong (which is possible, I'm notorious for botching seemingly easy dessert recipes), or the "mousse" is slightly misleading. This wasn't the consistency of a mousse, it was more like a heavy, eggy frosting that kept oozing out of the chocolate crust. It tasted fine- very rich, but felt like I had eaten a stick of butter. Blech.

This is a good recipe for mousse but you absolutely must use unsalted butter. All desert recipes assume that you will use unsalted, but for most of them it makes little difference. In a recipe like this one, the difference is huge. With unsalted it is rich and delicious. With salted it is like just eating a cube of butter.    This is not a light, fluffy kind of mousse, but a rich and dense one. It makes an excellent filling for cakes, using either white or brown chocolate. And if you whip it for a very long time, it will be solid and crumbly when chilled

I agree with other reviews, this is a waste of time and ingredients. the moose is too soft to be used in a springform pan. It would be impossible to cut. Not to waste the filling I turned it into a trifle. I am a experienced baker and have catered many events. Giving this one star was one too many.
