Loved it!  Served it to my coffee club ladies and they loved it too.  I added about an eighth cup of Orange Curacao (liquor) to the filling for taste but changed nothing else.  I should have sunk the chocolate chips for a prettier pie but other than that it was perfect.  The crust is easy and flakey, the filling not sweet but light and would go perfect with a dessert wine or cup of coffee or tea. Having the leftover pie with my morning coffee.  Yum! Doesn't take 4 hours! It takes the same amount of time that it takes to make any pie.

Appearance was fine, cooking instructions were fine, but I didn't think this had much flavor.

We loved this.  A wonderful dessert.  I added a bit more sugar, because we do like it a bit sweeter and it worked out great.  Also, I noticed a few other recipes called to drain the ricotta for a while before using.  I did this and came away with about a cup of water. The only thing I would do differently is to add some Amaretto for a different twist.  I did not precook the crust, just chilled it after rolling it and poking.  It was fine, just took quite a bit longer to bake.  The 160 internal temp was the perfect time to take out the pie.  Thanks for another hit, Chef John!

If you are looking for a NOT sweet dessert, this is perfect.  I did do variations.  I purchased a pre-made pie crust from Sprouts Market, so I reduced the recipe to make 6 servings of the ricotta filling.  Instead of water, I squeezed in juice from the the orange I zested.  I did not use lemon (I didn't want the sourness).  I did add mini chips, and sunk them as chef j suggested.  I used 2 tablespoons of sugar.    I topped the pie with sliced almonds--tasted and looked great!   They toasted while on the pie in the oven.  The next time I do this, I will not pre-bake my crust.  The crust will be store bought;  I'm not motivated to make my own pie crust.

The crust turned out like pizza dough. So I ended up using store bought crust. The filling was less than a crowd pleaser. I added triple the amount of sugar. Even my kids wouldn't eat it. I waited 10 days to make this pie... What a disappointment.
