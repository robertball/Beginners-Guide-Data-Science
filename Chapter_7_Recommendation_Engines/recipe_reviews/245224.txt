These are awesome cookies! I used 1/2 Becel and 1/2 butter as I didn't have the full amount, 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 Robin Hood Omega 3 Whole Wheat and Flax flour, added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice and bumped the vanilla up to 1 tbsp. I used my large cookie scoop that made 24 cookies which baked in 18 minutes. I used 2 Empire apples which I would dice finer if making smaller cookies, I also blotted them dry before adding. I skipped the drizzle as I had no white chips, I think cinnamon chips would be a good addition.
The second time I made them with a loosely packed cup of cut up dried apples, used scant 2 cups of flour,  #50 scoop yielded 40 cookies which baked in 10 to 11 minutes. My cookies never flattened out, I used a fork when I turned the trays halfway through baking.

BecelÂ® had a sample table at my grocery store featuring these cookies. I'm glad I saw this Recipe of the Day on AR because I was going to go online and look for the recipe myself. They are SO GOOD! The oatmeal and the little bits of soft apple are really nice. The cookies are lovely and soft.
