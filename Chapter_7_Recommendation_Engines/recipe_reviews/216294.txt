Made this as the recipe stated, only used 1/2 the spinach though.  My family loves it!  They ask for it all the time.  The tomatoes are a different taste, but we really like it.  Even my 10 year old loves it and she doesn't like the tomatoes or the spinach, but all together it's a big hit!

Sorry, but this was not a hit in our house (made recipes as listed)....if and I say if I attempted this again I would use half or less the amount of spinach and would be more inclined to use real tomatoes

After reading other reviews saying it was bland, I marinated my cubed chicken in olive oil, garlic and cayanne pepper spice for a few hours before cooking.  I also omitted the 1/2 cup of water to make for a thicker sauce and added mushrooms.  My husband liked the extra kick from the marinated chicken.

This was very easy to make. I will try it again with fewer tomatoes only because I am not a tomato fan.

This was just okay.  I made it as directed, but it seemed to be missing something; the flavor was not very strong.  If I were to make this again, I would try adding some additional herbs and/or spices.

I thought that this was great, but I did adjust a few things from other reviewers.  I sauteed my chicken in Flavor Boost from Swanson (I also use Knorr brand).  When chicken is almost finished I added some onion and the extra garlic than what was called for.  I sauteed for a few minutes then added the rest of the ingredients.  I added jarred pesto to the mix since there were several reviewers that said it was bland. I added a little more cooking liquid to get the sauce to the consistency I liked. 

Note to cooks: you can taste the sauce before you are finished and add extra ingredients to your liking.  The creator of the recipe might not like over powering flavors.  Be creative and every recipe will end up being a "keeper". Thank you Campbell's Kitchen

Great! Changed it up just a little bit, like all people, but one of the very best dishes I've ever had.

This was okay. Not sure why but the flavor was just off for me. I added some extra garlic and minced onions. Also used Parm cheese instead of Asiago since that's what I had on hand, oh and I doubled the sauce.

This recipe was awesome and a huge hit at dinner. After reading some of the reviews I made a few changes, I cut the spinach in half and roughly chopped it and added fresh diced tomatoes in lieu of the sun dried tomatoes to the grilled chicken and it turned out wonderful.

This is a good, easy pasta dish.  It was a bit bland for my family's taste.  I doubled the red pepper flakes and added 1/2 tsp oregano plus 1/4 tsp basil.  Still not quite a five star, but getting closer. :)

I was a bit skeptical at first but turns out my whole family liked it.  I marinated the chicken w olive oil, garlic n cayenne pepper as another reader suggested.  I also added a can of stewed tomatoes.  Delicious!!

I made this tonight and it was a huge hit. How could it miss with Asiago cheese! I kept everything the same except the tomatoes. I used a can of spicy diced. They also had a can with onions and garlic that would have been good also. Fusilli pasta was expensive so I used regular spiral and chicken strips rather than breasts just because I had them..... very very good! Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I liked this, and it was easy enough for him to help!  We will play around with substituting Parmesan cheese for the Asiago and mushrooms for the sun-dried tomatoes (personal preference).
