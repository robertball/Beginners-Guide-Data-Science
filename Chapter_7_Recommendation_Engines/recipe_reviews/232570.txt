Surprisingly, it wasn't as salty as I thought it would be.  I used the Garlic Chicken Vermicelli mix from Rice A Roni.  Added a bit of onion, just because I had it.  Could easily be spiced up with some salsa and cheese, or have some frozen vegetables added to do a one pot meal.  Kids really liked it with a sprinkle of cheese--we adults used some crumbled feta.  This won't be used often, but will be kept for our 'two days before payday' meal.  Simple and filling!

This is the first meal my husband prepared for me 28 years ago. In addition to the beef rice-a-roni and hamburger he added two cans of drained but seasoned black-eyed peas to the pot. It makes an easy but filling weekend dinner.

This comes together so easily and begs for tweaks if you are so inclined.  It is perfectly yummy on its own as is but I have made it a second time now adding in small peas and scallions.  A childhood fav for my hubby, he was looking for the plate with the bread and butter cut in half like his mom use to make.. This is a tasty  and comforting dish that you can have on the table with very few ingredients.

Nice! Had to use just plain rice, and made my own "seasoning mix" (salt, pepper, garlic, Italian seasoning, etc.). Turned out good using 3 cups my water and about 8 oz of white rice.

My husband and I loved this recipe. We left out the rice seasoning and added a can of beans and some taco seasoning. Great recipe for when there's not much to work with in the house.

Love this recipe...perfect for lunches for the week!  I just salt and peppered the beef and added an extra half cup of water because my stovetop cooks fast.

Very easy to make.  I had to add 1/2 c more water so 2 1/2 cups total.  I added a little pepper and salt to the hamburger and it was totally done after 20 minutes of simmering.  30 mins would have been to long.

Just made this last night as a last minute dinner.... BF loved it.... Quick and simple! 
I altered 2 things 
1. I seasoned my ground beef with salt and pepper. 
2. Added just a splash more water depending on the fat content of your meat. (2 1/4 cups instead of 2). The rice a roni box called for 2 1/2 cups of water.

My parents made this a lot when I was a kid.  They always added a can of peas to it and we ate it with bread and butter also.  I still make it without the peas mixed in (peas on the side due to picky eaters)and sometimes add green chilies and salsa with cheese and sour cream on top.  I also make the chicken rice a roni with chunks of b/s chicken breast.  It is so versatile, it would be great for a beginner cook to make and add to their taste!!!  Great comfort food!!

Good, simple food.  Worked in a pinch when I didnt have much in the house. I reduced the time to 20 minutes and it was definitely done, so i would probably add more water next time if I did this again.
