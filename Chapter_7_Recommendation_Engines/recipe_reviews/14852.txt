I added significantly more liquid smoke and about four slices of cooked, crumbled bacon; with these additions I love it.  My honey loves this as a spread on crackers.  It's much better if you let it refrigerate overnight, so think about making it the day before you want to serve it.

Easy, cheap to make, and great on crackers - what more could you ask for from a little cheese spread!  I cut the recipe in half (used light cheeses) added more liquid smoke a bit at a time to taste, and some crumbled bacon bits.  I brought this to a family reunion and it went in no time at all.  I would definitely make this again!

I thought this recipe was just ok.  I didn't really taste the smoky flavor.  The Cream Cheese and Ham Spread recipe had a stronger flavor.  I may try combining these two recipes.

I made this recipe as a first time "cheese baller" for a Christmas luncheon at work. I added 4-5 slices (chopped)of my favorite ham to the mix and it was a hit.

Took other reviewers' advise and doubled the liquid smoke.  I used this spread on tomato wraps with sliced ham to make mini spriral sandwiches.  Will surely make again, maybe in a cheese ball rolled in walnuts.

I agree with the others. You've gotta add more liquid smoke. I also mixed in bacon bits.

This was ok. I doubled the amount of cheddar and smoke flavoring, but it was still lacking flavor so I topped it with Tapatio hot sauce and it was much better. Probably won't make this again.

Made for the hunters this weekend.  Smoked anything is their favorite! I also added a bit more smoke flavoring and some bacon bits.  It will be gone by the end of the weekend!
