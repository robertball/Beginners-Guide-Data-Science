Growing up during WWII, we ate a lot of organ meat because it wasn't rationed. Tripe, kidneys,pig tails, ears, heart and liver were staples.  Several times we had brains.   To this day I fix most of the above because I like them, except for brains.    I tried this recipe last week.  Cooked it exactly as shown and was rewarded with an outstanding meal, one that I would served to friends, providing they did not ask "what is this?   The texture of the baked brains was very light and worked well with a bed of mushroom rice.  Will add this to my monthly menu. Would eat it more often but it is not very healthy.

FABULOUS!  My family couldn't get enough - I had to double the recipe.  My hubby put the leftovers into an omelet the next morning.  I'm calling my butcher tomorrow and ordering more brains.  Nummy nummy - thanks for the recipe!!!

Wonderful recipe! I don't eat brain often, but this is a good way to go when I do!
