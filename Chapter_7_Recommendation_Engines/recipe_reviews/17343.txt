I have used this recipe for years. One of my favorite ways is to use orange marmalade instead of apricot preserves. I add green and red peppers cut in strips and a can of chunk pineapple. Pour over chicken or pork in bake. I serve this over seasoned white rice.

Different and Delicious! I made this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and served over white rice. Thanks for the post :)

Hubby LOVED IT, and i liked it a lot better than with cranberry sauce.  i only used half a packet onion soup, 1/2 cup apricot/pinnapple preserves, and 1/2 cup russian dressing with 2 huge bone in chicken legs and thighs

Very moist and mildly sweet chicken.  I will make it again.  I marinated it over night in the sauce and made extra sauce to pour over the chicken.  I used a russian dressing from this site, which was excellent.  I'd suggest adding garlic and onions.  Must try chicken.

I've been making this dish for over 20 years!  It's always great although now I make my own catalina-style salad dressing and onion soup mix.  1 cup apricot preserves is about a 10-ounce jar...but if you use 12 ounces, that's OK too!  Although I prefer to bake this in the oven, the crockpot works well especially if you use very lean skinless, boneless thighs.

This is a great glaze. I cooked the meat on the grill and I've made it twice. Once with chicken and once with pork. I loved it as a glaze on Pork.My husband is diabetic so I used sugar free apricot jam and it was still great! My 3 year old ate every bit of meat on her plate.

We used the glaze on a 3.5lb boneless pork loin roast.  I baked the roast at 325 for 1 1/2 hours, basted, then baked until it reached 160 degrees.  I let it rest for 10 minutes. Delicious! Thank you!

This could not be easier! I used 3 b/s chicken breasts instead. I used a whole jar of the jelly (6oz), and baked it at 350 for 45 minutes.  Great with rice (making it this way you end up with a bunch of sauce :)  Thanks for the recipe.

This was tasty. I used thighs instead of a whole chicken since that is what I had on hand. I only used 1/2 a pack of the onion soup mix and kind of wished I would have just left it out. Threw the flavor off for me, but I really enjoyed the dressing with the preserves in it. Will probably make this again minus the onion soup mix. Maybe just some thin sliced onions would be better. Thanks for the recipe!

I made the preserves (Dried Apricot Preserves, from this site), the dressing (Chilled Russian Salad Dressing, from this site) and the dry onion soup mix...all the components themselves were great, but when I married them together I wasn't quite as happy with the result. I think next time I'm going to mix the 3 glaze ingredients and then refrigerate them overnight. Then marinate the chicken for a couple hours and bake it, to see if it changes the results. Thanks marte for sharing your recipe.

This was delicious! I marinated the chicken with half the sauce for about 4 hours before I cooked it. Everything else was followed to a T. It was awesome!

This is very easy  I used chicken breast and all I had was cherry jam . Was very good I believe the jelly sweetens the sauce to cut the tangy of barbecue sauce.  Since I only had two chicken breasts I should have used only half  package of onion soup mix.  Will make this again

Excellent!  I doubled the sauce and froze half of it for another night.  My husband raved about the sauce!  Can't wait to try this on pork too.  I did add a can of chunk pineapple as another reviewer suggested.  I may do crushed at some point, although the pineapple chunks were very yummy too!

This has been one of my GO TO recipes for years. It's easy, quick & tasty. I usually serve it over long grain & wild rice and add sliced scallions on top.
