While this cake certainly had it's good points, overall I was a little disappointed.
The flavor was certainly delicate, and would have appreciated a stronger lime taste.  Maybe next time I will double the amount of lime zest I put in.

The glaze was delicious, but I think I would also double the amount of glaze to make the cake more flavorful overall.

As per other reviews, the cake was actually ready after about 75 minutes.  It was a little dry I felt also.  Sour cream as a replacement for milk may remedy this.  I think I will try again and make some alterations as the cake does have potential.

I made this cake for my grandaughter's 18th birthday. She wanted a mexican meal and this cake was perfect for dessert. My daughter-in-law said this cake was refreshing. It is a pound cake with a light but distinguished flavor. It is added to my recipe box, a definate keeper.

My boyfriend really enjoys key lime pies, so I put this together for him.  Great recipe!  Reminds me of my grandmother's pound cake, but with a key lime zing.  He loved it!

I have been using this recipe for years and it's really one of the best ever.  I bake and decorate cakes and the basic recipe (without the lime juice or zest) is my standard vanilla cake.  It's perfect for all types of pans, carves easily and stacks well.  It's versatile and can be altered to all sorts of flavors.  That said, there are a few key points that I'd like to make.  One is that when you cream the shortening, butter and sugar together it takes at least 5 minutes.  Light and fluffy doesn't happen quickly.  The beating incorporates air into the mix and that's what gives you a moist and tender cake.  Turn the mixer on medium (4 on a Kitchen Aid) and walk away, clean up, mix your dry ingredients, whatever.  Two is mixing according to the recipe, dry ingredients and then liquid, beginning and ending with dry.  Beat at medium-low speed (3 on a KA) for about 40 seconds in between, and be sure to scrape down the bowl at least once.  Third, you don't have to stir the juices and zests in at the end, you can just mix them into your milk after you measure the milk.  The juices added to the milk will make the milk curdle and get thick (like buttermilk) and this is fine.  Lastly, bake your cake at 325F with the oven rack in the center position and 65 minutes is the maximum.  If your cake isn't done then you need to get an oven thermometer and test your oven.  Hope this helps.

Great cake.  The only change I made was to drizzle it with coconut syrup after adding the lime glaze.  The coconut syrup really brings it together.  Baked in a tube pan, drizzled with the syrup, and garnished with lime it makes a beautiful and tasty cake :)

Wonderful flavor.  Baked at 325f. and the cake tested done in 1 hour and 15 minutes instead of the recommended 90 minutes.  A bit n the dry side.

It needs more key lime juice. Probably a 1/4 cup should do the trick and maybe using real rum as well or a rum extract and not "flavoring" should kick it up a bit.

My family loved this cake. I like tart flavors so I added more lime juice to both the cake batter and the glaze. WONDERFUL summertime cake.

I love the looks of this cake, I love the taste of the batter, and love the taste of the glaze. I posted two pictures. One of the cake with the glaze, prepared and baked exactly as instructed. The only thing I changed was to use regular limes instead of key limes. The second picture is after I added my own frosting because I decided it looked to bland and may have tasted too dry without some sort of frosting. I used 2 Tablespoons of softened butter creamed into 1 cup of confectioners sugar and then added the zest of one small regular lime along with 1 Tablespoon of rum and the juice of that same lime. I added 1 tsp of vanilla also. I then drizzled it over the cake. It looks prettier and should add to the moisture. We ate it, it was delicate, and delicious. Not dry at all. Everyone else loved it, I liked it but would have liked a little more lime flavor. Next time I will try adding a teaspoon of lemon extract, to give more flavor. It is a good recipe though, and would be great if leftovers are cubed and layered with lemon curd or pudding in a trifle. I will certainly make this again. If you like poundcake, this is a good one.

Brilliant! My husband made a request of a key lime cake for his birthday. I'd never heard of such a thing so we went looking and found this recipe. It is obscenely good! Based on other reviews I doubled the zest that goes in the cake and doubled the glaze. Terrific! There is also another reviewer that emphasized taking time to cream the butter/sugar properly. I attribute the marvelous texture to that reminder to be patient. Also, I took it out to check at 65 minutes, but it was a tiny bit wet still, after 70 minutes it was perfect. Another 5 minutes would certainly have killed it, so I don't think it's wise to cook it as long as it calls for.

This was a hit at my after Thanksgiving party.  It was a last minute decision to make the cake because I had key limes to use.  My only complaint was that the time given was too long and the cake burned slightly on the top.  I probably will make it again.  Thanks!

great cake -- moist and tender!  I left out the lime zest, added a little less rum and a little more key lime juice to both the cake and the glaze and we loved it!

Cake turned out great!  I made a few edits. A little more key lime juice and more Bacardi Rum!  But everything was great!

This was delicious! However, my cake didn’t need 90 minutes. It was done after about an hour.

Having created my own Key Lime Cake I wanted to see how it fared with others. This is a very good pound cake recipe. It was somewhat on the dryer side than I like. The flavor is not substantial enough and itwas dense but not moist enough for me. The glaze was too tart and not sweet enough.
