This was a very tasty recipe.  I substitued garlic powder for the onion powder.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  It was easy to make and very good.  Only problem was that I had to cook them longer to get the mushroom caps softer.  I ended up putting a little water in the bottom of the pan and covered it with foil; then baked another 10 minutes.  I would definitely make them again.

These were ok.   I was looking for a recipe to use up a bag of imitation crab.   If you make these, think about a way to punch it up, hot sauce or parm might help.
