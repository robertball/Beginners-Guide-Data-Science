Bravo, Linda - this recipe produces the PERFECT snickerdoodle cookie (...and I KNOW a good snickerdoodle when I taste it!).  For those who said it's not soft enough, there are 3 things I know of that can cause that: baking them too long, using butter instead of shortening, storing them improperly.  Don't expect these to brown before you take them out of the oven - if they're brown, you overcooked them. And as odd as it may sound, butter-flavored Crisco actually works better than real butter in many cookie and pastry recipes.  To store these, place them in an airtight container or ziploc bag with a slice of soft white bread; the bread will turn hard, but the cookies will stay soft.  Just make sure you remove the hard bread and add a fresh slice each day (good luck - these cookies only last HOURS in my house!).  Thanks again, Linda!

These are absolutely fabulous!  The first time I tried them, I used butter, and they good, but they just seemed to be lacking something, and the color was very pale. The second time around, I used butter flavored shortening, and they were incredible! The butter flavored shortening seemed to make them chewier, and it gave them a very pretty buttery color that was a lot more appetizing.

I had high hopes for these after reading the reviews.  They puffed up in the oven in the first five minutes, but by the time I took them out at 9 minutes,they came out totally flat.  I followed the recipe exactly.  And after the first batch was flat, I chilled the remaining dough, hoping that would help.  Nope..made no diference.  Any suggestions?

First off, on the bad reviews for this particular recipe..one of the worst things you can do is use cheap products. This will cause taste variations and cooking consequences to turn out bad. I will give some advice...do not bake them for 9 minutes. Try them for 6 or 7 minutes. This will leave them soft and chewy. If your cookie dough is coming out like clay then try some variations like cutting down some of the flour. If it is pastey, add a tsp of milk. I myself had no problems with this recipe and found it to be very very good. Thank you so much for such a wonderful cookie.. It was excellent and we ate them up.

I grew up on snickerdoodles and now they are my childrens favorites!
 This is the best recipe for them on this site!
 Please do not choose a snickerdoodle recipe using butter....it doesn't compare to the taste of the crisco ones...not even the same cookie!!!

Perfect little pillows of sweet, cinnamon-y, melt-in-your mouth Snickerdoodle.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla just cuz, and baked them only until set, not "slightly brown" around the edges.  This, I believe, is critical to the desired soft and tender result.

These are sooo good! I make them all the time and what's good is the batter doesn't stick to your hands when you're rolling them , and they're really quick since you don't need to put them in the refrigerator. I definitely recommend this recipe!

My mom used to make these for us every Christmas.  We would eat them up before she had a chance to...and they were her favorites too.  I had lost my recipe for these and am really glad that someone else posted....Thanks.

These are a new family favorite.  Everyone that tastes one loves them.  They are perfect for any event or just for family.  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  They are fast and easy.  Your group will not be disappointed.  Since I found this recipe, I have made these at least 6 times.  Just awesome.

Very simple. And very yummy. This recipe easily makes more than 3 dozen - they weren't tiny and i made nearly 4 dozen. Going to use for a Christmas Cookie Swap....May you Know the Truth and Life of the Lord Jesus today and always.

I am something of a cooking novice, and with this recipe, I attempted my first batch of snickerdoodles. The cookies turned out great, and everyone who had at least one now thinks of me as something of a god, which was my reason for wanting to learn to cook in the first place. I was completely satisfied with the way the cookies turned out, and my search for a snickerdoodles recipe has come to an end. This is the one. Right here and now, I'm pledging my undying love.  These snickerdoodles are even better than mom used to make. (Shhh! Don't tell mom.)

These cookies were a hit! They turned out great and this was my first time ever making snickerdoodles. I didn't have any cream of tartar so I used baking powder instead. I also used the butter flavored shortening which I think added a nice flavor. My sister raved about how good they were and it's hard to get a compliment out of her. :)

I made this recipe using the butter-flavored Crisco shortening after reading other reviews on this site. I followed this recipe exactly, except that I added a touch of cinnamon to the flour as well. 9 minutes in the oven yielded gorgeous looking cookies. My only issue was that the cookies puffed up nice and golden and then fell flat when I took them out of the oven. I think people who experienced similar problems probably made the same mistake I did... using old baking soda. I forgot to buy new baking soda and thought I could get by with the old stuff. I was wrong. I made six dozen cookies to bring into work. They were gone in less than two hours and there were still people out there who didn't get any!

These are my favorite cookies of all time.  I've tried other Snickerdoodle recipes, but this was by far the best I've ever made.  They came out perfect, lightly brown on the bottoms and still very chewy after they cooled.  I cooked every batch for only 8 mins. and, as I've learned from other cookies, I used parchment paper to line the cookie sheets.

"Add this to my list of favorites."  This was what my husband said as he finished the first cookie and was getting another.  Excellent!  Only thing different I did was use Splenda for Baking.

This recipe is fantastic!  Use good quality, fresh ingredients and they will turn out just like you expect.

I use a scoop to form them, roll them in sugar, place them on the cookie sheet flat side down.  This is one cookie that should be handled very minimumly before baking.  I baked them ten minutes, cooled them on the pan before moving to the wire rack...Perfection!

I love these, they are my favorite, here is what I did to personalize them: I do half margarine half short, I add a little more flour (so they don't flatten out) I add 1 1/2 t vanilla 1/2 t almond extract.

I've tried other Snickerdoodle recipes on this site and this is the best!  I made the recipe exactly as listed, as well as using 1/2 butter...the butter cookies spread (butter makes a flatter cookie, in general) and the all-Crisco recipe was much better.  I LOVE butter in almost everything, but Crisco definitely works better here.  I found that the listed amount of sugar/cinnamon was perfect.  I will definitely be making these again, by popular demand!  PS. If your cookies turn out hard, you overcooked them!

WOOHOO!  I finally found it!  It's taken nearly 10 years to find the perfect Snickerdoodle recipe, and I won't be looking any further.  The pic doesn't do these cookies justice either.  I am sooooooo pleased at how they turned out and it's the same as I remember them when I was first hooked.  I reckon the secret ingredient must be the cream of tartar.  I've tried many without that and they don't even compare.  I also think the trick is to not let them cook too long either.  It's hard with these because too brown and they aren't how they should be.  LOVE IT!

I made this recipe with butter flavored shortening...the dough was really crumbly. Idk if anyone else had that problem. I made half the recipe and got 18 cookies. I did slightly flatten the balls before i baked them.. They turned out nice. 

Also have anyone else notice that most of the snickerdoodle recipes on here are exactly the same? Snickerdoodles 1, 2 (have half the salt but still) 4, and 5. snickerdoodles 3 uses butter and mrs. siggs uses half butter half shortening..

I have been looking for a good Snickerdoodle recipe and I found it.  The first time I made them with all butter because I didn't have any shortening in the house - the next time I used butter flavored shortening and it makes a difference in the consistency and chewiness (I think this is the only time I've preferred a recipe without butter!). Very easy to make just watch your oven not to overbake. All in all a great recipe that makes a huge batch of cookies! Yum!

the recipe was simple....so i'm not sure why I decided to tweak ingrediants ;)
i used all brown sugar in the cookie. and added vanilla, and used butter flavored crisco, it tasted fine, and was chewy, but overall not impressed. my coworkers really liked them. i will follow the directions tonight to see what real snickerdoodles should taste like, as i've never made them before

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out perfect!  They taste just like the ones we used to make when I was a little girl!  I saw in some of the other reviews to omit the cream of tartar to make the cookies soft.  DO NOT do this.  The cream of tartar is what gives snickerdoodles that special flavor. Otherwise you might as well just make sugar cookies.  To keep these soft, do not overbake!!  It also helps to use stoneware, the sugar on the bottom of the cookie will not get hard or burn.  I use Pampered Chef Stones.  Wonderful recipe that I will keep and use!

the only change i made was substituting butter for shortening. i flattened the dough slightly before baking, and they came out *perfect* after about 10 minutes. wonderful recipe!!!

These were good, tasty and Very easy, but I have made them before with a better recipe. I would recommend, but if your looking for a puffy type of snickerdoodle these aren't them, but they will be perfect to ship to my baby in Alaska!! I bet they travel well!

I have had Snickerdoodles before, but had never baked them. They turned out quite well and look really nice, also. I usually use butter in all of my cookies, but I read most of the reviews and nearly everyone said to stick w/ the shortening, so I did. I am glad I did, because I think they would have been quite a bit more cakey w/ all butter. They are good and I am sure I will make them again. I'm not sure why, but I think when I make them again I am going to put a tsp of cinnamon in the dough, as well as roll them in the sugar/cinnamon mix. Good cookies!!

A terrific basic snickerdoodle recipe.  As I generally do, I replaced half of the shortening with locally-made organic butter.  The result was a more buttery taste, but still a light, soft cookie with just the right hint of crackle on the surface.

OMG!!! These have to be one of the easiest cookies I've ever made and they are just yummy. I made them to compliment my christmas cookie tray and between my husband and kids ate them before I could even put them away. I will absolutly be making these a lot more often.

I used the butter flavored Crisco stick--very good. I also used my small scoop from Pampered Chef and got EXACTLY 60 snickerdoodles. I have a gas oven, and it took about 11 mintues for them to cook perfectly (slight golden brown on edges)

These are just delicious. I used butter flavored Crisco and it worked great. Tried a different snicker doodle recipe from this site that had butter in it, but not as good...great flavor, but flat.  I'm sending these in the mail to my son in college. He's gonna love them!

UPDATE: just made these with one stick of real butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil. The best!!!

The first few times I made these I used butter rather than shortening and they were fabulous!  Definitely five stars.  When I tried them shortening, though, I felt like I was eating Crisco cookies.  Three stars at best.  But with butter they are to die for!

I followed this recipe exactly but something must have gone really, really wrong because they tasted very, very salty.  Can anyone tell me what might have gone wrong.  I made another batch of dough to determine whether or not it could have been a measurement mistake but achieved the same results.  They taste like they would be delicious if they were not so darn salty. Please help if you can because I would love to use this simple recipe.

This was my first time making Snickerdoodles and they turned out fabulous!  This recipe makes a large batch of cookies.  I shared them with family members and with the people at work, and even a few of my customers!  Everyone loved them!

I'll be making these again!

One word...AWESOME!  I did add a Tsp of Vanilla as others suggested.  The dough did seem dry when I was making them but they turned out perfect.  Took 8 min in my oven.  When I peaked at them at 5 min they still looked like the round balls I put in there and I was a bit worried, but like magic in three more minutes they were perfect snickerdoodles.

Very yummy cookies. My suggestion is to use shortening. NOT BUTTER AND NOT MARGARINE. I used brown sugar and cook the cookies for 8 Mins. EXACT.  It will look under cook but once it cools down a bit. it is chewy and soft. The sweetness of the cookie is just right BUT IF YOU ARE SWEETS FANATIC, make the sugar 2 cups instead of 1 1/2. This is a keeper. The following day the cookies are perfect.. still moist and chewy. JUST PERFECT.  I am hard to please with cookies but this one is for keeps.

Wow.  Snickerdoodles are my favorite cookies, so I've tried a lot of different recipies.  This is the best one, by far.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any trouble with crumbly dough.  They whip quickly and easily, and are the perfect combination of crispy around the edges and soft and chewy in the middle.

Cookies just don't get better than these!  This is a great recipe for an old favorite.  They are very easy to make, too. I get so irritated with people who give a poor rating to a recipe after they have made unnecessary alterations.  Please don't alter this recipe.  It is GREAT just the way it is!

The whole family loved these cookies!And they were so easy to make! I didn't sift the dry ingredients, I just mixed them well, and they came out fine. I also used my glass pyrex lasagna 
dish instead of my metal cookie sheet, because the cookie sheet tends to overcook most cookies.

We used this recipe for our daughter's science project, "something's missing from the cookies!"  I think she can make them herself now!  I especially liked being able to scale the recipe to 12 cookies as we had to bake eight batches!  Thank you very much!

This was a wonderful baking experience for my son and I.  He's only 2 and loved rolling the dough in the sugar mix.  I used 3/4 brown sugar and 3/4 white instead of all white,  and added a tsp. of vanilla.  The results were wonderful!

NOTE:  If you double the recipe, the instructions WON'T 
reflect that change -- it'll still say "mix in 1 1/2 cups..." 
which wrecked my first (double) batch.

Once you make them properly, though, they are delicious 
and wonderful.

This is a good recipe. Thank you for sharing it. I really liked that the dough doesn't require any refrigeration prior to baking. However, I ran out of the cinnamon sugar coating mixture before all the cookies were baked. 3 tablespoons of sugar and 3 teaspoons of cinnamon would be more accurate as to what is really needed. The recipe said it yields 36 cookies, and I got 37, so my sizing was very close. Also, I used butter instead of shortening with great results. Shortening is full of trans fats and/or artificial ingredients and has no place in my kitchen. My girlfriend loved the cookies, and she is a big fan of snickerdoodles.

This cookies came out ok maybe omit the salt cause once your eating them you can feel the salt. And when making the dough it ask to roll them in a ball but dough comes out to sticky that i had to add more flour to make it a bit stiff. Overall they are good

These were pretty good. They do not keep too good, however.(I even did the bread in a ziplock baggie trick, and they still crumbled.) I think they taste good but perhaps to avoid crumbling, one could put these in a air tight container/bag in the fridge. Refridgerating makes food firm and solid and if the cookies are in an airtight container, the taste will not be affected. So I think it's worth a shot!

This is my go-to Snickerdoodle recipe.  Very easy to make and absolutely wonderful!  I don't keep shortening on hand, so substituted the same amount of butter, and they were still a dream.  Great recipe!

AWESOME!! Snickerdoodles should always be made with Shortening, as this keeps them soft..I love the butter flavored shortening in a lot of recipes..I laughed at the person who said they tasted like Modeling clay?  I never ate that so I wouldn't know ..too funny!

These were awesome cookies. I followed the receipe to the tee with the exception that I added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg and used the butter flavored crisco. Don't know if it made a difference but these were wonderful.  Super soft. DO NOT cook them over 8 minutes. I used my convection oven and Pampered Chef Bar pan with no spray.  I used a ziplock bag to coat the balls 4 at a time.  My recipe yielded 30 cookies.

Use the bread method to keep them soft if they last that long.  Thanks again for a wonderful recipe.

These turned out great!! I used butter-flavored shortening instead of regular shortening, and I churned out about five dozen of these to take to work. They were gone within an hour, and people kept coming by to ask me to make more! Just one bit of useful advice: wait before they completely cool before judging them -- these get softer as they cool down. If you make a batch and they are too hard, simply wait and they'll be softer within two or three hours.

I'm confused.  Usually I'm pretty good at baking...had no trouble baking 4 beautiful pies for thanksgiving this last weekend...but these cookies turned out really really wrong.  They ended up cakelike consistancy.  I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 in case it was my fault somehow?

YUMMY!!!  I was being lazy and spread the entire batter onto a cookie baking sheet and sprinkled the cinn/sugar on the top!  Baked for 22 minutes, once cooled I cut into bars.  Tasted just like the cookie.  I also added vanilla as some others did.

My family went nuts over these!! My husband coldn't get enough! I have to go buuy more flour and i'm making more tomorrow.  I did make a few alterations i used buter instead of shortening and all brown sugar (except the coating) no white sugar.  I find this makes the cookies chewier.  I'm glad i ran out of choclate chips! (boy i need to go to the store! lol)

I have never made these before and I bake alot!!!  My oldest son requested them, my first question was "where have you had these before".  I took the advice of a couple of people and added cinnamon to the dough the second time I made them.  Then the third time  I added nutmeg along with the cinnamon..  My husband loved the ones with the nutmeg and cinnamon.  I gave some to friends and they really liked the nutmeg. It was nutmeg that I freshly ground.  They smelled heavenly when baking.  Enjoy :-)

These cookies were amazing and easy. My 3 year old did all of the mixing and rolled the cookies. She had a blast. I did use vegetable oil spread instead of shortening, and it gave it a great butter taste.

This is a wonderful recipe, and it produces a great cookie!  However, to make it a 5 star recipe, I used half butter and half shortening. It makes the cookies softer and gives them a better flavor.  I also added a tsp. of vanilla extract and a 1/2 tsp. of almond extract. These small adjustments make a FABULOUS snickerdoodle!

Changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars after putting a slice of bread in the cookie container overnight!  OMG SO GOOD, much better the next day!

Very good basic snickerdoodle, just like my grandmother used to make. If you want chewy cookies, BAKE only 7 minutes and remove from the cookie sheet immediately. The cookie will look underdone, but will set up while cooling. The full 10 minutes will guarantee they are crunchy. Still yummy, but hard.

Snickerdoodles are my favorite type of cookie, but I had never made them until I found this recipe. These are SIMPLE to make and taste AMAZING!! Even my non snickerdoodle liking husband enjoyed these. BTW, the slice of bread in the bag trick to keep them soft....works like a charm!! LOVE it!

This is a very good recipe, in November I made some that came from a Watkins mix and these just blew those away. The only thing I did different was that I used baking powder instead of cream of tartar and baking soda(a very minuscule difference), because I didn't have the c.o.t. Very simple and fun to make, I always use twice the sugar and cinnamon ;) and I always use Demerara sugar and Saigon cinnamon.

These turned out well. The only change I made was to make the balls a little smaller.
I also used red and green dyed sugar to make them fit for Christmas!

At first I thought the dought was a little dry (kinda crumbly) and I had to 'pack' balls of dough instead of rolling them. I also made the balls about 1" in size and cooked them for about 12-13 minutes. They are perfect! a little crisp on the outside, but soft and bread like on the inside. YUMMY!

It's probably my fault, but mine tasted slightly sour and a bit too sweet. I used butter b/c I didn't have shortening, but it was soft, not as chewy, but that's probably b/c I didn't use shortening.

Soooo good.  Make sure you use shortening like the recipes says, not butter.  They stayed soft for 5 days.

It was good but I think I might have mixed it too much because it was very gooey, sticky, and hard to roll. Luckily, it was so good that I didn't even care! The kids absolutely LOVED it! I'll have to let them help me make it next time!!!!

I made a double batch last night. I found that 8-9 minutes was perfect for the puffy soft cookie.  When I baked a little longer (didn't make it to oven in time) they had a cracked look about them and flattened, creating a hard cookie...probably 10-12 minutes--still good but I don't prefer hard cookies.  I think that's why some have had trouble with cookie.  Otherwise, it's a snickerdoodle.  Not my favorite tasting cookie but I thought this was a good recipe.  I also used a small cookie scoop instead of rolling in my hands.

I just made these and they are fresh out of the oven and i am having a hard time keeping my boyfriend away from them. Snickerdoodles are his favorite cookie and he rates these as the best he's ever had. I followed the recipe exactly. I needed the full 10 mins cook time but I think my oven is calibrated properly. Mine were as pretty as store bought ones and most of mine crackled on top. Perfect combination of chewy center and crisp edges.  I will be making these a LOT!

I made these for my brothers and sisters...and they kept begging for more, and I ended up making at ton of them! They're excellent and sooo easy. My sisters loved rolling the balls of dough in the cinnamon, but the first time around it was hard, but by the 3rd or 4th time, I was a pro!

The texture of these cookies was perfect-crispy on the outside, light and chewy on the inside. Unfortunately the taste was a strange chemical tang. If I ever try this recipe again, I'll halve the cream of tartar-its the only thing I could think that would cause that taste. My family did finally eat most of them.

I used 1/2 lard and 1/2 butter but still great recipe. I rolled the dough in a log, wrapped with plastic wrap and put in freezer for about an hour. Then I sliced perfect round cookies and rolled in the cinnamon sugar.  This recipe is also great for sugar cookies as well.  I made snickerdoodles, sugar cookies rolled in sugar and iced sugar cookies using this recipe.  I will be using this recipe for Christmas cookies.

THE BEST!! Ive told my husband for years I don't like Snickerdoodles....but there is something about these. Yes, use butter flavored shortening and don't dare omit the cream of tarter! Super easy to make did everything in the Kitchen-Aid. Will make again and again. Add this one to the recipe box! Thanks for a great recipe :)

These cookies were sooooo good! My oldest son asked me to make some. So I looked up your recipe and baked the cookies and my kids loved them. I let a friend of mine try them as well and he said, "Wow, these are some good cookies!" My son told me for his birthday he wants me to bake him cookies instead of a cake. Thanks again!

Sorry...This recipe did not work for me.  I have another recipe for snickerdoodles, which I misplaced.  I found this recipe to bake for  a friend, who LOVES my other recipe.  I could tell that she was disappointed in this recipe, as she said, "These are not your snickerdoodles".  Thankfully, I have since found my recipe.  MY recipe does not call for vanilla. I haven't compared the two, but that is the only difference that comes to mind at the moment.

Turned out great. I know everyone says Cream of Tartar is the secret ingredient in good snickerdoodles, but I found that corn starch works just as well.

My husband LOVED these cookies !!!!!. The only "tweaking" I did on the recipe was to cut the sugar to 1 cup because he likes to have something a little less sweet with his coffee. The dough was easy to work with and the cookie consistency was perfect!!!!!

I have never had any Snickerdoodles before, but these were wonderful! I thought they were best right out of the oven. They're my boyfriend's favorite kind of cookie, and he loved them.

I also took the added note from a member of sticking a piece of bread in a zip lock bag to keep the cookies fresh, and it really did help. They lasted a long time. This does make a big batch though, so make sure there is somewhere for them to go :)

This recipe is awesome!  The cookies came out soft and chewy.  I baked them in my convection oven (at 350 degrees) for exactly nine minutes. I also added one teaspoon of vanilla extract and one teaspoon of butter flavoring to the dough.  My husband took them to work, and they were gone before he knew it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is GREAT!  My cookies turned out perfectly!  My husband told me to "Keep this recipe around!"  He gobbled up 3 as soon as I transferred them to the cooling rack!  I dipped some of them in plain white sugar for more of a "sugar cookie" effect and they are also delicious!  Two thumbs up!!

This is very similar to a recipe from one of my mother's cookbooks for a cookie I absolutely love. To me, a snickerdoodle must be made with shortening and cream of tartar--if made with butter, it's just a sugar cookie rolled in cinnamon sugar. The two leavening ingredients and the vegetable shortening give the cookie its unique crackly top, its lasting chewiness and its sort-of tangy taste. Want buttery cookies? Make butter cookies. Want a snickerdoodle? Use shortening! I also concur with the reviewers who caution against leaving these cookies in the oven too long--I never let the tops of my snickerdoodles brown.

DELICIOUS
I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening for more flavor.
It is the perfect Snickerdoodle recipe.
Thanks for sharing it.

The recipe is very easy to follow and the cookies turned out very chewy, rich and moist! The cinnamon flavor was just right and the texture was to die for.

This was my first time ever making or eating a snickerdoodle and they were delicious!  I highly recommend this recipe.  I took advice from another review that said they replaced the 2t of cream of tartar with 2t vinegar and the cookies tasted great.  Soft and chewy, with a delicious cinnamon sugar coating.  Highly recommended recipe.

These are super easy and delicious. My husband, who is a tough cookie critic (he makes gourmet-caliber cookies himself), said that these tasted like bakery cookies to him. Great recipe!

A really excellent cookie!! I did half butter and half shortening as a preference and made the balls a little bigger than directed. THESE ARE SO GOOD and chewy. YUM. Definitely a keeper.

Update: I still had 2 sticks of shortening that needed to be used up, so I prepped the rest of the ingredients and then opened the shortening, only to find that 1 was bad (at least it looked bad & I didn't want to chance it).  So, I used 1 stick of shortening, 1 butter & 1 margarine. I wound up with cookies flatter than pancakes.  They still tasted good & weren't too crisp, but I will be using shortening from now on.  Original review: I used this recipe because I had some shortening I needed to use up, I prefer to use butter or butter flavored shortening when baking, but these turned out excellent!

these were just perfect!  i used half butter/half shortening and they were perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  could have done with a few minutes in the fridge to keep them from spreading quite so much.  my son couldn't get enough of them!

My 10 year old daughter made these all by herself with no problems.  They tasted great!  However, they got hard pretty quickly.  Next time I think we will use butter flavored crisco.  Definitely a keeper!

These were AMAZING! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE! They even impressed my sister, who usually HATES my cookies. I would give it 5 stars, but it was a little sweet and there was a tad too much cream of tartar. Thanks will DEFINITELY make again.

These are picture perfect and chewy inside. I used a medium cookie scoop (level on top), and it made a perfect size cookie (right around 40 of them) I have 4 teens, and they have asked that I stick with this recipe for our snickerdoodles.  Thanks Linda!

This recipe is pretty good as it was written. It is easy to put together but sticks to the cookie sheet like glue. I had a major mess with my first two sheets, even after using cooking spray. But had much better luck using parchment paper. I also had to cook these much longer that the 8-10 minutes stated, mine took about 13-14 minutes to cook. Next batch I will add a little vanilla and will put the cinnamon in the dough and then just roll them in sugar. Late addition, I did make it adding 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter and then just rolling them in sugar. Turned out perfect. My husband's all time favorite cookie.

I used this recipe to make cookies with my daughter for her school class.  Although it takes a while to shape and roll the cookies, it is time that my daughter and I used to chat and enjoy each other.  The time together was a treat, and the cookies were a big hit!

This is the old fashioned Snickerdoodle recipe I remember as a kid. We would make a thumbprint in the middle and fill it with a tart jelly before baking. Quite delicious!

The first time I made them, they were rock hard. The second time, I really wanted a soft cookie, so I followed advice from other reviewers: 1) I used butter-flavored crisco; 2) I baked them ONLY 8 minutes, then left them on the baking sheet for another minute, then immediately transferred them to a cooling rack; 3) I put a piece of bread in the container with the cookies. They stayed soft for days!

delicious! I used butter instead of shortening. I used 2 tsp baking powder as a substitute for the tartar (didn't use baking soda nor the tartar).  I rolled the individual dough balls in a ziploc bag to coat with the cinnamon sugar. Baked for 8 minutes exactly and only one pan in the oven at a time

I've made this recipe numerous times and its perfect. I cook mine for 8 minutes, letting the cookies slightly crack. Then take them out, sit for a minute and then take off the pan to cool on a rack. The first time I made them I cooked them too long because I let them sit on the pan instead of cooling them off on a rack. I also waited till they were brown to take them out. This was a mistake. So, I stopped looking at the time and looked more at the cookie. Cracking is KEY. My cookies are light gold on the bottom and still hard enough to hold shape, but they stay soft (not raw). Look for the cracking on top, that is when you take them out.

This is the same recipe that I used from my mom's cookbook except my recipe says to bake at 400 degrees, and I use butter.  My absolute favorite cookie, I have been baking these for 40 years.  Simple ingredients, inexpensive and quick to make, taste fabulous, people love them.  The skill part is being able to roll the balls, but that just takes practice.  Yes, the cookies are flat.  I like mine crispy not soft so I bake them a tad longer than other people apparently like to. I will try adding the vanilla to the next batch I make as that will no doubt enhance the flavor.

This is my favorite snickerdoodle recipe. What I like about it is that they are not crispy but they are not the cakeish cookies their right in the middle.I make them on special occasions and everybody asks for more cookies. I like to put a little more sugar then cinnamon because I like a sweeter cinnamon sugar topping. Great for partys.

Instead of using shortening, I used butter and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I baked for 10 minutes exactly. These came out fluffy and chewy in the middle. And, the taste was perfect. This was my first try at baking snickerdoodles, and will now add to my  favorite recipe box. It was a hit!

I've tried this recipe and Mrs. Siggs. I prefer Mrs. Siggs snickerdoodle recipe. I normally avoid shortening  because it tastes like clay. I used the butter flavored Crisco because there were many reviews that said it worked well for them. I'm sorry to say I disagree.

Perfect recipe!  I hadn't made Snickerdoodles in a long time, but was looking for one so that I could make them with my 7 year old daughter.  We followed the recipe exactly, and they are perfect.  Buttery, a little crispy, soft centers, and very addictive!

Really yummy Snickerdoodle Recipe! I used the shortening (NOT BUTTER) as the recipe calls for. The only difference I made was adding Madagascar Pure Vanilla Extract. I used Himalayian pink sea salt and canter sugar (finely granulated sugar). I made the cookies with freshly grated cinnamon in the batter and in the sugar coating mixture. 
I'm a huge fan of Snickerdoodles having eaten them my whole life and trying endless recipes. I can honestly say this is in the top 3 of all the recipes I've made. THE SHORTENING (as oppose to butter or margarine) REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!! I used butter-flavored Crisco and added a splash of vanilla. The dough was perfect and did not need to be refrigerated at all. I made slightly large cookies, so my baking time was 11 minutes, and these cookies sitting on my counter are both beautiful and delicious!! I've made snickerdoodles for years, and this is by far the best recipe I've ever used. Thank you!!

I've made this a couple times now, and we love them!  For anyone out there who, like me, refuses to use shortening in anything, these turn out great using refined coconut oil.  Besides that switch, I followed the recipe exactly.

Just finished making these and they are delicious. So soft and sweet. Agreed that 8-10 minutes might be a bit too long to bake. I did the first dozen for about 6 and a half minutes, and they were a tiny bit doughy. The second batch I did for 8 and a half minutes and they were a little crispier than I wanted (I was aiming for that soft middle). The third batch I did for about 7:45, and they came out juuuuuust right. Goldilocks would be pleased with them. I would assume that it has a lot to do with altitude, but if you're in NYC 7:45 is the golden baking time. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was so happy, these came out beautifully. My whole family enjoyed them and I sent a tub of cookies home with my best friend. This recipe actually produced WAY more than 36 cookies, however. I was running out of room to store them!

I have no idea what happened here. I made these as is and these are no "little pocket of sweetness" I was thinking nice and chewy. These things are FLAT and crunchy. Im not saying the flavor isn't good it's a texture thing.Could be my fault. I should probably re-up on some fresh ingredients. Oh the one thing I did do different was I added almond instead of vanilla. Which is added by other reviewers. If I ever come across shortening again I will make these again. Thanks!!

Appreciated JenniJ3333's comments - I used the golden shortening and they turned out great!  This recipe is similar to one I've used in the past, but this one will be the replacement one.  One little thing I find helpful - I roll the 24 first and just set them on one end of my cookie sheet, then do the coating and placing -  keeps the dough cleaner, I find.  Thanks for the great recipe :)

Awesome cookies & super easy to make!!!  My husband is the snookerdoodle expert and he devours them each time I make them. I changed only one thing in the recipe: I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored crisco. I do that in all cookie recipes. I flattened the dough after it was rolled in the cinn mixture.  I wasn't sure what to do. My husband said they were perfect. This recipe also makes delicious drop sugar cookies; just eliminate rolling batter in cinn & sugar mix.  I just sprinkled some sugar on top. I think that the batter would also make a great crust for some pies that need a cookie like crust.  Thank You Sooooo much for such a terrific recipe!!!!

This is the perfect snickerdoodle recipe! I reduced the salt to 1/4 teaspoon - you can even omit All the salt if you want. BIG TIP: WHEN YOU TAKE THEM OUT OF THE OVEN, THEY WILL SEEM UNDERDONE, BUT THEY'RE NOT. WHEN THEY COOL, THEY BECOME MUCH, MUCH HARDER! On the first batch, I put them in for 12 minutes, and when they were cooled, they were too crisp. Next time I only did 9 minutes, and they were nice and soft - perfect. Thanks so much, Linda!

I have been baking these cookies since freshman home economics class in 1975.  They always taste great, but I have learned a few things over the years.  Pillsbury flower produces fluffier cookies and I always use Crisco shortening.  As another reviewer stated, good quality ingredients will produce a better cookie.

Great! My sister has always been famous for her snickerdoodles but this recipe will give her a run for her money.  These are the perfect snickerdoodle.  I followed the recipe exactly as is with butter flavored Crisco.  Using Crisco here makes all the difference, in my opinion, and your dough will be very easy to handle.

Excellent! I was worried because the dough was pretty hard and crumbley but I used my cookie scoop and packed the balls tightly, rolled in cinnamon suger and baked - WOW! Soft & Delicious! I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe!

I typically only review a recipe when I follow it exact, in this case I did plan to follow it exact but realized I was out of cream of tartar... I was stuck using 4 teaspoons of lemon juice to replace the cream of tartar. The cookies turned out perfect in regards to texture and overall look, but I am only giving the recipe 4 stars since it should call for more cinnamon (possibly a teaspoon more). I also had to make the sugar and cinnamon mixture twice, the 2 tablespoons sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon was only enough for 2/3 of the dough.

This is a great all time recipe. Don't let brown as they get too crunchy..but if they do make great dunkers! Either way this is a wonderful timeless recipe! Great if your on a budget.

My favorite cookie! I use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil instead of the crisco. Worked like a charm, and I don't feel soooo guilty eating a bunch. I like them thin and crispy. I also add 1 teaspon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and use a little "raw sugar" in the rolling mixture. Give it a try!

Snickerdoodles are my dad's favorite cookie; I used to make them often.  These are the best snickerdoodles I have ever eaten!  I don't bake often, so my staple ingredients (flour, baking soda, etc.) tend to expire.  My high-altitude flour (I live in CO) expired 3 months ago, and who knows how long I've had my baking soda...  However, I don't scrimp on cinnamon!!  I use Vietnamese cinnamon from Penzey's Spices.  It is the most fabulous cinnamon and really makes these cookies stand out.  My cookies came out fluffy & perfect.  I also used the butter-flavored Crisco and added a tsp of vanilla as other reviewers have done.

if your cookies are coming out flat, test your baking soda. 2 tbsp vinegar in a small bowl 1 tsp baking soda. should foam up. Baking soda isnt often used and goes flat in the cupboard. great recipe thanks

We followed the recipe exactly and the pan was ungreased and they stuck to the pan and they were unedible. The taste of the cookies wasn't very good, either. It tasted like eggs more than cookies and the cookies also got very flat.I would not reccomend this recipe.

These cookies were good.  I had puffy cookies until they left the oven, then they flattened out.  The flavor was good when using butter Crisco, but it may have been a little too much butter flavor.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla as some had suggested.  I did not get enough cinnamon flavor, so I will add some to the dough next time.  One thing I noticed, when baking the first batch of cookies, I used two small trays.  The bottoms got done a little too much.  When I did the last batch, I used one large tray and they came out perfect at 8 minutes.

These were delightful! Nice and puffy, and chewy in the middle. I live in Denver, and used 3 cups of flour to compensate for the altitude.

My 10 year old LOVES baking and this was super quick, easy and satisfying. We had to substitute butter for shortening and just added a dash of extra flour/sugar to compensate for the liquid. They turned out amazing.

I am a huge snickerdoodle fan and these are awesome! I took the advise of other reviewers & used butter flavor shortening. For those who had no luck I don't get it. This is a fairly simple and as far as I'm concerned, foolproof recipe. Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned storing them with bread to keep them soft & chewy. All my friends are asking for more. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks.

They were great, made them with butter flavored Crisco (which I also used for the first time making pie crust last week-best ever!).  Thanks for sharing!  Our son is deployed to Kuwait, and they are now on their way to him and his buddies!!

I also had high hopes for this recipe after reading the reviews.  I followed the recipe and my cookies came out looking and feeling more like mini hockey pucks than actual cookies.  They are far too heavey a cookie.  The dough was very greasy and no matter what I did, the cookies came out flat and very dense rather than like the light and fluffy snickerdoodles I've come to love.  Will definately not be using this recipe in the future.

Had a paper route years ago, best fringe benefit was the tin of homemade snickerdoodles a customer gave me at Christmas every December.  I think I've finally found her recipe after all these years.  Thank you!!

These cookies turned out really great.  For you high altitude bakers add an extra egg and extra 1/4 cup flour.  Rolling them completely in the sugar/cinnamon mixture doesn't burn the bottoms at all.

I really love these cookies.  They are one of my husband's favorites.  This first time I made them I thought that they were a little flat.  The next time I made them I added an additional 1/4 C flour and they turned out perfect.  The only problem with these cookies is that they disappear :)

Easy recipe that made a nice, crunchy cookie.  The only things I changed were to add a teaspoon of vanilla, and my shortening was butter-flavored.  They turned out great!  Just the right amount of sweetness.

EXCELLENT flavor & texture! However, these cookies grow in the oven.  I use a standard size scoop.  Give these guys room to spread!  I can't tell you how many I squared off cookies ate so I could have pretty round cookies to share.  I usually get 12 on my cookie sheets - I could only get 8 when I stagger set these guys.  I kept them in a tight plastic container, separating each row with waxed paper.  They stayed fresh for several days - until they were all gone!

My 8 year old son and I made these and they turned out scrumptious.  First time making Snickerdoodles, but had them at a meeting recently and it was love at first bite.  Don't know how this recipe compares with others, but I'll use this one again I think.  The next day the cookies seemed to be a little on the tough side.

This is also the same original recipe my mom used for about 50 years.  I don't know where she got it but how blessed we are that it is one that she shared.  We will carry on the tradition during the holidays of sharing one of her favorites.  Glad to see it posted. Thank You!

These are so good, we followed the directions exactly except cooked it around 350 instead of 375 (my oven tends to be hot).  I added the vanilla other reviewers suggested and had to use butter because i had no shortening.. EVERYONE in my family LOVED these...

I made these tonight and although they tasted okay, they were really greasy from the shortening. Still searching for another recipe, but with a few changes, this one could be a lot better...especially decreasing the shortening.

First time I made this recipe I followed the instructions to a T, except for the shortening (I used butter flavored Crisco), they were delicious, but came out WAY too puffy for my taste.   Next time I used half butter flavored Crisco and half margarine. Instead of using the margarine softened, I melted it since the dough was a little bit dry to work with. I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/8 tsp almond extract in the sugar/shortening mixture to add more flavor. I reduced the baking soda and cream of tartar by half and that didn't affect at all the texture of the cookies, they came out with the perfect puffiness and with a much better taste!

Had never had snickerdoodles before..must be my sheltered boring life . Anyway someone brought some into work one day...not bad, but store bought. I made some that night followed this recipe (added a tsp. more cinnamon to dry ingredients and used butter flavored shortening). They were outstanding. Will definitely make again as they do not last long around the house. Thanks for this KEEPER recipe.

This is the best recipe for snickerdoodles ever.  I use 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine.  Everyone who has tasted them loves them.  They travel well in a ziploc bag on road trips.  Thanks for sharing! :)

This recipe was really easy to make.  I did double the cinnamon sugar mixtures since I wanted to coat the dough really well and there was not enough.  Tastes great!

This is virtually the same recipe that my grandmother and her mother used...only difference is we use 1 tsp cream of tartar, everything else is the same. THESE ARE THE BEST snickerdoodles (with 1 tsp of cream of tartar)....my grandmother made these every winter for their Christmas tree farm's patrons....NO ONE would leave after purchasing their tree....without stopping by to pick up a few snickerdoodles.  They are a HUGE hit!  I think the cookies are one of the main reasons people came back year after year (just don't tell the "boys").

These were fantastic cookies!  I had to tweak the recipe a little, because I don't have any cream of tartar and I was short one egg.  Even with the substitutions, they came out perfect.

I am, for a lack of a better word, a complete noob at baking. I usually mess something up somehow, and feel like blaming the recipes for my mistakes. BUT - this time I followed your recipe to every word, and I just made the most perfect cookies ever. My family was astounded that I could bake such a thing. Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe! :)

Turned out so amazingly perfect looking and tasting I still can't believe it. My husband likes very few sweets that weren't made exactly!-exactly!-exactly! the way his grandmother makes them, but with these he kept coming back for "just one more."   I added 1 t. ground cinnamon to the flour mixture and 1 t. vanilla extract to the sugar mixture, but I don't believe either were necessary.

My first time making these - delicious! If your cookies come out crunchier than you like, you may have overcooked them (I did that on my first ovenfull).  Also, I've found that a few seconds in the microwave (10-20 for 1 or 2 cookies) softens them up & makes them taste oven-fresh again.  Yum!

Tastes just like mother's snickerdoodles she used to make every Christmas.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I took the advice of others on here and only baked mine at 375 for 8 mins. - perfect!  Also, only dipped the tops in the cinnamon sugar so the sugar wouldn't burn on the bottoms.

This has got to be the best snickerdoodle recipe ever!!! I agree with some of the others, that you MUST use the shortening as the recipe states and not substitute for butter if you want these to be real snickerdoodles. The butter makes them turn out flatter, and more golden and crispy.. these cookies are meant to be soft, chewy and moist. A real crowd pleaser!! So glad I tried this recipe!!

AWESOME!  Took them to work the other day and I had more people going nuts over them!  They turned out great and anything my 2 yr old will actually eat is a hit at our house!  Many have complained about the shortening.  I used margarine and they turned out perfect!

These cookies were so good that I finally decided to sign-up so I could rate them! When they first came out of the oven and tasted them, they didn't have much flavor; but after they cooled, I tried a bite and they tasted amazing! I have never made Snickerdoodles before but will definitely make again. I would like to try butter Crisco next time instead of the original...probably adds even more flavor...yum!

Easy recipe!!  I made these during the Holiday season and everybody loved them!  If you like your snickerdoodles a little bit softer, just leave them out and the air will soften them.  Enjoy!

I too used real butter, but no one mentioned how sticky these are.  I had to put my batter in the fridge for 5 minutes and then immediately "put" on the baking sheet - when I attempted to roll the first one, my fingers had more dough on them than the cookie did!  So I just sprinkled the sugar mixture on top.  Tasted great, but looked like little scones.  I'll try again soon!

Made this recipe this evening and it was a dismal flop.  Far too 'short' and not enough flour.  Tried to salvage it but to no avail.  I'll look for another recipe.

I loved this recipe. I also took half the batter and mixed in chocolate chips and pecans. Everyone agreed that they made the BEST chocolate chip cookies.

these were DELICIOUS. I made them with butter instead of shortening, because I had no shortening.  They were perfect - so pretty, and just chewy enough.  I will make these again.

I've made this recipe a dozen times now, and it always turns out perfect! Crispy on the outside with a slightly soft center.  My 15yo son is addicted to them! Definitely a keeper!

I thought these were just okay, were kind of bland.  The next day they were rock hard, so I had to put in a piece of bread with them.  They were eaten here and there, but I had to throw the last few out because they became stale before anyone bothered to eat them!

Delicious!!!  My 5 year-old son and his friend couldn't stop saying how good these cookies were... he even asked me to give his Mom the recipe!  I added some vanilla extract to it and next time will use butter flavored shortening for a more buttery taste.  With regular shortening, it was still awesome!

This recipe was amazing. Melt in your mouth cookie.  Wonderful flavors!! My 8 yr old helped me make these, he accidently put the cinnomin in the dough.  They still tasted superb.  He told me(after of course the entire batch of 12 had been eaten) that I should make and share these with my friends as they were the best cookies he has ever had.  I have made snickerdoodle before ya know! LOL
I did have to bake for 12 mins as we are high altitude 7000 feet.  Not sure what the other reviewer was talking about regarding her flat cookies, but I have never ever had a fluffy snickerdoodle!  This will be in my #1 cookie recipes forever!! Thank you!!!

I have tried a lot of the Snickerdoodle recipes on this site, and I have to say that this recipe really is one of the best.  I switched out the traditional shortening for Smart balance or Earth Balance Shortening (which are both trans-fat free), and used evaporated cane juice in place of the refined white sugar.  Every now and then I add 1/4 tsp. vanilla.  The verdict?  Absolutely wonderful!  Even my husband, who is a Snickedoodle Connessuior, gave these 5 stars!  Thank you so much for sharing with us!

These cookies truly remind me of home, baking cookies with my sister, making a mess and enjoying the smell of baking cinnamon. The only thing I did was add about 1 tsp. vanilla, and since I'm overseas, I used a 2 tsp. of a premixed cream of tartar/baking powder packet. They tasted wonderful, and all of my international friends want the recipe! Kudos!

Yum!  My 5 year old daughter and I made these tonight for a school bake sale.  I mixed all of the ingredients in my mix master, then rolled the dough into balls (which was quite easy, not sticky or messy) and my daughter rolled the balls in the cinnamon/sugar mix.  I have the last pan in the oven and my daughter already snatched 5 cookies off of the cooling rack - sheesh I might have to whip up another batch to have enough for the bake sale tomorrow!  I had never even heard of Snickerdoodles before, but the recipe seemed simple enough and the cookies are quite tasty, even for my daughter who usually turns her nose up at anything that doesn't have "chocolate" as an ingredient.

This is a very good recipe.  At first I was a little skeptical because the dough was very crumbly, but the cookies turned out great.  They puffed up nicely and tasted wonderful.  Thanks Linda!

I admit I was very skeptical about this recipe and using all shortening.  It got such good reviews though that I decided to try it.  Then, the finished dough seemed very dry and crumbly-I had a hard time getting it pliable enough to form into balls and I was more skeptical than ever, thought the cookies would be cakey, dry, etc.  However, these might be the best snickerdoodles I have ever made!!  Eight minutes was right about perfect, and they were the right mixture of crunchy outsides and chewy insides, not too thin (like every other recipe I've tried).  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This recipe was fantastic!  I decided to suprise my husband and boys after they got back from scouts.  They thought these were great.  My husband said that it reminded him of the recipe his grandmother had when he was a little boy and used to make for him.  I followed the directions exactly and baked for 9 minutes.  I had no problem whatsoever with sticking on the baking sheet and they were so moist inside.  I did put them in a canister after they cooled off and vacuum sealed them so that they stay nice and fresh.  Great Cookie recipe!

Every person who ate these said they were the BEST they had ever had!  During a recent storm, I was able to make dozens..I baked them for a little less time so they turned out very soft...will never need to try another snickerdoodle recipe!

What a fabulous snickerdoodle recipe!  These are my favorite cookies and I hadn't found a great recipe for them until now.  I sent them to a friend for his birthday and he inhaled about 15 at once and now requests them every time I see him.  Awesome!!

Took these to an office bake sale and in less than 10 minutes someone asked me
if the recipe was a "highly guarded secret" or if I would share!  These are one of
the best cookies around - chewy, sweet, and super easy to make.

This was the recipe for snickerdoodles I have been searching for!  It was easy and my 4 boys (hubby included) just loved them.  I will have to make another batch as the first one was gone in 2 days!

My dad loves Snickerdoodles.  I wanted to surprise him without asking my mom for her recipe.  I made them with butter instead of the shortening.  Dad said they were wonderful!

I wanted to make Snickerdoodles with my kids because I knew what an easy recipe it is to make.  Since there are so many listed I looked at the reviews and this recipe won hands down. I am very pleased with the wonderful cookies my 3 and 4 year old were able to help me make.  It's a great recipe for kids to help with and very delicious!  I didn't have butter flavor Crisco so I used regular and it didn't seem to matter at all.  I highly recommend this recipe!

My mom's neighbor did a wonderful deed for her recently, so I repaid him with his favorite type cookie.  Not only was he thrilled with the returned act of kindness, he said this recipe was the best he had ever tasted!  Do I need to say more?

So, I made these GF. They were a big hit, but did not change from the ‘ball’ drop. I pressed them down out of the oven. Since i need to make GF sandwiches with ice cream, I will try rolling them out and use cookie cutters....stay tuned!

You can use applesauce instead of egg which my family found out long ago for almost any recipe.  It works almost perfectly the same.         (1/4 cup applesauce : 1 egg)

I had to use butter in place of the shortening. I would prefer to make them half the size the recipe calls for. I'll have to play with the time some.

I followed the recipe. The dough was a little crumbly after all the ingredients were mixed together.  The cookies turned out great & they are delicious.
This is the first time that I have made these cookies.

I used unsalted butter instead of shortening (personal preference). The cookies came out very nice: crispy outer crust & soft inside. Not a problem but a little easier to work with a little refrigeration. I needed more of the sugar/cinnamon mix at the end than is called for. Yield was about 5 dozen+ cookies (about 3 inches). Easy recipe! Rolling them out is the most time consuming part.

This is my go-to Snickerdoodle recipe.  It's simple, it's quick, and it's delicious.  I use margarine in place of shortening, and I add 1/2 teaspoon of Cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of Nutmeg to the dough and a few shakes of nutmeg (and sometimes colored sugar) to the cinnamon topping, but those are my only changes.  It's not only my favorite, but my daughter's, and several of her friends as well.

These cookies are good. Mine didn't flatten at all.  Hard to tell when they're done when they're coated in cinnamon and sugar - I cooked them for roughly 10 minutes and I got 52 cookies.  I substituted half the sugar with a sugar substitute as I was making them for a diabetic friend.

The perfect Snickerdoodle!  My family loves these cookies.
 No vanilla extract so it lets the flavor of the ingredients come through.  I do use half butter, half shortening, instead of all shortening, as the option that my original recipe gave from my Betty Crocker Cooky Book!

This was my first time baking snickerdoodle cookies and these turned out excellent! I made alternations based on other reviews. Butter-flavored shortening is a must. I added 1 1/2 tsp of Dominican vanilla extract. I planned to bake it for 6 mins so it didn’t overcook, but it wasn’t enough. The center looked uncooked. I realized this AFTER taking them out, and placing them on a cooling rack ( cooling rack is also a must) and eating one. So I put it back in the oven, same temp preheated and baked it for 2 more mins. It turned out perfect in texture. Slightly crispy on the edges, chewy on the inside. So the next batch will bake for 6 mins, cool, then bake for another 2 mins — I’m too scared to try it any other way, they were that good!

Made twice, the cookies tasted really good but I don't know why they  still went flat both times. The 2nd time I chilled the remaining batch in the fridge and they turned out a bit better but still not like the ones in pictures most people posted.

Made precisely as written.  Consistency was perfect, looked perfect and my 1 4 yo liked them; however, I personally do not care for the shortening flavor.  Will be looking for a real butter recipe.

made exactly how recipe said , I changed a couple things because I am baking at higher altitude (over 3,000 ft) but they turned out perfect. 8 minutes on a non stick cookie sheet is all I had to bake them for at 400 degrees F. (I added 25 degrees to baking time due to higher altitude above sea level.)

These turned out better than the recipe I made two weeks ago that used butter and shortening.  Those fell flat, literally.  This recipe makes a soft and chewy cookie that tastes like I remember Snickerdoodles tasting like when I was a kid.  I added vanilla as another reviewer did.

I just took these cookies out of the oven minutes ago. I let it cool and it looked so pretty I couldn't resist taking one. OMG!! This little gem is delicious :) I never ate let alone made this cookie before and followed the recipe exactly. They puffed up in the oven and when they came out they flattened just a  little which made them crackle a bit. I did not roll them in cinnamon and sugar because cinnamon makes my blood sugar drop but I just sprinkled a little on top before cooking. I also added vanilla in the shortening mixture. Will definitely make these again but I will not wait for the holidays that's for sure. Thanks for this great recipe.

My cookies turned out flat and like a sheet of cookies, not individual, even when I did make the balls. I burned them, but that was mostly my fault. They did taste good on ice cream though!!!!

I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1tsp of ground cinnamon to the dough recipe to give them a bit of flavor and everyone loved them. Had a hard time having any left on the cooling racks to even put away!

If you didn't like this recipe then you either don't like cinnamon or messed up the recipe! It's perfect. Make sure you sift the flour  to ensure the lightness of the cookie.

Had to bake the full 10 minutes and let the cookies sit on the pan for an additional 3-4 minutes for them to be thoroughly baked, but they came out beautifully.  Best looking Snickerdoodles I've made in years. :)

I liked the recipe, but maybe not too much shortening. The dough was awesome and I made it multiple times. Also, try to use more sugar and less cinnamon for the top part. Other than that, it was the PERFECT dough Linda. Thanks!

I followed the recipe to a tee.. and they are terrible. They have no flavor. I wouldn't even give these to the drunks at the bar. I was in a pinch and couldn't find my family recipe in time. Hind sight I should have gone without.

These are easy but I agree with other reviews that they are too salty and have a funny after taste.  
Update:  I just realized I used Tablespoons instead of Teaspoons... that would explain why they are too salty and have a funny aftertaste.

I have made this twice. I didn't have shortening either time. The first time I substituted 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. melted coconut oil. I also halved the cream of tartar. The cookies spread a lot and were extremely moist (doughy).... pretty addicting though with a slight coconut flavor. The second time I substituted 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. lard and put the full 2 tsp of cream of tartar. This time the cookies were quite tall and much fluffier. I didn't notice a lard-y flavor. I think time #2 was slightly better, but I loved them both and got enthusiastic feedback from others. Thanks!

Prepared as instructed. Doubled the batch. They disappered in no time.  Was able to save 3 cookies  for birthday boy before they were gone.  Although, they were too sweet for my taste....I think rolling on cinnamon sugar on one side would have been better and not as sweet.

Perfect!  I did add a half teaspoon of vanilla, and I used butter. It's easier to work with the dough if you chill it for a few hours.

We love these cookies!!! I never thought I was good at making snickerdoodles until I made these. They are always a crowd pleaser. I took the advice of other reviews and used butter flavored shortening. Amazing! We will use this recipe for years!

I've got a new favorite recipe, that's for sure! I made mine too big and baked them for too long (14mins) because they looked like they weren't ready! Trust the 8 mins!! They were so delicious, but then they hardened after about 10mins :( luckily the second half wasn't baked as long. I'm crossing my fingers I didn't leave them in too long as well! I'm definitely going to make them again!
Note: I sprinkled the leftover cinnamon sugar on top and I highly recommend it! 
Also, I would start with two cups of flour and work in the rest of disired. Mine were rather clumpy

I made 16 cookies each in the first two
batches, and they took longer than 10
minutes, so the volume makes the time vary.

Everyone loves them! I added about a teaspoon of vanilla, and I'm not sure if my oven is just a bit older but I recommend 10-12 minutes not 8-10. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked it, but the cinnamon search your stuff that you roll the dough around Dan needs more sugar. The cinnamon I think it's too overpowering to makes a little Bert.

these cookies are by far the best I've ever made! they were gone in an hour! super easy.  I would recommend sticking with shortening instead of butter, they are more chewy than with butter. also store them in a Tupperware or ziploc with a piece of white bread to keep them soft!! highly highly recommend!!!

My family loved this cookie. They all agreed it was the best snickerdoodle cookie they'd eaten. (Sorry mom). I like chewy cookies, such as chocolate chip cookies, but this one tasted too...greasy, lard-y, at the chewy stage. We thought they were best when baked another minute or two and got more done.  I used a #40 (1.5 T) cookie scoop and that make the perfect size. The second time I make them I found that refrigerating the dough about 15 minutes in between reloading the cookie sheets kept them from spreading so much. Super easy to make and tasted the same when the recipe was doubled. Highly recommended!

Made recipe according to directions. Relatively taste-free, did not spread at all, and texture of clay.   I strongly suggest using 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening recipe instead

Good snickerdoodles.  I used this recipe b/c it's a great way to use up the bucket of shortening I had.  My cookies came out a bit flat; not like the main picture.  Perhaps b/c I'm baking in winter...My only other note is  that you only need half the of the cinnamon sugar.  It makes a lot of cookies...I think with my melon scooper, I made about 45.

This recipe was exactly what I wanted in a Snickerdoodle, and these are the best Snickerdoodles I've ever had. I followed the directions of another commenter and placed the cookies in a bag and put a fresh slice of bread in daily. This made them even softer than the day I baked them. I'll never use another recipe!

Good classic snickerdoodles.   For my first (test) batch, I watched for the edges to look slighly brown.  That never happened, so after 10 minutes of baking I took the cookies out of the oven.  They were crunchy when they cooled.  With the next batch, I took them out of the oven at 8 minutes.  They didn't look browned, but they were just right.  I stirred cinnamon chips into half of the cookies, and that turned out good, too.

These cookies were the best snickerdoodles I have ever had! The only thing that was somewhat of a problem was that they were semi- hard

400 degree oven is way too hot for my oven.  I dropped my oven down to 375 and baked them for 5-6 minutes.  You have to allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheet or they fall apart.  The taste is delicious and they stayed puffy.

I used whole wheat flour and raw sugar instead of the all-purpose flour and white sugar. The cinnamon sugar mix to roll the cookie balls in, I did not use white sugar. Instead, I used brown sugar. Cookies turned out great! I did have leftover cinnamon sugar mix, so I used it for something else.

I also had a problem with flat cookies, but interest ly enough, only with half the batch. My dough was chilled, so it was the warmer dough that actually did not go flat. Can figure why some were different than others. Maybe air dry
Iced out the top of the dough?  I liked this recipe.  I just want to figure out the inconsistency.  Thanks for any suggestions.

Yum!  My favorite recipe for Snickerdoodles.  I like a little more flavor in my dough, so I add 1/2 teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon to the shortening, sugar, and eggs before stirring in the flour mixture.  At Christmas, it's a family tradition to add red and green sugar crystals to the white sugar and cinnamon mix.

This is an amazing recipe.  I changed out the shortening for butter and the flour for gluten free flour to make the recipe gluten free.  My daughter's friends are constantly asking her to make them for school.

Turned out great!  Added a little almond extract as well and a little milk after blending everything as it seemed a little dry, maybe 2 tbsp. Cookies were light and fluffy and very tasty!

Yum! I usually don't like cooking with crisco since it's so bad for you, but went ahead and used butter flavored crisco for these. Followed recipe exactly and they were delicious.

These are, hands down, the best snickerdoodles I have ever made!  Full disclosure, I subbed in 3/4 c. coconut oil and 1/4 c. salted butter because I had no shortening, but the proportions of everything were perfect.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is great!  Never had or made snickerdoodles until a friend requested them.  He said these are the soft and fluffy cookies he likes.  Snickerdoodles are his favorite cookies! :)  I added a tsp of vanilla like another reviewer had done and baked for 8 minutes.  Will be making these again!

One of my favorite "go to" recipes!  I modify it only slightly by using 1/2 Cup Shortening & 1/2 Cup Unsalted Butter (instead of all shortening).

This is the 3rd time I made snickerdoodles, and for the 3rd time, I was NOT disappointed! Every time I used this recipe, I've always had such great comments on how "They melt in your mouth!" and "They're crispy and soft at the same time!" They are easy to make if you use the said ingredients and the outcome is perfection! I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to make the perfect snickerdoodles!

So the only thing I changed about this recipe is I added vanilla just because I thought it sounded good, so about the cookies the dough itself tasted AMAZING (don't mind my raw cookie dough eating) and it is not quite as good as these cookies are.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe LKUEHL, it well definitely be in my recipe box from now on.

Mine didn't turn out well at all.  They were puffy but hard - not soft in the middle.  Did I overcook?  Who knows.  I've used a different recipe before and they turned out wonderful.  Try try again

Delicious!!! I have made these twice and people love them. My kids are allergic to eggs so I substitute 1/2 cup of applesauce for the 2 eggs. Perfect cookies.

These are so good! I read through reviews and made sure to use the butter flavored crisco. I made two batches and they both came out so different. The taste was pretty much the same but one batch spread out and yielded a flatter cookie, while the other did not spread as much and was puffier. I tried to do the same thing, so not sure what I did different, lol. Either way, both were awesome. Lovely!

My 11 year old son,Josh and I just pulled the first batch 10 minutes of these out of the oven and WOW!!!! We gave them just enough time to cool, and everyone in my house has eaten TWO each already! Anyone who gives this anything less than 5 stars HAD to have messed up somewhere along the line. WONDERFUL!!

I was worried when I finished making the batter, seemed crumbly, but the cookies turned out wonderful.   When you eat them the next day, heat them up for a few seconds first.

I made the recipe using the butter flavored Crisco and it is FABULOUS!!!!
This recipe tastes like the snickerdoodles from back home (east coast)! I will keep this recipe in the family for years to come.

Thank you for the great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and we loved them! I grew up with home baked snickerdoodles and as an adult I always used the recipe I grew up with. I saw this and decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did! This is the recipe I will be using from now on! They come out perfect!! Making another batch today while hubby is at work!! I have baked them for my pastor's family and up until trying one of them his wife had never been a snickdoodle fan, but she loved these! They are soft inside and perfect on the outside!! YUM!! Thanks again for the amazing recipe!!

I can't say I'm raving about them - they seem a bit too salty and with a "tangy" aftertaste, from the tartar I suppose. I'll try a different recipe next time.

Outstanding!!!  The ONLY ingredient I didn't have was shortening, so I used what I did have COCONUT OIL.  Everything cam out perfectly.  Blending the sugar with the coconut oil did look odd (not creamy, more grainey and thick), but I just went with it.  At the end the cookies were delicious.  My family couldn't taste the difference.

These are so good. My kids cant get enough of them. I do however usually omit the cream of tarter, usually don't have any, and they still turn out great. This is my go to snickerdoodle recipe every time.

These are the best snickerdoodles I've ever made. I live outside of the US, so shortening is rather hard to find for me, so I substituted 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 3/4 cup margarine for the 1 cup shortening, and it all worked out. I enjoyed introducing snickerdoodles to my in-laws!

I used butter-flavored Crisco and added a splash of vanilla. The cookies spread evenly without pre-flattening with the bottom of a glass. They were puffy and just the shape I like when they came out of the oven, but then they flattened out when they cooled. The recipe made 44 cookies, using a size 50 scoop.

This is the same recipe as the one I've made for years from the red spiral bound 'Betty Crooker Cooky Book'. It calls for shortening and says use part butter.  Also only calls for 1/4 tsp salt.  It is a very good cookie as are most of the others I've tried from this book.

Wow!  These are fantastic.  They remind me of my favorite snicker doodles at the mall.  They are flat, not fluffy, which I prefer.  I actually used expired cream tartar.  The fresh stuff is way too overpowering.  I reduced the cream of tartar to 1 teaspoon, and used 2 Tablespoons lemon juice.  This greatly reduces the overwhelming bitter taste that comes from cream of tartar.  I took the advice of others and used butter flavored Crisco.  I prefer this recipe to mrs. siggs.  Highly recommend lemon juice.  Love this recipe.  Thank you

I made these to take to a pool party yesterday - huge hit! I used butter-flavored Crisco (I usually try to stay away from Crisco but listened to other reviewers) baked for 8 minutes (checked @ 6, they weren't ready) and they were perfect, soft & chewy. Several people commented that they hadn't had Snickerdoodles in years as they went back for more. Easy, great recipe. Thanks!

I was looking for a great, dairy-free recipe for snickerdoodles and happened to come across this one. I loved it! They're pretty simple to make and delicious! Perhaps they could use a little more sugar, but would definitely to recommend to anyone interested in making them.

This is a great recipe. I have always used butter instead of shortening but will never do that again. These are great!

Decided on this recipe out of the 100's out there but changed it up some. Instead of shortening I used a cup of Tillamook Unsalted Butter. Made the recipe the same other than that. For the rolling I added some coconut into the mix.

I used Splenda instead of sugar.  The cookies were crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. By far one of the better recipes I have come across.

Very yummy. I like mine to be crisp so I did bake a few minutes longer so they were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

Wonderful cookie!  Super addictive.  I used butter instead of shortening.  For some reason some of the cookies puffed up and others went a bit flat (even those on the same cookie sheet), so they were a little uneven in appearance.  I can't figure out why, because I mixed them using my powerful stand mixer.  Maybe it was because of the butter substitution?  Either way, I'll be making these again!

I forgot the vanilla this time but otherwise, this recipe is full proof as written. Always make sure you sift the dry ingredients. I bake for 7 to 8 minutes and they always turn out.

I am personally not a snickerdoodle fan however, I just made these for my husband for Valentine's Day, he's crazy about them. They turned out very good. The only tweaking I did was to cut the baking time down to 8 minutes.  They are light, they are puffy and I can't wait to take them to him at his work. I already KNOW he will love them!

First time making snickerdoodles and they were amazing! I didn't have shortening so I used butter instead (I made half the recipe so 1/2 a cup of shortening was 1 stick of butter) and instead of using cream of tartar (which I also didn't have) and baking soda I used equal amounts of baking powder, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I usually don't make the same recipe twice because I like to try new things but this one was so simple and delicious I'm thinking of making them again this weekend!

What a HIT!  My power was off for 5 days and we survived on these Snickerdoodles and instant coffee.  The cookies were SO fresh and soft.  YUMMY!  Can't wait to make again!

My sister's favorite cookie is a snickerdoodle.  She was coming to visit last Friday from NH, for Christmas.  I made these because I knew she liked them.  First time ever making  snickerdoodles, and  since I harbor a severe dislike for shortening, I wasn't convinced these could possibly taste good.  Boy, was I ever WRONG!  These were fan--tastic!  Easy to make, easy to bake, and easy to pop in your mouth!  We had a 3 year old and a 6 year old in the house also, and they announced that the "cinnamon ones" were the best!  After  two days, we had just two or three cookies left.  I followed the recipe as written...and this one is absolutely a keeper!!  Fat, cracked, and puffy out of the oven, they cooled and flattened out, but remained  chewy inside while the edges were slightly crispy.  I cooked them 10 minutes.  These changed me...  I'm a converted snickerdoodle lover for life!

I've tried this recipe and loved it.  I always stick to the recipe until I've made it at least once, then tweak it from there if needed.  This recipe didn't need any tweaking!  

Thank you for sharing.

These are fantastic.  I use about 2x as much cinnamon and sugar to roll them in, bake on parchment and a little longer for my oven, but otherwise follow recipe exactly.

I thought because my dough was a bit stiff that my cookies would turn out bad. Surprisingly they did not. They were pretty darn tasty. Could someone tell me why the dough could have out that way?

Made these for my boss' birthday. Added 1 tsp. of vanilla, per others suggestions (thank you!) and an extra 1/4 c. of flour for high altitude. Both my boss and mom said they were the absolute best snickerdoodles they had ever tasted--and that they weren't just saying it because they were talking to me! Thanks for a great recipe!

I added 1/2 tsp almond flavoring, but I think I could go as much as 1 tsp.   Without the flavoring, I probably wouldn't rate it as high.

This recipe is perfect and easy.  I used butter and half a cup of brown sugar and one cup of white sugar.  Instead of rolling the cookies in cinnamon and sugar, I sprinkled cinnamon on top of the balls of dough before I baked them.  The cookies were moist and chewy and delicious.  I could barely cool them before my kids ate them.

Don't use butter!  It is a shortening recipe and that gives it a distinct texture & taste that butter doesn't provide.  I always add a smidge extra cream of tartar cause I love the tartness.  These are addictive.  I agree with other reviewers - don't let them brown at all if you want a really soft cookie.  For those who like thinner tougher cookies, squash the walnut sized balls down lightly with your palm or bottom of a sugared glass and bake til slightly brown.
Will definitely make again, when my waistline gets over the current batch.

We loved these little cookies.  I let the kids roll some of them in sprinkles as well.  They are great because they aren't too sweet or heavy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I think I've only had one recipe better, but can't find it.  So this is the new go to.  These are perfect and fluffy.  If someone had a problem with them, they didn't follow the directions!  I love how easy the dough is to handle, not sticky at all, makes perfect little fluffy cookies.  Yum!  OH and we got a lot more than 36 cookies from the "walnut" sized balls, we got almost 80.

I made 2 batches for a fundraiser.  The first was done with older flour and it turned  out flat.  The second was done with fresh flour and the results were flufflier.  Either way it tasted great, my husband wasnt complaining.

These were perfect as instructed.  The first time I had ever made them and I handed out the recipe! Absolutely delicious :)  I did end up having to use more cinnamon/sugar to coat them because I like more cinnamon/sugar flavor.

This is a nice easy recipe and was great for my 4-year-old to help with. Not too many ingredients, and he loves rolling the dough into balls!  Cookies came out  crispy on the outside and soft in the center - just perfect.

Made recipe exactly as stated, including the shortening.  Cookies were soft and fluffy and didn't harden after several day.  They were gone before they hardened!

I was excited about these. I usually make the standard- old recipe from my red and white bhg cookbook, which are really good. I thought with the high rating- these might be better.... blech. They taste almost.... earthy. I'm pretty bummed.

I had the same result as Chinagirl33.  Cookies puffed and then fell flat. They taste good, however, but visually they are a dissapointment.

Loved this recipe!! I was looking for something sweet to make that I didn't need too many ingredients and this was perfect. I did make some revisions. I used butter flavored shortening, baking powder instead of cream of tartar(didn't have any) and increase to 1&1/2 cup of sugar. They came out moist and just like I remember them. great job I will definitely make these again

Awesome recipe!!!  These cookies were delicious!!!  The cookies were full when baking and when I took them out of the oven they did flatten but that did not take away from the delicious taste!!  I did add 1 tsp. vanilla extract to the crisco sugar mixture.  Other than that though I did not change the recipe; not even the baking time.  My kids love them as do I.  Thank you for this fantastic snickerdoodle recipe.

This recipe was great!!! I used butter shortening and I think the key is to not overbake these cookies. I tryed another recipe before this one using butter instead of shortening and baked them for 9-10 minutes and they came out rock hard and flat. By changing to the shortening and reducing the cook time these came out wonderful!! I will remake these for my family because my husband cant stop eating them and neither can I. :P

Good cookie ~ but I made a few changes.  I used butter rather than shortening, used approx 1/3 whole wheat flour and 1/3 almond meal.  They came out very sweet and buttery.  Next time maybe I'll add a little less sugar and butter...  The kids ate them up in minutes!

I was looking for a recipe for thinner, crunchier Snickerdoodles.  I made this one as prescribed but I made them smaller.  Then when they came out of the oven, I smooshed them down.  Worked perfectly!

Great recipe! I made these cookies for Christmas. However, they didn't make it long enough to share for the holiday, everyone ate them up right away! I mixed the cinnamon with red and green sugar to give them a holiday touch, and they turned out great. Thanks for sharing such a tasty recipe.

I made some of these this morning and I must say they are fantastic. The dough got a little dry and tough and I suppose I should have added a splash of milk, but once they were baked, they turned out to be wonderful!

I can't rate these high enough!  These are an all time comfort cookie for me and as a novice baker I found them very easy and they came out better than any mix I had used.  I just tasted the first one after they cooled and had to come rate this.

Cookies were delicious!  Great, easy recipe.  While I realize many people don't like the idea of using shortening, it is a must for these cookies. This will become a staple in my cookbook!

I just made these for my cookie exchange. They were wonderful, even won a prize for them. The recipe is the same as the one my grandma used when I was little. This recipe is also easy to double or triple. I did need to add some whole milk to the dough just to make it more workable(approx 2T per recipe). I will make these for years to come.

These are amazing. I a made a batch for a camping trip and they were gone before we got to the campsite! Just make sure you mix the eggs in first before adding the dry ingredients because I messed that up and the cookies didn't come out as good that time :)

These are great cookies! The only change I made is to add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the dough. After all, snickerdoodles are cinnamon sugar cookies!!

After a bit of research and searching for a snickerdoodle recipe to try out, I settled on this one. In the end they turned out great -- granted I did make a few alterations out of necessity. I didn't have enough shortening, only about 1/3 cup. So I took that, the remainder of the softened butter I had used earlier in the day, again about 1/3 cup, and filled the rest of void in my measuring cup with vegetable oil. My other change was substituting 1/4 cup of white sugar with dark brown sugar, and about a teaspoon or two of vanilla.
Straight out of the oven they were delicious, and even after about an hour and a half of cooling. The inside remained moist while the edges stayed crispy
These are definitely going to be made again.

Really awesome! I changed to brown sugar in the recipe and added more cinnamon in the batter as well and they turned out great. Also added cocao powder in the coating and it's really good.

Love Snickerdoodles, but never had a recipe. This is the first one I've tried, and will probably be the only one I use. LOVED it. Of course, I reduced the cinnamon to half the amount, and I probably baked them a bit longer than suggested which I wont do the neck time I make them because I like them a bit more on the softer side.

Extremely disappointed with these cookies. I misplaced my snickerdoodle recipe during a recent move and these are a sorry substitute. Following the instructions exactly, I got a flat, greasy cookie that even after 12 minutes in the oven never cooked through in the center. Pretty much the worst snickerdoodle recipe ever--especially with the aftertaste from too much cream of tartar in the recipe.

These are absolutely delicious.The only changes I made were halving the ingredients,I used butter instead of shortening,and I cooked them on 350 for 8 minutes and let them cook a little more on the hot pan while they where cooling.They came out nicely shaped and yummy!

As I was making the dough, I was concerned it was going to be too try.  While the flavoring of the cookie is tasty, the cookie remained in a ball shape for the most part and was a bit crunchy for my taste.

I made these exactly as the recipe called except I added a teaspoon of vanilla. I added a little too much cinnamon by mistaking tablespoons for teaspoons. But other than that, they were good. I used all-veg shortening but next time I think I will use butter flavored crisco and add an extra teaspoon of vanilla.

Taste was what a Snickerdoodle should taste like.  Can't get any more clearcut than that. Next time, I'll make a whole batch instead of halving it and maybe use half butter.

My mother in law usually sends snickerdoodles every holiday. They were always too tough for my liking, so when my husband asked me to make them this Christmas I was a little worried. This was the easiest recipe. My 4 and 5 year old had a great time helping me roll them into balls and they taste wonderful!!!

I don't usually bake cookies because I usually tend to leave them in too long and they get hard.  These we some of the best cookies I have ever made.  This is a super easy recipe!  I will certainly be making these again!!

These were good, and fairly easy to make, but I found them a little flat on flavor as compared to other Snickerdoodles I've had.  I will make them again but follow the advice of other cooks and use butter flavored shortening.  Also, a word of advice, be sure not to overcook them as they turn out very crunchy.

Made exactly as described- they were PERFECT. I had to cut my children off- they wanted to eat them all. I made them a little smaller than a walnut and made about 70! They baked 10 minutes the first batch on each cookie sheet, then 8 minutes after that since the cookie sheet was warm. This is a perfect snickerdoodle!

Came out perfect! The batter was very sticky when trying to roll it into balls - but coating them in the sugar/cinnamon helped a lot.

This could be bad. I have finally found a cookie that I can make! And they're delicious - as in, I can't stop eating them. Hence, this could be bad. I followed the recipe to a T and they are perfect. I possibly made them too large because I came out with 29 but they still baked perfectly. Yum!!!!!!!! Will be making quite regularly (I'm going to have get back in the gym too :)

I had been looking for the best Snickerdoodle recipe, and I found it. I've had tried different recipes from this site with not very good results, but this one is the best. The Snickerdoodles came out beautiful, they were very pleasing to the eye and the mouth. I noticed that the recipe doesn't call for any vanilla, so I added 1 1/2 teaspoon. This recipe is a keeper.

I am sorry to say I am disappointed. I really feel bad about giving it one star. The recipe was batter so I kept trying to add flour (big mistake!) but gave up and turned them into muffins that came out dry. I will try these again but maybe not add flour and make them muffins.

I just made a half batch of these and my boyfriend ate about 3 before he told me that I should sell them. I felt flattered but feel the need to share his compliments with the author. Thanks!!

I make these ALL THE TIME and they always come out perfect. I'm not a fan of shortening, so use unsalted butter instead, and only bake with whole wheat flour. These come out perfect every single time, and I've had tons of people tell me they are the best Snickerdoodles they have ever had. This is my go to recipe.

Hey, LKUEHL
These are the same exact snickerdoodles my mom and now my sisters and I have been making since we were little. They are the BEST!  One reviewer was right, if they come out hard and crunchy, you overbaked them.

These are REALLY good!  I used sweet butter instead of shortening, and they came out soft in the center and a slight crunch on the outside.  I will definately make these again!

I just made this recipe for the first time. I live at 5400 ft altitude and didn't need any adjustments--they came out perfectly. They are firm on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside.YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!

this recipie was very good! i made the cookies half sized and i needed a little more cinomon-sugar but they were a perfect size and were soft and delisous. i also tryed adding some penut butter to one batch and they came out very well but i would sugest adding only 1 1/2 teaspoons per dosen where as i added about 2 1/2 per dosen. i hope you all like this resipie as much as i did!

REreview 11/09: I found this recipe like 3 years ago and I still use it to this day and still make mouths water... OLD REVIEW 2006: When i found out my hubby LOVES snickerdoodles i searched and tried many recipes... this is his FAV!  if you want soft cookies cool them stacked on eachother on a rack... if you like them crunchy cool them single layered.  thanx!

They were easy and fun to make but the cream of tartar taste was too strong. Also, they all came out flat. Next time I will refrigerate the balls before baking. I thought they could have been better.

I made these for Christmas. They are light and taste almost like Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereal. I used butter instead of shortening and a lot of cinnamon sugar to roll the balls of dough in.

Wow- these were absolutely wonderful!!!
I took them to a cookie exchange and they were a big hit- Tons of complements! I followed the directions exactly except I made a few changes for high altitude baking.(for those of you who are I high altitude locations, I have found adding one extra egg to my cookies and cooking for the lowest time (8 mins for this recipe) makes the perfect high altitude cookie.) A++,  I will use this again and again- Thanks so much!

This is a perfect recipe! For those that said they were too hard, I agree with the previous person, you probably overcooked them. I always store them in a tupperware comtainer that is airtight and have know them to stay soft for days. I also store them before they cool completely, that always helps with cookies.

This was my first time making these kind of cookies and this was a good recipe but next time I think it should be half shortening and half butter. They have that greasy shortening taste that I think the butter would help with. They do have a great flavor and I added 1 tsp of vanilla and a dash of nutmeg to the batter. They are moist and chewy.

These cookies had a terrific texture but not enough flavor for our taste.  Maybe it would be better to substitute butter for shortening?  Also, usually our oven is hotter than most, but I actually had to bake them over 10 minutes...don't know why that was.

Super good. DOnt over cook these. 8-10 minutes is plenty of time. Snickerdoodles are supposed to be gooey in the inside. (:

Great cookies!  I didn't have shortening, so I used butter, but they still turned out wonderfully.  My children helped to make them and had a great time rolling the dough in the cinnamon sugar!

My grandma handed this recipe down to me over 20 years ago.  My coworkers bug me if I don't bring them in on a regular basis.  Lately I have been adding nutmeg and cardamom to the sugar/cinnamon mixture.

Awesome, easy recipe:  here's a hint though- I didn't have 2t cream of tartar on hand, so I  substituted it out for 2t white vinegar, and they turned out perfect!

Super easy cookies. I made these for a class meeting at my house and they were   a huge hit. I added cardamom powder to the cinnamon sugar mixture and added a little to the dough as well.

This recipe is the best I have found.  I prefer the cookie to be a little softer like the classic Otis Spunkmeyer, but other then that these were absolutely wonderful.  Try them with a cup of coffee in the morning :)

My kids LOVED these cookies.  They were super easy to make, and were pretty.  They lighter taste was a good contrast to some of the richer cookies I make for Christmas.  This was the cookie that my kids kept going back to.  I too used butter-flavored Crisco.  They weren't as thick as I would have liked, but they weren't too flat either.  Thanks to another reviewer who recommended putting a piece of bread in the container --- this prolonged the longevity of this and a few other cookie batches as well.

Very cinnamon-y and tasty. The dough is the easiest I've ever worked with. Mine turned out drier and harder than I would have liked but perhaps I overbaked them.

The cookies were really good!!! I was only able to make a half of a batch, due to the fact that I only had one egg, and they came out so good!!! I only have one cookie left on my kitchen counter and I am hoping to make some more soon! Thanks!

All I can say about these cookies is that they are wonderful!!  I baked a bunch of goodie baskets for my family and friends this Christmas and this was one of the items I included.  Everyone said that they wanted the recipe and that they had to hurry and make more before the holidays were over cause everyone wanted more...LOL!  I did use the butter flavered Crisco, and followed everything else exactly.  The only bad thing, and it isn't really bad, is that they do become more crunchy the next day, but they are still SOOOOO wonderful!!!!

These cookies are better when they've sat for a day or two -- I wasn't sure about them the day I made them. But several days later, they're great. I subbed out 1/2 cup of brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the regular sugar and added some vanilla. The next time I make these, I might also sub out half of the butter-flavor shortening for a stick of butter -- I wouldn't mind them a bit crunchier. But these cookies are exactly as advertised.

Awesome, awesome, awesome.
I love this recipe.  My friend had brought over some of her version of snickerdoodles and I thought hers were pretty good.  So I thought I would try my own batch.  I found this recipe and now I like snickerdoodles even more.  My friends were a little dried out, but these ones were amazing.  Still a little soft, just how I like a cookie to be.  Thanks so much for a fabulous recipe.  I'll be using this often, seeing how easy it is.

These were great.  Just like you remember from when you were a kid.  They crisped up a little overnight (don't you wish they were warm always?)
but were still yummy.

Great recipe.  I like many users added vanilla ( i never measure it, just a splash) and used half brown sugar, half white.  Came out super moist and wonderful!

This is an amazing recipe!  My family loves it, and are asking for it already.  And I just made them last week. :)   Thanks for such a great recipe.  These are my husband's favorite, and are quickly becoming my daughter's favorite.

These cookies are very good! I altered the recipe a bit by using Buttery Crisco and they turned out fine. Definitely a keeper!

ive tried many different recipes for snickerdoodles and i must say that this is by far the best. all too many times the dough comes out runny and sticky. i was amazed when this time it didn'. my husband loves snickerdoodles and i know that he will be extremely suprised to get a box full of them in the mail.

Easy to bake with my three-year-old daughter (I rolled into balls, she shook in cinnamon/sugar).  Daddy says, "The best cookies I've ever had!"

Love this easy recipe! I always make these for my cookie swaps :) This recipe actually makes 5-6 dozen though, so no need to double it!

These cookies were great.  I've been looking for a snickerdoodles recipe for a while now.  The previous recipe that I had made them too thin.  This was just great.  I had to adjust the size of my cookie dough balls bc/I was used to my cookies
spreading out too thin.  These didn't--they
raised just perfect.  Thanks again for the recipe.

Very easy recipe. The cookies are wonderful straight out of the oven. I found that I had to bake them a bit longer than the 8-10 minutes.
