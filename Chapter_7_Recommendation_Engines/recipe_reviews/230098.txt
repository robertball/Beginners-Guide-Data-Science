this was a great and easy receipe even for a novice baker.  i found that it makes 24 mini cupcakes.  Also, i had enough white chocolate mousse for 3 batches of cupcakes.

Made these for a Christmas party.  They were pretty easy to make. Like the prior reviewer, I got 24 tassie size cupcakes from the batter.  I reduced the mousse to 1/3 of the recipe (3.67 oz white chocolate, 1/3 c cream and 1 oz cream cheese) and it made just the right amount to pipe a small amount into each cupcake and put a little swirl on top.  I then sprinkled the mousse with green sugar to create a festive look.  I recommend that you oil or spray the top of mini cupcake pan to prevent sticking otherwise when cupcakes rise they become difficult to remove from pan without breaking.

I absolutely love these little gems.  I am not generally a baker but these are worth the effort and I served them for dessert on Christmas.  Thank you.
