Wonderful flavor - didn't change a thing - except the meat fell off the bone which some of my eaters aren't crazy about (they love the bones!) So I may bake it in the liquid for a shorter period and finish it off on the grill the next time.  I served it with Watermelon Salsa and Spicy Sweet Potato Salad (both on this site - I thought this all sounded very Caribbean!) and good old corn on the cob.  All the dishes were a hit, particularly the Spicy Sweet Potato Salad (see review).  Thanks submitter.

Very tasty.  I doubled the rub recipe and sprinkled some on top after uncovering to create a crispy crust.  I also added a tablespoon of garlic powder, chili powder, and a teaspoon of thyme for even more flavour.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent, great taste and simple to prepare.  I placed everything in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. The meat fell of the bone and the sauce was yummy.

A big hit at our latest party.  We finished them up on the grill instead of uncovered in the oven.  Yummy!  We made a ton and only had a few leftovers, and they were good the next few days as well.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!!  I served these at a BBQ (finished them on the grill) and everyone raved.  The flavor is truly incredible!  I did omit the pepper and used Jamaican Jerk seasoning instead since I don't like things super-spicy and I was feeding a crowd.  SUPER dish!!  I'm going to try the same rub and marinade on a pork loin - bet that'll be great too!

Awesome rub! I used 2 racks of babybacks, put them in a pan covered with foil with about 1/3 of the juice mix at 225 for 2 1/2 hours. then cooled, put them on the grill to heat with the rest of the juice for basting...a crowd pleaser for sure!!

I've made this twice now, and we can't get enough!  I added a little Jamaican jerk spice to the rub, and cut back a little on the pepper the 2nd time I made it.  Rave reviews from family and dinner guests.

Loved this rub!  I actually put it on a 2 lb pork roast and the cooking time was right on.  I had a little rub leftover and wanted to sprinkle it on everything - especially good on my potato salad.  YUM!

These were pretty good, I made them in the crock pot using boneless spare ribs, and they did make the house smell wonderful while they were cooking! I thought they were better the second day though, I let the meat sit in the sauce in the fridge over night, then shredded it and placed it on rolls, along with some cheddar cheese and sweet BBQ sauce, placed it in the broiler and WOW! What a sandwich!

Delicious and it feels up the entire house with AMAZING SMELLS.  I cut this in half as it was just my husband and I for dinner.  I also cut the orange juice down to 1/2 cup and then added 1/2 cup of pineapple juice.  We will definitely be making this one again.

I made these for our traditionally untradtional thanksgiving this year and good rave reviews.  I made three racks for 7 people and only had enough left over for two plates to send home.  The flavor was fantastic, they weren't dry, the lime flavor snuck in but didn't overwhelm, the ginger stood out and the rest blended very nicely.  Everyone was pleasently full.  The meal was ended with jamaican plantain tarts, also from this site and .........  My best friend made the carribean holiday shrimp and the hard do bread for our appetizer and bread while my adopted little sister made the jamaican rice (also from this site) as a side dish as well.  The meal was fantastic and every bit of it was from this site!  THANKS AGAIN ALLRECIPES.COM!

These were OK. I liked the flavor, but it wasn't hot enough for me. I think I would have liked them better on the grill.

A good idea, but the cooking time was too long and the ribs dried oout somewhat. I think my family prefers a moister preparation as opposed to the dry rub.

Great flavours. I added a wee bit of fresh chili pepper for a kick. I used this recipe as a slow cooker recipe. Boiled my ribs first then marinated them overnight in the sauce. In the morning put them on low for the day in the slow cooker. Fall off the bone goodness. Once the ribs are removed the sauce can be thickened with a little cornstarch and spooned over mashed potatoes or rice...

I've always enjoyed ribs, but I have NEVER made them before. So, I was a little anxious in trying out this recipe. I followed it to a "T" and I was amazed with the results. The ribs were flavorful and tender and very easy to make. My husband and kids LOVED them and they ate them all up! We did add BBQ sauce as we ate them for a little more flavor, but they were very good plain, too. YUM! We will make these again!

I am sorry to say that, even though I thoroughly enjoyed this change of pace, the rest of my family did not.  Out of the five of us, only three liked it.  My mother thought it was too peppery, and my brother did not like it at all (but then, he's kind of picky).  Anyway, as much as I loved the departure from BBQ-slathered, messy, all taste the same ribs, the others did not.  I hate to mess up your rating!

The ribs turned out pretty good (Despite finding out the ribs I purchased shrank by about 30-40%.). The taste and smell was glorious.

I've never had authentic Caribbean-spiced meats, so I have no idea how close it is in taste to it. I thought it tasted really, really good though. The leftover rub in the dish would probably taste great over some mashed potatoes.

I forgot to buy the ginger root and the limes, so I kind of substituted the ginger root with pickled ginger diced and no lime zest or juice.

I also bought a 5 quart glass baking dish that did not come with a lid, so I ended up covering it with tin foil. I'm not sure if that was the cause of the significant shrinkage of the ribs, but I have another rack left and will try wrapping the ribs and rub in tin foil next time.

Ok, I needed a new rib recipe for my hubbies B Day dinner. These were a HIT! I didn't have any ginger. Added some  garlic powder to it and used a whole can of frozen OJ., no water,I had no limes so in went the key lime juice. Roasted the ribs for about 5 hours. I made 2 whole racks. Very flavorful, I reduced the sauce and brushed the ribs for a final coating while the ribs were on low. Thank you so much Michelle!

We did not care for this recipe at all! We did exactly like the recipe called for & never again, sorry. The rub was the spoiler, & the citrus taste would take getting used to. To peppery. We like Jamacian Jerk so thought this would be good. Ribs, to me should be BBQ, with or without sauce. I tried to have an open mind because I thought a change would be nice. My husband thought they were just ok & he liked the food they eat in England when he was there. We aren't picky or finicky eater, but this wasn't worth the effort.

These ribs were super easy, really tender and delicious. I like spicier food, so next time I would add some fesh chilies to the recipe.

Did not like the oregano with it, but then again, i'm not really an oregano person. I ended up scraping it off the ribs and adding a BBQ sauced called Irene's BBQ sauce that I found on here, and put them back in the oven. Recipes are worth a shot and I like trying new things, but this didn't work for my family.  Hopefully the BBQ sauce will mask the pungent oregano flavor. Good luck!
