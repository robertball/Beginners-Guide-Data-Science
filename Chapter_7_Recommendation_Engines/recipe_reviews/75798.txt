My Friends here are a few tips to really enjoy this recipe:  #1 The meat and the liquid (the sugar, seasonings, etc) must be COLD when you bring them together. If you take the mixture immediately off of the heat and then add it to the meat you're going to have problems. After you've finished the cooking of the mixture place it in a container and stick it in the fridge for a few hours.   #2 Add the liquid in small amounts. When you notice the meat is just beginning to become saturated stop adding liquid. You may only use 2/3's of the mixture and that is OK. The burgers will still be plenty sweet and flavorful.  #3 When cooking turn your grill up to high and pop those patties down. After you've loaded up your grill close the lid and leave them be for 5 minutes. NO PEAKING. After 5 minutes return, flip, close lid and don't peak for another 5 minutes. When you return they're done and you're all set to eat.   We've really enjoyed this recipe and I'm looking forward to many more BBQ's featuring the Stowe Show.  Thanks!

These were AWESOME.  This recipe is so unique for hamburgers- SO GOOD!
Scaled down the recipe to make 5 burgers and only used 1/2 the recommended amount of worcestershire and brown sugar. GREAT recipe!

There was much too much liquid, the meat fell apart, and even after I added additional meat to compensate for the sogginess, the burgers turned out so dry, they were inedible. If you've been curious about this recipe, save your time, and your groceries!

This recipe is absolutely delicious... we've made it three times... two times it turned out GREAT... this last time we had too much liquid...but we were able to make things work. I think the problem was we changed the original portion size. Be aware... and ENJOY!

The flavor and juiciness of these was really wonderful - 5 star.  But I'm only rating the recipe 4 because I'd be really afraid to add hot liquid into cold meat.  Thank you to tscheidler who suggested chilling for a few hours in the fridge.  And thank you to the Stowe Show for a keeper recipe!

After a couple of years of family and friends preparing this recipe for many people we have come up with some excellent ideas to make the burger even better!!!!!Add a pack of Onion Soup and Ranch Dressing to the mix along wit one egg for every pound of meat! Make sure you add the prepared seasoning (the boiled ingredients) a little bit a t a time until you have reached the desired texture while mixing the meat! Enjoy!

This is my favorite recipe on the whole site!!! Everyone who i've made this for begs me to make it again. I make it for dinner atleast 2 or 3 times a month. And when you've made the mixture and it looks like water and slop don't be afraid, once slopped on the grill for a while it turns into the most delicious burger!

This was certainly different. It was sweet. But... let's just say that worcestershire, italian seasoning, and brown sugar do not all belong in the same dish. Sadly this was much better smothered in bbq sauce which worked out well with the worcestershire flavor. The only change I made was to use onion powder instead of fresh. This wasn't terrible, it was just an odd mix of tastes that I didn't think went together. Thanks, I had fun fixing a new recipe!

This recipe is fantastic.  Using the stowe show recipe, my boyfriend made the best burgers both of us had ever had.  You have to use your judgement as far as the liquid to meat ratio.  Add the liquid a little at a time and stop when all meat appears saturated.  Top with some fresh spinach, onions, Cabot cheddar, and hearty bacon and you've got an incredible burger.

Of course I tweaked the recipe a bit, but my family rated them a ten!  Will definitely make again!
