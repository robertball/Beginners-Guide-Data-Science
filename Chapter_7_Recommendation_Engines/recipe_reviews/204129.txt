This recipe is not so bad; I tried making dumplings from scratch for the very first time with this. I think next time I’ll buy the skins and see if there’s an improvement. Also there is enough stuffing left over to make another 10 – 12.  Next time I’ll be sure to use parchment paper in my steamer.

Perfect! I didn't have the garam masala or red curry paste however these were fantastic even without it.

Oh so good, I used ground turkey instead since I didn't have pork....still turned out flavorful and a keeper. I used wonton wrappers, much easier.
