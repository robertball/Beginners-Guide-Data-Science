YUM, YUM, AND MORE YUM!!! I loved this recipe and even though, all I had was an imitation lobster (I know...I know....)it was just delicious. I followed the recipe for the most part, since my "lobster" was fully cooked, that eliminated a step, I also added mushrooms to the veggies, and a dash of dry sherry to the sauce. Very rich, very filling, and very quick to put together. Next time I'll do it the right way and use real lobster and make my own crust, but when in a hurry, this fit the bill. Thank you so much for submitting.

Wow!! I don't usually make recipes with only a few reviews, but I sure am glad I made this one!! I have been looking for a lobster pot pie recipe & this one is perfect!! I made as written but substituted the lobster with precooked  snow crab legs & precooked shrimp from the seafood counter at my grocer because it was much cheaper than buying lobster (and just as good in my opinion). Since my seafood was precooked it eliminated steps 2-4, which really saved on time! For the potato I used one medium sized red potato & left the skin on. I used skim milk & it still thickened up nicely. I used a frozen deep dish pie crust & put the pre-made refrigerated crust over the top. Oh, I did use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make this vegetarian for my daughter. This is absolutely fabulous!!! I also made the Chicken Pot Pie IX from this sight for my husband which has a 5 star rating with over 5400 reviews & this is just as good if you love seafood as I do!! Will make this often, thank you for the post!!!

Made this last night and it was fantastic.  Lobsters are relatively cheap this year and I was able to get some on sale.  Added sherry to the sauce and used half and half instead of milk.  Talk about decadent!  My husband, who never comments about anything was asking if I could make it again when our daughter comes home for Thanksgiving.   Would also be great served in puff pastry !

Very good ...I had the same issue as the first poster...5 lobster tails would be great but we don't live in Maine and lobster was very expensive. I didn't sink to faux lobster....but at my store lobster was expensive and snow crab clusters were on sale cheap so I used half lobster and half snow crab. I also added 1tb of sherry.

This recipe won me first place in a cooking competition! It's a great base recipe that you can add your own spin to. I used the chicken stock as listed, but enhanced it by adding clam juice and simmering with the lobster heads (I couldn't let them go to waste). I also added a splash of cognac, used half-and-half for a slightly creamier texture, and threw in fresh herbs right before pouring the mixture in the pie pan (you can use parsley, thyme, tarragon - whatever you like). When lobster season is over I'll try a seafood medley, perhaps with scallops and shrimp. Thank you for the recipe!

I really loved this recipe, I also cheated with imitation lobster and added a healthy amount of sherry, but it turned out perfect.  Thanks!

I submitted this recipe and I want to thank all who gave it a 5 star rating.  I did try adding sherry to the sauce, but found the savory sauce taste the same with or without the sherry.  To Mad Mikey...you did not make this recipe as listed but made your own version making it more Cajun.  Therefore I donâ€™t understand the 4 star rating.

Amazing recipe. I used seafood base instead of the chicken broth and added about .3 lb of shrimp. Scallops can sub a bit of lobster is too expensive.

The only thing I changed was I used the water I boiled the lobster in instead of the chicken broth. It was really good.

Fantastic recipe! I added a little more old bay as I used already cooked lobster meat.  My husband did not want to share with company once he taste tested filling. Will definitely be making this one again!!!

A very hearty, down to earth flavor - no sherry or brandy here!  The sauce comes together almost instantly, which is wonderful. The proportion of vegetables to lobster is perfect. Everything happens pretty quickly, so be sure you have everything at the ready before you even begin. I was  wondering whether finishing the crust with some butter and coarse salt might be a good touch. Worth every calorie!

I tried this recipe with my own variations after reading previous reviews. Instead of lobster I used salad shrimp and scallops, instead of milk I did half and half and added zucchini and squash...... and it was DELICIOUS!!!!!! I will be trying it the regular way soon

I use this base pot pie recipe and then season to whatever meat I am adding to it.  If you liked the lobster and you want to go out on a limb then CAJUN this up with a pkg of crawdad/crawfish tails they come in a pound package already cooked.  Add sweet pepper to the vegies (look up the holy trinity in cajun cooking).  Garlic and then Tony Chacheres creole seasoning.  This is a must in your cabnet anyway.  Sprinkle on everything.  I have also used packaged aligator meat and combined the two.  Have to saute the alligator (tastes like chicken lol).  Half and half aways better then milk.

Delicious albeit an unconventional way of serving lobster. Served to guests and everyone commented on how much they enjoyed this special dish. While wanting to try this recipe for some time and glad I made it, I would likely prepare expensive lobster in a different way going forward. I tried to follow the recipe but be advised you may question what directions to follow since the crab boil contradicts how to prepare the lobster meat. Specifically Zatarain's crab boil directions state to add salt, a quartered lemon, and cayenne pepper (optional) to the water. More importantly, it instructs to leave the seafood in the water for 15-20 minutes after boiling, and that's what I did. I'm used to leaving seafood in the spicy broth rather than immediately pulling it to impart more in-depth flavor. The recipe's ingredients and prep and cook times do not seemingly contemplate doing it that way. Fresh vegetables (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower & mushrooms) were used rather than frozen; used "Creole Seasoning Blend" from this site for the seafood seasoning; used 3/4 cup seafood broth, 3/4 cup crab boil broth, and heavy cream & milk (equal parts) for the liquid; added a healthy splash of dry sherry; purchased an extra package of double crust since the deep dish needed an extra one (might want to buy a deep dish pie shell and 1 rolled pie crust for the top). "5 small lobster tails" is vague but I interpreted this as about 8 ounces each, or 40 ounces of lobster meat. I purchased 3, 1 lb. lobs
