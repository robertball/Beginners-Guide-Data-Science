I am sorry but I just don't get all the enthusiasm about this recipe. I might as well have just eaten the tuna right out of the can.  Needs celery, mayo, relish, garlic.  Also, what is the deal with the picture that accompanies the recipe. Doesn't look like an English muffin to me.

"Best tuna fish sandwich ever" was the review I got when I made these sandwiches! I messed up the recipe a little because I forgot to print it out, but it still turned out great! I accidentally used TWO cans of tuna, about 1/4 cup of minced onion and a whole (small) can of diced jalepenos. I added a squirt of whole grain mustard and a squirt of mayo (to keep it together better). I also used whole wheat bread instead of the English muffins. This is a keeper!

The jalapenos and cheese taste sooo good with the tuna!  I used whole wheat bread and left out the onion (first time I made it I left it in, and it was too strong, plus I'm just not an onion fan).  I toasted 1 slice of bread first, then added the tuna, jalapenos, and cheese on top and put it in a toaster oven while the other slice of bread was toasting.  (if you use a toaster oven and don't toast the bread first, the bottom slice will be  a little soggy).  Soooo  good!

Helpful Tips: I prefer adding 1/4C of mayo, 1/3C of chopped celery, and maybe some finely chopped pecans or water chestnuts to make it crunchy.  Fry on each side like a grilled cheese or wrap in a tortilla.  This recipe has a good idea behind it, but I didn't care for it as written.  Sorry!

Feeling lazy one Sunday afternoon, I baked these up for my husband and I and we LOVED them! I modified the recipe slightly by using only half an onion, and finely chopped one celery stalk, and added 1 1/2 TB mayo, salt and pepper. Otherwise, followed the rest! Magnifico!

Simply delicious. Instead of English muffin, I used the English muffin bread. Grilled to perfection, golden brown and crunchy on the outside and creamy and chessy on the inside. Also added fresh dill, some lemon zest and a teaspoon of lemon juice. A great accompaniment with soups.

This was good.  I used whole grain white bread instead of the english muffin and sweet pickle relish instead of the peppers.  (It was all I had on hand.)  Turned out delish...and exactly what I wanted.  Thanks for the post.

Really needs some mayonnaise or salad dressing to hold the tuna together. Otherwise it just falls off the muffin.
The taste is good, if you enjoy the hot peppers, which we do. Quick to fix. Great on a chilly day served with soup or a salad.

recipes don't have to be expensive or take lots of time to get 5 stars.  This tasted good, I didn't spend any money to make it and I was in a hurry.  I was eating in 10 minutes.  If you don't like jalepeno's use pickle relish and if you don't have sliced cheese use shredded and mix it in.  Try using thick slices of crusty bread and browning in the oven while it heats up then top them and serve open face.  A good way to use up half a lemon or lime.  This doesn't need any mayo.  Thanks for a cheap, easy, super fast and good dinner.

Great basic Tuna Melt.  Used pickles instead of jalapenos as thats what i had on hand and shredded cheese.  Great served with fresh tomato slices. Easy to make and healthier than adding lots of mayo.

I love tuna and I am always looking for great ideas for eating it without mayo. This one is now my breakfast of choice. I've increased the amount of jalape√±o - we love our food really spicy.

This is my absolute favorite way to eat tuna fish sandwiches. I do add a little light mayonnaise and garlic powder and dill weed but it's SO good. Really just the best thing on whole wheat organic bread for me and TOTAL comfort food.

I make these occasionally, and I think this is a different way to use tuna, and they always turn out yummy. Sometimes i will use shredded cheese and mix it in with the tuna, to get all over melty and cheesy. It's super easy to throw together with whatever type of bread you have around, and the ingredients are simple!

I'm the recipe creator and if you like mayo in your tuna melt, then this recipe is not for you! I'd never had a traditional tuna melt until a couple of years ago and I have to say.... mine are still the best! :) I've modified the way I make it over the past couple of years since I posted the recipe - I chop up the jalapenos and add them to the mix to spread the chili love around and I butter the muffins, but I don't toast them beforehand because I like that half soggy-half crispy texture.  My cheese slices are also quite big!  Now if I wrote that recipe as I truly make it now, it would be horrific in terms of fat content!  But oh so good... Thank you all for trying my melts out!

I also had to add some mayo - it was way too dry. Then it tasted good - but with the recipe as is, I would not recommend it.

Wow! This was wonderful! I made it as soon as I got it e-mailed to me.  I did make a few changes as I did not have the jalapeno's, so I used banana peppers instead, and I also topped with roasted red peppers.   I seasoned it a bit with fresh ground pepper, garlic and onion powder. I also used provolone cheese, it was just wonderful!  What a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

we liked this -- simple and tasty.  i didn't have any jalapenos so used a dollop of thai garlic chili sauce and added a tiny bit of miracle whip like someone said -- to keep it together (even though i was specifically looking for a recipe with no mayo). topped with pepper jack for even more kick.  served open faced on 9-grain bread.  will definitely have again -- thank you!

Initially I thought jalepenos and tuna were a strange combination even though I love jalepenos.  After trying this, I must say that I may never make tuna salad again without jalepenos!  I did add a little mayo and celery but this was scrumptious!

I agree that you have to add a little mayo, I also subbed sweet cut up pickles in place of the peppers since I had my grandbabies over. Made a great lunch.  Thanks for the post.

I made this for dinner tonight with a few changes my family isn‚Äôt much for jalapeno peppers so I used pickle relish and added a little mayo and creamy dill mustard to bind the tuna together. Very, very good. This will be a keeper!

I think it is a rather skimpy recipe, and one can of tuna does not serve 4 people.  The jalepenos are a nice touch, but everyone that loves it has jazzed it up a bit.  Definitely needs some chopped celery, garlic, chopped nuts or mayo in it.

this recipe was Ok, only I noticed I just took the idea and changed it so much it became a new recipe. :) I added some mayo and used diced pickles. I also used American instead of cheddar. It was good the way I made it. :) Good luck!

Great way to liven up a simple tuna fish sandwich. I followed Jenn H.'s suggestion to add some mustard to the mix.  Thanks!

I had to update my review now that I have made these a few times.. I know I don't follow the recipe to a T but they are really good. I always add a little more seasoning garlic and onion powder and a little seasoning salt, I also add squirt of Dijon mustard, horseradish and mayo.. I never have English muffins I toast bread to put it on and bake that and this last time I used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar and OMG they were so good and I'm not a huge tuna fan but when it comes to these I am....

This was fantastic, however I had to doctor it up with two tablespoons of mayo. I also used a quarter of a slice of tomato and pepper-jack cheese rather then cheddar. My husband (who is an excellent cook)LOVED IT!!

I agree that this definately needs some mayo to hold together.  Otherwise it was great.  I, too, used whole wheat bread toasted first.  Also used swiss cheese because that's what I had, but I thought it was great, if a tad bit dry.

So I made some changes just because and I turned out really good. I put the tubs in a small bowl and added sour cream, pepper, garlic salt, paprika, and lemon juice. After mixing it all I added more of what I thought would make it taste better so for me I added more lemon juice, sour cream and garlic salt. I kept the direction of letting the bread (100% whole wheat) toast while the oven preheated. Then after putting the tuna on one slice and adding a thin layer of spinach, I put a thick amount of shredded cheese on the other slice. After 10 minutes I pulled the tray out and put the slice with melted cheese onto the tuna slice and pressed down before the cutting it in diagonals. It was super quick to prepare and make.

Now I know why there are toaster ovens! Ater reading a few reviews, I diced about 3 T of sweet onion, added a couple Tbsp. of dill relish, minced about 8 pickled jalapeno slices & about 2Tbsp of miracle whip combined w/tuna. I used medium cheddar grated on whole wheat. Put on the tray in middle of toaster ovenon bake @ 350 after about 10 minutes the chees was oozing down the sides I then swithched the oven to toast for a couple minutes. I rtealized the possibilites are endless. It really is more than a garlic bread maker!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I did not use the same ingredients. I think that this is a great tuna base. It helps those learning to cook get a feel for what should go in a Tuna dish. I as well doctored it up. I used bell peppers, a quarter of an purple onion, 3 boiled eggs, sweet relish, banana peppers, mayo, salt, and pepper. It was delicious. This recipe and the reviewers inspired me to try new things with my tuna because before I had never used banana peppers and bell peppers.

I liked this twist on my boring old plain recipe that I have been making for at least 50 years.  I used sweet pickle relish instead of jalapenos, Did add a small amount of mayo and used another reviewer's suggestion of shredded cheese in the mix.  Baked open face in the toaster oven and was quite pleased with the result! I plan on trying it with dill and maybe a different shredded cheese. The jalapenos might be good with Monteray Jack!  Thanks for teaching this old lady a new trick!

I was all set to try this and discovered we were out of tuna.  We had sardines, however, and they were dated later this month.  I wound up following the recipe exactly except with sardines and Jarlsberg cheese, just because I had that on hand, too.  It was simple, quick and a tasty, and we enjoyed it. I might have let that can of sardines get away from me if it wasn't for stumbling on this recipe today.  Thanks, momnipotent!

The combination of the cheese and pickled jalapenos on this was wonderful.  We did add a bit of mayo and used homemade white bread.  Everyone was quite pleased with this.  Will make again.

I was hoping for something more. It's just tuna with cheese, onion and jalape√±o. For what it's worth, I added a little mustard (I like a brown or Dijon) and some mayo, with celery seed.

I had to make some changes according to what I had on hand. I didn't have English muffins or an onion, so I used half a bagel and minced onioin. I also added mayo and garlic salt to the tuna and used American cheese instead of cheddar. It was absolutely amazing!!

The combo of Jalepenos and cheese is what makes this so sandwich so great. I too added a little mayo, and it worked great. My husband likes a little spice in everything, so this was perfect for him.

These turned out really good, but I definitely recommend toasting the English muffin, and also adding a good dollop of mayo to the tuna mixture. I had mine without the jalapenos, and wished I'd added some sliced fresh tomato. Thanks, Nisa!

This was a good Tuna melt.  I will have to add more flavor like Garlic or lemon pepper next time.  Also, I would toast the English muffin before putting it in the oven.
