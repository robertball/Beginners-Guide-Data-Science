Well, I think I have found that "missing ingredient" in this recipe! I read all of the reviews saying it was missing something, so I went on a quest to find it.
First of all, I saute'd the chicken in hot sesame oil, but regular sesame oil would probably be nice also. This added a nice kick and flavor.

I added lots of carrots, cubed potatoes (a must), onions. Then I threw in a can of bean sprouts and a generous handfull of unsalted peanuts (yum!), but you could easily use cashews.

I used a regular can of coconut milk, cilantro, 1 T fish sauce, about 1/3 t of corriander, 1-2 t sugar, and some s and p to taste.

Here is the secret ingredient: a couple of dollops of creamy peanut butter! It gives it a beautiful satay flavor, and somehow balances out the spicy with a more smooth, peanuty taste.

I would love to hear feedback on some of you who try this added ingredient.

Made this way, I will certainly make again, over and over. My husband adored this!

I served over asian coconut rice from this site (something else that balances out the spicyness).

Delicious.

The recipe is okay as is, but I made a few adjustments for more flavor.  As recommended by others, I doubled the curry paste.  I also added the juice of 1 lime, 1/2 teaspoon of coriander, 2 tablespoons fish sauce (many groceries have this in Asian section), fresh minced garlic clove, and 2 teaspoons sugar.

Definitely restaurant quality!  But don't be fooled by earlier posts: 1 Tbsp is plenty of curry paste, if you're using the kind of paste I use!  You might want to start less if you are sensitve to spicy foods.  I recommend that you stir curry paste and 2 Tablespoons corn starch with a little bit of the coconut milk in separate dish, add to cooking vegetables and chicken, then combine the rest of the can of coconut milk at the end to make it easier to stir in a wok.  I followed the suggestions in other reviews and added juice of 1 lime, fresh garlic, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, plus added minced/grated ginger, and plenty of black pepper and salt.  I cooked the minced garlic in the oil for 1 minute before adding the chicken.  Extra cilantro helps the flavor, too.  It was fabulous with rice! A++

This recipe is a great BASE, but to make it taste restaurant quality quite a few changes/additions are needed.  Here is a summary of what I've done:  (1) Use sesame oil instead of olive oil.  Saute grated ginger and fresh pressed garlic in it before adding the chicken.  (2) To make it easier to mix with the chicken/veggies, combine in a small bowl the cornstarch, some regular coconut milk, curry paste, 1/3 t coriander, 2 t peanut butter, 2 T fish sauce, fresh ground pepper, and 3 t sugar.  (3) You might need to add more sugar...initially we did 2 t and realized that it was missing SOMETHING.  Turns out an extra touch of sugar is exactly what was needed.  (4) Adding water chestnuts and chopped cashews give a nice crunch.  (5) Use basil instead of cilantro.

This was SO good! I read the reviews before I prepared it and added more red curry paste as was suggested. I also added some fresh garlic, lime juice, salt and pepper while cooking. It was out of this world...just like going out for Thai food. I would start easy on the curry and continually taste and add, taste and add. I went a little overboard, but I love it spicy! If you like Thai, you should love this.

Too bland, there is definitely something missing from this recipe! If you want hot you can always add more curry paste, but this does not make up for the lack flavor.

Really, really good - it tasted like what you would order in a Thai restaurant.  I definitely doubled the red curry paste because I enjoy spicy food.  I also couldn't find 'light' coconut milk, so I used regular - I will try try to find 'lite'going forward because it made it richer than normal.  Yummy, and I will make again!!!

This is a simple and tasty dish.  It did lack a bit in the flavor department.  I'm not sure what to add--perhaps some ginger or garlic.  We added extra curry paste, but it just made it spicier, not more flavorful.  Next time, I'll add some fresh garlic and ginger to the vegetable stir-fry.

This tasted much better than it looked.  I added some snow peas for color.  Although I added double curry paste we still didn't have enough heat for our taste.  Before we added 4 thai peppers to it for extra heat the flavor was excellent.  After the thai peppers it had some kick.  What was good though even though it wasn't all that spicy someone who does not like it all spicy and burning will enjoy it.  Wife says this one is a keeper and I agree with her.  Good job on the recipe.

Great way to make authentic tasting Thai curry quickly!  I also tend to use whatever fresh veggie's I have, even if I don't have what was specified in this recipe.

Pretty good curry recipe but it is missing a critical ingredient.... FISH SAUCE! at least 2-3 TBSP. Without it this would be bland indeed. Fish sauce is the Thai equivalent to adding salt ... No fishy taste so don't skip it.  I would definitely double or triple the curry paste as well,  in fact I personally add at least 4TBSP .. If it doesn't bring tears to my eyes, it's not spicy enough ;) I also did not use any cornstarch (not needed) or cilantro although I might consider using a handful of fresh basil which is more traditional.  With those modifications I think this is a 5 star recipe but as it's written I can only give it 4 ... Too bland as written.

Don't be deceived by other reviewers- this recipe is VERY bland! There is something missing, and I would read other reviewers ideas to maybe change it to your liking. I followed one person's advice that it was good as-is, and I completely disagree. Sure, it SMELLS restaurant quality, and it makes you excited to taste it.. until you realize. Even the chicken and vegetables couldnt save the taste! I instantly thought the coconut milk shouldn't be light but regular- I will try this in the future with a new receipe and all-fat coconut milk. Good luck to those who try this.. Also I would like to comment that adding tons of peanut butter and peanuts does not sound like curry but peanut sauce recipes. I think this is meant to be only a coconut and spicy recipe. If I can get the Thai place's recipe by me, I will find out..!!

We make this dish all the time, but my ingredients are a bit different...I use 3 cloves garlice, minced, and 1 tsp crushed ginger along with the curry paste (usually 2 tsp curry paste--it's quite fiery!).  I also quarter and then slice my onion (we prefer sweet) and use whatever color pepper I have on hand and juliene the carrot.  I don't like zucchini, so I don't use that, but it's quite good with frozen green peas and also with sugar snap peas.  It's a delicious dish with endless possibilities with the veggies.

I really wanted to make a good red curry but after reading some of the reviews on this recipe and noticing something not so authentic like cornstarch in the ingredients I decided to do some research.
I made something that was still similar to this recipe:
1/2 yellow pepper, 1/2 red pepper both thinly slice, one carrot thinly sliced, 3 tbsp of red curry paste, 1 can coconut mild, 2 1/2 tbsp fish sauce, 1 tbsp lime juice, 2 chicken breast sliced thinly, 1 cup bean sprouts, 10 snow pea shoots, and 1/4 cup cilantro.
So you can see it was similar but much more authentic and the flavours were amazing.
I probably shouldn't even be rating this recipe seen as I didn't really follow it through but I wanted to share with everyone what I did and let you all know I was so impressed with the flavours.
I must thank this recipe for giving me the basic iddea.

I made this dish for my boyfriend and I and we both found it completely unflavorful.  Not sure if it would be better with regular coconut milk instead of lite, but I was very disappointed!

BLAH!! ! This curry is missing spices. Cumin, cayenne, ginger, garlic, salt, thai basil, a touch of lime and brown sugar. I just followed the directions and was so disappointed. If you like bland foods don't change a thing.

The meal was a big hit with both old and young alike.  I doubled the recipe for 8 (we 4 are big eaters) and realized that I had to make 2 batches due to equipment contstraints (pan too small).  It worked out though because the first batch with curry sauce as directed was great for the adults, however when I tasted it I thought it might be a wee bit spicy for the youngins.  Therefore I halved it for the kiddies which they said was perfect.  

They're actually 11 and 13, so I'm sure they so hate that I'm calling them kiddies :-)  (One of them is reading over my shoulder as I type this)

I've already got a request to make this dish again real soon!  I'm looking forward to trying more recipes from this site.  This was my first recipe from allrecipes.com  Great site!

Wow! This was really good! I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely authentic resturant quality.  But, I made a few changes: I used sesame oil instead of olive oil, lightly salted and peppered the chicken, added 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, doubled the curry paste (I like it spicy) and added bamboo shoots for a really authentic touch. Served it over brown rice. Yummy!

There's a little mom and pop place in Dallas, Tx called "Tukta Thai" and they have the best red curry chicken. I use that as a basis for making my own. Instead of using olive oil, use sesame oil and it does not hurt to gently sprinkle some salt and pepper on the chicken. For the veggies I used FRESH green beans, zucchini, carrots, and red or green bell peppers. The missing ingredient here are bamboo shoots. It is a must it makes all the difference. I added fish sauce and 2 tablespoons of sugar. If you like spicy just add pepper flakes and cayenne pepper to taste. Also, i added like 3 tablespoons of the curry paste. I have been playing with the recipe and it finally taste like the one from the restaurant, my hubby was in love. Personally there really is NO need for the cornstarch. End result will be 5 STARS!!!!

With the suggestions from other reviewers, I added coriander, and fresh minced garlic to sesame and olive oil. I didn't have zucchini, so I added green bell peppers along with the red bell peppers and carrots. I used plain rice milk instead of coconut milk, and didn't measure out the red curry paste or peanut butter, but about two large scoops of each was the perfect for us. Served over quinoa. Will make again, and enjoy again!

I thought this was an easy, tasty Thai curry and I enjoyed making it but I would not use light coconut milk again - it was way too watery. I had to add more Thai curry paste and dried red chilli flakes to up the flavour. Next time I think I might leave the carrots out too. Nevertheless - it's a good recipe.

As some other suggested, I changed the recipe a bit; adding some peanut butter, lime juice, garlic, sprouts, and using sesame oil instead of olive oil. Turned out pretty good. Very nice color, though it was thicker than I expected it to be. Will definitely try again.

This recipe is a good base, but as a complete curry recipe, not so great.  It didn't deliver the heat I want in a good curry, and it lacked that essential Thai flavor.  I doubled the curry paste & added some Thai chili sauce to heat it up some.  I also threw in some mushrooms & baby corn and substituted green bell pepper for the red.  I also added a healthy dose of fresh basil leaves from my garden.  About 10 leaves really gave the flavor a little boost & made it tast more authentic.

Very spicy.  My husband had to add a lot of soy sauce.  I added garlic and a little extra red curry paste.  I may serve it again.  The fresh cilantro was a great topper and made a nice presentation.

A bit tasteless. Perhaps I'm used to eating spicy red Thai, but this was very, very bland. I doubled the red curry paste and it was still tasteless.

I did follow the instructions, and it was edible, but didn't have the rich flavor to which I am accustomed when eating thai curries.  Needs a lot more spice and flavor, or the recipe itself is very bland.

It's a pretty decent recipe. I made it with onion, green beans, bell pepper, tofu and chicken. I added basil since it should be cooked with basil. I also doubled the curry paste and next time I would skip the cornstarch altogether. It gave it a weird texture.

I used full fat coconut milk, otherwise followed the recipe as written and thought it could have used more flavor. I used Thai Kitchen brand red curry paste - maybe it's not as spicy as other brands?

Love this recipe.  Use with chicken or shrimp.  I also add other veggies that I have on hand.  I also add ground coriander in place of the fresh cilantro.

I read all the reviews and doubled the curry paste, but something was still missing from the dish. I'm more of a minimalist, and love the simplicity of having just the veggies, but some minced garlic in with the chicken and coriander and red pepper flakes added with the red curry paste fixed it all up! Served it over jasmine rice, and it rivaled our favorite Thai place. Great recipe!

I made a few changes: -I added some salt, cayenne pepper, and a bit of a chili paste I had to the chicken before I cooked it. -I left out the bell peppers but added some sliced bamboo shoots (you can find this in a can usually in the Asian food isle.) -I didn't use light coconut milk, I had regular. I added that and added 1/2 can of water to it as well so it wouldn't thicken up too much, to0 fast. -Instead of cilantro, I chopped about 3 basil leaves and put them it--IT DEFINITELY MAKES A DIFFERENCE! -I also used baby carrots for the recipe, they make it so small and bite size.  I also wanted to add peas to it, but it slipped my head, so if anyone tries it-let me know how it comes out! :]  ENJOY!

Very good and easy to make.  Few changes: 1) rub chicken with curry powder night before.  2) Add Thai Chili Peppers for kick.  3) Use Thai Basil instead of cilantro

Really good recipe! I used 1/2 light and 1/2 regular coconut milk (all light is too soupy). Also used tofu instead of chicken. We only have small cans of Thai curry paste, and our can recipe says to use the whole thing so I always do. Perfect!

The texture of this recipe is great but it is lacking in flavor.  I tried adjusting the red chili paste from 1 tablespoon to 3 tablespoons still not enough flavor.

Very good.  Nice clean, fresh taste.  We upped the curry paste and added a scoop of peanut butter.  I think next time I will leave out the cilantro and we also added fresh lime juice and I won't do that again.  The cilantro and lime overpowered the rest of the flavors.  Husband loved it and that's always a plus!

There are much better curry recipes out there. The vegetables don't get cooked, the coconut milk doesn't mellow the curry, and the cornstarch is not needed.

By no means was this bad, it was actually very good. For some reason though, it did lack the flavor you usually get with restaurant Thai curry. I think the amount of curry paste you use depends on the brand. I bought some paste from my grocery store, it was one of those major brands that sells tons of packaged thai foods, etc. I put in one T and literally, there was no heat at all. I put in another T just for flavor, but still no heat. Guess my brand was mild. I don't like it hot, just a little bit of spice but mostly flavor. Next time, I'll add fish sauce and brown sugar. Perhaps another can of coconut milk as well to make it more saucy for the rice.

This is a 5 star recipe with a few additions...BEEF! Try it with Flank Steak!  Our additions: 2 T of Curry paste (not 1), 1 T Fish Sauce, 2 t. coriander, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 t. minced ginger, and SALT...it needs salt!  But...it was absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the baseline, and all the other reviews!

I have made this recipe 3 times now.  It's wonderful as is but I like a nice "punch" of spice.  I think found my perfect taste.  Along with the recipe, I use 3 good tablespoons of curry paste along with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and 3 tablespoons of fish sauce.  I omitted the zuccini and cornstarch and it was the perfect consistency.    Thanks for a great recipe, I feel like I'm in my favorite restaurant each time I make this dish.  Excellent!!!!

This curry was edible but there was almost no flavor. I followed the recipe as written, except I added more veggies and omitted the cornstarch. It was missing something- this is a good base for a curry, but you'd need to play around with adding ingredients to make it worthwhile.

This recipe was good as is.  I did make some changes, though.  As recommended by other reviewers, I added 1 Tbsp fish sauce, 1/2 tsp coriander, doubled the curry paste, added some fresh garlic and ginger, i put in some cubed potatoes (which i boiled first) instead of the carrots, and the most important part... a big ol' spoonful of peanut butter.  one of the other reviewers suggested this was the missing ingredient and i think she is right.  it really added a lot of flavor.  next time, i will skip the cornstarch, too.  i am not sure why a curry needs to be thick.  as it is written, it was good, but with these changes it was delicious!

I would have to agree with most other reviewers in saying this recipe needs an additional punch of flavor.  I do have another Thai Chicken Curry recipe that calls for fish sauce, lemon juice and garlic chili sauce.  I think adding those items, as well as perhaps some straw mushrooms and tomatoes, might enhance the flavor tremendously.  I personally also like baby corn in my Thai chicken curry dishes.  I think next time I'll combine both recipe ingredients and have a killer dish.

YUM. This was so freaking good! I served mine over Jasmine rice, and I wish I'd started the rice before I started prepping, because it came together so quickly that the rice was the part that took the longest! This seems like it would be very adaptable to whatever veggies and protein that you have handy. I can't wait to "play" with it.

This recipe was simple to make I like spicy so I did add just a little more red curry paste.  Also I used some ground ginger.  Overall I thought this was really good and will probably make again sometime.

Dud. I made this recipe as listed and it looked and smelled delicious but absolutely no flavor.  Next time I will add salt and maybe fry the curry paste. It is a good base but needs work to pull out some flavor.

I am reviewing this recipe even though I have tweaked it.  I realize there are some people who think a recipe needs to be made as written in order to be reviewed.  I am so glad that there are cooks who tweak and review and add their comments and reasons for the changes.  I followed many of the suggestions of other reviewers here to make this dish more flavorful and am pleased to report it was a big hit.  I am giving this four stars, because it was not "wonderful" for me until it was tweaked.  But I thank the submitter for the recipe and inspiration.

I agree this is a good quick starter and sometimes that's all you are looking for on work nights. I made this exactly as written and after tasting it I then decided it needed something.  I went ahead and added broccoli,  paprika, black molasses, brown sugar and a little extra red curry. Yum yum yum!!

Excellent dish! I do like a little more spice so I added more of the thai paste, some red pepper flakes, and curry powder. If I had sriracha I would've added that. Oh and I added garlic because garlic is a must in any dish. Put it over a bed of rice.

Good start.  Something is missing, spice wise.  I have eaten plenty of Thai food but haven't cooked much of it.  Not sure what this needs?

I was excited to try this recipe, but it was very disappointing. The dish did not have much flavor and seemed very watered down, even after adding more curry paste. A friend told me that a good curry paste can make a big difference, so maybe that was the problem.

this is pretty good and fast. it is missing something though, i added some shredded coconut while cooking and it elevated the flavour. i also cubed about a cup of fresh pineapple and stirred it in right before serving. enjoy.

We loved this! I will say that we put in 2 T of red curry paste and a couple of spoons of peanut butter and it was pretty spicy for the kids. Now I on the other hand coulda handled some more heat! We also added a dash of fish sauce. Left out the cornstarch all together. Used green peppers instead of red and didn't have any zucchini, so left that out too. I will definately be making this often!

This turned out to be so good... :-) Although I did add 7-8 lime leaves and some chopped lemongrass to the oil just before adding the chicken and the veggies. Also I did not find Coconut Milk and used Lite Coconut cream, diluted with water and skipped the cornstarch.. Yum with steamed Jasmine rice.. :-)

Almost right. As others had mentioned, a little bit of peanut butter makes all the difference. I used a tablespoon of unsweetened, unsalted organic peanut butter.

I really wish I could have been more generous but all things said, this recipe was a bit blah. Not the punch of authentic flavour I had hoped for. 

I followed the recipe to a T but before serving, I tasted it and found it severely lacking in flavour. I tried to add some fish sauce, some ginger and some salt but nothing could be done. If I had had a lime, I think the acidity would of benefited the dish but alas, I didn't. And as others have mentioned, the cornstarch was not necessary and threw off the texture. 

My husband and I are big fans of Gang Garee Gai so I was looking for a similar dish to make at home but this was not it. I'm pretty sure it will not get a repeat performance in my kitchen.

This is a great recipe.  We were stuck in a snow storm and didn't have all the ingredients, but after reading reviews, we had enough to improvise.  Added a minced 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, 2 large cloves of garlic, tripled the curry paste,  mushrooms instead of zucchini and no carrots.  We didn't have any coconut milk, so substituted half and half.  And, we forgot to add the cilantro!  But it came out fantastic!  I want to make it again with the coconut milk, but other than that we loved it the way it came out.  Thanks for posting this great recipe!  This is definitely something we'll be making again.

I had high hopes for this recipe and was really disappointed.  Especially since it smelled so good while it was cooking.  I did what several people recommended by doubling the red curry paste, adding fish sauce, coriander, sugar, and red peppers.  I was really surprised at how little flavor it had, especially after everything I added.  I can't imagine what it would have tasted like if I didn't do anything different.

Instead of the veggies called for, I used shrimp, potatos, tofu, onion and red pepper.  I used QUITE a bit of red curry paste and it still wasn't very spicy, probably 3.  The sauce was pink, not red.  It didn't taste too different than the regular curry I made, but my husband says they're not supposed to.  I'd never had red curry before.  This was pretty good, but if you want it spicy, I'd add red pepper flakes to the sauce while cooking and add 4 tablespoons of red curry paste.

My husband (who is not really a cook) made this for dinner last night.  It came out wonderful!  The only thing he changed was to omit the zucchini and add a can of bamboo shoots.  We also used a green pepper from the garden instead of a red one.  We served this over rice and had just enough to eat for lunch the next day.  Loved the coconut/cilantro combo!

Yummm... this is a great base recipe. I, like other reviewers, made some changes to boost the flavor. I added in some fish sauce and more than doubled the curry (it wasn't spicy curry though). I added in some peppers for heat. It's also great with a little bit of peanut butter.

I love Thai red curry (Gaeng Phed Gai), and this was a nice and quick recipe. I made some adjustments to make it more authentic. I used fish sauce for salt, and I added basil and lime leaves - and the vegetables that was in my fridge: carrots, peas, bell peppers and a tin of bamboo shots. If you don't get lime leaves, you can use zest and juice from one lime, or lemon grass. It's such a rich dish that I really think it needs some acid. But this was a nice starting point :-)

This was pretty good. Not bad for a basic curry recipie. I personally LOVE peanut butter. So I listened to another reviewer and added about 4-5 large tablespoons of it. It really gives it a nice flavorful kick. I also added red pepper flakes. Do not add too much cornstarch . It only needs a little and if you add too much like I did, it will taste like the darn stuff. I give this a 4!

I thought this was a great recipe! For anyone who loved this recipe, I would try using red onion instead of a white onion for a little added zing. Otherwise, I felt like I should be paying for this in a restraunt. Great stuff!

This was a fantastic recipe.  I too followed earlier suggestions and added fish sauce, fresh minced ginger & garlic, and the juice of two limes and tons of cilantro (I am a lime/cilantro freak!)  I also added in pineapple to please the little ones at the table.  Served w/ jasmine rice and a fresh fruit plate of mangoes, bananas, kiwi on the side.  Everyone gave rave reviews and I loved how easy it was to prepare.

I was disappointed with the flavor of this recipie.   I thought it sounded fabulous and tried it last evening.  It didn't have much taste to it.  Could it be the lite coconut milk?  I even used extra curry... If you like a mild tasting dish, then this may be for you but if you like a bold flavor - I would recommend making some changes.

My favorite dish of all time is Red Curry Chicken from a place called Lemongrass and I believe it is untouchable. I would say this is a 1 star compared to that. It could be that my standards are way too high, because of this reason, and if I had never had their Red Curry Chicken, I might have rated this recipe higher. So take that into consideration.

I thought this recipe came out great!  I doubled the amount of red curry paste and added some fresh basil.  I used regular coconut milk instead of "lite" and was pleased with the consistency.  I would definitely make this again.

Great recipe for basic curry.  However, all of the flavor comes from the curry paste, which is very spicy, so to add more flavor you must add more heat.  It needs other seasonings such as brown sugar and soy sauce to correct this as other people have mentioned.  Also, I use fried tofu in this recipe and whatever vegetables I have on hand or feel like.

Loved this recipe, even went on a kick for a while where we made it almost weekly! I prefer to skip the zucchini and instead add white onion.

This curry recipe works well, but I used Thai Kitchen paste and only needed one teaspoon.  Also, this recipe needs 1 1/2 Tbsp fish sauce for the right flavor.

Very tastey, just like a resturant. I added lime juice, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon corriander, 2 tablespoons sugar and some salt and pepper. I served it with couscous, a nice alternative to rice. Oh and used about 1/2 Tablespoon extra curry paste, wasnt too spicy at all. Will be making this again!

I set out to make this and it turned out great!  Only thing is that I thought I had Thai red curry paste and it was in fact, Thai red chili paste...given that I put in 2T of it along with 2T of powdered curry.  My next flub was at the  store I somehow got creme de coconut rather than 'milk'. (don't know what was going on that day) and it is thick but mixed a small amount of water to the cornstarch and somehow this was absolutely delicious!  Great texture and visual. thanks, maybe it will try it again as written, but maybe not.

Addendum: I made this again and added fish sauce, spicy Thai peanut sauce, roasted peanuts, cubed cooked potatoes, lime, garlic, sugar, and S & P. After the additions, I've upgraded my opinion of the dish from a 2-star to a 4-star.

I had high expectations for this recipe but was dissapointed. Even after adding the extra ingredients(lime, S & P, garlic, sugar) suggested by others, the dish was still missing something. I doubt that I will make it again unless I can figure out what to add to make it taste better - definitely did not taste like authentic Thai.

My girlfriend is Thai and I cook lots of Thai food.  This is something you would expect to get at a buffet to people that don't understand Thai food.  It was very bland and not spicy at all.  To try to salvage the dish, I had to add much more red curry, fish sauce, dried red peppers, and some lime.  It could be a Hamburger Helper recipe.

It was a good base recipe. I added summer squash, bamboo shoots, minced garlic, powdered coriander, fish sauce, 1 red potato, fresh ginger, a bit of lemongrass paste and chopped Thai basil. I omitted the carrots cilantro and red pepper because i do not like them. Made a lot of sauce so I took the cover off and let it evaporate some liquid.

No flavor!  I had to completely doctor this recipe to make it edible.  I doubled the curry paste, added a large clove of garlic, ground turmeric, curry powder, garam masala, cayenne pepper, ground coriander, lime juice, salt and pepper.

Did everything recipe and reviewers said.. I don't know how this has such good reviews; it makes me think that no one here has had truly amazing red curry to think this recipe is worth making. It was edible..nothing more.

This recipe was pretty good. It was missing something like everyone else was saying. I doubled the recipe and added extra Thai red curry paste. About 2 tablespoons total of4 since I doubled it. I also added a pinch of brown sugar. And salt and pepper on the veggies. No point in adding the corn starch I didn't add it and it was thick enough. Oh and use just regular coconut milk. And a around a tablespoon of peanut butter. And fresh garlic to the veggies Yummy it came out so good.

This was an awesome dish, however, don't double the curry paste when doubling the recipe. I enjoyed the heat and spice but others found it too spicy.

After reading several reviews, i tweaked it to my taste, added the peanut butter as recommended by hisdrinkoffering and must say it tasted pretty good. Gave it a 4 star cause the sauce got too thick. I will def. make it again and instead of adding cornstarch i will add chicken stock. I served it over boiled Basmati rice. Thanks for all the reviews and great tips and thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was excellent, used some ginger, and garlic plus a bit of lime juice to bring out more flavor.   Added a 1/2 tbs more of the curry paste and served over Jasmin Rice.  The entire family loved it~

Made with some of the changes suggested by other reviewers, this dish was so delicious!  I did the two tablespoons of red curry paste, because the sauce looked way too pale with just one tablespoon in there; I may even use more next time, it wasn't too spicy at all.  I also added a little bit of peanut butter, though I couldn't really taste it, so maybe I'll add more next time.  I used 2 Tbsp of fish sauce, as recommended, and some lime juice, coriander, and ginger.  I went with the regular coconut milk, but I think I will get the lighter kind next time, because the sauce was very creamy and I think I'd prefer it a little less so.  I used fresh basil instead of cilantro, though I'm sure it is yummy either way.  I was very happy with the way it turned out, and I'll definitely be making it again!

This is a great tasting easy meal! 
I added various spices I had in my cupboard and twice as much curry paste as the recipe called for (still wasn't very spicy), and green peppers instead of zucchini for colour. I only used a half pound of chicken and increased the amount of each vegetable by about a third for 2 good sized portions. Definitely more spice next time though.

Alot of the reviews were very helpful, I kinda just mixed and matched to what I thought would taste good. Used sesame oil, cooked a few cloves of garlic and a piece of ginger in the oil before adding the chicken. added potatoes/peanuts/peanut butter/fish sauece. couldn't find any coriander so added a little bit of store bought curry mix in. cooked chicken and onions for a few minutes before adding the rest of the veggies in and then let the whole simmer for 10-20 minutes on low heat. great great recipe, have been trying out a few recipes over the past few weeks and this is def the best so far.

This was only okay. Edible, but nothing to rave about. My kid and hubby wouldn't really eat it -- too spicy for them (and I only used 1 tbsp of curry.) I added peanut butter as someone suggested -- made the dish tan colored instead of pink or red. I also added coriander as someone suggested. Just wasn't a real "wow' factor and didn't really taste like red curries we get in thai or indian restaurants. Probably won't try again, but will try another curry recipe. I'm determined to find one we love.

Made this recipe last night never having made curry before. I had read the reviews first so I made it with 2 tbsp of fish sauce, 1 lime, and a couple dollops of peanut butter and upped the curry paste to 3 tbsp. I tasted it and it still wasn't spicy, I ended up adding at least 5 tbsp of curry paste along with about 2 tbsp of red pepper flakes and it was just barely hot. I'm used to eating curry that makes my eyes water! It was good but next time I'll know not to be stingy with the spices. Definitely going to make it again, my husband loved it!

I agree with many of the others that this recipe is pretty good but a little bland. I decided to first simmer some onion with garlic and cook the chicken in that with salt and pepper before adding it to the curry and coconut milk. Like others, I at least doubled the curry paste. I used jalepeno peppers instead of bell and added snow peas instead of zucchini. Also, because others suggested lime juice, I added lemon juice (didn't have lime juice) and finally added quite a bit of basil. After these additions, it was very good!!

Very bland (at least for my tastes) even going with the comments-recommended 2Tbsp, next time I'll taste and check and probably end up more around 4Tbsp. I added a chopped potato, a pinch of garlic, a spoonful of peanut butter, and put it over rice. Yum!

This is an excellent recipe.  Some of the things I've adjusted include removing the cilantro and zucchini.  Instead I've replaced it with bamboo shoots.  They don't go soft and mushy like the zucchini.  As well I doubled the curry paste (or more depending on how much I'm making).  I've also tried a version with potatoes as well. Oh and if you don't have a red bell pepper try a yellow one. The extra sweetness give is a good blend with the heat from the curry.

I added extra curry paste, as well as turmeric, coriander, salt, sriracha, and chili paste. I would skip the cilantro next time though, and I would skip the lime that I added next time too. The cilantro and lime seemed to go against the flavors of the coconut milk. With the extra rice that I made to go with it, I added coconut milk, sugar, and corn starch to make dessert.

Very yummy. Instead of zuccini, I used carrots and celery. I also added a few raisins and coconut. Next time I would add a little more red curry paste - it was hard to taste it.

This curry was good but definitely lacking flavor.  The light coconut milk makes it a bit runny so perhaps next time I'll add more cornstarch and add extra curry and crushed red pepper to give it more of a kick.  Overall easy to make.

I was trying to duplicate a Thai Red Chicken Curry that I had at Asian Bistro and this came very close. The first time I made it I did not have Thai red curry paste so I used Indian red curry paste and added some sriracha sauce for heat. Still tasted pretty good but was more authentic the next time when I used the Thai red paste. Even w/o the cilantro on hand, I still love this recipe. Very easy for those of us new to Thai food and with no access to authentic Thai ingredients.

I loved this recipe, although I did have a few things to add. I doubled the amount of curry paste (plus added jalapenos and some cayenne for some serious heat). I love the sweetness of Thai curry, but my taste for this dish tends toward the acidic. To help with this, I added the juice of 1 lime PLUS about 2 tablespoons of rice wine vinegar. I found that this adds a kick that it was otherwise lacking. Another change I made was adding green onion, water chestnuts, and a generous amount of Thai Basil (any type of basil would be acceptable, however). I kind of like the idea of the peanut butter, although I do think it adds a little too much sweetness. As far as spices go, I added about 1 teaspoon of Indian Yellow Curry spice to the dish. I found that it created a little more depth to the flavor of the curry, although it's a tad unconventional. Also, garlic is a must! In my opinion, experiment with the flavors, taste often, and have fun!

This recipe is good but not great. I did change it up a bit but it still needed something for flavor. I used baby corn, mushroom, carrots and red pepper. I also added basil and more curry than this called for, about 2 tablespoons instead of one. Also, used Jasmine rice for a base.

was dissappointed in lack of flavor - but that could be because of the brand of curry paste i used.  i think that the veggies need to cook separate from chicken as my meat was shredded from stirring by time the veggies were done.   finally, the sauce was not enough for the quantity of veggies suggested.  so sorry!

This was pretty good. I followed everyone's advice and added the extra curry and lime and 2tsp sugar. I also put in 1/2 tbs of curry powder by accident and garlic salt.  I still think it's missing something sweet but it's definitely not peanut butter..lol. Maybe I'll put 3tsp sugar next time.

i am trying to duplicate the recipe that our local thai restaurant (old siam) uses to make their panang red curry chicken.  the sauce is addictive.  for everyone who says something is missing, i can assure you it is peanut sauce.  there is a recipe on here for thai peanut butter sauce.  it is FABULOUS!  by the way, if you can find JASMINE rice, use that instead of long grain rice.  also instead of adding a handful of whole peanuts, add finely crushed peanuts after it is cooked, stir them into the mixture. you can crush them in a food processor, maybe a blender. noodles with peanut sauce and finely crushed peanuts is another really yummy thai dish as well.

Awesome recipe.  So rich and satisfying!  I used sesame oil instead of olive oil and I added a little fish sauce for umami.  I also put my cilantro and onions through the food processor. Some of the other photos looked too chunky and, for lack of a better word, "gross."  I thought the consistency of my sauce was perfect.

I used shrimp instead of chicken, since I forgot to defrost. I also added at least another tablespoon of curry paste as well as a tablespoon of fish sauce. (Forgot about the minced garlic suggestion, but I will add that next time as well.) This was an excellent dish! I know I will be making this often, instead of going out to dinner for my curry cravings now!

Something just isn't right with this recipe. I've had it at several different Thai restaurants and it usually tastes similar from restaurant to restaurant, but not this recipe. I think the cornstarch was weird and I could taste it. Also, it wasn't red enough. I had to add a lot of curry paste. Needs work.

As just a dish on its own, though, it wasn't bad, but this recipe isn't authentic at all. I felt that the flavor was very weak and there were just certain flavors from an authentic Thai red curry that I missed (ie. fish sauce, lemon grass, etc.)  It tasted fine, and it was very easy and quick to make. Just don't hope for authenticity!

I read all the reviews and took a few suggestions.  I added 3 cloves of garlic, 1 tbls grated ginger, 1 tbls fish sauce, 2 tbls creamy peanut butter, & 1-1/2tbl of red curry.  I didn't add any zucchini/carrots either. It came out ok for me.  However my husband was raving about it so that's why I gave it 4 stars.  All in all a nice recipe w/modifications.

You will only have success with this recipe if you yous Mae Ploy red curry base - or any other WITHOUT added tomato paste. Otherwise, if you love Thai food its best to take the extra time earlier in the week and make your own.

Otherwise, its just too bland. I added extra ginger, fish sauce, soy sauce, red peppers...and FRESH GROUND coconut milk (which did add flavor) but just not the same as the Thai resteraunt...

We were very disappointed with this recipe.  After reading reviews stating that it is similar to what one would get in a Thai restaurant, I guess I had too high of expectations.  I would receive a much tastier dish at my local Thai restaurant.  My husband and I felt that it was very bland.  I followed the recipe and added some additional ingredients that were mentioned it in the review.

Good recipe.  I thought it was a bit bland with only one tablespoon of curry paste, so I upped it to 2-3, and it was still mild.  I ended up dumping some crushed (super hot) pepper flakes over the top which enhanced the flavor.  Good curry should make your forehead sweat!  I also used canned bamboo shoots and green pepper instead of the zucs.  Definitely will make again!

I made the recipe as-is & didn't like it.  I then added 2 more tblspn red curry, 2 tsp sugar & 1 clove garlic.  It was okay. I bought a lime but forgot to add, I will do that tomorrow with leftovers. Doesn't taste near as good as my local thai places.

I've made this twice and it is excellent. The only change was more curry and I added a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter.

I am giving this 5 stars, although I altered the recipe for my taste. I used a bag of frozen veggies (red bell pepper, sugar snap peas, carrots and onions) which made the prep easier. I have made this twice now and liked it much better the second time. The second time I used regular coconut milk instead of lite. It gave the dish a creamier texture and richer taste. I used about 1 TBSP of "A Taste of Thai" brand red curry paste the second time and it was just right for me, although too spicy for my kids. I enjoyed this dish very much and LOVE the smell as it is cooking!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!!  I did add a approx. 1 teaspoon of corriander and sugar and salt and pepper. I served it with couscous the first evening and rice the next. Both were great with this sauce.

I took most of the peoples advise and doubled the amount of curry.  WOW!!  I love spicy spicy food but this was too much.  The only thing I could think of doing to cut the spice was to keep adding chicken stock and turn it into a soup.  At least it didn't go to waste.

I made this recipe after reading some of the other reviews so I made the additions of the fish sauce, sugar, cumin, lime juice, ginger, garlic and salt.  I didn't have any zucchini and didn't feel it would go well with the dish so I added some green onion instead.  I also felt there was something missing and it was barely spicy so I added some red pepper flakes but will be adding more curry paste next time.  I also plan to use less coconut milk.  It was too rich and the aroma and taste of the coconut wasn't balanced out enough by the other ingredients in the dish.  Maybe adding more of other types of vegetables next time will do the trick.  Overall, a good dish but it just needs a little tweaking.

Very good overall. I found the coconut taste a little bit overpowering and would only use about half myself.  Great over rice!

my friend made this for me and it was delicious!  She also said it was easy to make.  She used Garlic and Olive Oil Cous cous to mix with it, and just before serving added just a dollap of sour cream.  Yummy!  i think the sour cream added a little something extra. i would make this.  it was very good!

Wonderful!  I made this for the first time and LOVED IT!  I bought mild red curry paste which was very mild... hardly even a bite.  So I add a hot red pepper after removing seeds and slicing it open.  I through it in with the coconut milk step and removed it before serving.  It gave the dish a bit more kick.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Try it even if you have never cooked with curry before... this was my first time.

First, I don't think it's necessary to double the curry in this recipe. It is very spicy. Also, it is really bland. I didn't know a dish could be both very spicy and very bland, but this one did it. I even added garlic, coriander, and cumin. I did not have a lime so I could not try lime juice as others had recommended. I will not make this again.

The recipe is a good foundation. Double the Red curry. Added peanut butter, fresh bean sprouts, cilantro and basil. 
Served with Thai Carrot Salad and rice.

I added extra curry paste, a little lemon grass, ginger, and turmeric. Plus some cauliflower instead of the peppers because that's what I had on hand. It was a little runny because I made it in the instant pot. The flavor was good.

Substituted beef for chicken and bamboo shoots instead of zucchini.  I was satisfied with this dish however, as I prefer it more spicy, I should have used maybe 2 tablespoons of curry paste instead of one.  That being said, I will definitely make this again.  Thanks very much!

I made this with only two minor changes - I omitted the cilantro due to a guest disliking anything with cilantro in it, and I used about the amount of red curry paste shown in the video rather than the 1 Tbsp. as called for in the recipe.

Having mentioned my changes, I have to say this was delicious. The chicken was cooked just right, the veggies were tender but not mushy, the sauce was delicious. I served it over Jasmine rice which added a little something to the flavor.

The next time I make it, and there WILL be a next time, I will include the cilantro and perhaps add a little cayenne or perhaps some sriracha for some heat. I liked the sauce so much that I think I will double the sauce ingredients the next go round.

Also, I wonder if this recipe would work well with shrimp instead of chicken - I'm imagining it with some large locally caught fresh shrimp. Mmmmmm! And Basmati rice might do even better than Jasmine. 

My thanks to TheKnackered for sharing this recipe.

I made this a few weeks ago.I would like to thank and give feedback to one of the comments re "missing ingredient". I followed what she added: a T of fish sauce, regular coconut cream and potatoes and finally, a dollop or 2 of creamy peanut butter.It turned out very good. My husband is not a fan of curry but this he really liked. Will definitely make this again.

This is a really nice recipe that turned out great. I tasted the sauce and ended up doubling the chili paste, but you really should taste it first to see what you like. I salted it slightly before serving it on rice and we loved it. It’s an easy recipe to double.

Pretty quick and easy. You will want to kick it up by doubling the red chili paste and adding a little red pepper flake.

I only substituted a shallot for the onion, because that’s what I had on hand. This is a great recipe! I will definitely make this again. It really needs no substitutions. And I added some sliced mushrooms, because I had them.

The chicken was a little bland so next time I will marinate the chicken or sauté it.  I would add more cilantro definitely and some hot chili peppers plus some salt.  Other than that, I enjoyed the recipe and I had all the ingredients in the house to make it.

I agree with hisdrinkoffering that it needs peanut butter- excellent advice! I also added 2ish oz tomato paste (I wanted a red curry) and the little can size of bamboo shoots and then, basically, devoured this without breathing.

Even with the other reviewers suggestions of lime, ginger and lemongrass, this recipe was extremely bland. Not worth trying.

Really good. Next time I will most likely remove the chicken and saute the vegetables until soft. I will then add the chicken back in and finish the curry. The vegetables were a bit raw with the times given.

Made this recipe fairly close to exact. Changes I made were omitting the carrots and adding broccoli (taste preference) using 2 tablespoons of red curry paste instead of 1, and adding 1 tablespoon of fish sauce. Salt and peppered to taste. Served over white basmati rice. This was really good and very easy to make!!

This recipe was very good, but like most other reviewers, not spicy enough for me.  I doubled the curry, but will probably add more next time.  I didn't have zucchini, so I substituted fresh green beans and also added garlic and lime juice, as others suggested.  Thai basil as a garnish is a good substitute for cilantro.  Chopped roasted peanuts or cashews can be sprinkled on top just before serving.

We enjoyed this recipe. I added 1 Tbsp of fish sauce, some fresh ginger and garlic. I also stir fried the chicken in sesame oil for extra flavour. You can add any vegetables you like!

We loved this recipe! It's good as written, but the 2nd time I made it, I added minced garlic and ginger to the salted/peppered chicken when I sautéed it. I added more veggies to it too, which I cut up first and combine, trying to make it colorful. We like a little heat to it, so I mince up a jalapeño to put in the veggies and a few red pepper flakes, plus I almost double the curry paste. This recipe will be part of my weekly menu!

The recipe has no flavor as it is, despite adding extra curry. I then added a few things as other recipes suggested: coriander, fish sauce, brown sugar, and a dollop of peanut butter. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper which gave it some heat. With the additions it was delicious! Thanks for the base recipe and the helpful reviews!

I made it with tofu; still good.  The flavors blended well, especially the cilantro, but it was even better the second day, when the flavors had had a chance to meld.

Quick easy and tasty. I agree with others who said it's a bit bland,so I kicked it up a notch with some red pepper flakes.  I also prefer a slightly "soupier"  red curry sauce sauce, so will use maybe half the cornstarch recommended in the recipe. 

Still, all in all a good dish and it's been added to my saved recipes. Thanks!

Add the sugar and fish sauce. Follow video. My modifications are  I used 1/2 Red pepper and 1/2 green.  3tbsp of red curry and only 1/2 onion and a bit more of the zucchini and carrots then what recipe calls for. Oh and I used no corn starch. I used whole coconut milk not light. Dish was yummy!

This recipe is delicious with a little tweaking. I used full coconut milk,  bamboo shoots and water chestnuts. No carrots. I added a little brown sugar, garlic, ginger, salt, a little sesame oil and 3 tablespoons of red curry paste. I will make this again, and next time I may use a little fish sauce.  I didn't use any cornstarch. If you use full coconut milk you don't really need it.  This is a simple base recipe that you could really play with.

This was so bland, tasteless actually.  I boosted the red curry paste to 3 heaping tablespoons and added 1/2 tsp crushed chilies to give it some zip.  Don't think I will make it again.

It is somewhat bland, but nothing a little Siracha can't fix. I found myself using 2 tablespoons of the red curry paste instead of 1 and still desiring more flavor. Mushrooms would be a good addition to this recipe as well

Try making it with boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breast so much more juicy meat. I also use way more curry paste usually yhe whole small can.

It's a delicious and fast prep with the mandolins. The chicken cooked in no time having been cut in strips. The taste is scrumptious with a little salt & pepper at the end. It's beautiful to look at and eat. Bon appétit!

This is a very good recipe  And with additions I made based on other reviewer's comments, it's a 5 star recipe. I used sesame oil and browned minced garlic and shredded ginger  root for a few minutes, then added the chopped onion and let that brown a few minutes before adding the chicken. After the chicken cooked through, I added all the vegetables (I always shred my carrots because they cook faster)..  I also mixed TWO tablespoons of the red curry paste, with a 1/3 of a can of organic full fat coconut milk, juice from 1/2 of a lime, and a couple teaspoons of fish sauce.   After putting in this sauce, I added the rest of the coconut milk and simmered everything for about 10 minutes; I sprinkled about a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce but this can be left out to keep this recipe Whole30 compliant..  I provided a wedge of lime for each diner, and topped the dish with cashews for added flavor., and made rice to soak up the sauce.  It was very yummy! This will become a staple in my house!

I added minced garlic and sautéed with the vegetables along with extra Thai red curry paste.  Then added red pepper flakes and Fish Sauce while simmering with the cooked veggies and chicken.  This made a huge difference.  
Also, I only used carrots, celery and onions for the veggies making it paleo acceptable.  No cornstarch needed.

Will for sure make this again, the zucchini and red peppers added a nice crunch. I would skip the peanuts next time they made the sauce a little too cloying rich, but otherwise perfection.

I doubled the Red Curry Paste and it still tasted blah!  I added chili powder sparingly and still no kick!  I added Galangal spice, not much difference.  I think the Coconut milk tamps it down too much.  Probably will remove it from my favorites.

I was so excited for this and when it was done I was so disappointed! The sauce is so bland! After a few tweaks though, it definitely tasted better. Luckily, I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before I cooked it so that gave the chicken extra flavor. I added a little salt, cumin and curry powder to the sauce and that really kicked up the flavor!

This was very flavorful, although it did not have any heat.  I tripled the curry paste, and my daughter (who loves hot curry) thought it was still way too mild.    I like my curry medium, and I had to agree.   I substituted tofu for the chicken.

Made this as is for the first time. Certainly missing something. Next time, I won't use lite coconut milk. And I'm thinking sub out a quarter of it for chicken broth and add lime juice as some suggested. Extra curry paste would burn the tongue off!

This was OK. I added all the extra things that people in the reviews suggested, including sesame oil, fish sauce, plus extra garlic and ginger at the beginning and some lime at the end. One person (who doesn't like peanut sauce) didn't like the small amount of peanut butter I added. That's nothing against the recipe, but not something they expected from a red Thai curry. They did like the cashews sprinkled on top. It was not hot, so maybe I should have added more curry paste than was in the recipe, I'm not sure. Perhaps it was the quality of the paste that I used, but I've definitely had better results other times in making curry with this paste, but that may have been due to the addition of kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass and thai basil, which I didn't have on hand this time.

This is a great recipe! So easy to make! I did use more curry paste than the recipe calls for probably 2/3 tbs I added then tasted and added then tasted to make sure it wouldn't be too hot for my kids. I also added a little lime juice. If I was cooking for another heat lover I would have added more! I made it late afternoon and just reheated a bit at dinner time. Loved it!

I took a bunch of different suggestions on here and put them together and it turned out great! Here it is: Thai Red Curry RecipeCube 1 potato - boil until softenedIn a bowl, mix together 1/3 can of coconut milk, 1/2 tsp coriander powder, 2 T Curry paste, 2 T Fish sauce, 1 T Brown sugar, 2 T melted peanut butter, and 1 tsp lime juice. Heat 1 T sesame oil over medium high heat. Add cloves minced garlic and 1 tsp minced ginger - sauté for a few minutes. Salt and pepper chicken and add to sauté. Add cubed potato, 1 sliced onion, 1 carrot sliced, 1/2 orange pepper and 1/2 red pepper sliced and sauté with chicken, garlic, and ginger. Add mix from bowl and pour over chicken. Add remainder of coconut milk. Boil then simmer over medium heat with lid off until desired consistency reached. **** Next time I may add some more ginger and peanut butter.

I have made curry using this recipe many times. It is a good base recipe, but I recommend doing the following for better flavor: double the amount of curry paste, use full fat coconut milk. Without these steps the recipe is somewhat bland.

I like curry but my husband isn't a big fan. I too felt it was missing something. I thought the spice was good, not too much. I used coconut oil instead of olive oil. Maybe next time I'll add some sesame oil and/or fish sauce. I also liked the idea of adding peanut butter. I keep peanut butter powder in the house so next time I'll mix up some peanut butter powder with a little honey to cut some of the spice and maybe garnish with chopped peanuts.

Good but a little bland. And personally I would have not added the corn starch because I like the curry a little thinner. Siracha on top added good kick though.

This is a good basic recipe but like others said, definitely needed some tweaks to make it more flavorful!! I doubled the curry paste, added some fish sauce like others suggested, lime juice, salt and pepper, ginger and garlic and a dash of sriracha to add some more spice! Served over rice it was a hit!

I used this recipe solely as a guide in my first time making curry. I prepared it differenty, though kept to the same ingredients.  What i did different was saute the veggies first so as to not have anything burning in the bottom of my pan (chicken tends to stick when cooked, and if you add the chicken before veggies you won't get long enough to saute them before adding curry paste and coconut milk). After sauting veggies I removed to plate and seared my thin sliced chicken breast with sesame oil and some veggie oil. Just enough to keep the pan bottom from sticking/burning. Once chicken is seared add back veggies and a bunch of curry paste. I found my curry paste to be incredibly weak so used about 4 tablespoons mixed an equal amount coconut milk for ease of mixing. Used just a pinch of corn starch for consistancy, added some chili powder for even more kick (still was not spicy enough -.-) and brought to boil. After boil bring to simmer and serve with rice on the side. I have been told by Thai people never to put the rice in the curry, after trying both ways I agree rice goes on the side. Wish I had fresh cilantro to put in it, guess I gotta make it again!

This is a good base recipe but as others have said, it definitely needs more flavor. I added ginger slices, oyster sauce (1T), fish sauce (1/2T), and chinese sweet sausage. Next time, I would bump these up and still add more – straight up sugar, basil, and lime juice.

I always read through reviews first to find the improvements and this recipe is simple but will be bland as is. I added extra red curry paste, coriander, curry, salt, pepper, lime juice, & fish sauce to the sauce and simmered. I tasted sauce until I felt it had developed enough flavor. I added soy sauce, coriander, salt, pepper, and fresh minced ginger to vegetables. I added minced garlic to hot oil for chicken with a little salt, pepper, and coriander sprinkle. Also from my experience, traditional restaurant style curry dishes are very saucy with rice (jasmine is nice) on side to add as you go to each bite. This has a lot of chunk to maintain soupy sauce so you might consider doubling the sauce. Lite coconut milk was just fine. Enjoy!

Made for the second time;    First time followed recipe pretty faithfully.   This time used broccoli and asparagus. Both times only needed to add a touch of salt.   For two people we had plenty served over basmati rice plus leftovers for lunch.   Delicious and will definitely keep this on a monthly recipe rotation!     Yummmm

This was a recipe that sounded good and ended tasting delicious. Did not have cilantro but it still tasted good.  You really have to love coconut to appreciate this dish. Made a half batch recipe and added a little more red curry.  Will cook again.

I love this recipe! Additions made by other reviewers are Ok but not essential to a great flavor; in fact adding  garlic, fish sauce, etc. make it a different recipe altogether! The recipe as is is simple and just like the red curry I order at my favorite expensive  thai restaurant. I'll have to come up with another dish to order! One thing I do to lighten things up a bit is cut the canned coconut milk by 1/3 and add coconut milk from a carton to taste. I also avoid the corn starch since I like it watery. Wonderful!

This recipe turned out delicious. I added a little more curry and hot paste on the table for those that like it with a little more heat. The cilantro on top was perfect. Fresh basil is a great addition as well.

Quick and easy.  Had a passable Thai curry ready as quick as my rice cooker could pump out a few cups of rice.  I added 2 cloves of garlic, crushed and mince to the chicken while it sautéed.  I also will double the curry paste next time though an adjustment with scirracha sauce pretty much saved the day. Ignore the "quarter, then half the onion." Chunk it down to bite size so it will cook just a hair more thoroughly. Crunch is necessary, but undercooked is not good.  Overall good, but next time or the time after I'll master this.

*next time addition:  used peanut oil, double the curry paste, added a tablespoon of peanut butter and some crushed cashews.  Perfecto, better than a restaurant.

I agree this was wanting in the flavor department, even after I added garlic, doubled the curry paste, and added cilantro and red pepper flakes at the end.  Rather than altering this until unrecognizable, I'll probably just look for another recipe.

I only had green curry so substituted that.  Also used sesame oil to cook the garlic then added chicken.  As another reviewer suggested to make it easier to mix with the chicken/veggies, combine in a small bowl the cornstarch, some regular coconut milk, curry paste, 1/3 t coriander, 2 t peanut butter, 2 T fish sauce, fresh ground pepper, and 3 t sugar.   Added water chestnuts and bamboo.  Would definitely make again!

After I read the reviews, I added some ginger powder garlic powder fish sauce and sesame oil as had been suggested, and served over rice. It was virtually tasteless so I added some flaked coconut and sliced almonds.  This was the only thing that made it somewhat palatable. I will not be making this again.

This is a great base recipe but after tasting it I did find it a little bland so I followed other reviewer suggestions by adding: doubled the curry paste, about 1 T of creamy PB, 1 T fish sauce, and a good drizzle of Sriracha (we like it hot). I also added some fresh ginger too (instead of ground ginger) which made a difference and a little goes a long way. This goes great with either white or brown rice. Adding fresh basil at the end is awesome too! I finally have my Thai fix at home!!

Disagree with these instructions. The recipe is fine, but veggies should be precooked or go in way in advance. I had to pick the chicken out after realizing this and continue cooking the veggies. 
I also think the sauce can use a little more red curry flavor, but that's a personal preference. If served over rice I'd recommend 2 tbsp, not 1 of red curry paste.

Thanks for providing a great base recipe! We liked it better after we added more thai curry paste, fish sauces, soy sauce, ginger and lots of basil instead of cilantro. I think our curry paste wasn't as spicy as usual. It didn't have the heat this dish usually has when I've made it before.

Even after adding extra red curry paste, the flavour was very bland.

I will make this again, however, even with the additional ingredients "hisdrinkoffering" suggested in her revision, it still needed more flavor and was a bit thick.  I added 1 cup water, 8 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms, 1 tsp. curry, 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper.  After those additions were made, it had a scrumptious flavor and seemed complete to me. Thank you for your base recipe!

I added garlic and ginger to the skillet and doubled the red thai curry paste (Thai Kitchen).  It would have made a 1/2 pepper at my favorite thai place.  Lacked salt, heat and flavor.

I gave this recipe a 4 but partly because of how quick and easy it is.  It is definitely very bland if you just stick with the recipe, so I added about 1/2 tsp of Garam Masala, 3/4 tsp curry powder, about a teaspoon of hot sesame chili oil, and some ground pepper.  Big difference! I also added some garlic and turmeric to the white rice, so that brought a little more flavor to the meal as well.  Super easy!

I added: chopped garlic, sugar, Thai fish sauce, Thai basil, kafir lime leaves, a squeeze of fresh lime juice and siracha sauce... THEN it had some pretty good flavors going on. I also added more red curry paste and hardly used any cornstarch. When I was done adding all of the extra stuff, it was super yummy!

This would probably work with a lot of tweaking.  Ok base. 

I took some of the suggestions in past reviews. And added .sesame oil,  lime juice,  cumin, peanut butter, garlic and upped the curry paste.

For those that found the flavor a bit "bland"; add some Thai peanut sauce or you can even make some to add. I eat this dish every time we visit the Thai House; it's nice to know I can make it at home now! I also combine mine with Jasmine Rice which can be found at any Wal-mart or local grocery store.

Very good, but I did have to make a couple of adjustments.  I used 3 tbsp. of red curry paste and 2 tbsp. coconut sugar.  Also, the meat and veggies needed to cook longer.  I will make it again, and maybe next time try green curry paste.  A tasty and healthy meal!

Amazing!!! In addition to cilantro I add a little chiffonade basil (Thai basil is best, but regular basil works just as well) and a few squeezes of fresh lime juice and voila!!!! Delicious!

This was so good! I took other reviewers suggestions and added fresh garlic, 1T coriander, juice of 1 lime, 1T sugar, and 2T fish sauce. It was AMAZING with those additions. Also, I used almost 3T of curry paste, and it wasn't too spicy at all. Great base recipe, thanks so much!!

I made this last night and after following the recipe to the letter, needed to doctor it up at the end. It was quite bland and as others noted, was lacking "something." Even after adding more of the red curry paste, a little more salt, cayenne to spice it up, I couldn't determine what that missing something was. My local favorite Thai restaurant is what inspired me to make this at home and I have decided it needs fresh lime juice and more cayenne. A good basic recipe from which to start though, so thank you! I was the picky eater, everyone else enjoyed it!

I made this the last 2 nights! I followed the recipe to a tee the first night. I agree with some of the comments that it wasn't spicy enough (I usually eat my Thai at level 3 and this was barely a 1). Also, it didn't have enough coconut milk, so I did the following:

1) doubled the coconut milk
2) tripled the red curry paste 
3) added 4 Tablespoons of red chili paste (to add heat)
4) added 2 Tablespoons of minced garlic
5) ...and added 2 Tablespoons of "fish and meat" sauce. This is thick like an A1 almost, but added great flavor.

It was amazing!!! I served it over jasmine rice and was perfect, so now I'll be having Thai weekly :)

I made this dish with some changes as recommended by other reviewers and enjoyed it very much.  Definitely use sesame oil and saute some fresh ginger and fresh garlic in the oil before you saute the chicken.  In a separate bowl, I mixed all the wet ingredients, added fish sauce and some peanut butter, and I did not use 'light' coconut milk - I used full strength - and then poured the mix over the chicken and vegetables.  Next time I make this, I am definitely going to double the sauce.

Not as good as expected. Need to add a lot more curry and spice as this is bland in the amount called for. I'm a novice with curry recipes, so I didn't expect to have to add so much more curry paste.

This was good. My modifications: Used asparagus instead of zucchini, didn't have cilantro, and I used only 1/2 of the curry paste because I was afraid. It gave it a little kick, but not too much. I think the full amount would have been a little too spicy for me.

I need to try this recipe as written. Tried to use the suggestion of sprouts, peanut butter and fish sauce. Big mistake with peanut butter and I only use potatoes for yellow curry... don't know if the other reviewer was joking. And I think the corn starch was a mistake.

This is a great base recipe. I added baby corn, bean sprouts and a T of chili sauce to give it some kick. Delish over white rice and tasted better the next day.

Great recipe. Did make some changes. Doubled most veggies, liquid and seasonings. Used sesame oil and garlic when sauteing per other reviews. Served with rice for guests, but ate as a stand alone for myself. Totally yummy! Will make again. May tone it down with yellow curry for guests. Also, left out the cilantro.

Using reviewers' variations, I turned this recipe into Red Curry Baked Chicken with Stirfried Veggies.My recipe:
2 Tbsp. Thai red curry paste
2 (14 oz.) cans lite coconut milk
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 Tbsp. ginger, grated
4 Tbsp. fish sauce
Juice of 2 limes
1 Tbsp. smooth peanut butter
1 Tbsp. sugar
1 tsp. salt
1 Tbsp. sesame oil
1 large onion, quartered & halved
1 cup sliced carrots
2 cup sliced halved zucchini
2 bell peppers, seeded & sliced into strips
8 oz. mushrooms, sliced
4 lb. skinless chicken parts 
3 Tbsp. cornstarch
4 Tbsp. chopped cilantro
Preheat oven to 375.
In a medium bowl, add the curry paste, coconut milk, garlic, ginger, fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and salt. Mix well.
Place the chicken pieces in a baking dish. Pour the curry paste mixture over all the pieces of chicken, covering all the pieces with mixture. Bake for 30-45 minutes, then turn pieces over and bake for an additional 15 to 20 minutes until chicken is done. 
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion;stir fry until translucent. Add carrots, zucchini, bell pepper, & mushrooms. Stir fry until almost done. Keep chicken warm while you finish cooking the vegetables.
Remove about 1 1/4 cups of sauce from the chickens. Add 3/4 cups of the sauce to the vegetables while they finish cooking. Place cornstarch in a small bowl. Add remaining 1/2 cup sauce to cornstarch, stirring well. Pour over vegetables;stir well & allow to thicken.
Sprinkle cilantro over chicken;serve.

This is a great base recipe but you'll need to spice it up.  I like to add sweet potato to my curry but the cook time is so quick that I recommend boiling anything that dense prior to beginning this recipe, unless you like crunchy veggies.  If you like spicey - 1 tbs of red curry paste is most definitely not enough (unless you happen to find some atomic paste).  I do like spicey food so take that into consideration (but not ghost pepper hot).

I found this recipe bland. I started doctoring it on the stove while it was still cooking.  I added 3 times the red curry paste, smoked paprika, yellow curry powder, cayanne powder, and at the table we added soy sauce.  It was finally to the point that we liked it.  I should also mention that I didn't have zucchini, so I substituted fresh asparagus.  I am not one of those people who likes really spicy HOT food, but that is just what it took to make it similar to our Thai restaurant.  I didn't read the other reviews, but as I'm writing this the comments above seem to be saying the same thing.  Good but it needed kicked up a notch for us.  It is a good starting point.

I was so excited to make this recipe but to my dismay it was "Bland" as the other reviews stated.  I used extra fish sauce, minced garlic, two garlic cloves,ginger,cayenne pepper, cilantro,bamboo,zuchini,fire roasted dice garlic tomatoes,potates (boiled them first) and bean sprouts. I even added a sprinkle of salt. I did not have enough courage to add peanut butter as some of the reviews stated.  Perhaps someone can share an idea of what else could be missing???

I just made this tonight and it was a let down. It's ok but it's definitely missing something. Next time I think I'll see what the reviews are before I make something.

The recipe was too bland as written. I added some shredded romano cheese, 2 cans of coconut milk, more curry paste and Sriracha Sauce. Most of my family was happy with it after these additions.

this recipe is basic and super easy to jazz up! i used maybe double the amount of curry paste, as well as a lot more vegetables, some coriander, and some chili powder. I also used three or four cloves of garlic, and basil instead of cilantro. I served this over thai rice noodles and it was absolutely delicious!

Made this recipe exactly how it says, and were disappointed. The sauce is very bland. We added garlic powder, black pepper, salt, lime, and more curry paste. I still could have used more flavor. Also, we had two people working on this recipe and it took us more like an hour than 20 minutes. If you really want this fast, chop all of the veggies ahead of time.

Loved all of the fresh veggies in this curry, but found the flavor lacking, even after tripling the curry.  Maybe adding a bit of fish sauce, some thai basil?  Thank you for sharing your recipe with AR, I enjoyed trying it.

Better than the stuff you buy in the can. Great basic recipe to start with, but even still, don't make it plain. The consistency of the sauce was good, but there was still something flat in the taste and I couldn't quite put my finger on it. A few others said crunchy peanut butter does the trick, which is probably the case, but we have an allergy in the family so we had to leave it out. I added 1 tsp fish sauce, but next time I would have done 2 tsp because it wasn't salty/savory enough (probably because I left out the onion—onion powder, garlic, cayenne pepper and/or paprika at very least are a must!) So many flavors to blend. You can add pineapple and basil too. For more spiciness, don't depend on more curry paste: go for the big guns and do chili.

Not bad. I think the star rating is appropriate.  This is a good base recipe that will give you the structure you need to experiment a little.  I agree with the comment of the other cooks that there is something missing with this recipe.

I added fish sauce and used full coconut milk with no cornstarch.  I also added snap peas and fish sauce.  I was going to add some crunchy almond butter (i didn't have peanut butter) as the previous reviewer suggested but I completely forgot.  It was still good and I will most likely make it again but experiment a little more.

This recipe was a great base to a tasty dish. I added SALT, more red curry paste & 2 tablespoons of chilli garlic sauce. Optional extras were sliced asparagus & mushrooms followed by fresh basil instead of cilantro. Yum! Served with brown or white rice :)

It was a good started recipe but as is was not the best. Made it per the recipe the first time and it needed more flavor. I used whatever veggies I had left over in the fridge, garlic, fish sauce, and more red curry paste. I left out the cornstarch as it was thick enough for my tastes.

Seriously though, this recipe could be really good but currently feels like a rough draft (who forgets salt?) If you double the curry paste, toss in a generous amount of fresh basil and a bit of salt it is perhaps 3 stars (an average meal).

For those that don't have "light" coconut milk, you can use coconut cream and omit the olive oil.

As a vegetarian, I simply omitted the chicken and it worked out well.

I thought this curry was really bland so I added many squirts of fish oil, twice as much as of the curry paste, several drops of sesame oil, and juice from half a lime. The flavor was pretty great after that.  
Does not need the corn starch if you use regular coconut milk as opposed to light. 
Don't forget the cilantro-- it made a huge difference in mine!

This thai dish is awesome. I did make a few changes as I like it a little spicier. I add 3-4 dehydrated chili peppers to the sauce to add more kick as well as about 3-4 tsp of the paste. I would also suggest to add the zucchini to the dish last as it cooks very quickly so mine was a bit soggy. Other than that, it is excellent. Could split chicken and prawns next time.

Adequate taste... a good base recipe but it definitely is lacking a lot when you're trying to get an authentic Thai dish. I probably won't try this same recipe again.

This was an excellent recipe. The only thing is that it wasn't spicy enough for me, I did double the amount of curry paste. Next time, I will see about getting more peppers for some kick. I also like the idea of adding potatoes! Great overall recipe!

Good base to start with, but definately needs more of everything.  Used 3 Tbls. red curry paste, added garlc, ginger, curry powerder, lime juice and a TBLS of peanut better (all this based on other reviews).  I will omit carrots next time and add snow peas I think.  Otherwise it helped me get started on a GREAT dish!

Really enjoyed this dish, so 4+ Did as others recommended.  Add a couple of cloves of garlic, 2 T. Fish Sauce, extra red curry paste,  and some cayenne - at serving lime zest and fresh juice.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before throwing it in. True Thai favors.

YUM! This is a very good, quick and easy Thai recipe! I give it four stars because it does require some adjustments. After reading several reviews, I added lime juice, fresh garlic (4 cloves), 1 Tbsp brown sugar,  some coriander, snow peas, salt and pepper (at least 1/2 tsp of salt...I prefer even more) and a heaping spoonful of peanut butter (special thanks to the reviewer who suggested that addition)! Perfection!

As is this recipe fell very flat and tasteless. But after adding a few things it was a very good base for curry chicken. You just need to add your own touch to it :-)

Restaurant quality. According to other's reviews with missing ingredient, I used Thai Fish Sauce - just a TBSP and a couple shakes of cayenne pepper. Onions could be cooked a little longer. But is definately a keeper.

I think these would significantly add to the flavour. Mine wasn't spicy at all, so I would probably add some additional curry paste as well.

Very good as is!  Next time I added more curry since we like it with 'kick'.  I've tried several different brands of red curry (and green) and the hotness factor is dependent upon the brand name.  You just have to experiment to get it to your satisfaction.  We eat vegan 70% of the time so I tried making it without the chicken and used chickpeas instead..then threw in extra veggies.  It was good that way too!

My boyfriend really enjoyed eating this dish. I added 1 tsp of curry paste and also added sugar, a few dashes of fish sauce and cayenne pepper to the recipe. I used carrots, onions and green beans. I combined the curry paste with the corn starch and some of the coconut milk as another reviewer had suggested. I also sweated some minced garlic prior to cooking the chicken. Would make this recipe again.

I gave it 3 stars because it has potential... but as is, as per several other reviews: 100% flavorless. No question you must season the chicken before you add it to the skillet (and perhaps season the vegetables as well). I like a little kick so I added a lot of chili powder and it still could've used more. Also, next time I will at least double the curry paste. It smelled amazing, but when I actually sat down and took a bite I was disappointed. I think all it needs is more of everything spice related -- more: salt, peper, chili powder and curry paste. I will try this again though, lesson learned.

I followed both the recipe, and the other reviews:) I added 1 extra teaspoon of curry paste, 1 teaspoon of brown sugar, salt and pepper to taste, and the juice from 1/2 lemon. My only concern is that the sauce wasn't too watery (I uploaded a photo), compared to the displayed picture. I loved the taste though!

very little flavor as written. had to add way more curry paste. found it's much better if it sits overnight and is reheated the next day. will try again with different veggies and making curry sauce the day before.

Very good.  I marinated the chicken in low sodium soy sauce, garlic, ginger, b pepper for about an hour before cooking it.  Used pea pods instead of zucchini and it was very nice and quick dinner.  Served over brown jamsmine rice

My boyfriend and i love this recipe - the only difference is I brought the sauce to a boil first - then added the meat, carrots and bamboo shoots, I upped the red curry paste just a bit and added a teaspoon of peanut butter to it.  I will make this recipe over and over again!  Very Good!!

This was a great recipe, and considering I am far from a chef, I found this recipe easy to make. I subsituted the zucchini with asparagus, and cut back on the cocunut milk. I also added a bit of yellow curry paste to even out the flavors. I suggest this is an easy, but very tasteful meal to make for a dinner party within a 30 minute time frame. Enjoy!

Wow, I made this a bit ago and I was AMAZED how good it was, I made it for myself since my boyfriend isn't a big fan, and I was raving about what a great cook I was, mostly to myself, so thank you for making me one. haha.   This is GREAT tasting, I added much more red curry paste then stated, but i love it spicy. Served over rice and saved for later, even though the leftovers aren't as tasty as first day, maybe the coconut milk solidifies again?   Anyways, Thanks for my NEW favorite curry recipes!

This dish is amazing!  It cooked up quickly, and reheats very well!  The zucchini is absolutely a must.. it adds a sweet flavor to the spicy dish.  The ONLY change we made is adding a little sugar.  Definitely a keeper recipe, thank you!

Let me start by saying I made the changes mentioned in the reviews. I added sesame oil, 3 cloves of garlic and about 1/2 tsp of fresh ginger. I also added whatever veggies were in the fridge, but omitted the carrots and bell peppers as some family members cannot have them. A healthy sprinkling of sea salt and black pepper and this was great!

I love Thai food and decided to try this recipe at home. It was excellent and came together quick enough for a mid-week meal. I followed others suggestions of adding garlic, lime juice, and fish sauce and omitted the cillantro only because I didn't have any on hand. My husband loved this and my kids even ate it! I served over jasmine rice and will definitely be making this again.

This is a great base recipe; I too added 1 Tbsp fish sauce, 1 Tbsp sugar/brown sugar, a couple squirts of lemon juice and some salt. Thought the flavor was fabulous and my two toddlers gobbled it up too!

This was not as good as I expected. I agree with the other recommendations. I would add more red curry paste. I added lime juice and fish sauce. I should have left the lime juice out and just put lime wedges on the table for people to flavor as they would have liked. It was a little too limey for me. I did add extra cilantro and that added good flavor. Ok recipe.

I used 2.5tsp of mild curry paste because my child does not like spicy foods.  I used the minced fresh garlic and ginger as recommended in another review and it was very flavorful without being spicy.  I also added diced, steamed sweet potatoes and green peas.  It was fantastic and my whole family loved it!

I was pretty let down with this recipe. I made a traditional Thai dinner for my in laws tonight everyone agreed it was bland and required to much doctoring up. However the cooking times are perfect as the veggies and chicken turned out great.I would definitely double up on the red curry paste. However the mango sticky rice recipe on this site was awesome!

This recipe was alright but not great.  I made it using the following modifications based on previous reviewers.  I added more curry paste, lime juice, garlic, sugar, black pepper, ginger paste and soy sauce.  It only slightly resembled the red curry that I'm used to getting at Thai restaurants.  I will probably experiment with it until I figure out what I'm doing wrong.

I was disappointed with this dish. It was just "ok." Like others, I added more curry paste, lime juice, fish sauce, garlic, black pepper and sugar. My husband said not to make it again, to him it was just "something to eat" and not very exciting, and I agree.

really nice the only change I made was to use the juice of a whole lime and I added some salt. I have since trying this recipe cooked a very similar Red Thai Curry with a friend and we used whole dried lime leaves (2) to cook with the sauce and we added some fish sauce. Amazing!

This recipe was delicious! I got excellent reviews from my husband, though we did make some alterations to the original posted recipe. For example: I left out the zucchini, bell peppers and carrots. Instead, I used a bit extra garlic, green onions/spring onions, yellow onions, bok choy, mushrooms. I also omitted the cornstarch as I saw no need for it. The 
sauce thickened nicely. Recipe turned out wonderfully tasty!

This was a great Thai recipe.  I did add some peanut butter and a couple of small potatoes with a little extra curry paste. It was wonderfully spicy and I could still taste the different flavors of the onions, zucchini, and peppers.  So simple and quick.  I served mine with jasmine rice.

The veggie blend is very nice, but the recipe was a little bland.  Following the suggestions of other reviewers is a good idea; I added lime juice, soy sauce (oyster would be even better), ginger paste, and extra curry paste to add some oomph.  I garnished with some thai basil.

A very good recipe--and really easy!  I followed the suggestions of others and added the juice of 1 lime as well as garlic--I used crushed garlic and added it to the olive oil before the chicken.  I also added a bit of soy sauce since I didn't have fish sauce.  Also, I couldn't find curry paste at the store so I used 2-3 tsp curry powder mixed with a bit of water then stirred the mixture before adding 2 spoonfuls of creamy peanut butter and a little bit of the coconut milk.  I then added this mix to the chicken and veggies and a bit of minced fresh ginger root as well as a salt, pepper, and a dash of red pepper flakes.  Also used frozen green beans instead of zucchini, which my husband said he liked.  Tasted great over brown basmati rice. We're looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

Made this for a Thai-themed dinner group and everyone gave it high marks. I followed recommendations of other reviewers and added minced garlic, lime juice, fish sauce, ginger, and peanut sauce. Good stuff!

Excellent dish! We followed the advice of previous posting where peanut butter was added along with potatoes etc.  Definately made a huge difference, We have made this dish several times and have made fewer trips to the local Thai restaraunt!!

This was really tasty...although I did take a lot of the other reviewers suggestions and add a few things (doubled the curry paste, minced garlic, coriander, lime juice, fish sauce).  I also added a chopped up jalapeno.  We had it over brown basmati rice - yum!

This was absolutely delicious!! Restaurant quality, and so easy to make. I also added 2 tablespoons of the red thai curry, and the coconut milk goes very well with the curry and lessened the spice a bit. My 2 and a half year-old LOVED it.

Recipe was great! Although, the recipe should have called for 3-4 tablespoons red curry paste because it was too bland with just two. That is the only change!

Made this for the first time tonight. It smelled wonderful and my family was impressed, but like everyone said, I feel it was missing something. I added sugar snap peas, lime juice, a crushed garlic clove, and a little grated ginger. Something was still missing. I do recommend this, and I will definitely make it again, but I will play around with the recipe. Salt is a must, and let it simmer a bit longer so everything can absorb the flavors.

This recipe greatly improved by adding a few other ingredients: 1 Tblsp fish sauce, 1 Tblsp creamy peanut butter, 1 cup Thai Holy Basil leaves, some julienned bamboo shoots. Add the zuchinni last and let it simmer GENTLY until zuchinni is cooked. Don't stir it too much or the zuchinni will just break up into mushy pieces.

Definitely needed about twice the curry paste (at least the kind I use).  I also added green beans and let the whole dish simmer on low for about 10minutes while the rice cooked.  Finally I finished it off with fresh basil and lime juice.

I cooked this recipe last night to the T. I am a huge fan of red curry and used the red curry paste made by "taste of thai" The color wasn't red enough and the flavor ... not even close! Not sure if this calls for curry powder mabye? or mabye some more authentic paste from a local Oriental market. It also seems that it needs to simmer longer to asborb, and cook down spices .. like you would chili. Won't make again!

Delicious.  I'd add a little more salt next time, though.  Had red peppers on hand but not zucchini or carrots.  Still good.  :)

I love this recipe!  The disolving of the corn starch is difficult, though... next time I think I'll put it in the microwave to help it along.  This goes great with Japanese sticky rice.  Yeah... it's mixing the cultures a bit, but I am an American after all.

It's edible, but nothing like Thai restaurant dishes. I even used a very spicy can of curry paste and added garlic and fish sauce to the chicken, but the results weren't very satisfactory. I'm still looking for the ultimate recipe. This one isn't it.

I followed the adjustments of another user ( double the curry paste,juice of 1 lime, 1/2 teaspoon of coriander, 2 tablespoons fish sauce, fresh minced garlic clove, and 2 teaspoons sugar.)  While it tasted good, I thought it still was not spicy enough to be 'authentic.'  Next time I will add in some chile paste.

This was an easy and tasty recipe.  I had purchased mild curry paste, so had to put in about 3 tbsp of paste to get the spiciness we like.  Definitely will be a regular dish.

LOVED IT.  I doubled curry paste and added cumin seasoning and a bit of salt.  I also added some yogurt on top at the end.  Very yummy.  Will definitely be making again.

I also couldnt find the LITE coconut milk - it was WAY rich, so I'd say definitely find the LITE if you can.  If not, use 1/2 reg milk and half coconut milk.

This recipe has a nice flavor, particularly when served with jasmine rice.  However, I found it to be too bland for my taste and had to "jazz it up" with red pepper flakes when serving.

I thought this was a very authentic thai dish, reminded me so much of a thai restaraunt. I only put in 1/2 the amount of red curry paste the recipe called for, added a couple xtra ounces of coconut milk, about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a tablespoon of fish sauce, and still too spicy for me. I like one star or less, this was more like 2.
