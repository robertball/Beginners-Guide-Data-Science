So. Good. I paired this down to 8 servings, as I didn't want to make a whole bunch and not like it. But, it really was great. I didn't have pure maple syrup but I did have pure Butter Pecan syrup, which was a workable substitution. I ended up using this butter on the Nut and Grain pancakes from this site, which turned out alright. I don't know if I'd make it again, but it WAS good.

I thought this was just okay.  The pumpkin pie spice was overpowering.  Also there was not much of a maple flavor.  If I were to make this again, I would use less spice and try increasing the amount of maple syrup or even add 1 teaspoon pure maple extract.

This is really good! I did half the recipe to try it out. I didn't think it had a really strong maple flavor though. But, the flavor was good anyway! It was like eating cinnamon raisin bread with butter and sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top. I put it in a one cup container with a twist top lid, and it fit perfect. It was a very handy container to store it in the fridge. I will definitely make a cup of this as is every fall!

Left out the pumpkin spice and used Eggo Buttery syrup.  Turned out amazing, but unless it's spread on hot items, the texture is gritty due to the brown sugar.  Anyway, the taste makes up for the grit.  Used on cornbread, and will definately make again.

I loved this! It is very sweet and flavorful. It is perfect for use on toast or a bagel.

Amazing! I made it to put on sweet potato rolls I made from this site, but it was so good the family sat at the dinner table thinking "what else can we put this on" I made waffles for breakfast and we put it on them -YUMM, then I made corn bread- to die for with maple butter on it hot out of the oven!  will be a staple in my house! Thanks for sharing!

Superb! I used some Vermont maple syrup my father in law brought down from VT. The pumpkin pie spice gave it the unique flavor.  We have been eating it on 'bread machine bagels' from this site (which we like SO much!)...I also served to guests and they agreed it was delish!  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh My Gosh! This is SO AWESOME! I used it on biscuits, but it would be great for pancakes, french toast, plain toast, on cinnamon raisin bread or toast, on pumpkin bread, sweet potatoes, cinnamon rolls, etc. I'm glad I scaled it down and only made a small amount as it is so good that we could have eaten it by itself. Thanks, this is wonderful!

Very good on waffles, pancakes, etc, but to use on sweet potatoes, I leave out the butter, brown sugar, maple syrup and the pumpkin pie spice. I then add a good dose of caramel ice cream topping. Yummilicious. ;-)

GREAT.  Made it exactly like the recipe is written.  Hubby took some to work and one of the guys wants to buy some, along with a loaf of maple oatmeal bread.

I licked the mixing spoon, bowl, waxed paper...enough said!  I used my own version of pumpkin pie spice: 1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 t ground ginger, 1/8 t nutmeg, 1/8 t allspice...otherwise followed recipe.  Served w/baked sweet potatoes and fried chicken.  A HIT!!!!

Outstanding! Delicious on toast, waffles, pancakes, sweet potato ... anything that you would want to add some sweetness too when you would normally use butter.  I added spice to taste so I don't know how much I used but I did not use the full quantity called for. This will now always be in my fridge.

This was excellent! I switched the proportions of maple syrup and brown sugar, resulting in a slightly runny consistency, but since we were using it on waffles it didn't make much of a difference. I've seen other maple butter recipes, but never one with spices -- a definite keeper!

My husband and and his friend loved it. It was a bit too sweet for me. I'm happy as long as they are though. I did use Truvía brown sugar instead of regular and I Can't Believe Its Not Butter spread instead of regular butter.

I found it easy to make.  However, I find it too sweet and too buttery.  I am not sure if I would make it again.  But if I did I would perhaps use a lighter brown sugar and less of it.  Also reduce the butter to 3/4 cup instead of the full cup.

Amazing!  I made 1/2 the recipe to give it a try.  I should have made the whole recipe!  I used it on pumpkin cranberry scones and everyone raved about it.  I also used it on bagels and toast, as well as sweet potatoes.  Will be making this more often.

I didn't have brown sugar(threw it out last week for health reasons)so I substituted it for more maple syrup 3/4 cup instead of 1/4 cup. I bake sweet potatoes for breakfast and paired it with this Maple Butter. My husband LOVED it. He said it was the best sweet Potatoe he's ever had! So only organic maple syrup,butter and pumpkin pie spice

I only had margarine to make this with and I didn't measure ingredients, as I was only making a small amount to spread on the maple muffins I made from this site this morning. I didn't have pumpkin spice so I added some cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg instead. It went good with the muffins.

I increased the maple syrup some & then it didn't hold it's shape very well afer chilling. When I tried to slice the roll, it kept falling apart so I let it sit out for a few minutes to soften back up & then used a cookie scoop to make butter balls. Left them in teh freezer until about 30 minutes before serving time & then put them in little crystal bowls. These tasted great on rolls... I can't wait to try the leftovers on sweet potatoes. Thanks  PAYNES!
