I tried this recipe with fresh green beans. I cut them up and soaked them for 5 minutes in salt water, then followed the recipe as advised. It was great! I served it as a side dish to pork chops and pasta! Would definitely do again.

These were the most delicious green beans I've ever had!  Took them to our family Thanksgiving potluck in which I was in charge of vegetable side dishes. Made these, and others from Allrecipes: the feta-bacon green beans (not so good) and the roasted brussel sprouts (awesome)
The only change I made was to use fresh green beans, about 1 lb, which I partially cooked in the microwave for about 5 mins first w/a bit of water, then I drained and proceeded w/the recipe, just sort of stir frying them w/the oil, garlic and adding the cilantro at the end, after the beans had gotten nice and dark. Not a pretty recipe, but so delicious. Never would have thought of cilantro and green beans together, but was absolutely delicious --I couldn't get enough of them, and they were excellent reheated the next day in the microwave! Will DEFINITELY add these to my veg. side dish favorites. Such simple ingredients and preparation, but a wonderfully complex flavor!

This has become my favorite way to prepare green beans.  I was amazed at how big an impact the cilantro had on the end result I think I even use close to half cup of cilantro.  I try to be careful with the oil, because I don't like me beans very oily.  I also like to turn the heat up a little the last few minutes and brown the beans slightly.  Make sure to keep stirring if you turn the heat up.

Very good!  I like this method of making green beans.  I would suggest a lower "medium high" for the heat, though.  **EDIT** I love this way of making green beans so much now that I hardly ever make them any other way.  WOW!

This met both of my criteria for a 5 star recipe...simple and delicious! My husband is Lebanese and we make something similar with fresh green beans but there are onions and tomato paste in it too. I think that I could add those to this recipe if I wanted and it would be just as delicious! This is a keeper for sure!

I've been making these for about five years now, and have never written a review.  This is a great recipe.  Delicious just as is, but I usually add a touch more garlic to my personal taste.  Yum!  Try it- you won't be disappointed!

What a delicious recipe! Something about the oil does a wonderful thing to the beans. Don't mistake this for any ol' green bean recipe. This is the best!

Great recipe!  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I cut way back on the olive oil and drizzled just a little over the beans before cooking.

So simple yet delicious and flavorful.  I served this with chicken and rice.  I was surprised by how many compliments I got on this dish.  I even turned my cilantro-hating friend into a believer!  Not only would I make this again but it's definitely going in my heavy rotation list of side dishes.  Thanks!

I suppose it was the interesting method that intrigued me. I'm not a green bean lover and have never prepared them from frozen but some family members are, so I thought I would give it a go. Few ingredients are required and really clear instructions are given in this recipe. The slight browning of the beans gives this dish the most interesting flavour and texture. If you are in the mood for something "outside the box" this will dazzle your taste buds. UPDATE - I have found the French cut style of frozen beans are the best to use.

I made it exactly as described in the recipe and it was fantastic. i used green beans from my garden that I had blanched and frozen. Aside from how crazy delicious this recipe is, it is the best recipe I've found to use up summer green beans when you're buried in them! It is healthy, filling and delicious without being heavy. We put it in pita bread with roasted chicken and topped with homemade raita sauce. You won't regret making this recipe!

I thought the beans and cilantro was an unusual combination, but having them both in abundance right now I thought I would give this a try. It was awsome!! Works great with fresh beans; cook until bright green. I also doubled the garlic because we love the stuff. Will deffinately be making this again and again and again. Thanks to Tasneem for posting this one!

I just ate a lot of green beans! I used only half of the olive oil and still felt I could have used less. Will certainly make this again. Thanks.

I made this as a side dish to go with a chicken satay and curry as well as some coconut rice.  It was very good!  I did find that I kept adding more salt, but the recipe says to taste.  I couldn't decide if this was my favorite part of the meal, or the satay!  I am staring at the clock waiting until an acceptable time to pull them out for lunch!  I did feel like they could have used something else, maybe a little sugar and some heat.  But as is, the recipe is great!

These are fantastic! Everyone ate way more than I expected.  I made again the next night and stuffed them in a pita with hummus.  Delish!  I think this is my new favorite way to eat green beans!

I was looking for a change and this recipe provided it!  I love cilantro, my husband doesn't, but we both liked this recipe.  My only suggestion is use medium heat or lower.

My husband is Syrian also, and I have made this hundreds of times, both with fresh and frozen beans. I do it a little differently, though. (I don't like to cook with olive oil but use it at room temp only.) I sauté several cloves of garlic that I COARSELY chop or slice in a small amount of vegetable oil (like canola or coconut) then add the green beans, and about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of water, salt to taste and cover, cooking over medium until they're tender but not mushy. Then uncover for the last few minutes, (most or all the water should be evaporated), and serve with a generous drizzle of olive oil. By gently sautéing the garlic first, it intensifies the flavor and takes away the bite of raw garlic. Plus the flavor of olive oil on warm beans also makes the flavor of the oil shine through. We typically serve these slightly warm or room temp, but not typically hot. ENJOY!

couldn't be easier and it tasted good.  I did add an extra clove of garlic bc we love it but besides that followed recipe exactly.  will have to play with heat and cooking time bc I cooked the gr beans until they just started to brown and while the flavor was really good I would have preferred that the beans be just a bit more crisp tender.  EDIT:  I made these again but used 1/8 c of chili pepper infused EVOO and 1/8 C regular and WOW they are good.  spicy and just Yummy!  My husband and I eat a whole bag of these in one sitting now.  YUM.  favorite green been recipe EVER

I make this weekly and figured I should write a review. This is the only way my meat and potatoes husband will eat green beans. It is so simple and delicious! I've made it without cilantro because I didn't have any and it was still good. The cilantro adds another wonderful dimension of flavor, but it's the cooking technique that really makes this dish.

These beans were absolutely delicious. I used fresh and added a tablespoon of water to make up for the frozen ice crystals.  I cooked until many of the beans were starting to brown.  So good, I can't imagine I won't make this all the time.

Where do I start!!!?? If I could rate these 10000 I would. These have got to be the best green beans on the planet.  If you love garlic and love cilantro, you HAVE GOT to make these.  They are superfast and super easy.  I have probably made them at least 10 times.  My family and friends love them so much I can never have leftovers.  In fact, we love these so much that they could be our entire meal with meat on the side.  I used the long organic green beans but I am sure any frozen green bean will do.  LOVE LOVE LOVE-I think this is my favorite saved recipe, NO KIDDING!!

Fantastic! The combination didn't sound very good, but it was delicious. It was a bit greasy so I may cut back next time.

OMG.  Seriously delicious, and insanely easy.  EVERYONE at my dinner party raved about the beans.  And the recipe's so quick, easy and CHEAP that it's insane.  This is so becoming a staple for me.  Delicious.  The mixture of the fresh garlic and cilantro was incredible.  The house smelt delicious.  Oh, I also used less oil than called for.  Just whatever amount I felt comfortable with.  I ended up making more beans as I ate a lot of them before the dinner party--they were that good.  :)

I am not a frozen green bean fan but these were awesome!!  I about ate the whole pan by myself.  Even my 6 year old who thinks green beans are his worst enemy and having to eat them is a fate worse than death said that they "were pretty good".  I made the recipe as is and will definitely make them again.  Probably tonight :)  I think it is very important to use extra virgin olive oil.  I think the other olive oils would be too heavy.

These were great.  I typically hate frozen veges, but these were wonderful.  I think I used only 2 tbl. of olive oil though.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made these for dinner the other night & the reviews were split. Half of us loved it and the other half would have to pass. Since I'm reviewing, I get to pick the stars--but I will say that it could have used a bit more seasoning--the softness of the green beans (and I let it go quite a bit per the description of "authentic") and I liked that. The olive oil flavored the beans nicely, but I think there needed to be some sort of counter point--maybe the garlic going in sooner or some other herb to complement the cilantro. I'll definitely make this again--even as it is written, though.

We loved it.  Made it as stated in recipe (except for one ingredient).  I thought I still had fresh cilantro, but it had already died off.  I would love to try it with cilantro next time.  Great way to cook green beans.  No extra water to boil off the vitamins.

This was simple and fairly quick. I used a blend of green beans, wax beans, and carrots, sea salt, and dried cilantro. I really liked this dish a lot. My husband did not.

Wow!!! Just made this for me and my husband. We gobbled down every bit and could have eaten twice as much. I used 2 tbsp olive oil and put the garlic in at the beginning rather than at the end with the cilantro. wonderful!!!!!

I used frozen skinny green beans but next time I will use regular cut--I think they will brown better without burning.  STILL, this was awesome.  Next time I am going to cut back on the oil a little and see what happens.  Yum!

This recipe is a different, delicious way to prepare green beans.  I make these two or three times a month, and make them often for holiday meals.  I do not use cilantro in the recipe, as my family does not care for it. I do add in about 1/4 tsp. of black pepper.  YUM!

This is now the way I will be making my green beans. These were to die for. I actually cooked these in a foil roasting pan on the grill while I was cooking up the chops.(Grilled Lemon Herb from this site) and Lemony Quinoa. This dinner idea came together perfectly and with 444 cal., 26g fat, and 35mg of cholesterol, you can't go wrong.

These are really good.  Normally, I make green beans "southern style", but this is a great and most likely healthier alternative.  The olive oil does do something magical to the beans.  Will certainly make again.

These are AMAZING!! By far the most delicious green beans I've ever had! My fiance was a bit skeptical about them while he was watching me cook them, but one bite turned him into a believer! He's not a huge fan of green beans, but he loved these and said they were the best he'd ever had! Thanks Tasneem! :D

This is my favorite way to make green beans now!I cooked mine about 15 minutes, they got a bit browned by the high heat but were delicious! This is the first time I've made green beans that didn't taste rubbery!

very yummy, my veggie-phobic husband ate them and declared them "very good"!
I used a little less than a 1/4 cup of oil and used fresh green beans, since I'm not a big fan of frozen veggies. We ate them "warm", as many people suggested that they were better after sitting for a bit. This is a keeper.

Like others were saying, I never thought of cooking my green beans this way.  I used whole green and wax beans, frozen.  I also put on a little garlic powder with the salt (kosher).  I will make this again soon.

this was good and definitely a nice change to steaming or boiling.  i used fresh green beans - maybe that altered the results...or it may have been the fresh spinach i threw in just cos i had some left over.  anyway, it turned out well - but without the WOW that others wrote about.

Loved these! Cooking time is about 15 mins.. I cut back a little on olive oil and added extra garlic and a splash of red wine vinegar. My husband wanted thirds and asked why I had not made enough (I made 4 servings and it was just the 2 of us!) I plan to make these for Thanksgiving and will add diced cooked bacon.

Amazing.  Used french cut green beans, 3 T olive oil and 2 cloves garlic plus cilantro.  Cooked until garlic was sweet (for the little girls).  So, so good, husband said, "this is tasty!" There were no leftovers!

These were a good change from plain ole veggies. I had to substitute garlic powder because I did not have fresh. The other thing that may have affected flavor was that after they were done, I let them rest covered while I got a few more things ready for dinner. This way, they were served more warm than hot, and the cilantro had more time to wilt. I have been told that some people have taste buds that make cilantro taste awful to them. Thankfully, that's not us, but just something to think about if you don't like cilantro dishes.

This is a delicious and easy dish to make. I added two tablespoons of lemon juice to the olive oil just because I like the taste of lemon with green beans.  I cooked mine until the beans were slightly crunchy. Once it was complete, I found it a little bland so I added a few dashes of Badia garlic and parsley.  I will make this again but next time I'll add an extra clove of garlic.

wow! this recipe is fantastic!! usually im not a big fan of green beans, but my fam. likes them & because i like exotic food i decided to try it. It was by far the best green beans i've eaten ever!!! The flavor was sooo good, i wished i had made more! Very easy to make, i used an olive oil spray instead of the tblsp. so I didnt have to use as much, because i dont like very oily foods; i will def. make it again! :)

I made this tonight, only due to dietary issues, omitted the cilantro. I added a little black pepper, extra garlic and less olive oil. I let my beans get mildly browned. I loved them, they were so good and I will NEVER boil (as I learned from grandma) my green beans again.

This is our favorite green bean recipe.  So simple and delicious. I prefer the green beans a little crunchy, so I usually don't cook them very long, but the flavor is still outstanding.

The flavors are delicious together. I used frozen green beans even though I usually try to avoid frozen vegetables, not enough flavor. Next time I'll try it with fresh as I didn't enjoy the texture of the once frozen beans.

I love this dish! I grew up eating this and a similar dish that also has tomatoes. I highly recommend this recipe. It is so good, it is hard to believe it is a veggie. Great with Kefta (or kufta; there is a good recipe on this site) and rice-a-roni! Maybe add some sliced tomatoes on the side.

Wow!  I just ate a whole pound of green beans!  I'm cooking ahead for the week, and these were supposed to go with a few lunches.  Luckily I bought a double-sized bag of green beans!  This recipe is awesome.  Followed this recipe exactly.  I think they taste slightly better room temperature (they didn't make them to the fridge to test how good they would taste cold).   Thanks a lot, I'm going to make the rest of the beans right now, and clearly I'm going to be eating at least a pound of green beans every week now.  And that's a great thing!

These are so different from your standard green beans.  The browning makes them really wonderful. I could eat the whole batch by myself.

I never thought frozen green beans could taste good, but I really liked this recipe. I happen to be a garlic and cilantro fanatic, so that likely makes a difference. This is an easy, flavorful dish to make. It went over well at a potluck dinner party.

This was a nice new way to serve an old favorite veggie. I was afraid that (in spite of all of the reviews to the contrary) it would be kind of boring and greasy, but it really wasn't. I halved the recipe and used it as a side dish to a beef tenderloin. Thanks tasneem!

Sooooo good. Mine did get a little burnt on the bottom on med-high so I removed most of the burnt ones. Overall, the darker they are the better. Don't be scared to let them get brown, the flavor soaks in more! BH wants these every night.

So goooood. I loved these. I didn't use fresh cilantro since I couldn't find any in the grocery stores around here so I used 1 T dried. My husband thought these were a little oily but he thinks that about everything. I added some garlic powder. I will be making these again & again. I'd love to try cooking more Syrian food. Thanks so much.

I think that I overcooked the green beans or that something went wrong, because the green beans were too "toasty" for my liking and they didn't come out as great as everyone else said that they did.

This was very easy to make.  The taste was good, but I didn't like the texture--I like my green beans crisper.

A great, subtle change to make green beans more interesting and complimentary to a more flavorful main dish.

This has been the only way I have been able to get my husband to eat fresh green beans. He usually will only eat canned. (He's wierd!)This has become a favorite in our house and appears regularly on the dinner table. Thank you for this wonderful way to dress up this wonderful  bean!

Amazing! These are a keeper. The cooking method creates a richness that is very similar to caramelizing onions. The deep flavor is a great compliment to the freshness of the cilantro. I will definitely make these again.

Very tasty! I used fresh green beans, and this recipe gave them a nice, subtle flavor. I think they were a little too oily and will use less olive oil next time.

Delicous!  I even got a 5 star from one of my kids who hates green vegetables.  I did not have fresh cilantro so I used dry, but the taste was still so good.  I cannot wait to try with fresh cilantro.  Some pieces got a little black but they were still good.  Thanks  tasneem

These beans are absolutely wonderful.  I used to go to Boston Market for their grean beans now I don't have to.  These taste sooo good I could eat them all the time.  I didn't have cilantro last time I made them so I used a little dried Basil. They still tasted wonderful.  My husband also loves them.  Thank-you so much Tasneem.

This recipe was average.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't wonderful.  It was, however, very easy to make. I used about half of the cilantro and it still dominated the flavor of this dish.  I like cilantro alot, but as a subtle flavor.

Very tasty!  This dish had a nice fresh taste.  However, the beans seemed overly greasy, next time I would maybe decrease the amount of olive oil by about half.

I found out that I don't like cilantro that much, so I used half the cilantro.  I also used fresh green beans instead of frozen, but it still turned out well.  I will make it again.  Thanks!

I don't know that my guests go as crazy for these as I do, but I love them! I find the ice crystals create too much water in the pot and I end up straining the beans during the cooking process in order to get them to darken and not just get mushy. I also sprinkle on toasted sesame seeds before serving - great additional nutrition and a perfect flavor compliment. These stay perfectly well in the fridge overnight.

Fasoliyyeh Bi Z-Zayt Haiku: "I can't pronounce that! Hahaha but this was GREAT. I'll make again, yep!" So along w/ several other reviewers, I can enthusiastically say that I don't think I'll prepare green beans any other way again. These were THAT good. What made something so simple, so ... magical? I don't know, but we loved them, and ate them alongside rice and AR's Schwarma for a most marvelous meal.

The family wolfed down green beans and wanted more.  I of course doubled the garlic and used the chopped leafy part of an entire bunch of cilantro.  It is amazing how simple to make with so few ingredients this is. This will be a regular thing for me.

This is a great recipe.  I used Trader Joe's garlic olive oil.  I think it would be fine using a little less than the 1/4 cup called for.  The more done (browner) the beans get, the better they are.  Great cold the next day too.

Ok, I admit I had to change this.  I love green beans but hate cilantro.  But I thought the recipe sounded great for the beans and gave it a shot adding parsley and just a bit of basil.  It was really good.  I added the garlic a little earlier because I wanted it to cook a bit longer, and I think onions would be really nice in here, too.  It's a keeper.  I can't wait to try with my fresh green beans and herbs next summer!

This has quickly become my favorite green vegetable dish.  It's so delicious and so easy.  When I take dinner to a friend this is almost always a dish that I make.  I wish I could provide you with some amazing tips, but I make it just as is and it's fantastic!

These are some of the best green beans ever!!!  Thank you so much.  Only add 1 tsp olive oil per serving and it tastes lush and flavorfull.  Very good, I will be making these instead of green bean cassarole for all my holidays.

Amazing! 4 ingredients produce a delicious, healthy side dish. I used less olive oil than suggested and more cilantro (1/3 cup). Thanks so much Tasneem! Please share other Syrian recipes with us.

Good, low carb, healthy side dish! I may add more garlic next time & use a little less oil.

hmmmm....I didn't like this as much as my regular green bean standby (1 can green beans (undrained), 1 capful of olive oil, 1 TBS cider vinegar....boil just about all the water out of it....perfect!!  Maybe I just missed the vinegar?  Couldn't even taste the cilantro.

It could have been because I used frozen cilantro instead of fresh, but I thought that this recipe was lacking flavor. It was good but not as flavorful as I would have liked. Next time I would probably add a little salt, more garlic and try fresh cilantro.

I cooked this tonight with some slight deviations from the original recipe.  I used frozen baby green beans, a little extra garlic and since I didn't have fresh cilantro on hand, I used the dried stuff.  I can only imagine how much better it would have been with the fresh cilantro. I usually like my veggies a little crisp, but decided to cook as directed, but not until brown and it was delicious.  To accompany the green beans, I made garlic red potatoes and whole wheat pita bread 'fried' in a small amount of olive oil and butter.  I'll definately be doing this again.

This recipe is very easy to make and has a very unique taste.  I've ALWAYS hated hot green beans but these are yummy.  I didn't change a thing to the recipe, although I may add cooked chopped onions the next time.

These are incredible!  I have made them many times for my family, and I have to make a double-batch for just four of us!  Once when I was pregnant with my daughter, I ate an entire batch ON MY OWN.  Scary.  My mother also insists I make this every time we cook together at her house.  Also, I've served it when other guests have had dinner in our home and have received rave reviews.  Plus, it is soooo simple.  It's impossible to ruin this recipe!

Thanks to tasneem for sharing an excellent dish!

I loved this!  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because my husband wasn't a fan.  He didn't like the texture of the beans - just a personal preferance.  I will make it again for myself!

It was delicious and easy to make! I skipped the salt and added an extra clove of garlic. It's just different enough to be special, but doesn't require any unusual ingredients. I plan to make this often!

I have made this recipe several times with fresh or frozen green beans. When using fresh green beans I add a small amount of water. Cooking time is longer with fresh green beans. I prefer to cook my green beans till they start to turn brown.

Who knew green beans could taste so good? I have made this with both frozen and fresh green beans, sometimes even mixing both together it comes out great either way.  I make this often now. It is very flavorful and not what you would expect. Great recipe! Thank you!

This has become a family staple - and each of my kids favorite veggie dish.  I cook them on med/hi heat for almost 40 minutes so that they char a bit on the bottom, shaking the pot every 5-10 minutes so that they don't stick.  This adds a delicious texture and nuttiness  Garlic and fresh cilantro is a perfect addition.  Love this dish - Thank you!

Made this and found it delicious.  I had only fresh green beans so I put about 1 Tbsp. water in with the olive oil and covered to steam as described in the recipe.  It turned out just great!  I had a wee bit left over and ate them the next day cold.  Just as tasty as when freshly made so it would make a nice salad to bring to a pot luck.  I’ll make this often!

A bazaar recipe but actually very good.  Served to guests who wanted the recipe.  Easy to make and I will definitely make it again.  Thank for the recipe.  I only wish I could pronounce it.:)

Delicious, quick, and healthy meal. I halved the oil for dietary factor but still tasted amazing! Perfect quick and healthy lunch! I served it with whole wheat pita bread and garlic hummus.

Excellent and easy.  Will be a staple.  Tastes far more complex than you'd think you'd get from these simple few ingredients.  I cut the olive oil in half and it was just fine.

These are delicious green beans. I made Syrian bread (from this site) and hummus to have with them. Everything got a little sprinkle of sumac. It was all good! I use fresh beans which were partially cooked. I will definitely make this again.

I used drained canned French cut green beans since that's all we had in the house without any issue, following the rest of the recipe as written. Still amazing! I don't want to eat green beans any other way.

I'm Syrian also. I like to cook them till they are wilted and brown. I do not add cilantro. But garlic is a must with this dish!!!  Outstanding recipe! Thanks for posting for all to see! Syrian food is my love!

We really liked this easy side dish. I followed the recipe exactly, and we decided we could do with less oil next time.  It does taste great with nan and store roasted chicken for a weeknight meal.

Such a simple way to jack up the flavor of green beans. Thanks for this idea. I love cilantro, and thanks to this recipe have realized I can add it to many veggies for a flavor boost.

These were good and I admit I cheated by using canned green beans. I would try them again with the frozen. I added the ingredients to taste, the amount I had, and to lower the calories a bit. I did 2 Tblsp of extra virgin olive oil, 2 cans of drained green beans, 1 minced clove of garlic, and about 1 Tblsp of fresh cilantro torn. I sauteed the beans until hot, removed from the burner, and then added the last 2 ingredients and let sit until the cilantro wilted. I would not have thought to put those 2 flavors in green beans. These are very garlicy, so just beware. The olive oil liquid would be good for dipping.

Love this recipe! Simple, tasty, and different. I make it about any time I make any Middle Eastern-ish meal.

I'll throw in a little extra cilantro if I have it sometimes, and I like to put the garlic in first with the olive oil rather than at the end, but it is great as written.

I love this simple way of cooking frozen green beans, especially how they turn a little brown at the end.  The flavor and texture are just about perfect.  I always make them this way now.  Thanks!!!

I think the recommendation of medium high heat on the burner was too high, even for my normally (and woefully) underpowered range.  I say this because the green beans blackened in several spots before they turned that brownish-green color that is mentioned in the recipe.  Regardless, this was a very delicious dish, and it will definitely take its rightful place in our Family Favorites folder.  Thank you so much for sharing!
