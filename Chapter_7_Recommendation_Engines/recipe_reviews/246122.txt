I only had regular cheddar, so I didn't use a variety as called for in the recipe.  Next time, I will shred it myself because the "anti-clumping powder" that they use on pre-shredded cheese always leaves a little grittiness in the final dish.  It was subtle though.  7 minutes worked like a charm on my instant pot.  Oh yeah, I decreased the water by 1 cup since so many said theirs turned out runny, and mine was perfect!  I served this for a playdate, and all of the kids devoured it.  No one complained that it wasn't "Kraft" ;)

I had pretty much given up on making mac and cheese. The texture was always gritty. Thought I'd give it one last try with this pressure cooker  recipe. OMG...it is creamy and delish.  I hate when people change everything and do a review...but  I just didn't have  the heavy cream, so I used evaporated milk.  I didn't have mild cheddar and instead of using all sharp...I had some Velveeta. Mine didn't turn out soupy at all....probably because I fell asleep and the pressure went down on it's own. I actually had to add some milk.  Will make it again for sure.

This was so easy! Just dump the ingredients in and in about 10 minutes it's done. Make sure your cream cheese is at room temp.I felt it needed a bit of paprika or even some cayenne. I dusted the final product with just enough cayenne that it's wasn't really discernible and mixed it in. Perfect! *WARNING* This will scorch the bottom of your pressure cooker but with a little soak time it will clean up easily.

This is super easy and delicious.  Just a few items that are good to know. When the pressure cooker is finished and you have let the pressure down, it will be very soupy.  My cream cheese always needs mixed in.  I have started taking it out and putting it into a serving bowl so that it call cool off a little and begin to set up.  This is even better reheated the next day. I have made it with beef broth too and it is just as good.

Ok. So this was my first time with the pressure cooker. Next time I'm gonna make some changes. I followed the recipe almost exactly, with some small exceptions... per other reviews, I used a little less water- 1 2/3. I cut down on cooking time, since I prefer my pasta al dente. I also added some paprika and cayenne. I subbed yellow mustard for mustard powder. I also shredded the cheddar myself. It did come out a bit soupy, but it thickened once it cooled. I thought the sauce was gritty and bland. Despite cutting down cook time, I thought the pasta was overcooked. I had no issues with scorching, though. I served it with steamed broccoli and peas. That said, next time I will add the cheddar after cooking. Between the heat and liquid, I think it will mix well. Cheddar isn't really meant to have water injected into it, you know? I think I'll also do the full 8 oz of cream cheese next time, too. I think with some tweaks, this would be a great, quick, easy recipe for a family, or a couple to have leftovers for the week. Thank you!

Came out a little soupy, but when it cooled, was the perfect consistency.  DELICIOUS.

I stirred it before I started it coming to pressure, then cooked 7 min. as directed.  Manually lowered pressure.  The macaroni was stuck to the bottom of the pan and not done.   I stirred again and recooked an additional 5 min.

Looks nothing like a delish pan of  mac and cheese.

The only thing different is that my cooker does not have a rice setting.  I used the bean and legume  option.  Maybe somehow this was the problem.........

I followed the recipe to the letter. There was quite a bit of scorching/residue left on the bottom of the pot when I was done. I wonder if I didn't mix the ingredients well enough before pressure cooking. Next time I'll be sure to try that out.

I cut the cream cheese in half due to the extra rich element, and substituted half and half for the heavy cream.  I would make it again. I've been exploring our pressure cooker for a few months and wanted to get a recipe that was whimsical, and interesting. Like other reviews mentioned it was very soupy at first, but after stirring a bit and cooling, it was great.

This mac and cheese was really good.  It was really saucy and everyone, kids and adults, all loved it.

I used 4 cups broth and 1 cup water (rather than 3 broth, 2 water) so I could use the entire Tetra-pak.  I really like how the recipe uses the entirety of most packages, and that you just toss it all in one pot.  Pushing the volume limits of my 4 Liter (quart) pressure cooker, it was spitting orange liquid when I released the pressure.

I made this.  It is gritty.  But if you stir stir stir before and after it helps. I even added American and a few other cheeses.  I also added two cloves of garlic from my press. Paprika and a couple punches of old bay.  Tastes good.  Now that I have the basics for my first time with insta pot Mac.  I’ll do my own recipe.  I omitted the mustard.

I'm happy to report my noodles didn't stick to the bottom of my pot at all as some users indicated in their reviews. Huzzah for easy cleanup.

It was very simple (dump ingredients in pot, cook, stir), but I found even with some vigorous stirring, the cheese still had a stringy texture.

This is great for convenience, although in future I may just skip the pressure cooker and make it on the stove instead to create a smoother sauce.

(I substituted using vegetable broth and cheddar and mozzarella as that's what I had on hand. I think the recipe's amount of broth/water was good as the pasta didn't stick to my pot and after stirring at the end it got to the desired thickness.)

Tastes great and simple ingredients BUT do not, I repeat do not use your One Pot Pressure cooker for this. I do not know about other pressure cookers, but my One Pot errored out before it got to pressure. To save the dish I stirred and restarted on “rice” setting which is low pressure. The dish was delicious but I had about 1/2” of glued on macaroni at the bottom of the pot that took me two days of soaking and scrubbed to get clean. Maybe if I had started it on low pressure to begin with it might have worked but I am not willing to try again

I followed the recipe to the T. I agree with some of the other people on here it comes out soupy and the cheese isn’t mixed in very well. I cooked it another two minutes and once I took it out of the cooker it did thicken up. Maybe next time I will use less water as another person suggested. I was very disappointed with the bottom of the pan it had noodles and cheese stuck to the bottom that looks like I need to soak over night. The time you save cooking this in a instapot is then added back on clean up time, I might just stick with making Mac and cheese the old fashion way

I followed the instructions and adjusted the cook time to 6 minutes since most recipes overcook pasta. Here's what happened:

-The pasta was cooked perfectly
-None of the cheese was incorporated
-The cream cheese was still in chunks
-It was soupy
-The pasta and sauce was stuck to the bottom

Make of that what you will. It was tasty flavor wise, but I just dont see why I would opt to make mediocre mac and cheese in a pressure cooker if it makes a mess out of the pot.

As far as taste, this is soooo good. It isn't as creamy and smooth as a stove-top or baked version, but flavour-wise it's almost unbeatable. The only issue is adapting the liquid to your pressure cooker. I followed the measurements precisely for 2 servings using a 5-quart, traditional pressure cooker; about 1/3 burned to the bottom. I used Barilla® Gluten Free Rotini. Next time, I will add a bit more water and a bit more cream. Thank you for the recipe.
