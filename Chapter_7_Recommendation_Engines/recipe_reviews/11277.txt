Lacey cookies aren't really traditional cookies they are meant to spread out really thin and be like a light wafer. Baka. When you take them off the cookie sheets you can form them, such as, into tubes. They are great with coffee or tea.

I agree with the previous review.  All of the "cookies" melted together in the oven.  Waste of time.

The cookies spread all over and never got crisp like they should.
