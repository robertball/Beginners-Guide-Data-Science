I took this to a barbecue.  Everyone loved it!  It has a tart but creamy lemon filling, complimented by the light meringue.  I made my own shortcrust pastry and prebaked it for about 18 minutes on 400 (after pricking with a fork and topping with a piece of parchment paper holding uncooked rice).  5 stars!

This is a great and easy recipe. I finally added it to my recipe box here on allrecipes.com. I've made it six times so far with diferent amounts of tartness for example leaving out the zest to adding twice as much ( I love to experiment). Thank you AnnnCollin for posting this.

Followed the recipe almost exactly; I left out the zest.
Perfectly creamy, not too sweet nor too tart. 
Very easy to make, added to my recipes and will make the forever!

This is quick, easy, and delicious! It follows a different path compared to other recipes, but it tastes just as lemony and fresh, and is quite easy so you can't go wrong.

My wife claimed prior to making this that she doesn't like Lemon Meringue Pie. She does now! I added another egg white to have plenty of meringue and it was perfect. I sprinkled with turbinado sugar prior to baking the meringue for an extra garnishing touch.

Turned out great. I added a couple drops of vanilla to the egg white mixture to give it a distinct flavor. Took about 45 minutes to prepare and 5 minutes to be devoured. Three taste testing kids approved!!!

I added a small drop of lemon extract to the filling only because I didn't have fresh lemon and I used constituted lemon juice.

Excellent consistency! Will probably aim for more tartness with more juice and zest and extra meringue next time we make it.

I've now made this pie 6 times, exactly the same way each time.  The first time it was perfect and everyone raved about it.  The next 5 times I've used exactly the same lemons from the same tree and the same milk but the pie never sets.  What on earth could be causing this?????

I haven't made a lemon meringue pie in decades, but felt like trying something different this year for Thanksgiving. I made this and it was very delicious. What my husband and I both liked about it, is it isn't like the bright yellow, gelatin-y versions of our past, this is a little bit more creamy, which was a nice change and I would always make this version in the future if I make another.  Would also like to add this lasted a long time - yes, the meringue changes a bit but ithe last slices were still delicious the week after!
