As a Greek-American family, we eat this often, especially during lent and as a main dish. To improve the cooking method given, try this: saute rice along with onion add minced fresh garlic too, then add  boiling water, cover and simmer for about 10 minutes, then add spinach and tomato sauce, fresh parsley, fresh dill,salt and pepper. Cooked COVERED on low heat and add fresh lemon juice when it's done cooking. Beside the cooking directions, this recipe is authentic.

In Greece spanakorizo is a main dish, not a side - all the better to enjoy more of this healthy, delicious dish!  fresh dill is essential to the recipe however - so much better than dried. Also, 1tbsp tomato paste is preferred in my family to tomato sauce -- you don't want the dish to be too tomato-y.  Otherwise this recipe is spot-on.

This is a really good basic recipe. I normally add some garlic, use chicken broth instead of the water, chopped tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and omit the dill (not to fond of dill). I also add a bit of cumin and cinnamon for flavour. Last time I made it with bulgur instead of rice and it turned out great. Definitely serve with lemon and feta cheese.

Okay---the FLAVOR on this is GREAT, but the cooking directions seem wrongWRONGwrong!!!  I cooked this for nearly 40 minutes uncovered and the rice was still crispy and uncooked!  I think if you cooked this for 25 minutes COVERED, it would come out perfect!  As I said, the FLAVOR is great.  Don't leave out the lemon.  I used parm instead of feta.  I will definitely make this again---with the LID ON... ;-)

This is a very tasty recipe and makes an excellent side dish for Greek Chicken or any grilled shrimp.  However after making it several times there are a couple of things that should be mentioned.  First, if you use 2 pounds of fresh spinach, you need a BIG pot to cook the spinach down in.  Once the spinach wilts it will be one tenth of the volume it started at.  But it takes a big pot told hold the fresh spinach for the first minute.  Of course using thawed frozen spinach solved this problem.  Second, I know of no rice dish that is cooked uncovered.  I cover mine and cook it for 20 minutes and then for 5 minutes more uncovered until it is thick and creamy.  Third, I like to add the rice when I add the spinach.  Allows the rice to soak up some of the flavor of the oil and onion.  Fourth, I sometimes add a couple of cloves of minced garlic during the last minute of cooking the onion.  I depends on what I am serving the dish with and if I want the hint of garlic or not.  Fifth, once the dish is done add 1 table spoon of lemon juice to the pot and stir it in.  This is absolutely mandatory.  Lastly, once you have plated up the dish, sprinkle a tablespoon of feta cheese on top of each serving.  The salty, creamy kick the feta adds makes the dish seem complete.

Being Greek, I have cooked many Greek dishes & pastrys. This is a wonderful dish. I took the advise of the other reviewers and increased the water (to 3 cups) and added 3/4 cup of rice instead of 1/2.  I had to increase the cooking time to 50 minutes (along with adding 1/4 cup of water twice in 10 minute increments for the last 20 minutes of simmer time)in order to get the rice cooked but it was well worth it! A nice side dish with chicken. Topped with feta and lemon juice totally make this dish outstanding! Thanks Kathy!

holy spinach leaves, Popeye! This is a super good way to increase your spinach intake and it actually tastes yummy. It was easy to make too - I had prewashed spinach that I needed to get rid of and the prep time was pretty quick. 
Next time I am going to cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup, but the feta cheese is a must-have! They make reduced fat feta cheese and you can hardly tell the difference.

Lemon and feta a must - dont rate it until you've done it right..  Not a huge spinach fan so we only added defrosed 10 oz the first time and 20 oz of packaged Frozen Spinach the second. I liked best with the 10 oz. We've also tried vegtable & beef broth to substitute water and diced tomatoes instead of sauce - a little garlic on occasion. We make a double batch at least once a month. DELICIOUS - the only way I can get greens into my hubby willingly. My Toddlers LOVE!

This was absolutely excellent. It tastes very authentic.

I used two 10 oz packages of chopped frozen spinach, fresh snipped dill, and instead of 2 cups water I used one cup chicken broth.

This is a favorite of ours!  We make it a lot during lent, but still use it throughout the year.  She's right feta and lemon are great on this, but grated parmesan is good in a pinch too!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this with orzo instead of rice and added feta and lemon as suggested by the other reviewers. We both loved it and thought it tasted very authentic! I think this is going to be one my favorite recipe!

I added scallions & used frozen spinach. Very tasty dish! This is a staple in our household, not just a side dish. Sprinkle it with some great high quality feta to finish.

As another reviewer mentioned, the cooking method could have been better & made this 5 stars. Saute' your rice with the onions & then add the tomato sauce, hot broth/water, spinach & other ingredients. Remember to rinse your dry rice to get rid of some of that extra starch too.

I prepared this last night and served with fried pork shops and a salad.  My husband said it was a very delicious meal.  I made the changes I read from some Greek reviewers.  I used only 2T oil and sauted the rice, onion and garlic first.  Then I added the boiling 3 cups of chicken broth.  I covered and simmered for the 10 minutes.  Then I added 2 pkgs (10 oz) of frozen spinach, thawed and drained, 4T of tomato paste, parsley & dill. I had to use dried as no fresh in the house.  Cook COVERED for 20-25 minutes with a little feta thrown in the last few minutes.  I didn't add the lemon but will next time.  It was NOT mushy.  The texture was great.  We enjoyed the dish and will make again.  Another reviewer suggests this would be good as filling for stuffed peppers or tomatoes.  I think it would definitely be good and will try it.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times, making it slightly different, as I use a rice cooker to cook my rice first, but keeping true to all the ingredients. For my family, adding the feta cheese and a good squeeze of lemon over the rice is a must.

This was delicious. I couldn't stop eating it. These are the changes I made: replaced the tomato sauce with a couple tablespoons of tomato paste, took out the dill and added more parsley instead, added garlic, cooked with the lid ON, and, most importantly, I squeezed a whole lemon and added some crumbled feta at the end. Don't leave out the lemon and feta. They made all the difference.

Very Good. I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of oil.  There is no need for the given amount. The feta cheese and lemon juice is an absolute must.  The whole family loved this dish.  My greek husband was very impressed...I don't think his mom has made a rice dish as nice as this and she's a pretty good cook.  I haven't tried it on her yet.....

This was good, I actually served it as a side dish with chicken breast. My kids love rice, and we usually have some form of spinach once a week. It tasted a little like the rice stuffed grape leaves they make at Armenian and Greek restaurants.

The taste is great but it turned out more like a rice gruel, even with the cover off during the whole cooking process.  3+ cups liquid (water, tomato sauce, olive oil) to 1/2 cup rice is a little too much.  I may try this again but either reduce the water or add more rice.

I loved this. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to add a little garlic with the onion. This makes a great, rich, saucy rice side. I did not have the same problems others did with the cooking instructions. At first, I thought there was no way the rice would soak up that much water and sauce and it seemed strange to cook it without covering the pan. I ended up cooking it a little longer than indicated (just because the rest of the meal was not ready yet) but the came out perfectly cooked and tender.

This rice dish had so much flavor! I didn't have to dig through my cupboard searching for a lid because you cook it uncovered. It goes well with really anything and can be made in a short amount of time.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I used a can of vegetable broth for some of the water for extra flavor.  I also sprinkled some chopped scallions on the top, along with the feta and fresh lemon juice.  Delicious!

Definitely top with feta cheese & lemon juice - makes the dish (it's a bit bland without it).  My hubby that hates spinach thought this was quite tasty.  Lil kiddos ate it all up too!

This was so delicious. I only added 1 large onion and 1 1/2 lbs of fresh spinach. Followed the rest exactly by the recipe. I also used fresh lemon and feta cheese after plating. The rice took quite a bit longer to cook, so next time I will try to cook the rice first and then add it to the spinach mixture. Will definetely make this again. Yummy!!

WOW, YUMMMMMM! Everyone loved this dish.  The only problem I had, which is fixable, was that the rice didn't cook through.  Next time I think I'll cook the rice in my rice cooker and then add it in!  Quick and very easy

My husband and I were making falafels one night and looking for a side dish to go with it.  We decided to give this one a try.  Boy, am I glad we did -- it's wonderful!!  The only thing I do different is to make this with brown rice instead of white.  It takes about 20 more minutes to cook and tastes heavenly!

Be sure to add the feta cheese and the lemon juice -- they really make the dish!

I loved this and gave it 5 stars despite the tweaking I think this recipe called for. 
I too sautéed the dry rice with the onion and garlic (I added). I used chicken broth leftover in the fridge and cut back a bit on the spinach although a bit more or less would make no difference. 
Highly recommend using more rice as it was apparent that even by doubling it the end result was 'soupy' and I could have used more yet. 
I squeezed half a fresh lemon into it in the end and crumbled some Feta AFTER removing it from the heat. So, so good!

I loved the flavors.  I just could not prepare it as written.  I started out following the recipe to the T, just because I don't think it is fair to rate the recipe without giving it your all.  Anyway, fresh spinach lets out a great deal of water, so with just the !/2 of a cup of rice, it was very soupy.  I had to look at the photos to realize something was way off.  I wound up adding an extra cup of rice to the recipe as it is now written...then, it was fine.  I think you just need to consider the liquid content against the amount of rice to make it work.  I would make it again in a heartbeat though...healthy and yummy!  Thank you.

This is so good - but I definitely agree with the other reviewers: the rice will NOT cook unless you cover the pot. The two pounds of spinach seems like a lot but ends up being perfect. I used fresh dill and skipped the parsley; instead of tomato sauce, I used some pureed tomatoes, around a half a cup, and added some tomato paste. (It seems to me that the tomato aspect of this dish is pretty forgiving.) We were amazed at how good it is for something so simple! This and a loaf of good bread was dinner. Definitely don't skip the feta and lemon. Four stars because of the cooking method listed here; the taste is 5 stars!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used 2 tbs tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.  The dill taste was too strong almost overpowering and there was way too much olive oil.   I served this with seared salmon. Feta and lemon are a MUST!

I followed the other suggestion of changing the cooking method: saute onion (with a little minced garlic) and rice until onion is translucent.  Added 1 chicken bouillon cube to two cups of water, boiled and threw into pot when onion was done.  Simmered 10 minutes, added herbs and 1T tomato paste.  It was very good, added lemon when it was done cooking, the only thing that would have made it better was adding Feta cheese, per some other suggestions.

My changes... frozen spinach, thawed and drained; tomato paste instead of sauce but that resulted in adding water; cooked the rice in chicken consomme in a rice cooker; sauteed onion, added garlic and spinach; added cooked rice; added paste with seasoning and just stirred until blended. Two tablespoons lemon juice and toasted pine nuts topped this off.

I've never seen a dish go so fast at a large family gathering! I followed the suggestion about saute the rice with onions and garlic, followed by the rest of the ingredients.  I did however cut down a bit on the spinach and added feta cheese into right before serving.  Young and old loved it!

This was awesome! I will definitely be making this again as an alternative to typical side dishes. Just a hint, I doubled the recipe, but if you are doing this, do not double the amount of oil as it made my dish a bit greasy. That was just my own fault though...the recipe is wonderful!

A really good recipe when you follow the directions.  Make sure you don't cover it while simmering... it will be watery and the texture won't be right.

This recipe was wonderful.  Though my children wouldn't eat it (which wasn't a surprise), my husband and I loved it.

I, too, added chopped tomatoes and chopped baby bella mushrooms to the mixture.  

Delicious!  I will certainly be adding this to my list of favorites!

I think this turned out the way it is supposed to.  My parents and I and my wife all thought it was good.  I cooked it for 40 minutes to get the rice to soften up.  Is the rice supposed to be al dente?  I used froz spinach and my own chicken broth for the water.  I added a whole cup of rice and with all the liquid I added didn't think it would be a problem to get it cooked.  My parents liked it without the feta and lemon.  My wife and I liked it with.  I think I will partially pre-cook the rice in broth before adding to other ingredients.

I used only one large onion and one 16oz bag of frozen spinach.  I served with grilled salmon and rolls.  This was one of the best dinners we've had in a long time!  I can't wait to make this again for guests.

I made this with the Greek Style Chicken.  It is really good but I did not use tomato sauce - just diced tomatoes.  Also I made it with one cup of rice.  It was a great side dish.

Great recipe! Okay...now I did change things up, but with a truly great recipe, that's allowable. =) I used Okinawa Spinach that I have growing in mass in my garden, 1/4 c olive oil, 1 onion, diced tomatoes with chilies (added a great kick!), 1-1/2 c rice, 3 c hot water, and after it cooked, I added 1/2 c grated parmesan, 1 tsp dillweed, and 1 tsp seasoning salt. Sprinkled parmesan on top. Really wish I had feta or a lemon! Wonderful! (And a new recipe for that Okinawa spinach. LOL)

Great side dish to chicken or pork.  We absolutely love this dish.  My husband is Greek, and had something similar growing up.  I only use one medium sized onion and no feta.  We love it as a leftover as well.

I made this according to the most helpful suggestion of ReneeFS. I added a pinch of cinnamon and cumin which gave the dish that warm Greek flavor.  (This might have been a little too tomato-ey, though.)

Very good - easy too and only one skillet to clean!  I did make some modifications so that the flavors would go better with the Italian-based marinade that I used on pork loin chops.  The tomato sauce was flavored with garlic-basil-oregano and instead of water I used tomato juice.  A healthy amount of Italian Seasoning and parmesan cheese intensified the Italian flavor.  Next time I'll plan ahead and make it following the recipe and suggestions for a Greek side dish.

Just made this tonight for dinner.  After reading the recipe I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out...looks like such simple seasonings.  But the flavors really come together well, especially with the sprinkle of fresh lemon juice and feta cheese once it's cooked.  I made a few minor changes in the liquid to rice ratio to suit our rice "style".  We don't like mushy or wet rice and the recipe has a lot of liquid for such a small amount of rice... especially for jasmine rice which is what we buy.  Usually I do 1 1/2 cups liquid to 1 cup rice, so for this recipe I used 2 cups broth, 1 cup tomato sauce, and increased the rice to 2 cups.  I also used 1 1/2 bags (10 ozs. each) of fresh spinach leaves.  Everything else I did as per the recipe...oh except I cooked it covered with a tight-fitting lid for the recommended time.  Definitely do not forget to sprinkle fresh lemon juice and feta!  I served this with Spicy Chicken Shawarma from Cooking Light, homemade pita bread, and plenty of tomatoes and cucumbers.  We will be making this again and again.  Thank you for the wonderful change from our regular rice dishes!

This was an average recipe.  A little on the bland side, but if you add enough Feta cheese, it develops more taste.

i have tried a lot of recipes on this website and they have been quiet good. However, this recipe deserves a rating of 5 stars from me. The only thing I changed was, instead of water, I added 2 cups of chicken broth. I also used orzo instead of the rice. I sprinkled the feta and a squeeze of lemon and devoured it. All I can so is OPA!!! must try

This is wonderful and a huge hit. What I changed. used 2 16oz frozen spinach. Did not thaw or dry first. used 3 3/4 c water and small can tomato paste. Cooked coverd. I did add 2 tbs lemon juice and in the end threw in a package of feta (to help salt up the taste) added some greek seasoning to taste. Yummy

I made a couple of modifications to this dish, and it came out fantastic! I used brown rice instead of white, and since it seemed like many reviewers didn't agree with the cooking method, I made my own. I pre-cooked my rice (about 20-30 minutes for brown rice) and then dumped it into the pan in which I had sauteed the garlic and fresh spinach. I added a little sun-dried tomato and grape tomatoes that I crushed and chopped instead of tomato sauce. I added a little salt, dill, lemon zest and juice, and crumbled feta, and let it simmer just a minute or two until some of the liquid evaporated off the rice and tomatoes. I couldn't believe how yummy this came out, and I will definitely make it again soon!

Came out perfectly as I used a rice cooker and reduced liquids to 2 parts liquid (water &/or broth) to 1 part rice.  Used a can of diced tomatoes with liquids instead of chopped fresh tomatoes &/or tomato paste.  Used veg bullion as well for taste.  Very delicious and my fussy daughter ate some as well.

Amazing! Mine turned out really creamy, kinda like a greek risotto. I upped the rice to just under a cup, and used just under 4 cups of chicken broth diluted with water. I added lemon juice and grated parmesan at the end. I served it with greek salad and pork souvlaki - tastsed just like a meal from a "real" Greek restaurant!

This is very good. My husband refused to try it, but I suppose that's his loss. I did have to use tomato paste rather than sauce since that's all I had on hand, and I also used couscous rather than rice. The lemon juice and feta cheese added at the end are a definite must. This went very well with Grecian Pork Tenderloin from this site.

An excellent recipe.  Made the recipe for 4 (more or less) and used it as a main course for 2 and it was just right.  Used a  little over half a pound of frozen spinach, one medium onion, two cloves garlic minced, a teaspoon of dried basil, half teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and a bit more than 2 cups of water as the only modifications to the recipe.

This recipe is wonderful and so easy. I usually serve it Turkish style and add plain yogurt on the side. Some suggestions I would make would be to bring a cup of water to a boil, remove from heat, then add the uncooked rice and cover for 15 minutes. The rice absorbs the water but does not cook completely and this prevents it from stealing flavors from the other ingredients. I also would add garlic, and every once in awhile throw in some ground beef. Also, I usually soak the spinach in salt water 30 minutes before I cook it, then wash it extremely well to remove any grit. Overall though, this recipe is a keeper! Afiyet olsun! (Turkish for "Bon Appétit or enjoy your meal!)

I picked out this recipe as a way to use up some leftover spinach, but after I tried it I put it right into my 'favorite recipes' file. Now I make it once every couple weeks. I love the flavor of this dish, and it's warm and comforting in the winter. You do have to stir the rice every 5 minutes or so to prevent the top layer from getting crunchy, but other than that I didn't have a problem with the recipe. Per other reviews, I usually use about 2 T olive oil, less spinach, and a little garlic powder. I also like to add a can of garbanzo beans and a little tomato paste for extra flavor. And of, course, it's not the same without some lemon juice and feta sprinkled on top!

This was amazing!  Though I did tweak the recipe as i always do...i used  much less oil, only one large onion, 10oz bag frozen spinach, one pureed tomato and one cup vegetable broth.  The feta and fresh lemon juice for topping is imperative!

I make this all the time now, but I don't really follow it exactly.  I found that it was a really good recipe to get your greens in, so if I don't have spinach, I'll use swiss chard, beet greens, as well as spinach or a combination of whatever i have.  I also use brown rice for the whole grain value but found i had to cook it forever to soften the rice so i pre-cook it for a little while, then toss it in. I think I laso double the dill and add tons of garlic ( I love garlic) This is a very adaptable recipe, you can pretty much do whatever you want with it.

Super!  Really wonderful.  I only used a 9 oz bag of spinach since it took forever to de-stem and I ran out of time to add any more (probably because I had two 18-month old "helpers").  It was still plenty spinach-y although I might try to add more next time.  And, halfway through the recipe I realized I was out of white rice so I used a risotto rice.  It turned out fine, but again, next time I'll try to follow the recipe.  I served this as a main dish with feta and lemon on top, and pitas and hummus on the side.  My husband and I both loved it, as did one of our toddlers (oh well, you can't please them all).  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for the yummy dinner!

Oh wow! I loved this- my husband is not a fan of spinach so he did not care for it much. I followed others users advice and did 3/4 cup rice and 3 cups of liquid. After a few minutes alot of the water seemed to absorb so I covered it since that is normally how I cook basmatiti rice and it just seemed like the right thing to do. It came out awesome and I will be making it again!

This was quite tasty!  I used 3 10oz. boxes of frozen spinach and added some cayenne with the seasonings.  The lemon and feta really bring the flavors together.  Hubby threw Tabasco on top, but hubby does that to EVERYTHING.  Served it with grilled Greek chicken from this site and it was great - and very filling.

This was fantastic!  I had to change the recipe slightly because I didn't have tomato sauce or fresh spinach.  I used 300g of frozen spinach, thawed and chopped, and I added a big chopped tomato to make up for not having tomato sauce.  I added 1 cup of rice instead of a 1/2 cup and I used 2 1/2 cups of water.  It took about 30 - 35 minutes to cook, with the lid on.  The rice was perfectly cooked and the flavours were so yummy.  The feta and lemon juice made it even better!  This will be a regular in our house.

I used one 6 ounce bag of fresh spinach, one-half of an onion and one whole cup of rice, to make a rice dish with spinach, instead of a spinach dish with rice. Add a little additional water and cook for longer to get the rice done. Definately add the lemon juice!

This is a staple at our house.  A little bit of lemon squeezed on top with some crumbled feta is a must!!  This is easy to make and good warmed up later.  Kathy W. must be Greek,  I like a lot of her recipes.

I had never had spanakorizo until just a few weeks ago when I made it as a side dish to go with gyros. Needless to say, my husband and I were so impressed with how delicious this was. We followed the modified directions from ReneeFS and always squeeze some fresh lemon juice and add crumbled feta when ready to serve. So good!

Good, easy side dish.  I followed recommendations and topped with the juice of 1 lemon and feta. Otherwise, followed recipe to a T.  I can't imagine it without lemon and feta.  Even the kids liked it. The fam commented that it didn't look great, but tasted great.  I think maybe diced tomatoes might have made the dish look better than the tomato sauce, but then again the kids probably wouldn't have eaten it if they saw chunks of tomatoes.  Definitely will make again.

I liked this. It was different. I bought a jumbo bag of spinach from the regular grocery store and realized it was still only 16oz! So, I ended up making a half a recipe which made about 4 good sized side servings. The recipe was easy to follow and accurate. I may try this again at another time with the feta and lemon juice suggestion. I don't typically cook spinach this long or dark, but it seemed like it was still fairly healthy. When it was done I added a pinch of garlic powder, onion powder, and a quick sprinkle of Adobo seasoning. ty

This came out really soupy.  Next time I will either add more rice or use less water. But the taste was good.

Although this dish didn't look particularly appetizing, it tasted amazing! My husband declared that he loves spinach cooked this way- I will definitely make this again.

Very sorry, but I believe this recipe is overrated. It was very bland. It would have needed a lot of feta & lemon for it to taste better. Also took way to long to make.

I loved; husband disliked dill weed.  I used canned petite diced tomatoes...and topped with feta cheese which made all the difference in the world.

I would give this 10 stars! One of my new favorite foods. After just one bite my (meat-and-potatoes) husband begged me to make this weekly! The lemon and feta on top totally makes the dish.

I made this last night for the first time for my group of friends that get together each week to have dinner and watch Lost, and we all LOVED it! We doubled the recipe, which then called for 4 onions and 4 pounds of spinach, but that seemed like too much. So we only used 1 red onion and 1 16 oz bag of frozen chopped spinach and that was plenty. Make sure you top it off with fresh lemon and feta cheese for maximum yumminess!!!!

tasty and healthy, with some alterations!  I used pre-cooked instant brown rice flavored with chicken broth, eyeballed the olive oil, used extra tomato paste, and finished it off with dill, lemon juice, and as really really should be listed in the recipe--feta cheese!  it tasted a lot like a fattening creamy tomato risotto I ate a restaurant once, except it was so healthy!

Lemon and feta a must. Used quick cooking brown rice in place of white rice.  Added 3 cloves of garlic with onion.  Used chicken broth in place of water. This is a healthy tasty dish :)

This was AWESOME!!!  The only things I did differently were: used a can of diced tomatoes, undrained in place of tomato sauce, and used brown rice instead of white.  I will definitley be making this again!

Yummy. Four servings as stated in the recipe were enough to feed two carnivores (as sides) and one vegetarian (as the main). I used 1 tbsp tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, and used fresh spices. Also added 2 minced cloves of garlic and and quartered plum tomatoes. The fresh lemon and feta is a must!

Really good!  I did as another poster suggested and used chicken broth instead of water.  Also, I agree that simmering it COVERED for 20-25 minutes is the way to go.

This was wonderful.  I made this for a gathering we had for our neighbor's mother who visits here from Greece every summer.  I added fresh dill and crumbled feta on top for garnish.  When the feta was mixed in to the dish it melted slightly which took this to a whole different level.  All of my "Crazy Greek" friends and neighbors who were present said that this reminded them of the rice their family made back in the old country.  That there my friends is what I call a compliment.

Very close to Mom's recipe (but I won't tell her). We have always topped each individual serving with a dash of fresh lemon to really punch up the flavours.
Like another reviewer stated, we too have this as a main dish but also have fresh bread, feta cheese and olives to go with it.

Very good. I was concerned about the small amount of rice but in the end we had enough for the 6 of us. I served this with the greek meatballs on this site, and I added to lemon juce as suggested. I did not have the feta but used parmesan like others had suggested and it was really very good!

It was very good, but the portions were a little off, it seemed to make a lot more than it said it would. Maybe I used 2 large onions, when I should have used small ones. And 2 pounds of spinach seems like a lot of spinach, so I only used about 4oz, and could have used the whole 6oz bag. I used some lemon pepper, which seemed to enhance the flavors well.

Yumm!  this was good.  I used brown rice because that is all we eat so the cook time was longer.  I put in about 1/4 cup of feta and I feel like it was too much.  But you really need the feta and lemon.  I also cooked it in chicken broth not water for more flavor.  I am going to double it next time and eat it as a meal instead of a side.

Really good!  Changes I made were:  used less than 1 lb of spinach and since I didn't have a jar of tomato sauce, used 3/4 of a can of tomato soup and 1/3 of a can of tomato paste.  Turned out great!  Next time I will try with tomato sauce and I'll bet it's even better!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Yummy! I did make some changes: I used a one lb bag of frozen chopped spinach, a bag of frozen precooked brown rice from TJ's, a 15oz can of tomato sauce, and only 1/4 cup of water (because the rice was already cooked).  It complemented our "marinated chicken pitas" from this site very well!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for the first time and was so pleased.  I used a nutty red rice and added a good squeeze of lemon and crumbled feta cheese as suggested in the recipe notes.  It was really good leftover the next day too.

I try so hard to eat healthy, and I usually buy a huge bag of spinach and try to find different ways to eat it up.  This is for sure one of the best ways yet. I followed it to the recipe and it was yummers. Thanks

This was really good, even my kids liked it!  I used a 6oz bag of baby spinach (no cleaning) and 2/3 cup of rice, covering the pot after I added the rice.  Served with a chicken dish and turned out great.  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe. It was surisingly filling and smooth, not bland like I thought it would be. I did add some lemon and a handful of diced mushrooms because I needed to use them up. Even my husband who is a self proclaimed onion hater gobbled it up. This is a great way to get your leafy greens in. Will definately make again.

I loved this but next time I will try to use slightly less oil and half the onions.  I had fun making a "greek night" with several recipes off of this site.  I thought they all turned out very well considering I am not the most talented of cooks.

This was surprisingly simple and delishous! Sort of creamy and stick to your ribs comforting. And healthy! I added the lemon juice at the end (maybe a tablespoon and a half) and kept tasting for my salt liking. Didn't even need the feta. Also used a bag of fresh spinach that was about 1 pound, but added half a diced zucchini I had. Fresh dill was a MUST.  I don't normally like dill, but once I started chopping the fresh stuff I could totally understand why it's so important to this dish. Perfectly paired. Will make often. Thank you for posting!

10 STARS !! I could have eaten the entire dish :-), even without using feta & lemon.    I did use chicken broth instead of water (the Rachel Ray trick).  If you're only a mild spinach fan, I would use half as much spinach.  I used baby spinach and didn't bother removing the stems.

I made this exactly as directed and my husband went nuts over it!  I loved it, too.  I will definitely keep this on the list as a great side.  I served it with Greek inspired tacos for Taco Tuesday.

This dish and I will have a long affair. I get spinach to commingle with rice and then with the feta on top, Wow. Like the lady said, it really was heaven. Next time some garlic perhaps and chopped tomatoes. Yea, it's on!

I used brown rice and substituted the dill weed for oregano because i didn't have the dill. I also used fresh parsley instead of dried. It was pretty good, but I will use less tomato sauce next time. I also added a clove of garlic as it seemed it would lack flavour otherwise.

This seems to be the closest I have found online to direct people I meet at work or gatherings. I always tell them to keep the lid on when simmering, check frequently so the rice doesn't "DRINK" all the liquid in the pan. Also, my Mother used one heaping tablespoon of tomato paste and worked it in to the dish very carefully. This IS a main dish. Often eaten in the summer when the vegetables and herbs are fresh in the garden. Different regions in Greece and individual families have given it their own twist. This was usually served with pan fried fish, home baked bread, cheese and olives.

I was totaly surprised by this recipe. It is fantastic! I used frozen spinach and a little more rice than called for. I didnt want to open a whole can of tomato sauce so I used some leftover pizza sauce.(good move) I did add garlic too, The lemon and feta send it over the top. I cooked it covered ,I like my rice soft. Served it with lamb chops and asparagus.
 Tonight I'm using the leftover rice to stuff peppers and top with more feta and sauce. Serving with greek salad. Thank you for the recipe Kathy W.

Instead of 3 lbs of spinach, we used 1/2 lb. stemmed and chopped. 1 cup of rice, and an extra can of tomato sauce. Delish!

The mingling of flavors was delish. I used vegetable broth in lieu of water and included a crushed clove of garlic to the onion saute. Rather than tomato sauce, I used a can of diced tomato. The fresh lemon squeezed at the end with feta was yummy. Thanks for sharing!

Several comments mention lemon, but lemon is not in the recipe -- how much to use?  (I'm sure it tastes good with the spinach.)

This was very good once I made several changes and additions to the original recipe.  I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 3/4 cup basmati rice instead, and 20 oz. of frozen spinach.  I added two minced cloves of garlic, and used one tblspn. each of fresh dill and parsley instead of the dried stuff.  At the end and prior to serving, I added the juice of two lemons, plus 1/8 tsp. each of cinnamon and cumin, plus about a tbspn. of crushed red pepper--otherwise it would have been too bland for my taste.  I cooked the whole thing in my dutch oven, and it took double the time as mentioned in the recipe to provide the well-cooked and creamy consistency I was seeking. I served this with crumbled feta cheese, cut up black olives and fresh lemon pieces for squeezing. My husband rated it 4 1/2 stars: he was pleased. 
 
Next time I may substitute basil and cilantro for the dill weed and parsley, and use canned diced tomatoes in their liquid instead of sauce.  I may also top with toasted pine nuts.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because the basic recipe was good for starters but would have been rather bland had I stuck to the recommended ingredients.  I'd also like to add that it does NOT take five mins. prep time: if you have fresh spinach you need to cut it up, if you use frozen you should thaw it.  Plus if you use fresh ingredients (dill, parsley) those also takes some time chopping.  Next time I will used canned diced tomatoes in their juice, and basil and cilantro instead of dill and parsley.

This was a very similar recipe I've tried years ago. I would recommend using stewed Italian style tomatoes instead of the regular and like the other reviewers, use chicken broth instead of the water. Very simple to make.

Very good. I followed the suggestion to saute the onions, garlic and rice together, then add the water. I used brown rice and it took quite a while to cook. Used 1 tablespoon of tomato paste instead of the can of sauce and replaced the dill and parsley with oregano and greek seasoning. Added feta and lemon juice to taste. My 3 year old cleaned her plate!

This was an interesting dish.  I haven't had much Greek food.  I'm undecided about whether or not I'd make this again- there was a strange bite to it that I wasn't in love with.

This was by-far the best mediteranean rice I have made! This was absolutely delicious! It was just like the rice you eat at a Greek restaurant...I paired this recipe with others from this site: Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce and Mediterranean Chicken...I couldnt have asked for a better dinner...everyone loved it! Thank you so much for such a delicious recipe! =P

I found this to be a bit sweet tasting (could be difference in European tomato and American tomato), but extremely good. It would be great with shrimp in it as well. I don't know if it was the rice I used, but found my cooking time after I added the rice was nearly doubled. Overall, a very tasty dish I will make again.

This was a good way to use the leftover spinach.  I wasn't expect my family to like it but they absolutely loved it.  The lemon at the end was a must and I used cilantro instead of parsley.  Really great recipe.

Really good recipe that is easy to make, tastes good, and is healthy too. I used much less olive oil, basil instead of dill, and a can of diced tomatoes with the juice instead of the tomato sauce. This was a great vegetarian main course!

Wow did this go over well.  I cooked it as part of our weekly family dinner with my wife's grandfather and great aunt.  Tonight it was Greek-themed, and this dish stole the show.  We followed a couple of the recommendations, namely to use stock instead of water, add the rice with the onions, and add some chopped garlic to the mix as well.  Topped off with lemon and feta, it was superb!  Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!

My family just did not care for this dish.  There were complaints of it being greasy and having too much spinach and onion and not enough dill.  I do like the idea of rice, lemon and dill together though so this may be a recipe that I will experiment with.  Thanks for posting it.

This was really,really good! I can't think of any way to improve it except next time I might try it with brown rice,diced tomatoes and chopped up spinach. But a good,different way to eat spinach.

Thank you, Tigerdyr, for the modifications.  I didn't add garlic, but I did use chicken broth and chopped tomatoes, cinnamon and cumin.  With the feta cheese and lemon juice, this dish was awesome!  My hubs gave it a 9 on a scale of 10, and that's saying something for someone who is very picky about how he likes his spinach prepared!:-)  And, thanks Kathy W., for the original recipe. :-)

I Loved this recipe, in place of the tomato sauce (didn't have any), I used fresh garden tomatoes. And definetly serve it with the fresh lemon and feta.  I also did not have fresh spinach and I used frozen (thawed and squeezed out liquid).  Turned out great will have to try it with all the correct ingredients.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe

the perfect lunch!!!

 Although, I added another can of tomatoes, and a can of garbanzos. Also, I added a couple of links of turkey sausage to make it a complete meal. I also switched the white rice with brown rice. and i added juice of 1/2 lemon. Garnish with feta cheese. I eat it every day for lunch!

Very yummy! I used 1 onion and 1 can of spinach, and substituted orzo for the rice. I cooked the orzo separately then added it to the rest of the simmering ingredients. Also, I used about 3 bouillion cubes, 1 for the orzo boil and 2 for the spinach mix. I added about 1/4 cup water instead of what was called for since I cooked the orzo separately. Threw in feta and lemon juice and it was so yummy!

Was this ever good!  Very tasty.  I made it for 8 servings but with 2 onions and two 9oz. bags of spinach and that was plenty.  Added 1 t. of garlic powder.  Used one 16oz. can of tomato sauce and  3 tomatoes, diced, with it.  I messed up and put the tomato sauce and tomatoes in first then the spinach so I just cooked it down in it.  I'll do it in the right order (hopefully) next time but it sure didn't seem to make a difference.  Like another reviewer said, it is great comfort food.  So easy and so tasty.  Thanks!

I know I probably took this recipe in a completely different direction than intended but it turned out to be a great main dish that the whole family devoured.
I used 1/8 c. oil, 1 onion, 1 bag spinach (only 6oz), no spices other than s & p (heavy on the pepper), brown rice and added 1/2 lb. smoked turkey sausage. We all (even the kids) enjoyed it. Served it w/ crusty bread.  Yum!  Great cold weather food!

My boyfriend only thought it was okay-- but that he ate something with spinach at all was surprising.

Fantastic!  I had an excessive amount of fresh spinach that was on its last leg and this was the perfect fix.  I used brown rice and added fresh crushed garlic but other than that I followed the recipe.  It even reheated well...super yummy.

Pretty good, nice change to regular rice. Needs lemon to enhance the flavors, I did not use feta cheese (do not need extra calories), used less spinach and added tomato.

The only thing different I did was this was use one box of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry.  I made the rice seperate, then mixed together.  I added feta & fresh squeezed lemon just before serving.  Didn't get raves, it was just ok.  I think maybe I didn't like the texture that much.

I am a beginner at cooking and this recipe still came out great! It has a nice mediterranean taste with plenty of flavor. I made it with garithes yiovetsi from this site for a Greek themed dinner and they tasted fantastic together! This recipe took me a while to make but I will certainly make again when there is the time.

This was really good! The flavor wasn't that stong, but it was so quick and easy to prepare! The lemon and feta cheese is a definite must! I aslo added some green onions, along with the dill which really added a strong flavor. I loved the spinach! Thanks!

This is a nice side dish.  I used brown rice, and since it takes longer to make, I cooked it in my microwave rice cooker; then added it to the onion/spinach/tomato sauce mixture along with 1/2 c chicken broth, and with the juice of one large lemon, which I wouldn't want to leave out.  I forgot to buy feta, so used parmesan instead and it was very good.  This dish smelled a little funky as it cooked, but the end result was tasty and had that Greek spinach taste to it (sort of like the spinach taste in spanakopita).  Feta would have been a good addition.

I used less water as some other reviewers suggested, but only had to add water later.  After 30 minutes the rice was still not cooked, so I put a lid on the pan.  I like fluffier rice, so next time I may cook the plain rice and stir in the rice, onions and tomato sauce afterward.  I have to give it four stars for the flavor and the lemon and feta!!

My husband is Greek and we know good Greek food when we taste it!  This is an excellent and easy to prepare dish.  Sometimes we add shrimp to it.

I doubled it,  and I could not fathom using 4 onions for only 1 cup of rice,  so I only put 2 onions. That is the only change I made.  It did not turn out at all for me.  The rice out mushy.

I followed other's suggestions and used a whole diced tomato rather than the paste/ sauce and cooked the dish covered. At the beginning I also added some fresh garlic and cooked with the rice ( I increased the rice to 3/4 cup). To serve we topped with feta cheese and some lemon juice. The rice was moist and tasty along with Greek pork roast.

Made this as a side dish and it was okay,  but if I was to make it again I would make the spinach and rice separately then mix them before serving.  As is the rest of the dish gets overcooked while you wait for the rice to finish cooking and it really loses flavor.

It was good twist for a rice dish but def. way to much spinach for my taste. I always adding can of stewed tomatoes vs. tomato sauce. I couldn't image it without the texture of the tomato. I also did a 1 1/2 cup rice bc after adding all of the ingredients i noticed the liquid to rice was not going to pan out with just 1/2 cup. All in all i thought it was a success due to my changes! My husband ate his whole serving!

This is the basic Greek version, but since my daughter became a vegetarian, I have found ways to improved dishes like this family favorite.  To this I delete tomato sauce, substitute stewed tomatoes and a can of garbanzo.  That way with a chunk of garlic bread you have protein and a great healthy meal with your salad.

Yes, this was very good. I used 2 boxes of frozen chopped spinach, and it seemed to overwhelm the dish. Next time, I will use only one.

This is a nice recipe.  I reduce the amount of olive oil, add garlic and use oregano instead of parsley.  A must is covering the pot, while it is simmering.  Adding lentils makes this into a nice main dish.  Don't forget the feta and lemon juice!

This has got potential, but the first run as written was only average for me. Dish tasted good, but directions were off. Dish didn't cook in 20-25 minutes, rice(I did use white) wasn't done until about 40 minutes. And then there were still kernels undone. It was also very soggy, 2 cups of water was way too much. It think it was a combo of the 2 cups water, tomato sauce and the water left on the spinach leaves that souped it up. Perhaps the spinach should be wilted and squeezed dry? The tomato paste some have recommended instead of the sauce? Precook the rice for 10 minutes then add the rest? I will try again because the leftovers were fantastic the next day so the potential is there. Just have to tweek the technique

This is a delicious recipe.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it's definitely best served with feta and lemon, so don't forget those.  (If you don't use them, you'll need to add more salt.)  I followed the advice of one reviewer to simmer covered instead of uncovered after adding the rice, but the rice couldn't absorb that much liquid.  I recommend following the recipe on that count and just simmering uncovered.  You can always add more water if necessary.

Every Greek family I know has their own way of making certain dishes..... I grew up loving my moms version of Spanakorizo and now I make it my own, instead of chopping the onions, I grate them, NO tomatoes or tomatoe paste, NO dill or any herbs added just simple salt and pepper and when the dish is complete and ready to serve I squeeze lotsa lemon :)

This is so good!  I made it exactly as written and it came out great!  I did have to cook it a little longer fo the rice to be fully cooked (used Abrorio rice), more like 30 minutes, but it was well worth the wait.  Made it with ARs Marinated Greek Chicken Kabobs and it was a FANTASTIC dinner!  BF LOVED it!  Will definately make this one again, and often.  I know Greek's use this as a main dish, and I'll do that sometime too since it's so hearty and yummy. THANKS!!!

I added feta, substituted chicken broth for water and added oregano.  I really wanted to like this recipe because I love spinach and Greek food.  We "go Greek" about three times a month, but this recipe was missing something.  Its consistency was a bit soggy, and it was a little bland.  I think the spinach made it too bitter.  Perhaps a touch of sugar would balance the bitterness?  But it was very time consuming to prpare, and with the feta and two bags of spinach, a mite expensive for a side dish.  It wasn't bad, but not worth the effort and cost.

Not really a fan, I don't care too much for mushy spinach with soggy rice. Maybe with a little tweaking this could be better, but not even the feta and lemon could save this:(

I made this as a main dish per another comment and felt that it was missing something.  This would probably make a great side dish which is what I would use it for moving forward.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and some cumin as well and would recommend using less tomato sauce.

Not a family favorite. It just didn't appease our taste buds.

This was ok, but not sure if I would make it again. Even with the fresh lemon and feta, it still came out a little too bland for my tastes.

I used way less olive oil then the recipe recommends...probably about 2 tbsp. I was out of white rice so I used brown. It was okay with the brown but I think it would be even better with white. I had a bunch of mushrooms to use up so I added some of those too (I sauteed them with the onion). I topped with some feta and lemon juice and it was pretty good!

mushy texture, other than tomato it didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I added some cumin, lemon juice and a whole lotta pepper and it still didn't knock my socks off.
