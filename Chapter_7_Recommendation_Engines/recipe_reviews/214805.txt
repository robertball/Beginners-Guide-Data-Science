Good but have had better. The hubby can't eat raw tomatoes, so as well as the normal batch, I made a batch with bell peppers instead. Chopped the peppers and boiled them for 8 minutes. Then shocked them in ice water. Wanted them not raw, but still crisp. The batch with the peppers in place of the tomatoes completely outshone the first batch. Even tomato lovers were snagging the pepper batch instead.

This was a hit for Christmas Eve!  I left out the fennel and used white onions.  I used whole wheat bread cut up into small squares.  Everybody loved it!  Very good!

Thank you for the recipe!  So good.  I couldn't find fennel seeds, so I added 1 tbs balsamic for extra flavor.  I also didn't add onions, but put in extra garlic.  Such a wonderful light lunch or snack for a vegan diet.  Yummy!

i understand that the name of the recipe indicates that the fennel taste will be pronounced.. but this was just too fennel-y for me.. it felt out of place.. i ended up topping my bruschetta with some grated mozz to save the dish
