Oh boy, did we enjoy this salad! Very creative idea Candice, thanks for sharing it. I've made it twice within just a couple days. First time I made it as written and we had it for dinner over whole wheat couscous with a green salad on the side. The next evening DH said why don't we have it for lunch the next day! This time I used toasted sliced almonds instead of peanuts and added some chopped cilantro. Also I reduced the soy to just 1t. since we're both cutting back on salt. Anyway, it was great both ways, but I think I'm going to continue the cilantro addition because we both love that flavor. What a great keeper recipe!

This was really good Candice! The only changes I made was that I used lime instead of lemon (I love lime with curry), and I didn't have distilled white vinegar, so I used seasoned rice vinegar. I also used light mayo (will try yogurt next time), added more red pepper flakes to match our tastes, and tossed in some lemon cucumbers and sugar snow peas from my garden. That's what's so great about this recipe - it's perfect as is, but it would work with chicken and any other veggies you prefer. A keeper, for sure. Thank you!

I did not have any dates on hand and replaced the mayonnaise with greek yogurt (a standard of mine to lower the fat content).  I thought the flavors were really good but I think next time I will add one more chopped vegetable (probably celery), and lower the amount of tofu.  Or else maybe I cut the tofu into too big of pieces because it just seemed to be too much tofu.  Otherwise I really liked it!

Seriously, who came up with this? It's such a strange mix of ingredients and they all work PERFECTLY together. I change nothing and make it exactly as it is written. I have probably made this recipe 5 times and every time it's even better somehow. So good, so smart and so good for you. Thank you!

A wonderful combination of flavors. I used rice wine vinegar and because there would be a delay in eating the salad I added 1 tablespoon of smooth peanut peanut butter to the dressing and left out the peanuts. We wrapped the salad in lettuce leaves. It was a hit.

I have to admit that I am totally addicted to the Red Curry Tofu salad from Weaver Street Market (similar to a Whole Foods) and I tried this recipe in hopes that it would be similar. It was not even close, very disappointing and after all the time it took to make.

Wonderful salad.  Baking the tofu first helps it hold together.  I cut the tofu into 3/4 inch cubes and it worked out well.  This is the only tofu recipe I have that even non-vegetarians rave about.  I often get asked for the recipe.

Awesome recipe. Baking the tofu is a great idea for this salad. We made it as is, except we used raisins instead of dates, since we had no dates. We also used fresh jalapeno from the garden, instead of crushed peppers. I may try apples instead of raisins or dates one of these days too.

The wife added cilantro last time we made this - and the salad rocked even harder!

Keep in mind this recipe may change significantly depending on what curry powder you use. Curry powders are not all the same.

Very good salad. I used garlic salt instead of the fresh, and it was good like that. The only thing I'd try different next time was to let it sit longer, maybe overnight, so that the flavors could blend more and absorb into the tofu.

I really like this recipe. My store was out of dates, so I used prunes and it works well. I ate in in lettuce wraps and pita. Filling, flavorful with a kick. I will be making again!

Oh this is so good! A great recipe for tofu. I added some diced zucchini and celery and subbed grapes for the dates (what I had on hand). In the future I'm going to try using less soy sauce and mayo, maybe try subbing plain yogurt for the mayo. Healthy, yummy, easy!

this is one of those perfect recipes where you can start with the crux of it and improvise with what you have in your kitchen: for instance, we threw in basil, not green onions, had no dates, substituted walnuts and it was still phenomenal because the basis was so solid! (and next time it will probably be different as well!)

Delicious! I had to sub celery for the red pepper, but it tastes great. Will definitely make this when we have soy-eating vegetarians come to visit.

This recipe was delicious, I'd been looking for something just like this.  Upon advice of others I added a 1/2 cup cilantro, doubled the curry powder, and doubled the green onion.   It was delicious, and tasted better the second day.  Thanks so much for this recipe Candice!

So good and healthy!  So many flavors going on.  Like one reviewer says, you can add in just about anything - I added some baby radish that I had to use up, which ended up being a good counterpoint to the sweet floured dates I used.  I also actually grilled my tofu in my stir fry grilling pan, and I think it came out similar to baking.  Next time, I'd like to try marinating the tofu in the sauce first for extra flavor.

My first experience using tofu and I bought firm not extra firm. However, it still works well and since I didn't have dates I used white raisins. I would make this again.

This is delicious. I did do some motifications; I exchanged cashews for the peanuts, and I did not have tofu on hand so I used chicken, and I added celery and left out the dates because I did not have any on hand. It turned out wonderfully and will now be a staple in our routine.

This dish was AMAZING I used greek yogurt instead of mayo and it still turned out wonderful I used it in lunches for the week and it tastes even better the next day. The cooking suggestions for the tofu turned out really well too I usually have a hard time getting a good texture. LOVES it!

I omitted the dates, as I don't like sweet/savory main dishes (made it a main dish). The result was good. I think it would be even better with a peanut sauce instead of curry sauce. Will try that next time.

This is absolutely fabulous.  One of my favorite recipes off of this site.  I sometimes use dried cranberries in place of dates and double the sauce (it's so good) but otherwise follow recipe exactly. Probably be good with leftover chicken too.

This is absolutely delicious. Used raisins because I didn't have dates and seasoned rice vinegar instead of white vinegar. Tasted great and will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

The ingredients seemed like an odd combination but the favors work very well together. I've made it twice in a week because I enjoyed it so much. The only changes I made were to use a gluten free soy sauce, and a dairy free mayo.

I will definitely make this again! I like my tofu somewhat tough, so I baked it about 40 minutes, turning halfway through, and then lightly fried it on the stove until both sides were brown.   I also followed someone else's advice n added about 3 stalks of chopped celery.  This was a good addition for 2 reasons; it added another vegetable and offset the spice. I used my ghost pepper curry powder, and doubled the red pepper flakes, so this was a super spicy salad. The sweet dates helped offset the spice as well. I absolutely loved this!!

I thought the salad was very good in a wrap.  I didn't have lemon juice but it tasted fine without it.  I also used a vegan mayo substitute rather than the real thing.

I am not sure I have words for how amazing this dish is.  My biggest piece of advice I can give you is that you should double or triple it.  You will be glad you did.  The recipe says it makes 6 servings.  For who?  An anorexic supermodel prior to a shoot?  I made this and it was gone in one sitting between my wife and me.  The flavor profiles are incredible and it is amazingly satisfying.  I have been on a vegetarian type diet for a while and this was just pure heaven.

Fantastic recipe.  I made the following substitutions and additions for a vegan dish with great success: lime juice instead of lemon, 1 tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter instead of peanuts, Red cayenne pepper (not flakes), Bragg's liquid amino's instead of soy, vegan mayo, chopped cilantro, black soybean organic tofu.  The dish has the perfect amount of flavor, spice, not boring. I will make this for friends.

It tastes just like the curried tofu salad at Gelson's.  I substituted Veganaise to make it vegan.  I also substituted pecans because that's what I had on hand.  Delish!

This recipe is so yummy. I omitted the dates and used grapes left out the carrots (not a fan weird I know) used braggs instead of soy sauce but kept everything else the same. Ate on a garlic herb wrap. Will make again.

I made the sauce exactly as written. I didn't have any of the other ingredients except the carrots & tofu. I was just trying to figure out how to cook my tofu & get rid of some carrots, instead of cooking tofu the way I always do. The sauce was really good over the baked tofu & shredded carrots. I'll have to add other ingredients next time I make this. I baked the tofu 10 minutes longer to make it a bit crunchy.

This is a wonderful recipe. I've been searching for something like this for a long time. I use just a little less than 1 tablespoon of vinegar, and use plump raisins in place of the dates. YUM!

excellent recipe. I made it for a pot luck at work and received rave reviews. I even had to print the recipe out for several others. Definitely better the next day.

The "kick" seemed just about right to me. The heat is nicely offset by the mildness of the tofu, itself. The heat and sweet was also nice. I served this in small sauce dishes as a side with Holiday Chicken Salad from this site. DH, not fond of tofu, was not impressed, understandably; it's a texture thing.
