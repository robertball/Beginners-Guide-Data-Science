Hmmmm, this is different. I ended up adding more spices. I think that this one might have to grow on us.

I tried this one last week, not on a smoker but a Traeger wood pellet grill. I used some cheap Safeway brand lemon-lime pop. I could've smoked it on the grill, but chose to cook it like I always do whole chickens on the Traeger....45 minutes on High, 45 minutes on Smoke, but added 10 more minutes or so on the Smoke setting. One of the best chickens I've ever cooked, but you gotta like the citrus flavor. I imagine the flavor on mine was more subtle than if I'd smoked it for 10 hours like the author did. Very fine recipe, and very easy.

I do have a smoker so this worked out extremely well. This isn't for grilling but for slow smoking as was stated and was great. No citrus flavor problem for us when smoking.

This worked well for us. Didn't have any problems with too much of a citrus flavor. Hubby used this recipe for both salmon and chicken. YUM and thanks "What's his Face"!

There is only two of us so I decided to use two cornish game hens instead of a whole chicken. I was afraid the lemon lime soda was going to make these sweet but that was not at all the case. What the soda did was make those little birds tender like no other. I have never had such tender meat come out of a smoker before. I am guilty of rubbing some seasoning on the outside of the birds for  flavor because I feel that is necessary but the seasoning played no part to the tenderness. That would be the lemon lime soda. Very impressive!

10 hours to smoke is way to long. Ended up with dry birds. The tastes was good will try again but not cook as long as was suggested and yes it was cooked low and slow.  I kept an eye on the smoker heat.
