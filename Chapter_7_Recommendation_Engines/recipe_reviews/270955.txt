It came out really good. I used Lima beans, soaked them about for 18 hours, and simmered for 30 min, then the beans were tender. I only added 1 and 1/2 cup of water in the tomato sauce mix. Baked it in a 9x13 in. baking dish. I ate it with a flatbread, and it was so delicious.

I really enjoyed this—and have been eating the leftovers for lunches this week. It took much longer for the sauce to reduce and for the onions to soften; I kept adding 15 minutes to the baking time. I believe I baked this at least 2 hours, maybe a bit longer. I didn’t care for the feta on top the first night I made it; somehow, it seemed to clash with the tomato sauce for me. But I love the dill and the other flavors. I even had it on top of leftover spaghetti aglio e olio, and it was terrific! Tomorrow I’m adding feta to my leftovers.

Hello Dear. Just finished making these. Couldn't help adding molasses and Worcestershire sauce. I'm just a Southern girl. I tried to be Greek, but somehow pinto beans jumped into the dish, to. You can take the girl out of the country, but can't get uncountryfied.. I'll try harder next time.

Used large limas and 3 tsp dried dill (couldn't get fresh).  It was great -husband and son liked it too!  Will use 2 tsp dried dill next time I make it, and will definitely use fresh when I can.  Thanks!

Aside from my problem with getting the beans properly cooked (which finally did happen), the texture of the dish was great.  We did feel that the vinegar flavor dominated and that was perhaps the brand I used.  I guess my family still likes a Tex-Mex style baked bean best.
