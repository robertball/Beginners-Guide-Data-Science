I'm kind of a newbie when it comes to deviled eggs - never made them until recently and don't recall ever eating them either.  But in recent months I've tried a few different recipes and as I do it seems each is better than the next. I liked this one better than others I've tried.  I like the "interest" factor in them, with the different tastes, colors and textures of the cheese, chives, egg white and bacon.  Hubs, however, was not as enamored with them. For the same reason I liked them, he didn't - he said a deviled egg should be creamy and not have crunchy stuff in it.  I'm sure he'd rate these only average, three stars.  Oh, and piping these with a large open star decorator tip works perfectly.

I'm not a fan of deviled eggs but I had a cookout to go to and a bunch of eggs to use up. Everyone loved them even myself!! The bacon and cheese made them taste like a mini breakfast. Next time I won't cut up the 4 white halves because there was too much mix.

Tasted ok, the dijon mustard was not my favorite part.  FYI, you can not pipe these with a star tip.

Pretty yummy.  Loved the extra tips also.  Wish I would have seen this last weekend, when I fixed the worst peeling eggs of my life.  After a search, I came to the same conclusion of using older eggs.  So these eggs worked up sooooo much nicer.  The taste was good too.  I fixed them for tomorrow so I may have to update after our trail ride potluck supper.

I am not an egg fan - but I made these for my summer barbecue this year and they were gone in a flash!  The bacon and cheddar adds just the right about of kick to the flavor.  I did not add the extra egg whites to the mixture -- it was great without it.  Best deviled egg recipe I've ever tasted!

I made these and really struggled with the eggs.  Once my mom taught me to put the eggs into ice cold water, the shells came off super easy!  I have to saw the filling was easy to make and actually fun to dispense from a plastic sandwich bag with no messy container to clean!  YEAH!  I give this recipe two thumbs up!  YUMMY!

These are quick to disappear, so make sure you get one right away!  They were a huge hit at the party we took them to, we made 3 or 4 dozen and they were gone almost instantly!  Thank you for a great recipe!

It was a split decision.  Most everyone said these were great, hubby said they were just okay.  Since he's the most important, I have to drop it one star. Followed recipe to a "T".

Don't go crazy with the bacon even if your a big fan (who isn't ?) I added an extra bit of bacon bits and for me they became a bit too salty.  But EVERYONE else really enjoyed them.

These were AWESOME and easy to make.  My 8 yr old son even helped me.  They were gone as quick as I put them out.  Enjoyed by young and old.

Normally my family devours deviled eggs, but not these.  They said they were too sour, which I am attributing to the sour cream and the lemon juice in the recipe.  They did like the addition of the cheese and the bacon, but I won't be making this one again.

I tried this recipe and Deviled Eggs by Margaret Sanders on this site.  Both were good but this one was the bigger hit with my family probably because of the bacon.  Everything is always better with bacon.  I used Hormel Real Crumbled Bacon purchased in a bag for this recipe.  I have no choice but to make this one again.
