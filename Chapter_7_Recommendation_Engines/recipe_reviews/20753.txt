Very well received punch I made for a Baby Shower!   I froze two zip lock bags with mix the night before as suggested by another reviewer. Froze bags on side so blocks were long, wide and thinner as opposed to a thick block. Took mix out 2 hours before shower and it turned into a perfect slush/sludge.  Added 3 liters (not 2) of Gigerale and Rasberry Soda and mixed to right consistency.  Couldn't find Rasberry Gingerale, but Walmarts had Gingerale and Rasberry soda (mixed about 1/4-1/3 Rasberry to Gingerale). I made a Cranberry-Rasberry ice ring.  Colors were beautiful, mix was delicous! Thanks for this recipe.

Great punch.  Beautiful raspberry-pink color.  You MUST remove it from the freezer at least 1 and 1/2 hrs. before serving.  I removed it from the freezer one hour prior to the event and then added the ginger ale at event time.  All I had was a frozen block floating in the ginger ale - certainly couldn't serve my guests that!!!  As guests arrived, I was hurredly scraping the frozen block trying to speed it along and, needless to say, this didn't make for a very pleasant situation when I had guests to attend to.  Also, add 3 liters of ginger ale instead of 2.  It was rather thick.  Guests seemed to enjoy it, and it disappeared fast.

This punch was awesome! I don't like Pina Colada though, so I used Strawberry Daquiri mix instead. My husband LOVES it. The kids loved it. And it's really easy to spike. Just add rum!

This pucnch is truly great.  I should have doubled the receipe because everyone at my party loved it and it was gone.  If you can't find raspberry ginger ale just use Cherry 7-Up it was fabulous!

This was so good.  I was a bit afraid after some of the reviewers said that there was too much of a coconut taste....but it was gone and everyone wanted the recipe.  Thanks so much for posting.

This punch was simple to make.. and it tasted great!! I was afraid the pina coloda mix would be over-powering as some reviews said it would be, but it really wasn't.  I did freeze in ziploc bags..and I took it out 1.5 hours before the guests arrived and it still took longer than that to melt into slush.. I will definately make again though!!! I had a lot of good comments on it!

I've made this many times and it's always a hit... I freeze it in extra-large Ziploc bags instead of a container since I found it impossible to thaw in time. Definitely needs much longer than indicated to thaw. Excellent flavour!

This is a great tasting, easy punch recipe.  I've made it several times for work and always receive requests for the recipe.  I believe the juice container is 64 oz though instead of 46 -- and I haven't been able to find raspberry ginger ale so I use two 2-liter bottles of cranberry ginger ale instead.

Great recipe.  This is a punch people drink because they like it, not because they are being polite.  The pina colada taste is not overwhelming at all.  Freezing the mixture in Ziploc bags works well, as does "thinning" the punch with an extra bottle of raspberry gingerale if it is more popular than expected.

I made this for a wedding reception and it was the first thing gone!! I used 1/3 a 2liter bottle of raspberry soda with regular gingerale for every batch and it was wonderful!!  I broke it up with a knife before adding the ginger ale and it was the right slushy texture.

I served this at a baby shower for 20 women. Two hours later, it was gone....everyone loved it and people were asking me how to make it. I couldn't find raspberry gingerale, but I used 1/2 bottle strawberry soda and a bottle of lemon lime soda.

I made this for a baby shower.  Although it was very quick and easy to make, the pina colada mix really overpowered it .  It had too much of a coconut, syrupy-sweet taste for our liking.  We kept adding more ginger-ale to try and tone it down.  :-)  I would definitely make it again, just reduce the amount of pina colada mix by at least half.  I subbed regular ginger ale for the raspberry and that was just fine.

I just made this last weekend (8/4/01) for my daughter's wedding reception.  It was so easy to put together, I mixed the pina colada mix and the cranberry juice together and then poured back into their original containers to freeze.  It was easy to transport and assemble at the reception.  It was a real hit, there wasn't a drop left! I would recommend this and will use it again.

This was a really great recipe.  I halved it and used it for a baby shower.  It was a beautiful pink color, and everyone loved it.  I couldn't find any flavored ginger ale, so I used raspberry soda.  In any case, it was a great punch.  Thanks, Mary!

I served this punch for a baby shower, and people were swarming around the punch bowl all afternoon!  It was definitely a hit.  A wonderful change from your typical punch.

I made this for my sister's wedding shower, and everyone loved it (except my mom...go figure). The pina colada mixer really makes it. I couldn't find rasberry ginger ale, so I used one bottle of cranberry ginger ale and one bottle of regular. I won't chill the ginger ale next time...the frozen part stayed frozen for a long time, and I had let it sit out an hour before I added the ginger ale.

I made this recipe for my daughter's 3rd birthday party...it was a ballerina party so the pink color was perfect! I was a little nervous about the pina colado mix...but the end result was awesome. Everyone loved it, including my mom who wasn't so sure about the ingredients for a kid's party. Awesome...and will definitely make again. (We're thinking for an adult party to add some Malibu Rum)! Really good!

I made this punch for a baby shower 3/15/03 and it was wonderful! I could not find the raspberry gingerale so just used gingerale and it was fine.  I took another reviewers suggestion and froze the mixture in a bunt pan and that worked out just great.  I also used another suggestion and froze some of the mixture in the plastic cranberry juice bottle and would not do that again.  It was way to hard to get out of the bottle--we had to get a sharp knife and cut the top part of the bottle off. The color of the punch was a perfect raspberry pink and the flavor was just right. I took the frozen mixture out of the freezer 2 hrs. before serving and it was a perfect slushy drink. Everyone loved it.  I will definetly be using this recipe again!

Awesome is the only way to describe this punch!!  I made this last night for a
large group.  It was the hit of the party.  Everyone devoured it.  Definitely agree 
with previous reviews that the pina colada mixture must be taken out of the 
freezer at least 2 hours before serving in order to break it up into slush.

This punch was a huge hit at our neighborhood Christmas baking exchange party. I cheated and added 13 oz. of vodka, which didn't seem to alter the flavor.  At first glance, it looked like a big bowl of pink fluff!

I found this punch a little sweet, but the flavour is very good.  I've made it for a couple of showers, and the punch bowl always empties.

Great punch recipe!  I substituted regular gingerale for the raspberry gingerale because they don't sell it at any of the stores where I live.  The punch was a great success and I didn't have ANY leftovers and I got a TON of great commnets on it!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This punch was very good! I served it at a company birthday party. I got a lot of compliments on it and not one complaint. And people did ask for the recipe. It's like a slushy, which was a pleasant surprise. You do need to bring out the frozen mixture at least 1 1/2 hours before hand. I couldn't find raspberry ginger ale so I substituted 2-2liters of regular ginger ale and a quarter of a 2liter bottle of strawberry soda. I kept the frozen mixture the same measurements and it tasted fine. We just added more ginger ale if the taste was too strong. And we did taste it before the guests got a chance to! I plan to serve it again at a luau this summer! Also, it could be spiked with rum if you wanted.

I made this punch for a bridal shower I hosted at my home.  I froze the mix in a non-stick bundt cake pan; that worked great.  I found that I could use almost 3 2-Liter bottles of the raspberry gingerale, not just one.  I did find the raspberry gingerale at WalMart (made by Seagrams).
I thought the taste was pretty good.  Not everyone liked it, but most did.

We used this punch recipe for our New Years' Party and we really enjoyed it.  I also thought that it would be a perfect punch for Valentine's Day because of its pretty pink color. We can't wait to make this recipe again.  Thank you.

My office LOVED! this recipe and it was just as simple and easy as it was rated to be.  One tip, your ginger ale just needs to be a little bit cool.  Makes a beautiful pink tropical refresher.

I made this for a "girls' day out" brunch at my house. Was a tremendous hit! Unique and fabulous... and added to the fun. I too had a problem with it staying frozen too long, so right or wrong I put it in the microwave to help it along a bit.

This was a big hit at a bridal shower.  Got lots of compliments.  It is very different than your usual party punch, but it is really good.  Make sure to take the frozen mixture out of the freezer at least 1 1/2 hours before.

Made this for my daughter's ballerina birthday party and no one drank it. :o( The Pina Colada was too strong and disagreed with many people. It is a wonderful pink color, though, which was why I tried it. And the slushy texture was a treat. I stored the frozen mixture in freezer baggies overnight and they didn't freeze solid, so they only needed to be removed 1 hour before hand. I might try it again in the future, but cut back on the Pina Colada mix a LOT and add some raspberry pop along with the raspberry ginger ale.

I made this for my daughter's 2nd birthday party.  It made such a HUGE amount of punch, that I (jokingly) banned anyone from drinking any soda or tea until the punch was gone!  Well, that was NO problem, because it was so good that the punch was gone within a few hours and the other drinks remained untouched.  My husband hates pina coloda, but he loved this punch as much as everyone else.  I can't say enough about this recipe!

As per other reviews, I cut back a bit on the pina colada mix and also used raspberry soda with the raspberry ginger ale. Took the slush out 1.5 hrs prior to serving. Thanks Mary Lynn.

This recipe sounded so good, but it tasted like crayons (a taste a lot of us remember from childhood!)  I was so disappointed, I made it for my daughter's baby shower.  Although, we all got a good laugh out of it so I guess it wasn't a total loss!

I served this at an Open House for a Lodge with about 60 people and the men went crazy! They all had bets it was spiked!!! Of course it was not but they all thought it was~ We ran short of gingerale and used Sierra Mist for the bubbly and that gave a nice flavor as well. Many of the gals wanted the recipe. Thanks for being the "HIT" of the party! :)

I served this today at a baby shower and everyone loved it!In fact, they all want the recipe.I was unable to find the raspberry ginger-ale so I used cranberry ginger-ale.The staff here advised that any clear colored soda could be used as a subsitute.Make sure you leave it in the freezer long enough for the slushiness. This can easily be converted to an alocholic punch.It's easy and good...try it.

We served this punch at a luncheon last week.  Everyone raved about how tasty it was and they certainly backed that up by finishing off all the batches of this punch, even before they finished off the brownies and the cookies!   My advice--make more than you think you'll need because THEY WILL LOVE IT!

I served this punch at a church new year's eve gathering. Of the over 200 people attending this was a great conversation piece. On going raves. They kept asking what's the unique flavor I taste. The Pina-Colada makes this recipe one that will continue to come back to the table again and again. Chris McMillan 1-1-01

What a terrific recipe!  My 6 year old loved it and enjoyed passing it out to everyone.  This is much, much easier than my other slushy punch recipe!  I halved it for a party (ex. 25 servings), and six people finished it off.  Thanks!

Thank goodness I found this one! I served it with the appetizers for forty people at a church 'progressive' dinner. The topic of conversation finally shifted from election results to, "Where did you find this recipe!" 
Thank you very much.

I made this punch EXACTLY as called for on Sunday for a baby shower.  We had a small amount of people, but the punch went really fast!  Everyone absolutely LOVED it.  The middle was still kind of icy, (it took at least 2 hours to defrost), so we just added another bottle of raspberry ginger ale.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

The only thing that tops the way it looks in the punch bowl is the way it taste.  Served at a baby shower and the pink color and taste were a hit.  Making at Christmas as well it was so wonderful.

After reading all the reviews I decided to make this punch for a baby shower.  I did not heed the advice to make more than needed and I ran out one hour into the shower.  I gave out the recipe several times and it was a big hit!

I made this punch for my sister's bridal shower.  Everyone loved it!  I couldn't find raspberry ginger ale soda, so I used the regular ginger ale.  It was still good!  Nothing was left behind.

Easiest punch I ever made. It was for my daughter's shower for 16 people.  I made a batch for 50 and every drop went.  It was delicious and a big hit. I would suggest taking it out of the freezer prior to 30 minutes before serving.  At least 1 hour.

I made this for my best friend's wedding reception and it was a huge hit.  I substituted a bottle of cranberry ginger-ale for one of the bottles of raspberry ginger-ale.  I personally didn't care for the coconut flavoring of the pina colada mix, but everyone else seemed to love it.  They also loved the slush.  Also, the color wasn't as pretty a pink as, say, raspberry sherbet.  It seemed more like a muddy pink to me.  But I'll definitely use this recipe again!

Great recipe!  I made it for my husband's birthday party.  After the first person got his second glass the games stopped and their was a line around the punch bowl.  I added an extra 2L of gingerale.  I used regular, but will try raspberry next time and maybe another liter.

Fantastic. I froze the punch in several freezer bags and then was able to "squish" the bags to make it into "slush" before putting in the soda. Very easy and little to no waiting. Used it for a party and everyone LOVED it. Will use this again and again.

Yummmmmm!  This punch was delicious!  What a great taste!  I think next time I"ll get it out about an hour before serving - it was pretty slushy.  Think it needed to be more liquid - just my preference....thanks for sharing!

I would not make this punch again. It is a bit too tart for my taste; I prefer a sweeter punch.  I made it as directed--would advise that those wanting to make it allow more than half an hour for defrosting. It presents well and is a pretty pink color, but the flavor is not one I cared for. However, I did receive many rave reviews from my guests--if a tart punch is what you seek, this might be a good recipe for you.

This should be called "dessert punch"...it was far too sweet for my taste.  The flavors were nice, perhaps a mix of ginger beer and club soda would help instead of all ginger ale?

I personally don't like raspberry anything, but I made this for a baby shower because it could be made ahead of time, didn't require extra ice or a ring, and was pink in keeping of the shower's theme.  It was a HUGE hit.  So much a hit that I was requested to make the same punch for the christening reception.  I made double the recipe and had almost nothing left over with nearly 30 people there at each event.  Two quibbles - I can't find raspberry ginger ale anywhere nor was it on any grocery's available list.  I used raspberry seltzer and it worked fine.  Also, the frozen punch base needs to come out of the freezer much earlier than 30 minutes.  The second time I took it out an hour early and it still had to be broken up.

Unique recipe.  Pina colada was a little strong.  Not bad however.  I put the mixture in a couple of gallon size storage bags in the freezer about 4 hours before I needed them and it was slushy as I wanted it without having to wait for it to thaw.

I made this punch on the weekend for a baby shower&,although I liked it,it was deffinately not a crowd pleaser like I had hoped based on all the great reviews.I think coconut is just one of those flavors people really like or hate,next time I will try it with a different drink mix or with sorbet.

I figured I better rate this punch since I've made it so many times, always to rave reviews.  I freeze the pina colada mixture in zip bags & let sit for about an hour before adding the rasp.g/ale.  Yum-punch!!

Served this for a bridal shower and EVERYONE raved about it. It was so easy and I served it in a drink dispenser b/c the party was outside on a very hot evening. It was great! I made NO changes.

Made this the first time over 5 years ago.  I've made it for several parties and showers that I know it by heart.  The BEST punch ever!!  (Add a little Raspberry Rum for adult version.)

YUMMY!  I was a little unsure of using this for my daughter-in-law's baby shower, but I needed a true pink punch and the color of this punch is perfect!  The flavor is not your typical shower punch...but boy (or should I say GIRL), it was a hit!!  Everybody loved the flavor and commented about how different and unexpected it was.  Got rave reviews! Even had several ask for the recipe.

I am kind of on the fence on this one. Those who liked it really liked it, others not so much. It was a little tart for me. The color was beautiful, just not what I want when I have punch. I love love love punch but looking for something a little sweeter for my taste.

Our church doesn't allow red punch so I substituted Pineapple/Orange/Banana Juice and regular ginger ale.  I ALWAYS get rave reviews with this version of the punch.  Sooo much so I'm using it for my daughter's wedding!

I tried this punch Sunday at my Church's 100 year celebration and served it for 100 people and  everyone loved it.  People asked how I got the recipe and several people wanted the recipe.  I would give this more stars if offered but there is only 5 stars.  Was not able to find the raspberry ginger ale but instead used Jello Brand raspberry and it turned out excellent.  You might want to skim off the foam from the jello but that didn't change my mind at all.  The red color was perfect since our interior of the church is red.  I will definitely be making this very soon.  The recipe is a keeper.

I made this recipe for a recent baby shower.  It was fantastic.  Everyone loved it and asked what was in it.  Just for fun, I used an inflatable duck baby bath tub for the punch bowl and floated a 3 small duckies in it.  I, too, couldn't find the raspberry ginger ale and I used the regular and it was great!  I would mix it an hour before because it was slow to start thawing, probably because of the insulation from the tub. Fantastic, I will make this again.

I made this for my Mom's 90th birthday party. I made it to the exact recipe except that I added pomegranate seeds to the mixture as it was freezing, and they added a nice little touch.  The guests all gave it high reviews and I was asked over and over for the recipe.     The punch was still delicious when I had to start "watering" it down with more ginger ale & then lemon-lime drink to make it go further! 
  I found the raspberry ginger ale at Walmart in a 12 pack of cans, and just added 6 cans to each tub of slush.  It did take at least 1 1/2 hours to get the frozen mixture slushy.

Made this with normal ginger ale because we couldn't find the flavored and it still was a great hit! People had the choice of adding champagne, vodka, or rum as they wanted to their glass.

Thanks for this recipe, it sounds amazing and I plan to make it for my sisters baby shower.  Quick question, the pina colada mix contains alcohol, right? Can I substitute the mix for Bacardi Mixers pina colada non-alcoholic frozen concentrate?  Please let me know!!! The shower is next week.

Made this punch to exact recipe, FANTASTIC. Will definitely make this again. 
NOTE: if you are planning to use a beverage dispenser with a spigot, the frozen part doesn't mix as readily as for the typical punchbowl. You will end up with a big chunk of frozen cranberry/pina colada and may have to add another ginger ale bottle. It is still wonderful, however!

Made this with a cosmopolitan mix instead of pina colada - and it was great!  Had to make 2 batches for a baby shower and both disappeared before the party was over.  It's definitely a sweet drink, but the pink color looked pretty in the punch bowl.  We made a fancy ice ring with some sliced up limes and raspberries to accent it as well.  Very easy and cheap to put together for a crowd.

Super easy, super yummy!  A hit a bridal shower at work.  Used 1 1/2 64 oz bottles of juice and since I couldn't find the raspberry ginger ale, cherry 7-up.  Good idea to mix and freeze closer to when you need it so that you have slush and not a solid block of juice and mix.

This punch was great! It was really easy to make and was a beautiful pink. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. I didn't not have trouble with it taking too long to thaw, it actually could have stayed more like a slush longer and been perfect! I will use again.

This punch is awesome!!! We made it for my baby shower since it was a beautiful pink color and I love pina coladas. We also added a few fresh raspberrys for decoration. Will definitely make this again! Also makes a great base for a tropical alcoholic beverage.

I made this punch for a baby shower & it was AWESOME!!! I did have to make a small change & that was substituting the lemon juice for lime juice because I was out of lemon. Either way it was superb & EVERYONE wanted the recipe, even my mom & she is not a punch/kool-aid sort of fan.

When we get together with a group of families, I am always requested to bring this.  I substitute 1 bottle of diet sprite for one of the bottles of gingerale, as it is so very sweet.

I LOVE this punch.  I'm not normally a punch person, but I've made this on several occasions.  You can add rum or vodka to make it an adult drink, but kids love it too, without the alcohol, of course.

I tried this punch as a fluke at my baby shower and I must say, it's the best I've ever tasted.  Such a unique flavor!  Some guests asked if there was alcohol in it.  I guess the mixture of pina colada and bubbly ginger ale gives it a fizzy taste.  Will use this recipe again and again.

This punch was a perfect fit for a baby shower that I threw.  The punch is slushy w/ a touch of tartness and the perfect amount of sweetness.  I didn't have raspberry ginger ale, so I added some raspberry syrup to the punch.  Everyone loved the punch, and they wanted the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

I loved this punch!Different from the traditional sherbert punch.  Just made it last night for a party, a person that doesn't like coconut, loved it. Will be making for a friend's baby shower. Add some rum to make it more adult orientated also-YUMMY!

I made this punch for a social function and now I'm not allowed to bring anything else but this! I couldn't find flavored ginger ale so I used regular and it turned out okay. I also used 2 cans of frozen pina colada mix, and I used the tip about placing the frozen mixture in ziploc bags. It makes it much easier to transport when you have to take it to someone's home. Thanks again for posting this!

This is a wonderful recipe that I made for a bridal shower a few years ago and it is still talked about and requested from friends. It is fast and easy, always a hit, and always requested when I make it. You can put the pina colada and cran-rasberry mixture in a shapped mold with whole raspberries freeze as directed and then float it in your punch bowl with additional berries. You can also add  mint leaves for garnish if desired. It is both beautiful and great tasting.

I thought it was a bit too sweet. Since I couldn't find raspberry gingerale, I used plain gingerale. I used more than called for to lessen sweetness. Next time I think I'll try either raspberry seltzer.

I found this punch to be a bit on the tart side.  I knew that with the cran-raspberry juice that it would be, but I thought that the other ingredients would balance it all out.  I served it at a bridal shower and everyone else seemed to like it, however I didn't care for it much....too tart.

I preparded this punch for my book club gathering and it was a hit.  I ran out and everyone wanted the recipe and kept coming back for more punch. I bet it would have tasted better with the raspberry ginger ale, but I could not find that anywhere.  I did not have a problem thawing out the mixture...30 minutes was just about right.  However, I do highly recommend putting mixture in two different containers. Thanks...Toni

Very easy.  Pina colada mix gave it a unique twist.  Took advice from other reviewers: -1- Used an extra gingerale.  Plain gingerale will work fine.  -2- Froze in 2 freezer baggies.  -3- If the slush is hard as a rock, give it a few hours to thaw.  This makes a lot of punch- more than 2 punchbowls.

Very good, pulled it out of the freezer 2 hours before, but could have used a little more time thawing.  I think next time I will freeze it in quart bags as previously suggested.

I loved it. Made it for a 50th birthday celebration with a Hawaiian theme. I took it out of the freezer early and beat the frozen thing until it was slushy because some reviews said it didn't melt. Then I added the soda. The girls loved it, but most of the guys, young and old, didn't care much for it. I'll definitely make this again, only I'll have a pitcher of plain water for the guys ;)

Terrific punch, easy to make.  I highly recommend using the Schwepps Raspeberry Gingerale because it makes it so beautiful!  I had no problems with thawing or freezing.  There is a mellow pina colada taste to it, but my guests loved it, especially the "slushy" part...only drawback: extras do not keep well at all.

This punch is delicious! I used two 2ltr bottles of ginger ale and one 2ltr bottle of strawberry soda since I couldn’t find raspberry soda at all. I made a frozen ring using fresh raspberries that I froze and put in the bottom of the mold. I scooped softened (it should be like a thick liquid) raspberry sherbet over the raspberries and froze it. Then I poured the cold juice and coconut mix over to fill. It kept the punch cold and really dressed it up. You definitely want to remove your slush from the freezer 1 to 1-1/2 hours before adding to the soda.

I made this for my daughter-in-law's baby shower last year and kept a bottle of raspberry vodka on the side.Put large plastic ziplock bags into empty coffee containers and then pour in punch. It's easy to freeze and transport that way.  Making it again for Baby Miranda's 1 st birthday. Everyone loved it.

Super delicious and easy to make.  It's yummy as-is, but I think it's even better spiked with Malibu Rum.  I also couldn't find Raspberry ginger ale so I've used Cherry 7up and Cranberry Sierra Mist.

This was awesome! I made it for my daughter's 10th birthday party and everyone loved it. I only  used 1 bottle of Pina colada mix with one bottle of cran-raspberry juice and had to use 3 liters of raspberry  ginger ale (which I could only find at our local neighborhood mkt). I split the mix into two 1 gallon bags to freeze the night before. I took them out two hours prior to thaw. I think 2 1/2 would have been better. But it turned out great! I'm making it again for thanksgiving dinner this week!

This is a great recipe. Our store didn't carry the raspberry ginger ale, but it was still great with the regular. We also did an adult punch and added a bottle of Rum, and it was a BIG hit!

Made this a couple of years ago for a shower. Basically wanted a pink punch. I used regular ginger ale and I may have floated a combination of raspberry sherbet and vanilla ice cream in it. I just kept adding stuff until I ran out of punch. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.

I've made this every year for our little Halloween office party, despite the fact that it isn't really Halloweeny.  I just wanted a punch that tastes great, and this fits the bill.  It's always a hit, even with the black spiders floating around in it.

I have made this for 2 showers already.  It is a little different than your regular ginger ale and sherbert.

Couldn't find the flavored ginger ale so used regular.  Turned out very, very good -- everyone at the shower is still ravings about it.  I'm sure it would be even better with the raspberry ginger ale!

Unfortunately not too many people at my party liked this at all.  I wound up throwing most of it out (and it makes A LOT!).  I have a sweet tooth that won't quick, but even this was too much for me.  Sorry, I tried.

I chose this one for my baby's birthday since it was pink.  Froze it in ziploc bags like a reviewer suggested, and it turned out great! Very slushy and addicting. Got lots of requests for the recipe, so I told them where to find it.

AWESOME punch!! It's a big hit whenever I make it. I actually get requests for the punch for different functions. I agree with the other reviews, you MUST start defrosting it at least 1 to 1 1/2 hours prior to the time it will be served. It's still cold, so you won't have to worry about ice.

This is AWESOME!!!  I've made this many times and even changed the juice flavor to make the punch a different color!  It's also good with a lemon lime soda or regular ginger ale.
Thank you for a wonderful punch!

This punch was very tasty.  I substituted a 2-liter of raspberry soda and a 2-liter of regular gingerale because I could not find raspberry gingerale. I served it at a baptism reception and a couple of people asked for the recipe.  I had blocks of the mixture insead of slush because it just didn't thaw in time even though I put it in the frig the morning of the evening reception.  It was so easy and so good that I would definitely make it again.

I made this punch for my dd's grad party.  It is so easy to keep refilling the punch bowl since it is already mixed.  I used regular ginger ale since I couldn't find rasp ale.  I used 2 bottles of cran-rasp juice.  Easy with great flavor!

Tastes really good and has a nice pink color...although I would allow more than 30min. to defrost the mixture (more like 1hr.).

I wasn't a big fan of this punch.  I didn't think it had much "punch" to it.  It was somewhat sour and didn't have much fizz (maybe it was the brand of juice and soda that I used).  I would probably add some sugar to the recipe.

Strange punch!  I made it for a family reunion, and it was GONE IN 10 MINUTES!!!  My own family didn't care for it, and I thought it was ok, but everyone else raved, and wants the recipe. Didn't have raspberry ginger ale, so I used plain, and I used 3- 2liter bottles because we were running out sooo fast.  I'll make it again, I just wish I could figure out why some love it, when I didn't.

I made this for a baby shower, and it was a BIG hit.  I had several people ask for the recipe.  It's SO good and so easy.  I also froze the slush in gallon ziplock bags, but I would take it out earlier than an hour ahead because I had trouble with it not slushing fast enough.  FANTASTIC!

Wonderfully delicious!!  This recipe was nice & different from all the citrus punch recipes.  I will definately make this again.  I could only find regular gingerale & it was still wonderful.  I took the advise of others & froze my base in QUART ZIP-TOP BAGS.  Take out of freezer ONE HOUR BEFORE SERVING.  Super easy & super affordable.

Overall, this was a pretty good punch. Those who don't like pina colada didn't care for it (and because it was so pink, they had no idea it was in there until they tasted it). The kids (up to age 19) really liked it!! It was quite sweet, but pretty good. This made two large punch bowls full. I ended up sending the second punch bowl (before it was even assembled) home with my sister, for her kids who really liked it.

I know I am in the minority here, but this punch was awful!  I made it today for my preschoolers Valentine's Day party.  Only one little girl liked it, the rest of the kids chose water over the punch after trying it!  I asked some of the mothers what they thought of it and most said it was okay, but nothing they would want to drink again.  The only change I made to the recipe was I used 3/4 bottle of pina colada mix instead of the whole bottle.
