Wonderful! My 5 and 3 year olds loved this, as well. We used 2 whole eggs instead of only whites, and added a bit more banana and cinnamon. We sprinkled a tiny bit of cinnamon-sugar on top and it was great! Thanks!

I am one of these cooks who really believes that any slight change in a recipe can have huge consequences.  I just made a batch of these muffins, and my wife and 13 month old son ate half a dozen before they were cool. 

A couple things that I did differently:
I sifted the flour with the dry ingredients - though I still used the larger grains of the flour. 
I used margarine instead of butter.
I used large eggs and ended up with about 1/2 a cup of egg white from four eggs.
I used two bananas that were so ripe they were black (never frozen though).  Incidentally, two large bananas were exactly 1.5 cups mashed.
I very precisely measured all ingredients, though the blueberries were probably a bit more than one cup.  These were fresh, not frozen.
The biggest change was that after putting in a spoonful of batter, I put in a teaspoon of blueberry jam.  Then I filled the rest of the muffin cup up to about 80% full.  
I baked these muffins on the top rack for  20 minutes.
They did not rise a lot, but they did rise more than the picture that is posted  with the original recipe.  
It made one dozen fantastic, moist, and delicious muffins.
This is a recipe that I'll use again and again...
Oh, one more thing.  I let the batter sit for about 20 minutes before I put it in the oven... This was by accident though cause I couldn't find the muffin pans!

So easy - so tasty!  I wanted a healthy alternative to cake, so I made these for my one year old to take to day care to celebrate her birthday.  I did tweak the recipe some-- (I doubled the recipe) I added a couple egg yoks, a little extra vanila and a whole lot of blueberries.  Then I baked them in mini-muffin pans instead of a cake pan, and baked them a few degrees cooler.  They came out very moist and flavorful.  I think the trick is to pack them full of blueberries.   One of the teachers even asked for the recipe!

I made these for breakfast.  My 5 year old did not like the blueberries.  I used 3 whole eggs and 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 unbleached flour, and a drop of milk to make the batter a bit creamier.  Next time I will use more bannanas (I used 2 1/2-not enough.)  The bluberries make it sweet. This is a healthy alternative to traditional bannana muffins I have made in the past with butter and sugar.

I changed the brown sugar to 1/2 cup sugar. I used 2 whites. I added 3/4 cup skim milk, 1 tablespoon oil, 2 tablespoons natural applesauce, and a little salt. I had 3/4 cup banana and 1 1/4 cup blueberries. I baked them at 400 degrees for 18 minutes. Next time I will try all applesauce and use splenda for half of the sugar. My husband, 2yr old, and I really liked them. My husband said they taste more like a quick bread than a muffin, but still very good.

These muffins are okay, but not great.  I made it as stated, except my bananas only yielded 1 cup so I added some applesauce to make the 1 1/2 cups.  I also used two whole eggs instead of the 4 egg whites.  They were a bit too heavy for my kids due to the fact that these are made with all whole wheat flour.  If I make them again, I will probably use 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour.  Overall, it is a healthy recipe with close to 1/2 fruit serving in every muffin.  I like the fact that there is no added oil, yet they were still very moist.

A quick recipe, but not too much flavor, besides the blueberries. Adding a little sugar on the top before putting them in the oven helps to sweeten it up, and yes it does need tweaking.  The mix after adding the egg white mixture was too dry and I had to add more egg whites.  Using all whole wheat flour can make them too bready, maybe doing half wheat and half white; I'll let you know when I try!

Surprisingly good!It fit my craving and severe lack of ingredients-- no butter or oil, no applesauce to sub.   I had no blueberries so I cut up a can of dark sweet cherries (which turned them blue!) and I used 3 whole eggs and 1/2whole wheat, 1/2 regular flour.  Didn't measure the bananas, just mashed up 3 of them. Added a handful of chocolate chips and a crunchy topping of  granola cereal with some extra sugar and cinnamon.  Delicious!! Especially when warm!

It's a pretty easy recipe to follow and very healthy for a muffing, however it lacks taste. Adding walnuts helped but the muffing dried up after a couple of days. I see the potential in this recipe, but it requires tweaking...

I was looking for anything to use my bananas and blueberries in and decided on this. Took tips from reviews and did make a few changes, but in the end came out good. I'm sure I had more blueberries, bananas, cinnmon, and vanilla than called for. Did the half wheat half white flour, and only had three eggs so did two whites and one whole. When mixed up it was too thick so added about 1/3 whole milk. Sprinkled the top with raw sugar- looks and tastes better for garnishing! 
It does taste healthy, but the sugar and extra berries saved it. Thinking served with butter and jam it would be more delectable.

I just made these and they turned out great! I took the advice of other reviewers and did half white flour and half whole wheat flour. I also did 2 whole eggs rather than egg whites. My batter was super thick - i don't think I had enough mashed banana so I thinned it out with some milk. I also topped with cinnamon sugar and they took 20 min instead of 16. Thanks for a great recipe! 
Update: i made a second batch and used 4 bananas and added 2 TBSP oil to the recipe. i still needed a bit of milk as the batter was thick but they turned out AMAZING. I also added coconut. 5 stars!

good muffins. I used white flour, and added 1/4 cup milk and 2 eggs instead of whites. I topped with 1/3 cup nuts, 1/3 cup brown sugard and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I also added extra blueberries. I will make this again.

Made the muffins to recipe and then wished I had read more of the reviews...these muffins are very plain and don't really taste like anything.  Desperately need more flavor of some sort...more berries, more spices, more sugar...I know it's very healthy, but it would be healthier to just not eat them.

Following the recipe exactly, I found that these muffins lacked flavor and were overly dense. however I will try this again with a few modifications.  Allowing the batter to sit before baking, and adding some sweetness would be a great improvement.

These are DELICIOUS! i modified the recipe a bit, per recommendations below... I don't like to measure exactly soooo aside from the eggs, my substitutions are approximations: 2 egg whites and one whole egg, split the flour 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white, added a dash of salt, added 1/4 C. unsweet applesauce and 1/4 - 1/3 C light soy milk, and i used frozen blueberries, probably more than called for! I rinsed the berries in warm water to get some ice off them, then tossed them with maybe a Tbs of flour before folding them into the batter. I only had 3 almost over-ripe bananas but it worked well, also used 1/3 C PACKED dark brown sugar.  After pouring to the muffin pan, I sprinkled a little Demerara cane sugar on top of each. They cooked quickly and rose really well so don't over-fill muffin pan! GREAT flavor, moist, perfect with a little bit of butter while still warm =)

Very dry and bland. I sprinkled the tops with additional sugar and cinnamon but they are still lacking in taste. Also I had to add more moisture to the dough, (maybe I had small bananas?). I've had much better tasting healthy muffins.

Very good recipe. I made some modifications - used half whole wheat and and half unbleached white flour, added 3 tbsp butter, and used 1 1/2 cup fresh blueberries. I think it could have used a little more sugar.

I just HAD to review these. With very few adjustments, the were phenomenal. I had to stop myself from eating the whole batch. I was very skeptical that any muffin could taste good without oil or butter. This recipe proves that a healthful option is available without compromising taste or texture. The minor modifications I made: Used one whole egg with two whites; used raw turbinado sugar instead of brown sugar; used half white whole wheat (King Arthur) and half all purpose four; used double the cinnamon (and probably a bit more banana); added about 1/4 cup buttermilk because the batter was a bit dry.  Absolutely delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe with changes.  After looking at other reviews I used half whole wheat and half white flour, 2 whole eggs and some milk (not measured, sorry).  I also used 3 large overripe bananas (only had 3) and I added about 1/4 cup oats.  I upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added a dash of nutmeg.  Topped the muffins with mixture of brown sugar,  white sugar, and cinnamon.  I had some batter left over after making 12 muffins so I tried making some little pancakes with the rest, using salted butter in the pan.  Both were very yummy.  I meant to add coconut as another reviewer did, but forgot.  There will be a next time very soon, so I will try coconut then.

When they came right out of the oven they were alright (nothing out of the ordinary), but cooled down they only tasted like baking soda.

We did not care for these muffins. The flavor wasn't good, the texture was kind of rough, and there was a bitter after-taste.  Maybe it was my ingredients...I had to use frozen blueberries.

Delicious.  I added 2 t of vanilla syrup instead of vanilla and put some brown sugar on top at the end of cooking. Served with honey butter to make a little sweeter. Could really taste the whole wheat flavor and the banana and blueberries.  Not too dry.

Bland and too dense is my general impression after making these.  Tasted like banana bread with something missing and the blueberries seemed like an afterthought, really didn't go well together.  I will compare to other banana bread recipes, something is missing or the ratios are off for this one as posted.

I did not care for these.  Thankfully I halved the recipe on the first try..  They are tasteless, dry, and there are many better recipes for your ripe bananas.

Family Approved.  The kids devoured these.  I realized after the fact that there was no butter or oil and it really was moist.  I used 1/2 cup egg whites from a container. Added granulated sugar just on the top b4 baking.   B/c the batter came out thick, I scooped a lil in the cupliner, then added 3 large blueberries, added more batter, then 3 more and then one more layer of batter.  The blue berries did not break or turn the batter purple.  It's a really good recipe.  Thank you.

These turned out great!  I couldn't find my reg recipe, so I did a search for a quick and easy one and found this one.  I used 2 cups of banana, because that's how much I had.  Used pastry flour (2 cups, plus 2 tbls), because again, that's what I had.  Chocolate chips instead of blueberries and the kids gobbled them up!

Nice and healthy, the whole wheat and bananas compliment each other very well, everything was in perfect alignment to make a great muffin.  It was missing that Wow factor though.  I enjoyed them and would make them again if that was what I was in the mood for.  Thanks for sharing.

We gobbled these up!  They were so yummy!  Even the kids loved them.  I had to make a second batch to share with our neighbors, and of course they asked for the recipe.  Because of the reviews, I was concerned that they might be dry or bland, so I used 1.5 cups blueberries and added 1/2 cup applesauce.  They took an extra couple of minutes to bake, but they were amazing.  I'm addicted.

Ok muffins, lacked some flavor, and didn't rise very well. If I were to do these again, I would add about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I could be wrong, but I don't see the need for the baking soda, since there are very few acid producing ingredients in the recipe (perhaps this might have contributed to a lack of sufficient rising). You may get better rising results by eliminating the baking soda altogether.

I might try using 1/2 wheat 1/2 white flour next time. I added both milk and oil to try and get the batter a bit thinner. I also used muffin cup liners and 1/4 of the muffin sticks to them. I guess they were OK but not a fav for sure.

The only changes I made to this recipe were to add 1/2 cup of mashed blueberries in addition to the 1 cup of whole berries.  I also doubled the cinnamon and added three dashes of nutmeg.  Although these muffins were very moist (and beautiful) they did not have a lot of flavor.  Even adding a big tab of butter to the center while they were hot did not do much to help them.

WOW! I am so pleased to finally have a recipe that is both healthy and GOOD! I love that it used ALL wheat flour and NO oil. YUM! both of my kids LOVED it, and my husband said it was okay (he's really got a sweet tooth, so for him I'd have to add 1 cup of brown sugar to please). The only thing is that I altered it a little. I added 1/2 cup of 2%milk because my bananas were ripe, but not slimy ripe (which is what I usually use) and my batter was more like dough and not at all muffin-like. It is a total repeat recipe that I will be using again and again for my family. I even feel confident that this will be in my "Crowd Pleaser" collection. THANK YOU!

I halved this recipe in order to put it in a 12 slot mini muffin tin, but then forgot to half the banana. This turned into wonderfully moist muffins and everyone loved the texture!  I also sprinkled a small bit of white sugar on top before baking to give a crust and hid 1 semisweet chocolate chip into each muffin for a nice suprise.  Great recipe, quick and easy

Used 3 eggs instead of whites and a whole pint of blueberries. They would have been quite dry without the extra blueberries. Also, they took 20 minutes to bake.  Will make again.

These are great!  Made with whole wheat flour, and no oil or butter -- so they're super healthy!  The only adjustments I made were:  I used 1/2 cup egg substitute in place of the egg whites; and I had to cook them for an extra 2 minutes.  (Probably because of my oven, not the recipe!)  Next time I might add a bit more cinnamon...

This was a good base recipe for me. I made the following changes: 1.5 cups whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup regular flour. 2 whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites. 3 tablespoons canola oil added. I did 1/2 cup blueberries and 1/2 cup raspberries. Made into 24 mini muffins. My 13 month old loves these.

I just made 4 batches of these for Valentine's Day (enough for each of my two children's daycare classes and my own kindergarten class). My kids (13 months and 2 and half years old) loved them and I really like the banana blueberry combo. Thanks for the recipe!

this receipe has a great concept---only egg whites, no fat and fruit as a sweetner---great for adults but not for my two year old who likes healthy things a little sweeter.  I would sprinkle some cinnamon and sugar as a topping for her next time.

I followed the recipe (using frozen blueberries), and these came out bland.  I think they may have needed more sugar, and a little bit of oil.

I'm really didn't taste the banana or the blueberries. What Iv'e done to the blueberries and all the recipes with blueberries is Iv'e rolled them in dough because if you don't it will make the dough all blue. It was fairly easy to make and I'm 9.

I used whole wheat flour and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup. This needed almost a full cup more liquid than was called for, I ended up adding buttermilk. I'm lucky they didn't turn out tough, I did my best not to over mix them. I did sprinkle just a touch of brown sugar over the top before baking.

These are excellent!  So many of these recipes are insanely sweet.  Not this one.  Try it!  You'll be glad you did.  I added about a tbsp. of dark cocoa powder just cuz it sounded good and it was.

If these were titled, "healthy" I would have given it 4 stars. They're definitely a little bland, but if you want a healthy non greasy muffin, this is it. I used 2 eggs bc didn't want to waste 4. I did sprinkle cin/sugar on top (before baking) like others suggested but it wasn't strong enough. If I make these again, I won't add the topping, but I will split a hot muffin (after baking) and sprinkle cin/sug in it before eating. The more blueberries, the sweeter, so don't skimp! In my oven these rose nicely and were done after 18-19 minutes. I only got 11 muffins.

My muffin tin was in storage so I made these just in a 8x8 baking pan and increased the baking time to 35 min.  It turned out very well and have remained moist and tasty even 4 days later!  I also forgot to put cinnamon in but it still tastes great!  Thank you for the healthy alternative!

Evidently some people doesn't realize that muffin batter is THICK. It's suppose to be thick. You're not making cupcakes.  I only made 3 changes in making these. I used 2 eggs and 1 cup of WW flour and 1 cup SR flour with 1 teaspoon of baking powder and left off the soda.  I baked these in 2 batches. Thirst batch was not sweet enough for my liking, so I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the other batter and these turned out perfect.  I'll definitely be making these again, with about 3/4 cup of sugar.

Amazing! Followed the recipe exactly, only using two whole eggs instead of egg whites. They were much more like regular muffins than I expected. They are very moist. I would take them out of the tin and on to drying rack to avoid them getting soggy. Great way to get nutrition. If you want sweet delicate muffins, this isn't the right recipe- but if you are looking for a way to have a muffin you can enjoy every morsel of and have no guilt eating a second one. Make these daily!!!

I thought these were horrible, to be honest.  I wanted a healthier muffin, but they were sticky and dry.  I wasn't going to change the recipie, but I had to add milk because the batter was far thicker than a muffin batter.  Maybe I did something wrong--a lot of people liked these.  Of course, a lot of people made seven or eight changes to the recipie and then rated it.  I'm also not used to eating healthy recipies, so that could be it too.

Pretty good but still need a little tweaking. I added an extra tsp. of vanilla, 1/2 c. applesauce, 1/4 cup milk and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking. I will make again, but I think I'll add an extra banana next time.

I took some other reviewers' advice and sprinkled sugar on top. I also added about a tablespoon (or 2 maybe) of milk so the batter wouldn't be so thick. These were good, but not great. I will increase the sugar next time because they weren't sweet.

These tasted wonderful! The only change I made was to use half white flour and half whole wheat, so they turned out less dense. The banana made the muffins moist, and everyone loved them! I will make these again!

These are so-so. I used 2 whole eggs and regular flour as a substitute. You can't really taste the banana flavor too much--just tastes kind of bland. Won't be making this one again.

I just tasted these out of the oven and they are darn good considering they have no oil.  I made my normal substitution of whole wheat pastry flour and EggBeaters.  I also wanted to use my two large muffin pans so I increased the recipe by 50% and added some chopped fresh strawberries for the extra blueberries I would have needed.  I usually sprinkle about 1/4 tsp of vanilla sugar on muffins before baking so I did this as well.  The only thing I might add next time is a little salt.  They were very good and I'll make them again because they are pretty much guilt-free and very easy to put together.  For those who found them tough, do not overmix the batter.  Whole wheat flours especially will develop gluten with too much mixing.  It's best to fold the liquids into the flour with as few strokes as possible.  It really makes a difference in the texture of any muffin or quickbread.

This is a great starting off recipe.  I too tweaked it a bit.  I used 1.5 cups unbleached flour and 1/2 c w/w flour, added a 1/2 tsp salt, used 3 medium very ripe bananas.  In a 1 cup measure, I cracked 2 lrg eggs, added 1/4 c veg oil and then filled to the 1 c line with milk.  Mixed everything together til moist and was able to get 24 muffins.  Cooked for 10 mins then rotated my pans and cooked for addt'l 10 mins.  They are a touch on the bland side, but next time I will try adding a bit more sugar and cinnamon.

This is an absolutely great recipe. Very easy to make, hard to mess up. I did make a couple changes to mine after reading several reviews. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour, because the whole wheat seemed like it would be too heavy.I used 4 medium sized very ripe bananas. (This is what made it so moist and sweet)I used about 1/2 cup of splenda brown sugar blend. Sprinkled in some regular splenda sweetener. I added a little fat free milk, because the mix was a little too thick. I sprinkled just a couple semi-sweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, a little bit of rolled oats and sprinkled a litte bit more of splenda sweetener. These came out perfect and very tasty! I recalculated the calories and still came out not too bad. About 135 cal. each. Thanks for the recipe!!

I thought this was a good healthy muffin recipe.  I did make some changes, used 4 ripe bananas, 2 eggs instead of 4 egg whites, used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/3.  Also, I used frozen blueberries.  The came out moist and did rise quite a bit.  I had to cook them a couple of extra minutes.  I think next time I will try sprinkling them with sugar in the raw for a little more sweetness and maybe add extra blueberries.

These were good. I added a bit more vanilla and a little more sugar. I used about two cups of over ripe bananas from my freezer which sweetened them up. I didn't have any blueberries which is why I added the extra banana. They were good. They were a little thick so I added a bit of water to the batter. I'll make them again for sure. I'm doing weight watchers and each muffin was 2 pts.

This recipe was perfect!  I used four overly ripe bananas that I had stored in the freezer and threw in some extra blueberries.  I also used the splenda blend of brown sugar.  These came out extremely moist and delicious!  I will definitely make these muffins again!

They were sweet, but healthy and moist all at the same time! We actually made mini-muffins with a bit of applesauce and wheat germ, and extra banana. Mmmmm...a great snack.

Good. I followed others advice by adding a touch more bananas. There were plenty of blueberries, good overall for it's health content; best when topped with a touch of butter! I also think a cinnamon/sugar crunchy topping would be good. Will make again.

Ok, any one who is familiar with the movie "Charlie's Angels", and remembers the part where Alex (the Lucy Liu character) bakes muffins and Dylan (Drew Barrymore) throws one at Natalie (Cam Diaz) and it sticks in the door.....LOL, that's sorta what these reminded me of.  BUT, for as healthy as they are, with low calories...I'll take it!  I did use egg beaters, which could be why they were a bit dense, but my 5 year old who can finally eat eggs really liked them....actually he made them.  Next time I will add nutmeg and maybe another banana + more vanilla.  Thanks for the nice recipe!

This is the first Muffin that I've baked and I'm very happy. It was easy to prepare but I used 180C (my oven doesn't have 170C setting) and baked for 15 min. Also I lined my muffin trays instead of greasing them. The outcome tasted really great and using good quality blueberries really help add bits of sweetess. 
Only problem is the muffins didn't rise as much as I thought they would and they tasted quite thick, more like bread than a muffin. Still Yummy and Healthy tasting.

I have made this twice.  First time I followed exactly and the muffins were very dense.  It was my first time cooking with whole wheat flour though.  The 2nd time i used 3 Medium bananas and a mixed cup of blackberries and blueberries.  The muffins are moist and delicious!  I will make this time and time again :)

i love this recipe. Its so healthy and amazingly delicious. What i did so my blueberries didn't sink was. Covered the wet blueberries in 1/2 of the flour, then folded them in after. I will definitely make this amazing recipe again. -Thank You

Liked that it's a healthy recipe. I did use 1 cup whole wheat + 1 cup white flour, 2 whole eggs instead of 4 whites, & about 1/4 cup almond milk (batter was very stiff without it). They didn't have a lot of flavor, but were very moist. When I make them again, I will just add more cinnamon & maybe a pinch of nutmeg or allspice.

Easy, tasty and a good way to use up bananas that are getting a little too soft. The first time I made the muffins, I thought the batter was a bit dry so added some low fat blueberry yoguert. The muffins were perfect. Today, the batter didn't seem so dry, but the bananas were previously frozen so that may have added more moisture to the batter. I also added some orange zest, hemp seed and bulgur to increase the protein and fiber content. This recipe seems very forgiving and love the fact that it doesn't contain any oil.

Holy cow, not what I expected. I prefer sweeter, moister muffins.
Came out very dense and dry.

Just took these out of the oven, had one, then had to have another because it was so good!  I did however make some modifications based on what other reviewers, I used 3 eggs (with yolks) rather than the 4 egg whites, did half white and half brown flour, and sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon before baking, I also used frozen blueberries (because it is March and fresh ones I can get at the store aren't really that fresh).  They turned out great!  I think next time I will try with all whole wheat flour just because I think they would have been good like that in hindsight.  Was shocked how good they were without any oil or butter.  Only complaint, which was my own doing (not following the recipe again) I put paper liners in my muffin tins and they stuck really bad to the papers.  Otherwise great, healthy muffins, were fun to make with the kids and my 4 year old daughter loved them (my son is 2 and stubborn and won't try them yet).  Overall great recipe that I will make again!

Very yummy!  Did as some others suggested, 1/2 white, 1/2 w.w. flour, a bit of coconut and 1/3 C sr. cream.  Turned out moist and delicious and not too sweet!

Just made these muffins and eating my third one as I type this review.....I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour....added extra brown sugar because of all the reviews.......also added flaxseed......I did find the batter very very dry while I was mixing it , and added some non fat milk and it was perfect........the muffins are delicious, I don't find them bland at all!! Yes, they are a bit dry, but, that's alright......will definitely make again....

These are very easy to make and I love that the recipe uses whole wheat flour. My batter seemed a little dry so I added some milk while I was mixing. I would recommend either tossing the blueberries in some sugar or adding a streusel topping since the muffins are kind of bland. Other than that this is a great easy recipe.

These were good and I probably will make them again for myself. That being said, the whole wheat flavor was incredibly strong, and the muffins were dry. If you want a moist flavorful muffin this is not the recipe for you. I was the only one in the family that liked them, though everyone did eat them.

I like recipes that are health-ified and still taste good. Unfortunately, this one didn't meet our taste standards. To be fair, I made some changes - substituted 1/2 white flour, used 2 yolks and 3 egg whites, and used brown sugar Splenda blend, in hopes that I could turn out a reasonably healthy but still tasty muffin. It tasted like wheat bread with blueberries. I will grudgingly finish them, but my son said they tasted "yucky". I will stick with the "Lighter Banana Muffins" from this website and try adding blueberries to it. Sorry...

I had 3 very ripe bananas and blueberries to use up so I tried these.  I used 1/3 cup brown sugar and per other reviews I also added 1/3 cup Splenda.  I added extra cinnamon and a splash of almond extract for more flavor.  I even  sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking for 12 minutes in muffin top pans.  Even with the modifications they were very bland and tasteless!

Followed the recipe almost exactly, but had to add a little milk as the batter was too dry.  Also used 2 whole eggs vs. 4 egg whites.  I know these are meant to be healthy muffins, but they really need more flavor!  Might try again but add some butter and try a brown sugar crumble on top

Yum! These are fantastic!  Like many raters, I slightly altered the recipe, using whole wheat pastry flour, two whole eggs instead of the whites, and 1/4 cup agave nectar in place of the brown sugar. I baked them at 325 degrees for 20 min. and they came out perfect. They rose beautifully and were very moist, with just the right amount of sweetness. I'll be making these again for sure!

I love muffins!  And I loved this recipe because they are sooo much healthier, I didn't feel guilty eating them! They were dense, obviously because of only whole wheat flour, but they were definitely not dry. Great banana flavour, I did not measure 1 1/2 cups rather I just added 3 bananas. I do think I would try adding more cinnamon next time because I couldn't really taste it enough for my liking.  I was worried when I first started adding the bananas and egg whites, that the batter would be really dry, but it ended up just as wet as any other muffin recipe I've used.  This is my new go-to recipe when I want a muffin treat.

These rock! I split the flour to use half whole wheat, half all purpose; split the sugar to use half turbinado and half white (gave it a little tiny crunch); used 2 whole eggs instead of 4 whites; added some freshly grated nutmeg and a splash of almond extract; and 2 tablespoons of buttermilk to moisten the batter. I also used almost 2 cups of fresh blueberries, lightly dusted in flour to keep them from mushing when baked. Will definitely add this to my recipe collection.

These muffins are super dry - I had to add a half cup of milk at the end which made them overmixed and tough.  If you add some liquid in before you mix the wet ingredients in, though, I bet they'd be great!

This was really good! I made some changes because I was honestly afraid reading the ingredients that it would be VERY dry! So I used one container of OIKOS single serve blueberry  greek yogurt, one whole egg and two egg whites. I used frozen blueberries which I stirred with 2 tbsp flour mixture before adding at the end. I used sparkle sugar on the top to sweeten it up a little. Baked it in a tealoaf pan. YUM! and soooo good for you. My daughter is now asking for her 4th piece! Thanks AR and ELEMMIRE!

Pretty good recipe.  I took the liberty of making a few changes though, of course.  I added about 3/4 C of applesauce and used 2 whole eggs instead of the egg whites and used about 1.5 to 2 Cups of frozen blueberries.  I also did half white and half wheat flour.  At first bite, they seemed a little bland, but by the next day they started to taste better.  I might add a crumble topping next time, just to give them a little something extra.  I love this recipe though- great way to use up those bananas and clean the freezer of fruit!

Was really easy to make and loved that there was no butter.  Instead of egg whites, I did 1 egg and 5 bananas (about 2 cups) and a little bit of milk (a little less than 1/4 cup), which made the batter really moist.  My co-workers loved them.  They are only good first two days, then they start to get soggy and heavy.

Ok. I agree with some past reviewers that there is something missing? I used 1C whole wheat flour and 1C white flour and 2 whole eggs instead of 4 whites. Tastes very healthy and flavor isn't bad but I may add just a bit of oil or even butter with maybe some honey if I make these again. Thanks for the recipe though, I needed to use up a few bananas!

These are just crazy good! Very healthy, takes care of the sweet tooth without doing damage to the diet. Also, a good pre-workout snack. For once, I left the recipe as it was... perfection! Getting ready to make it again, just waiting on the bananas! Enjoy~

Pretty good and healthy too. Would be better for kids made with huckleberries since they are smaller. Not sure if all kids dont like larger berries cooked in things or just mine:)

These were great, I did have to add about 2 T of milk and used a full teaspoon of cinnamon, 2 eggs in place of the egg whites, rolled the blueberries in some flour before adding,used four smallish size over ripe bananas. I also sprinkled the tops with a cinnamon sugar mixture before baking. They rose good and didn't stick-but I did have to bake 5 mins more. Make sure you pack the brown sugar!!!

These were very, very good! I don't understand why some people said they weren't sweet enough. I thought they were perfect. If you want sweet, make cupcakes, not muffins.

I make these whenever I have bananas that are darker than what my family likes to eat. I feel they are a little dry so I add 1 tbsp of veg. oil. Overall I think they are very tasty.

These are surprisingly yummy, considering all the ingredients are wholesome, healthy ones. No, they're not chocolate cupcakes, but my kids and I eat them up! I've made these 4 or 5 times now and I follow the recipe exactly. They freeze well too.

For all you recipe-purists out there, don't hate me.. but I made about a million changes to this recipe. Used AP flour (that's all I had), 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/3 cup ground flaxseed, 1/3 cup rolled oats, 4 medium bananas, 3/4 cup soymilk, 3T applesauce, 2 whole eggs + 1 egg white, and 2 cups fresh blueberries.  I also added a not-so-healthy streusel to the tops of the muffins consisting of 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c brown sugar, 4T butter, 1/4 c granola, 1/4 c rolled oats. Baked at 335 for 16 minutes. The result was a moist, slightly sweet muffin with a sinfully delightful crunch topping. YUMMMMM. The only problem is that the muffin sticks to the paper liner and you lose a lot of it when eating it. I don't know how to avoid that. I'll probably use this recipe a lot for a fairly simple and healthy way to use leftover bananas- plus you can sub the blueberries for a variety other fruits.

They are an alright muffin.  My husband and I don't mind them but my kids won't touch them.  I changed three things; I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, added a few chocolate chips and I added some vanilla yogurt for flavor.  I don't think I'll be making these again.

My 4-1/2 year old son helped me make these and it went great!   Both of us and my hubby just loved these.  My husband likes breads, cakes, muffins but is not a big sweets fan so these are right up his alley with most of the sugar coming from the fruit itself.   I mostly followed the recipe only making the change of using whole eggs instead of whites, and even then I added a couple more eggs to the mix because it seemed the dough was a bit toooo thick when we went to put it in the pan. I have heard that cooking with wheat flour can make cakes/breads more dense and less fluffy so that might be why.   The only other change I made is sprinkling some granola cereal and cinnamon on the very tops of the muffins before baking, and I made a double batch which made about two-three dozen depending on how full you filled the cups of the pan.   Excellent recipe and will use it many more times in the future!!! Thanks!

After I finished making the batter I had to add a little splash of milk to losen it up a bit. It needed more of a banana flavor and they were a little to dry for me. Just an okay muffin.

These muffins turned out very dense for me.  The batter looked really thick as I was mixing it, and I had to add 2 T. oil to get it to come together...they were okay, but lacked overall flavor. They still taste okay, just not great.

I loved these!  I made a few alterations that I think made them even tastier.  I added an extra banana, some extra blueberries and extra cinnamon.  I used two whole eggs and a little bit of extra sugar.  I also had some peaches on hand that needed used so I chopped them up really small and threw them in .  I added a little bit of heavy whipping cream because the batter was thicker than I thought it should be.  My husband even liked these and he is not much for muffins.

These were really good!  I took others suggestions and ended up using 2 whole eggs and extra cinnamon.  I also used the Splenda Brown Sugar and they came out great.  My little guys loved them too.  Healthy and delicious!

Just made these and tried one--they are great muffins! I followed a reviewers advice and used 1/3 cup brown sugar, two whole eggs, and a whole teaspoon of cinnamon. I also added a pureed peach--I had one laying around about to go bad--and it added some extra sweetness. Use lots of blueberries so you get that delicious burst of taste in every bite. Can't wait to have another one of these good-for-you treats with a cup of coffee for my breakfast tomorrow.

These were wonderful!  I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp, did 2 eggs (instead of egg whites), and instead of blueberries I added crasins.  When you pour the batter into the muffin tin the batter looks very think and kind of dry, but when the come out of the oven they are great!  I love this recipe because it is relatively healthy with whole wheat flour, only 1/3 cup of brown sugar and no oil, butter or honey.

These are great muffins!! I was so happy to find a recipe that used all wheat flour, as I had some extra whole-wheat pastry flour that I wanted to use.  I added 2 egg yolks and had to use frozen blueberries because fresh ones are so expensive here; but they turned out great! Not too sweet either, just right with a nice touch of cinnamon flavor. The recipe made exactly enough for 12 regular-sized muffins. I'll definitely make these again!

Very good for a healthy muffin. Not the most flavourful but healthy none the less. It did need a splash of milk as the batter was too dry, approximately 1/3 cup is what I used.

Made these a couple weeks ago, to a T.  Then over that weekend, and again today.  Today I did not have blueberries, so I used 1/2 black berries and 1/2 strawberries.  I did not think they were overly dry and they are sweet enough.  A new favorite!  Thank you for the recipe.

Made these last night.  Took the advice of one member and mashed 1/2 the blueberries and used 4 ripe bananas.  Followed recipe to the T and they turned out very tart and BLAND.  Daughter and hubby wouldn't eat them.

I found this recipe to be average. It was healthy, which was nice, but I found it kind of bland. It also wasn't very moist. I had to use white flour instead of wheat b/c I didn't have any on hand, and I used 2 whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites, so perhaps that is the reason. I also doubled the cinnamon, and it was still a little bland. I probably won't make these again without some tweaking.

Excellent Recipe!!  No matter what, DON'T add milk.  The only thing needed to be done to the recipe is this - mash half the blueberries and add to the banana mixture before adding to dry ingredients.  This gave the whole muffin a sweet flavor!

The batter to these muffins was more like bread dough.  After baking them my suspicion was correct.  This recipe would make a great loaf of bread.  Not a good muffin.

Good recipe to adjust per preferences / ingredients on hand.  As far as "healthy muffins" go, they are moist.  I used 1c unbleached flour and 1c whole wheat flour; added about 1/3c agave syrup (to add a bit of sweetness and extra liquid per others' comments); used 2 whole eggs rather than 4 egg whites; and raisins instead of blueberries for added texture.  I think they came out really well- 16 minutes perfect cooking time.  If you are looking for a healthier muffin, this is a great recipe to try.

I thought they turned out great. I added more vanilla and cinnamon, and I also mixed in 1 cup of white sugar. My husband thought they were a little thick, so next time I will add a little milk to make them thinner.

These were very good. For once s recipe accualy made the amount it said it would! I used frozen blueberries, althoughg I think fresh would be deffenitly better. I followed the recipe except I added a little milk because the batter was tooo thick but next time I would but a little bit of brown suger on the tops before I put them in the oven. This recipe would be good for a teen trying to make muffins.

The reason I am giving this 5 stars is that I love the fact it is a healthy muffin recipe.  I exchanged the brown sugar for about a 1/4 c. brown sugar splenda blend and also added some extra fiber to the muffins.  My husband  LOVES them and I will continue to share these when family comes to visit.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Used to bake/cook a bunch. Been on the road for 5 years. Now I'm off, decided to try this receipe. Changed almost everything, throwed in a big spoon sour cream, then 1/3 C vanilla yogurt, used whole eggs. Everything cept the eggs, blueberries and yogurt was stuff I had from when I went on the road. Filled liners 3/4 full, baked 350 for 20 minutes. Not half bad. . .next time I'll leave out the sour cream and use more cinnamon. Maybe try alittle more yogurt. With the original recipe my batter was too dry, need to throw something in there to make it alittle more liquid. Maybe alittle pudding in the mix would work. It's a great start recipe and you can do anything you want to it and it will only get better.

Cheers,
OTRPU

I really liked these muffins.  I did make a few subtle changes.  I increased the amnt of cinnamon, used egg beaters instead of egg whites and added blackberries in replace of blueberries.  Yes, the muffins are a little dense, but they are so hearty and moist.  I will certainly make these again, and will increase the amnt of banana's for a more distinguishable flavor.

Since I’m gluten-intolerant, I substituted the flour for GF flour. I also substituted the brown sugar for 1/2 cup of organic white sugar, added 1 Tbsp of Avocado oil, substituted milk for almond milk and increased to 1 cup because dough was more cookie-like. Also used two eggs instead of four egg whites. Muffins rose beautifully, but collapsed upon cool down which I’m sure is due to the GF flour. Muffins were moist and delicious, but not quit the right consistency. It’s tough sometimes trying to work with GF flour.. I’ll keep tweaking it.

I thought these muffins were absolutely delicious! My first time actually making muffins lol. But I don’t have one fix that I would add next time. The receptor never called for milk or butter, so the muffins never had a soft texture. It was very dry. I had to add butter on top mine so add some type of moisture. Other than that, good!

We didn't have Wheat flour and used unbleached flour.  It was a bit bland for our taste and was a bit too starchy but that may have been the type of flour we used.

The recipe was easy, but tasted plain like something was missing. Also I found it to be a little bit dry. If you put a lot of butter or something on them they’re edible. Maybe if you use the best flour you can get then maybe you’d get a slightly better product. Maybe some oil in the recipe would help I don’t know. I followed directions.

I followed the directions perfectly- using 3 very ripe bananas and 1 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries. I made mini muffins instead of the large size. I did read the reviews and followed the advice of adding brown sugar crumbles on too.

Made recipe exactly as written. Muffins came out dense, dry, and lacking in flavor. Would adjust recipe next time to half white flour and half wheat flour and add oil or butter.

It came of well. But I feel it was still short of the taste we get in markets. How to improve?
But based on that I made strawberry muffins which tasted good. I include a picture.

These muffins need more sugar. Other than that I like them. I used 3 eggs instead of egg whites. I might use 2 eggs next time and some applesauce for sweetness.

Very "healthy" tasting, dry, dense. Adding butter on top helped, but overall, it wasn't a muffin that I would think of as a muffin. It was more like dense bread.

These muffins are really healthy and have great taste (at least I found them sweet enough) I followed the advice of half unbleached flour and half whole wheat and it turned great . I also used 3 eggs instead of only the 4 egg whites. Thank you for the recipe!

I must have done something wrong! I used 3 bananas and 2 whole eggs, but the batter was still very dry so I added about 1/3 cup of milk. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and added a spoonful of blueberry jam to the middle of the muffins. They turned out OK, but I find the flavour to be bland :(.

I had some very ripe bananas and didn't want standard banana bread. Then I remembered I had some frozen blueberries and wanted to make blueberry banana muffins. Then I found this recipe and felt I was up to the challenge (based on the reviews, it seems like it would be a challenge to get the correct flavor and consistency). 

So, I just wanted to start off by saying that I read the reviews and tweaked this recipe A LOT. Even with all of the modifications I made, I still think these were just "Okay" and maybe even a little bland. 

First I doubled the recipe because I wanted to have extras laying around. This actually made 31 muffins by doubling the recipe, filling the tins a little over 3/4 of the way. This is the recipe I ended up using with all of my modifications:

4 c unbleached white flour
2/3 c packed brown sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon
4 tsp baking powder
2 tsp baking soda
~1/4 tsp sea salt (possibly more)
~1/4 tsp nutmeg (possibly more)
6 large ripe bananas, mashed
4 whole eggs
2 tsp vanilla
2 1/2 c heaping blueberries

I followed a few of the reviewers suggestions and rinsed the blueberries in warm water then tossed with a little bit of flour to soak up some of the rest of the juice/water before I folded the blueberries into the batter. I also let it sit for about 10 minutes before putting the  batter into the muffin tins. Also, sprinkle a little white sugar on the top of the muffins for a little extra sweetness.

I'm honestly not sure how these are if were to follow t

I used Black Berries instead of Blueberries and it was SUPER good.  I am a runner and am always looking for a healthy breakfast grab, or pre/post run snack and I can't get enought of these.  They will  be my "go-to muffins!"

This recipe is good. The whole wheat flour does make I very dry. You might want to do half whole wheat and half all purpose flour.

Loved these! They are moist and delicious; plenty flavorful perhaps because of a couple tweaks. I'll make these again for company or to take to a brunch.

Used 1/2 cup brown sugar (not packed), 1 generous tsp of cinnamon, 2 whole eggs, half whole wheat/half white flour. Didn't have quite enough banana so supplemented with adding 1/4 c applesauce. Added some granola mixed with cinnamon to top per another suggestion.

This is the second time making this recipe and I made a few small changes, amazing and addictive:
Used 248g of blueberries
Used 291g of bananas
Added 2.25tsp of cinnamon - cant get enough of the stuff
Used 57g of light brown muscovado sugar (reduces calories)
Sprinkled a few oats on top of some of the muffins to add a different texture.
Calories per muffin for me was 81 YEAH!!!

Love, love, love these muffins!  I used half wheat and half white flour, two eggs and when the batter was a little thick, I added a bit of almond milk that I had on hand.  I love that they are not so awfully sweet like some, and man, when you bite into one of those blueberries...heaven...!!!  I ended up with twelve beautiful muffins, and I will definitely make them again and again!  Bet you could experiment with other fruits as well!

Excellent whole grain recipe!  Banana adds moist texture and a lot of sweetness without the need for much sugar (unless you're palette's adjusted otherwise).  I didn't have fresh blueberries, so I used frozen, thawed them out in some cold water and drained well before adding which kept them from turning to mush.

Only thing I changed was not adding and vanilla extract, which I recently ran out of.  These were KILLER!  I will be making them sooo many more times!  My very picky boyfriend even ate 2... until I told him they were healthy.. and he asked the ingredients...  Once he found out they were whole wheat he was done.  They were wonderful though, and I can't wait to make more!

I thought these muffins were very bland. It's hard to find muffins with much flavor and that was certainly a problem with these. They were much better served with butter (isn't everything?) but a great muffin can stand alone.

ok. here goes some ideas about the recipe.  I thought that I followed the recipe close enough.  But I must have done something that changed what all of you got in the end.  Mine were quite moist.  I used 1 3/4 c whole wheat flour, 1/4 c ground flax, 4 slimmy ripe bananas, 1 1/3 c of frozen large blueberries and 1 c 60% cocoa chocolate chips, 4 egg whites and the rest the same as the original recipe.  I didn't think any of these changes would have made such a great difference.  They were very moist, and had to add another 3 minutes to the time for baking. Anyone want to try this way and let me know how they work for you?  Good luck

I thought this recipe was very dry and bland. Sorry to those of you who loved it, I just didn't enjoy it. I added cinnamon, and the batter was so dry I ha to add soy milk. I think it needs more sugar, and some fat. Maybe 1/2 cup oil or melted butter. I'll try it again some other way.

These are really tasty. They are quite flavorful with the bananas, blueberries, and cinnamon. My only complaint is they were a bit on the dry/dense side, but hey, they are healthy muffins, what do you expect? I added more blueberries than called for, maybe 1/2 cup more.

I don't know if I did something wrong but the mixture was so dry!  I added two whole eggs instead of egg whites, and I had to add milk because of the dryness.  They stuck to the papers so much that you ended up losing half your muffin to it and they tasted very very bland.

These were super easy and so delicious. I was nervous about trying the recipe because of the mixed reviews, so I was very happy with the end result. They are just sweet and cinnamony enough that they do not taste too healthy. :-)

Not bad for a healthy muffin...but definitely not great. I followed the recipe except I added some unsweetened applesauce for a more moist muffin.  Mine looked nothing like those in the picture...they didn't rise at all. They will suffice but not sure if I will make again! Thanks anyway!!

Good wheat flour recipe. Used 2 whole eggs in place of 2 egg whites. Tip: do not use yellow bananas. I'm going to use a bit of orange juice the next time I make it.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I did take advise from others and added skim milk, more cinnimon, used just 2 egg whites, added a little nutmeg.  I also added 1/2 cup of walnuts because my family likes them.  I also used splenda instead of the sugar.  They turned out quite moist.
Thank You

I made these last night, added an extra banana & a little nutmeg, and had to cook them about twice as long, but they turned out good! They're a little bland, but not bad! I think I'll make them again but add a lil' sweetener of some kind ;-) Thank you!

These were OKAY.  For some reason mine weren't so much fluffy as they were little rocks.  I followed the recipe exactly, maybe it was my flour brand or something.  Anyways, if you are looking for healthy these aren't too bad in terms of taste.

These are great muffins for the family, my mum simply love it when i made it and adding the fact that it's healthy but i still can't get the satisfaction from the others for they thought of the muffin a little bit dry. Might be the fact that it's made out of whole wheat. From the other's review, will next time add a little milk to make it softer. This is an amazing recipe, please try it! (^^)

I don't know if reading the reviews before I made these would have stopped me, but I did not care for these. They were way too dry, not flavorful at all, and a sad waste of handpicked blueberries from my yard.  I'm not going to bother to try again, but if I did, I'd add butter or something to make the insides moist.  Skip this one!!

I followed the recipe exactly except for using frozen instead of fresh blueberries. I thought these turned out well, they make a good breakfast. They aren't the tastiest muffins ever but thats the trade-off for the healthy ingredients, low suger, and low fat.

I was almost out of cinnamon so I didn't put in as much as called for...usually I use extra, but I did add extra vanilla. I didn't have fresh blueberries so I added frozen and this was a really good muffin. My out of town guests really enjoyed them.

There is something defiantly missing form this recipe!  I added butter milk just so I could combine the ingredients.  They came out okay with the milk. I gave the recipe a 1 because it was incorrect.  I won’t make these again.

This was a great recipe to start with, but I took the cue from others' reviews and added a little to suit my taste.  I used whole eggs, and added about a 1/2 cup extra banana, also two extra egg whites to stop them from being so dense.  Instead of using all flour, I used 1 1/4 cup of wheat flour and about a cup of oatbran/flax meal.  I also added walnut meal and almond meal for an extra nutritious punch.  This made a great breakfast muffin and a good energy snack!  Oh, and more cinnamon and vanilla!
