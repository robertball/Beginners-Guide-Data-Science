This was awesome!  I used 1 tsp. dried rosemary instead of fresh because that's all I had on hand, and marinated for about 6 hours.  I wouldn't hesistate using this same marinade for shrimp either!  I pan-fried instead of grilling - used cooking spray, and cooked on med. high heat for about 4 minutes on each side.  The second time I made this, I used fresh rosemary - what a difference it made!  I think I'll omit the lemon from the olive oil drizzle - was too lemony, and it overpowered the fresh rosemary.  I served this with "Couscous with Mushrooms and Sun-Dried Tomatoes" from this site, and they really went well together. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I used the broiler instead of grilling it.  I bought high quality swordfish, from a fish store, not a grocery store.

This recipe was great! This was the first time I've ever cooked or eaten swordfish.  The flavor was wonderful and the texture was different from what I expected-a nice surprise. Can't wait to have this again!

I made this with ahi tuna instead of swordfish because that was what I had on hand.  You must marinate this longer than the recipe calls for.  Otherwise, you just won't get that great wine/rosemary taste.

Was my first with swordfish.  I probably would've added more rosemary and possibly some basil.  It's also a little dry, though I'm guessing that's the fish.

The marinade didn't add any real flavour - this is the first time I made swordfish where it had a very strong fishy taste.

I am rating this a 4 instead of 5 only because I agree with other reviewers that 1 hour marinating time is not nearly long enough, and the fish can use an extra "kick" of flavor. I poked the steaks with a fork before marinating and left them in for 6 hours, and served "Tiger Sauce" (a brand of condiment) at the table. The steaks were very good at serving, but with a little Tiger Sauce, they were incredible! Next I will add some to the marinade.

I enjoyed the flavor of the swordfish but it wasn't the greatest.  The swordfish itself came out very well and I'm not too familiar with fish recipes so I was happy with the results of this one.  The lemon sauce gave the fish a nice taste but overall the meal was nothing I'd cook again.  I don't really like fish too much so maybe that's a reason for me not wanting to cook this again.  I can't complain about the recipe yet I was expecting a little more.

This was very good.  I took about 1/2 the marinade added about a TBS of butter and used that for the sauce.  It was delicious!!!

Delicious!  My family's very first swordfish and what a hit!  I will make this again and again.  Also my first time cooking with Rosemary. I seasoned the swordfish steaks with light salt, pepper and seafood magic seasoning.  I added about 2 tablespoons of Low Sodium soy sauce and 1 Tbsp of lemon juice to the marinade and marinated for about an hour.  Then, since I don't have a grill, I poured the marinade over the top and baked at 400 for about 15 minutes, then turned over, added the lemon, olive oil, rosemary sauce, and baked for another 15 minutes.  Then I broiled for about 3 minutes just to brown the top a tiny bit.  Not only was it delicious, but my house smelled wonderful while it was cooking.  Served with long grain and wild rice and side salad.

Fantastic! Used 'Dry' RoseMary, but did everything else the same. Only let it marinade for about 40-minutes. Put a little olive oil in skillet and cooked on Medium heat 4-mins on each side. Put the 'Garlic' from the marinade in the skillet and let it get golden brown.  I also added a touch of fresh ground Pepper to the LemonMixture & whisked to a light-lemony color.  FRESH Lemon & Garlic are the key to this great marinade.  THANKS

I was very excited to try this new recipe for Swordfish.  I don't know what I did wrong (as I followed the recipe to a T); however, it was bland and horrible.  Maybe my Swordfish steaks were too thick - but this absolutely did not work for me.

Marinade was simple and had good flavor.  I think it should marinade a bit longer than 1 hour though.  I served this with a bit of soy sauce all over cous cous.  The meal was fantastic for the summer.

Thanks!

I tried this recipe tonight and it was very good.  My husband is not a fan of fish, but really enjoyed it.  I only marinated the fish about an hour and I added grated lime peel.  I didn't have any lemon  so I made a sauce of hot melted butter, rosemary & lime.

I was honestly skeptical of this recipe...I have never had rosemary and fish. But this was a very delicious meal. Flavors were simple, but combined very well. It got rave reviews from my guests and I loved it too! I accidentally added more rosemary than called for, but turned out great!

Delicious marinade. I left the swordfish steaks in the freezer too long, they were a little tough. But the recipe for the sauce was very nice and light so it wasn't too fishy, very tasty.

Go ahead, just do it. This is the best recipe ever. Make it exactly as stated - just make sure that you have fresh swordfish. This dish would cost $35.00 a plate in a nice restaurant and you can make it at home for 1/4 of that. Thanks for sharing this one!!

This was just okay for us.  The flavor was good, but nothing special.  Like the description says, it's a very simple marinade.  Definitely easy to make & prepare though.

This recipe came out very well, overall. I definitely recommend taking the advice of others here and marinating it for as long as possible. I think swordfish is the kind of fish that's best when it has a very mild "fish taste." I marinated mine for 3 to 4 hours, and think it still could have used a few more. Also, I got supermarket swordfish in a package, which is never as good as fresh. But, far easier to obtain! I added lots of rosemary and garlic to my marinade - didn't measure, just stopped when it looked like it had enough. Let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours, and then cooked it in a frying pan on medium heat. It was the middle of winter, so grilling wasn't exactly something I felt like doing. I used non-stick spray, in addition to olive oil in the pan, and also threw in quite a bit of rosemary, along with white wine, something that couldn't have been done on a grill. The flavor of the seasonings/spices was great, I just wish I had soaked it longer so it had a more subtle fish flavor.

Absolutely delicious!  I went ahead and added the olive oil mixture to my baking dish and baked my swordfish at 350 for 20-23 minutes and flipped it halfway.  It was my husband's first time eating swordfish and he loved it!  I also only used 2 cloves of garlic because he doesn't like garlic quite as much as I do.  It was still plenty garlicky!

This is our family's favorite swordfish recipe, but you do have to marinate longer than what recipe calls for to get the flavor of the marinade. Excellent recipe!!!

I don't mean to sound surprised, but I am -- this was good!  I'm not a big fish fan, but felt like some fish.  We didn't get to marinade for as long as we would have liked (only an hour or so), then out it on the grill -- it was great!

We really liked this marianade and sauce.  I used ahi (yellowfin tuna) because I didn't have any swordfish in my freezer.  Ahi worked well with the rosemary.  I added about 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar to the sauce as someone else reccommended.  Unfortunately the fish overcooked a bit but that was my fault.  We will make this again probably with swordfish next time.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I made it for Valentines dinner.  I suggest to those who used thicker steaks to poke holes in it using a fork so the wine and rosemary thoroughly marinate the fish.  Use fresh rosemary, it makes a difference and it doesn't cost a lot.  Also, for those who have thicker steaks don't forget to add to or subtract the ingredients to make it taste right.  Use common sense!

I used shark steaks instead of swordfish, and dried rosemary (a lot) and cooked it on the stove... and my boyfriend and i loved it! The thing that really "made" it is the side dish to set it off: "Brocolli with Lemon Almond Butter" that's on this site. A perfet combination of flavors - if you like lemon!

This was SOOOOO tasty and juicy! Grilled it after marinating for about 1 1/2 hours. My husband and I really enjoyed it, served with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. The leftovers made a great addition to a dinner salad, drizzled with a little Italian dressing. Yummy!!!!!!!

I cooked this swordfish on my George Foreman grill.  I love rosemary, so, I broke two sprigs in half, and placed two pieces on each plate of the grill while the fish cooked.  The house smelled great, and the fish was excellent.  It only had to cook for 9 minutes.  I'm making it again, tonight!!!

Very savory dish! It probably helped that I prepared the swordfish the nite before so I had the fish marinating overnite (flipping it over from time to time) rather than an hour and used a little bit more white wine and rosemary than the recipe suggested...I recommend this way for future cooks of the recipe.

Our Swordfish was the catch of the day, locally caught.  We had not eaten this fish before and was by far our most favorite fish from our seafood selections of the day.  Our only additions were a bit of crushed red pepper for some heat and we used butter in place of the olive oil.  Fantastic! We grilled the steaks on some foil and had no issues with sticking to the grill.  I can not wait for our next trip to make this again!

I want to give it one star, but don't think that's fair as I am thinking I just must not like swordfish. We eat a lot of fish in this house, but this was my first attempt at swordfish. I marinated it in the morning prior to leaving for work, so it had a good 8 hours and was still very bland to me.

This recipe has FINALLY let me cook swordfish at home, that tastes restaurant quality!  I followed recipe exact, let it marinade for about 4 hours, and cooked it on my George Foreman grill for 10 minutes.  It didn't even need the sauce. It was moist and perfect. Thank you for this recipe!

This was absolutely delicious.  My husband wasn't to sure about trying a marinade on swordfish because he likes the taste of swordfish by itself but he was won over by this marinade.  I followed the recipe exactly except I marinaded it for 3 1/2 hours and poked the fish to help absorb it better.  I boiled the remaining marinade and basted the fish while on grill.  Hubby used some of it as well and dipped his fish in it at the table.  Defintely going to be using this recipe again.  Thanks for submitting it.

This was alright. It probably would have been better with fresh rosemary, no doubt. I took another reviewers suggestion to add balsamic vinegar, and I wasn't sure if that was such a good idea. I also added fresh lemon juice to the marinade. I also did it in the broiler, and I bet the marinade tastes better when grilled. The fish did come out nicely, however - if I make this again I will probably stick to the recipe and not futz around like I'm always inclined to do!

Delicious!  In the past I've used Italian dressing as a marinade but wanted to try something different.  I'm very pleased I tried this one!

Great recipe! As a couple of others said I used dried rosemary, as it was all I had. I have to admit after makung the olive oil sauce I forgot to serve it. Honestly, with this awesome marinade you don't need it.

This was really good. Marinated it for only an hour because I was short on time. Broiled the fish and followed a reviewer's suggestion to add butter and make a sauce out of the marinade (at which point, I added more fresh rosemary). I wouldn't cook this for more than 7 or 8 minutes unless you have a very thick steak. Will definitely make again and maybe spice it up a bit.

Very good!  The only reason I'm rating it 4 stars is because i didn't let the fish marinate long enough, which was my fault,  but the flavor was great.  Next time i will marinate them for a few hours - I bet it will be amazing!

This was a good marinade! I took the advice of others and didn't make the lemon sauce but mixed it al together and marinated for one hour. i agree that you need to let it marinate for a much longer amount of time for the flavors to infuse the fish. I will def make this again.

I was looking for a light, tasty sauce for swordfish.  This one is wonderful.  I marinated one hour on each side, then grilled the fish on the Weber.  It was awesome.

Hi, I made this last nite and it was great. I the cook enjoyed it, and so did the tribe. I was conservative with grilling time; 10 minutes. 15 minutes would probably have been better on a 2 burner gas grill, but I wanted to taste the marinade, not the carbon, and it was tangy. My grill is subject to wind conditions so it's always a guess! Thank you Carlosa!

This recipe was pretty good.  Not amazing, but very simple to do.  I marinated it for 2 hours, so I can't whether 1 hour would have been enough.  But 2 certainly is.

I thought this was okay but not great.  I used dried rosemary but fresh would definitely be better.  I would try dill maybe next time and a little olive oil in the marinade.

I made the recipe just as is except marinaded in a plastic bag for about 3 hours so the marinade covered the fish completely.  The fish was amazing.  Super taste through out and moist even when done. Everyone loved it.  My picky 11 year old ate it right up.

I tried this recipe with Mahi Mahi since that's what I had on hand- the mix of flavors was really delicious (and didn't require any special ingredients).  I ended up marinating it for about 3 hours and cooked it in a grill pan. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious! I don't know why but I never thought to mix rosemary with fish...Really easy and quick too. I let it marinate for a full hour but I bet you wouldn't need to if you were in a rush - the sauce that you pour on afterwards is tasty enough.

I thought this was good but not great. Ultimately, I couldn't taste the wine or even the rosemary flavoring very well. All I could really taste was the lemon dressing.

I Love swordfish!  Delicious and light!  I baked in the oven instead of on the grill.  Place the fish on a raised rack in a baking pan and both sides get crispy.

Excellent flavour & texture!  I followed the recipe, except I left out the salt.  Used a plastic zipper bag for marinating with white wine, minced garlic, dried rosemary and black pepper. Ccoked on the griddle for 10 minutes at medium heat (325) and it was perfect!  Will definitely make this again.

This was OK.  I think the "sauce" could use something else, it just seemed like it was lacking something.  The marinade was not bad, though.

Baked at 400 for 15 min, then turned and put sauce (lemon, oil and rosemary) on top and baked for 5 more then broiled it for 3 min to crisp it.  It was a bit overdone and tough.  I'd marinate for longer,  I only did 2 hours.  I could taste the rosemary but not the garlic.  Put garlic in the marinade for the last 3 min would help.

Really good; rave reviews from the family.  I gave the recipe and quick glance and assumed all the ingredients were the marinade...had it marinading in the fridge before I realized there was to be a separate sauce. Anyway turned out delish so will keep doing it this way!  I melted about a tablespoon of butter after frying the fish and added the marinade, then topped the fish with it.  YUM.

I loved this recipe! It was a tiny bit bland first time but the addition of some lemon zest to the wine and old bay prior to grilling fixed that. Also, our steaks were pretty hearty and each side needed a minimum of six minutes if you want it done all the way through. I grilled mine in a grill basket. I've made it twice now and my husband loves it! I struggle to get him to eat fish so I'm glad to find it!

I made this for the first time last night and received rave reviews and multiple requests for the recipe. I used fresh swordfish from a market, fresh rosemary, chardonnay (of course used some of the wine I was enjoying when making the marinade :) ) , and let it marinade overnight and it was awesome. This was actually the first time I ever grilled swordfish. I will definitely make this again!

Very good - used splash of balasamic vinegar as someone else suggested. Would highly recommend marinating 6+ hours for the fish to really absorb flavor. Will make again!

Just the right touch of flavor! My husband liked the time recommended for the grill, since we don't grill much fish. It was cooked perfectly. I added the grated zest of half a lemon to the olive oil/lemon sauce and it made the dish just sing. We are garlic lovers, but others might want just a bit less of the raw garlic in the marinade. Thanks for a dinner treat. Our guests raved about it.

This was great! Great flavor, great consistency! My first venture with swordfish on the grill. Always afraid it would come out too dry.Didn't make the separate lemon sauce. Instead put all the ingredients in the marinade. Marinated for 2 hrs in sealable plastic bag and discarded marinade. Basted the swordfish with additional olive oil on both sides while grilling to prevent its drying out. Served with additional lemon juice on the side for those who so desired. Final note: use only FRESH swordfish. Previously frozen doesn't cut it! Thanks to CARLOSA for a wonderful treat. Will do this again and again.

I made this recipe for my grandfather and my boyfriend. The three of us liked the recipe it was good. Not the best thing ever but it was good. Only thing I added was a little bit of parsley. Next time I will let the swordfish marinate at least a half an hour longer.

I marinated the fresh swordfish for about 2 1/2 hours, but I didn't make the sauce. Ordinarily, both my husband and I like swordfish a lot. This recipe was uninspiring and bland - my husband really disliked it. I thought it was ok at best. Definitely won't be making this again!

This is definitely an 8 hour plus marinade. Rounded down from a "4.5" rating as it needed a bit of help to infuse the flesh w/ flavor, but the choices and ratios require no adjustment. I ground fresh rosemary to use in the marinade and used slightly more garlic. Also gently, but thoroughly, pierced the flesh to a depth of about 3/8" on both sides before marinating. The steaks were fabulous with plenty of flavor. I served this with a dill-yogurt side sauce, an escarole salad and some grilled ears of corn. My wife says I spoil her, but I think she deserves it.

i would have given this three stars, and my husband said five, so we compromised. it was oooookay....but really the lemon "sauce" was kind of overpowering. which surprised me coz swordfish is fishy! but it didnt do much for me. i think it was just tooooo liquidy for a sauce. it would be better if it was thickened into a glaze.   made with asparagus and baby red potatoes.

Awesome!  marinated the swordfish steaks at least two hours in the wine, extra garlic and dried Rosemary b/c I didn't have fresh.  I poked the steaks with a fork several times to get the flavor in them.  Husband grilled and they were the most moist delicious swordfish steaks we've eaten and we've had plenty of them! This is a keeper! UPDATE 7/6/07: Made this again but used some fresh Sturgeon a friend gave us and it wasn't quite as good as the swordfish was.  it was much more tough but then I think that is standard for Sturgeon anyhow.  The lemon sauce on top was tastey though.

Fabulous recipe--very easy and tastes great! I agree with another reviewer that you can stand to cut back on the rosemary a bit, especially if you are using dried instead of fresh. I also put it under a broiler instead of a grill, and the results were perfect!

I had to substitute salmon fillets in a pinch, and broiled them at 500 degrees for 6 minutes, instead of grilling them, but they also turned out to be excellent.  Very flavorful and moist.

I used the recipe for sea bass.  It was excellent.  My wife and daughter did not like the texture of sea bass, but the flavor was great!
