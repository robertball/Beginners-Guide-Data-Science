okay, I just watched the video of chef john making this but I swear he just used 16oz of flour to make 4 pizzas.  This calls for 4 cups or 32 oz of flour and says it makes 4 pizzas so I'm confused.  I will make it tomorrow then come back and update my review after I figure out what the hey is going on.

This dough is pretty good but it really needs more like 3 1/2 cups flour.  If you watch the video Chef John weighs the flour - 16 oz - which equates to closer to 3 1/2 cups rather than 3 cups.  I made the dough the night before - let it sit until the next afternoon - I made pizza for the kids when they came home from school.  They love pizza and this was no exception.

This recipe reminds me of the artisan bread in five minutes a day recipe  I found on the NY Times website. The bread recipe is made in an ice cream bucket and does not have olive oil, otherwise it is a similar recipe and my favorite bread EVER!

I use all the same ingredients, but I make it much less complicated.I just mix the wet and dry ingredients separately, then mix.I roll it out and add a little flour as needed to roll it then bake at 400 for 20 mins.Simple!

I think you pretty much "nailed-it " on this thin crust pizza recipe.I've subsequently tried six other thin crust recipes from this website,and this beats them all. I have two suggestions though.One is that I think the yield should be 3 pizzas,with a little left over.You have to stretch the dough so far in a 9" pan that there is only a 1/2 crust.Secondly I found by increasing the cooking time on the bottom shelf to 6 or 7 minutes really crisps the bottom up.(Without a pizza stone my oven doesnt get hot enough).Otherwise this crust is perfect. Now if I could only find a thick crust pizza recipe that was this good,but that is a whole different animal.

I was a little leery about leaving this out all nite. Whipped up a batch of this dough last nite & made a pizza this morning. Turned out Jawsome.
the only thing I did differently was to poke holes in the dough up to an inch around the edge. Keeps the center from rising

Great pizza crust. I cut this in half and only made 1 pizza that we cooked on the grill. I only let mine rise for 3 hours as it was almost doubled from the heat in the garage. Other than outside with the dog I wasn't sure where to get a constant 85-90* temp. So from now on this will be known as the "garage pizza" at our house. I didn't have any trouble with the flour/water ratios like it seems others had. I didn't have whole wheat flour. I did use double the yeast because I forgot to scale that down with the rest. I can't possibly imagine this taking 18 hours to prepare. We wanted it today so I had to just make it do. The flavor was like a yeast roll and very good tasted like white bread only not sweet. I'll fix this again as it was perfect for our pizza on the grill experiment. This is the first time we actually got one to turn out and I think the dough is a factor in that. Thanks Chef John even if I did modify it a little.

This recipe was excellent!  When baking it's important to weigh the flour.  If you don't have a food scale, the texture of the dough will tell you if you've added too much flour.

So easy! pretty I like a crispy crust so rolled it pretty thin. Any size dough ball(s) depending on pizza size. I made 4 & froze the one's we didn't use. Waited to write the review until we'd used up the frozen dough too. Put in fridge overnight to thaw,
came out great!

I made this recipe using the amounts as stated cup-wise.  It needed what seemed like quite a bit more flour added later to make it manageable for me.  I'm not a pro at the pizza dough or anything, but it was way sticky for me to even handle with only 3 cups regular flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat.  After managing the sticky factor everything else went pretty well.  Next time I anticipate a faster process since I will add just a bit more flour to the recipe in the beginning.  My husband and the kids really enjoyed it, although I did burn the cheese on the first one- according to my daughter-since I didn't check it soon enough.

I tried this, and it turned out pretty good. You definitely need more flour, and the rise time??? Definitely shorter. I let it rise for an hour or two, then worked it. turned out fine.

Wonderful Recipe! I made a pizza with one recipe of this pizza dough and took it to my friend's baby's 1st birthday party; it was the first time I had ever made pizza. I brought the empty pan home after the party was over! Thank you Chef John.

The following are the changes I made to perfect this recipe - I used 1/4 cup of wheat flour & 3 3/4 cups of all-purpose flour (instead of 3 cups as recipe states).  I let rise as instructed but instead of 18 hours (as recipe states), I covered it with saran wrap & let rise in my oven with the light on for 6 hours (turning every couple hours to make sure both sides of bowl got ample heat). The first time I made this recipe I let rise for 18 hours (covered & placed in oven with light on) & it smelled foul...lol. I put the extra 3 balls of dough in the refrigerator & made a fresh pizza with the last one.  When I cooked this pizza I cooked on the bottom rack for 8 minutes & then moved it up one rack for the last 10-13 minutes on 500 degrees since my oven wouldn't heat past 500...lol.  Other than these changes I followed the directions as stated. The second time around I was successful with these changes.  I hope this helps someone!

Has anyone tried this recipe using a pizza stone? I'm wondering about the baking instructions if a stone is used instead of a metal pan. Would love some feedback.

I have tried so many pizza crusts and never a 5 star!! This is by far the best pizza crust!! I didn't use wheat flour just added added another 1/4 cup of reg. flour!! I also used fast rising yeast!! 18 hours is way too long for me!! Within 4-5 hours dough doubled and was amazing!!! Will never use anothe recipe for crust

Absolutely the best!!! The only things i changed was i added just a pinch more salt, it makes it so flavorful! Then i just used regular flour at 3 1/2 cups. Second time making it and it took less than five minutes to whip it up before letting it sit for an hour. NO NEED to mix the water and yeast separately. Mix all the dry ingredients then the oil and warm water.  I didnt make three seperate pizzas i made one rectangle pizza. Once you roll out your shape of your pizza, use a fork to poke holes in it. Bake for about five minutes, THEN put your toppings on it and continue to bake. Nice and fluffy crust, better than pizza restaurants!!!
*i let it sit for hour instead of eighteen.

This recipe is so easy! I made this by measuring by weight, not cups - 2 oz. WW flour and 16 oz. AP flour. The dough is a bit sticky but it rolled out well and I didn't have any problems with it. My family loved the pizza (sausage and peppers) and has asked me to make this again soon.

18 hours is over the limit for fermentation. I followed the directions to a T, including the unheard of 18 hour rising time and wound up with a foul smelling, gooey mess the consistency of gum stuck to the bottom of your shoe on a 95 degree day.  It couldn't rise up any higher and turned out like a raw foccacia.

Really good tasting dough but it turned out to be really stiff and hard to roll out thinly. I only got two 9" pizzas out of the recipe (that is the reason why I did not give it 5 stars). I added a bit of garlic powder and onion powder to the dough, which really gave it a nice flavor to it. Will be making this again!

A family favorite.  Whenever the in-laws drop in they always ask for pizza.  I always use Chef John's recipe and get rave reviews. Thanks Chef John!

Just amazing. The crust and the way of cooking on very high temperature made it the right crunchy crust, yet tender from inside

I don't think I've EVER been so profoundly disappointed by a recipe before. Chef John's stuff is usually pretty good, but this came out as a gooey, sticky, unworkable mess. I managed, with some effort, to get it mostly scraped off the pastry mat and into the garbage.  

There's a reason most pizza dough recipes call for kneading. Now I have utterly graphic proof of why that's so. Yecch!

Best pizza I've had. This is the first time I've seen a recipe that requires the dough to sit for 18 hours but surprisingly it still rises after that long. I just let the dough sit overnight.

Delicious.  Just don't freak out when you get to "let rise 18h".  I did 3, great texture and lofty rise anyway
