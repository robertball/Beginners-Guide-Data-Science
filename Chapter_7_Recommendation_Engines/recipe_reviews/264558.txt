Made this recipe pretty much as written except used minced candied orange peel instead of zest   This recipe makes a well balanced and fine tasting jam that goes very well with cheese and crackers.  Serve it with a cheese plate for  an appetizer, dessert or even a fancy snack!  Lots of compliments from guests who tried this!
