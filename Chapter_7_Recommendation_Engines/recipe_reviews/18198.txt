My family loved this recipe!  I did make one small change, which was rather than 3/4 t of nutmeg, I used 1/4 t nutmeg and 1/2 t cinammon.  I will definitely use this receipe over and over again.

I made this pie yesterday for my father in law. I have never made nor tried SCR Pie before so I was going in it blind. I followed the recipe to the tea. I was a little disappointed that my meringue "shrunk". But I was going to leave the taste up to dad. (who I should say that has LOVED SCR pie since he was very very little, and his mom's was his FAV!!! Anyway, lets just say that my SCR Pie (this recipe) was just as good IF NOT BETTER then the one that his sister makes (who she was taught by my in laws mom!!!) WOW that was a wonderful compliment!!! So all in all I was very very happy that he loved this recipe and I am glad I went with it!!!

Wow! Best raisin cream pie ever.  The custard is rich and creamy, but not overly sweet, and the delicate brown sugar meringue looks beautiful. My guests loved it and even my son, who said he didn't like sour cream raisin pie, came back for seconds.

My 99 year-old Grandma requested this pie as she remembers it from her days working for the Soo Line railroad in the 1920's.  The rest of the family was suspicious because the combination of ingredients seemed so unfamiliar.  Everyone was very pleasantly surprised by the wonderful, complex flavor. Very easy to make, the pie had the consistency of other cream pies e.g. Banana Cream, Coconut Cream. I had thought of leaving off the meringue, but that would have been a mistake-the brown sugar added a warm flavor note to offset the tang.  My modifications: I reduced sugar to 3/4C(just because) and raisins to 3/4C.

The filling on this pie sets up beautifully so A+ there. Also, meringue seemed like a weird topping for this pie but I decided to try it and it actually really balances out the tartness of the pie. Plus, since it's a brown sugar meringue it smells absolutely divine!  I'm giving this recipe 4 stars since I knew beforehand that the nutmeg called for would likely overpower the pie. I reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. and added 1/4 tsp. each of ground cloves and cinnamon. Perfect!

I make a pie for my dad once a month and he requested a raisin cream pie.  I used this recipe and he LOVED it!  He said it reminded him of the same kind of pie his mom made (and she was an awesome cook).  The best thing was that even though it was a little time consuming, it was easy, inexpensive, and did not require hard-to-find ingredients.

This recipie was very good.  There was not a scrap left by the end of the night.  For spices, I used 1tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and a 1/4 tsp of cloves.  I didn't have any cream of tarter for the merigune and it still turned out fine.

I've never made a custard type pie before but this turned out really good. The only change i made was to add some cinnamin. My husbands favorite pie is Sour Cream and Raisin and he loved it. I had never had this kind of pie and thought it sounded nasty but I really did like it.

I've used this recipe at Christmas time for years. It's a family favorite from one generation to the next. If I dare to suggest I won't be making it I hear a collective outcry!

I love making this pie, it was my fathers favorite!! Since i was a teenager i did my best at making this for him as much as i could but sometimes it didnt turn out, but my dad was always happy and told me i did a wonderful job, even if it came out runny. Now as a mother i make this pie for every holiday avent and just to have once and awhile, the whole family loves it. When i make it to take to famiy functions its the first pie to be gone and alot of the time no one has ever heard of it and sometimes turns up their nose at it i guess just from the name of it but its all different once they taste it. This is a great recipe i have tried others to try and come close to the one my father would have when he was a child but he said this one was the closest to his moms recipe, and let me say its taken years to find that. 
also for people making this for the first time remember to prebake the pie crust its a important step...in my younger years trying to make this i couldnt figure out the crust, prebaking was the key!! enjoy this pie its a great thing to make and a wonderful thing to eat... this will always be my dads pie and my whole family will always think of him for the wonderful daddy, grandpa he was...06/19/2012 my dad will be very much missed and this pie will always bring good thoughts into our hearts.

**Update - with my modifications, I've upped the stars to 4. It's a great base pie recipe, much better than many you'll find online. Just taste and adjust, if you find it necessary, before cooling. 

Prior to a Easter I had never heard of this pie, but made it upon special request. I was told it was delicious, but the reason for 3 stars was I had to make a few modifications. In my opinion, the meringue on the pie (as stated) was horrible and flat. I substituted a 'regular' meringue recipe and it was great. Also, I added 1 cup sugar and 1/3t. cinnamon because the nutmeg overpowered the custard. Touch of salt and it was good.

I must disagree with other reviewers who said this wasn't too sweet.  It's quite sweet and rich.  Too many raisins, too.  Maybe 1 cup would be enough.  Not the sour cream raisin pie recipe I'm seeking...

Made this pie yesterday, never made meringue before. I researched it on the internet so I'd know what to do...it was perfect. It turned out good and very decadent. Thank you for sharing your recipe here with us.

This was good, but if i were to make it again i would really reduce the sugar amount. It was way too sweet for my taste (and i have a sweet tooth.) But it was easy to make and turned out well. Best when eaten cold!!

SO good! My family thought I was weird for making this old lady pie, but I loved eating it with my great aunt and wanted to share it with my family. They loved it too! You can't find it in restaurants, so I'm glad I found such a great recipe =) 
I considered soaking the raisins in rum or something... must try next time.

This is my husband's favorite pie, so I am always looking for a truly good/easy to make recipe.  My search has ended.  It wasq quickly made with ingredients already in my kitchen (okay, I didn't make my own pie crust!).  And, best of all my husband loved it!  Custard smooth, rich, wth just the right amout of sweetness.  I did soak my raisins for an hour or so just to plump them up, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Good, but VERY sweet. I didn't grow up with this as many reviewers did, so it wasn't exactly to my taste, but I can see how others would love it.

The custard is absolutely delicious, especially if you love nutmeg. However the pie all together is much too sweet. I couldn’t even finish one slice! I am going to try reducing the sugar in the meringue as well as cutting the raisins down to ¾ a cup. I hope this helps cut the sweetness enough because it has potential of becoming one of my favorite pies!

Unfortunately I did not like this pie.  It is very sweet, had too many raisins, and the custard was not appealing at all for my taste.    It was very easy to make and the brown sugar meringue is something to keep in mind for other recipes.

WONDERFUL!!! It set up perfectly and was very impressive as I made two to take to church. I would, however, make a double batch of the meringue, as I like lots of it. The brown sugar meringue was a big hit as well.

Very simple to follow. I'd suggest only 5-7 minutes in the oven to golden the top. Mine was in for about 8-9 and got a little to brown for my liking but I'm sure it'll taste fabulous!!

Wonderful and so easy. I did split cinnamon and the nutmeg. I will omit the lemon juice though. It lends too much tartness for the taste I was looking for. Save this one for sure. Oh, I also replaced the meringue for real whipped cream. Yumm!!

This recipe was easy to use and turned out great but I substituted 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg instead of all that nutmeg. I was disappointed with the amount of filling it made. It only filled my crust 1/2 full. It would have been much more impressive with a full crust so the merigue stood up higher. Otherwise it was great! My sisters thought my mother had made it- a huge compliment!

I must of done something wrong because this really wasn't good.  I made it for my husband's birthday because always has been his favorite.  My father-in-law thought that I bought it and said it was awful!  He was so emberassed when he found out I made it!  I feel like I followed the recipe exactly...not sure what went wrong.  Just didn't taste good.

Delicious, but a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll cut the sugar back a little. The meringue was better than any I've ever made. I'll use this recipe for all my merengue pies. Great recipe!

It was a bit too tart for my taste, and the filling overpowered the meringue.  Interestingly, it tasted almost like carrot cake.  My husband really liked it though, he would give it four stars.

This pie is so delicious. My in-laws favorite. Because I'm not a meringue fan, I made it with a top crust brushed with egg and sprinkled with sugar. I will be making this every Thanksgiving from now on.

Very good, but definitely too much nutmeg.  I cut the amount back to 1/2 tsp, and next time I would cut it back to 1/4 tsp. The brown sugar meringue was attractive and very tasty, much nicer than regular meringue.

The recipe was crazy good. I was very pleased by the taste and how fluffy the meringue turned out. I am not a huge fan of raisins but this was a big hit in our house!

I made this yesterday for a dinner party. I remembered sour cream raisin pie from my childhood visits to my aunt's farm in Nebraska. This recipe is very similar to hers. I like a generous meringue, so I added an extra egg white and increase the brown sugar accordingly. It is a very rich pie, so I don't think I will make it again soon, but I will cetainly keep it in my file for future use.

I was so excited after reading all the reviews, but I found the pie to have a sour "bite" to it.  I think next time I may try it without the lemon juice (not sure if this will affect the setting process as it cools, but will try it). I did use only 1/4 t nutmeg.  I think the pie would be awesome if it were not so tangy.  Possibly the person who used the yogurt had the right idea!

Couldn't find my long used recipe so tried this one.   I did use the cinnamon/nutmeg combo recommended but also added 1 tsp baking soda and stirring well just before pouring into crust.  It fluffs up the filling which helps to lighten up the richness.  My husband offered $50 to keep it at home rather than taking it to a pie sale.  I took his cash and donated IT to the charity.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Very good.  Next time, would probably soak raisins in rum or brandy and half sugar.  Otherwise, awesome.

I did not care for this pie at all, but my Dad really liked it.  Maybe it is an acquired taste.  I thought it was too "spicy", and way too sweet.

This pie is wonderful! I did not have enough sour cream, so I made up the difference with sweet cream - nice flavor. I also used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. each cloves and nutmeg. I added 1/2 chopped pecans, as well. The meringue is the best I have ever made. I recomended this pie to a friend of mine that does professional baking. A keeper.

This recipe was good but I found it very sweet.  I will make it again but I will use less sugar. I also didn't have  1.5 cups of sour cream so I used 1/2 cup of fat free vanilla yogurt - perhaps this is the reason it was too sweet??  It would taste really good with a graham wafer crust.  I also used 1/2 of craisins because I didn't have the full amount of raisins.

I used to make this pie frequently for my husband, as it is one of his favorite.  Then I lost the recipe I was using, and haven't thought of making it for a while.  Made this recipe as written except for reducing the nutmeg and adding cinnamon.  It turned out great, and will be my go to recipe in the future.  My husband is happy again!

This is so good!! The first time I heard of a sour cream raisin pie is when we lived in the Ozarks and an acquired friend of mine made it. I remember thinking that it sounded interesting but I do not remember trying it. When I saw this recipe it brought that time back to mind and I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did!! The only thing I changed was cinnamon for nutmeg simply because my husband does not care for nutmeg. Since I don't feel like that altered the recipe I gave it five stars.

Made it for my father in law for his birthday and he loved it.  Almost LIKE his mom used to make.  Cut the sugar to 1 cup.  Split the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Was wondering if I could bake this instead of putting it on top of the stove:  Apparently, that's the way his mom used to make it.
