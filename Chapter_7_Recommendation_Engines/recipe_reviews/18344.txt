I made these a few weeks ago and my hubby and I loved them.  Today I wanted a single serving and didn't want to heat the oven to bake just one potato.  I sliced one russet potato thinly and fried in a skillet (with butter) for about 5-7 minutes until they were tender and browned, then put the toppings on and covered the skillet for about 2 minutes until the cheese melted.  They were perfect and saved a lot of time and I didn't have to heat up the house with the oven.

these were really good and simple to make, the only thing i would do different is make sure that the sheet that i cook them on is well greased with butter, i found that they stuck to it and i would salt the potaotes to give more flavor.  but deffinitely a keeper

Ohh,sooo good! My son wanted skins for dinner but I was short on time and made these instead.To cut back on time and mess ,I melted butter in very small pan with 1/8 tsp. garlic powder. Tossed potatoe slices to coat. So much quicker than brushing. I used 4 medium white potatoes(I think any would do.)I baked 30min. Then topped with cheese and Oscar Mayer's real bacon bits in bag. Put back in oven about 2 min. more until melted. Watch, don't over bake. I will never go back to making the old fashioned skins again!! Thanks Michele!!

First I have to say - I had to try this recipe after I was disappointed by a similar appetizer at Smokey Bones restaurant.  

Wow... this recipe went above and beyond my expectations.  And so easy to make as well!  I was afraid they would be sub par since they are not fried but that was not the case.  Much better than any standard potato skin I've had in a restaurant as well.

I salt & peppered the potato slices before baking, and omitted the green onions because they just aren't for us.  I turned the oven off when I pulled the slices out to top them, the retained heat in the oven was adequate to melt the cheese.  

Just be careful not to slice them to thin - I had a couple that were much thinner than the rest turn into blackened potato chips!

YUMMY!! These were great. I'm not sure what is wrong with me, but I can never follow a recipe. I made just a few minor changes, I cut the potatoes, threw them into a bowl and tossed with just enough olive oil to coat. I also threw in the standard salt and pepper, but also added some dry ranch dressing mix for some added zip. I took the advice of other's by topping the spuds with sour cream before adding the cheese and bacon bits. They were so good, but what's not to love with ingredients like this? Thanks so much for a recipes that has already become a favorite in my house.

So simple and so delicious!! I spray the potato slices with a little butter-flavored Pam for convenience, and to cut down on calories. The only things I change are to add some seasoning - salt and pepper, and a little garlic powder. Also, I mix the bacon, cheese and onion with a little Ranch dressing so it is easier to spoon over the spuds. These are my standard pot luck contribution, and they are always appeciated. Thanks so much, Michele!

These potatoes are absolutely wonderful -- made in my house at least once a week.  They are definitely a double for potato skins without alot of skin -- even better for kids.  I dip the potatoes into the butter - not quite as messy as brushing it on and also takes alot less time.  I also used the prepared bacon bits as recommended in a review - takes very little time.  Thanks !!

Delicious and super easy! I cooked mine on a cookie cooling rack so I didn't have to flip them. Doing this also keeps the potato rounds from sitting in all that butter while cooking. I cooked my bacon in the oven (400 for 13 mins on a cookie cooling rack) before I started to make everything.

Awesome. Sprinkled with a little salt and pepper while baking. Added a little parsley flakes and some garlic powder to toppings. Definitely a keeper.

My husband loved these. I made a few changes though, I use half olive oil and half melted butter put in larger plastic bag, with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder shook them up and then placed on cookie racks placed on baking sheet with parchment paper on the bottom. Cooked 40 minutes and the mixed half cream cheese with chives, half shredded 4 cheese mexican cheese, and bacon together then put ontop of each slice and broiled until melted and slightly browned.

Instead of using onion, I added some onion salt just befor I put them in the oven.  When I asked my kids how many stars out of five they gave these potatoes , they said 10!!  I use my pampered chef stone and they crisped up beautifully.  Even my potato-hating eleven year old said this was a keeper!

The kids loved these. I think I'll need to experiment with this recipe some more. They came out just a little too crispy and some were burned. Possibly I cut the potatoes too thinly? I'll give it another shot because I'm sure it was my fault and this dish certainly has potential.

We call these "Irish Nachos" and we saute onions and chopped jalapenos together. We microwave "bake" the potatoes, slice them and place them on a baking sheet. Top them with the cooked veggies, cheese, and bacon bits. Cook in 350 degree oven until cheese is melted. Then serve with sour cream on the side. Yummy!

Oh my goodness- these were so yummy!  My meat and potato loving family devoured these!  
I used mixture of cooked bacon and bacon bits. Seasoned potatoes with a little seasoned salt, and used olive oil instead of butter.  
The only thing I recommend is that you spray your pan with a little Pam to avoid sticking and for an easier clean up.

These little guys are delish! Tastes like a potato skin without being fried. I seasoned mine with garlic salt, pepper and a dash of Lawrys. Topped with the cheese, bacon and green onions. Served sour cream and ranch dressing on the side. Good topped with hot sauce too! These are perfect for Superbowl parties! Men LOVE these things (ie my husband, father in law, brother)! If you are in a hurry, use bacon bits. Just as good and no messy bacon grease cleanup!

Good, but not great. Be careful not to brush too much butter/margarine onto the potatoes prior to baking; it might turn out greasy!

All cooks know that potatoes have absolutely no taste to them on their own, that's why they're so much fun to experiment with! To the folks that gave the recipe negative reviews, did you take into consideration gas oven as opposed to electric? What rack did you use? Lower or center? All those factors make a huge difference. With all the dietary restrictions, I can see why Michelle didn't tell you how much/little salt/pepper to add. This would definitely be a "to taste" recipe.

I have been making these for years but place the potatoes in the microwave, bake for 8 to 10 minutes.  Cool enough to handle then slice and place on greased cookie sheet.  Top with cheese, onion and bacon pieces and butter spray then pop in oven for a few minutes until cheese is melted.  Our family all love them.

So much easier than potato skins, what a great appetizer. My sons and their friends raved about them. I did melt light butter in a glass bowl and mixed the potatoes in that with some garlic powder instead of spreading the butter on each slice...much easier.

Easy recipe!  I sliced the potatoes about 1/4 of an inch and brushed both sides in melted BUTTER. Baked for about 25 minutes.  Removed from oven and  topped with the crumbled bacon, onion and parsley.  Tasted one - Definitely flat - I added a generous amount of Creole seasoning - made all the difference in the world!  Served with ranch dressing and sour cream.

These are great! Just make sure you cut them into 1/2 inch slices, Other wise they will be too crunchy.

Definitely delicious and definitely more simpler to make then regular potato skins. I could have eaten the slices just roasted in butter it was that good. Toss them in a bowl with melted butter vs. brushing them individually as another reviewer noted makes prep quicker!

Delicious! -and so easy. To make it even easier, I sliced the potatoes into a bowl, tossed with the melted butter and seasonings. I skipped the regular salt and onions, and seasoned with onion salt and onion powder. Before adding toppings, push the potatoes together (don't have to worry so much about aiming for each potato). I also used Oscar Meyer real bacon bits.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe as written and found it very good.  The next time I tried a few things suggested by other reviewers and the result was totally delicious.  Scrub and then 'bake' the potatoes in the microwave until just barely cooked...do not overcook at this stage or skin will get tough.  Let potatoes cool.  When cooled, slice potatoes, brush both sides with melted butter and place on baking sheet.  Sprinkle with seasoned salt and pepper.  Bake at 450 until lightly browned (took about 25 minutes in my oven).  Flip potatoes and add the grated cheese, crumbled bacon, bacon bits, and green onion.  Return to oven just until cheese is melted.  Best after cooling a little. Serve with sour cream.  My family loved them.

Okay, it's fattening, but very delicious!  We make a meal of it, and have coleslaw on the side.  I make sure the potatoes are nice and browned on both sides before putting anything on them.

Excllent potato skins!  They were a big hit for the gathering I took them to.  I did did some simple changes due to other suggestions...salt/pepper and brushed with bbq sauce as well as butter.  Yum, Yum, Yum.  Served with Ranch Dip.  Thanks for a simple and delish appy!

I made these last night and they were fantastic!  I did season the potato rounds with salt, pepper and some onion powder cause I didn't have fresh green onions.  my husband ate almost the entire batch!!  a great way to do potatoes a little differently!

Fantastic, simple recipe -- it achieves great results all on its own.  I did as someone else recommended and dipped the potatoes in butter rather than brush them.  Also I thoroughly spiced with salt and pepper.  After flipping once sprinkled with paprika.  Yum! Everyone at the party loved it.

These were very good.  Try adding some seasoning to the butter...we used seasoned salt, pepper and onion powder.  When finished baking, we topped the potatoes with small dollups of sour cream.  They were sooo good and cute too:)  Nice for serving at a casual get together.

Similar to potato skins and a good alternative if you don't want to be stuck with the scooped out flesh that you get with skins. I took a shortcut and used real bacon bits rather than going to the trouble of cooking bacon. These are quick, easy and delicious. We'll enjoy them again sometime.

These were a hit! I saw these on Pinterest and had to try them. Just like a baked potato with all the fixings. I baked mine on parchment so they wouldn't stick and it worked perfect. I seasoned my potatoes with garlic, salt and pepper too. I forgot to flip them, but that didn't matter, they came out great anyways. This is a keeper! See more at Mommy? I'm Hungry! food blog.

These were okay, but I wouldn't rave about them. The flavor wasn't outstanding, despite the fact that I added plenty of salt and pepper plus a little Tobasco. I also used a good sharp cheddar cheese. I also wouldn't call these a replacement for potato skins. If I wanted good skins I'd probably go and order them at a place where I know they make good bar food. Here at home I'd rather just make a baked potato and load it up with lots of trimmings.

These were a MAJOR hit with everyone.  I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and added a little Ranch Salad dressing to the cheese/bacon/onion mixture - made it easier to spoon onto the potatoes.  thanks for the amazing recipe!

I cut my potatoes a little thinner than called for, probabaly closer to 1/4 inch than 1/2 inch. They cooked a little faster that way, which was good, because my family couldn't wait to eat these.  They are similar to baked potato skins, but easier to make and eat.  We dipped in sour cream and they were great.  These make a great appetizer, or as a side - we had them with hamburgers.

These turned out fantastic! I made them for the side dish for my Chicken Cordon Bleu, also from this site. The whole meal went together so well. These crispy rounds were so delious. They are so versitile, you could put anything atop them. Since you have to fry and crumble the bacon, this recipe does take some time, but, I will certainly have these again. Maybe next time I prepare chicken cordon bleu, and that will be soon, for sure. Thanks for this side dish, Michele!

I'm mad as heck and I don't care who knows it!! I thought of this recipe on my own and have wanted to try it out and Michele O'Sullivan beat me to it!

What's not to like! There are lots of ways to vary this recipe, especially with the thickness of the potato and toppings. Peace, g.

These are extra delicious! I have followed the recipe exactly two times now and they come out perfect. The whole family asks for them. I even made them with the prexooked and crumbled bacon. I cant wait to do it with real baked bacon! Great with a little sour cream too.

These potato bites are excellent!  I serve with a dollup of sour cream or ranch dressing!  I usually bake them closer to 50 minutes to get them extra crispy.

I needed something easy and quick for an appetizer when my youngest son was home for Spring Break along with his fiance.  The next time I am going to do more rounds and offer a choice of cheeses, onions, bacon or ham or whatever is in the cupboard or fridge that sounds good.
This recipe also makes a great base for mini pizzas.  A little peperoni, mozzarella, onion, mushrooms, black olives, and on an on the possibilities go.
Also, I like to turn the broiler for about 90 seconds before removing them from the oven.  All I can say is, "Try it, you'll like it."

Great idea for a side dish, but I messed up and used Mexican 4 cheese blend and bacon bits to save time, and the DW did not like it at all. If I make it again I WILL adhere to the recipe as written. PROMISE.

Made the mistake of dunking the potato into the butter(per another reviewer) instead of brushing it on. Too greasy! Follow original recipe. Will make again, these are much easier than potato skins.

This is a great recipe! I cut my rounds a little thinner than 1/2 inch and they cooked just right. My roommate can't decide whether we like this recipe of the potato skin one we tried last week. Very tasty! I can't wait to make them again.

These were really delicious!  I used olive oil instead of butter to make them a little healthier.  I also used a little salt and pepper before baking and feel the potatoes would have been bland without it.  I didn't have any green onions on hand and they were definitely missed, so I'll be sure to have them available next time.  I'll definitely make these again and again.  Thank you for a great, easy new way to fix potatoes!

Liked the taste but some of the potatoes got pretty crispy around the edges. With the bacon and cheese it was good, but not sure it''s worth all the calories.

Tried this recipe and it was awesome.This is definitely a keeper especially during the football season.we tried two different dipping sauces. One was a French onion dip and I added a little more sour cream to it. The other was a Ranch with bacon dressing. Both were awesome. The good thing about these potato rounds is they stay warm for a long time after putting them out to serve. They even taste wonderful just by themselves cold.

I added one thing that will make your mouth water- I brushed each slice with BBQ sauce before baking! Added cheese and bacon while baking, but if you are worried about burning the cheese, bake 1/2 the time and then add the cheese and bacon. Top with ranch dressing or sour cream when they come out of the oven.

Made these tonight as a side to filet.  Yummy!  I did cheat and use Hormel real crumbled bacon.  Otherwise followed exactly.  Soft on the inside and brown and crispy on the outside! Thank you!  I'm going to make a giant tray of these the next time I have people over for football!!!

This has recently become my favorite potato dish, I think.  My wife makes a cookie sheet of them each topped with different cheeses, jalapenos, adding sour cream or salsa at the table. Mmm mmm, good!

Had 2 large russets and maybe only 1/2 a cup of grated cheddar so i also used a little american cheese. I followed others advice and poured the melted butter over the potato slices in a bowl. I seasoned with onion powder, garlic salt, chili powder, a bit of season salt & Some fresh ground pepper. I put em in the oven at 400 for 15 mins then flipped over and cooked another 13 minutes. I didn't want them to be crispy but more baked potato like. Took them out and sprinkled the cheddar over all  then took slices of American, tore them up and added about 3 little chunks to each potato. I cooked and crumbled turkey bacon over top & broiled until cheese was bubbly. Drizzled with ranch dressing & we all devoured them! 2 large potatoes fed me, my husband, my 12 yr old and his buddy! Great late night snack but I'd bet they'd be awesome with a steak or any meat instead of a baked potato. Great appetizer for parties too! I was out but  I will definitely add green onion next time

This recipe was just ok.  I wish I had followed the recipe as written but instead I followed other reviewers and coated my potatoes in olive oil instead of using the butter and I used cooking spray on my cookie sheet and I felt this made the potatoes greasy, and too soft instead of crisp.  I will try this recipe again following it as it is written. Otherwise I followed the recipe but I did add some salt to the potatoes as I felt they would be bland without it.  I served them with sour cream and ranch dressing.

They were really good and a hit! Next go round I will be sure to add a non-stick agent to the pan, it was a bit tricky trying to flip some of them. Be sure not to cut them too thin because the thinner ones were a little crispier than I liked. I served with sourcream. Very very good!

These are like potato skins for lazy people...right up my alley!  I chose to cut my potatoes a little thinner than 1/2" for a bit of a crisp and they were awesome (the ones I cut at 1/2" for Mr. LTH were great, too!).  I used less butter (about 1/2) and will use even less next time just to cut back on some calories.  I'm lazy, so I used real bacon bits as opposed to frying my own bacon.  I topped w/light sour cream w/some chives and garlic salt mixed in with it.  Awesome.  Another winner from Michele O'Sullivan; THANKS!

Loved these! I did rub the potato with oil and sprinkle with coarse salt before slicing. Plus I would slice them a tad thinner. Other than that, my husband and I both loved them. Very easy to make too. Definitely a keeper.  :0)

These were edible but the taste fell flat.  I added salt, sour cream and even a dash of hot sauce but the flavor just wasn't there.  Something is missing but I'm not sure what.  I won't make them again since there are many good potato skin recipes out there that are yummier.

My teenaged boys loved these so much that I ended up making them two nights in a row!  My oldest is a potato skin fanatic and he said these were better than skins.  I topped each with a swirl of sour cream and the entire pan disappeared in a matter of minutes!  Thanks, Michele!

Great flavor, but way too much butter. Next time I won't do it quite the same. They were just as greasy as fried.

Not a huge fan of those.I was looking forward having these for Christmas dinner as they looked delicious and the ratings were great and usually on this site when something has a lot of good ratings it's genuinly great. I wanted to like these,but the taste just fell flat,couldn't taste much of anything else from the ingredients other than the potato itself.Maybe they would be better if sour cream was added,but couldn't find it so had them without.They weren't that bad,but given the time that went into making them and the less than amazing taste they had I'm sticking to fries!

For a serving for one, I nuked a potato, let it cool completely, sliced it, topped it with goodies listed and put it into a hot oven for about 5 minutes. Oh my, my, so good!

This is a solid appetizer which most likely your guests will love.  I followed the recipe to the T.  The only recommendation I would make is that this is not a "make & take" recipe.  They are best served and eaten right from the oven.  I took mine to a party and they were cold 5 minutes after I arrived.

These were really good.  Using bacon bits works just as well as long as they are not the imitation kind.  Really worth the calories!!  Yummy.  PS, I used my Pampered Chef stone and they didn't burn a bit!  They were perfect.

The key is to make sure your rounds are an even thickness, otherwise they cook differently.

Another trick is to take a stick of butter and use it to "paint" the foil lined pan before putting the potatoes down. This saves some time and mess.

I made these for a small get together, and they were a hit! I didn't have one left over! Served them with a side of sour cream.

Very easy, little mess, and VERY Yum!

I have been making these just like this for many years.  Everyone loves them.   Just be sure not to slice the potatoes too thin or you'll have potato chips.

Brought this to a party, and it was a big hit. I just made a few changes. I sliced the potatoes about 1/4" and tossed them in a bowl with salt, pepper, and some garlic powder. Then I poured the melted butter over them and mixed them well. I also used real bacon bits instead of cooking bacon and crumbling it. I served these with a bowl of sour cream for dipping/topping, and they were gone in a flash! Thanks for an easy, tasty appetizer recipe that I'll be making often!

This recipe is fantastic and so versatile. Using the potatoes as a blank canvas you can top them with anything. One of my favorite burritos is potato, cheese and green chile. After the potatoes are done I top them with chopped green chile and cheese and put them back in the oven so the cheese can melt. We love them so much that I buy very large potatoes and my husband and I make them our dinner. I tried another reviewers suggestion and added some BBQ sauce to the bacon and wow they are a baconholics dream come true.

To die for! So easy! I used 3 potatos since these were just for a snack during a game. Sadly, half of one of them was bad. But it still made enough (there were four of us). Dipped the slices in melted butter. Put on a foil covered cookie sheet. Salt & pepper. 20 mins at 400. Flip. Salt & pepper other side. 20 mins at 400. I put heaping teaspoons of bacon bits (real kind, but store bought) on each. Then huge heaps of cheddar/jack on top. Sprinkled a little more bacon on top of that for color (we don't care for the onions). Back in at 400 for a few minutes. Voila! We each had 4 or 5. Still had 3 leftover. Plenty!! Better than regular potato skins, and a lot less work! Just YUMMY!

It was good, not outstanding but good. A lot easier than the traditional potato skins and a nice side dish for pizza.

I add a little potato seasoning I got from Lamberts which is the perfect seasoning. This is a great side because it's customizable - add/remove as you want.

This recipe was a big hit!  I took the advice of others and used the onion soup mix (for xtra flavor);  and mixed the cheese, onions and bacon with sour cream to keep everything together.  It made scooping the topping onto the potatoes quick an mess-free.  I diluted the cheese a bit, but it was okay.  To maintain the crispness of the rounds, serve immediately.  Everything is better with bacon :)

This was an absolute hit with my family! The recipe is so easy that my 20 year old son, who never lifts a finger to help with meals, has made it for himself several times - and I just found this recipe only 5 weeks ago! He has also made it for my 15 year old son and his grandmother. You can't go wrong with four favorite foods in this house: potatoes, cheese, bacon and butter!

these were absolutely great. we ate almost all of them and we are 3 filled an entire jelly roll pan full only difference I did was to toss the potatoes in butter rather than brush and sliced them about 1/8 thinner for a little more crisp and used packaged real bacon pieces other than that followed recipe and they were great will definitly be making these again. Thanks Michele for sharing. GG

Excellent. Made the recipe exactly as called for the first two times and it was a big hit. Will certainly make it again.  The third time I made it for people that like spicy foods so I sprinkled cayenne pepper on the potatoes before adding the cheese. Everyone enjoyed them.

These were exactly what you would expect.  I made these for my boyfriend, as they are right up his alley.  They were very good, very easy.  It just takes time to bake the potatoes.

These are very good, and I am saying that without having put the bacon on!  I had cooked and crumbled bacon leftover over from another meal which I had saved just to make these, only to discover it was eaten.  Still, these were delicious, and perfect with the roasted chicken I made for dinner.  I will be making these again, and rest assured, I WILL add bacon!

These were delicious! They disappeared quickly from a game day buffet. I think I will try to add the sour cream under the cheese next time. Just a bit dry.

I love these! So much easier than fried potato skins and somewhat healthier as well. These often take the place of baked potatoes as a side dish for us too. If you're trying to eat less carbs but can't give up the beloved tater completely, this is a nice start. Thanks! :o)

Most definitely add sour cream and salt and pepper them well.  We actually dipped them in ranch and nacho cheese b/c we didn't have any sour cream on hand. Probably make again with some adjustments.

These were so tasty!  I brushed them with olive oil instead of butter, and after they were flipped I sprinkled them with a dash of seasoned salt.  I paired them with steaks, but these would make great little appetizers too!  Save time by using store-bought bacon crumbles.  Yummmm...

These were AWESOME!  I cut up 5 small red potatoes for me and hubby.  Made as written then topped with light sour cream.  This tasted just like potato skins at the famour restaurants but for a fraction of the cost.  The real bacon and green onion really took this off the chart.

Delicious and easy!  I added a little garlic powder and salt to the melted butter.  Didn't have time to cook bacon, so I used a package of real bacon bits. Also good with pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.

absolutely wonderful :) till now there isn't a better way of cooking potatoes that i know of!!! my bf munched up nearly 20 slices of these hahahahahaha
cooked up home-made bacon bits as another reviewer suggested, and used olive oil instead of butter, immersed them in a bowl of oil rather than brushing.
definitely a keeper!!!!

I have some very picky eaters in my house and they loved them! I loved how easy they were to make and how great they tasted. Definitely will be making them again...most likely before the week is over. 
Thank You for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Yum, Yum, Yum.  I did "fry" these in a pan with just a little butter, on both sides, just cause I didn't need the oven on so long for my main dish.  I just popped them in the oven long enough to melt the cheese.  A new favorite way to make potatoes in my house!

This was a hit!  My kids thought they were great!! I seasoned the rounds before baking with sea salt, pepper, garlic.  Would make a great appetizer for a party!

Great stuff!  I used smaller Red Skin potatoes cut in half.  Subbed olive oil for the butter.  Baked them on parchment paper for easy clean up and nicely browned bottoms.  I did add a dash of black pepper to spice them up a bit.  Will make these often I'm certain!

I made these for movie night snacks.  I took the easy route with the bacon and used packaged real bacon pieces (I hate cooking bacon).  Awesome, I can't believe I never thought to do this before.  Thanks Michele!

These were really tasty!  I used russets and cooked my bacon in the microwave while the potatoes were cooking.  I also added my green onions after taking the potatoes out of the oven.  Thanks for this delicious recipe!  They accompanied our sloppy joes perfectly!

I was reviewing recipes while hungry and this looked delicious.  I sliced one potato, fried it in butter and garlic powder for about 2 minutes, stuck it in the oven on a cookie sheet I sprayed w/ cooking spray and when done, added sour cream, bacon and cheddar cheese.  Since I had a jar of caviar from another recipe, I added a bit to half of the rounds.  Back in the oven to melt the cheese and it was just great.  The caviar topped rounds were preferred.  When I make these again, I will use a bit less sour cream.  This is very filling so I wouldn't make a lot if you are used to light eating.  I loved how easy it was, and it was very satisfying, because nothing beats bacon!

Healthy??  No!!  Tasty??  Yeh!!!  You get what you ask for with this one!  I followed the recipe except cut it in half.  Very yummy.  It helps to have something like this to use with leftovers--makes the meal seem better somehow!  Comfort food!

I keep forgetting to review this one.  I cut the potatoes slightly thicker - not a lot - at the suggestion of an AR exchange person.  You can change up the cheese if you don't have or like cheddar.  These are great as a side or on their own as an appetizer!

Sorry just did not work for us.  My dh didn't care for them either.  Kind of blah.  Definitely could use some kind of seasoning.  Don't think that I will try them again.

My very picky teenage son loved these!

I didn't have any regular bacon, so I used a package of real bacon bits in a bag.  I added garlic powder to the butter as someone else had suggested and sprinkled with seasoned salt at halftime of baking after turning.  These came out great!

I followed the suggestion to slice and fry one potato in a skillet, add the toppings and continue to cook covered until the cheese melts.  Such a tasty and complete meal for one served with a side of applesauce! This recipe will be a repeat in my kitchen.

Delicious, and very popular with guests.  The changes I made, based on previous comments:  tossed potato slices with just a little olive oil, rather than brushing with butter, sprayed the cookie sheets with cooking spray, mixed up toppings in a bowl, added a couple of tablespoons of ranch dressing to help mixture stick together, pushed the rounds together on the pan, then globbed (by hand) the topping on the rounds.  I also used Hormel Real Bacon, rather than cooking bacon slices (I was short on time.) They turned out beautiful, and tasted fabulous.

I made these for a Christmas party.  They were great-no leftovers!  I put a small dollop of sour cream on each round before the cheese and bacon (didn't use onions).  The only reason I don't rate 5* is the time factor involved in slicing and baking.

These are really delicious. After brushing with butter, I sprinkle with seasoned salt and pepper. I also add just a bit of sour cream to each round before adding cheese, bacon,etc. The sour cream helps the cheese to stick. I made these for our Super Bowl party, and they were gone in minutes.

I haven't made these in years.  I looked on allrecipes.com to find something to do with potatoes (rather than mash).

I used small potatoes, cut them in half and then scooped out some of the potato with a melon baller.  This allowed them to cook very quickly.  The only dissapointment was that I had no sour cream.

These are my new favorite indulgence!  I love potato skins from restaurants, but these, I can make at home and not waste any potato!  I did follow other's suggestions and dip the potato slices in butter...made it much easier.  I also like to use Yukon gold potatoes for this...to me, they taste much better!

Loved these! I used Yukon Golds and they came out perfect. Sprinkled a little seasoning salt over them and topped with sour cream when served ~ yummy! Thanks!

These were very good, I cooked these on my baking stone and they turned out good, this also helped to keep them warm,if you need to keep them in a holding pattern. I used both red and idaho and prefered the reds. I also made sure to season the potatos, and found I could have used even more.  Definately, a keeper!

My family just loved these. You have to make sure though that you time your meal just right because these can overcook easily. They will be a regular in my home.

These are fantastic! They remind me of potatoe skins, but are so much quicker to make.  We had them with a barbecued steak and fresh green beans,  I took the rest over to our neighbor and they loved them also.

I make these all the time. So easy! I don't put bacon on them but I usually do cheese for my son and hot peppers and cheese for my husband and I. Dipped in ketchup or sour cream they are delicious!

These were very good, but not as good as the potato skins I usually make.  I made these after realizing I did not have any oil for deep frying, and they were a perfect second choice.  I would definitely make them again, even though I prefer to make skins, so thank you for the recipe.

Wonderful recipe!  I made it tonight with baked ham and green bean casserole.  Like others suggested, I added a little garlic powder and black pepper, but other than that I followed the recipe.  This will be made over and over.  Thanks so much for sharing...

Made a slightly modified version of this by not measuring things and adding tomatoes and green peppers on top instead of the bacon and green onions. It turned out great! I sliced the potatoes quite thin and they turned out crispy, which I loved. 
Great recipe!

As a main course for healthy appetites it takes about half again as many as quoted.  Using the baking stone to cook them worked great!  I pretty much stuck with the recipe and had a lot of topping left over.  I used regular size potatoes out of the bag and cut them about 3/8ths inch thick.  Using the larger bakers would have worked better all around, feeding the appetites better and using up the topping mix.

Very good recipe.  I followed the recipe with the exception of a couple things. I cooked the potatoes in a frying pan instead of the oven (didn't have a lot of time) and used some of the bacon grease in the pan.  Bad I know but it was good. I then put them in the oven for 10 minutes with the toppings on them and a bit of thyme.

The recipe has all the things a busy person loves. Few ingredients, only 30 or 40 minutes depending on the thickness of the potato and taste. I printed this for my daughter because it's perfect for a working person. Thanks for this recipe

I have been making a close variation - I use new potatoes, microwaved for a few minutes to shorten cooking time, and instead of butter, I spray my cookie sheet with Pam, then spray the sliced potatoes with Pam, and sprinkle a little sea salt on before baking. Remainder of recipe is the same. I haven't tried butter but we love them this way and it perhaps saves a few calories?

This recipe is perfect, as is. Since it seems that changes are encouraged, I followed suit: I used mozzarella (no cheddar in the house), and I waved the truffle oil bottle over the butter/oil mixture that I tossed the potatos in, ever so slightly. Very nice. Thanks for the great recipe!

My family loves these potatoes. I have made these several times as an appetizer and as a side dish. I like using red potatoes and just for a change I used 2 links of Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage instead of bacon. I served the potato rounds with ranch dressing. Yummy and of course no leftovers.

This has become one of those easy to make appetizers to put out before the meal. I've prepared this several times, and I've started cutting the potatoes a little thinner and cooking a bit longer for a crunchier bite. An easy crowd pleaser!

SUPER YUM! Both my husband and I absolutely LOOOOVED these!!! Of course, I am a sucker for all things potato (mashed, baked or fried - I just can't get enough!), so I knew I'd enjoy every last bite. :) Not only were these SUPER easy to prepare, they were absolutely delicious! Other than subbing a touch of bacon grease for the butter called for (just enough to coat my potato slices), I made no changes. It took about 15-20 minutes for my potatoes to cook thru at which point I piled them in the center of my cookie sheet, slightly overlapping each slice. I covered everything with cheese, bacon and onion, turned off my oven and allowed the residual heat to do it's magic. I then drizzled our "fries" with Ranch dressing. These paired perfectly with the boneless buffalo wings we had for dinner. I felt like I was eating at Buffalo Wild Wings, but for half the cost (SLAM DUNK!). Thanks SO much for sharing your awesome recipe, Michelle! I'll be turning to this again and again for sure. :-)

These were great. First, I used EVOO instead of butter. I sliced all of the potatoes a little less than 1/2 inch. I put them in a bowl and used tongs to get the EVOO on them. I then put the on a large cookie sheet I have with a wire grate on it. I put them directly on the grate and the salt and pepper just one side. Cooked for 40 minutes and turned half way. Used the real bacon bits in a bottle and the topped with cheddar cheese. Back in the the oven under broil. Had sour cream on the side. Had the onions but didn't need them. This was great.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe, which is rare to find something that pleases 4 people!  I used reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese, and center cut bacon, along with spraying the potatoes with Olivio olive oil butter spray to cut down on fat and calories and used the green onions too.  I cut the potatoes a little thinner as we like them crispy.  I also sprayed the cookie sheet w/Pam to prevent sticking.  Will definitely make this one again!

I tried to bring down the fat content by using low fat cheese. But with the bacon and butter it's pretty impossible.

I used pre baked potatoes, we like extra virgin olive oil instead of butter but everything else the same, bake 10-15 mins, then top with cheese, scallions, and reduced fat bacon bits.  Bake until cheese is golden brown!

My family loved these.  I had golden potatoes on hand and just used those.  I omitted the butter and just tossed my slices with a bit of olive oil.  I also sprinkled the slices with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika.  I've made 2 batches in a week, but I felt that these didn't really give me the browned and crispy potatoes that we prefer when they were baked at 400, so the second batch, I cooked at 450.  Much better for us.  When done, I added the cheese and bacon and broiled for a couple of minutes.  I sprinkles with fresh chives (no green onions) when they came out of the oven and dolloped sour cream when served.  They were a hit!

This recipe was AMAZING AND EASY. My little girl won't try anything new and she loved these. I didn't use the green onions and bought a package of crumbled bacon pieces to save time. The preparation was quick and easy and I loved the fact I could throw them in the oven and get the rest of my dinner ready while waiting for them to cook. I topped the finished rounds with sour cream and my son used sour cream and Frank's Red Hot.  SUPER DELICIOUS!

I just toss the potatoes in the bacon grease, blot off the excess and dress from there. My family loves the taste of bacon, so I make these frequently, or derivations of it.

I did not like doing these at all.  The flavor was good but the mess and it was time consuming for a large family.  All potatoes were sliced the same but some cooked more than others.  Took way too many cookie sheets just to make enough for 5 people...will never do this again...

I took these to a family dinner and they were a hit. It was nice because they truly are a finger food.I will make them for the family and I would take these to work for lunch. I took the advice of another member and put cookie cooling racks on the cookie shett to cook them which was brillant no sticking and no turning of the potatoes. I used a cutting board which has a ruler on it to insure 1/2 in slices and I see how the right thickness is key to success. Next time I will salt them before baking.

I made these last night when we were wanting something warm but lighter than a full mean. It was a perfect choice. I served them with salsa and sour cream. I was delighted how quick and easy they were and I will certainly adding these to my list of favorite appetizers.

Very good as is, the second batch I brushed with oil instead of the butter as it crisped the potatoes up more. I recommend a good sharp cheese and a good bacon as there are not a lot of ingredients to compensate for ingredients with poor flavor, I used hickory smoked peppered thick slice bacon and a sharp cheddar.

What's left to say? These are super easy and amazingly delicious! I don't use butter though, I just toss the potato slices with a tiny bit of olive oil (and I sometimes add some garlic powder for something different), then place on a cookie sheet lined with non-stick foil and proceed as written. Yummy!!! (I do top with some fat free sour cream as soon as they come out of the oven. It warms and softens the sour cream to the perfect consistency by the time you put them on the table.)

I have made these for years, only on the grill. Vary your toppings as wanted (diced peppers, jalapenos,olives, onions) or what ever you like. I coat with olive oil and season with various spices before cooking. Even an already baked potato works great!

These are very addicting and nice alternative to potato skins.  I skipped the butter part, didn't think it added much other than calories.  These are also very good cold the morning after.

These are surprisingly good.  I burnt my bacon so ended up using bacon bits as a back up and I think I will just do this in the future because it was so easy and good.  Everyone raved about them.  I also forgot to put the green onions on -- which I will try to remember to add next time...but their absence did not detract.

I really liked these. The only alteration I made was sprinkling salt and fresh pepper on the slices before I put them in the oven. I do think it is important to brush butter on both sides, and turn them as well. Have made these multiple times now, and am loving the recipe. :) Quick and easy way to use up the last few potatoes in a big bag.

These were delicious!!!  I will be making them again.  I used the shredded 4 cheese mexican blend and it turned out great.  It does need some extra butter or cooking spray on the baking sheet if you use aluminum foil like I do.

I make these for my family and we love to sprinkle garlic seasoning on them after I dip the slices in melted butter.  We also like a small dallop of sour cream with them which adds more great flavor.

These were pretty darn good (with some added spices). I knew the potatoes would be bland with no salt, so I dipped in melted butter then salt & peppered both sides. Also added a little onion powder. Followed directions for baking and they stuck to the cookie sheet pretty bad. Next time I'll use non-stick aluminum foil. Topped with cheddar, bacon and chives (didn't have green onion). I will be making these again.

These were very well received, but how can you go wrong with bacon and cheese?! I didn't use the butter, just nonstick spray on each side of the potatoes to cut back on the calories.  They crisped up nicely, but were tender on the inside! These were great for our appetizer night!

These taste exactly like you'd expect them too :) 

I really liked the taste of these (and my boyfriend did too!) It's definitely not something that you can make every week, but would be super delicious for the big game.

Modifications:
 1) I cut the portions in half because there were only two of us eating and it worked out nicely to fill one cookie sheet.
2) I actually dipped my potato slices in butter instead of brushing them . It made them easy to take of the pan!

Go ahead and give it a try!! Recommended! Plus who doesn't want there home smelling like bacon??

These were very tasty and a good change from just "bakers".  I did make some changes though.  I brushed with olive oil instead of butter, used bacon bits instead of bacon and then I mixed it all up together with some sour cream and put a dollop on each potato.  Yummy!

I'm making these for our Super Bowl party, and I just hope we'll have enough--so simple, but so delicious.  Perfect for a football game.  And there's no way they're 800 calories per serving.  A raw potato slice just brushed with butter, a little crumpled bacon and maybe a tablespoon of grated cheddar? Nope.

I make these all the time and they are a family favorite.  I often brush on some barbaque sauce under the cheese/bacon to give them a little pop of flavor and so they aren't too dry and I always serve with sour cream.  So YUMMY!

These are a great potato skin alternative.  I also just tossed them in a bowl with oil.  They definitely need salt, maybe some garlic, before baking.

I sliced two of the potatoes length-wise, thinking they'd be easier to top, and two into rounds. I placed all of the sliced potatoes in a gallon ziplock bag with 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. They are all evenly coated with oil, salt, and pepper with just a few shakes. I baked as directed; both the rounds and the length-wise slices baked perfectly in 30 minutes. I flipped them every 7-8 minutes to prevent sticking. After I added the toppings (you're going to lose a lot of the toppings no matter what; the size of round didn't seem to make much of a difference), I baked another 4 minutes. These were a HUGE, HUGE, HUGE hit with all three of my kids, who dipped them in ranch dressing.

These potatoes were excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect.  As other reviewers, I just added salt and pepper.  These will be a regular side dish in my house.

Best ever potatoes!!  Better than potato skins.  My whole family loved them.  I'll be making these often.  I dipped the potatoes in the melted butter instead of brushing it on, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

I make these alot but I kind of cheat and instead of using melted butter, I spray the pan before adding the potatoes and then I spray the tops of the potatoes.  It is ALOT faster than using melted butter and brush.  Another thing I really like to do is brush on a little bit of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce on the top side before cooking.  YUM.

WOW! I could not stop eating these!  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, but dipped the potatoes in melted butter and sprinkled lightly w/ granulated garlic before baking.  My kids (especially my 17 month old) kept asking for more.  Definitely a keeper!!

This is a quick and delicious recipe.  I used veg. oil instead of butter. I thought that would smoke less. My husband loved them and much easier than potato skins.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I have made these for years only slightly different.  I use olive oil in place of the butter and whatever shredded cheese we have on hand.  You can't go wrong with potato, bacon and cheese!  A great combination :)

These were amazing! My husband said I could make them every day & they are better than TGIFriday's potato skin.  I topped them with sour cream.  If you have smaller potatoes, you can cut them lengh wise (so they are more ovals instead of rounds).  I didn't have a brush, so I melted butter & tossed the potatoes in that.  I also sprayed Pam on baking sheet first

These were actually better than what I expected. These turned out very well and if I had sour cream, they would have been even better. The one suggestion that I have is to use a mandolin slicer to get the potatoes all even. I had a couple that were too thin and burned and a couple that were a little too thick. I will make these again but will deffinately be using the mandolin.

These are so easy and good!  A few of mine stuck to the pan, so I'll grease the pan next time and add a little seasoning salt after brushing on the butter.  It was great with sour cream!  YUM!  My 7-year-old wants them for her birthday meal in seven months!

A great combo and an easier alternative to potato skins. Instead of using butter I simply sprayed both sides of the rounds with Pam. I think they came out less greasy this way.

These were good.  I had a problem with the rounds sticking to the cookie sheet even though they were dipped in butter.  I will spray the cookie sheet with Pam next time.  I took the advice of other reviewers and flavored my butter with a little garlic powder and seasoned my potato slices with salt, pepper and Lawrys.  I will try this recipe again!

Just a quick tip: if you do end up frying them, make sure you watch them. I left them alone for a couple minutes while I was reading other people's reviews and some of them burned. The others were delicious, though. My sister loved them! Good recipe.

This recipe is good, but the potatoes have to be baked for WAY longer than the recipe states. I had to bake the potatoes for 50 minutes before I added the bacon and potatoes (after which I baked again for 15 minutes).

These were great my children LOVED them.  I did make some changes.  I added fresh garlic to the butter.  And I also brushed on some Barbque sauce.  I used premade bacon bits made with real bacon.  They were a hit!

Used hormel (I think that was the brand) real bacon peices, much easier plus I hate frying bacon...spooned a dallop of sour cream on each potato round before baking the second time.  It was a hit at the office picnic!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  This is just like potato skins, only MUCH easier, and you don't waste anything.  Not for the health conscious, though!!!

These were amazing! My husband could not stop coming into the kitchen to "steal" some before dinner. These would also be great as an appetizer. They are similar to potato skins, only easier. I will definitely make these again and again!

Great recipe. I added some garlic powder to the potatoes while before I put them into bake. I added some chopped onions and fried them up with the green peppers before adding them to the potatoes. It was really good. My husband is picky about the way his potatoes are cooked and he really enjoyed this. Will definitely do this one again!

I followed the suggestions of others and dipped the potatoes in the melted butter so it would be quicker to make. I tried to be really careful not to get a lot of butter on the potato slices, but these still turned out a bit too greasy for me. I would make these again, but maybe this time take the time to go through and just brush a light coating, instead of doing the dipping. Thanks for the recipe!

Mmmmm.... Health Food. Grease the cookie sheet with butter, then mix onion, cheese, & bacon with softened butter. You might need to add a little more, but it helps the ingredients stick together when pressed into a spoon, then placed on potatoes.

These were delicious!  I made them for a block party, and everyone told me how great they were.  I didn't even have any left to bring home!  I dipped the potatoes in the melted butter, which was faster than brushing it on.

I loved this recipe, although my husband did not.  It was easy and tasted really good.  I left the onions off of half the potatoes to see if it would make a difference.  I prefer them without, but that's just me.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great.  The sides got too crunchy, so I will try covering that with butter next time as well (or maybe slice thinner).  Almost like homemade french fries!!!

i loved these as did my partner. they were so soft. I used new potatoes and cut off both ends so they sat flat, after I'd brushed the butter on top I added garlic and herb seasoning and also some rosemary. As we both like our bacon crispy I put it straight on the potatoes and popped them in the oven for around 50 minutes. nothing burned and I was really pleased with how they turned out. I'll definitely make this a regular recipe and use it if ever I'm hosting
 thank you!

I cooked the bacon in the oven  on tin foil.
Then, I replaced the step which says to cover the tin foil with butter and used the bacon grease I already had.
The taste was just amazing !!!

These turned out to be a great stand-in for our favorite bar's potato skins that we love.  Easy Peasy following the recipe and, like our much loved bar skins, we drizzled bbq sauce on top and served with a side of sour cream.  So much better than fries!

Forgot to buy the green onions, I think they would have added a bit more flavor.  Will not forget them next time. I made 5 large russet potatoes for 4 people, and there were no left overs.  Prep time is a longer than I'd like, but they looked very good, and my family is already asking for them again.

Love this! Delicious and easy! Hit the spot!  I like what future comments suggested to add salt while baking and a little more after!

The thinner the slice on the potato, the crispier they are when cooked. Delicious. A mix of potato skins and home made potato chips.

This is a great idea, as an alternative to baked potatoes, or just as a snack. They taste great and are incredibly easy to make.

Did not want to use the oven so followed a reviewer's suggestion and put the slices on a skillet. Had previously just parboiled them in salt water. Topped with sauteed bacon bits, green onions, chives, mixture of cheddar & mozarella. Turned out yum.

Loved these! To try to reduce the fat a bit I did not use the butter and just used cooking spray on both sides. This probably changed the taste a little but they were still delicious. I will be making these again!

Followed recipe but I baked them on my cooling racks that fit inside my rimmed baking sheets. First I lined my baking sheets with parchment paper for easy clean up. Crisps both sides with no need to turn.

Thanks, Michele these were a huge hit with my family.  Slicing makes much more sense than slicing into wedges.  The toppings stay on top where they belong!  Perfect side for the barbecued pork sandwiches that I served with them.

Too time consuming for what it is. Difficult to place toppings on potatoes, because they were so greasy from butter.

Excellent.  Cooked as directed.  I am a salt fanatic and wanted to salt them just from a gut feeling, but refrained as one person in our party has blood pressure issues.  They were perfect, Just as is!  Huge hit, will add to my favorites!

Gobbled these up!  Served them with Buffalo Chicken Tenders and it was a huge hit. Only change was I sprinkled the potatoes  with garlic powder, kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. A dab of sour cream at the table was the perfect topping.

They were really good.  About what you would expect, but not necessarily spectacular.   I really did like them, and they were quicker than doing a whole potato.   Heated up great the next day, in a frying pan.  I'll make them again, but probably on the grill next time.  After cooking, I used a seasoned sour cream on some of them, and a little ketchup on a few too.

These were so easy to prepare and so tasty! I sprayed the sheet before preparing to ward off any stick. Other than that pretty much stuck to the recipe. Adding to the convenience, I used precooked bacon. Served with a little sour cream on top, these were delicious.

Followed recipe without making changes. The result  was pretty good.  Next time I would use less or no green onions at all. They were overpowering and I usually try not to eat onions  anyway.

This is a fast easy appetizer to make, I added salt, pepper and  garlic powder to the butter, I did have to bake the potatoes longer than 40 mins.  I did wish the recipe told you to already Fry your bacon ahead of time, I did fry mine a little bit but the directions on it are not the great.  But overall decent and fast appetizers.

Great! One suggestion that helps- buy the pre-cooked bacon and all you have to do is microwave the bacon for 50 seconds. Huge time saver and better with real bacon. Yum!!

I have made this recipe twice now. Had it again tonight and it's one of my favourites! I've never tried it with green onions since I usually don't have them in my fridge, but it still is great without them. Can't believe how something so simple could taste so amazing!!

Fantastic! The only change I made was adding a bit of garlic salt before cooking and using prepackaged bacon pieces. I'll definitely be making these again!

A delicious snack to enjoy  while watching 'The Game' on a Sunday afternoon....  Easy on the chef and happily gobbled down by the fans ( between screams of joy and/or anguish) who are so stuffed by games end that no dinner preparation is necessary......

We grill the potatoes outside during the summer. Low heat. Add cheese & bacon last few minutes to melt.  Top with the onion tops and a  a dollop of sour cream to serve.  Good easy sidè. Kids like them too.

I cooked the potatoes in the microwave then sliced and buttered the potatoes. I put them under the broiler until brown then flipped and browned the other side. I then added the cheese and bacon and put the pan back in the oven just until the cheese melted. The potatoes were delicious and I will definitely be making them again!

I agree that adding the sour cream before the cheese works well, but regardless, this recipe is fantastic for potato lovers who want a healthier alternative to deep-fried potato skins.

My produce-loving son and my starch-loving daughter both loved them.

Thanks for sharing a great recipe. I put my sliced potatoes on foil sprayed with pam. I sprinkled them with olive oil turning them to get nicely coated. I applied salt and pepper. I baked in oven for about 30-40 minutes. While baking I mixed an 8 oz sharp shredded cheese with two bunches of green onions sliced thin, a package of real bacon bits and then added enough sour cream in mixture to hold everything together. Once potatoes were done, I put cheese mixture on and baked for 5 minutes until cheese was melted. Yum Yum!

These were awesome!  Easy to make and delicious.  A great bite-sized alternative to the full-sized potato skins.  I used a little garlic salt and had some sour cream on the side.  Everybody loved them.

definitely 5 stars...these were way better then just regular potato skins. Like others just melted the butter added garlic powder then just tossed them, which was so much easier and quicker.  I seasoned them with salt and pepper and put them in the oven and put the bacon in the oven at the same time for about 18 minutes took it out let it cool, then crumbled over potatoes when down with the cheese and scallions . These were a big hit on game day...but I'll make these time and time again for any day.

wow, these were great. I did cook my potatoes 1/2 way thru, before I added a little butter, salt & pepper, cooked them a little bit more, till they were soft, than added  cheddar cheese, and freshly cooked bacon, broken into small pcs. Yummy, it was so good, but can only eat 2 -3 pcs, too much fat :)

Different way to enjoy potatoes, like leaving that little bit of skin on to brown with the potato, and of course, BACON, for heaven's sake! Who would not love these. Best part, my husband loved them.

Super easy and delicious!  Didn't want to make too many so used the toaster oven.  Brushed with canola instead of butter.  
Used parchment paper so the clean up was a breeze.  Plan to make a big batch and freeze some next time.

My family loved these! Only change I made was to toss the potato slices in olive oil (rather than butter) and seasoning before laying out on the cookie sheet. Delicious! My 8 year old daughter even wanted the leftover potatoes in her lunch at school the next day!

I pre cooked the potatoes in the microwave then sliced the potatoes added a little salt and pepper then the cheese, let that melt a little, then added more cheese, finished melting the cheese, then topped with the bacon.  Hubby likes these much better than potato skins and much easier to make.  About 30 minutes.  I omitted the butter in favor of extra cheese.

With the potatoes being a half-inch thick, they definitely needed to be seasoned with salt on both sides after being coated with the butter. I seasoned them as an afterthought on the topside only, but it  would've been better if the bottoms had some seasoning as well. I also added garlic powder and freshly ground black pepper- yum!! Since they didn't have enough salt they were better with a little sour cream.

I made this for a group of friends and they were gobbled up fast! Only thing I did different was to leave off the green onions. Instead, I mixed the sliced green onions into sour cream for a dip. Yummy!

I made these last night as a side to grilled Mahi tuna.  OMG!! they are terrific and sooo easy.  I followed the suggestions of "Caroline C" because the ingredients she used are the same that my husband and I use, except I made them in the toaster oven  for 30 minutes.  Not sure how they would turn out in the microwave.  This recipe has a lot of potential for change by exchanging the sour creme with Ranch, Blue Cheese or even Jalapeno Ranch.  I tried Bacon Bits (that's all had) but I think the crumbled bacon will be so much better.  Thank you Michele!! And THANK YOU, Caroline C.   This too will be my "go to" pot luck recipe.

We are not bacon bit lovers...so cook my own bacon. I put the onion on last thing,....like the crunch  of fresh green onions. Family loved it and we have a 8 and 10 year old granddaughters. So no onion on some of them...Great for watching football, movies etc. with pizza.....

whenever i make any fried potato's  I'll Nuke  them wrapped in a towel for 4-8 min. ,depending on how many, Days or hours ahead. makes finishing them lots faster because they are already  tender. So easy for adding to breakfast.

I've always made these with small red potato's which are very too. But these are so much easier. Just need a good dipping sauce. Maybe Ranch or Pepper corn Ranch?

of butter.  I used the pre-cooked bacon and they were delicious.

New favorite.  Although to speed things up.  Instead of brushing butter on I melted butter in a bowl and dunked potatoes with tongs and set them on cookie sheet.

Very good recipe, I made them last Friday for a Bible study group and will also make them tomorrow for another Bible study group, I made one change, I did not use butter, I sprayed lightly on both sides with Pam. Needless to say none of these came home with me from our Bible study.

Cut the russet baker potatoes, placed in a bowl & tossed w/just enough butter + 1/8 tsp garlic powder to coat. Seasoned both sides w/salt & pepper.  (Tried suggestion & added some dry ranch dressing mix for some added zip.)  Then I took the advice of other's by topping the spuds w/sour cream  BEFORE  adding the cheese, sliced green onions & bacon bits.

a great alternative to potato skins and will doing these more often.  The topping ideas are endless.  Next time I will season them with a little bit of steak seasoning when baking.

Who would want to waste that wonderful bacon grease after frying the bacon? Save the butter and toss the potatoes with the bacon grease. Or do as I did to cut a few minutes of cooking time -  I diced my bacon up in small pieces and fried in a very large pan. After removing the bacon and leaving the grease in the pan I added the potatoes, single layer, and fried until golden on each side before placing on the baking sheet. This step took about 15 minutes and left the potatoes firm but tender. I added the cheese and bacon and baked until the cheese melted, about 2 minutes. Green onions were a great compliment. A dab of sour cream would have taken these over the top. Great snack!

So delicious! I was looking at recipes all last night for what I should make today and this was the winner. It was easy to cook, not messy at all! I'm afraid this goes against all my diet rules but who cares it's wonderful!!! Definitely something I see my myself making more of in the future.

These were really good, only thing I did different was I used olive oil spray instead of butter. Coated the pan well with the spray, and they still stuck a little, also made sure to spray topside at beginning of cooking, and respray lightly after turning. Definitely a hit, and will make again! SO much easier than potato skins with same flavor

Perfect appetizer for NYE party.  They were gobbled up by everyone as soon as they came out of the oven.  Most people topped them with a dollop of sour cream.  I will be making smaller batches of these for dinner.

Bacon, cheese and potatoes -- rock stars of the appetizer world.  So easy to prep and make.  I usually add a little garlic and minced/diced mushrooms or jalapenos to switch it up.

I tried this just for fun and both of my parents including my brother and my boyfriend are crazy for this recipe! I think it is sooo addicting and it made me wish it wouldn't take as much time to make it  but even so, it comes out amazingly delicious each and every time! I even lost count on how many times I made it!

These are outstanding.   I peeled and sliced the russet potatoes 1/2 inch and brushed with butter then baked on parchment paper.   

After 40 mins, topped with bacon, cheese then green onions and broiled for about 3 mins.  Served with sour cream.  Delicious.  Will definitely make again and again...

I was skimming through recipes to use up my potatoes and decided to try this for college football Saturday.  These would be restaurant worthy- we just added a dab of A-1 sauce (or any BBQ sauce would do) once cooked along with the cheese and bacon and green onion. It just provided  a bit more of a kick and were gobbled up. Will definitely make again!

Love these potatoes! I've made these a few times and they are very good. I slice my potatoes and instead of brushing the butter on, I melt it and pour over the seasoned slices of potatoes then bake as directed.

Oh to be able to give these q ten star review!  They are the best appetizer EVER!  Made these (2 trays) to take on a boating cruise before dinner - my guests devoured them and asked for more, more, more.  Even cooled off they were delicious.  Thanks for such an easy and tasty treat!

Next time, I'd cut them length wise, add some spices, and drizzle ranch or sour cream over them.

This recipe was amazing & so easy!!  After buttering the potatoes,  I sprinkled on some salt and "Garlic Plus" spice. They turned out perfect! Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Simple -- Tasty -- Fun!  They look like you spent more time/effort than you actually do.  Season them up a bit -- they're potatoes -- they need it!  We did onion powder, garlic salt and pepper, tossed them in melted butter/evoo, baked on cooling rack over jelly roll pan for about 40 minutes (just watch them because it will depend on how thick your slices are).  We blended sharp cheddar and real bacon bits with just enough ranch dressing to clump, then dropped a dab on each slice and sprinkled the green onions...took about 4 min's to melt on top -- and then -- voila! perfect!

I place potatoes on a greased silicon sheet and don't add any oil or butter, after potato slices are soft I add salsa and sprinkle with shredded cheddar and broil for 5 minutes. Serve with sour cream, delicious!

I made these potatoes at a tailgate and they were fabulous! The only change is that I piled them instead of keeping them separate entities. Either way, they are worth making!

This was easy and very tasty. As some other reviewers noted, I did season the potato slices, both before putting them in the oven and again after flipping them halfway through cooking. I don't think they would have been quite as good without that step. But seriously, hard to go wrong with cheese and bacon!

I used hormel bacon bits (cut down on grease) , Johnny's, garlic pepper, and a small dollop of sour cream on each. I smoke cheese,so I had smoked Gouda and sharp smoked cheddar on hand , did some of each. I made #5 worth and took to a BBQ ,never seen anything vanish that quick !

These were lovely especially with sour cream.  I brushed my potatoes with oil instead of butter only because I didnt have any.  They make a great lunch and snack the next day too.  Be sure to make double batch,I always think if I am going to heat the oven for all that power just make loads as they will freeze well too.

Been making for years. Simply change melt butter and add potatoes.  Place on the grill.  Add topping when potatoes are almost done.

Try adding a little BBQ sauce to the potatoes before you add the bacon and cheese. After the cheese is melted put a do-lip of sour cream on top. It give them more flavor.

Easy, just made this for the fourth of July and it was a great side dish. I did add salt after the potatoes were bakes and sliced before and after they were topped with cheese, bacon, and green onions.

These are great.  Use some ranch dressing for dipping and they taste like cheese fries from your favorite restaurant.

I made these using canola oil instead of butter, served at the superbowl party and they were devoured - everyone loved them and they were so easy to pick up and eat.  I will be making again for my next event!

Awesome. Made these for a party on New Year's Eve and they were devoured. I forgot the green onions, but I did use the tip about spreading them with sour cream (though I used yogurt instead). Added an amazing creamy element.

Very yummy! I used two large russet potatoes, and that nearly filled a jellyroll pan -- plenty for three people. I baked for about 18 mins, turned, then cooked another 15 mins, added the toppings, and cooked about 5 more minutes. Just poke your potatoes with a fork at about 30 mins. If the thickest ones are getting tender (just tender -- don't overcook), you're ready for the toppings. TIPS: Sprinkle potatoes with salt and pepper before baking and again after you turn. Line your pan with foil and use parchment paper over it. No sticking and no cleanup! :)

Just did these today for lunch and absolutely loved them! I will use them as appetizers for my next evening party.

I made sure all the slices were the same thickness and sprinkled with salt to make them even crispier. Put in all in a parchment lined baking tray and it came out great. 

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Tasty! Unfortunately, I used bagged, shredded, 2% cheddar cheese instead of full fat and freshly shredded, so the cheese got dry instead of melty. Used Hormel (real) crumbled bacon bits, added some salt and pepper. Will definitely make again. I used them as a side dish to grilled chicken, but they would make a great appetizer too.

Good recipe! 
The sliced green onions makes it.  
I did not use the bacon bits, I prefer real bacon.

Incredible!  They went so fast they virtually disappeared from the plate.  Had to copy the recipe for a dinner guest.  Made it along with Bacon Cheese quiche and everyone was amazed - especially me.

I have been making these potatoes for years just by frying them on top the stove,topping with cheese & bacon,(no onions for me!)covering until the cheese melts. When ready to eat, just top with a dollop of sour cream. Delicious,quick, easy. I'm not sure why anyone would give this a bad rating. If you can't say anything good, then don't say anything at all. Thats my motto!!! GramB

These were OK. My family ate them but I could tell they were not super impressed. I think the potato itself needed some seasoning. It was just bland...something was missing.

These were good, but not anything special. They definitely needed salt, and next time, I might add garlic salt instead.

These were tasty and fun. I sprayed the cookie sheets and potato slices with PAM before sprinkling the toppings on haphazardly.  I didn't think these reheaetd very well, so I would advise making enough for one meal and not planning for many leftovers.

I loved this recipe because it was inexpensive, easy, relatively fast and my husband loved it so much he could hardly stop eating them.  This was like having a potato chip version of a baked potato.  You get all of the delicious flavor of the baked potato with the addictiveness of a potato chip. Also, these are small enough that it makes them really easy to store in a little tuperware after dinner... if you are lucky enough to have any left.

My family loved these!  I added a small (tsp) of sour cream to each one after they came out of the oven.  I also used real bacon bits, and just heated the bits in the microwave to crisp them.  It saved a lot of time.  Yummmmmy!

Loved it. Thought the cheese was going to stick to my baking sheet, but the butter did double duty and prevented it. :) Tried it with sour cream, but we liked it better with ranch, the kind you mix yourself.

I tried this recipe for the first time a few weeks ago and have made it 3 times since.  I followed the recipe to perfection on the first go-round and it was a hit, I then followed some of the variations provided by the reviewers, BBQ sauce, pepperoni and cheese, etc.  I made my own version last Sunday for breakfast, microwaving the potatoes and then cutting them into 1/2 inch rounds, lightly tossing with olive oil and onion powder, then scrambled eggs with jalapeno peppers, onions, bell pepper and cheese, with ham, can use bacon too, and topped the spuds with a little of the cooked egg mixture and a little more melted cheese, a HUGE hit!  Thanks for this wonderfully simple recipe.  SO many pleasing variations.

Awesome!!!
These were better than any potato skins that I've had at restaurants. Omitted the green onions because I didn't have any on hand and now I can't wait to try with them.

These potato rounds went like greased lightning at lunch yesterday. Will definately be making these again soon.
I sliced the potatoes and cooked them in a micro wave bag for 4 mins in the morning. Then closer to serving did the baking. Cut out the butter as well. Perfect!

I made half of this recipe, cutting back on the butter just a bit and eyeballed the cheddar and green onions.  I did omit the bacon because I was in a hurry.  I was surprised that we weren’t all that thrilled with this.  I’m giving it a 4* rating because this has to be a good recipe.  What’s not to like?  Maybe our tastebuds were off that night.  I’ll make this again sometime, because it’s easy and then I’ll see if we change our minds.

Excellent! I didn't use the green onions only because my husband doesn't like them and I used bacon bit instead of having to cook the bacon.  Will definitely make again!!

VERY good. I dipped mine in the butter instead of just brushing it. I would recommend not doing that, because it was a little too buttery. Next time I will just brush it.

The flavor is a 5. The amount of effort you have to go to to get there is like, a 2. So I'm being kind, because this IS a good recipe for many people. It's too much work for what it is--unless you want to just throw ingredients at potatoes, which is a huge waste of money, it takes too much time to carefully settle the cheese mounds, then onions, then bacon on top. IF I was to ever make these again--which I won't--I would make these adjustments. 1. Use PAM spray in place of butter step.  2. Season with salt & pepper just on one side. Garlic powder, cayenne, whatever. Do it now, and just on one side. 3. Don't turn them til you're ready to top them. 4. Cook untopped potatoes at 450 for the last 10 minutes before you top them, then take them out and immediately put cheese, bacon, and at last green onion. Then DON'T put back in, or your cheese will run off and your green onions will become blah onions. Yep, that is how I'd do it if I ever did it again. Thanks for the recipe, I know how to do this if I ever had a birthday request--but that's really the only way I'd bother again. Twice-baked are actually easier!

I added chopped onion and tossed it and the sliced potatoes in the melted butter. I put mine in the microwave for five min. first and cut the bake time in about half. Very good recipe and my family will eat these again.

Yummy!!! These were farely easy to do, got a little time consuming putting cheese and bacon on each one, but other than that very easy. I topped with sour cream. Great way to use up potatoes.

These were tasty and simple - great easy version of potato skins, but didn't blow me away. Next time I'll serve it as an appy or a snack, rather than a side with dinner. Thanks!

I thought for the little effort that goes into making these they were great.  I think I overdid it on the cheese a bit too greasy, but quite yummy.  I added a little salt to the potatoes and like it better with the sour cream.  My kids really liked them.  That's reason enough to make them again!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty good, mine came out a little greasy for my taste.  I added some seasoning before baking the potatoes which added some flavor.  Overall I think I prefer regular potato skins, but these are a yummy alternative!

Very good!! I sprinkled grill seasoning over the potatoes and then brushed with olive oil instead of butter. I only used half the amount of cheese, and it turned out to be very minimal. I will use the full amount of cheese next time.

These were good with a couple alterations. They did not get as crispy as a potato skin and I cooked them an extra 10 min so i threw them in the deep fryer for 1 min which was perfect. Also followed others reviews and tossed them in garlic salt and pepper, also added a top the tator topping.

These were very good although next time I think I'll experiment with the cheese, maybe use a mixture of different types.  We had a bit of a fiasco when my man accidentally knocked the whole pan of them cheese side up onto the kitchen floor but we ate them anyway:)  With just the 2 of us eating them they ended up lasting quite a while and go great with any meal, even breakfast.

THESE.ARE.AMAZING.  I cannot believe how good these are.  I made just one serving to try the recipe out, and my family asked me to make it again and "make a lot".  I used a combo of smart balanace and olive oil instead of butter and added a dash each of salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and basil to the potatoes.  I added diced mushrooms to the topping and used turkey bacon.  Try this recipe!!

These were excellent! I did bake on a cookie sheet lined w/foil & sprayed w/nonstick spray just to avoid a mess! Worked perfectly! Served w/a tiny dollop of sour cream on each one.

I loved these simple little potatoes! I used butter flavor Pam instead of the butter but followed all the other instructions.   They turned out perfect using low fat cheddar and Hormel bacon bits.  Yumm

I melt butter in a small skillet and then just dip the potatoes in.  I put on the cookie sheet and sprinkle the top with Lawry's seasoned salt.  Very good!

These are tasty little things!  Maybe not the prettiest for presentation, but, I bet if you put a plate of these down in a room of men they would be gone in seconds.  Great idea for football parties, tail gating, etc...I had to sprinkle with a tad of salt, otherwise..Yum!

These were great!! I subbed real bacon pieces/bits for slices.  Followed recipe as stated.  Will try again adding a few more spices for fun.  Great to have another way to do potatoes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Excellent!  Only change I will make in the future is to add some seasoning to the potatoes before baking.  THEN they will be perfect!

These were the simple and delicious snack i was looking for. I took the advice of another user and tossed the potatoes in the butter rather than brush each slice. Much easier. Next time I'll add some garlic and pepper into the butter too.

These were good!  They were done in time and not too done. I was careful to cut them about 1/2 inch thick as the recipe suggested.  I dipped them in butter and used seasoned salt and pepper on them.  I also used minced green and white onion and topped with sour cream.:-)  These were great for a different kind of side item to go with our BBQ.:-) I was tired of fries and tater tots!

Reading reviews is always a must. I melted the butter and dipped potato rounds in it and used real bacon pieces instead of frying bacon slices. I also had to bake the rounds quite a bit longer. Serving with ranch or sour cream is highly suggested!

YUM!  This was very good, and went well with the chicken cordon bleu I recipe!  I didnt have onions on mine, but I did serve with ketchup on the side and would have also done sour cream if I had it. Thanks for a great recipe that was easy and fast!

My husband loved these potato rounds.  I hate most potatoes, and could live the rest of my life without ever eatting so much as a french fry, but even I would make these again.  I give it a 5 star based just on that.

Been making these since college, love em! I use pre-packaged bacon pieces and sometimes I just use onion powder instead of chopped green onions for ease. Always gotta have sour cream to put on top, yum!

Very good!  My husband said they remind him of the Amarillo Fries at Lonestar Steakhouse.  We ate every last bit!

My husband says this recipe is definately 5 stars.  They weren't crispy, though.  Maybe they needed to stay in longer.  I mixed the cheese, bacon, and green onion all together in a bowl.  This made it easy to spoon onto the potatoes.  The sour cream was also a yummy addition.
