I have used this recipe several times with great success! I don't use the clams in the filling, just the cr. cheese and spices. I also bake at 350 for 15-20 instead of frying in oil. I love to crimp the tops and make the flower shape like you get in Chinese restaurants. Thanks for the post!

SOOOO good, super easy.  I used my deep fryer for these, they tasted better than in restaurants because I put in a lot of filling, (in restaurants they tend to skimp on the filling)  FYI, to seal the wonton shut, wet your fingertips with some water and trace the edges of the wonton, then seal them shut.

We call these crab rangoons. They were just as good as the ones we get in the Chinese restaurant.

These are delicious!! I make these for parties and I serve them with sweet and sour sauce, and bbq sauce and they're GONE as fast as I can fry them.   
I have also added shredded cooked chicken to the cream cheese mixture, heavenly.

Excellent recipe! I've never done wontons before but they came out excellent! After reading the reviews here, I used crabmeat the first time but the other flavors overpowered it - so I used clams the second time and it was much better. (I should have just followed the directions the first time!)

A very good recipe.  I had never worked with wontons before.  You certainly do need to use one lightly beaten egg plus 2 tbsps water as a "seal" for the edges.  I also used a fork to seal it in a pattern similar to ravioli.  This is a good base recipe... once you try it, you'll add more and new ingredients to make your wontons unique.

This is an appetizer I am quite familiar with making and eating every year-especially during family get togethers. I used reduced-fat cream cheese, minced green onions, cilantro, fresh ground black pepper, Hawaiian sea salt, dash of paprika and 1 garlic clove, minced. To seal the edges of the won ton wrappers, I used one whole egg, beaten. I also baked these at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes on a greased baking sheet instead of frying them in vegetable oil. These are cute, tasty little treats! They still came out golden and crispy but without the grease from frying in hot oil. I served these with, "Sweet and Sour Sauce II," also from this website.

I make a recipe like this called Hawaiian Shrimp Wonton Puffs with a filling that ROCKS!  It is 4 oz. of softened cream cheese, 6 oz. of minced shrimp, 1 clove of garlic (minced), 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1/8 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce and 1/8 teaspoon tabasco.

Yum, Yum and Yum! We loved these! I had never made Won Tons before and these were great the very first time and I will continue to make them. I omitted the water chestnuts and substituted the clams for crab meat. They were so simple and so delicious. I also did not fry them because I don't eat fried food, so I baked them in the oven at 350 for 15-20 minutes as per another reviewer's suggestion and they turned out beautifully crunchy and browned. Very good paired withe the Asian Chicken Salad from this site.

These are quite good. I did use shredded chicken instead of clams, but otherwise my ingredients were the same. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and baked them in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350. I did make the filling a night ahead, so I don't know if that allowed the flavors to blend more or not, but these were enjoyed by all at our party the next day, even baked.

This is a great base for cream cheese Won Tons.  I also substituted crab for clams and left out the water chestnuts.  These are expensive to buy at the store and I am so happy that I can enjoy them for much less cost!  :)  THANK YOU!

Not horrible, but not good.  The water chestnuts gave it a really strange texture.  These should be crunchy/chewy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  The flavor was also not there.  I tried to save the second half by adding cut up shrimp to the cream cheese mixture, and it made it better. All in all to make this taste good, omit the chestnut, add some garlic and chopped shrimp.

After reading the reviews, I tried baking these. I was not impressed. The filling (which I used imitation crab meat instead of clams, and was wonderful on it's own) leaked out (even after sealing with a little beaten egg) and the won tons were left hollow and pretty bland. 

I will try this again at some point and deep fry them to see if they turn out any better that way

This was a good recipe, but I think I cooked them too long. Instead of clams I used crab, and I didnt need 3 cups of oil, only 2. Great with sweet & sour sauce!

Excellent combination of flavors. Used shrimp instead of crab. Used one cream cheese and only about 1/4 cup shrimp and 2 Tblsps. water chestnuts. Smidge of paprika and white pepper. Made 12 to 15 wontons. Very Good!

Fabulous!  I made it vegetarian by using diced mushrooms in place of the clams.  I also left out the water chestnuts and added some fresh parsley and a drop of sesame oil.  To lower the fat, I used a combination of low-fat and fat-free cream cheese, and it still tasted great.  Next time I'm craving wontons, I'll definitely pull out this recipe!

I did not enjoy this as much as I was looking forward to it. It was probably my can of crab that made the dish way too fishy.

These are very tasty, pretty much just like those I get at my favorite thai restaurant.  The best part is, you can alter things according to your taste.  It's hard to mess up cream cheese, and you can add/subtract according to your taste for the rest.  We used the same seasonings and water chestnuts but substituted a bit of shredded canned crab, and they were delish.  I think next time we'll try the baking method - these were SO good but of course not as healthy, and it stinks up the house for a while. Don't know why sesame oil tastes so good but smells so bad when cooking. Enjoy!

This recipe was excellent.  I used crabmeat.  The filling had a very good taste.  Best of all, my picky kids loved them.

Yummy, excellent!  I used crab meat instead because I had it on hand.  But, next time I think I'll double the amount of crab.  Also, I wasn't very happy with the brand of won ton wrappers I used---they where very small & I couldn't get much filling in them (the filling is so good you want a lot in each won ton!).  Also, I used some in peanut oil and some in veggie oil & I did like the peanut oil better.

I did not have any clams on hand so just omitted them and added some old bay seasoning.  My Daughter loved them.  Be careful these cook up in seconds.  I like them a darker golden and season them with a little bit of salt after taking out of oil.

My whole family loved these, I couldnt make enough of them! The second time I made them I did however use 2 cans of clams because I felt like there wasnt enough clam to taste. Also I did not use the water chestnuts because no one in our family likes them. They were great and I will be making them very often!

I made the the cream cheese wontons, the filling was excellent, but they didn't come out crispy.  I used an electric deep dryer with wesson oil at 350 degrees, but the wraps were soft.  Any suggestions?   thanks

That can of clams I thought I had when I checked the pantry turned out to be mushrooms!!!!  But what the Hay, I used them instead and this happy little mistake turned out wonderfully.  I will make this "mistake" again.

These were pretty tasty!  Added 2 1/2 tsp red curry powder for more kick.  I like things spicy and more Indian/Thai spiced.  Before the curry they tasted very "American" to me...you know, paprika the famous potato salad spice... I just associate it with that!!  Very great, though.  Dinner guests loved every bite.
