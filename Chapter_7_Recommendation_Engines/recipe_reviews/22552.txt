I've been making this candy for many years because it's that good, and that simple. My recipe varies only slightly from this one, but it may help those who experienced any problems. Line your jelly roll pan with foil, then spray the foil with cooking spray. (This way you won't wreck your pan, and they won't stick) Heat the sugar and butter to boiling, then boil three minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Pour mixture over crackers and bake 5 minutes. Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over top (I use milk chocolate as a matter of personal preference), then spread evenly as the chocolate begins to melt -- no need to return this to the oven. I then top with 1 cup finely chopped almonds or pecans, pressing down lightly. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, then break into pieces and store in refrigerator.  This is no fail and just delicious...addicting too!

I love these! Here are some tips for making them a little easier......1-before you lay out the crackers put foil on the cookie sheets, 2-don't pour the sugar mixture over them, just spoon it on, and 3-while the crackers are in the oven melt the chocolate chips in a saucepan with a tablespoon or so of milk and then spoon the chocolate over them and put in the fridge to cool.

Yummy.  I didn't know how to apply 10oz of crackers, (most boxes of saltines are 16 oz).  About 1/4 of a 16 oz. package of crackers lines the bottom of a jelly roll pan.  To use close to 10 oz., you would have to have more than one layer of crackers.  I did not do this.  I used enough crackers for one layer on the bottom of the pan.  I also melted the chocolate chips on the stovetop with about 1 Tbsp of milk.  This made it easier to spread.  I also melted some white chocoalte chips and drizzled over the top for color.  Like someone else suggested, I boiled the sugar mixture for about 2-3 minutes before topping the crackers to bake.  This made the toffee more firm.

I have made this many times.  I love it!  It is so easy.  The recipe I have is slightly different (using white sugar), but I am sure it is just as good.  I do have some suggestions.  Make sure you use chocolate "chips".  I had chocolate "chunks" thinking it would work the same...NOT!!!!!!  I also melt white chocolate and drizzle it over the dark chocolate to make it look nicer.  Enjoy!

Have made this recipe for 2 years now after failing at traditional toffee recipes.  I love it. So does my husband and neighbors.  The changes that I made are this - I make sure that I boil the sugar and butter for a few minutes until it starts to darken and morph into a pre-candy stage.  Also, I cook the whole thing for 8 -10 minutes  before adding the choc chips.  Then I just pop it in (even with the oven off) to melt the chips.  I burnt it the forst time that I cooked it for 5 minutes.  Too hot for chips at that temp..  It does take a while to set.  I always put mine in the garage or porch (in the winter).  IT will help speed the process.  Not the real thing, but  close with tasty results!!!!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I've been making it for years as part of the gift baskets I give away at Christmas.  I must say that it is VERY important to line your cookie sheet with heavy duty foil and then either grease the foil or spray with Pam.  I use different types of nuts...whatever I have on hand, and sometimes I don't use any nuts at all.  
The back of a soup spoon seems to work well for smoothing out the chips after they have melted

These are wonderful. I used the  release foil,lightly buttered, and they came out of the pan easily. I also added nuts on top of the chocolate immediately after baking. Make sure to boil the butter/br. sugar mixture about 3 minutes so it will solidify.

I must of done something wrong, because the bars never "set-up". When I tried to lift them from the pan, they were gooey and running.  Any ideas of where I went wrong? I had to dip them in crushed pecans to kinda "solidify" them enough to handle. Thanks

I will not be trying this again. Not only did I waste the ingredients, it ruined my pan.  The chocolate chips did not melt and the bottom layer became glued to the pan.

I've tried to make these several times and every time the saltines "float" to the top of the toffee mixture while baking, leaving the sticky toffee on the bottom.  Although they taste the same and are delicious, they are a sticky mess. What am I doing wrong?

This is a great recipe, but if you use a buttery cracker - our favorite for this is Keebler Clubhouse - it will be even better!  Ritz also works well.   I know someone who loves the large-size Cheez-Its with this but haven't tried that one.  You can also stir in a teaspoon of vanilla to the sugar/butter after removing from heat for added flavor.

I make this recipe every Christmas and usually a time or two during the year and we all love it.  Like some other reviewers said, definitely line the pan with foil and then I always spray it with cooking spray as well.  I use enough saltines to linet the bottom of the pan and break some in half to fit the edges.  I get the butter, brown sugar, and a touch of vanilla boiling and boil for 5 minutes, then put in the oven and bake for 5 minutes.  I pull the pan out, sprinkle chocolate chips over the top, and cover it with foil for a few minutes.  Then take the foil off and the chocolate is easily spreadable.  We use Planter's sundae peanuts on top, and refrigerate until solid.  For gifts, I break into abstract pieces and put in treat bags or boxes with gold tissue or ribbon.  Hope this helps!

I've been making this for years and it is a family favorite around the holidays.  MARYAC, I usually let it boil for a few minutes.  Maybe you didn't let it boil long enough b/c that's when it thickens?  Just a thought.  I sprinkle some chopped nuts on the melted chocolate.  YUMMY!

I make this every year as part of my Christmas cookie trays and everyone loves it.  I use the non-stick foil or parchment paper to line the pan.  This way the pan stays clean and everything comes out easily.  I have used cinnamon graham crackers and Keebler Club crackers.  Everyone seems to like the salty club crackers the best.  Don't put the chocolate back in the oven!  The chips will melt fine with the residual heat.  Give them 5 minutes and then use a flat offset spatula to smooth the chocolate.  I sprinkle the top with red and green sprinkles for the holidays, but sliced toasted almonds are very good also.

I've made these with semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips. I've used chopped macadamia nuts, almonds & pecans.  I've used graham crackers, saltines and the long narrow buttery crackers. Just make sure the butter/sugar mixture boils for 4 minutes before removing from heat. I line my jelly roll pan with parchment paper.  Also - you do not need to place the pan back into the oven after the chocolate chips.  The heat from the sugar melts them. Just let the chips soften for a minute then spread evenly before sprinkling the nuts. This is probably the reason some of the negative complaints have mentioned burnt chocolate.    So easy and so addictive!

I substituted Heath English Toffee Bits/Milk Chocolate Toffee Bits for the chocolate chips.  I sprinkled the top, after baking, with the entire 8 oz. bag, and lightly pressed them into place.  Looks like a real confectioners treat!

I love this recipe. BUT, here are a few tips. Do not use cheap or store brand chocolate chips--they do not melt the same. I suggest Nestle or Hershey. Also, I prefer to use a dollop of crisco to help melt my chips rather than milk. I tried cheap chips and milk this time and its was horrible. They didn't melt fully and ended up gritty.

Tasty and not super difficult. I used "Release Reynolds Foil" and did not have a sticking problem. I would suggest setting the timer about 5 minutes shorter than recommended - and keep an eye on it. Sugar burns quickly! Do not skip the cooling step! I tried plain, pecan-topped and peppermint. The peppermint did not go over very well at my party but the other two varieties were gone! I will make again!

These are the best!  I substituted rich Keebler Club Cracker for the saltines.  They add a certain amount of oomph to them.  Careful doing these with kids - the sugar/butter mixture can cause a nasty burn.

I am very picky about recipes I find online. Many that have 5 stars are just gross!  I love this! Make sure you line your cookie sheet with parchment paper. I let it go up over the sides to keep the sticky off of the pan. Also, I have made it b4 without putting it in the oven.  Maybe bake it 2 or three minutes. Sometimes I pour on the butter mixture then throw on milk choc chips ( I always use milk choc) and let them melt.  I have used walnuts, pecans and those nut topping packets.  Another mistake people make is using 1 stick of butter thinking its 1 cup. I have done this in a hurry and you won't
 have enough mixture. 2 sticks = 1 cup one more thing. I dont measure 10 oz in crackers. I have a large cookie sheet and fill it up.

These are very good compared to how simple they are. I did as recommended - gently boiling the toffee for 3 minutes.

Super yummy!!I did follow a few changes suggested by others.   1) used 1/2 tsp of vanilla after boiling sugar and butter.  2) used milk chocolate instead of semi choc.  Perfer the taste over all.   Also, did not put back into the over for a second time, just let the heat melt the chocolate and spread.   Added almonds afterwards.   Wonderful!

I tweaked this recipe because it needed it... first of all i used 2 sleeves of saltines and made 3 layers with 2 sticks of margarine/2cups of sugar cooked until boiling constructed in a 9 x 13 prepared glass pan then baked it in a 375 degree oven for 30min at which point i removed the pan from the oven and scattered 6 oz of chocolate chips over the top. I then placed the pan back in the oven for another 5 minutes, removed it to cool on a wire rack, decorated the melted chocolate by raking the tip of a fork over the top of the pastry, then finished it with a sprinkle of grey sea salt over the top. After it was entirely cooled i cut it intoo rough pieces to serve. My kids all loved it.

I am writing this 3 reviews based on how the recipe is written.  I wish I would have read reviews better before making this so I could have applied others tips.  Like how to spoon the brown sugar sauce over the top instead of pouring and how to melt choc chips first.  These tasted good but did not look like the picture at all.  The chocolate chips were still in whole form and when I tried to spread them out after warm it just looked like a mess.  Mine did not turn out as "bars" but more as a snack mix.

I have made this several times with the suggestions made by Naples34102.  Fantastic and addictive!  So easy to make, the short 5 minutes of baking fills the house with the smell of a candy store.  A really simple, delicious recipe.

So good and so easy you would be silly not to try this recipe. One thing I should mention…do not make this on a cookie sheet.  The first time I made this in a 9X13 dish.  It worked well.  The next time I got lazy and made it on a cookie sheet, BIG MISTAKE!  The toffee melted and spilled into the bottom of my oven.

My sugar did not melt!  They did set but fall apart easily.  Because the sugar did not melt it is gritty on the bottom.  If my sugar melted I would definitely give it five stars,  very good minus the sugar problem.

I made these today as a birthday gift for my sister-in-law. I didn't have saltines, but I was able to use Ritz Crackers instead. These were just wonderful, and I had no trouble removing from my pan, which I lined with Reynolds Release Foil sprayed with canola oil. I also sped up the setting process by placing the sheet in the freezer. Next time I think I will try topping some crushed popcorn as a base. I will update my review if this works well.

OMG! get them out of my house NOW!! Ha!  I didnt change much - lined pan with tinfoil and sprayed with butter flavored pam.  Poured the sugar over the crackers and made sure it got underneath (so the bottoms are covered) and toasted some almod slices because I didnt have walnuts.  Also - ran out of chocolate chips so added some mini baking kisses and butterscotch chips.  They are so delicious!!

Delicious! I lined my jelly roll pan with foil and it did not stick at all. It is very important to stir the butter and sugar so that it dissolves but do not stir when it starts to boil because it'll cause the toffee to get too sticky. I used milk chocolate and topped it with dark chocolate m&m's. Delicious!

Very good!  I halved this recipe, and like a little bit less of the brown sugar mixture to allow for the saltiness of the cracker to come through.  Next time I will use a spatula to spread the chocolate.  I also had trouble with my crackers spreading across the pan, so looking for a way to fix that too.  Overall, excellent!

I tried this recipe and did not get "pretty" results. The butter & brown sugar mixture did not properly absorb into the cracker so when it was completely done it was butter & brown sugar layer, dry cracker layer, and chocolate layer instead of one properly mixed dessert. Granted, I took the advise of one of the reviews and followed their adaptations that was slightly different than the original recipe. IF I were to try this again - which I probably won't - I'd follow the original recipe and ignore the comments and adaptations. It was a bit of a mess and a waste.

yummy. I greased a sheet of foil in the pan, then put the stuff in. I also ran low on choc. chips, so I put mini marshmallows with half a bag and then could spread it all over just fine.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I have people that get angry with me when I show up to holiday parties with out this!  Only change I make is I put non-stick aluminum foil down.  If you don't getting them out of the pain is impossible.   ENJOY!

I have made these before with a different recipe and will say that this was a disaster.  Like a few other reviewers who had trouble melting the chocolate in the oven, my chocolate crumbled and would not spread at all.  I'm sure they'll taste fine, but they look awful.  The only difference between this and the one called Saltine Toffee Bars is that after you add the chocolate, you do not place it back in the 400 degree oven.  Too much heat destroys chocolate.  Next time, I'll probably try covering it with foil like another reviewer suggested and let the chocolate melt slowly.

I give this recipe 3 stars as it is written because 1) it would have been a huge mess if I had not lined the pan with something (I used parchment paper and it worked fine) 2) I think there was too much liquid - the buttery mixture ran everywhere and ended up also coating the underside of the crackers.  Or maybe I didn't use enough crackers?  Like others, I'm not sure how much 10 oz. of crackers is.  Maybe I should use less butter, or maybe should boil it longer as some others have suggested. 3) I don't know why, but the chocolate didn't melt very well.  I tried to use a spreader to spread it around and it just clumped up in big chocolate blobs, while some of the chips never melted at all.  How can chocolate not melt in a 400 degree oven??  Anyway, these tasted good, but weren't very pretty or appetizing-looking, so they weren't very popular at the party.  Since the taste was good, I will make them again, but I will probably use less butter, boil it longer, and melt the chocolate separately and then pour it over the top.

These are always a hit whenever I make them.  One tip, before you lay the crackers on your cookie sheet, put down heavy duty tin foil, once the cookies have cooled in the fridge, carefully peel off the foil.  Makes clean up and setting of bars much easier.

Classic and wonderfully simple, especially for the holidays.
Here's a creative twist: use dark chocolate infused with peppermint oil and top with crushed candy cane pieces for a winter flare.

What did I do wrong-these tasted good but they looked horrible. The chocolate didn;t melt right and was very clumpy. BUt the flavor was very good. My kids really liked them despite their appearance.

Hard to believe you start out with crackers on this! It really is hard to distinguish from traditional toffee. I used graham crackers the first time because I was chicken, but I think I will try the saltines next time just to see how they differ. One tip - don't substitute margarine. You need the "real" butter flavor in this.

I tried these at work from a friend, and loved them.  When I found the recipe here, I had to try it.  So easy, and so good!  They taste exactly like the Chocolate Werther's candies I adore.  My mom, who can't eat a lot of candy because it makes her teeth hurt, even requested the recipe!

I have made this many times and enjoy it every time! I am mixing it up by trying different crackers, chocolate, and nuts. I boil the toffee for 3-5 minutes. And use tin foil to line the pan. This is a must have recipe for my recipe box. Make it to your preferences. Be sure to try the original as well.

To my dismay, this recipe may not be the best for a cooking novice such as myself. I have nothing bad to say about the recipe itself, it was pretty tasty, however I just made a few mistakes. I don't think I boiled the butter and brown sugar long enough, and it didn't mix right because once the mixture cooled on the crackers, it was still very grainy. I also used a smaller pan and less crackers which I thought would be ok (because how can you have too much sugar and chocolate? ) but it just made it way too sweet. The end result was just like biting into pure sugar. Lastly, I read some of the comments saying people melted down the chocolate on the stove instead of in the oven on the crackers as the recipe calls for. I went for the stove method- BIG MISTAKE. Next time I plan on following the recipe exactly as written! The only tip I did like was using foil on the pan AND spraying the foil with cooking spray.

Easy as can be.  First batch, I made as written, and it was perfect.  Second batch, I added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla as recommended in one of the reviews.  Couldn’t taste the vanilla, and the toffee was less crunchy and slightly more chewy.  Due to the vanilla or for some other reason, I’m not sure, but they were still over-the-top delish!  But from now on, I’ll make these with no changes whatsoever.
PS I baked on a non stick jelly roll pan without using any butter or Pam, and these cookies didn’t stick at all.

I've eaten this before and it looked and tasted amazing!  This recipe just didn't work.  The butter/sugar combo didn't really stay on top of the crackers--it sunk beneath the crackers.  The chocolate chips were clumpy and unmelted after 5 min. so we cooked it 3 more.  Still clumpy and didn't look right. We haven't tasted it yet, but so far I am really disappointed!

These taste so good! But what a mess I have now. I followed the advice I read in the comments from naples 34102 and ROBBINS47:Foil lined pan, cook spray,etc.I couldn't possibly use them as gifts because they don't look very nice.I doubt I will try this again...but they are delicious.

I also found that boiling the butter and brown sugar for 3 minutes made a big difference.  I added 2/3 c. bits o' brickle (toffee bits) to the butter mixture and 1 cup of toasted sliced almonds to the chocolate on top before placing back in the oven.  When all the baking is done, I like adding some seasonal sprinkles (the fun shaped not the colored sugar) to the top.  I often use dark chocolate chips or milk chocolate chips or a blend of chips; this is a great time to use all those half-empty bags of baking chips.

Make sure to line your pan and spray the foil.  Add 1/4 tsp. vanilla to the sugar mixture too.  I added a little coconut to my chocolate chips and put it back in the oven (turned off) for 4 more minutes to melt.  Then spread evenly.  I also topped it off with Pampered Chef's Sweet Caramel Crunch topping before refrigerating.  So delicious and easy!!

They were great.  As many others, I increased the amount of butter in the crust to 10 tablespoons (1/2 cup + 2 TBS) and doubled the amount of toffee.

Definatley use the foil and grease it! My 3 year old helped me put the crackers out (1 sleeve filled the pan) and the rest was just as the recipe said, though I did boil the butter/sugar for 2-3 min. Turned out so great! Reminds me of tiger butter. It's the special treat for the first day of school! :)

I've had these before and always liked them.  I love how simple they are to make.  I followed other members suggestions and boiled sugar/butter mixture for at least 8 minutes.  I sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.  Had a hard time cutting into nice squares, so just ended up breaking into pieces.

These were good, but the recipe is confusing. "one 10oz package of crackers" really just means one sleeve of crackers. Also, after baking with the chocolate chips on top it looks better if you smooth them to make an even coating.

I love this recipe.  I used butter instead of margarine because butter usually sets up harder than margarine for me.

I love this recipe.  So easy and so good! With all the different chocolate chips out there now, I tried peanut butter, white chocolate and marbled chips. You can really dress these up!

These are great and so easy to make!  They are addictive, and the recipe makes a lot!  I added in some peanut butter to the brown sugar and butter, it is really good that way with the chocolate.  I wouldn't use as much butter next time, but would use a bit more peanut butter instead.  I found the mixture to be a little greasy.  I did let it boil a few minutes longer to get thicker (the pb helped with this too) and I lined the pan with foil (sprayed with butter flavored pam) before putting the crackers down, I haven't had any clean up problems at all.  Everyone in my family loves them.

I would rate the taste at 5 stars, but I believe the sugar/butter mixture should be boiled for a few minutes. I don't know what a 10 oz package of crackers is because mine comes in 16 oz, so I just filled up a jelly roll pan with saltines. I used one of the new silicon sheets, and it made everything easy. I believe the baking time should be longer; however, I think the oven should be off for letting the chips melt, just for about 2 minutes. I will probably try these again but use one of the other recipes on this site. Thanks anyway Toni!

These are very easy quick dessert item.  I have heard of people using graham crackers for the bottom but I like it this way better.  Quick sweet dessert to add to a BBQ table or holiday spread.
