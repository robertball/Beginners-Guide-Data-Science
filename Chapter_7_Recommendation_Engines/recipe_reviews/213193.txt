It was good, but due to my families high blood pressure I cooked the gizzards in fresh celery, carrots, garlic and shallots or onion.  The flavor was magnificent.  I discarded the cooked veggies. I then added 1/4 tsp. Kosher salt to flour along with fresh ground black pepper.  I left out the Italian herb seasoning because of the salt content.  My family raved about the gizzards.  Even the family without high blood pressure were happy without the extra salt! Thanks for the base recipe.

Lots of flavor.  They are better cold.  I followed the recipe except for the hot sauce because I thought that would be to spicy for my taste.

Way better than the usual deep fried and tough/ chewy gizzards that you get at most places.  I kept it pretty simple - just added minced onion, minced garlic and celery seed to water and simmered for 1 1/2 hours.  Rinsed and cooled and sprinkled with a litte garlic salt and tossed in flour and pan fried (my preference over deep frying) in a mixture of oil and butter, stirring until as crispy as you like it.  I like to mix some Heinz 57 and sour cream together to dip them in.  They were so tender, juicy, crispy and tasty.  Thanks for the recipie.

Great idea! I grew up on a farm and have had lots of fried gizzards BUT nothing that tastes as good as these. I placed mine in a crockpot in the morning on low and by dinner time they were nice and tender. My husband likes his tossed in Garlic  Buffalo Sauce! Much healthier than fatty Buffalo Wings! Thank you for the post!

These were tender and delicious.  Someone previously said they were going to try "beef gizzards"??  Huh...?!?  Hmmm...

The process of tenderizing them is excellent, but I will definitely change the seasonings and breading next time.  The italian seasoning was way over powering and definitely not like any other gizzards i have had in the past.  Just dropping them in plain flour really didn't do them justice either.  I think more of a sage flavor would be much better.

Yee-Haw!  These are perfect!  Since you only fry the gizzard for a minute or so, it's imperative to boil first to get the flavor and tenderness. I cut gizzards in half before cooking, and use House of Autry Chicken Breader (Publix) to coat. Batter sticks best if you bread them right after the boil, then wait a minute and shake on a second coat.  I also sprinkle hot sauce after fried.

TENDER & TASTY! Ok, I never bother to rate recipes although, I pull many off of this site. But I HAD to let you all know that this is an excellent recipe. I grew up on fried chicken gizzards, being from TN, we actually had a restaurant near Nashville that specialized in fried gizzards. These are tender & delicious & much BETTER than what I grew up on! I mixed a dipping sauce, which I have never tried with gizzards, which I used Sour cream, garlic powder & Crystal hot sauce. I was seriously, scooping every last drop out of the bowl with my last gizzard. I will NEVER fry traditional, tough, chewy gizzards again! I can't wait to cook these for my Southern parents who are 73 years old. My Dad will complain that my Mom was doing it wrong all of these years! HA

Hearts and Gizzards were never on my list until my other half came into my life. His family has always had them, flour, salt pepper no boiling, just fried, and I have to say this is the best I've ever had, and I intend on making them for the family so they can have something other than rubbery. They may like rubbery but he says these have been the best he's ever had! I used progresso garlic and herb as the recipe suggested and minimized the liquid in the end mixture. Used the flour mixture for some of the frying and the progresso for the rest and the progresso was far better. This is the new all time recipe for me now!

I saw gizzards at the market and thought who would eat those things! then I saw this recipe and figured I would give it a try. they are excellent! crispy and tangy and much better than greasy chicken wings. my hubby Chunky Fred ate most of the bowl before the kids could even get to them. now that I know how to make them  I am going to try beef gizzards and use the same recipe. thanks

I really liked the "chew", not too tough but still a lot of character.  I read the reviews and some said that simmering for 1.5 hours was enough, so I split the difference and simmered for 2 hours.  I removed the gizzards from the simmering pot straight into a zip top baggie, then added the marinating ingredients and marinated, then just dumped the 1 cup of flour in when I was ready to deep fry; I couldn't see the sense in removing them to a dish to marinate only to dump them into a baggie to flour them. I liked the lightly crunchy texture that the simple flour dredge gave them.  I ate quite a few of these while watching the game, as did a friend.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I cook chicken gizzards at least once a month, this is an excellent method if you adjust seasonings to your liking. Tips: To get batter to stick better, dry gizzards completely after they've soaked in the broth.  Then dip in egg just before placing in bag with your flour. So good it'll make a rabbit slap a bulldog!

Delicious, crispy, oniony flavored goodness.  My husband and I have really crossed over to the dark side :) We were vegetarians (he for 11 years, me for 5) and now here we are eating deepfried chicken gizzards for dinner! :)  Very tasty, boiling them for 2 1/2 hours sure felt like a long time. I cooked ours for 1 1/2 hours, then fried in batches at 375.  Made a spicy dipping sauce of mayo, ketchup, hot sauce, garlic and onion powder and lemon juice.  It was totally delicious.  I served it with a green salad lightly dressed with a homemade mustard vinaigrette.

These were awesome!!!!Very tender.  I don't like Gizzards but I loved these.  My husband is a gizzard eater but he thought these were amazing.  Could not quit eating them.  They were all gone and we wanted more.  We are thinking about using bread crumbs to bread them next time though.  The flour did not stay on very well during frying.

I followed the recipe exactly. I have been eating fried gizzards all my life and part of the fun is the chewiness of the gizzard. I would make again for someone who can't chew well but as a true Southerner I like the chewy side of things. I do heavily season and boil gizzards when I make dirty rice.

I've only really cooked gizzards using flour and seasoning like the second phase of this recipe. I never would have thought to precook them but it really seemed to tenderize the pieces as much as they can be tender. Addictive to eat too.

Very tender and delicious. Great way to tenderize what is usually a very chewy protein. My wife suggested pressure cooking them next time which seems like a great idea. They seemed a bit salty for my taste, I think the next time we will cut the salt in half, eliminate the italian seasoning and dip them in the fish breading mix we use. Thanks for sharing.

I used what I had on hand. I put onion powder, celery salt, bay leaves and boiled the gizzards. I then used the seasoned salt, garlic powder, celery salt, black pepper, sage, and hot sauce. I then dipped them in a egg wash and tossed them in flour then  deep fried. They were so tender. Thanks bunches for sharing. Definately a keeper.

I followed this recipe to the letter and while they were very tasty, I did not find that boiling them made them any more tender.  I really thought it would as my mother would cook 2 whole chickens every Sunday when I was growing up (8 mouths to feed).  She would cook the lives, gizzards and hearts for my dad but occasionally I'd get a gizzard and loved them.  But she never boiled them first and they were always chewy as gizzards are.  I was actually a little disappointed that they weren't more tender but they were still fantastic.  Maybe next time I'll boil them longer (I went 2 hours on these).  From the moment the water and vegetables came to a boil, the smell was wonderful!!!

mmmm, mmmm, mmmm. Boiling the gizzards for 1 1/2 hours did the trick for me. The seasoning can be adjusted to any ones liking. Me...I preferred not to include all the extra dry seasoning. I did marinate them for about 1/2 hour in my home made hot sauce before flouring. What a wonderful treat to find this recipe. Thank you
P.S. I give you two 5 stars for this one.

I tried this recipe for my first time ever making gizzards (my husbands favorite). It was such a hit that I couldn't fry them up fast enough! My kids, husband, and his friend gobbled them up! Next time will probably at least double the recipe!!

I made a few substitutions based on what I had laying in the cupboard.  I used Siracha instead of the Louisiana-style hot sauce (increased quantity), garlic paste instead of garlic powder, and I didn't have celery so I used celery seeds. Ohh, and instead of flour, I used a panko-dill covering that I had left over from some fish I made this week.  

I thought it came out great! I've never had tender gizzards like this.  i don't know how my version compares to the original, but this recipe is fairly flexible to tweaks and changes.

This is the first time I prepared gizzards.  I actually used duck gizzards.  They taste a lot like turkey.  I wish the breading were thicker.  Next time I would  make a wet batter.  Otherwise, this is THE recipe for fried gizzards.

I can't believe the difference when boiled first! And the broth gizzards created is delicious! Who knew?!?  I did not do anything like this recipe said when it came to batter as I just did my own thing but I will boil first every time. I just put th on to simmering the morning and after I strained them put them in the fridge until I was ready to batter and fry.

I want to experiment with the seasoning package more ... even with the elimination of the hot sauce, it's a bit spicy for my tastes - think the pepper is the lead candidate there. However, the technique ... the Technique! Hearts & gizzards have been a favorite since childhood and my children loved them as well. Yet the tough, rubbery texture of the gizzards was always a discordant note. I'd never before heard of either boiling or deep frying this meat. Liked it before and now I'm ecstatic. Also love how it creates a nice stock for soup as well. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, pnutmommy; it will be a staple in my kitchen plus shared with family and friends alike. Best discovery of the many years I've been visiting AR !!

Gawd, I love gizzards!  If I could eat up to my gizzard in gizzards I would.  These were some of the best I've had.  Delicioso!  Bravo!

I have a tip to add to this.  If you add a tbs. of meat tenderizer in the water with your spices,  it will cut down boiling time by an hour or so (be careful bc meat tenderizer often has salt in it,  so cut down on regular salt) simmer over med high heat until fork tender about an hour and a half to two hours.  I did this,  but for spices I just used salt, cayenne pepper,  and garlic powder (sometimes I add onion too) , and after I battered,  breaded,  and fried them,  they were tender and delicious.... yum!  I can pig out on these babies!

I've been craving chicken gizzards since having them at Harold's Chicken and ice bar. This recipe is awesome.  The outside crispy. The inside tender and flavorful. Can't wait to make more.

I will never fry gizzards without boiling them first after eating these. It was amazing!! I hate chewy gizzards, its like eating gristle...I left out alot of the seasonings and used cornmeal/flour mix instead of just flour. Very crispy and the breading sticks so much better. The trick is cornmeal.

This was the first time I have ever made gizzards and first time I've ever deep fried something, but I couldn't be happier! I used this a base, and then added my own tweaks:
- I trimmed the gizzards of the connective tissue that make gizzards so rubbery (however this made for more popcorn style gizzards than larger tavern style).
- I added 3 garlic cloves and about 2 tablespoons of cajun seasoning to the gizzards as they simmered. 
- Instead of using the italian seasoning, I used approx. 1 tablespoon of cumin, smoked paprika, ground chipotle, and some cheyenne pepper.
-I didn't have Louisiana style hot sauce, so I used Sriracha instead
- I deep fried the gizzards in peanut oil
- Finally, I used panko breading instead of flour for a little more crispy texture.

These were so good! Super tender, and just the right amount of heat. Will totally use this recipe again.

Sadly I found this recipe way to salty and the gizzards were use as a vehicle to transport the flavor of the seasonings and by doing so lost their own flavor. Although these gizzards were very tender after boiling for 2 1/2 hours, I just feel the flavor of the seasonings overpowered the gizzards .

Like other reviewers I adjusted seasonings to my taste.  Very good.  I still like them best the way I grew up with them - my Mom always cooked these in her pasta sauce until they were really really tender.  She also used turkey gizzard and heart as part of her dressing recipe.

I've cooked gizzard all my life, I wanted something different and I found this recipe. This is by far the best gizzard recipe! I saved 2hrs by using my power pressure cooker to tenderize in 15mins!
I also turned the bagged juice into a sauce. I'm so excited for the outcome. Hubby will be on cloud 9!

LOVE this recipe. We always save the broth and use it later in soup or where I need chicken broth, but its FANTASTIC. We never add the Italian seasoning, but its a super recipe, regardless.

These were very good.
The only changes I made were to add a little chopped garlic to the simmering broth and I opted to pressure cook these for 45 mins. before they went into the fridge to cool.
After frying, the texture was a little chewy but satisfying and not tough at all. The flavors were thoroughly infused and I dipped in blue cheese dressing and buffalo wing sauce.

They were really tasty. Only issue I had was that the breading came off a bit when I put them into the oil. I am not sure but maybe the oil was too hot?

I definitely like the method!  I did double dip the gizzards into seasoned  flour, but  the real secret is simmering the gizzards.

It turned out great. Rather than boiling the gizzards I used my instant pot and cooked them for 40 minutes with the suggested ingredients.

It's a nice recipe for making any and "all" a gizzard lover.  For me, I missed the "chew" of a gizzard and could not get past it.  Also, I changed up the recipe a bit as well.  I cooked the gizzards according to the recipe but for 1.5 hours.  I skipped all the Italian herbs but marinated in garlic seasoning, pepper, salt, hot sauce and a Costa Rican Lizani sauce.

For the breading as we all like crispy gizzards... I shook the marinade off, dredged in flour,  then egg dipped, and then flour with salt, pepper & garlic.  This makes them crazy crispy of course...theres no other way to get them crispier!  

NEXT TIME I will precook the gizzards for 1/2 hour only.  I will follow the same steps I did this time and hope to find a nice chew to my gizzards without being over the top chewy.  Thanks for the heads up on precooking to remove the crazy chewiness....you can adjust this cook time to however you like them.  I'll precook 1/2 hour only next time.

This did take awhile to make. The flavor was GREAT but my husband did miss the chewy part of gizzards. This would be great for someone who can't chew well.

I tripled recipe and followed exactly with exception of I did not triple the hot sauce because I was afraid it would be too hot. Surprisingly , it was not so I will triple that also next time. I won’t use any other recipe now. My family loved it

I didn’t eat it but made it for a friend. He loved it! The only thing I did different was had add a little more salt and after I boiled it, I soaked it in buttermilk overnight. 
I don’t eat gizzards but he loved it and that’s all that mattered.

I have to say I am not one to try a lot of new recipes but I desired to make  my gizzards more tender so I decided to check online.  I couldn't imagine actually doing the long prep time but this was well worth it!! I did add meat tenderizer and cut the simmer time about 30 minutes.  The gizzards were delicious!! Family had seconds!!  Thank you so much!!! This will change the way I prepare them for now on.

Happy I saved the broth, that is where all the flavor went.  Only used pressure cooker for five minutes but will never par-boil again. I am originally from the South, never heard of such a thing. I will stick with my Mothers ol' method cause it is really good.

Excellent gizzard recipe! The boiling and simmering are the absolute key to making deliciously tender gizzards!

I did not like the flavor of these and I did not like the fact that they were kind of mushy once they were fried. The worse fried chicken gizzards I have ever had

Not impressive. I love gizzards and was disappointed. I also agree that the flour just came off. when frying.  That is part of the goodness.

Pro:
*Meat is tender

Cons:
*Flavor profile is weak.  The salt and hot sauce come through but nothing else from the spice mixture.
*Plain flour tastes like just that... plain flour.  The outer crust, whatever was there, was just a powder taste and texture. Seasoning the flour would have helped and maybe choosing a flour/meal mixture instead.
-*Maybe it's just the Texas in  but Iove think, crunchy crust.  This did not it.

I will not be making this recipe again.

The house smelled wonderful during the boiling part of the recipe.  After the whole thing was done, they tasted much better than I had hoped for. The seasoning taste was mild, but there without a doubt. The next time I make it I will probably have to increase the seasoning at both the boiling and frying stages
