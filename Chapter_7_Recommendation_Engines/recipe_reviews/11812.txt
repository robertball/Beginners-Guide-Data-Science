This is my 2nd time making this recipe.  It's delicious, however you do need to cut down on the bread crumbs.  One other thing I will do next time is use the whole 8 oz. of Velveeta cheese to make it cheesier!  Great casserole!

MMMMMMMMM!!!!   I did make the following small changes:  I used 2 tbsp of instant minced onion, and reduced the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup with 1 tbsp melted butter.  Turned out really yummy!  I was pleasantly suprised!

So easy and my family loved it! I took previous suggestions and used mushroom soup and less breadcumbs. I also melted butter and mixed the bread crumbs with it to top the casserole.

This was a great dish.  We used left over St. Patrick's day corned beef instead of canned.  We also used Mexican flavored velveeta cheese to add a little spice.  We all loved it!

I love this, I've made it for many years. I sometimes use cream of mushroom or celery soup and I use double the cheese called for here. Also, no onion, and I put buttered cracker crumbs on top for more crunch.

This was very good!  Next time I will splurge and get real corned beef from the deli though, I'm not crazy about the canned stuff.  Also, I did use all 8 oz of velveeta as suggested - very yummy.  You could even use this as a base for tuna, ham, or chicken casseroles.

I just used this recipe as more of a guide. Used cream of celery soup, a package of no-name mac and cheese(plus some whole wheat bowties as it didn't seem like quite enough) pasta. I used the KD cheese instead of velveeta, which I have never heard of. Like others suggested, I used only 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs.

It turned out really yummy. Reminds me of a cross between tuna casserole and corned beef hash. Mmm.. Good left alone, or with some ketchup and pepper on it. Just as good leftover. Will totally make this again if I ever find myself with only with a can of soup, some KD and a can of corned beef... :)

Hubby loves corned beef, but I am not a big fan.  I did enjoy this though!  As others suggested I used cream of mushroom soup and doubled the velveeta and also cut the bread crumbs in 1/2.  I used 12 oz of noodles, 1 lb sliced corned beef from the deli counter and 1 1/2 cups milk.  We will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!

WOW, some people can be so harsh in their comments.  I have been making this recipe for years.  My Mother-In-Law gave it to me when I first got married (13 years ago).  This is definetely a family favorite.  I have never found it to be overly salty or too heavy?  I use the reduced fat canned corned beef and serve with a nice big salad.

This is nearly the same recipe my Mom made for me every birthday.  We always got to choose what we wanted for dinner, and this was always my selection, even as an adult.  The only difference is we used cream of celery soup and 8 oz. cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta.  It's soooo good!  Plain and simple palate pleaser...nothing fancy, just good.  Wish my Mom was still here to make it for me one more time.

This has been one of my favorites since I was a little girl.  Using Homemade noodles makes all the difference.  I also usually top with crushed potato chips instead of breadcrumbs, and also use a little more cheese (1 1/2 cups).  Yummm

This is a great way to use left over corned beef. I made one last night and used the left overs in this dish tonight.  I did take some advise from previous reviewers and doubles the amount of cheese and used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken...  Definitely will make again!

This was very good!  It's a great use for left over corned beef.  We had some extra pasta (12 oz. vs. 8 oz.), so I upped the milk to 1 1/4 c.  I used a bit more cheese as well.  We also used reduced fat Velveeta, low fat cream of chicken and 1% milk.  Worked great!

This is one of my all time favorites that I grew up on. I stick to cream of chicken for the soup, and always Velveeta for the cheese, no onion, although I always cook with onion, just not with this. I've also always had it with plain Lay's potato chips, crushed on top, before baking! Yum! I love the canned corned beef for this, and I make reg corned beef regularly, but the canned is great for this! This is a no fail recipe & great for potlucks & company!! Try it!! :)

This is an all time family favorite. I use at least  8ounces of velveta and crushed crackers for topping. I chop up my onions and boil with the noodles. Makes them more tender but still adds flavor.

I had lots of leftover corned beef and wanted a new recipe to use it up.  Based on other reviews, I doubled the amount of  cheese.  This is way too rich, too salty, and too heavy, for my taste, and I think it would be even with the recipe's amount of cheese.  Combining canned cream soup with processed cheese might just make a good plastic, but not good eats. My 9-yr-old son, who loves mac-and-cheese gave it a "I'll eat it once, mom, but do not make it again".  So, this recipe is a "no" for us.

Ok, this was really yummy.  I made a few modifications based on the fact the recipe seemed really bland.  I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, skipped the chopped onion and added 1 tbsp onion powder, 1 tbsp chili powder, and 1 tbsp prepared yellow mustard.  So good, creamy and comforting!

Someone posted that it gets better overnight or leftover. It is because it finally breaks down and makes a sauce as you reheat it. It was pretty gross when first prepared as the cheeses and chunks of canned beef stay segregated. Try omitting the bread crumbs completely. Use a teaspoon or so of dry minced onion- or more if you use finely minced fresh. Forget about baking it as the little bit of browning on the topping is not worth the time. Cook your noodles and drain. Combine everything else in a sauce pan (add cheese last) then stir and heat until it is desired thickness. Mix in with noodles and eat. Also I think canned corned beef of today is too fatty and not what your mom was using. I won't be buying canned beef ever again. Read the label on that stuff and see the weight relations of protein, salt, and fat. I think it was 1 part salt, 7 parts fat and 14 parts 'protein'. There is very little meat there. Thanks for the recipe as it was a step back into childhood!

I have made a little different version of this recipe, I used a can of cheese soup instead of the velveeta, a can of cream of chicken soup,a can of milk and no bread crumbs. Also I put in whatever vegetable that I have leftover from the previous nights dinner.

This was one of my favorite meals growing up. However, my mother would put Ruffles chips instead of the dry bread crumbs and cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken. So good!

I was a little concerned with the canned meat but in the end, I added minced garlic, paprika, chili powder and some cayenne, and this was pretty good.

This was even better than i thought...i added a couple teaspoons of minced garlic and half a green pepper, i opted out the carrots/ milk and added a can of green beans and half a can of corn i had open in the fridge!!! i simmered the chicken breast in 2 cups of chicken broth and used the juices in the same pot when i added the soup..this recipe is a keeper....

With so many mixed reviews we had to try this one out. It was a very tasty down home casserole and a terrific way to use up left over corned beef.

Made this from the left over Glazed Corn Beef Roast recipe submitted by CANMAD7. The apricot glaze added more flavor to the casserole. Its a great recipe to make with left over corn beef. I am adding this recipe to my collection. Thanks for sharing!

I thought it was just "okay". My husband hated it and my son refused to taste it. I was a little disappointed becasue I expected it to come out great, since we liked all of the ingredients. Not sure what went wrong.

Not sure if I would make with canned 
corn beef. I believe it would be much
better with cooked corn beef. Also a little bland. Needs some spicing up.

When I saw Velveeta and canned corned beef, I thought uh-oh.  But it was easy so I tried it.  My husband and I couldn't believe how delicious this casserole is!  I'll be making it many, many times!

OK, it sounds really funky, but if you like corned beef, you will like this casserole.  My husband loved it, which is amazing.  Comfort food at its finest!!

A family favorite. Very easy to make. This casserole is a hearty, stick to your ribs dish for those cool autum nights. The only changes I made is to use shredded cheddar instead of Velvetta.

Um, the corned beef in a can is disgusting. However, this didn't taste horrid but next time I will use hamburger or elk burger.

I have never made a casserole before that there are no leftovers (I always use the same pan).  Used cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken.  Used crumbled up townhouse crackers and doubled my velveeta.  Also added some chili powder to taste.

The only one who liked it was my husband- but that's not saying much.  Even the baby who eats everything only ate 3 bites.  Sorry...it just was not good and I won't make it again.
