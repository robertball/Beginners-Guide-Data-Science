Seriously...this flan turned out great! I've never made a flan, ever , much less one sitting on top of a chocolate cake. I didn't even have a pan for it, so I picked one up at Kroger's for like $8. It worked out great. I cooked it for 1 hour 30 minutes, and like Kathy F. Suggested, I left the flan in the roasting pan 10 minutes 1st and then put it on a wire rack to cool an additional 15 minutes before transferring it to a plate. It's going to work out nicely for my dinner party tomorrow night. ;)

This cake is sooooooooo good !!! Made it exactly as written. Used a rose pattern bunt cake pan. Only had to bake it for 1 hour and 25 min, I let it sit in the hot water after I took it out of oven for another 10 min like I do when making regular flan. I then transferred the bunt pan to a wire rack let cool for about 15 min then inverted. I made this for a picnic we were having the next day so letting it cool and sit overnight worked perfect for me. I bought a foil roasting pan to hold the water and the bunt pan worked out perfect. You wont be disappointed in this flan cake !!

I'd been questing after a good chocolate flan cake recipe after we had it had a party, my family and I LOVED it, but the person who made it was all secretive about the recipe and wouldn't give it up!  (Party-pooper!  A good recipe is MEANT to be shared!)  The reviews on this recipe here looked outstanding so I gave it a whirl!  I must admit, initially I thought two hours (is that possibly a *typo* on the recipe-provider's part? Two hours???) seemed like a really long time to back a cake and not over-bake it, so I monitored it closely while I was baking mine.  I don't know if different oven heating/bake times can vary THAT much that everyone here seems to have such differing results...but after one hour, mine was done, toothpick came out with just a few crumbs on it, and I can't imagine letting the cake go another 30 minutes, let alone another hour without ruining the whole thing!  So my only caution would be for you to watch your cake closely the first time you make it to see what your oven's bake time will be on it.  On hour was perfect for mine.  I also did the 10 minutes continued sitting in the hot water after taking out of the oven, and an additional 15 minutes on a wire rack as others suggested here, before inverting the cake onto a plate.  Then I immediately put it int he fridge to chill.  The caramel absorbs into the cake and voila! The cake was perfection!  Took it to a gathering and it was a total hit!  :)

This cake is fantastic almost exactly how the directions say to do it. People that are saying it's done in an hour...I just don't see how they're getting the flan cooked through at 350?  Maybe they don't realize their flan isn't cooked like it should be. Bake it for 2 hours exactly like the recipe says to do! The key is that water at 2". Get your ruler out! If you put your cake pan in a roasting pan (I used the roasting pan we use for our turkey during Thanksgiving) 2" of water will actually be enough, so that the cake pan floats in the water. It's almost impossible to burn something at 350 when it's floating in water. That nice slow bake makes everything turn out PERFECT in texture. Don't skimp on the time!

One other key is to make sure you pour everything slow into the cake pan and evenly distribute it. If you pour to fast or everything in one spot it won't settle like it should to get that nice separation.

The only change I made to the recipe was I used Cajeta instead of Caramel sauce. It's like a Mexican caramel made from goats milk that can usually be found at most major grocery stores. I highly recommend it instead of the smuckers for that legitimate Mexican feel!

This cake is delicious! Very moist, and the flan gives it the perfect sweetness. Perfect the way it is. I didn't change a thing in this recipe.  I feel that people who rate and then change ingredients are not being accurate or fair to the cook who sends it in.

Easy Recipe with Amazing Results! 

I combined this recipe with the Cola Cake recipe on this website. It requires less ingredients and the cake mix floats a lot quicker due to carbonation. I also recommend liquifying the cream cheese. That way you don't have to deal with a chunky flan mix. Lastly,put aside that American Caramel and replace it with Dulce de Leche. You'll be glad you did.

I did leave it for 2 hours as the recipe said and the flan did not go to bottom and cake mixture did not rise... Also cake mixture did not cook or set it was still batter. And I have a relatively new oven that normally cooks things rather fast, I also have made several cheese flans in my lifetime.

If you ever hope to bring anything else to any potluck or event EVER, do not make this cake!  It is so easy, and so good, you will be asked for every event to make this cake.  That being said, it is VERY good, and I always get comments and requests for the recipe.

This is my first flan cake. We don't have caramel topping in my area, so I prepared a homemade one following a recipe from another website.
I didn't find devil cake mix so I used the fudge cake mix instead.
This cake turned out great and I loved the balance of the flan to cake amount.
I made one large cake. You can check the photo.
This is so good and will make again for sure.

Delicious but more of a cheesecake than a flan. Traditional flan does not include cream cheese so this made the flan part more dense and creamy. It was still a huge hit with everyone, myself included. I wish that the flan part and the chocolate part was more incorporated, like a marble cake, because it felt like I was eating two separate cakes because you'd have to take a bite of each separately because the layers are so thick that you can't get them both in one bite. If you're making this for the first time, a few things that surprised me: when you pour the flan batter in the pan, it'll look like it's mixing into the chocolate batter. It's not, the flan batter will sink to the bottom and the layers will still look great. Also, I didn't have a roasting pan big enough for my bundt pan for the water bath so I used my biggest and deepest skillet and it worked great. And I thing I'm the only one whose cake required the full two hours! The only thing about the recipe that I changed was that I didn't use caramel for the topping, I made a traditional flan topping of caramelized sugar. I would not recommend this because it was a PITA cleaning it out of the curves of the pan. Next time I'll do the caramel!

Super moist and delicious! Made this just like the recipe said and it came out amazing. The only change was I only left it in the over for 1 hour and 30 minutes and it was more than ready. I had not problem getting it out of the pan. Definitely recommend eating it chilled so the flan is firmer. My boyfriend doesn't really like chocolate cake but for some reason he has not been able to stop eating this one. Turns out he loves flan too :)

I don't usually throw up 5 stars, but this recipe definitely deserves it. 
I followed the recipe as is but baked at 350 for 125-130 minutes. Removed from oven and let sit in the pan/water bath for 10 mins, removed and placed on rack for 10 more mins. Removed foil and inverted onto a plate without issue. Chilled overnight. I couldn't resist eating a big slice for breakfast. Delicious! Even my husband who dislikes flan loved this cake.

I made this yesterday.  I only had a Pampered Chef stoneware flute plan and was concerned about using that in the oven in a pan of water.  But no problems.  Mine did not take 2 hours to bake; only 1:20.

I made the cake with the exact ingredients - no changes.  The cake came out great.  It is a beautiful presentation.   It looks just like the photo.   I took it to work today.  Everyone loved it.  I especially like how moist it came out.

This was a really good cake.  I made it for my colleague’s Birthday at work.  (Easy to transport and no frosting to worry about). Everyone liked it a lot and complimented it even days after.  I followed the recipe exactly, cooking it for the full two hours in a disposable roasting pan with two inches of water.  The cake was very moist and the flan part was perfectly done.  Making it again for my family.  It is not difficult but you have to have a good chunk of time to make, cook, cool and then chill this cake.

The only reason I’m giving this recipe five stars is because the OWNER of that picture is part of my family. Her Instagram is @sweetsbyyolyy and it upsets me that’s somebody would steal her art and passion without even crediting her ?? She works too  hard to have somebody steal her stuff like this.

I only cooked cake 1hr 40 mintues. Started checking about 1.5 hrs into cooking, I was afraid it would over cook chocolate cake.  It was done by this time.
I made my own caramel sauce (1/2c heavy cream 1/2 2% milk, 2c packed brown sugar and 8 Tbl spoons butter, 2 Tbl vanilla and a pinch of salt) cook on stove top med hi heat, stir constantly for 10-12mins or desired thickness is achieved.  There is plenty left over for ice cream topping later.   I also made a whipped cream to top off this cake.  1 cup heavy cream and some of the  caramel sauce that I made mix with beaters.  Whipped cream makes everything better!

So I have made this recipe many times now. I have tried it in several different shaped pans, and it has come out great every time! The first few times I used the devil's food cake mix, but have also used others. They all work. I have especially loved the carrot cake; it's like having the ultimate cream cheese icing. For Valentines day, I tried it with red velvet cake.  It dyed the flan portion pink!  Kind of a fun and unexpected side effect for the holiday. Next time I make this recipe, I'll be sure to post a picture.

I made this for the 2nd time today.  this time I subbed buttermilk for the water and butter for the oil and only used 3 eggs. After 1 hour of baking, the chocolate cake was not set in the middle. I baked it for 40 more minutes and it came out perfect.  Per other reviews, I let the cake sit in the water bath for 10 minutes and then put on a cooling rack for 15 minutes. Inverted, topped with almonds and put in the fridge.

I did use carjeta instead of the caramel topping, which is awesome stuff!

I sprayed my pan with Bakers Joy, even though it said the pan was non stick. I just wanted to be sure!

I have made this with the chocolate cake and with just the flan. 

My husband is from Mexico and so are all of his friends. I made this one night and he took the leftovers to work. No one believes I made it that's how good it is. 

I made it for his father's birthday, the flan only, and his father said it is restaurant good. His step mother thought there is no way a white girl made this. They said their people (Mexicans) can not make it that good.

This is the highest compliment I can give this reciepe. It is so very easy to make and it is so good no one believes it's not from a restaurant or bakery.

Excellent base recipe that you can make your own.  I made my own chocolate chip bundt cake recipe  (remember to mix chips with a bit of flour before adding to batter) and followed flan recipe exactly. the flan turns out dense which works well as a cake layer.  The way the flan sinks to bottom is amazing! Presentation is gorgeous and tastes just as good. Baked 1 hour 25 min was perfect. Easy to remove from pan and delicious.

Epic fail when removing from the pan!  I baked the cake for 1 hour 15 min as others suggested.  It tested done so I removed it from the oven and put it on a rack for 15 minutes then inverted it onto a plate.  When I did, the cake cracked apart. I really think there needs to be a longer cooling period before removing from the pan. Next time I'll cool the cake in the pan for an hour, then place it in the refrigerator overnight in the pan. Maybe before serving set the pan in some warm water to loosen the caramel before inverting onto a plate.

I followed this recipe to a T, I didn't add or subtract anything, I Baked it for 1-1/2 hr and let it cool per instructions. It turned out exactly like the picture, and I was sooo excited to taste it! I had guests and we ate a piece, waiting for that umm umm good experience. We never got it. Even though the cake was moist and beautiful, it tasted like an ordinary packaged cake mix cake, and the fab looking flan was just okay, I thought. I wasn't impressed!
I might make a scratch cake, and a bit more of a cream cheese type flan if i did it again.

My flan mixture didn't seep down to the bottom of the pan and it was just a mixture of chocolate cake and flan.

We had some guests over. They loved it. The children didn't like the flan. I followed the recipe, except it only took 55 minutes to cook the cake. I left the flan to cook in the hot water for 20 minutes after taking it out of the oven.

Great recipe, the first time I made it everything came out perfect.  The next 2 times I made it, it split in 4 pieces after inverting it.  Don't know what went wrong.

Best flan cake ever. 
Cook as directed full 2 hrs.  
I see that the recipe writer wrote the cake mix box size and amt of oil to use in cake incorrect,  but just follow recipe on the cake box for the cake part.
My kids and friends love this cake. 
I've only made it 8 times but every time its perfect.

I followed the exact recipe, except for one difference while baking it - I added the flan mix to the pan first and baked it at 425 for 20 minutes. I then added a 15 oz Devil's food cake mix (added butter instead of vegetable oil) and baked the whole things at 350 for about 1 hr 20 mins. I also made my own caramel with sugar and water.
The cake turned out AMAZING! It was a party pleaser and a stunner to top that!

What does this mean?
Place piece of rolled up foil in tube of pan to prevent cake from baking over top. 

Coat piece of foil with no-stick cooking spray. Cover pan, coated side down, tightly with foil. Place pan in large roasting pan. Pour hot water into roasting pan to a depth of 2 inches.

Follow the recipe and it will come out great. My poker group loved it. Not overly sweet. Flan is a little dense and more like a cheese cake.

FAN.TAS.TIC!  I made this for a party and got rave reviews, inspired me to make it again to take on a camping trip and got raves from a whole new group of people!  I don't normally make things that require a box cake, but this one is a keeper.  Easy, delicious, and it keeps well - I think it's even better after a few days in the fridge.

Perfect every time! I would like to know why some others appear more creamy, homogeneous and white than mine. I always follow the recipe to the letter. It tastes great and boyfriend loves it (he is Mexican), but I would like it to be even prettier.

I've made this flan cake a few times. It's a great recipe, and creates a beautiful and very tasty dessert. :) I use a simple bundt cake pan.
I think the one major thing I have to remember when making this, is to give adequate time for the cream cheese to really soften, so that it will completely incorporate when mixing together the flan. Otherwise, the cream cheese will be lumpy and inconsistent. I try not to overly mix the flan to prevent air bubbles or a grainy texture after baking.
I've had small cracking on the very top and towards the center of the flan, which I believe is due to the very top of the flan getting too hot (closer to the pan), so I need to add just a little more water to the roasting pan to prevent the custard from cracking. If it does a little, I spoon in just a touch of caramel sauce to fill in and disguise. 
My electric oven cooks more on the slow side, so I think a good cooking time is about 1 hour 20 minutes. I know that everyone's ovens vary in temperature, so it's probably wise to check in maybe an hour or so. I hope this helps!! Enjoy making and eating this amazing chocolate cake flan.

Followed recipe except I used Duncan Hienes brand chocolate cake mix, switched out water for coffee, added cinnamon and vanilla extract, only needed to bake for an hour and a half and everything came out great. Would substitute caramel sauce for dulce de leche the next time. There will be a next time.

I had never made anything like this before, but was looking for a “showstopper” for a party.  Well look no further because this was AMAZING. I didn’t change anything in the recipe. My cake however was done around 1 hr 15 mins. So I suggest starting to check around the 1 hr mark for doneness. I also took the advice of others and left it in the water bath for 15 mins on my counter, transferred pan to wire rack (stillcovered by foil) for 2 hrs, then put in fridge for another 2 hrs before unmolding (set pan in warm water for a few mins to loosen caramel before unmolding). . It came out beautifully!! Run don’t walk to the store to get the ingredients for this chocoflan!

After  reading the reviews, I removed it from the oven at just over an hour. I left it covered in the water bath for about 20 minutes, then on the cooling rack covered in the pan for 10 minutes and uncovered for 10 mins. I lightly loosened it with angled icing spatula before  inverting it on the plate. It came out so easily! Definitely glad I didn't bake this for full 2 hours, I think it would have been too overdone, Came out great! Nice texture. Used cajeta instead - I think next time I will use more that half a cup in the bottom of the pan.

I've made a version of this before. With this recipe I found the cake to be too dry.  It was done in 1 hr 20 mins.

I made it , and like how some of you said to keep checking on it . AnD mine was done in an hour and a half.  I tried sharing a pic but error on it . no complaining here , it came out better than id imagine . looks like a matter piece , so simple to make . and really not time consuming . I did not use a name brand cake product , I went with a generic brand .

I think the trick is the water, the flan can't over cook. I made this and it was about as good as it gets. I have never tried anything like this before and it worked perfect. Super Nummy!

Followed the directions pretty much exactly but since I had to purchase the caramel sauce for it I opted for Dulce Le Leche.  Outstanding!!   An amazing dessert and everyone raved about it ... easy to make as well.  Don't understand how people had trouble with the flan not settling to bottom of pan ... mine started sinking as I was pouring it in ...  will definitely make it again!!

So easy to make. Followed directions to a T and it turned out perfect. This is a simple good tasting cake that's kinda impressive with the (like) flan on top.  I would make this again.

This turned out amazing and was a big hit.  The flan sunk perfectly.  It only took a little over an hour to bake, not the 2 it says in the direction.

I've made this twice now. The first time I made it in a regular tube pan, did not let it rest in the water after I took it out of the over and the flan had lots of air bubbles. Second time I made it in a bundt pan and followed the instructions exactly. PERFECTION! Looks just like the picture!

This is an excellent recipe!!!  I followed the instructions completely and it turned out great!  My only suggestion is to make sure it cools completely because it will fall apart when you invert the cake on the plate.  I was crushed when I saw it fall apart but the cake still tasted great and my guests loved it and wanted seconds and thirds.  Even the next day, guests were asking if there was any cake left!!!

This was delicious.  The only thing I did differently was I cooled it on a wire rack for 1 hr (foil removed).  I refrigerated it overnight in the pan and unmolded it the next day.  I did dip the bottom of the pan in warm water to help loosen the caramel topping and it slid right out of the pan.  ***Note that they have down sized the box of cake mixes since this recipe was written.  I used a standard box of D.H. Butter Recipe Fudge cake mix, I think it's a little over 15 oz. now.

What a great cake  and a crowd pleaser! I used my Bundt pan that looks like a castle and not only did it turn out perfect with the flan on top and completely separated, but it is one of the most delicious cakes I have ever eaten. 5 stars all around for this one

This is one of the best cakes that I've ever made. I worried about the flan but it turned out beautifully. The only change that I'd make is preparing the Devil's food cake from scratch the next time.

Came out good!  Cake part was slightly overbaked/dry at 1 hour 15 minutes.  I would try to take it out at an hour next time.  Flan was baked fine at 1hr 15 mins.  Do bake this the night before because mine tasted even better the next day!!  Will try again!!

I've made this cake for several years, and never had to bake it for more than an hour.  It is amazingly good... so good that I've been asked to make it many times, once even for a charity auction!  Just be sure you have a 12 cup pan or else you'll end up with a mess and not this delicious cake.

I love this recipe, I needed to be creative and figure out how I could make this for three different events... So I took out my vintage Jello metal molds 6.5 cups (3) and measured out for each 2 cups of cake batter and 2 cups of egg, milks ect... had some left over of each (made chocolate flan muffins was a little work but worth it.) I put the Carmel on later ( drizzle ) look nicer.      !!!! I SPRAYED THE PANS REAL REAL GOOD!!!. put in the water bath like said (use hot water) and they cooked like in 45-55 minutes.(the pan for the bath was glass cooks quicker I think)  let cool and able to cut into about 25-30 pieces depending how you cut. I was glad to feed 90 people, we are going to make this for a fundraiser soon. ENJOY. OH, ONE LAST THINK I use Dr. pepper  in place of water for the cake mix.  have fun baking

Delicious!! My mother-in-law went to a party that had this cake and asked me to find a recipe.  This was it!  The cale was so moist and even though I'm not a fan of flan I enjoyed it as did my kids & husband. I know she'll be asking me to make this again soon.

This was fantastic! Not hard at all. I will make this my go to recipe for a company dessert. I did follow the recommendation to cook for an hour and half, then sit in water bath for 10 minutes and then rest for 15. I highly recommend this cake.

This was amazing.   Turned out just like the picture.   Everyone said the flan was the best they ever had and I agree.

AWESOME AND EASY DESSERT.  I also baked for 1 hour 30 minutes as others recommended and it was done.  Let sit for 10 minutes in the hot water bath with foil off and another 15-20 on a cooling rack before turning over.  Came out perfect.
