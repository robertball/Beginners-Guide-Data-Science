The chicken was very good. I didn't cook it in the microwave. I used the oven. I omitted the butter and sprayed the a pan with cooking spray. I pounded the chicken out a bit, it cooks more even. I dip the chicken in sour cream and then the crackers. I baked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.

was good, but nothing i would crave. I did leave out the butter, because i just couldn't see using it with sour cream. I also cut the chicken into strips and did it the oven. My 3 1/2 yr old really enjoyed it though and asked for seconds.

Super moist and yummy!  The Cheez-it crackers make this as good as it is.  At the end of cooking, I drizzled some warm plum sauce over the breasts.  Kind of gave it that "sweet salt" thing.  Thank you for this post!

My husband & four kids ate every bite, but I got mostly "nays" when I asked, "Should Mommy make this again?"

I switched up the recipe as well.  I did not use butter or sour cream.  I cut my chicken into chunks and dipped them in Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing then the Cheez-Its. I put a touch of Lawry's seasoning in the Cheez-Its.  I put olive oil in bottom of stone pan and cooked them at 400 for 20 min. My very picky kids loved them and are looking forward to me making them again.  This recipe I did makes it easy for kids to make this dish themselves.  Thanks for the concept because it turned out to be a winner.
