THE BEST PINA COLADA recipe ever!  YOU MUST PUT IN THE FREEZER OVERNIGHT!  You cannot go wrong with this recipe!  I used Malibu Rum instead of the mango flavored rum.  And I did NOT use the whipping cream.  I will warn you though, even with using more ice cream and more ice, you will NOT get the consistency that is in the photo!!!!  It's still runny (but still VERY good!)!  The way to remedy this is to make the batch in the blender and put it in the FREEZER overnight.  Then the next day when you're ready, crush the top frozen layer and blend it again.  That will give you the right consistency!!  I am keeping this recipe and will do it this way every time.  I've had rave reviews when I make this the past few weeks.  My new favorite drink!!!  Thanks for sharing!!

This was the best Pina Colada I've ever had, but i did tweak it a bit.  I only had Coconut Rum on hand so I used that, and added a bit more :) Then I added 1cp of coconut gelato (along with the 1cp of Vanilla ice cream). They both were @ Giant. I also used slightly more whipping cream and whipped until very firm peaks. I drank it all in two days. OMG  it is soo good.  One day I'll try it with Mango rum.  DEFINITELY try this recipe!   UPDATE:  I made this with the Mango flavored rum, and it was fantastic. Don't know if it was better with the coconut or mango rum since it was too long inbetween recipes. Either way, you can't go wrong. This recipe is delicious!!

I tried this recipe last night and it was not very good. The recipe calls for whole bottle of Mango rum which makes the drink (basically) all rum. And, the mango rum flavor makes it taste weird. 8 ice cubes too makes it soupy not creamy at all like a really good pina colada. I don't understand all the buzz. I wouldn't waste my time on this one.

Also did a version with brandy in place of rum, and a non alcohol version with a banana.  Very good

AMAZING. Did everything except the whipped cream. Don't think it needed it, it was amazing without it. The rum content seemed high as written (750ml?? a whole bottle??), used much less than the recommended full bottle, and was strong enough.

This recipe calls for WAY too much rum. I like rum, but WOW!  Even using half the bottle is still so much run for 4 drinks!  Coconut or pineapple rum would have been better. Use 1/4 the rum and more crushed pineapple/pineapple juice and you will probably like it better.

Creamy, dreamy, and almost better than sex!!~ Loved it!! I like a lot of alcohol in my "foofy" drinks, but some people might want to tone it down to somewhere between 1/2 the bottle and the whole bottle. Start at 1/2 and add until you get it where you like it!! I've never had a better pina colada-and believe me--I've done some drinking in my time!! LOL!!

Delicious!  Just like Wet Willie's in Savannah, GA.  I used half the amount of Rum and just used regular rum, the whole bottle is too much.  Also, used half the ice cubes to make it less watery.

I made this pina colada as a virgin "cocktail" smoothie for my son--big hit! I added rum for others in our family. We all loved it. I did not have the mix so substituted 5 oz. pineapple juice and 5 oz. cream of coconut as suggested. I used fresh pineapple which was delicious. I added more ice cream and ice to achieve the desired thickness. 
As for the alcohol...I suggest determining ahead of time the amount of rum you want per serving and add that amount to the blender. The rum can also be added to each glass after blending for greatest flexibility. I found this was just fine.
