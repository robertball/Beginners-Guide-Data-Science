I made three batches of these last night and this was the method that worked the best:  I let the dough mix in my bread machine but before it got the chance to rise I cut it into sections, shaped it and put them on the pan in the oven to rise.  It took about an hour for them to get to a height I liked.  Then I baked them until a decent crust formed, *then* I did the egg wash to give them color.  That batch was PERFECT.  The other times the bowls got flat, with and without the egg wash.  When I did the egg wash I literally watched them flatten before my eyes - it was SO disappointing.  Good taste, good texture - technique just needed a bit of a tweak and they were great.

My rating is only for the bread bowls.  I have made these twice in the past week.  They are very easy and so yummy!  Instead of a bread machine, I use a kitchen aid mixer and let the dough rise twice (once after mixing, punch down, divide and make rolls, rise again).

These turned out FABULOUS! I don't have a bread machine so I used my kitchenaid mixer. I doubled the recipe since most said it made smaller bowls. It made 8 normal sized bread bowls for me. I put the warm water, yeast & sugar in a bowl & let it get frothy & double up. In the mixer bowl I put the butter, warm milk, salt & then added the yeast mixture. Then I mixed in the flour. I kneaded this in the mixer for about 5 min. Then I covered with a towel & let rise until doubled. Then I punched down, & made into balls & put them on 2 greased cookie sheets. I covered them with towels to rise for about 30 min. but then I preheated my oven to 170 degrees & shut off & put bowls in to rise faster without the towels on. Then I baked them at 365 degrees for 20 min. My oven cooks really hot so that's why I decreased the degrees. Anyway, I served chili & creamy chicken noodle soup in them & it was awesome!

Only made the bread bowls this time.  I will probably try the soup another time.  The bowls were very easy.  I'm not much of a bread shaper, so my bowls were not so perfectly round, but they're homemade so it's expected.  They were a little small, and a bit flat, like a few reviews commented, but that's better for my portion control.  If you want bigger bowls, just make fewer bowls out of the dough.  Stood up well to the soup I chose to make, and they tasted good.  I even screwed up a little--somehow my oven ended up on 350, not 375 (I swear I checked it!) but they were fine.  The bread is basic, and bland, but in my opinion that's better for bread bowls, as the flavor is in the soup anyway.  They were perfect with my broccoli cheese soup.  I will make again.  ***Update 3/12/08:  Made the bread bowls again along with the chowder.  I left the bowls too long to rise, and they deflated, but I just reshaped and let rise again and they were fine.  I like the chowder, although it took a while for it to thicken.  I didn't add the bacon, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Nice soup!

Made these a few weeks ago...excellent flavor, though my boys are big eaters, so for a main-dish bread bowl, they're kind of small (I followed the recipe and made 6).  But for a Super Bowl Party with other food, they'd be the right size.    I'm making them again today and I divided the dough into four pieces so I'm going to have larger bread bowls.  Also, I increased the salt to 2 tsps and I use whole egg wash instead of just the whites...I didn't like the look of the white wash when I made them the first time.  Super easy and very well received by my kids...one other caveat.  Those of us that put clam chowder in the bowls had no problems, but the broth-based chicken noodle eaters complained that the soup soaked through the bowl too quickly.  Complain they did, but they ate every last bite!

Taste was great, texture was so-so.  Would be great for sandwiches however they are a poor bread bowl.  I went through 2 batches working with the recipe trying to figure out why things were so flat. Turns out there needs to be around 1.5-2 cups more flour to get the shape for a bread bowl.  I ended up using another recipe almost exactly the same that made 8 breadbowls but used 2 more cups of flour and 3/4 stick more butter.

I really liked this recipe. The only reason I gave four stars is that mine flattened out more like disks than bowls. I allowed them plenty of time to rise, though the temp may have been too warm while rising so I will adjust that next time around. I didn't make the chowder either, as I was anxious to make chicken and wild rice soup that night. Next time around I will try both the bowls and the chowder. Definitely worth repeating and perfecting ... I think it has five star potential.

My second try on the bread bowls turned out ok. My machine's dough setting is 1 1/2 hrs long so my first batch ended up overrising by the time I even took it out of the machine. It still doubled but outward instead of upward. In the bread machine, the dough should be allowed to go through 1-2 kneading cycles and then be removed and allowed to double on the countertop. I divided the dough into 4 balls and they turned out an ok size. The flavor was great but I had to tweak the instructions too much. I didn't try the chowder however. I made my own soup.

I followed this recipe exactly (minus the egg wash, cuz I didnt want to mess with the egg) and LOOOOVVVVE IT !! I used it the other day for bread bowls and it was greatI I let it run the full cycle including the rise in the BM and so they didnt rise as well as I would have liked when I shaped them. I just bought a baguette pan and used this to make 3 baguettes and they are to die for! This time I only let the BM knead the dough then I cut it into three pieces (for my baguettes) then put it in a warm oven with a bowl of boiling water to proof for 30 minutes. They raised perfectly. I have 3 BEAUTIFUL baguettes with a nice crust and soft and moist on the inside with lots of flavor. I used challenge taste of tuscany butter so it has garlic and seasonings and it adds lots of good flavor as well. I will recomment this recipe to anyone.

This bread is delicious and worked wonderful for the baked potato soup I made.  I made 5 bowls, rather than 6, and the size was nice.  They got wider than they did taller, but still worked well.  I should have spaced them out on two baking sheets, as they were too close together and "fused" at the sides.  They still worked fine, but just weren't as pretty.

My wife really loves her soup in bread bowls.  This recipe has become a real family favorite.  The kids ask for them and the wife often begs for them. Thank you very much for the recipe.

My guys came home from hunting too hungry to wait while I hollowed out the breads to make bread bowls so I served them as large rolls with my chili. Absolutely awesome. Will be making these again as rolls and some day as bread bowls.

Followed another review and didn't let the dough rise in the bread machine, but formed the dough and then let the dough rise once for an hour. This keeps the bowls from deflating. Great recipe!

I just made these except I don't have a bread maker so I just did it by hand. I did add 1/4C flour though, because it was too doughy. Other than that it's a great recipe! Loved them!

I only made the bread dough in my machine NOT the soup.  I followed the recipe as is in my machine and it was FLAWLESS!  I divided into 3 balls for good size bowls and let it rise for about half hour THEN added my egg whites THEN I put in the oven as told. FLAWLESS! I cut the tops off and added my own homemade sausage potato soup MMMMMMMMM!!! I made this before and added sloppy joe from the can and was YUM!!!

The two stars are for taste, otherwise it would have gotten 1 star.  I know this is harsh but I've made this recipe THREE times, two as bread bowls and once as a loaf.  It didn't rise any of the three times, at least not in the oven.  It rose very well when it was proofing but somehow in all three instances (two oven bakings, one breadmaker baking) it fell during baking.  Sorry, Darlene, the bread tastes great but I needed a "go-to" recipe and this isn't it.

I prefer sourdough bread bowls, but as far as non sourdough bowls go, these are awesome. My boyfriend loves them and requests them all the time. I've made them at least 3 times and I've substituted bread flour for all - purposes once. I actually like them with the all purpose flour! The egg wash really adds a great touch.

Not impressed.  Bread came out flat.  I tried the suggestions, but they did not work.  I have puffy pancakes that taste very bland.  I'll try a nonbread machine recipe next.

I just made the bread bowls. Like other people said, they didn't rise tall, but wide. I like that they are a little bland, so I can really taste the chili I put in them. Made w/ my Kitchenaid instead of bread machine. Next time I might proof the yeast.

I recently received a bread machine and this is one of the few things I have made.  They were delicious!  I made varying sizes of dough balls and the bigs ones didn't get as big or tall as I expected, but definitely big enough to fill with soup for a serving.  I've also made these small just for regular rolls with dinner.  Yum!

To have bowls rather than flat discs, after dividing into 6 portions, roll each out to a 10 inch circle. Grease oven safe bowls on the outside of the bowl with crisco. Turn bowl upside down and form disc around greased outside of bowl.  Bake these bowls on a cookie sheet  upside down in a 350 degree oven until lightly browned. Take out and cool for about 10 minutes (still upside down). Invert and shake off bowl.

I made these bread bowls over the weekend for my husband and mother in law and they came out great! I made exactly how the recipe states except I divided into three large bowls since they were for dinner and used the whole egg for the egg wash and only put the egg wash on about 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven. The bowls did rise but then deflated when I took the wrap off, but they still came out delicious and held enough soup for dinner. I also thought the bread tasted delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

I tried it twice without the bread machine and it does not rise. Must use machine I guess. I liked the taste.

The bread bowls are great, but I haven't tried the soup.  Just to clarify, the time for preparation does not include the time in the bread machine.  My dough cycle is 1 1/2 hours.  We also only had enough dough for 4 bowls, not six.  The bowls are really good though with any kind of cream-based soup or chilli.

Great recipe! Made a double batch for extra big bowls & cooked them in a loaf pan for extra height.

These were good but like others, they did not rise tall at all and spread way out during the rise resulting in flat bread bowls.  I still used them but they weren't ideal as they were so shallow I couldn't fit much soup in them.  Might try again, think the recipe might need more flour maybe,  Or less yeast.

Made these for a party tonight and stuffed them with spinach dip and chipped beef dip. coupled with the extra bread balls that I will slice to eat with the dip and a couple extra beer bread loaves. Nice presentation. My bowls also ended up a little flatter than round and tall. Not sure how to remedy that yet. But my husband is begging for me to make more for game day chili this weekend.

Perfect....they are so easy to make and come out perfect every time.  I do have a bread machine, but I use my KA instead because I think they come out better this way. I usually skip the egg wash, but that is just laziness on my part!  But everything else I keep the same.  The leftovers (if there are any) are delicious as rolls. Thanks Darlene for a wonderful, and easy, recipe!

This recipe was amazing! I didnt have a bread machine, so I mixed by hand and let it rise twice... I only cut the dough into 4 bowls though, when I did six they were rather small. I omitted the sugar, made it much too sweet in my first batch, and used a whole egg to brush them with .. The golden colour was perfect! I had to hide them until dinner time they smelt so good! All in all, an amazing recipe!

Rating just the bowls.   This was a fantastic bowl recipe.  I have tried various recipes and this was the best.  I will use this one from now on! Used the bread bowls for chilly and they were FANTASTIC! Thanks for the recipe!

These are amazing and I have used a number of different types of soup in them.  This recipe is definitely the one I will use when making soup bowls.

I only used the bread bowl part of this recipe to serve Cindy's Awesome Clam Chowder in.  It was fantastic!! and so easy.  I halved the recipe and it made 3 nice "bowls".  The texture was quite nice for the top and the scooped out bread so I broiled the pieces with a bit of low fat butter.  YUMMM.. I will be making these quite often.  I think they would be great for artichoke dip or creamy shrimp dip.  Thank you Darlene for a wonderful, easy recipe.

YUM!  Very good with a thick soup or chowder.  Would also be a great way to serve dips.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I only made the bread bowls, and they were so fun! Mine were pretty small (I used the amounts for six servings but only ended up with enough for five bowls), but perfect to fit inside a regular bowl. I made broccoli cheese soup to go with them and they were a good fit.

The bread bowls got mixed reviews at my house.  They were easy to make and I used my own soup recipe to fill them.  I will try to make them again to see if they turn out better the second time around.

This is actually for the veggie chowder. I didn't make the bread bowls. The chowder was AWESOME! My finicky 4 year old asked for seconds. Forgot to put the flour in when it said so I just mixed it up with the last cup of milk and then put it in. I also used turkey bacon instead of pork bacon to save a bit on calories. VERY GOOD!

EXCELLENT!  I did not make the chowder, so I can't comment on that.  I put chili in the bread bowls and it was fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderfully!  The outsides were slightly crisp and the insides were soft and chewy.  They were easy to make and I can't wait to try them with other kinds of soup!
