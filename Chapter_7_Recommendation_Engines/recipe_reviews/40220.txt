It was our first Dinner Party in our new house, and my SO's 30th birthday.  A doubly special event.  I received many compliments on this dressing.  One guest said it was much better then the recipe she had.  I prepared it the night before and let it set in the fridge for a while.  This really gave the cheese a chance to mix well with the rest of the dressing.  Be careful not to over fill your container (I used a cruet) or it will be difficult to shake up all the feta (it likes to settle into a big clump)

A good salad, however, one needs to adjust the seasonings to taste.  I've been a dinner guest at many greek households, and this salad was not as authentic or as refreshing as it should be. The McCormick's Greek seasoning is a bit overpowering.  I suggest experimenting with the salad dressing ingredients before adding them to the salad.

I added grilled chicken to this salad to make it a meal.  Also, be sure to add the Greek seasoning in the dressing to taste because I think 2 tbsp. would have been too much.  I used half that amount.

Perfect.  I only used half the olive oil because that's all I had and it turned out great.  I prefer my dressing more tangy than oily anyway so I'll probably keep making it this way.  So easy to make with ingredients I have on hand.  I'll make this often.

My husband said this is the BEST salad I've ever made! (I liked it a lot, too, haha). I did change one thing, though. I couldn't find white wine vinegar in my local supermarket, so I only used a small amount of straight vinegar. 
Thanks for submitting!

The flavour is great, just a little too oily.  Recommend adding less feta to the mix and adding more on top of the sald on its own.  Overall, it's very good! Thanks for sharing!

I could not find the McCormick spice, so I used the store brand.  It was fine.  I also used the whole package of Feta cheese.  It was great.  My father in law ate four bowls of the salad.  There was none left.  It was truly delicious.  We will be making this again!!

Everyone at our dinner party loved this salad!  They talked about it all night! I used bagged romaine for ease and the seasonings in it smell great! I will use this again!

Excellent recipe.  I made it according to the recipe except that I couldn't find McCormicks seasoning (sorry) so I used Cavenders.  Being somewhat of an herbal whimp I stopped at 1 1/2 tablespoons of seasoning and everyone at the New Years Eve party liked the result. Even the olive haters liked the olives in this greek  salad (funny how that works). There is a strong olive oil flavor (go figure) but this salad, with these seasonings, would be great with a lighter flavored oil only if necessary.  I made this salad because I wanted a bolder type of dressing and was surprised at the response.  Even my picky daughter complimented me on the salad. I'll be making this again.

This salad recipe was great! It was very authentic tasting. I will definitely be making it again and again. However I didnt use McCormicks greek seasoning, I used some local stuff.

Made this recipe for my dad for Father's Day.  He's picky about greek salad, but he and everyone else really enjoyed it.  However, I did cheat and use Ken's Steakhouse Greek Dressing.

Excellent recipe! I use Cavender's Greek Seasoning as I always have it in the cupboard, and I decrease the amount of olive oil. My olives of choice at the moment are ones stuffed with garlic that I get from the olive bar at my local Meijer. They are unbelievably good! Finally, I like to add a handful of arugula (aka rocket) to the Romaine, as it contrasts with and compliments all the other flavors so well.

My husband and I did not like the flavor of the dressing at all. It was really strong. It got thrown out.

I didn't think the dressing was that great.  Very strong olive oil flavor.  I added additional vinegar and lemon juice, a bit of kosher salt, minced garlic and it helped considerably.  Think I will keep looking for a better dressing.

Really good!  I cut back to 1/4 cup oil for the dressing, added a few more squeezes lemon and dashes vinegar, and it came out nice and tangy.  The boy said, "keep this for sure"...!  Might try adding some banana peppers next time, but all in all, a wonderful salad/dressing.

We loved this dressing - fresh and flavorful.  I cut the olive oil a bit.  Added mushrooms and extra feta.  Perfect with Greek Style Garlic Chicken Breasts.

I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out a good dressing to drizzle over cucumber and tomatoes (just like my favorite greek resturant).  And the dressing for this was PERFECT.

Great recipe.  Couldn't find McCormick Greek Seasoning so used Cavender's and it was very good.  Too much dressing for the salad in my opinion but this can be adjusted according to your taste.

Fabulous dressing, only change I would make is add banana peppers!  I was asked for the recipe by many guests.
