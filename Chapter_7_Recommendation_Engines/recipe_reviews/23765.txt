Very flavorful, with just the right amount of zip! I was only able to let it marinade for 1 1/2 hours, but it still turned out great. Towards the end of cooking, I chopped up a green onion and tossed it in the pan, then added about 1/4 cup of the red wine. I let the wine reduce and, after plating the chicken, poured it over the top. Served with broccoli and rice. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I used a Red Zinfandel wine for the marinade.  It tasted wonderful and my husband loved it too!

Wasn't too sure about this one as I'm not a really big fan of a strong red wine taste.  But this was really good, and the paprika and garlic salt (used a bit more than suggested) really spiked the flavour up.

This had a good flavor, seemed fairly filling for chicken (??), and was simple to make, except that I hate waiting on something to marinate.  It was also a surprise because I'd recently made a couple of other chicken recipes w/red wine and didn't like them that well, so I was beginning to think I didn't like red wine and chicken together.  The wine will make a difference.  I used Burgundy, and I've noticed two people who used Merlot and didn't like it.  (I hate Merlot so I wouldn't have tried that. LOL.)  I made it as is, except for all the oil.  I just used enough cooking spray for it to cook and not stick.  Came out a nice color instead of bland.  (Remember your monitor may vary. :-))

Easy, so so good. I paired it with a caesar salad, really good combo.  I also added wine in the pan when i sauteed it, to help keep it moist. To be faster, i butterflyed the chicken breast. cooked in about 10 mintues. great recpie! thanks!

This chicken really was A La Yummy! It had so much flavor. I had to use dried basil because my fresh took a dive but other then that I made this as written. The only complaint is that I was wishing there was a sauce. Next time I'll reduce some extra wine in the saucepan while cooking the chicken. I served this on a bed of rice with a side of sauted broccoli with walnuts.

Perfect!  No other word for it!  This came out very tasty and juicy.  This dish pleased even my husband and very finicky 10-yr old and they even went for seconds.  The true test, n'est pas?  Thank you for this one!

This was a decent recipe if you add your own touches. Alone, it is rather bland. 
I spiced up the chicken to my own liking and it turned out really good. I'm going to keep experimenting with it to get it to perfection!

I loved this! I was only able to let the chicken marinade for about and hour and a half, but it was so delicious and very colorful. I first sauteed garlic with olive oil and then added the chicken. I also took the advice of another and added about 3/4c red wine when the chicken was nearly cooked to add extra flavor and also create a sauce that was great poured over rice. I served this with steamed broccoli, very beautiful presentation.

Very good! I am not a fan of red wine but we received a bottle of Merlot as a gift which sat in my kitchen for almost a year! I finally decided to do something with it, so I looked up this recipe and it was surprisingly delicious! I didn't use basil though because I didn't have any on hand but it was still yummy and my husband liked it a lot too!!

This was very good. I wasn't sure what to expect, as I used a wine that I didn't like (to use up the bottle!). Great taste to the chicken. cooked with sliced onions and garlic. Only drawback was the color-purplish chicken is a little strange.

I made this last night and both of us were a little disappointed.  My husband and I love red wine, and it was my first time cooking chicken in it.  The wine I used was a blend of zinfandel, merlot, and cabernet (same wine we drink all the time).  I followed the recipe exactly, but only used 2 chicken breasts, so maybe I just had too much seasoning on each piece.  I must say it did smell wonderful and looked delicious!  But the flavors didn't come together at all for us.  Not sure if I'll make again.

I liked it but for people who don't like red wine I wouldn't recommend this. My boyfriend only likes white wine right now so he did not like the taste, it was too powerful of a taste for him. I thought it was delicious!!

A wonderful and soooo easy recipe to do, my oldest son adores this, it is his new favorite. I let mine marinate in the wine over night, and i just used a basic burgandy cooking wine. Worked out great, thanks for this one, it is a definate keeper.

I used a generic Italian red table wine from Bottàro, mixed up the spices a bit, added some thyme and oregano, and it came out delicious!  It was very easy to make, and the only real preparation I had to do before sauteing it was throwing a chicken breast in a plastic ziploc bag with some wine a couple hours prior.  I will try it with a white wine and see how that turns out, but I think the tannins in the red played a part in the taste and don't expect as good results with a white.

This was pretty good. I don't think I marinated long enough. I used a merlot wine, which I probably won't do again, it was too sour. I will use this again, I just think I'll adjust the recipe a bit, maybe using white wine. I also melted grated asiago cheese on it.

I thought this was a little bland for my taste.  I used a Lambrusco to marinate, and used fresh garlic, sauteed, instead of the powder, but still needed more flavor.  It was quick and easy, but I probably won't try this again.  Sorry...

This was surprisingly good! I waited to tell my husband there was wine in it, since he probably would have balked otherwise, and he thought it was good enough for our regular rotation. I did not change a thing. Thank you.

This was excellent. My 3yr old even loved it! I split the chicken breasts into thin breasts, tenderized them and marinated in wine for like 5hrs. I cooked them over med/high for 8mins and added TONS of fresh basil, 4 chunks of white onion and 6 cloves of crushed garlic. I went easy on the garlic salt and meduim on the paprika. I would definitely add MORE paprika, more onions and serve with mashed potatoes and asparagus.YUUUMMMMM!!! New favorite in my house!

Hubby liked it. The kid was okay with it at first and then wasn't thrilled as he continued eating. There was something missing...not sure what yet...will have to work on it. It was good though. I used a local Pinot Noir that I happened to be drinking this evening.

I wasn't too crazy about this one...however, I don't like wine.  I made it just because I was sick of the same 'ol and wanted to try something different.

This was surprisingly good.  I marinated overnight and cooked on the grill. The chicken really picked up the flavor of the marinade.
