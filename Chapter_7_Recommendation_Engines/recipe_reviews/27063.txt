I needed a quick veggie dish, and this one fit the bill perfectly!  I used 2 packages of the veggies, and doubled everything accordingly.  As per other reviewers, I used cream of broccoli soup and cheddar french fried onions. I don't think it matters what kind of cheese you use - I had mont. jack so I used that instead of cheddar.  I seasoned the mixture with garlic salt and pepper.  Next time I think I'll saute some finely chopped onion in butter and add that for extra flavor.  Will definitely be making this again!

I made this dish using fresh steamed carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower instead of frozen vegetables, and it was excellent.

This was very good and a recipe to keep! I adjusted as suggested by others to use broccoli soup and also the cheese flavored onions. I used steamed fresh veggies (about 4 cups) since I am not a fan of frozen veggies. For additional taste, I added about 2 teaspoons dry Hidden Valley Fiesta Dip mix which gave it a bit more flavor. My husband really loved it (and he can sometimes be a bit picky on his vegetables). You could also use any type of veggie dip or sour cream chip dip instead of the sour cream for variation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had to really fudge this recipe to suit the ingredients on hand when I realized the asparagus I had planned for dinner was no longer fresh but I didn't want just plain frozen veggies for a nice Sunday dinner.  I used cream of broccoli soup, milk instead of sour cream and seasoned buttered bread crumbs for the onions.  All in all it was still very, very good and we will certainly make it again, either this way or as stated.

This was an easy side dish to prepare and it was tasty.  It wasn't out-of-this-world but it was good.  I don't even think you need to cook the frozen veggies...just toss them with the other ingredients and throw in the oven.  The crunchy french-fried onions on top were the best part!

My family started a tradition more then 3 years ago we call "Meatless Monday" as a way to save money and to try to get the kids to eat more veggie. I am always on the look for new recipes with ingredients that I am sure to have around the house.  Like some of the other suggestions I used fresh broccoli and cauliflower and steamed them until slightly tender and left out the carrots due to the fact that I'm not very fond of cooked carrots :) I also added some famous essence to give it a bit more kick but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was delicious and will make again with the possibility of adding something more like rice, pasta or makeing it a meat dish ..

This is wonderful.  I used fresh vegetables that I steamed before adding them to the casserole.  It is great reheated the next day.

This recipe was very bland.  I followed it as directed and it left my tastebuds wondering if I was just eating cardboard.  It needs something that will pack a punch, like sundried tomatoes or saffron seasoning.  More than likely, I will not make this again.

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe and used condensed broccoli cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom as the other have suggested.  I used frozen veggies (California Mix, which contains all 3 veggies) and steamed them in a little water in the microwave for only 3 minutes before mixing them with the other ingredients and putting them in the oven.  The veggies turned out well, not mushy!

This recipe is wonderful! I had "vegetable medley" when we were invited to friends for thanksgiving last year. I just had to try making it myself. This recipe is even better than the vegetable medley I had at our friends house. I made this last year for Christmas, Except I used steam fresh vegetables, and also added extra broccoli because I knew my daughter would eat it if she saw lots of broccoli. Both my husband and daughter (who was 2 at the time) LOVED it. We've since had it as a "meal" instead of a side on a few occasions as well. With Family traveling to spend thanksgiving with us I have decided to make this, instead of green bean caserol and I have no doubts that it'll get eaten up. It is very easy to make, pretty hard to mess up. I've found even by tweeking the recipe a few times it always comes out delicious. A No fail must have!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I have also added meat.. browned pork chops in pan first, poured off excess grease from pan then followed recipe. Works well with boneless skinless chicken too.  Awesome and quick.  For those that like fresh vegetables, use about 6 cups of fresh carrots, broccoli and cauliflower and add to creamy mixture. Increase the cooking time by 10 minutes if you wish softer vegetables.. We like them firm. If you are not a mushroom lover, cream of broccoli soup works well too.

I don't use the sour cream. I also use velveeta cheese. I think cheddar makes it too sharp tasting. Velveeta is creamier and tastes better. I also add a lot more of the french fried onions because we love a lot! This is a must have side on Thanksgiving in our family.

Not impressed at all, I followed the recipe exactly and I just don't like it. It did look like it would be good but these flavors were all wrong for carrots. I would try again but with broccoli or cauliflower by themselves or with green beans. I won't make again as written.

This is a good, easy side dish to put together in a hurry. This is rich, so be sure to serve this along side a main entree thats not in a cream sauce, or something too heavy. Also, I recommend partially steaming the frozen veggies instead of fully cooking them because they will seem a bit mushy after baking in the casserole. I think basic frozen  mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrots, green beans) would work in this as well. Thanks for sharing! :)

This is very easy and adaptable recipe.  I used what I had on hand which were fresh broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. I put it directly into the baking dish, seasoned with salt and pepper, poured over campbells condensed cheese soup with cheddar and sour cream.  Baked for about 35 mins, did not have onions for the top but it was still very very good! will try the onions next time

I used fresh vegetables and I wish I hadn't steamed them first.  That made them a bit mushy They would have been perfect cooking in the oven with the sauce. I'm giving it four stars for the taste.  Yum ! I also added a little ceasar dressing to the cream mixture and subbed milk for the sourcream.  My husband had 3 helpings.....of VEGETABLES!!!!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  This was so good.  In fact I made a large lot & we cleaned out one dish & I am having the other dish for dinner tonight!  It was easy!  I used microwaved steamed frozen veg that are a new product out here!  I have a lot of these cos my mum gets them from the factory where she works.  So this was a great way to use some of them up!  I didn't really measure ingredients out.  Also used can of chicken soup instead of mushroom cos I didn't have any of that plus I don't like it anyway.  With winter coming to Aussie now I will make this alot.  Hubby doesn't really like broccoli but you can't taste it in all the sauce!  Yummm...  This is a must have recipe!  So you better go & make it now.  It won't disappoint I am sure!

I have made this several times.  It is very good.  I leave out the french-fried onions (personal preference) and add a few tablespoons of sauteed fresh onions instead.  My husband and preschooler even eat it without complaint!

I liked this, give it 3 stars, but it sat in frig for 3 days....hubby didn't touch it. I added leftover baked sliced yams, fat free milk, penne pasta, cooked til tender, mixed with hand blender and turned this recipe into a soup....Hubby tore it up.....he have it a 9.1 Thanks for recipe, we don't throw out food, not in this economy.

I made this to go with dinner the other day. I used cream of chicken instead of mushrooms because i am allergic. It was a wonderful change

I tweaked the ingredients a bit but this was a really good starting point.  I steamed fresh vegetables instead of cooking frozen ones.  I used broccoli cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom, and dry stuffing instead of the french fried onions.  I also threw in some sauteed squash, just to pack some more veggies in.  My picky 5 year old gobbled it right up (and so did I)!

This tasted too "i just put campbell's condensed soup on fresh veggies" to me.  Very "cafeteria tasting" if you will.  I'll keep looking!

The recipe reminded me of green bean casserole but I had all the ingredients and it had a good rating so we tried it. So much better then I thought and I will be making it again.

Very bland. The only changes I made (which I thought were reasonable) was condensed cheese soup instead of the mushroom and I made my own French fried onions. I added some garlic as well. The sauce was very runny, and there were tons leftover that are headed for the trash unfortunately. Perhaps steaming the vegetables instead of boiling as the packages instructs might reduce the added water to the recipe, and using the yellow Cheddar specifically might improve this but I am not interested in trying this again.

I was cleaning out my freezer and fridge and used this recipe. I had a 750 g bag of frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrot mix, I did not cook first just used frozen. I had a can of cheddar cheese soup, a small handful of shredded cheddar cheese and about 2 tbsps FF sour cream. I mixed everything together in my pan and seasoned with garlic and pepper. I topped it with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I baked in the oven with my pork chops at 400 degrees for 40 minutes and it was done perfectly. I found there was too much sauce so next time I would use more vegetables. Really good and fast way to dress up frozen vegetables.

I made this with fresh instead of frozen veggies as I see others have done, and just a warning that you need way more liquid to allow them to steam (milk in addition to the soup and sour cream). You also need to cover it and bake it a very long time unless you microwave the fresh veggies first. I used 1 can cream mushroom and 1 can cheddar soup b/c that's what I had for my double amount of fresh veggies; the cheddar soup worked great.

Yummy way to spruce up veggies!  I used fresh broccoli, cauliflower & baby carrots and used low fat cream of mushroom soup.  Would probably make this again as a weeknight dinner side dish.  Probably not something I would make for company.

It was just ok.  I added fresh garlic and onion to the veggies as they were defrosting for added flavor.  I used the stated cream of mushie soup, sour cream and cheese.  I didn't have the onions, so I used buttery crackers crushed with a little butter.  My kids, who love veggies, didn't like it.  My husband who hates cream of anything soup, had four helpings--more that he was hungry than he really liked it.  It just didn't 'do' it for us...I'm going back to doing veggies my way, with garlic, onion, and lemon juice.  Easier on the fat and calories, and a guaranteed kid pleaser (at least for mine!).

This was a great holiday side dish.  A hit with everyone, even my husband who usually doesn't eat broccoli.  I used frozed broccoli/cauliflower mix, and I used canned cream of broccoli soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Definitely a keeper!!

This is a great recipe.  If you like more crunch and color, add waterchestnuts and a jar of drained pimento.  I used cream of celery soup.

Sorry, but this dish is not to our taste.  I used cream of broccoli soup instead of the mushroom per the other reviews so perhaps that's where I went wrong. (also reason for the 2 stars vs 1 star)  So considering the change I made I did not like this dish.  It's edible right out of the oven while warm but not cold and even worse the following day.  I'm generally not crazy about dishes that require you to use cream of soups but was hoping this was different since it recieved such great reviews.  I made this for Thanksgiving for 20 people and more than half was left so will not make again. Thanks!

This is so yummy and super easy to make.  We made this twice, the second time using 98% fat free mushroom soup mix, lactose free, low fat cheddar cheese product and fat free sour cream.  It was still delicious and much healthier.  Subbing non-fat plain yogurt for the sour cream would work too if you are lactose intolerant.  Great recipe.  We will be making this many times in the future.

Oh my goodness, this is delicious!  I took this to my father one night when my mother was working late.  I made a few minor modifications to suit our tastes.  I steamed a fresh bagged mix of cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots.  Rather than the mushroom variety, I used cream of broccoli soup.  I also used cheddar french-fried onions.  My father ended up going back for three extra helpings.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow! This was fantastic. I only made 2 changes. I used fresh veg (the ones you can microwave in the bag) and cream of brocalli instead of mushroom since we don't like mushrooms. It was quick & easy to make. My husband went back for seconds. I served this with breaded pork chops. Next time I might add more cheese & more fried onions. I will definely be making this again. Thanks Toni! Edit: I made this last night for the second time & used a bag of frozen  vegetables that you can steam in the bag in the microwave. This is gross & fattening but I used 2 cups of cheese instead of 1 & used a 6 oz can of fried onions instead of a 2.8 oz can. It tasted a lot better this way. I basically smother all the veggies I make in cheese so that my husband will eat them. Thanks again.

This is a SUPER recipe depending on what you're looking for!!  I started using it last year for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  This recipe definately turns veggies into a comfort food!  And the best part was I assembled it the night before.  I did add an extra cup of shredded cheese and about 50% more fried onions just to give it a higher YUM factor for Thanksgiving.

We loved this. I made it as written.  I only added a little onion and garlic powder during the mixing stage. The sour cream makes the end result a little puffy and light. The cheese  gave a nice flavor throughout.  The best part was the crunchy top! Everyone ate their vegetables, which makes this a repeatable winner for us!

I made this using the “cream of broccoli modification” mentioned by others.  Also, I intentionally under-cooked the veggies in the first cooking step... just warmed them up.  Oh, and I added minced garlic (like I do to everything but my Cheerios).  It was really good as a side-dish to BBQd ribeyes.

I couldn't find the french friend onions at the grocery store so I went without. Maybe that was the key ingredient because this was a little bland. I did use a little more veggies than it called for, so maybe that contributed to there not being enough sauce to be significant enough.

My entire family loved this recipe!  I’m making it again this evening (which makes that twice this week).  So I didn’t have any sour cream so I substituted it with non-fat plain yogurt.  No one noticed the difference!  Excellent veggie dish!

I didn’t have frozen vegetables but I steamed whole babay carrots and when they were almost done I added fresh cauliflower and broccoli florets and steamed them for just a little bit. This was good but next time I’ll add some salt as I found it a bit bland.

I used fresh vegetables instead of frozen. Think I'd change to cream of chicken for future batches. I also added some additional cheese. Probably closer to 2 cups but I didn't weigh my vegetables either. Perhaps if mushrooms where present the cream of mushroom would be fitting taste. Otherwise this was a delicious dish that didn't take too long to make. (Longer for me because I had to soften the veggies first.)

Really good and easy. I double the recipe, add some garlic powder, onion powder and paprika, then bake in a 9x13 for 40 minutes (then 5 more with added cheese and onion straws).

If using fresh vegetables I would cook at least 45 minutes. I cooked for 35 minutes at 400 degrees and cauliflower nor carrots were done. I used cheddar cheese soup, which I though was a good choice.

very bland.  I used sharp cheddar and as suggested  cream of broccoli cheese soup. Other than that I followed the directions as written, Used frozen veggies that I thawed  than cooked for 1/2 the time recommended .  Eventually I added tobacco to give it some punch.  Don't think  I will make again.

Loved it!  Easy to make, the only change I made was to use low-test sour cream and less cheese to reduce the calories a bit.  The whole family enjoyed it.

This was a hit at our latest huge picnic!  I changed it up a bit with the following: 

Pasta - cooked al dente
Fresh carrots - boiled in the pasta water when the pasta was almost done
Fresh broccoli - dropped into the pasta water when pasta and carrots were done, cooked for 1 minute
Mushrooms - fried
Onions - fried

I mixed it all together with the mushroom soup, cheddar cheese and sour cream, and served it right out of the pot.  I saved myself a step by not baking it, and it turned out great!

I made this, but since my boyfriend is on a health kick I got rid of the sour cream, and instead baked it with cottage cheese for a just slightly healthier version. It turned out wonderfully.

Very good is a small sidedish. Very heavy and fatty so definately not for everyday - but this was good for special dinners or along side very lean food.

It was ok but I would highly suggest going with fresh vaggies and pre-cooking them, it tastes much better.

Very good! I made this and Prime Rib for the 1st time ever this Christmas 2006 and it could have been a disaster! But this turned out to be a perfect side dish that everyone finished off!(I didn't use the onion topping though.) It just helped make our Christmas dinner a little more special and any future meals I make this with, thank you:)

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner this year and it was awesome!  I made a 13x9 pan and my guests polished it off.  I followed the recipe to a tee and this one is very easy to make and very tasty.  In fact, my family decided it would be the "new green bean casserole" at our holiday dinners!

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved, even the kids!  I made a few changes: used cream of broccoli soup, and cheddar french fried onions.  Much tastier than the same old green bean cassarole.

Made this recipe with a meatloaf recipe from this site. Made exactly as written and it turned out wonderful. Everyone liked it. It comes out very hot, so my suggestion is to cook it before your main dish is ready and allow to cool down because you can enjoy it better.

The first time I made it I steamed frozed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots and I thought that the veggies were too chewy.  The next time I used fresh broccoli and cauliflower (the kind in the bag) and LOVED IT.  We now have this once a week or so.

This was good, only there were 3 changes that I made.  Instead of using regular pepper, I used a heaping tbsp. of garlic pepper to jazz up the dish.  I also used cream of broccoli soup instead of mushroom.  Lastly, I used a can of cheddar french fried onions instead of regular.  Delicious as a result.  Everybody enjoyed the dish.

Really really good! Even my 3 year old loved it. I used the frozen stir fry vegetables though, except I cooked them instead of stir-frying them. I also chopped regular onion instead of using the french fried ones. Turned out great; will definitely make again.

My family thought this recipe was great!! Really a nice alternative, and great way to get the toddler to eat veggies.. I used a 16 oz bag of carrots and peas, and then about a cup and a half of freash broc. - added a little extra sour cream... and baked.. Turned out really good.. When I went for seconds I realized there was none left!!
Thanks

I have this receipe however it has a few more items in the receipe.  Add 1/2 cup of good white wine, 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and a can of water chestnuts.  I don't like water chestnuts, but they do give the dish flavor.

I used fresh, steamed vegetables instead of the frozen ones.  This casserole also freezes and re-heats  very well.  Have had repeated requests to make this again.  Yummy!

A wonderful recipe in the 13X9 pan for a big dinner like Thansgiving I was glad to find a recipe that does not use Velvetta cheese. No leftovers after dinner.

This is a dreamy answer to my dream of a deliciously different veggie side!  People will wonder why they don't make this themselves in place of green bean casserole.  =) Yum.

Very Good & Easy!  My husband is the true fan of this recipe.  The only thing I did different was to use cream of celery, as I was out of mushroom. Will definitely use again and incorporate it into holiday dinners.

Great alternative to the standard green bean casserole dish I always make at Thanksgiving.
