When I open a can of chipotles in adobo sauce, I puree them and put them in the freezer, so i can take out just what i need at the time.  Wonderful, smokey flavor!  definitely not for the faint-hearted.  Wonderful sauce!

This was really good..  I did not have any plain yogurt though so I just used sour cream in place of the yogurt and it worked great too..  I use light sour cream and light Mayo generally, but this is a very good recipe as is..  We use it on our chicken subs we make at home all the time. mmm mmmm.

I agree with the other review-  lacked some depth of flavor.  I added some cumin, a pinch of sugar, and some paprkia-  just a little!!  It came out great.  Really good recipe!

Our daughter & her family were here for our Labor Day dinner. We made "build your own burgers". First, we seasoned the ground beef with Crazy Jane's Mixed Up Salt.We cooked the patties on the bbq, adding a thin slice of cheddar cheese toward the end. The buns were toasted on the grill also.The burger bar consisted of lettuce, home grown tomatoes & red onions (sliced),cooked bacon, sauted mushrooms (seasoned with Crazy Jane's), sliced avocado, dijon mustard & mayo & this wonder chipotle sauce. It gave the burger a nice kick. Our daughter never eats everything on her plate. Her husband usually eats her leftovers. Tonight, she ate every bite. Wow, what a wonderful dinner!

I was looking for a sauce similar to what Subway has.  I did not like the mayonnaise taste of this recipe.  What I did was buy a can of "San Marcos" Chipotle Peppers in Adobe Sauce.  I ran them through the food processor.  Then, I covered a mini-muffin pan with plastic wrap, and spooned equal amounts into each of the 12 cups.  If you do the math, that is just over a tablespoon per cup.  Toss the tray in the freezer, when it is frozen just roll up the plastic wrap, put in a pint storage bag, and throw it back in the freezer.  My next try will be simply to melt one of these cubes in a cup of Ranch dressing.  I think that will be closer to what I am looking for.  (Then I will go for the lime juice, cumin, etc.)

This is a great addition to any mexican dish, especally a burrito with black beans.  The only reason i dont give it a 5 is because i like my best friend's grandmother's just slightly better, but she wont give up the recipe.

My husband and I love pulled chipotle chicken from Costco.  They aren't carrying it right now, so we used this sauce on chicken with rice and beans- it was awesome!  Thanks for the tasty, simple recipe!

Short (recipe) but perfect just like it is. Especially to whip up real fast. And when you can't eat tacos or burritos without it again. You'll like how fast it is to make and ohhh so simple. Thanks!

This is fantastic!  Just like the restaurants.  I didn't have plain yogurt, so I used sour cream instead.  My picky 12 year old couldn't get enough of it.  We used it on steak quesadillas.

I love how simple this recipe is, and it does have good flavor by following it. I did add a bit more chipotle to it and a pinch of sugar and some pepper. I don't really know if those two ingredients made a big difference to it but its still really great! I had them on Steak and Egg burritos and my boyfriend thought it was great!

This was very easy and very good but I agree with other users about the lack of depth of flavor. Next time I make it, I will add cumin to see if that helps.

I made this for a veggie dipping sauce for some company. The heat lovers really liked this. I used low fat Mayo and fat free Greek yogurt, and added a couple dashes of cumin. Watch the peppers because two made it pretty hot even for me a hot pepper lover. I served it with celery and carrot sticks and they helped with the spicy heat. I do think a squeeze of lime juice would be great in this next time I make it.

This is a very good recipe.  I would personally have used a little lime juice and some spices like cumin, black pepper and cilantro.

Really simple. I added mesquite seasoning, cumin and a squeeze of lime. Did not have any yogurt so used sour cream. Putting on my chicken but is great on beef. Going to make a pasta salad with corn, black beans and other stuff and this sauce.

Great as is and so easy. For my personal taste I double the peppers and sauce and I add some garlic. This is great on (vegetarian) burgers.

This is really good!! I only used the sauce from the peppers (no peppers) and its still a bit hot for my taste but it is a wonderful flavor!! I also only used about half of the mayo, because I don't like it. This might sound silly, but I used baby cereal to thicken it- and it worked well. lol
I will definitely make this again and again!!!

Needs lime! And salt! Made it myself- love the idea, but I kept tasting it and it needed acid and salt. So I added them and it was great.

It was slightly bland, but with a little creativity and guided by my own tastes, this recipe is very good. I also followed the advise of another user who recommended freezing the pureed chipotle peppers in small cubes for later use. Good tip!!

Added a little extra adobo, garlic powder, onion powder, and a little salt to make it perfect.

My family liked this recipe but it wasn't something we crave.  I was looking for a little more depth of flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

Served with chicken quesadillas. Perfect, easy base - you can add ingredients to fancy it up some (cut mayo to half and go crazy with plain greek yogurt and sour cream. cumin, garlic powder, lime juice, liquid smoke and honey). Easy to make it spicy or not so much!

A good starting point to making a great chipotle sauce. I followed other reviewers advice and added a pinch of sugar, a little cayenne pepper, cumin, and black pepper. I used it on chicken quesadillas, delicious!

I just wanted a simple burger topping and this seemed to fit bill. However, it was too mayonnaise tasting for me even after tripling the chipotle. I ended up using it as an ingredient for the chipotle ranch dip recipe.

This is a good basic recipe. Instead of yogurt (because I didn't have any), I substituted it for Sour Cream.  I also added a tablespoon of honey and then blended it all together. My husband isn't big on spicy food, so instead of using the chilies, I just used a tablespoon of the adobo sauce.  It was excellent and the perfect compliment to my empanadas.
