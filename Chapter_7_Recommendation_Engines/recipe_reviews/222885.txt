I added 3/4 oz Three Olives Smores Flavored  Vodka to this.  Tastes like Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies.  Garnished with a Hershey kiss on a toothpick, like a martini

I made this with soy milk and doubled the soy milk (to make it last longer- I am a gulper!). Served it in a huge snifter with tons of ice. So good, better than any dessert!

Outstanding in taste-flavor, but not particularly attractive to look at from the top as some of the cream settled out. Using a blender instead of a shaker may help with the appearance. I gave it 5 stars regardless as it tastes outstanding.
