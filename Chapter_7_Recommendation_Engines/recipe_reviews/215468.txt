What a great and simple recipe! I made my own mustard vinegrette and felt the texture and taste of the sunflower seeds and carrots complimented each other very well. Not only is this kid friendly, it's healthy and adult friendly too.

This recipe was...hmm okay. Nothing really standing out as a wow. The easy of ingredients, direction and time was a plus. Will the carrots were extremely mild flavor against the sunflower seeds and dressing, a stronger flavored veggie would have been better. or a milder dressing. But it was just okay.

This recipe is super simple but tastes great! The balsamic vinegar takes away that sharp raw-vegetable taste and just shows off the sweetness of the carrots. Really easy.

Great and simple recipe. I added dried cranberries as a natural sweetener and extra salad dressing for more taste. Just what was needed to enhance the taste.

This recipe basically tasted like carrots with salad dressing.  (Which is more or less what it is.)  I probably won't be making this again.
