I'm adding this recipe to my collection because it utlizes ingredients that I almost always have on hand, my family liked it very much and it was easy to make.  However, I made a few revisions:  I added a chopped onion for more flavor; I didn't chill the casserole at all and it turned out nicely - the croutons weren't too crunchy or too mushy; since I halved the recipe, I only put it in the oven for 30 minutes.

This took longer to make than stated in the recipe and having to put it in the fridge for an hour is a pain.  My husband didn't like it at all.  My 14 month old loved it but my 2 1/2 year old would not touch it.  It reminded me of eating soggy bread.

This recipe went over very well with my family.  All of my 3 preschool children loved this meal (and that's very difficult to come by).  It was very easy to make.  My husband said that this was a keeper.  As a nut fan, he recommended putting almond slivers on top of the casserole.

This recipe was simple to prepare, but the end result was just okay.  It took longer to cook than the recipe said and it goes bad after two days.

I cut this recipe in half thinking this is alot of food.  It still was too much.  I noted some of the other reviews and did not let it sit for a full hour and found crisper croutons still didn't help this recipe.  Perhaps more eggs & broccoli would save this recipe.

Recipe is okay -- but is not particularly remarkable.  Probably won't bother making it again.

I hate to admit it but this was the most horrendous recipe I have ever made in my entire life.  I can't even describe the taste but it made me queesy and my stomach does flip flops just thinking about it.  Sorry to be so blunt, but even sorrier that I wasted perfectly good ham on this. I only gave it 1 star because there is no option for a zero rating.

Made as written except that I used mayo instead of miracle whip. This turned out pretty good. I think it could have used more broccoli for a better ratio to the ham. Forget about trying to fit it all into a 11x7 dish. It simple won't happen. With that being said, the one thing I did not like about this recipe is that the egg mixture stuck to the bottom. I recommend lightly spraying your casserole dish with non-stick cooking spray.
