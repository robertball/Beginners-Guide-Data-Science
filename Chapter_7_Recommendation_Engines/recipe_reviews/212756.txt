Great recipe, but had to substitute the paneer because I couldn't find it at the grocery store. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe! I added some extra fresh ginger to make it just right. I think I need to try a different pan because when I try to brown the paneer it mostly sticks to the pan. This recipe has become a favourite in our house.

To the person who used tofu instead of paneer, your "bland" review was sort of a no brainer.  Paneer is all the good stuff from milk etc. that would make this dish.  If you are going to review it, make it appropriately and don't rate it after you have substituted silly ingredients as if you were making the real recipe.  This was fantastic.  Highly recommend.

I found this very bland. I will not be making it again. I still gave it 3 stars because it may have been tastier if we used panner instead of tofu.

Wonderful flavor, but I think I may have overcooked the cheese. Better if just seared on all sides and not quite browned so it can still melt a bit... oops! I accidentally added whole fennel seed, so I compensated by adding an extra 1/2 tsp. of ground coriander in addition. I think I may also add more tomatoes, or a small can of whole tomatoes, cut up, if I make again. Delicious!

I love this recipe and have made it several times. I tried to cut corners once to save time by not frying the cheese first. This step is crucial, do not skip it! The fried cheese is so much better and it maintains its texture better in the sauce. The only thing I would change would be to add chopped fresh tomatoes instead of pur√©ed tomatoes. Yum!

I used homemade paneer, which was delicious. The sauce itself was fine, though s bit sweet for my tastes. I liked the hint of fennel but would probably add some cayenne or Serrano if I make this again. Since my kids (2 and 4) weren't especially keen on it, I probably won't.

Delicious!  Even my husband said the paneer grew on him after a few bites, since the rest of it was so good.  I will admit to eliminating the ketchup, as I can't stand the stuff.
