I found this recipes elsewhere about 8 years ago and I have made it at least twice a week ever since because my family loves it.  I did notice some differences though, I use 3 cans of Great Northern Beans, 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt, cube the chicken instead of "shredding it" & saute it by itself, use 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of 4 and after adding the cornmeal to thicken I then simmer the chili for 45 minutes, stirring very often to prevent sticking - The chili gets nice and thick.  I serve this with tortilla chips and I think Fresh Chopped Cilantro (although optional)adds another taste dimension to this Chili.  We top with shredded cheese and sour cream.  Add the Hot Sauce to your taste after the Chili is done.

This recipe was awesome.  To thicken the soup up, I added 3/4 cup sour cream and one can of creamed corn.  For added flavor, I added cilanto at the very end to kick it up a notch.  I served this with corn bread for a filling meal that's not too heavy.  ENJOY!!!

Very good chili! I made this for a small group of friends, and two people asked
for the recipe.

I cut back on the chicken broth slightly, and doubled the chili powder. Without
the extra chili powder it just didn't quite have enough of that chili flavor. But it's
very tasty.
those changes it's really great.

Exceptional chili!  I had rave reviews on this, and it tasted great the next day.  I did not add the cornmeal,I exchanged a can of black beans for the white beans, and next time I think I will add a little more hot pepper sauce and chili sauce for a little more heat.  Great recipe

My husband really liked this recipe, but I didn't care for the texture (with the corn meal added in).  I also substituted kidney beans, so maybe it's better if you don't substitute.

I changed the recipe a bit by adding some extra spice and using black beans instead cannellini beans.  It made great leftovers and even tasted better the second day.

I served this along with some other chili recipes to a group of 20 or so. The Chicken Chili II pot was emptied first, and guests were disappointed to learn there was no more. Not a traditional "white chili," this chicken chili has a delightfully complex flavor, and is the chili choice for those guests who do not eat pork or beef.

This is a great recipe!  I made it on a Tuesday night because I was having company for dinner on Wednesday.  I warmed it up Wednesday night and it was perfect!  Everyone loved it and I am going to make it again in the near future.  Thanks!

Enjoy this recipe.  I changed a few things.  Doubled chili powder.  Only used one can beans and added one can corn.  Simmered on stove for a couple hours.   Served with cheddar cheese.  Will make again.

This was a good base recipe but I found that it wasn't as thick as I wanted it and lacked some flavor.  I added at least 1 cup of cornmeal and about 1 tsp corn starch to get the right consistency.  I also added more hot pepper sauce than called for, 1 cup frozen corn and 3 cups of shredded monterey jack/cheddar cheese.  The end result was fabulous!

Perhaps it was me, but I could not get this to thicken!  However, the flavor was great.  I will try this again and take some advice from past reviews to thicken it a bit.  I loved the sour cream idea below.

It was a cold and rainy day here in Minnesota, so I decided I'd look for a chicken chili recipe.  I'm sorry I chose this one.  First of all, it turns out much more like soup than chili.  It's not thick at all.  It is also not spicy in the least.  I added more chili powder and cumin also added ancho chili powder and smoked paprika.  Then it tasted too gritty, so I added fresh lime juice to cut the grittiness.  That made it slightly better.  I dished it up over rice like someone suggested.  My husband and I ate two bites and looked at each other disappointed.  I said it's missing something.  My husband said - tomatoes.  Then I realized this chili recipe has no tomatoes.  How strange.  I added a can of tomato paste.  That really helped.  It thickened it and added flavor.  I should have stopped there, but I had many fresh tomatoes to use up, so I added to fresh chopped tomatoes.  That seemed to dull the flavor a bit, so I added more chili powder.  I dished it up and we each tried to eat it again.  It was better, but definitely it was still just in the okay category.  We discussed how it lacked flavor and I realized I always use some sausage in my regular chili.  So I pulled out two Andouille sausages for more flavor.  They might have improved it slightly, but it was hard to tell because by that point I had an extremely large pot of okay chili.  Uggh!  It was the ever expanding recipe gone wrong.  It just didn't work for me.

I love this recipe, but I do change it around every time I make it. I think using ground turkey works so much better and today I even added finely chopped zucchini to use up the boatload of zucchini I'm drowning under. It worked great!

This chili is PHENOMENAL!!  I was hesitant to cook the chicken as long as the recipe said for fear of it drying out.  So I cooked all the veggies until soft, then added the diced chicken and spices to cook for a few minutes before adding the liquid.  Regardless, this was a very yummy recipe which got rave reviews when a bowl was brought to a very picky friend!  I did use the cornmeal to thicken it, as well.

I used pinto beans, and it turned out great.  I also upped the spices by quite a bit, a couple tablespoons of each, but that may just be because my spices can get a little old and not as flavorful.  The only thing I would do different is only use 3, maybe 4 cups of broth.  It was way more "brothy" than was ideal.

Loved it!  My husband is from Texas & thought it was a sin to make chili with chicken but he liked it.  I followed the recipe but used 7 oz. green chilis a little extra cumin and cooked for about 45 minutes and it thickened itself.  I made lime/chili tortilla chips and a salad and it was a great dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really good recipe and great on a cold evening.  I did make a few adjustments - used only 2 T. of olive oil - used 3 T. of chili powder and 2 tsp. of hot pepper sauce. I felt it needed a bit more seasoning.

I left out the peppers since I live with picky eaters, and added a masa flour/water paste to thicken.  Yummy!

I added a can of diced tomatoes and I thought the flavour was perfect, if I make this again I think I will put the diced veggies through the food processor as my chunks were too big for my liking, this is a great recipe when you don't have much time, and it makes a tonne!

Great tasting recipe! It's a keeper. However, I'm not to sure about the cornmeal thing, I added it the first time I made it and I didn't notice it thicken so I've used cornstarch ever since. Also I haven't been able to even find cannellini beans so I use 2 cans of black beans. If you like a lot of flavor you may want to add more seasonings.

This was ok the taste was good. I thought it was too thin...more like a stew. I reduced the oil to 2 tablespoons and increased the meat to 1 3/4 pounds. I did not want to thicken with cornmeal so I used a little cornstarch.

My one year old and four year both ate a whole bowl of it! It was great. I only had green peppers, and only used two 14oz cans of chicken broth, which was more than enough. It was soupy and the cornmeal didnt seem to do much to thicken it so I added a little cornstarch. It helped and it turned out great. I sprinkled on some cheese, crunched up tortilla chips, and topped with a little sour cream. Will definitely make again.

After reading the reviews and making some minor adjustments to this recipe it came out great. I reduced the amount of chicken broth to 3 cups and used the cornmeal 1/2 cup. Also, I added some grilled corn kernels and diced up a grilled pasilla pepper. This add more flavor. I definitely be making this again!

What did I miss on this one?  I expect chili to be thick...this was very soupy and I even added the corn meal.  Flavor was okay, but I've had better.  Won't make again.

I really like this chicken chilli! I opted for black beans instead of cannelloni beans (it's what I had on hand) and I love the tip to use corn meal - I don't usually do chilli's with broth, and this thickened it up really well and it has a nice taste to it. Thanks for the recipe! I plan on throwing the left-overs on top of some rice!

Well I didn't follow this recipe exactly - used cooked chicken (leftover) added tomatoes and used almost double the beans called for - but it was very good.  I had to add more spices (prob due to extra beans) but it was great served over rice with cheese on top.  Everybody loved it!

I am a chef student and I made this chili in a soup cook off. Everyone loved it and I won the cook off. I served it with shreaded cheese on top and with homemade tortilla chips. It was a big hit!

I have never had chicken chili, only beef.  This recipe was ten times better than any beef chili I have had.

thanks for sharing!

Excellent!  The suggestion of using one can of black beans as a substitute for one of the cannellini is a good one.  I also like to add tomatillos and rice, and serve it with a sprinkling of cilantro.

As is, sorry to say it really missed the mark, at least compared to other white chili's out there and I've made a few.  The flavor just wasn't there.  I always like to stick to the recipe in the beginning as much as possible so I can rate correctly.  I did at the start but before eating, I had to double all the seasonings plus more to get it with any type of chicken chili taste.  The only other adjustment I did was adding a can of whole corn kernels, only due to only having 1 can of cannellini beans. Once doubling everything plus more, it did come up ending up witha 4, but remember not as is.

Tastes great!  Very quick!  I added a little sugar and some corn to add sweetness.  I like thicker chili so I used less broth.

The soup came out excellent over egg noodles. A little thin for that method of serving but rich flavor made me put up with the mess. No being much of a bean fan I substituted a can of corn for the beans.

I made this at a party with all women,and they raved about it.  Many wanted to go home with the recipe.
