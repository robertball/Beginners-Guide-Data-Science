I love beef wellington, but this is a wonderful alternative. Thanks, Andy. I would recommend placing the parcels on a wire rack over another pan to avoid a soggy bottom. Great recipe!

This whole dish turned out beautifully. I think the person that said it was difficult to keep all of the ingredients in the puff pastry either didn't roll the pasrty out at all, or forgot to put some flour underneath so it wouldn't stick. I made it for a dinner party and was congratulated on such an impressive dinner! I followed the recipe exactly except I reduced the amount of onion. You have most of the ingredients in your kitchen already. Try this one!

Tried this without the sauce, realized it was too bland. Asked my husband to wait two minutes and whipped up the sauce. With it, this dish went from good to excellent!

needs the sauce, and good mushrooms and onion. Red wine works great in place of the grape juice. Flour the counter before using the pastry!!

Loved this recipe and my husband and kids loved it too.  I did make the grape juice sauce and tasted it when it was done and really did not like that, so I chucked it and sauteed more onions and mushrooms till they were caramelized, sprinkled them with a little flour to thicken it, added 1/8 cup of water and some chicken soup boullion to season and served this sauce over the beef parcels.  It was amazing.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be a regular at our dinner table.  My daughter suggested that I make mini ones and serve them as appetizers when I have company and I will definitely do this as well.

The first time I made the recipe as is except the sauce. For the sauce I used beef broth, red wine and worcestershire sauce and cornstarch.  The second time I made it I added chopped green pepper to the mushroom mixture.  I don't put it seam side down, I like all the "puff" to be on top and not soaking up the grease. I need to buy a rack to get them out of the grease.

This was very good!  I had trouble getting the parcels to stay together but I think it was my own inexperience with puff pastry.  The red grape sauce tasted so good on it!

This was a hit in our house.  Hubby really liked it.  Did it pretty much as it said.  Used frozen sheets of puff pastry & it worked perfectly.

These are so good!! I didn't think the sauce was anything special and it definately doesn't NEED a sauce. I was trying to figure out how to use up ground meat I had in the freezer and still make something I could serve to company - these were perfect!

Aside from some difficulty keeping all the contents *in* the puff pastry, this was delicious!

We're always looking for new ways to serve ground beef and this was great. Very tasty and different.

Really good.  I used 1/2 an onion and even that was a little too much. I also added a clove of garlic and fresh parley to the mix.  The whole family liked them.  I just used a great store-bought gravy (not a fan of sweet sauces) and served them with green beans.

I cooked my beef patties on the stovetop, seeing as how it's just a bit too chilly now to grill. I cooked them until they were browned, and just cooked enough to lift them without them crumbling. I actually backed off the amount of onion it calls for. I wound up using 1.5 onions, and it was plenty! I also added some cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and sea salt to the beef mixture. It was still a tad bland, but the grape sauce was the saving grace!

200 degrees F was not enough to cook these in the time they were supposed to. Had to finally turn it up to 225 F. This recipe could have been a bit more flavorful but is a great idea in and of itself. I can see this sort of recipe working as a cordon bleu sort of sandwich or something like that even. This was my first time working with Phyllo dough and I also used the kind you get in the freezer section of your local grocery store. Do yourself a favor if you’ve never used it before and FOLLOW DIRECTIONS! Honestly, directions are not always the way to go I believe especially in cooking times. However, in this case it won’t work otherwise.

I ajusted this recipe for Our tastes,( just sauteed the mushrooms in butter and omitted onion, because lots of onion in the meat)turned out great, the sauce was just the right touch for perfection.

Terrific and pretty easy!  My husband said don't change a thing in the way I made it.  (He doesn't like mushrooms so I omitted them and used more onions.)

I have made this numerous times now. It is wonderful and my husband absolutely loves it. It is a little time consuming but so very worth it.
