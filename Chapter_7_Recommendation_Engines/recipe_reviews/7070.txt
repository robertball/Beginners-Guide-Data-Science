Injera is a a little tricky, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy.  You pan HAS to be at the perfect temperature or else ANY injera will stick.  It is designed to be laid flat on a plate and piled high with a thick stew.  It has a bland taste and a spongey texture, which make it perfect for soaking up rich stews.  You actually use it instead of utensils.

Authentic recipe & preparation. Injera is tricky to make, but practice makes perfect. Injera is a sourdough flatbread- that's why the dough sits for 24hrs, for the sourdough fermentation process. It is cooked only on one side; the uncooked side stays spongy & soft. And for 'accidentalfoodie': You are correct that teff and millet aren't the same grain. But you are incorrect in that BOTH are gluten-free. Gluten by definition is the protein in wheat. There is no gluten in either millet or teff. Teff is the world's smallest grain- technically a grass, native to east Africa. It can range widely in colors, is very high in fiber & protein, and has a sweety/nutty flavor. Teff is often assumed to be sour, as many recipes/preparations partially or fully ferment the grain (as is the case with this recipe, where it basically becomes sourdough). Millet is a name of a family of grains (also grasses) native to India and central/west Africa. They grow very well in arid regions, have a pearl-like grain, and are mild in flavor and high in protein. Toasting the grain before cooking or grinding for flour can improve the taste. Teff is sometimes considered to be a millet grain (a member of the millet family), but in the US, what is sold as "millet flour" is from a different plant than teff flour. Use real teff flour if you can find it-- it will give a more complex/robust taste than millet flour, which is usually pretty bland. But either one will work fine.

Loved this recipe. This bread is not intended to be eaten alone. Injera is used to pick up your food. Think of it as the ethiopian version of chop-stix! The spongy bread takes on the flavor of the food you are eating. Try it with Atar Allecha or Ginger veggies! I will hold onto this recipe!

This recipe is authentic. Yes, Injera does take a little while to get down correctly, but it is worth it. For those who aren't familiar with the spongey (yes, it really does feel and taste spongey) bread, it is supposed to be bland. Traditionally, the sponge bread is used in place of silverware to eat stews, curries and things like pickled cabbage. There is even etiquette for eating Ethiopian food  (when eating, you have to take care to not place your fingers inside your mouth) So, yes the bread is bland, but you don't just eat the bread. Please keep in mind that if you make Injera, you will also need to make other dishes to eat with the bread.

I tried this recipe with teff flour, and was totally unimpressed.  My "bread" stuck to my non-stick pan, and was impossible to remove in one piece.  I greased the non-stick pan... still stuck.  I added an egg to the batter to hopefully get something that would stick together (like a crepe).  It was finally possible to remove, but I found the flavor bland and lifeless.  Not a recipe I'd try again. (However, the teff flour made a fine addition in my focaccia bread.)

Teff and millet are not actually the same grain: Millet, for one thing, is gluten-free, while teff has gluten. So, cooking with millet may be one reason this recipe hasn't worked out, because gluten gives dough elasticity and makes it rise better.

I followed this recipe to a tee (I had to guess that step 1 meant to mix yeast in 1/4 cup of millet, add 1/4 cup of warm water, and let sit for 10 mins).  I wanted to make a couple breads that night so I took about 3 cups of the batter out and added an egg, about 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 cup of spelt flour (maybe a bit more). I cooked this batter as I would a crepe and the taste and texture was great for the stew I had with the bread. I left the rest of the batter to sit for 24 hours.

When I tried to cook the rest of it the following night, it just did not work and the taste was awful. Again I added 2 eggs and about 2 cups of spelt flour and this thickened up the batter and allowed me to cook them (it takes a while for them to cook so wait until the bottom is fully brown and flip them to brown other side). Even after all this, I still did not really like the taste, but my boyfriend did. 

My advice: If you try this recipe and get the same results that I did, try adding some flour and eggs to the batter so that you donâ€™t have to waste it. I also recommend halving the recipe, since, after adding the flour and eggs, it made at least 10 large breads.

this recipe was a distaster!  it the batter seperated out overnight, and was extremely thin.  after trying a variety of  techniques, never got one pancake with this recipe.  we're finding that other more traditional recipes discourage the use of stone ground flour (such as the millet flour recommended here).  teff seems to be the only one that will work, and if you can't find it, whole wheat flour.

Great recipe. Just a correction, as I saw that a reviewer mentioned that Teff flour is *not* gluten free... it *IS* gluten-free, and completely safe for celiacs.

The little girl I tutor was pretty impressed that I tried to make Injera. I learned at an Ethiopian cooking class that Injera should be made on a special skillet to get the best results and after using one I have to agree. Until I can afford the proper one I will keep trying but to be honest once you've had the real thing nothing else is quite as good.

Excellent!  It took a while to get a hang of making these, but after I got it figured out they were awesome.  I cooked each one for two minutes on my nonstick griddle, and covered them with a lid from my crock pot.

I made a few of the adjustments suggested by other reviewers, and the recipe worked beautifully. Before cooking, I added 1 tsp of salt and poured off the liquid that builds up on the surface. When cooking the bread in my 10 inch non-stick pan, I had to put the heat on high and use 1/2 cup of batter.  (1/3 cup was too thin and the bread tore easily; medium heat didn't seem to work as well as high heat.) I cooked each bread piece for 2 minutes with a cover on the pan. I was amazed how the bread came out spongy, just like in an Ethiopian restaurant. I used teff flour; I don't know how well millet flour would work. When cooking up leftover batter the next day, I found that it helped to put in more baking soda to get the spongy, holey texture.

I'm really excited to be able to make injera bread and my previous attempt at this was an abject failure. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly. Something is horribly wrong, I'm afraid. Adding 3 cups of millet flour to 5 cups of water produces something that is almost the same consistency as plain water...In this form, it did NOT cook up properly. When I managed to get a cooked flatbread out of the skillet, after adding more flour bit by bit and trying over and over, this tasted nothing like injera I've had made by the lovely Eritrean lady at Bloomington, Indiana's lamented Ethiopian restaurant. I'm going to see if there really is a difference in using a flour called "teff" rather than "millet".

I just could not get this.  Checked other sources they called for Teff flour, but what seemed more important, was to pour off the standing liquid on top of the dough; then adding salt, stirring and cooking by 1/3 cups on a very hot covered pan

I followed this recipe exactly using teff flour.  I have lived in Ethiopia for over 22 years and have eaten lots of real injera!  I have also tried to duplicate it here in the US but have never been able to get satisfactory results with using only teff but this worked very well on my first try and I am very happy!!  I agree that making injera is very tricky and I have shed tears over my failures when I was hoping to serve this to guests.  One hint that I have learned is important is to use a non-stick pan that is used ONLY for injera and simply wipe the pan with a soft paper towel before storing it, i.e., don't wash with soap and water.  I will be trying this again and hope that this wasn't just beginners' luck!!

I had the same problems as many of the other reviewers with the batter sticking to the pan. I carefully read all of reviews to get cooking tips. After an hour of work and many, many attempts, I was very proud of myself for finally getting two pieces out of the pan whole. I then tasted them. Bland does not begin to cover it.

Batter was water-thin.  Bread fell to pieces in the pan and the taste was god-awful, and I loved injera last time I had it. Every other recipe seems to call for teff, not this millet flour.

Would be a one star, but I'm not sure my failure was not rooted in the 7000" altitude.

Followed the recipe to a tee.  The few pieces I did finally make were bitter-sweet and slightly sour tasting.  No unpleasantly so, but not pleasant either.

Batter never emulsified.  Flour kept separating from water almost immediately after stirring.

Wound up throwing the uncooked "batter" out.

Had high hopes, but......

Has anyone tried storing the batter in the fridge (after proofing at room temp for 24 hours). Would be nice to cook a couple pieces a day without needing to mix and proof.
