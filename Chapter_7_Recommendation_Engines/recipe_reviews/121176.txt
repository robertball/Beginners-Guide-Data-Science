I used to have a stove top walnut brittle recipe but have lost it. I searched this site and couldn't find one, so I decided to try this one. What a disaster, my house smells like burnt sugar and I've just wasted 2 cup of walnuts despite cutting the cooking time way down.  Microwave recipes should always have the wattage!

This recipe turned out perfect.  The walnuts are a tasty alternative to peanuts, and being able to use the microwave was great because my stovetop is completely full due to canning!  I left the walnuts in halves, which it may be better if they were in smaller chunks, but it probably doesn't matter.  I am tempted to eat this whole batch myself, but I'll restrain!

Excellent recipe!  My family went crazy!  I had to cut the time back 1 minute for my microwave.  This will remain a family Christmas staple.  Thank you!!!
