Didn't turn out so good.  The vegetables were crunchy and the crust was half raw.  I would recommend stewing the vegetables, soup and chicken for maybe ~20 minutes before putting it into the 13x9 dish.  Not sure if I would use the crescent rolls next time. I might try using bisquik biscuits or buying pie crust.

Super Easy! I cooked the veggies and soup together before putting in the pan. The crescent turned out great. My husband LOVED the dish. I will be adding this to my list of easy dinners that are very tasty!

I gave it 5 stars for ease factor.  I added about 1/2 cup of fat free half and half because is seemed really thick.  I did put in more veggies then it called for though.  So that is probably why.  Easy recipe to use up those crescent rolls if you score them cheap with coupons.

Instead of baking in a casserole dish, we poured the ingredients into individual ramekins and baked with the crescent rolls on top.  Using crescent rolls really adds to the ease of preparing this dish!  So easy and super yummy, too!

This recipe was very bland. If I make it again I would add some spice to it.

I ended up adding a bit of chicken broth to thin out the filling, and as others stated, I simmered the filling before baking too. I ended up rolling out the crescent dough and made mini pot pies in large muffin tins. A definite hit-will be making this one again!

This recipe turned out great!!!  I used a can of peas and a can of carrots instead of frozen.  I used a rotissiere chicken.  Mixed everything together, put in 13x9 glass dish, sprinkled a little seasoning then placed crescent rolls on top.  Next time I think I'll add a can of green beans.  It was loaded with chicken and veggies.  Yummy and oh sooooo easy.

Quick and easy recipe for leftover chicken.  I used 2 cans of chicken soup and about 1/4 cup of cooking liquid from the veggies I steamed.  I also added dried marjoram,  thyme,  onion powder, and black pepper.  Hubby and son liked it. It's a keeper!
