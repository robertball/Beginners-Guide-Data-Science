I made this and it's delicious. I used chunky peanut butter instead of the almond. What a decadent breakfast with no processed sugar. Thanks:)

I used 5 tsp of peanut butter simply because I barely had any left and it still turned out great! Very good!

I had to substitute peanut butter and a chopped date for the almond butter and raisins since I didn't have them, but I don't think the flavor was affected much. This was really good, fast, naturally sweetened (which fits my diet plan), and as a bonus, even my kids loved it.  This is a regular staple in our breakfast rotation.

I thought it was kind of dry and added some milk after cooking.

I've been looking for quick, on-the-go recipes for work. I always end up rushing in the morning. It's hard to eat when I'm worrying about being on time so I usually just skip breakfast and it throws my whole day off. The soft texture and all the warm flavors filled me up fast and the nutritional value of the ingredients put my conscience to ease. I've got a new favorite breakfast!

I make this for a snack fairly often and love it, although I don't include the raisins. I add some high quality vanilla extract, which seems to improve the taste.  I also think it would be really good with some baked or dried apples on top!

This was good, but it lacked some flavor, what I taste is very mellow. I didn't have almond butter, so I chose to use cashew butter instead and it turned out fine. It didn't really rise for me, though. I would make this again, but as a topping for ice cream. or with something else, as it is not that flavorful on its own.

At first I was a little disappointed with the texture. I guess I had been expecting the typical "mug cake" or "mug cookie" baked texture. I used a 14oz mug and it overflowed, so be sure to use a bigger mug. Once I got past that, the flavor...OMG, delicious! I'll definitely make this one again!
