I scaled way back on this recipe but made as written. This was excellent! The only change I felt needed was the cloves. I will leave  it out entirely the next time because I do not feel it was necessary. The bell kind of gets lost in the presentation but definitely not in the taste. Super good sauce and far superior to store bought!
