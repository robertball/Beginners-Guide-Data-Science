I have never made summer sausage before, and this recipe was amazingly simple.  My family loved the summer sausage, and it has made my husband take up hunting in order to have a fresh supply of Venison for it.  I was concerned about the whole mustard seeds, but they worked out very well.

I used 5.5lbs of venison and 2.5 lbs of pork and adjusted the ingredients accordingly.  That ratio should be higher, perhaps 50/50 venison to pork, in my opinion.  Also, I think it needs more pepper (and a coarser grind).  Finally, they do get better with age so don't be in a rush to consume these.  Let 'em hang for a while.

This is a very easy to make recipe and is great tasting. My daughter said she likes it and she is very finicky but did say it was too spicy, so I don't think she is going to even try it when I make this with about 3 tablespoons of crushed red pepper seeds to make some hot sausage. Thank you Gramps for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I made this summer sausage and added jalapenos and some sharp cheddar bits into the mix and wow ...it was great ....always loved summer sausage ...just didn't know it was so easy to make .....one thing I will do in the future though is leave out the liquid smoke and  smoke it in the smoaker for about an hour low temp ....then finish it in the oven ...I think it would only make it that much better

I followed this recipe and have a question, after adding all the ingredients and grinding I put the ground meat in the refrigerator. The next day I went to mix it again and the meat had turned brown over night in a stainless steel bowl. Is this normal ?

Sounds similar to what my Mom made. Cure can be made with twice as much salt as brown sugar. Giving a 5 until I try it.

We doubled the recipe but substituted 3 lbs of bacon  (ends and pieces) to come up with the 10 lbs of sausage added 3tsp of onion powder. Ground everything through my 2nd course grinder face.
 After stuffing the cases had about 1lb left over... Used it as breakfast sausage. Smoked it for 4 hours until the tubes got to 160Â° .  Wife says this is now her favorite way to have venison.

I've made this several times now but just got around to taking a photo and leaving a review. In the past I made as written except that we do add pork fat when we are grinding it and packaging it up for the freezer. This go around I decided to add cheese and jalapeno's that was suggested to me by a friend and even though the cheese didn't add to it in my opinion, the jalapeno's were a nice touch if you like things a little spicy.  This recipe works great and always comes out with the perfect texture and consistency.
