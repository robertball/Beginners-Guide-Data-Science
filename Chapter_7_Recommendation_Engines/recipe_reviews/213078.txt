amazing! i just made this. made a couple changes to suit me and my boyfriends preferences. 1) used beef broth instead of the water and only added 1 package of the gravy mix (just to thicken) 2) used only 4 potatoes and added 1 large sweet potato 3) added fresh herbs to the dumplings  other than that i followed the recipe to a "T" everybody loved it, i will deffinetly be making this again! thanks

Awesome!  I had to tweak it a bit, but only because I didn't have a some of the ingredients. 

No olive oil, so I used canola.
No gravy mix, so I used onion soup mix and a can of cream of mushroom soup.
No turnip,  so I used a can of diced tomatoes - Italian style.
I also used a bag of frozen stew vegetables instead of fresh.

Because there was no gravy mix,  I had to thicken it up with a bit of flour and cold water,  which worked out great! Made the Bisquick dumplings to accompany and it was DELISH!

There is no need for any other stew recipe, IMO.

Very tasty stew. However, I used Swanson's beef broth in a carton instead of water simply because I prefer a richer flavor to the gravy. I also added about  half a cu of Merlot wine. I used all the other ingredients as given and it was excellent. My problem is with the dumplings, but maybe I jut don't understand dumplings. The recipe doesn't say how big the spoonfulls should be. Mine turned out  gummy and tasted of flour. I tossed them out and served mashed potatos on the side. We enjoyed the stew just as well.

Love this recipe! I have yet to make the dumplings, aside from that I make the recipe exactly as is. My bf told me this was better than his mother's stew! Which is quite the compliment she can cook! He told me he wants it at least once a week if not more! The meat ends up so tender, a definate must have recipe. This will for sure stay in my cookbook!

This was absolutely fantastic! Great flavor. I did reduce the potatoes to about 4, and added canned green beans and corn. I used Bisquick for the dumplings.

This stew had a wonderful flavor! I've never had steak seasoning prior to this and I really think that added more flavor to this dish. I followed the recipe to a T except adding a large carton of beef broth & 2 jars of Heinz gravy in place of the gravy mix. When everything was done, I thickened the juice with cornstarch & cold water and made my dumplings. Dumplings soak up quite a bit of the gravy, and we love gravy - so I make sure there was plenty. PERFECT! Thanks!

So good! I'd never made Beef Stew that had dumplings in it before and these were great.  A nice change of pace from a plain beef stew.

I found this recipe really easy to follow.  Just added my dumplings now so havent had a chance to taste them yet but I'm almost sure it is going to be the best beef stew I have made in years. Thanks for this recipe.

Was very good!  I left out the turnip since I couldn't find one at the store.  The sauce/gravy was a bit runnier than I've had in other stews, but yet not thin enough to call it more of a "soup".  We enjoyed this - thanks!

I made this for dinner last night the only real major difference is that I used about 1/2 pkg. McCormick beef stew seasoning,added some black pepper, garlic powder, a few fresh basil leaves & paprika and I didnt have any turnips on hand, it turned out great and reminded me of my moms beef stew she used to make only her biscuits were made with bisquick.

This is mine and my boyfriend's favorite supper recipe. It is simple to make, and tastes fantastic!  i dont bother with the celery, turnips, and have made it without the onions as well, and it still turns out great!

Good stew.  Way too many potatoes and too few carrots.  The dumplings were great.

Good recipe, my mom's is a little different: For tender beef, sear the chunks for less time, just 2 or 3 minutes, in butter instead of oil, and remove them to a bowl to be returned later once the broth is in. Also, coat them in flour and pepper first; the flour cooks off and helps thicken the stew later so you don't need gravy powder. Cook some mushrooms in more butter until they brown, with bay leaf thyme pepper and whole cloves, add onions and root veggies (parsnips are awesome), fresh green beans, then a bunch of red wine to deglaze the brown bits off, then the stock. Simmer for 2 to infinity hours. I love beef stew!!

This was simple and easy. I could not find a turnip though. The meat fell apart in this and shredded by the time this was finished. I couldn't fix the dumplings as there was no room in my pot for them on top. This made a huge pot full of stew. This is a good standard recipe and a great starting point for adding your own variations and making this your own. I used hamburger seasoning and some Texas Roadhouse seasoning instead of Montreal. The gravy was a bit thin so I mixed another gravy pouch with 1/4 c. water and then added it in to thicken it a little. We left the celery in and used whole baby carrots. I did use a mix of chicken broth and beef broth instead of water since I had them open and wanted to use them up. This really needed a little something and neither hubby nor I could figure out what we were missing. I only added a little black pepper and nothing else to this. I will be using this again only trying it in the crockpot the next time. I really want to use a larger pot so there is room for the dumplings. I simply made drop biscuits and baked them in the oven. Thanks for the nice EASY meal. It did take all day to fix though so do plan ahead and start this one early.

I made this last night for dinner.  WOW!!!  I had to make some adjustments since I didn't have all the items needed.  1) Didn't have a turnip, 2) Didn't have 4 pkgs. of dry gravy mix only 1.  Substituted 8 beef cubes and 1 cup of water then added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken.

Only problem with this recipe is that the dumplings were kind of heavy... if you have this problem add 1 tsp of baking powder to lighten them and grate your butter in from frozen. Other than that the actual stew was superb!!!

I definitely "took liberties" with this recipe - but it is forgiving, and a fantastic base to tweak to your personal preferences. I used less water and gravy packets (because my hubby doesn't like soups / stews very much so I keep them as thick as possible), used 3 large russet potatoes, omitted the turnip and used a packet of mushroom gravy and chicken gravy since I was out of "brown". I added a little seasoning to the dumpling mixture as well - some garlic salt, parsley and basil. I only had 2 hours as well since I started dinner later then intended. Came out SO GOOD. The meat was still tender, thick with gravy and yummy potatoes and veggies, and the dumplings were fantastic. I will definitely make this one again.

Like a lot of others, I didn't use a turnip. The taste was good and the beef nice and tender!
My changes:
 I substituted beef broth for the water and added a packet of Swanson's flavor boost as well. I reduced the potatoes to 5 (plenty), left the celery in (I'd chopped it up a bit more), added mushrooms and used flour/water for gravy portion since I'd already put the beef broth and flavor boost in, it worked out just fine. If I did it again, I'd increase the carrots, add green beans in there, mushrooms again and probably add more celery. I agree with the other reviewers--great recipe, can use more veggies.

Added garlic during the beef tenderizing simmer, I'd also add more pepper, it was a bit salty so I'll take that into consideration the next time but otherwise, my family loved it.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

I thought this stew was the best i've ever made. The only change I made was using beef broth instead of water.  I made this for company and received rave reviews.  Definitely a keeper.

Normally, I do not like beef stew at all, but my husband likes it, so I thought I would try this version. It was delicious!  I used a packaged herb brown gravy for beef to add more flavor and it was awesome.  My opinion of beef stew has definitely changed thanks to this recipe!

This reminded me of my mother's stew.  I always loved it especially with the dumplings.  I did not cook the dumplings long enough so they ended up doughy.  Next time I will cook them much longer.  
Everything tasted even better the next day.  This is a great winter dish when you have a large group over.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!! This is so good!  I 1.5 x the recipe. I added 3 gloves crushed garlic. I used ribeye instead of stew meat and it was pull apart tender. I only switched because I had dental work I needed something I could softly chew. I also ex-ed the turnips and added extra potatoes. The only thing I’ll change next time is marinade the meat overnight and I can not wait for next time.

i don't understand how this  recipe attempts to boast " beef stew my mom perfected over 25 years.." perfected over 25 years?? 25 years??... and all she could come up with is FOUR packages of fake gravy? wow. yeah. no thanks. was looking for something more homemade, w/o pre-processed gluten-laden over-salted gravy. yuck.

I have made this twice now.  I haven't had turnips available, so I left those out.  I also prefer my own biscuits, which I bake and top this recipe with.  I used a can of beef broth, then added water up to the level required to mix my gravy mixes with.  I have found you can put the raw veggies in a slow cooker, top with the cooked beef and onions and then add in the prepared gravy over the top.  It was ready after 4 hours on high.  I'm sure you could add in your dumplings at that point and cook for another hour, as I have another recipe where I do just that.

Followed the recipe but added in a cup and a half of merlot and half a cup of water to start. Did everything else according to the recipe.  The scratch dumplings were a really nice touch

I used beef broth instead on the water and dry gravy.  It was a hit! I will definitely be making this again.  Perfect  for a cold weather meal.

Oh this was really good. I had potatoes in it too and added a package of seasoning for pot roast in. Excellent! Opps, just about forgot. I used my pressure cooker and speeded up the process. I LOVE my pressure cooker!

Loved this recipe. My husband bought me a new Le Crueset Dutch oven and I needed a good recipe to break it in.....loved it and got the thumbs up from my husband because he couldn't talk with a mouth full!!! First time making dumplings and they totally worked out. Thank you for your recipe contribution it will be a family favourite in our home!!!

My girlfriend doesn't really like stew, but she liked this..  The only thing I did different was used a carton of beef broth instead of the 4 cups of water, but I added a cup of water and one more gravy package..  Then just before I added the dumplings,  I threw in a bunch of mushrooms.  This one is amazing!  It's the only way I'm ever gonna make beef stew again.  Great recipe!
