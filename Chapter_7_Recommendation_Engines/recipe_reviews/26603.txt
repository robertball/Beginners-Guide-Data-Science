I never liked meatloaf before I tried this recipe. This is the BEST meatloaf. Not only is it easy, but it tastes great...very juicy. I substitute equal parts ketchup & brown sugar for my topping, though, instead of pasta sauce.

As is, this wasn't for us. I think this recipe has potential with some tweaking. On the plus side, it is a sturdy meat loaf. No falling apart here.

Good recipe. EZ is the operative word.  I used stove top stuffing ( 6 oz. chicken flavor ) a can of condensed tomato soup mixed with the egg & stuffing mix. Then I topped mine with chili sauce instead of pasta sauce.  Good and even a non cooking man can do this one.

This recipe is good, but needed more flavor, was a little bland in the middle.  Other than that it was good, not dry, but moist, maybe add  salt and pepper to it. Also I used ketchup on the top as that is what my kids like.

It was EZ to make, quick to put together, but we found lacking in something...so we added medium salsa on top to give it extra zing. I would consider adding salsa or sauce to the meat as well, just make sure you're starting with lean beef, if not you'll end up with something very soggy.  I would try again, but have to tweak abit.

This was so good! I made some changes: added onion, green bell pepper, garlic, and parsley. I cut back a bit on the water, since I put the veggies through the ciusinart, and they were pretty watery. I cooked it in the microwave, and it was plenty moist and smelled so good! Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great recipe - very easy.  I was trying to use up ground beef that never got made into hamburgers from a barbq.  My beef wasn't lean so the meatloaf was a little greasy.  Use lean meat!  I also cheated and used dried onions.  Great way to get rid of salty stovetop too!

Family loved it.  Was quick and easy to make.  I altered it by draining the grease twice while cooking and topped it off with thick 'n mild picante sauce.

This ia a good easy way to make meatloaf, the stuffing mix is a quick tasty alternative. I left out the pasta sauce and topped the meatloaf with a crumb topping. Very tasty, I will use this recipe again!

This was one of the best meat loafs I have made.  But I made a few changes to mine.  I also used stove top for chicken. Instead of water I used milk.  And added about a 1/4 cup Dijon mustard. I also used chili sauce to top instead of the pasta sauce.  I also cooked it in muffin time. I love that there was no grease.

I love this recipe.  I am a big stuffing fan and a big meatloaf fan and to have them both together is a wonderful taste.  Couldn't be easier and we all love it...even my fussy five year old.  Very moist and tasty.  Thank you to the chef who submitted this!

I liked the texture of the meatloaf.  But I agree with other reviews that it is very bland.  pouring pasta sauce on top of the loaf wasn't enough for me. 

it needs something to liven it up.
this is definitely a recipe that is "tweakable"

We love this meatloaf.  I add other flavors depending on what I am in the mood for.  Some ingredients I have added:  bacon bits, grated pizza or mexican cheese, garlic salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, freeze-dried bell pepper flakes, possibilies are endless.  I make meatball out of the mixture as well.  Also, toppings are my homemade pasta sauce or jar sauce, or salsa.  I use 1 1/2 cups of water for moistness!

This meatloaf is amazingly tasty.  It only lasted a couple of days around here, lol.  I definitely recommend it as-is...no need to alter the recipe.

Ok, first I have to say that in the 6yrs that I have been out of my parents house I have attempted to  make meatloaf quite a few times and always ended up disappointed with the results.  I'm a pretty decent cook and can make all kinds of complicated and ethnic dishes, however mastering a GOOD meatloaf has really been the bane of my culinary existence ... until now!  I made this SUPER easy recipe last night, with few changes, and my bf and I loved it (he usually dislikes my meatloaf as much, if not more, than I do lol)!!  This will definitely, definitely be my meatloaf recipe for now on.  The simplicity of it is ridiculously amazing and it turned out fantastically moist and flavorful.  Here are the changes I made: Used about 1.5lbs of ground meat since that's what I had, replaced the water with about 3/4c milk and about 1/4c of the jarred pasta sauce, used dried minced onions rather than fresh, as well as some dried minced bell peppers. Made a free form loaf and cooked exactly as directed, which was the perfect amount of time.  If i could give this 10 stars, I would!  Thanks to the original poster, great recipe!! :)

With a couple of tweaks, this was pretty good.  I used the food processor to turn the stuffing into bread crumbs as I felt it would deliver better consistency throughout the loaf and therefore give it a better texture.  It did.  And I nixed the marinara sauce, using instead a can of Manwich sauce.  The  Manwich sauce is a standard for me with meatloaf because of the wonderful tangy flavor it lends to the dish.  (You can make your own Manwich sauce with ketchup, chili powder and diced bell pepper--heat in sauce pan long enough to soften bell pepper so it releases its flavor into the sauce.)

Easy to make. I followed instructions.  Mine fell apart.  May have needed more bread crumbs to hold it together. It wasn't dry at all. Good flavor. I did put mustard and some Worcestershire sauce in it. I will try it again.

Good recipe! If you are worried about it coming out bland as others have said, skip the pasta sauce topping, try adding 3 tablespoons of worschire sauce, 8oz tomato sauce INTO the meat mixture instead of water, and a few dashes of Lawrys seasoning salt. If you want your loaf to have a smoother consistency put the stuffing mix in a baggie and crush it before adding to mixture. I also melted shredded mozzarella cheese over the top towards the end of baking and served it with sautéed mushrooms and brown gravy.

The only change I made to this recipe was topping it with a mixture of 1/2 ketchup & 1/2 brown sugar......next time I'll use only 1/2 package of the dressing mix.  We liked the flavor, but there was too much "filler".

Good recipe, not a five star recipe but it tastes good and is quick and easy. I've made it a few times when I was short on time/ingredients and will keep the recipe on hand for those occasions, thanks for sharing it =)

My aunt taught me to make this in the early 70s and I've loved it ever since.  My husband doesn't like meatloaf so I haven't made it in decades.  Was glad to get the ingredient amounts.  I mixed the ingredients early in the day and was a bit disappointed.  I'm pretty sure that if you mix right before cooking the flavor pops a lot more and there is a little crisp from the stuffing.  Also, if you love the crispy outer edge of the loaf consider ditching the loaf pan and shaping it on a baking sheet.  Lots more crunchy goodness.
Oh, and I don't care for tomato sauce on meatloaf either.
