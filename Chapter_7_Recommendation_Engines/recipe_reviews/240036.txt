This was pretty good for a quick warmer-upper and very easy to make. My only substitution was using Splenda in place of sugar.

An Arctic blast has hit the south, and this was a great way to warm up the kids when they got home from the bus stop! I initially made 2 servings, then ended up making 2 more - it was that good. I did top it with some whipped cream and chocolate shavings, just to make it extra special.
