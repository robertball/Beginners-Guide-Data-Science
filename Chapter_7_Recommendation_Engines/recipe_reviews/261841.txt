Not sure how to rate this..3.5. I followed the recipe exactly as written for the most part. I did not have red potatoes and used russet. The potatoes were absolutely delicious!! I think the recipe should read 1/2 lemon and not a 1/2 c? That is a lot of lemon juice which over powered the citrus flavors. The chicken was ok, rather dry, some of the breading became soggy. My kids asked for ketchup/mustard & even I opted to dip it in mustard. Overall, I like the idea of using one pan for dinner and using parchment paper was genius, however, this was a little bland and had a lot of prep for one sheet pan. I would prepare the cutlets as written then fry them and roast the vegetables as described on the parchment because the potatoes were amazing!!

Easy to make. The combo of the sage and the citrus is delicious.
