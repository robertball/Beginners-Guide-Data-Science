It is AMAZING.  It is more like cheesecake candy. Very sweet, very rich cheesecake candy. Would be really yummy with dried cranberries.

Very good but VERY sweet and rich so be sure to cut into small pieces.  We have a nut allergy in my house so I skipped the pecans and substituted dried cranberries...the tartness added a nice contrast to the sweetness.  The texture came out perfectly.  I cooled the fudge in the fridge for about an hour and found the fudge easy to cut at that point.  My husband loves white chocolate so this was a great find for my family.

This recipe produces a VERY rich product.  I doubled it, because I have a pretty big family, and it made far more than we needed because no one wanted to have more than a small piece, it was that rich.  It was also very, very thick in the mixing stages; I had to stop using my electric mixer pretty early on because I didn't want to kill it.  By the time I had everything ready to go in the pan, I had to kneed it down with my fists to make it flat.   At several stages, I wondered if I had done something wrong, but after checking, double checking, and triple checking the recipe and my measurements, I can't find any error.  I think maybe this is one of those recipes that shouldn't be doubled. 

ALL that said, this "fudge" is. SO. GOOD.  As I said, it is super rich, but it's also super tasty, and it'll last a while, which is great.  I really enjoyed it, and it's totally worth making, especially if you're like me and aren't all to fond of chocolate.

A very simple no-fail recipe that makes a nice fudge in very little time.  This would be a nice addition to your holiday table.

Very sweet and tasty fudge for a special occasion. The hardest part is taking time to Gradually beat the powdered sugar into the cream cheese. Otherwise very easy and yummy!

I loved this idea.. but I made changes... I used 8 oz cream cheese, half cup powder sugar, tsp vanilla, 1 cup left over homemade cranberry sauce, mixed well and then added melted 11 oz white chocolate chips..  stirred in about half cup or less craisens. I put this layer inbetween to old fashioned fudge layers and sprinkled a few craisens into the bottom layer fudge... soo yummy. A little dusting of powdered sugar on top or cocoa powder for asthetics... very lovely

This turned out awesome. I used macadamia nuts instead of walnuts and added dried cranberries. The macadamia nuts gave it a perfect crunch and the dried cranberries balanced well with the sweetness. I will make this many times in the future! Thanks!

So delicious if you love white chocolate. Very easy to make and so worth the time. I am not a very experienced fudge maker, so I am not  sure if I would change anything. I am sure that it is super yummy.
