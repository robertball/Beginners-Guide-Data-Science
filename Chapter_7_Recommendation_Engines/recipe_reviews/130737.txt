This is not a bad jumping off point, but from the start I could see it would be a little on the bland side. I substituted chicken stock for the water (vegetable stock would work just as well if you want to keep it vegetarian)added a good sized grind of fresh pepper (I use the peppercorn mix of black, red, pink and white), a generous clove of fresh garlic, a pinch of thyme, sea salt instead of table salt for seasoning, and it was nearly perfect. Since my husband and I are not vegetarians I added a tablespoon of chopped bacon to add a little rich smoky flavor and it was great. A scant 1/4 tsp of liquid smoke would work for vegetarians. Soups are all about layers of flavors to me, and while this recipe was a good base it needed some help to get to where I wanted it to be. P.S. this is my first experiment with quinoa, and I will definitely be using it again!

I found the recipe as written a little bland. I used half broth and half water, and I would definitely substitute broth for the full amount of water next time. I would probably add some garlic at the beginning as well.

This is 5 star if you take the other's suggestions along with mine!  I used a vegetarian vegetable stock and used a Sage-Rosemary-Thyme herb combo.  I used Coconut Oil instead of canola oil because it is better to heat since it does not oxidize as much as other oil at high temperatures.  Skinny Bitch taught me that.  I added some liquid smoke at the end as well as salt an pepper.

I agree w/ the other reviewers that this recipe  as written is a bit bland. Garlic and fresh ground pepper really help, I also added some finely chopped celery and red bell pepper, and served with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. If I make this again, I'll cook it in vegetable broth instead of plain water.

I have to agree with other reviewers - this was a good "starter" recipe.  I added 2 cloves of garlic to the onions, as well as the thyme, pepper and salt that was suggested.  I used 3 cups of veggie broth and an extra splash of wine.  I also put in about 1.5 tsp of Kitchen Bouquet to give it a bit more color/flavor.  I paired with a salad and warm, fresh rye bread and we really enjoyed.  Thanks so much for posting this.

An interesting combination of vegetables in this one, but it was nice and creamy.

Very bland even after adding veggie broth, garlic, and vinegar. I love quinoa but just not in this recipe, sorry!

I used the foundation of the recipe, but since I was looking for a vehicle for my homemade chicken broth, and I like tweaking recipes, I have some additions: included 1 cup diced chorizo, 1/2 red pepper, diced and 2 celery stalks when it was time to add the onion. Also added 3 tbsp minced garlic half way though the onion's cook time so it didnt burn.I also used 3 regular-sized cans cannelloni beans instead of using soaked beans. 
I added 1 cup chopped kale (to make it healthier) when adding the wine. And of course, the inspiration for this .... Instead of water, salt-free homemade chicken stock. Served with sprinkled parmesan on top.

DELICIOUS. One of my new favorite soups.

I used 2 cans rinsed beans instead of dry, sautéed some chopped bell pepper w/onion, then added the mushrooms, then some garlic. Also used chicken stock. It was good, but I think it would’ve been just as good without the quinoa.

was pretty good. I try and stay true to recipes but sometimes we have to alter a little. I was trying to use up leftover quinoa and a huge container of baby spinach from the fridge.  I used canned cannellini, rinsed and drained. I used EVOO and added a red bell to the onion... and garlic because I add it to everything . I always have some sort of wine but sadly no rosemary so Herbes De Provence. Veg broth for any water to hopefully to make up for any lost flavor.  The two college kids enjoyed the hardiness and the leftovers went well with me to work. Thank you.

Even after the addition of chicken broth, more mushrooms, and being pretty liberal with the seasonings, this was kind of flat.

My boyfriend made this meal for us. He surprisingly enjoyed it! He had a pretty big helping and finished it all. He said it wasn't as flavorful as he wished but that he liked it.
