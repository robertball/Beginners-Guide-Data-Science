The recipe and technique were awesome. But I tried three different major grocery stores to find all necessary ingredients and couldn't find most of them. I found what they consisted of on the internet and was able to reconstruct enough that it made a dinner my family is already wanting me to make again. excellent flavor!

These fajitas have excellent flavor without a lot of heat.  So I think everyone would like them.  I marinated the fajitas overnight and I think marinating them that long helped bring out all the flavor.  Those who like a lot of heat, can add the pico de gallo, jalape√±os, etc.  For those that do not like a lot of heat, leave off the pico de gallo and add the toppings of your choice.  I really like that Goya Mojo Criollo marinade.  I did not find the Sazonador.  So I added garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, black pepper, and mexican oregano instead.  I seasoned the meat first with the marinade.  Then I cooked the meat first, removed the meat, added the vegetables to let them cook and get the flavor of the meat.  Then added the meat back at the end.  However, next time I would grill the meat instead.

So good! I let the meat marinate overnight which really infused the flavor.  Very easy, yet tastes like you slaved for hours. After the meat and veggies were in the tortilla, I added some sliced avocado and a little cheese. Perfect with a side of salsa and sour cream!

These were delicious!!!  For the garnish we used a black bean and corn salsa instead of the Salsa Pico de Gallo & did not use the Salsita.  I did everything else as directed and they were delicious.  So much better than the store bought Fajita packet mixes!

I loved the flavors of this fajita recipe. We had fresh pico and guacamole rather than pre-made, but I love that Goya offers the option to choose. This was a quick, delicious meal that I will be making again soon!

The marinade makes for nice flavorful meat. Although  I wouldn't stress about the other Goya seasonings for the onions and peppers if you can't find them.

We like fajitas, and this recipe is pretty good.  I marinated the meat for about 4 hours, and the flavor was nicely developed, without being too spicy.  For us, the addition of the Goya Adobo with Pepper made the dish saltier than we usually enjoy, so I left out the Sazonador, and did not season the vegetables at all.  Fajitas are an easy dish to customize, and my family really enjoys "building" their own!

I have 3 kids who are very picky eaters, they absolutely loved this, it was so good! I did make the peppers and onions and it was good with the fajita but I also made the steak fajitas with homemade pico de gallo, white rice and corn. Absolutely delicious!!! Luckily a local grocery store had all of the Goya ingredients that the recipe required. I marinated the steak for about 3 - 4 hours and it was perfect. I would strongly recommend this to parents or spouses of fussy eaters.

My family loved this recipe, I made this with both steak and chicken, however the steak came out really chewy. Any suggestions? I used skirt steak...

This recipe really makes awesome steak fajitas; just as good or better than at our favorite Mexican restaurant. It's the marinade that really makes it. I served with Mexican style rice for an easy weeknight supper. Don't stress about the Goya products, I couldn't find any Goya products at my Meijer store but they had a myriad of other similar products.

Made this for dinner-  I had to look around for the ingredients, but it was worth it.  I cut the meat into smaller pieces-  more surface area for the marinade!  Very yummy.

Wow! Better than normal fajitas! It has a kick to it that isn't too bad even for someone who can't deal with spice like me!...provided you take out the chilis after cooking with them.

Reminded me of the Fajitas at our local Mexican restaurant.  I had cut off steaks from a rump roast I had.  Also didn't have Goya Sazonador Total but the ingredients in that spice include garlic powder, onion powder, salt, parsley, oregano and cumin. I had on hand garlic powder, garlic salt, parsley and oregano and added a combination of those instead.  If you "google" the ingredients you'll find some of the local food stores have the spices.

I marinated the skirt steak in pesto overnight, it gave it a very tasty flavor, a dollop of sour cream is a must when making fajitas.

I made this without the Goya seasoning because the store I went to didn't carry it. the Goya marinade was amazing though! the fajitas I made with it were so much better than the ones you make with the taco seasoning. definitely worth 5 stars

As others noted all the spices are hard to find. Have no fear the basics are enough. No guacamole or cheese made it simple and oh so good.

I could not find the sazinodar total spice package, but probably did not need it. Marinated the meat for 24 hours and it was delicious!
