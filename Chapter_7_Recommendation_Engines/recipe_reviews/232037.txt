I double this recipes and served it for dessert to my guests and they absolutely loved it. Make sure and use extra candy pieces for a topping.

We didn't like this at all. The butterfinger-whipped cream was the only edible part; the graham cracker "crust" didn't work at all with the cream.  I can see using the cream as a sort of frosting for a cake or as a topping for a pie, though.  Sorry.

This actually sound good and would take care of a sweet tooth. I think this is a project for the kids. Thx!
