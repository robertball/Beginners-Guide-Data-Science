First of all, this recipe includes lemon juice and olive oil. So to me it wasn't surprising to taste olive oil and lemon in the dressing. It tastes excellent. I doubled the recipe to feed 7 people.  Made it overnight and just mixed it in with the salad the next day. Really good. Combination of sweet and citris tastes. Not as olive oily tasting as you would think, it's a mild olive oil taste. Unless you mess up the recipe and add too much oil.

This is a good starter recipe.  You can add more spices if you want.  I think anything taste better with garlic.  I like it the way it is when my tabouli recipe calls for olive oil and lemon--I just use this dressing instead.  It gives the recipe more zip.

I'm a big fan of lemon, so I should have added more lemon juice to this dressing. This is a good simple dressing, that enhances the flavors of the vegetables in the salad instead of covering them.  In my opinion, this recipe is a good base for a dressing, but needs ingredients added to it.  Is still a good (and simple) light dressing on it's own, though.

This recipe reminded me that making my own dressing is not rocket science, and it spurred me on to do more of my own.  A nice little starter recipe.

This is very simple and versatile.  I used this
with an antipasto salad and it was great.

I've never tried to make many dressings of my own. I found this one tasted too much like olive oil and lemon (of course!) But I love the garlic.

A simple, not too strong dressing that compliments the vegetables as opposed to covering them.

I did not like the taste of this dressing. Too olive oil and lemony.

Other than the sugar not being necessary and the fact that this, of course, needs salt and pepper, this is perfect.  Light, fresh and beautiful in its simplicity. This is MY kind of vinaigrette, and just what you need for salads made with light greens.  Tonight I used it to lightly dress baby arugula that I used for a bed of grilled shrimp (also marinated in this).

This one is hard to rate. Normally, I'm a huge lemon lover and usually add more than a recipe calls for. But, this ratio of oil to lemon was a lot to start with! I went ahead and made it exactly as stated. It took a whole lemon to get the 2T. It's such a small amount of sugar, I didn't even detect it. Same with the mustard amount. It just tastes like oily lemon. So, I decided to pour a bit of this dressing on a zucchini & 2 romas and roast them with it. I then decided that I needed to clean out the fridge so I put a bit of butter in a pan, more garlic, some grilled chicken (leftover), some ww spaghetti (leftover) and added a bit of this sauce into the pan along with the zucchini & tomatoes that I had roasted. I heated it all with some fresh parm. The end dish was very good, but I don't think I could handle this as a vinaigrette on its own.

The dressing wasn't bad, but for some reason the tastes of the lemon and the garlic didn't mix.  Each bite was either too much lemon or too much garlic.  Weird for my taste buds.

I had this dressing at a restaurant and always wanted to know how to make it.  I found it too lemony so I cut the lemon in half and I found it too thin so I added mayonnaise. It came out perfect!

A decent healthy alternative to the oily, high sodium store-bought salad dressings.  I added a little salt and pepper.  I also had to substitute prepared Dijon mustard b/c I don't have the dry.  For those that are particular about it not being too oily, make sure you try the "light" olive oil (I used Pompeian's Extra Light).

Delicious! I needed a salad dressing for my blood type diet (which needed to be vinegar and dairy-free) and this is perfect! Great recipe to experiment with.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! Added 3 sliced green onions to the dressing. Served with leftover, cold, grilled Norwegian Salmon on a bed of mixed spring salad greens. It was perfect. The light, lemony, flavor complemented the dish well.

A good basic recipe that can be put together last minute and will complement your fresh produce with out over powering it, as well as being very versatile.

I poured this over a cold buckwheat and vegetable salad.  After a few hours of sitting in the fridge, the flavours combined very nicely.
