This soup is great, and so easy to make. I used hot sausage, and hot tomatoes, because my family likes spicy food. My husband loved it. I e-mailed it to a lot of my friends. Thank you.

This was very good, and very easy.  Made a couple of adjustments.  I used small white beans (don't like butter beans).  I also added 1 tsp. garlic salt and a splash of tabasco.

We love this recipe!  I omit the onions and butter beans.  I also use dried basil and add an extra can of Diced tomatoes.  It is very very good.  A nice winter soup without being "chili"

My gang loves soup and this was quick and good. I used pinto beans in lieu of the butter beans and pureed half of the soup mixture in my food processor to make it thicker. Thanks!

When it turned cold we wanted to make one more pot of soup. Very hearty and satifying. I beefed up the vegies adding carrot, celery and minced garlic. I used kidney bean instead of butter, just personal preference. This was almost like a bean minestrone.

I made this one day when I had sausage and no hamburger and wanted something to do with it.  Did a search and this was dinner.  This is good.  Sausage was a nice change of taste in soup.  Would recommend.

I used Navy beans instead of butter beans.  
This was fabulous and SO easy!  Even the kids loved it!
