I made this as a gift so didn’t get to taste it but I was told it was very good. I followed the directions and had no problems getting a beautiful loaf when completed.  I did forget to invert it (though did this with another panetonne recipe) but didn't collapse or deflate in any way.  A cost savings idea was to purchase a medley of dried fruit from Trader Joe's which had cranberries, cherries, blueberries & golden raisins (called Golden berry blend).  No pineapple, which I've used before and didn't care for.   I do recommend the rolling of the dough which keeps the fruit inside and won't burn.

Thos had good, balanced flavours.  Boosted the vanilla to 2 tsp, and total sugar added was 1/2 cup.  I used a coffee tin lined with parchement paper as I did not have the paper form.  After letting the dough rise for 4 hours, I did bake it an extra 10 minutes (55 minutes), but the center could still use more baking (5-10 minutes).  I could not cool the cake upside down as the weight of the cake started to tear along the sides of the cake where they were suspended by the skewers.  Regardless, the cake didn’t shrink down much upon coolong on a rack.  The video clip was not operational, so I followed the rolling directions in the recipe as written.  The resulting cake had a gap in the center and the fruit did not distribute evenly throughout the cake.  I think my next attempt I will roll the dough out thinner and roll the log from only one end and then seal it.  Also going to change the fruit combo for variety.

I enjoy the recipe,  mostly just because of the narrator. His voice  was nice and he made me laugh and giggle. Great job. I would love to hear him narrate how to books!
