This recipe was delicious!  My husband is on a low-carb diet, and this fit the bill.  I did not use the optional items, and I used mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack (didn't have any). I also used fresh mushrooms, and a combination of cauliflower and broccoli (both fresh).  Both my husband and son, who aren't crazy about mushrooms, loved it. Will definitely make this again, and might just add ham or bacon.

I was looking for a way to include more vegetables at breakfast. This is great. My family loved it.
