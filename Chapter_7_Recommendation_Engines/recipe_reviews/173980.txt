I probably won't make this again. Sounded different and interesting but in the end nothing special. I ended up adding some tomato sauce at the end because it was sort of flavorless even though I used herbed goat cheese.

Really tasty but I usually halve the amount of pumpkin seeds because, though delicious, I like the texture better without so many of them.

I made the recipe just as shown except for the pumpkin seeds.  I ran out of time, so I just used roasted seeds bought from the store and added red pepper to spice up the pasta a bit.  It seemed too cheesy to me.  It was good but it wasn't great and I probably wont make this one again.  Thanks anyway though!

I liked this dish!  After reading the reviews, I decided to adjust a few things in order to give it more flavor....after draining the pasta, I returned it to the pot and tossed with a fairly generous amount of good olive oil....I then added the roasted tomatoes/green onions together with some of the leftover oil, garlic that was on the roasting pan.  I let the pasta sit for about 10 min before adding the cheese as I didn't want the cheese to entirely melt...I wanted pieces of the cheese still intact.  Then I added parsley, toasted pumpkin seeds, salt and pepper.  Loved it!

Quite yummy.. uses  regular tomatoes because they were on sale and gemelli pasta, which I loved, seems to be no where to be found.. so I used rotini. I am sure I used less cayenne because I am a wimp. I added some of the olive oil/juice to the dish and it loosened it up and improved it. Salt and cracked fresh pepper finished it.. yum
