Simple bare bones basic and delicately flavored -exactly what I had in mind to complement not compete with or overpower the Lobster and Crab Burgers I needed an uncomplicated but good sauce for. Loved the addition of the chopped green pepper and I added some fresh green onion as well. Five stars not because it's a culinary masterpiece but because it does what it's meant to do well.

I have been making this for the last 30 years except I left out the onions. To make Thousand Island just add relish to this recipe. I used to make both dressings.

This was pretty good it put me in the mind of "special sauce" from Mickee D's. It felt it was just missing something. I think I would prefer it if there was a little more zing to it. Over all pretty tasty I think it just needs a little tweaking.

I wasn't sure how to serve this dipping sauce so I used this recipe to dip my "Traditional Russian Pirozhki." Served with cabbage soup "Russian Garden Salad " "Instant Russian Tea " and "Russian Tea Cakes III."

This is a really simple sauce but it has a lot of flavor. It reminds me of thousand island dressing. Omit the salt. Ketchup already has a ton of salt so you won't miss the extra. Use about 1/4 cup minced fresh onions instead of the onion powder. If you don't feel like mincing you can just throw everything into the food processor.

If you want a delicate flavored sauce not too overpowering for something this is for you. The bell pepper adds a nice crunch and freshness.

My mom was making this as a salad dressing as long as I can remember literally. I kicked it up a bit on her and she loved it. mayo ketchup lemon juice and sweet relish. No measurements just to taste. Basically a home made thousand island dressing. Sometimes I'll kick it up a bit more with some white bottled horseradish or fresh ground pepper..

I loved this! It was quick easy and everything on hand. When you are getting tired of serving ketchup this is a great replacement.

I make this sauce for chicken and shrimp with Heinz chilli sauce miracle whip or mayo a splash of lemon and hot sauce to taste. Made with ketchup was good too but a little mild I will make it again when little ones are around. Thanks for sharing!
