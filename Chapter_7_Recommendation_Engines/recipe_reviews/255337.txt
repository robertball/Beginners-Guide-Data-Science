I was confusing recipes and I thought this was an instapot recipe I had!  I threw this in and had five pounds of meat, so I put in five times the herbs and spices... Which seemed way too much and I should have realized this!  After cooking all I could taste was strong cumin.  
I prefer the instapot, so I'd like to try this one again with the spices listed, but instead of 1 lb, make 5 lbs of meat.  This needs lime!  I'm either going to garnish it as such or add it in when cooking.  The same with onions.  Either as a garnish or when cooking.  
I agree with the other reviewers.  It's not the meat that makes this meal, but likely what you garnish your tacos with... Like cabbage, red onion, lime, etc.  I prefer this combo with soft tacos instead of the corn tacos.

What's pictured with the pork is part of what makes these so good.  Adding red onion, cilantro, fresco cheese gives these tacos exactly the right flavors and textures.  Someone also noted a cabbage slaw, which sounds great.   Make sure you allow time to cook for larger pork tenderloins as 1lb. Is on the smaller side.  Im looking forward to beating someone to any leftovers.

Only change I made was to add a very small can of Chipotle peppers. Used 1 1/2 # pork tenderloin, baked for 45 minutes. Served with refried beans and usual taco toppings, delicious. Will definitely make this again.

Turned out excellent. Added a little ground chipotle chili and threw it on the grill and topped it off with a cabbage, red onion and cilantro slaw. Definitely will be making it again.

My husband really liked this recipe. I made it with pork chops that I cut into strips and marinated for half an hour and then cooked in a wok. He definitely wants me to make it again.

This was ok. I did not feel there was too much lime like other reviewers.  I added extra crushed red pepper as it was pretty bland tasting when I tested it, and a little extra ginger.

It was delicious, however, I didn't like the corn tortilla so the second helping I made as a salad
