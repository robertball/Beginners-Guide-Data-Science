It was tasty, but my meatloaf crumbled. It didn’t stay together in cut pieces. I may need to cut back on the stuffing mix, onion, and add an egg next time

It was too wet and too sweet. The leftovers set up well but fresh out of the oven it did not hold its shape. It’s a good basic recipe that I would make again, reducing the ketchup, and also replacing some of it with tomato sauce.
