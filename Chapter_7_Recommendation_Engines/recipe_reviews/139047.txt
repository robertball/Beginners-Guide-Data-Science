I'm giving this recipe 3 1/2 stars as stated. It was ok, not terrible, not my favorite. The spiciness of the tuna mix was nice, but it was pretty dry without any mayo. I added mayo to both slices of bread which did help. Next time I will skip the tuna mixture altogether, and just make a bacon, lettuce, avocado and tomato sandwich. I might try adding mayo to the tuna mix and use that, alone, for plain tuna sandwiches. I just didn't like the combination of a BLT and tuna sandwich, I guess.

Added 2 Tbsp of salad dressing to help tuna mixture with dryness - made it more like consistency I am used to.

Melted cheese on tuna before adding everything else - Delicious! Loved it. Yummy!

I did forgo the horseradish and pickle but it was easy to make and tasty.

I was in a hurry, so I just used that new "horseradish" mustard, and made it with "Nayonnaise" (soy based-no cholesterol) and 'veggie' bacon strips that I had from Morningstar Farms(again no cholesterol). Didn't have any lettuce,which would have made it better, but it was still delicious. I used whole wheat buns, too.

After seeing a previous review that this was a little dry, I doubled the dijon mustard and added 2 tablespoons of mayo. I skipped the horseradish, relish, onion and paprika. A good, basic recipe with plenty of room for experimentation!

Maybe all of the ingredients should be increased (except the tuna) to give it more flavor . . .

I cannot believe this doesn't have 1.0000 ratings. I'm not a rushed cook, don't live in a dorm room,or have a small kitchen, but we loved this sandwich. Perfect as is, but I only had pepper jack and cheddar on hand. This wonderful recipe is forgiving and versatile. Hubby loved it with mac and cheese and 7 layer salad. Thank you QAEDON!

Great sandwich, but I made these changes: Added 3 tbsp. Miracle Whip for added moisture and "zip."  Lightly buttered the hoagie rolls, added light coating of fresh parmesan cheese and placed under broiler just until cheese began to melt.  Added spicy brown mustard to the tuna mix, plus a dash of celery salt and seasoning salt.  We did add all the other ingredients as listed but spread a light coating of creamy horseradish sauce on the roll because the "heat" was lost in the tuna mix and this restored it at little. 

Recommend adding minced celery for extra crunch.  This was a really good sandwich!  We especially loved the crispy bacon in it.

I omitted the horseradish, pickle and cheese.  It's a great way to work avocado into my diet.

I read all the reviews and added some mayo to the tuna salad.  I hollowed out  the hoagie roll a bit and put the tuna in the hole and melted the provolone on it and then assembled the rest of the sandwich.  Some lawry’s season salt and I’m good!

The first time I tried the sandwich, I tried it with this recipe's tuna.
I didn't like it. The second time I did the sandwich, I used this site's Team Four
Tuna. Then I liked the sandwich.

Love this recipe since it doesn't have mayo.  As others have said, it is a little dry, but melting the cheese on top and then adding avocado, tomato, and lettuce did the trick.  I actually made it an open face sandwich and used the lettuce as the topper.  Good flavor.
