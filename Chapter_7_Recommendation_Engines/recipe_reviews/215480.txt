THIS IS MY RECIPE PLEASE READ :  Hi all - I'm realizing from reviews that the instructions don't say what to do with the bacon and as a reviewer pointed out THE SALT AMOUNT IS TOO HIGH!!  I don't know if that was not included in my original posting, or if something was lost in translation when the recipe was kitchen approved.  Sorry!!  You should add the crumbled bacon when you add the clams.  As for the salt if should be a DASH OR TWO TO TASTE (you can taste the mixture before baking it and adjust) - NOT 2 TSP FOR THIS AMOUNT!  SORRY!

I was hoping this was going to be wonderful, but I was disappointed.  The end result was entirely too salty!  I had to check to see if I followed the recipe correctly.  And I'm a person who enjoys salt!  Im glad that I tried it, but I wont be making it again.

thanks for the clarification on the bacon, but i figured out when to ad.
this seemed to take a lot of work and i didn't think it had much taste to it.  no one flavor stood out, even the clams.  maybe as an appetizer w/ crackers or veggies?

I saw the photo and happened to have all ingredients except fresh garlic. I increased the garlic powder and otherwise followed the recipe as written. I also used panko bread crumbs. Delicious dip for Sunday football!

This was OK.  Didn't need any salt as far as I was concerned.  I agree that this would make a good appetizer with some crackers.

I have to say I thought this recipe had a GREAT flavor and I will definitely make it again.  However, for me the recipe needed quite a bit of tweaking.  First, this is called a casserole..this would not be what I would consider a casserole...like many other reviewers mentioned it really is a dip (a good one!) .  Also there was no mention of what size casserole dish to use (I would use an 8x8 dish or maybe a pie plate).  When I read the reviews there was mention of the dish being too salty.  With clam juice, bacon and parmesan as ingredients of course it was going to be on the salty side...I omitted the 2 teaspoons of salt and glad I did...it was plenty salty enough without it! (not too salty).  Also, after you add the clams and crumbled bacon, don't forget to remove the bay leaves.  I will make this again but as a dip with Ritz crackers or in clam shells or over linguini with some olvie oil.
