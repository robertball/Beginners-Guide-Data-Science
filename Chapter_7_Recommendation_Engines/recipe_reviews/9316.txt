I grew up eating this salad!  A wonderful way to make it is to use vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.  It adds a bit of sweetness without overpowering it.  (My mom said she has made it with pina colada yogurt and that was really good.) Whenever I make this to bring places, I leave out the coconut because there are many people who do not like coconut.  They always rave on it and it's so simple to make :-).

I have been making this recipe since I was first married 20 years ago!  It is awesome just the way it is written.  It's best if you make it a day ahead though. Make sure to drain the friut very well so there is no runny stuff in the bottom of the bowl.

Very simple recipe, but wonderful. My oma used to take the coconut and put a little food coloring on it to suit the seasons; green for St. Pattie's day, red for Christmas, pink for easter, etc. Thanks for sharing this. Gives the salad just a slight color which is pretty cool.

Wonderful! Fast and easy! The only thing I did different, I used half the amount of sour cream and used cool whip to replace it. Everyone loved it!

This was a refreshing side dish. I used pineapple chunks instead of crushed; I thought it was easier to eat this way. Might try using yogurt instead of sour cream next time.

I've always enjoyed this salad.  I needed to take something to a church function and had everything except the mandarin oranges.  I had a 10 oz jar of marachino cherries.  I just drained them and added them to the mixture.  It turned out great!  This stuff is almost a dessert.

This reminds me so much of my Grandma and sleeping over at her house with my cousin. She always had these ingredients on hand for us because it's so easy for anyone to make. The only difference is that our recipe calls for 1 cup or 8 oz of each: 1 cup marshmallows, 1 cup coconut, 8 oz sour cream, 8 oz mandarin oranges, 8 oz crushed pineapple. Of course, I think the oranges & pineapple may just come in 11 oz cans, but we never cared since we both love pineapple & oranges.

The presentation is beautiful. The taste is out of this world. A not too sweet fruit salad. I cut back on the marshmallows...just personal preference. Thanks, Trece, great salad.

YUM, YUM! Very easy and yummy! My family does Thanksgiving twice each year (Thurs & Sat). I made a different "Ambrosia" salad that called for whip cream (cool whip) on Thurs. then this one on Sat. This version is SO much better! Don't be fooled by the sour cream instead of the whip cream, it still very sweet but not overly sweet like the other. This is the one that will go into my recipe box. Thanks!!!

This is the greatest recipe.  I substitute Fat Free Sour Cream and cut the coconut way back and we have a very low fat "dessert".  I bring this to our potlucks at work and everyone loves it!  And it's so quick to make too.

This is so flipping good. Really. I like to use the multi-colored marshmallows and add in marachino cherries and chopped bananas. NOTE: To prevent the brown look to your bananas, toss with a tablespoon of lemon juice before adding to the salad.

I think I've been eating this salad my entire life at potlucks, so I was delighted to find it here.  I doubled the fruit and then used 8oz of sour cream and it was just perfect!

This is an old family special occassion recipe for us, passed down through the generations. Only difference we use drained chunk pineapple so the salad is not runny at all. And we add 1 cup chopped pecans for crunch. My kids like this best the next day when the marshmallows are soft.

Just like my grandma used to make! One time I did not have any sour cream on hand so I used fat free plain yogurt and you couldn't tell the difference.  This one is always a great hit for potlucks.

Exceptionally good. Goes well as a side dish with many meals. I also add sliced maraschino cherries and a equal amount of cool whip with the sour cream and it still does not come out to sweet. I do not add the coconut because my son does not like it, however have it on the side for others to add if they choose. If you would like it a little sweeter - add a couple of teaspoons of your favorite flavor of jello gelatin to the mixture.

This salad was always a holiday staple at my mom's dinner table.  The only thing she did differently was that it was an even cup of each of the listed ingredients plus a cup of chopped pecans and marachino cherries.  We still always called it "5 cup" salad even though she used seven.  The nuts add a nice texture and the cherries a pretty color.

Wow. I had never heard of this before, but I made it with fresh diced pineapple, an orange (peeled, cut into rings and then into section bits), Greek yogurt and unsweetened coconut. It is awesome! I skipped the marshmallows, but I'm sure they'd be great if you liked them. It made a great breakfast.

It doesn't get any easier than this! I've always hated Ambrosia-type salads because they are cloyingly sweet and drippy and full of marshmallows which I detest. Using sour cream instead of whipped topping and no fruit cocktail makes all the difference in the world! This has the perfect amount of sweetness for the tangy tropical fruits. I didn't even mind the marshmallows! Yummy!!

Delicious, easy, and inexpensize. I added bananas because I thought with the crushed pineapple this recipe needed some bulk.

When I searched for "Five Cup Salad" it came up as Grandma's Five Cup -- it brought on a wave of such nostalgia!  The reason I wanted to make this was because my grandma always did, and I was missing her and her wonderful cooking.  Thank you for the recipe and the memories!

My granny makes this every year at Easter.  It is delicious and nobody would guess it has sour cream in it.

I grew up on 5 cup, but the way we made it was, literally, 5 ingredients and 5 cups.  One cup pineapple chunks, one cup mandarin oranges, one cup shredded coconut, one cup mini marshmallows and one cup sour cream.  Fold all ingredients together and refrigerate until cold.  Every Thanksgiving and Easter we serve this dish!

This is so good! I made this the first time using yogurt because of the reviews and didn't like it. I'm so glad I made it again like it calls with the sour cream because it's so much better. Don't change it!

This is a must for our ham dinners (Easter and Christmas Eve).  I can't get enough of it and usually double the recipe to ensure leftovers!    My version is actually a 5 cup salad.  Same ingredients (although the mandarins are drained) but the amounts are exactly the same.  I usually use the pineapple can (as it goes in with the juice) and then measure the other ingredients.

My mother-in-law gave me this recipe with all the same ingredients, using 1 cup of each so it was truly "5 cup salad." However, the variation I use to make it lower fat and less calories, is replace the sour cream with dannon low-fat peach yogurt.  Hubby thinks it tastes better with the yogurt.

I made this for Easter, it is very good and went over very well.  Instead of the mini marshmallows I used large marshmallows and cut them into fourths (with scissors, wet them first) Seems like extra work but the big ones are less starchy and just hold their shape better in the salad. I used about 10-15.. great recipe!

I think for starters this has sooooo much potential when I saw the sour cream i thought GAG!  But if you let it sit and let the ingredents fall in love with each other, I really think you will be suprised how good this really is.  I think maybe for more color try using the colored mini mellows...could be fun.  Thanks for this one.

**REVISED REVIEW: Following another cooks post I now make this salad with ONE change.  I now substitute HALF the sour cream (I use light sour cream) with a good grade lowfat vanilla flavored yogurt.  It's even b-e-t-t-e-r with a few less calories.  
Bingo..this is it!
My fiance' always talked about a wonderful salad his grandmother used to make at the holidays, and he tried to tell me what he thought was in it.  Guess what? No changes..., and it was so fun to be able to bring some of his lost family traditions to our own table.

I made this for a teacher luncheon, and everyone loved it.  I added cherries and some of the juice from the bottle.  It gave it a really nice pink color and added a bit of cherry flavor!  Very good!

I forgot how good this salad is. My mom used to make it all the time and I just rediscovered the recipe on this site. It is something that is easy, is from ingredients I normally always have on hand AND that everyone thinks is great. I usually add some sliced bananas too.

The only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars in all areas is because I felt that it required more than a little draining, I even used paper towels to drain the fruit and it took more time.  It is wonderful.

Amazing!  I used lite sour cream to cut back on the fat and calories a little bit.  Per another reviewer's comment, I added some food coloring.  This dish looks great in pink!  It was so easy, I'll be making it all the time and I won't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing!

I make it a little differntly- use a container of cottage cheese insted of the sour cream, also 1 or 2 finely shredded carrots makes an interesting texture. Good for winter or summer!

Amazing traditional grandmother's recipe!  Caution...I love coconut so kept it in.  Many in the crowd would not even try due to the coconut.  I will consider leaving this out next time.

Delicious, but double the recipe if you're feeding a crowd. There is no way this is 8 servings as is, unless everyone's only taking a few bites. I also add maraschino cherries.

Yum!  My mother used to make this for her "fancy ladies' luncheons".  I made it with your recipe for old-times sake and was not disappointed.  Best to leave it in the fridge for 24 hours, the marshmallows get soft and puffy.  Also, you can make this with low-fat vanilla or orange/creamsicle yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I added sliced marachino cherries to make it a little sweeter.

It wouldn't have been a holiday at Grandma's without her Ambrosia salad.  Gram used cool whip and sour cream, left out the coconut, and added maraschino cherries....perfect!  Thanks for the memory!

I could eat an enitre bowl of this myself ( and I am ashamed to admit...I have).  Best served after chilling several hours and the sour cream has married with marshmallows causing them
to melt ever so slightly.  I also use 1/2 to 1 cup chopped walnuts in this too- this gives the salad an interesting  texture and a tiny bit of crunch.  The hint of flavor they add is heavenly!!

Awesome dessert salad. I know that kids must go ga-ga over this one. It was a bit too sweet for my taste, so next time I am going to omit the marshmallows and try some more fruit... I was thinking blueberries for a pretty color contrast.

Wow! Being Jewish (and in South Africa), I had never tried this recipe before. What a fantastic combination of flavours!I made this for my family, who all requested the recipe. I'm very impressed. Thank you for sharing this! (I'm going to try this next time with some tinned litchis for a more tropical flavour)

Our family has made this for at least 3 generations. We also add Maraschino cherries and chopped pecans. My dad's side of the family uses cool whip instead of sour cream. We make this for holidays every year and when I make it I stick some back in the fridge for later!

Wow! I never used to like this, but I tried some at a friend's house, and all of a sudden I had to have more! Found this quick recipe for what we call Ambrosia, and it is delicious! Very easy to make, and I had all the ingredients in the house. The kids wouldn't eat it, because it had coconut, so next time I will take a bit out for them before I add the coconut. What a great recipe!

My mom made this every Christmas,and it was always a hit.  I recently took it to a potluck picnic (I mean a HUGE bowl of it) and the bowl was all but licked clean. Always a safe bet when you're not sure what to take. 
On a side note, when I make it for my family, I use Tofutti (non-dairy) sour cream and leave out the marshmallows.

This very like my mom's "summer salad." Without fail, this dish is always gone at the end of a picnic. I omit the coconut per my mom's tradition, but other than that, this is a summer classic!

I made this for my daughter's Hawaiian luau & the girls thought it was okay. Actually, some loved it & others were grossed out (but hey, they are 10 years old). I enjoyed it - I know my mom used to make this when I was little. I don't know if I will have a craving for this again anytime soon - it is very sweet - but it is tasty.

My mother also made this salad every summer growing up.  However, she used an 8oz package of cream cheese instead of the sour cream.  Let the cheese soften and come to room temperature before trying to blend all ingredients. This is definetly an old time classic!

Perfect picnic salad.  I served it as a side dish with a casserole and it was a nice, light sweet accompaniment.  And it is soooo easy to throw together.  This is one of those easy recipes that you make over and over.

This was pretty good but I thought it needed a little doctoring up.  I tried to make it sweeter with more cool whip like someone else suggested.  As I was eating it I kept wondering how I could make it better, but my husband must have loved it the way it was, because he ate half the bowl with his lunch today!  I will make it again, with 1/2 and 1/2 sour cream and cool whip, a little more sugar and some bananas I think.

Loved this!  Didn't add quite as much coconut as we have some non-eaters in our family, but it was still wonderful.  Also mixed a bit of cream cheese in with the sour cream before adding fruit.  Really yummy!

This salad must sit overnight in order for the marshmallows  to melt down and change the sour cream into the sweet goodness.  That's where you get all your flavor from and I always add chopped pecans or walnuts. This is a delicious salad. I doubled the recipe for  a church function.

My Mother-in-law introduced me to this in 1964, but her recipe was actually better...  This was the garnish she used with a Gelatin Mould dessert she made with the juices drained off the fruit, heated and combined with a couple of sheets of Gelatin and cooled with a container of Orange Sorbet(sherbert).
She would pour this into an angelfood cake-shaped pan and when it was cooled and set, she inverted it onto a plate and it was filled and garnished with the 'ambrosia' 5 cup salad mixture. She was a lovely Hostess, all her dinner parties were devoted to the foods her kids treasured.   She was my husband's Stepmother, so I was doubly blessed as his Mom was even better.  My kids loved family dinners at their Grandparent's homes where they could show off their impeccable manners .

We've been making this for years... but with freshly made whipped cream instead of sour cream.
For those that don't like the taste with sour cream, might I suggest you use a cup of whipped cream (freshly whipped if possible).  So much better in my opinion.  (note adding some chopped pecans or walnuts as an add-in is also good but I guess you'd then have to call it either "5 1/2 cup salad" or "5 cup salad with pecans"

It is a great, light addition to a holiday menu. GREAT WAY to use up stale marshmallows- and stale PEEPS!! Peeps give it a great fun color.

Used mini fruit flavoured marshmellows to add Color. A little extra coconut.  My mother-in-law passed this on to me many years ago, she called it BRIDAL SHOWER SALAD !

Love this salad. Easy to make, and it's  liked by almost everyone.  I only use half of the coconut, and I use rainbow coloured mini marshmallows for colour. Yum!

Last year I made this recipe exactly as written, times 6, as one of 5 different dishes for my daughter's family/friends baby shower.  This year, one year later, my grandson requested this same recipe for his 16th birthday celebration. For a teenager to remember and request a specific dish he enjoyed...well, it just makes my heart sing.  Best to refrigerate the salad overnight so the flavors can blend.  Stir before serving.

My grandma has been making this for our family for 40 years or more.  I've never added the coconut before though.  We do add diced canned pears, drained, and use fat free sour cream.  ALL the children love it and even my husband, who doesn't like marshmellows, loves it!
