Tastes ok but terrible consistency . . all loose - not bound together properly, needs more flour, eggs and fruit to make it into a half decent Christmas pud. I think Aunty Caroline wants to keep it a secret and gave you the wrong recipe.

I lost the timing for this Christmas, but this recipe sure looks like the real thing I knew in Britain.
