I was a little scared of this recipe - but really curious about what radishes would be like cooked (plus I'm always looking for a little 'strange'). Great! The cooking time in this recipe is perfect, the radishes get softened - but still have a crispness to them. Cooking also brings out the 'rootiness' of the radish, but they are still peppery. I did end up adding more wine near the end for flavor, but really, if you 'salt & pepper to taste as the recipe suggests, you should have no problem with blandness. Thanks for the recipe - we'll do it again!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I went a little heavier with the wine.  Used different radishes and thyme out of the garden and will make this again soon.

My radishes took a few minutes longer to cook, so the color was almost entirely bleached out of them (although the sauce was very pretty) - I think next time maybe I'll try halving the radishes, especially if they're on the large size.  My only change was to use sherry instead of wine (realized I only had red wine on hand...) and the sherry added a nice flavor to this dish.  Pretty good, and I'll most likely make again when I'm looking for something "different".  Thanks!

I had a nearly full pound of radishes that needed to be used. Salad making wasn't using them fast enough and the kids wouldn't eat them anyways. Stumbled on this recipe because a photo on the home page photo contest. They turned out pretty good. Reminded me of turnips. The kids still wouldn't eat them, not even a taste, but I will still make them again when I've got a surplus of radishes. I baked them covered in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.

I followed the recipe, salted and peppered, etc. but did not care for this at all. My dad loves radishes so much and was looking forward to this, but even he didn't want to eat them. We will be eating them raw again from now on.

In my quest to shake up the veggies in my life, I stumbled across this recipe.  It's very delicious and makes a colorful plate.  My radishes did take much longer to cook than the recipe said. I think next time I will slice them in half.

Really great way to use radishes, which I normally don't eat.  Pleasant, slightly sweet taste which everyone likes.  Have made this several times and think it stands well without the thyme if you are out.  Either way, it's a unique use for radishes and will become a summer table staple in our house.

I made this recipe recently when my aunt gave me a lot of extra multi-colored radishes. I made this exactly as written, and found the radishes pretty bland. I don't think I will make these again, but this was a pretty and interesting way to use up surplus radishes. Thanks for sharing!

This was an interesting take on radishes.  I thought it was okay, but I wouldn't make it again.  My husband and children did not care for it and we ended up with most of the dish left over.

A bit bland. Possibly because I kept sauce on stove too long - really nothing to pour over radishes before serving.

Made exact, and it just wasn't our thing. I still prefer radishes raw.

Interesting but did not go over well in this household.
