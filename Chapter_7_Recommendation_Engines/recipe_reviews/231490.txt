This is light and delicious, and quite a nice change of pace from the same old chicken salad! I used pecans instead of walnuts and I halved the mayonnaise because I wanted the flavors of the ingredients to really come through instead being overpowered by the dressing. This may become a staple of my summertime diet -- it is refreshing and tasty!

I really hated this recipe. The mix of pineapple and mayo was a bad combination.

This was a good chicken salad-  i added one jalapeno pepper finely chopped and a half lime juiced  It made it a bit more "mexican"
