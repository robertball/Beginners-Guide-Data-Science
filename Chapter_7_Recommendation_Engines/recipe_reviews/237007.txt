These were down right delicious! The flavors were amazing. I used hoisin sauce bc it's all I had and also added some Worcester sauce and sweet chili to my marinade. This recipe is marvelous the way it is, however, I just had to improvise. My dad joined me for dinner and we killed these tacos!!

This is mostly for the slaw. We used leftover Asian pot roast for the meat, and I made a sauce out of teriyaki, sweet chili sauce, soy sauce,  minced garlic, and brown sugar to help rehydrate the meat. 
The slaw was pretty good. I tried pressing and squeezing the carrots and cucumber in paper towels and I doubled the slaw sauce. It's a nice different kind of slaw to have on hand and could probably be used as a salad dressing as well if I don't have slaw ingredients.

This has become one of my go-to dishes. I sub the steak with chicken, and if I donâ€™t have time to shred cucumbers / carrots, will use mixed greens instead.

This is one of my family's favorite meals. I have made it as listed and love it, but to make it easier i just buy a bag of broccoli slaw and use that instead of shredding carrots and cucumber.

Quick, easy and delicious! Only improved by making your own tortillas which is surprisingly easy and unbelievably amazing.

Loved it!  I added a couple of things, 1/2 t of Sriracha, 1/2 t sweet chili sauce, 1/2 t minced garlic added to the beef when cooking. This recipe is a keeper, I'm going to try it using different proteins like pork, chicken, shrimp!
