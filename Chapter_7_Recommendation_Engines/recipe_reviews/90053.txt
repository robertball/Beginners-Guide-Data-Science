Good recipe! I too baked them in the oven although I did 350  for about 20 minutes. I also used half and half for a richer scone instead of milk and used dried cherries! Rolled them out and cut them with a round cutter for a more traditional look! Easy to make!

Very good!  Just sweet enough, but not overly.  Be careful cooking them in the skillet in you have a gas stove- you'll want them thin and the heat very low.  For the sake of experimentation, I also baked a few in the oven- I liked them better from the skillet. Also, they (technically) should be called Scottish, as Scotch is a drink, not a people.  :-)

This recipe is amazing - my husband doesn't like raisins, so we usually omit them, but keep the rest of the recipe ingredients "as is".  We always cook in the oven, though, rather than on stovetop for about 20minutes at approximately 375F.

Makes lovely, moist scones. I used only half a cup of sugar, and they were plenty sweet enough, even for a sugar lover like me. I tried cooking half of them on the stove top, and half of them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes, and they both turned out quite well, although the ones cooked in the oven were a little bit drier. Either way, the best scone recipe I have found so far.

These just came out of the oven and I've already eaten two!!! they're delicious!! I cooked them in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes, like another user. Also, I had to use margarine since I didn't have enough butter. Next time I'll make sure I have butter on hand...and there were absolutely be a next time!!!

Yummy! This is the best scone recipe I have tried. The ones at the store are so sweet but most of the recipes I have found are so dry and tasteless. I tried several different kinds - plain, chocolate chip, and my favorite...blueberry with orange zest.

I loved this recipe and will definitely make again.  My family ate it up right away.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, cooking on the stove as directed, and was surprised at how well they came out after other reviewers suggested baking in the oven.  The only change I made was to substitute soymilk for milk.

Good, however, my dough came out very gooey; to which I simply added more flour.  Omitted the raisins and added coarsely chopped fresh cranberries and lemon zest.  Dropped dough onto a cookie sheet and baked in oven as other reviewers.

I loved the look, taste,and how easy they were to make.  I did change rasins to crasins.  They had better color and flavor.  I also added 1 TBS grated orange rind it it went great with the crasins.

They fell apart when flipping on the griddle. So I spooned the rest of the batter onto a cookie sheet and baked it. It tastes good though.

Great recipe! Thanks! I needed something to accompany soup for dinner, but I didn't want to wait for the oven to preheat. These were different, but great, like a combination between pancakes, biscuits, and cookies.

What a sticky mess!! I followed recipe exactly and the dough was way to sticky to work with.  I kept adding flour and it was still sticky.  Maybe instead of 3/4 cups of butter you use less butter.  I really think less butter may help with it being so sticky.   I don’t think I’ll make these again!!!!

Delicious! Baked at 375 for 20 min and they turned out great.  Will definitely bake again.  And raisins were good in them!

I baked half in the oven and cooked half in the pan. The key to making it in the pan is make them very thin. When you make them in the pan they do get a good crispy outside. They reminded me more of something closer to a pancake. Still very good.

As far as I'm aware, this recipe originates not from Scotland but from Wales in the U.K. and are actually called 'Welsh Cakes'. They are absolutely delicious, especially when sliced in half and spread with jam.Try cutting and shaping dough into rounds.

Delicious!Only complaint is they were a bit sweet so I scaled back the sugar to about half... I also simply rolled each piece of dough into a ball about the size of a small ping pong ball and placed them onto the griddle where I smashed them down with a spatula and cooked on one side and then flipped them.  Good with milk or anything!

Deeelish!  I just made these. I added a small amount more flour but it's a rather hot day here. I will defiantly make again. 
*tips*
1) make sure you roll them thin like the recipe says or just make balls and squish them down flat on the pan (both worked fine for me) 
2) place them on a fairly hot pan they will create a better crust for flipping and puff up better
3) placement on the pan I automatically placed these scone distance which makes them difficult to flip so think pikelet/pancake spacing so you have room to fit.
4) these turn almost liquid when heated due to the butter content
5) try not to flip them to much just once is best otherwise they start to fall a part
