I used 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes instead of the red chile pepper, 1 tsp. dried basil instead of fresh, 1/4 cup mascarpone cheese instead of 2/3 cup, and I threw in a pound of cooked shrimp at the end -- delicious indeed!  Will definitely make it again.

My fiance and I loved this recipe!  I used crushed red pepper flakes instead of fresh red chile pepper and added twice the amount because we love our food a little spicier.  Also, I sadly cut the amount of onions by half thinking it'd be too onion-y, but should've just used the original amount in retrospect.  I didn't have basil on hand, but the sauce came out just as tasty!  I added Polska Kielbasa to the sauce, and it was very complementary with the textures and flavors of the sauce.  This recipe is delicious with garlic bread or knots!

This was a very tasty pasta sauce! I didn't have any fresh red chili pepper, so I added 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes instead. It gave the sauce a nice kick! I topped penne with it, sprinkled fresh chopped italian parsley for a dash of color and grated fresh parmesan on top before serving. Nice flavor!

Oh My Goodness!  THAT is Delicious!  That's the best tomato-based pasta sauce I have ever had (let alone created myself).  I can't wait to share it with friends tonight (will let you know that they think).
I too used Red Pepper flakes (2 tsp- cause that's what finally gave it a little bit of a kick).
I didn't have the Marscapone cheese, so I used this as a substitute (make in proportion to the 2/3 cup called for... I loosedly made 1/2 of the following: 8 oz cream cheese + 1/4 c heavy cream+ 2 1/2 T. sour cream).
Make this and your friends and family will RAVE about it!  Enjoy!

This recipe needs more attention. It is excellent. And I imagine it is good as is, but I made the following changes:

> I first sautéed four italian sausages and two very thinly sliced chicken breasts. Once browned and cooked through, I removed them, added a bit more EVOO, and sautéed the onions and garlic in the EVOO and meat fat.

> I added two bay leaves along with the diced tomatoes and other ingredients; I also shredded the chicken and sliced the sausage and threw them in with the diced tomatoes to allow them to stew and soak up the sauce's flavor.

> I also added a small can of tomato paste to make the sauce a bit thicker.

I doubt the sauce needed all this, but with these additions this sauce was amazing. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This is a very, very good recipe.  I did substitute dried red pepper flakes (a pinch) and about a teaspoon of dried basil.  Our whole family loves it.  I make a double batch and freeze it in single serving size containers for our daughter who is a vegetarian.  She can quickly heat it and have a vegetarian pasta meal.

What's not to love about tomatoes, basil, balsamic vinegar, and sinfully creamy mascarpone cheese?  The spiciness knocks this sauce out of the park.  I like to make this recipe when I need to use up some extra onions.  Thanks ANGIBEAN!

This recipe should be a prep time of 5 minutes and a cook time of 25 minutes (total time 30 min). A quick easy meal. I forgot to say add it to your favourite pasta (I use Penne)but any pasta would do. Top with fresh grated parmasan and extra fresh basil.

Other reviews helped make it this good by calling out 1) using the whole onion because really was not too oniony with the whole onion and 2) using crushed red pepper. I used 3/4 tbsp. I could probably even do a full tbsp., but I really like spicy.

Made this exactly as is, minus the red chili pepper. Instead I substituted red chili flakes and Cajun seasoning. Added shrimp at the end, and served over fettuccini topped with Parmesan & fresh parsley. Delicious!

Absolutely yummy.  Maybe modified some of the salt and pepper levels but otherwise it was absolutely awesome. Hubby loved, loved, loved it and was so disappointed that there was not more to enjoy. Making it again for sure!

it definitely made more than four servings. I was expecting a lot more from this recipe. The Taste is just average and I had to add a lot more heat to make it spicy.

Loved it!  It was hot and spicy but the mascarpone gave it a wonderful creamy feel.  I added hot Italian sausage and used crushed red pepper instead of the chile pepper.  The left over sauce is in the freezer and I can't wait to have it again.  The recipe is easy and delicious!

This is a gorgeous fra diavolo variant - I built a pasta dish with shrimp and used this sauce to top it.  I experimented with the amount of mascarpone - it dissolves and blends into a rich, silky/creamy part of the sauce.  Huzzah!
