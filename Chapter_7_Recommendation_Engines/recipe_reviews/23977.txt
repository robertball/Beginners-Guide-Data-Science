This recipe was quite good, but I did it a bit differently....I used chicken breasts that I put in the food processor and pulsed until it resembled minced chicken.  (Worked great)  Couple of bulbs of minced garlic in the oil with the onions and meat.  Instead of chili oil, I omitted the sugar all together and used Sweet Chili Sauce.  Added some bok choy and carrots towards the last couple of minutes.  A splash of Fish Sauce/Patis and some freshly chopped cilantro.  It was a big hit.

We have updated this recipe to call for ground pork instead of mincemeat. There had been an error in translation.

I thought this recipes was alright. I thought the sauce was way to salty. Maybe using low-sodium soy sauce. Hubby didn't like it at all. I served him a plate and he didn't eat it. He made himself a micrave dinner instead. He said it was too dry and I added a bit of water as stated. I will not do it again.  =/

Um, I'm pretty sure the term "mincemeat" should read "minced meat" - as in ground beef, pork, etc.  Using that sweet mixture of chopped fruits that's usually used in pies and tarts just doesn't make any sense.   I used ground pork and my Malaysian wife loved it.  I was a bit skeptical of the use of spaghetti noodles, but apparently it does taste something like Mee Goreng.  Her only advice was to add more chile sauce

This was terribly sweet, and the sweetness of it completely overpowered the flavor of the chile sauce. I'm going to try it again using rice noodles instead of spaghetti, replacing the mincemeat with raisins, at least doubling the chile sauce mixture, and adding crushed red pepper.

The consistency with the egg and the pork is odd which isn't what you want when eating a plain dish like this.

A little plain, needed more flavor, but overall not bad.  It definitely did not need the sugar...
