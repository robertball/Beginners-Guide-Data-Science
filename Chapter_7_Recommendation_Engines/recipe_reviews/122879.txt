This was a dense bread with a lovely autumn color.  I served it hot out of the oven with "Cinnamon Honey Butter" and my husband and kids gobbled it up.  I used my KitchenAid mixer's dough hook and after 6-8 minutes found the dough to be quite sticky (and lost a good bit of the dough that would not come off my hands). I ended up adding perhaps 3/4 C more flour and 5 more minutes of kneading time to get a smooth, elastic dough.  For those of you who rely on prep times, don't forget to add the rising time!

I altered this recipe quite a bit, i didn't have caraway seeds so i went in a different direction by using 1/4t Cardamom, 1/4t Pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 C raisins, and sprinkled with turbinado sugar.  I did follow the kneading/rising directions.  My only complaint: It took 7 cups of flour to form a dough!!!  I actually ran out of APflour after adding 4Cups, and used WWflour for the rest.  Obviously when making bread, the flour is never EXACT, but this was WAY off.  It was really delicious and customizable.  I will definitely make it again, next time i'll use the dough hook on the kitchen aid because it was really sticky...and now i know to make sure i'm stocked up on flour!

Very tasty recipe! I did add 3 tbsp of gluten flour to add more to the rise and I also used pumpkin spice (roughly a few tsps) instead of caraway. I put all the ingredients in the bread maker which kept me from having to add any flour to the recipe. I basted with cinnamon honey maple butter before the final rise and baked at 400 like the recipe called for. It is delicious! My son especially likes it for his PB and J sandwiches and my husband says it really good for roast beef too.

Amazing! Simply amazing! It was easy to make. The dough was sticky, but it was not unmanageable. I did not use the caraway seed, but replaced it with pumpkin pie spice. I was nervous about putting squash in anything, but this was fantastic. The bread was the perfect density. It's great hot with some melted butter on it. *sigh* I'm in heaven!

I really enjoyed this bread, and I'd like to experiment with it a little more. I used kabocha squash. The predominant flavors are caraway and the molasses sweetness; I'd like to try using fennel seeds instead, and maybe adding some golden raisins. Gorgeous sunny color. I let the dough rise, punched it down, shaped it, and put it in a greased loaf pan. I refrigerated it overnight loosely covered with greased plastic wrap, and pulled it out the next morning. I let it come up to room temp and then baked it as directed.

I found this recipe looking for a new way to use some of the butternut squash from my garden.  I've made it twice now and the first time it was a bit too dense.  This was my fault though - I roast my squash, put it through a food mill, then strain out the excess water, so my squash puree is more concentrated than the mashed squash that the recipe calls for.  The second time I made the bread, I reduced the squash puree to 2/3 cup, and added 3 teaspoons of gluten to the dough, and got a much better second rise.  I omitted the caraway because I don't care for it, and the second time I made the bread, I used 1/2 cup of Bob's Red Mill 10 grain cereal in place of 1/2 cup of flour.  It's a great recipe as written but I like the texture that the cereal gives the bread.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a very hearty, dense, yummy bread.  It may have been a bit too dense - next time I'll give it more rising time.  A fabulous breakfast treat toasted and buttered or with cream cheese.

Really good flavor.  As others reviewers have noted, it is indeed a dense bread.  I used half white whole wheat flour and half bread flour.  I didn't measure the last half of the flour I added, so I'm going to guess I used no more than 4 cups...probably just a bit less.  I didn't want the bread to be dry, so I left the dough a bit sticky...still easy to work with, though.  I don't like caraway, so i added a splash of vanilla to the dough, and I used organic canned butternut squash.  I really like the hint of molasses flavor, and I know this is going to be even better with fresh squash...I'm trying with sweet potatoes, too!  Oh, and I did add a bit of vital wheat gluten to help with the rise and the texture since I used part whole wheat.  I think next time I'll use some cracked wheat, too, for texture.  It's a great dough to experiment with!

I like this bread.  Chewy crust, yet soft inside, so should be good for the bf (he hasn't tried it yet).  I like the taste of caraway, but if you aren't so fond of it, I'd leave it out and either sub something else or leave it alone . . the caraway is what makes this bread pop, so if you want a plainer bread, leave it out.  I was going to add vital wheat gluten but forgot; I didn't have any issues with this rising, though, and actually only let it rise for about 15-20 mins before I put it in the oven; otherwise I'd have had to start all over bc it would've risen to high.   I also just roasted 1 lb of cut and peeled butternut squash for 1 hr at 350 in my oven, then let cool and mashed it.  This made about 2 cups of mashed squash, and I doubled the recipe to adjust.   thanks for the recipe!

Mine came out just like the picture and very yummy.  But I had to use WAY more flour, at least 4.5 cups.
