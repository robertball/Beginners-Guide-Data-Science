I cut this recipe in half because I made it as a side dish to go with steak and it still made quite a bit. Other than cutting in half, I followed the recipe EXACTLY. I have never cooked with canned cheese soup before so I was a little worried. I didn't like the smell of the soup as I was mixing this together and was starting to regret using it, but I must say after it came out of the oven it smelled really good, and it tasted incredibly delicious. It was everyone's favorite thing on their plate and I made a LOT of food tonight for our Valentine's Day steak dinner. I liked how easy it was to prepare...not requiring a roux. I will most definitely be making this again!!

Think it could have used a little variety on the cheese, but it was good and we'll probably make it again. Quick and easy

I made this with 2 cups shredded Monterrey Jack instead of the cheddar, 14 oz. of Maine lobster and 11 slices of bacon crumbled and it was fabulous and well received. Next time I'll throw in some cayenne pepper and paprika to kick it up a notch.

Amazing!! I used imitation crab instead and added onions when I sautéed the bacon which I cut up into small pieces prior to sautéing! Husband and I both loved it!

Quick and easy and super yummy! I tweaked the recipe a bit to my own liking by adding 1 cup of Colby jack cheese and one cup of pepper jack cheese 1/4 cup more milk and a little bit of green onion to the mixture before baking I also took the butter I used to cook the lobster in to my panko for extra flavor. Will definitely be making this again

This was delicious.  The only modifications I made were to use more lobster (because you only live once) and I added a small amount of chopped green onion. Lobster is expensive but, if you substitute something else, you are short-changing this recipe.

I made this recipe as is and I will let you know my husband loved it. I, on the other hand, thought that it needed 'something'. Not sure I liked the cheddar cheese soup angle for the sauce. But it was very easy to make and made a 8X8 pan that would serve 6 very easily.

This was very good and easy.  I bought cans of Kroger Mac and cheese sauce (aged cheddar with bacon) instead of the cheddar cheese soup and I added some sautéed onions. I’ll make it again!

This turned out absolutely amazing!!!  I added some sautéed diced onions to the mix and it was fabulous.  Never thought I could create something so creamy and delicious.  I was hesitant at first with the cheese soup, but now I can't wait to go back to the store and get more cans to have on hand!  Can't wait to make it again.

Super easy and delish. We used leftover lobster meat from a previous dinner so this was a great use of it. I halved the recipe based on reviews and for two I have plenty of leftovers. I used Italian panko crumbs. Delish!

I love this recipe although Lobster isn't cheap.  I get one package of frozen Lobster meat and two packages of chunky style, fake crab instead.  I also like to experiment with different kinds of curly pasta noodles.  It has become a real family favorite especially when we have a crowd.

I read all the reviews and added a few things,  cut up shrimp I cooked first in a little butter on the stove, more milk, and some aged crumbled Parmesan,  some chili powder and garlic to spice it up.  I also made this but did NOT cook it until the day of the dinner party - just add a bit more milk, then cook it up fresh.  I made a side dish of this for the hubs with about 1 cup of the macaroni, 2/3 of the cheese sauce, and crumbled hot cooked sausage and bacon.  I added some horseradish for some kick..He doesn't like fish much but he loved this dish! I will be making this again for a potluck dinner probably BOTH versions.

It got 4 out of 5 only because it doesn't reheat well.  I read the reviews and made a tweak. Lobster is EXPENSIVE I got 10 ounces of lobster which was almost $17. To get the extra 2ounces It would have been another $14 for 5 ounces. Instead I tossed a handful of small shrimp chopped up.  I sautéed the shrimp and lobster in butter with some green onion and garlic. Everyone has seconds and my husband and I finished the rest just before midnight.

I used Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup instead of plain cheese soup and it turned out awesome! I think it would be pretty bland as originally posted. My husband took seconds so I know it was good! I also used packaged bacon pieces instead of cooking bacon and I actually think it was better for it, the Hormel bacon pieces have so much flavor. Most excellent!

the dh had three helpings...but I tweaked it...added green onions and garlic and white pepper and a bag of shredded creamy garlic herb cheese instead of cheddar coz that is what I had...I used imitation lobster (2 pkgs) and skipped the panko/butter crumbs on top... and used spring like pasta noodles... I know I did a lot of changes but it was so easy and tasty I will make it again and probably do it alittle different...but it is a great recipe in my opinion ... thanks

All my guest at my valentine dinner loved this recipe. The only change i made was I used panceata instead of bacon. Delicious!
