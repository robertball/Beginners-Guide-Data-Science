Resembles NOTHING close to a traditional pie crust.  As the recipe stands the dough is too wet.  I added an additional 2T brown rice flour which helped.  I also added 1/2 tsp. cider vinegar and placed in freezer for 20 min. hoping to create a crispy crust.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.  Has a very mealy taste and texture.

I was looking for a gluten-free alternative for a graham cracker crust and this fit the bill. I used oat flour and almond flour with the brown rice flour instead of grinding my own. Approximately 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon of oat flour and 1 big tablespoon of almond flour (not the super fine.
