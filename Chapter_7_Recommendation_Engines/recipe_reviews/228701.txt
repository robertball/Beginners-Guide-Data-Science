We LOVED this.  I also breaded the chicken using the milk, flour, egg and bread crumb combo thanks to the suggestion in a previous review (Colorado Trio);  I used chicken breasts but sliced them into three pieces or so before I breaded.  We ate this meal without the spaghetti because we stay away from too many carbs.  I had plenty of chicken, we had a salad on the side and it was yummy!  I didn't add anything extra to the sauce.  This is going to be a regular during the school year! Easy and delicious.

This was a HUGE hit in my house! I loved the simplicity of the recipe, and yet the flavor was delicious.  I did prepare it by cooking the chicken fully in the pan and then placing the chicken, with the sauce poured over the top, in the oven for about 10 minutes.  I believe this is what allowed the sauce to thicken up.  I served it along side pasta and breadsticks.  A definite keeper in my house!

First of all I subbed chicken tenderloins for the whole chicken breast so that it cooked quicker without drying. I used my method of breading by mincing about 8 cloves of garlic and tossing the chicken tenders in a zip lock with 1/4 cup olive oil & the garlic. Let it sit in the frig while I prepped my panko/cheese mixture. Tossed the marinated chicken tenders as directed and prepared as directed. This was very tasty with all the additions though I do wish the sauce was just a bit thicker. I might make this again, but I will reduce the recipe starter sauce a bit before I add it to the chicken.

Oh wow, this was delicious. I did make a few changes to this. First, I used thin chicken breasts, then dipped them in an egg/milk mixture before covering them with bread crumbs. Used a 9 X 13 pan that fit 6 thin breasts in. Poured 1/4 cup melted butter over chicken, then added sauce (added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic to sauce) and cheese. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes. The chicken and sauce had the best flavor! Family devoured it!

I don't usually like sauces out of a can, soup out of a can, anything processed really! I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. This was SO easy and made dinner really fast and my family happy. Also, not much clean up which is a plus! I think I would make this again for an easy meal. Didn't change anything other than adding more cheese on top!

VERY GOOD!  This meal really came together fast and was very enjoyable.  I served it over fettuccine.  I'm giving it four stars because I needed to cook at a lower temperature and the sauce needs tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, or something else to thicken it.  It was too thin.  I was worried that it would be too spicy for us "older folks" but it was not.  I would make this again but with the sauce thickened.  Thank you Progresso Recipe Starters for another fast delicious meal.

We thought this was "OK". Based on other reviews I made adjustments. I marinated the chicken for about 30min in Italian dressing & garlic before dredging in the panko. I also opted to bake the chicken (I'd used tenders) in a 350degree oven for about 25 min. I knew immediately what others meant about the sauce being too thin, so I made a roux of 2t oil & 2t flour, browned that & then added the Progresso Recipe Starter. Brought that to a boil & simmered a few minutes while the chicken finished up. I did have to add additional seasoning to the sauce as well to fit our tastes. Poured some of the liquid in with chicken (as per recipe) and topped with mozz & remaining crumb mix & popped back in the oven for about 5 more minutes. Like I said, it was OK, but I will probably stick with my regular method for chicken parmesan.

This was such a great meal...Loved how tender the chicken turned out, and it was even white meat! I changed up the breading method a little...first I dipped into milk, then flour, then egg, then the panko (learned this from tonkatsu)...turned out beautiful.  Also, I used breast tenderloins instead of full breasts.  Didn't have to alter the sauce at all...yum!

It was very good and easy to put together. I used boneless chicken thighs because that's what I had on hand. It turned out fine. It's a great switch from spaghetti and meatballs. I enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing.

This was alright.  Need a better method to get the crumbs to stick.  The garlic browns too much and tastes burnt.  The sauce has a rather strong roasted pepper taste compared to roasted tomato.  The crumbs get soggy when the chicken cooks in the sauce, and the sauce gets all crumb-y.  Not bad, but I'll stick with my usual chicken parm.

Very easy and I loved this sauce, served with spaghetti and lots of extra parm. Delicious! Don't forget to add your leftover bread crumbs to thicken the sauce!

When I first opened the can and looked at/tasted the sauce, I was less than impressed, but once it baked w/ the chicken and cheese it was good! I had to do this a bit differently b/c I had 6 breasts and they were super big, so they wouldn't all fit in the pan...I breaded the chicken (using an egg wash first...sorry, it's a habit, lol), and browned it on both sides. I then placed the chicken onto a cookie sheet and baked it in the oven about 10-15 mins., just until it was done. I took it out of the oven and topped it w/ the sauce and mozzarella. I put it back in about another 5-10 mins. until the cheese was melted and it was all bubbly. I do have to say, that I wish the sauce was a bit thicker, though...Thanks for sharing. :)

Followed recipe and also incorporated advice of  others. Used milk & egg to coat chicken also baked in oven for 10 mins. Put cheese on right before oven. Delicious!

Very good! I pressed panko crumbs in to the chick breasts instead of shaking in a bag and added garlic powder to the crumbs and sauce.

I'd definitely use some egg to increase the layer of breading. I ended up using some leftover Prego w/ water instead of the Progresso mix; would like to try the "real" recipe some time, though. Last, I added some salt to the breading, which I feel added to the flavor and kept the juices in.

Delicious and easy! I cut the chicken up in bite size pieces to have more breading and to use less chicken and make it go further.I used one chicken breast and 1/4 cup Parmesan with 1/4 bread crumbs and that was perfect. I also added salt and pepper to breading mixture.

Big hit in my house. I marinated my chicken in the sauce for 30 min before breading them because other reviews said the chicken was bland. Mine was full of flavor and very moist. We would love to have this again for dinner. Thanks!

This was so, so good!  I was a little worried because the ingredients were so easy.  But, it was very flavorful, the chicken was tender and juicy.  I couldn't find Progresso Recipe Starters so I used Marinara sauce and I used flat, wide noodles instead of the spaghetti.  The family loved it and it  has now replaced my old recipe I had as my favorite.    Oh, I added ground garlic because the recipe doesn't say what to do with the chopped garlic and I didn't want to add them to the bag of bread crumbs/parmesan.

The finished product was good, but prep time took a bit more than 10 minutes. Directions say to pour sauce "around" the chicken; next time I would go with "over and around". I think a good pasta sauce would work just as well, but bought product on sale so it was good.  My husband loved it. I will make again. I also chose to mix breading on plate and press chicken into it itstead of using the bag.

We really enjoyed this.  I used an eggwash to help with getting the breadcrumbs/cheese to stick.  I also added a can of seasoned diced tomatoes.  It was great and easy for a weeknight meal.

I did this in the oven to save a few calories. I realize it's a sponsored recipe but I used my homemade whole wheat bread crumbs & my canned marinara sauce. Sauteed some mushrooms in a pan and added them casserole style to finish with the fresh mozz in the oven. It was really good!

We were very surprised by this recipe, and the recipe starter. The only thing I did differently was to do an egg coating on the chicken -- shaking the naked breasts didn't work so well, and I wanted them to be nice and crispy. This is quick, easy and very good just as written.

Well, it went together quickly, and it didn't require a lot of skills or utensils.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added the garlic after I turned the chicken.  Adding it too soon can cause it to burn.  DH and DS liked this, and I found the chicken to be fork tender.  Smelled great while cooking, and it was tasty on the tongue, but there was just a "tad" of bitterness after swallowing that was distracting.

This is pretty good, I made it exactly as directed but used 4 half chicken breasts. There was plenty of sauce for the spaghetti. The family like it a lot. I don't ordinarily make things using processed 'starters' but I might keep a can of this around for a quick dinner, just in case.

This was really easy and delicious! I used packaged thin sliced chicken breasts, I mix the Panko breading with garlic powder, sea salt, and shredded Parmesan cheese in a dish and made an egg and milk wash in another dish. I dipped them in the egg wash and dredged them in the Panko breading then browned them in olive oil in a pan. I couldn’t find the Progresso recipe starter sauce, so I use Classico roasted tomato and garlic pasta sauce. After I brown the chicken I put it in a 9 x 13 dish on top of the sauce and covered it with plenty of mozzarella cheese shreds. I baked in the oven for about 20 minutes, and served it with Vermicelli noodles. My only issue was getting the shredded park to stick to the chicken, I think next time I will use powdered parm as I think the finer texture would act more like flour and stick better, some people have said the chicken itself was bland, but I thin my thin slices allowed the garlic and salt to flavor the chicken better and the olive oil adds some subtle flavor as well! Overall my family loved it and this recipe is a keeper for me!

My  husband is very picky and he loved this ! My Mom ask for the recipe.  It’s a keeper.
I used gluten products  , flour and Pablo .
Also I was running low  on olive oil so I brown the chicken  In canola oil.  
I served it with a salad .  Next time I’ll use a little more sauce ( Classico ) and serve it over pasta. 
Try it ! You’ll love it.

Hubby and kids LOVED this!  My daughter helped me bread the breasts (milk, flour, egg and then Progresso Italian bread crumbs), which was fun for her and allowed us to spend some quality time together. I browned both sides of the chicken breasts in the pan and then put them in a baking dish with Bertoli organic olive oil, garlic and basil spaghetti sauce (I couldn't find the Progresso starter) and then put the mozzarella cheese on top and put them in the oven at 350 degrees for 9 minutes, or until the middle of the breasts were  165 degrees measured w/the thermometer.  Served it on top of angel hair pasta! It wasn't difficult to make and turned out delicious.  This will now be a staple meal for us. Thank you!

I'm a vegetarian and my boyfriend isn't, so I used this recipe to make 1/2 eggplant, half chicken.  I also dipped the eggplant & chicken in egg first, and put everything in the oven for about 10 minutes to melt the cheese.  It was great!

This was ok for us.  If I ever made this again I would crush the garlic and take it out of the oil after it became fragrant.  I thought the chopped garlic had a very bitter taste being cooked the way it was.

This was actually really good, better than I had anticipated and the whole family enjoyed it and said they'd eat it again!  I did increase the quantities of the ingredients (except for the Progresso Recipe Starters Fire Roasted Tomato Cooking Sauce) because I had 5 chicken breasts to cook and I used sliced mozzarella instead of shredded.  The only other change I made was that after cooking the chicken breasts I did deglaze the skillet with about a half cup of red wine, let it cook down and then I added the cooking sauce.  I'd definately make this again!
