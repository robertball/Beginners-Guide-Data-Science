Delicious recipe! Even my some what picky kids ate it and one of them asked for seconds! I used dried basil instead of fresh. I'm not sure how much I used but I'd estimate maybe a tablespoon to 1.5 tablespoons. I originally found this recipe on the kraft website.  The recipe is pretty much the same except on the kraft website they want you to use a 10oz tub of Philadelphia original cooking creme.  I add more pasta sauce too.  The jars I get are 24-26 oz and I use the whole thing.

Very good...made some alterations by adding some adobo seasoning and some catalina dressing while cooking the meat with inions and peppers.  Will definitely make again!

Had to tweak for on hand ingredients.  Cream cheese made it very tasty and I liked it a lot.  Didn't have fresh basil, but used a Basil pasta sauce from Newman's own I think.  Threw in some red pepper flakes for a little kick and some minced garlic too. My 14 yr old gave it a "definitely make again" rating!

This was a very tasty comfort food. You definitely need to add some salt. Other than that, it was great. Will make again. Note: I did not refrigerate and cook at a later time. I popped it in the oven right away and it came out delicious.

This got 4 stars due to the fact on a busy night I could just pop it in the oven but really nothing special. I added some garlic to the sauce mixture as my family loves garlic. I also was a bit short on the cream cheese since my family didn't realize it was for a meal. I will make again but only because I can make it the night before

This was very good. I am not used to making things ahead so this was something new to try.  
I used some big rotini pasta from ALDI that was perfect!  Tweak as you know how but the basic recipe is great as is.

So good and easy to make! Instead of ground beef, I diced up steak strips. The kids loved it. Will definitely add it to my family-favorites and put it in the rotation.

Used mozzarella instead of cream cheese and topped with nacho cheese instead of mozzarella. Added crushed red pepper for spice.

Excellent flavour! I have made several times. It has be one a family favourite, fussy kids included. I use half a tube of basil pesto instead of fresh or dried. Don't even have to make ahead. But the leftovers taste even better the next day:)

Excellent dish. I will definitely make it again but I may try substituting ground Italian sausage in place of the ground beef.

Holy moly!  This is now in my rotation of meals.  We LOVED this version of baked stuffed shells.  I sautéed onions, then added garlic before cooking the meat.  Awesome dish, thank you for sharing!

I made this last week for supper. Pretty simple to make which is great in my house! And it tasted amazing. My husband was saying it looked and smelt so yummy before it was even done cooking. Even my 4yr old picky eater ate it!

Looking at the ingredients, it looked like something my family would like but for some reason, nobody could eat it. None of us could eat more than 1/4 of our plates.
