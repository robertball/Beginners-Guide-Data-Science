Good recipe, but I made a few changes.  I simmered the beans for 1.5 hrs and put in my crock pot. Then I used some fried bacon instead of ham, crumbled, and no molasses but a little more brown sugar. All else the same. Cooked on low overnight in my crock pot, about 10 hrs.   Had to add a little more water to thin. Delicious!

Loved the recipe- changed a few things- fried one onion and green pepper with 2 cloves of garlic- added this to the slow cooker.  I also add one can of tomato paste to reduce the ketchup. Reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup. Instead of boiling the beans, i just cooked them longer in the slow cooker- 8 hours on high.  Turned out perfect

I made mine a little bit differently using a full 2 small bags of navy beans and I soaked fro 6 hours first,  I added the rest of the ingredients, but I used 1/2 cup of molasses, I baked for 5 hours in a crock pot, and then I turned the crock off.  Next day ( game day )I continued to bake for another 6 hours on low, and then I added about 2 tsp salt.  ALL the excess liquid had been absorbed, the beans were tender.  Now I hate beans, I always have, but these were very good, and THEEEEEE hit at the super bowl party at the local VFW!
GREAT recipe!

Delicious, been searching can stop now.  I simmered the beans for a hour the night before, left it sitting overnight.  Changed water simmer again for hour.  They were soft and yummy.  A bit sweet for me so next time will cut down the brown sugar, and maybe add some bacon.

I loved this recipe!I did change somethings. I used canned beans instead.I did use the liquid from them and next time I will rinse them before using them. I omitted the ham. I still cooked them all day in the crock pot. This recipe was a winner with my family.

delicious! I used home made diced bacon in place of ham and was very happy with the results. it says 7 to 9 hrs in slow cooker on low...give it the full 9 hours with the last hour on high for tender soft beans.

I left out the ketchup and used real onions. It needs to bake it in a slow oven in order to give it time to dry out the water, you just cannot rush making beans from scratch!

I skipped the boil on stove part. Used 16 oz bag of dried navy brand, soaked them for 14 hours. Cooked in crockpot on high heat for 4 hours then on low for 6 more hours. The consistency was good, taste was a little bitter so I added 1/4 cup more brown sugar.

These are the only beans I will ever make.  Period.  I tend to soak my beans a bit longer than this recipe calls for, since they don't get cooked quite enough otherwise.  I also add more bacon, because....bacon.  I have gotten rave reviews on this, and when they find out it's all from scratch people make a huge deal about it.  It's so easy!

Mine were pretty runny, but I'm pretty sure that's all my fault and I dumped in too much water.  I used already cooked beans (I cooked up loads a few months ago and froze them, so I used those) so skipped the cooking the beans part.  I just started from the third step.  I used ham lunch meat (all I had) and other than it being runny, everyone seemed to enjoy.  I put it on the crock pot on high for about 4 hours since we wanted them for lunch.  I thought they were too sweet, but hubs disagreed--I'm not a fan of sweet beans--he thought they were perfect.  Thanks for the recipe! Update 1/25/15: We made this a second time with already cooked beans and less water . . .as well as less ketchup since we'd run out of it at 1 cup.  Hubs added about a 1/2 c of bbq sauce instead, and he said that he liked these a bit better than before.  I agree actually; the bbq sauce makes the flavor pop and be bolder than without.  all in all, this is a good recipe that holds up well to adjustments.  Thanks again!
