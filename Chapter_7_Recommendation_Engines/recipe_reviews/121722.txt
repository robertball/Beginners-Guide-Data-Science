Original review Tuesday, January 27, 2009: For the meatballs, I used crushed Ritz crackers, as that's all I had on hand. I also added some sage and cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp. I used my small cookie dough scoop to make uniform meatballs. When I cooked them, I cooked them halfway, drained off the fat, then added the thickened sauce. When I made the sauce, I cut back on the ketchup by a 1/4 c. and used 1/4 c. hickory BBQ sauce. I also sauteed the onion and some minced garlic in a tbsp. of butter until brown, then added the sauce ingredients. It came together nicely. I've always hesitated making homemade meatballs but with the small cookie scoop, it wasn't difficult. And cooking it in the oven was a total cinch. I'm never cooking it on the stove in a frying pan ever. again. The flavor of these was wonderful. I served it with mashed potatoes and leftover broccoli salad from last night and roasted garlic cauliflower. I'll make these again for sure. Everyone loved these, even my husband who went back for thirds! EDITED AGAIN: We were fighting over the leftovers next day. They were even better! EDITED AGAIN: Now that I've made these over and over, I still do half BBQ sauce and half ketchup, I add two tbsp. of dijon mustard and a couple good shakes of liquid smoke. Even better.

I used frozen meatballs from GFS because it is just so easy. I only added some bbq sauce to the sauce. These were delicious.

I actually turned the meat mixture to meatloaf, and covered the loaf with the mixture of ketchup, bbq sauce and worcestershire.  The meatloaf is very very tender, not tough at all.  This is the best meatloaf I've ever had.

Thumbs Way Up for this one.  My husband and I both LOVED them.  I followed the recipe, all but scaling it to half as it is just the two of us.  I used hickory smoked bacon and it added just a hint of smokiness that was nice.  Served them with boiled new potatoes in a garlic butter, and green beans.Thanks for a great recipe!!!!  I will be making these a couple of times a month from now on.

Loved this!!! It was a little too sweet for me, but my 5 year old LOVED IT. I'll make these again and cut back a smidge on the brown sugar and add a little hot sauce. Served over mashed taters, made my little dude the happiest boy ever.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was pretty good. The meatballs themselves were tasty, but the sauce was a bit vinegary, I'll cut back on it next time. Also, the sauce was pretty thin, which was kinda dissapointing.Overall, it's good though. Thanks!

SAUCE REVIEW ONLY:  Needed a last minute addition to a "too-skimp" menu, but was pressed for time so I took a cheat and used frozen premade meatballs with the sauce in this recipe.  The sauce was perfect and I got a lot of rave reviews--no one could believe I used frozen meatballs!

Made these almost exactly as directed, although I did reduce the salt a bit (figured the saltines had it covered).  These are great!  I made the meatballs a bit larger than called-for -- ended up making only ten.  Next time (maybe even for a holiday potluck this coming weekend), I'll make 'em smaller, so there'll be more to go around!  I'm thinking I'll acompany them with a small tub of buttered noodles....  Sauce is perfect.  No need to enhance or substitute anything.  Nice mix of sweet and tangy.... Thanks, Toni!

These had such amazing reviews, I really expected to like these more. Sorry! I thought they were just ok, but my husband did love them. I liked the meatballs themselves a lot, but I didn't care for the chili powder taste in the sauce and also the sauce was more watery that I would have liked. I did love not having to fry the meatballs so I think I will try the meatball recipe again and just change the sauce up a little bit.

I added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2 TSP yellow mustard to the meat mixture. Also cut the ketchup to 1/2 cup and BBQ sauce 1/2 cup (I will probably only use BBQ sause or only brown sugar next time -the sauce was too sweet for me.

A local catering company makes delicious and different appetizer meatballs. I have tried several times to recreate them, this recipe come the closest to them. I use crushed ritz.  Variations/additions to the sauce: cider vinegar, dry mustard, garlic powder, honey, and a ton of hot sauce! I like to bake them until they are deeply browned and then let them simmer in the sauce in a dutch oven or on low in the crockpot for hours so they are tender as can be.

These were really, really good!  Very tender and flavorful meatballs.  I think next time I will put them on broil towards the end of cooking because I like the way the sauce gets crispy on top like on the top of a meatloaf.  I didn't make any changes to the meatballs themselves but I did to the sauce.  My husband isn't a fan of lots of ketchup so I cut the amount of ketchup and used equal parts of ketchup, bbq sauce and Heinz 57 sauce which was great.  I served it with the "Brown Rice" recipe on this site and corn and peas.  A great meal.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were very tender and tasty. A little to sweet for me, I'll just cut down a little on the brown sugar next time.  My husband loved them.  Served with mashed potatoes and corn. I never baked meatballs, I always made in a frying pan. I will no longer fry in pan, this is so much easier and more tender and juicy!

Really yummy! Easy to make. I didn't have pork sausage at home so I used more ground beef, italian spices and garlic to make up for it. The sauce turned out wonderful. I took the meatballs to a potluck supper and they were a big hit. Deffinently a keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

Great meatball recipe, I did substitute club crackers, and jazzed up the meat mixture with italian seasoning, garlic, and season salt. I think I will try some A-1 or worcestire next time for a little more added uumph, I baked them in the oven at 375 for about 30 min. turning halfway thru.(I used a cooling rack on a cookie pan liked with foil so the fat would drain) The texture was great and they taste awesome in my hubby's spaghetti sauce. YUMMY! (Next time I will try the sauce recipe....if they last that long ;) Thanks for a keeper!

Absolutley yummy! Could hardly stand the wait to try them while baking in oven. Just the right touch of sweet and spicy sauce. I used breadcrumbs instead of crackers as it was handy. Delicious!!

Great recipe, I sauted onions and garlic in a little bit of olive oil before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.  Big hit!
