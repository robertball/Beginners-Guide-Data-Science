I dared to exchange the rum flavoring for the real thing, medium priced golden rum.  It was delish! I scaled it down to 8 servings too, cause I wanted to share with family and friends, and not have too much left over, in case I got midnight cravings. heehee

Oh My Goodness this is so good. I didn't have any rum flavoring or butter flavoring so I used 1/2 c real butter and 1/2 cup margarine and 2+ tsp real rum for sauce. This sauce is really good over vanilla ice cream too. I used Fuji Apples and pecans. YUMMO. It did take another 10 minutes to cook and I used a Pyrex dish so I was surprised it took longer.

Oh my goodness!  I substituted walnuts for the pecans and didn't use the butter flavoring... but oh, my... what a wonderful thing!  At first I was a bit nervous because the batter was quite stiff - more like a dough than a batter.  My company LOVED this.  My daughter insisted that folks try it without the sauce (or whip cream!) stating it was just as yummy without.  She was right!

Thanks for a great recipe!

I had to cook it 70 minutes, not 40.  It turned out very moist and tasty.

I followed the directions exactly and the results were a delicious and very moist cake.  We ate the first slices of cake warm and then put it in the refrigerator.  It was excellent either way.

This is the most Awesome cake I've ever had.  I substituted real butter for the margarine and dropped the butter flavoring.  I took the cake to work, where it was immediately gobbled up!  I will definitely make this cake again, but for special occasions because of its sugar/fat content.  YUM!

I did this and added a pack (1/2 cup) of dried cranberries just because I like cranberries. Made two of them for a Work Group Christmas Dinner and their wasn't a bite left over. Everyone loved it. It might look like a meat loaf in the picture but it tastes awesome. So moist and flavorful. The prep time and sauce is a little extra work but well worth it.

I turned this cake into breakfast muffins to pair with coffee. I am normally a decent cook but I have never mastered coffee cake, yet with this recipe I dared to make it even harder by turning them into muffins. THIS RECIPE IS NOW A STAPLE IN MY RECIPE BOX! The cooking time for 28 muffins was 20 minutes. I thought they were a hair overdone when I pulled them, but I am glad I cooked them that long. When I added the glaze the muffins were perfectly moist. I did make some slight changes to makes these apple nut muffins with rum sauce. 

1) I tossed the apples and nuts into the flour mixture BEFORE adding the wet batter. It sounds insane, but this allowed the flour to coat the fruit and nuts which meant the fruit and nuts did not sink into a pile at the bottom of the muffins.
2) I adapted the extracts to what I had on hand:  2 teaspoons vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon MAPLE butter flavoring, 1 TEASPOON OF RUM EXTRACT, and 2 tablespoons water. I wanted the cakes to be rummy. In the end the rum flavor disappeared, which may be why the author did not add any rum into the cake batter.  
3) The batter was really dry and I had a ton of glaze so I added a bit of the glaze to the batter. I did this a couple tablespoons at a time until it resembled the consistency of cake batter. Conjure up the idea of a boxed cake mix for reference.
4) I was worried about the glaze being too moist for muffins so I reduced it. I forgot just how much a glaze can thicken when cooled and it became a soft caramel. I pu

I haven't made the cake yet, all I needed at this point was a good rum sauce. Think this recipe does the job. I used buttery becel margarine, real rum and used brown sugar instead of white for a Carmel rum taste. Delicious!

I'm sure if the cooking time wasn't so off, that this cake would be tasty. However, after baking mine for 50 minutes (10 min longer than the recipe calls for), it was time for bed. I woke up to a deflated cake and tried desperately to bake it for 30 more min.  The result was a cracker crust with a gooey middle...awful in other words.  The frosting wasn't that good either. A lot of butter, apples, sugar and pecans wasted...not a cheap mistake.

Made it following the recipe and after the 40 minutes it was not done.  Added 10 minutes and thought it was doe but after a few minutes of cooling it collaped everywhere but around the edge.  The taste was good but totally under cooked.  I just made it again and cooked it a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes.  It is cooling now and has not collaped so I am hoping it is done.
