I served this as one of my Christmas desserts for those who were gluten and lactose sensitive. It was a hit with not only them but everyone. I made a chocolate chip cookie base from scratch using gluten free flour. I pressed the cookie batter into spring form pan and baked until cookie base was set. I also made a half dozen cookies which I crumbled and spread on top. I used the cookie dough lactose free frozen dessert and lactose free coconut frozen dessert following like the recipe.
