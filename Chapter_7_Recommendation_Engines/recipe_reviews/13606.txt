I've made this several times and we all love it. I make a few changes though. Instead of 1 cup mayonnaise, I add 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also bump up the cheese to 12 oz., instead of only 8 oz. I also add a butter cracker topping using crushed ritz or other butter crackers, about 20 of them, and 2 Tbsp of melted butter. We like a crunchy topping.

I have been making this recipe for years but I do it a little differently - and ALWAYS get requests... 2 eggs beaten, 1 cup melted margarine, 1 cup HELLMAN's (not miracle whip) mayonnaise, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 1/2 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese, 2 Tbsp chopped onion, 2 pkgs. frozen chopped broccoli, 1 small bag pepperidge farm stuffing mix. Cook & drain broccoli, mix everything else together (except stuffing mix), pour into greased casserole and top w/stuffing mix. Bake 350 for one hour. It is very important that you use real, full-fat ingredients such as mayonnaise and margarine. Otherwise it doesn't come out right. Also best when cools for at least 30 minutes before serving.

This recipe deserves an update.  I am making this dish once again for Christmas because it is the most requested recipe that I own.  It is the best broccoli recipe I have found so far.  I add a butter and club cracker crumb mixture on the top before I bake it.  It is scrumptous.  I highly recommend that you try this.

I have been making this same recipe for years but I add a small bag of Pepperidge Farm seasoned bread stuffing to the top of the casserole before baking. Delicious! I always get requests for this recipe.

Although I made adjustments, this was an absolutely fabulous meal! We all loved it, really!! I don't know why anyone would give it bad ratings unless they didn't like broccoli or cheese :)

I took some of the other reviewer's advice, and instead of 1 c mayo, I did 1/2 c mayo and 1/2 sour cream. I also added 1/2 c more shredded cheese. The funny part was I discovered I only had a 16 oz pkg of broccoli florets (calls for 30 oz cut); so I used that along with another package of frozen veggie mix - of broccoli, pearl onions, and peppers; not realizing that this package added an awesome kick to the meal! I really lucked out. Anyway, like another person, I mixed the concoction together w/the cheese, then at the end mixed it with the veggies. I sprinkled a little shredded cheddar on top, then added mozarella slices - which again, out of sheer luck worked out perfectly!! 

My family really loved this meal. It's a KEEPER! Thanks for contributing!

This is a recipe that is a family staple for all of our holidays. I misplaced my recipe and was thankful to find it here. However, the preparation for our recipe is different, and it does make a difference in the finished dish. Some of the ingredients are a tad different as well.
First, we blanch and drain the broccoli. I think leaving out this step is why some of your dishes are coming out runny, it also makes the color appearance much better. Also, we use slightly less mayo, about 3/4 cup, more cheese (12 oz or 3 cups) and no salt or pepper. There is enough salt already in the soup. Also, we mix the broccoli into the soup mixture. Bake 45 minutes, and then top with finely smashed cheese crackers and return to oven for another 15 minutes or until cheese cracker crust is brown. It is awesome!

This is the best broccoli cheese casserole I have ever tasted. My husbands family is big on broccoli cheese casserole, but this beat their usual great tasting casserole. It was a hit at Christmas. I used the suggestion of 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 c. sour cream and extra cheese. I also omitted the added salt and pepper and it was great! The condensed soups and cheese have a salty enough flavor that no extra was needed.Thanks for this recipe, I will pass it on.

EXCELLENT! I really wanted to make this dish, however, I didn't have all of the correct ingredients in the house, so I improvised. I used a bag of mixed stir fry veggies, and parmesan cheese instead of the cheddar. For those reviewers who said this dish was bland, a little seasoning goes a long way. Black pepper, and garlic and onion powder add a nice flavor. I also cut back on the mayo and added a little squeeze of lemon juice. I topped the casserole with more parm and a bit of paprika. Thanks Stacy!

Tasted 5-star as written, but truly "awesome" the 2nd time with the following changes: Used 2 bunches fresh broccoli & 1 head fresh cauiflower, 1/2c. mayo & 1/2c. sour cream, sauteed the onion & 2 cloves minced garlic in 1 TBSP butter & used meduim cheddar (I liked the sharp cheddar but medium seemed to let the other flavors come through more) added no salt. I did add a few TBSP milk because I had more veggies. THEN the following morning I'd forgotten that I needed a dish for a breakfast potluck at work, so I made a mixture of 3/4c. biscuit mix, 1-1/2c. milk & 3 eggs, poured over the top of the leftover casserole & baked it 400 degrees for 35 minutes - rave reviews!!! So the recipe gets 5 stars for it's own goodness, taste & versatility!!!

I have made this recipe so many times but I add cooked chicken and make it a casserole.  Some people are intimidated by the mayo but you must include it!  This can also be frozen and heated in the oven in no time.  This is also great with extra cheese layered thru it.

With a few changes this could be a great recipe!  Next time I will do 1/2 cup mayo, and a 1/2 cup sour cream and add 1/2 cup more cheese.  Definitely a great "starter" recipe to make your own!

STACY! What a WINNER! This is just WONDERFUL! I added 1 teaspoon garlic salt and pepper to the soup/mayo mixture before adding the broccoli. Every1 said this is a HANDS-DOWN keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I always feel guilty rating recipes when I change them.  But I'm doing it anyway.  This was SO good.  Even better reheated in the microwave the next day.  Here are my changes:  instead of 1 cup of mayo, I used 1/2c each of mayo & sour cream.  I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  I steamed it in a pot with some fresh garlic.  I used cheddar &  monterey jack cheese.  I didn't measure the cheese, but I know I used way more than 8oz of cheese.  Maybe double that.  I also crushed about 20 ritz crackers on top before baking.  Very yummy.  I made this earlier in the day & just kept it covered in foil in the fridge until I was ready to pop it in the oven.

I suggest that you add a can of mushrooms also I do not believe that salt and pepper does this recipe justice add a litte more spice.  garlic salt, white pepper ect. Also i mixed up mild and sharp cheese for a little more flavor or just use med.  over all it is an excellent recipe because it is a recipe you can be creative with.

Whenever I need a new idea for something to cook or bake, I go to this site.  I wanted something different for our family potluck and came across this recipe.  After reading many of the reviews, I decided to (1) substitute the one cup mayo with 1/2 cup instead and add 1/2 cup of sour cream, (2) used 2-1/2 pounds of fresh broccoli (blanched), and (3) put crumbled Ritz crackers on the top and sprinkled it all with butter.  Not only did my family rave about it, but they came back for seconds and thirds!  (I had made a double batch.)  This truly is an awesome recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome is right!  I tweaked it the way many others have.  I used cream of chicken soup.  1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c mayo.  I used powdered onions so the kids wouldn't know it was in there.  I used 12 oz of sharp cheddar and twice as much fresh broccoli which i par boiled.  I also topped it with ritz crackers pulverized and mised with melted butter.  I omitted the salt and never missed it.  My daughters (age 11 and 8) both told me to never again buy the frozen broccoli and cheese that this was far better than anything they have ever had.  This  will go into my normal rotations!  Thank you!!

Amazing! The only change I made was using sour cream instead of mayo.

This tasted okay. The problem I have with this recipe is: I DON'T THINK THIS IS A SIDE DISH! I felt it was heavy enough to be the main dish. Had I eaten it on a day that was not a holiday, over some rice, it would have liked it much better. I made it up the night before so the broccoli defrosted some in the fridge, but still after 45 minutes the center seemed a little cold and some of the broccoli was still crunchy. So, I am not sure how long other people baked it for, especially from a frozen state? I thought the frozen broccoli made it a little watery to. If I made again, it definitely would not be on a holiday, and I would defrost the broccoli first to remove some of the water. It might work better then.

Wonderful!  Needed a last minute casserole for family gathering.  Everyone loved it.  Ingredients in recipe generally on-hand so just threw it together in no time.  The easiest thing is to just combine all ingredients in large bowl after mixing up the egg with soup & wet ingredients, then add the cheese, then broccoli. Mix well then turn mixture into prepared 9x13 baking pan. I used the 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, as well as topped the last 20 minutes with the 20 crushed Ritz with 2 Tbsp butter (suggested by another reviewer). Will definitely make again for easy potluck meals or holiday gatherings.

I know why it's called Awesome!! My husband and 2 yr old twins really love it!!! Per other reviews, I changed it to 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream instead of just 1 cup mayo. My husband, who hates mayo, has no idea it's in there!! I also added more cheese!! It is delicious! Thanks so much!!

wanted to try to give it a little more sustenance so before starting my prep work, I put on a pot of 2 cups white rice and let that cook in the rice cooker while I made this recipe. I pu
t 1/2 cup mayo and 3/4 cup sour cream into stand mixer along with egg and chopped onions and can soup. I steamed broccoli to color (4 min) and added to stand mixer along with cheese. Then layered rice at the bottom of the dish with cheese mix and topped off with salt pepper and paprika. Excellent dish! took me 25 min total to make! Easy no fuss dish to make!

Delish! I was looking for something different to have with the bake chicken & this dish was perfect.... I omitted the onions (just forgot to put them in)...I did do have 1/2 cup mayo & 1/2 cup sour cream per other reviewers...I seasoned the brocolli mixture with pepper, onion powder, & dash of celery seed (just for taste)...I also added parmesan cheese to the mixture...placed everything in the pan & sprinkled more parmesan & casserole cheese mix on top of the brocolli mix...I didn't have bread crumbs or crackers to sprinkle on top but the cheese melted & browned perfectly so it was not missed...my family asked me to make this again (there were no left overs)...Oh & I baked mines for about 40 mins...thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good. The taste of the mayonnaise is a little overpowering, so next time I will use less, and add some garlic to it.

This casserole is okay, but didn't awe me.  I prefer a cracker-crumb & butter topping, which this casserole doesn't have (though one can certainly be added very easily).  Also, despite using sharp cheddar cheese, the cheese flavor didn't seem that great.  Finally, the casserole wasn't very creamy.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Won't be making it again.

This has been an essential part of Thanksgiving dinner in my family for years, with one important addition.  Cube 4 or 5 slices of fresh bread without crust.  Put on top of casserole and drizzle with 2 T. butter prior to baking.  The brown toasty topping is perfect.  I make this the day before and cook half way without bread topping.  The day of, I just take it out of the fridge a little early to take the chill off then top with bread cubes and butter and  bake til bubbly and top is nicely browned.  I think making it day before makes it better. It's best to cook the brocolli a bit and drain very well, then I just mix all ingredients except bread cubes and pat into pan. I usually use a little smaller casserole because I like it deeper.  9x13 spreads it a little thin.

This was not exactly what I expected, but was really good! I pictured a more super-creamy, super-soft broccoli type dish, but my broccoli stayed nicely crisp and fresh, but was completely surrounded by decadent creamy super-cheesy goodness. This and mashed potatoes were the only two requests my vegetarian kid made for Christmas dinner this year, and it was a hit. I was a little leery of the full cup of mayo (even reduced fat), so I substituted about 1/3 of that with Greek yogurt... and then added another two handfuls of cheese on top, lest it become TOO healthy. Next time, buttered bread crumb topping, too!

I have made this broccoli casserole since 1976 when it was given to me by a co-worker; however, mine has crushed Cheez-its on top (and only Cheez-its) on top.  I make this recipe every Thanksgiving and Christmas as my family demand it.  I always use the extra sharp Cheddar as it enhances the flavor. Best broccoli casserole ever.

Very good, but I can't give this 5 stars because of the texture of the sauce when it's cooked. It's kind of curd-ly... we'd really prefer a nice smooth cheese sauce. Tastes good though!

This dish is better as a side then a main entre but it was still very good. I felt like it was too much of the same thing. I did add almond slivers on top which was a nice crunchy touch.

Delicious. But next time I would do a little less mayonnaise (like maybe 3/4 cup instead of a full cup) Its a little greasy.

Just made this and it was fantastic!! I followed the common suggestion I kept reading by other reviewers to omit the egg and use 1/2 cup mayo with 1/2 sour cream. I used Amy's Organic semi-condensed cream of mushroom soup and mixed cheddar cheese with muenster and others I had on hand. I used frozen organic broccoli right from the bag and the end product was not remotely soggy or undercooked - the texture was perfect! I also cooked 3 skinless chicken breasts in chicken broth, cut them up and added to the mixture before pouring into the pan to make it a full meal. I didn't have Ritz crackers for a topping so I just sprinkled some Panko bread crumbs on top and baked it that way. I served it over some steamed brown rice and I was very happy at how delicious this came out! My husband hates broccoli but loved this. I will definitely be making this again!

I've made this twice now.  Once for Thanksgiving (it was the ONLY dish to be emptied) and once on a weekday night.  We all really love this recipe.  As others have mentioned, I changed the recipe only slightly by omitting the egg and using 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream.  This will definitely become a staple side dish in our house!

Great recipe. Instead of 3 bags of broccoli I used 1 bag (1lb 12 oz bag). I cut the mayo in half and only used 1/2 cup. For extra flavor I added a 1 tsp of paprika.

Delicious!  People who don't eat brocolli will eat this.  I have added cooked cauliflower and mushrooms to the mix too (clearing out the fridge :-) and it's wonderful.

This was delicious!  The sharp cheddar was what really brought this dish together!  I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I would have liked a crunch, next time will add cracker topping as recommended.  Thanks for this new family favorite!

This was great, but I used cream of cheddar soup steamed small quartered red potatoes in the microwave-then fried them with the onion before adding to mixture. I also added Veggie bacon crumbles. You could add real bacon if desired.Topped mine with Ritz crackers and dotted with butter.

Very yummy but I made some changes. I doubled the recipe but not the mayo or egg. I started by steaming 50oz of broccoli and a 12 oz box of veggie medley (peas, potatoes, beans & carrots). I then added the other ingredients, a tsp Worcestershire sauce and also red pepper for color. I baked for 25 mins then sprinkled grated cheese on top, turned off oven and left sitting in hot oven for 5 mins to melt cheese. It was fantastic!

We made this for Christmas - we did tweak the recipe a little.  Instead of 1 cup may we added a half cup of mayo and a half cup of sour cream.  We added some of the onion crispy things that are typically added to a green bean casserole.  

Cheesy, creamy, and it will appeal to many people.  

Suggestions for the future:  Use fresh broccoli, use an original type of cheese like an asiago perhaps.

I have made this for Thanksgiving Dinner in the past and plan to make it again this year. It is a great alternative to Green Bean Casserole, which not everyone in my family likes. The flavor was wonderful. I do add extra seasoning for more flavor. I leave out the onions because my husband doesn't like anything with onions. I may add in green onions this year since my husband doesn't mind their flavor. Adding mushrooms sounds good, and maybe I'll try the mixed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots sometime. Thanks Stacy!

This was some yummy stuff!  I'm new at this whole cooking thing, and I was looking for a way to doctor up plain old frozen broccoli.  It was my first attempt at a casserole, but I had the ingredients on hand and said what the hay.  Glad I did!  I crumbled round butter crackers over the top as someone suggested, and it was sooooo tasty!

This is worth trying if you really like broccoli.  I cut back on the mayo though.  The heaviness of this recipe is a little too much for my taste.

Delish! Used fresh broccoli. Didn't have cream of mushroom soup, used cream of broccoli soup and added some sliced fresh mushrooms. Used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream. Topped with Panko bread crumbs. Wonderful!

Family and company loved this!! We used fresh broccoli, 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream, and added a butter cracker topping. It turned out great from what everyone told me(I didn't try it). Anyways, we are making it again tonight for some more guests. Thanks for sharing!!

Wonderful side dish, made it for Christmas dinner. I used two bags of frozen (steamer bags) of broccoli florets, 1/2 mayo and half sour cream. I also crushed entire sleeve of Ritz crackers on the top and added a few pats of butter. Everyone gobbled it up.

I don't know what I did differently than most people who gave this 5 stars, but mine came out soggy and slimy.  I was expecting something cheesy and creamy.  I did love the crusty top though, but that was from other reviewer's advice to use cracker crumbs. Will not be using this recipe again, but will try maybe another broccoli cheese casserole recipe.

We always add a layer of crushed Cheez-it crackers on the top just before baking.  (You can add a little melted butter to the Cheez-its before putting them on -- or not.)  This casserole is always on the menu in our house, especially with baked ham.  MMMMM

I made half a batch of this for the four of us. I used half of a half batch of a condensed soup mix that I made from scratch instead of canned soup and half lowfat mayo/half FF sour cream. (I made a cauliflower bake the other night that used a whole cup of mayonnaise and it was just too much.) I also used fresh broccoli. For the cheese, I used Cracker Barrel's 2% sharp white cheddar to cut down on the fat a bit but not on the flavor. We all thought this was pretty tasty but a little heavy on the mayonnaise. I'd like to make this again with maybe even less mayo and maybe some FF plain yogurt. You could tell I didn't use a canned soup but it was a good surprize, coming from an old Campbell's worshiper.

I also used 1/2 mayo - 1/2 sour cream cause we like sour cream, and I added seasoned bread crumbs on top. The cheese was awesome it, it dripped these yummy melty strings from every forkful. My bf wouldn't stop wolfing this down :)

I made this for Thanksgiving and, after making a few modifications based on other reviewers advice, I'd give it five stars. I used one can of cream of chicken/mushroom soup. I used (3) 12 oz. bags of frozen broccoli, cut into small bites. 1/3 cup light mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream. I did not add the egg. I used 2 teaspoons of onion powder in place of the onion. 12 oz of sharp cheddar cheese. I made into two small  casseroles. One I topped with crushed Ritz crackers w/2 T butter. The other I topped with fresh shredded parmesan cheese. Sprinkled each with paprika for color. The one with the parmesan cheese was a HUGE hit by everyone! Not low-cal by any stretch of the imagination! But a huge hit just the same! Thanks for a great base recipe.

What good comfort food should be.  Had it for Thanksgiving and the kids devoured it.  Made a few modifications though.  Used broccoli soup, instead of mushroom.  Used four cups of fresh broccoli. Added 1/2 cup more of sharp cheddar.  Used only 1/2 a cup of mayo and omitted the extra salt. Topped with onion straws and some bacon. The consistency was more like a quiche but delicious nonetheless. Definite crowd pleaser!

My boyfriend who's not a broccoli fan wants me to make this again!  I modified a little though, as I didn't have, and generally don't eat mayo, I replaced with half a cup of fat free sour cream, and half a cup of low fat cream cheese.  Will be making this again.. probably today!

We loved this!!! My husband doesn't really like broccoli, but he ate this cheesy casserole no problem. The only change I made was that I did not add the onion (we don't really eat onions unless they are very tender), but I added 1 tsp. of onion powder. My father does not really like sharp cheddar, so I used a mexican blend cheese, and it was great. Everyone loved the cheesy crust!!!

This was fabulous, but I did tweak it a bit to our liking. I used 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/2 c. mayo. Also added 12 ounces of sharp cheddar cheese, instead of only 8. Also did a crushed Ritz cracker with melter butter on top which is a definite in our family as we love that kind of topping. Made the night before Thanksgiving and it worked out great. I did not add the butter crumb topping until right before I was cooking it.

According to my husband, my aunt, and our friends, this was delicious and simple to make.  I like it because it's a very light dish, not too heavy on your stomach.

Great casserole! You could use this as a base for any casserole. Exchanging the broccoli for green bean or what ever you like. I will be making this again for the holidays.

My husband and daughter thought this casserole was awful!  My 4 year was so happy to be helping prepare the meal, I thought for sure she would eat it, not so.  Too much mayonnaise!!!

It was good and my family loved it.  I did make several substitutions.  Sine I never have canned cream soup on hand because of their higher sodium content, I used a home made white sauce instead, and I used fresh broccoli that I steamed it in the microwave.  I topped with panko and the cheese.  It will be a family favorite.

this was my fave holiday meal as a child!!  loved to re-create it for easter this year.  everyone enjoyed it, as we always did.  while it's far from a gourmet side, it brings me back to my childhood - - and it was very easy to throw together the night before and bake the next day.  thanks for posting - we'll keep this on our regular holiday menu from now on!

Gluten-free version is easy by using cream of mushroom soup by progresso as theirs is gluten free. it is not condensed but still turns out great. Been eating this for years, but now have a child with celiac.

I LOVED this dish!!!! It had amazing flavor and it was sooooo good. However, I did change a few things. Instead of cream of mushroom, I used cream of chicken. I used Miracle Whip instead of basic mayo. I think it really brought out the flavor. Excellent dish. Even if you don't like Miracle Whip, I felt it brought a little something extra. I will make this from now on. Maybe serve it with chicken.

My kids loved it. It's also good for throwing in the little bits of leftovers that always seem to accumulate. I'm talking about the veggies and rice that aren't enough to feed the entire family but are too great a quantity to just toss after the initial meal. Chuck them into this and fire up the oven! Nothing goes to waste.

Awesome! I did 50/50 low-fat mayo and light sour cream and 2% cheese to reduce calories and it was still great. Next time I'll use more onions and perhaps some mushrooms. Also, I let it cool for a full 30 minutes before eating and I think that helped a lot, too.

do NOT use anything BUT real mayo for this recipe.  I used Kraft Miracle Whip and it turned out way too sweet... almost inedibly sweet.  I would also suggest using fresh brocoli instead of frozen - it just doesn't taste the same.

LOVE this recipe!! I made a couple of additions, I added some sour cream, some cottage cheese, 5 or 6 shakes of Tobasco and a whole chopped onion and LOVED it! My family was supper happy with it at Thanksgiving that I brought this dish!! They have already requested it for next year!

My roommate is diabetic, so this is a great low carb meal for us! just 2 small tweaks: 1)I also add fresh baby bella mushrooms and decrease the broccoli to 2 packages of frozen (otherwise it will overflow my pan), 2) I add in some chicken, also. We've just used the Tyson canned all white meat chicken, mixed it in, and the results are AMAZING. it turns the dish from a side dish to a complete meal.   You could also use a roasted chicken from the store, but it takes longer to shred enough, ad we didn't taste a difference between that and the canned. GREAT recipe!!!

Can't go too wrong with cheese and broccoli!  But my boyfriend didn't like the taste added by the cream of mushroom soup.  It was too overpowering for the dish.

Excellent recipe!! Over time, I've made a few alterations, though.  I add a little more cheese than called for and I only use the florets and my secret ingredient... I add a few durkee fried onions into the mix and added some to the cracker topping, instead of regular chopped onion!  Delicious and e'one loves and requests it!!  Thanks!!

Overall wonderful taste! My kids and grandkids loved it. But, I put it in too large a dish, so it was not like a casserole. I will use a smaller dish next time. Easy to do, too.

Perfect casserole to go with any meal. I like to crumble butter crackers on top of my casserole before baking. I found that Ritz crackers worked the best.

I was disappointed in this.  I did as others said and did 1/2 s.c and half mayo..which was mainly for the texture...that didn't bother me.  What did was that it was completely flavorless and it was quite embarrassing serving that to my family.  Of course everyone said they liked it but who's going to tell me it was awful.  Anyway...needs a lot of seasoning and work to make this taste good.

I made this for my husband's Christmas Party at work this year.  It was hit...no leftovers.  I made it exactly how the recipe followed and received lots of compliments.  Different from the normal "broc-rice casserole." Nice change!

I changed it up a bit and used some left over ingredients from the frig.  I only used 1/2 c mayo, green onions, 1/4 c sour cream, 1/2 c guacomole, grated parmessan, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 egg, and 8 oz. sharp cheddar.  Mixed it all together and whalla!

This was very good but I used low fat sour cream instead of mayo.  For the topping - 1/2 stick melted butter and herb flavored Pepperidge Farm stuffing.

This is a wonderful recipe! The only change I made was to use either cream of chicken or cream of celery in place of the mushroom. The sharp cheddar gives this dish a distinct flavor that my family loves. We've been using this recipe for several years. Thank you for the submssion.

Served this last night for a dinner party of 4.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was to use light mayo and lightly sprinkle bread crumbs on top.

My Mom made this all the time growing up and the entire family loves it. We have never had it for a holiday but my sister often requests it for her birthday, we consider it more of a casual get together side dish. Our preparation is a slightly different, we use milk instead of mayonnaise and always cover it with buttered breadcrumbs which add a fantastic crunchy top layer. You can lighten this dish up by using 98% fat free soup and skim milk(or fat free mayo) and low fat cheese - it still tastes great. Also we always use fresh broccoli, about 2 bunches.

This is an awesome recipe. I have altered it also. I use the broccoli & califlower mix,I used egg beaters in place of the eggs, I spray the pan with non stick cooking spray and have used low fat mayo,sour cream and low fat cheese. No one complained!!

This was soo good.  I took the advice of others and added half mayo half sour cream.  I also did not have cheddar cheese, so I used Monteray Jack and it was even better than the cheddar.  Will make again soon!

i made this for the first time last thanksgiving and loved it!! every holiday since the family requests this dish, and always tells me how good it is-i love that it is so simple,(not to mention cheap!) and yummy-very creamy and cheesy- and u can't tell that the broccoli is frozen either- the only thing i changed the last time i made it was that instead of adding all the cheese to the mixture, i saved half of it and added it to the top- then u can broil it for the last few minutes to make it even better- definitely a keeper!!

This is a great recipe, the only things I changed were adding 1/2 cup sour cream in place of the full cup of mayo and topped it with Durkee Fried Onions. I also used blanched fresh broccoli instead of frozen, better color and flavor.

I chose this broccoli casserole recipe because it was quicker to put together than the others, but my family didn't like it at all.  (In fact, they said they preferred plain steamed broccoli.)  I substituted cream of chicken soup for the cream of mushroom, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Now that I've seen the high fat content in this recipe (something I should have checked before), I doubt that I'll make this recipe again.  Overall, it was edible, but not great.

This recipe was really good. I made it for thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I only made a couple small adjustments. I added a little chopped garlic and a little parmesan cheese. I will probably be trying it again with some rice and chopped chicken for a quick family meal.

This recipe was amazing - I added some garlic powder, but that is the only minor modification I made.  This will definitely be a favorite in our household!

We LOVE this recipe in our family. My mom actually made if for us for the first time, and I enjoyed it so much I got a copy of the recipe from her. I made it many many times last year, but then kinda forgot about it. I just found my printed out copy the otherday, and made it again, and it's SO good. 
The only change I made is that I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. (I think it has much more flavour) I used purple onion because I find it has a nice sweet flavour. And, I used really good aged chedder for a nice strong flavour. So good! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Very easy and rish vegetable dish.  I steamed some fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  Also used some dried chopped onion.  Skipped the salt, as the soup and cheese have plenty.  Did add a little Cajun spice and some worchestshire just to jazz things up a little.  Very well received by all.  Would like to put a bread crumb or cracker topping next time and maybe a little more cheese.

Easy to make and good flavor.  I used fresh broccoli so the finished dish was a little too firm for my family.  I'll use the frozen next time or steam the fresh broccoli first.

This is pretty good.  I made it as an entree by adding chopped ham and served over noodles.  I used the low fat soup and low fat mayo.  As an entree there was too much broccoli.  Will cut that back to 1 pkg.  Was too salty with ham and will try chicken next time.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner, and was soooo impressed.  I was a bit intimidated by the amount of mayo, but followed other reviewers advice and left it in.  I also added a little more cheese (velveeta), and used cream of onion soup, and left out the actual onion.  It was the best Brocoli and cheese casserole I've ever had.  My family raved and my husband has asked for it again and it's only 2 days since Christmas!  Thanks Staci!

She REALLY MEANS IT when she says to use a large bowl to mix the sauce with the frozen broccoli.  Like one as big as the kitchen sink would be good! :)  (I made kind of a mess, cuz I didn't have a big enough bowl.)
It was soooooo yummy, I brought it to a seven-year old's birthday party and everyone LOVED it!!

I've made this a couple of times now for large dinners and it's a big hit.  Fast and easy to make, it's a great addition to a dinner that has a variety of dishes.

Fantastic! Of course, I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. And I used an organic cream of mushroom soup, which makes a huge difference in taste. I have to make a double batch of this at Christmas because it goes fast!

Honestly,I did not care for this recipe at all. I love broccoli, but it tasted like the broccoli was way to cooked and I even added onion powder and garlic powder,and sharp cheddar cheese half mayo and half sour cream with mushroom soup and finely chopped onions, the flavors were off. I won't make this again. :(

This was very tasty. I am not usually a fan of broccoli casserole but was asked to make some for a pot luck and tried this recipe. I followed the advice of others and skipped the egg, used 1/2 cup each of mayo and sour cream, used white pepper instead of black, and added some garlic powder. I mixed all the other ingredients in a large bowl first then stirred in the broccoli before putting it all in a pan. I realized too late that I forgot to butter my pan and was worried it would stick but it didn't. I also made it the night before so the broccoli was no longer frozen and it took only about 35-40 min to cook. I'd definitely make this again. Everyone went back for seconds.

I really liked the taste of this dish. But next time I make it, I'm definitely adding potatoes and chicken. It needed something more for sure.

This was very good! I liked the idea that others had of adding crumbled Ritz crackers on the top.  It gave it a good crunch.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so used cream of celery.  I think it worked well.  Great recipe for a party!

I love this dish and fixed it for Thanksgiving.  I was honored when my aunt who cooks 99% of the dinner, asked me for the recipe.  I do season the broccoli itself to avoid the dish from being bland. I use garlic powder, onion powder, and accent.

This was a tasty broccoli casserole. I used frozen baby broccoli florets rather than chopped and subbed out low fat sour cream for mayo. Used 2% cheddar cheese. I forgot the egg, and it was still fine. I did add some crushed reduced-fat CheezIts to the top for some crunch. It was definitely plenty salty even though I did not add any additional salt. I would suggest using reduced sodium soup unless you are a big salt fan. I used a can of regular cream of mushroom because it was purchased by mistake, and I think the flavor would have been better with less salt. Either way, still a good dish, and probably 5 stars with a few tweaks.

In the past I always made a broccoli casserole on Thanksgiving using puff pastry on top.  I didn't have the puff pastry this time so decided on this recipe seeing the good reviews.  Between this and the slow cooker mashed potatoes I made and this my contribution to the meal that my extended family shared, was no great success.  This was not very flavorful. No one had more than a tiny polite portion of it. I won't try this one again.

Pretty good recipe - I baked it for 48 minutes which was perfect. I used fresh broccolini because I had a ton of it and it came out tender but crunchy - al dente! Also, because I don't like the idea of using just mayonnaise I used 1/2 C mayo and 1/2 C ricotta cheese. It came out really tasty! Next time I make it I'll serve it over some turkey or potatoes, and maybe even add some bacon or mushrooms to the recipe itself.

I made this as an added side for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!!!  Instead of 1 cup of mayonnaise I used 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Also, we are cheese lovers, so I used 16 oz. of cheeded cheese.  YUM! YUM!

Not very good.  Wasn't creamy or cheesy.  I guess I'm finicky because I like Black Eyed Peas Broccoli Cheese Casserole.  If that's what you are looking for, keep looking.  this one isn't it.

I doubled the recipe and made this for Thanksgiving.  I took the advice of others and used half mayonnaise and half sour cream and added the cracker crumb topping and also some onion powder and garlic salt.  I also added 1lb of diced ham (1/2 Virginia and 1/2 spicy Capicola) to make it a meal and everyone loved this casserole.  A little heavy for me but hey it was Thanksgiving.

I made this as directed, and it was just ok (though my fiancé seemed to like it rather well).  I found it to be quite bland, and only when reheated the next day with some salt and pepper was it semi-tasty.  Won't make again...

This casserole had good flavor but as with all casseroles of this type, I always have a problem with too much oil from the cheese.  In addition, the 1 c. of mayo adds more oil.  Any suggestions?  I made a few changes.....cream of chicken soup b/c that is what I had.  To the soup, mayo and onion I added pepper and garlic powder and left out the egg.  I blanched fresh broccoli and used that in place of frozen.  Overall, good flavor and the oil "soaks in" if you let the dish rest when it comes out of the oven.  Would the cracker crumbs on top soak up some of the oil?

I love this recipe. What I like best is that it uses ingredients that you have arounf the house. I had to throw something together because a friend of mine was a vegetarian. My mom and grandmother both asked for the recipe when I made it last Christmas. Also, I can make it as a side dish for an everyday meal it is so easy! Then have it for leftovers the next day. I usually add lots of garlic powder, some extra onion, and lemon pepper to give it more flavor.

My mom and grandmother both asked for the recipe when I made it last Christmas. Also, I can make it as a side dish for an everyday meal it is so easy! Then have it for leftovers the next day. I usually add lots of garlic powder, some extra onion, and lemon pepper to give it more flavor.

Had a good flavor - I enjoyed it but my 5 year old who loves broccoli wouldn't touch it.  A bit of a strange texture though - not sure if I'll make again.

This turned out very good. I would recommend using sharp cheddar, and salt & pepper to taste to kick the flavor up a little.  I also added italian seasoned bread crumbs on top. Would definitely make again.

THIS IS SOOOOOO GOOD! I made it 2 years ago and I decided to make it again this year for Thanksgiving because i remember it being so yummy. My family LOVED IT!!! So flavorful and tasty. I'm a huge broccoli fan, so it's a #1 in my book. But, this year I did the 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and added fried onions to the top. I really liked the consistency and flavor with the sour cream, and the onions gave it a nice crunch! Oh, and I also used FRESH broccoli--definitely made a difference.

 Will be making this for Christmas, too! But, i told my dad i will only make this max 3 times a year because of the high fat content! But it is worth it during the holidays :)

Just made it today for Thanksgiving, it came out really well. I followed directions as they were, except I did do the 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 c. sour cream as another reviewer stated. I also eliminated the extra salt as the condensed soup has a lot of sodium already, and the sharp cheddar cheese provides a tangy zip that doesn't require extra seasoning. Great recipe, I'd make again.

I have been making this recipe for a while now, it is one of my most requested recipes. Kids love it! In addition to the chopped onion, I also mix in AND top off with french's fried onions. This year I am going to try it with the cheese flavored ones! We do not like greenbean casserole, so this is a great subsitution.

I am giving this 4 because I didn't really care for it.  It wasn't moist enough for my tatste and could have had a lot more cheese!!!  It didn't have a lot of flavor in my opinion.  However, my husband did eat it and he never eats veggies.  My dd, who loves broccoli, didn't like it, either.  But to credit the recipe, it was easy to prepare and looked beautiful.  It just wasn't something that I enjoyed.  I doubt I would make it again and if I did I would change the recipe a litle to suit my tastes better.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was quite a nice side dish, fairly easy to make and tasty. It was quite a pretty-looking dish as well, that would look nice on a buffet.  The kids all loved it, so this would be great if you had picky kids and wanted to try and get some more green veggies into them.

Served at Thanksgiving and it was a major hit, especially with the teenagers!! I did use half mayo and sour creme because I thought the flavors would blend better and they did. This will be a staple for any large gathering, it was delicious, thank you for sharing.

My kids love this! I do not add the onion but, I add chopped cooked chicken to make this an entire meal not just a side dish. As a added treat I sprinkle crushed potato chips on top and the kids think it is a snack. Love IT! Super easy to make.

I am going to try this again but will leave the egg out, add some garlic, and use 1/2 sharp cheddar and 1/2 Velveeta.  I think by leaving the egg out with the addition of some Velveeta will give this the creamy consistency we are looking for.

Delicious! I used half mayo and half sour cream, eliminated the egg (mayo has enough), added more seasonings and topped with buttered bread crumbs. Kids and hubby loved this casserole. Thank you Stacy!

This recipe is so delicious.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream instead of all mayo. I have a 5 year-old that hates broccoli.  I'm trying to incorporate more veggies in his diet.  He LOVED this dish!!  He now sings a "yummy broccoli casserole" song.

It was good. Instead of using cream of mushroom, I used cream of potato. It seemed to work just as well.

I made a few changes, per other reviews and it came out good. Only use 3/4 can cream of mushroom soup, 3/4 cup of mayo, and 1 (10 oz) bag of broccoli. Add 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1 cup uncooked rice, paprika, and breadcrumbs to top. Mix in cooked rice with the broccoli mixture.

Jordn: "It's really good"
Q: IS IT good enough tohave onece a week?
A: Yes!
I think the cream soup is too much and Thomas didn't like it either.  Try a boullion cube or liquid soup instead.  Otherwise good enough.

This was DISGUSTING!!  I made it just as the recipe said.  It had sooo much goo on it I wasn't sure what kind of vegetable it was.  This is a sure fire way to load a perfectly good vegetable with lots of fat and calories.  Take it from me, if you like your veggies straight up skip this recipe.  You won't regret it.

Mine did not thicken but I think I did something wrong.  When I make it again - I will add the salt and the pepper to the mixture instead of on top.  It was slightly bland but would most likely please a crowd.  I added almonds to provide more crunch and subsituted Cheeze-its for the Ritz crackers which worked out well.

I made this a few times long ago and hadn't added it to my Recipe Box, only made it using a printed paper, which I lost.  The family has been wanting this for a while now, so finally I made the time to look through all of the Brocolli Caseroles on here to find it.  I'm glad I did!  I just don't understand why so many people gave this recipe 1, 2 & 3 stars!  This tastes awesome.  I do make two changes: 1. like a lot of the other reviewers, I mix 1/2 cup mayo & 1/2 cup sour cream in place of the full cup of mayo but that is only because my husband HATES mayo so I have to do that to all of our mayo recipes; & 2. I add about 1 cup of cheese more.  Thanks for such an awesome recipe Stacey!  Everyone in my family from a one year old to - well lets just say someone in their 30's - loves this!

Made this for Thanksgiving and was told by my 3 Aunts that that was "my dish" and I was to bring it every holiday.  This casserole is delicious and got RAVES!  Thank you Stacy

This was so good. Had to change a few thing for lack of ingedients on hand...Used cream of chicken instead of mushroom and onion powder instead of onions...Also I added about 2 cups of cooked rice...Was sooo yummy. This one is a keeper. Also, I used the full amount of mayo and it was great, not over powering at all...dont be afraid...use it! I almost forgot..I only used 16oz of frozen broccoli, any more and it would have been way too much... Thanks for the great recipe

This is an awesome recipe. I have been making it for years. I read all the reviews and can't beleive no one suggested trying it with some cubed ham. Also try a mixture of broccoli and cauliflower.

I really liked this, used 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/2 c. mayo per other reviewers suggestion, left out chopped onion and topped with french fried onions 10 minutes before baking time was over. Very yummy!

Yum! I used 12 oz. fresh broccoli florets that I steamed until they were a bit soft but not all the way cooked and then followed the recipe except I halved it because I had less broccoli. I thought it turned out great and hubby loved it!!

I have been looking all over for a broccoli cheese casserole recipe similar to one I found in a church cookbook years ago and this was it.  This casserole is so delicious, it's easy to love veggies.  Everyone who has had it loves it.  YUM.  Good holiday dish.

I made this recipe for a recent potluck and it was the only dish that people kept asking, "Who made the broccoli?" Even a co-worker who said she doesn't like broccoli, said she liked it! I made 2 modifications: I omitted the onions, used Cream of Mushroom soup with roasted garlic, and most likely threw in a little extra of the extra sharp cheddar cheese! Yum!

I'm wondering why everyone raves about this recipe!  It was definitely NOT "awesome" in my book.  I used less mayonnaise than called for, and even then it tasted WAY too mayonnaisey for me.  Hacking up the frozen broccoli was a chore, too.  If I make it again, I will use fresh cooked broccoli, more cheese and less mayo, and other veggies.  (The added mushrooms sounded like a good idea!)  When I offered this to the neighbors, the parents liked it but their 4 kids said NO WAY!

I used cream of cheddar soup, due to a mushroom allergy. After reading some of the reviews...I used fresh broccoli florets instead of frozen.  I also used a cheddar jack cheese blend.  I will make this again.

This dish is fantastic. Goes perfectly with ham or anything for that matter. The only  thing I did differently was to mix all the ingredients in the greased dish and then to bake it

I made this recipe for the first time the other night. It turned out wonderful! The only thing I did different was I used fresh broccoli and slightly steamed it before hand. I personally do not care for mayonnaise,  the thought of a whole cup in the recipe scared me. I used a mixture of mayo/sour cream.  And, I added a little bit of cheese to the broccoli/soup mixture. I was delicious and I will definitely make it again. Thanks!!

Made this as a spur of the moment choice for dinner one night and it was a hit.  However, we didn't have enough sharp cheese so we added Pepper Jack.  It gave it a nice kick.  I have made it many time since with a combo of sharp and pepper jack cheese as well as fresh broccoli.  The fresh broccoli gives the whole dish a different texture and cooks better as well.

I cut back a little  on the mayo because of personal taste but I dont think that it changed the recipe all that much. I dont give 5 stars unless I am delighted, but dont let the 4 stars  steer you away because it is very good.

This goes in the rotation for our broccoli dish.  I made it with the recipe ingredients as listed but mixed it up a little different.  I started with the large bowl and whisked everything except the broccoli and cheese together, then added the broccoli and mixed, then added the cheese and mixed.  I like that this casserole keeps the broccoli a relatively low carb dish.

I really liked this recipe.  I did change a couple of things based on the reviews.  I put half mayo and half sourcream in place of mayo.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  It was yummy and I would definately make it again.  You could use cauliflower as well or mix the two.  I cooked it an hour.

Good but better with some modifications. 
We used fresh broccoli, used a can of Cream of Chicken and a can of Cream of Mushroom.  We swapped cheez whiz for the mayo and added shredded green chili's, sharp cheddar and some garlic herb feta mixed in the last 20 minutes. 

For seasoning, try some garlic powder (no salt) and a touch of Old Bay and pepper for seasoning. 

The recipe was a little runny so for the last 20 minutes we blended in seasoned stuffing cubes. For the last 5 minutes we added french fried onions on top.  It was a hit!

Superb! I took the tip from the video of splitting the mayo and lightly steaming fresh broccoli. I didn't have any sour cream, so I added cream cheese and it was wonderful. I also added potato chips on the top. I prefer cornflakes for the crunchiness but only had potato chips around. Adding to my recipe box!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, although I confess, I altered it slightly. When shopping, I misread the amount of broccoli called for and bought less than needed. To compensate for the lack of filling, I added cooked rice to the mix. Also, I liked the idea of a crunchy top, so I sprinkled crushed canned onion rings and croutons on the top before baking. It turned out great. One of my daughters thought it was the best broccoli casserole she had ever had. Thanks, Stacy!

This was great for Thanksgiving dinner because it can be assembled ahead of time and stays hot while folks are busy eating other stuff.  I'm not a fan of frozen broccoli, so I used 30 oz (close to 2 lbs) of fresh instead.  Because I've had bad taste experiences baking with that much mayo, I took advice from other reviewers and used half sour cream.  The additional egg did make the sauce a little curdled-looking as another reviewer mentioned, but nobody seemed to mind.

Yes, this is awesome. A family fav for the last ten years. My daughter was making it, but when she died the recipe was handed down (up) to me.  Made it again today for T'giving.  Yummo. The first veggie side dish gone since my niece started doing her updated green casserole that nobody likes. Only  changes:cut the cheese in half, as we like the broccoli to shine through, not the cheese and b/c I ran short of time, used crushed seasoned croutons instead of crax and butter.  Actually liked it more b/o the hint of seasoning. Try it, you'll like it!

This was definitely a good casserole. I used other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2c mayo and 1/2c sour cream, all mayo would have been too much, I also used extra cheese, and topped it with crumbled ritz mixed with melted butter. Next time (and there will be a nex time) I will use fresh broccoli, frozen made the texture too mushy for my liking. But the flavour was definitely there.

I really, really liked this.  I, too, did 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  My only issue with this dish is that I don't think the cook time is long enough or my oven temp is low - I cooked it for at least an hour at 350 like the recipe states and the broccoli didn't heat through til done and was a little too al dente for me.  I am in a new townhome, so my oven temp may be off.  Otherwise, easy and extremely tasty!  Thanks for posting!

Sooo yummy! My casserole came out of the oven about 20 minute ago and I just had a taste. The only edit I made was using half mayo / half sour cream. I used Campbell's heart healthy cream of mushroom, light mayo, and light sour cream to trim some calories.

This was fantastic!  It took the suggestions of others to use broccoli cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom, and added French's fried onions into the casserole. I also cut the mayo down to 1/2 cup.  Made a double batch for a party and had zero leftovers--everyone loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the bomb!!!
Even my picky seven year old, who doesn't like broccoli, loved this.  Made it for a dinner party, and it was the star of the table.  I did crumble some ritz crackers on top as some had suggested.  This is a keeper, for sure.  Thanks.

This was disgusting. Only thing I could taste was mayo.  I would never even consider making this again.

SO GOOD!!!  Even my picky eater who hates broccoli ate this up. I doubled this recipe for Christmas dinner for the extended family.  Made it as listed with one exception - I was low on Mayo, so I halved it and did half sour cream.

Add diced onions and garlic to taste.  Been making this for years.
Also, if you have Mrs. Dash-herb spice mix--add a good dose of this as well.

I think it has a good flavor, but I'd like to try it with more texture - like maybe a nice butter/breadcrumb topping. I used onion flake for a more pronounced onion flavor (I'm a fan) but then I really think it could have used some garlic powder too. Maybe next time I will work that in with the breadcrumb topping, and follow up with lots of breath mints for dessert! Thanks! Great recipe!

Loved it..big hit with the family. I added 1/2 c of sour cream and 1/2 c mayo as suggested and it was great. I also didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of celery..topped it with french fried onions and there were no leftovers.

Meh. This was allright. I didn't dislike this, but I am not jumping out of my seat to make it again. I like my Grandma's recipe much better. Hers is quite different tho.... For one, my grandma's recipe produces squares (which obviously have a different consistency than this does). Her recipe calls for flour, baking powder and more eggs (again, for a solid, slice-like consistency). On the other hand, this was INSANELY easy to prepare. I decided on a whim that I needed another dish to serve with Easter dinner. Not wanting anything too elaborate / time intensive, this fit the bill perfectly! I used light mayo and sharp cheddar cheese with excellent results. All in all, this is a good dish (there's nothing "wrong" with it), but it's not one of my "favorites." If you can get your kiddos to eat their greens as Stacy claims, this is definitely worth trying if for nothing other than that. Thanks for sharing anyways, Stacy! :-)

This was a really good recipe.  I took the advice from some of the other reviews & it came out fabulous.  I added 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 mayo, shredded parmesan cheese, minced garlic, onion powder and then added bread crumbs to the top with cheese sprinkled over it.  My husband was a little bit skeptical but once he tried it, he fell in love with it.

I followed the other suggestions that people put for this recipe.  I used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of celery.  I only had mild cheddar cheese on hand and it worked fine.  I used crushed ritz crackers which was great! The recipe calls for too much salt and pepper. I put 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper and it still came out a bit too salty.  The fresh broccoli worked great and I only used the florets of the broccoli.

It was *okay*. We certainly ate it, but from the reviews, I thought it would be a new favorite side dish for T'giving. My problem with it was that it wasn't creamy cheesy, and that is what I was hoping for. There is very little cheese flavor, IMO. I'll keep looking for a different recipe.

I thought this tasted good but I just couldn't get past the texture.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream but mixed with the egg, it seemed to curdle. My kids felt the same way. This won't be making our dinner rotation.  Thanks anyway.

I changed this a bit-- I reserved half of the "sauce", but mixed the other half with the broccoli, then placed fresh chicken breasts over the broccoli mix in a pan, covered them with the rest of the sauce, and topped with cheese. It made a wonderful main dish!

i've made something like this in the past only a little different!  but it's just as good, if not a little bit better...sorry bout that!  what i do is cook up a bunch of rice and in the mayo-soup mix, add some curry powder to it.  i think mix some of it in with the rice and then put down my chicken and broccoli and then spread the rest of the mayo-soup mix on top of that and then put some crushed potato chips or crackers on top of that and then a bunch of cheese....i love it that way!  but this is also really good!  thanks for a great recipe.  i'm always looking for new ones!!!

I have a recipe for Broccoli Casserole that I've used for years but takes much longer to prepare and not half as delicious!!  Of course, when any recipe calls for cheese, I at least double it.  Everyone I've ever served this to absolutely loves it!  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is super tasty and really easy to make.  I substituted silken tofu for the mayonnaise (you can use regular/medium too depending on the texture you prefer).  Serve with wild rice and you've got a hearty meal!

This dish is amazing! I've made it for a couple of family dinners, and everyone wanted the recipe!  My grocery store only had frozen broccoli/cauliflower, so I used that and it was great! So easy, too, which is a bonus.

I love this recipe.  I have used it for the past couple of years at Thanksgiving and am going to make it for Christmas dinner this year.  I think the sharp cheddar gives it a great taste.

Just tried this at Thanksgiving.  Got RAVE reviews!  Although I DID change just a couple of things.  I don't like frozen veggies, so I used fresh broccoli, but the store was almost out, so I used half fresh broccoli and the other half was fresh califlower.  Also, I am pregnant and trying to get protien anywhere I can, since I'm not a big meat fan, so I used 2 eggs instead of 1.  And I love onions so instead of 1/4 cup, I used a whole medium onion.  And I also used 12 oz. of cheese instead of the 8 called for in the recipe.  It was very good and very easy.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this for some friends & they loved it.  It was simple to make too.  I was skeptical using egg & mayo but it made all the difference.

Great recipe!!

I made this today. It is good, but not what I was hoping for. If you want a real creamy casserole, I suggest adding something extra like sour cream or even an extra can of soup. The mayonaise gives this a nice zing. I added a cup of rice to mine.

Great recipe; however I made a few changes.  I added rice, a little extra cheese and topped it off with the fried onions.  Everyone loved the dish.  It's one that I will definitely make again.

I am always looking for different ways to prepare vegatables, so I was excited to make this recipe.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  I thought it was much too greasy and wasn't that impressed with the flavor.  Personally, I think regular broccoli and cheese is better and easier to prepare.  But, my mother-in-law loved it and said it deserves it's 5 star rating, so I'll meet her halfway and give this a 3.

Great easy recipe.  I made this for a work holiday party and everyone wanted the recipe.  I made a lowfat version with lowfat cheese, soup, mayo and cooking spray and it still came out great.  I cut the mayo in half and added a half can more of soup to cut the mayo taste.  I also added fresh baby portobello mushrooms and spicy ceasoning.

I discovered this recipe back in 1999 and we have made it every Thanksgiving since. All four of my kids beg me to make it, in fact, it is so good that we often have it throughout the entire year. It does make a lot! But everybody that tries it loves it,and it disapears quickly around here.
Many thanks to Stacy and her mom!

A yummy American classic!  Cheesy and creamy with the goodness of broccoli.  It may not be fancy or exotic cuisine, but I think it almost anyone would find it tasty.  A good choice for potlucks or holiday meals where you're trying to appeal to variety of people and tastes.  As others recommended I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 mayo, instead of all mayo.  Also used light sour cream, light mayo and light cream of mushroom, which worked just fine.  I used more cheddar, about 12 oz, which I thought helped.  Next time I'll probably use *extra* sharp (I used just sharp this time) to give it more flavor.  The tang of the cheddar seems to diminish when baked.  I also used fresh broccoli, which tasted great, but was a lot of work to cut up.  I'll probably use the frozen next time, as the recipe suggests, to save work.

The thing that sold me on this recipe was the fact that you made it with the broccoli still frozen.  I baked it for one hour, and it was absolutely delicious.  I used a touch more cheese than the recipe called for.  Rave reviews from all that had some.

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I made this for Thanksgiving and there was nothing left of it.  We have four children, and now it will be part of our family tradition.  Thanks, and your mother is a wonderful cook.  It was the best Broccoli Casserole my family has ever eaten.  If I could give it more than five stars I would.

Excellent recipe!  No matter how many times I make this, every one compliments me on it.  I first made this for a Thanksgiving side-dish last year and everyone loved.  The only change I made was use low-fat mayo and it still comes out wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will continue to make this and pass it along again and again!!!

Very good dish.  Served it at Easter dinner and everyone really enjoyed it.  Simple to make and very tasty.  This is a keeper. 
Made this for a pot luck dinner at church and there wasn't a bit left.

I made this for an office potluck.  I was a little worried because I didn't really like the smell and I had never made it before to know if it would be a hit at the potluck.  There are some vegatarians in my office and they totally raved about this dish!  Everyone loved it and I was just so pleased with the way people responded. :)  I am now going to make it like the author was saying... for my families Thanksgivings Potluck.  :)

I make this casserole for my family but I add some pepperidge farm stuffing to it... kids will eat it better if not such a strong broccoli taste. They think they are eating stuffing instead of broccoli.

It was delicious!  My mom requested a broccoli casserole for her birthday dinner.  The family loved it.  I used almost 1 cup of mayonnaise but not quite.  I think it would have been just as great with a whole cup.  Definitely not too mayonnaisey if that's what you're worried about.   My store didn't have 10 oz. bags of broccoli so I used 3 12 oz bags and I don't think it was too much.  Per some of the suggestions I crumbled a few butter crackers over the top along with the cheddar.   I also added some garlic and onion powder since I add that to almost any dish that doesn't call for any seasoning...but that's just my preference.  Yum!

Very easy recipe to make and you can't stop eating it.  I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom soup.  Will definitely be making this again! My husband loves it!

I don't think my review to the website "took" the first time, so I apologize if it's going to post twice, but I'll add more detail. Excellent recipe, I made a few tweaks. I like my veggies with a bit of crunch, so I used both fresh broccoli and cauliflower. I used 1/2 cream of cauliflower and 1/2 cream of mushroom soups. I also used 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 c. of sour cream. I topped with Panko bread crumbs lightly tossed in butter, and sprinkled a little extra cheese on top along with Paprika. Amazing!!

Like others, I used 12/ mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  I also used about 12 ounces of extra sharp cheddar.  I topped with a bread crumb mixture to add some texture.  Also, I blanched fresh broccoli for this dish.  Everyone enjoyed it, even the kids around the table!

Made this for Christmas dinner using fresh broccoli and it was delicious. Only change was that I topped it with buttered crushed Ritz crackers. Gonna try it with monterey jack cheese next time.

I make this. I skip the cream mushroom. Add 3diced red potato’s. Mix 1/2 cup sour cream and mayonnaise and whisk with milk and cheddar.  The potato’s give it a little extra. Top with ritz crackers.

Changes: fresh broccoli, 12oz of shredded sharp and extra sharp cheddar, subbed 3/4 of the mayo for sour cream, mixed in 3/4 of the cheddar and topped with the remainder. Baked with no lid for the exact time. I should've given it another 10 min., but seeing as I only have a serving-spoonful left I'll take the win.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was plenty good- no leftovers. I did use frozen broccoli but I steamed it for 5 minutes beforehand, then drained as I worried not doing so would result in a watery casserole. I'm glad I did as it came out out perfectly and the broccoli came out tender, but NOT mushy. I baked for 45 minutes. I also added some more seasoning than recipe called for, just personal preference. Very good, will make again!

I think this recipe is outstanding.  I tried the "as is" version and found it pretty good.  There are a few things I've tried in variation, however.  I substituted heavy cream + 1/ tbs of brown rice flour for the can of mushroom soup--this is helpful for those interested in lowering their carbs further than this could otherwise.

I've also tried substituting other vegetables (brussel sprouts, green beens--the first needing a slightly longer cook time, and the second on the lower end of the spectrum).

Overall, excellent and adaptable.

I was doubtful that the lack of a cheese sauce and use of mayo and mixing cheese in unmelted, but with all the positive reviews I decided to give it a try. Followed recipe as posted an was disappointed, had okay flavour (a bit overly salty), but texture was a fail, was hoping for a gooey cheesy texture, but instead it was kind of grainy and lumpy. No one hated it, but no one loved it. 

Lots left over, so added milk and cream, pepper and blended into a broccoli and cheese soup that all enjoyed the next day instead.

I loved it! Yuuuummmyyyyy!  I used 1/2 cup mayo & 1/2 cup sour cream and added extra sharp cheddar cheese on top, (along with some shredded 4 cheese and shredded mozzarella that I had in the fridge on the top only). I also added crushed Ritz crackers and drizzled melted butter on the top.  I omitted the salt and pepper and I'm glad I did because it came out pretty salty already. I will be making this again.

This is a great dish. Somewhere I read about adding crushed potato chips on top. 
Until I made it the 2nd time and looked at the recipe again, I realized then that this dish didn't call for the potato chips that I added the 1st time I made it. Everyone liked it so much with the crushed potato chips on top I'll keep using them .
Other than that mix up, everything was exactly as described and I wouldn't change 
any of it.

I changed the recipe a little like some previous reviewers.  I did the half cup of sour cream and half cup of mayonnaise.  I also used fresh broccoli that I steamed before mixing with the other ingredients.  I steamed it too long which made it too soft.  I put a handful of shredded Gruyere cheese in with the cheddar.   I omitted the egg, it wasn't necessary.  I think I put a dash of cayenne in it too.  At first I wasn't crazy about the consistency of this dish.  It was better the next day warmed up.  I am making my second batch of the week right now.  It tastes a lot like chicken divan for some reason?  Kind of lemony without any lemon it it.  Must be the mayo?  This is a recipe you can really switch up to your liking.

Just made this for Easter and it was the best thing on the table IMHO! Changes - I used 1/2 c Mayo and 1/2 C Sour Cream. I added another 1/2 cup of cheese and a dash of cayenne as well as the paprika.  15 minutes before taking out I added some buttered bread crumbs on top (melt 2 tbs butter in the micro, add in about a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, wisk with fork until coated then sprinkle on top of casserole. Bake as usual and then you can put it on broil for a few minutes to get a crisp top). BIGGEST thing with this... par broil the broccoli for 30 seconds and drain it first!! That's the key to making sure it's not watery like some have mentioned (and it makes the broccoli nice and green). Let sit for 15 minutes before serving. Yum!

I made my cream of mushroom soup homemade which was very simple and added as much as would be in a can.  It turned out amazing.  I know someone previously said it was too salty.  Making the soup from scratch helped with this issue as I could add salt to taste.

I was looking for another broccoli and cheese casserole to replace mine. Only because I was tight on money and mine is expensive to make. Anyway this recipe was great. Of course I made a few changes, I didn’t have cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken. I added a bit more cheese to it and seasoned it. It was rather quick and easy especially since I cooked my broccoli first.

Good. I have a mushroom hater sis in law so I had to use cream of broccoli soup instead of cream of mushroom.  I’m not sure if that was the reason I didn’t find it as awesome as other reviewers. I’ll make it again just for my hubby and me with the mushroom soup and see if it makes a difference. If it does I will change my rating.

One of my favorite dishes for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of 1 cup of mayonnaise. Turned out great. I'm considering making it all year long with everyday meals.

I went with other reviewers and took out half the mayo and added sour cream. I also used all florets. For a bit more flavor I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic condensed soup. For even more flavor, bake a few pieces of bacon, crush up and add to the top prior to the crumb topping. Delicious!

Love this recipe!  We’ve made it multiple times for groups & it’s always a hit.  The only substitutions I make are:  use Greek yogurt instead of mayo (2% plain Fage), & no egg.  We prefer 1/2-3/4tsp each of black pepper & garlic powder.  Yum!

I've been making this for years and the only thing I did differently is that I add some crushed ritz on top with the cheese AND when I want to make it a meal, I add diced browned chicken to it.  It's a sunday funday comfort meal we all love.

This was sooooooo good!!! Everyone loved it and has been gobbling up the leftovers at every opportunity. I browned the onions before adding and added mushrooms that I needed to use up. I don’t think I would consider making this without at least sautéing the onions first.  Also, I used fresh broccoli as that is what I had on hand, but as suggested by another reviewer, I blanched it first. This has a lot of calories, so it will only be an occasional indulgence.

If I make any changes to this recipe, I’ll be eating it by myself! My finicky daughter asks for broccoli casserole each Thanksgiving and I’m happy to oblige. It’s a great make ahead dish that can be put together the night before too.

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  I did make one tiny change.  I used half a cup of mayo and half a cup of sour cream.  I wanted more creaminess and they turned out absolutely delicious!  Will definitely make this broccoli dish again!

Made this casserole x2, for a church dinner. It was very well received and completely gone within 20 minutes. I baked them in 9x13 disposable aluminum tins. I think we got about 12-16 servings, from each.

I did 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo and topped it with 20 crushed Club crackers and sprinkled with butter before baking. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. Or, so I thought. I forgot the eggs!!! It still came out really good and I am wondering what the eggs would have added, had I remembered to put them in? 

I will definitely make this again for the family, maybe without the onions, as we do not care for onions. And, perhaps I will remember the eggs this time!

I made it. I used feta cheese instead of cheddar, used zero mayo, added sour cream. Plus, I added cut up heirloom cherry tomatoes. I used red onion, instead of onion. I used what I had from the garden and fridge for modifications. I topped with cheddar jack for the final baking. This was a great recipe to start with. Thank you!

Oh yeah! This sounded perfect for our Christmas dinner, and it was. Only change I made was to use lightly steamed fresh broccoli, and since quite a few reviewers mentioned it wasn't real creamy I added about 1C of cream.  Close to the holidays and the store was out of cream of mushroom so I used cream of broccoli. I used Dubliner cheese--an Irish cheese that tastes like a cross of sharp cheddar and parmesan. Lots of flavor. Also did 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  Will be making this again soon with chicken for a main course. I can understand the reviewers with complaints IF they used frozen broccoli (mushy) or crummy cheese (flavorless). Use fresh broccoli and a great tasting cheese and you will love this!

I made this recipe for 18 people, so increased everything accordingly. Everyone loved it. I added a Panko crumb crust  which didn't really influence the taste, but really improved the texture.

I made this for Christmas Day dinner. I wanted something different than our usual green bean casserole. It was a huge hit. The kids loved it. I will definitely be making again. The only changes I made were, I did use one half cup of mayo and one half sour cream as others suggested. I also added a butter cracker topping the last 15 minutes of baking. Yum!

This is awesome! I made only 2 changes, otherwise I followed the directions as written. I left out the onions, there were no onion eaters in our gathering except for me. The 2nd change was: I took 45 Ritz crackers and crushed them in a bowl and added 1 stick of melted butter; mixed this together and spread on top. Everyone thought this was awesome and even asked to take some home. Will definitely make again.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year, first time ever.  Five stars! Everyone’s favorite - we are getting rid of green bean casserole in future years and replacing it with Broccoli Cheese Casserole.

So, took review suggestions and also made following changes:
used fresh broccoli, not frozen, added breadcrumb and cheese topping for crunch, did not add the egg, swapped all the mayo for sour cream, used cream of broccoli soup with a cup of milk instead of cream of mushroom. I know we did make quite a few changes, but REALLY appreciate having this recipe to alter. It’s always easier to edit existing, than start from scratch!

Also, everyone was out walking to work up an appetite, so I ended up leaving it in the oven for an additional half an hour.  Not a problem, was beautifully golden on top!

I have made this sooooo many times! It's delicious and everybody loves it! Not the healthiest dish but whatever, we don't have it all the time. The only thing I add is garlic powder to the mix (because I put it in everything) and crushed ritz crackers on top (because YUM). Great made with a combo of broccoli and cauliflower or just straight cauliflower too. This recipe is definitely worth a try.

This was great!  I did half mayo/half sour cream, added another 4 oz. of cheese and blanched the broccoli as another reviewer suggested.  Took it to a picnic and there wasn't anything left.

I'll make it again. Even the picky eater loved it. Next time I'll use sour cream cheese, like others mentioned. The original recipe is excellent. I just want to see how the variation is.

This was incredible!! Other than cutting all the stalks off and adding some cooked rice, I made a few of other changes:
I steamed the veggies in the microwave beforehand so that they didn't come out crunchy in the casserole. Instead of using 1 cup of mayo, I used only a 1/2 cup and then used 1/2 cup of sour cream. I used more sharp shredded cheddar cheese than what was called for and mixed it into casserole. I also sprinkled some of the cheese on top of the casserole. Lastly, I added crushed Cheez-It crackers during the last 20 minutes of baking as a topping.

I hate broccoli with a passion and choke it down for the vitamins, but this, THIS is fabulous. I put fried onions on the top for crispiness and used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. Also, I put in too much salt, so be wary of that. The mayo has salt already.

This is a wonderful delicious recipe. I don't like mushrooms so I used broccoli cheddar. I also used fresh broccoli because it was about to go bad. I buy fresh then end up not using it so I'm trying to get better at that. This fit in perfect with my husbands low carb diet.

Excellent! My whole family loved it. I doubled the cheese and added a little more on top at the end. Be sure not to use too many stems bc they are harder than the florets. Whole family loved this.

LOVE this recipe! Made it over and over because it's just that good! Sometimes I make it with a mix of broccoli and cauliflower and that's great too. The only changes are I add garlic powder to the soup mixture and sprinkle buttered cracker crumbs over top of the casserole before it goes in the oven. Delicious!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and all 7 of us raved about it.  It's so simple, but so good.  I used half of the suggested mayonnaise, and used plain greek yogurt for the other half.  It was delicious!  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Thanks, Allrecipes!  This is certainly a keeper!

No changes made at all...followed recipe exactly and it was perfect! So good! First time to ever make this dish and I'll definitely be making it again and again! I did add Pepperidge Farm seasoned bread crumbs to top during last 10 or 15 mins of cooking, but that's all.

Everyone loved it! I took advice from other reviewers and used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo. I omitted the cream of mushroom soup and instead used a can of cheese soup along with 8oz of sharp/mild cheddar blend. I also used 1/2 stick of melted butter and a sleeve of crushed ritz crackers for a topping. The family is already asking for more :)

This was the big hit for our Thanksgiving. Devoured in no time and everyone raved about it. The only change I made was to use a shredded cheese mixture of Cheddar & Monterey Jack because that was the only pre-shredded cheese our local store had but it definitely worked. This will be permanently on our Thanksgiving menu going forward.

Turned out great. I used 2 8oz bags of mild cheddar cheese instead of sharp and put a layer of ritz crackers to the top of it. I lightly broke the crackers by hand. Casserole turned out great and was devoured at thanksgiving dinner.

I doubled this recipe and par-boiled fresh broccoli.   Tasted great. Would love to add some garlic next time.  Will make again.  And yes if you like a little crunch add some crackers to the top.

This was so easy to make and it is very good!!! Next time I am going to try a few minor adjustments based on what I've seen in other reviews (like adding more cheese, an extra egg, etc). Even though it is probably meant as a "side dish", I enjoyed it so much by itself! ??

Make this all the time! However I do mine differently. I don't put any eggs and I use cream of broccoli instead of mushroom soup and add a lil splash of milk and bake it... my son and husband LOVE this dish! DELICIOUS! ????

This is a really good broccolli casserole! I used half mayo and half sour cream because that's what I had. Recipe did not call for thawing and draining broccolli so it was a bit runny. I will definitely make it again, but will make that change.

I've been making this recipe for years....almost identical.  I mix half the cheese in the casserole and top it with the rest (maybe add a little more)....then I put crushed Ritz Crackers on top of the cheese and pat the crackers down into the cheese.  Makes for a nice, tasty,  crunchy topping......

I made two modification.

This is one of my favorite go-tos when I need a low carb side dish. It's good as is or as a starting point for getting creative. I like using Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup for a little extra flavor. And, being a cheese-a-holic, I load on about an extra 1/4 cup to the top (the rest is mixed in as indicated). You can also make this a one pot, main dish meal by adding cubed chicken to the mix and serving with some salad and/or crusty bread.

I was searching for a new side dish a few years ago and saw this one. I've been making this recipe  for family holiday meals ever since. It's a great side dish any time.  This is so delicious. I do add sliced fresh mushrooms and I use fresh  broccoli instead of frozen. This one is a keeper for me.
I passed it on to my sister. She loves it .  It is a big request to make for her family get together' s . She sometimes  adds cooked cut  up chicken tenderloins,  and adds a  side salad for her & hubby.   It's good any way  you make it.

Love this recipe. The casserole came out perfect! The consistency was right and it tastes great. The only thing I added was Italian and herb bread crumbs. Two thumbs up from me.

Okay so I was thinking  mayo, yuck. But I tried it and I love it. I can't have a lot of salt in my diet so I didn't add any bc of the can of  organic mushroom soup. I'm having it with a baked potato. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!

My sister-in-law makes a version of this for every family dinner.  Everyone raves about it.  I was not able to get the recipe from her in time for a holiday dinner I was giving so I took a chance and made this.  Outstanding!  My husband said it was just as good if not better than his sister's version.  I blanched about 2  1/ 2  to 3  cut up  broccoli crowns instead of using frozenl  Worked great

I was not able to get the recipe from her in time for a holiday dinner I was giving so I took a chance and made this.  Outstanding!  My husband said it was just as good if not better than his sister's version.  I blanched about 2  1/ 2  to 3  cut up  broccoli crowns instead of using frozenl  Worked great

I LOVE this recipe. I make it often (holidays or not) and it frequently gets requested at events!! We don't really like onions so I leave them out and don't think it needs any more salt than is in the soup so I leave it out as well. I only use broccoli florets. I flourish it up with crushed Ritz crackers drizzled with a couple TBSP of melted butter!

My mom used to make this too!  We used to love eating for breakfast the next morning!  I now make it for my family.  They still beg for it.  We only use 1/2 cup mayo and only the broccoli crowns.  Enjoy! Play with it if you like.  We like Cream of celery better and more cheese...sharp cheddar! Thanks for posting this great recipe!

Good, old fashioned casserole that everyone loves.  I added crumbled butter crackers on top and think it would super with rice too.

I made this today for Christmas Dinner.  Was not pleased, with the outcome, first of all use only the florets or it will not neccessarily be done The Cuts are too coarse or tough.. Second of all did not like the oniony taste.  I would leave those out next time.  Was not the best casserole I ever made.

Have made this twice for potlucks and both times had people asking for more.  I made the recipe just as written with the exception of a topping.   After removing from the oven prior to serving I sprinkled crushed Ritz crackers over the top, the 2nd time five minutes prior to end of cooking time I put thinly sliced tomatoes on the top with a small amount of grated cheese put back in the oven for remaining 5 minutes.    Then added the crushed Ritz crackers to the top prior to serving.   Both were good.

I used 2 large eggs instead of one; added about 3/4 cup of sour cream to the soup + mayo mixture, as well as about 6 ounces of canned, drained mushrooms (cream of mushroom soup is never mushroom-y enough for me).  For topping:  I keep an airtight container of 'casserole topping' which is 1 box of Ritz plus 1 box of Cheez Nip plus one envelope of Onion Soup mix that has been pulsed in my food processor before storing.  I used about 1/2 cup of this topping.  Fantastic as revised.

This recipe is one of my family's favorites.  I add a can of mushroom stems/pieces as well as a cup of matchstick carrots -- which I microwave for 4 minutes before adding in with the broccoli.  In addition to the sharp cheddar cheese, I also add 1/2 cup of shredded (not grated) parmesan cheese.  For the topping, I use a cup of panko breadcrumbs mixed with 3 tablespoons of melted butter.  I sprinkle this on top before baking.

I love this recipe as is but I prefer using real butter, 2 eggs, bread crumbs on top, and 1/2 c sour cream 1/2c mayo. I recommend making this as is. Then you will know what changes you like to make.

My family ands kids (1 and 5 years old love this recipe). I dont put as much mayonnaise in it to take away that taste. I put cheese in the mixture as well. Thanks for this recipe.

My family loved this dish!!!Additions I made:used condensed can cream of celery soup. Added 1/2 cup shredded parmesan and mozerella cheese in the mixture. Added a 1/4 cup of Land O Lakes butter to the mixture. I sprinkled shredded mozerella on top of casserole 15min before removing from oven. Huge hit and definitely will make this again!

This was great!!
I switched a few things around after reading the other reviews and it came out way better than I had expected, ALL my kids ate it which is great as there is usually one who won't eat at EVERY meal.

I used 2 bunches fresh broccoli and 1 head of fresh cauliflower which I boiled for a little bit first. 1/2 cup each of mayo and sour cream.
No egg as I have an egg allergy and no topping although I may try that next time. 
I only used a little pepper and salt to season and didn't measure any cheese, just grated it and mixed it in.
I'll definitely be making this again - so quick and easy to prepare !!

I thought this was okay but not great. I had made this because of all the positive reviews and some reviews about their kids liking it. I have a 7 year old who is a picky eater but had wanted brocolli and cheese which she loves but would not touch it made this way.

I really liked this. I made it for a Thanksgiving dinner at church and got many compliments on it. My two young daughters liked it as well. It makes a BIG casserole. The ingredients were not that expensive and it was easy to make. Next time I might put a we bit more paprika on it than I did this time. It gives it a great flavor and also makes it look nice and pretty.

Amazing! I had to use cream of chicken soup as that is all I had. My kid loves broccoli and asks for it pretty much every night. This is a GREAT way to change it up! I wouldn't change a thing!

I tried this with frozen broccoli that I cooked in microwave as directed, put in strainer for cooling about ten minutes. I mixed everything together and poured into baking dish topped with Pepperidge farm herb stuffing and butter. I've added chicken or Jimmy Dean sausage cooked and crumble. I like the sour cream instead of mayo. Will try with cooked rice and use Ritz crackers for topping. I rated the original recipe.

Very good.  I made the mistake of doubling this recipe since there were 10 of us.  We will be eating broccoli cheese casserole for a week straight.  It made a huge amount.  It was good enough that I will eat it as a meal though!

The only adjustment I made to this recipe was to add 1/2 cup of sour cream, as suggested by another review. The casserole came out great, looked and tasted good! I will make this again.

This is great.  I use half frozen and half fresh broccoli.  I put the in a blender for a few quick pulses to break up the broccoli florets.  I was pretty liberal with the cheese.  My family loved this at Thanksgiving and asked for it for Christmas dinner.  I'm sure it's a lot of calories so I'll probably only make it for special occasions.  So nice to have another options from green bean casserole!

Made this for a family gathering, so good there was nothing left. Easy to make, made earlier in the day and put in the oven before company came. YUM

We make this every Thanksgiving! Much better than a green bean casserole. I add crumbled up multigrain club crackers. I love it so much.

This is a very versatile recipe.  I did half broccoli and half cauliflower.  I also use light mayo and reduced fat soup.  Turned out great!

Super tasty!  I used 1 big 32 oz bag of frozen broccoli, that i cooked according to package, forgot the onions and only had a can of cheddar cheese soup and it turned out good!   I added the paprika to my mayo/soup/egg mix along with a a healthy sprinkling of garlic salt and loads of onion powder.  I got my 6 year old to eat it, do that alone makes this a success!!

This is so good! My husband doesn't like broccoli, but he actually likes this, he even asked me to make it again! The only thing I changed is I didn't use so much mayo, I probably only used half a cup and I top it with half of the cheese, it turned out a lot better. I will be making this for holidays from now on.

This is sooo delicious! To make it more healthy I use 3/4 can of fat free cream of mushroom soup, 1/4 cup of light miracle whip, 1/4 cup sour cream, and add 1 cup of diced portabella mushrooms. I also top with crushed ritz crackers for a crunchy topping. A great potluck dish. Thanks Stacy!

Yum, this was really good.  Nothing gourmet but exactly what I expected for a weekday side dish for my easy-to-please family.  My 7 year did most of the work himself.  We just threw everything in one bowl and mixed it around--adding fresh broccoli instead of frozen--and then dumped everything in the pan.  I'll hold on to this recipe and use it again some day.

Family favorite! I use 1/2 C mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream, I sautee the onions ahead of time, double the cheese and add a butter/crushed cracker topping.

Reading the reviews I changed the 1 cup of mayo for 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream, adding more cheese also. This bake had a lot of flavor, changing up serving just regular vegeables.   Very good!!!

I served this with prime rib for Christmas eve dinner. It was very good...wouldn't quite use the word 'awesome'. I used fresh broccoli that I had steamed. I will probably keep making this a couple times per month in the future.

Excellent, I did this for Christmas dinner and doubled the recipe because there were 20 guests. I modified like others on the mayonaise doing half sour cream. Everyone loved it, no leftovers.  My brother that never says anything said it was outstanding. I will do this again.

I included this in my Thanksgiving day menu of things i've NEVER made before. I hosted with my husband for the first time and this was a huge hit! I actually DOUBLED the ingredients and used the advice of others which included half may half sour cream, and crumbled cracker topping with melted butter on top. EVERYONE loved it and its almost gone just one day later.

It was fun to try, but I wouldn't make it again. Watch out for the salt, perhaps not adding any because the mushroom soup is salty enough.

Pretty good.  I served it with easter.  IT went over pretty well considering how many people turned their noses up at the idea of broccoli at the table.  Next time i think i'll use velveeta.  I was hoping for a smoother "cheese sauce" and ours stayed lumpy.

My husband hated this and he loves Broccoli-cheese casserole.  All he said is Mayo and what else is in it.

This IS an awesome casserole, even if my waistline does not thank you for it!  Too rich to make often, but well worth the extra trips to the gym.

People liked it, but I thought it was too heavy for broccoli, which is normally so healthy.

I made this last night after getting home from work pretty late (I work 2nd shift).  This recipe was so easy to prepare and was totally yummy!  I didn't even bother mixing it in a large bowl like the recipe states.  I just mixed all the ingredients into my casserole dish and popped it into the oven for an hour.  I will definitely be making this one again.  I might experipment by switching out the broccoli for another veggie, like string beans or cauliflower!  AWESOMELY GOOD!

I served this at a dinner party and no one liked it.  Although the flavor was ok, the consistency was too runny.  I also crumbled Ritz crackers and a little butter on the top, which burned within a few minutes and had to be scrapped into the trash.  I think next time I'll choose a recipe with rice to give it a thicker consistency.

This is a 'staple' casserole for us.  We like Colby cheese instead of cheddar and smash up most of a tube of Ritz crackers for a topping/crust.

This recipe just wasn't cheesy enough for me. I found that the cheese didn't really mix well into the soup mixture. It left me wishing that I would have just melted some velveeta and added it to the broccoli.

Outstandingly good! I made this for my family-two kids and a husband and gave some to my mom and everybody loved it! I put garlic butter crushed Ritz crackers on top which added to the flavor.
Great recipe for all ages!

I made this receipe because my boyfriend likes broccoli and it was so good that it made a broccli fan out of me too.  I was worried about how fattening it was but I've gone over to the low-carb world and it has become one of my staple treats for the week.

I made this receipe because my boyfriend likes broccoli and it was so good that it made a broccli fan out of me too.  I was worried about how fattening it was but I've gone over to the low-carb world and it has become one of my staple treats for the week.

This was very good and very easy. I was lloking for a way to play up a boring bag of broccoli with very few ingredients on hand. It was a hit. I will make this again.

My husband and kids LOVED this.   Even my 3 year old asked for seconds.  What is so unique about this recipe is that it is so good without the usual high carb cracker/bread crumb topping that is called for in almost every broccoli casserole I've seen and/or made.  I added a can of drained mushrooms and used Cream of Chicken Mushroom condensed soup instead of Mushroom.  It also needed more salt and pepper which I adjusted according to my family's taste.  Thanks for a keeper recipe !

This recipe was very easy to make and our family really enjoyed it, even my mother-in-law.  I thought the broccoli was a little too soft in texture but other than that it was very good.

Wow...i used this recipe for Thanksgiving and let me just say, it was superb. It mixed in with my mashed potatoes on the plate and it was even better. I think next time I will add hashbrowns to it to give it a more solid substance. It was phenomenal though!

THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD.  AT FIRST BITE, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ALL THAT GREAT, BUT STARTED TO REALLY BECOME TASTY.  I WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN, BUT NOT ALL THE TIME BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE HEALTHIEST WAY TO PREPARE VEGGIES.

THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD.  AT FIRST BITE, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ALL THAT GREAT, BUT STARTED TO REALLY BECOME TASTY.  I WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN, BUT NOT ALL THE TIME BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE HEALTHIEST WAY TO PREPARE VEGGIES.

I left out the mayo and added an extra can of mushroom soup. It turned out great.

This was just too overbearingly rich. My husband, who loves broccoli & cheese recipes, barely touched his food. Sorry, but I just don't recommend making it.

This recipe was good but I think it was missing something. Maybe some cauliflower or rice would have been a nice addition. This recipe is even better heated up in the microwave the next day! (For crunch, I added french fried onions to the top and baked 10 minutes longer)

This was a yummy, cheesy casserole and a great way to get my broccoli intake (and fat intake, too!). I halved the recipe as I was only making it for my husband and I in order to try it out, and added a dash of garlic powder and dill to the soup/mayo mixture. I also added a tad more cheese. When I pulled it out of the oven it was quite liquidy in the middle, which concerned me, but after it sat out it firmed right up and tasted great.

Yummy! I added a bit more cheese and sprinkled cheese on the top ~ next time I will leave the egg out because I like the sauce consistency without it. Definately a keeper!

This recipe is excellent!  I used premium (frozen) broccolli instead of fresh.  The only thing I suggest is to make this as a side dish because it's not very filling.

Thanks for a great recipe! I took the advice of 1/2c mayo & 1/2 c. sour cream and omitted salt and pepper. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and it was perfect! Thanks again.

This was really good, but watch out for the salt.  I may have put too much and it was really salty.  Otherwise we really would have enjoyed it.  May try again.

This was good, but sort of pedestrian.  Also a little dry.  Next time I would add a little bit of milk I think.  I used broccoli florets instead of chopped.  I think you could add just about anything to the same ingredients and get a similar result.  I got a couple of compliments, but not what I was expecting.  Also a topping might be good - herb stuffing or bread crumbs.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I thought this was ok.  It was pretty plain tasting, so yes, kids would probably like it.  It was really hard to mix and I doubled the amount of cheese.  I don't think I'd make it again.

crowd pleaser & SO easy! I used cheesy broccoli soup instead & didn't even have time to sautee onion, just omitted it; may cut down the mayo (to 3/4C.) or use lite next time, it was a bit powerful.

I don't understand all the great reviews. My family didn't really care for it. We much prefer your standard broccoli/rice casserole or just plain broccoli with either cheese sauce or lemon & oil.

I made this for Christmas dinner for 10 guests.  It was the hit of the dinner table and the first thing everyone reached for for seconds.  I doubled the recipe with hopes of leftovers but none were to be had.  This will be a standard dish on my Christmas dinner table hereafter (and many times in-between).

This was very good and easy to fix. Everyone liked it and my daughter-in-law asked for the recipe. I will make it again.
