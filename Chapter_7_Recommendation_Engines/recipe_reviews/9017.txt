Yummy!  I don't understand people who think this recipe was not easy.  Few enough ingredients to make it simple, but enough to make it tasty.  Instead of a toothpick to hold the chicken breasts together, I use pieces of raw spagetti.  It does the job just as well, and disappears during baking so you don't have to find the tootpick before serving.

We really liked these, especially the kids. I don't like pounding and rolling chicken, so I butterflied them and put the fillings inside, secured with toothpick and browned for considerably longer, and adjusted the cook time a little as they were thicker this way, same concept, filling wrapped with chicken just without the work.
Anyway, thanks for sharing, my kids are already asking when I'm making it again.

While I loved this recipe, my husband and I blanched at the sodium and calories for one dish.  We substituted turkey pepperoni for the "real" stuff and low-fat cheese as well as finding a low-sodium spagetti sauce.  We have also made our own using a recipe from Cooking Light.

I actually loved the taste of the chicken browned in pepperoni oil, and thought it was a neat idea. It is good for low-carb diets. The only thing I'd do differently is to saute ALL of the pepperoni, before assembling the chicken rollups - the crispy pepperoni tastes much better to me and my family.

My husband and I really enjoy this chicken recipe, I substitute pizza sauce for the spaghetti sauce and it comes out with a different flavor that we both enjoy. This is quick and easy and so good!

Super easy to make & the whole family LOVES it! I use pizza sauce in place of the spaghetti sauce & have used provolone in place of the mozz slices, but still top w/shredded mozz when it comes out of the oven. Sooooo delish!!

I browned the chicken rolls in olive oil. I left out the part in step 4 with the pepperoni oil to cut out some fat.I also simmered the rolls on top of the stove for 30 minutes.

My whole family (3, 19, 32, 36 yr olds) loved this.  It was a little bit of work, with the whole pounding chicken thing.  I was thinking about buying thin sliced chicken breasts the next time I make this to save time.  But the dish was worth the time!

This was excellent.  It was definitely worth the time.  I used regular ground sausage and added mushrooms to the sauce.  I didn't use the full 28 oz. of spaghetti sauce.  Great recipe!

I thought this dish was alright, but not great.  Chicken needed to be browned longer and baked longer than recipe states. I will not make this recipe again.

I thought this recipe was alright but it didn't really score too many points with my kids and husband.  It took a little more time than I had expected and I just am not too sure I like the chicken/pepperoni combination.

My Husband and son liked this, I thought it was O.K. I used Turkey pepperoni. Note if you use Turkey pepperoni don't brown it to release the oil for browning the breast in- it doesn't work.
I ended up browning the rolls in a little olive oil.

I prepared these the night before so I just had to pop in the oven for dinner. This is the first time I've ever had "stuffed chicken" and had to pound chicken out. I was pleased with the results. I skipped the browning in the oil part and I used shredded mozzarella as that what I had on hand. I also put extra mozzarella on top of the rolls in the last 5 minutes and it was nice and cheesy. After reading the reviews I opted for pizza sauce and I'm glad I did. It turned out great. My hubs who wasn't looking forward to this meal really enjoyed it. My toddler cleaned his plate as well. I served with garlic/parsley noodles and we put the extra sauce on the noodles.

I like to add fresh packed basil leaves. I added some garlic and a little olive oil, 1T butter to pan and tossed some cooked pasta in instead of marinara sauce and topped with 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese.

We have a catering business and I have been looking for new recipes to add to the menu. This is one of the recipes that I chose to try out and see how well it was received. After making this and serving it to about 10 private guests, the reviews from them were nothing but wonderful. They loved the flavor. I served it already sliced and covered each "pinwheel" with shredded mozzarella and a little sauce. This is a very wonderful recipe, great texture and flavor. Thanks for the addition to the menu.

I'm rating this four stars..my husband eighteen month old daughter and I really liked this and it was a lot of work but well worth it...however we think maybe pizza sauce would have done better because of the pepperoni but other than that it was excellent...thank you...we will be making this again and again

I've made these numerous times now and my family LOVES them! I buy thin chicken breasts so i don't have to mallet anymore. A word of the wise is not to season both sides of the breast with Italian seasonings because it overpowers the flavor of the pepperoni. I only season the outside lightly with italian seasoning. We like them cheesy so I use shredded mozzarella, roll them up and use a stick of spaghetti to hold it together. I used to brown them in the pepperoni oil and found that step unnecessary and it made them too greasy so I put them straight in a casserole dish and into the oven. Sprinkle some Mozzarella on top and serve over a bed of spaghetti! Yummy!

I love chicken rolled up and stuffed with just about anything!! The pepperoni gave this a great flavor. I didn't mess with the pepperoni sausage just used pre-sliced ones, since I wasn't going to have the pepperoni oil in the pan, I skipped browning the chicken. Turned out great!!!!! I used sliced provolone inside my chicken and shredded mozz. on top!!!! YUMMY! I will make this again.

If I were to ever make this again I'd definatly cut down the spaghetti sauce.  We all found the flavor too overwhelming of the other flavors.  I'd probably just lay a layer of it down into the baking dish and the put a spoonful on top of the chicken rolls.  I would also remember to put the cheese in the rolls.  I used the presliced pepperoni and found that there was plenty for the dish.  Infact I'd probably up the amount in each chicken roll.

These were way good! I made them tonight for the first time, and had company over. Everyone loved it and I didn't change a thing. Only thing I might do next time is use two pieces of cheese in the rolls, and maybe mix in some shredded cheese in the sauce, as everyone said they wish it had more cheese since it all melted out into the sauce. Otherwise, it was amazing! Will definitely be adding this to my recipe box. Thanks!

I THOUGHT THIS CHICKEN DISH WAS QUITE TASTY. I DID NOT HAVE SPAGHETTI SAUCE SO I USED PIZZA SAUCE INSTEAD. I FORGOT TO ROLL UP THE CHEESE IN THE CHICKEN SO WHEN THE COOKING TIME WAS DOWN TO ABOUT 10 MINUTES I PUT IT ON TOP OF THE CHICKEN.

LOVED THESE! The only thing I think I'll do differently is next time I won't salt the chicken, as I think the salt from the pepperoni will be plenty. Other than that this is a keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was good.  All my cheese leaked out and I cut it thick to try to avoid that.  Good but not a go to meal.  Takes time to get it in the oven.

I left this recipe in my recipe box for a long time, going back and forth between deleting it, or giving it a try. I am really glad that I decided to try it...everyone LOVED it! I sliced the chicken really thin instead of pounding it, and it worked well for me. I didn't brown the chicken in the pepperoni fat, but dipped it in egg, then italian breadcrumbs and baked it with a single piece of pepperoni on top. The chicken came out very moist, and the flavor (although a bit odd to think about) was great. I baked them for 40 minutes at 350, since I didn't do the brown-in-pepperoni-fat step, and they came out juicy and oh-so-good!

I made this for my family tonight and it was a definite Hit! I used provolone cheese on the inside and the small round pepperoni slices that you can get instead of the big ones. It was ready in exactly 45 minutes. Will be a regular dish from now on!

Yummo!  I didn't have any spaghetti sauce, so I substituted a 6 ounce can of tomato paste and 6 ounces water.  Add 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning and a couple crushed cloves garlic to water and tomato paste, combine well.  Also, I didn't brown the chicken rolls, just place in baking pan as other reviewers have suggested.  I served this with the Zucchini Herb Casserole found on this site.  Great meal!

Just a great idea! I did change a little but this still deserves 5 stars. I added garlic and onions to Hunt's tomato sauce as well as a little bit of chourico, finely diced which is a spicy Portuguese sausage. I just used that in place of the pepperoni int he sauce because I love that sausage but the pepperoni would have been just as good. I didn't pan fry the chicken at all- just rolled them, put them in a baking dish, covered with the sauce and baked for about 35 minutes. So good! One of the  best dishes I have made in a while from AR. Thanks for posting!

These were a hit with the family. I didn't fry the chicken in the pepperoni grease but just rolled them and placed them seam-side down in the baking dish so I didn't have to use toothpicks or skewers.

These were easy to make and tasted great. I used those little metal skewers to hold the rolls together - much easier to find and remove than a toothpick. I served this with angel hair pasta and roasted asparagus. Delicious! I will definitely make this one again! Thanks for a keeper!

This recipe was OK. I personaly thought it lacked a little flavor. I'm not a big fan of sauce from a jar, but I was in a hury. Next time I think I will make the sauce from scratch.

Super easy!  I'm no expert chef, and the idea of rolling chicken breasts sounded difficult, but it only took me 20 minutes to prepare 10 rolls.  I used turkey pepperoni, so I browned the rolls in cooking spray before removing the toothpicks and baking in sauce, then serving over spaghetti.  Excellent family dinner- thanks for the recipe, Brenda!

This was good for a change of pace. However, I did find that there was a little too much pepperoni for my liking. Next time I will try it with less pepperoni and sauce. I also had a VERY hard time rolling the chicken even after pounding it flat. If anyone has any suggestions....

I never realized before that I do not care for chicken & spaghetti sauce... It is a bit heavy & the flavors do not blend very well... The recipe gets an "A" for effort, but overall a "C" for confusing - it couldn't decided whether it want to be an Italian dish or a Chicken dish... I do recommend this recipe for those who love chicken paired with spaghetti sauce...

This is extremely easy, quick to prepare, very little cleanup and tasty as can be.  I used garlic/herb feta as that's all I had on hand.  Be sure to use a non-stick pan for browning.  I use organic chicken only.  Delicious.  One could probably sub chicken cutlets.

We Loved this! I did do it alittle different. I didnot roll them. Something came up the last night when i was going to make these so i chopped all of the pepperoni and fried the oil out and removed from pan. then i cut the chicken into 1 inch cubes seasoned as directed and browned in the pepperoni oil. mixed the chicken, sauce and pepperoni in an aluminum tray and topped with cheese baked for 35 mins on 350. So basically I only didnt roll them up. Everyone loved this and my 7 yr old even took the leftovers for lunch today. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be making it again and next time I will roll them up.

This recipe is good, but you can make this dish a different way to achieve the same taste without dirtying as many pots, pans and utensils. That being said, I found this lacked the 'homemade' flavour. Perhaps it is the brand of spaghetti sauce I bought- I bought the kind in the can, not the jar. I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion salt, a tablespoon of canned green chiles and a generous splash of balsamic vinegar to the canned sauce to perk it up a bit. I had to pound my chicken breasts (3) with my hands since I don't have a mallet- A sight to see, lol. I lightly seasoned them with same seasonings. I didn't have much pepperoni to use, so I did my best to evenly distribute it throughout the dish. I used the suggestion of skewering the bundles with raw spaghetti instead of toothpicks- Worked great! I opted to top the casserole with lots of cheddar cheese about 5 minutes before the dish was done. Lots of clean up. You can simplify the dish easily if you're not looking at presentation and want a less processed taste by making your favourite tomato sauce and dicing the chicken along with the pepperoni. We served this atop some spaghettini and "Pepperoni Drop Biscuits" from AR.

Me Too! So, thanx for this one. I used crumbled Italian sausage in the sauce and sprinkled shredded mozzarella on top. Delicioso!

This was tasty. I used turkey pepperoni and a light mozzarella.  Since It didn't render enough fat, I sprayed my pan with cookign spray. Worked great. Next time I think I'll add some veggies to the filling

Yummy! I used turkey pepperoni so I did not fry in the oil. Instead I fried in EVOO and a little white wine. Made my own pizza sauce and baked for 30 minutes. Really good!

This is similar to a recipe in a low carb cookboot, and their recipe was lower in calories. But just as delicious. Easy to make.

Wow!  My husband (who is usually leery of my Chicken Surprise dishes developed to clean out the fridge) LOVED this and said it was one of my best!  I used turkey pepperoni, but I didn't have enough to use it for pan juices, so I just used it for stuffing and used 1/2 lb. of breakfast sausage instead for the browning and sauce part.  I also didn't have mozzarella, so I used monterey jack and you could really taste the cheese flavor.  I also used 2 cans of Chef Boyardee pizza sauce and a little can of tomato paste in lieu of spaghetti sauce, reserving some from covering the chicken so I could toss the mostacciolli in it and served the chicken on top (added chopped onions to sauce...yum!) This was great and full of flavor.  I did not pound the chicken, but butterflied it like another reviewer suggested and it worked out fine.  I added about 5 minutes of baking time because of thickness.  Next time, I will take another reviewers suggestion and try to use spaghetti to close these bundles instead of toothpicks, because my husband had a hard time getting them out...  Yummo, thanks Brenda!

This recipe was very good, especially for the pizza lovers in the family.  It was almost the same as pizza except with a chicken breast for the crust.  Very tasty and will be prepared again!

I make these every once and a while for my family. It never fails to be a hit with everyone. If I can find a good deal on an italian blend, I'll use that in place of the mozzerella.  I usually serve it with buttered speghetti noodles that I've tossed with some italian seasoning, garlic and parmesan cheese.

I made this last night because I was looking for something to use up some stuff in my pantry/fridge, and I was so impressed!!  I think this is going to be a regular addition to our table.  I used shredded mozzerella and pizza sauce as substitutes, because that was what I had on hand.  This is definitely NOT boring ol' chicken!

This came out great.  Very easy to make and very delicious.  Using thin sliced chicken cutlets saved time and everything went together quickly.  Husband & I both loved it.  Will definitely make again.

My boyfriend loves everything pizza flavored so I knew I had to try this and I'm so glad I did!  Only changes I made was to use shredded mozzarella instead of sliced because that's what I had on hand and pizza sauce (Easy Pizza Sauce II from this site) instead of spaghetti sauce.   I scaled down to 2 servings and only used 8 oz sauce which was plenty so I think 28 oz for 4 would be overkill.   I'd like to point out what I think is a flaw in the directions - at the end of Step 4 it says to combine sauce and sliced pepperoni but I'm pretty sure it means the chopped & fried pepperoni so that's what I did and it was so tasty!  I also added crushed red pepper flakes to the seasoning of the chicken and removed the toothpicks after browning.  This will definitely become one of my regulars.  I served it with the extra sauce at the bottom of the pan ladled on top of the chicken, parmesan risotto and a green salad.

I had gargantuan chicken breasts, so had to revise this a bit. I butterflied the chicken; put one line of pepperoni, cheese (block of Monterey Jack on hand), and sundried tomatoes; sprinkled with garlic powder and Italian herbs, and rolled up. [I should have seasoned even more and added another row of pep-cheese-toms.] I love the suggestion to pin with raw spaghetti...worked perfectly. Covered with foil and baked 50 min, removing foil last :10. Came out great, just needed more flavor. Will make this again with the added filling above.

This is on the fattening side but every once in a while when wanting to reward yourself this is it. I served over linguine with a salad on the side.  We loved it and will be making again.  Oh I also brined my chicken breasts so they were so tender that they melted in our mouths.  Thanks

The family (especially kids!) really liked this!  My biggest negative was that the whole rolling process took a lot longer than I would have liked; I hope this will get better with practice!   A few tips: If you have a butcher that is good with making THIN sliced chicken breasts, this worked well, and saved the meat mallet step.  I tried another reviewer's suggestion to use strands of raw spaghetti to hold the rolls in place, rather than toothpicks, as you don't have to worry about carefully removing them after baking; this worked great, and I will definitely be using that tip again!  Also, I followed a tip to use pizza sauce over the rolls in the oven, as the spices work very well with the pepperoni, and this was very tasty.  Lastly, I wondered what the purpose of pan-frying the meat was, when it was about to go in the oven for a half-hour..... One benefit I noticed was that this melts the cheese in a way that completely seals the ends, which is a nice bonus before going into the oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a wonderful receipe. I did everything the same except that I forgot to add the cheese (which I wish I hadn't) and that we cut the chicken breasts in half first so that theywere thinner for cooking. I tried a chicken recipe not long ago and well it ended up raw so this one I wanted to make sure got cooked. Plus this looked really cool, like a cinnamon bun :)

Really good - I did use turkey pepperoni, and butterflied & stuffed the chicken rather than rolling (I'm not good at the pounding). Also cooked it longer. Hubby & I loved it!

Neither my husband nor I really cared for this dish.  The overall taste was overpowering, without variation.  Would have been better with pizza sauce and possibly penne or farfalle added in or something to mix up the taste a little.

Honestly it was just ok. I expected it to be a little better than it was.  The flavor was good, even with the turkey pepperoni that i used.  Its really easy to make.  Would I make it again? Probably, just not very often.

This was very good and my kids really enjoyed it.  I did make a couple of changes - I didn't use any pepperoni sausage and instead sauteed the rolls in olive oil and used turkey pepperoni.  I thought the spaghetti sauce was good but next time I think I will try pizza sauce for a more authentic pizza taste rather than more of a chicken parmesan flavor.

It's like eating pizza, with way more protein and way fewer carbs! Unfortunately it's still far from healthy so I won't be making it very often.  SO YUMMY though!

This was very good. My husband prefers breaded chicken, so I rolled it up and then in Italian breadcrumbs. It tasted good, just a little hard to taste the pepperoni.

This was pretty tasty. My husband loves chicken parm and I love pepperoni, so this was a nice way to meet in the middle! I also butterflied the chicken rather than rolling it as I never have the best luck rolling chicken!
