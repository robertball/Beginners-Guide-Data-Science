These were excellent! I used the bacon salt on half of the batch and loved it. The texture is a little weird and off putting so I think that could use some improvement but other than that I have no complaints. When I make these again I will let the beets marinate in the vinegar overnight because I really liked that flavor that came out of them. Almost meaty if you will...

Great base recipe as stated. I have made them with cider vinegar but really love them with balsamic vinegar. I wait to salt them until they are done dehydrating. Just toss them with a tiny amount of salt.

I followed the recipe & enjoyed the result.  It will be fun to try different flavours.  The Kitchen Aid was great in slicing up the beets & the dehydrator finished them up nicely.  I would definitely make them again!

Do not make the same mistake I did.  If not using flake salt, do not add a tablespoon of sea or table salt.  It is intensely salty and unfortunately is inedible.
