This was delicious! My brother-in-law said he doesn't like the sweet potatoes with marshmallows so I was on the hunt for a recipe without them. I got rave reviews! I didn't use all of the topping but saved the left overs for another round! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I always make my own changes to a recipe like, adding a little more cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I also like a thick topping, but the rest is the same.
