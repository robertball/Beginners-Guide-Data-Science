Tastes really good! i added a bit of pineapple juice to the ketchup. I also think that scarring the ham or letting the ketchup mixture marinate would give it more taste. Besides that it was wonderful.

For those of you who don't like ketchup or would prefer a little bit more tang this recipe works equally well using yellow mustard instead of ketchup.

My husband loves ketchup so I thought I would give this a try.  It was very good.  Funny thing is I have tried for years to make a ham with a sticky glaze like his mother made.  She would never tell me the secret.  So I figured maybe this was it.  Only thing is she would pour a jar of cherry ham glaze on top at the end to trick evryone in thinking this was the only glaze on it.  I tried this and only changed one thing.  I added some pumpkin spice with extra clove spice and allspice to make it a bit spicer and it works great! At the end if any of the glaze is bare pat on more ketchup and sugar mix and turn up heat for 15 minutes.

I was looking for something quick and easy, but tasty for cooking a ham and this sure met all my needs.  My family loved it!!  This is one recipe I will be making again and again.

Made this for the two of us for Christmas Day, on a 4 lb ham. It was quite delicious, and didn't taste like ketchup, but more of a tangy, sweet almost BBQ type sauce. Will make again and try adding whole mustard seeds or pineapple pieces just for variety.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving. It was not so very sweet like a maple glaze or traditional brown sugar glaze. It was just right for a wide range (including International) taste buds.

If I could rate it higher, I would!  Perfectly simple, but I had my doubts. Nothing gained if you don't try, so I did! Very glad I did.
