I cooked the chicken on the BBQ - the marinade made the chicken taste delicious, my family just loved this chicken salad.

The chicken marinade was very very good.  However, once the salad was mixed, the mayonaise and sour cream didn't mix well with the flavor, we thought.

I made this for an office potluck, and everyone kept telling me how much they loved it. I omitted the plum sauce because my local store didn't have any, but no one seemed to notice. I made the dish the night before, and will increase the amount of sauce for the pasta next time, as most of it got absorbed overnight.

This was delicious! Even my toddlers loved the chicken and my husband loved the pasta salad. The honey really added a nice settle touch to the macaroni salad and the avocados...yum! I will definitely make this again!

Loved this recipe but i have to admit that I used ketchup in place of tomato sauce in both the marinade & the dressing.  Otherwise, i made this recipe exactly as written.  Changes for next time:   i'd add some chopped brocolli and i'd roughly 
chop up the cashews.
I'd definitely make this again and again!

My husband liked his warm to where the cheese and all were melted. I chose to eat my cold, but were very good. The avocado added a fresh element, but I think even something like tomatoes could have been added. Overall a good recipe and different from the "norm". I do wish you could do something with the leftover marinade for a sauce or add extra fresh basil at the end. Hated seeing all those flavors gone.
