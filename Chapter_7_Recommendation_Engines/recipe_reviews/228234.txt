These were a hit in our family.  I grate the potatoes into a salad spinner full of cold water - triple rinse to remove the potato starch and spin dry.  The result is beautifully crispy potatoes.

LOVE IT!!!!!!!! One bite, and I was in heaven. Really fun and easy to make. A precaution is that when you put it on the pan, it will be very liquidy and sloppy. there will be leftover 'juice' in your bowl. Thumbs up!

Mmmmm.  These were delicious. I left out the nutmeg but I added a little garlic. I also squeezed out the excess liquid from the potatoes. With the help of my food processor, this recipe was quick, easy and definitely a keeper.

These had a good flavor, but one would be in the kitchen all day following the directions as is! Instead of peeling and shredding 2 lbs of potatoes with a grater, I just used 1 2lb 4oz bag of defrosted Ora-Ida hashbrown potatoes. I used a sweet yellow onion and it was gigantic, so I just used one onion. It would have taken forever, and a lot of tears, to mince the thing so I just chopped it large and then put in my Vitamix blender on medium speed about 10-20 seconds, processing them down with the tamper. It created closer to a puree. It worked fine and at least I know the onions got cooked through. Lastly, I highly suggest using a a large plug-in griddle if making the recipe. Only 4 will fit in a standard sized pan and I found one batch takes 20 minutes. I got 14 patties, using a mashed potato scoop, and all would fit on one of those large rectangular plug in griddles at one time. That would save a full hour of cooking time.

This recipe is awesome! I made them for my family and my daughter who usually turns her nose up at potatoes took seconds. I need to read the reviews as to how to decrease the liquid. They were hard to shape into patties. But, we will be making these often!

This was a great recipe - the addition of the baking powder and flour made them puff up while being fried, which insulated the inside from the heat, making them fluffier and softer inside while still brown and crispy outside!

The only quibble I have with this recipe - you have to squeeze the juice out of the grated potatoes before mixing them with the rest of the ingredients, or it becomes one big soggy wet mess! In addition, I was unable to make them crispy with just half a cup of oil - I ended up going the traditional route and frying them in 1.5" of oil in an electric fryer - after draining and sitting on paper towels for a few minutes, they have the same amount of oil in them as with pan-frying, and the oil can be re-used if it's not overheated.

But still, good recipe and I'd make it again - with those minor changes.

I forgot the flour so maybe my rating is not justified. My observation is that to make these crispy, we need a fair bit of oil, if we skimp on the oil, it will not be crisp.

Very good! Definitely fry in a skillet versus a griddle (I used a griddle and the sides didn't get crispy).

i give this 5 stars because it was excellent at a half recipe  split on ingredients (that i had on hand which is great)  i did add pepper and garlic salt to the potatoes and in the egg mix as i like  potatoes that way  and all i did was   substitute grated cheddar  cheese. they were really good  biggest challenge was to keep them from sticking on the  first side.  probably  the cheddar cheese instead of  the one she uses. i will make these regularly i bet.

I cut this recipe in half, and it turned out great.  I even made a mistake by mixing the oil in the mix instead of putting the oil in the pan.  This is a very good recipe.

I cooked them on a griddle to reduce fat. I think I would make them thinner and cook at a slightly higher temperature for crisper texture next time.

I made this recipe. I added green onions and replaced nutmeg with a heavy dose of chilli powder. I wasn't sure if the mixture was supposed to be so wet (I clothe dried the potatoes, but still wet) so I added a bit extra flower. I also added seasoning salt and the pepper. I read they put garlic in thought that was a good idea so I added 2 cloves. But Im not supposed to eat fried food so I baked them at 425 until brown then flipped them over. After they were basically cooked through I added some shredded sharp cheddar and topped with a dab of sour cream and salsa!! AMAZING!

These were bland and I had to add two extra eggs and they were still falling apart.  I will make it again, but I'm going to double the egg and add lots of seasoning to it.  It also had way too much onion in it, which may be why the pancakes fell apart.
