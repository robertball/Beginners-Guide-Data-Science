I am a military wife who currently lives in Germany.  This recipe is close but doesn't taste as good as the ones made in Germany.  I was lucky that I was able to go to a German butcher and purchase the meat that they cut just for Rouladen.  It is very, thin meat about 6 inches long.  Ideally, your meat should be long enough to roll at least 3 times.   You probably won't be able to buy the thick pork bacon that is used in Germany so use thin sliced bacon.  It will taste better than regular thick sliced bacon.  Also, to assist with the flavor put in 1 envelope of Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix.    You can then thicken the gravy after the rolls are done to serve over them. Overall, this a very close copy of what we eat in Germany.

We are from the Saar area of Germany so the recipe is the same.
The difference is the manner of cooking we bake them in a roasting pan with a bit of water to get those dark drippings on the bottom ( the almost burnt part).

Remove the rolls set roasting pan on stove add your water and get a really high heat to boil.
In a seperate container using a blender take cold water and some flour & blend it as you boil and lift the dark drippings add the flour mix.

You get a nice dark gravy from this.

I grew up this this recipe. My mother gave it to me back when I got married 20+ years ago and it is loved by my wife and kids. My wife likes the pickles in, but my sons and I don't. I usually have to make 8-10 large ones to feed the family.
Make sure the mustard has horse radish in it. Yum!

To make it a little easier, I use "sandwich steaks". They're cut thin to begin with and I additionally pound (tenderize) them further sandwiched between plastic wrap or wax paper. The process is the basically the same from there.

I brown them and place them in a pot with 2-3 cans of beef broth. I also add a bay leaf or two. Two smahed cloves of garlic. (Taken out later) Also a tablespoon of the mustard and a couple of peppercorns are added to the broth. I usually will also add a little worchestershire sauce. I use a medium colored roue (spelling?) to thicken the gravy after I take the rolls out of the pot.Don't forget to remove the bay leaf, garlic, and peppercorns. Let them cook for a good long time until they barely hold together. 

We serve them with plain boiled russets and top it with the gravy.

I have made rouladen for years, based on my mom's recipe (who is German - came to US when she was 22).  Couple of hints - vary the mustard type, bacon and pickles for different taste sensations.  And for those who are leery of the pickles, dice them up - still get the great flavor but you don't realize it's in there!  And always make gravy with the liquid - it's the best.  I dice up all the "stuffers" - onions, bacon and pickles - and if I have any leftovers after filling the rolls, I throw them in the liquid - makes the gravy even better!

Thank you for this recipe, it turned out delicious. I made a few changes...try it with some horseradish as well as the stoneground mustard. I also browned them on the stove top and then finished them off in the crockpot. Add just a tiny bit of beef bouillion water & a splash of red wine to the slowcooker (also fresh ground pepper & a couple bay leaves) and let them cook on high heat for 3-4 hours. This made let so tender you could cut them with a fork. Quickly whisk the juice from the slowcooker with a little cornstarch/water paste to make a flavourful gravy. Guten Appetit!

While I am Italian and grew up with predominantly Italian cooking, this is my family's favorite dish, probably because when I make it it's considered a special occasion! It is to-die-for good. Like Dr. Bones, I use either sandwich steaks, or very thinly sliced round steak. I have made it both with and without the pickle and mustard, and while I know that to use them is traditional, our family prefers them with just the bacon and onion. I simmer them a good hour and a half in beef broth once they're browned, adding more broth or water as it reduces. Once they're good and tender I thicken the gravy with flour and more broth. I prefer to serve these little "roll mops" with hot, buttered noodles, but my family insists on mashed potatoes. Thanks for posting the recipe!

This recipe is very close to one I'm familiar with, as I cook for a German Family summer camp every year.  This year, we made Rouladen twice in one week, each time making over 250 for our lunch menu!  However,I would add this:  we use regular mustard, garlic salt, NO horseradish, and dice the bacon, onion and pickles up VERY small. We do not use any boullion, but add carrots and celery to the water over the rolls while cooking.  After sauteing and placing them into a shallow baking pan,we cover the pan w/saran wrap and then aluminum foil, put in a 300 degree oven for several hours until tender. We strain the carrots, celery and broth into a tall stockpot, literally "smashing" the vegetables through the strainer and  discarding the fiber, then thickening w/corn starch. We serve the traditional Spaetzle, or tiny dumplings alongside. By all means, ask your butcher to cut top round 1/5" thick for you. In rolling the rouladen, think "burrito".  It will keep all the good stuff inside! Good eating!

Unless I missed reading something this recipe is missing a very important component, the gravy. While the meat is simmering, add a bay leaf to the broth. At the end of cooking time discard the bay leaf. Prepare gravy by using brown gravy mix or flour. I grew up in Germany. My Dad made the best rouladen! Good gravy is absolutely essential to this recipe!

Rouladen recipes can be different depending on the area of Germany you're from. The part of Germany my parents grew up uses cube steak in lieu of flank and no pickles. We also use beef broth instead of water and add chopped fresh garlic with the onion. Remember to thicken your gravy if necessary. It's always nice trying different variations to recipes. It was good.

My grandmother from Germany makes a really great version of this, and here's how:  Lay the beef on a cutting board and sprinkle with salt and fresh ground pepper, then spread dijon mustard across the top side.  Spread finely chopped onions across the top.  Spread three quarter strips of bacon across the top, and put thin slices of dill pickle spears between the bacon strips.  Roll the meat tightly and tie with two kitchen strings.  Once you have prepared all of the rolls, take the remaining chopped onion and put in a large skillet with butter.  THIS IS THE KEY: ADD A FEW HEAPING TABLESPOONS OF PAPRIKA TO THE ONION AND BUTTER MIX, AND ROLL THE ROLLS AROUND THE MIX UNTIL BROWNED ON ALL SIDES.  (This is what makes a great flavor)  Then add about 6 cups of water with 6 beef boullion cubes to the pot, And cook until meat is cooked all the way through.  Once the meat is done cooking place the rolls in the oven to keep warm and prepare gravy.  Use the liquid and drippings from the pan, (you should use a gravy separator to get the fat and grease out of the gravy.  Then slowly stir in water and corn starch (this won't give you that "floury" taste like flour does) while bringing to a boil, keep adding until the gravy is as thick as you like.  Serve with Mashed potatoes, brocolli and cucumber salad!  My FAVORITE MEAL OF ALL TIME!

Instead of cutting flank steak, I pounded it out and rolled the whole thing up like a jelly roll, tieing with string.  I simmered it in a can of beef broth and then sliced each piece.  I served over buttered egg noodles and poured thickened broth over all.  Nice presentation.

I love rouladen.  I don't make it very often because it is a lot of work and my husband doesn't care for the pickles.  The recipe my mom gave me called for chopped carrots, celery, parsnips and leeks to be cooked with the meat, but you strain the sauce before thickening, so they don't stay in.  From the looks of this recipe I may just leave them out next time to see how it effects the taste.

My Oma came from Germany with my dad in 1946. I have eaten this dish for more than 45 years.  I work from scratch to make Rouladen.  I use round steak that is cut very thin about 1/4" and is 3" by 6".  I do use a good German mustard, bacon and onions that are sliced very thin (makes it easier to roll) and I buy good dill pickles and quarter them.  I will use fresh ground pepper AND ground ALLSPICE to sprinkle on before rolling. Oma said that no German kitchen is complete without allspice.  I roll, secure with roladen needles, (turkey lacing needles for holding in the stuffing work just as well) sear in a pan till nice and brown with some oil, and transfer to a dutch oven.  Add your water and bouillon to taste along with 1-2 bay leaves, and a tea ball filled with some whole allspice and peppercorn.  You will notice a very different distinctive flavor when done.  Ome always made these with sweet and sour red cabbage and knortch. It is a regional dish from the area of Thuringen.  Boil potatoes, drain and reserve some of the water.  Mash good, add potato starch and a bit of the water,  mash till they are sticky and end up like a glob on the wnd of the potoato masher.  They are a bland dish, but with the gravy from the rouladen it is a wonderful meal.  Now if you will excuse me I need to go make some because I am now very hungry.

Ok, this is marvelous.  Want to make it even easier?  If you have a hispanic market or carniceria near you, buy carne ranchera (the same meat used for carne asada) and bypass slicing the flank steak, because that is what carne ranchera is:  Thin sliced flank steak.  Then this is a snap to put together!

Sound much like my recipe and I am German. If you have a crockpot you do not have to bother to brown the meat. It will come out the same. Found that out after 20 years of preparing the old fashioned style with browning, than another german lady tod me it is really not necessary to brown the meat. That way it is a fast fix meal. Fill, roll and cook in the crockpot. I  also think pickles are a must, but that may be regional different.

Excellent recipe. We've been to Bavaria many times and this recipe is about as authentic to the region as it gets. The things I did differently was to par-cook the bacon and then browned the rouladens in the bacon fat. We used round steaks that the butcher sliced for us. DO NOT use sandwich steaks as previously recommended as they are too thin. Additionally, I used beef broth for simmering as well and then thickened it for the gravy. Remember, the longer the rouladens simmer, the more tender they will be. I simmered mine for 2 hours and they were fork tender.

My mom is from Franconia (Franken) and we basically use this receipe. We use German mustard, but smooth rather than whole grain. For those who may be inclined to omit the pickles, DON'T! They add a necessary flavor and further tenderize the meet. If you slice a whole dill pickle lengthwise and make those slices thin, they, and the thin slices of onion and thinly sliced bacon will all but cook away during the braising process. Also, use half water and half beef boullion; all boullion makes the gravy too salty since the liquid reduces considerably during cooking. And you must use the bay leaf--it's pretty standard in most German cooking! You need to make the gravy as well. We prefer potato dumplings as a side, but noodles are  more traditional.

This is close to what my grandmother and mother made in Germany.  They browned the onions and bacon first before placing them on the meat.  After the meat was rolled it was dusted in flour then browned in the bacon drippings.  This method adds alot of extra flavor.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!  My mother makes these.  Tips: Ask the butcher to cut some thin cut round steak for you.  Most butchers never heard of rouladen and will cut it too thick, so tell them to cut it VERY thin.  Not as thin as a cold cut, but close to it. Also, don't use toothpicks if at all possible.  The meat sticks to the toothpicks and your rouladen will fall apart when you try to yank the toothpicks out.  Best are metal mini skewers, 2 - 3 inches long, I found mine at a yard sale, perhaps they were for hors d'vours originally. Or tie the rouladen shut with a couple rotations of string. In the center,   the onions and raw bacon needs to be finely chopped.  Then low heat, and in addition to the suggested beef bullion cube, add some corn starch to thicken up a good gravy.  Use a covered pot, one that's about 3" deep.  I have an excellent one that has a glass lid and a thick metal bottom for even heat.  This is the primo German dinner, top of the line!!!!

My ex-mother in law was from Schweinfurt Germany and she used this same recipe with a couple variations. She used half a (breakfast size)sausage link instead of pickles in her roulden. She did tell me that she had heard of pickles being used. The sausage added a hearty taste with the steak, sausage,and bacon meats combined.  She also browned hers really dark in a skillet. She then made a dark savory gravy using the dark bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet. She would put beef broth in the skillet and heat it. When it started to come to a boil, she would reduce the heat and begin scraping the bits off with a wooden spoon until they were all dissolved into the broth, then make a very dark gravy by adding a little red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and thickening with cornstarch and more broth. I prefer to use flour for thickening because cornstarch gravy tends to gel when refrigerated, and doesn't reheat as well. I am excited to make these again after a lot of years!

This is one of my husband's most favorite foods, but I had never tried cooking it at home before. This recipe was great! I followed the recipe except for these slight modifications. I used round steak instead of flank, I semi-fried my bacon before adding to the roll. I used a generous amount of mustard with horseradish on each one, and cooked in lower sodium beef broth with a splash of worcestershire. I couldn't get all my onions to stay on the rolls, so I chopped the leftovers up and added them to the beef broth, along with one dill pickle slice chopped, and one tablespoon of mustard. I simmered them for more like 2 hours after they browned. I served with the German Red Cabbage recipe from this site, and boiled russet potatoes. All in all a wonderful recipe, my only change next time will be to cut my round steak smaller, say 3" by 6-7". My rolls were a little large. Thanks Ron for sharing this!

My paternal grandmother was raised on a farm in East Prussia in the 1880's. She cooked on a wood- burning stove. When she made rouladen she used strips of bacon, German mustard, diced onion, diced pickle. After rolling & tying it she rolled it in flour then browned it in lard in a cast iron skillet. She added some water. Sometimes she cooked it on the stove top. Sometimes she baked it in the oven. In 1907 my grandparents emigrated to America. As a kid in the 1950's I was one of the beneficiaries of her magnificent cooking talents. When I make rouladen I too like to brown it in flour because I think it makes the finished dish taste better, including the gravy. The only change I make is that I brown the meat in vegetable oil not lard in order to reduce the saturated fat.

The main things about this recipe that differs from the way it is made in germany is the ingredients; german mustard is spiced differently than ours-the closest to it is dijon, and yes horse radish is necessary, also german pickles (or gerkins) are sweeter than our dill pickles but not as sweet as our bread n butter pickles-good luck finding an in-between in your local grocery and german bacon for this recipe is cut from a block not just cut "American" thick. It should not only cook for a long time but it should also sit for about an hour after cooking before it is served. It is a delish dish when prepared right-good luck to all!!

I agree with Linda McLean's review when she said: "Rouladen recipes can be different depending on the area of Germany you're from."  That's SO true! I clearly remember both my German-born grandmother and my father saying: "NO PICKLES!!" So- I don't use them or like them in my rouladen. I did notice that no one mentioned- what I consider the "key" method/ingredient in this: black pepper.
When we make it, we heavily pepper the meat before rolling (and salt it then, too.) soft-fry & cut the bacon in long strips, use a lot of onion in long slices, not chopped (for easier rolling). We have never used:  pickles, mustard, horseradish, dairy, garlic or other veggies. Nor an oven.
For our family, it's a very simple, albeit time consuming, recipe: Beef (cut REALLY thin), bacon, onion, pepper, salt & beef stock or water. Oh yeah- flour for the gravy. I do tweak the gravy & I might, now, try some of the other variations. But I still can't bring myself to like pickles in it. (My family was from Danzig.)  :)
Also- after browning the rolls-ups, place in a crock-pot w/ the beef stock & pan scrapings and other then making gravy & side dishes, you're good to go.

I've had this recipe saved for a long time and decided that tonight was the night for German food. This was a very good recipe. But I have to admit that I couldn't bring myself to use bouillon cubes and water and instead subbed in beef broth. In addition to the onions, I added some finely chopped mushrooms. I did let this all sit and marinate for the day in the fridge and then had my daughter put it in the oven covered for 2 hours at 300. Once done, I did thicken the gravy.  Served with german Spaetzle. Really good and will be made again.

This is simply one of my favorite dishes.  My mother has been making this as long as I can remember, but with a few changes. First, she puts a slice (or two) of black pumpernickel bread into the sauce while it's cooking, second, she puts in a cup (more or less) of strong black coffee.  This adds a dark richness to the gravy that is simply unbeatable!! Served with spaetzle and red cabbage, this is a fall/winter meal that is to die for!!!

My husband's aunt had a similar recipe, but I tweeked it a little, and he says mine is the best he's ever had:
6 skirt steaks
quarted pickles 
12 slices of thick bacon (fried to medium crisp and save the drippings) 
chopped onions
mustard
Spread mustard on each steak, place 2 strips of bacon(1 on each side), lay pickle 1/4 horizontally, sprinkle with chopped onions. Roll up the steaks, and secure with toothpicks. Dredge in flour, and brown in the bacon drippings. Grease a 13x9 baking dish with any remaining bacon fat, place rolls in dish, and pour a can of beef broth over the rolls, Cover with foil, and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Turn the rolls and continue baking for 20 more minutes. Remove rolls from baking dish, and pour all the juices and any pieces of meat, onion etc, into a sauce pan, and add a little flour to thicken.  This makes the most wonderful gravy. Takes a little time to prepare, but believe me , it's worth it!!

I grew up eating this made by my German Oma.  I've always loved it.  The recipe is the exact one I've used for years only I've never heard of the pickle in it. (Maybe regional) I made this for my husband and he was totally hooked. Now we have it at least twice a month. Please try it, I know it sounds simple, but it's delicious. Thanks for putting this recipe out there!

This was amazing.  Recently on a trip to Thailand, one of our team members had rouladen at a German restaurant we ate at and he said that his wife also cooks it at home.  So when we returned home, I went in search of a recipe to make it.  Well, this is the one I used and it was amazing.  Our butcher doesn't carry flank steak so I had him cut some sirloin real think and it was perfect.  I have to admit that I didn't put pickle on it because I thought that would be very strange.  But next time I'm going to add pickle, because I think that's the crowning ingredient.  Anyway, this was great and I'll now fix it on a regular basis for our family.

"Wow!  This is DELICIOUS!"  Those were my husband's exact words.  This is a fabulous recipe.  It wasn't nearly as time-consuming as I thought it would be, and I didn't have any trouble making the rolls.  I think the trick is in how you slice the flank steak.  I sliced mine the long way and was careful to make sure I had slices that were thick enough to hold together but thin enough to cook.  I used French's Bold 'n Spicy brown mustard (don't use ordinary yellow mustard).  I think it's the mustard that makes this better than other rouladen I've had.  This recipe is a definite favorite at our house.  It's not healthy, so we won't have it weekly or anything, but it is requested for birthday dinners, etc.  A great fall or winter meal is rouladen, mashed potatoes, and acorn squash.

If you want to lower the fat content, it tastes just as good if you slice the bacon strips in half the longway.  Use the leaner half and discard the other portion.

This recipe is very close to the one my mom made. This was the first time my husband and his friend had Rouladen, and they both loved it. I followed the ingredients quite closely, but did make a couple changes in how I prepared it: 1. I pre-bought rouladen cut steaks from the butcher. 2. I minced the onion and 1/2 a jar of pickles (1 jar seemed way too much) and diced the bacon, and mixed it all in one bowl. 3. I added Dijon mustard to the filling until it was relatively creamy, then spread it evenly on each piece of beef. 4. I added reduced salt beef broth instead of beef cubes and water, and baked them for about 90 minutes at 325.  I then removed them from the pan and made a gravy with the juices, then served them with the gravy over the rolls.

Good receipe.  I used tenderized roundsteak that I flattened even more with a tenderizer hammer.  I spread a little dijon mustard, garlic powder nad black pepper on each strip of meat before putting on the bacon and onion and rolling up.  My family does not like dill pickles, so I omitted them.  I used a can of beef broth with some garlic cloves and bay leaf as suggested by others.

THanks for sharing this recipe!  It passed the test of my Oma.  We had this for Christmas dinner and it was awesome.  Some variations I did based on comments here and researching other recipes:  We used top round, instead of flank steak at the recommendation of my butcher.  It was cut for me scallopini style.  I used grass fed beef.  I also used organic beef broth instead of bouillon.  I sauteed finely chopped onion, celery and carrots with the roulladen and included it in the simmer sauce.  I also deglazed the pan with pinot noir.  OMG what a smell!!!!  I chopped the pickles fine, so that the bacon, onions and pickles were all the same size.  I used turkey bacon (we have people who cannot eat pork in the family).  By deglazing the good brown stuff with the wine after browning the rouladen, I was able to get the dark rich sauce I remembered my Oma making.  I also made mine one day before and then slowly reheated them.  I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I used toothpicks on some, and string on others to secure the rolls.  Both ways worked.  I ran out of dijon and used yellow mustard on half.   I really could not tell the difference.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I am very disappointed in this recipe. I have used my mother's recipe for years and thought I would try something different, but shouldn't have. My mother's recipe is the best I have ever eaten. Since we are German this has always been my favorite dish. You should be using spicy German mustard, peppered bacon, chopped onions. Brown in skillet then let cook in crockpot for at least 2-3 hours until tender. Very tender.

What I like best about this recipe is that it's easy to modify.  Instead of the pickle mixture I've used dressing out of the box with a small can of mushroom stems and pieces mixed in.  If I have leftover gravy from pot roast I'll use that rather than the gravy in the recipe.  I've also used leftover French Onion Soup mixed with a can of cream of mushroom soup for the gravy.  All in all, it's good as is but super easy to modify if you're trying to use up leftovers too.  Make sure you don't overcook though...it can get dry in a hurry.

I made this with all the suggestions that I read on this site including...bay leaf, garlic, onion, a little red wine, worchestshire sauce, and cornstarch to thicken.  This was just the recipe that I was looking for.  I am not sure it is as good as the German restaurant I went to, but it would sure make a good run for the money.  I relished every bite and did not want to stop eating.  The meat was extremely tender and the gravy was excellent served on mashed potatoes.  I served this also with the Red Cabbage recipe from this site because that is what they served at the German restaurant I went to.  Thank you for sharing the recipe and thanks to all of you who reviewed it.  I will definitely be making this again perhaps even for guests.

This is a good basic starter recipe. There should be salt and white pepper sprinkled on both sides of meat after pounding thin. Traditionally the meat used is beef shin, but is hard to find outside of a good butcher's.  An alternative to the bacon is a chunk of smoked Gouda cheese. I sear mine in salted browned butter and cook in same pot. Add water and cook on medium heat with peppercorn and bay leaf for 2 hours. Remove peppercorn and bayleaf and add beef bouillon.  Cook for 2-3 more hours on medium low. Use cornstarch and water mixture to thicken gravy after removing roulades.  I serve mine with rotkohl ( red cabbage) and potato dumplings. This is how my Moms in West Berlin made them when I was growing up.

Excellent!  I was hesitant at first to cook with pickles, but very impressed with the outcome!  My husband spent some time in Germany and was also impressed.   I did substitute cube steak and added chopped onion, bacon and pickles to the sauce and thickened it a little with flower as well like a few people suggested and it was amazing!

This was really good. Instead of the beef bouillon, I used a package of Knorr's Sauerbraten gravy mix that a friend got from Germany. We had it with red cabbage, applesauce, and barley cooked in beef broth. Thank you for a nice recipe!

Well, it's been 8+ years since my first review of Ron's recipe as "DRBONES". And I'm sure he hit a home run based on how many folks saved the recipe! It's been very interesting, over the years, reading all the variations that have been posted. Some of which I'll try. I'm sure variations exist regionally. Local, and known to me, Chef Hans...grilled? I'll give it a shot for sure! And to the individual that stated never to use sandwich steaks, you've never been broke. ;) Growing up, my German family, new to the US, had little money. And sandwich steaks, at that time, fit the budget. Nowadays, they're expensive! These sandwich steaks that we now use ARE NOT STEAK-UMMS or whatever they're called. Keep the new ideas flowing folks...I'm still cooking....and better than ever! Thanks again Ron for keeping the old traditions alive!!!!

Just like Grandma used to make! These were one of my favorite dishes as a kid and I'm so glad I found this recipe. The only changes I made were the omission of onions (I don't like them). I also put the rouladen and the broth mix in a roasting pan and put in the oven at 350 for about 35-40 minutes.

I thought this was excellent.  I used Goldman's spicy mustard and added horseradish to it.  I used a cut of Bottom round roast and pounded it out thin and cut into 3" x 6" Strips.  For my liquid i used a combo of beef broth and I actually dumped in a beer (Miller Lite), added in a couple cloves of Garlic and a bay leaf.  These were excellent.  I really was happy with how it turned out.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

My fiance is half German, and grew up eating this food. I had only tasted rouladen once, but thought I should give it a try and prepare it myself. They were very good! I followed the recipe exactly (yes, the pickle too, as it is pretty typical of this dish) and they came out tender and delicious. My fiance told me they were among the best (and probably the best EVER) he has had! :) We had them with Traditional mashed potatoes from this site also.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone I have cooked it for loves it! I make a delicious sauce with the broth using only cornstarch, to serve over spatzle or noodles. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe, it's fantastic the way it is! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe far exceeded my expectations. It was easy to make, had the perfect ingredients for balance,  the taste was authentic. A great recipe, that my family enjoyed. As a side dish we had mashed potatoes, and red cabbage. It's a keeper.Thanks...Ron, for sharing.

I have made this recipe for the past 30 years for my family. I follow the recipe exactly except for the pickles.  I serve my rouladen and gravy over homemade spatzle.  There are never any leftovers.

A family favorite in our house but for my stock I use 2 Au-juice packets and 2 brown gravy packs, along with a cup of vinegar (use less or none, but a little adds great flavor) and 3-4 cups water. I also like my meat cut thin (I ask the butcher to slice it thin like lunch meat) it makes the meat much more tender and flavorful. I make a spread of relish and mustard (I love using a brn sugar pecan stone ground mustard I found), spread that on the thin meat slices then add a small handful of chopped onion and raw cut up bacon. Roll up and close with tooth picks. Place the rolls in the stock and cook all day, at least 5 hours.  My husband swears it's even better warmed up the next day, but he could never wait to eat it the next day if it's in the fridge.  Plus I save part or all of the left over stock to start my stock the next time makes it better and better. My husband knows when I've started over with my stock, and he askes why I didn't save it from before.

Try adding some sour cream to the gravy every once in a while for a nice change.

My father is from southern Germany and his family taught my mom to make this dish, which she did every Christmas Eve.
This year, I decided to try it for myself.  I went to a couple of supermarket butchers, but they wouldn't cut the meat the way I wanted.  I called a German deli and asked if they had rouladen meat & they knew exactly what I wanted.  I just told them how many rolls I was making & that was that!  I found this recipe extremely easy to make & roll up because of the right cut of meat.  I salted & peppered the meat, then followed the recipe, using the flat sliced sandwich stacker pickles instead of spears.  I didn't have any boullion cubes, but used water & a can of beef broth, a couple of bay leaves & peppercorns.  After thickening, the gravy was delicious! The meat was so tender, you could slice it with a fork.  I served this with mashed potatoes & red cabbage and it was pronounced a hit by everyone at Christmas dinner.  My husband begged me to make it again; and some friends said I had to call them for dinner the next time I make it.    Thanks for the great recipe!  Now I can have my childhood favorite whenever I want!

My husband is from Germany, so I thought I would try to make something German...to me, having pickles rolled in meat didn't sound too appetizing. Boy, was I wrong! This is an excellent recipe that is delicious. There was only one change I made, and that was instead of water and beef bouillon I used a packet of Lipton's Beefy Onion Soup Mix and 2 cups of water to simmer the rouladen in. It adds more flavor and once the meat is cooked you just need to thicken the broth up a bit and you have a great tasting gravy. My husband loved it, and so did I. I will definitely continue making this dish.

Hearty, warm comfort food, German style. Very good. My husband had 3 servings. I found it rather difficult to roll the meat with bulky onions and pickles, but after inserting many toothpicks, I did get them put together. Of course, after their done the toothpicks come out, the meat stays in the roll shape. Definitely will make again.

This recipe was delicious and worth the effort.  However, it took a lot more time than I thought.  It might be better to prepare it a day ahead and just reheat it in the gravy...it tastes just as good if not better!

I have been making Rouladen for years, from a recipe my mom brought from germany. the only way hers is different is that she added finely chopped carrot to the inside of the rolls and of course made a fabulous gravy from the broth and drippings.

We used flat breakfast steaks instead of flank steak, because we're poor. It was a tiny bit tough, but I don't know if flank steak would have been better. We definitely didn't need that much onion. And we're glad we read a review that suggested making gravy - it wouldn't have been as good without gravy. But anyway - really good, and totally worth the wait!

This was taught to me by a German immigrant friend. Every person seems to have their own twists but the basics are the same. I will agree that pan drippings are essential! Sear the meat well then roast. I sautéed added onion and bacon in the pan first, remove then add the rolls. No need for boiling them if you toss your oven worthy pan in the oven. The mustard and pickles make the meat super tender. The pan-dripping gravy is the best! And military ladies your commissary butcher already knows how to cut flank for roulade if unlike my local comm it's not already packaged that way. I also use string vs toothpicks- much easier to remove after cooking. A flour based roux from the pan is best. My husband and son go berserk for this dish!

This is a delicious recipe...definitely worth 5 stars - but I make mine a bit different and I actually like my recipe a bit more.  I use the same ingredients other than the pickles.  I use relish instead.  I always cook my bacon first - I like crunchy bacon - I also roll my thin steak around a hot dog or sausage with all of the fixings next to the hot dog.  I cook mine stovetop to brown, then add a touch of water to start making my own gravy then I add a jar of Franco-American Beef Gravy and let that simmer for awhile.  I always serve this dish with potato dumplings or spaetzle.  Delish, my families favorite!  We just HAVE to have the Hebrew National hot dog in the center though...I was a bit lost without it.

This was a very good recipe...I changed it a little. First I didnt use pickle because my family would have had a coronary if i tried to feed them a pickle....though i have made it that way before for myself and liked the pickle in there.  I added crushed garlic to the onion and bacon...and rolled the rolls in flour mixed with salt and pepper before browning.  Also I sauteed onion and garlic and added some rosemary and a bay leaf just before adding the water and the bullion....i used better than bullion as well.  At the end before serving I made a pan gravy and replacd the rolls into the gravy and served with mashed potatoes and corn....made a good hearty and easy meal.

This recipe was very good.  The pickles overwhelmed the flavor of the dish, but it certainly had a distinct flavor not typical of American cuisine.  I prepared this with two sides: Chris's Kraut and Spaetzle II, both found on this site.  The only thing I did different is that I pulled the rolls out of the sauce and thickened the sauce with a roux of butter and flour to make a thicker gravy.  I wanted the gravy thick to go over the Spaetzle.

I'm 71 years old and was raised on German food. My wife came from Berlin in 1963 and I enjoy good old fashion German cooking everyday.  We make rouladen about 3 times a year.  We use the same recipe except that we have used different types of mustard and we always add a small wedge of carrot cut lengthwise. Will be uploading a picture soon.

Hi! I am german and this recipe is quite similar to those used here, namely for the "Rheinische Rouladen" except for the fact that they are made with a mix of ketchup and mustard (instead of just mustard) and without ham

best wishes from germany;)

I made this to kick of the start of Octoberfest.  I was nervous about the amount of prep, but once started the assembly and cooking of the rolls went really fast.  I regret not reading all of the reviews because I would have liked to cook this just slightly longer than an hour. Everyone loved it and they were a huge success.

I would suggest trying to get the Kohne pickles, available in most grocery stores either in the pickle section, or in the international food section.Also once you have browned them, put them in the oven in a casserole dish for apprx. 1 hr at 350 degrees. They will come out nice and tender.

This is only slightly similar to how I was taught.  We get any type of roast we can with minimal veining and have the butcher slice it to almost luncheon meat thinness.  We spread mustard and season with garlic and onion powder and salt and pepper.  Then we add diced raw bacon, raw ground beef, minced onion and  minced garlic, minced green onion and parsley (and occasionally green chiles--hey, it's normal in Brazil!)...then secure with toothpicks.  They end up being about the length of your longest finger and about 3 fingers thick.  We then reseason everything and sear them in a pan and add them to a large pot, pausing every other time to add a little water and scrape the brown bits from the skillet into our pot.  Add enough water to cover them and boil until done.  That way you don't need the bullion or the beef stock.  It doesn't take that long if you grab a bottle of wine, make an assembly line and have fun!

I found this recipie a little less then a year ago, and I have made it a dozen + times.  I follow the directions to the tee.  I use the ground stone mustard as called for.   (The mustard is the key to this recipie)  I tried to have the flank steak cut for me at the grocery, but it was to thin.  A little thick is good.  Won't be dry.  This is my husband absolute favorite. It is also requested everytime my brother comes to visit.  His friends have even shown up at my door asking me if I would make this for them.   I LOVE THIS RECIPIE!!!  Thank you so much.

My husband grew up in germany, and he has always talked about how much he loves Rouladen, so I searced numerous recipes for it and settled on this one.  It was extremely easy to make. I bought a pretty expensive german mustard to try and make it more authentic, and the mustard was too spicy for my husband.  Other than that, I believed he liked it!  I added a variety of spices as well such as paprika.  Next time I will prepare it with a milder mustard.  I put the rouladen on top of buttered noodles.  The main reason I chose this recipe over others was because it was the shortest cooking time for rouladen.
Thanks!

I lived in Germany for 9 years and this recipe is quite authentic. I loved it. It is VERY important that you don't skimp on the mustard... it will make a huge difference.

Loved it! Used thin top sirloin instead of flank steak, but otherwise followed recipe. Served w/German egg noodles (broad) and made milk gravy from the sauce. My husband now calls this recipe his favorite!

To the ingrediants inside each roll, add tomatoe slices.  Season with Salt and pepper. Brown each roll in the butter before simmering in the water and bouilon bath.  Make a rue at the end, add a little milk and add to the pot. This is the gravy.  Serve with Mashed Potatoes and Red Cabbage.  This is the traditional German way of making this dish.

This recipe is awesome! It tastes just like the rouladen my mom used to get from the German deli for special occasions!  There is a wonderful balance of flavor between the vinegar pickle and the smokey bacon, and then you have that wonderful gravy to go with it.
The first time I made it, I cut the meat myself - it tasted right, but the meat was too thick.  If you do try this recipe, I recommend you do what I do.  I buy a London broil (when it is on sale) and I ask the butcher to cut it for me, lengthwise, 1/4" thick.  It makes this recipe soooo easy. (And inexpensive).
I have made this recipe many, many times, and nothing about it needs to be changed.  Most of the people I have served this to have never heard of Rouladan, but they always love it!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe was pretty simple and tasted great.  I slightly altered the recipe and used dijon mustard because I could not find the German stone ground mustard, I used sweet relish instead of dill pickles, and used garlic powder in place of onions.  I then thickened the gravy with a little bit of a cornstarch and cold water mix.  Served it with potato pancakes and appleasuce.  YUM!

This is a GREAT recipe. I didn't have flank steak, so I used cubed steak, Never do that. It was good, texture was not so appealing. I will try thick sliced Roast Beef next time. I also used to cans of Beef broth rather then the bouillon cubes. Made an awesome gravy for the Spaetzle. MMMMMM good. Thank you for posting.

I found that this recipe worked well taste-wise, but for some reason the bacon didn't cook when I followed the recipe as written. I had to improvise, which meant that the meat got a bit dry and over-cooked. Maybe it was just my experience?? Next time I think I'd do it in a slow-cooker. Otherwise, pretty good recipe... thanks for sharing

Had made this years ago and wanted to have it again. Thanksto Allrecipes.com you can find these quaint old recipes.  It was just as good this time as in the past. Made it in the pressure cooker to have it very tender. I wound up slicing mine onto extra wide egg noodles and served with sauce made from the juice and added a dolop or two of sour cream on top.  For just my husband and I , it was a hit ..but it's one of those dishes that you make only once in awhile when you want to recall tastes from the past like ourselves.  It was very good served too with mashed potatoes.

I am not sure what was done differently that everyone is raving about this recipe. I found it to be bland and the meat was dryed out and tuff after being in the water/bullion that long. I will make several changes before trying this one again.

Phenomenal!  If you have a hard time getting flank steak, get the meat department's "butcher" to slice down a bottom round roast.

My German mom taught me to make this. She didn't enjoy cooking but there were a few things she did do really well. And this was one of them. I used thin sliced round steak, yellow mustard, and capers instead of pickles. I braised it in the oven at 335 for 1 and 1/2 hours. It was fantastic. I have never used the pickles but someday I will.  Thanks for the recipe. I hadn't made it in years.

I have been making these for years but instead of flank stk. I usually use round steak and slice it very thin. If the meat is partially frozen it is quite easy to slice.  1/4 inch is too thick and won't be that easy to roll.  Have the strips long enough so you can easily give them a complete roll  at least 2 times. Sometimes I spread a little horseradish on the strips too which gives them a nice flavor.  I cook the bacon in the microwave for a few minutes before putting it on the meat, otherwise it stays pretty raw.  Instead of water I use either swansons or campbells beef broth and then thicken with flour to make a nice gravy and let simmer in the gravy.

I lived in Germany for several years and this is the exact recipe I got from a German neighbor, except I use Gray Poupon mustard and omit the pickle only because I don't like pickles.  This is a great recipe, good with mashed potatoes or spatze which is a german noodle you can find in the international section of most grocery stores.

I only put a thin layer of mustard on the meat and found the layer of mustard to have practically dissapeared.  I recommend putting more one than you would usually eat.

Terrific!  Tasted just like the ones my German Nanny made.  My husband and kids gave them the once over, but when they tried them they loved them too.  I made some "dirty noodles" and cabbage to go with them; it was a great meal that brought me back to my youth.  Thank You!  
The only changes I made were my Nanny's, I added bread crumbs to the center of the rolls, and wrapped the bacon around the outside of them.

I add red and green peppers to the meat, alternating them to give a nice color. I also season the meat with salt and pepper and paprika. I add sour cream and paprika, onions and more bouillon to the gravy mixture.  The sour cream is added minutes before serving. The meat is key as the previous reviewer stated and is very difficult to find here. That has been the greatest challenge. I will try braciolle that is flattened next time and hope that works.

One word; Excellent. 3 small tips rather than changes: Add horseradish to the mustard spread, 2 smashed garlic cloves to the broth and red wine. Can't wait to make it again.

I ALSO HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS FOR YEARS.  IF YOU'RE WATCHING YOUR CALORIES, OMIT THE BACON, USE POUNDED CHICKEN BREASTS AND CHICKEN STOCK INSTEAD OF BEEF.  EQUALLY DELISH.

This was okay, but no one liked the pickles in this or the flavor the pickles left. I used cooking string as I was out of toothpicks, but that was really difficult to hold the meat rolled up and wrap the string around too and I needed 3 hands. The toothpicks are much easier to use, and easier to get out when you're ready to eat too. The famiy thought this needed a sauce or gravy which this really didn't make. Thanks, I enjoyed trying this.

Delicious, not too hard, and smelled wonderful while it was simmering! I couldn't fit as much pickle and onion as the recipe called for in the rolls, though...

Not bad. To improve, I beat out Beef tenderloin flat, a little expensive- but you can't take it with you, right? Cook on grill, direct heat with hardwood charcoal 3 mins. each side. If you don't have a charcoal grill, you can use a propane grill & smoker box with hickory chips. If you don't have a grill at all, for Pete's sake man, buy one. Big difference. Simmering makes the meat tough, hard to cut , and hard to chew.

This is a great version of what I grew up with. Our family's recipe varied a bit. We pounded the flank steak until it was very thin. We put a thin layer of stuffing (pepperidge farm works well)and a slice of dill pickle.  Browned the rolled steaks very well in olive oil, then add Beef broth, Garlic, and chopped onion, cover & simmer for about 45 minutes.  Remove steak rolls and thicken gravy. Add roll ups back to thickend gravy and serve. Great with spaetzle and red cabbage.

This recipe is very good!! It is almost exactly how we make it in our home. My dad is from Germany and taught us how to make this at a very young age. We serve ours along side dumplings and red cabbage! It's a great comfort food for those chilly autumn and winter nights!!

Fantastic, just like my German Omi makes, except she adds a teaspoon of capers to each.  Gives a bolder taste.  For best taste, cook the day before serving and reheat.

My husband made this for an Oktoberfest dinner party & it got rave reviews.  We used sliced pickes (sliced long) instead of spears & used thinly sliced flank steak.  Next time I will pour the gravy in a pan & thicken it up a bit.  Very flavorful & tender.

As someone who is 50% German this was one of our favorites growing up. Though I don't think my great Aunt (who always cooked this recipe better than anyone) liked the pickles as she left them out. Also, she would pound the steaks so they were extra thin and tender - literally melted in your mouth!

My mother is German and this has always been one of my absolute all time favorite dishes.  My husband was leary of pickles cooked in meat as well as another writer, until he tasted it!  The bacon, onion, mustard (spicy brown works the best) and pickle spear give the meat such a wonderful flavor.  I would highly recommend this recipe.  One foot note... my mother chops a clove of garlic and adds a bay leaf to the pot as well.

We learned to make Rouladen while living in Germany. I was taught this basic recipe, only my German friend uses julienned carrots, and no bacon.  We browned the rolls, then baked in beef gravy, and served it with spaetzle (homemade German noodles).  Delicious!

I have made a similar recipe, but after browning the meat rolls, I added a quartered onion and a chopped carrot. Then, after simmering for an hour, remove the meat rolls and set aside. Use a hand-style blender to cut vegetable chunks until they are blended into the broth. Then add a cup of cream or half-and-half and blend again until smooth. Pour creme mixture over the cooked rouladen to serve. 

Also, I once found "Rouladen Rings" at a kitchen supply store. They hold the meat rolls together with out fuss and can be adjusted to size. They are much better than fooling with alternatives. The store is in the states, not Germany, so keep your eyes open for this product if you like to make this dish often.

This is a robust meal with wonderful flavours.  I inserted a quarter dill pickle and rolled it in with the mixture.  It added a tartness which went well with the meat.

I've made this recipe quite a few times. It's really easy and delicious. My husband likes it very much.
I use ham instead of bacon, and beef broth instead of the water and bouillon. Also I thickened the broth a little with flour and water at the end. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I had originally had this dish when a German woman I worked with brought it in and at first we all weren't too sure about it (steak and a pickle???) but once she talked us into it we loved.  I was so happy to find this recipe and be able to make it myself since I haven't seen her in years.  Everybody really liked and I got the approval to make it again, high praise in my family.

This was ok, kinda disappointed with all of the 5 star ratings.  Maybe more of a sentimental dish? Even tried user suggestions: horseradish mustard, I had with egg noodles, husband had baked potato. Too much hassle for mediocre turn out.  Will not make again.

This was great, and simple to prepare. I sprinkled black pepper on the rolls before rolling up and toothpicking them. At the very end of cooking, I added some sour cream and a couple of tablespoons of catsup. Served it with wide egg noodles.

I've made this a lot of times and everybody just wolf it down everytime. We omit the bacon because we don't like wet bacon, sometimes I use ham, sometimes not. I use "breakfast steaks" because it's about the perfect thickness. And I use 1 can of beef broth instead of the boullion cube. I also thickened up the gravy at the end by adding flour water.

This is the right and best recipe for Rouladen. The pickles give the gravy the wonderful taste. Here in St.Louis,Mo the German butcher G&W cuts the right beef for Rouladen.

I love this dish, but my grandma made it with Skirt Steak which is expensive, but well worth it. I use saved bacon fat to brown the rolls and leave out the pickle. I will post my recipe to show how my family made this dish.

Yum! Followed recipe exactly but was short on time so instead of simmering for an hour,  I pressure cooked them for 7 minutes .  Turned out as I remember them and had dinner on in 30 minutes.  Also tried them with black forest ham instead of bacon (what I had on hand).  That was good too.

My family recipe is quite similar..after i brown the rouladen I make a brown gravy to simmer them in .  I add pickle juice to the gravy to add more flavour and of course sour cream at the end.  Then serve over spaetzle.  I also make a meatball version.

My husband doesn't like the pickle but prefers carrot instead...I make little thin slices of carrot and add them sideways so they roll easily...but I may try, as one reviewer suggested, chopping some dill pickle and adding a small amount for flavor...can't hurt, might help!! Worse that can happen is that I'll be eating them by myself before I switch back to no pickle!

Really delicious...I included a fresh garden carrot in the roll on one of the occasions I made this dish. I have also made it several times by the recipe as well. In the summertime this works great on the BBQ as well- just make sure to add a lot of broth in the pan to keep it moist. great recipe Ron!

This is the correct recipe for this German dish. My father was military and I was born in Frankfurt. My mother used to make this a couple of times a year just as your recipe instructs.

My grandma was German and I was born in Germany and my Dad had three tours there. My grandma passed a recipe on to the woman who gave birth to me (I wouldn't call her my mother since she never really was) and the woman who gave birth to me called it pigs in a blanket. Instead of rolling the bacon inside she made the Rouladen with the bacon on the outside. Very good recipe, ty for posting it.

My husband, who like many in Texas is of German descent, requested that I make this dish. It was a favorite his grandmother would make on Sundays….and wow, is the recipe good! Per the suggestions of other reviewers, I added Lipton's Beefy Onion Soup Mix to the sauce while the meat cooked. Then added a Thickening Paste (3 TBS Corn Starch and 1/4 Cup Water) to the gravy after I'd removed the meat to rest to make it a bit heartier. YUM!

If there is any left, this recipe gets better and better on Day 2 and Day 3.  Just make sure that you have enough gravy so it doesn't get dry.  It is also a great make ahead recipe and reheated the next day, even to serve to company.  We cook it in a covered pan in the oven with chunks of potatoes and carrots on top and then it is a complete meal. It is getting somewhat difficult to find meat counters where they will slice the beef and some no longer even have slicers.

I love rouladen and this hits the mark.
I cut the veggies in spears and add carrots to the veggies in the roll.
Like other reviewers, I add a bay leaf to the broth and then use corn starch to create a gravy at the end.

This is (almost) a dead ringer for my (German born) mother's rouladen... except after browning: oven bake- and have some extra onion cut up and ready to go into the baking dish.top woht aluminum foils (to keep the water in, and help steam up the onion...) when done, use drippings and onion bits as a base for brown gravy, serve over rouladen (watch out for string or toothpicks!) :) MY FAVORITE

I always use smoked sausage spears instead of bacon. It disappears but flawors the Rouladen wonderfully, and adds less fat. This is the first time I've put onion in the rolls, but I think it's a good addition.

Very yummy! The only thing I do different is cook the bacon partially to get rid of some of the grease and I tie them with kitchen string.

I felt this came out dry and the flavors didn't quite mix. I've never had rouladen, so I guess it's just not my cup of tea.

I don't use butter but Crisco, it makes such a wonderful gravy. After the Rouladen are sauteed to tender, put them on a warming plate and thicken the gravy with a bit of flour or potato starch, bring to a short boil, reduce heat, put the Rouladen back in and keep all nice and warm until you serve with sweet and sour red cabbage and either boiled potatoes or Spaetzle (the Southern German noodles).

The flavor of this dish is awesome! Mmm!  Everyone loved it! The only things I would change next time is to use cooking string to tie it instead of toothpicks because it was a pain to roll. I also used thick cut bacon and would use thinner bacon next time because it didnt fully cook. OMG so good though!

My nana is from Austria and this is her specialty. I was pleased to find that this is almost exactly like hers. We've altered ours to taste (like omitting the pickles, tenderizing the steaks, and halving the width of the strips to about an inch to inch and a half). I also do up mine in the crockpot for 6-8 hours on low (or 4-5 hours on high).  God bless the germans for this awesome creation!

My husband made this for us not too long ago.  I was really leery of trying it.  Who had heard of pickles wrapped in meat?!?  I waited until after my husband and our 6 kids tried it -- they loved it!  Then, when I tried it, I could see why!!!  I am making it again tonight, and will many more times in the future!  :)

great recipe. My mother made these all the time but with sweet pickle. We are Polish, so maybe that's how they do it. Either type of pickle tastes great.

This is fantastic. I thought the pickles were going to make it taste weird, but it was delicious. The flavors & textures blend perfectly. My husband LOVES this recipe, and I make it annually w/ German potato salad for his October birthday. Thanks!

Wow! This was great. I had never heard of Rouladen but was looking for something unusual to make. This was extremely flavorful, moist, and my picky husband loved it minus the onions in his.

This has been a favorite of mine since I was little growing up in Munchen.  We also "Americanize" it sometimes...by adding some stuffing to the mixture and some swiss cheese.  It is wonderful this way too.  Gotta love that German food!!

This sounds just like the recipe my born and raised German Mom makes.  I've seen her make it so many times I could do so in my sleep.

My Mom makes it exactly this way except:  She adds a couple of fresh, chopped tomatoes to the meat and gravy while it simmers and she uses dill spears instead of sliced.

I haven't made this recipe, but I frequently make German Rouladens from a family recipe.  I use round steak instead of flank steak, and it works just fine.  Actually, it is usually more tender and cheaper.  I use string instead of toothpicks.  I cut all the string I am going need before I start wrapping.  I do it assembly line style:  Beef, onions, bacon, parsley, any other ingredients. Yes, sometime it feels like you need a third hand. I Simmer the rouladens in beef stock or consume for 2 or more hours in the same pan I brown them in, resulting in a deeper flavor and fork tender meat.  Onions, bacon and parsley are standard ingredients, however mustard and pickles indicate the local traditions.  Hope this helps turn the recipe into a 5 star for everyone.

Very good and authentic! Tasted just like my German friend's recipe that I failed to get before his transfer. I used the refrigerated dill (Clausen) and added a small amount of dill juice to the sauce then thickened at the end.  Served with garlic mashed red potatoes and fried cabbage and onions.  Thanks will make often!!!

This is a great recipe!  I had never had Rouladen until my German neighbor made it and we fell in love with it...when she moved away, she would not share her "secret" recipe with us.  This recipe tastes just like hers!  
One suggestion is to be sure to get the stone ground mustard, it really gives it a great flavor.  Thanks for the recipe...even my 4 year old liked it.

I've never had Rouladen before, but my boyfriend wanted it for "Octoberfest" which we missed this year.  I looked this recipe up and I think it turned out great.  He said it was exactly what he was craving.  I picked up a flank steak but asked the butcher to cut it for me so it was the right thickness.  I also browned them and then put them in a crockpot on top of the leftover onion (red) that I didn't get inside the rolls.  I poured the water and 1/4 cup red wine on top, dropped in two beef bouillon cubes and let it cook on low for 3 hours (turning them over after 2).  I think next time I might cook them on high since the bacon didn't seem like it cooked enough.  I made gravy with the drippings (strained first).  I served it with German Spaetzle Dumplings from this site, another thing I've never had before.  Everything was delicious!  Thanks so much!

This is a favorite of our family.  We chop the pickles, onions and bacon and use mustard.  We have the butcher cut sirlion steaks as thin as he can get them.  We tell him we want to see through them.  My Mom always used the leftover pickles, onions and bacon to add to the pot before browning the rolls.  We floured the rouladen then browned them in a little oil along with the leftover po&b.  She always used beef consumme and simmered the rolls at least 1 1/2 hours.  She then skimmed off the fat and thickened the gravy.  This is served for very special occasions.

The Rouladen that my mother grew up eating and making never had bacon in it.  My family loves the pickles.  I don't know what it is but I even put pickles on my philly cheesesteak sandwiches.  Am thinking about trying it with the bacon though. It looks delicious.

Im german as well , we always add a small piece of carrots in them . Which you can do specially for the people who dont like the pickels.Just substitute them with carrots.
Also I do use beef broth and add some veggies to make a wonderful gravy.the veggies are being taken out before thickening the gravy but if you have a stick blender , you can just blend the veggies to and it will give the gravy another kick.

Followed this exactly- except that I chopped the onions and pickles before stuffing the rolls.  I think the pickles were too much.  I'd recommend garlic dills rather than plain old dill pickles.  The pickles were too sweet for us.  Also, I got to LOVE rouladen at this wonderful little German place when I was a teenager.  I think they must have been from a different part of Germany or something because this rouladen wasn't like theirs.  I think I was also a little disappointed by the reality not matching the memory.  But, my mom (who also loved the same restaurant) loved this recipe, so it wasn't a total flop.  I was bummed because I worked on this all afternoon and it wasn't what I was hoping it would be.  I hate it when that happens!?!?  Thanks for the recipe.

We made this for dinner this weekend and my German boyfriend loved it.  I used sliced top round sandwich steaks, and they worked perfectly.  I also used pickle spears instead of slices.  Simmered the Rouladen in 2 cups of water and Lipton onion soup mix for an hour and they came out perfectly.

I have been searching for a recipe that tasted like the Rouladen I remember eating on my trip to Germany a few summers ago. This is it! I always use less onion than average, that was my only change. And I used sandwich steaks from the grocery store- they come in the perfect size and shape! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Outstanding recipe, though I would recommend tying these together instead of toothpicks, mine were bulky and would not have held with toothpicks. The recipe itself was outstanding. Everyone in the family loved it. Highly recommended.

My son and I picked this out to make. I told my husband who's German and he said his Tante Erika used to make it so he showed me how. We used string because we didn't have toothpicks. We cut the pickles in spears. Next time according to his suggestions we'll serve it with cooked red cabbage or sauerkraut and german dumplings. Oh and his verdict was it was as good as or better than his Aunt's. My kids and I loved it too! I loved having a different taste than normal American ways of making meat. Added to say: We made this a second time for dinner guests and they LOVED it. It turned out just as wonderful. We even made it the night before and warmed it up with additional beef broth the next day and then made gravy out of the broth with a little flour. We made it with the Red Cabbage and German Spaetzle Dumplings, recipes also on this site, this time and it went perfectly!

This is very close to my German grandmother's recipe, except I omit the bacon, use German pickles, and add Better Than Bouillon to the water instead of a bouillon cube.  And I'm lucky in that I can get pre-sliced flank steak from my local military Commissary.  It's German comfort food at it's best!

Thank you for this easy to follow and delicious recipe! I do not try to slice the meat at home though, always buy from grocer already sliced thin.  Recipe  time is accurate but the flank steak it is cut from is not that tender, if I can I let it simmer for up to 2 hours in the oven at 300 F.

This was excellent!!  I think I browned it for too long, which made it dry, but I used 1/4" thick steak slices (can't remember what kind), and used chopped onions and dill pickle relish to cut down on the bulkiness of the rolls.  This was FABULOUS and I passed the recipe on to a friend who has been to Germany and loved these.  A++++++++++++!!!

I LOVE these. Since I discovered this recipe a few years ago, I've made these many, many times. They are fairly time consuming to prepare, but definitely worth it in the end. I usually serve with a side of spaetzle, brown gravy with mushrooms and some crusty bread. Fantastic. Thank you for sharing!

I messed this up a lot...couldn't get the meat thin enough (I tried to roll it with a can), cut the meat strips far too thin (~2" wide), and thus only used about half of the bacon, onion, and pickle.  Still, it came out fabulous...hard to believe.  Adding a gravy mix (beef and herb) to the
leftover drippings, as some have suggested, and then a little water made a wonderful gravy to pour over the top.

This is pretty close to the way my step-mother taught me to make this dish.  I add a package of brown gravy mix to the broth after taking the rolls out to thicken the sauce. Our meal is complete with boiled potatoes and a chinese cabbage salad.

I've made this recipe several times - fabulous.  Its really no effort.  My SO LOVES this.  I use sandwich steaks - thick or thin.  If they are a little thick just cover the pan for the first 45 minutes of cooking.  Definitely use a stone ground german mustard.  Used beef broth and added some garlic to the broth along with thinly sliced onions and a few shakes of worcestershire.  I thickened the broth with corn starch to make a wonderful gravy for mashed potatoes.  This is also pretty good without the bacon.  Our dog swiped the bacon off the counter last time before I could get more than one roll made.

This recipe is definitely worth the effort.  I used a combination of dark brown mustard with spicy horseradish mustard, and it was extremely tasty.  I also sauted onions and garlic in the pan while browning the rolls, so the gravy was a fabulous mess with an onion, garlic and mustard aftertaste.  Served with egg noodles and Broccoli with lemon butter.  This is definitely going on my 'comfort' food list...

Very good! Used sandwich steaks in place of flank steak with great results! Left off the pickles, used canned beef broth in place of boullion, and added 2t minced garlic, splash of worcestershire, and 3 small bay leaves to the beef broth while simmering. Added about 2T cornstarch to thicken broth to gravy before serving. Absolutely tasty! Served over rice! A repeat recipe for sure! Tastes a tiny bit like corned beef!

Since my dad is from Germany, this was a staple in my house while i was growing up. Now I make it for my family and it's always worth the labor! We serve this with red cabbage and potato dumplings. Great fall/winter treat!

I enjoyed eating it as much as building them (as my Danish Grandmother called them "Birds with no wings."   I am sure that I didn't follow the recipe to a T but it still tasted great.

Everything was great. Didn't have onion so used some onion powder. Threw them in the oven after for 5 minutes to brown the glaze. Very tasty. Everyone was satisfied.

Turned out great. Added beef base to make a rich broth. Simmered For an hour and it was tender. Then thickened for gravy and added a little cream. Served with fried potatoes and German red cabbage.

Yummy! So good! It is exactly how it should taste! Reminds me of my Oma’s! (She has been gone for 26 years)I’v tried other recipes with so so results. This recipe has out done a few “German” restaurants I’ve been too. I did add the rest of the onion (left over from slices part of the recipe) to the simmer broth...also delicious!! That gravy was sooo good! I also did, as mentioned from another reviewer, take the roulads out and heated up the broth to a boil and then simmered it all for an hour. Oh, I added my cornstarch for thickening to some beef broth, instead of water, to keep the flavour going! I was too excited to try it that I forgot to take a pic...next time

My father always made this dish for Christmas dinner and after his passing I continued this tradition in his honor. While stationed in Germany he fell in love with the dish. However, he made a few adjustments that simplified the process as well as eliminating the limp pickle that no one wanted to eat. Instead he took all the ingredients and chopped them up into a paste and spread over the beef. The bacon was chopped & fried prior to assembly and then sprinkled on the meat b4 rolling it up. He then browned the rolls in a skillet and added them to the beef broth & bay leaf in a slow cooker. The rolls r them slow cooked till they literally melt in your mouth. Dinner consists of the roulade, german potato salad and greenbeans with more bacon. Yum!!! I look forward to it every year.

First time cooking anything German, and it turned out great.  I like my food spicy, so I added a little scorpion chili powder and it came out great.

This is one of my favorites German dishes. I didn't add a bullion cube, as to make it Whole 30 compliant. It was so delicious, and fun to make! Will make again for a dinner party to impress my guests!

Tender and delicious! I used top sirloin which the supermarket had cut about to 1/4" for braciole. Pounded it thinner and cut 3 -4" X 6" pieces. Spread the slices with seeded, Dijon mustard, followed by partially cooked sliced onion, dill pickle slice, and 1/2 slice of lightly cooked bacon. Rolled tightly and fastened with toothpicks. Browned the rolls in reserved bacon fat. Placed rolls in a deeper pot and covered with 2 1/2 cups water plus 1 tsp "Better than bouillon" beef flavor. 
Simmered for about 90 minutes. Oops, I forgot the bay leaves!
Thickened gravy with cornstarch in a bit of water. Served with homemade spaetzle. Enjoyed by all. Will be making again!

Delicious!  Took me back to my childhood in Germany and wonderful Christmas Eve dinners.  The only change I made was to simmer the rouladen in 3 cups of beef broth and then add additional broth mixed with flour to thicken the gravy.  Served this with red cabbage and spaetzle and lots of that fantastic gravy.

This is virtually identical to my German mother's recipe with the exception of using paprika to color the bacon. What a great idea. I served it with Potato Cakes, from this website, and my husband said it was possibly the best meal he'd ever eaten. Thank you, Chef John, for another winner. Hubs always gets excited when I try a recipe from you.

I am a vegetarian but still love to cook meat for my family and BF. Prep was simple, ingredients were easy, taste was over the top and will definitely make this again! After talking to my local meat mogul I bought beef round tip steak ( cut wafer thin) roughly 3x7 slabs of beef that seemed closest to what the recipe called for. I used Kelly's SG mustard and Vlasic stackers dills and store brand bacon( large chopped).  I chopped up whatever onions that didn't make it into the rolls and threw them into the pan with the rolls after browning. Sautéed till tinder,  then sprinkled in some smoked paprika, 3 cloves of garlic (whole)and 3 bay leaves( removed later....the whole garlic cloves dissolved in the mix :). Dumped in a carton of beef broth and simmered probably two hours turning often. I had to thicken the gravy with flour/water mix.  It was fantastic! I served it over whipped potatoes. Another YAY ME dinner!
Thank you, Ron!

First brown the roll, then slow-cook in a mushroom gravy.
I use campbells gravy ( enough to cover all the rouladen) with a tablespoon of colemans dry mustard. 
You  can add mustard to taste.
It adds a dimension to the gravy.
I am from Germany and was taught this by my mother

My grandma was from Osek , Czech Republic and she used to make these. She, and I use sweet gerkin pickles instead of dill . I just throw them on the grill if it's a nice day. I usually don't use mustard but next time I'll put mustard on them.

Mine turned out tough - jerky-like. But the most unpleasant part was the bacon. I mostly believed it was not raw because the whole thing cooked so long but it looked raw and had raw texture and it's pork - you get worms from raw pork - so that thought was hard to get out of my mind - both me and my husband who is much more comfortable with medium to medium-rare meat than I am ended up picking the bacon out and pushing it to the side.

When I make a dish, there's always something I'd do differently.  Not this time.  This was fantastic!  I debated leaving the pickles out but I'm so glad I didn't.  They truly make this dish great.  I did follow the recommendations I saw in the comments to add bay leaves and garlic and to make gravy, though I used a roux instead of cornstarch, and I used beef stock instead of bullion and water.  Just delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We buy our meat from a local farmer and he has rouladen meat. we generally just make stir fry with this...this time i googled this recipe and it was GREAT! I used mushrooms in mine, and maybe next time I will cook the bacon a little bit before hand.
I'll definitly make this again...I might try and incorporate cheese in there some how though :)

So yummy!! I added a roux to make gravy from the cooking liquid which the recipe doesn't say to do. I didn't add any seasoning to the gravy and it was delicious!!

Tastes great. Make sure to thicken the juices to make the gravy, though. The recipe doesn't include it and that is a very important part of this dish. Try flour or a cornstarch slurry to thicken. I also recommend adding carrots.

We were going to an international dinner and we decided to make this because my husband's family is from Germany.  I was not excited to try this because of the mustard.  I took the onion off my bite but love doesn't this.  Someone at the party told me it was the best thing she has eaten in her entire life.   I made it exactly as written.

My family loves rouladen. This is basically the recipe that was handed down from my mom.  I  serve  rouladen  with grated potato pancakes, red cabbage, apples and of course gravy.  I pour some of the pickle juice in to the broth, it makes a wonderful tasting gravy!

I made is with ribeyes (they were cheap) It was very yummy. The pickle gave the steak a 'corned beefy' taste. Nice recipe.

I used beef broth instead of bullion cubes, I also subbed the dill slices with dill relish and used organic yellow mustard (which was just what I had on hand). I also used a whole half slice of thin bacon, added some minced garlic and left onions in slices due to we're in temporary housing right now and I don't have many tools on hand to work with. I added 1 tbsp cornstarch to the gravy to thicken. (REMEMBER TO MIX WITH COLD WATER @ a 1-1 ratio BEFORE ADDING - Very important when thickening with cornstarch.) Next time, I will try partially cooking the bacon and then brown the Rouladen in the bacon fat w/ 1/2 the butter called. I will also make sure to mince my onion and use German mustard. (It doesn't make a difference, but if you've had German mustard, you just prefer it.) The only reason I really gave the recipe 4 stars is because it doesn't make nearly enough gravy. It only made enough for 4 small Rouladen. Next time, I'll double the recipe for sure. I paired this with the 'German Spaetzle Dumplings' from this site. (This Spaetzle recipe is a fail proof, 5 star recipe! I highly recommend it and remember to ALWAYS leave in the nutmeg with any Spaetzle/German dumpling recipes for an authentic German taste.)

My Mother was German and this was her signature dish.  She used sweet gherkins, not dill pickles.  Also she added red wine, about 1/4-1/2 cup to the stock.  She also made gravy from the drippings and served with red cabbage and potato dumplings.  The sweet pickle makes a difference in flavor.  Yum

I made this for an Oktoberfest party at a friend's house. The flank steak I bought was too thick, but that was my own fault. (Make sure it's thin enough. If it's not, have the butcher slice it for you.) As I was making this, I thought it was one of the strangest concoctions I had ever seen and I hoped it would be good. Got it to the party and it was a hit! They were devoured with nothing left behind but an empty platter. I wouldn't change a thing and I'll definitely make them again!

Living in Mexico, I could not find dill pickles, so I decided to 'Mexicanize' it a bit by using pickled Jalapeno peppers (Jalapenos en escabeche).  My dinner guests, who are all used to 'picante' food (i.e. spicy hot), loved it, as did I.  You can control the level of spiciness by the quantity of chiles you use.  Also, instead of using beef bouillon, I used beef extract, which has a richer flavor, but don't salt the meat as the extract (and bouillon) has plenty of salt already.  Finally, I added 3 tablespoons of flour to the sauce to thicken it.  Everybody licked their plates!  I served it with 'rot col' (Braised red cabbage with apples, German style) asparagus with Hollandaise sauce, homemade spaetzle (use club soda instead of water for a light spaetzle)and homemdade German Brochen (hard rolls).

We used 3 Oxo cubes, about 2 tablespoons of Bisto gravy granules and flour and water to thicken the gravy once we had taken the rolls out of the pan.  The key is to concentrate on thickening the gravy after you have removed the rolls. Otherwise this recipe is as good as any we have had in any local German restaurant. We had it with the German potato salad you will find on this site which was spot on as well.

Tried it for the first time and loved it.  Even my kids, who usually only eat a few bites and then declare themselves full so they can get back to playing, ate every bite and gave it two thumbs up.  The only change I made was to add some corn starch to the sauce, to thicken it up slightly.  But that was it; an excellent recipe.

Oh wow!  Just like when I was a kid (or dare I say maybe even better?)  Only change was to thicken the sauce with flour, add a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and a few spoons of sour cream.  Thanks for this recipe!

This was pretty good!  I used a can of beef gravy instead of the bouillon cube, because I like a thicker gravy. Make sure your meat is long enough! I didn't make them quite long enough, and had to REALLY hold them together with the toothpicks. LOL

This recipe absolutely wonderful. The only thing I add is 1 tbsp tomato paste on the gravy. I took out the meat and leave the gravy in the pan. Add corn starch a little bit to thicken the gravy. Thanks Ron for sharing.

I loved this and so did my grandchildren.  I used a pork tenderloin instead of beef and it was delicious.  I also used a pickle relish.  We will have this again.

This was really good.  It tastes just like the rouladen we get at our local german restaurant! the only changes I made was I used bracciola instead of the flank steak.  I am going to do these in the crock pot from now on.  To good to only eat on the weekend.

All three of my girls ate this tonight! My oldest (8yo) gave it a 10 and asked for more for lunch tomorrow.  I used round steak pounded out, sweet hot mustard (only one I had besides yellow) and about 1/2 of the onion and pickle. I was afraid it might be too much for the kids if I did all of it.  I added maybe 1 tsp garlic powder to the mix. As suggested by others, I put leftover onion/pickles into the sauce, also a bit more garlic powder, black pepper and onion powder as it seemed it needed bit more flavor. Thickened sauce a little afterwards with some cornstarch.  Served with wide egg noodles. We will definitely make this again.

My husband doesn't care for pickles, so I substituted fresh jalapeno's.  It was great - gave the rolls a little kick.

Only changes made to the recipe were that I chopped all the filling ingredients and made in the crock pot.  I've never made rouladen, so don't really have a reference point.  The pickle was a weird taste though but that could've been the brand.  Some in the family liked it, some not so much.

Wow!This went over better than I expected!It was very different and exciting for those of us who grew up with the Italian side of the family and never got to experience the German side! :) The whole family loved it~especially my 7 year old daughter,who I was the most skeptical about.
 I served it with the Crispy Potato Pancakes from this site.They were both great with the gravy.I added the Worchestershire and peppercorns that someone suggested and it was a very good addition.They all asked me to make it again!

yummy, such good gravy, I used broth instead of water, and thickened the juices after the meat was tender.

I give this recipe four stars my husband gives it a 4.5 stars.  I pretty much made the recipe as-is and thought it was a little bland.  I will make some changes and I am sure it will be a hit.  Needless to say, neither of my kids would eat it but they are at an age that a good meal consist of chicken and fries or hot dogs and mac-n-cheese.

Very yummy-even my toddler liked them! I did it in the crock pot last time and it was wonderful. I'm making them this Mother's Day for my Mom & Grandma. I'm using cube steak since the breakfast steaks were sold out.

I love this recipe and I make it all the time! I usually make fried potatoes to serve it with, and make a gravy from the leftover sauce. Yum!

This was a great recipe!  Decided to have a little October Fest at home with a few friends.  Turned out great.
