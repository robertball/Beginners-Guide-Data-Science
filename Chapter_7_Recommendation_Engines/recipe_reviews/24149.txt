The entire family LOVES these.  Recipe is wrong.  Do *not* sift the 1/2 cup sugar in with the dry ingredients.  Make sure it gets left out to cream with the shortening.  These are moist and delicious and YUMMMMMMMY!

Instead of shortening, I used butter. I also used whole wheat white flour and buttermilk. When dropping them into the mini muffin tins, I used my small cookie scoop not only to make uniform sized muffins but it was just easier to make just the right amount for each muffin cup. I also used butter for the "dip" part, too. My family basically had these gone in a matter of seconds. Next time, I'll double the recipe and I think I'll add a little more spice when I make it and maybe some vanilla or maple flavoring to the "puff" part. NOTE: When you make these, be sure to watch them carefully as you reach the end of baking time. Mine were a bit overdone.

something's off with the sugar - recipe calls for 1/2c sugar which in step 2 is supposed to be added to the flour;  and then you're supposed to cream sugar and shortening together. but you've already put the sugar into the flour -- so i dont know where the error is

These definitely are delicious, slightly sweet, bite-sized treats! You might be tempted as I was to nibble on them on all day...! My husband just loved these with a nice cup of coffee. I used butter instead of shortening and I happen to like spices so I used 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg in these plus 1/2 tsp. of vanilla. The end result is a very light, moist, irresistable little treat that's easy to make!

Apsolutely deliciuos, they are so light and also light in cals.  If you don't have nutmeg just put cinoman in it is just as good, i also made it as a cake as my friend did not have a muffin tin, just cook a little longer about 20-25 mins.

My grandma used to make these when I was a little girl and they are still a favorite of mine after all these years. She would bake them in a cast iron muffin tin shaped like bears and then dip the whole muffin in butter and roll in the cinnamon and sugar mixture. I make them the same way, except I add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter for additional flavor. Love these and the memories that come with them!

I can see if left as is these would be bland.  I made the recipe as is, except I did not have shoretning, I subed oil.  ok folks.. make these as mini muffins and dip the whole muffin in the butter and roll in cin/sugar mix.  You have a great treat.  As a large muffin you are going to get bland, there is not enough spice in the batter to make these tasty.  It kinda reminds you of a donut hole with cin/sugar.

Great recipe, suggest using mini-muffin tins to maximize the cinnamon-sugar surface area to mass ratio.  :)

For those that think the recipe is wrong,it's not. You cream the 1/2 cup sugar with the shortening. Salt goes in with the flour. The other half cup sugar is mixed with the cinnamon to top the puffs.

These are pretty good, the only problem is, the top tastes so good you eat it first and then are left w/ the plain ol' muffin.  :(  But thanks for sharing this quick easy recipe!

I added butter instead of shortening, added 2 tsp. vanilla and 1 C. fresh blueberries. Left every thing else the same. The best ever. Thanks for sharing.

This is a really good recipe, what I did was cut them in half and made more cinnamon sugar and melted more butter. Dipped it in butter cut side first then sugar.

These were delicious!  I made them for a Sunday brunch, and they turned out beautifully.  Light and airy....like a lighter textured muffin.  Everyone had lots of compliments!

Have loved these since childhood.  Thanks for posting this!  To reduce glycemic impact a bit, I used 1/4 C Splenda and 1/4 C agave syrup in muffins, and reduced milk slightly to compensate for the extra liquid.  I also doubled the nutmeg (by accident, but it turned out well. I will do this again.)  Consider turning down heat to 300 in last 10 minutes because agave browns quickly.  Agave syrup makes the muffins wonderfully delicate and golden inside, and moister than the Splenda by itself.   For cinnamon/sugar topping, we always use a Tablespoon of the cinnamon instead of a teaspoon.  Highly recommend McCormick's Saigon Cinnamon.  I used another sweetener blend, this time half  regular sugar and half stevia-based granulated sweetener, to mix with the cinnamon.  Very happy with results.  Next time I will try 1/3 cup whole wheat flour and 2/3 white flour to see how that goes.

Just made these this morning...yummy! They are definitely dense but my kids loved them and they were easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except: I added vanilla to the sugar and shortening before mixing it in with the dry ingredients. And we used our cake pop pan...we had perfect little donut holes! So easy to butter and sugar the entire ball. I put the kids in charge of that part! They had a "ball"!

I've made these twice over the last week, they were THAT much of a hit. Both times, I omitted the baking powder (I'm out!) and used 1 teaspoon of baking soda and replaced the milk with buttermilk (1/2 tablespoon vinegar w/ 1/2 cup milk). This is a really great substitution! I also used butter instead of shortening the first time, and the second time I used half butter and half canola oil -- I did not notice a difference in the final product. My kids absolutely LOVE these; doubling the recipe is a MUST!

These made 15 cinnamon puffs and they were gone before they were all dipped and rolled...Have to make more...It took a complete stick of butter, not just the 6 Tablespoons, as stated...of course, I did not put them in papers, but greased the muffin tins well enough to get the puffs to 'fall' out...I dipped the whole puff in butter and rolled it in the cinnamon/sugar mixture...that's the way to do it!  Fabulous!  Fabulous!

Yummy! My Mom used to make these. If you're substituting margarine for the shortening, (like me) be sure to cut the salt, or omit it altogether. Thanks for the great recipe!

the editors must have fixed any errors in the recipe; it turned out perfectly.

I did read the comments re. how great the tops are, and I came up with a solution:  1) I mixed the cinnamon sugar in a large plastic bag, 2) I left the puffs in the pan, 3) I brushed three at a time with melted butter, and then 4) I put those three in the bag with the cinnamon sugar & rolled them around to coat the whole puff.  Repeat with the rest, three at a time.

Oh these are so good.  If you do not like nutmeg suggest you add some vanilla.   Also, I use half butter rather than all shortening and it gives a richer flavor. Thanks for something simple and good........

I made this recipe exactly as described except I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix. I made these instead of making french toast for breakfast and it was so much easier. I baked these in aluminum foil cupcake holders. When they came out of the oven, I poked holes throughout the muffins and instead of dipping the tops, I drizzled the topping over each puff with a spoon so the topping seeped into the muffin as well. They came out absolutely fabulous! I served them with agave syrup and also a apricot jam/cream cheese spread. Great recipe!

These are delicious!!!!!!!!! Sometimes I use buttermilk in place of the milk. Oh, and most French puffs are covered in the cinnamon sugar; not just the tops. So I roll them around in the melted butter then cover the whole muffin in the cinnamon sugar mixture. So yummy. :o)

These are great as is, no changes needed if you want a French Breakfast Puffs.  These are not supposed to be over-sweet - the contrast of salty and sweet is wonderful and a great recipe for breakfast.  Serve with coffee. yum!

This recipe is outstanding!!!! Thank you for posting it. I loved these muffins so much that I had to write a review. That says it all because I never write comments or rate recipes. This is one of my favorite recipe on this website... Simple, all ready have ingredients. 
I followed the recipe except added at touch more nutmeg and used a mini muffing pan. Also I used half shortening and half margarine. Roll the entire muffin in margarine and coat with sugar/cinnamon and then followed up with another dip in the butter with more cin/sugar mix. The second dip and coating made a BIG impact. You got to do it! I finished the last one up at 11:30 pm and made a cup of coffee to go with it. This recipe is a keeper and will be used in my Family Cook book(a collection of recipes my kids love to eat and make). I can hardly wait to see what they think of these yummy breakfast treats. This will be a great change up from cereal and bagels. 
Don't just save this recipe......MAKE IT. You will be pleased!

I liked these...ALOT! This is a very consistant recipe..I have made these twice and both times they turned out the same-DELICIOUS!
I made these in regular muffin tins (I didn't have a mini muffin tin) and they filled 12 about half way. I used wheat flour instead of white, butter instead of shortening. I used Muscavado sugar (a whole form of sugar) instead of white and I added cinnamon. These were light and my husband and I both loved them. I had been jonesing for donuts and this is a cross between a sugar-cinnamon cake donut and coffee cake-Awesome recipe!!!Thanks

These were delicious, like cinnamon-sugar donuts in muffin form! I did spice up the batter, I was worried it would be too bland - I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla, and for the nutmeg I used freshly grated nutmeg and didn't measure how much I put in, but it was probably about 1/2 tsp. I also subbed butter for the shortening. It smelled delicious coming out of the oven; I baked for 25 mins, which gave a nice all-around crust but left the inside with a nice crumb. Then I dipped the top in butter but rolled the whole muffin in the cinnamon/sugar mix; it stuck all over the muffin even without the butter. The topping amounts given are way too much for 12 regular size muffins; I would cut them in half (3 Tbs melted butter, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 tsp cinnamon). It was very sweet, like a donut; best for when you're having people over so you don't eat them all yourself!

These are very tasty even without rolling the entire muffin in the melted butter and cinnamon/sugar. And I read the reviews that had some confusion about where the sugar goes. The recipe is very clear about creaming the sugar and shortening together, not adding the sugar with the flour! And the second bit of sugar is mixed with cinnamon for the topping...I'm guessing either the recipe has changed or was not read very carefully at all!

Great recipe. As I read from other reviews the best is using the mini muffin pans and almost making what we call in Canada Timbits but in the States Donut holes.  So very very good!  Also I use icing sugar instead of regular white sugar! YUMMmmmm

These were yummy. I made 24 mini-muffins and ate about six of them before they made the plate. I will try some add-ins, like banana or strawberry next. Thanks for bringing it!

Made in mini muffin tin, make sure you incorporate all the sugar in the dough as others have said.  Try with powder sugar glaze for a doughnut hole effect.

Make no mistake, this is really just a muffin. There is a mistake with the sugar, yes you should cream it with the shortening and skip sifting it with the flour. It was a nice breakfast muffin. I had homemade apple butter and jelly to pair it with, that was a perfect combination. These muffins remind me of Snickerdoodles. They make a nice treat in the morning.

We made these in home-ec when I was 16 and I made them at home for my family several times and then misplaced the recipe.  I am now 32 and am soooooo glad I found this recipe again, I can't wait to make them for my children.

I thought they were ok, but need some vanilla and a bit more sugar in the batter. Going to make them with my changes and let you know how they are.

I have been making French Breakfast Puffs for many years. However, I would never use shortening -I use butter instead, and more recently tried using coconut oil and they came out great!.  I wouldn't use the margarine either.  I am a biology professor and I tell my students that I call margarine "tubs of death".  So I suggest using butter or coconut oil instead of the shortening and butter for "dipping" in the cinnamon-sugar mixture..

The topping adds just the right touch.  The puffs are a nice consistency and definitely taste better warm.  However, I'm using them for a church function.  They are still ok at room temp.  They are not too heavy!  Just what I was looking for as a quick AM snack to share at fellowship.

Tasty but not light and "puffy" as I expected. I made the recipe as directed except that I only used half of the amounts of butter, sugar, and cinnamon for the topping- and still had a little left over. These have the texture of a biscuit and MUST be eaten warm or they pose a choking hazard! Great with coffee.

I was't really a fan of these. I found they tasted too much like biscuits but maybe that was the point being as it's a "breakfast" pastry. People still ate them but I wasn't too excited about them.

My family and friends loved these morsels!  Yes they taste a bit like a snicker doodle, excellent!  We loved the bit more dense more texture, not quite a biscuit.  Followed the advice of other reviewers by brushing the tops of warm muffins with butter and sprinkling on cinnamon sugar.  That worked great and tasted great too.  We also added frozen blueberries to a batch.  Obviously extending the baking time since they are frozen, but it was a delicious add.  We backed them as mini muffins in the oven and in my daughter's Babycakes electric muffin maker.  Loved the baby cakes outcome, it was a fatter muffin with a crispy top of the muffin as the top gets baked too when the top is in place.  Would use Babycakes again.  All in all, this recipe is a total keeper!

I made these the other day for my kids and they loved them! I did make them into mini muffins and added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the batter! Man, if I wasn't on a diet I'd probably eat them all up! I'm sure they'd probably taste great with blueberries mixed into the batter too!

I have made these French Breakfast Puffs since I was in high school in the early 70's. They are excellent! It's one of my standard favorite recipes. I always sift the flour before combining it with the other ingredients. I tried this recipe once without doing that and they just didn't taste the same.

These were excellent. Substituted butter for shortening and margarine. Did regular size muffins, but I agree that mini would be better (I was too impatient for small batches).

These taste just like donuts, so I turn them into baked donuts by baking them in a donut pan (I have both regular and mini size pans). I do some with cinnamon and sugar, some with confectioner's sugar, and some glazed, so people can chose their favorites.

My mother makes something similar to this and was looking for her recipe at an odd hour.  The puffs are rather hard and chewy, not light and fluffy like I've had before.  It's a good idea, but the recipe needs some tweeking to address the texture.

These are fantastic.  They are very simple to make and very straightforward: a cinnamon-sugar muffin, no frills attached.  I've made them a few times as regular muffins, but today I made them in mini muffin tins and they were almost like cinnamon donut holes.  I brought 36 of them to a get-together with some friends and brought none home.  Everyone raved about them.  The only change I made was to add a bit of cinnamon to the batter itself.

This recipe is REALLY delicious! its so good my family wanted more! I actually just mixed the egg milk and shortening together and every thing else in a separate bowl and when I dipped it in the butter I covered the whole thing in butter, and covered it with the sugar and cinnamon mixture and it was covered in cinnamon sugarness! That made it even better!

These were to die for. Very easy to make even if your a novice. I gave them an extra 5 minutes in the oven (total bake time 30 minutes).

These were pretty yummy.  I agree with other reviewers that when I think of puff, I think of a pastry, so the taste is unexpected - just like a cake donut. Next time, I'll try to switch the shortening to butter. Thanks for sharing

these were super good! the name is slightly misleading when i hear puffs i think of pastries.  these are muffins, but SO good. i did add about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter but other than that i stuck to the recipe. so easy. quick. perfect for a special breakfast! i will make these a regular recipe.

My sister had a recipe for these, but called them donut muffins.  They were good.  You really need to make sure you put enough butter and cinnamon on it.  If there isn't enough, it doesn't taste as good.

These were good and the family complimented them.  They are more like coffee cake and might benefit (although not necessary by any means) from a steusel like something folded in a bit and then pour into muffin pan.

These were a hit with my husband.  Instead of making them in muffin pans, I used a muffin top pan.  It was perfect with the sugar/cinnamon topping.  Baked them for about 12 minutes instead. I'll make these again!

I remember my mother making these when I was little, and now I make them for my family. I rated it 4 stars because the first time I made it, they came out really dense, but the next time I used about 1/4-1/2 cup more milk, and they were perfect!

My two little kids and I really liked these.  The only change I made was to use pumpkin pie spice in the muffin (which tastes similar to a doughnut!!) and a little with the cinnamon sugar blend.  We also tried the puffs without anything on the outside and still thought they were good.  Next time I will try them without the cinnamon/sugar and will instead put a powdered sugar glaze on top.  I will definitely make these again!

I think these would have been good if the topping was a different recipe.  And the actual muffin part of the recipe were more flavorful.  All you can taste is the sugar, there is absolutely nothing else that is flavorful and/or yummy.

These were actually pretty good.  A bit denser than I was hoping for.  I made these for my bf only to find out that the only spice he had was pumpkin pie spice...  Actually turned out really good in place of the nutmeg.  Also used butter in place of shortening and 1 T less milk (again, bf didn't have any). There was way too much of the cinnamon/sugar/butter topping.  I only used MAYBE half.  A lot of waste.

I love these muffins! I  substituted butter for the shortening and they are still amazing. I also sprayed cooking spray on the bottom of 2 mini muffin tins and baked up 2 dozen mini muffins (reduced the baking time to about 10 minutes, or until done). They are just like mini donuts at the fair - minus the high-fat frying! I remember my mom baking these when I was a kid and this recipe brings back memories.

This is an excellent Betty Crocker recipe that I have been making since my daughter was born 41 years ago!  NORTHWESTMOM said the directions were wrong, but she needs to read again.  It specifically states to whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg, and THEN cream the sugar and shortening together.  This is a no fail recipe!

VERY good muffins! I overlooked the glitch in the instructions, I suppose it could happen to anyone. The only change I made was to add vanilla to the batter, I add it to anything I bake. These came out nice and tender, and very tasty!

I've made this recipe several times since discovering it!  I followed the advice of other reviewers to skip the butter bath and just sprinkle cinnamon over the tops before baking. I also double the amount of nutmeg because I enjoy that flavor.

The recipe is quick and easy.  The ingredients are always on hand.  They make a great Sunday breakfast with a bit of jam or apple butter.  This recipe has a permanent place on my "regulars" list!

These were pretty tasty and very easy to make. I personally thought they tasted better after they were cooled; when warm the muffin itself did not have much flavor, all you could taste was the topping. Made a nice breakfast even though I baked them the night before.

I thought these were just ok. I even used fresh-grated nutmeg. I thought perhaps they could have baked a slightly shorter time, but I followed directions and my oven is very true. Perhaps blueberries would have kept them moister?

Family loved it; ate almost all of them in a day.   Quite a feat,  as there are only three of us and one of them is only 3.  Hubs said they tasted like donuts and that got our daughter, who likes donuts,  interested. I'll have to make them again as they were easy and a hit.  As others have noted,  the second 1/2 cup of sugar listed is for the cinnamon sugar topping.

You know, these were good as is but I have seen a few revisions in other recipes for this and when I make this again, I will drop a dab of softened cream cheese and raspberry jam inside before I top with the rest of the batter.  I also dipped the entire muffin in butter and then the sugar mix; however, to me they tasted a little salty.  Next time I would dip in unsalted melted butter instead of salted.  My hubby said they were "nothing special" and I felt a little disappointed, but then I split one, warmed it up, spread butter and strawberry jam on it and he said "really good!"  - so you may want to try this, too!

All I can say is WOW! Soooo good. It's like sticking a flavorful and fluffy cloud in your mouth. I used vegetable spread instead of shortening and allspice seasoning instead of nutmeg since that's all that I had on hand and they still came out excellent. Some reviewers commented on the steps in the actual recipe being incorrect, but it looks like they have been updated since then. Also, sí double dipped the muffins in the butter a second time and that gave it a very nice glaze before sprinkling more sugar on them. Of course, I only did this because I LOVE sugar; however, if you just follow the procedures step-by-step and you can't go wrong!

Quite good!  I used butter instead of shortening, and, because I used paper cups, I brushed with melted butter instead of dipping, then sprinkled liberally.

I love the texture of these little muffins.  I didn't leave them in the oven for the entire bake time listed, only for about 17 minutes and they were completely done. Otherwise, I made them according to the recipe. Next time, though, I might add another 1/4 cup of sugar, vanilla extract and cinnamon. This is the exact texture that I've been looking for to make a nice white cake. When making the cake, I'll leave out the spices.... or not :)

This recipe is perfect!!  I followed directions to the T, except  I only used about 1-1/2 tablespoons of melted butter to coat the top and sides, and it worked out perfectly.  Also, I had a container of cinammon sugar already mixed that I had purchased in the supermarket, so I didn't have to create my own mixture.  I was searching for French Breakfast Puffs because I tasted them in a neighborhood specialty bakery and I loved them.  The bakery has since gone out of business :(  I made these for the second time today.  Came out perfect each time and they taste just like the bakery version except the bakery ones were just slightly more dense; these are a slight bit fluffier;  the bakery puffs were about 1-1/2 times the size of these.  I'm assuming they were denser in the bakery since they were larger, so they may not have gotten done as well.  BOTH are delicious.  Today was the second time I made this recipe and I will be making them MANY more times! Thanks to Betsy for sharing this recipe!!!

Recipe is correct as written. There should be a half cup of sugar in the muffins and the other half with the cinnamon to coat the muffin.

My husband inhaled them! They were delicious but the only reason why I gave a 4 instead of 5 star was because I was expecting a much lighter and puffier muffin. It was my first time baking muffins and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out ^_^ Ps: I substituted the nutmeg and cinnamon for cocoa (hubby's request)

Delicious recipe! Moist, fluffy, and sweet! I would definitely make these again, it was fast and easy--however, I found this recipe only made 9 muffins in my normal-sized muffin tin. I was fine with that, though! Very yummy!

Made these muffins for breakfast this morning. They are  perfect! Love the subtle nutmeg flavor and that they are not overly sweet.  Have already shared this recipe with my cousin, and will be making these often from now on.

When a food is called a "puff" I expect them to be light and airy. These taste fine, but are too dense and bready for what I expected.

These are addicting( in a weird way) The muffin itself is pretty bland... I used salted butter instead of shortening, and added a big splash of Vanilla. Even though these basically didn't taste like much..i still found them to be good..maybe it was the topping(added a sprinkle of nutmeg to it as well),maybe it was the warm butter that oozed in, or maybe it was the fact that there were warm, soft and fluffy!

My family loved these! The error with the sugar must have been corrected because I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly. They are like a snickerdoodle muffin.  Watch the time, though - I did take mine out a little earlier.

this  was an amazing recipe, but if i were to make it again i would put less nutmeg in and i experimented and put cinnamon in and it taste way better , also if you want it to be more moist i suggest slicing apples and mixing it in with it. Overall it was very good

Insure to scoop evenly to make 12 muffins, I didn't and eating the larger muffins needed milk to wash down as they can be dry.  I'll add more spice in the next batch but a great first start.

i made these this morning. Instead of shortening, I added 1/4 melted butter to the egg and milk mixture, stirred that together then added to dry ingredients. the sugar should be mixed in with the dry ingredients. I think they are delicious!

Yum!!!! I love cinnamon, so I used that instead of nutmeg. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, and added a handful of chocolate chips to half a batch. These are definitely one of my favourites.

Loved the recipe! I used mini muffin pans and it worked perfectly! Only thing is that it only took mine about 13mins to get light brown. Also I added a bit more cinnamon in my sugar mix that went on them, but that's just me!

Yummy! I just made these and thank goodness I followed the advice of another review that said it bakes in less time so, watch them. They were very ready at 15mins. I rolled the entire muffin in the topping mixture which I doubled. I also added vanilla to my batter. The kids and hubby went crazy for these. Will be making these a lot.

I made this, this morning. I added a few ingredients because I read the reviews and they said it was a bit bland.
It was delicious!!  My family and I loved it!!

Made these for my 2 1/2-year old nephew.  He approves, and so do the rest of us!  The small amount of nutmeg gives them a different, but really good, sweetness.

Bland. Not as light and fluffy as I would have thought they would be. The only real bright spot of these muffins, and this could be done with ANY muffins, is the dipping the tops in butter and sugar/cinnamon at the very end.

I expected these to be fluffy but instead they were quite dense. I did not add sugar to flour mix, the recipe is unclear and the result was bland...maybe I should have? Also, only made 10 muffins and were still dry at 20 mins. Good idea but didn't work for me as is.

This is very  similar to a recipe that I used over thirty years ago. I did not use the nutmeg and often added chopped pecans or blueberries. It was a family favortie and I lost the recipe.  Mine were called Pecan Puffs. I am sure it is the same basic recipe. Thank you so much!

I didn't like this recipe at all; thought it was bland and the muffins were heavy.  The recipe for French Puff Muffins from Williams-Sonoma Muffin cookbook are made with buttermilk and must lighter.

Very tasty & so quick to make, though they are muffins, not puffs!  The only change I would make is to reduce salt from ½ to ? tspn.  I'm not sure if this will effect leavening (the baking powder should be enough). Like many, I cook & bake to control salt for my low-sodium diet!

I haven't actually made THIS recipe - but the one I make with the same name is SO close to this and I wanted to link my picture up with a recipe! ;D The ONLY difference is that my recipe calls for butter instead of margarine, and it makes more so some of the measurements are different, but all ingredients are the same. These are the BOMB and everyone in my house will tell you the same. My son screamed like a girl when he found out I was making these this morning! So good....

I add a cream cheese drizzle to the top and they taste like a cinnamon roll muffin. Moist and delicious every time. Oh, I also add cinnamon to the batter.

This was a great breakfast for my kiddos and me.  We have a 45 minute drive to church on Sundays and this is going to be great for the drive.  I baked them a bit long and might try adding more milk next time.  My kids loved them!!  We had them with fruit and yogurt smoothies.

These were not too bad.  They are a little plain but taste okay with hot cocoa or maybe tea.  I used the butter spray for one batch and regular butter for the other.  The ones with spray didnt taste as good and all I could taste was the spray.  Butter is the way to go when you grease the pan. I also used the mini muffin pan, that was a good idea.  I added a little cinnamon to the flour mix and used butter instead of shortening, the taste was good. The sugar topping was not a bad idea but I suppose icing would be good too, like sweet cinnomon rolls. Thanks for the recipe.

These turned out awesome. I used butter flavor shortening. I also added a 1/2 tsp of allspice to the flour mixture after I read some reviews saying the tops were the best part. Mine were sweet top to bottom and gone in minutes. I will double the recipe next time.

I made these muffins for my boyfriend and his grandparents as a little breakfast treat. They were very successful. Most muffin batters I've tried sometimes come out bland, but these had a teriffic taste, expecially with the nutmeg. I can definitely see myself making these more often as a breakfast snack. I do think they are better off as mini muffins. This type of treat has much more appeal when bite-sized. Overall, this recipe was a delight-and quite easy too!

Easy to make, turned out great the first time. In addition to the sugar / cinnamon dip, we also melted some butter and semi-sweet chocolate chips and dipped the tops of some of the puffs in that instead of the other dip. They were very good also!

The outcome is great but the instructions are hard to follow, and there is a lot of hard cleanup at the end because of all the butter.

These are much better if you dip the whole muffin in the butter and the sugar mixture. I also use a little less cinnamon so they aren't bitter when cold.

This was great, I agree with the sugar issue, but I would only add: when you use a metal mini muffin sheet, put shortening on the bottom and sides of each mini muffin section and then put some mixed cinn. and sugar along the bottom and sides, then put the batter in. After you cook them just lightly nife the sides and prop them out. YUMMM!

The puffs came out very moist but I would recommend adding cinnamin to the dough before baking as it was a little plain and then you had the top covered in the cin/sugar. Will try again this way

I thought these tasted pretty good.  They would be even better as mini muffins.  Tasted like baked cinnamon sugar donuts. I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to flour mixture. I added 1/2 tbsp vanilla extract to milk.  I also used butter in place of shortening.  They came out just like the picture.   This recipe would be really good with small bits of cooked apples.  Fun recipe for the kids to share at school.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked the puff but not so much the grainy sugar on top of it.  SO i was trying to figure out something i could do instead of the sugar and the hubby suggested a cream cheese frosting.

these are fantastic. they are light and fluffy and sweet but not too sweet. really great breakfast snack. I agree with the other people that you don't need that much butter for the topping unless you are coating the whole muffin and not just the top. I used about a tablespoon of butter and it coated 6 tops. (I halved the recipe because my fiance won't eat muffins) I have a coworker who doesn't like chocolate so for her birthday I might turn this into a cake like one reviewer said she did. I think that it would work out wonderfully.

These were good, not Great but good.  They would be pretty bland without the topping helping them along but did enjoy the bit of nutmeg in the muffin.  I may make these again because they were simple but I will tweek the recipe a bit to try to make them Great!

Quick and easy like it says. A little crumbly and needed to cool off alot more before adding sugar and cinnamon. The kids enjoyed them for breakfast and will make again, perhaps I'll add one more egg to make it a little more dense. Great recipe!

This was a good recipe. There was nothing wring with it at all. It wasn't exactly amazing and exciting but it was tasty and easy to prepare.

I used cinnamon instead of nut meg, and instead of putting it in muffin tins I just put it in a square dish. When it was done I served it was strawberry topping. It was really tasty like that. :)

GREAT muffins and a delicious way to start off the day. One thing to note - 6 tbsp was, for me, WAY too much butter. After I had dipped all 12 muffins, there was a LOT of leftover butter. One thing I did was use 5 tbsp of melted butter with 1 tbsp of maple syrup, just because I love maple with cinnamon! Yum!

Wow - Not good.  My 15 year old son had a freind stay the night.  I made this and several other recipies for breakfast.  The kids tried to make it better by using maple syrup, but even that didn't help.  The recipe is hard to follow as other reviewers have stated, but overall they are just too dry.  Also none of us like the taste of shortening, but I believe in staying true to the recipie so I prepared it exactly.  If you choose to make thise, I would use Crisco sticks instead of the shortening, and a bit more milk may be a good idea.

I had to give these 4 stars because of the mishap in the instructions. You definitely don't need to mix the sugar in with the flour. Other than that these were very good. Like others, I didn't dip the muffins in the cinnamon sugar but I sprinkled it on the top before baking them. I didn't have any nutmeg but added a little cinnamon into the batter. Great recipe!

These were good, but i think that next time i make them i will take half of the cinnamon sugar (since you dont use all of it anyway) and swirl it in the batter after it is put in the muffin tin, to make a cinnamon swirl on the inside of the muffin, but all in all the texture was light and velvety - great recipe

This is a nice base dough and I think I'll be able to come up with some tasty variations, rather than cinnamon and sugar.
