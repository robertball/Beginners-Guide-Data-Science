Very good! Just be more careful than me and be sure to use cream of coconut and NOT coconut cream. I didn't realize there was a difference when I first made this.  :)

I made a blender full using the same ingredients by adjusting the amounts.  I used a small can of crushed pineapple.  Was delish...made enough for 4 with about 6 ozs remaining!   I also probably used coconut rum, as well.  Easy to adjust to individual tastes.  Yes, I will make again!

They were delicious & refreshing after a hot afternoon at the pool. I will definitely make these again. They were very simple to make.

I will make again, yes.
Recently had at sister's house poolside in Florida. Delightful.
She only uses 3 ingredients: Rum (both colors) Pineapple/fresh cut. (can reserve some for garnish)
and Cream of Coconut. Not sure grocers carry it, but found mine at Binny's.
Did not find any blender size proportions so I "winged it."
They were tasty: to do a whole blenderful: 3oz white, 3 oz dark : 3 T of cream of coconut.  Several chunks of pineapple. Throw in some ice and you got some pretty tasty drinks a la summer.

We went to multiple stores looking for cream of coconut. Couldn't find it anywhere!  The store staff never heard of cream of coconut, and kept directing me to coconut cream... I used a can of coconut meat, it was very tasty. Yet I should have strained it.  The coconut meat was quite expensive also. Because of the price of the coconut meat I gave it less stars, I feel if I had found the proper coconut needed this would have been a perfect drink.

Was so much better when I doubled the coconut and the pineapple, but then we like it sweeter. Either way, turned out well

I used pineapple in it's own juice.  I added a little sugar to make it sweeter.  I also added a little more cr√®me of coconut.  This made up for the overpowering rum taste (I am a lightweight regarding alcohol).  I achieved a well-balanced and well-blended drink.  I will be making this throughout the summer!!!
