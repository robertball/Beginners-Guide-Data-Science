I had a box of Orecchiette pasta (little ears) and was looking for some ideas when I happily found this recipe!  I could not find Fava beans so I used Lima beans, the prep was easy and everything came together quickly.  The pasta salad is delicious and refreshing, each piece of pasta holds a delightful bite of the beans.  We will be serving grilled shrimp over it next time around.  Thanks for the terrific recipe Cathy!
