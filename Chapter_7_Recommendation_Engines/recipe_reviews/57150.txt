I had to get somewhat creative b/c i only had reg. flour on hand. So i used 1 cup flour, 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt = 1 cup self-rising flour. The beer of choice tonight was a Budweiser Select and we thought it gave the bread a wonderful flava!  This was a really easy and really tasty recipe for Beer Bread Mix!  Thanks!

I have been searching for the perfect beer bread recipe and this hits the nail on the head! I left out the onion powder and the italian seasoning and increased the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and it tastes IDENTICAL to The tastefully simple stuff at a fraction of the cost! (I made several loaves with other recipes to get it to taste the same as the good box stuff and this is it!) I also made Jalapeno cheddar bread from it. When I add savory seasonings I use the amount of brown sugar posted in this recipe. If I am making plain bread I use the 1/3 cup! This is the best. It is different than using just self rising flour. I tried that as others have posted and it really is not the same texture. Go with this and you will never spend $5-6 a box again! Thanks for this recipe!

This is a really good beer bread recipe.  Because of the recommendation from the previous reviewer I simply used 3 cups of self rising flour.  My bread texture was perfect.  The recipes I have seen previously call for 3 c of flour and 3 T of sugar.  The extra tablespoon of sugar makes the bread a little sweeter.  Also the brown sugar gives it a beautiful dark color.  I switched the Italian seasoning for a creole spice because I thought it would blend better with the meat I was making.  The recipe was as simple to follow as any beer bread and I will use it again.  The only real warning I will give is make sure you use a high quality beer.  I used a Honey Lager and it had great flavor. Cooking with beer is like cooking with wine, if you wouldn't drink it, don't cook with it.

My previous review was that this recipe had too much baking powder. I have since made it several times trying different measurements.  The bottom line is DON'T ADD ANY baking powder.  Self-rising flour already has baking powder in it, and it is sufficient for this recipe. I also don't add any  Italian or onion spices, it is more versatile without - it's also very good for breakfast this way.

Delicious! This was a definite winner for snacking during Sunday's football game! I used 3 cups of self rising four instead of adding the 1/2 sup of flour, baking powder and salt. I left everything else the same. It's so good and the melted butter over top gives it such a nice crunch! The best part is it's so inexpensive to make. I cut it up into small chunks and served this with "Beer Cheese Dip II" from this site.

Best beer bread I've ever made. More herbs wouldn't hurt the next time but the texture was much better than usual. It wasn't crumbly and dry like most BB's (probably because of the melted butter. The recipe opens up possiblities such as adding shredded cheddar and sun dried tomatoes to the batter or elimating the herbs altogether and throwing in dried cranberries, mixed chopped dried fruits or dates. Would be great toasted. The herb version would make an easy appetizer cut in squares and toasted then topped w. creamed cheese and Jalapeno jelly or whatever. thanks for the recipe, will make it often

I made 6 loaves of bread, we are not beer drinkers. I had to buy a 6 pack, so felt it gave me an opportunity to try it 6 ways. I first made the mix in quart zip lock bags to take to a bake-a-thon at my sister's house. When I got there, I had the bags marked, some had seasonings, both the onion and italian seasonings, some were white or wheat. They all tasted very good. The wheat seemed to make a heartier bread. There was nothing I would change or disliked about any of the variations. I would like to tell you, always make sure your self rising flour is fresh! The leavening added to it will not work as well as you would expect if it is old. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was wonderful and easy easy easy!!!  I didn't have self rising flour so I followed the suggestions by bv (thanks!).  I have never made bread like this before.  We loved it with chili and can't wait to make it again!!  I didn't have regular onion powder si I used Mrs Dash Onion Meadly and Tomato Basil Garlic instead of italian seasoning.  Thanks so much.

Thank you so much for this recipe!! I actually left out all of the herbs. One of my local favorite steak places serves Shiner Bock beer bread with honey butter that is to die for. By leaving out all of the herbs and using Shiner as my beer I managed to get pretty darn close to theirs! Thanks again it was awesome!!

I made this without the seasonings with the intent to use the leftovers for toast.  Of course, we never had the chance!  I made the rest of the recipe just as directed and it was very easy and turned out good.  I've never had any type of beer bread before so I don't know about the density etc. but I found it to be a teeny bit on the doughy side but that could have been because I baked it in a clay bowl.  It's absolutely delicious and on the sweet side.  I will definately make it again.

We LOVE this bread.  I use 3 C. all purpose flour, 1 Tbs. + 1.5 tsp. baking powder, 1 Tbs. kosher salt (and NO additional salt) in place of Self-Rising flour.  We skip the Italian Seasonings, I use whatever beer we have on hand (even light beer works great) and bake at 375 convection for 40 minutes.  It's a 1 bowl wonder!

Holy cow, this bread is wonderful!!  The crust is amazingly crunchy and buttery.  I didn't have self-rising flour so I subbed it with AP flour mixed with 1/8 t. salt and 1 1/4 t. baking powder per cup.

What an easy treat (and tasty way to use stale/cheap beer)!  I didn't have any self-rising flour, so I added 4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 1/2 teaspoon salt to the 3 cups of flour.  I baked the bread for 55 minutes and the crust came out crusty with a slightly doughy inside, which is the way I prefer.  I used a seasonal cherry beer which added a perfect flavor boost.  Will definitely make again.    *****EDIT!  I have made this MANY times now with different kinds of beer and different combinations of flour.  The best flour combination BY FAR is to use 1 cup of wheat flour and 2 cups of all-purpose flour with the baking powder and salt additions noted earlier.  The crust is exceptional.  This is a regular recipe used in our household.

This was really good! I made it for gifts for Christmas with Friendship Soup Mix and Italian Dressing Mix (both from this site).  I tried the bread the other day.  It is really good, and has a nice yeasty flavor from the beer.  It's kind of a mix between bread and biscuit texture.  My only complaint is the bread rose over the pan and the butter spilled over the bottom of the oven.  What a mess!  It was also a little doughy in the middle even though the toothpick was clean and I let it rest for a good 15 min.  Not sure if it's user error.  I put it in the fridge and then warmed up the leftovers and they were good. UPDATE: 3/2/11 I made these last weekend in muffin tins. Man, were they good! I greased the muffin tin really well then plopped the bread in (about 3/4 full) then I brushed with butter. They were very tasty and I liked the crisp texture of the sides and top. I highly recommend trying in a muffin tin.  The recipe made one full regular 12-muffin tin perfectly.

This is a great recipe! I used a top quality kona coffee porter (a nice dark beer), and it turned out wonderfully. Like many of the other reviewers, I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used 3 c. flour, 4.5 tsp of baking powder, and 1.5 tsp salt, total. I did not use the spices, because I wanted a bread that would go well with PB. I will definitely make this again!

I used 3 cups of self-rising flour only, and added rosemary and Italian seasoning.  This bread was so easy to make, smelled delicious baking, and tasted wonderful!  This will become a regular in our house!  :-)

**ATTENTION FANS OF TASTEFULLY SIMPLE'S BEER BREAD**  

This recipe is a DELICOUS (and MUCH cheaper) alternative to TS's Beer Bread!  I whipped up a double batch in no time and have to say that this recipes is a KEEPER!  THE BEST PART: It's made with simple staples that nearly everyone has in their kitchen.  

I especially love the idea from other Reviewers of putting all the dry ingredients together in a bag and attaching to a bottle of beer for Christmas gifts.

Deliciously delightful. Being a Tarheel from coastal Carolina, self-rising flour is widely and probably, most popularly used in nearly all baked goods. When I share my recipes, I emphasize the difference in the flours by telling the recipe recipient NOT to use baking powder OR salt if they are using self-rising flour as those ingredients are already present. Now, having said all that, this recipe is wonderful. I've made it as written and it was the hit of a spaghetti dinner.  Without the onion powder and Italian seasoning, it's a whole new ballgame.  It toasts very nicely to go with that morning cup of coffee.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I didn't have self-rising flour so I used three cups of all-purpose and 2 teaspoons of baking powder and the bread turned out great. Instead of using the Italian flavors, I added walnuts and dried cranberries and this loaf was a hit with my  husband and a male friend of ours. They were practically licking up the crumbs! I think this recipe will be very versatile for adding flavor combos. - thinking of garlic/sundried tomato/pinenut next...

Oh my!  I changed the recipe, used 3 cups all purpose flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 Tablespoon + 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt, beer and butter. Wow this is fantastic.  I made another loaf and increased the brown sugar by 1 tablespoon and added cinnamon and granulated sugar on top before adding melted butter.  This is a great base recipe, can't wait to add sundried tomatoes and basil.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is easily adaptable to suit your taste/budget. Here in Norway, buying beer for the bread costs just about as much as a single meal (we are on an extremely tight budget) but i found using apple cider, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 3/4 teaspoon of cinammon makes a great healthier snack type bread. Also, I used two one-liter loaf pans rather than a single large loaf pan so that the bread will last a little longer and found that if the dough is divided in half only 30 minutes of baking time is needed.

My husband loves this bread and is one of my favorites since it's so easy to make!  I opted to not use self-rising flour and it worked great (3 cups flour, 1 Tb plus 1 tsp baking pwdr, 1 tsp salt).  If you do this don't add the original measurements for these 3 ingredients.  Its such a great home-cooked taste that would be perfect with chili, stew, soup, etc.  I'm glad I don't have to buy the box mix now.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Pretty good.  Tastes almost just like a beer bread mix I got from a home-tasting party.  I'm making them for Christmas gifts this week.

Brilliant recipe. Like many people I used 3 cups of plain flour with 4 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. I also used garlic powder instead of onion powder. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect, a definite keeper! I'd never tried beer bread before and wish I'd made it earlier. Thank you for the recipe!!

This was amazing!  We made 40 bags of it to hand out for Christmas and my husband made these great tags for them on Photoshop.  We put the mix in plastic bags and then cellophane bags with Christmas bows, just to make sure they didn't spill while we traveled.  We definitely looked like drug dealers when we were putting them together, but everyone LOVED them.  I took the advice to do 1/3 cup brown sugar and it truly tastes like the Tastefully Simple mix!  Thanks so much for this recipe!  It's already a favorite on both sides of our family!

This turned out a delicious beer bread. I followed TAMMYDACHEF's review and cut out the seasonings, upped the brown sugar and it was very, very similar to the Tastefully Simple mix I love. Not quite the same (will play with the brown sugar amt and baking powder/self-rising flour amounts on future attempts) but close enough so I'll never blow my money on the mix again and have no problems serving this to company. No changes needed to get an amazing, freshly baked, no yeast/kneading required loaf of bread - thanks for sharing!

This bread is so good. I leave out the spices and poke the dough with a knife in several places after pouring the melted butter over the top. I love the nice crunchy top.

I opted to leave out the onion powder and italian seasoning just because I didn't think they would go over very well with the kiddos.  I upped the brown sugar from 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup.  This came out great and went really well with the soup that I made for dinner (broccoli cheese) and I'll be putting this one into my recipe book.

Great base recipe for beer bread.  I make up several batches and keep them in quart size zip lock bags.  When I need to make bread, I have everything all set - just add beer!  I love how the flavor changes depending on the beer you use too.  I have used everything from Bud red to Sam Adams!

I was looking for a cheap knock off for Tastefully Simple beer bread, sadly this was not it, it does not taste like it at all. It was ok as it, but if looking for TS, google knock offs for it, I found a closer recipe that way.

Yum. I can't stop eating this! Very versatile recipe. I substituted 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat, added chopped green olives and fresh rosemary. I used olive oil instead of butter, too. This would be amazing with soup. Next time I will try baking this as rolls in muffin tins. The best part was the crust that almost seemed fried by the olive oil. So good.

This is a very easy and very good recipe.  I left out the Italian Seasoning, but added 1 1/2 cups shredded Sharp Cheddar cheese and a can of diced Chiles (juice and all) and let me tell you... OMG!!  IT IS SOOOO GOOD.  There are so many ways you can make this bread.. Give it a try and see what you can can come up with.!

This is the best beer bread recipe out there!! I followed the recipe to a T- (with no self-rising flour on hand, for everyone 1 cup of all-purpose flour, I added 1 and 1/4 teaspoons baking powder and 1/8 teaspoon salt). I also took others' suggestions and added 1/3 cup brown sugar and eliminated the onion powder and Italian seasoning. SOOO PERFECT!!

This is wonderful! My sister in law is going to love this. I prettied up the jar with squares of pretty cloth under the jar lid and made my own labels. I'm pairing it with a lighter beer, Bud Light, as that's her favorite beer.

This is so good and so easy! It really does taste like the expensive packaged bread we used to make. 
We used a mild beer and added 1/4 C chopped pepperoni and 1/3 C cubed cheese. Along side a nice salad, we had a great dinner! 
I think I'll have to package some in jars for gifts.

My oh my this bread is good!! It's a great savory beer bread. I did not think this bread was very sweet at all even with the amount of brown sugar in it. I'm actually trying to recreate some beer bread that we just recently had in Portland, Oregon at a place called Huber's. Their beer bread was very sweet. So perhaps if I left out the herbs and the onion powder in this recipe and played with the sugar I might come close to theirs. But I did love this bread as is. I made it exactly as the recipe states and used a Red Hook ESB (microbrew) for the beer and it is delicious. I'm making a big pot of chili later today and we're going to eat it with that. Oh and all the butter you pour on top of the bread makes the crust taste soooooo good!!! -Not low fat but I don't tend to bake that way. If I want low fat, I eat a salad.  :-)

I made this first with a beer I didn't care for much, which was a mistake. The taste came through in the bread. I made it again tonight with a beer I like and the flavor was much better. However, it is not an exciting bread if you make it like I did (without the italian seasoning and onion powder). I did up the brown sugar to 1/3 cup. I was hoping to imitate a Budweiser beer bread mix someone gave me for Christmas last year, but this is nowhere near as good.

I have used this recipe for years and years.  It is always a crowd pleaser.  I've also made it with different sodas, even orange soda once when I was desperate!  You can add a handful of cheddar cheese too, which gives it a nice flavor for a beer bread.  It's excellent as written too.

I just baked both a Tastefully Simple loaf and this one.  This one from scratch was bigger and taste identical to it by omitting the onion powder and Italian seasoning and using 1/3 cup brown sugar.  No more Tastefully Simple for me.  Thanks for the recipe ??

This is SO good! I used a homemade conversion for the self-rising flour and omitted the the onion powder and Italian season only because I used Lemon Shandy in place of the beer and I wanted to taste the full flavor of the lemon rather than the herbs. Next time I'll add the herbs but it was AWESOME w/o it. Also want to use hard cider in the future.

This beer bread turned out great! I had no self rising floor, so I used the suggestion for substitution given in other reviews.  I used a bottle of Sam Adams Boston Lager. The bread wasn't bitter like some others I've made. I agree that the amount of butter is excessive, but it leaves the top with a crisp, buttery crust that my kids loved. This recipe Is a keeper.

This is a very dense, moist bread.  I think if I made it again I would omit the Italian seasoning, something about it made it taste slightly bitter.  It also could have been from the very "hoppy" style of beer I used.

This is wonderful! Never having had beer bread before, I wasn't sure what to expect. Followed the recipe except I didn't have any self rising flour. So for every 1 C of self rising flour I used: 1 C of all purpose, 1 & 1/2 tspn of baking powder, and 1/2 a tspn of salt. Used miller high life. Such a wonderful recipe, will share with everyone!

This was really good. Next time I will cut down on the butter though, I thought it was way too much.

This was so quick and easy!  Make sure to use a beer that is not too strong on the "hoppy" flavor (a light beer works best).  This mix is also nice in a gift basket along with the recipe and baking instructions.  Thanks- we will make this again.

HINT:  have your beer at room temp.  Last Christmas I made about a dozen loaves from a similar recipe.  Added cinnamon & sugar to some; dry taco seasoning in the batter, topped with Mex. Cheese in some; Italian seasoning topped w cheese in some.  Used several types of inexpensive beers and couldn't tell the difference.  Gave them to friends & family according to their tastes.  What is better than a gift of homemade bread!

I didn't have self-rising flour so after reading many reviews I used the one that suggested three cups of all-purpose flour, four teaspoons of baking powder and two teaspoons of salt instead. I chose to use a 'Parmesan & Herb Blend' spice mix as it contained onion powder and the makings of an Italian seasoning. The beer of choice was Guinness. The spice blend taste didn't come through, but the beer flavour was overwhelming enough for us to only like this bread straight out of the oven, and the rest was tossed away. Perhaps a lighter beer should be used, but that is not specified in the recipe.

Excellent flavor.  I made it with 3 cups AP flour, 4 tsp. baking powder and 2 tsp salt.  Then added the onion powder and italian seasoning.  I baked it for about 5 extra minutes and it's YUMMMO!!!

This recipe was so incredibly easy and wonderful!  I did leave out the spices and added a bit more brown sugar as someone suggested.  This made it much more of a breakfast bread.  I added the brown sugar last and didn't mix it completely through -- there were pockets of crunchy brown sugar goodness all through the bread!  make this recipe!

This is one of the easiest recipes I have ever made and it is really good.  I used fresh onions, about one quarter cup minced, instead of the onion powder and used just a tablespoon of melted margarine on the top of the batter. We have some leftover beer after a party that my husband and I do not like and this is a good way to use it up

Wonderful! I can't wait to make new flavor combinations!  I followed recipe except for a few minor things. I only put about half the salt, and instead of using Italian seasoning mix, I added ground thyme, sage, and rosemary PLUS crushed rosemary, basil, and oregano.  I did use the onion powder, but added all my seasoning together to get Italian seasoning.  Wonderful, and tasty!

This is a great recipe to base your breads on. I personally leave out the onion powder and Italian seasoning. Because the self-rising flour has salt in it, I added less salt than called for. I think the 1/2 tsp is too much. I make this quite often and it makes a nice hostess gift or welcome gift.

I have used this recipe several times and saved tons of money over "Tastefully Simple" beer bread mixes that I used to use.  It is just as good!  And it freezes well too if you mix extra portions and divide it.

Delicious!  I followed other reviews and substituted 3 c flour, 1 T + 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt for the self-rising flour and omitted the onion and Italian seasoning. I used Rolling Rock Beer which was just right to my taste.   This is a dream recipe. It's every bit as good as the expensive mix I used to buy and so easy. It's eexcellent lightly toasted the next day.

This bread is awesome! The top is like a biscuit and the inside is perfect. (it went well with stroganoff.) So easy to make, I handed the recipe to my husband and had him make it while I made the main dish. Which made for nice bonding time in the kitchen :)
This is a keeper, and I'll make it often!

Absolutely delicious!! This is my go to beer bread recipe because it is the best I have found.
It's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Perfection!
Once I only had 8 ounces of beer left so i used milk for the other 4 ounces.  It turned out a little richer and now I always use a little milk.

Great melt-in-your-mouth flavor!  This is the best - and EASIEST - beer bread that I have made yet.  I actually had to go back for more!

6/24/14 - I'm making Mixes in Jars for prizes for a baby shower, so I decided to make this mix.  Turned out very pretty, and I'm sure it will be a hit!  If you would like to do this, simply mix all the DRY ingredients in a Quart-sized jar (WIDE-mouth is the best!!!).  Press down each layer as you put them in the jar (I used a sheet of paper as a funnel to make less mess).  Then add instructions explaining the oven temperature, additional ingredients (beer and butter - what better??), and how long to cook.

I made this a sweeter bread to accompany our corned beef and cabbage meal for St. Patrick's day.  Omitted the onion powder and italian seasonings, and added 1 T. white sugar and 1/4 cup dried cranberries. The beer I used was Honey Brown to give it a little extra oomph. It was delicious, not a crumb left at the end of the meal.  Going to follow the recipe tonight to go with the soup I made from the leftover veggies and corned beef drippings.  I will probably just round to an even 3 cups of self rising flour, doesn't seem necessary to add plain flour and then baking powder anyway.

There's an out-of-this-world little lunch place in town whose menu changes daily; there's always a salad, and a sandwich, but the five different soups (each day 5 new ones) are the main attraction. And each soup comes with your choice: a roll, or beer bread individual loafs...and words can't describe how delicious that beer bread is!! I'd trade the soup away for that beer bread, and that's not easy. When I tried this recipe, I just about fell over and my husband crowed his thanks for days!! This is *EXACTLY* that bread!!!!  Thank you sooooo much!!!

I recommend using a dark beer for this, such as Guiness.  It gives it great flavor!  I also add a cup of shredded cheddar. Yum!

This is our favorite beer bread recipe!  Hands down.  It has taken me a few times to get a handle on it, since I like to find ways to make my life easier.  I mix it in a mixer, I add 1/8 of yeast, and when I brush on the butter, I mash the top down a bit.  It rose beautifully and made a nice crust.  Perfect! 

Oh, and I have used Medelo Especial, and regular Shiner Bock in the recipe.  Since summer is coming up I think I'm gonna try Shock Top to give it some orang-y flavor.

My first review, and first try at beer bread.  I used Guinness, which I warmed just a bit (yes, I cried, but did not let tears into batter.)  Also, I had to turn my all-purpose flour into self-rising per bv's instructions.
Batter filled loaf pan to about half height.
 This smelled great at first.
 In 45 minutes it was done, but had not risen at all.  Let it cool and tried it.
  Result was a mix of burnt oatmeal and wet bicycle tire.
  Cried again.

Fabulous! Only change I made was only used 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning which was perfect amount not to take away from the other flavors of the bread.  Used good old Budweiser and everyone loved it.

Haven't yet used this recipe, but I've used a similar one, which was great. I'm excited to try it. Planning on using Tastefully Simple's Bacon Bacon Dip, just a simple seasoning w/ mayonnaise and sour cream. I wouldn't eat beer bread without it.

VERY GOOD!! I have made beer bread in the past but this is very light and tastes amazing! The only changes I made were to skip the seasonings and a few shakes of garlic salt to the mix before adding the beer. I also used a full bottle of budweiser select for the beer. Overall very impressed with this recipe.

This is really very good.  I used a dark German bock beer and could really taste it.  The only thing that tasted a little off was the Italian seasoning.  It just really didn't belong.  Next time I'll leave it out and make 5 star bread :)  The onion powder, on the contrary, really works with the beer and adds a great flavor.

It just so happens that I had a bottle of beer on hand that I needed to use up. What better way than to make easy beer bread. I mixed the dry ingredients together omitting the onion powder (personal preference). Also I used fresh herbs, chopped, in place of the italian seasoning. I did go a little under a 1/4 cup of sugar, added a good size jalapeno pepper, diced with seeds, and I threw in a handful of mexican blend cheese. I only had a light beer on hand so its what I used for this bread recipe. I let it rise for 1 hour before pouring melted butter over the top of the bread. I baked the bread for 55 mins. What I had was a nice golden color beer bread with a crusty topping. The bread was buttery and moist (most likely due to the melted butter), not at all crumbly and dry.  There were specks of green jalapeno peppers along with the yellow cheddar and mixed cheeses. The texture and smell of the "fresh" baked bread was wonderful. There was also a slight sweetness in the bread -very nice, not overpowering at all. The top of the bread gave a nice crunch with a buttery flavor. With this bread recipe you could certainly add other types of cheese, herbs, and different types of beer. This pairs well with a bowl of chili or hearty stew.

Substituted half whole wheat, half bread flour, added milled flax seed and used about 1 1/3 bottled wheat beer.  Very good, especially with butter!

Made this tonight without the onion powder and italian seasoning as I wanted to see how close to the boxed mixes it was.  It was Awesome!!  Hubby gave it two thumbs up.  This will be a keeper as we are not big beer drinkers, but after a gathering with friends always seem to have beer left in our fridge.  :-)

This is amazing.  I don't know why anyone would want to buy one of those TS party beer breads because this is so much better!   Not only is this bread more tastey than the TS beer bread, it's sooo much cheaper to make.  Two thumbs up.

The best beer bread!!  I made for a get-together with friends and everyone raved about it all night.  Excellent flavor.  I omitted the onion powder and Italian seasoning and replaced the regular salt with garlic salt. Perfect!

Thank you for this recipe! My husband said it was the best bread he ever had!!! I added 1 teaspoon of italian seasoning as oppposed to 3/4 teaspoon. Other than that, I did not change a thing. Next time I will make it in a non stick loaf pan. If you want a tasty bread that is easy to make, look no further!!! :)

Excellent! Can't wait to try it with chili! I also used 1/4 cup of chopped onion, and tossed in some shredded cheddar cheese, and otherwise followed the recipe. I love the texture, especially like it still warm, or warmed up.

This was soooo yummy and hearty!  I did not have self-rising flour so thanks to bv in Provo, Utah for the tip! 1 cup flour, 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt = 1 cup self-rising flour. I was afraid it was going to be too much salt after making my own self-rising flour but it was awesome.  I chopped up some sliced jalapenos in a jar and added shredded cheese.  Used a Bud Select 55. I'll def be making this again with chili!

I made two loaves. One with self rising flour (used rosemary) and One loaf I had to make the self rising flour 1T/1t baking powder .5t salt. Neither loaf was edible. The non self rising was WAY too salty and the Rosemary loaf was just plain old bad.

So easy and makes a beautiful loaf of bread.  I only used 2 tablespoons of melted butter instead of the 1/4 cup called for. Bake for 45 minutes. I will no longer buy the mix.  I'll just make my own. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent!!! I followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the italian seasonings as recommended if you weren't going for an "italian taste". I've never made any kind of bread before and was almost positive it was going to come out just not tasting right. But I suprised myself and my husband! Awesome recipe, will definitely make again.

This bread was super easy and really delicious!  My 10 year old had the brilliant idea to thinly slice & carmelize a small vidalia onion and mix that into the batter.  He has the best ideas!  It was really fantastic and hearty.  Can't wait to make it agin to serve with a nice fall soup!  ( I also just used AP flour, baking powder and salt in lieu of the self rising flour!)

Very awesome!!!! I used someone elses recommendation of 3C flour, 1T +1t baking powder and 1t salt instead of self-rising flour...I omitted the onion powder and italian seasoning (personal pref...my dad never put these in his), increased the brown sugar to 1/3 C, and used a bottle of Amstel. Very very good. Thanks for sharing! :)

I really liked this recipe.  I was simple to make. Like another reviewer stated, skip the Italian seasoning.  It will taste better without.  I also used a honey lager, and it made the bread taste great!  I will definitely make again.

This is a great, versatile recipe - I like substituting a little whole wheat flour and removing the spices, then use the bread as toast with breakfast. It's great with everything!

I have always used a beer bread mix but decided recently to find a good recipe for it instead. This barely took longer than the mix I use and tasted much better. Very easy and very good. Had it with chili and my husband and kids loved it.

I used 3 C. flour, 1 Tbs. + 1.5 tsp. baking powder, 1 Tbs. sea salt in loaf #1, skip the seasonings. In loaf #2 I changed to 1 1/2 c. white flour and 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour, same baking powder and salt as above. Loaf #2 also got the onion powder and Italian seasoning. Same dark lager for both. Solid 4 star bread.

I give this five stars because it made an absolutely beautiful, tasty loaf with a very strange flavor of beer. I used a cinnamon Horchata beer that I don't particularly care for as a drink, but it worked in the bread beautifully when I subbed in cinnamon sugar for the savory seasonings. I did have to make my own self-rising flour, and I upped the brown sugar to 1/3c. as many had suggested, and I think perhaps I'll use less (unsalted) butter next time, but it came out gorgeous. Wish I'd taken a picture of it before I sliced into it.

Great beer bread!  As other reviewers mentioned, in place of self rising flour, I used a total of 1 TB + 1.5 tsp baking powder.  I added a total of 1tsp salt and I increased the brown sugar to 1/3 c.  Fun bread that tastes different depending on what kind of beer you put in.  Yum!

This is quite possibly the best bread that I have ever had.  I keep the dry ingredients stored in a mason jar and when I want to eat, I just mix with beer and pour on the butter in a loaf pan.  Cook for 45-50 mins and watch people flock toward the kitchen to ask if they can have some!

The brown sugar adds a wonderful sweetness. And don't worry about mixing in the brown sugar so perfectly. Where there were small clumps of brown sugar left the most scrumptious bits of bread.

This receipe is awesome!  Simple easy to follow.  We used 3 cups self-rising flour instead of the AP flour. Tasted fantastic.

I gave this mix as Christmas gifts and have made a few loaves myself. This is now my husband's favorite bread and super easy to make. I tried another person's suggestion of 1/3 cup brown sugar and not using the onion powder and Italian seasoning and that was my favorite - my husband likes both.

It was ok.  Kind of a hearty savory bread.  Would be good with a rich savory stew or something.  I think I will explore other beer bread recipes before I make it again.

I love this recipe! I have made it several times and always get great compliments on it! I usually use onion salt instead of salt and garlic powder instead of onion powder. If I use the onion powder then I use garlic salt. Either way it comes out delicious! My favorite beer for this has been Yuengling! Oh so yummy!

Amazing bread!! Perfect crunchy crust!  Couldn't ask for a better flavor!  I tried it without the onion powder and Italian seasonings for the dish I was preparing! Next will be with the 2 seasonings!

Very good! Used 3 cups regular flour with 3 T baking powder and 1 T of kosher salt (added no more). Upped the brown sugar to 1/3 c. Delicious and easy! Also didn't add the additional seasonings.

This was delicious! I didn't have self-rising flour so I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 3 cups regular flour to 2 tsp of baking powder without adding additional baking powder. I did not use the italian seasoning as I knew my hubby would not like it and I did use 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of 1/4. This was amazing!!!

I made this recipe for beer bread when my husband and I had one of his friends over for dinner. Though we had a LOT of food, we still ended up eating most of the bread; and by the next day couple days it was gone!

I'm definitely going to make it again! So much easier than traditional bread...

Very tasty; I like the suggested seasonings.  The consistency was okay, but just a little odd - tends to get very crunchy and hard on the top, while the inside is a bit too soft.  Maybe need to experiment with the different types of flour/baking powder.  I am not a big butter fan, but I really liked the melted butter on top.  The brown sugar is a good choice, too, though it may seem odd at first.

Loved this! Even my kids loved it. I almost didn't use the seasoning as I was a little afraid to after reading some of the reviews, but decided to use them anyway and I am happy I did. I used Boulevard Wheat Beer. Such an easy recipe! Excited to try this with a darker beer and more brown sugar and no spices as some suggested.

I made this tonight to go with stuffed cabbage 
rolls and it was absolutely delicious. So easy and quick to make. I used 3/4 tsp of mrs dash salt free garlic and herb seasoning,for the Italian seasoning, and a bottle of lite beer. Will definitely add to my recipe box and make again. Fifty minutes in the oven and I had a golden loaf of delicious bread.Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

Very good recipe the spices were a nice tweak on the other beer bread recipe I tried on here... very good I am sure that you can play around with them and make your own creation... good recipe though.. I made 3 cups of self rising flour but using 1 cup flour to 1 teaspoon making powder to 1/2 teaspoon salt and that seemed to work well... also I don't know if the butter is totally necessary if you want to be healthy I am sure you can leave it off but oh my does it create a great crispy layer all the way around the bread

An outstanding recipe, as written -- it's easy; it's delicious, and the aroma is out-of-this world.  I followed the directions exactly and was rewarded with a moist bread with a tender crumb and a golden crust. It has an interesting flavor -- with a bit of a tart edge to it, but it is a very pleasant flavor and blends well with butter or cheese. Excellent! Thank you for submitting it, Kory H.

I make this recipe all the time! So fast and easy, and an excellent way to have fresh bread without having to wait for anything to rise. The recipe is fantastic as is. I prefer to double the onion powder, throw in some garlic powder and italian seasoning, and half a cup of shredded Parmesan. I get asked for the recipe all the time!

So delicious! This beer bread is the easiest and tastes exactly like tastefully simple beer bread! I used Yeingling beer and it gave it a very nice flavor! Though I found that the time was shorter when I did this recipe. Though it won't win in beauty contests it tasted amazing. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so delicious my family ate the loaf in one sitting. I did make the mistake of adding the butter into the dough and then again putting it on top. Next time I'll just put it on top. I used a dark beer. Just fabulous!

I just told my husband how smart I am for making this WONDERFUL bread!  I used to buy the beer bread mixes in a box for a ridiculous price.  Why would anyone do that when they can whip up this recipe in minutes?  I honestly believe this recipe is the best I've ever had, and I bake a LOT of bread!

This was my first time ever making any type of bread and I decided to try it because it sounded easy enough.  Low and behold it is so tastey.  The other reviewers are right you can just about add anything you want to this mix and it will taste great.  I did an italian seasoning this time, but next time I am thinking a sweet bread.

This was good but I must have cooked it too long.  I think it may have only taken 35 minutes.  Needs more flavor.  Maybe dark beer and more herbs.  Will make again to experiment.

This beer bread was easy to make with ingredients that I already had. My whole family thought it was very tasty. I used a sundried tomato and garlic cream cheese spread on it.

This was really, really good! I made a few minor changes though, I omitted the baking powder and salt, added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and since I'm almost out of butter I used olive oil. Fantastic!

Pretty good, like one reviewer said don't add that extra tsp of baking powder.  I wouldn't add that extra 1/2 tsp of salt either.  The butter makes a crispy crust which my husband loved.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! I've been searching for the perfect Beer Bread recipe for years, and this is most definitely it! I followed the recipe verbatim, and it was amazing! I used Guinness, and the brown sugar was the perfect compliment to the signature bite of a good stout. Will absolutely make this again and again and again!

Oh My Goodness!!  This is amazing!  I followed the recipe to a "T" w/ the exception of adding dried rosemary, shredded sharp cheddar cheese and garlic powder to the mix.  This was a HIT at Easter dinner!  This will be my new "gift" at holidays ... replacing my old standby, banana bread.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!  VERY versatile too ... I can't wait to test w/ jalapenos and/or chilis!

Excellent recipe!  Made it with Guinness for St Patrick's day, which made the bread have a rather strong after taste that I'm not used to in my bear bread (I have only had Shiner Bock beer bread before), but it was still very tasty, especially the buttery crust.  Everyone loved it!

Didn't have self rising flour, so I added 2 1/2 t powder, 1 1/4 t salt, and 1/2 plus 1/4 t soda. Skipped the powder, salt, and ital seasoning (only b/c I didn't have ital seasoning). It was great, but only took about 35 minutes in the oven. I made this as gifts skipping the onion and upping the sugar to 1/3 c as suggested. I am getting rave reviews too.

Great Bread, very easy.  I have used it before, and it came out wonderful.  This time I left out the seasoning, and used Hard Cider instead of beer.  Great taste and goes well with cream cheese spread.

This bread was thoroughly enjoyed with buffalo wing dip... we do not drink beer so for us it was an expirement, the taste was sweet, with a very mild hint of beer.. The bread turned out exactly as the picture shows... this recipe was very easy, however I did put the butter in the bread rather than on top, found my mistake and decided to add more melted butter to the top. It still turned out great! even better toasted.

Great bread, I didn't have self-rising flour so I used the previously suggested 3c flour, 4.5 tsp baking powder, 1.5 tsp salt, sprinkled garlic powder after melted butter and added parmesean cheese.  My family LOVED it, even my picky hubby.

Totally enjoyed this recipe!  I read the reviews and decided to use the self rising flour and omit the all purpose flour and baking powder.  I increased the herbs by 1/2 teaspoon and this was great with chili on this cold day.  It had a crusty outside with a tender inside.  The hubby loved it and I will make again!

4 stars as written, 5 with changes: 3 c. regular flour, 1 T. baking powder + up the spices.  This was very tasty and we'll definitely be making it again!  Thanks for the recipe! :)

I've tried a few beer bread recipes, and this is by far, the best.  I used self-rising flour and eliminated the baking powder. I added a tablespoon of garlic powder because I wanted to try combining the onion and garlic powder.  It turned out better than I thought it would.  And as a side benefit, although one is not needed, the house smells GREAT!

I used only the "homemade" self-rising flour and did not add in the addtional baking powder or salt, or the herbs.  I used 12 oz. of ginger ale in place of the beer, which gave this a bit of a sweeter flavor.  My picky 7 year old said, "Mom, I LOVE this bread!" and ate 2 pieces with his dinner and another with lunch today.  Try it with soda, it's yummy!

Fantastic!!!
I used all purpose flour + baking powder...and added onion powder, granulated garlic and Mrs. Dash Table Blend!!It is a little sweet, will probably decrease the brown sugar next time.Added granulated garlic to the melted butter on the top.
I will make this again and again...as well as give as gifts!! It perfect, you can tweak it in all different kind of ways and its sooo simple!!!
LOVE IT!

I was looking for a quick bread to serve with soup for dinner. This recipe is very easy to make. I had no self-rising flour, so I used the recipe provided by another reviewer to substitute for that. I also waited until the bread had been baking for about 15 minutes to pour on the butter (only because I forgot this step initially!) Other than this, I followed the recipe exactly. The bread came out great. It has a nice texture, crunchy crust and delicious flavor. Thank you very much for this recipe!

Recipe was good - Bob loved it.  I thought it was a bit dense and salty. The Italian seasoning makes it less versatile than Tastefully Simple's mix.

I made this tonite to go with the chili I made and it was great.  I followed another review by using 3 cups flour, 1tbsp plus 1tsp baking powder and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  I also used a very dark beer (Leinie's Creamy Dark...my favorite) which gave the bread a bit of a bite.  I'm so happy I found this recipe and will be making it often.  No more box mixes for me.

Fabulous recipe. Leave out the italian seasoning and onion powder unless you have a specific italian purpose in mind. The 1/3 cup brown sugar idea was great!

Followed directions to the T and came out perfect!  The butter pushed out of the pan when the bread rose while baking causing some smoke and clean up.  Other than that mild inconvenience recipe was well received by my family.  Thank you for sharing.

I thought this recipe was fantastic as is.  I didn't bother to find two different types of flour, I just used 3 cups of whatever I had-- All purpose I think.  The brown sugar is what really makes this recipe stand out above other beer bread recipes.  The amount of Italian herbs and seasonings were so small that it was neglegable in the taste.  Most likely, it added that little "something" that's hard to figure out so I left it.  As far as beer bread goes, this is really top notch!

Excellent beer bread.  It was so moist and flavorful.  I added extra Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp of dried minced garlic.  It was fabulous.  It made the house smell fantastic. I will certainly make this again.

This bread smelled wonderful baking--is easy to mix up--and tastes heavenly. I didn't have Italian seasoning so used fresh dried herbs to make my own. Took some to work and they loved it. It also is great toasted with garlic cloves run over the top with pasta the next night, if there is any left. I will make again.

My husband loves this bread.  The flavor of the beer comes through nicely, just be sure it's a flavor that you like. I used a hefeweizen, maybe I'll experiment with a bitter beer (maybe not).  Thanks for the great recipe.

We really enjoyed this. I used 3 c. self rising flour as another reviewer suggested and it came out great - sort of the consistency of a biscuit (crumbly crust, soft on the inside). I only used about 2 tablespoons melted butter on top and it was still very tasty. I thnk that other herbs like dill, sage, rosemary or thyme would go nicely in this bread as well. This was a nice accompaniment to Spinach & Leek White Bean Soup.

I thought this recipe was great - although I didn't add the baking powder, Italian seasoning or the onion powder (I probably will try the onion powder next time).  I've been looking for a beer bread recipe that tasted fabulous and didn't crumble.  I think I've found it - and friends have asked immediately for the recipe.

A flavour packed loaf with a divine crunchy crust!
I didn't have onion powder so I used cream of chicken soup (YUM) and used mixed herbs instead of Italian seasoning.

I have been making this recipe since 2012. Made it for a dinner party last night, and people continually ask me for the recipe. I  usually add a little minced garlic to it, for the garlicy bread flavor--especially with lasagna. It's fantastic as is or with minor modification in seasonings!

One of my favorite quick bread recipes to make.  It's always a hit at bake sales too.  I make it as written. I love the flexibility of this recipe though. Sometimes I add 1/2 tsp of garlic powder in addition to the herbs or I'll swap Italian herbs for Old Bay.   I also sprinkle TJ's "Everything But the Bagel" on top for a little something extra. So tasty!!

Delicious. I make self-rising flour out of AP and whole wheat flour following the directions on King Arthur Flour website. I used half whole wheat flour for the 2 1/2 cups of self rising flour and the other half AP flour. I used Kona Longboard beer. So good!

Very good and very easy. I accidentally poured the butter into the batter the first time I made it and it was so good. The next time I made it as instructed and the bread was very dry. I’ll keep mixing the melted butter into the batter. I also omit the Italian seasoning but I’ve made it with and really didn’t notice a difference.

I am a private chef and I made this one evening to rave reviews. Just one note, it is very hard to slice, the top is very crumbly and crusty, hard to slice neatly. Next time I will make it as muffins.

Wow!  All I can say is this recipe was off the charts delicious!  I didn't change a thing except omitted the Italian seasonings.  I like the savory onion and the brown sugar was perfect to counter the hop taste from the hefe beer I used.  A definite keeper!  made 2 loaves because its that good!

Turned out good. I used 3 cups all purpose flour since that is all I have. Had to bake it an extra 10 min or so but otherwise good flavor and good taste

Very good and very easy! I make several of these at a time (the dry ingredients only) and store them in canning jars or ziplock bags so I can make them whenever and all I have to do is add one can of beer!

I made this recipe exactly the way is was written so I can gauge any modifications it may have needed to suit my family. I agree with others that it's a good base and a pretty forgiving recipe as you can adjust spices as you see fit. I'll definitely make this again with modifications one of them being just using three cups of self rising flour.

I made this twice now. Came out great both times. I prefer to use ginger ale as opposed to beer.  It does give the bread a sweeter taste. But that is my personal preference.

I used Hard cider ( apple) because that was what I had. I omitted the seasonings, just used the brown sugar. They came out great with a delicious flavor and texture. I would definitely make this again because it was so easy.

We made this today for our after Thanksgiving get together. We wanted a meal that was easy to prepare so we could spend less time in the kitchen. This bread and a pot of white bean chili fit the bill. I used 3 cups of self rising flour and the 1/3 c of brown sugar with a nice Honey Ale. We made two loaves, one we added only a 1/3c of shredded cheese (Monterey/Colby mix), the other we used the same spices in the recipe. The cheese bread was more popular but I liked them both. Great recipe!

This is awesome bread. I followed bv's suggestion because I only had all purpose flour. We have used a variety of flavored beers. Our favorite was done with an apricot lager. Turns out a little sweet. My oldest boy always asks when I'm going to make beer bread. It's a favorite!

This bread may be finished off in a day! I didn't add the onion or Italian seasoning, and it turned out with a delicious, crispy, buttery,  crust and a hint of sweetness. Will be making this all fall and winter!

yummy good! I have made this recipe 4 times now and have used 4 different beers. I also added 1/2 cup of Sharp Cheddar and Added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder...served with spice infuse oil for dipping
Friends love this one.   Make sure you have 12 ounce beer anything less your bread will be very dry. the picture is Sam Adams Winter Lager.

Great bread recipe, I have tried it with onion spice and italian spices added and also without them.  I prefer without them and just the yummyness of the bread itself with butter.

Super easy. Great to pair with chili! Sub a can of club soda if beer turns you off, but USE GOOD CRAFT BEER; makes all the difference.

I made mine with added creole seasoning instead. I prefer Guinness or a dark black porter.  Gives bread more taste, the darker the beer, the better the bread. Everyone loves this bread - even my lo-carb hubby begs for this one.

This is excellent!  I used garlic powder (didn't have onion) and a homebrewed pale ale.  It was gone within minutes.  I'll try  this again tomorrow with a nut brown ale. Thanks!

I've been experimenting with different kinds of beer - so far I like a Belgian Tripel the best.  Stay away from hoppy beers, though.  It seems like the bitterness migrates to the crust.  My first loaf I tried an IPA - you almost couldn't eat the crust!

I made this bread yesterday, it was a nice, dense, rustic loaf.  The only thing I will change next time: do an egg wash before baking, and then butter straight from the oven. And, omit the italian seasoning, and replace it with a little garlic and basil. The italian seasoning overwpowered the bread.

This recipe was ok, but it didn't have the great smell of beer bread when cooking and the flavor was just ok. I won't make it again.

A nice change, the texture was good.  I used Rickard's Red beer.  I think different beer would give a very different taste so I'll experiment.  I'd make it again.

interesting...does not taste like beer at all.  Very easy and very quick.  Followed the instructions except added 1/2c shredded cheddar and baked in a tube pan (40 mins) because I didn't have the right size pan.  The odd thing was the batter was quite dry and lumpy before it went in the pan...and the cooked product is moist, but doesn't hold together?  I would try it again as written but with a few extra herbs/garlic to amp up the savory flavour.  The butter on top definitely adds a lot to the texture and flavour

I love this beer bread! The only thing I changed was by using more herbs (chives and garlic) as I served it with a spaghetti dinner. I will definitely be making this bread again!

This recipe was one of the easiest and most delicious things I've made!  It was my first time making bread and it couldn't have been simpler.  I was so impressed with how lovely it turned out.  I've been getting compliments from everyone who has tried it.

Made exactly as written and was amazing! I am always a bit wary of using recipes with beer because I don't like the taste if it doesn't cook/bake away enough, but this was absolutely amazing. I am a bread lover but my boyfriend can take it or leave it and even he loved this one!

I had my hopes set high for something that tasted like the Tastefully Simple beer bread and this let me down hard. I made it 3 separate times with 3 different beers and each one was bitter and inedible.

I'm not a baker at all.  In fact if it didn't come out of a mix and straight into a bread maker I wouldn't go near it.  This recipe has changed that.  It was so easy, and so tasty I had to make a second load right away because my kids wouldn't keep their hands off of it.  Yum yum yum!  The only thing I did differently was increase the onion powder to make up for the italian seasoning which I didn't have.

I used to make a simple version of this adding beer soaked raisins and no Italian seasoning or onion powder.  The trick is to add the melted butter as soon as it comes out the oven.

Yum! My hubby wanted to know if next time i could make the whole loaf into just the bread crust! Very good. I will try without savory seasoning next time  as I like it toasted with jam the next day.

Far better than any boxed mix---this is delicious! My family raved about it and wants me to make this more often.  Like other reviewers, I didn't have self-rising flour, so I added 1 1/4 tsp. baking powder and 1/8 tsp. salt per cup of regular flour. I used all the other ingredients exactly as recommended. I actually made the bread the night before our meal, wrapped it in foil after it cooled, and simply warmed it in the foil the next evening. No one knew the difference.  Thanks, Kori!

I am not a bread maker, but this was soooo easy! It was a great, easy appetizer when I cut out the center to make a bread bowl and filled it with spinach artichoke dip! Will do this one again for sure. (I used Fat Tire beer...)

I followed the recipe exactly and loved how it turned out. Had some with a spaghetti dinner last evening then toasted some this morning with my cereal. Very good consistancy with an excellent flavor. The next time I make it I might try some Mexican seasoning in place of the Italian seasoning just for variety.

Great recipe! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used only self-rising flour, no extra baking powder, no onion powder or italian seasoning.  I won't be buying beer bread mix from Tastefully Simple anymore!  This tastes just as good and is MUCH less expensive!  I'm planning to make several mixes for Christmas gifts.

Excellent! Very similar to Tastefully Simple! I didn't add the italian seasoning but increased the brown sugar to about a 1/2 c. Perfect!  Ginger- I have made this with Coke and it comes out very sweet! I like it, but it husband prefers it with beer. I have also tried flavored beers and mountain dew. Both were great!

I have used the Tastefully Simple Beer Bread mix for years... I'm wondering if anyone has made this with soda (i.e. Sprite or Coke) instead of beer?  We don't like the taste of beer.

I grilled some of this tonight and served it with pumpkin soup. It is one of the easiest and tastiest breads I have ever made. I did leave out the onion powder and italian seasoning to make the taste more neutral, but I am sure it would be great as written. Enjoy!

First time trying this type of bread, I didn't use loaf pan, but baked it in a dutch oven with lid on for first 30 minutes, and than removed lid for last 15 minutes. Left out onion and Italian seasoning, but also will leave out salt next time I bake it. Nice crunchy outside and soft on the inside. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe multiple times and always get rave reviews.  Some say that this recipe is better than a certain home party brand.  But I do cheat a pair the bread with the pre-made dip mix blends from that company.  I will be making this again and do follow the recipe completely.

I enjoy a good beer bread and I liked this one very much.  Though I wouldn't rate it a s the best I've ever had, it was very yummy.  I like that the top has some crunch to it.  Wonderful texture, not too heavy.

This recipe is fantastic.  I make it every week and add new things.  I make it with different cheeses and different bears.  Sometimes even add chopped ham.  This is requested for every family event. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was truly 5 stars in my book.  I used Guiness beer and I was thrilled with the taste.  My husband ate some of his bread with the french onion dip from scratch from this site.  (I was in a cooking mood and cooked for 3 1/2 hours straight!) I can not wait to play around with the ingredients.  Please do not hesitate to try this.

I used Guiness. Not bad. Nice crispy, salty outer shell and soft, moist inside - easier to eat in chunks than in slices.

Very tasty! I used honey lager and substituted wheat flour for the white. I also left out the baking powder as someone else suggested, but will try leaving it in next time to see what difference it makes. The spices were not overwhelming at all but just added a subtle flavoring. I used Mrs. Dash Italian flavored. Will try again and leave out the spices and add some honey to the butter before pouring it over the top.

Very nice, hearty bread. Served with Bean soup with Kale, from this site, as a perfect accompaniment. Many variations would be possible to suit whatever you are serving it with. Thanks!

I liked the idea of giving this as a gift, so without ever trying it, I made 4 batches, I put 3 of them in quart jars, tied some ribbons with hearts on them around the tops and gave one to each of our grown kids for Valentines day.  I made one loaf for my husband and I and we loved it.  All the kids said it was some of the best home made bread they've had.  I didn't have any italian seasoning, so I used Emeril's recipe that he calls "Bam"  Wow!  It really did kick it up a notch to borrow from Emeril. The butter is a must.  My second loaf is in the oven now, thank you!

This was good but not what I remember eating as a kid. My bread did not have the crunchy crust and was pretty crumbly. Not sure if I did something wrong or not, maybe I will try it again and see if I get better results next time.

I was so very disappointed in this recipe.  I was skeptical because of the ingredients and the bread came out way too salty.  It was dry and the beer flavor came out way too much.  I was so hoping for something different.

Very easy and very good.  I've tried a few beer bread recipes, and usually they end up crumbly.  This one didn't.  I didn't melt butter bc somehow I acquired that spray butter, so I just opened the container and poured some over the loaf.  Worked just fine.  I don't buy self rising flour but use the recipe from here.  I really didn't change anything about the recipe, but I can see how versatile it would be.  I also made a couple of mixes to give out as gifts this year.

This is a great recipe! Very easy, quick, and delicious. I used all the ingredients, except I substituted the onion for garlic powder and added a tbsp. of grated parmesan cheese in the mix. I also made a version with sliced green olives. Wonderful!

This was so good and couldn't be any easier to make!  I took others' recommendations of leaving out the onion powder and Italian seasoning.  I can't say how it would taste with it but it tasted just great without it.  Only problem I had was the top was very crumbly and wanted to tear upon cutting.  Not sure what to do about that.

My loaf didn't turn out horrible, but compared to the boxed version from Tastefully Simple that I usually make, it lacked flavor.  Granted I didn't put in the italian seasonings, but I wanted a basic beer bread taste to go with a variety of dips and a cheese fondue.  The beer taste was not strong enough for my family, friends or myself.  Will probably stick with the boxed version, but thanks for the recipe anyhow.

Very easy to make and very tasty! It made a nice big loaf that rose quickly. I didn't have italian seasoning, so I substituted a bit of parsley, basil, and Mrs. Dash, and it worked great.  Will definitely make again.

I actually made this recipe exactly per instructions (first for me!) and it turned out perfect. My husband really liked it and even my younger ones did. I was surprised, I thought the onion would be too strong. It is definitely something you have to be in the mood for. I think I'll omit the herbs for myself next time, and make it with herbs for everyone else. Super easy to make. Thanks!

This was good.  Easy way to make bread.  One of my kids did not like it, and it does have a pretty strong aftertaste, but I think any beer bread recipe would.  I used a hefeweizen beer and omitted the spices.

This was the best little Christmas gift for my friends this year.  They all loved it and thought it was great.  It is really good cut up and served with any sour cream based dip.

This was so easy.  I decided to make it as a jar gift also, and it was well received.  Great recipe!

Everybody loved it, but everybody and myself thought it had a salty taste.  But other than that it was a big hit and I recommend this recipe.

I would actually rate this a 3.5. It rose well and I loved the crust but there was an after taste that put me off it a bit, but thats personal taste the rest of my family didn't have a problem with it, they devoured the whole loaf in a single sitting. Thanks.

This bread was GREAT!  My entire family just loved it.  The crunchy top is especially delicious and this bread is fantastic with a really good soup and salad.
