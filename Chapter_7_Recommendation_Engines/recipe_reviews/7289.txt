First, this cake is SUPPOSED to be super thin. Hence, Texas SHEET Cake. Like the reviewer below said, use the large jellyroll size pan (15"x10") not a 9x13 or 8x8...it just won't work.

Very very moist and rich. I lost my original recipe about a year ago and have been searching to find one that will work. This one is almost there, but I do add a bit more cocoa. It just didn't have enough chocolate flavor. Otherwise, this recipe is just awesome!

Be sure to pour the icing over the cake right out of the oven. It soaks in and makes a beautiful thin smooth icing on top. ALSO, IF YOU COVER THIS WITH FOIL OR SARANWRAP...be sure to use toothpicks or something to prop up the foil, otherwise it will stick to the icing and you'll have a huge mess. Lesson learned the hard way! :-)

This is the exact same recipe my mother makes....this is easy and quick. Be sure to use a jelly roll pan or the Pampered C.'s bar pan.   You can substitue a 1/2 tsp vinegar or lemon juice with milk for the buttermilk.  That is how I always make this recipe and I make it about 10 times a year.  This is great for a potluck or small group dessert.  Feeds a lot of people.  Thanks for sharing.

This is THE Texas sheet cake recipe! Exactly the same as the one I got from my Mom. It always turns out so moist and delicious. (And yes, sweet!). The recipe doesn't mention pan size that I can see... be sure and use the large jellyroll size pan (15"x10") not a 9x13 or it won't cook right. It comes out to be quite a thin cake, it is so sweet you don't want a big thick piece! If you've never made a Texas sheet cake before, you will doubt the odd preparation method and probably be concerned that there is no possibility that it will turn out when you see the runny batter, but don't worry!!

UPDATE:  I changed the 1/2 cup shortening for 1/2 cup vegetable oil.  Much better now.
This is my hubby's favorite cake.  He is from Nebraska and they call it a "Tommy Cake".  I couldn't find his Mom's "Tommy Cake" recipe, so I looked until, I found one very similar to her's.  He said it was just like the one he remembered as a child.  We served it at a Christmas dinner this year and it was a big hit.

I've made many chocolate cakes and this is a good one but not my personal favorite. A little too dense and flour tasting but lots of chocolate flavor though!  
When you flour the pan add a sprinkle of cocoa powder too.  It looks better than the white bottom which can occur with flour and has the same non stick results as the flour.

This icing is really what makes this cake.  I did add an additional tablespoon of cocoa to the cake mix for a more chocolate flavor.  Make sure to sift your ingredients so you don't get any "white" specs in your cake or icing.  Although this cake is good at room temperature, it's even better refrigerated overnight and served cold.

Excellent flavor, I really like this cake.  The icing is great, I added 1 cup walnuts and 1 tsp vanilla in it.  I also used one extra Tbsp of cocoa powder in the cake.  Next time I'll add a little salt and cinnamon as some of the other recipes include.

This was very simple to make and turned out quite moist, but I wish it would have had a deeper chocolate flavor (the cake itself).  Frosting was good; I didn't realize that I was low on powdered sugar and only used about 3 cups instead of 4 which made it plenty sweet enough.  I also added some walnuts to the frosting because that is the way I've always had it.

All I can say is WOW. I have never made a chocolate cake from scratch before so I don't have much to compare to, but after this recipe I wouldn't bother to find another. The only things I did differnt is that I cut the recipe in half (to serve a smaller crowd) and put in a 11x7 pan and baked for the same amount of time and used buttermilk instead of reg milk in the frosting. It was so moist and chocolaty....The only thing I might try different is to throw some mini choc chips in as well just to differ the texture and add more chocolate. My friends gave it 3 thumbs up and couldn't believe I made it from scratch!
Thanks for the amazing recipe! ~

Great Recipe!!! Oven Temperature needs to be 325 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes instead drying it out at 400 degrees.  (My original recipes came from Southern Living and the temp was 325.) I always add at least 1 cup of chopped pecans to the frosting.

It looks like a long time since someone reviewed this recipe.  I made it this last weekend (3-21-10)for my DIL's birthday.  It turned out great!  Only change I made was I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter from another receipe that I had previously made.  DELICIOUS !

Super easy and just like my mom's (I'd lost the one she gave me). Perfect for classroom treats b/c the icing sets and makes them less messy than cupcakes. Thanks for sharing!

Worked out perfect! Just be sure to use the proper flour, I used a self-rising flour and it wasn't as flat as sheet cake needs to be. So be careful to choose the flour correctly.

It was OK, better than version I, however due to some glaring flaws in the recipe I only gave it 2 stars.  The oven temp was off; you need only bake at 375; also the ingredient list calls for 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla but only 1 tsp is used. Also dumping the hot ingredients all into a pile of dry ingredients makes one large mess with difficult to remove lumps. Frosting a hot cake with hot frosting is another disaster in the making. Sorry, moving on to version III next and hope it will be better!

Really good! I've never had a Texas sheet cake before, but my sister requested I make one for her.  It was excellent and easy to make.  I did add extra cocoa powder to the cake, like others suggested.  And I sifted the cocoa powder and also the powdered sugar  in the frosting to prevent any lumps.  I will definitely be adding this recipe to my favorites. Thank you !

Great little snacking cake! Great texture in the cake itself, not too light, it was a bit denser and had some body. The cake was very mild chocolate flavor, the icing is what really makes this one great. It gets a crisp outer layer and is very sweet. I added about half a cup of pecan pieces to the icing. I didn't measure them as I only had a little in the sack. I cut this in half and used a quarter sheet pan. Very good and I will definitely make this again! Thanks Diane!

Great recipe! The only change I made was to increase the cocoa in the cake and the icing by 1 tbsp. each since I like a deeper chocolate flavor.

Brought this to work for co-workers birthday.  Everyone loved it.  Several asked for recipe.  Personally, I wish it was a little more chocolatey.

This was good, but I think when most people saw it they thought it was a large pan of brownies. Until they saw the cake, that is.   I would personally prefer the deeper chocolate and the gooey moistness of brownies.  But if you are looking for a big thin chocolate cake, give this a try.  Oh, I also found that if you let the iced cake cool and then cover it with a piece of plastic wrap, the plastic wrap will not stick but it easily peels off without destroying the icing.  (I guess because of all the butter in the icing.)No need to stick toothpicks in the cake to hold the plastic wrap up or any other tricks.

Great cake. I didn't have buttermilk so I used a vinegar and milk mixture substitute. It worked fine. Definitely sift the ingredients well, including the dry ingredients for the icing. It's delicious with a scoop of icecream on top! I will definitely be making it again!

I was in need of something sweet and searched and search for a easy and quick cake. Boy am I glad I found this recipe!! This cake is so moist!! I didn't have a sheet pan so I just used a 13x9 pan. I cooked it a little longer about 10-15 minutes(until a toothpick came out almost clean). I had like a 1/4 cup of chocolate chips in the pantry so I threw them in. OMG I TOTALLY LOVED THIS CAKE!! I Will definitely make it again.

This is a recipe that everyone asks for whenever we do a picnic or a potluck.  I have made this literally, for years.  So easy to make and so diliciously rich.  There is never enough, and it seems someone always get left out, or someone always wants/needs just a little piece more.

I ABSOLUTELY love this recipe. My great grandmother made it all the time.  It is wonderful exactly as written however I've always added 1/2 chopped (drained) maraschino cherries along with chopped walnuts in the icing portion and it gives it a whole new dimension.

Back when dinosaurs roamed the earth, my college roommate's mom made this for us and was kind enough to share the recipe.  As years passed and after several relocations, I lost the recipe.  Imagine my delight to find it right here!:)  Now I make this again for potluck suppers and family reunions, and everyone enjoys this yummy cake tremendously.

This recipe makes a delicious chocolatey, fudgey cake. It's a down-home-type cake (not particularly elegant) but a lovely way to end a family dinner. This one really satisfies a chocolate cake craving.

This is the exact recipe I used to make years ago. I am so glad I found it again. I remember that I sometimes added cinnamon, so I added 1 tsp. This was very good, but I think just a hint of cinnamon would be better. Next time I make this I will add 1/2 tsp.of cinnamon. Thank you for submitting this great recipe Diane.

I make this cake exactally as written but use buttermilk, insead of regular milk, in the frosting. It gives it a nice little tang.

Just like my mom's old family recipe which is definitely the best chocolate cake I've ever had. I especially love the thick, fudgy frosting (my recipe has no vanilla in the frosting, and uses a full 1 lb. package of powdered sugar). Can't go wrong with this!

YUM!! YUM!! YUM!!  The only problem with this cake, is that I wanted to eat the entire thing.  That and the fact that my 3 year old was on a sugar buzz for the rest of the night.  So totally worth it though.  This is a keeper!!!

I made this for a July 4th party - it was a really easy recipe to make and went over well!  Three people in particular just kept going back over and over again for more cake - I think they ate over 1/2 of the cake just themselve!  It's a great combination of brownie/cake and easy "finger food".  I'm giving it 4 stars b/c it was a bit on the sweet side, but still quite good.  Maybe I'll sprinkle some nuts on top of the icing next time to try and cut the sweetness.

How did the perfect chocolate cake get such an unchocolatey name? I couldn't pour the frosting, it was like fudge ... no complaints here! I've been looking for ages for a cake with great taste, texture, cut-ability and here it is, thanks!

Rich chocolatey taste that is sometimes hard to find.  You don't use an electric mixer with this one.  Recommend sifting the confectioners sugar before making icing, or at least run a whisk through it first before adding.  Easy to make!  Be careful not to overbake; mine was done a bit earlier than recipe called for.  Icing pours over cake well and is smooth and shiny.

This is my favorite of all the Texas sheet cake recipes. I wouldn't change or add anything to it.  I did make it in a lipped 12 x 18 baking sheet (that's all I had). I just baked it for 15 minutes instead of 20.

I have made this cake since the 70’s for my family, back then everyone made it with shortening not butter then they started making it with 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening. On this recipe I notice it has shortening and butter, wonder why? The butter did change the taste completely. Just wonder why both is used.

This is the closest recipe to my mom’s “ Fudge Cake Brownies” as she used to call this death by chocolatey rich cake. The frosting is to die for if your a lover of fudge! I followed the recipe almost exactly, with the exception of using 1 cup of cold brewed black coffee instead of the water, and I substituted coconut oil for the shortening as that is what I had on hand. This is the easiest made-to-go perfect cake to take to an outdoor BBQ, or potluck as it is easily transported if you bake it in a large rectangular pan with a lid.

Use buttermilk, not milk and vinegar, that makes sour milk, not buttermilk, the cake will not be as good.

My grandma makes this for every holiday celebration and I never could figure out how she did it. This recipe might be an exact replica of hers. Absolutely fantastic.

I've made the traditional recipe since I was a girl. Excellent !  I had them made into cupcakes to augment my wedding cake! I had people bartering for all the leftover cupcakes! I recently altered the recipe using half sugar and half baking Spenda and split the flour with half oat flour and all purpose flour since I've gotten into a serious weight training program. Still just as wonderful!  I may try adding protein powder and all oat flour and all Spenda just to see, but nothing compares with the original!

Very good! Great dessert for Fourth of July, Super Bowl, and other fun holidays! It is great for snacking, not super rich, but very moist! No need to refrigerate, I just make it the night before, and it is perfect and ready to go the next day!! It is also super fun to make!

Used buttermilk for the frosting. Added 1/2 teas of cinnamon to cake batter. And used regular sugar vs powdered, just cooked till melted.

This cake is truly delicious.  When my sister-in-law visits from Ohio this is the first thing she asks for.  It's dense and moist and the icing is killer!  It's 5 stars as is but adding a little bit of cinnamon to both the cake and the icing adds extra pop.  Best eaten warm with a tall glass of cold milk.

Great recipe that reminds me of my mother's sheet cake she used to make when we were children. It makes a large cake, moist and chocolate-ty! I usually make half with nuts and half without. Make sure to spread batter evenly so the cake will be even.

This is a good recipe the only thing I do different is when it calls for water I substitute coffee (have had it with rum as well).  Also if you are using nuts always toast them first makes a big difference.. as a spin I have tried many different cocoas: ghirardelli, chocolate cherry, special dark and each adds its own flavor and depth..

ADD 1/2 TSP CINNAMON TO THE CAKE and it goes from awesome to fantastic.   With that one exception it's identical to my great-grandmother's.  The cinnamon gives it a little extra "kick!"

Add Coffee.  This is recipe that I have made for many years and we refer to it as sheet brownies.  The only difference in this recipe and the one I make is 'coffee'.  Brew a 1/2 cup of strong coffee and pour it into the mixture after all the other ingredients are mixed.  If you don't, you will in fact have a bit of a flour taste.  The other difference I do is I add walnut or pecan pieces to the mixture, not to the icing.  I allow the cake and the icing to cool a tad before placing the icing on the cake.  I then some times sprinkle just a few crushed nuts atop the iced cake.  This makes a lot of portions if you cut it like brownies.  I always keep this in the fridge because it taste better cold and will have a bit more firmness.  By the way, a real sheet cake is in fact thin.....that is why it's called a SHEET cake.  However, if you prefer a thick type cake, you could pour the batter into a smaller pan.  Also, I bake this on 350 because I do bake it in a large sheet pan.  It would burn up in my oven if I baked it on 400.

Definitely NOT the Texas Sheet Cake recipe I lost. The frosting was terrible and I had to add milk just to get it to spreadable consistency but it still just tasted like powdered sugar. When I found my real recipe for Texas Sheet Cake it calls for 1 cup of butter not a 1/2 cup of butter so I think that was the main problem.

I've also used this recipe for many years. I use buttermilk for the frosting and for a deeper chocolate flavor use the Hersey's Dark chocolate cocoa. I use pecans for the nuts and place them on top of the frosting.

The cake tasted like a chocolate pancake and the frosting was pure sugar. We used only half the sugar on the frosting and could hardly choke it down. Hurt my mouth.

Been making cakes for years.  About once a year or so, I try a scratch cake, just to remind myself why I stick with Duncan Hines.  This cake was moist, but barely tasted like chocolate.  Also, I baked it in two 8x8 pans, and it was barely enough.  Not sure how you could make it in a large sheet pan, as the cake would be so thin.  Frosted with cream cheese II frosting from this site.  It was better the second day, but I think I'll pass on this one.

I made this recipe for a large 4th of July gathering and it was a big hit. Everyone loved it!  It moist and flavorful. It seems to be a cross between cake and brownie.  Yum! It is also very easy to whip together. I will definately be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very tasty & moist cake - old fashioned flavor that is very satisfying. The "frosting", in my opinion, is more of a cocoa icing and was very sweet - even for my sweet tooth! Not at all creamy or fluffy, but compliments the cake well. (I was hoping for the same fudgey consistency as some other posts mentioned but my icing was thin and ran all over. I followed the recipe to the tee but wonder if I should have let it boil for a bit longer.)

This is my all-time favorite chocolate cake recipe, because it is DELICIOUS and easy to make.
Because of the high temperture cooking, I think it is not appropriate for cooking by young children.
