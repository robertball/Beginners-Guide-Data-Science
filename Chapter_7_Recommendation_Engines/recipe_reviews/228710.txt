What a pleasant surprise! This was my first time using the Recipe Starters. The recipe sounded super easy, and I was in the mood for a quick dinner, so I gave it a shot. I made the recipe exactly as written. I tasted the sauce straight out of the can and was a little skeptical.  Everything turned out perfectly seasoned! I didn't have to add a thing. The key is to make sure to slice the sirloin quite thin. That way, it gets really tender while it simmers in the sauce.  This was kind of messy to eat, but that's to be expected. I would make it again if I needed a quick dinner.

YUM!  I must say this was not a pretty dish but it was definitely yummy!  It was Hubby's idea to serve it with horseradish and I think that put it over the top.  I really like these easy recipes that Progresso Recipe Starters has shared.  Thank you Progresso!

Very good... I used flank steak and grilled it with onions and green peppers. Covered the bread with the heated sauce, stacked the steak high on the bread and covered with cheddar cheese. Broiled till golden brown and served as an open face steak sandwich... a little salty for me but my wife loved it!

We actually enjoyed this very much.  I did doctor it up with some garlic, fresh mushrooms, and a little white wine during.  The flavor was rich and the meat was very tender.

We thought this was a good sandwich because it made a little steak go a long way.  I followed the recipe except for using pepper jack cheese rather than provolone.  I think I would prefer this with a little more sauce served over pasta of some sort.  I would definitely add 8 oz of mushrooms to the mix, too.  Would you believe that this is the first time I've used Montreal seasoning?!   This was a successful, easy meal.  Thanks, Progresso!

This was okay.I was only able to get 6 sandwiches from this recipe. A little bit of worchestshire sauce would go a long way in here, and some extra steak seasoning. I had some baby bella's in the fridge so I sauteed those and added them on top.

Nice flavor and the sauce thickened nicely.  A little salty for my taste but overall a hit with the family!
