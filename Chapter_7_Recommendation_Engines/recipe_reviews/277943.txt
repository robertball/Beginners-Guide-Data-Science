Guess I am the first. A very tasty and hearty soup perfect for the damp cold nights we having here now. The ingredients called for garlic powder, but nothing more mentioned of it in instructions. I opted to add during the second stage, when adding adding the bacon and cheese to the mashed potatoes. Will definitely be making again.

Made a larger batch than the recipe called for, left out the carrots and vinegar and used chicken broth to achieve a nice, creamy, hearty consistency.   Flavor was perfect, very much like restaurant-quality.

I used a white onion, two boxes of chicken bouillon to make it more soupy, chopped tops of one bunch of green onion for color, and one clove of shallot.  The shallot ready adds a wonderful nuisance to the overall flavor.
