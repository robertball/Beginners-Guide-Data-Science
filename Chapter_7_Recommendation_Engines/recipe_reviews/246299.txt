This was  yummy.. good basic recipe that can be jazzed up or kept as is.. Only change I made was cooking the meat and veggies together.. I didn't see the point of using two pans

Delicious.  My adult daughter who knows a good chicken cheesesteak said this was really good!  Thanks for this recipe.

I leave out the onions and peppers for the kids. Once I serve them I add peppers in. We make this at least once a week! Super quick and delicious!
