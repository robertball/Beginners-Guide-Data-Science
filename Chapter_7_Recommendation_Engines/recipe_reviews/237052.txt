Very thick. Not sure that it's cheaper than buying pre-made.

Way too thick to pour.  I had to add about a half cup of milk to get it to pour out a little.  By it's self super good (how can it not be with caramel and chocolate) but didn't work for me as coffee creamer.   The picture I took is after the extra milk was added.

Too thick and sweet for my liking but my husband loved it. I might suggest using half and half instead of whipping cream to thin it down some.
