Great recipe. Have made it for Thanksgiving for years. Grandkids still like it topped with marshmallows, so do it with half pecan topping and half topped with marshmallows. Everyone is happy.

I reduced the recipe down to use one potato and  I used one whole egg since quartering the recipe meant that it called for 3/4 of an egg.  I wrapped my sweet potato in foil and baked it since that tends to make it sweeter than boiling.  There is WAY too much sugar in this recipe.  Wow!  I don't think the sugar in the potatoes is necessary.  If I make this again, it will be with at least that change.

I made this as the recipe called for.  It is the best recipe Ive ever used. I would definitely recommend using the fresh sweet potatoes. As it makes such a huge difference

I made this recipe for my family.  I had 23 family members for Dinner on New year's Day 2020 and everyone absolutely LOVED it!  They kept going back for more.  This is now a new staple for my New Year's day dinner for years to come.

Everybody that tried it raved over it and asked for the recipe. The pecan topping created a thick, crunchy topping that even reheated well as leftovers.

Didnâ€™t add as much sugar as it called for. I would also have made it in a smaller pan the sweet potato mixture was a very thin layer in this size pan. The topping was good but the layer of topping was as thick as the thin layer of potatoes. I will make this again but I will adjust the amount of ingredients used.

Made  this for my family for thanksgiving. I don't eat sweet potatos so I can't say how it was but my family all raved about it. Even my 7 year old nephew who  usually won't eat it wanted to take dish home with him. Will definitely make again.
