This was delicious! I did have to use chicken bullion, and I didn't have any coconut but those were the only changes I made. My husband suggested I make it again and add some chicken to make it a one dish meal. I will also roast twice as many edamame and save half for snacking later.

This is a really delicious recipe.  One change, however.  When I originally posted, I said to roast the Edamame from frozen, so if you roast from thawed or fresh, it probably won't take the full 20 minutes.

This was wonderful and my six-year old son was a huge fan.  I was actually searching for a way to use my leftover steamed edamame, so I didn't follow the direcs for cooking the edamame.  I cooked the rice following the direcs in the recipe.  I added all of the seasonings to the coconut milk and stirred, then added the steamed edamame, the coconut flakes and the coconut milk mixture to the rice.  Stirred it all together and voil√°!  Lovely.  Thanks a lot.

Cilantro as a garnish really enhances the flavors!

This tasted amazing!  I'm quite a novice in the kitchen, but this still turned out perfectly.  I used chicken bullion and I ended up compulsively adding a bit more coconut milk (before even tasting it) because I love coconut milk so much.

I had really high hopes for this recipe after reading the other reviews, but it just didn't do it for my family.
