Made these as a second breakfast for my family...yes second breakfast as they eat quite a bit especially on the weekends. Because I was making these for children I used Baileys non alcoholic iris cream coffee creamer instead of the liquor. For my husband and myself I made the alcoholic recipe using only 1 1/2oz of Baileys instead because I felt 2 1/2 would be overpowering. Everyone loved them, kids & adults!! I am thinking of making this for Christmas and letting it sit overnight in the fridge then baking them on Christmas morning. Definitely a treat!! Great recipe!

This is really rich and good French toast. I think milk would have still worked fine and saved a few calories. I used regular bread and was able to make 5 pieces. The whipped cream is wonderful on top, but the whisk wasn't working for me, so I used a hand mixer. I used chocolate syrup instead of melted chips, which made it easy to put on top, and I used sliced banana instead of berries. I will probably be trying this again some time!

This was definitely a treat!  The recipe was easy and turned out delicious.  We were able to make 5 slices of French Toast with the mixture and used thick cut bread.  Next time around I would use chocolate syrup rather than the melted chips because it is easier and one less mess. Excellent!

This is fantastic!  I made as written and there was enough “batter” and whipped cream for four large slices of bakery Italian bread.   I added a pinch of salt to the batter and will add a bigger pinch next time for a little salt/sweet contrast.  After a halfhearted effort whisking, I busted out our hand mixer to make light work of the whipped cream. We topped with butter, maple syrup, and the whipped cream for a decadent holiday season breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe, Baileys!

It's a great recipe. I substituted Mary Hite Bowman cream liquer from our hometown distillery. It's more of a bourbon flavor and  a great variation. Apologies to Bailey's.

When I made this I added bacon crumbles. With all the sweetness the bacon added some saltiness that made a perfect breakfast.
