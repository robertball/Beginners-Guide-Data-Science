After reading the reviews, I decided to start with 2 bags of popcorn instead of 3 and that was the right move. As written I do not feel there would have been enough caramel to cover 3 bags of popcorn. I made these for Valentines Day so instead of shaping into balls I shaped into hearts and threw in some M&M's. My Valentine gave me two thumbs up!
