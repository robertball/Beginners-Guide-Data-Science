This recipe was wonderful. I mixed all the ingredients at one time & put dough in the fridge for 10 minutes.  I did my best to keep the dough cold in hopes that the cookies would not go flat.  It worked... they were Great. I brought them to my Daughters girl scout Valentine's party and there were rave reviews.  I will make them again for a GS meeting using HUGS.  I did not use the drizzle.

I made these cookies for a few parties and gatherings and they were by far the favorite over all.  I refrigerated the dough as suggested by someone else and they turned out perfectly.  I also made half with regular hershey kisses and the other half with caramel hershey kiss.  I also put some chocoloate chips in a plastic ziploc bag and placed it in a pot of boiling water for a minute or two.  I then cut a small corner and used the chocolate to drizzle over the cookies.  Just make sure you let the chocolate set before you put them in a container.

These cookies were very flat but tasty.  I may have done something wrong.  Will try again.

I got this recipe from the Hersheys website.
This is my absolute favorite cookie recipe! BUT unlike most women, I am actually NOT a major chocolate freak! I can't handle too much of it and too me the kisses and the chocolate chips are way too much. So I simply omit the chocolate chips from the recipe and they taste amazing!!!

This cookie is fantastic!! I made these last night and my husband and sister-in-law loved them. My husband said he liked them better than chocolate chip drop cookies (which is saying something, since chocolate chip cookies are his absolute favorite). They turn out like little chocolate chip jems. I drizzled them with melted chocolate and they looked wonderful. My sister-in-law thought I bought them. This is a definite keeper!!

I will definitely make these again. They were easy and really good. It does take some time to unwrap the kisses but I heard you can buy kisses for baking (already unwrapped!).

I got 2 1/2 doz. cookies. The dough wasn't as soft as I thought it would be, making prep time longer. I would also use only 3/4 c. of chocolate chips or double the cookie dough. I would also place the oven rack on the third slot so the bottom of the cookies don't get to brown.

Amazing cookies! some may be skeptical because there aren't any eggs but the cookies are fabulous anyway. i found that the kisses were hard to bite into so i made some without them and they still tasted great.

These are a great twist on the usual choc chip cookie but this recipe was far too sweet and floury tasting to us. Next time i am going to halve the sugar and add some spices for flavour.

Followed the recipe except I completely omitted the chips and added a few drops of dye to make the cookies pink. They came out looking like little nipples which were perfect for the breast cancer awareness bake sale. :)

I like softer chocolate chip cookies. These came out crunchy and flakey. They are more like shortbread with chips in them.

I just made this recipe. Followed the instructions exactly as listed. And after 10 minutes, cookies were still not cooked. Cooked it for an additional 10 minutes, tasted one cookie and was still doughy inside. Let it cook a little longer and cookies burnt. Not sure what problem was, I followed everything, checked temperature of over with internal thermometer and everything thing seemed normal. Wasn't to pleased with final outcome.

These are simply wonderful - especially warm when the chocolate kiss is melted. (I heat them in the microwave for a few seconds if they aren't fresh from the oven!) My friends and family ask for these for every special occasion. I use dark chocolate kisses and they are divine!

Have made these twice and both time they got rave reviews!!  I use dark chocolate kisses instead of regular milk chocolate.

2nd time I also did part of them with Reese's cups.  I cup the mini Reese's in half and put a half in the middle of each cookie.  Worked great!!

I omitted the chocolate candy kisses because they were eaten by someone in the house so I added 1/3 more chocolate chips. I put the cookie dough for 10 minutes in the fridge before baking and followed other instructions exactly. It was my 1st time baking cookies and they were not too sweet and turned out great.

These cookies are very tasty but once they cool they are very hard to bit in to. The cookie part is fine but the Hershey Kiss feels like it might crack my teeth!

This was sooooooo good! (I made a dozen at a time) I only got to try one before it was all gone. It's best when it's warm and the kiss is melted. :)

Quite tasty and baked up nice and plump!  Dough was good too and if you're pregnant, like me, it's safe (no eggs) for having a snippet or two!

very good! I was able to get 30 cookies from this recipe. I didn't have mini chocolate chips, so I used regular chocolate chips chopped up in the food processor. Nice that there is no egg in this recipe, so my family can eat the dough without me yelling "no, there's raw egg!" when they sneak the raw dough!

I liked how simple this recipe was. I used Rolo's instead of kisses and the girls really liked them. However, the dough itself wasn't very sweer. maybe i did something wrong. I will try this recipe again.

These cookies are delicious.  Chilling the dough did help the cookies to stand up.  Ours were not flat at all.

Very, very, very good! I chose this recipe because I was looking for a way to use up some giant M&Ms someone had given me after Easter. So I substituted those for the chocolate kiss in the middle. Delicious! My batch made about 36 cookies, so I guess my cookies were a little small. I also refrigerated the dough blobs on the cookie sheets for a few minutes before baking to make sure the cookies didn't spread, though I'm not sure that was necessary.

We love this recipe and we just tried it with rolos in the middle instead of kisses, it was super delicuous, so i am guessing that you can also use reeses cups as well, the key is to make sure the entire candy is seadled in the middle. Super delicious, these are our fave cookies

I am giving it 3 stars because, although they tasted great, they were flat.  Also, whatever you do, do NOT use a chocolate kiss that has a center to it (ie - caramel or mint).  You'll have a huge gooey mess on your hands.

Somebody shared this on social media a few years ago and it's been a real hit.  My coworkers especially like the candy cane kisses in the middle.  You can buy those around Christmas.  As a bonus, this has no eggs, so if you're worried about eating raw cookie dough with kids, that's not a problem here.  Do notice the baking temperature is a little higher than usual.

I love this recipe! One thing I did change though is I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.

Great idea for a cooking project with kids! Simple and fun to play in the cookie dough. Plus, it's delicious!
