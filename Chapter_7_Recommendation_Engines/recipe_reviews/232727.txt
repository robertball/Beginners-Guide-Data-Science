Easy and tasty, and great to have something to do with fresh cabbage that doesn't involve mayo.  If you're watching calories, the oil can be reduced to 4 tablespoons instead of 7 and it's still just as yummy.  Enjoy!

Loved this salad. I also cut back the oil to 5 tablespoons, used apple cider vinegar and added  a teaspoon of tarragon, and substituted Splenda for sugar. The red onion is a must as it added so much flavor.

I chopped a small granny smith apple and added it to the salad. Added another layer of flavor that enhanced the flavors of the salad

Made it. Really easy, just remember to make ahead so the dressing combines with cabbage and onion for the great taste. Husband approved, said it was great, kept helping himself to more.

I was a bit worried about the amount of oil in this but the cabbage salad turned out perfect and non-greasy. I loved the taste of fresh lemon juice in this!

1 tsp salt is too much. I used a 1/2 tsp and it was still too salty. 1/2 red onion is too much onion. All you can taste is onion. Next time I'll use have this amount. Tasted like it need a bit more sugar and vinegar.

First, I'd like to say that I thought the flavor was sensational.  It has the perfect balance of oil-vinegar and doesn't need oregano, basil, and garlic as you find in most  italian dressings.  Unfortunately, it is so high in fat that it's something that will have to be an occasional treat for us.  I may try reducing the oil in an effort to get fat grams down, as I'd like to serve this more often.  The fat is an issue for me, but I'm giving this 5 stars based on flavor because it is good!
