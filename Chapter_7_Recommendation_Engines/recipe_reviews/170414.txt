This recipe does work but the cooking times and heat need to be revised. I was able to use this recipe after cooking the mixture for 20-30 min and by reducing the liquid to make it a thicker consistency. Then it was perfect. This does work, however it needs modifications to make it perfect.

Thickness is absolutely imperative to sweetened condensed (the operative word) milk. Genuine condensed milk had half of its liquid content rapidly evaporated in order to concentrate the milk solids significantly. Be aware that this recipe only provides for the sweetness of the canned sweetened, condensed milk, but does nothing to actually condense it. Hence, it will not work in recipes designed for sweetened condensed milk. This is nothing more than milk with sugar dissolved in it, and other than the sugar bears no resemblance to sweetened, condensed milk.

I read what others said about the thickness when using evaporated milk, so I substituted real cream for evaporated milk.  It worked perfectly!!  I used it in a recipe for home made hot fudge.  Wonderful!!

okay, if you want to duplicate the canned stuff for a recipe, you need to use only 1 C of sugar, and it has to cook in a slow rolling boil for 20 minutes, after you pull it off the heat, add a Tbsp. of butter, and it will taste and have the same consistency as the store bought stuff.  The recipe written is for sweet milk, not condensed milk.

If you're looking for a homemade sweetened condensed milk recipe that tastes like your average can of Nestle or Carnation, this is it, albeit with some variations. Three stars because this is a fantastic, fool proof base recipe.

The key to any good homemade condensed milk is the use of evaporated milk. Evaporated milk is treated differently than whole milk and cream so it's imperative that you stick with it! 

Anyways, so far I've made several variations of this, and found that 30 min, constantly stirring on medium heat will make this thick, but not fresh from the can consistency. Definitely more syrup-y.

What works for me, and has continued to work for me is using 1 cup light brown sugar or 3/4 cup dark brown sugar and 1/4 light brown sugar (I use the higher dark/light ratio for richer desserts)

Now before I came across this recipe, I used a recipe found on this cooking blog with similar ingredient ratios but a different cooking process. I tried their cooking method vs. this recipes and found the former created a thicker, richer condensed milk.

The key to getting your evaporated milk/sugar mixture rich and creamy is to constantly stir over medium heat until steam rises from your pot of choice (about 10 minutes). Continue to stir and reduce burner to it's lowest setting. Periodically stir milk/sugar mixture for about 1 hr until it's reduced to about half it's original amount. Pour into a clean glass/plastic container and allow to cool before refrigerating.

Yum!

I only did 1/2 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet. I constantly stirred this over medium low heat for 15-20 mins and it thickened fine. I used this mixture to make coconut macaroons.

I substituted evaporated milk( and powdered milk from other recipes on this site) and used what I happened to have in my fridge which was Fresh WHIPPING  Cream (35% milk fat)- its tasting Just like the kind youpurchase in a can! Currently its cooling in my fridge- the thickness like the real stuff too! Next its going in my homemade BAILEYS IRISH CREAM! Cheers*

I am not sure what the consistency of    Homemade Sweetened Condensed milk is supposed to be, but this did not look like the one out of the can. It was not thick at All! The flavor was spot on even tho it was the thin like canned milk is. Maybe this is good in a pinch. I wonder if the thickness is a crucial of a recipe? I will have to find out. Thank You for letting me experiment a little!!

I found this recipe after I realized that I have no idea what SC Milk is supposed to look like and what consistency it should have and what I had didn't look too good. The can had no date and I don't remember buying it, so out it went. I was cleaning out the pantry and trying to use what I had to make a dessert and fudge was the target. Luckily I had some evaporated milk. So I stirred and stirred and finally it boiled. I let the mix cool a little bit, but was going to use in with melting sugar anyway so I dumped what I need in the fudge pot and poured the rest into a pint jar. The fudge turned out great, which speaks well for this homemade mix.

Decided to make the Passion Bars recipe I found and made several years ago also on AR. Starting a baking project at 10 pm is pretty typical for me, but when I disovered what I thouht was sweetened condensed milk in my pantry was evaporated milk I was not happy. Fear not! Another enterprising cook had posted a recipe to turn the evaporated milk into just what I needed! So I initially followed the directions as written and while I waited for the milk and sugar to come to a boil, I read the reviews and decided to deviate from what I had in the pan.  I added a half cup powdered sugar, a cup of fat-free half and half, 1 tsp vanilla and cooked everything for 30 minutes, stirring constantly at a rolling boil. Placed in the fridge to cool ang voila! The result was a great tasting sweetened condensed milk without a late night run to the grocery store. Also, the bars turned out great.

I made this using whipping cream and it worked perfectly, used it in cheesecake and the result was great, will never buy store brands again. So easy, I just used my candy thermometer and let the mixture come to 220 degrees, cooled and it was ready.

I found that the evaporated milk didn't allow for the right consistency in the end; it was just a little too thin to pass as sweetened condensed milk, as others have noted. I used whipping cream in the place of the evaporated milk (12 ounces, just as the recipe calls for) and the result was a much thicker liquid. This was a great starting point, though. Thanks for the recipe!

Just finished making this.  Works perfectly as long as you boil it for 30 min.  It will still seem thin until it cools!  Thanks a bunch, I was in a bind!  If it wasn't for the cooking time I would have given it 5 stars!

This recipe is wonderful. I live 25 mile from town and was out of condensed milk, so I thought I would try this one. The only thing I did different was I boiled on a low boil for 45 minutes. Thanks to other ones that tried it and said it needed to cook longer to thicken up. Stirring often and kept an eye on it. It turned out just like the can stuff. Thanks for this recipe. I will make again.

This is the recipe you need to make great condensed milk, but I agree you have to cook it quite awhile to get it to the proper consistency. Other recipes I've tried just hasn't produced the better results that evaporated milk and sugar will get you. Nice to have a back-up plan if you need a substitute.

One of the reviewers mentioned that you should cook this on low heat for 20 to 30 minutes till it reduces down into a thick syrup. I would definitely do that! I didn't read the reviews as I was in a hurry and made the recipe as written. As written, this is not thick enough to be used in most recipes calling for sweetened condensed. I made a key lime pie recipe that I've made many times using the SC milk from this recipe, and it did not set up after baking. It looked too thin when I put it in the oven, but at that point, I didn't have many options. If you don't want to ruin your recipe, cook this 20 to 30 min on low heat (it can boil over) until it is the thick and syrupy consistency you are accustomed to.

Did as other reviewers suggested and allowed it to boil for about 30 min. before removing to cool. It worked brilliantly in the strawberry-swirl-cheesecake-bars here on allrecipes. Be careful, if you splash even the smallest amount on your skin you will get a nasty burn. I'll be more careful the next time I make this and there will be a next time! Wonderful recipe!!

OK I made this recipe.  I did make 2 changes though.  I added 1/3 c.  powdered skim milk,  for some extra consistency, brought it to a mild boil,  the lowered the heat to medium low heat and simmered it gently for 20 minutes.  I used a magnalite saucepan that was deep enough so the mixture would not boil over.  Not sure if that makes a difference. I think the key to thickening this is simmering time,  that's why I give this 4 stars. You need to simmer at least 20 minutes,  stirring constantly.  The longer you simmer, the thicker it will be.  End result is very similar in taste and constantly to what you get in a can of sweetened condensed milk.

I cooked it on low for 20-30 minutes, just how the ingredients are listed, and this recipe is fantastic!  In fact, it's better than canned sweetened condensed milk!  I can't stop eating it straight from the pan (leftover!)!  YUM!

This recipe saved me on thanksgiving! I had a recipe for a sweet potato casserole with a brown sugar and pecan glaze and the sweet potatoes required a can of sweetened condensed milk, which I forgot to buy. I used this as a replacement and my recipe came out perfect. Best of all, it is EASY.  No messing with powdered milk, blenders, or any of that other nonsense.

Queen B. Is right! Boiling it longer will give it a great consistency. And it's just like the real stuff.

It is not thick enough and will have a disaster on your hands.  Do not spare the expense of good sweetened condensed.

This was a great starting point!! I used Heavy cream and had it at a rolling boil for about 30 minutes(per other reviews). Made an avocado pie also found on AllRecipes.

After about 20 minutes on med-low heat (no 4 on my stove) and constantly stirring it came to a light boil.  I stuck my candy thermometer in and it came up to 220 degrees at exactly 30 minutes of cooking.  I completely cooled mixture at room temperature and it thickened nicely.  It looks and tastes just like sweetened condensed milk.  *note: I had 2 5oz cans of evaporated milk, so I only used 1 1/4 c sugar.

I  need to watch my carbs and sugar so I used Splenda instead of granulated sugar and it worked.  I just made vanilla ice cream substituting almond milk instead of heavy cream.  I'm anxious to try it for eggnog when the holidays roll around.

Thanks for a great recipe that fits into my needs

I followed the tips from others, added a TBL of butter and a tsp vanilla. I stirred over medium heat until it began to boil, then turned it low and kept stirring for 30 minutes.  Let it cool for 30 minutes then put it in the fridge until I needed it for my pumpkin pie.  Turned out great.

I LOVE to make homemade pumpkin pie with real pumpkins.  I had no sweetened condensed milk and thought I would give this a try.  But since my husband is a borderline diabetic and I try to watch the fat in our diet, I decided to make this with fat-free evaporated milk and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (you could probably use Truvia Blend, but I had Splenda on hand).  I used the 12 ounce can of low fat evaporated milk and HALF the sugar, as the Splenda suggests to use half.  I did cook it for the 30 minutes at a low boil as it thickened rather well after that time.  But you have to stir it constantly!  The pies turned out fantastic!

I followed the tips from other readers and added a tablespoon of butter and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I also stirred until it began to boil, then turned it low and kept stirring for another 20-30 minutes to thicken it up.  I poured it in a mason jar once it was cooled and stored it in the fridge.  The only problem, I couldn't stop tasting it...YUM!

Oh, by the way, Klueless I believe it was, mention this cannot be used in sweetened condensed milk recipes as it was just sugar and milk. I hate to tell you that is exactly what sweetened condensed milk is.......so how can you say this? In fact many countries use a version of homemade sweetened condensed milk to create many of their timeless recipes. So this opinion is unfounded. OH I LOOKED UP INGREDIENT LIST FROM BACK OF MILK MAID CONDENSED MILK, LOOK UP ONLINE IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT, I can't seem to post a photo of it. SAYS: INGREDIENTS: MILK, SUGAR. hmmmm seems you are wrong after all. So yes you can use this just fine in recipes ladies, gents.

I also allowed it to cook for longer and it came out great!!If you watch it close you can see when it reaches the thickening stage.I tried it with whole milk,evaporated milk,and heavy cream.All the results were awesome!! I even canned them as well!

I used brown sugar as recommended by another reviewer but I had to cook it for a minimum of 45 mins at a low boil before it even threatened to thicken. After it finally thickened, I added a dollop of butter and it worked seamlessly in my lime pie. I used nearly a cup of light brown sugar, but I think a little less would be fine as well. I am rating this 1 star because 20 mins would not be enough time to make this recipe. I put it in my pie mix while it was still quite hot.

So happy I found this recipe.  It's very easy to make and just as good or better than store bought condensed milk.  I cooked it for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly. Thank you for sharing.

This is a great recipe. I like to use it when I am making something that requires sweet condensed milk but, I need something to be sugar fee. For this I substitute light Agave syrup and whole powdered milk ( from Nido) in equal parts and mix. No cooking needed! Works great and tastes like the regular stuff =)

Yes I have tried this and I agree the cooking times needed an adjustment but it worked just fine.  I needed condensed milk for a recipe but I am diabetic and normally can't use store boughten so I made it with Splenda and my cream cheese pie looks great this AM topped it with SF cherry pie filling and can't wait to try for dinner tonight.  Can only give it 4 stars since I do not know how it will taste.
