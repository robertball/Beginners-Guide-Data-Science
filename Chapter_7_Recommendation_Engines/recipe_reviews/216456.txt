Oh my heck, after I giggled about twenty minutes over the title of this recipe, I got to work. I followed this recipe as close as I could, adding a teaspoon of baking powder and I used whole wheat white flour. I thought these were good, though next time I'd add some chopped pecans or walnuts and maybe some cinnamon or nutmeg next time. I didn't like the chocolate chips, though my kids and husband did. I'd like to try Hershey's cinnamon chips in this recipe next time. Quite tasty and they smell amazing while baking! Thanks for the laughs......and a new banana muffin recipe!

AMAZING!  My husband took them to his friends who couldn't stop raving about them!  You can barely taste the Jack Daniel's, it's just a tiny kick.  I also added 1/2 cup of walnuts.  YUMMY!

I really wish banana recipes would have a measured amount of mashed banana instead of a number of bananas. I used 4, but am sure that they were too big - even taking care to not overmix these muffins were really rubbery.  The flavor was OK, but the texture just ruins them.

What a great Banana muffin recipe, with just the right twist.  I did make a few changes.  used 4 good size bananas.  Also added banana extract in place of the vanilla and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts.  I found it better to beat the sugar and butter together before adding the butter.  Great taste and texture.  Thank you for sharing.

Just made these with my children. They're really good and not too sweet. The only thing I changed was I used almond extract because I was out of vanilla.

It's a great recipe! I thought it worked well with just 3 large bananas as well. Have tried a few batches and altered the recipe for St. Patrick's day by adding green food colouring to the wet mixture & substituting in mint chocolate chips. Instead of Whiskey, rum or Malibu are great options too :)

YUM!! Subbed Coconut Oil for the butter. Used 3 very ripe bananas. Subbed Cinnamon Chips for the mini chocolate chips. And Sweetened coconut instead of unsweetened. Perfect texture, very moist, super yummy.  Mini Muffins bake for 15 minutes.

These turned out really yummy! A little dark around the edges, but the middle was really moist. Just a reminder, there is alcohol in this recipe, so don't lick too much batter or you'll be drunk just like those monkeys! LOL

I made these and I think they are great!  I did toast my coconut which I normally do in all my recipes.  I just like the way it tastes toasted.  Next time I make these I am going to try using spiced rum.  I also made a cream cheese frosting and instead of flavoring with vanilla I used the whiskey.  Yum!  Next time I'll flavor with rum too!

Delicious, and makes me laugh every time I eat one.  Chocolate chip banana muffins are the best, who would have thought of adding bourbon?!  Made the second time with rum when I realized too late that  hubs finished off the bourbon...  Better with bourbon, still good with rum!

Yum!  Husband doesn't like coconut so I didn't add and didn't have bourbon - used rum instead.  And I made them gluten-free  (1 c all-purpose, 3/4 rice flour, added 1 /4 teaspoon baking powder). Visiting friend is GF.  While it looks like a changed a lot  I kept the ratios the same. Dough seemed very runny at first - might be the GF flour - but came out great.   Will definitely make again. probably not GF next time. :-)

I have made this a few times and EVERYONE loves them.  They make great jumbo muffins. I haven't added the coconut because the kids don't like it.

These were just OK for me.  I used Mailbu rum to get a more coconut flavor but I still found them to me bland.

This recipe was not bad .  My muffins turned out a bit denser than I had hoped. I used an irish whiskey.  I liked the flavor it added. It mixed well with the banana flavor.  I think I might try, again, using a coconut rum, and play with the recipe a bit to get a lighter muffin.

These were quite delicious.  Even though I was distracted while making them and used a full stick of butter instead of the 1/3 cup that the recipe called for, they turned out fine.  I also added a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  They were easy enough to make and I can't wait to make them for a gathering.

These were just OK. The Jack Daniels didn't seem to add anything to the muffins and the addition of the coconut and chocolate chips made them better than standard banana muffins but really nothing special.

Made these last night and they are absolutely delicious!!!   I used 5 small bananas because that's what I had on hand.  Will be making these again and again and again.  Might try using peanut butter chips instead of chocolate next time.
