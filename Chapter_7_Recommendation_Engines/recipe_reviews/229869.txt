The whole family loved it. I had to change the scallops out for beef (sea food and I don't mix) and I used better than bullion beef and added a little red pepper for some kick.

This recipe was really easy and tasted great. I used sliced white mushrooms instead of shiitake mushrooms. I could not find dashi no moto. I also added the seasoning that came with the ramen package during the second step.

Great soup to jazz up my package of ramen noodles! I usually have a a few packs lying around for my lazy days in the kitchen, but wanted to liven it up a bit and came across this recipe. The broth is very flavorful - especially with the addition of the minced ginger and earthy mushrooms. I used bay scallops in this recipe and ended up adding more than just four scallops to each bowl. I would continue to make this recipe and maybe switch it up with some shrimp or sukiyaki-style sliced beef.

I made this twice yesterday! I didn’t have the paste it recommended (main ingredient was msg anyway) replaces it with mushroom seasoning. My sick family loved it! No scallops so I used shrimp. No Shitske mushrooms either and just used white. It’s a forgiving recipe. Saved and will make many times!

Well done recipe. Easy to make if you can find the ingredients. Couldn't find mirin, so I substituted with a sweet sake, worked pretty well.
