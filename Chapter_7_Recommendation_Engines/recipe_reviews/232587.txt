I didn't follow this recipe closely, but it doesn't have many reviews at the moment so I wanted to leave one the best I could. I was looking for a dairy free shrimp scampi type dish and came across this. Five stars for the idea, flavor, and amounts of spices and oil. I loved the olive oil, lemon, garlic, parsley, and red pepper flavors together. Changes: I used about 1/2 tsp of red pepper--even that might be too much for some, I suggest starting there or less and add more as needed unless you like spicy. I used 2 small squash instead of squash and zucchini. I substituted 8 oz of mushrooms for half the shrimp. I substituted finely sliced almonds for pine nuts--the crunch and nutty flavor was really nice in the dish. I substituted a can of drained diced Italian tomatoes and a handful of cooked asparagus that I chopped for the spinach. I used linguine instead of spaghetti. The combination I used was wonderful. One change I would make would be to add the pasta a little at a time to the vegetables and shrimp, in case you have too much pasta.

Limited the vegetables to mushrooms, onion and spinach. Seasoned with fresh garlic, herbs de Provence and Parmesan cheese. Used one sauce pan to saut√© vegetables and shrimp. Super easy and tasty.

My initial impression was that it would be too light; I was wrong!  We have leftovers for lunch today, yum!!! I made as directed, a little heavy on the pine nuts because I like them. I lightly browned the pine nuts before adding other ingredients. The hot pepper flakes added lots of flavor and just a slight heat. Thank you for this fantastic recipe, I look forward to making again especially when my garden veggies come in.

I added a can of fire-roasted tomatoes instead of the spinach, and a small diced shallot with the garlic. AWESOME!!!
