This was really good.  I chopped the plum tomatoes bruschetta style, added shredded cheese, and drizzled olive oil over the bread and used a little less pesto.  Yum!

I liked this a lot as an appetizer-- it would also work well as a light dinner.

YUMMY!!  Definitely a keeper.  I made mine without the black olives, but it was absolutely wonderful!

I think this was very good.  Everyone at a going away party enjoyed it, especially the Italians.  Next time I will probably use homemade pesto instead and I think less mozzerella.  There seemed to be a little too much cheese that overpowered the other flavors.  Makes a good amount for appetizers and still a very good recipe.

Thanks for reminding me of this recipe!  I have been making it for a few years (found it in a Kraft recipe book) and it is always a hit.  I prefer to use DiGiorno garlic pesto when I can find it, or add minced garlic to the spread.

This receipe was excellent. I was going to a picnic and found this, everyone ate every last piece and it was extremely easy to make. I left out the olives but I may add them back in next time and I only needed 5 plum tomatos.

Very simple and hearty, a big hit at a recent party.  I used french bread instead of italian and the french didn't hold up very well.

I served this as a side dish to a lasagne I made & everyone was eating this instead of the lasagne. It was very good. The only Italian bread I could find had seasme seeds on it & people thought that added to the flavor. I left out the olives and used a little less mozzarella due to the tastes of my family. It's a very versitile recipe.
