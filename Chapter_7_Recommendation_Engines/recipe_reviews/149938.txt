I never thought about making pozole in the crockpot until I came across this recipe!  It's just as yummy cooked this way.  The only change was that I added some pieces of chicken to the soup - that is how we've always made our pozole, a mix of pork/chicken.  And I add a bit more fresh diced garlic since we love it.  We serve our soup in a big bowl, add a scoop of refried beans( it thickens the soup) and add condiments - chopped onion/green onion/chopped cilantro/a pinch of oregano/a twist of some lemon or lime slices to taste.  Delicious, filling, comfort food.  Serve all year - not just for New Year!

Knowing how to make traditional posole, I was skeptical of this recipe. I used chicken rather than pork because that's what I had. Being what I call a 'Throw Together' recipe (something you make from premade, usually canned seasoned items), this is really quite good. My entire family loved it. My father-in-law even duped my mother-in-law's dinner plans to stay for the soup (gotta love that!) and had several servings. I'd say, that makes this a pretty good recipe!! Thanks for sharing a much quicker version of this great soup!

This recipe was SO good! My husband is mexican and he loved it! The only thing was that it needed a little more salt, but other then that, it was great!

WOW!  This soup is fantastic.  I made a few changes based on other postings.  I only added a cup and a half of water, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon of cumin (instead of 1/2 teaspoon cayenne), mild enchilada sauce (still very spicy), only 1 and a half cups water, and 1/2 cup of cilantro.  When I served it, I served it with lime and chili refried beans, cheese, sour cream, and chives.  I am from Santa Fe New Mexico and have had many versions of Posole, and I think this is the best!  Thank you for the recipe.

To sum things up, I'm a white girl and my husband is Mexican. He's used to his mom's pozole, so I was nervous about making this. To my surprise, he loved it! Even called is family to say how good I can make pozole. Next time I may leave out the onions. It added to the flavor, but the onion slices aren't traditional and threw us off a bit. I also made this a little more simpler by eliminating the step of cubing the meat. I added a whole pork loin.  It falls about eventually, so I didn't see the need for cutting it. I also added more hominy and a packet of Goya Sazon seasoning (that stuff is great in/on almost everything, it's a secret ingredient I use often).

I usually make Posole from scratch and was pleasantly surprised that this "throw-together" version turned out so well. I would recommened cooking it the day before so that the flavors blend and soften. I used chicken broth and chicken and servered over shredded cabbage. I served with traditional accompaniments: lime wedges, radishes, cabbage, dried oregano and chili sauces. It really turned otu great! I did use a "gourmet" brand enchilada sauce from our upscale neighborhood store. Next time, I'll try it with green enchilada sauce.

Quick and easy. I used a powdered enchilada mix that adds tomato paste and water. It doesn't seem as spicy to me and easier on the kids.  I don't recommend adding the extra water. Mine was too watery for me. And next time I think I will add the hominy more towards the end so that it stays firmer.

This is excellent. I made it with homemade chicken stock instead of water. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I recommend using mild or medium spicy enchilada sauce.  I used spicy hot and it was way too spicy.

This was very tasty. I used both green and red enchilada sauce. I agree that you don't need all the water. I added a can of corn and a can of pinto beans to reduce the "soupiness"..thus adding more flavor.  I served it over brown rice with shredded cheddar cheese on top.  This is better than any I've had in the Santa Fe restaurants.

Loved this soup! I've only made the original version once and it was great but time consuming. This took very little time. I prepped it the day before and left it all in the crock pot overnight then added the water and turned it on when I left for work in the am. I diced the onions finely and used less water as per some reviews. Added more hominy because I really like it. You really need the garnishes. The lime and cilantro especially added to the flavor. My friends raved about it the next day when I brought left overs to work. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

WOW WEE! This is soooo good! I used chicken (didn't have any pork), and substituted chicken broth for water (like I always do in soups). One note of caution....I used mild enchilada sauce, and it was still extremely spicy, but I love spicy. Just  wanted to give fair warning!

Loved it!  Followed the recipe, but sliced the meat in medallion pieces rather than in chunks. I have 3 young ones and only one ate everything. The meat was tasty however, the sauce is what was too spicy for the other two kids. Served with fried plantains and will definitely be making this again.

WOW!  What a delicious meal this made!  I cooked it on the stove top about 3 hours on low and reduced the enchilada sauce to one can and used 4 fresh tomatoes chopped instead.  The flavors were a lot more complex than I imagined they would be.  I fried up some corn tortilla strips (about 1/2 inch by 2 inches) and topped the soup with them as well as an avocado slice and some crumbled queso fresco (Mexican white cheese).  Chopped onions, fresh cilantro, shredded cabbage and chopped jalepenos can be used on top to garnish)

Loved this!. I did alter it a little. I used Chicken broth instead of water. Had no Cayenne so used 1/2 teaspoon cumin & 1/2 teaspoon Chili powder. I used my blender to liquify/mix the onions, garlic & chillies(I used canned diced chillies) with a cup of chicken borth so that soup was more brothy. I also used pork & chicken. Was spicy howver since it cooked down I just added a little more broth to lighten it up a tad bit. *Next time I will double the hominy since not enough. I am making this again New years Eve so I can snack on it all day! Yum! My son in law & his brother loved it & said they were surprised tasted so close to real posole...

Yum! This was really good!!! My hubs prefers Ken's kickin' posole, but then again, he isn't the one slaving over the stove to make it lol. :-) I agree. Ken's posole is much more sophisticated (for lack of better words...). It has multiple layers of flavor - and a laundry list of steps to achieve that. For a simple, throw together posole, this is just fine for me. Since I had a leftover pork loin roast handy, I halved this (I made Lancaster County pork and sauerkraut last night, and to my surprise, the roast I purchased was conveniently cut in half, allowing me to use part then and the rest today). To impart a little extra flavor, I sauteed my onion / garlic in my pork juices and then deglazed that with a bit of chicken broth (why waste the yummy browned bits??!!?!?). I also used two (10 oz.) cans of mild enchilada sauce (I didn't want to waste half a can) and subbed chicken broth for the water called for. I added an entire 4 oz. can of diced green chilies and both yellow AND white hominy (my slow cooker was plenty large enough to accommodate). Garnishing bowlfuls with shredded cabbage, sliced radish, chopped cilantro,  diced avocado and a squeeze of lime made this extra special (all are cheap garnishes that add a LOT of oomph, IMHO). Warm corn tortillas and my hubby's homemade agave margaritas completed our YUMMY meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jules! :-)

Used frozen dry "posole" (corn cured with lime and salt that we can get easily here in NM).  It has so much more flavor than canned hominy and a great texture.  Also used one 14 oz tub of red chili paste, also frozen, instead of the enchilada sauce.  Served with LIME which is a must for us.  Delicious!!!

This is a great and easy recipe (especially if you get the butcher to cut the meat for you).  The smell when it begins to cook isn't too appealing, but it gets better, and the posole was wonderful. I didn't change anything about it.

A good recipe without the fuss of the original.  I've been making this version for about 20 years.  It never fails to please.  I do chop the onions rather than slice, and I add very little water at first, and then, if needed, I'll use the juice from the canned hominy.  Now that there is just the 2 of us, I'll make a big batch and freeze for a quick meal later on.

This was a very good recipe!  I would like a little less onion next time. I did not use pork tenderloin as I had a mexican shredded pork and beans left over in the freezer added about 3 cups of this and it was really good!  Topped with refried beans, chips, cheese, sour cream, and green onions.  Great for a cold night!

Spouse and I agreed 3 1/2 stars, but it did get better over time. The canned enchilada sauce made the flavor bitter intially, but it mellowed. I think I will try it again with spaghetti sauce,  chili colorado sauce, or a homemade or gourmet enchilada sauce. I will lose the sliced onions, either chop, dice or even mince they were too big for the spoon and overwhelmed that bite. I think i may saute with garlic then add to the crock. Overall good recipe, will be fun to play with, frugal calories wise and inexpensive to make. Thanks for the post.

This is fantasic!  My husband said this is the best dish I ever made. Based on other comments I made a few additions.  I used 1 Anaheim pepper and one jalapeno pepper then sauteed the onions,peppers and garlic in the pan the pork was in.  I used low sodium chicken broth in place of water and added one teaspoon of cumin. Served with shredded cabbage, diced onion, sliced avocado and slivered radishes.  Next time I'm going to try with Chicken.

This recipe calls for WAY too much water.  The flavoring was good, but definitely watered down.  Not sure that I would make it again; surprised at how it turned out since the reviews were so good.

This is absolutely delicious...I omitted the cayenne pepper and substituted one roasted, peeled and diced each jalapeno and poblano peppers, and added a few shakes of cumin. Glad I used the mild enchilada sauce! The peppers I added gave it the perfect kick. Eating it make me sweat just a little bit....perfect. Tomorrow I'm going to make Fry Bread to go with the leftovers...yum.

This was easy, and decilicious and crazy hot/spicy.  I will definitely make it again, but with half the spice.  We thought we liked spicy until I made this!  Despite the spiciness, the mixture of flavors in this dish are unique and very good.

I made this recipe as written and it was wonderful.  My son, who professes to be a chef and always ready to try something new, said it was better than the one he got at a Mexican Restaurant.  I made it on New Years and everyone loved it.  Could add more hominy, but is very tasty.

I have made this several times.  My inlaws are hispanic and I was nervous to serve it to them but they loved it.  My hubby raves about it.  I did change it to what we are more used to as they make the tradition pesole in his family.  In my version I used chicken breast, substituted chicken broth for the water.  I used the mild red enchilada sauce. I also did not add the oregeno or onion, but instead used raw onion as a garnish on top.  We served with tostada shells, onion cilantro, radishes,limes and sour cream .  This is truely a keeper. One of my all time favorite recipes.

I'm from New Mexico and I loved this recipe! I live in Tahoe now so I could only find mild enchilada sauce (which is lame because I like spice) so I added 1/2 a jalapeno and extra cayenne. Perfect!

We have a cilantro hater in the house so I left that out and this was still really good.  Used chicken broth per reviews, just one cup and half the cayenne with 1/4 tsp of cumin.  Topped with a little cheddar and sour cream.

I thought this was great for a throw together recipe!  Better than some of my friends handed down recipes.  I used chicken broth instead of water, a very, very large can of hominy (we like it!) and used the cilantro as a garnish with cabbage and limes instead of adding to the soup.  Also used hot enchilada sauce.....just right!!! Nice recipe...Thanks!!!  Very easy!!

This is close to the stew we would get when we lived in CA.  We top a bowl of soup with raw cabbage, radishes, green onions and a squeeze of lemon juice. It is awesome with no modifications.  Freezes well too

I think the key to this dish working is the quality of the enchilada sauce since that's where most of the flavor is coming from. Some of the more commercial brands may not have the quality ingredients to give it good flavor. I use one can of mild and one can of medium enchilada sauce made by Hatch, a brand that Whole Foods carries. I also use 3 lbs of pork shoulder since it has more fat and more flavor than the loin and remains very tender. I season it with s&p before browning it in olive oil and I add chicken broth rather than water to the cooker and an extra can of hominy.  Otherwise I follow the recipe, sometimes leaving the cayenne out if I'm having guests who may not like too much heat. The garnishes are essential to the success of the dish and should not be left out.  One last change is that I think the 6 - 7 hour cooking time should be on low. I've cooked it on high but only for 4 hours. I have no idea if this is authentic or not but what does it matter when it tastes so good?!?  I've made this several times and its always been extremely well received.

This is very good, but I'm not sure how it is any different than tortilla soup. I added two cans of chicken broth, but next time I will add a bit less liquid so make it more like a stew. I am glad I used chicken broth instead of water, it really made the broth taste richer. I also added a couple shakes of cumin after tasting, it really needed a little more flavor, I think it got watered down by all the liquid. You could change this any number of ways, I think I might add corn and celery next time also. Overall a very good, very easy meal.

Very good. I gave some to two of my friends from New Mexico and they both gave it a thumbs up. They were both a little shocked about the use of the enchilada sauce but admitted that it gave the posole a good flavor.

Ok, I will admit that despite all the positive reviews I was very skeptical. But...YUM YUM YUM!!! The only change I made was added chicken broth instead of water and I don't care for cabbage...so I served it over rice and added tortilla strips, avacado, and a touch of sour cream on top. Soooo easy and so good!

I'm onlly givin' this a 4 cause I did make changes to what I had handy.  I used frozen chicken breast and used chicken broth instead of water.  Used 1 can mild and 1 hot can of enchilada sauce.  This tasted more like a tortilla soup then a posole to me.  My hubby doesn't like cabbage so we just used tortilla chips, avocodo and cheese.  We both loved it.  We're both stuffed.  I will probably use this as my new tortilla soup recipe.  Thanks!!

Instead of pork I used chicken breast which I shredded and drumsticks. I added 1 tsp instead of 1/2 tsp of cayenne and added 2 extra large chicken flavored bouillon because it was a bit bland. Besides that it was very full-filling and I would make this again.

I want to gush about this recipe, because it turned out to be SOO good!!  I went to school in Mexico City and had been craving this dish, which Mexican mama used to make. This is very close to her recipe- savory and delicious- to say nothing of easy! I used center cut boneless pork chops and cut into cubes and split the enchilada sauce into half mild (frontera red chile flavor) and half medium (chi chis brand). Only cooked 4 and 1/2 hours on high as I didn't have time to cook it longer. Meat was still tender in shorter time but cook longer if you can to allow time for the flavors to meld. Left out the chilis 'cause I didn't have any but added dry red bell pepper flakes and changed the onions to diced instead of sliced. Subbed beef broth for water, and added the fresh cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime juice just before serving. Don't change the spices - they are perfect! Muchas gracias - es una receta fabulosa!

We used mild green chilis, mild enchilada sauce, and skipped the cayenne pepper and it was still a little spicy for my husband and 2 year old. The two year old still ate 2nds even though complaining the whole time that it was hot. haha. Really yummy, we garnished it with shredded cabbage which was yummy yummy. We unfortunately didn't have any limes, and it felt like it was missing something so I'm sure that would have made it perfect.

Absolutely delish.
First time I made it, made exactly as written, superb!
Made it again tonight, but used green enchilada sauce vs the red, and I'm thinking I may like green better.
I did use chicken broth in lieu of water...
Make sure you dont skimp on the seasonings.

This was incredibly good!!  I followed the recipe closely- with a minor change or two.  I sauteed the onion and garlic before I added it to the crock pot.  I used three 10 oz cans of enchilada sauce- 2 mild and 1 medium.  Instead of fresh green chilies, I used a can of diced green chilies.  I opted out of the cayenne.  We like spicy, but we don't like HOT.  I served it with flour tortillas, shredded purple cabbage, avocado, more cilantro, and sour cream.  Excellent meal, and even better the next day.

This was excellent! A very hearty, authentic, flavorful, stew! I changed it slightly for personal tastes! I used pork and chicken cutlets. I used mild sauce and mild green chilies. I only used 1/2 the oregano and I added 1/2 tsp cumin. I served it with refried beans, cheddar cheese, sour cream and chives...and some homemade italian bread to soak up the broth! This meal hit the spot! Great recipe!

As written I'm giving it four stars. I found it to be very spicy, which is perfect for me but as I was serving it to guests, I would have preferred it a little milder. Also, as other reviewers had mentioned, there is a lot of liquid. Instead of eliminating liquid, I doubled the hominy, added a can of corn and a can of refried beans halfway through cooking. I also added a can of diced tomatoes in lime juice, as my enchilada sauce was green and I found it needed more color.  I found these additions gave the Posole more substance, took away some of the spice and thickened the soup just enough. It was really quite delicious. Will surely make again.

I had never eaten Posole before, but my husband likes it so I figured I'd try this recipe. I used 4 pounds of pork carnitas (we love meat, and the carnitas was half the price of the pork loin), used dry enchilada mix, added another can of hominy, and forgot the oregano lol. It came out great! The kids ate it up, and my husband LOVED IT! The only downside to this is he said now I have to make it every weekend lol.

I made this on a Sunday for dinner for my son, friends boyfriend and friends and they LOVED it!!!!!!! My girlfriend’s boyfriend is Mexican and could not believe how good it was. He said it was like eating his mom's Posole and took some home :)... I used Chicken instead of pork and chicken broth instead of water like some ppl suggested....

This was a good recipe and my husband and his grandparents loved it. I'm giving it a four star rating instead of five because I didn't like how the enchilada sauce tended to separate from the water once it starts to cool and I didn't use the green chiles. However, I'm used to posole made from scratch so I'm biased. As a throw together recipe it was good though.

This is delicious. BUT make sure to use the  Ten Minute Enchilada sauce from this website. It takes no time at all and tastes a thousand times better. No preservative taste! We ate this in tortillas with sour cream and cheese...

This nothing like Mexican Posole..Reading other reviews told me too many changes had to be made to this recipe. I followed the recipe and it was awful. Didn't care for the canned enchilada sauce. Not a good recipes.

This was incredibly flavorful! I used homemade enchilada sauce rather than canned, and cut the water per a couple of other comments but otherwise followed the recipe. Very yummy, thanks!

I was skeptical to make this recipe as I am used to the authentic homemade posole that my mother-in-law makes. WOW!! I am pleased to say that this tasted just like hers! I cannot believe how authentic it tastes and how easy it was to make. I followed the recipe exact only changing things that other reviewers suggested. I used 1 anaheim chile pepper and found it was the perfect amount of spice. Instead of water, I also used organic chicken broth and used no cilantro and made with chicken breasts. I also substituted 1 TBS onion powder for the raw onion. I ate it traditionally served with shredded cabbage, diced onions and radishes and a squeeze of lime juice and tapatio with tostadas on the side. Excellent! I already can't wait to make another batch :)

This was scrumptious. The pork was very tender. It will be a new regular addition to our menu. I added just a little water until it covered most of the other ingredients. In the last 30 minutes I added about 3/4 cup of refried beans and about 1/2 cup of black beans, just because they were leftover from a previous meal.

I would have given it "5" stars if it were my recipe, lol. I come from Latin heritage and this is a GOOD recipe (-I didn't tell mom about it). I prefer to cook it slower...but all in all a fine recipe. If you enjoy Latin food and have never had posole, then you MUST try this.

This is an all-time favorite in our house!  I make a double batch at least twice a month.  I make it vegetarian by omitting the pork (and oil).  I use green enchilada sauce and substitute vegetable stock for water.  We serve it over cilantro lime rice and sauteed bell peppers and onions, and top it with cheese since this is the way we fell in love with posole at that famous burrito joint...  This posole is better though!  Don't forget some warm corn tortillas to get every last drop from the bowl!

Very good.  I had the cilantro in the fridge but forgot to add it.  Used one can white and one can yellow hominy.  Will make again for sure.  I cooked on low for about 6-7 hours and it was perfect.  I don't think you need high heat for that period of time.

Fantastic!  The broth was really delicious and was even better when we added a little sour cream and some avocado.  When I make this again I will reduce the liquid just a bit as the flavor got slightly diluted.  Nothing a little bit of salt and lime juice couldn't fix.

This Recipe was perfection! The taste was amazing! I added about 1 C. extra of cilantro because I love it. I didn't understand why the recipe says (drained) hominy. The hominy I bought was in almost a paste form, there was nothing to drain. I fried up corn tortillas and served with lime wedges, lettuce, salsa and sourcream. I made a full pot and it only lasted my husband and I, 3 days! It's that good!

Very flavorful without being to strong for the culinary wimps in my family.  I did substitute boneless, skinless chicken breast for the pork loin.  I am always looking for a good hominy recipe, this is one of my favorites... and I will make this again.

So quick and easy as well as very tasty!  I was a little short of 2lbs of pork, so I made up for it with chicken breast.  Except for that and using more salt, I made as directed.  There is no doubt that I will be making this again and double, at that!

I have made this several times and haven't commented yet. I have played around with it. I always use chicken because we don't pork that often. Chopped onion works better then slices and i use chicken broth instead of water. I always had a can of green chili and a lot more of the spices. We like it spicy and hot enchilada sauce is mild for our taste. This is a great alternative to making it from scratch if you are in a rush.

Mine was spicy, but I think it was only because of the enchilada sauce I used was really spicy. But it was good! I had enough to share with the 2 1/2 men, my brother-in-laws and nephew, and also my family! Really easy to make.

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half because I needed less and used chicken instead of pork. I ended up doubling the seasoning amounts (bringing them back up to the amounts called for in 8 servings). I added an extra can of hominy and used chicken broth in place of water. At the end, I added a little chicken broth powder and tomato paste to taste. So good. Enchilada sauce makes this amazing. I've been making the Easy Posole recipe on here, and while it's good, this is even better.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  After reading other reviews, I also added and subtracted.  I omitted the enchilada sauce, but added 1/4 tsp. cumin, also the 1-1/2 cups of water.  We enjoy it so much that I make it twice monthly.  At first I made it with the chicken, then pork.  I'll always stick to the pork.  It's great!!  Highly recommend it, and so easy.  Then I served it with chopped cilantro and chopped onions    sandi

This was REALLY good! I took some to work for lunch as a leftover and a coworker begged for the recipe just based on the smell - she hadn't even tasted it yet! Thanks for posting this one!!

Wow!  Followed other users' suggestions and used chicken instead of pork.  Absolutely amazing!  Also added fat-free refried beans (for additional protein) and served with shredded cabbage, cilantro (we put those into our soup bowl BEFORE adding the posole, to soften them a bit--great flavor), avocado and limes.  Added extra hominy to stretch it even further.  My husband loves this soup!

Great recipe and even my husband whose family makes this every New Years loved it.  I used chicken broth instead of water and it had a great flavor.  The best Posole recipe I have ever used.

I prepared as written and it was awful.  Tasted like canned enchilada sauce.  Way too thick.  Too spicy.  This CA girl says MEH.  If you try this I recommend substituting half the enchilada sauce for chicken broth.  I would not add hominy until the last hour.  also add additional hominy.  Better yet, find a recipe that doesn't use canned enchilada sauce.   What a waste of money.

This is the easiest Pozole recipe ever!! It is VERY streamlined and I liked that.  It tasted no different then the other way which involves soaking the Ancho Chile's. In fact it was REALLY tasty!!  I did read through the other reviews and I found them to be VERY helpful! I cut down on the water a lot and only added enough to just cover the pork and I cut down on the Cayenne and I used the tip in hurleygirly2002's review about adding Cumin and less Cayenne and it was perfect! I used Pork. Others have used Chicken. It works with both. You can also add Turkey instead, there is such a thing as Turkey Pozole. I will continue to use this recipe over and over!

I am a novice in the kitchen know my way around the grill. Thought I would try this doubled the recipe because we eat hardy here. Set it up before work it was super simple and after shoveling snow all day to come home to this was awesome made me look like a big shot.

Love the slow cooker tortilla soup recipe on this site, but wanted another good soup for those cold days.  This looked like a great alternative. Sometimes all of the changes in the reviews make my head spin, so I made this almost as written to build my opinion. We really liked this.  A thicker, spicier alternative to the tortilla soup's brothy consistency.  I thought hominy was supposed to be corn-like, but found it to be almost more like a potato.  A perfect mix with the pork (although chicken would be great too).  The main thing I strongly recommend everyone do is use chicken broth instead of water.  It's an easy change but makes soup so much better (if you haven't used chicken base, it will change your life). I poured in about 2 1/2 cups.  I think pouring to the top would be too much.  I used Old El Paso medium enchilada sauce, and it was excellent.  However, after reading so many "too hot" reviews with medium sauce, I left out the cayenne.  Even though I like it hot, I'm glad I left out the cayenne for my wife and daughter.  Still had a good bite, but the cayenne would have been too much for them.  Depending on your preference, I think maybe one more can of hominy would be fine.  You can start with 2, and decide close to the end if you want to add another.  Lime wedges, shredded cabbage and chopped onion are a must.  Thinly slice radish is nice too.  Traditionally, you serve the pazole, and have bowls of garnish for people to add as they like.  Yummy!

Add a third can of hominy if you love hominy. Could substitute chicken for the pork without noticing.

My husband is Mexican, we've been married for 21 years, and I have never made this for him.  I made it 2 nights ago and he LOVED it!!!!!! In fact he wanted me to bowl some up and send it with him to work for someone else.  (He is always telling this guy I'm white but by the way I cook you'd think I was Mexican)... He told me if the guy tastes this he will for sure think I'm Mexican and not white!!!!  Haha

I've never made because I thought it would be hard to make, but this was easy and really good. My brother wants me to make it all the time now. My fiance and his mom are El Salvadoran and they loved it. My mother in law said now this is how you make it. When your mother in law approves then must be good. Thank you. Actually making tonight again. =)

Oh My Goodness!! This was absolutely amazing! Whenever I go out for mexican I always order posole. I love it! I never knew how to make it and when I found this recipe I was sooo excited to try it out! My fiancé and I were both in heaven! I was very impressed by this recipe. It was simple and tasted amazing! I did not add the green chiles which im glad I didnt because the spice was perfect and I think if I wouldve added the green chiles it wouldve been too spicy. Also I only added just a bit of cilantro toward the end of cooking then added a bit more to the individual servings. I served it with cabbage, onions, lime, and cilantro with corn muffins on the side! Yum! This is definitely a keeper and this is a great winter recipe! Thanks so much!

Fantastic posole. I did add chicken stock instead of water and will take someone's advice next time and add 1/2 cup cilantro, but truly is fine as is. Family did not know the difference. The pork loin roast should be as good as possible, makes a difference. Serve with cabbage and spices and limes and voiila!

This was very good.  I added the juice of two lemons and instead of water, about a cup of chicken stock.  The enchilada sauce and the canned green chilies I used were "hot" and wow, was this dish spicy--next time I'll use mild or medium enchilada sauce and chop my own chilies.  Served over shredded green cabbage with tostadas, lime wedges, cilantro, and avocado cubes.

A five-star recipe with confidence. Don't worry about "too much water"--just add enough to cover ingredients. Don't worry about "too much pork"--it's a stew not a soup, and such things are left to personal taste anyway. I followed the recipe exactly and left it on the counter on LO for 7 hours. Added the cilantro for another 30 mins. Served it with the traditional finely sliced cabbage and a wedge of lime. The result was medium-thick, rich with meat and hominy, loaded with flavor and color. On the side served white flour tortillas, hot and puffy from the cast iron pan. What a wonderful dinner for a cold November week night. I highly recommend this recipe and will definitely make it again. It was perfect in every way. This dish is medium spicy. If you like less heat leave out the cayenne or use a little less enchilada sauce.

it was good and easy but next time I will use something other than hominy..  great cooking aroma too.  I used one can of red enchalada sauce and one yellow which had the jalapeno in also.  I used chicken and beef but think that shredded meat would be better also.

I would eat this once a week if my husband would allow it. In fact, I have some in the freezer right now that I'm thinking about having for dinner. Perfect served with some shredded cabbage stirred in with a squeeze of lime and a fried corn tortilla on the side.  Delicious and good for you, without the tortilla I guess.

Wow.  Despite the high rating, I was hesitant about this recipe.  Perhaps it sounded a little too good to be true?  I mean, talk about simple!  I used half chicken and half pork, seasoned them with salt and pepper and sauteed them before dumping it into the crock pot.  Then I sauteed the onions and garlic before dumping them into the crock pot.  I used 1/2 the recommended cayenne pepper plus another 1/4 tsp cumin.  At the end, I added about 1 cup of cilantro and did not add more salt.  I served with rice, more cilantro, and lime wedges.  Yum.

The soup was too spicy for my little ones, but they gobbled the meat out of it, along with the rice.  My picky husband loved it.  This is a definite keeper.  And healthy to boot!!

Thanks for posting Jules!

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly and it turned out wonderfully. My husband and I both loved it. We added both the posole and some rice to warm tortillas and wrapped them up like burritos. They were delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! Made this almost exactly as the recipe states just based on my tastes, but I'm sure it would've been just as good if I didn't change a thing. I used only green enchilada sauce and a mixture of white and yellow hominy. I sauteed the onions and garlic before adding them to the slow cooker. And I added the cilantro and a fresh squeeze of lime juice to each bowl as I served it. Delicious! Browning the pork before adding it to the pot and then slow cooking it all day long made the pork so wonderfully moist and tender. This one's going in my "make a lot" file. Next time I'll put some fresh avocado on top before I serve it.

This is soooo good!  I didn't know this existed until I found this recipe and I simply love it!  I've used pork and it was delicious.  I've used shredded chicken and it was delicious.  I did it in the slow cooker once and the dutch oven once and it is still so good.  This is my new spicy soup when I'm sick.  But the leftovers are so good too.  I can't say enough about it.  You must try it!

Tasty and filling. I didn't have enchilada sauce, so used an envelope of enchilada sauce mix with tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water instead. Used smaller amount of green chilies also because we are heat wimps. Substituted cumin for cayenne because I like the flavor better. Did not use cilantro because cilantro=yuck. Served with lovely ripe avocado, and wow, it was so yummy.

We loved this dish.  Very satisfying stew consistency, we didn't need to add beans to thicken as others before have mentioned.  We are not hot and spicy lovers and I was a little apprehensive about this.  I didn't add cayenne and used only a mild enchilada sauce, and a teaspoon of cumin.  Instead of adding water I added only a cup and a half of chicken broth.  We served it with wedges of lime, shredded cabbage and some crushed tortilla chips.  This by far is the best dish that ever came out of my crock pot!

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  The meat wasn't savory, even though I browned it as the recipe required.  The sauce just didn't do anything for me, either.  However, I have to admit that I don't like menudo.  I tried Posole instead because I was told it's similar to menudo but a better alternative for those who don't like tripe.  It could be that I just don't care for the canned enchilada base.  I'll look for an authentic sauce made from scratch & try it again.

The posole was a success!  My husband (who is Mexican) LOVED it.  Although it wasn't the same as his mom's tradition posole, he couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  I added 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth, a can of pinto beans, and some celery.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make this again!

I am always looking for soups to make that are flavorful and different than the traditional american versions. This was sooooo delicious. It was so easy, and the pork was so tender. Such a wonderful flavor! Thanks so much for the recipe, it's a keeper!

Excellent!  We roast at least one pig a year and I took the leftover pulled pork and made this soup.  The only thing I did different was add carrots to the soup for some color.  Very hearty and tastey!  Will make with the next leftovers too.  Great on a cold night with corn bread.

This one is going straight onto paper and into my most used recipes book.  I didn't make many changes, just used one 10 oz can of HOT enchilada sauce and one 14.5 oz can of mild (they didn't have a regular sized one of hot at my grocery store), and used the 1.5 cups water as recommended by a few others in their reviews.  We happened to have an avacado on hand, so I set out a little buffet of cheddar, sour cream, lime wedges, fresh cilantro, and avacado.  My husband made his into a burrito while my friend just set it atop some rice on her plate.  My son (3 years old) ate it with tortilla chips and everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks so much for this winner of a recipe!

This is very good, I made it with beef broth instead of water, to increase the richness.  It just took 1 can and then I did not add any salt. yummy.

OMG, this was FANTASTIC! I could only find a 4# pork loin, and I have a large crock pot, so I doubled the recipe and pretty much made this exactly as directed. I used half 'hot' red enchilada sauce, and half 'mild', and it came out pretty spicy. By the time I got everything in, there was no room for water, but that was fine. Still quite soupy. I topped with coleslaw mix from a bag, sliced avocado and a squeeze of lime as suggested. Find it hard to believe how easy this was. Tasted like restaurant-quality. Can not rave enough. THANK YOU!!!!

This was magnificent! I found out at the last minute my chiles had gone bad so I used green salsa instead, worked perfectly. Only 2 slight changes I will make next time: chop onions instead of slicing, and serve all of the cilantro raw as garnish instead of adding it to the soup. Can't wait to make a big pot for my friends!

This has become one of my favorite slow cooker recipes.  I have tried different kinds of enchilada sauce, and love how they change the flavor.  Corn muffins instead of tortillas make this a big hit at my house

Growing up, I use to watch my mother make it from scratch.  Watching her cut the meat and skim the top of the soup/broth just grossed me out.  Anyway, I decided to try a "quick" way of making posole since my BF was craving the stuff.  I have to say that this wasn't bad; it was pretty good.  I felt kind of weird eating it at first because I kept thinking that I was drinking enchilada sauce, but I got over it.  This recipe makes A LOT of it, so thinking I'll half the recipe next time.

This was BY FAR the best slow cooker recipe I have made in a LONG TIME!  It was rich, flavorful and hearty!  The ONLY thing I did was cube a large potato to soak up the wonderful broth.....Thank you this was an awesome recipe and is now in my recipe book to stay!

We love this recipe, although not traditional as others have stated, it is still tasty and very easy to put together for a hearty weeknight meal. I use chicken broth in place of the water and increase the amount of hominy. We also prefer green enchilada sauce over red - it turns out great every single time! Top with radishes and chopped avocado and serve with warm corn tortillas. So good!

The was very good and much easier than the traditional  posole I make.  I made it according to the recipe but only added 1 tsp of  oregano and added an extra can of hominy.  I hope that everyone trying this uses the traditional garnishes...shredded cabbage, sliced radish, lime, avocado, chopped cilantro. They really take the dish over the top.

A family favorite comfort food in the winter!  Follow recipe exactly and it will not disappoint.  Ease up the cayenne and the green chilis for a milder soup.  Serve with corn bread!

I am a total white boy and my wife is Hispanic and she loves pasole! So I decided to try this recipe! The first time I followed the directions to the T! But now I add more enchalada sauce and only one cup of water so that it is thicker! Put fresh cilantro, chopped radish, and cabbage slaw on top! Throw in my homemade tortillas! And everyone who has tried this loves it!!!!

I used two cans of Mexican hominy 25oz and where it says tsp for spices I did tbsp. I used hot diced chilis and 1 1/2 tbsp minced garlic and added salt to taste. I'd dice the onion next time instead of slice.

I may make this my standard posole recipe. I really loved it. I think my canned hominy detracted a bit, and will try to find dried, or frozen next time. I used a pound of frozen, roasted, Big Jim green chilies from New Mexico, removed some of the seeds, and the "heat" was just right overall. Also added some cumin, but I think the recipe is a great base from which to try new additions.

This was so freaking good!! I used about half of the amount of cayenne called for so we had some spice but it wasn't overwhelming. I look forward to making this again!

I was born in New Mexico, raised in South Carolina and fortunate enough to marry into a Hispanic family. I made this recipe for a Thanksgiving lunch as an appetizer for people to eat as we waited to say grace. I heard of everyone's mama's posole recipe, and was nervous this wouldn't match up. EVERYONE loved it! I used chicken broth instead of water, added an extra can of enchilada sauce, and shredded cabbage to serve with. I cooked the day before and warmed it up in the crock pot before serving. It was talked about as much as my husband's fried turkey. Would highly recommend in place of the traditional posole.

Wonderful posole. my auntie came from Mexico and I gave her a bowl of this and she asked for seconds. I did double up on oregano  and cayenne pepper because I didn't have the green chiles at the time. I strained one can of hominy and added the liquid from the second can. Used organic chicken stock. Best posole I have ever made, yes it's like that!

This is an excellent recipe that fooled my girlfriends brothers, who are from Mexico, into thinking it was their mom's home cooking.  The only thing I highly suggest is that you dice your onions, don't slice as it does not look or feel right in the recipe. Plus, add about a quarter to half teaspoon crushed cloves and a quarter to half teaspoon of cumin. I go to the local mercado and pick up meat that's still on the bone. Adds flavor and just as easy to brown....Make sure to serve with cold lettuce, freshly diced onions, hot sauce to mix in like Tapatio for those who love HOT, and squeeze a lime wedge or two right into your bowl when one served hot. LOVE this meal!

20th time making this- it’s awesome! Use La Victoria red enchilada sauce 28oz.I threw everything into the slow cooker: 1/2c chicken broth, shredded 4 large dried Anaheim chili with no seeds (or a few if want it spicey) 1/2 cup diced green chilis mild/medium heat, 4 cloves of garlic minced, 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp oregano, 25oz of hominy, 15 oz sweet corn and 15 oz of pinto beans. When I use pork shoulder I cut it into 1-2in cubes and sear in pan 2mins with onions and garlic then I put it in the pot (fat included) and cook on low 9-9.5hrs.  If I use thawed chicken breasts whole (2) at about 1 1/2 to 2 hrs before the end on high cook 3-4hrs time and added about 3 hrs before the end cooked on low 7-8hrs.  When done I serve this with shredded cabbage, diced onions, chopped cilantro, and sliced avocado with a squeeze of lime.  It is a huge hit and absolutely delicious!!

I love pozole. I did follow most of the recipe but I added changes. These changes were based solely off of the fact that I live alone and dont share my food. haha

2 lbs pork
2 cans hominy(mexican style juanitas drained not white)
2 cans enchilada red mild sauce
cilantro(didnt put it in only put it in single bowl use)
onions dice
garlic minced
cayene pepper
lots of oregeno
2 serrano peppers for kick diced
i did add water

the reason I dont have numbers of how much I used on everything was....I just eyeballed everything to MY preference. i used a lot(about half a bottle of oregeno in the beginning) as well as more after because I like it. I also used the big cans oh hominey and enchilanda sauce because I wanted a lot of stuff in every bite. i did add water because I like soupier pozole. i dont like it thicker.

i cooked it all for about 7 hours. Spicy and hot like a soup on a cold day should be. will make again!

it came out perfect. 5/5 rating for making it fast and fun. my first slow cooker recipe and review.

-Mike

Crazy good! I still can't believe how well this turned out . . . we absolutely loved it! I cut the recipe in half (as there was just 4 of us), and made a couple of adjustments based on what I had on hand. My can of enchilada sauce was only 10 ounces, so I opened the fridge to see what I could find to compensate for the 4.5 ounces . . . an open jar of Herdez salsa verde - yup, that'll work! I only had a 29 ounce can of hominy - so I added about half of it, filled the crockpot with the water, and then realized that the other half of the hominy would be fine, so I dumped it all in. I used a Reynold's liner to line my 4 qt. West Bend slow cooker, which made clean up a breeze. The temperature on my slow cooker goes from 1 to 5, 5 being the highest, and I cooked it on 3, so it wouldn't dry up all of the liquid. I did end up adding about another cup of water and 1 tsp. of chicken bouillon (skipping the salt) before serving, at hubs request (he likes more liquid). It was perfect! We will be making this often.

Overall, this was a good recipe. Used chicken instead of pork as we are not big pork fans. Just cubed and browned 3 chicken breasts in Olive Oil and threw it in the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients to cook (3 ended up being a lot, 2 would have been plenty). 

Only thing that was slightly off putting was that the red enchilada sauce turned the chicken very pink in color as well as the hominy. I actually used 60oz of Hominy. We liked the extra amount.

Topped with onions, avocado, cilantro, lime and cabbage. Butter tortillas on the side.

I do use New Mexico chili pods to make my enchilada sauce but for a quick Posole meal this works just as well with canned enchilada sauce and my home critics really can't tell the difference. When I make it with fresh or canned sauce I do add a teaspoon of powdered red chili and a packet of Goya. I agree onions should be chopped instead of sliced. Dont "fill" the crockpot to the top with water.  I don't believe the original poster meant to do that.  Just add enough water or chicken broth to make it the consistency of a thick soup. You can always add more as it finishes. Since I have an anti cilantro eater we use the cilantro as a garnish so everyone can get their personal cilantro fix which works out just fine. Lime, sour cream and radishes also a must for garnish.

Definitely needed more salt (maybe I added too much water?) and I think the onions could use a dice instead of slice.

My family loved this recipe. Even my picky daughters went back for more!!! My husband declared it PERFECT. I pretty much followed the recipe. I did use Medium heat Enchilada sauce, put in a large can of fire roasted peppers (they are mild) and just added a half can of green chilies (HOT!!!!)The second time I omitted the HOT green chilies and just went for a bit more cayenne. We served with refried beans and rice :) LOVE IT!!!

Used Juanita's brand hominy; consider doubling amount recipe calls for.  Used Las Palmas enchilada sauce, mild; diced up a green chili pepper.  Soup was VERY spicy!  Good served with guacamole, and I suggest sour cream (especially if you need something to cut the spiciness with).

This was amazing! Way better than I honestly expected! I made this exactly as stated except for the cook time since we are out of the house for 8 hours when we go to work. I combined everything like the recipe said to, and then just cooked the entire thing on low heat until we came home from work (about 8 hours later). Came out perfect! 

Just serve with some sour cream, diced onions, chopped jalapenos, and some avocado. I will be making this again for sure!

I cooked the pork roast the day before and roasted a chicken.  The next day, I chopped up the pork and chicken, added the remaining ingredients and let it cook on low in the crock pot for about 5 hours.  (I also used chicken broth instead of water) I served it by putting a large spoonful of white rice in the bottom of a bowl, posole next, then added sliced guacamole and a dolop of sour cream.  Very good on a cold day.  I brought some into work for lunch and everybody said the smell was amazing (they wanted some).  Thank you for this great recipe!

This has become one of my family's favorite dinners!!  It's so easy to make and really good!  I add a cubed, boneless, skinless chicken breast to the pork that is used.  I also use our home grown roasted anaheim peppers and corn (along with the hominy!) if I have them in the freezer.  Definitely a great dinner on a cold winter's night!

The enchilada sauce I used made this thicker than I expected.  I'm more used to posole the way my husband knows it (being from NM) which is more of a soup.  I found two cans of chicken broth and used them to try and thin it a little bit.  I used a 28-oz can of sauce, but what I would do next time is use a 14-oz can of sauce and 2 cans of broth.

This was really good!  After researching the dish, I served it with tortilla chips and garnished each bowl with sliced radish, green onion, chopped cabbage, chopped cilantro, diced avocado and finished with a squeeze of lime.  It tasted like something I would eat in a special mexican restaurant.   My whole family loved it.  It tastes healthy and is refreshing with added garnishes.  Nice winter meal but different from other soups and stews. **I have used several brands of enchilada sauce for various recipes.  I'm thinking that could make it or ruin it depending on what brand you use.  I like yellow can Old El Paso brand.  I used one mild/one hot...no cayenne pepper cause I didn't want it to be too hot.   5 stars!!

This is a delicious version of Posole. Some reviewers have called it "gringo posole," but it tastes exactly like the Posole I had in a small Mexican town! I made a couple of changes to the original recipe.  I didn't add much water, only about 1/2 cup. As it looked like it needed more water, I added the liquid from the hominy. I used 3 cans of hominy - one white & two yellow. I added 1 tsp. of cumin. I didn't chop the pork loin or brown it. I waited until it cooked for 6 hours, then I chopped it. The pork was moist and tender. No added salt. Served with chopped cabbage, green onions, radishes, avocados, and cilantro. We started with the soup and then added all the chopped extras. It was perfectly spicy and the crunchy additions made it colorful and healthy! We love it!

I love the crock pot & spicy stew. This was stellar. Quick, easy to assemble and reheats beautifully. I kicked up the heat a bit in the bowl, but followed directions exactly this time in the crock. Already have the ingredients on the shopping list for a snow day pot.

I had a flat pork "roast" shaped like a "7 bone beef chuck roast", most of these ingredients and no time so I threw this together in the crock pot. What a GREAT dinner it made! For speed I just browned the whole roast each side, threw two peeled and quartered potatoes in the bottom of the crock pot, half the ingredients, then the meat and topped it with the rest of the ingredients. Personnaly we like mexican without the spice, so we used 1 can hominy, 1 can green mild enchilada sauce and 1 can tomatillos, with quite a bit of cumin. (no red sauce or cayenne). You only need add enough water or broth to barely cover the ingredients. I called it my "posole style" pork roast.

Super delicious!  Husband loved it!  Instead of using water, I added beef broth.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe as recommended and it turned out fabulously! Not too much water at all.  I am sure it depends on how much meat you put it and I think I was a little heavy no the meat.  It's so simple but much better than a lot of the americanized pozole you find in the aericanized mexican restaurants!  Love it!

The only thing I changed with this recipe is crucial, I don't add ANY water at all. There is plenty of moisture with the pork and enchilada sauce. I make this all the time and everyone really likes it, I serve it with cornbread for a simple and complete meal.

I made this for work, and they were all so impressed they came back for seconds!  I did make a few changes, I used chicken instead of pork, and I also didn't use the slow cooker nor did I put in any oregano.  It still turned out amazing.  Will definitly be using this again :)

This was great, easy and really wowed my fiancé.  I didn't have time to brown the pork, so I just cubed it and threw it in the slow cooker raw.  Since the recipe calls for cooking on High for so long, I knew it would be okay.  I also decided to use medium heat green chile enchilada sauce... YUM.  The other changes were pretty minimal: added extra garlic, substituted cumin instead of cayenne (later added about 1 Tbs of hot pepper sauce to spice it up), used dried cilantro, and omitted the salt.
I was going through pozole withdrawal and chose this recipe because it was so simple... kept my fingers crossed it would turn out, but the other reviews made it sound great.  My mouth was watering the moment I walked through the door (one of my favorite things about using the slow cooker!), and it turned out perfect.  I like spicy food, and this was on the mild side even with medium heat enchilada sauce... the perfect starting level you'd feel comfortable serving to guests but able to build on by using extra hot pepper sauce or cayenne.  My only garnish (again, due to being short on time) was lime to squeeze over the top.  Next time I will try adding the shredded cabbage, diced avocado and minced radish as the alternately creamy and sharp flavors with the cabbage crunch should add complexity that would really up the ante.  
Either way, the fiancé and I were both very happy with, and it made a LOT of soup.  Can't wait to make it again!

Delicious, easy and healthy!  I might use a little less cayenne pepper next time and think I will search the site for my own enchilada sauce too.

I made this for the first time yesterday. I was missing a couple of the ingredients, but followed the general recipe (missing green chilies). It is really quite good, although spicier than the traditioanl pasole that I have had previously. Will definetly make this again!

This was so delicious.  We made it for a crowd, some non-meat eaters, so we made both chicken and pork batches.  Didn't have all of the ingredients, so we used half red and half green sauce in each, jalapenos instead of chiles, extra garlic, subbed corn for hominy, and homemade turkey stock in place of the water (added amazing flavor).  Served with avocado, non-fat Greek yogurt, limes, lettuce, tortillas and tortilla chips.  Everybody went back for seconds!  Thanks for sharing.

Yummy and so easy to make. I used green enchilada sauce and added the hominy the last hour of cooking. Added cumin instead of cayenne pepper. Served over white rice with sliced avacado, sour cream and home made tortilla chips. So good...this ones a keeper/

My family is in love with this soup.  Everyone thought I spent hours in the kitchen to make it, but I actually prepared and left it in the crock-pot before I left to work.  I did everything the recipe said, except for adding the green chilies.  I made pico de gallo to add, and fresh salsa.

I made this and took it to a gathering of friends and everyone loved it.  I really love chili but this spicy soup is definitely a nice change for those cold winter days. I added one can of black beans. I served it with shredded cheese to sprinkle on top if desired and warm tortillas.

My picky husband (who is half Mexican) and I both loved this super easy soup!  I made it with one can mild enchilada sauce and one can hot to get a nice medium kick.  I went overboard on the pork and my crock pot wasn't quite big enough to fill with any additional water, but it sure made for a nice chunky soup!  It was great for leftovers and I added a few splashes of chicken stock to the leftovers to give it more liquid.  This one's a keeper.

I made this for a potluck because the list of items co-workers were bringing were your typical, bland "dishes" and quick and packaged cheeses and dips. I wanted something a little more authentic to me and a change for something I'm sure my Midwestern colleagues aren't accustomed to having. I've made pozole over the stove, of which is usually a slow, fruitful process, but between a busy schedule I searched for a recipe that I could make in the crock pot (I've yet to tell my mother as she would probably have a dramatic, Hispanic mom moment -- she's not a proponent of crock pot cooking). I found this recipe and was weary of what could come about, especially with the call for enchilada sauce (queue Spanish soap opera music), but I went for it and decided to double the recipe. In addition to the enchilada sauce, I wondered why it would call for a pork loin roast. In my experience, any traditional pozole is typically made with a pork butt/shoulder cut as this cut will definitely absorb more flavor and cook to tender more easily than the roast. I stuck with what I knew and went with a butt/shoulder and decided to marinade the pork overnight using a homemade recipe of citrus fruits and a combination of complimentary spices. I debated the spices it called for because I wasn't confident that the flavor would come through, but I went with what the recipe was asking and adjusted throughout. I did't cutback on the cayenne or the green chilies (the green chilies actually added to the depth

This was a great slow cooker recipe.   It was easy and very good, rich and flavorful.    My husband loved it and I definitely plan to make it for my kids and grandkids.   The only changes I made was to use canned diced green chilies instead of fresh.   I also used chicken broth instead of water.  
The toppings of shredded cabbage, lime, avocado, and sour cream is a must!

Made my own red sauce instead of can enchilada sauce. Very good. Hominy is an acquired texture if you’ve never had it.

I followed the recipe exactly and topped with cilantro, shredded cabbage & avocado. It was so delicious. The flavors really pack a punch. It’s hearty but doesn’t leave you feeling overly full. The pork tenderloin literally melts in your mouth! So easy to make! Will be making this again & again!

We skipped the cilantro--we don't like it and we didn't have any--so I'll work some more on the seasonings, but it was a wonderful cold-weather warm-up using what's in the pantry and left-overs.

Tasty and not too hot! I used one can of Green Chile Enchilada Sauce instead of two, just 1/2 sliced onion, and added low sodium chicken broth instead of water, plus one Serrano pepper. I also sprinkled the pork with cumin before sautéing.   No extra salt was needed.  Just right for low-heat folks.

Super in love with a quick easy recipe! I used my pressure pot Ninja Foodi and I only had to cook it for an hour. My husband likes it spicy so I added ground up jalapeño, serrano, and habenero to it.  I read thru a lot of recipes and comments that all said authentic posole had a mix of pork and chicken so I made sure to make it like that. I substituted chicken broth. I like to eat it with fresh avocado, cabbage and lime! Tasty and quick! My friends fell in love with it as well! ??!

My first time making pozole.  This was a very easy version.  Instead of 2 lbs meat I did 4 lbs, There was plenty of liquid without the extra water (actually I didn't see that direction).
Second time making it I left hominy out until last hour.  Cooking whole time softened it and I like more texture. Still left the water out, didn't need it.

Thanks so much for this recipe! It satisfied the craving I've had for posole after moving away from New Mexico where I could get great posole and Hatch green chile everywhere. Complicated recipes and a lack of dried chiles where I am at now in the Midwest always kept me from trying to make it, but this recipe is so easy and tastes just as good by using enchilada sauce instead that I wished I had made this earlier. I browned the meat in the Instant Pot and pressure cooked everything for 30 minutes with a natural release for about 20 minutes. I used 3 packets of Frontera green enchilada sauce and a can of Ortega diced green chiles.

My husband made this with a few changes and we were obsessed! He added 2 poblanos, used a 3lb pork shoulder instead and just shredded it after it cooked, added a can of black beans and used one can red and one can green enchilada sauce.

This was a very good, very easy recipe. I increased the enchilada sauce and beef broth (instead of water) to roughly 40 ounces each, used 3 cans of hominy, and chopped versus sliced the onion. Cut the pork roast into 4 pieces and browned it and the onion/garlic before adding to the crock pot. I felt the original recipe ended up with WAY too much meat for the other ingredients. Added the hominy toward the end of the cooking time. Will make again and again!

My daughter-in-law is Mexican and she thought this was one of the best Posoles she's had.  I used 2 small cans of diced green chilies and 1 small can of jalapeños.  They loved it, although it was a little hot for me.  I also used chicken broth in place of the water.  I'm definitely adding this to my "go to" recipes.

I love this recipe my husband loves when I make Posole he's Mexican and says my posole taste as good as his mother's I made a few substitutions and additions that a few of my Latino mom  friends suggested and it was perfect 1st instead of water I used a carton of chicken stock  I replaced the cayenne pepper with 1 tsp Cumin and instead of pork loin I used 1lb of pork short rib & 1.5 lbs of pork neck for added flavor and seared them in butter instead of oil to seal in flavor. I also added 1 pckt of the Sazon Goya con culantro y achiote  season to the slow cooker. I love this recipe and hope you post more authentic Latin recipes  soon

I made this last week and guests and family loved it. I used mild enchilada sauce. The only thing I did different was to double the cans of hominy.  Lots of hominy adds to the traditional flavor. I put hot sauce on the table for those with a “spicier” taste palate.

I made this for an early Thanksgiving meal and it came out wonderful! This was the second attempt at this one and I nailed it. I did only use one can of the hominy and that worked just fine but should of done the correct amount of the red chili. Love my slow cooker recipes

Really good. Really easy. I added an extra can of hominy, a can of diced roasted tomatoes, and a can of black beans. Even with mild enchilada sauce, it was spicy ... added a quarter cup of peanut butter to bring the heat down.

Very good and easy. I blended many comments. Used only 2 cans of hominy and added 1 can of refried beans and 1 of pinto beans. Also used 2 chicken breasts at 1 1/2 lbs, added them whole and shredded them half way through with the hominy. Used 1 can green and 2 cans red enchilada sauce. Lime is key.

Some notes:

Check the ingredients on the "enchilada sauce".  Some brands are essentially tomato sauce, which turns out fine, but it's not Pozole.  I used La Victoria, and it was perfect.

If you like that chewy texture in the hominy, add it at the end, after cooking.

I used cubed pork loin instead of shoulder; it was a little tough.

I like that this recipe uses things we usually have on hand.  (Well, except hominy.)  That being said, I used a little less pork and subbed one can of pinto beans for one can of hominy and it was still good.  Even better the next day!

I didn't sear the pork in the beginning but it came out great! The pork is tender and nothing is overpowering. The only thing I want to change is trying to make a homemade enchilada sauce. Hope you enjoy!

Followed recipe exactly. Wasn't impressed. Never heard of this dish before so I didn't have any preconceived ideas about it. When it said to serve with "flour tortillas of course" don't know what I was expecting but this was basically soup; I'm not a fan of soup. Having something different for a change was good, but not for me.

I made some major changes. i smoked some Turkey legs and chicken and added to this. But I chose to add everything to a pot minus the meat and simmered for three hours on low and also added Northen White beans.  The smoked turkey and chicken adds a new level of flavor!

I used the stove rather than crock pot. I added cumin, Coriander and chili powder, twice as much cliantro, tomaotoes, sweet corn and garbanzo beans along with the hominy, I added avocado to serve with a bit of chive fat free sour cream and it was amazing.

My hubby asked that I used chicken instead of pork so I did (same amount). Followed the rest of the recipe as it is and it was delicious. Hubby said it was just like the stuff he had growing up. And of course we topped it off with avocado, more cilantro, and sour cream.

This was absolutely delicious, but as always I made a few changes. First, I never add water to a soup. All it does is reduce the natural flavors of the dish. Unfortunately, though I didn't read the recipe before I went to the store so I didn't intentionally grab a broth for this soup; I had to go with what I already had in my pantry. I used one whole box of Swanson chicken broth and a half of a box of Swanson vegetable broth, and I don't regret it. So good. I also used Old El Paso Enchilada sauce: one can spicy and one can mild, because my six year old can handle a little bit of heat, but not a ton--go completely mild for kids who are sensitive to heat, though. This was on the verge of still being too spicy. Lastly, because canned sauces like Old El Paso and broths like Swanson already add a ton of salt to their products, I did not add any salt. Trust me, it didn't need it. 

This recipe was really easy to throw together in the morning and tasted great. Yellow corn tortillas and fresh avocados cool down the dish a little and taste wonderful. Will 100% make this again.

I made this for the first time last night and my Mexican family loved it! I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used New Mexico Chile powder instead. I also added a bay leaf and ground cumin, and used chicken broth made with "Better than Bouillon" instead of water. I also used a pork shoulder roast instead of pork loin. I did not add the chopped cilantro in the last 30 minutes as some family members do not care for it (heathens!), I used it as garnish instead. In the future, I will chop rather than slice the onion. (The long slivers of onion floating in the soup were off putting. )  I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious!  I gave it 4 stars because I do believe that the pork I used infused so much additional flavor.   I had previously slow roasted a large pork shoulder butt roast studded with garlic slivers and S&P.  I had cut it into 1 lb. pieces, vacuum sealed and froze for future use.  Hmm, posole sounds good so I gave this a try, cutting the recipe in half.  Since my pork was already cooked with garlic, I skipped step 1.  I cut the pork into cubes, threw it into a 1.5 qt. slow cooker, added an 11 ounce can of green enchilada sauce that had been in my pantry forever,  a 7 ounce can of diced green chilis, undrained, and a 15 ounce can of white hominy.   I used Mexican oregano, chopped onion instead of sliced and a sprinkle of cayenne.  I also used low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  After cooking on high for about 5 hours, I decided to dump in another 15 ounce can of drained hominy to make it more stew-like and another little sprinkle of cayenne.  I let it sit overnight and cooked it on high for about 3 hours the next day to incorporate the additional hominy and cayenne.  YUM, this is a definite repeat here!  Traditional or not, it's good stuff.

This was an easier way to make posole.  The family thought it was pretty good.  The sauce had a good flavor but the pork was pretty bland.  If I make it again I'll make sure to flavor the meat before I brown it.

I really love this recipe. I did make a few changes because the first time I made it, it was a tad too spicy for me. What I changed was: I  subbed 1 of the 2 cans of enchilada sauce with a can of diced tomatoes, I also added pinto beans and opted out of filling the slow cooker with water to avoid a bland taste, I filled the pot with about 4-6 cups of chicken broth. Squeezed some lemon in there and it was delicious!

I made my own red chile sauce instead of enchilada sauce.  Added half to cook and will add more when serving.

Cookin' for two so halved the original recipe, but did add 2 cans of white hominy with 2 cups of water in the crockpot for 7 hours. Used Hatch brand products. So goood!!! Tortillas, green onions, shredded cabbage, avocado,  fresh lime...DELICIOUS!!!! I'll definitely make this again.  UPDATE:  1/8/2017  I made this again for our dinner tonight using 2 cans of yellow hominy. I think the yellow hominy has more flavor. Love this posole!!

Love this!  Of course I have to change my recipes to what I have on hand and what we like, but that doesn't make me rate the recipe low.  I used leftover shredded pork shoulder, and its cooking liquid from my IP instead of water, mild salsa verde, roasted garlic, skipped the cayenne, used Italian seasoning since I had no oregano,  and didn't have any cilantro.  I did use my own roasted ancho chiles.

This recipe is so easy and so good!  I even served it to a friend of mine that makes it from scratch and she loved it.  I did follow another reviewer that didn't use the chiles and doubled up on the cayenne and oregano and used chicken stock instead of water.  I will be making this more often.

I was worried about this at first since the house didn't start smelling like posole until about 2 hours before it was ready. This came out amazing though! The meat was perfectly tender, and it was just this side of spicy, so my 4 year old could eat it. There's a few steps I can tell other reviewers skipped that I think resulted in bad reviews. Do NOT skip browning the pork chunks, and make sure you don't use a small crock pot. My 5 quart was perfect for the right amount of water (to the top). I made a couple changes to this one, I left out the onions, I used salt and pepper when browning the pork, and added about 1/4 cup of refried beans to each soup bowl when serving.

I made this pretty much exactly as described except I used golden hominy because the store didn't have white hominy.  It was delicious!  I chose have it over rice with a dollop of plain greek yogurt and cilantro garnish.  Delicious!!  My husband raved about it

This is a favorite in my house. Very good recipe. I don't cut the pork before cooking it, i just shred it  up at the end. I like to top with avocado, radishes and lime wedges. Warm me up a flour tortilla with butter and I'm a happy girl!

This is absolutely amazing. I did change one thing though and substituted the pork with cut up chicken breasts. We ate it for dinner and then again the next night as well!

I made one change to the recipe....We use chili sauce the I make from dried NM Chili's.  The canned sauces have too much sodium & other additives.  Fresh is best!!!  Homemade chili sauce from dried chilis is so easy to make, and worth the time.  Changes every dish from "average" to "outstanding"!!

Like others have said, I have made posole from scratch before, so was skeptical, but willing and we LOVED IT!  Some thoughts . . . we used a combo of green and red enchilada sauce and more hominy.  We also used more of the ingredients all around to go with a roast over 3 pounds.  This resulted in not having enough room for extra water, and it was fine. We were tempted to not cube the pork, but were glad we followed the recipe - still very tender and melt in your mouth.  We served with fresh cilantro, cubed avocado, shredded cheese, sour cream and white rice for a dinner with friends.  A hit with kids and adults alike!

This is the best posole ever!!! My husband begs me to make this even in the summer time.  Did use a combo of green and red enchilada sauce.  Be sure to get a premium enchilada sauce for extra flavor.  Awesome recipe.

Did this with leftover roast pork and sauted the the onions at the beginning. With the pork already tender and the cooked onions I cut the total time down to about 40 mins (20 prep, 20 simmer). Enchilada sauce doesn't make an authentic posole but it's surprisingly good. Very strong effort to deliciousness ratio!

I'm surprised the recipe does not call for chili powder. It's what brings my posole together. I also skip the enchilada sauce.

So I tried posole at my Hispanic friend's party and have been craving it ever since. This recipe was simple, quick, and won the approval of all my Mexican friends. The only changes I made was substituting chicken for the pork and doubling the amount of hominy. I also added 2T of oregano instead of the teaspoons (completely by accident, but it turned out for the better) and added some cumin. All in all it turned out fantastic although next time I think I'll make it from scratch.

I was skeptical on how this dish would turn out, but it's actually VERY similar in taste to authentic Mexican pozole. I omitted the cayenne as the enchilada sauce is spicy enough and added a second can of hominy to fill my very large crock. My mother-in-law makes the most delicious pozole and my husband gave me the highest compliment by saying this slow cooker version is a good dupe for homemade. He ate two big bowls and said I should make it the next time his family comes to visit! Winner!

I normally make posole from scratch; however thought this might be  more convenient so I gave it a try. I am very glad I did. Being from New Mexico I used Hatch green chili peppers. I made the recipe as written and was pleased with the results. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

First time making this. Very good. Topped with shredded radishes and coleslaw and serve red with lime wedges.  Will make again but will add more hominy dice the onions instead of slicing and add a bay leaf.   Probably make a little more spicy

I used chicken broth instead of water. I also added 1 can of pinto beans. I also added about 1 lb of chicken breast cut into cubes as well.  This one is going straight into my dinner rotation.

I've had both traditional pasole and this pasole. Growing up next to mexican neighbors they made the traditional and it was more soupy. Despite not being as soupy I love making this version and my family enjoys it as well and thinks it's great.

Good base recipe,  Doubled the amount of hominy, and used 2 jars of 505 green chile sauce (one mild, one medium) in place of enchilada sauce. Also used half chicken/half pork loin and only about 1.5-2 cups of chicken broth instead of filling the pot with water...would have been way too watery with the pot filled. Will definitely continue to use the base of this recipe, likely with our own substitutes though.

My adjustments: I used mild enchilada sauce, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, diced the onions and put in a full pork roast that I later shredded. I was going to substitute chicken broth for water to get more flavor, but I was out of broth. I substituted 1 1/4 cups water and a bouillon cube.  I added 1/4 cup cilantro for the last 30 minutes. 
As far as spiciness, it's easy to tailor it to your tastes.

I made this today for the first time and it was delicious! My husband and I both loved it, so I will definitely be adding it to the rotation. I followed the recipe pretty closely.... only I rubbed the pork with 2 teaspoons of cumin before browning, added an extra 1/2 cup of green chiles, added 1 teaspoon of ground Arbol Chili powder, used fresh oregano instead of dried, and skipped the added salt. Thank you Jules for sharing this great recipe!- Jill

No major changes were made.  I used 1 can red (medium) and 1 can of green (mild) enchilada sauce and it was just right.  I did set out red pepper flakes and cayenne for my husband to add if he wanted.  Served it with shredded cabbage, sour cream and flour tortilla's.  We loved it.

I've made this several times. I make a double recipe & simmer it in my 9.5QT Dutch oven as my slow cooker is too small. The brand of enchilada sauce makes a huge difference! My family likes "Hatch" brand red "medium spicy" best. Other brands give off a funny smell during the initial cooking process. I've used 1/2 red & 1/2 green enchilada sauce as well. I get HOT diced green chilis, and 2-3Xs the cayenne (we love spicy). No water, just chicken stock to rim of Dutch oven. No fresh onions, but use dried onions as they're teeny & hubby doesn't like onions..so he doesn't know they're in there! We put lots of white hominy (buy club sized can & use 3/4 of can). Serve w avocados, sliced cabbage, radish, cilantro & lime.

I made it vegetarian instead of pork I used tempeh.  Tempeh is made from fermented soy and can be used in most recipes that call for meat, add  Vegetable Bouillon to add flavor, enjoy :)

I added another one to two cans of hominy and a total of 4-5 lbs of pork loin. Comes out excellent everytime and so easy. A crowd favorite on football days.

I was so excited to find this recipe and couldn't wait to find it.  I prepared it as part of our Thanksgiving dinner and was very disappointed.  While it tastes okay, it's definitely NOT pose.

I had a friend who's allergic to onion so I had to leave them out. I also used chicken instead of pork because I had chicken on hand. Otherwise I followed the recipe as is and it was fantastic! Surprisingly good, even with enchilada sauce (I was skeptical). I'll definitely make this again.

My family loved this recipe.  I made it a week before Thanksgiving for dinner.    I froze the left overs and decided to warm them up in the crock pot along with the huge thanks giving meal we already had prepared.   My family absolutely loved it and finished it off.   My sister-n-law is hosting Girls Night this next weekend and she just left here with a copy this recipe.  I'm excited to hear how her Gfriends like it.

Instead of Enchilda sauce I used homemade Salsa Verde and instead of canned Hominy I used fresh processed blue corn (nixtamal). We topped it with chopped red onion, shredded cabbage, fresh cilantro, avocado, a dollop of sour cream and a squeeze of lime. Soooooo good!!

This is one of the best soups I’ve ever had and I get asked for the recipe every time I make it for a party. I use green enchilada sauce and brown the pork loin whole and shred when I add the cilantro and salt at the end. I prefer shredded pork to cubed. Way easier prep too. Make sure to have the toppings available - they send it out of this world (avocado, cabbage, tortilla strips, limes).

Wonderful! I pretty much followed this except I didn't have the chills in my pantry. And I made in the stovetop, browning the meat and simmering till tender. I used La Victoria brand red enchilada sauce. Kids loved it too!

I was looking for a more authentic recipe but have no food processor to blend fresh peppers and tomatoes still need to stock up on kitchen appliances but I am glad I tried this recipe. I didn't make any changes it was delicious and super easy I will be making again very soon it will be even more satisfying when winter gets here??Although next time I will cut the meat a little smaller I thought the 1 inch pieces were a little  big

I thought this is was a good, easy, Mexican pork stew recipe.  But if you're looking for real posole this isn't it.  It good, it's just not as complex as authentic posole, and in the end, I was disappointed in it.

Wonderful recipe! I've made this twice now. First time was with pork and red enchilada sauce and that was so good! This time I made with chicken and green enchilada sauce and OMG it was hands down my favorite. I also subbed out the water and used chicken broth and because I love hominy, I added an extra can. Thank you Jules for a fabulous and versatile recipe!

This was easy to make and was done in 6 hours which resulted in melt in your mouth pork. Although the sauce was not specified so I used a verde sauce. I also used chicken broth in place of the water. I'll add a little more cayenne next time.

I recently made this for a small group of family/new friends.  I had made it once before and it was good enough for us at home, but wasn't sure what others would think, especially if they KNEW authentic Posole.  Everyone loved it! the crockpot was gone! this is definitely a keeper, quick and easy if you have everything on hand, put it on before work or church and when you come back it will be all done. Delish!

Delicious!! I followed the recipe as it was instructed. I also added cabbage,  guacamole and a squeeze slice of lime for serving. These extra touches made the soup for me.  Highly recommend this, I will definitely be making this again and again!

I did this one for New Years Eve 2015 and I got so many compliments. I did omit the cayenne pepper but added a few other "secret" ingredients. I also served this with a side of radishes cut up small and cabbage with tostadas also. Definitely will be making this again.

Really easy and delicious recipe. I used our local NM Red Chile instead of enchilada sauce.  I also omitted the onions, cilantro, and oregano out until served. I like those ingredients fresh.  Remember to grind the oregano in your palm to release the oils and aroma. Best way to warm up on a cold Christmas day.

Excellent and easy.  I have spent a large portion of my life in Texas and the southwest.  Scratch made is a teeney bit better but this is so much easier.  My favorite soup and have my wife make this frequently. My favorite comfort recipe.

I made this NO salt.  I used fresh made enchilada sauce from here and the soup turned out great.  You could taste the authentic flavors provided by the ingredient profile.  I could not locate frozen hominy so I dumped the hominy in a colander and ran under running water for 5 minutes.   A delicious taste of the southwest.

Followed the recipe very close.  Husband said it was a keeper.  I used the mild enchilada sauce and maybe a little bit less cayenne pepper and did not think it was too spicy.  Also garnished with cabbage, avocado and lime as suggested and that made it feel like a complete rounded meal.  This one will stay in the recipe box.

Oh my gosh, this was so good. My very picky husband even loved it.  I followed all the instructions and didn't alter any ingredients except added more salt and it came out perfect!  I enjoyed this so much that I am going to tell my mother and post it on Facebook.

Cooking it in the crockpot is a great idea. I'll do that again, but the enchilada sauce ruined the dish for me... The enchilada sauce is overwhelming and very tortilla soupish.

Made this recipe and it came out AWESOME! The only other ingredients I added was a bay leaf while it cooked and chicken stock. My mom said it tasted better than the Mexican restaurant that she gets her's from.

I'd never had Posole until I found this recipe and I love it.  I usually add a can of pinto beans and substitute chicken for the meat.  Thanks, Jules, for introducing me to Posole.

WOW... Great simple recipe!  I used a pressure cooker instead of crock pot. 1 1/2 hours later we had posole.  BUT, after reheating it the next day it was 10 times better. So I suggest making it a day ahead. The only thing I did was to double the pork and the hominy, we like more filling and less broth.  (I accidentally forgot the garlic though)

This was surprisingly good for how simple it is.  I used mild enchilada sauce, and 2 4oz cans of chopped green chilis, and left out the cayenne pepper and it was pretty spicy still.  I ended up using three cans of hominy.  added the last can about an hour before serving.  I have a 7 quart slow cooker.  I ended up putting in about 3 cans of water and that was plenty.  I suggest this as a simple, filling delicious meal to come home to on a work night!

I had pretty high hopes for this recipe.  I did the chicken tortilla soup that is somewhat similar in that it used enchilada sauce as a base, and it was the bomb.  This I thought was just ok.  I followed the recipe, but only used about half the water, and did add 2 cups of chicken broth as well, which I used to scrape the yummy pork bits off the bottom of my La Cruiset after I browned it.  I also added some Sazon (I think that is the name of it, little packets, I used 2 of them, probably MSG, really) seasoning that was recommended by a Hispanic friend when I made real posole in the past.  I never would have dreamed this would need more salt, but when I had it in the bowl, I had to salt the  out of it to bring out more flavor.  I do think I would double the hominy if you like hominy.  All this being said, my wife said she liked it.  However, she really likes the corn torillas I serve with it.  I put olive oil on corn torillas and bake them on a cast iron pizza pan at 400 degrees, they get sort of crispy/chewy and really are a great vehicle for this kind of soup.  If you like this, try the chicken tortilla soup that got high ratings, it's really good.  And make sure to try my tortilla thing.

Best throw together ever. Quick easy and tastes great. I used a induction cooker because I like the way I can control the heat. I use this recipe for pot lucks because it's quick, easy and always well received.

This was perfect! Instead of pork I used shredded chicken. I took another reviewers advice and added a bit more salt (1/2 tsp), and less water and it was on point. I have tasted authentic Mexican posole and this one taste just as good. I did use a Mexican brand of enchilada sauce, not sure if it makes a difference. In any case, do try this, and next time i will add one more 14oz can of hominy since i like it so much.

This is very much like the authentic mexican diner's pozole nearby.  Except I only put 1 can of the enchilada sauce and added a lot of garlic flavored chicken broth.  This is now a staple in our house.  Very easy and very yummy.  Thank you for posting this.

Easy and really pretty good....I used black beans since I had no hominy on hand....will definately use hominy next time. I also added some cumin, garlic powder, sea salt and pepper for a more flavorful roast. Thanks!

Before tonight I have never tried posole so I cannot contest on it's authenticity but my whole family really enjoyed it. Not only was it filling it was the perfect meal for those of us that seem to be coming down wit
h something.

I didn't stray too much from the recipe but I do want to comment on what I did differently. First off, I didn't have a pork loin roast, so instead I had some country style boneless pork ribs that needed using so I cubed that up. I skipped the browning step all together, just threw that meat into the slow cooker completely raw. I used 2 seeded jalapenos and 1 (8 oz.) can green chilies. I used mild enchilada sauce and added about 1 3/4 cup of water.

It smelled SO good cooking all afternoon and I couldn't wait to try it. I read many comments and topped it with a variety of items that people suggested.... shredded cabbage, chopped onion, chopped cilantro, sliced radishes, light sour cream, avocado and a wedge of lime. Only thing I think I would do differently next time is adding some more hominy, we really liked the hominy in it. Will make this again, FOR SURE!!!

This was great!  I agree with the other feedback to use mild enchilada sauce vs. med or hot.  I cooked it for my family using med and they found it to be a bit spicy.  I served it with fresh cabbage on top and it was great!  I threw it together in 5 min before running to work and I was quite impressed.

Wonderful soup!  I'd never had posole before, and this was an excellent version.  I also cut back on water, added cabbage and cumin.  My husband said, it's a keeper!
