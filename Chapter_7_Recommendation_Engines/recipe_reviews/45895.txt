I really like the fact that these don't try to boil over in the oven.  The tart lemon contrasts nicely with the honey and brown sugar.  Only one complaint.  Because the lemon stops these from tasting really sweet, I tend to eat too many.  Yummy!!!

This was ok, but nothing really special.  It looks like a butter tart, but is tart and sweet at the same time.  The taste of honey was overpowering, and the spices tasted strange with the lemon.  Some liked it, but most didn't.  Will probably not  make again.

I loved this recipe, the only thing is, i added raspberries on top for an extra kick and it made waaayy more filling than tarts, but I was more than happy to get more tarts for this delicious recipe!

I really like how these turned out. I did make one change by using filo cups instead of normal tarts. I just couldn't find tart shells at my grocery store. The filling is excellent. It was sweeter than I expected and I might add extra lemon next time. I really love sour lemons though, so if I make these for a party I'll keep the recipe as is.

This recipe was great! I made them for a dessert for my family and everyone loved them! They were all gone in no time! The spices made the lemon and honey together tasted alot like apple tarts but still i think this is a great recipe for someone to try!

Wow. Absolutely Amazing. I followed Mollie Mary Frances' idea of using philo dough instead of using tart shells. I also used fresh lime juice and fresh lime zest instead of lemon, because i'm more of a fan of limes than lemons. I baked them until i could smell them. perfectly done. They are SOOOO GOOD!!! I could eat these all day. Thanks so much for a wonderfuly refreshing change of the normal butter tarts.

This recipe was intriguing.  I read the two reviews.  I took the advice of the first one and omitted the lemon juice and used soy milk instead.  I omitted the cinnamon and doubled the nutmeg.  I cut the butter back to 1/4 cup.  Then I really changed the recipe by adding 1 cup of raisins.  They turned out the best butter tarts I have ever eaten.  The success started from a good basic recipe.

I did not use nutmeg.  These were very tasty. Getting rid of other recipes in recipe box. Keeper.

It is wonderful ! I checked out a couple of other reviews before I made them. And altered my recipe slightly as well. 
*Less nutmeg (not a fan)
* Added a tbsp of flour
*Added 3 or 4 raspberries to each tart.
