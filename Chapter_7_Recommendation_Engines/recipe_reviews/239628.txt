My family loved this dish! My hubby came back for thirds! The only thing I added was minced garlic. I added this and the onion to the butter and cooked it for a few minutes before proceeding with the recipe. Also, I used buttered croutons as the topping.  I, myself, like a lot of savor. So I added salt and pepper after serving. I will be making this again!

'Really don't like leaving a less-than-good review - especially with it being the first one.  It's probably something I did, but it wasn't good.  It looked good, but that's where it ended.  The bay leaf was some of my dislike, for sure.

Recipe Group: Very good recipe! I used sweet onion--the only real change I made to the recipe was the cheese; I didn't have all the cheddar called for so I added a mix of different cheeses to make up the difference. Makes great leftovers too :) thanks for sharing!

Recipe Group Selection:  18, October 2014 ~ I halved the recipe and baked this in a toaster oven.  We liked it, but I think it would have been a little more creamy if the egg would have been left out.  I feel it made the mixture 'set' making it a stiffer texture.  Served this with 'Turkey Tenderloins' from AR and steamed broccoli.

Tried it for recipe group 10/19/2014. We liked it. Nice comfort food. The crunchy panko crumbs were a nice touch.

I made this for a special holiday side dish and everyone loved it.  I made it exactly as instructed with the exception of I doubled the recipe and I sauteed the onions  to translucent and added the paprika to them in the saute pan before putting them into the macaroni mixture.  I recommend this recipe, it is marvelous, my husband is begging me to make it again.

l made this exactly as written except I left off the cheese topping and only did the bread crumbs. we found this very grainy, likely due to the cheddar.The taste was good, but the consistency was off. Next time I may try a combination of havarti and Gouda.

I used only 2 cups milk and it was fine. No egg either.  Everyone loved it. A new keeper.

Definitely the BEST Macaroni and Cheese recipe! I'm not a fan of onions, so I substituted the onions with onion powder (about 1/2 tsp.). And I added some garlic powder (1/4 tsp).
I am adding this to my personal recipe collection.

I have made this several times and always get compliments on it.  The only change I have made is the last time I made it, I used smoked paprika.  We love it and I had a friend ask me for the recipe today.  :)

very filling and delicious on a cold winter night. I added 1/2 cup of bacon but next time I'd leave it out as well as the onions, it doesn't need it. We like it crispy and browned on top so I broiled it for 2 minutes and it was perfect!

It's alright, but my fiancee and I found it to be fairly bland. If we decide to make this again for dinner, I'm going to definitely add more ingredients for flavoring. I was skeptical while making it that it would come out like this, as the majority of ingredients aren't the? type that would kick you in the butt. I even added chopped up bacon as an attempt to add a savory aspect. Perhaps it's the fact that we eat so much spicy food, but we both agreed that this needs a few more, stronger seasonings.

Delicious! Used butternut squash instead of the peas and it turned out great!
