Loved this! So delicious and flavorful, especially once the parmesan has been added.  Peeling and chopping butternut squash is a pain.  Here's my suggestion - simply cut the squash in half and remove the seeds with a spoon.  Then, place (peel down) on a baking sheet and bake at 400 for 40-45 min, or until the squash is tender.  Then, just scoop out the squash and voila! easy puree!

This was delicious!  I will be making this over and over again.
A tip if you are short on time or don't want to spend the time cooking/cuting/mashing a fresh butternut squash: you can substitute a 10 oz. box from the freezer section with the same results.  It is alread pureed, just pop it in the microwave to have it at a hot temperature and then add it in two batches (half in the beginning, half toward the end).  
This was soooo good.  Thanks Ms. Chef!

My kids & hubby LOVED this recipe, but for me I am a fan of more savory risotto recipes.  So I tried to add things to make it more to my taste buds - I amended the recipe as per other feedback and doubled the squash & rice amount, but I also added garlic with the onions, and placed about 2/3 cup chopped brown mushrooms with the 4th cup of broth and then added a pinch of cinnamon & allspice and parsley for some more flavor.  I would also recommend that you wait until the VERY end to add the squash (not half up front as per recipes directions).  My experience with risotto is that you must let the liquid absorption happen before adding the flavoring ingredients.  In this case, the thickness of the squash interfered with the broth absorption and made it more difficult to stir and it would sometimes stick to the bottom...

Wow, I really loved this risotto!  I do have to say that I chopped my squash and cooked it before peeling as someone recommended and completely regretted it.  I was chopping off squash skins for like 30 minutes.  Fortunately, this is the most delicious thing I've eaten in quite some time.  Taking another reviewer's advice, I only used 3 cups of chicken broth and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love butternut squash and have made this recipe several times now, tweaking a bit differently each time.   My favorite version uses a package of pre-cubed/peeled squash dusted with cinnamon and nutmeg from Whole Foods.  I roast it for 20 minutes instead of steaming.  I use 3 cups of veggie stock and 1 cup of Pacific butternut squash soup.  I've added chopped crimini mushrooms once as well, this is a fabulous risotto!

This was my first try at a squash risotto after having become a risotto cook with the mushroom-gorgonzola variety. Using tips I saw from other recipes I opted for putting in only half the squash with the first 3rd of the stock, and added the rest when the recipe was near completion. That helped me control the consistency. I made a 1-1/2 recipe, and I ended up with a lot of leftover stock. I also roasted my squash rather than steamed it. It seemed to me an easier way to prepare the squash since you don't have to peel and chop or own a steamer basket.

I've made basic risotto bunches of times - everyone here is right - the proportions are off. If you double the rice and the squash it turns into a great vegetarian main dish.

Risotto is a staple in our house, and I make it often.  I found this version to be pretty bland, and, as others have pointed out, it uses way too much stock.  Next time I would add a tbsp of brown and some cinnamon to try and add flavor.  I would also roast the squash instead of steaming it.

This is really tasty but the stock needs reduced, I actually substituted organic buternut squash soup (the pacific brand) instead of the chopped squash and used 1/2 stock 1/2 soup.  It was quite tasty!

Absolutely delicious!!! As other reviewers suggested, I added a sprinkle of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of ground sage, and only 3 cups of low sodium chicken stock. This was absolutely divine!!! It was my first time making Risotto, and a perfect way to begin it, since it turned out perfectly! I feel inspired!

This is a really nice fall dish, took a little while to cook though. I didn't peel the squash before I steamed it - it peels more easily afterwards. Also, I used a veggie broth to make it vegetarian. very tasty.

I just finished burning the roof of my mouth with this FABULOUS creation!!!  I roasted my squash in the oven like others did.  Otherwise I followed recipe exactly.  I did stop adding stock when I had used about 3 1/2 cups.  I added salt and pepper before the cheese and thought it was still a tiny bit bland, but after adding freshly grated parm...it is OUTSTANDING!!!  I love this recipe and will make it again.   *note* those that are using broth should expect their finished product to be salty, stock is not nearly as salty as broth and is much more flavorful.

My first time making risotto was a huge success!  Excellent, I did roast the squash instead of steam it and omitted the wine because I was out and the liquor stores in Minnesota are closed on Sundays :(  Thanks for sharing, will make again!

In my first batch I did not cook the onions long enough and it made a BIG difference. The second batch tasted so much sweeter and better when I cooked the onions longer. I made this for a friend and her family and her 6 year old loved it!

This recipe is good, though I did not need to double it as it made a LOT.  I also changed it up quite a bit.  Roasted the squash in the oven as other reviewers had recommended.  Sauteed the onions with mushrooms and garlic for more flavor.  Am not sure why so much chicken stock is needed.  My doubled recipe used only about 6 cups.  It also took waaay longer to cook than stated, so I gave up on the recipe time and just cooked it until the rice was done.  Since many reviewers had commented that it was bland, I also added a homemade feta cheese dressing from another salad, mixing it in at the end to taste.  It gave it a creamier flavor.  Lastly, added Beecher's flagship cheese as the topping.  Very tasty.

This was my first risotto attempt and it was delicous!  I served it with steamed lobster tail and shrimp with a salad on the side.  Incredibly delicious and worth all the stirring!  I forgot to add the salt and pepper but it really didn't need it (even used reduced sodium chicken broth), the flavor of the squash is incredible.

This recipe was ok as is.  I made a few changes but would do things differently again next time.  I didn't have butternut squash so I used acorn squash (fresh from my aunts garden).  I cut it in half roasted it skin side down in the oven like another reviewer suggested but found the skin became too soft to scoop out.  Instead I flipped it skin side up and used a sharp knife to peel off the skin and then I mashed it. I wanted lots of flavour so into the squash I mixed 1tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1tsp allspice and 1tsp ground clove..  Next time I won't use ground cloves at all because it left a strange after taste and I will cut the allspice in half. I didn't use onion as I am allergic but I used 1tsp of garlic instead and that was fine.  Lastly I used only 3 cups of chicken stock as suggested by another reviewer and that was perfect.  I will make it again.

This is one of my favorite recipes to make and eat on a cold winter night! It gets better every time I make it. I usually find that I have to add nearly 6 cups of broth. I also add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. The wine really gives it that extra deliciousness! I'll make this for year to come!

The liquid measurement was, indeed, totally off. I want to say I used no more than 3 - 3.5 cups in all. The flavor is good, especially after the addition of the parmesan. I used veggie broth in place of chicken, and added quite a bit of black pepper. Per another user's suggestion, I cut the squash in half, brushed with olive oil and roasted at 400 degrees, face down, for about an hour, then simply scooped out the squash. I pureed it with 1 cup of broth in a blender to get it super silky smooth. I would make this again!

OH MY GOD!!!  This was so good that it never got to the table!!  We ate it from the pot with a spoon!!  We just couldn't stop!!!  I roasted the squash. YUMMY!!  I'll make it again this week.  I used a lot more squash than the recipe suggested because I wanted to lower the calories, and I didn't use butter, just a tiny bit of oil to sautee the veggies.

This was just ok. I added a bag of broccoli/cauliflower to it to increase the nutritional value. It was a little bland. I think it would have been better as a side dish but we ate it as our main meal and it didn't have enough texture for that to be the only thing we ate. I probably won't make it again.

YUM!!!!! I roasted my squash at 425 degrees for about 30 minutes and added it in at the very end. I used chardonnay and based off other suggestions used only 4 cups of veg. broth. I used shaved Parmesan instead of grated and it was fabulous!

This is delicious! I only used a couple of cans of chicken broth, plus I added some mushrooms, parsley, and a squeeze of lemon juice at the end. Topped my finished product with toasted almonds. Hot  it's good! Thanks!

Delicious! I used only 4 cups of broth and it was enough. I also added a handful of sliced prosciutto. Both me and my 17-year-old really enjoyed it. I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent risotto. I roasted the squash and pureed it.  I used 4 cups of chicken broth, 1/3 cup wine.  I sautéed a bit of garlic in onion.  I added fresh chopped sage. I put half the squash puree in with the first 1/2 cup of broth.  Then I remembered what a couple of reviewers suggested, leaving it to the end.  So once all the broth was added to rice, I mixed the end of squash and a big handful of parmesan. Let that cook a bit further. My husband does not usually like risotto loved this one because it was so creamy.  Puree the squash for best results.

This was wonderful! It was creamy and flavorful. I cut the squash in half and cooked it cut-side down under some plastic wrap in the microwave for 12 minutes and then scooped it out with an ice cream scoop. It does seem like a lot of liquid going in, but that's how it is with risotto. I just kept stirring and adding more stock until it was incorporated. I did use a lid to help the rice soak up the stock a bit quicker but it turned out and I think I will make it again when I have plenty of time.

I decided to cook this recipe because I had a butternut squash on hand and I was highly pleased with the outcome.  My whole family raved about it.  It was very creamy--great recipe that I'll keep and make again.

We actually had this as a main course with lots of nutty parmesan on top and a big chopped salad. It seems to want lots of pepper. Also, I bought a bag of frozen organic butternut squash and it was really easy to make.

I agee with other posters, this recipe has too much stock, and needs a little tweaking depending on your tastes. I added garlic, and McCormick's "Parmesan and Herb" seasoning. Next time I think I'll try a romano/parmesan cheese blend or even asiago.

I followed another review and roasted the squash instead of steaming and addded it at the last minute, added some mushrooms, used about 4 cups of VEGETABLE stock, added parsley, and it was GOOD! only took about an hour 15 minutes.

I reduced the broth to 3.5/4 cups, added the squash at the end, and added sage to add flavor.  It turned out really tasty.  Great consistency, and flavor.  Thanks!

This was our first time making risotto, I roasted the squash in the oven instead of steaming it was just easier for me and didn't use any wine. This was time consuming but worth it.

Good recipe, but I would recommend changing the proportions slightly. I used four cups of butternut squash, and only 3 cups of stock. This way, you can put the stock in 1 cup at a time. or 1 cup, 1/2, etc. I also added some diced mushrooms which worked fabulously with this recipe!

This was okay.  I cooked a total of about 25 minutes and used all the liquid but the end result wasn't very creamy.  I added the squash at the end of cooking but when it all came together the flavors weren't really there and it was kind of pasty in the mouth.  It wasn't my favorite but enjoyed making it!  Thank you!

Very nice risotto! I did make a few changes, I'm a vegetarian so I made vegetable stock and used that instead. I also didn't have any arborio rice so I used brown rice and I added some mushrooms as well. The only problem I had is that it took me WAY longer than 35mins for cook time, but that was probably because I used brown rice. I will make this again!

This was good but a bit odd tasting at the same time. I doubled the wine and used about half the amount of chicken stock.

This is extremely tasty, but really hard to make.  It took me wayyy longer to make this dish.  It took a long time for the broth to absorb in the rice.  After it was complete, it was delicious though!

I added extra seasoning salt & black pepper, & upped the parmesan cheese to 1/3 cups. Pretty basic for risotto, but lightly tasteful. I recommend next time making a grilled chicken breast for on top, or cook shredded chicken in with the onions. Good consistency.

Yummy, just made this for dinner tonight.  Followed the recipe with the exception that I roasted the butternut squash for 20mins at 425 degrees.  SP & olive oil before roasting.  What a wonderful flavor.  Will do this again!!

I made this exactly as written, although mine only needed 4 cups of stock. Also, I put in less cheese than called for because it was tasting so delicious without it! Such a simple recipe, and so much creamy goodness. It's going into the rotation for sure.

Delicious!  Only thing I changed is that I used about 3 cups of chicken stock rather than 5.  I was a little concerned when I first added the squash and stock that it would end up a soupy mess because I forgot to measure the squash (just cut up one small squash and mashed it), but it turned out perfectly!  I think this would be a wonderful, unexpected side dish for Thanksgiving, but we will certainly use it as a main dish throughout the year.

Excellent! I had already roasted some butternut squash, so I reheated it in the microwave and mashed it, leaving some chunks.  I added about 1/2 tsp of rubbed sage with the first batch of chicken stock.  My only recommendation is to use a low-sodium or homemade stock, as the regular prepackaged stock will make it pretty salty once cooked down.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used regular rice instead of Arborio.  The only thing I would change is to use more Parmesan and stir the squash in at the very end.  (The squash seems to inhibit the rice from absorbing the liquid.)

My husband said this was EXCELLENT! He is an accomplished cook as well, I was amazed. This is very, very good. The amount of Stock (5) cups, is if you prefer a wet, loose risotto like the picture. Others said the broth is too much, this is true if you prefer a thick, "keep it's shape" risotto. We prefer the consistency of thickness so risotto will stand alone in a mound. I used only 3 cups of the broth to achieve this. I used shallots to equal about 1/2 of a yellow onion. I added about a 1/4 teaspoon of fresh chopped Rosemary at the stage of the last broth addition. I added a 1/3 cup grated Lionza, a local hard cheese much like parmesan, more pungent, at the cheese stage. Salt and pepper to taste. Awesome! Welcome to the restaurant in my house!! 02/20/2017 twist on this recipe. Omit rosemary. Roast the squash and a bulb of garlic. Mashed together.  Add as instructed. After seasoning with salt and fresh ground pepper add 3 slices of cooked bacon (chopped) and use grated Romano instead.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would.  OMG this was amazing.  I didn't change a thing - the recipe is perfect as is.  My husband thought perhaps a little bit of cayenne (we both like heat) would be a good addition, but I disagree.  I think that would take away from the butternut flavor.  You won't be disappointed in this dish - it's WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL!

I played around a bit with this one, and it was great. To make it completely vegetarian, I used veggie stock. I microwaved the squash cubes until tender, which worked out fine.  I also added about a tablespoon of currey powder while stirring for a litte kick. We just had the leftovers for lunch.

I would rate this a hundred stars if i could.  We make it all the time now.  I get a butternut, cook it and divide it into 10 ounce portions and freeze the squash.  Then all i have to do is defrost it and make the risotto.  Make sure you use excellent quality broth because it really a main ingredient, like Imagine brand or PC orgaincs.  No campbells here.

This was delicious! I baked the squash and doubled the recipe. It got so big that I needed two skillets, and they were both very full. The favor was a little bit too salty for me. I think I will use half broth and half water next time. Other than that, it was really good! If it wasn't so time consuming, I would commit to making it again soon.

Excellent! Improved by the addition of nutmeg, garlic, lots of black pepper, and even mushrooms at the onion stage. Fresh thyme at the end and double squash (some pureed, some in steamed chunks added at the end)

This recipe was okay. I followed it exactly however roasted the squash in the oven then scooped out the flesh. I think this could be exceptional but it was a tad bit bland for my taste. I do appreciate the nutritional values for this recipe (it was a LOT of squash) but not sure I would make this again as written. It definitely needs more flavor.

This recipe was SO GOOD!! I used pre-cut/peeled butternut squash from Trader Joe's which made it really easy - and I also roasted it in the oven rather than steamed it just because it was easier.  I used 4 cups of chicken stock because that's what a full box was.  Everything else I followed exactly and it was GREAT!!  My husband loved it as well.  Will make again!

Delicious!! Just made this tonight (my first risotto, with many to follow!), both my husband and I loved it! And...I even forgot to add in the white wine (which I had all ready and measured out...) Still turned out great. Creamy and wonderful. I roasted the butternut squash and left it chunky to add to the texture. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!!  I didn't have white wine (or any wine) so I skipped that step and I forgot to mash the squash but it wasn't a big deal it cooked so well that it pretty much mashed itself.  Really great and quick dinner.  I bet this would be good with other kinds of squash too or sweet potatoes.
The second time I made it I added some thyme, marjoram and 2 bay leaves to the sauteed onion and that made it even better!!  I also used acorn squash, carrots and sweet potatoes.

People seem to be having problems peeling butternut.  As someone who has cooked more than his fair share for twin infants over the past several months, I finally found the solution.  As others have said, cut in half, lengthwise, scoop out seeds and roast for 30-40 minutes until tender.  Then let cool and simply peel the skin using a paring knife.  Easy breezy.  MUCH easier than trying to scoop.  Oh yeah, I made absolutely zero changes to this recipe and it is stunning!  I will make this again as well as try new varieties (can't wait to try Beet which is likely amazing, too!).

Delicious!!!! I did double the rice and added 2 extra cups of stock, and I only had some Egyptian Roomy cheese (its almost exactly like Parmesan just saltier and stronger in flavor) and it gave it an awesome kick!

After being blessed with a full case of butternut squash, my students and I looked for ways to use it up.  This was far and away the best use we found for it.  It made  squash lovers out of several of my students!

I added a cinnamon stick as the rice was browning.  Then substituted 1/2 cup sherry for stock.  I also threw in a bay leaf and some thyme because I love herbs.  It was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

I almost made this to the letter, but left out the parmesan for a picky child and added it separately to my own serving.  I also used very good wine and home-made chicken stock.  It was incredible.  Picky child gave it 2 thumbs up (virtually unheard of) and we both had seconds. Big Yum.

Also works well with acorn squash , which was all I could find today. I halved them and roasted for one hour at 375. A little extra butter is nice, too, but don't tell ....

Wow, this is so worth the time it takes to make! I was going to an autumn dinner party for several friends, and I doubled this recipe. To make it even more autumn-like, I 1) mashed the butternut squash, but left some very small chunks on purpose. Then, 2) when I added onion, I also sliced some leeks very thinly - just because I like them. Finally, at the end, I 3)threw in about 2 cups of thinly shredded baby spinach. It was gorgeous and BIG hit!

Excellent.  Requires constant attention (as most risottos do), but worth it (as most risottos are).  I used my electric steamer to steam the squash and it took about 20 minutes.  I didn't completely mash the squash, choosing to leave some chunks.  No changes are required.  This is just a wonderful, creamy, comforting dish for fall.

Deeeelicous!!!!!!!!  Roasted the butternut squash beforehand and just peeled off the skin.  Only needed 4 cups of stock and added fresh parsley at the end.  Holy cow, I've made different varieties of risotto before but this has been the best tasting by far!

I'm editing my original review (below, 4 stars) after having had some leftovers from the other night.  It IS really good, and not at all like "post-hole cement" like someone teased me.  5 stars.  I thought it was really good.  I brought it to a cooking group get together.  Everyone said it was great.  But I ended up with a LOT left over.  So I question how good it really was.  I doubled the recipe and it made a tremendous amount.  It was very good.  It just bothers me that there was so much leftover.  So for that reason I gave it only 4 stars.  Which is probably unfair.  Relatively healthy too - given the amount of butter and cheese used in ratio to the yield.

This is what it sounds like: butternut squash in risotto. Nothing particularly interesting, but tasty.  I'd make it again.

Exceptional!!!  The recipe is perfect.  I did roast my butternut squash in the oven, slice side down in a 1/2 inch of water (375 degrees) for about 45 minutes.  It was perfect and all ready to spoonl off the peel (and it was perfectly steamy and mashed) I stirred and stirred and it was perfect!!  Be careful with the seasoning, the concentrated chicken broth adds quite a bit of salt.  I didn't need to add any more.  PERFECT!!!

This one is a keeper.  Very flavorful, however somewhat time consuming because of the time it takes for the liquids to be absorbed by the rice.  I used one less cup of chicken  broth and it still turned out really well.  There was no need for salt, because of the chicken broth and Parmesan. Brought the left overs with me to work and it reheated well in the microwave.

This was Amazing!! I've only had risotto in restaurants a few times and this recipe topped all of them. I've recently gone on a gluten free diet and this works for that too I was thrilled. I did make some changes I'll list here. I used 2 TBS Smart Balance in place of the butter, I added 3 cloves of minced garlic a minute before I added the rice. I used 1 cup white wine; use a wine you'd drink, not a cooking wine (cheap and full of salt), and (2)14oz cans reduced sodium chicken broth. I added my chicken broth 1 cup at a time and when I was down to less than a cup of broth left, I added the remaining broth with a carton of Campbell's V8 Butternut Squash Soup . I'm always tempted to add more cheese than a recipe calls for but as it turned out I only had 1/4 cup of parm on hand and it was perfect. The parm is a great accent without competing with the delicate flavors of the butternut squash. I seasoned to taste at the end with S&P. This risotto is just the perfect comfort food. Rich, a touch of sweet balanced with savory. To die for!

Just as good as any restaurant.  I think that it took longer than 35 minutes to cook but was still great.

I used acorn squash instead of butternut and seasoned the squash with brown sugar and cinnamon. I omitted the wine (by accident). It's good, although not as flavorful as some other risottos I've had.

Big gourmet taste from just a few simple ingredients.  Kudos on a highly successful combo of ingredients.  I made 1.5 times the recipe, and heeding others' advice, I made sure to not use the full amount of broth.  It turned out fine, but in hindsight, I think the best way to cook this is to follow the box instructions and slowly add just enough broth to cover the rice and wait until the rice absorbs; that way, there's no risk of going too much over.  A few changes I made to the recipe were that I added in some minced garlic and diced portabello mushroom (about 3/4 cap) after the rice and onions had been frying for 3 minutes and just before adding the white wine - was a very lovely addition and contributed to the layers of flavor.  I also added in some diced green onion towards the end of the cooking process.  Instead of steaming the squash, I roasted it at 400 degrees for 50 minutes; it was still pretty hard, so I mashed it up using the food processor instead of by hand.  All in all, a wonderful dish that I'd be truly proud to serve to guests.

The initial risotto was good, leftovers have been even better. This makes a huge batch so plan on eating it for several meals. We added sauteed mushrooms and baby peas, without it may have been too much of the same texture.  I added the squash toward the middle/end of the chicken stock and that seemed to work well, otherwise I think it would have taken much longer for the rice to cook. Use a huge pan when making this, our biggest was overflowing!

I  made this in a pressure cooker. Used frozen cubed squash, defrosted, mashed, 2C home made broth. it was a bit strong in flavor, I'll use canned next time.  After sauteing the onion and rice, i added the broth and squash. No wine-none in the house. Cooked after it came to high pressure for 7 minutes. It was still a bit too  soupy so cooked, without a cover for 5 minutes on very low, stirring occasionally to keep from sticking. Most risotto recipes can be adapted to the pressure cooker, and don't need the constant stirring and attention of traditional risottos.

Wonderful recipe. I only needed 4 cups of vegetable broth instead of 5 for 1 cup of arborio rice. I substituted white grape juice for the white wine, and added some fresh sage. DELICIOUS!

SO good. I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the rice and squash. I also added a pinch of cinnamon and some Anna's Homemade Garlic Salt (from Etsy). To make it more of a meal I poached 2 chicken breasts and shredded them. I added them at the very end. I also added more parmesan because, well, why wouldn't you? This was a big hit even with my 4 year old, and my 7 month old!

This recipe is a good base, but with a few tweaks it can be changed from bland to delicious! Like others have said I cut and placed the butternut squash in the oven for an hour at 400 which made it so much easier to mash. However, next time I will probably get a can or try some other method in order to make this quicker.  Added in some cinnamon, nutmeg, and garlic (with the onions) in order to give it some flavor and it tasted amazing! I actually did use quite a bit of chicken stock (~4 cups) in order to make the arborio rice become soft and make the dish creamier so I would suggest placing the stock cup by cup and add more if you feel like it is needed. Also, I added the butternut squash after the first several cups of stock in order to make sure the rice absorbed the liquid properly. Perfect dish for fall and if these extra ingredients are added, the dish becomes both sweet and savory.

In a word, YUM!  I was searching for something different to do with butternut squash and found this recipe.  I had to adapt a bit due to ingredients on hand (no wine, and only had long grain brown rice).  I decreased the chicken broth to 3+ cups, and cooked the squash in another 1/2 cup of the broth.  I also had to stir/cook a bit longer since brown rice does't seem to absorb as well as Arborio.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  A big hit with me and my husband.  Thanks for posting!

Bake squash (cut in half and seeded, squash side down) at 375 for 40-45 minutes. Scoop out squash, and then make puree in blender. I usually like to use the whole squash at the same time so I increase the servings so that it reads 4 cups cubed squash (about 3 cups puree squash). I also make some garlic shrimp with oregano and throw that into the butternut squash risotto!! SO YUMMY!

I found this Recipe to be very tasty, but I had to alter the Recipe considerably.  I added the Chicken Stock one cup at a time and on a Medium to High Temperature.  I also only used a total of 3 cups of Chicken Stock.  I also really chopped my Fresh Butternut Squash really small, I also added a Fresh Garlic, with the Fresh Sauting Onions and Risotto, and some canned mushrooms.  Also, I sprinkled in some dried Oregano, Parsley, and Basil

I decided to try this recipe since it was different than the butternut squash risotto I've made before, with sugar and spices in it. I had to add the brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice. This is very bland as-is, and definitely was missing something. I agree with another reviewer that the squash should be added last (another thing that probably made it bland...cooked all the natural sweetness out). Won't make this as written again.

I roasted the squash first and used all of it ( almost 3 cups puréed)
I follow the rest of the instructions exactly and this is going to be a regular dish for us. It is yummy and will be the main course tonight along with a simple salad, a nice white wine and a chunk of homemade bread

This was nice!  Different than your average risotto, but still straightforward to make.  The large amount of liquid that the recipe tells you to incorporate really draws out the cooking, but the overall product was still worth it.

This was so darn yummy!  my husband told me it was better than the risotto from a restaurant we went to last week. Definitely reduce the chicken stock down to 3.5 cups and peel the squash before you steam or bake it, what a mess that was.  I can't wait to make it again!

Wow - this is tasty!  Added a bit of fresh rosemary and thyme to add a bit more flavor.  Served it with some diced squash mixed in for added texture.  Yummy!

I roasted my squash but probably should have roasted it a little bit longer.  I didn't mash it up very much so there were chunks of squash in the risotto, which I like.  I took the advice of others and didn't use as much liquid.

Had never made a squash risotto, and also live in Minnesota, like another reviewer...no wine on Sunday.  ANYWAY, I had roasted squash on hand, so cubed it.  Used vegetable broth and had shallots, so used that.  Followed the recipe, but kept tasting it for doneness, didn't need all the broth.  Threw in the cubed squash about 3/4ths of the way through.  Then started adding sage (hand rubbed) because it IS bland.  At the very end, I added a lot of grated Parmesan.  Served with grilled chicken thighs marinated in soy and olive oil.  Pretty good meal for a single lady.  Then for the leftovers, I chopped up the thighs and added it right to the risotto.  Pretty good lunch and the next meal, and the next meal and.....(it made a lot)

For those of you questioning the amount of stock, risotto recipes typically ask you to warm up more stock than is needed since you don't know the exact amount that it will take to get your risotto done.  I always have stock left over and typically just let it cool then freeze the rest. 

As for those commenting that it doesn't make a great main dish, it isn't meant to.  It is a starchy side dish, most don't make a meal out of mashed potatoes either, no matter how much they love them.

It was really good. I also changed the stock to 3 cups and baked the squash in the oven. I did add mushrooms and peppers with the onion, and also added some chicken for more of a meal. Since I did add more to the rice, I would of added 1/2 cup more of stock. I used 2 cups of mashed squash, and really would of wanted to use double for more sweet flavor. I still loved it!

This was really good.  I used frozen butternut squash which made the prep work shorter/easier.  I only used 4 cups of chicken broth and added it 1 cup at a time.  I didn't add the next cup of broth until the previous cup had been fully absorbed by the rice.  After the final of cup of broth is added and almost fully absorbed, I stirred in the squash puree, parmisan cheese, and a ton of chopped fresh parsley and basil.  I then covered it for the last few minutes of cooking.  Every bite was delicious.  However, every bite that had a bit of the fresh basil was absolutely heavenly!!  Total cooking time was around 35 minutes.

Glad that I've found this recipe because I have 2 cups of leftover butternut squash. I also add half of an onion, baby portobello mushrooms, and broccoli stems. The color was beautiful with mixture of orange, green, and brown. The flavor was also well-balanced. Suggestion on the amount of chicken stock. Instead of adding 5 cups of stock all at once, add 1 cup stock at a time and let the rice cooks. Add another cup when the liquid is reduced. This way, you have the control over the total amount of stock that is needed in your risotto. Also, have fun adding other ingredients.

SO tasty! As per other reviewers, I used only 3 cups of broth and it turned out perfect. It was time consuming to prepare the squash, but well worth it. Will make again and again!

Good recipe, but I would change some things next time. I would cut the chicken broth with water as the chicken broth is salty and the chicken taste really comes out in the dish, particularly the next day.

Really rich and delicious tasting.  I halved the recipe and only used 2 cups of stock when doing this.  I also added sage at the same time I added onion, and it gave it more flavor.

Good but a little salty.  However, I think that was because of the chicken stock that I used.  I will try again.

A new staple in my home! I doubled everything except for the chicken stock ( I actually used only 4 cups) and it was perfect. I also took it off the stove and let it steam for a bit to soak up the rest of the liquid.

Surprisingly creamy.  great, actually.  Next time, when I'm sauteing the onion, I'll add some diced prosciutto.  Also, this recipe serves no more than 4...and you'd have to stretch it to feed 4.  I also roasted the butternut squash ahead of time, and then just mashed it in (cold out of the fridge), which worked well.  My 11-month old ate it and seemed to like it too!

My boyfriend said he didn't like butternut squash and he had never tried risotto.  I loved both but had never tried to make risotto.  I made this yesterday and we both loved it!  Thanks for helping me convert him.  I made it basically as written except as a vegetarian I substituted vegetable stock for the chicken stock.  Yum...I am looking forward to making this again!

This was AMAZING! My mom couldn't believe there was no heavy cream in it.  The only thing I did differently was roast the squash instead of steaming it, it provided a richer squash flavor.  Definitely adding this to my recipe binder!

I came home tonight with a butternut squash in hand, knowing I wanted to do something with it, but not sure what. This recipe did the trick, although I made some slight changes to it - I used about 3 cups of steamed squash, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, substituted shallots for the onions, sake for the wine, and fish stock for the chicken. I used the suggested amount of broth and although it took an additional fifteen or so minutes at the end to simmer away the extra liquid, the wait was well worth it. However, if I make this again with my changes I think I will add some bay leaves.

This was sooooo surprisingly delicious.  We've been trying to eat more local, seasonal foods lately, and this is the perfect recipe for autumn or winter, when squash is one of the only things available.  We are not squash fans, though, so I was nervous that this wouldn't be something we'd like.  But everyone did!  The Parmesan cheese seems to really mellow out the "squashy" flavor.  We called it "cheesy rice" and the two-year-old gobbled it!

pretty yummy, i actually never cooked squash before so i didn't realize you had to peal the squash before cooking it. I took the peals out once i steamed the cubes but all things considered pretty darn tasty, the parm. cheese is a great addition

I adapted this recipe a bit, by adding thyme and paprika, and using brown jasmine rice. So it wasn't entirely a risotto, but it was quite delicious! I definitely recommend it.

Amazing! I used a chardonnay with a slight oak finish for the white wine. I also added 1/2 lb of extra firm tofu to make it a main dish and 1/2 carton sliced mushrooms. I cut the tofu in 1/2" cubes and sauteed with onions and mushrooms in butter at the beginning. At the very end I added some ripped spinach to add some green and variety.   Next time I am going to try Pacific Mushroom broth and keep it vegetarian. It is a piece worth showing off!

This was great.  Ended up using 4 cups broth.  I didnt add squash until the end.  I just kept adding broth a little at a time and stirring until absorbed.  That's the way i have always made risotto.  I also heat the broth before adding so that it doesnt cool off the rice.  I'll be making this often.

I'm not a squash fan, but this was amazing! We didn't need all the stock  - and actually, as I was a bit short on it, I doubled the wine. I also roasted the squash; overall it got rave reviews, and was just a perfect, delicate sidedish to try. I will be making this again for sure!

A good dish overall.  As others have mentioned, we did not use the full amount of stock.  Adding the squash at the start threw us off a little- harder to tell when the rice was ready for more liquid.  I roasted the squash instead of steaming it.  I also ended up using a lot more squash than it called for because I didn't want to have half of a squash left over. I did add salt and pepper to the squash during roasting and to the finished risotto for more flavor as well.

Good. I added a little nutmeg and some half and half. I didn't use the whole amount of stock either. Probably used about 2/3 of it maybe less.

We had this last night, it was exceptional. My husband cooked dinner with the recipes I gave him ;-) We had this with cod florentine (broiled the cod and topped it with spinach and swiss cheese), it went really well together. Took another reviewer's advice and did the squash in the microwave, super easy. We are going through a risotto phase thanks to a cool bar/restaurant here in Baltimore (Joe Squared) which has outstanding risotto. This was the easiest we have made at home and was sooo sooo good. We used asiago as that was what we had, all else the same. My husband said his mother tried for years to get him to like butternut squash with various recipe attempts and this one finally did it. Thanks for a great recipe!

a fabulous, simple risotto. followed to the letter, except for roasting the squash rather than steaming it, using olive oil instead of butter, and using pecorino romano rather than parmesan, only b/c i'm allergic to cow's milk (real 'romano' is sheep!). wonderful recipe, thank you!

This is delicious!  I did follow recommendations from people to use 3 cups of broth instead of 5.  I also took a risk and used a mix of brown and wild rice to give it more texture.  I wasn't sure if it would work and come out creamy enough but it did.  It was yummy.  Oh- and I increased the grated cheese from 1/4 cup to 1 cup.  We were out of parmesan so I used some aged gouda.

This was OK. I make risotto often and this version seemed way too mushy of a consistency - and it wasn't the rice because the grains still had a nice bite to them. No, I think the problem laid in the texture of the mashed butternut squash. It seemed to make the whole dish very gruelly - perhaps there was too much of it?? I did kick up the flavors by adding 1 Tbsp butter, 1/8 tsp ground ginger, 1/8 tsp cayenne, 1/4 tsp cumin, and 1/4 tsp all spice to the mashed squash. Then of course lots of salt and pepper in the final product. I also ended up using only about 3 cups of broth. I'll stick to my Cook's Illustrated recipe - it takes longer, but it keeps the squash in cubed form which helps the risotto maintain it's body.

Great Recipe. easily a new favorite. I will definetly be making this for thanksgiving hoping to wow everyone! I added a little extra wine in the end because i didnt think it was creamy enough. I took the advice of using only 3 cups stock not 5 and i think to make it perfect next time i will use 4 because it came out slightly dry (before i added the extra wine) but overall it was great!

This was delicious!  I didn't have any white wine on hand, so I omitted it.  I think it turned out sweeter than it would have otherwise, but it was still good.  I also added frozen peas and raisins with the last batch of broth.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used just three cups of broth.  It was perfect.  Will be added to my regular recipe box and made again and again.

i used this recipe's amounts along with a friend's recommended amounts so used 2 c arborio rice so the 5c of stock worked well, 1/2 c wine, and i had extra squash so used about 1 c more.  also, i love some parm so added probably a cup of it.  put salt in it and a lot of black pepper, plus some cinnamon and nutmeg.  i was so excited about it but it had very little flavor unless you heavily salted it.  that was the general consensus by the guests too.  it had a nice texture, but not flavor.  hate to put so much salt in it but don't know what else to do to get the flavor, so probably won't make again.

My first risotto. came out perfectly... I did have to make some substitutions: I used short/round brown rice (california), and 1/2 TURKEY stock - 1/2 chicken broth.  It took a little longer than stated (possibly due to my High Altitude environment) but still VERY tasty and Very Creamy. I LOVE IT & will definately make again.

Excellent risotto!  Although I really messed up...my squash didn't cook up right and I didn't realize until it was too late that I was out of parmesan.  So I used manchego instead, skipped the squash and this resulted in a very tasty batch of risotto.  Oh!  And fyi I used an inexpensive pinot grigio for the dry white wine and only 4 cups of broth.

Great Recipe!!  I agree with others that you do not need that much broth.  I roasted my squash in oven with a little olive oil, salt and nutmeg then pureed. This makes it smooth and I really like that as well as enhances flavor. I think the type of risotto you buy will change cooking time and also broth requirement but overall this is a keeper recipe for sure.

Absolutely delicious.  In my opinion this made waaay more than 4 servings, but I served it as a side dish.  I also added some nutmeg while the risotto was absorbing the broth.  I was baking something for an hour anyway, so I baked the squash and then mashed it, same results I would imagine.  My roommates and I loved it.  They say thank you as well!

Yum!  Followed others advice and only added 3 cups of stock.  Didn't have an onion so added dehydrated onion flakes, some fresh garlic, asiago & parm and right at the end added some shredded kale for colour and extra vitamins!  Great dish!

I LOVED this.  My husband doesn't like squash, but he was able to eat this-- I'd consider that a success.  I used 1 cup mashed squash.  Next time, I'll go heavier on the onion and lighter on the parmesan.  In addition, like other reviewers, I used only 3 cups of broth (as recommended on my bag of rice).  This was plenty.

Easy to make and delicious! 

I did find that it took longer than the times given and that was cooking on a gas hob. 

A definite hit with the family and will make it again!

My family loved it, I wasn’t a huge fan. The onion was a little too strong for me.
Probably won’t make it again.

Awesome the first few times I made this. Today I made 2 changes. Added 1/2 teaspoon saffron threads & 1 1/2 ounces diced pancetta. Still awesome!! Side to smoked Turkey Legs placed into a slow cooker for 7 hours.

No one objected to this meal, but no one was wild about it. We found it lacking the umami and pizazz to be a main dish, but thought it would make an excellent side. The flavors are not strong or distinct, so as a side, it would not compete with or overshadow a main. We added extra parm and a hefty amount of black pepper to make it more to our liking.

This is my first time cooking risotto. I had exactly 2 cups of leftover butternut squash from last night’s dinner, and quite by mistake my husband purchased risotto when I sent him for medium grain rice for another recipe. So here I was, with leftover squash and a bag of risotto that I didn’t know how to prepare. It looks marvelous even as it’s cooking and having tasted it a couple of times, I think everyone will love it. I definitely will make it again.

I made this vegan. Used veggie stock and added garlic with the onions. Topped it off with a little vegan cheese, but found out this was unnecessary due to the creaminess of the squash already. It was a great recipe to start off with, thanks!!

Delicious. Will make again. Next time will roast the squash in the oven instead of steaming it stovetop. 
Takes longer for the risotto to cook than advertised.
Worth the effort.

This is wonderfully delicious!  Followed the recipe closely save 1 exception - we only added 2 cups chicken stock and felt it was sufficient. Pulled the squash from our garden which made it even better!  Will make again.

It is good. I love butternut squash. Good mix with Arborio. I thought mushrooms would be good in it too. Cooking time is long on the stove. So probably won't make it again until cool weather. I had a little Parm cheese and I put grated Romano on top. I put it in a corningware dish.

I have made this several times now. So delicious! But we prefer not to purée the squash, instead to oven roast it in small cubes with a bit of olive oil for ~1/2 hour while the risotto is cooking. Then add the butternut squash just before serving.

Absolutely delicious! I ended up baking my butternut squash at 375 F for 45 minutes, flipping halfway. The taste from the baked squash was amazing, even if it didn't mash as well.

The peeler for the squash is not the typical one but the one that has the blade going crosswise. This makes peeling the squash easy. This is my first risotto and I am not a big fan of the texture, but it is fine as far as taste goes

I love this recipe with the addition of a balsamic glaze drizzled over the top and toasted and salted pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top as well. Sometimes I serve it with brown butter cooked scallops on top as well. Depends on my mood.

The risotto came out excellent, super creamy.   But 1 cup of onion is way to much onion flavor in this. I couldnt taste the squash at all.

I peeled, cubed, & roasted the squash instead of steaming it and it was fantastic - I think roasting brings out the best of butternut’s flavors. I will make this again (& again).

I used others suggestions and cut down on the amount of broth - using 3 cups in total (added 1 cup at a time). It turned out perfect! I also roasted the squash in a little olive oil with salt and pepper rather than steaming. As an extra luxury, I used shaved parmesan.

Anything the whole family likes, deserves 5 stars. I will make this again and toss in some herbs, either thyme or sage to see if that makes it more interesting for the adult palates.

My husband is not a fan of  butternut squash but he really liked this. I added fresh sage at the end which helped offset some of the sweetness. Paired it with roasted chicken thighs for a wonderful dinner.

i will make it again and I made it to the recipe although I halved it.   Delicious and the butternut squash was easy to mash and it cooked right down easily.   The only thing  I didn't do was to heat the broth.   Didn't seem to affect the cooking time, although it was already warm in my kitchen since it's early autumn.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it is awesome!  I’ve made this countless times and it is always a hit. You definitely have to have patience though and ensure the rice soaks up all the liquid. It is time consuming but worth it.

This was quite good. I didn't use nearly as much of the chicken stock, but it still turned out quite good. I also omitted the Parmesan cheese, because I didn't have any. Instead I added a sheep's milk cheese, finely diced. Dark Horse Chardonnay goes quite well in it and with it.

Great recipe. Only changes I made was I roasted the squash instead of messing around with peeling and chopping it up. I used a shallot instead of an onion because that's all I had laying around. Definitely make sure you salt and pepper at the end. I served this with a balsamic marinated chicken breast and it was delicious!

Loved this recipe. Like many others, I roasted the squash for about an hour, and then pureed it with a pinch of cinnamon and a cup of broth. I added garlic and diced mushrooms, cooking them with the onions in the butter. I also used 1/3 of a cup of parmesan cheese, and only used 3 cups of broth (inclusive of the cup used for the puree). I mixed in the puree closer to the end, and seasoned only with a bit of pepper after the cheese was fully blended in. It worked out perfectly. Tasted delicious. Will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe using the adjustments from recommendations to use less broth (3 cups) and wait to add the butternut squash at the end.  It did enhance the taste.  I also added a bit more parmesan and a dash of brown sugar, and used shallots and garlic instead of onions (as I was out of onions).  All worked nicely. At the very end, last thing -  I added some cinnamon, but I likely wouldn't do that next time as it changed the taste to much, and I liked the taste before I added the cinnamon.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous! The only change is  I roasted squash & added garlic salt. Fabulous. I don't think the Parmesan cheese was needed & you could saute onions  in olive oil vs. butter to cut calories/fat.

Great recipe. My family likes meat and I like butternut squash. So I added 1lb bulk sausage (browned) when I added squash to rice. Delicious combo! Like others, I stopped at 3 cups stock. I think it would have been way too salty otherwise. But I did add some more water from streaming squash. Like others, added the sprinkles of cinnamon and 1/2tsp sage. Perfect additions. Sweeter.

Version 2: Use a whole onion. Add sausage at the same time. Then rice. Use all stock. This is my favorite!! Savory!!

Added less broth than called for and it was still runny before I cooked and let evaporate an extra 20 minutes or so.  Squash flavor is easily overpowered by the Parmesan so be careful not to use too much, I didn’t measure as I added and regretted it.

Delish!! I make it as the recipe states except that I throw all the roasted squash in right before I start adding the broth most of the squash melts down to give the whole dish a creamy, hearty flavor.  Some of the pieces stay whole as well and adds to the perfect consistency.   The best compliment I can give is that not only does it satisfy my foodie side of the family, but my picky toddler and no-frills hubby always clear their plates! (We call it fancy mac and cheese around here)

Delicious! I recommend roasting the squash in the oven for 40 minutes or so to bring out the sweetness. I added chopped red mustard greens to mine, which came out fantastically. I imagine any leafy green, such as kale or turnip greens, would go well in it, too!

We loved it! Instead of steaming the squash, I roasted it before mashing because we love the flavor that develops in roasting. I used all 5 cups of stock, unlike some of the other reviewers. It takes longer for the rice to absorb the extra liquid, but the dish is worth the time. Yummy!

The dish is excellent and I recommend it alongside Mary's Meatloaf (an Allrecipes fav of mine), sauteed fresh spinach, homemade french bread, and a green salad - a beautiful Sunday afternoon meal that fed the body and the soul.  I chose to roast my butternut squash in the oven (instead of steaming it as the recipe directs).  I cut the squash in half (length-wise), brushed the flesh with olive oil, salt and pepper, some high quality lightly dried sage, and roasted it (flesh up) until it was completely cooked.  I scooped the squash out with a fork and added it to the risotto as it was cooking.  It's dishes like this risotto that make fall such a delicious, magical time of year.

I did not have the dry wine so I used Moscato. I did not have arborio rice so I used yellow rice. I added chopped mushrooms with the onions. Other than that I followed the recipe. My husband said he could eat it over and over. It was very easy and simple to make.

This was easy and very flavorful.  Nothing to change on this one!!  It takes a little time for the additions of the broth but so worth it.  It is just plain classy

Freaking delicious! Made as per recipe except veggi broth instead of chicken broth.. I was skeptacle about the amount of liquid, but followed the recipe and it was spot on fantastic!!!   Will make this a monthly staple in my kitchen; thanks!!!

For the squash, I cut in quarters, removed seeds, microwaved for 8 mins, scooped out the cooked squash, mashed with a fork! Easy, no mess, and no peeling necsssary!

WOW! This recipe is an absolute winner. I tried this last night, it was my first time making any sort of risotto and it came out better than restaurant quality. After reading other's complaints there was two much chicken stock, I halved the portion. It came out splendid, this is definitely going to be a staple in our home.

This was so good! I have a very picky nephew who even ate it. I used 1.5 cups of rice, and added water to the broth for a total of about 5 cups, but I didn't measure, so I'm not sure how much it actually was. I also roasted the squash instead of steaming, as others had suggested. My kids don't really like onions, so I omitted those. I will be making this again. I served it with a rotisserie chicken.

I agree with jaimebuggy. Bake your squash to make everything easier. I doubled the recipe and found that 3/4 of the liquid worked well.

Made this and the risotto turned out very well! I would beware not to add too much Parmesan as it can easily over power the other flavours. Would definitely make again!

Love this recipe. Always a hit with my family. I usually do a 1.5 multiple so I have leftovers for work. The only change I make is slightly more squash.

This was awesome. Read reviews and baked the squash first then scooped it into a bowl. Also waited to add the squash till the last batch of stock was added. It's a keeper:)

This is a delicious side dish. As other reviews stated, 3 cups of the chicken stock was plenty. I added some garlic to it as well. Will try adding cinnamon next time. I'll definitely be making this again!

Followed the advice of many reviewers, only used 3 cups of broth and added the squash at the end after the majority of the broth was absorbed.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of sage as also recommended, it was just a touch bland without, will add a little more next time. A hit with our NYE dinner and I will make it again when I need a good arm workout!!

Added butter beans for a protein source.  Delicious comfort food!  My husband didn't even realize the recipe contained squash (he thought the orange color was cheese like in a Kraft mac'n cheese box)!!!

Wow! So rich and yummy! I made it vegan by using oil instead of butter and veggie broth. Will have parmesean to sprinkle for non-vegans. I made it in my pressure cooker so it cooks even faster and used 3 cups broth.

Followed the recipe exactly. Not sure how all the reviewers are getting away with 3 cups of broth but I needed all the liquid! The arborio simply wouldn't have cooked without it. Could be a difference in pans or something? Anyways it turned out with perfect texture and tasted fine but really was lacking in complexity. Wish I knew what might have added an extra kick.

Delicious!  Definitely takes a lot later to make then just regular risotto. I did feel 5 cups of chicken stock was a lot. Next time I will use 4 cups or maybe even 3. But hands down...delicious!!!

I doubled the squash (which I roasted before "mashing" with a hand-blender) and left small chunks in the risotto for texture. I substituted ground Thyme for fresh. Then I added a bit more chardonnay and salt than called for to amp up the flavor and it came out AMAZING!

Roasted the butternut with some veg. oil & mixed spices instead of steaming. Also added a bit of dried sage toward the end of cooking which added a lovely depth of flavour.

I made this as a side to a pork roast and it was delicious! I ran out of arborio rice so I used orzo instead. I used about half - 3/4 of the stock. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg, cinnamon & parsley and it really added to the flavour :) will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious!  Based on other reviews, I roasted the squash. Because I was already using the oven, I roasted 4 cloves of garlic. Then I mashed it all together with a little half and half, cumin, cinnamon, and coriander. I didn't have any wine so I skipped that, and I added the squash mixture when the risotto was about 3/4 of the way done. I highly recommend the addition of the roasted garlic and the spices.

I changed the recipe slightly (or not) and slowly pan fried the butternut squash cubes in olive oil. This adds some caramelization and should give it a slightly sweeter note. 
I used vegetable stock as the liquid since I live with a vegetarian.

I've made this twice.  Good as written.  No changes.  Nuke the squash face down  in a little water instead of peeling: easy-peasy.  Be patient. It takes time to soak up all the broth and achieve the right texture.

Delicious! First time making a risotto and the whole family loved it. I followed the recipe as written- but did note that there was too much stock ( which I read several other reviews shared the same comment. I used four cups and it was fine. This dish is so creamy and flavorful. I had to laugh when my son said, " Tastes good, mom. You can't even tell it is squash!"

Very tasty! The squash and the parmesan complement each other so nicely. Even the picky ones in my house inhaled it.

Side note: I pierced the squash with a fork and threw it into the oven whole; 60 min at 350, and it was nice and soft and easy to cut.

This was my first time making risotto. I did enjoy the flavor of this recipe but I did add extra butternut squash and extra rice. I think if I hadn't added the extra rice, it would have been way too much chicken stock. I also baked the squash per another reviewer's suggestion rather than peeling and steaming it. I also dusted the squash with a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Overall ok but not necessarily 5-stars as-written.

This is a very tasty recipe. . The proper way to cook arborio rice is to add liquid small amounts at a time until it is properly cooked to doneness. Do not just add a set ration of liquid all at once especially not at the end as it suggests with adding the remaining stock. If you're familiar with cooking risotto the amounts given in the ingredients will allow you to cook this dish properly if using proper technique.

I added some saffron for extra flavor, and diced the squash, cooked it until very tender, and added it to the risotto without mashing it.  I finish my risotto in the microwave.  Heat all the broth and stir it into to the prepared risotto mixture, microwave on high for 4-6 minutes, then half power for 8 minutes.  I get perfect risotto using this easier method.

As is works ok - a little bland.  One thing I found to add more flavor and save a step (or two) - flavor the chicken stock with what you like (I used cumin, thyme and ginger) and use the stock to steam your squash (instead of water) - then use the stock as indicated.   Flavors more integrated in completed dish.

Stock left over after making risotto?  Freeze & save for a future cold remedy :-)

I thought this risotto was delicious. I've made risotto many times and the amount of broth was perfect for me. It's always nice to have recipes with butternut squash as I get an abundance every summer and they last through the winter.  Thanks Andrea.

I skipped the wine because I didn't have any. Also used veggie bullion instead of chicken.  The only thing I would do differently is maybe add some fresh chopped parsley or basil before serving, because it needed a little more flavor and color.

Delicious and Hearty. Parmesan cheese really completes this dish. We didn't even felt that it needed any salt or pepper.

Made it as specified, took longer than specified for liquid to absorb into the rice, very good flavor and texture. I like my food with a little zing, so add a little garlic pepper sauce to my dish, just right. Yummmmmm

I will definetely be making this again.  I used only 4 cups of Vegetable Broth, and only put my squash in for 10 min.  It wasn't super tender but it added a little bit of texture to the finished product which I liked. Overall, really good and a great Vegetarian main dish!

I have made this exactly as written several times,  and is been perfect. I think those stating that the measurements are off are using a parboiled arborio rice, or a different rice type altogether. I use the Lundberg brand arborio rice, and it cooks up perfectly every time.  Be forewarned that this is a very labor intensive recipe; you'll be stirring for at least 20-30 minutes while adding the hot broth. It's totally worth it.

This is an excellent recipe with plenty of room to customize. I added toasted pine nuts which added another great dimension. The one thing I recommend altering is using reduced sodium stock or making your own and salting sparingly. I used a bullion for mine and the amount used made the dish very salty after it had been cooked down and concentrated in the rice.  This recipe also produced a great deal more than I expected. I got six servings from it.

Exactly what I was craving when I searched for a recipe!!!  I did use others' suggestions and cut back the broth to about 3 cups. I dont like anything too salty and was afraid using too much broth (didnt have anything else on hand) would overdo it. I must say that the people who do not give this all five stars are the ones who change it up. Im going to try more than 3 cups of broth (or stock) next time as I would like mine more creamy, but I dont even want to put leftovers away!!  soooo good!!!  thanks for an awesome recipe!!!  I feel gourmet now!

So delicious! I used the pre-cubed butternut squash (from Costco) which made this much easier. I also took other reviewers' advice and used 3 cups of stock rather than 5. It came out perfectly and I will definitely be making this again.

My mouth started watering just by looking at this picture and I have to say that I was not disappointed one bit!!  This is DELICIOUS, full of such flavor!!

Now that Fall is here...it's just one of those amazing dishes that will put a smile on your face and have you craving it all the time! Enjoy!

This recipe blew me away. Maybe it's because I've never had risotto before, or maybe this recipe really stands above that "this rocked my world" bar, but I am a new believer that this has to be a regular part of my meal rotations. My friends that helped cook this with me went on and on about it, beside themselves with glee over how good it was.  They were shocked that they had lived into their thirties, and had never tasted such a delight. We ate it all between the three of us over the course of two days, and made it again the next night because we just had to have it again. 

The recipe was followed exactly with nuanced ingredient modifications. We used sweet white onions, that happened to be in season, fresh-grated Asiago in place of Parmesan, and this year's vintage Barefoot Pinot Grigio. It helped to have multiple hands around to take turns stirring the pot while the moisture simmers off, and to monitor the texture to perfect creamy consistency. 

Over the moon to have discovered this recipe.

We just made this, it's so good and easy (just time consuming)! I cubed and roasted my squash the day before, then spun it with a 1/2 cup broth in the food processor to mash. I added 4 cloves of garlic to the onion. I only used 3 more cups of broth (so 3.5 total). Waited until the last 3rd of broth went in to add the last 1/2 of the squash, also added spices then (salt, pepper,  nutmeg, coriander). Served with pork tenderloin, which was an excellent pairing. Delicious!

I added some diced cooked chicken and some sliced baby bella mushrooms, and I think without them, this would have been kind of bland. All in all, not bad, but not the best risotto I've ever had.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and my family loved it. The flavor and texture is perfect. I'll make this again for sure. The butternut squash was much easier to work with than I expected. I switched out the chicken stock with vegetarian chicken stock, and that worked fine.

I was worried about how this would turn out since I've not had a lot of experience with eating or cooking risotto. I was happy with this meal, and I was impressed with how each of the flavors complemented each other once the heat died down. This was simple and also gave me more confidence to look at preparing other kinds of risotto dishes.

This recipe is amazing! The squash adds great flavour, I used cooking sherry because I di have white wine used a little bit less because it's salty and didn't have chicken stock so I used water with chicken bouillon cubes,1 1/2, it's the best risotto I've ever tasted!

First time making risotto, and I liked this. I followed some of the suggestions of reviewers and started with 3 cups of broth. As I went along, I only added a bit more to get the consistency I wanted. I also cooked it about 10 min longer than the recipe indicates because it didn't seem soft enough (the bag my risotto came in said to cook 30 min). At the seasoning stage, I also added a few pinches of cinnamon, sage and nutmeg. I put in a garlic cube with the onions, but I'd just like a little more flavoring ...possibly more garlic, basil, mushrooms, more cheese? Thanks Andrea!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed it almost exactly, except I used about 3 cups of broth instead of 5, after reading some of the reviews.  I didn't add any salt at all and didn't think it was needed.  The broth plus the cheese gave it plenty of salt!  It is somewhat sweet due to the squash, but that was fine with me.  It was really good!  I would definitely make it again.

This was a tasty yet different way to prepare butternut squash.  It was a simple recipe which I liked but I think next time I would add some more seasonings like sage or thyme?

If you want a vegan version, use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, olive oil instead of butter, and nutritional yeast instead of parmesan cheese.

Unlike other reviews I found I used almost the full 5c of stock. I found it a bit plain. Next time I will use garlic and add freshly chopped basil or parsley at serving.

Some changes I made were:
roast the squash for more flavour
I replaced the wine some Sleeman Honey Lager and it was great!

This is one of our faves! I peeled and cube the squash then microwave it in a shallow dish with enough water to cover the bottom for 8 minutes- it way way easier to mash and faster too.

Delicious! Easy to make! Did exactly what recipe stated to do. This is not a recipe to walk away from. From start to finish, you are there stirring or adding more ingredients.  I used frozen cubed butternut squash and it still came out great!

Delicious! Takes a little more time Han indicates by this recipe to cook the risotto until it's "creamy." I covered the sauce pan with foil and that seemed to help the risotto cook better.

I loved this recipe! I didn't mash my butternut squash, I boiled it and then diced it into small pieces. Added scallions, white onions and fresh chives from my garden. The white wine is the secret ingredient for this recipe. I'll try it again for sure!

I really enjoyed the risotto. I used pumpkin instead of butternut squash. I added around a teaspoon of nutmeg to give it some more flavor. I also made it with vegetable broth. The whole family enjoyed it.

I made this exactly as directed, except used red wine instead of white because that's all I had.  It didn't make a difference, I don't think.  The recipe came out perfectly.  I used all the stock called for - I think you need to if you want real risotto and not just cooked rice.  It does take a while for it all to be absorbed, but the results are delicious.

This recipe was fabulous! It definitely takes longer than 45 minutes, and I only used about 3.5 cups of stock, but if you have patience and let it cook longer than you normally might cook risotto, it will pay off! Changes I might make for next time (though it really is great the way it is!): Use parmiggiano-reggiano cheese (the nutty flavor gives it the edge over regular parmesan, but it is expensive, so a substitute could be American grana), and toast some sliced or slivered almonds and stir in or sprinkle on top. Oh, and I might use vegetable stock instead of chicken broth.

I served this with steamed broccoli on the side, which was a great accompaniment!

Excellent! Our first time making risotto. I am adding risotto to our monthly menu plan. We cubed the butternut squash and sauté it in a little olive oil and butter. Added it to the rice when adding the chicken stock. This was easy to make and very good.

This was a fantastic recipe. I was a little worried that the rice wouldn't absorb everything, but it was just fine. Lots of flavor; I didn't add any salt or pepper at the end. It was already perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

Superb.  Thank you for sharing.  Featured in allrecipes magazine and I am so happy it was or I wouldn't have considered a squash risotto.  Used 4 cups chicken broth and roasted the squash. No changes.

Just like others said this wasn't very tasty. I put all the extras in to add flavor but it just wasn't there. I love  butternut squash and there are plenty of others recipes for it that are great right on this site. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

We loved this!  I added a little garlic when I added the onion.  I didn't add the squash until the last addition of broth, of which I only used 3 cups.  A little thyme added great flavor, it marries so well with butternut squash.  I usually shy away from risotto because of the amount of butter and time it requires, but this recipe alleviated both problems.  Can't wait to make again, thanks for sharing!

This was just what I was hoping for, fantastic!  I used fresh chopped butternut squash and steamed it in my electric steamer for 12 minutes.  I did reduce the chicken stock to only 3 1/2 cups instead of the five.  Made it very creamy.

Cooked this recipe and it was my first time cooking risotto. We decided to add some chicken to make it a main meal and it was perfect! I cooked it as the recipe says but think I will add less chicken stock next time and maybe some basil or parsley. But I will loved it as is advertised!

This was my first time making risotto and it tasted delicious! I didn't have arborio rice, but I threw in the rice that I did have in the house: half a cup of white rice and half a cup of quick-cooking brown rice, and it turned out fine. I didn't end up using all of the stock, but the risotto was still creamy. I also omitted the parmesan. Will definitely make again!

I really loved this risotto! It was delicious! I made a few alterations after trying a very similar recipe in this ebook called Healthy Cheats by the Skinny Chef! I would definitely recommend checking it out!

Ssooo creamy and ssoooo delicious. Adding the squash in early helps make it so flavourful.
A couple of things that I did different...
I never use wine for risotto
I use veg stock instead of chicken.
I add toasted pine nuts 
I put in spinach at the end
I put in more parmesan then it asks for

I'll be making this time and time again.

I used veggie broth and upped the fresh parm to 1/2c. I am disappointed I cannot taste the wine more in the finished product. I might make this again but use at least 2/3 c. wine.

Amazing recipe! I loved the squash in the risotto. I did make a few changes based on other reviews. First, I cut the squash, seasoned with salt and pepper, and baked it for 45 minutes. I also used 4 cups of stock instead of 5. I will definitely make this again!

This is a good basic recipe...I used low sodium (150 g or less) vegetable broth. I used more white wine in lieu of broth. I also added some chopped mushrooms (they were a mix of the more exotic ones, probably 3/4 Cup). I added 3-4 large fresh sage leaves (chopped) toward the end. I added ginger, cardamom, nutmeg  cinnamon, coriander and curry to taste. I just keep sampling and watching until....and while I did not roast the squash, I agree that it could make the flavor more robust! And I would consider adding some roasted pine nuts.

A wonderful sidedish!  I'd never made risotto before and always wanted to.  Directions and timing were Right On!  The only thing I did differently was that I substituted baked hubbard squash for the butternut because it was what I had on hand.  When I mashed it I left a few lumps in it.  What a wonderful dish.  My husband, a certified vegetable hater, loved it.  Definitely FIVE stars!

This recipe is quite simply wonderful... and it's healthy. So often I find the top rated dishes loaded with fats and sugar - anyone can make those kinds of recipes taste great. This is creamy, stick to your ribs, fall goodness, with very little added fat. Prepare to be flexible with your stock. I needed an extra cup. You can tweak away and use this as a kind of starter. I can also envision a sweet version using apple juice instead of stock and loads of autumn spices.

Made it this weekend.  My husband loved it.  Per many of the reviewers, I cut the stock to 4cups, upped the squash mash to 3cups and used 1-1/2cup rice.  Came out perfect.  Will make again

Delicious.  I used 4 cups of chicken broth and a little extra butternut squash.
I roasted the butternut squash by cutting it in half, spooning out the seeds then baking it at 400 for about 25 minutes.  Then you can just scoop and smash.

Firstly, this recipe IS tasty - I added quite a bit of pepper and almost half a cup of cheese, not the 1/4 called for. But I gave it three stars because the proportions are off for sure. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup MORE rice to soak up all that stock and this recipe is HUGE - I'm giving some away because even with leftovers, there's only 3 of us in my household and there's no way we can finish it off. Also, it does not take 35 minutes to cook. Took me closer to an hour!!!! This is not a quick weeknight meal addition. Give yourself some time for this one. The taste is good but realistically is subjective to how much cheese/salt/pepper and what kind of squash (freshly roasted/store bought chunks/frozen) you use.

Update:  This is a fabulous recipe that you can make even better (if you can believe it) if you roast the butternut squash instead of steaming it.  Just cut it up in cubes and drizzle with olive oil and a little salt and pepper and bake at 425 for about 20 minutes.  Test to be sure it's tender.  And then smash just like the recipe says and follow all other directions.  Soooooooo good.

A little time consuming, but all good risotto is. I have made this twice. Once with butternut squash and once with fresh pumpkin and top it off with a garlic, wine sautéed shrimp. Both fabulous!

Fantastic, creamy dish! I followed the advice of a few of the reviewers (slicing and baking the squash in the oven skin side down at 400 for 1 hour and adding A LOT of minced crimini mushrooms) and it was delicious. My husband helped himself to 3 servings! Definitely a keeper. Served it as a side dish with poached fish and a nice salad...

Delish!  I did some change ups - substituting Campbell's V8 Butternut Squash Soup for the squash and reducing the stock to 4 cups.  It gets better every time!!!

When I first made this, I could not stop eating it out of the pot before I finally gave myself a healthy serving into a bowl.  It was so creamy and delicious! When I went to reheat some leftovers today, however, it was very, very thick and I needed to put some milk in it to thin it out. Like some other people, I left out some of the stock, which I wish I hadn't now. If you are going to eat the whole recipe in one sitting, then omit some of the stock. But if you think you will have leftovers, don't! Overall very delicious!

Taste is good. Pretty easy recipe for risotto. I didn't have time to roast the squash, and didn't want to chop it raw (it is a real pain), so I  cut it in half, scooped out the seeds/strings, covered it in plastic wrap and microwaved it on high for 8 min. Worked wonderfully..... and so easy!

Great Recipe! After going over some reviews, I decided to roast the squash, topping it with some cinnamon and brown sugar at 400 for about 40 minutes or so.. scooped it out easily... very happy I did that! I did use about 4 cups of the stock, and it turned out amazing! Didn't have enough Parmesan, so I added a touch of cream.. Turned out great! Friends were impressed :)

This was a hit! This is the only second time I have made Risotto.  The squash added so much character, flavor and texture.  Does take time though.  Add the liquid only one cup at a time and stir till absorbed then add more liquid.  Very good!!

Easy to make and very creamy. I messed up the wine portion (used a sweet reisling instead of a chardonnay or something dry) but it was still very good. I thought it could use a bit more squash, though.

It was a good recipe to follow for this risotto, although I'd recommend doubling the Parmesan cheese because the flavor turned out to be a little bland. (I only prepared it for 2 servings though, so that might have impacted the flavoring somehow.)

I used all 5 cups of the chicken stock, possibly a little more, not sure if it's because I'm in Colorado and rice takes longer to cook at high altitudes.  I love this and I'm so glad I found it before Thanksgiving as it will grace my table this year. Thank you for posting it!

This took a lot longer than 35 minutes to cook, but it was well worth the wait. Absolutely delicious! I paired this with another recipe from this site - Italian Chicken (chicken breasts marinated in italian dressing).

Excellent risotto - easy to prepare. I followed the suggestion to reduce the chicken broth to 3 cups but otherwise followed the recipe as written. This will be in our regular autumn and winter rotation. Thanks for the post!

This is excellent. I did roast the squash rather than steam. Roasted with allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg and seasoned heavily with pepper and a little salt. I also used asiago cheese because Publix was out of parm for some reason. Cut down to 3 cups veggie stock as some recommenders suggested. I've never made risotto before and the recipe was really easy to follow.

Great. Husband loves it! I had a lot of squash. To avoid the mixture becoming too thick before the rice was cooked I only added about a third in the beginning and added the rest once the rice was already cooked. With the extra squash and about 1/2 a cup of extra rice I used 5 cups of stock. For some extra flavor I added a little cummin and garlic and stirred in about half a block of frozen spinach. This worked really well.

Oh, YUM!  This was my first time making risotto, and this recipe turned out great!  Left out the wine, because we didn't have any in the house.  Used several tips from previous reviewers: mixed cinnamon and nutmeg in the butternut puree, added about 1/3 of the puree with each addition of the broth.  I also tasted and adjusted the salt and pepper just before each addition of broth.Added freshly grated pecorino at the end and the flavour was lovely - sweet and just salty enough with a little bite from the fresh ground pepper.  Definitely will make again and again and again!

Very good and creamy.  Used 3 1/2 cups of broth.  Needs a clove or two of garlic.  Next time.  Serving it to my toddler with some chicken.  Great as a side dish.

I made this for my toddler actually and he certainly liked it. But I personally found it a bit boring compared to other risottos. The stock should be about 4 cups not 5.

This was unbelievably good! We tried it before adding cheese and thought it was great, then went ahead and added the cheese. So rich and creamy. Every member of the family liked this. It takes awhile for the rice to soak up the liquid, but otherwise it's and easy and impressive dish.

I keep getting butternut squash in my weekly farm share and was running out of ways to prepare it.  This recipe was great, loved the flavor, and was a great comfort meal with bread and salad.  It was my first risotto and I didn't ruin it!  I used 4 cups of veggie broth rather than 5 and basmati rice rather than arborio since that's what I had on hand. I'll definitely make it again.

AMAZING.  My husband says this is the best thing I've ever made!!  It is delicous, and tastes like it should be loaded with fat, and really isn't!  I added some leeks with the onions, and only used 4c. of broth.  Wonderful.

I thought this recipe was great. Really yummy. The taste was so-so before the parm cheese, but with the cheese i couldn't stop eating it. I used vegetable stock intead and following the other reviewers only used 3 cups, it turned out great. I did also roast the squash in the oven rather than boil it. I think it added a nice nutty flavor and it was very easy to peel. Keeper!

I made this in my rice cooker and it turned out great. I used apple cider and water instead of stock, and added cardamom and cinnamon. I steamed cubed squash and spooned it over a pile of the risotto. It really was very good, kind of sweet like a rice pudding and very filling. My husband and I are vegetarian so we omitted the stock and I wanted to try it with on-hand ingredients. Thanks, next time I will make it closer to the original recipe.

this turned out really great.  i ended up using short grained brown rice by mistake (not paying enough attention!), so i think it took a bit longer to cook, but i was still very pleased with the results!

I loved this dish and would definitely prepare it again.  I do agree - stock can definitely be reduced.  The risotta I used was a creamy parmesan so it added even more flavor.

This was very good. I added some baby bella mushrooms to it right at the very end of cooking. I think its important to use good fresh parmesan cheese as well, not that stuff in a can.

I MADE THIS BECAUSE I LEFT OVER SQUASH AND NEEDED A SIDE DISH. MY HUSBAND WRINKLED HIS NOSE AT IT WHILE I WAS COOKING IT BUT HE RATED IT AS A 10!!! MY KIDS THOUGHT IT WAS OK. I ADDED A DASH OF FRESH GRATED NUTMEG AND I THINK THAT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. WE WILL BE HAVING AGAIN AS THE ADULTS LOVED IT. OH, AND I CUBED MY SQUASH AND BOILED IT IN MY STOCK UNTIL SOFT, THEN PUSHED IT THROUGH A RICER AND ADDED TO THE RISOTTO AT THE END OF COOKING.

Very tasty! I just baked the squash at 350 for 45 minutes and then forked it out of the shells - worked wonderfully.
I also reduced the stock to 3 cups and it seemed about right.

First: I used 3 cups of broth instead of 5, and it worked perfectly. 

Second:  I was surprised how much I really liked this recipe.  I was worried that it would be too bland for me, but that definitely wasn't the case.  You could really taste the sqaush, the wine, and the cheese with the risotto.  I would absolutely make this again.

This was delicious.  I used frozen squash to save time and added a few cloves of garlic.  Yum!  My kids wouldn't touch it, but more for me and my husband.

I am NOT a chef and this was simple and wonderful! I used 5 veggie bullion cubes to 4 cups of water and used almost all of it.  I had read the previous reviews and thought a stronger stock/bullion might work well and it turned out fantastic!  My husband who loves to eat meat was perfectly satisfied with this vegetarian version.  I will definitely cook again!

This was delicious! I used short grain brown rice, which took a little longer and used an extra cup of broth/stock to soften.  It was incredible - very tasty!

mmmmmmmmmmmm...it's worth all the work.  i didn't read the reviews before i made it so i had a lot of stock left over (it really only needs about 2/3 what it calls for).  i used vegetable broth, didn't have enough so i added about 8 oz of butternut squash soup - yummy.
