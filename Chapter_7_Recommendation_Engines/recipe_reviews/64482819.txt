Excellent!!! I loved this recipe for mussels. I did have to make a few changes due to dietary restrictions. I subbed Earth Balance® for the butter and So Delicious® coffee creamer for the heavy cream. I wasn't sure about the amount of parsley so I put in 10 springs, finely chopped. The cooking time depends on the pot, size of the mussels and the heat. Mine cooked up perfectly in four minutes. Definitely have some crusty bread to mop up all of that delicious sauce.
