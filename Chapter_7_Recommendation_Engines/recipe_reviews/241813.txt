Great stuff! I followed the recipe for 5 servings instead of 20 as written and used all fresh vegetables instead of frozen or canned. It cooked thoroughly in 6 hours but wasn't as soupy as an original Booyah. Regardless, it was delicious. The flavour is country-style and rustic. The seasonings just accent the dish and allow the flavour of the vegetables, beef and chicken to come through. No oil, no gluten, no dairy, adjust the salt as you wish, this is definitely a dish to take for a pot-luck or large gathering and everyone will be pleased. Thank you wbartelme for sharing your recipe.

Cut the recipe in half and it came out well. The only problem was it was too salty, likely because the recipe calls for not only salt and celery salt but also canned vegetables (which can be high in sodium). If I make this again, I'll either use fresh vegetables or sharply reduce the salt.

have made many times in the past year. The only thing I add is 1/2 lemon and zest for the over the top Wisconsin flavor :) When I want more of a stew texture I throw in 1/2C rice to thicken it up.

This was delicious!  I cut the recipe in half,  and my family was glad that we still had leftovers the next evening.  The only thing which I did differently was to use 'frozen' green beans (along w/the other frozen vegetables), lower sodium chicken & beef stocks, and lower sodium tomatoes (for health reasons).  I also added a large clove of finely minced garlic.  This came out to be a very tasty and healthy dish, and I'll definitely make it again, especially during the winter months.

I simmered all of the ingredients in an 8-qt. dutch oven on the stove-top for 3 hours because my slow cooker is only 4 qt., and I knew it wouldn't hold all of the ingredients.  I used about 1 T. Better Than Bouillon Vegetable concentrate, instead of Swanson's, (which is no longer available); and canned moose meat, instead of beef stew meat.  I also cut the salt to 1 T., but still thought that was too much.  My husband thought this was the best stew he's ever had, and I also liked it, in spite of a little more salt than I would prefer, so I'm sure I'll be making this often this winter.  I like that it makes enough that there's plenty to freeze in gallon Ziploc bags to heat up when we're to busy to cook.

Very hearty and robust stew!  I had to add (2TBSP) minced garlic to the recipe just because I like garlic. Use fresh vegetables for over the top results. There was a bit too much salt for me but it was easily remedied. Took 3 large, peeled Idaho Potatoes and placed them whole in the Stew about half way through the cooking process, they acted as Salt Sponges and removed the excess salt (threw them away when stew was ready). I suggest you go primal and cook outside so everyone can enjoy the wonderful aromatic smell coming off the stew.

I would rate it 5 stars if it weren't for all the salt! If you use fresh ingredients and cut out as much of the salt as you can, this is a great recipe. My rule of thumb is start with it plain: you can always add more later if you need to. So I only used the broth and no other salty ingredients and it was plenty salty.  If you use the Better Than Bouillon you can add it very easily later on as you're cooking.

OMgosh.  This truly IS good!  Yep, I cut down the salt and it's still a little too salty (for me).  Don't make the full recipe unless you have a slow cooker the size of a hot tub!  I halved it and STILL couldn't fit in the potatoes.  I cubed and boiled them separately in another BIG pot then stirred everything together when the slow-cooking stuff was finished.  Since frozen veggies come in a mix of corn, carrots, and beans -- I just used bags of those.  I cut up the chicken and beef into small, bite-sized pieces.  I think when I make it again, I'll do what I've learned from reading these reviews -- brown the beef in a skillet first.  Maybe it's me but beef in a slow-cooker (unless a brown sauce is used) just doesn't LOOK as good.  Couldn't find packets of veggie base so bought the kind in a jar.  Just guessed at the equivalent -- it looked like Vegemite!  Can't wait to take this to work in  lunches!

WAY TOO SALTY!!! I had to pour the stew through a colander and briefly rinse the veggies and meat, then put back in the crock pot with fresh broth to make it edible. Even then, it isn't very interesting.

Very tasty. Based on reviews, I cut back on the salt and I did use fresh veg rather than frozen but I love the time friendly option.

Great option for a pot luck.

If I made it again I would cut the recipe in half. I would also cut down on pepper and salt. It was very good but took two hours to put together and filled a 7 qt slow cooker and half of a 3 qt slow cooker. Made a lot!

Good stuff and good ingredients, but you can't make it as the recipe calls for.  It won't fit in a crock pot!  Also, 2 cans of broth make it too soupy.  So play around with proportions and it comes out quite good.

Too much salt & oregano overpowers everything else   Amounts of salt, oregano, & basil need to be cut back. Probably won't make again.

Very bland.  Add some rough chopped bell peppers, chopped and seeded jalopeno peppers, celery, sweet onions, cajun seasoning, smashed capers and you turn a bland meal into a culinary delight!

I did not make any changes to this recipe.  It is super salty!!  I think 1/4 cup of salt is way too much for this recipe!  I used a large slow cooker and it was not done in 6 hours.  I had to cook it an additional 1 1/2 hours on high.

I made this with two cubed, skinless chicken breasts  (no beef0 & fresh cut veggies. I eliminated the  corn & bell pepper & added  zucchini. I used only 1 tsp of basil & oregano & added two springs of fresh rosemary.  Unquestionably one of my favorite "stew " recipes.

We LOVED this!  I left out the salt based on other reviews.  Some of us added salt to taste after cooking.  This was too much for my crock pot so I cooked about 1/3 of it in a dutch oven.  Both ways were great.  We prefer it less soupy so I thickened it with a cornstarch slurry (about 6 tbs corn starch and 6 tbs water mixture).  The meat was tender and easy to chew for a senior who has trouble chewing. This will be a regular for us.  Oh and the frozen left overs were even better!

This was very low fat and easy to do.  I only wanted to make half the recipe and it was easy to do.  Next time, I'll cut my potatoes into smaller pieces.  I don't like chicken thighs, but they were good in this dish.  Don't know if I'll make it again, my stew recipe is much better, but not as easy as this.

Made this exactly as directed except cut recipe in half.  But it still made too much for us as we get tired of the same thing after two meals. Which is what we got out of it before tossing the rest.  It was okay. I have nothing critical to say about the stew but I'm not sure I would make it again.  Just wasn't over the top about it.  Hubby liked it but again, he didn't rave, just said it was okay.

Big hit with everyone in the family. Flavorful, despite how simple the ingredients were. I adjusted the amounts for 8 instead of 20, and did not put in the beef or beef stock. Also, accidentally chopped rather than shredded the cabbage (live on the wild side, I say).  The only change I'd make for next time is to increase the amount of chicken (easily double it). It was pretty hard to come by a piece.

Yes, we agree: This recipe is now in our "favorites " category. Full of healthy ingredients and flavor. We did not add salt.  With all of the salt in the chicken, beef and veggie broths there is no need at all to add any more. We substituted celery salt for the celery seed. Nothing better than coming home after a long, snowy day to the aroma and tastes of this delicious meal.

The salt content made it almost inedible. The original recipe is way too much for one crock pot.  It should be halved or put into two separate large crock pots.

Recipe was way to salty. I'm going to cut it down next time I make it. Also, it was way too much stuff for my large oval crock pot. I had to split it up to cook it. I did add some rice to take care of the liquid. Great recipe.

Way too much salt. I would consider not adding any salt, with the boullion and celery salt already.

This was so good!!! The crock pot wasn't big enough for everything, so I used 1.5 lbs of chicken and left out the green pepper, oregano, and beef. I also used half the salt and added 2tablespoons of heathers original dirty goodness seasoning. It really was the perfect chicken stew and one we will revisit!

I halved almost all the ingredients (some even less) and it still barely fit in the crockpot. For spices, I recommend 1 tbsp each of salt, oregano, and basil, and 1 tsp of pepper. The potatoes weren't getting tender so I put it on high for the last hour. Could probably have been on high for another 30 mins for them to soften up more.

Added to favorites. I made half the recipe with fresh or frozen vegetables.  I omitted the table salt (taking recommendations of others) and was glad I did. Would only add to taste if needed. I could not find vegetable  packet but used better than bouillon vegetable flavor  instead and result was tasty. Husband thought it needed less pepper but I thought that part was fine. Could use garlic or extra spices as you like but a good standard booyah recipe. I also used chopped cabbage instead of shredded as that was what I had on hand.

I have been searching the net for a small (less than 50slow cooker “Booya” recipe and finally found this one.  It was excellent!! I made this recipe to the T, except for zero regular salt, and it was perfect saltiness.  And I added 2T lemon juice and 1T mince garlic.  You *will need* an 8 quart slow cooker if you make the full recipe.

I have a small crock-pot so I cut the servings down to 5 and still was almost overflowing . ( a lot of ingredients) 

Because so many said it was too salty I did not use any salt but the rest of the recipe I followed to a T.

It cooked on low for  7 hrs then on high for 1 1/2 hrs more.

There was maybe a slight taste of salt so salt & garlic was added after it was finished cooking.

Not bad, very easy to prepare, maybe I'll try more broth and thicken it up some next time..

This is a very good and easy dish to make.   BUT---.-    Don't use frozen carrots.  Use either canned or fresh.  Same with the green been's.  These two always come out tough, or chewy.  If you use fresh they are great.  Why ruin a very good dish with frozen veges.  Maybe I'm too picky, but that's the way I like it.

cut sodium by 90% and was not impressed by taste or dish itself. I'm surprised recipe is even listed here as I feel no one should ingest this much salt in one meal. Will not be seeing anything like this again.

the chicken thighs were marinated in chipotle sauce when I bought them, were the only thing different.  My hubby Gene & I thought it was a 5 star.  Will be making it again for the church pot luck suppers too.  We both love soups and this Booyah will fit right into our recipes......thanks   patsy lance

I used my 6-qt crock pot insert to make 1/2 this recipe (10 servings), and it was just the right size.  I followed the recipe, except that I used fresh/frozen vegetables (no canned), and omitted the salt.  I also substituted celery seed for the celery salt.  I wasn't sure about mixing chicken and beef in the same dish, but gave it a try.  It was delicious, and so simple to put together!  I started my slow cooker on high for about 3 hours, then reduced to low.  That seemed to be about the right amount of time/temp to have the vegetables cooked, but not overcooked.  I will definitely make this again.  The leftovers will go in the freezer for a pre-prepared meal another day.   Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and so easy to make.  I used fresh vegetables instead of canned and skipped the cabbage.  Served over whole grain brown rice.  The kids loved it too!

I made it but it lacked any zing. It reminded me of a heart healty soup I have made before. Being from South Texas I decided to kick it up a notch. I used a jar of Clint's medium hot salsa plus put a little shreaded cheese on top of each bowl full. Now I love it. I suppose I will rename this Booyah Yaw.

We made this and loved it! We used only chicken instead of chicken and beef. We used some fresh veggies and some frozen. And we added a parsnip. We will certainly use this recipe again. Perfect winter warmer.

I had never made pork stew before but it was a hit.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I will certainly make it again.  BTW, I made the mashed potatoes for the first night and then the left overs went over brown basmati rice.  Delicious.

This scores high with me because it's a slow cooker meal with no need to brown any meat or veggies. Just put them in the cooker with the added spices, etc and let it cook and it turns out great. Yum. I've made this a few times so far.

There is a ridiculous amount of seasoning in this recipe. It tasted terrible!
