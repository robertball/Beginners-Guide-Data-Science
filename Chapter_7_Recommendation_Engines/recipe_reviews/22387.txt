I had a birthday dinner for my cousin this past Sunday. All 4 of my guest and myself included really liked everything about this recipe. I gave everyone a small loaf to take home with them. It was simple and delicious! :)

Nice and easy - I'll use this all the time for everyday bread.

If it is too yeasty for your taste, try proofing the yeast with a small amount of the water and adding a little bit of honey. The problem (if it was sticky) was probably not the yeast but the moisture content. Just add a bit of flour in and it'll come together just fine.  Obviously using bread flour is important since AP really won't work here. A little butter or egg wash over the top might help the appearance a bit.

This bread is chewy and flavorful.  I like to shape it into a dozen mini loaves and bake them on a cookie sheet.  These make excellent rolls for pasta dinners.

The recipe was ALMOST all it promised.  It was easy to make, yeasty, coarse-textured, but only slightly crusty, and a bit dense.  Apparently, this is just not the recipe I was looking for.  Although I added the salt, it must have needed more.  Before today, I had never before sprinkled salt on bread, to make it taste good! I added 1/2 cup flour, because I wasn't sure the dough was supposed to be so very sticky.  I thought maybe I should really add more, but didn't since this was the first time I've tried the recipe.

Too yeasty, when it comes together it is very sticky and cannot be kneaded properly - the Kitchenaid could not form it into a ball, odd directions. Too simple - needs more directions to clarify process and apperance of dough.

This was a really good basic bread recipe.  I was making the Paul Bunyan Burgers from this site and this bread stood up really well to the burger.  Did not fall apart.  Very nice.  I halved the recipe and made 6 large buns out of it.   Thanks for posting the recipe.

This recipe as advertised was a crusty bread. I used a 9x5 pan after dividing the quantity in half. I baked for 37 minutes, sharing time as none is indicated in directions. Others times for smaller loaves I would assume. I did not find it too yeasty as some have commented. It was a good base for garlic bread for spaghetti meal.

I LOVE this recipe. I've made it quite a few times and  each time the bread comes out fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. This is a simple recipe that I recommend to everyone. P.s: this is great with olive oil.

Everyone loves this bread. I love how easy it is! The only change is that I substitute Lecithin granules for oil whenever I can in my recipes, especially breads.

I found this bread to be delicious. The only thing I did different was I added 1 teaspoon of sugar(something for the yeast to eat and work a little quicker). Much quicker than my usual go to recipe, with great results and taste.

I have made this recipe multiple times with no changes.  If you love yeasty, lite, and crisp bread.  This is going to be your new favorite.  We had my wife's sister's family over and her 9 year old almost ate a whole loaf.  It is also hard to resist by more refined palates...

didn't get a good rise, but that's been an on going problem. would be good with soup, pasta, anything with gravy. had to guess the baking time, 25 minutes might have been a bit too long.

Decent bread and very easy.  Needed more liquid, so I added about a tablespoon of oil to the mix first, then added enough liquid for it to come together.  Bakes up large loafs, but they aren't all that grainy--a good thing with my husband, who is pretty picky.  Pretty tasty overall.  Thanks for the recipe!
