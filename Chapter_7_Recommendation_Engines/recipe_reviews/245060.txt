This turned out delicious! I only used about 1 tbsp. of honey and it was plenty sweet. I also placed them in an 8x8 pan and cut them into squares. Great recipe!

Loved this!  My kids are both teenagers who love to snack and who love sweets.  This was a great way to provide a healthy snack that they both really enjoy!  I added coconut and replaced the flax seeds with wheat germ.  Winner!

I loved the taste of everything together and how simple it was to make. Only thing i would change is to only use 1/2 cup of honey or like 1/3 of a cup more oats because it was a little sweet.

I make these every 2 weeks, and double it.  My high energy teenage boys love them. I have passed this recipe on at least 6 times.

Too sweet! We added dried cranberries, chia seed and walnuts. Next time, we will reduce the honey to about half.  I would consider adding puffed brown rice as a variation.

Kids and I both loved these. My daughter is in a running club and snacks on protein/energy bites on her way to and from practice. They basically have a home in her track bag!

These were pretty good. I didn't have enough flaxseed, so I used oats to substitute. If you really want to make it healthy, omit the chocolate chips.

I used less honey, but enough to get them to stick together, and they are plenty sweet. My family loves them.

I didn't do as much honey, nor as many chocolate chips. the flax seed gives it a good crunch.

Delicious and kind of nutritious!  Perfect to have a little something sweet, but still feel like you're eating something kind of good for you!

I added a 1/2 cup of sweetened shredded coconut and cut back a little on the honey.
