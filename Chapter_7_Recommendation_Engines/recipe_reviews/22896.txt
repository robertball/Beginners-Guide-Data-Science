This recipe did not turn out too well for me. I was expecting a frozen fruit salad with a sugary glaze. Instead, I got banana mush that I had to throw away. THis recipe is more like a smoothie than a salad. I would try slicing the bananas, rather than mashing them. It just made a disgusting looking mess.
