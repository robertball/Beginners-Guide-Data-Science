I used melted margerine and "soured" lactose-free whole milk in this recipe. Substituting those ingredients in this recipe made no difference--they turned out absolutely fabulous. Lightly sweet, incredibly moist and with the perfect cornbread-y texture. I would have never thought of adding pineapple to corn bread batter but it totally works. This would make a GREAT breakfast muffin though my family thought this made a pretty excellent snacking muffin.

Wonderful taste medley.  These are so easy to make and go well with chilli or soup.  I improvised with golden pineapple baked for an hour to dry it out and 1/4 cup brown sugar added to the browned butter.  If you love pineapple don't miss trying this recipe.

I made this in a 10" cast iron skillet and it was just    outstanding!  I put a little oil in the skillet and let it preheat in 400 degree oven, then added the batter  and baked at that temp. for 25 minutes.  I must say you are a genius, Chef John.

It's hard to compare when I had to change the recipe to make it gluten free, and
use canned unsweetened pineapple, but it was fabulous. I used a cup for cup gf flour, one cup of 
squeezed out canned pineapple and added about 1/4 cup olive oil in addition to the 1/2 cup butter.
Great recipe to work with.

These muffins are off-the-hook good. Not a combo I'd thought of before, pineapple and cornmeal, but it really works. There's one non-stellar review on here, and it looks like the reviewer may have followed the recipe incorrectly: don't simmer the pineapple in the butter! First brown the butter, and only after that process is complete and the brown butter is removed from the stove do you add the chopped pineapple. You mix them well and then just let that sit for a while (the recipe says 20 minutes, which works well). These are great, I've already made 2 batches and plan on making several more!

I made these tonight and served with black beans and rice. My family absolutely loved them. I added a little bit of brown sugar to the batter. Good recipe!

I loved the cornmeal and dried pineapple combo, but I had to add a couple tablespoons of sweetener.  While we liked flavor, we found the texture more dry and crumbly than we like.

These muffins were not fluffy and quite hard. I expected them to be a bit better with the extra effort to simmer the pinapple in the butter. I will not make them again.
