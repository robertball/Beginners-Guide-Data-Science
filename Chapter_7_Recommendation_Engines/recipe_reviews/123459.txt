The sauce is delicious (I used red wine and wild mushrooms), but the steak could use mre flavor--next time, I'll mix pepper in the flour.

I love the recipe... I made it for my birthday dinner and I did not sprinkle the steaks with flour, but I put the flour in the broth instead, and then when I added the broth the sauce thickened fast and it was delicious... everyone loved it :-)

Excellent recipe, I had to improvise with ingredients I had on hand so I used chicken broth instead of beef, white whine vinegar instead of white wine, and seasoned the flour with salt and pepper before browning steak....the whole family ate it even my 2 year old picky eater!

This recipe was really a crowd pleaser!  I actually seared the steaks then threw them on thr grill, and instead of flouring the steaks I put the flour and mushrooms in a ziploc and sauteed the muchrooms in the pan where I'd just seared the steaks.  Perfecto!

Loved it...did thicken the sauce at the end with a little flour and seasoned the steak with a little salt & pepper before cooking...Other than that followed the recipe as written and was very pleased. Thanks for sharing

I made this last night exactly as written, and it was quite bland. No one in the family liked it :(

The mushroom sauce was really good!  I'm not going to comment on the steak because I had such a poor cut in the freezer that it isn't worth rating.

Not bad. The sauce was great.  I used red wine instead of white.

Very tasty. I used red wine instead of white, and chicken broth instead of beef. After I deglazed and brought to a boil, I found I still had to thicken with a touch of flour. Very flavorful topping for the steaks.

A little bland as someone else noted.  Onion to mushroom ratio too high.  I would use more mushrooms next time if I make it again (which I won't) and use red wine for a heartier flavor.
