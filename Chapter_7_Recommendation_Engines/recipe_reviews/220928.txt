These were really good and not too sweet!  I followed the recipe as written, except that I used a food processor and added 1/4 tsp. each of almond and vanilla extracts and about 1/3 cup of almonds.  I baked them on parchment paper in a 350 degree oven for 18 minutes.  Afterwards, when they were cool, I melted semi-sweet chocolate with a very small amount of shortening and drizzled it on top of each macaroon.  They were slightly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.

Yumm!! These are great! I did not use as much sugar and used whole wheat flour and they were still great. I ussually don't use whole wheat flour but I did not have all purpose. Also I used about 1/4 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon almond, and a little more coconut than what was called for!

I made these for my husband who LOVES macaroons. I on the other hand, can't stand coconut and have never tried them before (nor will I). His feedback was that the flavor was good, but he wished they were a little bigger and had more uniform crispiness around the outside. They are moist and look pretty. He keeps eating them though, so something must be right!

I've worked my way through nearly every macaroon recipe on here.  This is by far the best.  Light in the center, crunchy around the edges, addictive!  :)  Only thing I did differently was I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pans, and doubled the recipe. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly, the timing was spot on, and BOY are they good!

So easy to make and so delicious. They were a huge hit at a recent dinner party. Only problem is that they're hard to stop eating.

I made these exactly as written and they were both beautiful and delicious. I grew up eating coconut macaroons from a can at Passover time, and these are better and so easy. I used a melon baller to make pretty little mounds. Yummmm!

I rated this five stars as I don't like coconut macaroons but these tasted great. HOWEVER MINE BURNED ON THE BOTTOM AT 15 minutes SO WATCH THEM VERY CLOSELY.. you might have to reduce cooking time.

SUPER yummy. I had to add an extra egg white to make it stick together enough to bake, and I left them in the oven till they were lightly browned, bc I love them chewy. I will definitely make them again.

I made the recipe exactly as stated, I doubled everything to use the entire bag of coconut. I just read an article in the Chicago Tribune that one coconut macaroon a day stops diarrhea in people that have IBS /D.

Easy, fast. I made them just as directed, but they were too sweet for me. If I make them again I'll cut that way down.

I had to weigh the coconut as I didn’t have a 7oz package. If my scale was correct, it calls for 2.5 c of coconut. I used unsweetened coconut, and maybe the longer thread and sweetened coconut would add some moisture. I had to use a gluten free flour as I was making them for a friend who hadn’t have gluten...used Cassava flour which is supposed to be very close to wheat flour. I used a cookie scoop to form them and had to pack the batter into it and carefully transfer it to the sheet. (Like others, I used parchment which worked well) after fighting to get the first three cookies onto the sheet in one piece, I added another egg white which helped somewhat but still had to be very careful. The baked cookie was very dry and not chewy. I don’t like giving a bad rating to a recipe as I know little changes can make a difference, but I am disappointed with this recipe.

I just made these using suggestions from others. I added chopped almonds, slightly decreased the amount of sugar, used parchment paper. I also increased the baking time by several minutes. Great-tasting cookie...thanks for posting!

Easy to make.  Liked the almond extract and sugar better than the recipe calling for sweetened condensed milk.  The sweetness factor was just right.

Kids loved it! I left it in for a little longer for a nice crunch on the outside but the inside was perfect. I used coconut flour since I am gluten free. What a great recipe. Thank you.

How in the world is this getting good reviews? 

I am into healthy eating and love making coconut macaroons (no sweetened condensed milk) every now and then to satisfy my sweet tooth, and these were a huge let down AND I wasted an entire bag of coconut flakes on this ! 

I used my mixer to beat two egg whites from large eggs.  They were nice and fluffy so I proceeded to add in the entire bag of coconut flakes. (7 OUNCES LIKE IT CALLS FOR!) Big mistake.  I proceeded to add the remaining ingredients and attempted to place them on my sheet pan and when they were done cooking, as expected, didn’t stick together.

Desperate to satisfy my sweet tooth, I still ate some and tossed most in the trash.  Very disappointed and it is rare I get on these things and leave reviews but this recipe is so flawed I had to get on here and warn people, don’t make this !  There are much more better coconut macaroon recipes out there and I’m angry at myself for wasting ingredients on this one.

They turned out great!! They were SUPER easy and took no time at all to make. I also dipped some of them in chocolate and that tasted pretty good. (;

My mom had a craving for coconut macaroons.  She asked me to find a recipe without sweetened condensed milk, which are very sweet for her taste.  I am so pleased with this recipe.  They came out great! I put in 1/4 cup sugar and they were sweet enough.  I scooped them with a heaping spoon of a melon baller- just the right size.  I can't wait to share them with her-  I know she is going to love them!!

We enjoyed these very much! I'm gluten & dairy free, my husband likes to do paleo, so I was excited to find this recipe. I added vanilla to it as well, then dipped the bottom in semi-sweet chocolate, they were a HUGE hit! I will be making them again!

This will be my go-to coconut macaroon recipe.   I've made several batches with condensed milk and they  didn't hold together no matter how I adjusted the amount of milk..  This one, with egg white and flour, did, beautifully.  I have a hypothyroid condition so I substituted coconut flour for the regular, and they were still perfect.  I will definitely make these again.  (A little chocolate ganache on top makes them even better.)

Definitely light and fluffy.  I used almond extract which added a nice flavor to them.   2 minutes prior to finished baking, I added 3  pastel colored M & M's
(Peanut)  to the tops to make an " Easter Egg Nest".    Very pretty!

I doubled the recipe because it didn't make very many.  I mixed up the first batch and then made a second when I saw how little batter there was.  Tasted good, but they seemed a bit dry.  If I make again I would dip in chocolate.

What I enjoyed most was how easy this recipe is to make.   I mixed in some shredded Hersheys semisweet chocolate and used half the sugar,  tasted great.

My daughters and I tried this wonderful recipe! However we substituted the milk and egg whites for snack packs vanilla pudding, It was delicious! We modified it just a tiny bit and it was a hit! Thank you for a sweet treat out of this world.
