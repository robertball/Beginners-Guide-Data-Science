This recipe provided a great base, but I have to agree with other reviewers that it needs a little kick to it to make it really good.  I added some garlic flavored tofu from the first step and put about a cup of fresh mushrooms in with the shredded zucchini.  I also doubled the garlic and will next time add some onion to give it a bit more flavor.  The finished product smelled great and had good consistency, but I think the extra flavor is definitely a must.

This is zucchini week at our house since we've been given 10 of them!  This was really different and so yummy.  Everyone loved it, even the 3 year old!  I added 1/2 an onion when I sauteed the garlic, b/c it needed to be used and we love onion.  Also used about 6 cloves of garlic b/c we are big fans.  I ended up needing to cook my zucchini at least 15 minutes to get the liquid out.  Also added slightly more milk to get the sauce the consistency I wanted.  Fresh basil is a MUST and made it awesome!!!  Wish I could give this more than 5 stars!

Yet another Oh MY!!  Added slivered carrots, chopped broccoli, artichoke hearts & chopped onion; finished with Asiago cheese & white wine in the sauce.  Used some cajun spice and lots of cracked pepper.  Was great last night, but today, it stepped into the next world.  Thank YOU!

This is only a 5 if you add a lot of salt.  I like garlic, so I used 4 cloves, and I sauteed a small onion while I was at it.  I nuked the 4 cups of zucchini for 4 minutes on power level 8.  Then I threw it in a strainer and the liquid came right out. Then I cooked it a while longer with the garlic and onion.  The fresh basil really tops this dish off.  Thank you Terry!

I loved the creamy and slightly sweet flavor of this recipe.  I didn't cook all 12 oz of the noodles as directed and there weren't enough noodles for all the sauce that was made.  I also used soy milk and light cream cheese and it tasted great that way, but I'm sure that if you made it with whole milk and regular cream cheese it would be even better!  I found that about 3 & 1/2 medium sized zucchini made up the 4 cups of shredded zucchini.

I liked this recipe, but didn't serve it over noodles.  My husband and I added the parmesan in our bowls, as well as some cajun seasoning, and ate it as a side vegetable.  I can imagine putting it in a shallow casserole, topping with parmesan and perhaps some buttered crumbs and baking it -- creamed zucchini!

I've never thought of addind zucchini to cream cheese alfredo sauce. What a great zucchini recipe. I added green onion, small meatballs of sausage,use butter instead of oil, more milk, and much more parmesan and served over spaghetti noodles. I didn't worry about cooking the water out of the zucchini as the sauce is quite thick anyway. I use about a cup of milk and one small zucchini grated. Thanks for the great idea.

This is a great idea and was good. I only gave it 3 stars because it does need changes. First of all, Parmesan cheese is not "optional" in Alfredo sauce. Based on other reviews I doubled the garlic and added onion and seasoned with Cajun spice mix. I also mixed about 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese into the sauce but it was still not salty enough for my taste, which is what I expect from Alfredo. I think the problem is actually the cream cheese. While it makes the sauce very rich and creamy, it's too sweet and just overwhelms the garlic and Parmesan. Next time I make this, I will use either ready made Alfredo or use cream and Parmesan cheese to make the sauce. I will also saute the veggies in butter instead of oil since real Alfredo is really just butter and Parmesan cheese. The zucchini gave this great texture and mixed really well with the sauce and pasta. It's just that the sauce isn't a good Alfredo (unless you just like the creaminess of Alfredo vs. the salty/cheesiness).

This was surprisingly good.  A great way to use up zucchini when you have loads in summer.  It is great as is for vegetarians or it would be nice with some crispy fried bacon through it or some shredded chicken through the sauce.  It was really pretty good & easy to make!

Double the garlic, use lots of freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano (yes, it matters), and always use fresh basil. The flavor of the dish is best when you cook the zucchini until it starts to brown. This takes a while but it's worth it. My kids absolutely love this dish and they're not fond of zucchini.

I thought this was DELICIOUS! My kids even said they liked it and I can barely get them to eat! The only changes I made was 4 cloves of garlic, 1/4 c whipping cream and added some onion!

Great recipe. I made it without the pasta and cut the sauce ingredients down by 25%, but amazing either way! Feel free to add other veggies like onion, mushroom, and artichoke.

This was so good! I used olive oil and added cubed chicken tenders and some onion. Doubled the sauce. I shredded 2 cups zucchini and diced the other 2 cups and then added sliced mushrooms. Easy and delicious!

Love this! Great for all that garden zucchini. I was sick and tired of zucchini bread. This is a great dish with baked chicken. Try it with reduced fat cream cheese.

WONDERFUL! I actually used classico alfredo sauce since I had it on hand. I also added more garlic and onions and mushrooms. I would have NEVER thought of doing this. I'm not vegetarian but a great meal for that too. :-) Thanks!!

It was just OK.  After trying numerous recipes on here and pretty much always being impressed, this one was a disappointment.  Edible and good but not the spectacular I was looking for even though I added lots of salt, garlic and crushed red pepper.  Oh well.

I loved this recipe I did change a few things, instead of regular milk I used a can of evaporated milk that helped to make it a little thicker and creamier.  I also added just a hint of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick.  I also used fettuccine noodles and it was amazing!

We didn't like this at all. I'm usually very forgiving with my ratings on AR but this was just bad for us. We added a LOT of salt, pepper, & garlic powder at the table to try to compensate for the lack of flavor but it didn't really help.

I only do not give it five stars because I made some modifications. I use double the cream cheese, add 3-4 cloves of garlic, and add much more zucchini than the recipe calls for. This is a very good and EASY alfredo sauce. My husband even likes it and he has a thing against "white sauces".

This is good. Definitely needs some onion and a bit more garlic, but to make it a bit more filling, shredded chicken is yummy, too. (I just boil a large chicken breast before cooking everything else and you can use the chicken water to boil your noodles!) I topped it with freshly shredded Parmesan cheese. Additionally, 12 oz of noodles is TOO MUCH! 8 oz is probably sufficient. Luckily, we are big fans of buttered noodles and cheese, so my extra noodles won't go to waste!

WOW WEE!  This was AMAZING!  Even the kids liked it.  I added some shredded chicken, extra garlic and scallion onions while the zucchini was cooking down.  My only regret was that I didn't double the sauce.  Surprisingly delicious!

This is a good way to use extra zucchini--simple, filling, decent taste. However, I don't ever think I'll say, "I can't wait until we get more zucchini so we can make this!" We used frozen, shredded zucchini from last summer's garden. And just FYI, we're not at all big salt users, but this recipe definitely needed a lot of salt--we probably used about 2 tsp "to taste"!

This was SO good! Another recipe I tried last summer when there was too much squash to know what to do with! The only thing I did different was the noodles...I used whole wheat penne instead of egg noodles because that's what I had :) Very rich and creamy...YUMMY!!

I made this recipe tonight and my family loved it, even my picky kids. I did not had fresh basil, but it still tasted so good. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Thought it was pretty good.  I used ~1/4 cup dried basil since I didn't have fresh.  I HIGHLY suggest adding a squirt or two of lemon juice.  It really helps the overall taste.  Also I add a chopped dried cayenne pepper for a little kick.  I agree with most of the other posts.  You need to double the garlic.  I also added 1/4 chopped onion as well.  And once again, remember to add some lemon!

This was pretty good, a little dry and a little bland. I like the idea of using zucchini in a sauce for noodles, will have to try adding a little seasoning next time though. I did add a little more milk to get it to be a little less dry.

Great! My first time making this...I added extra garlic and extra basil, and a lot of salt. SUPER YUMMY! It didn't make enough sauce for a whole 12oz bag of noodles, so next time I'll make more :)

I was suprised by how good this really was.  Another great way to use up zucchini!  I followed the recipe I sauteed garlic & onion and also added just a bit of red pepper flakes for some kick.

I've had this huge zucchini from our garden just waiting to be used.  I tried this last night and it was SO good.  I added a little extra garlic, about 1/4 C. parmesan and a few red pepper flakes.  I will definitely make this again!

It was fairly good, but a little bland, as others suggested.. I will definitely add onions, and maybe mushrooms. You could add chicken and bacon for a nonvegetarian version. I used 1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

This was a great recipe. I added onions, carrots, and green beans and did not use the pasta. I also added fresh parsley, green onions and basil toward the end. I added cayanne pepper flakes. I thought the sauce would be too thin but after I added the parmesan it was perfect.

very simple and yummy base recipe but i do agree with a few others that something is lacking. i followed the recipe and added Italian seasoning,  about a half cup of shredded mozzarella and some fresh ground black pepper. also, even though i only made 3/4 of the bag of pasta i still needed to add about a quarter more cream cheese and a quarter more milk.

Most alfredo comes much as expected: unsurprising, but rarely rejected. But this one? Ho, ho! The zucchini is sooo close to flawless it's nearly perfected.

This has become a goto recipe for anytime I need a quick comfort food meal.  I have added cooked chicken sometimes and sauteed mushrooms or even beef.  Once I had quite a bit left over so I used it to make a Pasta Bake.  I added a little milk to moisten it, spread it in a pan and topped it with some crushed cornflakes and parmesian cheese. Baked it until cornflakes brown and pasta bubbles.

This was tasty but I think with the use of cream cheese and different cheeses (such as butter kase, parmesan/asiago cheese, or truffle cheese), I could bump it up to 5 stars. Will try again with cream cheese and a different kind of cheese topped with parmesan next time. Also, I used 2 zucchinis.

I was suprised by how good this was! The changes I made were doubling the garlic (because I love it so!), added red pepper flakes to give it a kick, used reduced fat cream cheese in an attempt to keep my girlish figure and I used dried basil and it was still fantastic!!  Next time I will use fresh basil and try it over rice.  Yummy!

Very easy to make, and a light tasting dish.  I used two large zucchini, shredded, and it was plenty.  The taste was a bit bland. even with a lot of salt and pepper--but I only had dried basil on hand, and fresh probably makes a big difference for flavor.  I'll probably only make this as a light summer dish.

Our house has mixed reviews about this. One member REALLY loved it and the rest thought it was OK.  I found that it didn't turn out with a saucy consistency but was more sticky.  I also added extra milk.  Probably won't make again.

Great recipe base.  I modify this recipe by making a lower fat version, using less oil, whole wheat noodles and low fat dairy products.  With the mods, this recipe is a keeper.

LOVED this! I doubled the sauce and used extra garlic, crushed pepper flakes, chopped onion and some sliced mushrooms that needed used up. Also, I used EVOO in place of the vegetable oil. I added some parmesan to the sauce to give it extra flavor too. I served this with Cellentani pasta instead of egg noodles to make it more of a heartier main dish. We really, REALLY enjoyed this and I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was delicious but I didn't make it exactly as the recipe stated.  I used penne instead of egg noodles.  I pureed half the zucchini to create more of a sauce and shredded the rest.  I also used half cream cheese and half mascarpone because that's what I had on hand. I added a little lemon pepper, as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will definitely make this again.

I really enjoyed the flavor of this and it was so easy!  I think it needs a fair amount of parmesan and the fresh basil is a must.  You can easily add other veggies, chicken, bacon etc.

I think this is a great idea but it came out totally bland for me even with added onion and garlic and fresh basil. I would have liked at least a cheese taste (used lo fat cream cheese)...maybe 6 oz cheese would do it. Adding salt would be a good idea. To use up the leftovers I'm going to fry a slice of bacon or two and add it crumbled to get some flavour in there!

I used more garlic and since I didnt have fresh basil, I used pesto and the flavor was excellent. I think if you added fresh Roma tomatoes and (for non-vegetarians), some chicken, it would be a complete meal. I also used less noodles or it would have made it too bland.

I added some mushrooms and green onions we had to use up, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  I used skim milk and fat free cream cheese, and I still thought the sauce was creamy.  Even my husband loved it, and he's not a big fan of vegetarian dishes!

I did take the other reader's advice and added onion and doubled the garlic.  Still was extremely bland.  Also, I would sub out milk for half and half or cream and double.  Would be slightly improved with some shrimp.  This was really just not good, and was nothing like a true alfredo.

I had a boatload of zucchini and found this recipe.  This was really good, I did add a little more garlic and the onions that another reviewer suggested.  This was good with the fresh tomatoes from my garden.

I had a giant zucchini a friend gave me that I've been debating what to do with for about a week. Came across this recipe & made it for dinner last night, but used several additions. I had 4 cheese Italian sausage I removed from the casings & browned then removed from the pan. Used the drippings with a drop extra EVOO and added a chopped onion and can of sliced mushrooms to the garlic and zucchini mixture.  Once the water simmered away I returned the sausage to the pan, used 8 oz of cream cheese 1 1/2 cups of milk & a good bit of white wine with a ton of salt & pepper as well as the fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.  Served over pasta everyone loved it!

Even with alterations with additional garlic and onions, this really lacks flavor. It's a great base, but needs a good amount of Parmesan or Romano cheese to create a full flavor. Not bad tasting, but not tasty

It was pretty good - something different. I used whole wheat penne pasta instead of egg noodles and I used canola instead of vegetable oil. I used skim milk and fat free cream cheese. Just making it a smidge healthier. :)  I may add a bit more garlic next time as well as a few more seasonings.

Excellent recipe. Simple, quick and delicious. The sauce was so creamy and had just the most wonderful flavor. I only adjusted by using a garlic herb cream cheese rather than plain. Just delicious.

Delicious! With just a few shakes of crushed tabasco pepper, this had all the flavor we wanted. This was a great way to use up zucchini from our garden and a very fast, easy meal to prepare. We ate leftover brats on the side, and the two went surprisingly well together.

GREAT! So tastey! Definately needs a good amount of salt and pepper. Didn't make enough sauce for my noodles, so I did more cream cheese and milk. Very easy and tastey, I will be making this again very soon! :)

Great taste but I used spaghetti noodles since it is what I had on hand.  I would not suggest this to anyone else.  The shredded zucchini and pasta was the same size and shape and made the texture a little strange.

AMAZING!!!  I changed it just a bit and will make over and over!!  GREAT way to use zucchini!  I cooked onions in with the zucchini and added about a 1/2 c. of parm right to the sauce.  I also added shrimp to the sauce.  My family LOVED!!

I really liked the sauce to this. I did omit the basil because I am not fond of basil. I will use this sauce as my Alfredo from now on. Yum! I made breaded chicken breast strips and placed them on top for some meat. Thanks for sharing.

WOW!!!!! This is the best recipe that I've made on this site. I used linguine instead of the egg noodles, and like other users, I chopped up about 1/2 of an onion and put a little garlic powder in with the 2 cloves of garlic. I also added some boiled chicken. I wasn't sure if the cream cheese would give it too much of a cream cheesy flavor, and it doesn't. It's the perfect amount. I mixed in shredded parmesan cheese, and It's a must to use fresh basil. DELICIOUS!!

Even my boyfriend, who would eat only hamburgers if he had his way, loved this meat-free dish. Since my food processor is on the fritz, I peeled zucchini and summer squash for this dish - the slivers were perfect. I also threw in about half a package of sliced shittake mushrooms at the same time and they gave the dish some girth. I sliced up a entire bunch of basil to put in and it really came out great!

This is fabulous! Much easier to make than it sounds.  I also added some canned chicken for protien.  A new favorite way to use up all that zucchini we grow every summer.  Hint:  if you don't have fresh basil, dry works fine, but cut down the amount to about 1/8 cup.

This was great. Don't skimp on the garlic, and make sure you let it saute long enough in the oil. Also, I agree with one reviewer - adding an herb or spice is critical for flavor, but it doesn't have to be fresh basil. I used a healthy dose (several tbsp) of dried bouquet garni and it was terrific (but fresh basil would probably have been better). I also agree with another reviewer who said crumbled bacon would be a fantastic addition. I'll definitely make this again.

This was unexpectedly tasty for a zucchini dish. I added a sauteed onion, and substituted half of the cream cheese with parmesan. The final product has a thick consistency that went very well with the noodles. I will certainly make this again.

this recipe was a good way to use the zucchini. it was nice and creamy, but felt it didnt have much flavor. i added diced tomatoes, and lots and lots of grated parmesan, and that helped, butnot quite enough flavor still. i would try this recipe again, but need to find a way to spice it up more.

I like zucchini so this was a good dish. I used reduced calorie cream cheese and ff milk and it was still really rich.  The rest of the family wasn't that excited about it.

This was very enjoyable despite having to use dried basil instead of fresh. Next time I will use a stronger flavoured cheese, or maybe mix parmesan into it instead of sprinkling it over, and top with toasted breadcrumbs for a textural contrast.

It was also nice cold the next day. Would go well with a nutty wholemeal or granary bread (and salted butter if you're not watching your weight or cholesterol, but it's creamy enough that it doesn't need it).

Ironically, I have been putting off making this recipe because I am the only zucchini lover in my house and thought that my husband and children would not care that much for this dinner.  I had one last zucchini to use up and made this tonight.  I tried a little and did not like it at all.  When I served the kids, I put only a tiny amount of sauce on their noodles and they all went back and added more.  My husband said this is in his all time top 5 favorite dinners.  Who would have thought?!

This was very easy and a light summer meal.  I used 2% milk and 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was perfect atop whole wheat noodles.

Great concept but I found this recipe lacking a lot of flavour despite adding in onion and salt (which I barely ever add to food).  I feel like this is half of a recipe - the zucchini is a good base but other ingredients need to be added to give it some flavour.  Ended up being a big lump of cheese/zucchini that I plopped on top of the egg noodles.  Not bad at all, just lacking in flavour.  Thanks for sharing though! :)

Had a very good flavor.  I only used half the amount of zucchini because it was just my husband and I, but I didn't half the cream cheese or the milk. If I was to use the whole amount of zucchini I would double the recipes recommendation.  Very quick and easy--especially if you have a food processor with a shredding disc :o).

I made the mistake of tossing the sauce with all the pasta to simplify serving, and found that, contrary to what one other reviewer said, for me 12 oz was too many noodles for the amount of sauce made. The flavor was lost in a sea of noodles, but I tasted the sauce while it was still in the pan on the stove, and it was DELICIOUS (fresh basil definitely mandatory over dried). So next time, I think I might actually double the sauce, and if it turns out to be too much, maybe I'll throw in some broccoli to help spread it out.

This was a delicious dish!  I did add extra garlic - 4 cloves instead of 2 - and about one-half of a medium onion.  The fresh basil gave it such a great flavor.  I salted the zucchini as it cooked to draw out some of the liquid, and salted again before serving.  What a creative use for all the zucchini we have right now!

Awesome! My only changes were doubling the milk and cream cheese.  I also grated 1/2 an onion and added to the grated zucchini.  I am always looking for recipes to use up my zucchini and this one is a keeper. Thanks.

This was a pretty good recipe, I liked trying a new twist on alfredo! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and also used more garlic than called for (I scaled it down to one serving).  I also added a pinch of mozzarella cheese and I used additional pepper on the top.  Very good and basic alfredo, I loved that I added an entire zucchini and couldn't even really taste it (even though I like zucchini).  I also added more milk once scaled down until the sauce was the consistency I wanted.  Very good recipe.

This was a good way to get rid of squash, but the recipe lacked a lot. I ended up doubling the milk, cream cheese, and garlic. I also added mushrooms and onions for flavor. It also required a lot of salt to make it taste like anything.   I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be repeating this recipe.

This was an okay pasta dish. We liked the veggies, but the taste didn't wow us. I used 6 cloves of garlic, 4 oz. sliced mushrooms and a whole onion. I have to confess that I did use dried basil, but I don't think the fresh basil would have made up for the lack of the "wow factor".

Good recipe, easy, will definitely make again.  Be sure to cook the zucchini until tender.  Ours was a little undercooked which detracted from the recipe I think.  Overall a good recipe, good way to sneak in zucchini without the kids realizing it.

This is a great recipe that you can adjust to your own tastes.  I also added more garlic (4-5 cloves) and 1 onion (which I caramelized).  Sometimes I add a pinch of red pepper flakes.  This is also great with parsley instead of basil, and I think dried parsley is fine if you don't have fresh.  Also, if you let the zucchini sit on some paper towels for a few minutes before adding them, it removes some of the extra moisture.  Thanks!

Very rich and tastey! I used half as much milk and a few ounces more cream cheese to make it thicker, added more garlic, and more salt and pepper to taste. Could be easily made low fat by using fat free cream cheese, skim or 1% milks, and low carb pasta! Perfect!

This was wonderful. Didn't read the part that said shredded zucchini, oooops. I added a yellow squash and some broccoli. Served with angel hair pasta becuase that was the pasta I had on hand. Secretly I used cream for the alfredo because I had half a container left that needed to be used, but next time I try this I will follow the recipe exactly. Thanks for a great way to use zucchini!

Fantastic - BASIL is a MUST.   I didn't have enough cream cheese so I used Laughing Cow light instead and it worked perfect!  I also added a little cayenne pepper for some heat.

Yodders, was this good.  I cut down on the cream cheese to allow it to be a little smoother.  My son who eats no meat was in love with this receipe.  Household favorite.

Great tasting recipe. The only thing I did differently is make my own alfredo sauce without the use of cream cheese. I am sure with the cream cheese it is good too and perhaps cheesier and heavier.

Excellent! A new favorite. I did add a little extra milk to make more sauce, and will season it up as others suggest next time with more garlic, mushrooms, salt etc as on its own is a little bland. The basil is just delicious in it! I love this recipe!

I LOVE this sauce!  I don't usually make the recipe to a "T".  Just use it for the sauce part.  I like to add steamed broccoli and shredded rotisserie turkey breast.  Very quick and delicious meal!

Great idea! The sauce is not my very favorite, but I really loved the shredded zucchini in it (I also added sauteed crimini mushrooms). I would likely try this concept again with a classic cream alfredo rather than the cream cheese & milk, but I also enjoyed this recipe very much with a little tweaking. Thanks!

What a great versatile recipe... I had half a container of cracked pepper cream cheese and added this instead of the block cream cheese... really made the sauce nice and zippy. Definately make this again - so quick too.

Delicious!  I read other posts though and added mushrooms to the sauteeing zucchini and doubled the garlic.  I also used a minced dried onion blend and needed no salt or pepper.  Very tasty!

This is great. We've tried it twice and prefer a more course shred to the zucchini and used angel hair pasta instead of egg noodles.

Very good!  The first time I made it exactly as written and my family really liked it... the second time I took the advice of previous reviewers and tried to ramp up the flavor a bit.  I added extra garlic (we love garlic) and I saute'd 1/2 of a sweet onion with it... my family LOVED it...Next time I think I'll add some mushrooms too!  This is definately a keeper!

Maybe it was my zucchini but I followed this recipe exactly and found the flavor very bland, the texture somewhat slimey and the eye appeal, well I just won't go there,  I must say the recipe looked appealing on paper and I am always grateful to the wonderful members here that give such creative ideas.  This one missed the mark for me but some like vanilla and some like chocolate!

This was so good! My family loved it! I used olive oil and added cubed chicken tenders and some onion. I also doubled the sauce. I shredded 2 cups of the zucchini and diced the other 2 cups for a little more texture. Next time I will add mushrooms and maybe some spinach. This was really yummy, I only wish I had tripled the recipe for leftovers! I let a friend taste it at work and now she wants the recipe!Thanks for sharing!

This was very good and very easy. I used 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and I added 1 cup chopped onion and twice the garlic. I added the parmesean with the basil instead of serving it on top. Great weekday dinner!

I loved this recipe. What a great way to use that extra zucchini from the garden! The only thing I did different was, I added a 12.5 oz can of chunk chicken breast for some protein. YUM!

This recipe is SOOO good. The only changes I made was to cut the zucchini into julienne strips and put them into a colandar with a little salt so they could weep away the extra liquid.  I have also added shrimp to the pot.  It freezes well too! Great recipe. Thank you!!

Very bland. The only thing I did differently was use 4 cloves of garlic, since I like garlic. However, zucchini and cream cheese don't have much going on at all, and the basil isn't enough to add the depth this dish needs. Alfredo sauces rely on a lot of parmesan cheese to round out the flavor, and I suspect adding at least 1/4 c. of parmesan may help this sauce. The lemon pepper seasoning another reviewer mentioned may do the trick too. However, I don't think I'll bother with this again as I don't feel like fussing with the recipe to try to make it taste good.

This turned out really yummy! Though, I must admit, I used half and half instead of milk. (I know, so bad!) Tasted great. I just chopped my zucchini instead of shreding it, cuz I wanted some nice texture. Thanx for this recipe!

A pretty good pasta sauce when you're looking for a change. Perhaps a little bit bland, I liked it much more than my husband, but we'll just discount his opinion because he's picky and doesn't care for zucchini.

Delish!  My zucchini was getting a little soft, so I rinsed it well after shredding to get any mush out (sorry that's gross) but it turned out wonderful!  I though my sauce looked a little thick and globby, so next time I will thin it with a little more milk, or use less zucchini.  I used 4 "packed" cups.    My three year old son even gobbled it up!  Thanks Terry!

I enjoyed the taste of this. I think one of my zucchinis was going bad, however as it had a slight bitter taste to it. I do think it needed a little more zip so when I added the salt and pepper, I used a spicy salt that had some cayenne ands other spices in it. I also think next time I won't saute the garlic as I know sometimes that can burn and also give a bitter taste. I added a diced fresh tomato to this as well when I was serving it. great way to use an over abundance of veggies.

I made another batch of this and it wasn't bitter.. just yummy.

Added half a cup of parmesan to the sauce, plus I sauteed half a diced onion and added a little extra garlic. Also I used butter instead of oil. Good modifications, thank you to the submitter and reviewers!

I tried everything with this recipe except fresh basil. I used dried basil n it tasted fine but it'd probably taste better with fresh basil. But I also didnt use 1/2 cup of the basil. I just dosed it with some heavy shakes. Also I added another two ounces of cream cheese. We're fans of thick creamy sauce. Also we added more of the garlic, salt and pepper, a quick dash of Italian seasoning and a few shots of hot sauce to give it a kick. It was too sweet before the hot sauce.  And like other said, the parmesan cheese is a must! Last but not leastx the pasta was too much for the amount of sauce. I'd recommend doubling the sauce ingredients or cutting the pasta amount in half. Other than that, it was great!

Even with adding onion, artichokes and spinach, and using flavored cream cheese, we didn't think this recipe had much flavor.

Very yummy! Like many people I sauteed some onion but I used purple onion for the sweetness. I didn't have the produce on hand but I can see adding a variety of veggies to this dish. To my plate I added a few cherry tomatoes. It livened up the colors.

I liked this a lot but found that there was not NEARLY enough sauce for the amount of noodles indicated. I'd probably keep the noodles the same and double the sauce next time. Also, it was super-thick and I had to add a lot more milk to thin it out before serving.

This was very good, lots of options available. Chickened out and used commercial Alfredo. Added some onion and artichokes. Came out great

This is a great recipe! I agree with other reviewers about adding more garlic/spices.  I added 7 cloves garlic half a minced onion, and some homemade hot chili paste.  I used 6 oz of whole wheat rotini and 6 cups shredded zucchini/yellow squash.  This made 5 hearty servings and allowed me to use up all the summer squash in my fridge.  I also used "neufchâtel" (reduced fat) cream cheese and 1% milk and the dish still seemed sinfully rich and satisfying.  I did cook the zucchini on high heat until some of it browned, which was tasty, and I scooped out the seedy, watery middles of a couple of largest squash so I wouldn't have to contend with the extra moisture.  I actually think I could make this with even more zucchini next time without raising the fat/cheese content, which makes this recipe a real winner!

Added about 1/2 a finely diced onion as other posters suggested, doubled the garlic, added about 3/4 pkg sliced baby portobellos, and GASP, had to use whipping cream because I was out of milk :), and about 1 tsp or so salt. Didn't add the basil cause I didn't have any and IMO, this didn't need any other seasoning. Served it over fettuccine noodles. Delish! Thanks, Terry.

This was good, but was kind of bland.  I would add parmesan or similar cheese to it and try to doctor it up with some good seasoning and more garlic.

I thought it was a little bland.  I added some extra garlic and some green onions and it still didn't do much.  The whole 12oz bag of noodles was a little too many noodles for us so I only added around 10oz and that was still a little too many noodles(a little dry)  I have alot of leftovers so I am going to add a couple cans of tuna and a can of cream of mushroom soup to make a tuna noodle casserole =)

This is unlike anything I have ever tried before. I was tempted to change things up after reading the reviews but I wanted to try it as is the first time. I followed the direction exactly and I added the optional parmesan cheese on top. After tasting the finished product, I had to agree that it was a little bland for my taste. I sprinkled in a little bit of onion powder and a tiny bit of granulated garlic. I used about 1/4 tsp. of each. It was really good. I served this as a side dish and served it over the egg noodles as stated.  The fresh basil adds a delicious touch. If you don't have fresh basil, I don't think dried would have enough of a punch in this dish. Thanks for sharing this unique dish.

I really enjoyed this.  Made only small changes as recommended by others. Used 5 cloves garlic and onion is needed.  I used at least 6 cups of zucchini, squeezed moisture out with a clean dishtowel and fried as directed until the zucchini was beginning to brown.  I also added some red pepper and about 1/3 cup of romano.  Yummy!

Was skeptical but was pleasantly surprised. Did add an extra clove of garlic, shimp, and only shreded one large zucchini. Took some coaxing for my 3 year old to try (didn't like the green speckled throughtout) but once she tried she was fine with it. I would call that a victory!

I love this recipe, the only things I did different was; after shredding 7"-9" zucchinis placed zucchini in a clean cotton hand towel and squeezed most of the moisture out. When I was in a hurry, I skipped from the milk down and used Jar Alfredo sauce. Awesome recipe, what a hit at my table.

A good base recipe. The original recipe was rather bland. Next time I will cook the Zucchini longer to get rid of more of the liquid. To make it less bland I added more garlic and two large spoon-fulls of pesto I had-a ready made pesto from the store. Added lots of Parmesan  to the sauce.

A perfect way to use that zucchini in the garden. We are actually wishing it would grow faster! 5 stars with the following reviewer's changes. 4 cloves garlic rather than 2. Chopped onion and sliced mushrooms added to garlic when cooking. I made the sauce as written and added left over jarred Alfredo sauce to increase the amount of sauce. My grown boys who have an aversion to change loved this and had no idea there was zucchini in it.

Definitely 5 starts with a few extras thrown in.  Per other reviewers I added some sliced mushrooms, chopped onion, shredded carrot and doubled up on the garlic.  With extra veggies you might increase the sauce to 3/4 cup milk and 6 oz cream cheese.  I'm not a big basil fan but, I agree that the basil really makes it special.  This was awesome. . .my 4-year-old said it was better than McDonald's chicken nuggets (her all-time fave) - WOW!!

I made this according to direction, but just couldnt say I was a fan of the sauce, it really lacked something, hence my 3 star. So I started slowly adding to it, and ended up with something I thought was really good, hubby just thought "ok". I would give a 4 star after my changes. I ended up doubling the garlic, added quite a lot of seasoned salt and pepper, added probably about 3/4 to 1 cup of white wine, and about 1/2 cup of shredded mozzerella cheese. I would  make again, more so for me, but maybe on smaller scale since its just hubby and I and he's not "real into it".

This is nice - good for using up that zucchini, and an easy way to make alfredo.  I added an onion and served it on whole wheat pasta, kids and hubby all liked it.  Good for a weeknight meal.

Great!  This was a delicious way to use up some of our zucchini bounty.  A great meatless meal (which I'm trying to do more of) that had a great serving of veggies right in the sauce.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and it still turned out fantastic.  I'll definitely make again, but probably double the garlic next time.  It was delish as is, but we love garlic!  Thanks for this great recipe.

A great alternative to high fat and butter laden alfredo. I also added green peppers and onions and left them all (including the zucchini) in chunks. I also doubled the garlic.

This was a great recipe - even my kids loved it and they're not big zucchini fans.  It even held up well using 1/3 less fat cream cheese and just 2% milk to be a little lighter.

Deeelicious!! I added a little extra milk, and an oz. extra of cream cheese to make it a little thinner. I also used about 5 cloves of garlic and some chopped onion. I added (chopped up) two pre-baked chicken breasts!.. made it even yummier!! I also opted to use whole wheat rotini. My picky husband and 3 year old loved this dish! Thanks :)

I love this recipe!   As a twist, I added some cooked ham pieces just before I was about to put in the milk and the cream cheese.  It purked up the flavour of the recipe.  Will definitely try this again!

I'm sorry but this was just okay, even after following some suggestion and adding onion, salt, chicken and 8 oz.  cream cheese. I only used 3 cups of zucchini and this was plenty.  I also added extra milk and it was still pretty thick!  I won't be making this again =(

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and 3 year old loved it!  I cut the zucchini into chunks instead of shredding it because I like chunks in my pasta sauces. I also added more garlic.  You need to add quite a bit of salt to bring up the taste.  My husband and I love that it's such a basic recipe and you can change it however you want.  I may add some chopped tomatoes next time.

I love this recipe!  Of course, I made a few modifications after reading others' reviews.  I added twice the garlic, substituted 3 oz. of cream cheese for low fat ricotta, deleted the basil (not a fan) and added sun dried tomatoes.  YUMMY!  I would HIGHLY recommend grating the zucchini and then squeezing the moisture out before cooking.  It made it so much easier!  Enjoy.  I know I will again and again!

Made this as written except I used about 5 cloves of garlic.  Also added a lot of salt and after final tasting...added more.  This needs a lot of salt.  I had to add extra milk at the end to get it to become more saucy. As written it is very thick and would be good as a stuffing for chicken breasts.

I thought this was just okay. I added mushrooms and doubled the garlic. The zucchini was barely noticeable.  It tasted like a cross between a regular alfredo dish and a pesto pasta.  Also, I think 8 oz. of noodles would be plenty.

This is one of those recipes that didn't even make it to the table in my house. After reading the other reviews I added some zip to mine with double the garlic (yum!) and seasoned black pepper. It made for that just right adjustment. I couldn't stop eating it. We recently ate at an amazing Greek resturaunt and this reminds me of the flavors that I find in mediterranian dishes. Way to go!

This was very tasty and simple and a great way to use up a lot of zucchini.
I followed another's advice and mixed all of the seasonings in with the zucchini to "mingle" for awhile and then I sauteed it all together. I did not think it was lacking in flavor at all and I used the amount of spices the recipe called for, so try adding the basil and garlic to the zucchini and let it sit for more flavor.

This recipe is a good base, though not five stars as is. It's much better than many others that I've found to be good starts, but it needs a bit more flavor. I did add a few more cloves of minced garlic and some minced onion, but ultimately what made the dish four stars instead of three was the parmesan cheese - without it, it wouldn't have been nearly as good, as it would have been almost too bland even with the extra garlic and onion. After adding the parmesan though, this dish was enjoyed by all, including my four year old.

I added 6 cloves of garlic and 1 big onion and sauteed , and an onion chive flavoured cream cheese rather than plain. I also added more parmesan cheese. It was very tasty due to the loads of garlic and cheese. Still at the same time wasnt a very heavy dish, I used 1/2 cup 2% milk and 1 big table spoon onion chive cream cheese and about 1/2 cup parmesan. Will make it again but will add red peppers and mushrooms next time  :)

This was GREAT!  Made a lot of  changes - mostly because of dietary restrictions - used Silk soymilk (double) and Tofutti cream cheese - added around 3 TBSP Nutritional yeast and 2 TBSP VEGAN Parmesan, 1/2 onion, used 2 TBSP minced garlic - would add a little more next time.  Only had 1/4 c of fresh basil so I used fresh parsely to make up the bulk, also only had 3 3/4 c zucchini so I added 1/4 c diced mushrooms.  I would add more mushrooms next time.  Great concept - easy to make!  This one is a keeper - the whole family loved it.

I was so excited to make this meal when I read the reviews for this recipe... however I was very sad with the results of this dish... first the cream cheese milk combo makes way too thick of a mixture to be an alfredo sauce, second the recipe is way too BLAND.  I even added a few extra spices to the final dish and it was still a little bland.  I would normally say this is a good starting dish but considering the sauce and spice tastes are off you would basically have to change the whole recipe.  I will NOT be making this again.
I gave this 2 stars because despite the consistency and taste it was still edible!

I loved this dish.  It is really thick and creamy.  I've made it a few times and found that it helps to add a little extra milk.  I also did not use fresh basil but it was still great.  The Parmesan cheese is a must!

this is basically very good and certainly very simple. If you grate the zucchini, your kids will never know it's there. I also think the cream chees is a little too much. will probably try less of that and more milx next time. Real parmesan a must also-not the canned stuff.

This was really tasty!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and I microwaved the shredded zucchini first for four minutes at power level 8.  I drained in a collander and then put into a hot pan...it only had to saute a few minutes and then it was ready to add the milk and cream cheese.  I used light cream cheese, added some parmesan cheese as well as some flaked imitation crab meat and the whole family really enjoyed it!   Only my 4 year old complained about the zucchini but he gobbled it up anyway!  A great, different use for zucchini!

After reading all reviews, and having too much zuc to figure out what to do, made this.  Great!  I added way more onion and garlic, also 8oz parm. cheese and nutmeg.  Whole family loved.  I made a double batch yesterday and froze it for later this winter.

This is SO easy and SO good! I honestly didn't even expect to like it but bought too many zucchini at the farmers' market. I added 1/2 cup of milk (seemed a little thick for my taste) and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Thanks for the recipe!!

I cheated!  I used a jar of alfredo sauce and added the sauted zucchini and onion.  I also added some habanero peppers and whoa was that a system shocker. It was delish but very spicy.

Thank you so much for this recipe!!!  I'll be making this quite often from now on.  I had used dried basil this time and I thought it came out great.  I'm excited to try fresh basil next time; also, I'm going to try adding a bit of tofu to make the meal more filling.  Thanks again!

This is so fast, easy and delicious! Not to forget healthy. My meat-eater boyfriend loved it and wants to have it again and I pretty much could eat it for a week straight. I added an onion to the sauce and more milk. Next time I may double the garlic to be able to really taste it. I served it on red tomato linguine and it looked very pretty. I also see how this could be nice with the addition of chicken or ham, but it doesn't really need to be messed with. Fantastic and light, as is.

This was so yummy! My boys loved it and never even knew it had zucchini in it (I grated it first :) I did add some extra half & half as it was a bit thick. SOOO good!!! Definitely a "do-over"

This was a good recipe although I did use the fat free half and half instead of milk and I used low fat cream cheese. I will make again...thanks for the recipe.

A good idea, but sooooo bland. I had to add a dangerous amount of salt for it to taste like anything, especially once it was mixed with the noodles.

As written, this recipe is not the best. However, with a few adjustments, it is truly delicious. I substituted egg noodles for linguine (my preference) and asiago cheese for cream cheese to add more potent flavor. I also added half a cup of parmesan cheese, which should not be optional, and double the amount of garlic. You will probably need to add more salt than you expect because this recipe is rather light and creamy. Honestly, I never would have thought to add zucchini to an alfredo sauce, but it was the perfect touch!

This was wonderfully simple to make and could easily be made lower fat/calorie. I will definitely make again. However, I would decrease zucchini to 3 cups and double the milk and cream cheese to make additional sauce

Needs extra garlic, and parmesan cheese in an alfredo sauce is necessary!  I just added a handful after the cream cheese had melted and it turned out great.

This recipe was a hit at our house.  I added chopped onion along with the zucchini and 2 handfuls of shredded parm cheese.  I added about 1/2 cup of the starchy cooking water from the pasta which helped bring the sauce together.  Will make this again and might add additional veggies like mushrooms, carrots or spinach as another reviewer suggested.

This was an A+ in our house! We added mushrooms,  sautéed the veggies with butter and added 1/2 a cup of parm. Otherwise, we followed the recipe to a T, and it turned out just as we were hoping! Very delicious!

This is a very nice recipe.  I made it with gluten free noodles for some of our antique car club members that cannot eat gluten foods.  I also used Classico Alfredo sause and th dish was very tastey.  The wife of her gluten free husband asked for the recipe, so I'm forwarding it on to her.

Delicious and super easy / quick to make. I didn't serve this with egg noodles and instead substituted the pasta with rotini. I also added a bit more garlic to the mix as well (a whole head) and it was perfect.

It was really lovely, like some others I tweaked it a little bit, so put some milk in as well as cream cheese, I also added mushrooms and spring onions - but main bonus was my children won't courgettes (zucchini) and it was so well disguised by shredding it they didn't realise they were there :0)

I didn't stray too far from the original recipe. I didn't have any zucchini on hand, so I used squash instead. Other then that everything else was the same. After cooking it tasted a bit bland, so I added some garlic salt. Like others, next time I would consider adding onion and more garlic to enhance the flavor!

Our family recently went vegetarian for the next 30 days and this is a great recipe!! Yes, there are changes that can be made that make this recipe great.  For instance I added double the amount of garlic, added oregano, a little adobo seasoning, and salt. I choose to squeeze the excess liquid out of the shredded zucchini before sauteing as well.  Cream cheese does make this recipe nice but you MUST have Parmesan cheese,  I added a combo of Parmesan, Romano and Asiago cheese (3/4 cup) to the sauce.  I used the recommended amount of zucchini but also added spinach and fresh minced onion...yum.  My two boys and my husband LOVED this!!!

As per some of the other reviews I took the suggestion to add onion and use both butter and oil as well as add some parmesan to the sauce. I also agree that it takes more milk to make the sauce the right consistency so I just did that by eye. This is absolutely delicious and not as high in fat and calories as it appears if you use light cream cheese and low fat milk. This ones a keeper. I think that serving it over linguini or other pasta would be almost better texture wise than egg noodles but that is my only criticism. AND it was super easy to make!

Very tasty and fast. I used yellow summer squash instead of zucchini. I doubled the garlic and added about 1/2 cup of onion.  I also doubled the milk and cream cheese. I used a dash of cayenne. My three children even liked it (although initially they were worried about the summer squash ruining their Alfredo).  I will probably make several batches to freeze for later use for easy suppers. I would just add the milk and cream cheese before cooking.

Like Olivia, I added 6 cloves of garlic. Then I added a cup of sliced mushroom and a whole onion. In the last stage, I also mixed in between 1/4 and 1/3 of Parmesan cheese. It looked like yucky green mush in the pan, but I let it set up for awhile off the stove and it thickened into something awesome, though not really what I'd call an Alfredo. Husband asked for seconds. We'll definitely have this again when we have a lot of zucchini.

This was delicious. I just chopped the zucchini instead of grating, I used a whole 8 oz brick of cream cheese and also upped the milk to a 1 cup. I also added another clove of garlic and a tbs or so of finely chopped jalapeno.

So once I made a few adjustments this was awesome my family loved it.  I like a few others add onions and a bit more garlic which I sautéed with some mushrooms and 2 slices of bacon.  I also use whole wheat spaghetti instead of egg noodles.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did change a couple of things after reading some of the reviews.  I doubled the garlic and sauteed half an onion with it.  I also used 6oz. of cream cheese.  It made the sauce a little creamer.  Great recipe.  Taste even better the 2nd day.

This was okay... for us, the sauce needed to be more creamy.  I may have overdone the zucchini.  I'll double the cream cheese next time.

Very good but mushrooms are a must!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable and added 8 oz of cream cheese instead of 4 oz.  Also, added 5 cloves of garlic, garlic powder and onion powder.  The leftovers are even better!

I would give it a 5 with all the changes that I made, but without I think it would be bland.  I added 3-4 extra cloves of garlic, fresh mushrooms, a little extra milk and a half cup of onions.  As other reviews said, you need to salt it a lot.  I also didn't use all the noodles that I cooked so it would be a bit more saucy.  Very easy and good!

YUM!....I totally forgot the basil and will remember next time, (doh). I added about 1/2 cup chopped onions browned in olive oil, 1 cup mushrooms, cut the zuchini to 2 cups and added small chunks of chicken breast(about 2cups), cracked pepper. I used 12 oz of fat free cream cheese and a cup of 1% milk served over angel hair only because I didn't have fettucini or egg noodles. A Winner!

This was pretty good with potential to be great.  I used less oil (2 Tbls olive oil), more garlic (4 cloves), lowfat cream cheese and milk.  There wasn't enough sauce as written, so next time I will double the sauce and add about 1/2 c parmesan cheese into the sauce rather than shaking it over my plate.  This dish tastes healthy and the portions are not huge, which is exactly what I wanted.  I will try this again.

This was wonderful! I've not liked any other creamy sauces that call for cream cheese as the main ingredient, but the zucchini and milk off-set the thick cream cheese flavor so well. I followed the directions as given, no need to alter, unless you wanted to kick it up a notch (i.e. grilled chicken breast).

My family went crazy happy with this recipe, will make this one again and again. I bought fresh parm cheese to put on top and it added a nice kick. I agree fresh basil is the only way to go. Thanks for the keeper.

Okay...this turned out really good but as others suggested....did add a little extra.  I used, about 4 cloves of garlic, sauted it with 1/2 small onion diced really small.  Cooked the zucchini in the microwave first for 4 minutes and drained the liquid before adding to the onions and garlic.  Grilled 3 chicken breast, cut those up and added to the saute mixture along with 2 cans of mushrooms and the basil.  Simmered the zucchini and chicken mixture with 2 jars Bertolli Alfredo sauce (I know....I cheated) while the noodles were cooking.  Drained the noodles and combined it with the saute mixture.  Did add some additional grated parmesean (not dry powder) and put in a 9x13 pan.  Topped it with a little mozzarella and parmesan on top and then baked for 30 minutes at 350.  It was yum yum good!

While my husband really enjoyed this dish, I thought it was a little too cream-cheesy tasting to pull off the word "alfredo." I added double the garlic as well as sauteed onions (about 3/4 of an onion) and it still had a strong cream cheese taste. Not a bad recipe for using up some garden zucchini, but I definitely wouldn't run out and buy zucchini especially for this dish.

Great creamy base! I cooked chicken and zucchini in olive oil with garlic and used low fat cream cheese and fat free milk for creamy alfredo. I also added some Parmesean Garlic seasoning and omitted the basil and even the salt and pepper! Tasted great!

Triple garlic and much salt!!, also added 2 cans mushrooms to the zucchini frying.  Also added 2 chicken breasts cooked and cut up and some half n half.  After that, it was good otherwise it would have been boring as is.

I followed this recipe exactly except for I added more fresh basil than called for.  It was so bland and flavorless.  I've noticed those that gave it high ratings altered the recipe.  I'd rather do lots of other things with my fresh zucchini than make this again.

OK , this was a very tasty dish, but I did modify it a bit. I sauteed 1/2 an onion with a 2 chicken breast cut into small cubes, tripled the garlic and strained the juice out of the zucchini before adding to the pan and lastly I added about 1/4 c parm cheese to the pan before serving. All my kids(5,4,3) ate it up without knowing it had zucchini in it!

Wow!  Delicious!  I cheated and used jar Ragu alfredo sauce.  I started off browning one package of Oscar Meyer smoked turkey sausage with a whole diced onion.  Then I added about 8 c shredded zucchini that my mom's neighbor gave her.  I cooked that for a few minutes then added two spoonfuls of jar diced garlic and cooked for a few minutes more.  I added 1 jar of alfredo sauce (which I cleaned out with about 1 c of 2% milk) and let it simmer for a short time before I added 1 (16 oz) box of cooked penne pasta (with lines).  This was so good and it made a lot of food for under $5.  What a great way to sneak in some veggies!  Well, not really "sneak" because you obviously could see them but they didn't taste veggish at all.  Wonderful idea!!

I used mostly yellow squash instead of zucchini and it disappeared so well in the noodles. The kids had seconds! For leftovers, the sauce was a little dry, but a super kid friendly dish to use up garden veg and sneak into their mouths.

Great Recipe!  I was a little leary, but it turned out good!  It needs a bit more flavor, I would re-read the other reviews and see what sounds good to you!  I think just more salt and parmesean cheese would do the trick!

Loved it!  I added about 12 chicken tenders, cut into bite size pieces, upped the garlic to 6 cloves and added 1/2 an onion.  I used 3/8 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper.  Also used all 8 oz. of cream cheese.  My family wants to try it again adding artichoke hearts and rosemary for a different flavor.  Fabulous!

This recipe was great!  I loved using the cream cheese for the sauce, didn't realize you could do that until I made this!  I added a little (too much!) red pepper at the suggestion of one of the reviewers.  That really bumped up the flavor, I just won't use as much next time!  You really couldn't taste the zucchini, but a great way to mix a veggie into dinner!  Thanks!

The egg noodles offer a nice taste change from the usual pasta.  I thought this made a nice, quick light lunch garnished with french fried onions for some crunch.

SOOO good! The only change I made was I used fat-free cream cheese instead of regular and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Delish and healthy!

This was just DELICIOUS!!!!!  Sooo simple, quick and YUMMY!!  I had it with the 'Basic Pasta' I made from this site, and I just know I will make it again and again.  The only thing I added was a pinch of sugar.  I will probably season it slightly more next time, but this dish was AMAAAZING!!  I encourage ALL to make it!  Thanks for sharing! :)

after reading the reviews about lack of flavor I decided to try something I made this as is just put the ingredents in differently. first I chopped the zucchini and put in a bowl added the salt, pepper, dried basil and garlic  and let it sit for about a half an hour at room temp to meld the flavors, this added a whole lot of flavor. I put it all in the pan and sauteed it with olive oil, and followed the rest of the recipe as stated made this way it is five stars, but a four as written

We ate it right after making it and we felt that it needed something. I ate some for lunch the next day and decided that what it needed was to sit for a day! It was so much better the 2nd day! However, even my children who cannot stand summer squash or onions said this recipe was a "keeper". I ended up using yellow summer squash as that's what I had on hand. My husband said that it tasted like a fresh summer garden.

This was a great alfredo sauce, and I loved the grated zucchini in it.  I also added half an onion and a bunch of garlic.

I couldn't make enough last Friday night.  I thought I would take some to the neighbors to test it out...My family ate every last drop!  Next itme I'll double it.  I used fresh basil from my garden and microwaved the shredded zuc. to drain the moisture.  I couldn't tell there was zucchini in it.  You could add a cooked chicken breast on top for protien requirement to make a complete meal. YUM!

My first thought when I saw this recipe was "really?  Zucchini alfredo?"  But after I tried it, I found that this combination is AWESOME.  The cream cheese instead of heavy cream makes for an ultimately creamy sauce.  I will make this all summer with my abundant zucchini from the garden.

not your typical alfredo--i pureed zucchini liquid came out fast and made a nice texture.  i love the soft green color--it looks like it tastes!  YOU MUST USE FRESH BASIL 1/2 cup at a minimum!!! i added all 8oz of cream cheese--it was light and i thought what the heck!

This is an interesting "basic" alfredo recipe. I used fresh basil from my garden. Needed some adjustments: fresh tomatoes, more garlic, cajun spices, salt and fresh ground pepper. Otherwise would have been pretty bland. I gave it four stars because the kiddos loved it and had no clue there was a vegetable in it!

This was an intresting dish.  I thought that it was alright, it just had an unusual taste.  I did use fettichni noddles instead of the egg noodles and I also decided to add about a full cup of milk, instead of the 1/2 cup.  I think the parmasean cheese helped it out alot.

I enjoyed this very much!  Instead of using  herbs I used some cajun spice to zing it up.  I think next time I will add some chopped artichoke hearts.  I used the 'microwave 4 minutes at 80% power and squeeze the water out' technique and it worked pretty well.
Would be good with some cooked shrimp added to it, as someone else suggested, or with cooked shredded chicken as someone else suggested.  I'd even try it with tofu too.

Made a few changes the second time I made this. Added 4 cloves of garlic and instead of cream cheese used a gorganzola cheese spread that I had it gave it a lot more flavor then the cream cheese did the first time I made it will make it this way from now on.

This was really simple and really good!  A great easy weeknight dinner.  I diced the zucchini instead of shredding, added an onion, and used 3 oz cream cheese and a touch more milk based on the reviews.  We liked it a lot and I'm sure I'll make it again this summer when my zucchini is prolific!  I may add additional herbs next time too.  Thanks!

We loved this, including my three year old. I didn't have basil so I left it out. I reduced the amount of oil to 1 tbs to make a little less fattening. I also changed the cream-cheese for shredded "pizza" cheese. Turned out great.

If I could give this 4.5 stars I would.  I omitted the basil since I didn't have any fresh and I couldn't see dried tasting good in this dish.  I subbed soy milk for milk (as I do in almost all recipes).  

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it congeals really quickly when it starts to cool.  I think I would lower the cream cheese and up the milk next time to see if this helps the texture.

This was just ok, not great.  I dislike bland foods and thought this was bland even after adding doubling the garlic, doubling the basil, adding nutmeg, adding 1/2 an onion and lots of salt.  The only thing I'd still want to try is to add red pepper to this.

This was excellent and easy to make. My husband is not a fan of zucchini, but loved this alfredo.  I must admit I cheated a little and put in the a jar of alfredo instead of making it, but didn't have all the ingredients on hand that day. 
Great recipe... thanks

This was very blah for me. I used bow tie pasta and just mixed it in the sauce. I added lots of parmesan cheese, extra garlic and salt. It definatley needed more basil, I just didnt have any.

What a fantastic and simple dish for using up all that summer squash.  Wouldn't change a thing!

Really tastey - I added the onion, as suggested - I also tried with a littel tarragon tossed in, and I tried with some crush red pepper - both were yummy additions!  I see this as a great, simple base to launch off into many flavors!   I think some shrimp or mushrooms would be great - Thanks:)

Hubby came home with a huge zucchini and cucumber from work and I decided to give this recipe a try since I had all the ingredients.  This was fantastic!  I used angel hair pasta instead of egg noodles.  I used 4 smaller cloves of garlic.  I added a small amount (1/2 palmful) of crushed bacon.  This was soooo good.  The sauce seemed very watery to me at first but I had a timing issue on my side dish and by the time I served it, the sauce had thickened perfectly.  Served with garlic bread and tomato/cucumber salad.  Wonderful!!  My picky kids even ate it pretty well!

It all looked and smelled great!  All up until you bite into it.  It was extremely bland.  I was disappointed since it smelled SOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!  But I added tons of lemon pepper seasoning.  After letting it sit overnight in the fridge it tasted much better.  I also added more sauce since it all soaked in.

A very unique way to use zucchini..makes for a nice, light summer meal.  I added just a sprinkle of nutmeg to mine.

I thought this was pretty good. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I didn't have enough zucchini, so I used yellow squash as well. Very tasty!

Quick and easy meal that I also added in some leftover chicken. Took "Chelsey E's" idea of replacing the milk with half and half, however, I used fat free half and half and lower fat cream cheese. Good Terry and thanks!
