This has been a favourite recipe for my family for years. You can also add torn leaves of fresh mint to make it even more refreshing.

Delicious! The mix of juices is so refreshing, and the tea adds a nice depth that you just don't get with other punches.  (I used Lipton Vanilla flavored black tea, and omitted the ginger ale.) I'm sure I'll be making this one for years to come. Thanks!

This recipe was a nice change of pace from your traditional "punch" recipes.  I made it for a 4th of july picnic.

I made this for a large event we were hosting. It is yummy! I added about six cups of tea total just to up the tea flavor. It was loved by several people at the event!

Great punch!! I was so excited when I found this recipe! It is just like the punch my grandmother used to make, which recipe got lost after she died. Luckily I remembered the main ingredients and was able to search for something similar. This is it! Thank you so much!

I used 4 cups each of the juices and the tea, and omitted the sugar altogether. It was delicious!

Easy and great. I used all organic ingredients and natural gingerale for my daughter's birthday party.  It was really great!

I was looking for something a little different from standard fruit juice and soda punches, and this recipe was a huge hit at our engagement party.  It will likely be making a come back at the bridal shower or the wedding reception.  It's very tasty and the tea adds an extra depth to the flavour and the colour.  I will probably cut down on the surgar a little bit next time, though.

My Husband's grandmother used to make this all the time. It is so refreshing and not as heavy as some punches can be. She always called it her Georgia punch.

I didn't think the tea looked good at all - the color was awful.  It tasted just okay.
