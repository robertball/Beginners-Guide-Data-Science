For those that had a problem with the batter falling off be sure to pat the fish dry with paper towel first and your oil is hot enough.  If you are using a basket with your fryer do not place fish in the bottom of the basket, leave the basket on the bottom and just drop the fish into the hot oil.  Doing this will keep the batter from coming off.

Great tasting recipe. After reading other reviews about the batter/crumbs not sticking, I decided to leave the mixture on the fish for 1/2 an hour before frying. It's a trick I use for frying chicken. It worked great for the fish too. I also added more salt to the batter.

Very good recipe, and very easy. The batter - fish - corn crumbs proportion should be changed, though. I used the same amount of batter for 2 lbs of fish, and still have some left (had to throw away). Next time I'll plan to cook at least 3 lbs of fish with this batter. 
The corn crumbs have to be used not all at once, but in small portions: take as many pieces of fish as you can cook at once in a deep-frier/skillet, dip in batter and then portion of corn crumbs, and cook; throw away the crumbs as they will be soggy and will no longer stick; replace with another portion of crumbs for the next fish portion, and so on. You will probably need more corn flakes then in the original recipe, but the crumbs guarantee to stick.
Also don't be shy to increase seasoning to taste - for example, more pepper, more garlic and perhaps some cayenne pepper.

This was terrific!  I was desperately looking for a batter to deep fry shrimp and used this one.  After pulling the shrimp from my Deep Fryer and letting them cool for about 10 minutes - absolutely fantasic!  Thanks Eldon!  I am going to post this to the shrimp category and give you credit!

Our family has been trying to get away from fired and fatty foods, but this recipe sounded too good to pass up. Guess what? It was mahhhhh-velous! I enjoy a good beer batter on almost anything, but the addition of cajun spices here made for a little "kick" that was delish!

Fantastic fried fish!  The best better I've made.  In a hugely surprising turn of events, this recipes works with haddock.  I would have given it six stars, but the recipe doesn't come with tartar sauce.  Imagine my dismay when I went to make some, and discovered that I had no sweet relish.

After a day of fishing, we decided to use this recipe to cook up our new filets. VERY GOOD RECIPE! I did half the batch using the cornflakes and half the batch using instant potato flakes.  The family was tied between which batch was better; cornflakes or potato flakes but the consensus agrees that this recipe is one to make again! Thanks Eldon!

This was okay. I didn't have cod so I used basa. I thought it was a little bland.  I didn't have any problems with the cornflakes staying on fish.  If I make this again I will make a thicker batter and and more cajun seasoning. Also there is enough batter to make more fish.

This was absolutely amazing!!  We have been looking for a good recipe for frying fresh walleye and this is it!  The first time we made this we did have some problems with the cornflakes sticking but the second time making it, I crushed the cornflakes more finely by putting about 4 C. Cornflakes into a gallon size baggie and going over it with a rolling pin.  We had no problems with the crumbs sticking.  The first time making this we used a light beer and the 2nd time we used a higher quality beer and it did make a difference.  The batter was thicker which helped the Cornflake crumbs stick better.  Also, make sure the fish is patted dry before dipping it in the batter.  This was by far the best fried fish we have ever had!!  Thanks Eldon!

I made a half recipe of the batter using the ingredients as written. I used peanut oil to fry the fish because of it's high smoke point. After battering and rolling the fish filets in the seasoned corn flakes, I lightly patted the corn flakes on the fish and let the filets rest on a wire rack for 5-10 minutes. This helps the coating stick to the fish. The end result was a very crunchy and tasty filet of fish that never lost any of it's coating. It's a keeper!

This is excellent...baked in the oven at 400 and tasted like fried fish. Put fish in batter in frig for 20 - 30 min before coating with cornflake crumbs. Will most definitely make again.

This is by far the best fried fish recipe we have ever had! I read the reviews and decided to do what I normally do when I make "Crunchy Chicken" ... so I patted off the fish fillets (walleye) - and then coated them with flour. When you do this it creates a smooth surface on the fish. Then when you dip them in the batter, do it quickly and let drip for about half a minute before coating in the Cornflakes mixture. I fried my fish at 325 degrees with a tablespoon of butter in the vegetable oil. The lower temp prevents smoking and burning of the fish. Turned out crunchy, flaky, tender, and very mouth watering. Recommend this to everyone! Delicious!

This is an excellent fish recipe. However If you like a more flavorful fish I would definitely double the garlic powder, salt and cajun seasoning and finish the off the cooked fish with a sprinkle of sea salt.  Will be making again for sure :)

This was sooooo good. My whole family loved it. Just make sure to push the fish into the corn flakes to make them stick!

I found NOTHING wrong with this recipe.  Yes, it did make a lot of batter but I didn't mind.  I did use 1.5# of fish because there are 5 of us in the family. It was so easy!  My 8yo son helped me make dinner last night and I really didn't have to help HIM too much.  He did most of the work - it's that easy. Try it!  You won't be disappointed.

Love it.  I used haddock for the fish, I dried it on paper towel and tossed it in flour first.  This helped keep the batter on the fish.  I also used this recipe on onion rings.

Hands down the BEST homemade fried fish I have tried. My husband and I had to make a few key substitutions, since we were using what we had on hand. Unfortunately, we did NOT have beer, so we had to sub milk (can't wait to try again with beer though), and we used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of crushed cornflakes. My husband also added some blackened Old Bay seasoning, which I think is the reason for the ka-POW! flavor. Additionally, we mixed the wet and dry ingredients separately, then dipped the fish in each, sprayed with butter spray, and dipped in the dry mixture again. You have to get the oil pretty hot and cook it just a little longer than you think to get a good crisp. AMAZING.

We spent all afternoon fishing just so that we could make this recipe again. DELICIOUS!! I wouldn't change a thing. We didn't have a problem with the batter sticking because I completely dry off the fish before I bread them. Will definitely make again...and again...and again...

I did a test trial of this recipe and only cooked one piece of fish. I would not make it again.  The batter looked like mud.  The fish was mushy tasting. The breading soaks up the grease like a sponge.  Advice:  Make up the batter and only fry one piece to see if you can tolerate it.

It was good but-- I'd lighten up on the cornflakes. When I buy fish, I want to TASTE fish; not a mouthful of crunchy batter.

Very tasty.  I substituted crushed crackers for the cornflakes and the Cajun seasoning with Old Bay.  I also sprinkled some chili powder into the mix to add to the flavor.  When coating the fish, I followed some member reviews to use a portion of the crumbs/seasoning a little at a time to coat the fish so as to not let the mixture get soggy.  When serving, I added some tabasco sauce to it to give it a little kick.  Enjoy!

Very tasty beer batter. I omitted the cornflake dredge. Didn't have any, nor breadcrumbs. Was looking for a simple beer batter anyway. My tip for battering "wet" foods is to dredge them in flour first, then batter. Works very well with getting things to stick. Overall..delicious, easy, minimal dishes and prep.

Great recipe, used Salmon instead of cod and didn't have cajun seasoning so I used Montreal Chicken Spice.  Had no problem with batter but followed a lot of others advice.  Patted fish dry, then put in batter, then in cornflake mixture.  Made a new batch of cornflake mixture for each piece so it was always crispy.   Put in fridge for about 15 min before deep frying.  Very very crispy and very tasty!!

Made this with red snapper for my daughter who loved it.  Didn't have any cornflakes on hand, used cornmeal.  Patted fish dry before coating and had no problem with batter falling off.

I made this last night.  My 23-year-old son high fived me after eating because he thought it was so good!  He's a health nut, so instead of frying the whole batch (We probably had 3 pounds), I baked a few pieces in a 400 degree oven until crispy brown and my oh my it was just as good on the baked pieces!!

The batter went plenty far - I didn't have to make anymore for the 3 pounds of fish.  I just had to make more crushed corn flakes.

This was wonderful. Very crispy. I try not to fry very often, but I will use this method for most any food I fry from now on. I did add a little more seasoning though. I have used corn flakes before and was never very impressed. I believe the flour in the batter helped the coating to stick.

This is some of the best fried fish I have ever prepared.  Although egg and beer are used in the batter, this is not the poofy/greasy batter that is associated with "beer batter" fish.  I used tilapia and Andy's fish breading, just because that's what I had and it turned out great.  Still added the seasonings as listed here, minus salt.  I think the keys to the success of this dish are the Cajun seasonings and the way it is prepared. Once you get everything set up, the process goes pretty quickly.  My husband has proclaimed that this is the way we shall fry all fish from now on!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't have corn flakes, so used fine cracker crumbs and left out the Cajun seasoning. I soaked the fish in the batter while the oil was heating. This turned out so great for a coating, that we did some shrimp also! Fantastic! Lots of leftover batter, it's true. However, I'll use this recipe on all my fried seafood. I'll never use a cornmeal coating again.

This recipe was not well thought out, but with a few alterations, turned out yummy!  First problem, there is enough batter for at LEAST 2lbs of fish meat.  

Second, the cornflakes aren't sticking problem.  Well, what I did was I had the cornflake mixture in one bowl, batter in another, then I had a third empty bowl.  I would dip the fillet in the batter on both sides, let it drip off, then hold the fillet in my hand, then sprinkle the corn flake mixture over the batter-covered fillet on both sides.  Your hands get a little messy, but you save a lot of crunchy coating this way, and the fillets turned out perfect!  Soo yummy.

Also, one last thing I did that helped is that I put spices in BOTH the batter and in the breading.  Although, I think the breading, too, needs a teaspoon or two at least of salt, it was a little bland.  Or you can use whatever seasoning you want, as long as it's got that salty spice to it.

Over all, I will definitely cook this recipe again, I really liked the extra crunchy coating.  Make sure to get the corn flakes extra crummy or they won't stick as well!

Good Job.

I tweeked the recipe a little, but it was awesome, even as tacos the next day that were a hit with the hubby's coworkers :)

I subbed the cod for whiting, added cayenne to the wet batter, and lemon pepper to the dry batter, and subbed 1 1/2 C. plain panco bread crumbs & 1/2 C. white stone ground corn flour for the cereal.

If I could have I would have rated this a no-star.  This was the biggest mess I've ever seen.  I couldn't get the corn flakes to stick to the fish no matter what I did.  Any that did stick by chance came right off when it hit the hot oil.  I'm sorry but I won't be making this again ever.

This was excellant. Better than Cronzy's my honey said! the kids were eating like a snack dipping into homemade tartar sauce before I could even get it on the table. I did change the crust some using crunched crackers as I was out of breadcrumbs. and I added steak spice to the crumbs a tbls for a little zip. took advice on using a cup at a time so as not to get crumbs all wet while dipping fish.  and used a plate for crumbs, much better than using a bowl. will definately be making very soon again.  Oh yeah, I used BASA fillets. Really thanks much for this recipe.

Best fried fish I've ever made. For those who have trouble with the breading staying on, just set the fish after coating on a cookie rack for about 10 or 15 minutes and there will be no problem. Also, if the oil is not hot enough the coating will stick to the pan. I also substituted panko bread crumbs for the cornflakes and the fish was very cripsy!

This was awesome! I didn't have corn flakes or bread crumbs, so I used 1 cup of crushed ritz crackers and 1 cup of instant potatoe flakes...Also, was not paying attention and dumped all of the spices in the crumb mixture (I also added a little dry mustard as well.) Wow!!!The breading had such a nice flavor, and I will swear by this recipe forever!!!

This made a very light & crispy coating for the fish...& I plan on trying it with other dishes, such as chicken, shrimp, or tempura-vegetables.  Next time, I plan on directly seasoning the fish itself along with having the asked-for seasonings in the egg-mix and the crumb-dip.  Thx Eldon!

This turned out awesome. The only thing I did different is I didn't have any cornflakes so I used panko crumbs.  This was extremely crunchy and golden brown. If your not going to use cajun make sure you use something with a little paprika to enhance the color. Everyone including the picky eaters loved it!!

Very easy!  Instead of cornflakes, I used some old onion flavored potato chips.  And I opted not to use cajun seasoning. I also had the problem where the batter didn't seem to be sticking to the fish, so we just dipped it in the batter again after putting crumbs on it.

Replace the corn flakes with Panko and I assure you that you will never have a better crispy fish coating in your life. I also use this recipe for deep frying pickles and anything else I can get my hands on to fry with this batter. This is such a hit with everyone!

I used to have a beer batter recipe but had misplaced it, so I came on here looking for another one.  The cornflakes sounded like an interesting addition, so I made half the fish with it and half without.  I had to add a bit more flour (maybe 1/4 - 1/2 a cup) to make the batter thick enough to stick to the fish, but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  I love it!  Both my fiance and I preferred the fish without the cornflakes, but still liked the cornflake one.  Would probably just make the beer batter without the cornflake coating next time around though.  This recipe is as good as my old one, so I won't be adjusting it.  Thanks for sharing and giving me a good beer batter recipe again!

The best batter that I've ever had!  We prepared it just as directed and it was great.  I'm not even a big fish either, but I went back for seconds.  This will be our go to recipe when it comes to fish fries from now on.

More flakes are required.  This was a nice and crispy coating however, it lacked flavor.  I think you should season your fish as your normally would use the batter mix and the flakes without the salt.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was great!  Served it with the dill sauce from Hudsons Baked Tilapia w/ Dill Sauce on this site.  I added a teaspoon of Old Bay and a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning to the breading mixture.

great recipe even for a fish frying "newbie" like me...things were going great (thanks to a thermometer in the oil, helping me keep a proper temp) until my son (3 years old) decided to take a closer look and dumped over the entire bowl of batter (where the fish was bathing in the batter) onto the waiting floor.  
What I DID fry, was very very good.  Oh, and pay close heed to the review which specifies to use the corn flakes in succession, otherwise, you end up with a bowl of mushy cornflake crumbs that won't stick to the fish!
p.s. I added just a bit (maybe a half cup) of yellow cornmeal to the batter.

Wow - this is great, my whole family loved it. I didn't change a thing. What I would do is make less of the liquid mixture - 1 c. of beer and 3/4 c. flour should be plenty.

Another 5 star recipe from my cooking comrades at allrecipes!  This a.m. this little King Mackerel was swimming in the Caribbean and tonight he was soaking in Elden's batter.  I used Carib beer and added 1/2 t cayenne and 1 t Shula's (the best hot sauce ever!) to the wet batter. I skipped the corn flakes and used corn meal instead.  Then I made sure my oil was good and hot.  Perfect!  Big hit at our house!

Everyone's favorite catfish at our fry for the wonderful flavor.  Cornmeal lovers preferred "Will's Spicy New Orleans Catfish Fries".  We added 1 t salt to the cracker mix, soaked the fish in the batter while our oil heated up, and used cracker crumbs.  This fish doesn't stay crispy, so eat it fresh out of the oil!

YUMMY! I didnt have any beer on hand so I used chicken stock instead. I also added some paprika and cayanne pepper. Its true that there is more batter then needed...but best to have more then not enough! I ended up using more cornflakes as well. LOVE IT!

My family enjoyed the flavor and crispiness of this recipe. No doubt that it's an excellent taste. But I rated only 4 stars because it's a pain in the butt to make. I'm glad I followed the advice of a previous review that mentioned the corn flakes get gooey, so use a separate dish to coat the fillet. I had such a gummy mess on my hands each time. I will probably try other recipes before I go through this process again.

It was absolutely delicious! I modified the batter recipe a little bit by adding additionally 1/2 teaspoon on yeast. Then, I dried the fish with paper towels and added it to the batter. I let the fish marinate with the batter 1 hour in the fridge before frying. The oil was very high before starting the frying process! My husband and I finished everything in less than 10 minutes

I made this recipe just as is and it was great. It was crispy and flavorful. I did use  Tilapia  instead  of Cod. Thank you so much for sharing a really good recipe.  For others, please stop changing the original recipe then give comments.

This is delicious!!!!  We made this last night and loved it.  Next time we are going to try Progressive Italian bread crumbs to see how it turns out.  We did have a problem with the corn flakes but all in all the taste was fabulous.

Thanks for the recipe, it was delicious and quite simple. I didn't have any corn flakes so I used Sun Chips. Ritz crackers also work great too.

I followed the recipe to the letter. The result: fried fish perfection. Popcorn-crisp exterior, steaming flaky cod on the inside. My wife claims it's the best fried fish she's ever had. One caveat, though: I prepared more fish than the two of us cared to eat in one sitting, and today's reheated leftovers aren't nearly as delectable. However much you prepare, be prepared to eat all of it.

This was a disaster!  The coating wouldn't stick to the fish so none of the seasoning stuck to it and it failed to cook properly. I had to add quite a bit of seasoning to give it any taste. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Good job.  My girls don't usually like fried fish but really enjoyed this.  I subbed saltines for the cornflakes and added cajun seasoning only to the slurry rather than the crumbs.  This one goes into the rotation.

To me this came out way too oily. I couldn't finish the fish. I give it a three because it could have been my fault, I may have left the fish in the oil too long, I'm not a fish expert yet. Not sure I'll try again.

Very very good.  Used talapia instead of cod, since that's what I had on hand.  Ran out of Cajun spice before I wanted to, but was still happy with the results.  The corn flakes made a nice and crispy coating.  Yum.

An ok recipe, didn't really like the cornflakes, everything else seem to work ok though. Had a little trouble getting them battered and dipped in dry mixture, but on second attempt using bread crumbs instead of cornflakes, they were much better, but still not a favortie. Don't think I'll try again.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  The flavor was just okay, and the cornflakes would not stick to the batter-dipped fish.  Also, it needed a little more salt and a dash of Cayenne pepper to add some zip.  I’ll look for another batter recipe.

I made it for dinner last night.  I used whiting instead of cod.  It was so crispy and the flavor  was good but I like my fish well seasoned. a little squeeze of lemon juice after serving brightened the flavor nicely.

Awesome extra extra crunchy fish fry.  Next time around I will try putting corn flakes in the food processor to get a finer crust.  All around great recipe for any kind of fried fish I used porgy!

I had the deep fryer out, and was searching for a recipe for some gorgeous halibut fillets I had. The corn flake breading and beer batter were perfect. As some reviews state, make sure the fish is dry before applying batter, and that the oil is at the hottest temperature to prevent it from becoming soggy. I don't always nail it the first time, but in this case, it was AWESOME.

Great recipe.  I didn't do the corn flakes but the batter was very good. Used Pollack and talapia, both were equally good. will be making this again.

I doubled the recipe and added about an extra half cup of flour to thicken it a little.  Instead of adding the Cajun seasoning tho the bread crumbs I just put it in the batter.  I dried my fish and lightly floured them prior to dunking and breading. I also followed someone else's suggestion of using the left over batter for onion rings they were awesome too! I just cut the onions into rings,  dredged lightly in flour and then dunked them in the batter and then straight into the oil.  I used stripper and sand bass but this would be excellent with any white fish or shrimp.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again and again...

I used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. It turned out very good and crispy indeed. I didn´t have any problems with batter falling off. I only waited around 5minutes between coating and frying, but they did feel very dry on the outside. I used a deep fryer.
But as others mentioned, it does lack salt. I´ll do it again, adding more salt.  Maybe adding more cajun too, since it was not spicy at all!

great flavor!  I used gluten-free flour and it turned out surprisingly well!  I also put it in an air fryer instead of deep frying.

I went off-book quite a bit, but was delicious!  I replaced 1/2 the flour with bisquick; then used about 1 cup of buttermilk and 1+ cup of ale; then chopped up and added fresh dill to the batter.   I let the fish sit in the batter on the counter top for about 20-30 minutes before frying—no problems with batter not sticking to the fish, or the chips.  (I didn't have the corn flake crumbs, but was still tasty!)

We really loved the crispiness of the coating and we plan on following this method from now on, however.....the coating seemed to need more seasoning (salt). We didn't have cajun seasoning to mix with the corn flakes, but we used Old Bay.  We are going to play with this recipe to add more salt, use actual cajun seasoning or find another seasoning that will amp this up to a 5 star. :) Thanks for this recipe. Totally improved our fish frys!

We just got a deep fryer and this recipe is my family's favorite. The batter amount can be halved for plenty of fish. I think there should be a cooking time on this.. especially for us newbies. I would guess that I cooked mine 5 minutes. I have used cod and tillapia both with success.
Thank you!

This was delicious!  I only had catfish on hand so I used that. I didn't have cornflakes so I used a half and half mixture of Panko bread crumbs and cornmeal. I also took another reviewers suggestion and placed the fish in the batter for a short period.  It turned out deliciously crunchy.  Even my son that won't eat fish ate this!  This is a keeper!

This was so good!  Used 3 lbs of fish and didn't increase the beer batter and it was still plenty.  Everyone LOVED this fish!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Didn't have corn flakes so I used crushed ritz crackers and fried in a frying pan with about 1/4 inch of oil. Turned out great!

Not sure how this works.  My boyfriend found this recipe and we used it for fish tacos, but it turned out so good, we decided to just have fish sticks (better than any frozen fish ever)  This is a great, easy recipe.  I love to cook too.  We should exchange recipes.

Very good recipe. Used fresh-caught white bass in place of cod. Really helped cover the "gaminess" of the fish.

WAY TOO MUCH BATTER FOR 1 POUND OF FISH.  DEEP FRIED ANS BATTER CAME OFF. TASTE WAS GOOD BUT MESSY.
