WOW, I don't even know what to say...this is absolutely, out of this world FANTASTIC!!!!! I contemplated just making 1/2 a recipe, but I am so glad I decided to just make the whole thing because I think between myself and my son we already ate 1/2 of it, lol. I made this as written, except that I'm lazy, so I just used a box of frozen chopped spinach that I thawed and drained really well (I just threw it all in there). I also added a couple pinches of salt at the end, but that's a personal preference. My mom makes the BEST traditional hummus that I've ever eaten, but this is right up there with that. I will definately be making this VERY often! Thanks, Andy, for sharing such a wonderful recipe~YUM! :)

I just finished making this and now it's chilling, but so far, this is wonderful. I cooked my own garbanzos from dried...used about 2 1/2 cups cooked. I am not adding the red peppers because we don't like them. This came together easily, but isn't as garlicky as I expected...that might change after it sits a while. BUT...even so, it's beautiful...such a great green color and creamy and very, very good. Will make often.

Made this for Recipe Group. I ended up using frozen drained spinach. I couldn't for the life of me get the beans to puree without adding liquid before the other stuff. Just pureed it all together adding most of the liquid back in from the beans. It was pretty tasty with nacho chips. If I had used fresh spinach I think I would have just wilted down in the same pan. Thanks CNM!

Fantastic! I LOVE hummus and this was my first time making it, I always buy it in the grocery store. This recipe combines all my favorite flavors, and it really is over the top. I followed the recipe as written,  except I used a 10oz. package of frozen chopped spinach, squeezed drained, and it worked just fine. I cut a red bell pepper in half and used that as my serving "bowl", and I toasted wheat pita points. My friends LOVED it, and complimented how fresh this tasted compared to store bought hummus, I felt proud :) Thank You CNM Catering for sharing your lovely creation. We plan to make this at least twice a month to use as a dip for fresh veggies as well. This is a winner for sure!

I made this as the Recipe Exchange Group Recipe for the week of August 2nd. I too started with dried beans, so I used liquid from the roasted red peppers to make up the missing. (The liquid from my dried beans didn't look very appetizing.) My husband liked this! I did process the red peppers right into the hummus, because my husband prefers them that way. We've never had artichokes before, so I'm not sure which flavor they were in there, but this was a tasty hummus which I'm sure would be enjoyed by anyone who likes the spinach & artichoke dips sold commercially, because if we liked it, it must be good! I particularly liked the hot sesame seeds as a substitute for expensive tahini; I always have olive oil & sesame seeds, so I think I'll keep that idea for the future! Thanks for the recipe, CNM Catering!

I love hummus and I love spinart dip, but this did not work for me.  It didn't taste like either one.  :(  I'll stick to one or the other.

This is fabulous and flavorful.  However, I used fresh spinach and the hummus is VERY green.  We did not mind, would look great on your Christmas Brunch table.  The colored picture was deceiving.

I made this for Recipe Group (a week late) and followed the recipe exactly except for cutting it in half.  I will end up eating it, but I still like Athenos brand's Roasted Red Pepper much better.

This was excellent! I love hummus, DH isn't much of a fan. So after I made it, I put half into a dish for me in the fridge and the other half, I melted 4 oz of cream cheese in for DH. Both versions were great! One was more like traditional hummus (with a twist) and the other was more like a classic artichoke dip. I topped both with chopped pimientos because I was out of roasted reds. Served both with seasoned, toasted Pita bread. Delcious recipe and will definitely be making agin! Thanks CNM!

Yum this is good!  I started with dry garbanzo beans, so I just reserved some of the cooking liquid and being lazy, I wilted my spinach in the pan with the oil and garlic, but those were my only changes.  This was eaten so quickly, I wish I had doubled the recipe.  Makes a nice change to my usual garlic/lemon hummus.  Thanks for sharing.

I doubled this recipe and made around 14 cups of hummus. I cooked my own garbanzo beans with garlic. So instead  of adding garlic later I just used the cooked garlic. Instead of the water I used the liquid the beans were cooked in. I also used tahini instead of the toasted sesame seeds. I also used frozen instead of fresh spinach because of the already high costs of the ingredients. I can get 10oz frozen spinach for $1 at the local grocery store. I dumped all of the ingredients into the blender and blended until smooth. My children and I love it.

Great recipe! Revisions I made: used tahini instead of sesame seeds & put the garlic right in processor w/ the chick peas instead of toasting it. Very tasty...my family loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

Totally awesome. I doubled it. Squeezed some lemon juice on top. I also added some chopped fresh tomatoes and chopped marinated artichoke hearts when it was done. YUMMY!!!!!!!

Made this for Christmas Eve events. It barely got touched. In my area, the ingredients were expensive. It had potential and it was very pretty, but I will not make again.

This is AWESOME!!!!!  It's better the second day when the flavors have mingled.  And no guilt!  I had it with multi-grain crackers but would be great with fresh veggies as well.

So good!  It's also good on Wasa crakers with some lettuce and whatever else you choose.  Excellent as a dip or a spread!!!

This one was just okay to me. Think i would add more artichoke next time. Spinach flavor a bit overwhelming.

This was a really fun idea and I was excited to try it.  In the end I needed to double the artichokes, add a healthy dose of lemon juice, and one more garlic clove, raw to make it suit our tastes.

It wasn't bad. Spinach felt a bit overwhelming. I will try making it with less of it next time. It goes better with chips than with veggies. I couldn't taste artichokes so I will play with a recipe to make it work to my taste.

Pretty good.  I had to put almost all of the garbanzo beans liquid back in so best to just put it all in the belender. I had to add some salt.

Worst recipe ever!  I feel compelled to write a review because I always have good luck with the recipes from this site.  However, this dip had no taste at all.  I was greatly disappointed.
