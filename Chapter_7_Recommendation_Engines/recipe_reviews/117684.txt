Wow! The spices are a perfect blend. Spicy enough for my Mexican husband to want seconds, mild enough that my young children didn't complain. Even my super picky 8 year old loved it. I flattened the chicken with a meat mallet to even out the thickness and reduce cooking time. Can't wait to try it on the BBQ grill.  This is a new family favorite!

This recipe is delicious! I didn't change a thing, just added to it. Just before chicken is done browning, I add green pepper, red pepper, and onion. I serve the chiken and veggie mix over rice with black beans to make a hearty delicious meal. Definitely will make again!

This spice blend does not require extra seasoning at the table (so some may think it is too salty).

We froze bs breasts in this rub then defrosted/marinated for two days before sauteeing.  This worked well for those who make meals ahead.

Leftovers were also good, served on top of a SW salad.

very flavorful! I used to buy the pre-cooked southwestern chicken strips from the store to add to my fettuccini alfredo and wanted to make my own so I tried this recipe. It was very good and much better than store bought. thanks for the yummy recipe!

Perfect! So quick and easy it can't help but be a winner. I did use the lime juice but I might omit it next time because it didn't really add flavor.

Delicious, simple, and quick!  We had this over seasoned black beans, which was a perfect combination.

AMAZING!  I have used this spice mix with both chicken AND steak (although, truthfully, I prefer it on chicken), as well as without the lime (I definitely missed it when I didn't use it!).  I had to purchase the chili powder, but it was well worth it because I plan on using this recipe again and again.  It's so hard to believe this recipe is good for you!  I served with brown rice with salsa and small amount of sour cream, as well as charred red and green peppers and a sweet onion that had been seasoned only with a little salt and pepper and sauteed in canola oil.

This was a little more bland than I had hoped, but it was pretty good with well-seasoned sides.

This was good and really easy to make! I put a little extra lime juice on mine and I thought it helped a lot! Thanks.

Very easy and delicious dish. Didn't have lime juice so substituted lemon juice. Chicken was very moist. I doubled the ingredients so I had enough "rub" to put on my chicken as the breast halves I had were rather large. Will definitely have again!

Yum! My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. We added the chicken to our southwest style salad. Will definitely make it again :)
