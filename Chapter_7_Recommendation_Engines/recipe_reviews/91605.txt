This was delicious!  The only thing I did different was I added a can of stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  Very, very good.  If you like it spicy you could add some hot sauce or a little chili powder.  I've turned the AC down so I can pretend it's cold outside.  This soup is perfect for that...and healthy too.  PS.  I cooked it on the stove for 45 minutes instead of using the crock pot.  I was hungry.

Great recipe. I added hamhocks, and added extra water from the start. I also added a half cup extra lentils and used stewed tomatoes. Whole family loved it including kids 5 and 7.

This soup was thick and hearty.  I really enjoyed the flavor.  You may need to add a little more water, as mine turned out a little too thick.  A really enjoyable meal on a cold day with warm corn bread.

I have made this several times because my family enjoys it so much - even my son who is not a soup guy!  To make it easier and faster - I use the frozen chopped onions and the individual ham steak which I chop the night before.  I use 16 oz of lentils and add 2 more cups of water and 3-4 chicken boullion cubes.  Coming home from work to this dinner is so great on a cild winter night.  I serve it with fresh Italian bread and some sliced fresh mozzarella.

This is a recipe worth keeping, but the cooking time seemed long to me. Lentils using take 20 to 30 minutes to cook in boiling water, so 11 hours seemed way off. And, so it is. After 11 hours the top of my stew was very dark and moisture in the slow cooker was almost nil. I added 2 cups of chicken broth to bring the stew back. It was eatable, but next time I am limiting cooking time to 3 to 4 hours on low. Fully cooked ham, veggies and lentils don't need half a day to cook. I would have rated the recipe 5 stars if not for the cooking time shown.

I used A LOT of lentils, which was not a bad thing, but it was really, really thick and needless to say, I had to add more broth. No matter, it was fabulous! I had a ham bone in the freezer from a couple of months ago which was just waiting for this meal occasion. It gave the soup an incredible flavor. I bought a small turkey ham and chopped it up to add to the mix. I grew up always adding vinegar to my soup bowl, so I threw that in too. Man was this ever good on this very cold N.J. March evening. Thanks so much "Queendiva1"; we loved it!

Really good. It takes eleven hours so instead of starting it in the morning, I started it the night before and let it cook all night. Then I just reheated it later that night to eat. I did add a little salt.

Mmmmm, this soup is so simple and satisfying. I originally tried this recipe to get rid of left-over ham, but now I am making it all the time! It is so healthy, extremely inexpensive to make, and the leftovers are very good.

This is probably my favorite recipe for soup on this site. No changes except for cooking time. I cook on high for about 4 hrs. and it always comes out perfect.

This soup was excellent.  We used the leftover Ham from Christmas Dinner and made Soup for New Year's Dinner.  I increased the water by approx 1 cup and probably could have added more but it wasn't absolutely necessary.

Great recipe for my leftover Christmas ham!  It cooked in my crockpot on low for 11 hours and boy did the house smell heavenly when I came home from work!  I used closer to 2 cups of ham (wanted to use it up) and an extra cup of water.  Also used an entire 8 ounce can of tomato sauce (hated to throw the whole can for only 8 teaspoons as the recipe called for).  I don't have a food processor so it was alot of chopping, but it was worth it.  This recipe is a keeper.

One of the top ten soup recipes I've found on the site! I used stewed tomatoes with diced green chiles in lieu of the sauce and it gave the soup a nice little kick. I also added another cup each of lentils and water. Perfect and thank you queendiva1!

Well all I can say is that I appreciated all the reviews and don't understand ANY of the negative reviews.

I had a lot of ham leftover from Christmas so I doubled this recipe and used a 7 quart crock pot.  I added about 4 1/2 cups ham (with the ham bone), 2 cups or 1 bag (16 oz) of lentils, 1 frozen block of spinach, a can of tomato sauce, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, tobasco sauce, no extra water, chicken bouillon instead of broth, and went by the recipe the rest of the way.  I had a honey baked ham that wasn't salty to begin with and did not have any problem with salty flavor.  This soup is delicious!  For sure saving and using for leftover ham again!!

Like many others I changed my cooking time as well.  I cooked on high for 7 hours and low for 2.  No vegetable turned to mush and the lentils were cooked perfectly.

Love this recipe. I made two changes, I didn't have time to use my slow cooker, so it was made on my stove top and when I found that my husband had used up all of my tomato sauce I substituted a large can of crushed tomatoes and left out the extra water. Because I used the stove top method I fried off my vegetables first and then added the rest of the ingredients. I will certainly make this again and thank you for sharing it.

I use a 14.5 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of 8 teaspoons and two cans of broth instead of 32 ounces. It's perfect, neither too watery nor too thick. Our soup is ready to eat in 9-10 hours, so just keep an eye on yours. While the taste won't change, you don't want your lentils to overcook to the point of disintegrating.

After the comments about not having enough water, I decided to make this as stated in the recipe (no extra liquid), but to check on it every couple hours to make sure it would not burn. I was very glad I did NOT add extra water since it ended up being the perfect consistency. I have to add though, that I cooked it on medium and 4 hours less cooking time, so that might effect the liquid level somehow. Anyway, flavor-wise this was ok, but we prefer a different recipe for lentil soup so will probably not make this again. It's always good to try new things once in a while though!

This was a good start to lentil soup recipe, but needs something much more. My husband loves soups but didn't even get 25% ate. He pushed it aside and said it lacked flavor. Kids didn't eat much either. I will be back on the hunt for a new lentil soup recipe

I didn't have 11 hours, so I cooked it on high for 4 hours and then turned it to low until dinner time (2-3 more hours), and it worked great.

We added dried wild mushrooms, specifically porcini/boletes, and it was outstanding.  We were surprised how flavorful this soup was with just another combination of such common ingredients.

Very tasty. I didn't have slow-cooker time allowance so I did a quick 1 hour stovetop version.  Used all ingredients minus the 1 cup of water. Used 1 tablespoon of olive oil to cook the veggies for ~10 minutes. Added lentils, broth, herbs, brought to a boil and reduced to a simmer for ~ 1 hour. Served with fresh baked bread and cheese. Yummy.

Might be better than my mother's, and that's saying something. I used several links of hot italian sausage that were left over from a pasta meal (cooked, in sauce), which I sliced into 1/2 inch pieces, instead of ham. And I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because it's what I had. There were wrinkled noses in my family when I said I was making lentils, but everyone had seconds. Was even better the next day. I'm making it for my dad when he's here over Thanksgiving weekend, that will be the real test! Thank you for an excellent recipe queendiva1.

This was a good recipe for a hearty soup meal.  The good assortment of different-colored vegetables plus  those heart-friendly lentils really pack a healthy punch!  I served it sprinkled with shredded lite cheese, and a nice crusty whole-wheat bread on the side.   
All I did differently was to add a little more ham to it (I used 2 cups, cubed a little larger than specified, and I used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes, undrained).  The larger chunks of ham really turned it into a meal rather than just soup; the diced tomatoes added texture; and the juice from the can of tomatoes compensated for the additional water that most here recommended, only with added flavor. 
My family members really enjoyed this recipe, and asked me to make it again and again.   I sure will, too!

This was quite good, although I would call it more of a stew than a soup, as there was very little liquid left at the end of the cooking time.  I didn't have any ham, so I used two smoked ham hocks instead and they gave the soup a really nice flavor.  I did need to add a little salt at the end, but otherwise this did not need any additional seasoning.  Like other reviewers, I used a whole 8-ounce can of tomato sauce instead of just 8 teaspoons because I didn't want to waste the rest of the can.  Next time I think I'll omit the tomato sauce and add a can of diced tomatoes instead.  I served this over steamed white rice, which was great.  It would be just as delicious with couscous, brown rice, or quinoa.

I made this on the stove instead of the slow cooker since I didn't have all day, just 2 hours.  I added a link of chorizo since it needed to be used up and a bit of red pepper flakes for a kick.  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce, and I simmered for an hour, then added the lentils and simmered another hour.  DH ate his bowl very quickly, and normally he's not a bit soup eater.  I will have to try this again in the slow cooker too.

This is amazing! 
I'm going to be one of those annoying people and list all my tweaks. I swapped celery for corn and the tomato sauce for diced tomatoes added at the very end and swapped the ham for bacon. I also find it much quicker to grate the carrots rather than chop them. I think that's one of the great strengths of recipes like this, they're very open to small changes.

My whole family LOVED this soup! The only change I made was added about a cup of water.  I just used the ham bone with some ham on it.  Great recipe and it will be added to my favorites!

Made it almost exactly, but used more lentils and water as the reviews suggested. I also used leftover pork loin from last night's dinner instead of ham. Sausage would be great, too. Thank you, this was delicious! :)

I turned it into a vegan soup (I was making it for a friend who is vegetarian for religious reasons) by using vegetable broth, and omitting the ham.  I added more lentils, more water, and more oregano, thyme, and basil due to the other comments.  It turned out AMAZING.  He ate several bowls and asked me for the recipe!  Easy soup for vegans/vegetarians.

Left out celery and used a small can of tomato paste instead of sauce.  Used 16oz of lentils.  My family loved this.

This was my first slow cooker recipe, and I opted to try for the 4-hour version a few other reviewers reported, but it did not work for me. (Maybe others used already cooked lentils?) I used dried green lentils. In addition, I vegetarianized this (omited ham, used vegetable stock.) It was okay. I will not use this recipe again, but will continue searching for another lentil soup recipe for the slow cooker.

Delicious, but don't try to do this one in a hurry.  It really is better if you slow cook it for the 11 hours. :)

I had some ham to use up but didn't have 11 hours, so I made this on the stovetop. I didn't alter any ingredients, but did sautee the veggies in a bit of olive oil first. Delicious...and the kitchen was so fragrant!

Delish and even better the next day...I used all broth and added about 1 cup more and it was still a fairly thick soup.  I doubled this and used 16oz tomato sauce.

I threw the ingredients for this hearty soup into the crockpot last night and it was ready to pack for a healthy and filling lunch today.  I prefer thick soups, so the consistency was perfect for my taste.  The spices added a nice flavor, though I did add a half teaspoon of salt.  This recipe could be easily adapted for ingredients on hand.

This is a super good soup!  Very filling and I found the spices spot on.  This also had a great consistency, not too thin or too thick.  The only thing different that I noticed for me was the cook time, it only took about 8 hours in my crockpot.  Although, that's probably has to do with mine being a newer model.  Will definitely make this again!

I've made this twice now and have used tomato sauce in one and tomato paste in the other and like the sauce better.  I'm going to make it one more time using diced tomatoes but either way, I really love this recipe and the consistency (thicker than a soup).  I have added about 1/4C of barley as well and it turns out fine as I like it a little thicker.  I have printed this recipe out and will use it a lot this winter - thanks!

This is great!  I think this is the same recipe my mom uses- it tastes just like hers!  This is a really good, flavorful and hearty soup.  The ham can make it really salty, so I used low-sodium broth and no salt added tomato sauce.  I had extra ham to use, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of water to compensate.  Didn't have any celery, but I didn't miss it.  If I made it again I'd make sure I had it, though.  This is a very easy recipe to make, and it's great for fall.

I thought this was pretty good and the hubby loved it. I ended up making this on the stove. I liked how the vegetables stayed just a little crunchy to balance out the tenderness of the lintels.

Yummo! Ok, so I used navy beans instead of lentils and a huge can of tomato sauce instead of 8oz. But your could put anything in this pot so long as you let it simmer, and simmer. I cooked mine like for 4 hours, then served it the next day. It was awesome!

Not usually a soup maker, but thought this sounded yummy - and wow - is it ever!  You can speed up the cooking by cooking on high rather than low...mine was cooked after about 6 hours.  Went through first batch so quickly, I had to make a fresh batch the following day!

This turned out great, very tasty and so I'm not sure why some on here said it was blah etc.? I did add more pepper as I like it and added a large size (32oz?) can of diced tomatoes with the liquid, added an extra cup of water as I'd read it might be salty, plus I'd used only a small low sodium can of chicken broth as that's what I had in the cupboard.
It turned out perfect after about 7 hours on low, I left it one more hour a total of 8hrs as the carrots were still firm, but I had not diced them, instead sliced them into 'circles'...maybe it was the size.
The lentils (the orange kind) were still shaped and were soft and tasty. The house smelled great! I'd definitely make this again!

Definitely a recipe that you can adapt to what you have on hand. I didnt have celery so just used a tsp of celery seed for flavoring. Used red onion instead of white/yellow. Used turkey ham instead of regular ham. ADDED 1 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1/2 tsp of salt as it was a bit bland for our tastes. We like lots of spices in our food. :-)

The hubster said it was his new favorite soup! I used more ham and celery (to use it up), added a can of petite diced tomatoes, a little more of the herbs seasonings, added 1 cup of water, and used a 6 oz. can of tomato paste instead of sauce.  Used green lentils and they definitely needed the 11 hours cooking time.  We really enjoyed the result and the husband said that he wouldn't change a thing!  Served with freshly made skillet corn bread & it was perfect!  Thank you for this simple and delicious recipe!

I'm sorry but I did not like this soup at all.  I followed the recipe down to the letter.  I thought the onion was very overpowering, and I love onion in my recipes.  Even with cutting back the onion and/or making some other adjustments I don't think I would make this again.  It just didn't hit the spot for me or my family.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was horrible.  The lentils were still hard, and it had way too much onion flavor.  I put this on at 8:00 pm and left it on until 8:00 am.  I was going to try to cook it longer to see if the lentils softened, but I threw out the whole pot.  A waste of my time.

First things first - this soup is excellent, the ham and lentils provide an excellent source of protein, and the spices could not have been better. I followed all the directions except for one thing - I had an extra ham bone laying around so I threw it in for more ham flavor. This is a 5 star, kids 3, 5 and 8 ate double servings and the smell of it cooking all day is delicious. 

I want to make this note: Use ONLY Green Lentils to make this soup. Red Lentils turn this soup starchy, thick and paste-like. I cooked mine the 11 hours as listed in the recipe and took a picture of my Green Lentils to share - note how it is still completely whole (and so tasty!)

Finally - be sure to soak your Lentils for at least and hour if not overnight in Hot Water. 

Excellent job on this soup.

This is really easy & also really good. I made the recipe exactly. It's a good thickness & it's seasoned well, though I used a salty chicken broth & salty 1/2inch slab of black forest ham from a deli. I think with the tomato sauce, you need to go big or go home. I don't really taste any tomato in the final product, so I should have followed reviewer advice & added in a can of stewed tomatoes (probably chop them first) instead of the pointless 8tsp of sauce.

This was very flavorful, but I made two critical changes. 1) I used the whole can of tomato sauce. 2) I cooked it for 6 hours. 11 seemed like a lot, and sure enough, 6 was plenty. I will make this again.

Pretty adequate flavor in the soup though I think it could use more. I made this on the stovetop and used thick slices of ham from the deli. I'm positive that the better flavor the ham, the better the soup is. I also added 3/4 cup of water which was perfect consistency and use 8 oz of tomato sauce, not tbsp. Would make again but would find better ham and maybe add sausage like others have suggested or I may try cooking some bacon in the pan first for a smokier flavor. It also makes a huge pot of soup so for our family of 3, I will halve it next time.

Dee-lish.  I'm thinking this is around a 3.7 for what it is: a hearty bowl of goodness after a long and cold day's work. Due to my schedule, it cooked a little longer than 11 hours and the lentils had completely lost their shape (not sure if they were supposed to). This is a good introduction to a lentil based soup (for someone (me) who thought lentils were tasteless beans ... which they're not). This is a great base for any direction you want to go!  I'll likely make this again in the winter this year :)

My kids really loved this too.  I subsituted cooked turkey breast for the ham because it is what I had in the fridge.  I did increase the amount of diced turkey  to about 2 1/2 cups because we like a good amount of meat in our soups.

Easy and excellent soup especially on a cold day. I didn't have time to wait all day for it to cook so just simmered it on top of the stove for a couple hours and it turned out great. 

This recipe is very forgiving and you could add/substitue/reduce ingredients easily.  Rather than opening a jar of tomato sauce for 8 tsp I just used an 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and bumped up the ham/veggies to account for the extra liquid.

Delicious - even better the next day!

I used Italian sausage instead of ham.  Took casings off,  browned it for color and flavor, then threw it into the crock-pot.  It was delish!  My vegetable-hating husband even liked it and has asked for it again.

after reading over the other reviews, I made a few changes. Since I didn't get everything into my crock pot till 9am I cooked it on HIGH for about 3 hours and then lowered it to low.. WORKED GREAT!!! I didn't have tomato souce so I left it out, and I had picked up a white wine and herb stock the day before and used the in place of the chicken stock and dried herbs. I used two cups of lentils and added an extra 1 1/2 cups of water.. My house smells so good, and it was so tasty.. Made crusty rolls to go with.. YUM!!!

Made this for dinner tonight. Not familiar with eating or cooking lentils, but was interested in trying this.  Definitely simple, filling, and satisfying.   I found it needed the full 11 hours in my (older) crock pot, on low.  I'd read through many reviews prior to making this.  I added a combination of ingredients, suggested by others. The included: Can of diced tomatoes with mild green chilis, 1/8 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 diced sweet, red pepper, along with the other listed ingredients.   Good flavors, a slightly sweet flavor, (I thinking from a the ham and tomatoes, maybe?)...very good. Thanks for this recipe...we'll definitely enjoy it again and again.

We really enjoyed this soup. I used 3 14oz cans of low sodium chicken broth and used the whole small can of tomato sauce.  I did not add any water at the beginning, but I ended up adding extra water later. The soup was still very thick. I mixed this up the night before and refrigerated it overnight. The lentils may have absorbed some of the liquid. That may account for needing to add more liquid. This was the first time I have had lentils, but it won't be the last. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe! The only changes I made: added a 1/2 box of frozen spinach and some cayenne (yum!) and used stewed tomatoes as other reviewers suggested. Cooked it on high for 4 hours. Even my picky 9-year-old loved it. The whole family requested that I put it in our permanent rotation.

I did this over the stove (simmered for an hour or so) rather than the crockpot since we were having it for lunch and it was excellent!  Also, instead of the water and tomato sauce I used tomato juice because I had it on hand.  I really think that it was seasoned just right.

Don't know what happened....it all sounded good.  Cooked for almost 15 hours and lentils were still hard.  Soup was watery and didn't taste well at all.

Nice, fragrant, flavorful soup. I like the balance of lentils, veggies & broth. Family members who are "meh" on the idea of lentil soup in general really like it, too.   Maybe saltiness depends on the brand/type of ham and the chicken broth that gets used, because I don't like highly salted foods but I've never had a problem with this soup being too salty.  11 hours is not too much time for it to cook in my crockpot; it could cook for hours more, I think, without actually burning, although I wouldn't cook it that long because all the veggies would be mush and the ham would be tough. I start it the night before, and turn it off as soon as the lentils are tender (it keeps cooking for a while after the pot is turned off). Also, this is great with a ham bone or some hamhocks rather than cut up ham.

My husband and I both loved this. I followed the recipe exactly. It doesn't specify what type of lentils to use, I used the tiny split red ones (because that's what I had) which pretty much disintegrate during the cooking process making the broth very thick and hardy. Excellent!

I made this soup tonight.  I doubled the recipe.  I found that it did not take 11 hours to cook, more like 9.  If I cooked it longer it would have cooked the life out of the ham.  I also felt that salt needed to be added to the broth.  It would have been awesome if I would have had a ham hock to throw into the soup.  I also added a little paprika for additional warmth.  Overall, it turned out really good.

I have made another lentil soup recipe for many years that is also at this site.  Tried this one and it's just as good but in a slightly different way.  I like that it's done in the crock pot.  I got it going at 7:30 am and put on high for about 45 mins and then let cook on low till 4:30.  I put on the table to start cooling.  At 5:00 it was still pretty hot.  It was cooked perfectly so I'd say mine only took 9 hrs of cooking.  I did not put just 8 tsps of tomato sauce as recipe calls for and wondered if that was a typo.  I put a whole 8 oz can and that worked well.  I never had to add any other liquid and the soup was just the right thickness.  I used some leftover spiral ham which flavored it nicely.  Great flavor, easy to make, hearty soup! This is definitely a keeper!

We loved this soup.  Great combination of flavors. I made a few changes from the original recipe, but not enough to limit the value of my review.  First, since I didn't have 11 hours, I cooked it on high for 3 hours and low for another 3 hours.  The lentils were soft and the flavors were substantially blended.  Second, I added an additional 3 cups of water before cooking. I could tell that without this additional liquid, it was going to be too much like a stew when finished.  I'm glad I did this and actually wish I had added another 2 cups. I'll be making this again.

So yummy...after reading reviews I added 1 cup of extra water and 2 Roma tomatoes that I squished into the crock pot and rough chopped. Added a couple dashes of tobasco and Worcestershire and carmelized the onions before adding to the crockpot to bring out the sweetness. Also made son jalapeño cheddar corn muffins and southwestern corn corn muffins. Soooooooo good.

This is excellent...however, it only took 6 hours to cook, not 11.  I served with my homemade whole wheat bread.  Very nutritious!  I added chicken instead of ham.  I also made my own tomato sauce, rather than store bought.

Solid 4 stars!  I cooked mine on low for 9-1/2 hours and it was plenty done at that point.  I checked it about halfway through and it looked like it was running low on liquid so I added another cup of water.  It was quite flavorful and particularly enjoyed by my 3 y/o grandchild.  We did add salt and pepper to taste on an individual basis.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, queendiva1!

This was my first attempt cooking or eating lentils, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Not only did I love it, but my 3 year old kept asking for more. I figure it is a great way to get veggies in your kids. The second time I made it, I left out of the ham and added some black beans for a vegetarian version and it was just as good.

Great hearty soup for those cold days. I sauted in a separate pan the onions, garlic, carrots and celery in olive oil before putting them in the crockpot to shave off 2 hours of cooking time. Served it with hot corn bread with honey and sour cream topping. Yum!

Wonderful!  Per another cook's suggestion, I added a can of stewed tomatoes.  It was hearty and pairs well with red wine and sourdough or French bread. I have also eaten it with pita, and this, I think, is my favorite.

very good stew.  Next time I would add more ham and more carrots.

I made again and added more ham and carrots.  It turned out good but a little salty from the extra ham.  Next time I'd cut back on the chicken broth and add more water.

My wife and I love Lentil soup and it is cold and rainy today, so the planning was excellent.  I had one major question.  The recipe calls for 8 teaspoons of Tomato Sauce.  I had to feel this was a typo so I went with the full 8 ounces instead.  It worked fine

I am probably only giving this as many as three stars because of peer pressure!  I have been searching for a lentil recipe becasue I want to like lentils, but this was not it. We really did not like this and only ate one bowl full and dumped the rest out.  We are not vegetarians.  Maybe the great reviews are coming from those who don't eat meat.  I just thought this recipe was blah. Why do I feel like I should apologize?

This was delicious! I used a whole can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato paste, because I didn't have any. It is an easy, cheap, and healthy soup...and my husband, who had never had lentils, loved it!

10/20/13 I made this again last night... I stuck to the original recipe but used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce (seems I never have that at hand). It will be part of the football lunch today for our guests!

Excellent soup! I added a pkg of frozen lima beans, a can of stewed tomatoes and some wild rice.... might as well go all out on this one! I didn't have tomato sauce, so I threw in tomato juice instead! Very filling and flavorful! Add a salad and some crusty whole wheat rolls and you'll be full for DAYS!

I loved this soup and will make  again!  I had beef broth rather than vegetable broth and I threw in a can of Rotel tomatoes for a little spice.  It is really a hearty meal on a cold day, and so easy to throw it all in the crock pot.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This soup turned to mush after 11 hours in the crockpot.  I didn't make any adjustments to the recipe but adjustments are clearly needed.  There was not enough liquid and the soup looked nothing like the picture.  I will not be making this recipe again.

Took a lot less than 11 hours to cook this soup. I followed the recipe exactly and it's kinda bland. Will need to adjust the seasoning.

Very good, my husband and I both liked this soup. I used some of the recommendations suggested by others - used both tomato paste and tomato sauce. Didn't have diced tomatoes on hand so I put in some frozen green beans about 2 hours before eating. I also added extra lentils as suggested but then it seemed like too much in the end. I cooked mine on low for about 9 hours and the cook time was perfect, I used the light brown lentils.

I made this soup for company (I hadn't tried it prior to that) and everyone loved it. I thought it was very flavorful and perfect during the cold weather months. I doubled it and added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce.

This was amazing.  Used some of the mods mentioned by others: 1/2 c. more lentils, 1 can of stewed tomatoes as well as tomato sauce, and a ham shank instead of plain ham.  Absolutely delicious.  (Also, I always saute my onions, carrots, celery, and garlic before adding them to make sure to bring out all of the flavor possible.)

This is a great recipe! My family loved it. I added a can of stewed tomatoes as one other reviewer mentioned, mainly because I didn't have any tomato sauce. That's the only thing different I did and it came out perfect!

Yum! Yum! Yum! The best lentil and ham soup ever! Next time, I'll use the low-sodium broth as it was quite salty. My dh is not a big soup fan, and he really enjoyed this. Thank you for sharing!

Pretty good soup.  Would be nice to come home to on a cold day.  I used the leftover Thanksgiving ham bone along with the diced ham for extra rich flavor.

This soup was way too spicy for me.  I should have known just by reading the ingredients, but was swayed by the many good reviews.  If you like the subtle taste of lentils, this soup is not for you.  The flavor of the spices was overwhelming.  I was afraid I wasn't even going to be able to eat it and then the thought occurred to me to put a litttle sour cream on top.  That toned down the spices.  If I were to make this again, I would take the advice of the cook who said she left out all the spices and the soup was very good.  I can not recommend the recipe as written.

I read a lot of reviews of various lentil soup recipes throgh "All Recipes" - the reader reviews, in total, helped a lot. I modified a few different recipes for my own - I use the Rachel Ray "eyeball it" method, so it's hard to list specific amounts. The basics: sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil; poured about 4 quarts of (homemade, but any will work) chicken stock in. Tossed in a smoked pork hock and 2 cups lentils. Boiled then simmered for about an hour; added about 4 sliced carrots, 2 sliced celery stalks (no leaves), and a can of generic diced tomatoes (why buy more expensive when you're going to add your own seasonings?). Added tumeric (maybe 1 tbl?), curry (maybe 2 tbl?), and cumin (another tbl); probably 2 tsp. of tobasco; about 1 tbl. of salt (sea salt or kosher/coarse ground); and some coarse ground pepper. I let it simmer for another 20-30 min. What made it really good was adding lemon juice to the soup bowls at serving; sour cream is an okay addition but surely not needed. The end result was a very flavorful soup/stew with a kick (the Indian spices). A great evening meal with bread and tossed salad!

This soup is so good.  I couldn't even wait the 11 hours for it to cook, so I turned it up to high for a couple of hours and then down to low.  I too added a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  I also added hot pepper flakes, spinach and instead of ham used chicken garlic and artichoke sausages that I cut into pieces.  This is a keeper.  Thanks!!

I read many reviews before making this dish.  One person scared me a little by saying that she had to throw it away!  I decided to give this recipe a try anyways.  The ham in this soup, unfortunately, overpowers most of the other tastes.  I will probably try this again with more  spices ( preferably some hot ones!)and use less ham.  Maybe a combination of ham and chicken might be interesting.  What about substituting the ham for the chicken altogether?         This was a fair recipe that fills you up but greatly depends on taste.  If you love ham, go for it!  If not, try to tone it down a little,...

I also cooked it in the slowcooker for a total of twelve hours to make sure that the lentils were well done.

I really like this soup it had an interesting flavor and lentils are very underutilized in our culture. They are so cheap and packed with fiber and vitamins. The color was a little funny but the taste was great. I did add some garbanzo beans and some wocerstershire sauce also a tiny bit of brown sugar and tossed in a few shakes of hot pepper sauce. Very yummy with home made bread and even better reheated the next day

Very good soup and only 6 Smart Points if  you're following Weight Watchers. One mistake I did make was to add salt while cooking it. I love salt and since someone said it lacked it, so I added it. Big mistake.

Didn't change a thing and it tasted great! Easy to fix and cooked all day and into the night so I had it the next day. Didn't even add salt, there seemed to be enough in the chicken broth.

Great Recipe. Absolutely loved it. I stuck to the recipe, with the exception of adding an extra half cup of lentils and an extra 8 oz of chicken broth. I used low sodium chicken broth.  It's pretty thick, and perfect for a cold day.

This was very hearty and tasty. I made exactly as written except I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce, and used some vey meaty ham shanks with the bones still in. I soaked the lentils for a couple of hours and then prepared everything in the crockpot bowl the night before so that it was ready to start cooking in the morning. Cooked for 9 hours and came out a perfect consistency. I don't think I'll add oregano next time, as I'm not much of a fan of it in my old age. :)

I made this recipe and took some oft repeated advice from several reviews and added a whole small can of tomato sauce (rather than the few tsp's that the recipe called for),and a can of diced tomatoes (undrained).  The extra fluid helped because the lentils really absorb alot of the juice and I ended up adding some beef broth the last hour of cooking.  I'm not sure what went wrong with some of the people who gave bad reviews to this recipe, but I found it to be a fantastic recipe and with the few tweaks I mentioned, it will be my go-to ham and lentil soup recipe.

Added a can of diced tomatoes to it as suggested in other reviews. Also ended up using an entire 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of 8 tsps. Next time I would add a bit more black pepper and probably some cayenne to give it some spice. Very good!

Add more lentils. Don't need cook 9-10 hrs. Add more water and chicken or vegetable stock.
Everyone seemed to like this dish.  I made night before to start first thing in the morning. Eat with cornbread!

Love this soup. In fact, I'm eating a bowl of it as we speak. A couple recommended modifications: 
1. Like a couple others, I added about 2x the amount of water suggested (2 cups instead of 1 for a 6 serving batch)...it's still plenty rich this way, and tastes more like a soup than a stew.
2. If you don't want to wait 11 hours to enjoy it, I cooked it on high for 4 hours, and then on low for another 2...seemed to do the trick. 

Let any leftovers sit in the slow cooker and cool down over night, then re-heat for lunch the next day...the leftovers will taste even better...

Delicious! I made this yesterday as per the directions, with the exception of using Italian Seasoning in place of the individual herbs and also using a can of diced tomatoes (salt free) in place of the tomato sauce. I didn't add salt because I've heard that adding it in the beginning can make the lentils tough (hence the salt free tomatoes) and boy am I glad that I didn't. It is VERY salty just from the ham, and trust me I love me some salt. Just be mindful of this and your soup will turn out delicious too :)

Tasted perfect.  I slow cooked it on high for 4 hours and the lentils were perfectly soft.  I also replaced the tomato sauce with diced tomatoes....they added some "meat" to the dish.

Great one!! I just added less lentils(1/2 cup) and less pepper. Also I added the bone of the ham for the flavor..Even my 8 year old love it !! Oh, and I cooked it in 1 hour on a regular saucepan. No need to wait that long for something so good..

I made this for the first time yesterday and boy was it delicious! It was pretty simple and quick to make. My crock pot was too small so I actually cooked it on the stove on low for around 3 hours. It probably would have been even better in the slow cooker. It was a extremely filling and kept me full for longer than most soup dishes can. This will definitely be one of our regular dishes.

For years I've WANTED to like lentil soup but have not been able to . . .  until I found this recipe!  Thank you, queendiva1, for giving me a lentil soup recipe that I and my family love!  And, could it be any easier?  Holy cow!  I did substitute the tomato sauce with a can of diced tomatoes and I used two cups of ham.  I've already passed the recipe on . . . (Oh, and the left overs are even better!!)

First lentil soup for me and it turned out great.  

Soup Consistency: I was concerned about others comments saying it was mush and not enough liquid so I cooked on low in crock pot for 8 hrs...it was plenty cooked and had the perfect amount of liquid.  Great mix of lentils, ham, and veggies.  

Soup Flavor:  I like lots of flavor and saw comments about some saying it was a bit bland.  So I doubled the seasonings listed and also added some ground hot pepper to give it a little kick.  

I definitely modified the seasonings to my taste but it is a good base recipe that I've already made twice!

One of the best slow cooker soups on All Recipes.  This is one of my favorite "comfort" soups not only because it tastes great, it's also very easy to make!  Even my husband loves it and he is not a soup eater.

I'm sorry - this was okay but not wonderful- a little bland for our tastes.  I agree about the lentils cooking down to mush & I only cooked it for about 10 hours.  I made the recipe pretty spot on, only adding some diced potatoes and shredded cabbage the last hour.  This was not a favorite so I don't think I'll make it again.

What is better than a really great recipe? One that is easy to make! We really enjoyed this soup. I did cook it with a ham bone overnight for 11 hours and reheated for dinner that night. Next time I will add more lentils (if you are a ham lover you might want to add more). BTW-There was plenty of liquid in this soup.

We loved this soup.  It was really easy to make and tasted wonderful on a cold winter day.  I used 1.5 cups lentils, left out the bay leaf and replaced the tomato sauce with a can of diced tomatoes.  I cooked it on low for 3 hours and then turned it to high for 3 hours and it was perfect.

I made (a double recipe) of this soup but I put in a meaty ham bone and about 2 cups of ham (large chunks). After 7 1/2 hours it was quite tasteless. Most of the flavor was gone from the ham so I fished out all the meat and the hambone (I had planned to replace it with fresher ham for the last hour of cooking). Then I added 4 more cloves of garlic, 2 tsp. of liquid smoke, and 4 chicken bullion cubes. After 2 1/2 more hours it was MUCH better. Then I added the 3 cups of diced ham for the final hour. Now we have a good soup.

This was very flavorful, easy, and most of all healthy.  I subbed the Italian seasoning for the oregano, etc. because it was what I had on hand.  I also subbed a can of stewed tomatoes in for the tomato sauce as others suggested.  I did add a little bit of salt prior to eating but I used no added salt canned products.  I will keep this in my rotation to use up leftover ham after holidays.

Amazing! I am always looking for a way to use leftovers. I doubled the recipe, but used 32oz dark, rich chicken stock instead of doubling the chicken broth, covered with water, and it was perfect! A lot of leftovers to freeze for busy days!

I added stewed tomatoes like everyone recommended and cooked it for 11 hours on low in my new slow cooker and the lentils were still not soft. Had no idea what 'American' lentil to use so I used the green 'French' variety. I added boiled chicken breast as a substitute to the ham and took precaution to do everything right. But comming from the richly flavored foods of my own 'cajun' culture in the East, this soup really was not flavorful and lacked texture. My mom makes the best lentil soup in St. Louis and I was hoping it would taste at least a little reminiscent of her cooking. I wish I halved the recipe. Now I have all this soup my family and I will struggle to finish. Never again will I trust a 4.5 star review this lovingly. I wonder if the tomato sauce would have been better then the stewed tomatoes. I hate being a 1st generation cook! lol

We found this to be absolutely delicious! Hubby asked for it to be put in his lunch for two days after we ate it for dinner. Made as directed and will now be in my fall/winter soup recipe cycle.

This was yummy! I prepped the meat and veggies the night before and put the dry ingredients in the crock pot. In the morning I added the stuff from the fridge, tomato paste (instead of sauce), and water (I used chicken broth base instead of chicken broth). I only used 3/4 cup lentils because I didn't want the soup to be too thick (based on previous reviews). I also added cinnamon because I like it in lentil soups. I don't know how much my men liked it, but they ate it without complaint (although not enthusiastically). I thought it was awesome and would definitely make it again.

This soup is fantastic! I didn't have 11 hours to cook it so I cooked it on high setting for 6 hours. It turned out great and reminded us of the lentil soup served at our favorite German restaurant.

This was GREAT. My husband raved about and that is rare. I used a ham bone that still had lots of meat on it and put that in the crock pot at about 9 a.m.on high. Then at noon I added everything listed in the recipe plus a can of stewed tomatoes and sloshed in some white wine. I let that cook on low for six hours and it really turned out wonderfully. Thanks.

I have to admit I am a tweaker--I mess with recipes and rarely follow them exactly.  For the first time ever (and I mean that here) I followed an AllRecipe's recipe to the letter and this was definately great without my messing with it. I do a soulp every Sunday while the reall dinner is cooking--then I have something all done and ready to eat off of for hectic Monday nights and lunch for me to take to work the rest of the week.  This was perfect as far as my hubby and teen were concerned tho just a tiny bit bland for me..I added a sprinkle of Penzey's "Black and Red" on top of mine....that's a blend or cayenne and black telicherry in the same jar.  Definately a keeper, tho I may not be able to resist messin' with it next time.  It was agreat use for the leftover ham we had int he freezer from the christmas beast.  Served it Monday with a baguette I grabbed on the way home and had it again with some cheese and triscuits for lunch a couple times at work.  It was definately better for having sat overnight.  Thanks for a solid additon to my soup rotation.

this was really good.  i did have to add about 2 cups more of chicken broth to the recipe.  also, i think next time i will use more ham and a bit less onion (even though i LOVE onions, it was a bit much).  lastly, my lentils were not done after 11 hours.  i chilled the soup overnight and slow cooked again the next day on high, and they were still pretty firm.  maybe i should pre-cook them a bit next time.  other than that, i would love to try variations of this soup.  same base ingredients, swap ham for chicken and swap lentils for noodles.  thanks so much for the recipe.  the seasoning and veggies were amazing!

If you really like split pea and ham soup, you would love this. I thought that this recipe was OK, I have to say I wasn't that impressed though. My husband didn't prefer it although I didn't mind it. I just thought that it was a little bland. I added a little extra ham. I might make this again

I made this soup this morning with a leftover Easter hambone and ham. Left out the chicken broth and substituted water because I thought it would be too salty but added a can of diced tomatoes. It came out perfect; IMHO, it does not need the chicken broth unless your taste buds need the salt.

This is what I call comfort food to the max ! Just plain good stuff ! And for me - the spicier the better - so, added lots of extra garlic, some onion powder and my Christmas hambone that has been waiting in my freezer for just the right time !

I think next time I'll grate some cheese over the top of each serving... 

This was a complete meal with croissants and butter after my hungry husband and daughter came home from shooting practice in the cold - YUMMMM !

This was excellent and very easy.  I cut up all of the ingredients the night before so all I had to do was throw everything into the slow cooker in the morning and it was ready when I got home!  I did use tomato paste and a little water since I couldn't see the point of opening a whole can of tomato sauce for 8 tsp.  I also did make a slurry with some of the broth and cornstarch to make it a little thicker (it was originally a bit thin for my taste), which helped give it some more body.  I did add more of the herbs/spices than the recipe called for and I did also add some lemon juice and hot sauce right at the end for a little kick.  But it was still very easy and good!

My husband had 2 bowls!!  I on the other hand had half a bowl because the ham & broth made it too salty for me.  Next time I'll reduce the broth and add water.  Otherwise, it was delicious.

This was excellent!  Made it exactly except we added a bit more water and a can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce, per some of the other suggestions. It was a delicious, flavorful and healthy supper for my family which I made in the crockpot and simmered all day while I was at work.  Thanks for a winner!

Okay. I didn't care for the spices--especially the bay leaf, but I did like the easiness of this recipe. Next time I'll use cumin, tumeric, curry, red pepper flakes instead of the orgegano, thyme, basil, bay leaf. This soup is fine without the meat for a healthier alternative.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe with only minor changes, based on availability, re:  49 oz can of broth; no water; one-half bag fresh spinach, chopped; one can stewed tomatoes with liquid, chopped.  I actually didn't add any of the spices.  The soup was flavorful without. I did use homemade leftover spicy marina for the tomato sauce.  Served with Cabot Garlic and Herb Cheese and Ecci Panis Focaccia Rolls (from WalMart!).  Crusty on the outside; chewy on the inside.  Served with Italian Butter herbs in EVOO.

This is really good.  Much better than other lentil soups I have tried.  Made it last night because I needed to fix something with what I had on hand.  Found a couple small pieces of leftover ham in the freezer and some lentils and used my dutch oven.  Started with a pot of water on the stove(like I usually would for soup) and used 4 chicken bouillion cubes instead of the broth.  Didn't have any tomato sauce so I added a bit of salsa.  An hour later, oh boy, good soup!

Phenomenal! I pretty much followed the recipe except I doubled the spices, added a can of garbanzo beans, about 2 c of diced ham and a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. Super easy and super good! I'll be making this all winter.

The ONLY change I made was I used just a pinch of thyme the second time around.  I thought the thyme was overbearing even though it was 1/4 tsp.  I can see that stewed or diced tomatoes would enhance this soup (stew)  It is a comfort soup at it's finest!

This was a perfect use of leftover ham from Easter. I added lots more meat and also threw the hambone into the crockpot too. But all the other specs on this recipe are perfect. It agreed with my digestion, and that's HUGE!!!

I made this per the recipe (but only cooked for 7 hours and used Mirepoix) and it was more like a stew, so I served it over Jasmine rice with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt.  Delicious, healthy and hearty.  Served with wheat bread. So good on this rainy, cool April evening.  I will be making this again!

This was yummy. I added a few potatoes and cabbage. Based on the other reviews I did increase the broth and the additional water. I added a little chicken bouillon and a little crushed red pepper for a hint of spice. I don't think 11 hours is needed for the cooking time. The soup freezes well. I separated the left over into lunch size portions. It reheats well. I'm making it again just to create freezer lunches to have on hand. It was incredibly easy to make.

This is now a regular in rotation.
This is one of my favorite dishes and this recipe makes it much simpler than others I have tried. The only problem with this recipe is that my family loves it so much I need to double or triple the recipe. I sometimes will mix the lentils with split peas. Freezes beautifully.  Perfect fall, football food. Very filling.
 It is simply WONDERFUL.

I have made this three times now.  It has gone over well with the whole family including a two and seven year old.    I have always added in a ham bone.  Cook the whole thing overnight and all day in a slow cooker on low, bumping up to high towards the end.  I recommend doubling because you will want leftovers and it freezes well too.  Cornbread is a good side.

This is a great recipe! In order to make it vegetarian-friendly, I replaced the ham for 2 cups of green peas. I also doubled the amount suggested of basil, thyme, and oregano, using 1 teaspoon, 1/2 teaspoon, and 1 teaspoon, respectively. Last but not least, I limited the cooking time to 10 hours on low.

I very much enjoyed it. Thick, hearty and satisfying. I used 1.5 cups of lentils and substituted one can of diced tomatoes for the sauce. Omitted the celery and added more carrot. Also added 2 more cloves of garlic.  It does take full 11 to cook. I will definitely be making it again soon.

I also used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and did not add any extra water and did not find it to be too thick. I do however think it could use more flavor...maybe chili powder? Overall I was very happy with the recipe. Quick and easy preparation. Perfect for a cold day.

I am baffled at the few review saying this did not taste good. We made it exactly as the recipe states except adding one can of stewed tomatoes. It was absolutely yummy!!! We will definitely make it again! Im so glad I went with the majority!

Have made this many times. It is my go to recipe for Lentil soup. Everyone who has tried it loves it too. I use left over ham or an individual ham steak and cut it up. Great in this cold Northeast winter.  I do usually cook it in my Dutch oven though. Like to stir the pot!

I made this for dinner and YUM! It was so good even my children devoured it. The only thing I did different was added two chopped potatoes. It was so easy to throw in the crock pot and I was able to use up some left over ham I had in the fridge.

I've made this recipe LOTS! Originally tried something similar in Oregon while on travel. It is truly comfort food, I use a 7 qt. crockpot, and more than double the ingredients. I throw in lots of veggies and cubed ham, and extra tomato sauce to make a stoup (stew/soup). This is a great recipe, and as you make it more, tweak the ingredients to taste.

Yum, this was wonderful.  I made a double batch because I have been sick all week, and this sounded so good. Plus that way we have leftovers for tonight, so I don't have to cook.  I did not measure out the tomato sauce though, I just used a 8 oz can, and it worked great.

This is delicious!  We have made it several times, using different meats each time.  We have made it with chicken, kielbasa sausage, and ham.  The ham was the overall favorite, but all ways are good.  This is a weekly meal for us during the winter.  Love how easy it was.

This was pretty good. I made it to use ingredients I had on hand, switching to lentils because I was out of split peas and I wanted a slow cooked soup for this ridiculously frigid day. As usual, I halved the recipe for my family of two. I had a ham hock, but I think we'd prefer it better with just the diced ham, as I got no meat off the bone, and the ham flavor was intense, but not satisying. I had a little ham, so I threw that in. Like others, I added about 1/3 c. of barley and about 1/2c. more water at the eight hour mark because we like it and it added nutrition, and I mixed about two ounces of water into about four ounces of leftover four cheese marinara I had on hand and used that instead of the tomato sauce. I served it with some cornbread, and we liked it well enough for a cold day. We liked the healthy amount of veg and the protein rich lentils and barley, but it would have been way too thin without the barley. If I try this again, I will keep the barley, add more lentils and use veg stock to make it lent friendly. Thanks to all for the helpful reviews and suggestions.

This soup is very good! I make it with a can of chopped stewed tomatoes and add about 3/4 cup of barley to the mix. I make it without the ham and with vegetable broth as I have a couple of vegetarian kids and it is still very tasty. I just add ham to the soup for those of us who like and eat meat. It has become a regular at our house.  Thank you for an easy, nutritious and economical recipe that makes a soup that is wonderful to come home to after work on a winter's day!

It was 5 degrees here in Colorado today and this soup was the BEST relief! I made a shank ham for Thanksgiving the week before and used the bone as well as some cut up pieces from it and also cut up about a cup and a half of red potatoes and used a chicken bouillon instead of the stock. It turned out fabulous! It made so much that I have another two dinners out of it that I am going to freeze. GREAT!

I followed this recipe to the "T" except 3 small changes: I used two mild Italian sausage in link-form that I seared/browned on the sides for about 10 minutes total (I didn't have ham), I used an ADDITIONAL 1/2 teaspoon of herbs de provance, and I did not use the tomato sauce. about 3 hours into the simmer (Ooops my crock pot is on steroids) I realized something was missing. I added a tablespoon (maybe a touch more) of white vinegar. AMAZING!  I didn't want to open an entire can of sauce so I used the vinegar instead and it was fabulous! I also added about 2 tsp salt since I wasn't using ham and I used LOW SODIUM broth. 
NOTES: at a simmer lentils are done in 3-4 hours BUT the beautiful flavors of this simple recipe are NOT ready for at least 8 hours.  The 4 hour and 8 hour mark were substantially different, the best being 10 hours BUT the salt was too much, next time I will only add a teaspoon. 
For the recipes that failed, maybe people just don't like lentils OR they did not use a heavily seasoned meat.  You cannot use pork roast, or pot roast or hamburger etc, UNLESS you are going to heavily flavor that meat with spices and browning. This would be a completely bland recipe if one did not use ham, sausage, etc. 
I am embarrassed to say I can't stop eating it!

This is definitely a comfort food recipe!  We made it for a post St Patty's Day parade party.  We loaded the raw ingredients in the crock pot the night before, placed it in the fridge, and pulled it out bright and early the following morning to cook.  After 11 hours on low, and it was perfect!  We doubled the recipe which filled our 6 qt crock pot just to the rim.  Delicious!!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. I did cook in my crockpot for 9 hours. I also used a can of stewed tomatos instead of the tomato sauce.  This is definetely a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I don't typically make a lot of soups so when I say this was super easy, I'm not lying. I will say I made it per the recipe the first time and the next played, adding more of the veggies listed as well as some leeks I had left over, upped the broth and lentil amount to make it not quite so dense and omitted the tomato paste both times. EXCELLENT base to play around with or as written, thanks!

So yummy! I have tried a few lentil soup recipes from this site, and this one is by far the best!! I didn't have tomato paste, so I omitted the water too and just added about a cup of marinara sauce. My husband who doesn't like soup kept coming back for more!

I made the soup with one can of diced tomatoes w garlic and peppers instead of tomato sauce. I didn't have celery. It was declicous and I would definitely use some leftover ham for this again!  I might add some more lentils. I cooked it on high for 5 hours- because I started late.  It could have used less time on high because the lentils were mushy.  Flavor was wonderful.  Will be repeating.

LOVED this!  Easy to make.  Cooked it for the full 11 hours.  The flavors blended SO well and the beans were not mushy at all.  Will definitely make it again and again.  My husband complimented his bowl with a big fat corn muffin!  It was a great meal to break in the new slow cooker!

Just walked into the best smelling kitchen! This is an great recipe that is so easy to make. I didn't have enough lentils so I added some split peas. I also put in the ham bone with ham on it from our Christmas dinner. Will pass this recipe on to others!

This recipe was great! Dinner time is usually a battle w/at least one of my kids and BOTH ate this and asked for seconds! I will definitely be making this again! I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce as others had suggested. Other than that I just followed the recipe!

i liked it, but some of my beans didn't cook-still hard. i purred some of the soup, and tossed back into the pot to thicken broth. i also added a spicey smoked sausage instead of ham. flavour was great but the hard beans kinda ruinned it a little. 
i found out what i did wrong i used a split pea and lentil mixture. split peas need to sit over night. i made this recipe again using only lentils and it turned out just fine.

Just made this again for the 5th time. We love it. I usually add a can of diced tomotoes instead of the sauce.  I always make it when I have a ham bone and just add in some extra diced up ham. PERFECT!!

I added stewed tomatoes also after reading the other's comments.  In addition to the tomato sauce.  I actually put in Italian tomatoes, which I think put in a bit too much Italian flavor--basil, etc., but this is still a good, hearty soup that was great to use up leftover ham with.

I kept forgetting to make this and finally I decided I would try it in the pressure coker (to make up for the lack of time)  I followed the recipe as far as the ingredients, I added a touch of canola oil to the pressure cooker and sauted the onion, carrots an celery just a few min. then added the remaining ingredients and brought it to a boil. I cooked it on the#1 setting on the pressure cooker for 20 min and it tastese great!  The lentils may be slightly over cooked but that was because I was not sure how long to cook them in the pressure cooker.  I will make this again maybe 15-18 min. in the pressure cooker next time!

I read the reviews, and was expecting a really great soup, and it was dreadful!  It was so salty it was nearly inedible.  I added water at serving just so we could choke it down.  Any recommendations for improving it?  I used chicken soup base and water instead of chicken stock, and precubed ham.  Next time I might try with low sodium chicken broth and leftover ham from a whole ham.

This was delicious!  So easy to make, and getting home and walking into that amazing smell was wonderful.  I love veggies - so I just added a bit more of everything to the recipe, and I couldn't find dried lentils at trader Joes, so I used already cooked lentils - but it was perfect nonetheless!!

I also had to toss the whole pot - the basil overwhelmed everything and it was very watery.  I cooked it forever - totatlly inedible.  I don't know what went wrong.

Easy to prepare. I used scallions in place of onion. It was the first lentil recipe that I loved!

This is excellent.  Did add turkey sausage (kielbasa) in lieu of the ham.  Very hearty on a cold day.

This is an excellent stew! Hearty, tasty and filling. I used cooked ham, and I think the stew was a bit on the salty side because of it. Next time I will try to find a pork hock as suggested.

Good recipe and so easy.  I will make it again.  We don't like spices so I left them and the tomato sauce out.  We ate it with French bread, it was great for a cool Fall evening after watching an outdoor sporting event.

I thought this was great! I followed the directions exactly except I left out the celery. It actually cooked for about 13 hours because I was gone all day but it turned out perfectly. I used reduced sodium chicken broth and no salt added tomato sauce as ham can be pretty salty on its own. I'll definitely be having this again - especially when the weather cools down.

Yummy!  Like most people, I did some subbing of my my own based on what I had available.  I used veggie broth instead of chicken and bell peppers instead of celery.  Not a big fan of celery.  What I love about this recipe is that you can probably sub any of your favorite veggies for the ones listed here.  Most of the flavor is from the ham, broth, and lentils.  I also only used 1/2 the onions and added a small potato.  Very delicious.  Didn't have 11 hours before dinner, so I cooked it on high for 3 hours and then 5 hours on low.  (1 hour on high = 2 hours on low).  I think the combination cooking times worked just fine.  I tasted the soup after the 3 hours of high cooking and it tasted fine, just a bit thin, like a regular veggie soup.  After 5 more hours on low, it was much thicker, getting closer to a chili consistency.  I used Fresh & Easy lentils that said no soaking required.  I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars b/c it still felt like it was lacking something in flavor.  Maybe adding a little cayenne at the end or using a red/black pepper combo would've helped.  Otherwise good recipe as is.

Tasty, but way too thin for me. I felt like it could use more than just a cup of lentils.

This is going in my favorite soups folder. Mmm mmm good! The smokiness of the ham married really well with the seasoning and lentils. I increased the thyme to 1/2 tsp. To reduce the sodium in this recipe, I only used 2 cups broth and the rest water. The salty ham added a lot to the flavor.

Eerything I had hoped for out of this recipe - delicious, easy, versatile, filling, inexpensive, and very little "hands on" time.  Thank you!!  I added one smallish potato, cubed.

6/17/10 - I had to review this again because it is SO good!  This time I served it with a little crumbed feta cheese on top, and that was like the icing on the cake!  Took it from delicious to outstanding!!  Thank you for such a solid repeat recipe.

WOW -- This soup is awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I doubled the qty), and absolutely love it.  Perfectly seasoned, just enough salt from the ham (don't add any extra salt!!), and nice thickness.  Great to freeze and take to work for lunch.  I totally don't understand the bad reviews, unless those people just hate lentils.  And if that's the case, why would you even try this?

Loved this soup.  So easy to make.  Based on other reviews I added 48oz of chicken broth and increased veggies. I also switched the sauce to 1 can of diced tomatoes.  It was not too thick at all and everyone loved it.

This was awesome!  I've never had lentils before but they were great, especially with all the seasonings!  I read the reviews of is being too much seasoning.  I have to disagree with that though.  I used chicken instead of ham, added diced potatoes, and about a cup more of water.  I wish I'd added more lentils!  Tomatoes would probably be nice too!  Def a keeper!

This wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  I guess I didn't realize how tomato-ey it was going to be.  However, it still turned out tasty. I took the reviewer's suggestion of adding an entire 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of 8 tsps.  Not only was it really tomatoey, but the end result was thin enough to warrant putting the mixture in the blender to achieve desired thickness.  I think if I cut back to the original recipe requirements, I may not have this problem.

Can't go wrong with lentil soup in the slow cooker!  Substituted a ham hock for the ham, and used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.

Way over herbed & vegetables were relatively raw after 11 hours on low.  Had to pour in an entire small can of tomato sauce & a cup of red wine to dilute strong herb taste. That made it edible (barely) rather than wasting the time & $$ on ingredients , then trowing it out. Recipe sounded good, but I did not care for it!

Very Good. I used an extra carrot and celery stick just because I like them. I could have added more. I also used reduced sodium broth but still thought it was a bit salty for me so I added a cup of water half way through cooking. I saved this one and will use again. Thanks so much.

Delicious base recipe, but cooking time seems excessive for lentils. Here is how I altered it to make it 5 stars: I make my own broth; this time it was all my leftover veggies with 2 smoked hamhocks. Slowcooked for 12 hours, tossed the meat and veggies, refrigerated the broth overnight, then skimmed off the fat before starting this recipe proper! I wanted more of a 'ham and bean' flavored soup, so I did not add the recipe spices, onions or tomato of any kind and doubled the minced garlic. Slowcooked it on high for 1 hour, then low for 2 hours and it was perfect. The homemade broth is really the key, I have a batch going all the time and freeze it for when I need soupbase. (This broth featured hamhocks with garlic, green onions tips, celery and bok choy bases, stems from cilantro and dill and carrot tops. I save all my veggie stems, tops, skins and other un-eatables in a freezer bag; when its time to make broth, into the crockpot they go.) This was the very first time I made lentils and hubby ate them up! Thanks for gettin' me going'!

fantastic and easy. i set the slow cooker on low for 11 hours one night, went to sleep, and when i woke up it was done and ready for me to package up to bring to work for lunch. Coworkers were impressed by my lean, low sodium, hearty soup. i double the recipe and only used one bullion. i also found a lean peice of ham that was 1cm thick perfect amount, no frying neccessary. Adding STEWED TOMATOES is a MUST!

Perhaps it was our ham but after cooking for 11 hrs it was really dry and flavorless. The rest of the soup was really good though.

This soup is very tasty.  The best part is that you get to use up whatever veggies you've been saving in your freezer from leftovers.  I added rice and it was phenomenal.  Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe! I ended up finding this late in the day and wwanting it for dinner, so I made it on the stove top and simmered for about 35 mins total. The herbs were a perfect compliment to the veggies and lentils. I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and 16 oz chicken broth and the rest water, because I don't like too much salt. All in all it was great. Next time I will make in the crock pot.

Absolutely delicious.  Used smoked ham shank instead of regular ham.  Cooked it on low for only 6 hours.  I made no other changes.  It will certainly be filed under favorite soups.

How easy was this!! Next time I will chop the veggies the night before to save some time as I'm always tight for it in the morning but the flavor was excellent and it the lentils were a perfect consistency. Very nice fall and winter dish, so nice to come home from work and enjoy this hearty meal instantly.

This is my favorite! I do a little bit of variation though. I up the veggies and ham about 1/2 cup each. I use 3 small cans of chicken stock fatfree/low sodium, and add one can of diced tomatoes, and leave out the tomatoe sauce. It is wonderful, I also cook it on high in my crockpot for about 3 hours depending on the lentils... a little longer if neccessary.

Hi everyone! Thanks for all the good reviews! I'm glad that most of you are enjoying one of my favorite soups! Of course it is the nature of the beast to continue to tweak recipes and I thought I would share a slightly different stovetop version of this recipe. I didn't have any ham but threw in 2 smoked pork hocks (skin removed) and 2 cups of cooked, diced chicken meat from my freezer. I covered the pot and simmered this on the stovetop for about 1 1/2-2 hrs until everything was tender. Removed the pork hocks and picked what little meat there is and tossed that into the soup. You may need to add a little extra broth or water when you cook it stovetop. This makes it a little quicker if you don't have half a day to get dinner on the table.

I used this as the basis for a recipe in which I used pork necks rather than ham.  I didn't use a slow cooker - I just cooked at low heat for 4-5 hours, until meat fell off of necks, and them removed the bones.  Kept everything else the same.  It was awesome! Even my steak-and-potatoes husband loved it, and it is now a regular at our house.

This made a delicious and satisfying soup.  I did add about an additional half cup of lentils, because that used them up. I will probably add at least one more clove of garlic next time.

I too added the whole can of tomato sauce, but omitted the water. I ended up adding some more water when I reheated it the next day. Very good soup, would probably try again without the ham too!

I love this recipe! I have made it several times now, and it has come out great every time. The only changes I've made are substituting turkey bacon for the ham and adding crushed bay leaves instead of a whole one. It always come out perfect!

Very good flavor. I used turkey keilbasa instead of ham. I made the mistake of not cooking it long enough- only about 8 hours and the lentils were still crunchy and the soup was thin and watery. I put it back on the stove the next day on low for 2 hours and it thickened up nicely and the lentils were perfect. I will make this again and will be sure to give it enough time!

YUM, this was great and healthy!!  I used a 28ou can of stewed tomatoes and enough chicken broth to cover (not sure how much it ended up being).  I also added 3 smoked ham hocks, which I think really upped the flavor on this.  I cooked on high for 5 hours.  I know you're not supposed to take the cover off a slow cooker but I noticed the liquid seemed low, so I added about 1 cup of water maybe in the last hour.  I also added the dried spices at that time, which is what I always do.  I will definitely be making this all winter!

Used advise of many. Cooking for 6, used 1/2 of carrots, only 2 cans of chicken broth, one 14oz can of diced tomatoes and skipped the water.  Made a much thicker, tastier soup fit for a king and a small court.

This recipe is great! I used a ham bone like some suggested as well as the stewed tomatoes instead of the tomatoe sauce. I also added some tomatoe paste and 2 1/2 cups more water, instead of the broth (I was afraid it would be to salty, and was right). I also added some collard greens a couple of hours before it was done. Topped off with a splash of vinegar and a squeeze of lemon juice and it was devine! I would definately make this again.

Loved this recipe and so did my husband. I didn't use teh celery so it wouldn't get mushy and I added more tomato sauce and ham to bulk it up a bit. Truly a fantastic soup that I ate for days afterward. Only needed to cook in my crock pot for 8 hours.

Pretty tasty! I had simmered a ham bone the day before and used the simmering liquid with some low sodium bullion in place of the chicken stock and cooked it in the crock pot on high for 5 hours. The ingredients are inexpensive so if you follow the recipe, you can't go wrong for a hearty, healthy and delicious soup.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was an awesome way to use a ham bone!  Next time I make it I will cut back a little on the oregano for a better balance of spices.  I also added 3 Tablespoons of balsamic vinegar which sent the flavor meter over the top!!!  Excellent.

Out of lentils--used yellow splitpeas--used ham bone with plenty of meat on it. Slow cooked all day. Came out thick and hearty! Will try it with lentils next time.

Eh, this was just okay. The long cooking time semed to make the ham kind of tough and lose its flavor (and it was a really good ham too). Everyone ate this, but the leftovers sat untouched in the fridge for a few days before I tossed them. Won't be making this again.

Loved! I too did not have celery, so I omitted it. I used the entire package of lentils, a 14 oz can of tomato sauce, and a big box of organic low salt chicken broth. I did not add salt per other reviews and found it did not need any due to the ham.  Prior to serving I added some grated romano cheese and some cooked elbow macaroni and some of the water from the cooked pasta to thin the lentils a bit. Delicious!

Delicious flavor.  It was not an appetizing color or texture, so I couldn't in good faith give it five stars.  My slow cooker dried this out and I had to add another cup and a half of broth to serve.  Low sodium is the way to go!

This was much too salty for us.  Other than that point, I think it definitely has potential.  Next time I try this, I'll definitely use low-sodium chicken broth.

Mmmmmmm so good. My whole family gobbled it up. I did increase the chicken broth, but only because I had on big can of it (48 oz I think). It turned out perfect. It even reheated well the next day.

I cooked it for 4 hours on high, and then gave it one hour on low until dinner time. Perfect!

My only ingredient change was that I added a little chili powder (because I read that it might need a little kick and I like spicy food). That was my only mistake- tasted great, but the chili powder was unnecessary (actually detracted). Leave it alone.

I did this in the slow cooker for 4 hours and 10 hours. I will review both. ***4 HOURS on high*** this came out like the photo. It was soupy and yummy, nothing wrong here. Light meal. ***10 HOURS on low***no liquid left, flavorful but closer to a mashed potatoe ordeal. Heavy meal. ***VERDICT*** would do it for 4 hours on high next time. As it makes for a lighter meal and yields more.

I used 2 cups of lentils and used stewed tomatoes, but all of the rest was as per the recipe.  I thought it was good but I've had better.   I also threw everything in the crockpot and cooked for  about 4 hours.

This was very tasty.  I increased the thyme. Added a lot of black pepper. I also did what others suggested and put it on high for (4) hrs.  I did have to add chicken broth so it would not be a "stew".  My husband loved it.  I will be making this again. Hope it freezes well.

I would have given  5 stars, but I changed the recipe in three ways.  Then it became a five star dish.  First I put a leftover ham bone in with the lentils for a couple of hours before adding all the other ingredients.  Second, I sauteed the onions, some shallots and celery before adding to soup.  Lastly, I added homemade tomato paste.  This was five  stars and will make again with other beans.

Very good!   We wanted to make split pea but only had lentils.  I'll definitely be making this again though.  We had all the spices, but substituted celery with broccoli and cauliflower leaves and whole cherry tomatoes for the tomato sauce.  So this recipe does very well with substitutes.  Worked perfectly.  Thought about adding salt.  Glad we didn't since the ham was so salty.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe, using leftover brown sugar spiral ham, which gave it a nice sweet savory flavor. I also left out the water because my crock pot was maxed out! I will do this again!

So  tasty! Cook time adjustment - I started at noon with two hours of the  time on high.  It was delicious at 7:00. Maybe it would’ve been thicker had I cooked it 11 hours. Added a little more chicken broth toward  the end.  I will  use low sodium chicken broth if I had it next time due to the saltiness  of the ham. Thank you for sharing!

Only because I wanted to try something different, I used smoked sausage. I'll use ham the next time I make it, but it was good. Also, I used about a half cup of tomato sauce for more flavor.

11 hours too long on low! done in 6.5 hrs
doubled the ham, 2 lbs just right
added more celery. maybe more carrots next time.
maybe more water. pretty chunky like a stew. not a soup.
used 4 colors of lentils for visual appeal

I’ve made so many recipes from allrecipes and loved many of them but this is the first time I used my instant pot and tried this recipes! It was amazing! The only problem is I need to double it next time we ate almost all of it for dinner for two people. I followed everything exactly and it was perfect. Will make it every time we have Kirkland ham! Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy and easy soup. I reduced cooking time to 8 hours on low and used the entire can of tomato sauce. Next time I will use at least 2 cups of chopped ham.  One and a half cups was not enough. Excellent served with corn bread.

My husband and I loved this soup.  Based on the reviews, I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  I also did not have ham so used chicken sausage.  When it was done, I felt that there was not enough lentils so I cooked up another cup of lentils and added to soup.  Delicious and so easy!

This was just ok.  I knew there would be a problem as soon as I looked at the ratios of spices to the amount of the other ingredients.  I did extra on all the spices and it still was just ok.  I wouldn't make it again.

This is a great soup for a cold day. We had it for the first time last night, didn't add anything and it turned out so good we had 2nds. Also a great recipe for adding other veggies like tomato or potato, just to fill it in or to bulk it . Also, add whatever you want for flavor.  Lentils are kinda bland.

I keep trying to find a way to make lentils that my family will actually eat, and this was successful (except for the 7yo who doesn't like anything). I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the 8tsp of sauce, and it made it too salty for us. I still like the tomatoes but would use unsalted next time. It would be great with a sweet cornbread.

Yummy.  I made this soup with a smoked ham hock from the butcher and it was rich with flavor.  The only change I made to the recipe is I added to carrots & celery in the last 3 hours of cooking to ensure they weren't overcooked.  Will definitely be making this recipe again!

I didn't have tomato sauce so added paste and diced tomatoes instead. I added a ham bone and  a parmesan cheese rind and let it cook for 9 hours. Great tasting and comforting!

This soup was very filling and delicious. The only thing I did
differently was I added a can of crushed tomatoes. I enjoyed it with a side of cornbread, a puzzle and some music at my kitchen table.

This is really easy to make! and it tastes great. You know what?> Call me crazy, but I think this would make an interesting Manhattan Clam chowder. Substitute the ham with clam. mmmmmmmm

This soup is always a hit in our house.  I have made in my instant pot pressure cooker when I forgot or didn't have time in the morning.  Always amazing!  I usually never have ham though but since I'm polish I always make sure to have polish sausage in the freezer  so I add a pound of if (sliced). Delicious! Kids love it too!

Good. Added sliced potatoes and cayenne pepper.  Threw in a half ham. Cooked on high for four hours and the ham fell apart nicely. A good way to use up some ham and lentils.

I forgot to add in the carrots!! :( Oh well. It's still good. I was worried it would be bland but it's very flavorful... Almost too flavorful. I added in a can of crushed tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano already added in instead of tomato sauce because I wanted to bulk it up. I also used all chicken broth and no water. I think the next time I make this I will use the water and remember the carrots. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with this recipe. I ended up cooking it for the whole 11 hours because we had a situation come up and weren't able to eat until late. 

Update: As I'm typing this, my husband tells me it's really good and he really likes it! I have NEVER heard him say that about any soup!! So I guess I'll make it again the same exact way with all chicken broth but I am on the fence about the carrots now.... And so with that update, I bump the rating from like it, to love it. Because for a soup to get a compliment from.my husband is a BIG deal!!

This is my favorite slow cooker recipe, and the most delicious lentil soup. The recipe as written is perfect, but I add a little extra water and about half tsp of chili sauce.

Delicious flavor and texture as written, but I like to use up what's on-hand so: I used a can of diced tomato instead of the sauce, added a sweet potato, and increased the veggies,  lentils and water - no need to increase the seasoning.  Would have been very good with corn muffins, biscuits, or even over pasta.

I cooked my soup on high for about five hours but the lentils were very hard. I ended up having to dump everything into a big pot and boil the rest of it. I am sad and very disappointed. Does it really take 11 hours on low?

I make this all the time, it's very good and simple to make.  Wouldn't change anything about it except I add parmesan cheese on top when serving, gives it a little extra creaminess.

Has a great, rich, robust flavor. As others recommended, I doubled the amount of lentils, used a 15oz can of tomato sauce, and a 15oz can of diced tomatoes to boost the liquid content. Made this using my Express Crock slow cooker function and cooked it for the full 11 hours. Turned out delicious! Keeps well in the refrigerator.

Used can of stewed tomatoes & 2 cans of chicken broth and 1/4 cup water.  Consistency was good and it was a hit.  Good idea to use ham from a previous dinner.

My husband and I enjoyed this soup! I cooked it with a hambone plus a little more ham. I had no tomato sauce or canned tomatoes, so I added what I had in the pantry -- Ro-tel tomatoes! It was a little spicy, but not terribly so. I think next time I will add a few potatoes to this soup. Also, I cooked it on the stove rather than my slow cooker. The Ro-tel tomatoes might be too spicy when cooked for a long time!

This is a great recipe.  I used a can of stewed tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce and frozen beans from the garden in place of the lentils because that is what I had on hand.    No changes are needed AT ALL!

Easiest and most tasty soup ever! I used some frozen left over ham cubes from the holidays and pre-packed the lentils, spices, and vegetables in separate baggies. Rather than  chicken broth, I used powdered bouillon . I also used the diced tomatoes recommended. The morning of, it took about 2 minutes to layer the ham, veggies, lentils, spices, and cover  pour about 4 cups of water over it. I also omitted the smoke flavoring and used Bragg's amino acid flavoring in place of the Worcestershire sauce. My daughter who is not a 'soup person' enjoyed it. There are left overs for two to three more meals, so  it is cost effective. Definitely a hit served with cornbread:)

I will make this again!  When I make soup, it is usually a full pot. I like to share with others and freeze some for later.
This recipe makes a smaller quantity. Perfect for 4-5 servings.
I doubled the tomato sauce.
Increased the amount of ham.
Additional 2c of chicken broth

Cooked on low in a slow cooker over night,  then added the ham in the morning and increased to high for another 2hr.

This soup had a wonderful flavor.  Instead of using my crock pot, I simmered on the stove for about 4 hours.  I used one cup of "15 bean soup" bean packet which really added variety to the soup.  Great soup that I will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This recipe was super easy to make and I think will reheat well.  I'm so used to cooking vegetarian soups that often need extra flavor, so I used 5 cups broth instead of 4 cups broth and one cup water which was a mistake, it was too salty.  Might do 3.5 cups broth and 1.5 cups water next time.  Otherwise no changes for next time. 

Oh, I didn't have tomato sauce but I had paste, so I did 6 tsp paste instead of 8 tsp sauce and that worked out fine.

UPDATE: Made a second time with 4 cups broth, only had 1 c of ham so added extra veggies.  Was done cooking after 4 hr on low, at 11 hr this soup would be mush.  Highly recommend!

Surprisingly, really good!  I'm generally not much of a bean soup-type girl.  Lentils gave the soup thickness but not so much of the soft grit-like thickness that I don't really like from most if not all bean soups (Lentil first timer here).  I'll start by saying that I only had half the amount of broth available, so I halved everything else.  GREAT flavor, I did include chopped up tomato (on top of tomato sauce - needed to get rid of it), and probably at least 3x ham the recipe called for (post-thanksgiving leftovers, reason for recipe search..and I STILL have ham leftovers to use!! lol), and about 1Tbsp of of pepper flakes to give it a good kick.  I only let it cook for maybe 6 hours because I fell asleep and got paranoid leaving it to cook on the stove all night without monitoring.  Started around 8pm, woke up around 1am, stirred and shut off...10am nice a thickened up soup..YUMMY! So, I just let residual heat continue heating as much as it could before it started cooling down.  By am it was pretty much room temp, so I just zapped a bowl in the microwave - I wasn't cooking for anyone so it was perfect for me.  Maybe plan accordingly (start in the am) if you're able to monitor throughout until it's ready for supper after 11 hours, but I thought it was pretty good how I did it, and saved on energy bill, lol.

Excellent recipe for leftover ham!! I was pressed on time and made on stove top. The celery, carrots, onions, and garlic I chopped in my food processor. I added olive oil to the bottom the the pot and simmered the veggies garlic and spices together. Then I added the ham, stock, water, and tomato sauce. I put a whole 8oz can in the soup. I simmered everything together for about 45min until the lentils were cooked through. It came out delish!! So happy with this and I will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty! Only changes i made were using a whole 8 oz can of tomato sauce and cooking it on low for a couple hours and then on high for 3. Great with a drizzle of EVOO on top and homemade cornbread! I've made this several times, but this is how i made it this time around.

This was fantastic, Great flavor. I didn't use tomato sauce,  just half a can of drained diced tomatoes . Stuck to the recommended 1 cup of water and 32 oz of broth.  Added some Worcestershire and Sriracha. Cooked on high for 6 hours as opposed to the recommended 11 on slow, worked out just fine. No issues with lentils. I'll make and tinker with this one again for sure.

Made the lentil soup, but with a few changes.  Poached jalapeno sausages, then chopped and added the sausages and some of the poaching water.  Also, added a good size pinch of dried pepper flakes to the crock pot.   We like our soups a little spicy.

This was really good! I had pancetta so I used that in place of the ham, gave it a nice smokiness. Also used some diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. Will definitely be trying this again!

I made it stove top, for dinner.  Unless you really, really like salt, skip it if you are adding ham, as ham has plenty of it.  I'd never cooked with lentils before, but heard of their healthy qualities, tossed in 1/2 a cup and wah-la, they were tender pretty quickly.  I omitted the tomato sauce, didn't have any.    I'll be making this again!

This was fantastic.  Great texture, chunkiness, and flavor.  The seasonings were perfect.  The changes I made were:

*Used 1 C chopped cauliflower (small, like rice grains)
*Used 14 oz. can of stewed tomatoes instead of 8 T tomato sauce
*Added 8 oz. sliced mushrooms
*Used 16 oz. bag of lentils instead of 1 cup
*Used 49 oz. can of chicken broth (instead of what recipe used)

I cooked it overnight on low for about 11-12 hours.  Was perfect.  Could've used a bit more ham than I had, though.

I'm sure this would have been great made as is, BUT, for time's sake, I used my pressure cooker with a few ingredient additions from the Cuisinart pressure cooker cookbook, and, Oh my! was this super fast and super yummy!  I think it took about 45 to 60 minutes total.  All due compliments to queendiva1 for this wonderful base recipe!
I'll write up a Pressure Cooker Lentil and Ham Soup recipe soon and post it.  OR you don't have to make any changes at all.  Just follow the pressure cooker directions in the upcoming recipe with the original ingredients here.

Great recipe, but it needed a bit more liquid. I used a small can of tomato paste instead of the sauce. I will add 2 cups more broth or water next time. My family loved it.

My family LOVES this.  It's very easy and extremely tasty!  It's one of my go-to soups as cool weather approaches.  The only recommendation I have is to make a double batch.  It's even better as leftovers.  It pairs nicely with good homemade bread and a cozy fire on a cool autumn night.

Good recipe.  I modified it just a bit.  Added a can of mild Rotel tomatoes, and extra 1/2 cup of lentils, 2 extra cups of water (will add just one next time).  Added 6 or 7 chicken boullion cubes but will add only 5 next time.  In place of the carrots I added cubed rutabaga, which is great in soup.  I will make this soup again!

This is one of the best soups that I have ever made. The family loved it with cornbread on the side.  I added another bay leaf, white pepper, and used a can of Italian diced tomatoes (instead of the tomato sauce). I also only cooked it for about 10 hours (crock pot/low)  It was perfect!  Will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe three times with a couple of changes: 
-- I used canned diced tomatoes (a whole can) to add more texture and flavor
-- I used cut up andouille sausage instead of ham (I didn't have any lying around and sausage seemed like the next best thing)
-- I've added a couple spoons of red curry paste and it added a whole new flavor profile (and an extra kick!)
-- I cook this for 8 hours MAX

This recipe is a huge huge hit with my housemates, and with me! I love messing around with the ingredients a bit, and adding a little more lentils has never hurt (but you might need more water). I love it!

Made as the recipe called for, except was out of dried basil so left that out.  This was good, but not outstanding.  I think the oregano overpowered it a bit.  Also, the ham did not need to be in the cooker for 11 hours - it turned to a weird consistence and darkened a lot.  If I make it again, will not add the ham until there is only a couple of hours left to cook, as the ham is already cooked and just needs to be heated through.  I would also cut the oregano in half.  The basil might have helped mitigate the strong taste of the oregano.

We added a hamhock as other reviewers did. My husband cut the amount of ham listed in half  and he  added some bulk pork sausage which helped enhance the flavor. We also left out the Bay Leaf and increased the amount of Lentils.  I made Cornbread and it made a delicious meal. It makes a good sized batch of soup. We were able to enjoy it for two meals and put enough in the freezer for a quick yummy meal in the future.

This was super easy to make and came out tasty. I chopped everything up the night before. Based on reviews, I used 1-1/2 c. lentils, added 1 c. extra broth & substituted a can of stewed tomatoes for the water & tomato sauce. I cooked on low for 9 hours & it was delish. A helpful note is that an 8 oz. hamsteak when diced gives the 1-1/2 c. needed for this recipe. Based on other reviews, I served it with homemade cornbread but I think I would have enjoyed crusty French or Italian bread more than the sweet cornbread.

What a delicious and healthy soup!  I have made it several times, and our family enjoys it most with the Wellshire Turkey Kielbasa in place of the ham.  

It is extremely important to cook this soup on low for 11 hours, so you really need to plan ahead based on when you want to eat.  Don't try to rush the process by turning up the slow cooker to high because it  adversely impacts the final product.  The lentils need all that time on low to get tender and "puff up." The last time I made it, I found that I hadn't allowed sufficient time in the slow cooker (entirely my mistake), so the following day I was able to fix the problem by placing the leftovers in a large pot on the stove and letting it simmer for several hours.  

For those of you who may be unfamiliar with lentils like I was, you don't need to soak lentils overnight.  Rinsing them in a strainer or colander directly before using them is sufficient.  Thank you for this hearty, flavorful soup recipe, QueenDiva!

I cooked it on high for 5 hours and it came out delicious. The bay leaf added nice flavor. I topped my bowl with parmesan cheese, and I paired the soup with corn bread muffins. SO GOOD!! Hit the spot for sure.

This was superb. I've made it twice now and everyone loves it. 
I did change it a little. I added a chopped leek to the ingredients. Because I love the taste of a leek in my soup. 
Doubled the quantity the second time and froze the extra. 
I will be making this one again and again.

This recipe has become a family favorite!  It’s savory and flavorful and a nice warm, comforting dish in the winter.  When cooking, I usually crank the crock pot to high and it’s done in about 7 hours.  Just keep an eye on it and check for when the lentils are nice and tender.

I've been meaning to make this recipe for the last two weeks with a smoked spiral cut ham that we had left over so I finally did today.  Excellent!  I used the hambone for extra flavor along with a little more of the vegetables and ham.  I didn't measure everything but it turned out great.  I did use the green lentils and cooked on high for almost 4 hours before reducing to low until ready to eat.  I may have to make another batch for the freezer or better yet freeze some ham just so it doesn't go to waste.  Two out of three sons ate it which does say something! The 11 yr old just couldn't get past the lentils and vegetables but that's pretty normal here.  Highly recommend!

I also agree with a few other reviewers.  I made some changes to the recipe, we loved it.  Changes suggested:  Needs more flavor.  Added more pepper, added salt, 3 shakes of tobacco, large splash RED WINE, one small can of diced tomatoes.  YUM!!  COOKING TIME CHANGE:  If you're short on time, you can set the Crock Pot on high for 4 hours.  Perfect!

This is a nice bone warming soup for cold weather.   It's light,  I added plenty of veggies.  I tweaked it with a bit of hot pepper flakes, too.

Used 1/2 beef broth and Kielbasa because it was what I had.  Not sure why you need 8 tsp. of tomato sauce but I used ketchup and it was perfect....don't particularly care for lots of tomato in this kind of soup.  Serves 4 with salad and home made bread!  Delicious and my husband is glad there are two servings left for another night.

My husband raved about this soup, which by the way was much more like a stew.  I added mushrooms and used a can of rotel. It turned out rich and yummy.

Fantastic!!! My BF doesn't eat beef or pork, so I used turkey ham. I doubled the amount of veggies and lentils, but compensated by adding a little extra stock, maybe a cup. Will definitely try the stewed tomato idea in future, bc this is bookmarked and WILL be cooked again many times. LOVED IT, and it smells so delicious while cooking!!! Thank you! :p

I've made this several times, each time with a different meat.  The ham was okay, but my family prefers either sliced and halved kielbasa or smoked sausage to the ham. The smoked sausage gives it a great smoky flavor.

I used stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce (approx. 1 cup).
I used my immersion blender to chop up stewed tomatoes before adding to soup mixture.
I replaced the water with chicken broth.
I threw in a splash of sriracha chili sauce also.
Usually when a recipe calls for 1 cup of anything, I estimate, and know I add more than called for.  Exception - baking!
11 hours is too long - go for 3-4.

I made this soup as described, substituted diced tomatoes for the sauce as other commenters. And the soup is very bland. It's not inedible, but it is not an enjoyable meal either. Would not make again without significant modification to the original recipe. Not sure how so many people had success with this recipe.

I made this in a soup pot with diced tomatoes instead of the sauce.  That was fine but I failed to notice any of the smoked ham taste that makes pea soup so yummy.  My husband liked it (he had two helpings!) and all the veggies made it healthy, so it was okay but not great.  I served this almost stew-like soup with toasted and buttered Italian rolls and it was a filling and hearty lunch on a very cold Saturday.  But I probably won't rush to make it again.

Like many others, I tweaked this recipe. It's a good starting place.
1. Cooked 1lb (2 cups) of lentiles in 2 quarts of chicken broth
2. Replaced the tomato sauce with canned diced tomatos
3. Cook on high for 2-3 hours, then set to low for another 3 hours. It was ready to serve, but you can probably let it cook longer if you need.

Serve with a dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt and sprinkle with chives.

I used the first comment to help create some changes. I used 14oz crushed tomatoes (fire roasted) instead of the sauce, and I always use homemade chicken stock, which is quite flavorful. I also used 6 cloves of garlic, added a parsnip, and used a small ham hock for flavor. I used 1.5 c of lentils, and  subbed in marjoram for the oregano.  My only complaint is the saltiness (I might use 1 ham steak instead of the 2 next time). However, it was hearty, and is very very tasty!

I  like lentil soup but I didn't care for this recipe. The lentils cooked down to nothing. I agree with some of the other reviews the cooking time is off.  If also lacked flavor. 

 I know everyone has different tastes so if it sounds good to you give it a try it just wasn't something I would make again.

I made this lentil soupe recipe to specifications.  I cooked soup on high level in crock pot instead of low and it only took 5-6 hrs as opposed to 11 hrs.   Great recipe.  Served to kids too.  Only recommendation would be to add a bit of cumin to recipe.

Read all of the reviews and made some suggested changes such as 2 cups of lentiles, large can of stewed tomatoes, more broth and water. Initially cooked on high in crock pot for about 2 hours then turned to medium low and then low for about 10 hours. Served the lentil ham soup with a salad and corn bread.

Very yummy! I basically followed the recipe, with the exceptions of adding mushrooms (because I had them and needed to use them) and I was skeptical of adding another full cup of water to the 4 cups of chicken broth, so I decided to wait a few hours and see what the consistency and flavor was like. Ended up deciding to leave out the extra cup of water. Another reviewer added that the 8 tsp of tomato sauce was weird, which I also thought, so next time I might just add the full 8 oz. 

Turned out really yummy after about 5 hours in slow cooker, definitely will make again!

This freezes well and gets better each time it's re-heated. I  used smoked pork knuckles instead of ham, but otherwise, followed the recipe.  Needed more salt and the smoked knuckles were a mistake- too overpowering.  A bit bland, but when we sprinkled vinegar in our bowls (I used apple, my wife-white) it really came alive. I will use ham and crushed tomatoes  in place of tomato sauce and water the next time.

Will make this soup again. Hearty and flavorful...some soups taste "thin" and are disappointing. Not this soup! Caution, mine was a bit sweet because I could find only honey ham at my grocery store. Would be much better with a not-sweet smoked ham or ham hock.

Rating is for the soup as is.  I liked my changes better, as do others.  I used a full 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  Since other recipes for lentil soup call for a splash of vinegar at the end, I added a tbsp or so of red wine vinegar and a dash of sugar since it had tomato in it.  My Mom always said to add a dash of sugar to anything with a tomato product in it.   It is thicker than my other recipe for lentil soup, due to the large amount of lentils in it.

This was okay. I think I should have maybe added more ham. My husband wasn't a fan either.  I followed the recipe exactly as is.

Excellent!  Makes about 4 generous bowls, which is fine for me - I ate one bowl, saved a bowl for leftovers, and froze the remaining for another day.  The spice mix was perfect, but I had a small can of tomato sauce and used the whole can rather than the teaspoon measure just because I didn't want to waste it.  I will definitely make again over the winter

I used a half pound of Italian sausage instead of ham and a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. It was great. The second time I made a double batch because it disappeared so quickly the first time.

Used cut up stewed tomatoes that has green pepper and onions in it instead of tomato sauce.   Added a tsp of ground chili paste for spiciness. 

 I really like this soup recipe and what a great way to have a bowl of hot soup for a cold day.  Thanks!!

This was delicious!  The aromas while cooking were incredible.   I upped the ham to 2 cups, the lentils to 2 cups, added 2 more cups of water and 3 chicken bouillon cubes.   Cooked it on high for 3 hours, then Low for 1 hour.  Added another cup of water at end.  Made garlic bread to go with.  This one's a keeper for sure! And so easy.

I put this in the crock pot on high for about 5 hours instead of 11 hours on low and I think I short-changed the recipe because of it. I love all the herbs in this. It make such a tasty soup! I did add another clove of garlic, and a little rosemary, but otherwise followed the recipe and this is one I plan to make again.

This is a great, throw it together and go to work recipe!  It's freaking delicious firstly, and it's easy and it makes the house smell great.  It's difficult to go wrong with it.  

And it's versatile enough that you can add other things to it to make it differently.

I was hungry for a lentil soup made at a local restaurant that has since closed after 80 years...and this comes very close.  Only substitution was a can of tomatoes on hand in place of the 8 teaspoons of sauce indicated in the recipe, and did use a little more garlic after tasting.  I had less time, so used my slow cooker on a higher setting for 5-6 hours, and the consistency turned out well.  My husband is choosy about new recipes, and he has asked me to make this again!
I would give 5 stars for overall concept and flavors, but 4 stars for prep because based on other reviews, a cook may need to be familiar enough with their individual slow cooker to know if it would do well with the time and setting from the recipe.  This is not a flaw of the writer, it's a caution for the cook.  The first time you make this, it may not be a set-and-forget it dish.

I never liked lentil soup but I wanted to give it another try because the recipe looked good. I think my mistake was cutting up a hamsteak and adding it to the crock pot without browning it. Next time I'll buy better ham and maybe add a can of spiced diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.

Very good! I took suggestions and used a can of tomatoes instead of sauce. Added a ham hock for extra flavor. It was thick but since my crockpot is small I didn't have room to add more water. Still very tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't to sure about this recipe never having Lentil Soup before but I am a fan now! This was very tasty plus it smelled devine  cooking. I followed the directions as written except I added 1 more cup of water and a chicken bouillon cube. I made this on the stove in my Dutch oven because I like to brown my vegetables. I steam the onion,celery and carrots in a small amount of olive oil before adding my chicken broth and the spices. I let this simmer for awhile adding my lentils last. So good served with hot rolls.

Crocked it 11 hours in my 4 qt.....really brought out the flavor of those fresh veggies.  Got 6 hearty bowls out of this recipe size.  However, it needed a tadmore broth, which may have been the fault of 11 hour of recommended crock time, so go 1-2 hours less.  I feel a 4qt. crock could maybe take a cup+ more of the 32 oz chick broth...or as one reviewer said...he used stewed tomatoes  instead of the  8 tsps. of the tomatoe sauce.  But I think you can put in both as the 8 tsps. is what adds color and it's only small amount anyways.  And adding stewed tomatos will add more liquid and give that added broth  without overflowing 4qt. Crock.

This is my go to meal every Halloween for over 40 years. Make early in the day, the flavor just gets better as it sits. Pair with warm ,crusty bread , salad, and an apple crisp and you have the perfect cold weather meal. Great for moms out trick or treating with their little ones. The only change I made was to add can of chunky tomatoes,for more flavor and texture.

Yum. We don't usually like this sort of soup, but had extra ham (and bone) to use and this was great!  Put the bone into the crockpot for extra flavor. This was ready in just a few hours on high.

Instead of adding the ham as directed, I picked up a lb package of pork neck at the butcher's and used that instead.  After simmering overnight, I found the soup a bit bland and watery for my personal taste.  I added one tsp of salt and a little less than a tablespoon of MSG.  To thicken it, I used a potato masher and manually mashed around the lentils and vegetables for a couple of minutes.  It made a huge difference and it's perfect now.

I cooked the soup for the full 11 hours and it was tasty, but the ham no longer tasted like ham. The lentils and vegetables were not mushy or overcooked, but the ham looked and tasted more like beef stew meat. I don't think I would make it again, but the house smelled great all day while it was cooking.

My family loved it! Made a couple of changes. I ended up doubling the recipe. I used 1lb Italian turkey sausage, added one can dices tomatoes and 1 8oz can tomato sauce. It was great the first day and better the second.

Prep took much longer than 20 minutes considering washing, peeling, & chopping vegetables, then chopping ham.  I can't chop as fast as a chef!  Thought of using a food processor, but was afraid veggies would chop too fine.  Soup did not thicken.  A lot of veggies & ham, but base of soup was still the thin consistency of the chicken broth.  For the results, took too long to cook.  Save time  do like others and do it on the stove.  Will not make again.

I would double the amount of lentils to thicken it up.  I also added a lot more spices - cumin especiallly.

This was a good recipe to start with.  I could only get green lentils, which didn't work as well as white lentils.  I also added a can and a half of stewed tomatoes which added necessary flavor and I also added a bit of balsamic vinegar.

I made this with turkey sausage and added chopped fresh spinach.  Great bowl of soup and fills you up. We'll make this one a favorite.

Thought it was very good.  I did use a can of stewed tomatoes based on previous reviews.  Also I used 1 1/2 cups of lentils and added more chicken broth. Finally I did put some hot sauce in it and cooked it on low for 6 hours.  I will make it again.

I added a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  That was the only change I made. I actually thought it was very bland and tasteless and I won't be making this again. I was disappointed.

I used stew meat instead of the ham. While it was very good, ham probably would've been a better choice. I do recommend it and will make this recipe again.

I used ham  neck bones and the soup had great flavor.  I was not happy that cooking it so long reduced the lentils to nothing. I would not cook it that long again and would probably just do it on the stove. I will make it again.

I thought this recipe was great. I did make a major change in using some really lovely bacon from a local free-range farm because I didn't have any ham. I also used chopped tomatoes left over from a bigger box instead of the paste and just measured them with the broth and then added some more broth during cooking. It turned out more like a stew, which was what I was trying for. I also added some fresh haricot green beans chopped up a bit as I always like to add extra vegetables to dishes if I can. This is a keeper!

Made recipe with exception of the ham,dry herbs and tomato sauce. I used two smoked turkey legs, fresh herbs and a can of diced tomatoes instead. The soup was well accepted by three picky grandchildren, they even took the soup for school lunch the next day. I served with homemade cornbread and side green salad. This soup has been added to our dinner meals rotation.

Very good. Made according to recipe as written. Just added a little more chicken broth as it was pretty thick. Also omitted celery because hubby does not like it. Made it twice and will make it again. Makes quite a bit, but freezes well.

The soup was delicious and I have several zip lock bags of it in the freezer. I did add a can of tomatoes and used dried legumes  soup mix( split peas, lentils, etc)  instead of just the lentils . Very tasty and nutritious.

I substantiated a smoked ham hock, bone in. Cooked in oven at 275' for 11 hours. Texture of the beans and lentils, the rich smokey flavour of the ham hock made for an awesome soup/stew.

Excellent recipe that is easy and full of flavor.  I used a smoked turkey drumstick and added 1/2 tsp each oregano and thyme. I had some fresh bay leaves and sage leaves so those went in, too. I omitted tomato products, but used some fresh wild mushrooms to boost the flavor. Before serving, I buzzed a cup full of the soup with an immersion blender to thicken it to my taste. I'll make it again!

Soup was wonderful!  I added a small can of sliced tomatoes with juice instead of the tomato sauce.  Might use stewed tomatoes and stew meat instead next time.  Eleven hours was too long...8 hrs was plenty of time.

Since this is the first time I have cooked lentils I stuck fairly close to the recipe. I omitted the celery (personal taste) and added about 1 1/2 cups of stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I really liked the taste of the soup, but if I was to make it again will use barley instead of lentils  (again, personal taste). Thanks for the posting the recipe, it's a very good base.

This was a tasty soup that was a cinch to make.  You just chop the veggies and ham, sprinkle on the seasonings and stir in some chicken stock and tomato sauce (although I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with chilis), and put a lid on the slow cooker to wait til dinner time.  The recipe says 11 hours, but I thought  that was a bit too long, so I put it on at 7:30 AM and we ate dinner at about 5:00 PM.  The soup was perfectly cooked.  If I make it again, I'll add a can of tomato pieces along with the tomatoes and chilis...to have a more substantial tomato color and flavor, and I wasn't crazy about all three of the seasonings.  I think I'd stop at oregano and  some black pepper, although if you use tomatoes with Chilis  you probably won't need black pepper.   The chilis are mild, but give a little bit of a kick.

I fixed it with left over pork roast wrapped in bacon. Had to add some salt and it was ready in much less time that the recipe required. (7 hours, in the low setting of my slow cooker)

YUMMY!  I followed the recipe to a T but used 1/2 C both brown and red lentils.  Also used LOW sodium chicken broth.  My ham was really salty so I added 1 C frozen peas at the end to cut the salt.  Everyone loves it!  Will make it again.

I found this recipe good as a base but needing a little something. I added and extra cup of water to combat some of the thickness stated by other reviewers. I also added some chopped frozen spinach, hot sauce and a touch of heavy cream at the very end. That made it for my house! Served with some corn bread and it was a hit!

I love this recipe!  It turned out perfect and I added 2 cut up and peeled  tomatoes to the recipe along with the tomato sauce.  The taste was great, we just added salt and pepper to taste. For my husband can't have salt,  I also used low sodium chicken stock.  
Thank you so much for sharing this free Slow Cooker recipe.

Wondering if anyone had used ham hocks instead of regular ham? I'm a ham hocks lover in any soups, better flavor all around I think than regular ham.
Yes sometime I will add some ham along with my ham hocks only if I can not find large meaty hocks.
But I was just wondering if anyone had used ham hocks in replace of ham and how it turned out if they did. Thanks for taking the time to read and reply.

11 hours? Seriously?  I cooked mine for about 5 hours on high and I couldn't even swallow the ham. I had to take it out of my bowl it was so overcooked and awful.  Otherwise the soup tasted okay but it made a lot.  I will do this one again but next time no crock pot. Just stove top.

Not too hearty for me. Very mushy. Maybe it cooked too long? Not much flavor either.

This was really delicious on Day 1, I'll be today's leftovers (Day 2) will be incredible!  I used a meaty hambone, some fresh tomatoes from garden and the whole bag of lentils, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Yum!!!

This turned out better than expected. I'm enjoying leftovers for lunch and it seems to get better daily. I added a little more lentils ( 4 oz) and next time I would just use a full 16 oz bag. The flavors are great and adding more lentils will make it even better. Nice recipe.

Really enjoyed the smokey flavors in this soup.  I used red lentils, however.  I find their sweeter flavor really balanced out the flavor.  Also, I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.

This recipe was delicious.  I added a can of tomato paste only because my husband and I like it thick.  I didn't have all the vegetables but used what I had and still yummy.  I think that's what soup is for though to use up all your veggies that are on the brink. lol

Mine came out a bit brown. I'd probably add a bit more pepper and add some more tomatoes to make the color more red.

This was an excellent recipe! Because of what I had on hand I added a 3lb can of broth rather than a quart and changed the sauce to a can of crushed tomatoes. I also had a ham bone from a smoked shoulder that  I used. It was seasoned perfectly. It makes a nice slow cooker recipe. I eliminated the water because of the broth and tomato vollume, I only cooked it on low for eight hours and that was enough. It was reheated several times while it was used which is why I cooked it for less. Thank you!  This one is a keeper!

I wish I had not added the tomato sauce, as the recipe suggested.  Ruined the soup.  Next time will be making it without any of that.  I should have trusted myself and not added it.  I find tomatoey things don't go well with ham or poultry, just chicken broth is the best.  Will be making again without tomato sauce.

This soup is EXCELLENT! and so easy to make. Only change I made was slight and that was opening a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomato, breaking them down with the immersion blender, and using about 1/2 the amount. It was just enough tomato base for us without being too much. I cooked it on high for 3 hours and it was PERFECT!! This recipe is now on my soup rotation and I know I'll be making it many more times. Thank You so much for sharing your recipe!

This is a very flavorful soup that I will make again and again! My family loved it! I did make a couple of changes. I could see that the amount of stock to vegetables/lentils was a bit low.Since it looked like the finished soup would be a very thick stew-like consistancy, and I wanted a more soup-like dish, I added twice the amount of stock/broth, plus one cup. I also used my soup pot and cooked this on top of the stove, rather than in my slow cooker. The cooking time for lentils is not long at all, and the soup simmered for about 1 hour. I kept all of the original spices, and stirred them in a little olive oil  for about 30 seconds to release their flavors, then added the minced garlic, again stirring for 30 seconds.Then added the stock, the vegetables and cut up ham plus the bone.I added approximately 2/34 to 3 C. cubed ham, as the liquid was increased, and substituted 1  15oz.can of petite diced tomatoes for the tomato juice. I used about 1 1/4 to 1/12 C. of  each of the vegetables, also owing to the increased liquid, but kept the original vegetables in the recipe. The result was delicious! It's a winner in my book!

This soup is AMAZING!!  I added a chopped parsnip and a can of diced tomatoes, left out the celery (don't like it), and  slow-cooked it on high for 6 hours because I got a late start on chopping the veggies.  I also was going to simmer a ham hock in it, but didn't buy one until mid-afternoon so I heated the ham hock up, sliced off chunks of ham on the ham bone, and threw the chunks in the soup.  I'm on my way now to a dinner party and this soup is my contribution.  I'm sure there won't be any leftovers! It's THAT good!

Very good! I replaced the ham with thick cut cooked bacon. I also added the grease from the bacon, along with some smoked paprika, cumin, and a diced tomato. Very very good! It is now a regular weeknight meal.

This soup is really fantastic. Instead of just adding tomato sauce, I added 5 tbsp of tomato basil sauce + 3 tbsp of ketchup to give a sweeter taste. I also used turkey + chicken stock. Add some salt at the end when ready to serve!

This was delicious. Normally when we sit down to eat I wait for other people's comments before I say what I think about my cooking however tonight when my hubby sat down to dinner I was fortunate enough to have the first bite. I told him he's about to eat the best soup I've ever made, we both agreed it was restaurant quality! Didn't change a thing??

For our taste, this was bland, was a little better by adding chili powder and cumin as another suggested.  I also added diced tomatoes and the end result was too watery (I probably should have drained them).  As suggested, I soaked the lentils overnight but the lentils still were a bit hard.  It could be that we just aren't crazy about lentils.  However, in the end both my husband and I found this to be just OK.  I don't think I'll make this again as there are too many terrific recipes to try.

This is delicious, and it gets better the next day. It's true that the recipe doesn't necessarily need 11-12 hours to cook, but the longer you let it simmer, the richer the flavor will get. I had a bowl after about 7 hours, and another 4 hours later, and really noticed a difference. My stew started getting a little thick, so I added a bottle of beer about eight hours in - which I think also developed the flavor. Will make again.

Will do again. Satisfied a 14y.o. thru 70 y.o. Upon reading other comments, I added 1 can stewed tomatoes in place of paste & used beef broth in place of chicken because I had it open already. Flavors came together nicely, lentils a bit firm @5hr cook/low (longer cook time could yield softer?).

This is now my husband's and my favorite soup! I used 16 oz vegetable broth and 16 oz of chicken broth.  I added more than the 8 teaspoons of the tomato sauce, otherwise what a waste. I used ring sausage instead and it was amazing. I hope you like it like we do.

I would recommend just using water versus chicken stock. Ham has lots of flavor and is loaded with salt, adding chicken stock is overkill. I added everything but the lentils in the beginning. The lentils went in in the last hour. Overall it was okay, nothing to write home about.

We don't eat pork, so I used some bone in lamb pieces for the ham. I cooked it on High for 4 hours, took the lamb out, deboned and shredded the meat and put it back in the crock pot. The 8 teaspoons tomato sauce is probably a typo, 8 oz is the amount  meant.The soup came out delicious, but a bit runny. If I make it again, I will either try pureeing some of the soup to fix that or omit the water.

My husband even liked it. He is usually the soup maker and all around cook in our family. So when he likes what I make I know it is a hit.  I did not use tomato sauce but petite diced tomato's as others had done. I also added diced potato's because that is what I associate as being in Lentil soup.

I used a little more lentils, and a little more ham than called for, and it only needed to cook maybe 4 - 6 hours, and it was great!

YUUUMMMM! I did what others have suggested and added a can of stewed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I also added 1/2 cup more water and cooked on high for about 4 hours. I'll definitely be making this again.

It had a bland taste, something was definitely missing.   One of the spices called for in the recipe was over powering, I just don't know which one it was.  Will not be trying this recipe again.

This was absolutely delicious!! After my first bowl, I was eating spoonfuls from the crock pot.  I used the whole can of tomato sauce, added a can of diced tomatoes, 1-2 cups of water (to fill up the crock pot), some salt, garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  So much flavor!

Delicious! The only change I made was that I added another 1-2 cups of water since the lentils were really soaking up the liquid near the 7th hour in the crock-pot.

OMG! I made this soup this past Sunday and it was sooo good! I didn't change a thing for ingredients but the only thing I did do was turn the crock pot up on high for the last 4 hours. I didn't think the veggies would be done if I had left it on low the entire time. I will be making this again!

Great recipe!  Didn't have time to wait for the slow cooker so cooked it stovetop.  Mix lentils: beluga and organic or whatever I have.  Usually will use a honey baked ham bone & add the meat back to the soup, and usually also add cooked chicken breast and organic chicken sausage too.  All three meats in one pot makes for a hearty and wonderful soup!  Thank you for the recipe :-)

Made this twice with leftover ham. First time exactly as with, second time using ham stock from a boiled ham and tomato paste since i was out of sauce. Both times delishious!  W like our soups very flavorful so doubled the spices the second time and added some liquid smoke, hot sauce and chipotle pepper flakes. Wow!

Doubled the recipe and cooked it on the stove. Did leftover ham & ham bone.  Followed the recipe and added 1 can tomatoes instead of 2 cans tomato sauce. Also, added a little of red pepper flakes.  It was delicious!!  Can't wait until tomorrow when the spices have time to meld more.

Really good.  Only change I made was didn't have ham so put in browned Italian sausage - and I did cook it on top of the stove.  I always use siracha in just about every soup i make ... like the heat.  But that is something I add to my bowl not the pot.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The soup itself has a very nice flavor, I added a can of diced tomatoes and did not put in the tomatoe sauce. Found  the Lentil's did not soften, I bought them for this recipe but perhaps they were old in the store. Will try it again. Thanks for the recipe.

I used the entire ham bone and simmered everything on the stove. I'm not sure the broth would have had an intense enough flavour for me with just the ham pieces, but that is a personal preference, and I also used diced tomatoes.  That doesn't change the flavour, it just adds a different texture.  Another personal preference is that I prefer my soups to have a little body.  I don't like a liquid broth.  So I added 1/2 cup of instant potato flakes at the end and simmered for another 30 minutes to give it that little "extra" stick to your ribs texture.  :)  Thank you for sharing.

This is very good!!  I had a leftover hamhock and some meat so I threw it all in and didn't go by the measurements at all.  I used more water than chicken stock and put ketchup in instead of tomato sauce and it all contributed to a wonderful soup!

This was amazing!  I did alter the recipe a bit-added chili powder and cayenne as suggested by someone else on here-also added salt and white pepper and a can o diced tomatoes.  You'll also need more water than this recipe calls for depending on how go your crock pot gets or it may get totally dried out if left unattended.  Or keep some extra water handy and check the soup occasionally just to make sure.  The whole family loved it, very flavorful!

Added chicken and apples sausage instead of ham and the entire bag of lentils.  Instead of the tomato paste I used 1 large can of diced tomatoes. It was so delicious. I am certain it would have been just as good with the original recipe but this is what I had on hand. A true 5 star winner.

I've used this several different ways, and it's always been a winner! I love to use it for leftover hambones (with all the ham you can't really get off), After it's all cooked a while, I fish the bone out, cut the soft ham off & add it back to the pot. I usually add some more ham to that It's so yummy!

This soup was very good, even though by sheer accident, it ended up being pea soup versus lentil soup because my husband bought the wrong bag. I've made other soups in the slow cooker, and have had them come out on the heavy, thick, almost pasty side. That wasn't the case with t his soup. Other than peas, and throwing a leftover meaty ham bone in at the beginning, I followed the recipe exactly. Seasoning was great!

This was delicious! My first time cooking lentils. I used french lentils. I decided to omit the basil and use fresh thyme. I subbed 1-2 tsp. tomato paste for the 8 tsp. sauce. I used veggie broth instead of chicken. I also added about 1/4 cup pureed butternut squash I needed to use up. It gave the soup a little thickness. I cooked on high for 5 1/2 to 6 hours. I love soups and will definitely add this to my list of favorites!!

I've never cooked anything with lentils so I followed the recipe to a t except for substituting pork tenderloin for the ham. The texture was perfect and the flavor was wonderful. This is a great soup base and next time I will try it with chicken. It would also be wonderful as a vegetarian dish as well.

This was ok, I felt that the 11 hours that was suggested really dried out my precooked Ham. I did like that it was healthy and made a lot!

Cooked less than 10 hours and was done. I used dehydrated carrots and onions and I am glad I added extra water and spices. I like it with toast and a little dollop of plain yogurt.

It was a little heavy on the spices for me. I didn't have 11 hours, but I stuck it on high for about 5 hours and the consistency was perfect. More like stew, really. The lentils were mushy, but I've never used them before. Hubs likes it okay. It's not a favorite of ours, but I'll probably try it again with some tweaking.

This was really good!  Our one change was to use up the smoked ham hock we had in the fridge in place of the diced ham.  Not a big change.  It was thick and really flavorful.  Wonderful autumn food.

I played pretty fast and loose with this recipe, doubling it and changing ingredients that I didn't have in the house: a leek instead of the onion; a spice blend of black and green peppercorns, red berries, onion, rosemary, mustard seed, and thyme; a can of stewed plum tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. Proportionally, probably less water, too, and I used three picked-over ham hocks for the meat. It came out great. This is a very forgiving recipe base! Will make forever.

This was so easy to make - used the leftover ham from Thanksgiving - included the bone while cooking.  Didn't have a bay leaf, but don't feel it was really missed.  Was a tad salty, but wouldn't blame the recipe - probably was the ham.  Just added more broth to tone it down a bit.

This soup was very good and filled the house with a nice aroma. Keep a watch on it thought because I'm not sure if I overcooked it at 9 hours on low.  I suppose different slow cookers run different temperatures.  I checked on it because I couldn't smell it as strongly anymore...good thing because the lentils were nice and soft already.  I may have even been able to get away with 6 hours.  I think adding diced tomato would give it an extra kick.

I really dug this soup. My husband said it was too "porky" but he's on a veg kick right now, so I suspect that's why. Could also have been because I used smoked canadian bacon chunks instead of ham because for some reason I couldn't find cooked ham. I cooked it for the full 11 hours and used a full can of tomato sauce. I thought it was plenty salty and flavorful and really liked the texture. I will be enjoying it for lunch today!

Excellent! Can't go wrong. Too thick, add more broth. Not salty enough, add salt. Too salty add a little water. I did add the whole can of tomato sauce and all broth, no water. Also added beef broth by accident and it was still great! Made this twice now and I love it. Also is good reheated. Healthy soup that's enough for a whole meal on it's own.

Everyone was thrilled with this meal, especially the men. We had it with a nice tossed salad and hearty grain bread warmed with butter.   I used the left overs from a spiral ham as the base so it got some of the flavoring from the glaze also.   I forget to put in the tomato sauce too, just by mistake but it was still a hit.   This is staying in the recipe box.

This recipe is delicious and hearty. I made this on the stove top vs. the crock pot.  The ingredient  changes I made are as follows:
1. left out the celery (only because I didn't have any in my fridge and I didn't feel like going to the grocery store to get it)
2. I used 3 green onions 
3. I used tomato puree vs tomato sauce
4. I used 2 cups of lentils (that's what I had in the pantry)
5. I upped the water to 5 cups
My daughters asked for this soup to make our dinner rotations. 
Thanks!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was probably the worst soup I ever tasted. A complete waste of my time and money. I didn't even think it deserved one star but it wouldn't work unless I put at least one.

There are not many recipes that I follow exactly, but this one needs absolutely no adjusting. It's just perfect the way it is!

Update: I have made this many times as my whole family loves it. I often use a ham bone if I have one. I have also used kielbasa. Sometimes I add peeled, cubed white potatoes for a heavier soup. I've also tried it with different beans and it's just always delicious!

my bf said he didn't like lentils, until i made this. i followed recipe; added the ham and added the one cup onion but a little extra carrots and extra celery. also i add 10 cups chicken broth, and no water, and a whole 8 oz can of tomato sauce. added the basil, thyme, oregano, black pepper and garlic but also added 2 bay leaves, and 2 cloves for the spices. it was good, even my ten year old liked it. next time i want to add some chopped spinach in.

I can't wait to make this again!  It was only the second thing I've cooked in my slow cooker, and it was awesome.  I did two things slightly differently.  Because I have a 6qt. crock pot I increased my veggies by about 1/2 c each, and appx. 3 cups ham.  I also threw in the ham bone.  (I found this recipe looking for uses for too much leftover ham).  I also increased my liquid a tiny bit... Ok, this made my house smell so wonderful that I could not wait the entire 11 hours.  I dished it up at 9.5 hrs and it was perfect.  Next time I will add a bit more lentils, and test it at 8 hrs.  Fabulous and easy recipe!

My family loved this recipe. I will definitely make this recipe again. One thing I did differently was to add the small ham bone from the ham while cooking. The only other change I made was to use low sodium chicken broth.

So good. Had a leftover Easter ham so I just threw it in the slow cooker. I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used a few fresh tomatoes roughly chopped and the soup was still really good.

This was ok. My husband seemed to really like it. I liked the flavor a lot but did not care to much for the texture of the lentil beans. It was my first time trying them and I much prefer regular ham and bean soup.

This soup is awesome! Having it again for lunch today. I made it just as the recipe stated, except I put it in the crock pot on high, I lost track of time because of doing other things, but I think it was done at about 3.5 or 4 hours. Great to make over the weekend and take for lunch during the work week!

We liked this but I would add more lentils.  I prefer many lentils in my ham and lentil soup.  Taste and seasoning was wonderful though.

It's easy to make, and it has great taste. I didn't have beans at the time, so I threw in some dried lentils instead, and it was great! Best past is: it dirties only one pot! Easy to clean up afterwards, and the leftovers are really nice on home made pizza with grated cheese on top.

I found the lentils to be undercooked.  I cooked it a lot longer.  Eventually I put it on the stove.  The lentils must be soaked overnight before making this recipe.  It only improved after cooking on the stovetop.

Really hearty and delicious. I have made this twice. We loved it made both ways, but the second time we doubled the ham for a more meaty soup and substituted 1 1/2 cups of split peas for the lentils with great success. Freezes well. We'll definitely be making this more often. My one caution is not to salt the soup till it's done cooking -- depending on your ham it may be quite salty, even without added salt.

Followed recipe with the exception I only let it cook for 9.5 hours. I loved the flavor of this soup. Adding it to the winter soup rotation. It is not spicey nor bland if you use a good quality ham.

Very Good. Make sure that you wake up early since it takes all day to cook. I was a little late for work the day that I prepared it. I added the stewed tomatoes and extra water/chicken boullion also and I am glad that I did. I served it with jalepeno cheese bread and it was delicious. I cant wait to make it again.

I made this for my family and it was fantastic. I have never cooked with lentils but now this recipe will be a popular dish around my house. I recommend using cooked ham off the bone - it enhances the flavor of the soup.

Neither hubby nor I liked this very much. I followed some suggestions and used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. It wasn't too thick, it just didn't have a very distinct flavor. I couldn't taste the ham at all. Not sure if I did something wrong, but I won't be making it again to find out.

Fantastic! I haven't had lentil soup since I was a kid and forced to eat it! This is one of the few recipes I've tried on allrecipes where I didn't have to make many variations to. I did, however, use a can of stewed tomatoes because I didn't readily have sauce, which gave me more of a broth in the soup. Exceptionally flavorful! Great recipe!

This was a great basic recipe, but I made some changes to suit our tastes- it turned out fabulous. I cooked this on the stove for an hour (I was pressed for time); added a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce; left out the celery and carrots and added 1/4 of a bell pepper & only half an onion; ignored the part about the spices and added chili powder, pepper, salt, and basil to taste, plus a few dashes of hot sauce at the end.  

I couldn't give this 5 stars because I made so many changes to the original recipe, but it's a great template to work with.

The soup was very good.  I made it exactly as described; however, it seemed to be lacking something - something to make the flavors pop a bit.

Pretty good, a little bland.  I would use half the amount of celery and some more spices.

I added a bit of extra 'italian' herbs and it turned out great!! Definitely added to the 'do again' cookbook!

11 hours is TOO LONG for this recipe!  When I came back to it, there was a scrim of dried food on top, and it had that harsh, bitter tang that slow-cooker food gets when it's cooked TOO LONG.  I have no idea how good this would be if cooked correctly, but I'm not curious enough to find out.  p.s. - I think tomato sauce also made this unpleasant.

I improvised, but it was still excellent. I used a small can of tomato paste instead of sauce. I also added a hambone in addition to the diced ham. Used a little more water. Very salty, but good.  I threw in a potato just to draw out some of the saltiness (thanks for the tip, Mom!) and it was even better when my husband got home from work.

This recipe was perfect as I was looking for a way to use up the leftover Easter ham and I've been on a bit of a lentil kick lately.  I omitted the celery and used a full can of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce. Also about doubled the ham just to use it up. Absolutely delicious. The ham lent a nice smoky taste, and the lentils made it nice and hearty. Looking forward to my next ham dinner so I can make this with the leftovers!

Excellent recipe. Proportions were perfect.
I followed some of the suggestions, added stewed tomatoes, a smoked ham hock and extra water. It turned out delicious and is a keeper -- thanks!

Didn't add basil and was in such a rush I forgot to add garlic (how do you forget garlic???)  I did add a can of diced tomatoes with their liquid.  Still needed to add a little more water as it got really thick.
Very tasty and definitely a recipe I'll make again.  Even the hubby liked it and he's not much for 'soup as a meal'!

This was OK - a little heavy on the basil.  Would probably make it again.  I added extra ham.

I don't know what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exactly, but the result was blech. I think maybe I don't like basil and oregano, so I should omit those in the future. But other than that, it is a nice easy meal to fix. I just need to adjust the spices.

I thought this was very good and my dad who is hard to please really liked it. I didn't have any carrots or celery so I used potatoes instead. I put them in in the beginning and it came out really good. Will cook again.

This was a basically good recipe that, due to circumstances, I had to alter. I used beef broth instead of chicken and green split peas instead of lentils. The spices were nice and the ham hock gave the soup a flovorful not too over powering greese that is so good in home cooked food.

Good soup - I had a hammy hambone and a parsnip, so I threw them in too!
