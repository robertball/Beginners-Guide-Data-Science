I don't know how I lived 37 years without knowing I could make donuts from fridge biscuits, but I'm making up for lost time. I tried the bottle cap trick, but found that my puff balls brown more evenly if I just cut the biscuits in quarters and roll them into balls. I sprinkled these with a little lemon juice, then the powdered sugar. YUM. Thanks!!!

Definitely a diet wrecker :)  I had some biscuit dough in the fridge that I wanted to use up and this recipe was perfect.  I didn't bother cutting into circles, I just cut each biscuit into fourths (like you would for monkey bread) and fried them that way.  They fried very quickly for me, in one minute, and I didn't have to turn them as my deep fryer wire basket had a lid to keep them immersed in the oil.  It is important not to let them get too brown, or you can taste it and they get hard.  I even tried rolling the dough pieces into balls first and they do come out looking more like Timbits but they aren't as soft so I wouldn't bother trying that step (the wedges come out looking almost circular anyway).  I thought I'd save time and shake the dough balls in a ziploc bag but that deposits way too much sugar, better to roll them in sugar like the recipe says!  I will definitely use this recipe again when I want to give my family a treat, thanks for the recipe!

I hate the taste of canned biscuits, so I picked up a bag of those wonderful frozen ones, as they taste so much fresher, and let them thaw separatly on a baking sheet.   Then I cut them into 4's, deep fried them, and rolled them in granulated sugar and cinnamon.  These are to die for!!  It might be an extra step, but if you don't like that canned biscuit flavor, try these.  And they only take a little while to thaw!!

I've been doing this for years and it is fantastic!  They are so simple and fun to do.  I usually cut the center out of one biscuit so I end up with donuts and donut holes.  The kids love them!

My mom would make these for us when we were kids, and we called them "oakey donuts".  These are just fabulous! We also would use powdered sugar and do cinnamon and sugar ones too! Easy and delicious!

Super easy, super fast. I just cut biscuits in quarters and dropped in oil. Let them cool a little and used a ziploc bag, one filled with a little powdered sugar, the other with cinnamon and sugar. Dumped some donuts in each, closed and shook. All done. I think flavor really depends on the brand of biscuits you use. Will definitely make again.

These where so easy to make. I had a biscuit in the fridge and one day I was just looking on the site. I came across this recipe. It was easy and quick what I did was cut the jumbo bisuits in fours and rolled them dropped them in the oil and fried them for not even 2 min. They cooked quickly. I let them dry from the oil and rolled powder on them. I will make these again and for hubbys co-workers. Thank you for the recipe...

I was very surprised at how good these were. These need to come with a large warning sign. These were HIGHLY ADDICTIVE! I will say that I did not like them once they were cold. These need to be eaten right away. I look forward to making these again.

YUMMY!!! A quick fix for a doughnut without the work!  I coated some in powdered sugar and some in cinnamon sugar.  Next time I'll try a glaze.  These were soooo easy and delicious!

Homemade donut holes! How can you NOT love this? A great activity with my pre-schooler. She loved helping to roll the dough into balls before frying, and then helping to roll them in sugar afterwards. (And of course licking her fingers!)

My older brother would make these when he got stuck babysitting me. Now my kids love them. I like to roll them in cinnamon sugar or dip them in warmed up canned frosting. Taste best when still warm. Yummy!!

My mom made these all the time when I was growing up. It's one of those recipes that is so simple you can't believe it can be sooo good but it is. These are excellent! We also roll ours in cinnamon sugar.

My family has enjoyed this recipe for years.  This is another way to make "donuts".  Simply take each biscuit, punch a hole in the middle with your thumbs and fry on each side until golden.  One more diet wrecker, make homemade vanilla buttercream icing and ice while warm.  Delicious treat for breakfast or a late night snack!  I have also used Grand's Biscuits.  Just take a small paring knife and cut out a circle in the middle.  The "donut hole" is your puff ball and the rest is your "donut".

A quick and easy treat to use up biscuits!  I cut mine into 4 triangler pieces and dropped into oil...they cooked very fast...you cannot leave the pan or they will be too brown.  I even used a generic butter type biscuit and they puffed up nicely.  I immediately coated in cinnamon sugar.  The family inhaled them all within 15 minutes.

Not the greatest, but if you just want something quick these are okay. They do not taste good the next day, so only make what you are going to eat right away. I probably won't make this again.

Great to satisfy a little donut craving.  I heated the oil on the stovetop at a medium heat and then reduced it to low heat (just over a simmer) and got terrific results.

My husband has made these for years but being from New Orleans we call them fast beignets and eat them for breakfast.  They are wonderful and have made them for many houseguests when we don't have time (or mix) to make real beignets.

Liked these for a sweet treat on a Sunday morning. I simply cut the biscuit in half before frying. Most likely due to the way I cut them I had to lower the temp of the oil to 350 degrees to ensure they cooked all the way through without burning on the outside. Made chocolate icing to spread on them and then added chocolate sprinkles. Yum fresh hot "doughnuts"!

Excellent simple recipe.  Definitely easiest if you use a deep fryer. They're basically ball shaped funnel cakes! Quite tasty.

I make these all the time.  Instead of rolling in powdered sugar, I make a glaze with the sugar and water.  Sometimes we make a cinnamon sugar mixture and we roll them in there.  Great for a snack or quick dessert.

This is something I grew up with and loved as a kid. The trick is to after frying it, dip it a cinn. sugar mix, powdered sugar twice! Also, just a point that these are great warm and fresh, but don't save any left overs. They are not good cold or reheated.

I used a donut cutter and made donuts. They were fantastic. I used cinnamon sugar instead of confectioners' sugar and with half, I dipped them in lemon juice before coating with cinnamon sugar (I wanted them to taste like my favorite beaver tails menu item) and they were great.

My family enjoyed these this morning! I made a variety of doughnuts. For some,I rolled dough out, fried, then frosted with either caramel or chocolate frosting. Others I cut out centers, fried, then topped with powdered sugar glaze. And topped rest with cinnamon sugar. I'll definitely be making these again.

I do love these! We used to make them when we were younger. You can also dress them with some honey.

This was a camping staple when I was young. Every Sunday we would make these on our Coleman stove before packing up camp. They are delicious and simple to make. Nothing beats these when they are still hot and soft!

These were really good.  I cooked them in the deep fryer and they tasted just like warm donuts.  This was a really great and fast treat.  I made mine with powdered sugar mixed with a little cinnamon.  Yummy!

These were easy to make, but the biscuits I chose were very salty and they did nothing for the sugar topping.  I will make more, but this time I will choose a different biscuit.

Such an easy way to make a quick breakfast.  I quartered the biscuits and didn't even bother rolling them.   I sprinkled them  with cinnamon and sugar.  Everyone enjoyed these!

made due with these tonight as we ran out of anything "good" (freak accident). Better sprinkled with lemon juice & confectioners sugar instead of the cinnamon/sugar. Certainly not the equivalent to a real doughnut but we were desperate

I used flaky Pillsbury canned biscuits - also, the "fresher" the biscuit the better (canned biscuits do get old :-))  Fabulous - I flattened the biscuit patted one side in cinnamon sugar, rolled it, then sliced it into 3 "mini rolls" and then fried it. Once it was patted with a paper towel, I tossed them in the cinnamon sugar again. Very good!

Minimal effort and satisfied my prego sweet tooth at midnight but I probably won't make again unless I'm pregnant again. Maybe with a glaze they would taste better. I rolled half in powdered sugar and the other half in granulated sugar / cinnamon combo.

Not too bad wasn't a lot of flavor  but pretty good for the amount of time :-) maybe add butter before you roll it into the ingredients
