Something I have found that helps with cleanup with this recipe is that I line the pan with foil.  There is much grease from the smokies and it is much easier to dump the foil after baking the smokies!!  My family and friends love this snack!!!  :)

The problem I had with this recipe was the brown sugar melted and began to caramelize before the bacon was done.  The brown sugar was over cooked by the time the bacon was brown.  The next time I cook them I'll cook half way then springle with the brown sugar.

I make these during the holidays, but instead of brown sugar, I bake them with BBQ sauce. My family loves them. (You can also try mushrooms wrapped in bacon.)

These are always a crow pleaser whenever I serve them.  I usually broil these for about 5 minutes so the bacon gets nice and crispy.

Awesome for a pot luck, always a crowd pleaser.  Thick bacon takes forever to cook and smokies start to get almost burnt so I use regular slice bacon.  I toss the wrapped smokies in a bowl with brown sugar then sprinkle what is left over the smokies.  Foil line the pan (for quick clean-up) and cook on a cookie rack over the pan.  To keep warm, toss them in the crock pot on warm setting.

You can't go wrong with bacon! I omitted the brown sugar entirely (I don't care for sweet foods). If I were to make again, I think I would rotate the pan halfway through to ensure even cooking - some of the bacon ended up super crispy and some of it need to cook longer.

I make these several times a year for my family and for extened family get-togethers.  They are the first to go!  The only thing I do differently is to bake them slow at 300 for an hour and a half until all the brown sugar is melted.  Using basting syringe to draw off some of the bacon grease helps make these a bit more appetizing.

This recipe is awesome!  I recommend cutting the piece of bacon in to 3 pieces instead of 4.  Also, I wait to add the brown sugar until about halfway through the cooking time.  I would also say that the Prep Time is not 15 minutes.  It's probably double that.

Very good. I do think that they need to be turned half way through baking. Mine were half crispy half soggy bacon. But they still tasted good.

Used turkey smokies and turkey bacon and they worked out great. I was hesitant about the brown sugar so I made a test batch and the ones with the brown sugar were better and really did not taste sweet. Also, I used regular aluminum foil to line one pan and the "non-stick/release" foil on the other and the non stick foil seemed to make the brown sugar burn and really provided no additional benefit, stick with regular foil.

These are so tasty!  I used the same ingredients however I laced the bacon strips in brown sugar first before rolling them, I also used a broiler pan, instead of a baking pan so the grease fell right through and cooked these at 350 for about 45 min.  I lined the bottom of the broiler pan with foil for an easier clean up â€“ it was still kind of messy but well worth it.

These are pretty good but a few tips that I find really helpful. 1. Use thin cut bacon, the thick cut won't crisp up properly.   2. Due to the short cooking time if you are still having trouble with the bacon not crisping stick them in the microwave until just beginning to cook and then wrap the smokies. 3. Add 1/8 - 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper to the brown sugar mixture. Also I always cook mine in the smoker to add even more flavor.  250 for 1 1/2 hours and they are amazing!

Great recipe. The only thing I did different instead of just sprinkeling the br. sugar on the smokies I rubbed in the br. sugar onto each wrapped smokie. Used about 1cup and 1/2 of br. sugar. Have made these quite a few times in the last year.

Excellent recipe. I soak the bacon wrapped sausages in brown sugar for about 2 hours prior to making them. They cook for about 35 minutes and they are ready to go!

Have done this one tons of times. Tip is to soak bamboo skewers and put a bunch of then on each one. Then you can sprinkle brown sugar and half way through turn them all over and sprinkle again. Pull then off with a fork when done and then they hold together so you do not have to have a toothe pick in each one. Also awesome if you wrap the bacon around pineapple chunks instead of little weiners XXXOOO

Hard to believe that just a few simple ingredients could produce such a tasty appetizer!  I've never actually made them this way, but I have a friend at work who always brings these to our employee Christmas party, and they are gone about as quickly a my caramel brownies are.  I would say stick them under the broiler again for just a minute or two before serving, if you are making these ahead of time.  So much better than just plan ole' smokies in BBQ sauce.  I am going to try the all beef or turkey smokies wrapped in turkey bacon since neither my husband nor I eat beef (I just make an exception for these, haha.)

These are very yummy!!!...but a few suggestions..instead of sprinkling with sugar roll them..sprinkling does not give you the sweetness it needs. Also...bake the non a rake so that they are up out of the grease which will leave them soggy if cooked in it...Was a major crowd please..VERY TASTY!!

This is FANTASTIC.  The last time I made these, I wrapped the sausages in bacon and covered them with the brown sugar eary in the morning the day I was serving them.  I covered them in foil and put them in the fridge so that I could pull them out and bake them later that evening.

I've made these dozens of times.  The trick to perfect smokies is to put the brown sugar on the DAY before and let it soak in overnight before cooking.  And yes, line your pan with foil! Yummy!

This is the best way to have little smokies. I make then in a crock pot with BBQ sauce and dip them in cheese and also wrap them in dough and make pigs in a blanket and this is hands down my families favorite way to have these. I used regular cut bacon hickery smoked and I did put the brown sugar on them. I should have put down tin foil on my baking sheet first because it was a mess and hard to clean up.

I followed the recipe exactly, when it came to the ingredients. With cooking I cooked them for 30 min then broiled them for 3 min to crisp them up. I also flipped them 1/2 way through.. My family raved about them.  I also made a second batch where instead of the brown sugar I used BBQ sauce like other suggested.  Everyone loved those also.

I usually make my lit'l smokies differently.  When I saw this recipe I decided to mix it up a bit and try it out.  These were amazing!  I made them for a get together with friends and they were gone in no time!  I will make sure to double the batch next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Make them on the roasting pan for easier clean up with the bacon grease.  Also, the bacon will be crispy and more evenly cooked if you can turn them over half way through and sprinkle a bit more brown sugar on.

Made these twice , first as written. They were good   but need a little "Heat" to balance the sweetness. second time  I added a little red pepper  with the brown sugar. Family liked the sweet-hot best.

What is not to love? Bacon wrapped sausage..I slid a slice of pickled jalapeno over the sausage then wrapped with thin sliced bacon, dropped into the deep fryer to crisp the bacon then coated with brown sugar and put into oven to melt the sugar.  It was the first thing gone for our Christmas snacks.
