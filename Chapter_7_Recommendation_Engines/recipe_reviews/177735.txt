Fantastic! I always change recipes and this is no exception, so here's what I did: 4 mangos, 8oz cream cheese (very softened), zest from a whole small lime (not key lime), 6 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 cups of heavy whipping cream. I blended all ingredients except whipping cream in the blender until smooth. Beat the whipping cream until soft peaks formed (approx. 8 mins. on high) then GENTLY folded both together. It was so delicious, I had to stop myself to save some for dessert! Be sure to refrigerate for 1 hour prior to serving. I did not use the baking crust, just served them in a bowl, and no coconut. ***After eating, I would change one thing... it was very creamy, so I'd reduce the whipping cream to 1 cup instead of 2 to bring out more mango. (I forgot to account for the previously whipped measurement of frozen topping when I changed it to 2 cups of heavy cream prior to whipping, if that makes sense.)***

Although this is a light and refreshing dessert, I was a little let down with the lack of flavor from the mango and the over powering flavor of the lime zest. It also lacked the firm body of a mousse. I will make this again with a few changes; fresh whipped cream instead of Cool Whip, more cream cheese and less lime zest. A definate keeper for a hot summer evening.

This recipe has many of my favorite flavor combinations, so it was an easy decision to make this. I didn't love the idea of the pastry shells, so I chose to simply make the mousse, following the recipe as written. I loved it! Definitely plan on using two mangoes though, as you really need to top the mousse with extra mango. While it is nice on its own, it's just rich, sweet and creamy enough to need the tang of added fresh mango to  balance it out. And the toasted coconut really finishes it nicely. The recipe directs to chill for an hour before serving, but even after several hours, it was not mousse-like, but more like a very soft whipped cream cheese texture. If I made this again, I would use some toasted coconut and crushed ginger cookies as a base for an added layer of flavor and texture, but I would still opt out of using the pastry crust.

I just made this as a quick dinner dessert and it came out great! Of course I had some modifications. I used 2 mangoes, one 8 oz of cream cheese and whipping cream. And for the base I used Cream Crackers, Walnuts and butter.   It was an easy dish to make and everyone loved it! Will definitely make this again.

Didn't care for the flavor.
