Made as written.  Delicious!   We did use dried herbs except for the mint. I had doubts about the mint, but it was very subtle. Served with a Greek pasta salad. It's going in the rotation!

I followed the recipe carefully although I had slightly less lamb.  It was easy to make and was delicious hot and cold!

I followed this recipe exactly and really liked it a lot...except for the amount of lemon zest called for.  It was pretty lemony, which I normally like a lot.  But going forward, I recommend 1 teaspoon, not a tablespoon, of lemon zest!  And I recommend draining the fat before serving it. Thanks for the recipe--very good!
