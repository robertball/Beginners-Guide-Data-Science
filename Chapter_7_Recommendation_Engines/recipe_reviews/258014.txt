Excellent! I had fresh oregano from my garden and I always use fresh over dried when I can. At the last second before this went in the oven I decided to sprinkle some crushed red chile flakes over the top and that was a good move too if you like spicy. This came out perfect and looked like something you'd get at a fancy restaurant. Even my husband was bragging on the way it looked. I told him that it didn't have meat on it and he said it looked so delicious that he didn't even notice. This one is a keeper!
