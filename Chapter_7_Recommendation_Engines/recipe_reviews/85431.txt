I have been making potato pancakes for YEARS and I always put my shredded potatos in a clean dishcloth and give them a good wringing before I add the eggs and such...

My red potatoes gave off a lot of liquid after shredding & I can't imagine adding 3 eggs to this. I only used one egg & still had to add at least twice the amount of flour called for. I should've used my common sense & squeezed the moisture out of the potatoes instead of trying to compensate by adding extra flour to a terribly soupy mixture. They didn't turn out bad but I could've saved myself some time & energy if I would've just trusted my own cooking skills.

This was good, but there was nothing overly special about it.  Point to remember~ some spuds have more moisture than others. If you don't use the reds in the recipe, you may need to adjust the amount of flour.

I made this recipe exactly and I found the lime juice too strong.  I would eliminate this in future as there was already enough liquid from the other ingredients.

This is a great recipe! I LOVE the fact that I didn't have to peel or precook the potatoes. The only change I made was using green onions because that's all I had on had. I'm keeping this one for sure!

Made these for dinner last night and loved it! I have never had potato pancakes before and was very thrilled with the result. I chose 4 stars only because I thought there was too much salt. 1 tblsp is a lot, next time I'll use less. I also added some Italian blend cheese and deli meat. I followed the advice of  another reviewer and wrang out the potatoes in some cheese cloth.

I loved this recipe. I wasn't too sure after reading the reviews but it came out good. My kids couldn't get enough. I would love to find a way to make it so they don't cook in oil to make it healthier. I only changed the dried rosemary, I added some garlic and complete seasoning but that is only because of my personal preference when it comes to seasoning. Everything else worked fine. I also recommend drying the potatoes between paper towels to take some of the moisture out.

I mixed all ingredients, as listed, and then put it into a blender for a smooth consistency in the pancakes.  My family loved them! Great recipe.

The rest of the family enjoyed them, but I found them much too greasy.

These worked out very well once I drained the mixture in the measuring cup before I placed them in the frying pan.  The only strain from the recipe came when I realized I had no lime juice.  I used some lemon juice, but less than the recipe states.  The flavor was solid and we ate them with salsa and sour cream.

I found this recipe when I was looking for a way to use some left over potatoes. So, I used my leftover, cooked russets instead of news. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was VERY good. I loved the flavor from the rosemary and lime juice. My picky kids liked it too! (with lots of ketchup)

Really not so good, the texture wasn't great (I am not normally hung up on texture) and the flavor left something to be desired; it was worth a try I guess but nobody in my home liked them at all.

We made this to go with Oktoberfest sausages last night and they turned out to be amazing. We didn't use rosemary but used thyme and a little oregano instead. They were delicious with sour cream and apple sauce. You do need to be mindful of the moisture content. Bon appetite!
