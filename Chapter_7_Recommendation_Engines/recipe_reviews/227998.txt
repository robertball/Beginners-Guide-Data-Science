This is the same recipe I bookmarked a year ago, but it has been altered, which totally threw me off. The recipe seems to be the same except for the addition of the cocoa. I'll have to write down the recipe as I think I know it and never rely on Allrecipes to be a solid cookbook if it can be altered so easily.

Made this recipe twice already.  Doubled it the first time, and I was so worried at the speed with which my diabetic husband consumed them, that it was a single batch the second time.  Love, love, love these cookies!

For Christmas I was given a jar of cookie mix from Crabtree comp. Ive been craving those cookies ever since I made them. This recipe seems to be exactly the same!  Im glad I found this =) The dough is very stiff and almost crumbly but is not a problem once rolled into 1 tbsp balls. I always chill cookie dough 24 hrs before I bake and leave cookies on baking sheet for 3 mins after pulling them out of the oven. All in all good recipe. Thank you Tbot!

2-11-2016  ~I was more or less looking for a a basic cookie jar cookie that would be great to freeze, since that ’s where Hubs goes foraging for them when he needs a sugar fix after supper.  I wasn’t terribly excited to make these so it was a nice surprise when I found they were much better than I had expected of them.  They’re thick but not too thick; not poofy in other words, ‘course I did flatten them slightly on the cookie sheet before I popped them into the oven.  I substituted chocolate covered raisins for the chocolate chips, and even tho’ the cookies were delicious with them I can only imagine how much more rich and chocolatey they’d be with the chips.   Delicious, for sure, either way.  I made no changes to the recipe and after baking them found none were necessary.

I make these All. The. Time! I make them for meetings, gifts, & when I need to fill a chocolate craving. I've made the recipe as is, and have also substituted the white sugar for agave syrup (adding 3 tbsp off additional flour) and brown sugar for coconut sugar. Fabulous!

Unfortunately, I did not like these as all.  I guess I'm not as big of a chocolate fan as I thought.  I found after the cookies were mixed, they were too dry, so it was hard to scoop onto a cookie sheet without the cookies falling apart.  I won't make them again, but if I did, I would probably drop the cocoa and that way they aren't so chocolately and dry.

OMG!! Soooo yummy!!! A few changes: I added cup and a half of minichocochips and I think that next time I’ll add just one cup. Cooking time will depend of thickness of the cookie (probably obvious for an experienced baker but I’m a newbie!) I tried one batch making balls of 1” thickness and I baked them for 14 min. Next batch I flattened them to half an inch and baked them for 11 min. Personally I liked the thicker one better because they are crunchy outside and chewey inside.

These cookies are awesome. They are moist, chewy and rich chocolatey goodness. I used only half of the chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand. Just follow the recipe as it is written. Yum!!

I followed the recipe as shown, no changes except I made smaller cookies,  using a small cookie  scoop.   These are delicious, very chocolate, soft, moist and easy to make.  They freeze well.  I will make these again and again.

This foggy, rainy called for oatmeal cookies, but with a twist. Hmm, chocolate? Yes! I hope this is still considered eerrrtttyy's recipe with what I did. I think I scanted the dry ingredients, used only one cup chips and added a cup of walnuts. Noting the comment about them not flattening, I mushed them with my hand. They came out a little crispy on the outside and soft inside. Wish I'd had coconut on hand. I think that might have been good. This satisfies the rainy-day craving.

Followed recipe except for substitution with Old fashioned oats, which was all I had. They are moist and chewy, almost too sweet for our taste. The dough did not flatten (as mentioned by other reviewers) so the first batch I flattened by hand half way through the baking time, the rest I just squashed directly onto the baking sheets before putting in the oven. Did not find these super exciting, fun to bake once, will move on to try other cookies.

I put 1 1/4 cup chocolate chips instead of 2 cups, and it worked fine. It was a bit strong chocolate flavor for my liking, so next time I would put less cocoa powder. I also added less sugar (and only brown, since I only bake with brown sugar). It was completely sweet enough! I also would have preferred it to be more chewy and less crunch.

As easy as any other cookie. I made this with Bob's Red Mill Old Fashioned Rolled Oats, which are gluten free. Turned out fantastic! A little more salt, or kosher salt, may give this recipe a little kick. I'll try and post results!

My Grandson loves chocolate, and he loves these cookies.  I have made them three times and each time I ask him what kind of cookies he would like this time.  His answer always is Chocolate Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies.

These are delicious!! My kids love them! I thought there was no chance they would turn out bc I accidentally flip flopped amounts of the  baking soda vs baking powder, was short on oats as well as cocoa powder but they still turned out delicious! They didn't flatten like in the picture but the taste as great! I can imagine if I did it all correctly!  Word of caution- it makes a lot of cookies! Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved the taste of these cookies, but I'm a big chocolate fan. I did find the dough a little dry but I had never made them before, so I just plugged along. I looked in at 5 minutes and they were not flattening at all, so I took them out and flattened with the bottom of a glass. I pulled them out at 11 minutes, let them sit on the silicone mat for 10 minutes, then moved to a rack. They are delicious, and I'll definitely be making them again.

this recipe was awesome!  my girls had a ball making them. used spelt flour as I'm sensitive to wheat and it came out beautifully. next time would probably cut the sugar. make sure to press down before baking.

Other than having a hard time not gobbling up the dough this ia a perfect cookie for the chocolate addict like me! I used old fashoned oats because it's what we buy and milk chocolate chips. Next batch, and there will be a next, I'm using peanut butter chips!  Thank you for the delicious recipe!

I made this recipe to use up various ingredients I had on hand so I tweaked the recipe accordingly. I used self-rising flour and omitted the leavening additives and cocoa powder, I used 1 cup Scottish Oats and 1 cup whole grain muesli in lieu of the quick cooking oats, added extra chocolate chips (I just dumped in the entire 24 oz bag) and since I was 1/4 cup short on the butter I added 1/4 cup avocado oil to make up the difference. 

I couldn't be bothered to bake individual cookies so I made one full size "Toll House" Pie and two mini pies. Hubby LOVES it, but wouldn't if he knew it contained oats Yep, he's childish that way. He'll get to enjoy the two minis.  I'm bringing the full size pie to Party Bridge.

Awesome cookie! Came out perfect. My only suggestion would be to slightly press them down so they are not so fat. This one is a keeper! Thanks eerrrrtttttyyy.

One of the best recipes I have made off here, so soft and chewy and a little crunchy.

These are very tasty, but a bit hard to work with! I will try them again, but will use half the oats and half the chocolate chips - there just isn't enough dough to hold all the 'stuff' together!! I had to form the cookies with my hands, and even then, they barely stay together. But my kids and my husband love them, so will definitely give it a shot.

I love these cookies... They sooth the soul. I use a sugar/splenda blend for the sugar and they are still awesome...

My family absolutely LOVED these cookies... There were only 2 things I did different with this recipe. I added 1 1/2 tbs corn syrup along with an extra 1/2 cup white sugar because I don't like the way unsweetened cocoa tastes. It turned out FANTISTIC and I will continue to make these more often!!
