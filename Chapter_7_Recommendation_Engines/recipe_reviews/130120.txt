Really delicious, but I would suggest a few modifications. 1st- buy a pre made oreo cookie crust. Don't bother crushing the cookies to make a crust. 2nd- Watch the chocolate sauce while heating on the stove. Mine got really thick (not sure if that was normal) but it was hard to "marble into" to pudding, so I just spread it on top, like a fudge sauce!

I tried this recipe out as a desert for a pre-thanksgiving dinner. It was an instant hit! I couldn't beleive how simply combining cold milk, jello vanilla pudding, and cool whip can taste exactly like vanilla ice cream! The chocolate syrup adding tasted great too! I added sprinkles for fun to give it a sundae feel. Over all I recommend this dish, plus it really easy to do! I'm a guy so the more easy the better!

Like another reviewer, I could not "marble" the pie very easily either.  Next time I will just skip the whole condensed milk/chocolate thing.  The mix was great before I added that!  My kids fought over who got to like the bowl!!    I needed more cookies that the recipe indicated...20.  I bet I could have used more for a better crust.  This must make a smaller size crust.    The filling was more than my crust...so the kids got a little bit of rich pudding after I finished.  Adding the chocolate mixture at the end made it even higher!  Definately try this recipe...but be prepared to make it your own with your finishing touches!
