This recipe is awesome!  I have Celiac disease and truly missed eating flour tortillas.  These hit the spot.  Easy to mix, make and eat.  I actually like these better than flour tortillas.  Thank you for this recipe!

These came out perfectly. I only had red sorghum flour on hand, which may be thirstier than its white cousin. I ended up needing to add a couple of tablespoons of water to thin out the batter. A half batch made six crepes (1/4 cup of batter each). I served them with a mascarpone and sweet ancho chili filling. These were a perfect starter for our dinner. Thank you for the recipe.
