I have made this recipe twice - the first time I did not have any almond flour, so I substituted with regular all purpose flour.  These cookies were good and had many good reviews; however, last night I made them with almond flour - what a difference! They are light, crisp on the outside, and packed with almond flavor.  These cookies are perfect for bridal showers and teas.

I'm doing a somewhat keto diet to cut down on my carb intake so I did a cookie search with almond flour which got me here. That being said, this recipe really wouldn't be keto approved BUT as a regular cookie I can see the seasonal possibilities. Dyeing the doughs  red & green for Christmas, pastel colors for Easter, dark chocolate & orange for Halloween,,, or for non seasonal reason like for school colors, the list can go on and on.

These cookies were exactly as described -- light, crispy and buttery. I agree with another reviewer that they are perfect for a ladies tea or bridal shower.  The dough was very easy to work with.  I didn't have the right sized cookie cutters so I used my biscuit cutters which worked great. The reason for the four star rating is because my kids liked these but didn't feel they were good enough to add to the Christmas cookie list.

I made these today, and my husband helped out as well. I like that the cookies are not too sweet.
