This recipe was wonderful.  I made a couple of changes to the recipe of course :)  but it was delicious!  I added pepper and granulated garlic to the flour and salt mixture.  I also doubled the sauce because I was making 4 chicken breasts.  I didn't measure the amount of lemon juice I used, I just put in the juice of one extra large lemon.  The lemon flavor was great, and the chicken was cooked perfectly in the amount of time recommended.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

YUMM__O! This recipe is also known as Chicken Picatta. I worked for Olive Garden for 9 years and this was one of my favorites. This recipe is amazingly awesome!!!!!!!Just like Olive Gardens. My only suggestion is to double or TRIPLE the sauce because I love to dip my bread in it as well as make sure my meat is coated well. I don't like to skimp. This is also great  substituting veal and I may try the sauce on pork chops. You can NOT go wrong with this recipe. EASY EASY and friends will think you fussed a long time over it. This will become a staple in my house. Everyone has GOT to try this one. ENJOY!!

I substituted chicken broth for the wine.  I don't know how much difference that made, but the dish turned out wonderfully.  DELICIOUS!  The capers add great flavor that blends beautifully with the lemon sauce. Yummy, yummy, yummy!

Totally worth 5 stars in my family's opinion!  I made the recipe exactly as stated, although I did not serve with the lemon wedges and I did double the sauce.  The sauce was so good, you could easily triple it and use every drop!  I did not find the lemon overpowering or the capers too salty -- it was just perfect for our tastes.  However, next time I will pound the chicken breasts to flatten them a little as another reviewer recommended.  I also think the butter could easily be cut in half and not be missed.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm moving and have packed nearly everything in my kitchen. This recipe is not only easy but does not require many items. I added a clove of garlic to the boiling wine sauce and used salted butter because I felt it needed more zing. I didn't measure the lemon. It was very simple and really good. Will go into my rotation. Thanks!

This is probably my favorite chicken recipe I have ever made. The chicken had such a great flavor and the sauce was delicious. My husband gobbled it up and there were no leftovers!

This is a favorite with everyone we've served this dish to. We pound the chicken so that it cooks evenly and quicker. For a change I made it last night with garlic-marinated green olives instead of capers and it was great. The olives have a flavor quality similar to the capers and are a great substitute for those people who don't like capers. I like to serve this with couscous. Also I double the wine and lemon juice in the sauce but not the butter; I like the extra sauce but can't bring myself to use a whole stick of butter!

I've never rated a recipe but this one warrants high recommendations. It's quick easy and full of flavor. When making the sauce stir continuously. The person submitting the recipe was right about it separating if allowed to rest. Thank you "AllisasMom" for a great dish!

This is excellent.  We pound the chicken very flat and season it with poultry season in the flour.  We also pre cook prosciutto, mushrooms and artichoke hearts in a frying pan with olive oil and tripple the sauce and serve over spagetti.  It's a HUGE hit at our house...never any leftovers!

This was perfect!!! Easy but restaurant-quality. I used chicken tenders because that's what I had and I substituted Smart Balance for the butter. My whole family loved it. I'll make this often.

Very nice! I put 4 stars because i made a few changes. I used 200ml white wine and 200ml chicken stock so it makes a decent sauce. I used half the lemon juice. And i added a big handful of baby spinach and wilted in the pan for the last couple of minutes before serving. Was delicious! I served over couscous.

I give this 5 stars because it is delicious if followed to a T, but also has lots of wiggle room!
First time I made this, I made it exactly as recipe stated. Second time, I realized I didn't have white wine and went the chicken broth route as some people suggested - it was good! I do prefer with wine though.
The next time I make this, I will follow another suggestion to add spinach to get some yummy wilted spinach in there. That sounds good!
You can decrease the amount of flour for sure, but for the people saying to decrease butter I don't really think it's necessary ;)
Overall, this will be a keeper in my chicken dish rotation. LOVE this. For people who are not fond of tart flavors that come with lemon juice and capers, this may not be tasty. but I loved it.

This recipe was awesome. I used whole-wheat flour instead of regular flour but otherwise followed the recipe to a "T" - and even heated the dinner plates. It was one of the best chicken entrees I have ever had - at home or out at a restaurant. Outstanding.

First off I mean absolutely no disrespect to the recipe submitter. I can certainly see why this recipe could appeal to many but it just wasn't for us. We found it entirely too lemony for our tastes and I love lemon in most things. Everything in the recipe worked exactly as it should have. The procedure was good and quite simple. I flattened the chicken some before coating and we loved how that came out. The three stars is more a reflection on our tastes than it is on the recipe. If I was to make this again I would cut the lemon in half at the very least.

Fantastic recipe. I had tried to make similar sauces before and they never turned out quite right the method is right on with this one which makes is very easy to adjust for personal taste if you don't like wine use chicken broth and you can use the amount of lemon you like. Next time I might add a can of artichoke hearts with the capers.

This recipe is not only easy but versatile.  I used it on top of different types of fish.  It was delicious too.  I tried it on Tilapia, Salmon and Haddock.  I prefer it over the Tilapia since that fish has a milder flavor.

I would advise you to try this with 1 T capers first before using 2T and perhaps 1T of lemon juice. The capers and lemon are very tart together. I added 2T cream and 1/2 t cornstarch because I wanted my sauce thicker and more like a creamy lemon caper sauce. It was too tart so I added 2T butter. Although that did not keep it from being tart it still did taste good because I like capers but I think I will search for a more reliable recipe next time. The sauce was good on the fish and on plain zucchini.

We really loved this. I discovered that Costco carries boneless skinless chicken breast tenderloins (I usually just skate through Costco so have no idea how long they have offered the tenderloins). I made one package of those and thought one-half the recipe of sauce would do. But sadly no. It would take the full recipe for us (just the two of us). I downsized the amount of butter but left everything else the same. I would use the whole recipe the next time. Just the chicken and a salad was enough for us. My hubby just loved it and kept saying so. That to me is the best thing ever! A keeper!

I gave it two stars because we finished it. I have to say this was way too lemony. I thought it tasted flat out sour. Maybe I'd try it again cutting down on the lemon but I think I may just try a different chicken piccata recipe instead.

This is excellent - and my kids (11 and 17) love it too. We sometimes add spinach and mushrooms. If you don't want to open a whole bottle of wine buy a small ("airline size") bottle at your local liquor store - you will use about 1/2 of one for this dish. Simple enough for a weekday and good leftover too.

When I told my husband I was making a lemon chicken for dinner he wasn't very excited about it.. But once I served this dish it was a hit! I did everything just as the recipe says except I added some fresh garlic to the pan while cooking the chicken and only used the juice of 1 lemon. I served it over basmati rice and it was perfect. Kids loved it too. A new favorite in my house.

This was pretty good - the sauce was pretty tart but it's supposed to be. I added about 1 tbsp of capers probably a little more wine too. I think a good dose of garlic would have made this even better.

Really really good recipe thank you! I made this with pretty thick chicken breasts so I pounded them thin--but they were still a tad thick. So it took longer to cook them than recipe stated but that's okay. You have to adjust based on what you have so that's fine with me. Since I had three chicken breasts I decided to double the sauce but did not double the butter. I'm glad I did since this sauce is very good but it might have been a bit much butter for me. I also think it's a tad too lemony; I'd increase the wine and cut back on the lemon next time. Otherwise I think this recipe is really wonderful and it really isnt' that hard--just make sure you stir while incorporating the butter. thanks for hte recipe!

Made this dish for myself and my "foodie" boyfriend. It was a HIT! Will definitely make it again. A couple of changes I made were I doubled the sauce ingredients (not the butter portion) and added pepper and Italian bread crumb to the flour mixture I feel like it gave the chicken a touch more flavor without overwhelming it. So Yummy!

I first cooked the pan off with a cup of chicken broth then added the wine 1/4 cup of lemon juice a corn starch slurry to thicken the sauce (instead of butter) and a bit of sugar to reduce the lemon flavor.

This was sooo good and pretty easy to make! My husband and I made this and absolutely loved it! We only made a few modifications- a little garlic powder in the dry mixture pounded out the chicken breasts added 2 gloves fresh grated garlic to the sauce when it was reducing used chicken broth instead of white wine then added chopped black olives when we added the capers. Delicious!

My hubby loved this recipe. I tripled the recipe but used 1/2 of the white wine it called for and replaced the rest with KB chicken broth. I also used capers packed in salt (i just like them better I hate them in brine)and rinsed only half of them because I felt like it needed salt. I added garlic powder to the flour like someone else suggested. I steamed some fresh broccoli and tossed it with Gemelli pasta and added the extra lemon-caper sauce to it and topped it off with parmesan cheese. My husband is already asking when I am making it again. Oh I also added some Wondra to thicken it a bit more.

If you like capers this is a great dish. My husband isn't a fan of them however so he didn't care for this sauce. I would recommend this dish because it is very flavorful and easy to prepare. Just make sure who your serving it to likes capers. I loved it!

This was ok I wanted the sauce to be a little thicker. Maybe next time I will use some cornstarch and thicken it up a little.

Delicious and mouth watering. I made only a few changes to this recipe. I pounded the chicken breast down to about 1/4" doubled the sauce and didn't use the lemon wedges. My family and neighbors love it! I have been asked for the recipe several times.

The recipe was just yummy. The only change I made was to place the browned chicken in a pie plate in a 325 degree oven while I made the sauce and cooked the pasta for about 12 minutes. I was concerned the chicken would not be cooked through. I think this actually improved the chicken as the crust got nice and dry and the oil evaporated. I served it with thin spaghetti in a light butter sauce and the juxtaposition of the lemony chicken with the simple pasta was just perfect. Sprinkled it with parsley before servimg and it looked festive. Also by putting the chicken in a baking dish I didn't drown it in the sauce. Several people said it was too lemony I just spooned a tablespoon of sauce over each breast just before serving and it was perfect. I think if it sat in the sauce it would be too tart and the crispy crust on the chicken would have gotten slimy.

I agree with everyone here too lemony. I added sugar to the leftover sauce and will see what it's like at lunch. The butter turned my sauce a weird brownish unappetizing color. I had really hoped to duplicate Buca Di Beppo's lemon chicken but I'll have to keep looking.

HAS POTENTIAL...please read! UPDATED! I love lemon chicken but the sauce was too lemony--1/4 cup lemon juice must be too much. Also the author said be careful of the sauce breaking after you add the butter--you have to pay VERY close attention to the sauce at that point. I personally would prefer a creamier sauce...if anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate it because I haven't had a good lemon chicken dish in years! UPDATE: I would also pound the chicken for tenderizing before cooking plus it will make more servings if your chicken breasts are large. Next time I will try the suggestion from the other reviewer about making the sauce thicker and creamier.

LOVED this recipe! We didn't have enough lemon juice for the recipe so we used less plus mixed in some lime juice. We also didn't have any white wine so we used chicken broth instead. We added a whole tablespoon more of capers (which I love) and served the chicken on top of mashed potatoes. Sooooooo yummy!

This chicken was a hit! We eat gluten free so I used gluten free flour for the chicken and served over a gluten free pasta. The sauce was not as thick as I like so I added more wine water butter flour better than bouillon and some heavy whipping cream at the end. Everyone was licking their plates!

Made this for the first time tonight. My kids walked into the kitchen and complained about the smell saw the capers and asked "Eww what are those?" They all ate every bite my 10yo and 3yo had seconds. The first bite seemed very lemony but I didn't notice it after that. I did substitute my all-purpose gluten free flour for the regular flour and it turned out fine. I will definitely be making it again although I may reduce the lemon juice a bit. I had a citron not a regular lemon so that may have made it stronger.

Great recipe and pretty easy --I only varied the recipe a bit by using chicken tenders Panko Japanese breadcrumbs instead of flour for the coating and spreadable butter made with some canola oil. I served it over capellini -- which carried the sauce nicely. Yum!

It is good enough to serve at a dinner party yet simple enough to make for a family dinner. I will definitely add this to my regular rotation.

Save money cut up whole chickens. Use the rest for other stuff. Pound breasts to 1/4" season then coat with cornstarch fry 2 to 2.5 per side add some pickled green peppercorns with the capers. Use arrowroot to thicken if necessary as it is clear in color. To hot spaghetti add chopped garlic and butter to taste.

For me this was NOT good. I made it exactly as directed and the sauce was way too lemony and oily. I couldn't even finish this. Yuck:( Next time I would add garlic and more salt and maybe some additional seasonings and less lemon.

I made a triple amount of sauce (for 6 chicken breasts) but cut back on the lemon juice to 1/4 cup 3/4 cup wine 1/2 cup chicken broth 2 Tbs. cornstarch and 1/4 cup butter. The wine taste was so heavy that I had to add the chicken broth. CHANGES I WOULD MAKE Next time: increase chicken broth and use less wine use half the flour (too much waste) only double the sauce (too much left over) and pound chicken to even thickness. I would continue to cut back on the lemon & butter.

We are Gluten free in our house. I use Trader Joe's GF Flour and I double or triple the sauce to have as a gravy for the GF pasta. I have made it in small batches but always extra for leftovers. I have made it for a sweet sixteen for the family too. I cut up the chicken breast into bite size "medallions". Family and friends love this recipe. Thank you!

Very light and delicate lemon flavoring - the lemon isn't too strong. Goes very well over all kinds of meats/poultry or salmon. Keep stirring though - sauce separates very easily and then it's not as pretty but still tastes good. And of course add a little garlic!

Yum. I doubled the recipe and added an extra 1/2 cup of chicken broth to cut down on the tartness from the lemon. Also took me a lot longer to cook my chicken breast so I put them back in the sauce and simmered for 10min. Probably wouldn't coat this in flour the next time I cook it.

4 stars for mixed reviews. I would give it 3 stars but the hubby loved it and would give it 5. My opinion is use less lemon! I doubled the lemon juice and the wine after reading numerous reviews to "double the sauce". I couldnt bring myself to use any more butter but did in the end to cut some of the lemon flavor (which was still too much).

We really liked it but we took others' advice. I doubled the sauce but used just 1/4 cup lemon juice (that was cutting the lemon juice in half) and about 5 Tbls. butter in it. It was very good. I tilted the pan as I put the butter in. It turned out very nice. I also used extra dry white vermouth for the wine. It seemed to take more time then I expected. When you work with pasta you want that hot as well as the sauce. I surely would make it again but not for company because it is a last minute meal.

Lemony and tangy. Cook the sauce until almost evaporated then add butter.

I have made this recipe before and never rated it. So here it is...This is really good however i add just a little more lemon and a fresh lemon. My husband and I love capers so i added more as well as a little flour to thicken the sauce. I also added fresh mushrooms. This is by far the best recipe on this website! A family Fave!

This was very yummy except that I made it vegetarian by using sundried tomatoes capers spinach and mushrooms rather than chicken. The sauce was very good though.

Fantastic recipe that will be an easy pleaser. I agree with the other person who doubled the sauce recipe so that there would be enough to cover the pasta. However I found the sauce to be a bit runny. I'll have to think of what to do to thicken it for the next time. I'll definitely cook this again!:-)

Delicious and easier to make than expected. Tastes just like my favorite dish from a fancy restaurant in Salt Lake. I used white cooking wine which worked fine. Next time I'll pound the chicken or cut the breasts in half.

This recipe was just ok. It seemed to tart. It may have been the wine I used but it almost tasted like too much lemon. If I make this again I will opt for less lemon and add garlic.

3/15: i wanted a recipe like this for fish but the flounder was way too thin for this recipe. the sauce was too lemony also. not really sure how to cook very thin fish? i used dover sole from trader joes. i think it would be very good rolled up like the recipe that rolls it with rice brocolli and cheese. but i was looking for something that matthew would like. oh well

I would definitely make this again. It was quick easy to prepare and delicious. We added a small minced shallot to the oil after taking out the chicken and added about a bit of parsley that we had when we added the capers. Served it atop whole wheat linguini.

This was such a great recipe! I cooked some spinach to go on the side over top of the pasta and when it was done added just a little bit of butter and lemon juice to the spinach before serving! It was a fantastic and a slightly healthier spin! My husband 3 year old and 1 year old all loved it! Thanks so much for sharing it with us!

TOO MUCH LEMON. I doubled the sauce but did not double the lemon and 1/4 cup was still way too lemony for us. Would not have been able to eat with the full amount stated in recipe. May try again starting with a tablespoon of lemon juice with double the sauce. I added garlic also.

this is my new favorit recipe!! I have made it 4 times in the past 2 weeks - my husband loves it. I ran out of Olive oil and Veg oil worked just as well. Also mixed season salt with the flour to coat the chicken gives it just a bit more flavor. One time I had the sauce separate but I think I may have used just a bit too much olive oil. I do not think it was a butter issue - keep it moving and it is great. I have doubled the sauce every time. I tend to use just a bit less lemon juice - it can be very powerful. Enjoy super easy and fast.

Even though it was too tart for our taste I went ahead and rated it 5 stars because it is basically a great recipe. Next time though I will start out with half the amount of lemon juice and make up the difference with either water or chicken broth and then add more lemon juice if needed.

This is an absolute keeper! Tasty AND easy! I've tried a lot of chicken w/lemon-caper-white wine sauce variations but this is hands down the best. I really appreciate the fact that it requires only a handful of basic ingredients. The only things I did a bit differently was to pound out the chicken a bit and increase the amount of sauce. This is one of those entrees that you can serve to guests in the blink of an eye - it would be VERY difficult to mess this one up.

Very very good. I gave it 4 stars because I made some changes. I dredged the chicken in egg and flour first off. Then instead of white wine I used about 1/4 cup of vermouth and 1/2 cup chicken broth. I let the sauce simmer for a while to thicken up and added some parsley. Yummm I will make this again definitley.

I used this recipe for the sauce only on fish. The sauce was very good served over fish. We subbed chicken stock for the white wine and it probably changed the flavor a little but was still good.

This recipe is great! So easy and tasty. It can be paired with polenta potatoes rice or pasta. I didn't really measure the amounts just added them as I like them. I did pound the breasts down and add garlic powder and pepper to the flour mix but otherwise kept it the same as written. Yum!

Made it was a really good recipe but my substitution was using Holland House white cooking wine with lemon. That sounded great but I didn't realize it has 190 mg sodium per serving. As I tasted the sauce while cooking it was salty added more of the cooking wine! Tasted again still salty added water and more flour to thicken. Tasted it wanted more wine flavor added more wine it was too salty! Read the label on the bottle saw the added sodium and was bummed! Added more water and flour to thicken it was still too salty! Anyway I'm leaving this review as a warning to all you home cooks to read ALL the labels even the cooking wine! That extra sodium almost ruined this recipe. But there are hidden salt and sugars in lots of condiments. Never thought there would be sodium in cooking wine! Anyway the end result was delicious a really simple recipe that ends up with a very elegant finish! Had it over buttered noodles. Will definitely make this again but follow it to the letter next time!

The recipe was a huge hit. The husband rarely comments about what is prepared but loved this dish. Since this was the first time I made it I followed reviews that suggested to cut back on the lemon juice which I did but only slightly and boy was it delicious and flavorful. I will definitely use this recipe again.

My husband loved this meal. He is very picky and usually likes plain foods but he ate this stuff up. The chicken was so tender and juicy. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very good recipe for a starting point - thanks! I doubled the recipe added fresh sliced garlic (3 cloves - we like garlic in our house!) and some fresh cracked pepper. I also reduced the amount of capers by a tbsp and it was still a bit salty so had to reduce with some water. Next time I will only do 1/2 the recommended capers. I will definitely make this again...

Yum! I didn't know what this was but I had an old bottle of capers that I got instead of cloves one time lol. Didn't know what they were used for. Now I know. This was simply delicious:-)

This was really good. I like a stronger lemon flavor but that is just personal preference. I served this with rice and green beans and there was not enough sauce to go around.Next time I will double the sauce changing up the ratio of the liquids and add some zest to give the sauce more of a lemony kick.

I followed the recipe exactly  - only doubling the sauce as recommended by others.  However, even though I love lemon, it was far too strong. I threw it out and started again with just one tablespoon of lemon juice.

The chicken turns out so good everytime. I think the sauce is great it can change based on what wine you use. My husband isn't a huge fan of lemon or wine but he still eats it. We usually serve with rice pilaf.

This is a very good versatile recipe. I like to use chicken tenders because they thaw (if frozen) and cook faster. We like to mix up the side dishes with this too such as orzo rice or noodles.

A make it as-is (delicious) or dust the chicken with cayenne pepper before dredging in flour for a little more spice (my preference). Very easy and fast. Great for dinner on busy nights. This is a crowd pleaser everyone will like it

I was so looking forward to making this recipe as I love Chicken Piccata/Limone. Thank goodness that I tasted the sauce prior to using. It was so lemony that it would burn out the inside of your mouth! Horrible! I used fresh lemons (2 of them) to make the 1/4 cup of lemon juice so perhaps this was the problem (vs. using watered-down bottled lemon juice). I quickly added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to cut the overpowering lemon flavor and acidity. This saved a potential disaster and was 5-star yummy!

Just made this recipe. I couldn't believe how fast & easy it was to make. I had to substitute a few items but overall I think it came out pretty similar. Substitutes: chicken = pork chops dry white wine = ginger ale & white vinegar lemon juice = lime juice. My husband & I loved it!

Very very good! My husband has asked for this recipe to be made already twice in one week! One time I made the recipe and served with spicy potatoes and the next I made it with pasta. I will take other reviewers advice with the pasta in particular and DOUBLE the sauce and capers. This sauce is easy and by far and away a pure and lemon with capers sauce. I do think I will try some veal next.

Great directions and easy to make with ingredients on hand. I was craving something tart but I'll say it was a bit too tart for me. Next time I'll cut the lemon and definitely add some garlic. I did throw in some cherry tomatoes with the chicken and then some artichoke hearts with the capers.

The chicken breasts I used were huge and it took much longer to cook. Next time I would pound them down a bit. Sauce was good but I felt it needed a little more lemon. Must day tht even my picky daughter enjoyed the meal as a leftover.

I really liked this recipe. Easy cheap and I usually have the stuff on hand. My only problem was that the chicken wasn't cooked all the way when I took it out so after I made the sauce I had to put the chicken back in it which made me nervous about serving the sauce. Otherwise no changes were necessary.

All I can say is......OH MY!! There wasn't one over rated review for this recipe because it was absolutely incredible!! Instead of having to pound the chicken I bought the thin cutlets which worked out beautifully. I made five cutlets and was still able to cut back on the butter. I'm a red wine drinker so I just subbed with chicken broth and added in some garlic powder and parsley flakes. Bravo "Alissasmom" for a job well done!!

This recipe/technique is good but really way too strong with lemon. Maybe I cooked it down too much thus making the flavor too intense. I probably will not try this again because quite frankly I felt so guilty using this much butter for just two chicken breasts.

This sauce has the potential to be great...I made it exactly as written. The amount of lemon was waaaayyy overwhelming. I sliced enormous organic chicken breasts into 3 fillets each. They were bought this morning as they hit the store from the farm. They were like butter...never had any better...ever. I will cut down on the lemon next go round and perhaps some of the butter...sadly. It is an amazingly easy and elegant recipe. I made faces (tart lemon faces) as I ate. My fiance' loves tart so he raved about it. It's totally company worthy...careful about the strong lemon/tart taste.

Saved this years ago and it is one of my favorites. A VERY classy dish with a Quick&Easy level of effort. New cooks should try it. Great results exactly as written but I admit I usually add garlic cause I love it.

Delicious dish!! Definitely will make this again. Super quick and easy. Family loved it which is always a plus. I was a tad impatient and didn't give the sauce enough time to thicken up so I will have to work on that next time; but that was my issue not the recipe.

I Loved it! I doubled the recipe BUT instead of 4 breast halves i cut my 2 in half (thickness-wise) to thin out the meat and it was PERFECT. Maybe a lil less lemon juice next time though.

I have been trying to recreate a dish from La Perla in DC for a year and have been consistently failing. But here it is.AMAZING!!!! After dinner I sat down and licked extra sauce out of the pan (my fiancé made fun of me). To make the capers more tender I lightly chopped and added them when I added the wine.

My husband loved it said I should have made double the amount so he could have left overs. I did make a few changes. I added more salt to flour and added some pepper. I reduced the amount of butter and added cream to the sauce. It came out as a creamy lemon and butter sauce. yummy!

This was my first time making the recipe and the results were great! I substituted the capers with ground pepper because I couldn't find the capers at the supermarket. No worries though the ground pepper worked out just fine. Like I said the results were great! I substituted the 2 pieces of chicken breast with smaller 4 pieces. The results were fine. I would make this recipe again.

I really like this recipe and when I found it I made it for everyone. If you have someone who is not a huge Lemon fan use 1/2 lemon and 1/2 lime and it cut through the full on Lemon flavor. I alway cook it with spaghetti.

This was ok but the Lemon Caper sauce was actually too much Lemon. The chicken had a good flavor and stayed moist. I served with Pasta expecting to be able to use the sauce on the pasta too but it was too much. I will probably make this again though but change the amount of Lemon juice.

Excellent!! This is definitely a dish that I will make over and over again. I only made minor changes: I fried the chicken in a lemon oil added an additional 1/4c of wine and only 3 TBSP of butter. I did add about 3/4c rough chopped mushrooms those were added to the wine lemon juice and butter. I did put the chicken back in the sauce at then end for it to "soak" up some of the flavors. I served over a rotini noodle....soooo YUMMY!!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I've made it many times but followed one reviewers suggestion and use 1 can of chicken broth to deglaze pan and only use 1/8 cup white wine. It makes extra sauce which is GREAT for topping chicken and pasta. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

delicious simplicity at it's finest!!! like other reviewers the sauce is so delicious i had to double it ok fine -- triple-ish. One tip i've found to improve an already great dish -- when increasing the sauce the sauce increase the wine to 3/4 cup add 1/4 cup of chicken broth and keep the lemon juice the same. fantastic recipe -- thank you!!

I was dubious as I was reducing the sauce and tasting it - wow was it tart! But I trusted the reviews continued on and made it exactly as the recipe states. Winner! Adults and teens loved it kids didn't but I just served their chicken plain. So don't be deterred if you taste this and think it's too lemony while you're cooking. It's perfect with the chicken.

I doubled the recipe as directed and found it tasting too bitter of just lemon. When I added a couple of garlic cloves about 1/4 cup of cream a 1/3 cup of sherry and a little more butter and a tablespoon of sugar it all came together and mellowed out. The flavors then married beautifully! Next time I will decrease the fresh lemon by half to avoid it overpowering the dish. The rating is on the original recipe. I would increase it by a star and a half with additions.

For an A presentation: cook linguine. In a nonstick skillet: Wilt a few hands of baby spinach add 1/2 or more chopped fresh tomatoe - warm - do not "cook". Drizzle olive oil LIGHTLY. Add a couple of crushed or ground fresh garlic cloves (garlic powder works but....). Toss linguini with spinach and tomato. Serve chicken and sauce on pasta preparation. Yum!

Fast easy and tasty. A lot easier than other chicken piccata recipes I've tried. I didn't have white wine so I used red. It looked a little odd but it tasted good. I just used the juice of 1 large lemon that seemed right.

Very fast and easy basic recipe. I added fresh mushrooms after I cooked the chicken then added artichokes when I put the capers in and parmesan cheese at service time. We know this as chicken piccata and love it.

I decided to make this quick/easy recipe this evening. It definitely is easy to prepare; however as written it is lacking more something....perhaps garlic perhaps shallots or something I'm not sure I will make this again since there is another recipe on All Recipes that is similar but it includes artichoke hearts and it definitely has more pizzazz. Just my opinion......but I do love trying knew recipes and usually do them the first time exactly as written..... thanks for sharing!

We liked the sauce a lot but were only so-so on the chicken itself. Overall we enjoyed this recipe but will probably try another next time.

The only thing that I changed was to add diced onions garlic and tomatoes and to cut the lemon juice in half. Other than that it was great.

This recipe is delicious! Double or triple the sauce is the only changes I'd make to this recipe. This will be a family favorite!

This was very tastey. I did think the lemon was a little bit on the heavey side and I love lemon caper sauce on chicken. I will make this again for sure but will cut the lemon juice in half. There should just be a hint of the citrus not the first taste you hit on your pallet. Really good and easy but best of all I can make this with staples in my kitchen. I'll keep you posted on how the reduced amount of lemon goes on future attempts. This would be a total 5 star recipe if the lemon was tamed down a bit. Thanks for sharing. UPDATE: I remade this the other night with less lemon juice. YUMMY!! This is an excellent fast easy dish. Even my kids like it.

WAY too much lemon! I made it twice today. First batch I saw the amtlemon juice and halved to 1/8. Still too much.I corrected that with wine & broth. the 2nd batch I halved it again & it was better BUT I will put less in next time as when it cooks down it gets way too concentrated.. Other than that it was awesome tender & everyone loved it.

The lemon in this was a little overpowering for me but my husband and son loved it! I think next time I'll use a little less lemon juice.

I thought this chicken turned out great! I've made other versions of this recipe before but this one was the best. I altered it a little. I cut the chicken into small peices put it in between 2 peices of plastic wrap and used a rolling pin to flatten out. I marinated the chicken in chicken broth paprika minced garlic onion powder and salt. I cooked it as the directions said. I did add the chicken back into the pan after I cooked the sauce and coated it on both sides. I cooked it on low for a few minutes. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!

SOOOO FAB! and easy! I cubed my chicken and added granulated garlic and pepper to the flour- and doubled the sauce like others suggested. Once I made the sauce I threw the chicken back in and covered while I waited for the pasta to cook- it was SOOO GOOD! The chicken really picked up the flavor of the sauce. I also used a whole jar of capers -drained- because we LOVE LOVE LOVE capers!

Absolutely delicious. The only thing I would recommend is to double the sauce. My family loved it and wants it once a week.

Liked this recipe. However, size of chicken is important to make sure it is cooked through. 3-5 min per side may not be enough. I checked with temperature and cooked a larger piece about 10 min. longer to reach 160-165 degrees.

We will be serving this again.  I made it per the instructions and amounts.  The finale squeeze of lemon at the table really makes this dish pop with flavor.

This dish turned out very well. The only thing I would do is season the chicken a bit more with salt and pepper. Not too much salt though since the capers and lemon add the salty flavor but definitely more than “a pinch”. Delicious overall!
