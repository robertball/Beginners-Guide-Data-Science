I'm not usually a big fan of bread pudding, but this is quite good with the extra flavors of the banana and chocolate.  Did not use the kitchen towel (didn't understand why that was necessary) but I did bake in a water bath.  Mmmm...a drizzle of chocolate syrup on top!

This was my first time ever making bread pudding I followed the recipe to a tee which I found very easy  the bread pudding was very good daughter wanted to eat it all in one sitting :)  but like other viewers I did find the chocolate chips did over power the dish. So the next time I make it I will use less chips and will be trying other ingredients  to it :)

The adults loved it, but the kids gave a thumbs down.  Most likely because it was not super sweet.  The chocolate chips did add some additional sugar, but overall we thought it was an easy to make yummy recipe.

I thought it was too sugary with the chocolate chips and the sweetner together. I would actually go for less sugar to allow the chocolate to stand out in the recipe. Yet, it was so easy, and that's the best thing about it!!!
