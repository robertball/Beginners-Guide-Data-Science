This was really good.  Instead of using cherries I used bananas.  Also, next time I think I would put it in the freezer for like 1/2 hour to firm it up a little bit.

The wipped cream melted in the frige and made a huge mess. And at that point all the fruit was all gross. I don't think I'll every do this recipe again.

There HAS to be something wrong with this recipe.  I followed all the directions and had the same result as another reviewer here- the pie turned into liquid in the refrigerator.  Maybe the recipe should NOT call for canned whipped cream?!?  This was a very dissappointing Valentine's "suprise" for my sweetie.  :(

This pie was so easy to make.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this.  We love fruit in our desserts, so this was perfect.  I'll be sure to make it particularly in the upcoming summer months when this dish will surely be a cool refresher.
