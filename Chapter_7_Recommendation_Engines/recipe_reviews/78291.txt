This recipe just makes sense. A marriage between potato, wheat, and honey.  The perfect homemade bread!  I did have to add aprox 1C extra white flour to make the dough workable, but the texture is amazing as well as the flavor.  Excellent texture, color, aroma.  This bread was light and moist.  In my opinion exactly how homemade bread ought to be.

Excellent bread recipe, will be my go to for wheat bread from now on. Has a great texture, very soft instead of heavy and dense as wheat bread tends to be. My only changes were to use butter instead of margarine, increased the honey to 1/3 cup and I did need extra flour but it's super humid in KC.  Made three big loaves, one of which was gone within a couple of hours.  Used my kitchen aide to do the kneading with the bread hook for 10mins.  For those who said the bread didn't rise well, you might want to alter to steps and proof your yeast with the warm water separately, then add the rest of your ingredients. Also kneading thoroughly makes for better crumb and structure.

i don't like this bread - it tastes okay - but it didn't rise very much and it's so dense - i don't care for the texture... the flavor is okay - i like the honey but i probably will not make this again.

This is the best whole wheat bread recipe I have ever tried.  I did need to add one more cup of flour.  I used bread flour and King Arthur's whole wheat flour.  The bread is moist and has a good flavor.

This is darn good bread! Made it in my bread machine, took it out before the second rise and cooked it from there. Might do a little less yeast next time due to the fact it fell a little in the middle. I'd do a 35-45 minute second rise instead of the hour the recipe calls for. Did 1/2 cup milled flaxseed and only 1 1/2 cup (Bread) flour. Fantastic flavor! Will be great with tonights soup!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I found it to be  ver easy and my family loved it.  The texture made it perfect for sandwiches the next day.  We shared 1 loaf with a neighbor,who is now asking when I'll be making it again.  Definitely recommend trying this one.

This is the best (and easiest) homemade bread recipe!  My nine year old loves to help me make it. It slices up nicely for sandwiches or to just eat with butter--yum!

Great bread.  I didn't need to add any extra flour, contrary to what others have said.  It was such nice soft bread.

This bread required more flour than the recipe called for.  I used about 1 cup more and still had a really soft dough.  The final result tasted pretty good though. I probably won't make this again.

Made this yesterday afternoon. I too had to add an extra cup if not more of flour. I was a little concerned as the dough was still a little sticky and quite heavy but they rose beautifully and the bread was excellent. Will definately be a keeper in our home!  Thanks for posting.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  My daughter loves Potato Bread so I tried this for her.  I did two things differently that absolutely do not take away from this receipe, it's just the ingredients I had.  I keep yeast for bread making so did not use the individual packets and I used oil in my bread instead of margarine.  I came up with two beautiful loaves of bread and I will use this recipe again.    Just a BTW to Pam's review: I have learned that depending on the humidity, the amount of flour can vary even within any yeast bread recipe.  Don't worry about it just keep a little extra flour out and available while you are putting this or any bread recipe together.

What an awesome bread.  Great taste and texture.  I used betty crocker instant creamy butter potatos, butter instead of margerine and I also used an additional cup of white flour in the end.  Absolutely wonderful.

Easy for a novice bread baker and yummy flavor--especially good warm with just a light slathering of butter! It did turn out to be somewhat denser than I expected.  I also liked that it kept well;  I just wrapped it in plastic and it was good for a whole week.

I really love the texture and taste of this bread, but while slicing it half the slices fell apart.  Just seems a bit fragile, so I might decrease the potato flakes next time to see if that's the issue.  Or, I suppose it could be my knife.  Otherwise, loved it.  Light wheat flavor and perfect for sandwiches.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I used it to make hamburger buns.  Very chewy and delicious!  The dough is very sticky but resist the urge to keep adding flour since that will make them heavy.  Once they are on the cookie sheet they bake up perfectly.  Beware...they grow a lot while baking so leave plenty of space!

This bread turned out perfectly, I halfed the recipe and ended up adding about 1 1/2 cups of flour. I mixed and raised it in my breadmaker and then raised it again in the oven where I baked it. Flavor was good, thought it could more honey or maybe some brown sugar.

This recipe was horrible. There must be a mistake.  Even as I poured the liquid into the dry ingredients I noted that it seemed very much liquid.It was impossible to knead and I ended up adding as much flour as I had already used to get a somewhat useable dough.

Without a pan this recipe flattens out. They aren't stiff/strong enough to stand alone as balls or loaves without a pan. But the recipe itself, is FANTASTIC. even my mishapen 'rolls' taste fantastic. The bread is fluffy, stretchy, soft and beautiful. In half of the recipe I added oats and it turned out beautiful. It is slightly hard on the outside and soft on the inside. perfect bread recipe.

Next time I will try more wheat flour and see if it holds as I preffer 100% whole wheat.

I also might invest in some pans!

Pretty easy to make, and turned out really nice.  The top of each loaf got really brown, so I ended up taking it out earlier - but that's probably my oven's fault.  It's about as humid as it gets here in Louisiana, so I might add more flour next time.  It was really sticky, but rose well.  Might try with more honey next time to make it a bit more flavorful.  Good texture, though.

I halved the recipe for just one loaf, and I doubled the salt and added about 1/4 cup extra of whole wheat flour to account for high humidity and too sticky dough. This bread is so soft and fluffy! It also slices beautifully thin for sandwiches.

This is a wonderful blend of potato and wheat and bread flour. The inside is soft which is rare in whole wheat bread. It did get a little too dark on the crust. I'll probably reduce the cook time in the future. Overall, a wonderful whole wheat loaf. Thank you!

I modified the recipe to bake in a one quart cast iron Dutch oven, and I added two tbsp. of chopped onion to top of loaf before baking.  The results were excellent.

I went with a white-flour version of the recipe, replacing all of the wheat and AP flour with bread flour.  I upped the honey to 1/3 cup.  I added an extra packet of yeast.  In addition, I proofed the yeast with a mixture of all the wet ingredients, plus the salt.  

It was a big hit, and the family loved it.  It had a fluffy texture and just enough sweetness to set it apart from an ordinary white bread.
