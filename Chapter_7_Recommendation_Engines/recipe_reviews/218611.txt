This was good but I think it could be better. The beef needs seasoned more in my opinion. The butter/garlic dip is good but it needs more seasoning on it before being grilled. I did grill the tortilla's out of personal preference but that was the only change I made. If you have a grill basket there is really no need to spend the time skewering everything just to unskewer and put into wraps.
