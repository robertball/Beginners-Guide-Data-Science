This was amazing!  Just what I was looking for, and it turned out perfect.  The only thing i did to change it was instead of putting the crackers and butter on top, I used crushed up potatoe chips.  I think they added some extra salt and that I liked.  I would recommend this recipe to everyone!  Thanx!

This recipe is awesomely cheesey! I used a can of cheddar cheese soup instead of the chicken soup, and I added ricotta cheese in with the hash browns too, mmmmm. The crushed Ritz topping is awesome. Thanks for the inspiration! :)

Husband liked it, but the kids and I didn't really enjoy it much.  The sour cream taste came through too much.  I also had to cook it longer than 50 minutes as the potatoes weren't soft enough.

This was a great recipe. I prepared this for my family and wish I could say they were even better the next day, but they didn't last that long.  I didn't have crackers so I took the advice of another reviewer and toped with fried onion chips. I will be making this one again and again.

This was delicious!  A nice change from just regular potatoes or fries.  I served this as a side dish with barbecued meats.  My family really enjoyed it.  Thanks for another great recipe!

Simple to make and delicious.  I did not have any RITZ crackers so I cumbled potatoe chips on top.  Made it for Easter to serve with ham and it was a big hit.

Very good and cheesy recipe!  I added some extra spices just because that's how I like my food (garlic powder, onion powder and some Tony Chachere's for a little kick)!  Next time though I think I may try shredded a potato myself instead of using frozen hashbrowns.
