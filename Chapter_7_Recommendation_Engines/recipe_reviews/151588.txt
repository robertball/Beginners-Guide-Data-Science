I REALLY enjoyed this recipe. I did make a few changes though.
The turkey I bought was a little over a pound. I used 2 Tbs of olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also included minced garlic (I STILL used the garlic powder though. I love garlic). I doubled the cumin and doubled the chili powder. Instead of the Pace Salsa, I used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes. And I didn't use the sugar.

It came out great!!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic. My small picky children loved it. I didn't have the broth so I used water and two chicken cubes instead.

This is a wonderful recipe. 
I followed it as written and had wonderful results. The only thing I had to change was I used red kidney beans, instead of black. I only had the red beans, and the taste was still perfect. 
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good! I made a few minor changes to accomodate our tastes: omitted onion, used fresh garlic instead of powder, upped the amount of cumin, and doubled the amount of chicken broth. Instead of salsa, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes w/ green chilis and 1 can of chili-ready tomatoes. Very good served with a little shredded cheese and dollop of sour cream. Thank you!

Was very tasty, though I felt it was a little runnier than I would have liked. I thickened it with a bit of cornstarch and all was good.  Was very easy and quick to make.  I made with corn muffins, and everyone ate it up!

Once again, my slow cooker came in handy for another soup recipe.  I put the browned meat in with all the spices, beans and corn and cooked on low for about 8 hours.  This was delicious.  Terrific healthy chili!

This was very good, but with some improvements. Deciding to veto the salsa I added in half of a large onion, two cans of diced tomatoes (which didn't quite do it for me so I also included a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste), and added extra chili powder, about three tablespoons total. I also did not add any sugar and cooked it all together in a crock-pot. With the extra chili powder it was very spicy so salt was definitely necessary. A very tasty chili, great for cold nights! The corn and black beans added a great texture and lighter taste to balance the sharper spices in the chili. Would definitely recommend!!!

This was a easy recipe when you are running short on time.  Great on a cold night too!  I suggest adding 2 Tbsp. of chives, it adds a color green to the dish.

This chili has tons of flavor, nice texture, very colorful. We couldn't even tell we were eating ground turkey. It went together very quickly and was ready in no time. The worst thing about it was having to wait until it was cool enough to eat :D.

This was spectacular and SUPER easy.  My wife is vegetarian, and so instead of turkey, I used Morningstar crumbles.  Couldn't tell a difference (well, kinda; ground turkey still would have been better)  ;-)  But, otherwise, didn't change a thing.  It was wonderful.  My one year old loved it, too.  WIll make it again in a heartbeat!!

Great! Very flavorful.  I added a bit of crushed cayanne pepper, and some green chiles and served over rice.  Used frozen corn instead of canned.  I will definitely make this again.

Just made this on Saturday. It was really awesome! I used my slow cooker for the first 2 hrs, but got too hungry to wait, so I cooked it on 2-3 low heat for another 45mins. I also added another half-cup of low sodium broth. Overall, would def make this again.

Made it exactly as the recipe states except for a few items:  used one can of diced tomatoes plus one cup of medium salsa instead of the Pace Salsa, omitted the oil as it wasn't needed and eliminated the sugar.  It was delicious - just enough of a kick to make it yummy but my 5-year old still loved it.  A definite winner!

This is really good! I had to turn it into chicken chili as the grocery store I went to had every ground meat except turkey. Other than that, kept everything the same, except used onion powder instead of onion. I think I also used a bit more of each seasoning; didn't measure. Could use a bit more kick for those who like spicy, but I like it like this!

I had a little more than a pound of turkey and added two tablespoons of corn starch to thicken it as well as topped it with cheese and sour cream.   I also served it with tortilla chips.  It was AWESOME! The flavors melded together wonderfully!! I will most definitely make this again!!!

my kids, husband and me LOVED this dish! Quick easy delish! I plan on adding a can of crushed tomatoes next time just for bulk, but trust me it was excellent with out it! I used 1 sweet and low packet in it instead of the sugar and because i wanted the tomato more predominate I uped the salsa to 1 1/2 cups. Plan on making this again soon!

As with all recipes, I make them the first time without looking at the comments. This is really good chili, and so easy. I'll read the comments before the next time I make it, but at this point I wouldn't change any ingredients. A great recipe. For me, thirty minutes is not long enough to simmer chili. I simmered it for about an hour.

This is a delicous, easy, recipe that my whole family loves.  Excellent topped with a little sour cream, and served with a little corn bread.  Especially during the colder months.  I find myself making this quite often when our schedules are quite full!

LOVED this recipe! I didn't have any chili powder or cumin so I added some crushed red pepper and it gave the perfect kick for me. This has great flavor and was very easy to make, I served this with cornbread muffins and it was delish!

This was delicious, only I added 1 can of crushed tomatoes, and one can diced tomatoes with green chiles. I also put all ingredients in a crock pot after browning the turkey and cooked on low for 8 hours. Fantastic!

Very Good!!!  I had a few changes, some intentional, some not:  I used a clove of fresh, crushed garlic instead of the garlic powder, I didn't have oregano on hand as I thought I did, so that was left out, I also didn't have broth like I thought I did, so I used hot water and bouillon granules (sorry, Campbell's, I know that was your ingredient), and lastly, I used about twice as much salsa as was called for (it came out of the jar faster than expected - oops). This had just the right amount of heat for me - not too much, just a twinge.  Not quite as liquidy as I am used to, so I will probably use even more salsa next time.  Made it with mexican corn bread and it was a perfect meal!  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if we could do half stars.

Ok I'm giving this 3 stars because it's just OK as written but I think it has a lot of potential.  First of all it was way too sweet - I will definitely leave out the sugar next time.  Also, it just seems to be really lacking something.  I recommend adding lime juice, either to the whole batch or as an option at the table for individual servings.

I'm making this recipe again today because it is sooo good.  Here are my tweaks: I don't use any chili powder because I am a spice wimp and I use chicken stock instead of chicken broth to provide a more full flavor.  I would suggest measuring out all your spices, cutting up your onion, and opening/draining the cans of beans and corn before you start cooking.  It just makes it easier.

This is a yummy alternative to classic chili. I ended up making it more of a soup than a chili by adding extra broth. I was out of salsa so I used a can of enchilada sauce. Also used frozen corn. This was good with tortilla chips.

This was a bit hit with my fiance and his Marine buddy who is currently rooming with us.  They couldn't get enough of it.  I modified it to my husband's taste (as he is a very picky eater).  I also doubled the recipe, which made for lots of yummy leftovers. :)  I omitted the beans, because my husband hates beans and instead of the salsa, I used 2 cans of chili ready tomatoes and 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I used real garlic, instead of powder, and I threw everything in the slow cooker and cooked it on low for 8 hours.

My changes to this were minor.  Don't like hunks of tomato, onion, etc in stuff like this so my salsa goes thru the blender, and it was also homemade from a recipe on this site.  And the corn was frozen and not canned, but no biggie.  Anyway, this is better than some of the more recent turkey chili's I've had recently, possibly because the spices were cooked into the turkey, which I think helps the dull flavor of turkey.  But it still wasn't "great" and I felt needed... something.  Perhaps I just wanted more of a kick I don't know.  I could try doubling the spices.  (Side note that I think it's only 6 servings if they are small bowls.)

Delicious!  I didn't have any chili powder on hand, so I substited for 1/2 tsp cayenne.  I used red kidney beans instead of black beans, and chopped tomatoes instead of salsa.

This recipe is GREAT!  I make it once a week.  Makes great leftovers for a quick work lunch.  I leave out the oregano and only use 1 tbsp of chili powder.  I like it best with cannellini rather than black beans.

This was really quite good. My family loved it and everyone had two bowls. It was a bit spicy because I used the Pace salsa w/medium heat I think.  My family always complains that there is never enough meat in Chili....so I added and extra pound of ground Turkey and also one can of Rotel diced tomatoes.  This is a keeper....we will definately eat this again.

This is a great base for a chili recipe!  I made a few changes, one by accident.  
I sauteed the onion and 3 small chopped bell peppers in 1-2 Tbl. Olive oil before adding 1 1/2 lbs. of ground turkey.  After the turkey was almost browned, I added 5 cloves of minced garlic (instead of garlic powder) and the spices (I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and omitted the sugar). 
I stirred those together for about 5 minutes.  
I then added one can of crushed tomatoes (instead of salsa), one can of black beans (drained, but not rinsed), and about a can's worth of frozen corn.  I covered and let it simmer for 30 minutes.
After it was almost done, I looked at the recipe and realized I forgot the chicken broth!  It was a good mistake though.  It would have been too watery had I added it.
It definitely needed salt for flavor, but I would prefer to add that to my own bowl anyway.  I garnished with plain yogurt and cheddar cheese. 

My kids LOVED it!  My son said he'd eat it cold in his school lunch the next day.

This turned out well and my family liked it so much that I made it twice this week.  However, next time I might tone down the chili pepper because it was too much for my preschooler. As per another reviewer's suggestion I omitted the sugar, which could explain why it was too spicy for my daughter.  I know sugar helps take the edge off of spiciness.   I've made it with and without corn and both work well.  The one major difference though is that I used chick peas instead of black beans (because I didn't have any cooked black beans ready).  Next time I will try to plan ahead and use black beans because I imagine that would taste really good.

This recipe is great!  I used 1/2 cup of roasted garlic salsa in place of the Pace and supplemented with a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes.  The taste and consistency was wonderful.  My husband and three year old loved it.  It could use a bit more chili powder for those who like a little more spice and I think I'll throw some diced green pepper in next time.

This was ok. Wish it had more flavor. I even doubled the required seasonings. Also instead of salsa I used one can of diced tomatoes with onions and peppers and a small can of tomato sauce and added Cheyenne pepper. Still not enough flavor! And next time I'll use half the required amount of corn. But ok for a busy night. Served with baked potatoes.

Very quick and easy. I followed the recipe exactly, but I used about 2 cups frozen corn instead of canned. It came out very good. My family liked it. I'm going to double the recipe next time, because it doesn't make a lot, and chili is much better left over.

To make it vegetarian I skipped the turkey, added an extra can of beans, and used veggie broth. Super good recipe. I also like to squeeze a quarter of a lime over the top of the each bowl before serving it.

Yummy! I've prepared this recipe 4-5 times now and it never fails: it takes no time to prep (almost no chopping) and it comes out tasting great every time, plus, it's super healthy. Of course this is nothing like the traditional chili, it's more like a veggie turkey stew, but it's oh so good (it always tastes better then I think it will).  I think I'll go make some tonight! If you want something that's healthy and hearty, you should try it too.

Only made 1 change: used frozen corn in place of canned. This recipe is both quick and delicious. Great with some  homemade cornbread. I was a little surprised that the kids loved it, too. My only complaint: definitely doesn't serve 6, more like 4.

Awesome as is!! I don't rate it unless it is five stars and this to me is 10!! If you like a little thicker chili just add a little cornstarch to some water and mix it in while simmering!! My family devoured it and I am happy that I have a healthier version that is a big hit when I need it!! Awesome with cornbread!! If you can Double this recipe do! It freezes well and is great as leftovers!! Thanks!!

I loved this recipe!! It was really yummy and really filling. Instead of measuring out the spices (chili powder, cumin, ect) I put in about a half of a pouch of taco seasoning. Because that's what I had on hand and reading the back it had many of the same spices that were called for. Plus it made the recipe even easier. It may have tasted a little bit different than the original recipe, but i loved it! Highly recommend!

What a terrific recipe! I substituted the salsa with one 15oz can of diced tomatoes and halved the amount of chicken broth. This recipe would be a great stuffing for vegetables; peppers, eggplant, etc. as well as serve over rice or pasta. Thanks for a healthy and tasty recipe we will certainly be making this one again.

I have made this twice now and tweaked it just a little.  The first time I followed it exactly except for the sugar and onion.  The second time I added a bit more salsa and another can of beans.  It's delicious and my husband loves it.

Good, thick chili.   I changed a couple things.  I cut some fresh corn off a cob and added a yellow bell pepper.  I also used a tables spoon of Vegetable Better Than Boullion instead of the chicken broth.  To make up for liquid, I didn't drain the black beans before dumping them in.   Yum!

Delicious. Inexpensive. And almost TOO easy to make.  Followed the directions for the most part and played with the amount of spices for taste. Since I'm on a healthy kick, I subbed non fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I then spent those hard earned savory fats on generous slices of avocado. 4-Stars for the Base Recipe. 5-Stars after customizing. Your market, of course, may vary.

I loved this recipe.  I made a few modifications to make it spicier for my preference.  I added in a can of petite diced tomatoes, a little bit of tomato paste, and a can of red kidney beans.

My fellas loved this recipe! I made a few variations, no oil and used Herb ox chicken seasoning packet and water instead of broth, added red pepper instead of black pepper and red chili beans with sauce. I used the Publix brand of salsa- fire roasted, black bean & corn (my fellas favorite salsa) all I had on hand.  I did not add any sugar.

Watery.  Had to add a can of tomato paste to thicken it up. Added home made salsa instead of store bought.  Definitely a good start but needed more spice.   I subbed chicken for the turkey and upped the cumin and chili powder. As I said it's a good starting point but not a great recipe as a whole.

This is an amazing recipe!  I added fresh chopped garlic, 1- 6oz can of tomato paste and only 1 can of chicken broth.  I served it with sour cream, habanero cheddar cheese and tortilla chips!  THANK YOU for this recipe!!!

Still in crock pot but it's already 5 star delicious. Pretty much stuck to recipe but added white beans and more broth, and heavy on the spices. Going to let it simmer in the slow cooker all day for this nice chilly fall weather. Great use for ground turkey and pantry items as well. This one's a keeper!

This was very tasty. I don't eat black beans, so I used white instead and it worked very well. I also used frozen corn, and added about a tbs of corn starch mixed with chicken broth to thicken it up a bit about 10 minutes before it was done. I will definitely make it again! It's good paired with cheesy garlic bread.

Very easy and nice flavor.  It is thin, making it more like a hearty soup than a thick chili, I think. I felt it needed a little salt which I added and a touch more sugar and served it with a nice salad and garlic bread.

This is one of our family's favorite recipies.  The last time I made it I didn't have black beans but used chili beans instead.  I was good too!  We always top it off with some cheddar cheese, light sour cream, or crushed up tortilla chips.  YUMMY!

Made this last night. Added 1 sml. can green chilies, 1 jalapeno, chopped, 4-5 garlic cloves, chopped, 1/2 bell pepper, chopped. Substituted frozen corn for canned. Because I didn't make it before adding all the extra ingreds. I can't say how it would have been, but we thought it was really, really good my way.

This is very easy and very good! I omitted the corn, since my husband hates it. The recipe would be great as is, but we like it hot, so I added some extra cumin and chili seasoning to spice it up a bit more.

5 stars. Wouldn't change anything. I thought it might be too spicey for my kids (18 months and 3.5 years) based on other commects, but they wolfed it down! Perfect for all of us.

Yummy! I found out at the last minute that I didn't have any black beans, so I used a can of chili beans. I put a dollop of sour cream on top as well. Fantastic recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used frozen corn not canned. We really enjoyed this, but while cooking I found it to be a little runny.. so I simmered some of the stock off.  Next time and there will be a next, I will reduce the stock by at least 1/2 cup. this is now added to my recipe box, and will become a regular dish at out table

This was a nice addition to my recipe box. My husband LOVED this chili, and he does not like black beans! You can also do this in the crock-pot...I browned the turkey, and then put all ingredients into the crock-pot. Cook on low all day, or on high for 3-4 hours.

This is really good stuff..and figure friendly.  I did make a few *minor* changes.  In place of garlic powder, I used two cloves of minced garlic.  In place of the salsa, I used Hunt's Fire Roasted diced tomatoes(undrained).  I added a 15oz can of tomato sauce, and greatly lessened the amount of chicken broth(about 1/2 cup used).  Oh, I omitted the sugar since it didn't seem necessary.  Topped with shredded sharp cheddar with corn muffins on the side.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!!  I made this two weekends ago.  The entire time my 6.5yr old told me she didn't like chili...I made her try it and she LOVED it!  I made it again this past weekend at her request.  We topped it with sour cream and cheese and I served corn chips.  This is a very easy recipe.  Try it...you won't be disappointed.

I have made this recipe twice. Both times it was amazing. I didn't change anything the second time except that I used 3 cloves fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and also added more chili powder and a bit of paprika. The first time I made it however, I had to make part of it Vegan for someone at work, so I cooked the turkey without the onions and spices and just cooked those things seperately. It was still amazing.I've had people tell me this is the best chili they have ever had.

Was pretty good but I recommend adding a few more tablespoons of chili powder to give it more of a kick. I don't really like spicy food all that much but 4 tablespoons of chili powder was great.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  One of the best chili’s I have ever had.  The only changes that I made to this were substituting olive oil rather than veggie oil and using fresh garlic.  I also let I cook for about an hour and a half on low heat.   The flavors were excellent and it had a little kick to it!  Perfect for a cold day and a superb recipe to share with the family!

My Boyfriend loved this recipe! He had a total of 4 bowls through out the night!This is what we did different b/c I dont really care for salsa and Oregano. Instead of using salsa we used Chili style canned tomatoes and left out the Oregano.

Great chili!  Only revisions I made were a personal preference--no disrespect to the recipe!  Only added 1/2 tablspoon of chili pwd (hubby and 20 month old don't "do" spicy) and I added some shredded carrots (for color and nutrition), lastly I thickened with cornstarch and water at the very end.  Yummy served over rice.  Great leftovers too!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe and added 1 can of 'green chili flavored' diced tomatoes with the liquid, 1 teaspoon of tabasco, 1 chopped green pepper, and 1 chopped jalapeno pepper (seeds removed) for a little added kick.  My dinner guests were amazed with the flavor!  I served it with shredded chedder cheese and blue corn tortilla chips.  Thanks for this great recipe!

With a few modifications, this chili usually gets me a reward at cookoffs!  I use Canola or EVOO instead of the vegetable oil - add a can of diced tomatoes and as another reviewer recommended, doubled the cumin and the chili powder.  With the medium salsa and the extra spices it can be a bit spicy which I love!

I love chili so I add things to it! I use this recipe as the base  then i add my epicure spices ( oh canada,herb garlic and garlic /onion) as well as onions, grn peppers and the asst peppers then I added can black beans,red kidney beans, chick peas, roasted garlic pasta sauce, stew tomatoes (garlic and olive oil) and epicure chili seasoning.   My place smells fabulous! My family loves chili so I try and experiment it all the time.  I know people on here says that we cant rate the original recipe as we add things to it but I dont see why we cant.  I myself tastes the base first and then add my own stuff to it so whats the big deal.  To each their own I guess- I prefer adding stuff to my recipes- gets rid of my can goods or spices etc.  Atleast my place smells awesome thats all it matters- chili is one of our favorites and always will be!

I’ve made this chili as-is and with substitutions. It’s a little runny the way it’s written so we like to add extra chunky salsa. Additionally, I dice 1/2 a diced green pepper and jalapeño, sauté them with the onion for a few minutes, and then add it to the slow cooker. I also add minced garlic and cayenne. I put the black beans in maybe 15 minutes before serving, so they don't become mushy.

Note to self: Next time, I think I will try doubling the recipe with the same amount of meat.

We eat it with tortilla roll-ups. We just put cheese in a tortilla, roll it to about 1 1/2 inches wide and broil it in the toaster oven until it's crisp. They're great to dip in the chili. :)

i absolutely love this recipe. it's so easy and quick, and freezes well. it's one of my go-to's for a busy weeknight dinner. i also love that it's made with turkey for something a little different than your typical beef chili. i always add a dollop of plain greek yogurt, cheese, avocado, and some crunched up Julio's chips. sooo good! even my 19 month old loves it. i usually make it as the recipe states, but have made it with more or less chili powder depending on who was eating. very easy and versatile.

Made this for a chili dinner at work as I pulled the turkey chili. It was very well received and there wasn't any left at day end. I did add extra chili powder and more garlic, but that's pretty much what I do with any chili recipe I follow.

LOVE this recipe!! Only chili I ever make.  I omit the sugar as I think it's sweet enough. I found it too runny for my taste, so I omit the chicken broth and instead add a small can of tomato paste to thicken it up. Instead of salsa, I use a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with pepper, lime and cilantro.  I make large batches and freeze it. Great winter dinner - so yummy!!

This recipe is AWESOME!  I love making this chili!   I do make some changes to suite my taste.  I add a can of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit and cut back on the broth.  It still comes out delicious.

This is my third time using this recipe and every time I make this, I get nothing but raves. The last two times I actually cook this in my slow cooker and it came out even better!  I usually  combine everything in the slow cooker and then cook it on low for 6 to 8 hours and voilà!!  Most recently I used a spicy salsa to add a bit of a kick and I also added some carrots, red pepper and green pepper (I was just clearing out the fridge) but if you have veggies lying around, put them in!  I also really like this recipe because the ingredients are budget friendly and and you can make enough to store in your fridge or freezer to last you all winter.

Delicious and super easy! I added a can of kidney beans too just to add a bit of volume to it. I let it simmer for about 3 hours and then served with grated cheddar.  Will for sure make again!

All kids were happy with it!!  Crushed tomatoes instead of salsa and kidney beans instead of black beans made it more 'chili' like for them.

It was good but seemed to be missing something, salt, and was a little runnier then I would want. AFTER making it as written I added salt, leftover simple roasted butternut squash, from this website, and thickened it. Very good!

Once finished top with a dollop sour cream and shredded cheese!

This recipe is AMAZING. My boyfriend was raving about how delicious it was, and as a bonus, it is SUPER lean and healthy. I used a can of mixed beans instead of black beans (probably doesn't make much of a difference in taste) and used frozen corn, thawed, instead of canned corn (which DOES make a difference, in my opinion. AND I used a few cloves of minced fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder, and brown sugar instead of white. But even without these minor changes, this is a SOLID recipe that is going to make an appearance a lot in my apartment. Guilt-free comfort food.

Tried this recipe. Thought it was great, did alter it some. Added a half of a fresh jalapeno pepper and instead of salsa added a can of chili style tomatoes. Also used two fresh garlic cloves, minced , instead of garlic powder.

Really tasty.  Can't tell its turkey. I used all the ingredients and also I added 1/4 lb of ground pork sausage that I needed to use up, then added a can of fire roasted tomatoes, and a small can of green chilies and 3 kinds of beans, one can of white, black, and a can of chili beans.  So good, my family loves it.

This is more of a soup than chili. It was pretty bland but very easy to make.  Needs something to jazz it up, its a decent starting point.

Wow I had to make so many adjustments to this very bland and watery recipe that what I was left with did not resemble the original recipe. Sorry, but this one lacked flavor. I added tomatoes, more beans, and lots of extra seasonings. If I had tomato paste I would have added it. When I saw the original recipe I questioned why it had so much chicken broth. If you add all that broth it ends up more like a soup, and a bland one at that!

I made this recipe almost as written. I didn't have any salsa, so I substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes, and used frozen corn instead of canned. It was more like a soup than chili, but smelled and tasted very good. I will definitely make it again.

The basic recipe was good, but as always, I changed it up a bit. Instead of the Pace, I found some black bean- corn salsa that I used. I also added some undiluted tomato soup for the consistency. I put it the crock pot, but it looked so good that I had to try it right away. Yum!! I will serve it with rice, tortillas, cheese and sour cream.

This chili was very good, and my whole family liked it a lot. It was easy and quick to make, which makes dinner time during the week much easier. I liked the tad bit of spiciness the salsa gave the chili, but it wasn't too spicy for my young boys (5 and 2) to eat. The leftovers the next day for lunch were even better than the day that I made it. I liked that the recipe called for turkey instead of the traditional ground beef, which made this even healthier for us.

we liked this. i followed the recipe except omitted the sugar. it did come out somewhat watery, so i would agree with the other reviews that adding corn starch would help (mine was past its date so we just ate it as is). if you're not serving this with something salty, you may want to add a little salt. we had it with tortilla chips and it was perfect.

This was very good. I would have given five stars but I changed it per reviews. I did not add the sugar and also added tomato paste because without it was too soupy for our liking. Served it over white rice and added shredded cheddar cheese, dollop of sour cream and chopped green onions to top. Next time I will use half the amount of chicken broth. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I loved it but also made a couple of changes.  Instead of regular black beans in water and salt that I had to drain, I used the entire can of Cuban style black beans for extra flavor and thickness of the liquid that came with it; thus, omitting the broth listed on the recipe.  I also sauteed fresh garlic along with the onions. I do like it a tad bit thicker so I julienned a couple of tortillas towards the end of cooking time to add to the texture and flavor. I served it as is in a bowl and topped it with sour cream, shredded cheddar and sliced green onions.

I added cayenne pepper to make it a little spicier, and only used about a half cup of broth (which was still a little too much). It turned out great. Good with rice or ramen noodles too. Someone recommended lime, and i'd agree, otherwise omitting the sugar and/or adding extra chili powder. I did taste it before adding the sugar, and it was great. It seems the sugar killed all the good flavors, and really changed the taste (which was why I added the cayenne & extra chili powder afterwards). I see many chili recipes with sugar, so i guess it's just preference. Still a great healthy & quick recipe.

This was a good base for a turkey chili.  I did make some of the suggested changes.  I used only 1 tablespoon of chili powder, added chopped garlic instead of garlic powder, added a can of rotel tomatoes and even added a can of tomato paste because I found it to be way to runny for a chili.  the tomatoe paste thickened it up to a better consistency.  has a lot of kick.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some holiday leftovers, and this one did the trick, with the following modifications: Omit ground turkey. Add 1 cup each cooked, diced turkey and cooked diced ham in step 2 before bringing to a boil. Used about a cup of leftover corn instead of canned. I served in a bowl over some leftover mashed potatoes and topped with a bit of shredded cheddar.

Delicious! I changed a lot though. I seasoned the meat as I would season any other. Used black and kidney beans rinsed. Can of corn. And 2-3 jars of salsa. That's it. My family loves it with crackers or cornbread!

This recipe was delicious, as with any chili it was definitely better the next day.  Also it makes quite a bit so I ended up freezing some.  I only made a couple changes, I cooked it in the crockpot for my convenience. I also used diced tomatoes instead of salsa, I added white beans as well as the black beans, and I left out the sugar. I will definitely be making that again.

Good flavor.   I needed to use tomato paste to thicken the base, even after training the beans and the corn.  My family thought that there was too much corn, may use 1/2 can next time.

The chili came out really good.  I used olive oil (which I always do).  I was a little nervous about the salsa so I used stewed tomatoes instead and I didn't have any cumin.  It looked pretty watery so I put in about 1/2 C of salsa.  Based on a comment I added some cornstarch to thicken the chili but it didn't work much.  Definately recommend adding a can of tomato paste which worked perfectly.  Also after reading about cumin being a key ingredient in southwestern chili and got some and added liberally.  I let it sit on low heat for 2 more hours (after the recommended 30 min) to let the flavor soak in.  Served with cornbread and delicious! Next time I will add cayanne pepper and probably half the sugar as it was a little on the sweet side for me.

I have a vegetarian in the family and was looking for a hearty veggie dish..this was awesome!  I used soy-rizo in place of turkey and nobody could tell! I would recommend for anyone cooking soy-rizo, fry it up separately & add it at the very end of the stew's simmer, so it doesn't expand and lose the "ground meat" texture.

This was my first time making a turkey chili and this recipe turned out very good. My whole family loved it!  I am not a fan of onions so I added half a red onion instead of what this calls for since my family like onions. And I like thick chili so I did add a very small can of tomato paste to a double recipe and it was perfect. All around excellent recipe!

My husband made this today and it was incredible.  We didn't have ground turkey, but we had some 97/7 lean ground beef which was a great substitute.  He also did as others recommended and doubled the chili powder and cumin along with the addition of a clove or two of fresh garlic and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. The whole house smelled amazing and the chili was incredible! We'll be making this again!

This is a great and easy recipe.  As usual, I do make some changes like I don't add the sugar, use a little less chicken broth, and add more of the given spices and extra spices such as red and cayenne pepper (we like it spicy!).  Otherwise,  I follow the recipe exactly and it is always a hit, especially since it is beef free!

This was pretty good, but I did make some changes. I added a can of tomato sauce, and used less chili powder since the little mouths at our house can't handle all of that spice. I also used 3 cloves of minced garlic in place of the garlic powder and added a can of tomato sauce and a can of kidney beans. Also, I just used chopped up leftover turkey instead of ground turkey. My husband says it is one of the best things I've ever made! I have to agree - it was delicious!

I made this for lunch today and everyone loved it, even kids. The only changes I made were to use 1-1/2 cups of chicken broth and mango/peach salsa (what I had on hand). The chili was thick enough for us. I served it with shredded cheese, sour cream, hot sauce and tortilla chips. I agree with the reviewer who said that 4 servings was more accurate than 6, although if it's served with some corn bread it might go further. We'll definitely be having this again!

This came in handy when I needed to get rid of a pound of ground turkey! Everything else needed I already had! I did add another tbsp of chili powder and even sprinkled some cayenne in towards the end, but we like spice. I also added a tbsp of minced garlic in addition to the garlic powder. But we also love garlic. All in all I really like this recipe. Super easy and great with corn bread or those chili Fritos sprinkled on top. Yum!

I love this recipe, I follow it exactly every time and it is DELICIOUS! If it seems a little thin i just cook without the cover for a few minutes to cook some of the liquid out. I top it with a spoonful of fat-free greek yogurt for a low fat meal :)

This was an excellent recipe and a good way to utilize leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I did not deviate from this recipe at all and it turned out great.  Not too spicy but just right.  Great on a cold night.

fabulous recipe as is.  second time i made this i doubled the recipe but added ground venison for my second pound of meat, used canned diced tomatoes instead of salsa and added a bit more chili powder and cumin than was called for and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and frozen corn.  it was great.  all three of my young children love this chili.

Pretty good. I usually have these ingredients on hand. The only change I made was an additonal can of fire roasted tomatoes. I think some tomato paste would have also been a good addition as it was pretty thin.

This recipe is a great way to enjoy ground turkey.  My husband and I really enjoyed this with a little shredded cheddar, sour cream, and tortilla chips on top.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

I used two tablespoons of minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I browned the meat with the onion/spices and then placed it in the crock pot and added all the rest of the ingredients.  I cooked it on low for the day.  Very, very good chili!

If we could give this a 3 1/2 we would.  We gave it a little boost because the leftovers were great.  I was a little upset it never really thickened up.  It was a little soupy. I cooked it just as the recipe said, but it just stayed as a liquid.  We paired it with honey cornbread muffins and it had great flavor.

This has become a staple in our household. We eat it almost once a week and it is always delicious! I follow the recipe to the letter, although I use whichever salsa I have on hand. Soooo yummy and easy to throw together! Thank you!

Sensational recipe! I had to finally write a review for this recipe which I found just a couple of months ago and have made several times since. This recipe has worked great for parties and as an easy lunch or dinner option. My entire family loves it! In addition to what the recipe calls for, I brown the turkey with 3 chopped cloves of fresh garlic and about 2 tbsp. of chopped green peppers.  I use a can of either diced tomatoes or stewed tomatoes in place of the salsa, and since I usually don't have chili powder around, I tend to make it with a little taco seasoning (I think it works even better!). I serve it with a side of brown rice, or in a bowl over some pasta. Really simple and really DELICIOUS!!!

Excellent, easy, and efficient chili recipe. This is perfect for a quick meal that will provide ample leftovers. I made it to recipe this time, but next time (and there will definitely be a next time), I plan to add some peppers and maybe some tomatoes. Yum!

This was a great recipe.  I added probably another whole cup of broth because I thought it looked too chunky, and I'm glad I did because it was the perfect consistancy after I let it simmer.  I served with crushed tortilla chips, sour cream and shredded cheese.  My husband loved it.  This has earned a spot in our dinner rotation.

This recipe was delicious. My husband and I both enjoyed it because it's very flavorful and using turkey instead of beef really cuts the fat. It's very easy to make also. It's a keeper!!

This was a very easy and flavorful recipe. Most of the items are easy to keep stocked in the pantry. It was evenly spiced, but not spicy, so even my two picky eaters liked it. I did some slight modifying, based on other reviews. I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil, increased the cumin to 1 1/2 teaspoons (for the standard 6 servings), used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, canned chili-ready tomatoes in place of Pace salsa, reduced the sugar to 1/2 tablespoon, used frozen instead of canned corn and topped with cheese, sour cream and a bit of lime juice. I left the lid off for the last 20 minutes, so it wouldn't turn out too soupy as some reported. Well worth making, this will become a standard for our family. Thanks!

I LOVE this chili!!  It's so delicious, you can really tweak it any way you want and it will turn out great.  I substituted the salsa for diced tomatoes, added dashes of extra spices here and there and voila!  Delicious!  Throw on some black olives, green onions and a dollop of sour cream to your bowl, grab a piece of cornbread and you're in heaven.

This is absolutely the best chili I've ever eaten or made!  I've made it twice now and both time my hubby and I are raving over it!  It is a spicy dish and not for the faint of heart; however, if you like spice...hold onto your hat cuz' this recipe will blow you away with how good it is!  For a little extra kick, I add in 1-2 TBLS of jalapeno juice and several diced up jalapeno peppers that I cook in with the turkey, onion and spices in the 1st step.  I love the added flavor it gives the dish as well as just a little extra kick!  Kudos to whomever came up with this recipe!  Thank-you!

Very good. Only change I made was adding some chopped grape tomatoes and a several drops of hot sauce, which made it spicy, but not too hot. Served it topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was very simple to make.  I was looking for something quick with the key ingredient being Ground Turkey.  I was surprised to find that I had all the ingredients at home except the cumin powder.  The recipe was quick, easy and delicious BUT I did have to thicken it up some (used regular flour to thicken) because according to the recipe it was a bit runny.  I made white white to go with it.  Delicious!

This recipe is delicious! I've made it many, many times and it's been requested often by my husband. I do add minced garlic while the turkey is cooking as well as garlic power when I add the rest of the ingrediants. Also, I tend to just dump the whole jar of salsa in it rather than measuring it and it turns out great! I definitely recommend this recipe. And the best thing about it is that's it's healthy!

VERY tasty... sweet and flavorful.  However, we feel it needs a little more salt, garlic and beans. Some minced or crushed tomato would have been a good addition.  Great healthy version and one we will enjoy again with the added ingredients above. We used olive oil instead of vegie oil and we also added a diced green pepper.

I followed this recipe exactly. The chili wasn't very flavorful in my opinion. I think it would have been better with some tomato sauce and/or diced tomatoes. I do like the texture of ground turkey rather than ground beef though.

I loved this recipe! The only change I made was adding minced garlic and a little more garlic powder and I did not use the vegetable oil or sugar.  I also topped it with shredded cheese and sour cream and served it with whole grain tostito's.  Scrumptious! I will definitely be making it again!

This has become my new favorite chili recipe.  I did make a few changes that I think enhance the flavors... I used fresh minced garlic in addition to some garlic powder.  Instead of the salsa, I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and I also added a can of pinto beans with jalepenos in addition to the black beans.  If you like spicy chili, the pinto beans with jalepenos are a really nice addition.  I didn't add sugar because I didn't think it needed it.  Also, after cooking the chili, I like to thicken it by mixing corn bread mix (like Marie Callendars) and water.  After creating a paste like mixture, I add it to chili and stir until it becomes the consistancy that you like.

I made this because I happened to have all the ingredients on hand, AND it looked good.  I followed the suggested ingredients exactly, but placed everything in my slow cooker.  Put on high at first, but then set to low when I noticed it was simmering.  Kept at low for about 3 hours while I was fixing meals for other nights, and then I finally sat down with a big bowl of it (along with a Jiffy mix cornbread muffin I threw together really fast)...very nice! (I won't add sugar next time around, the corn provided plenty of sweetness).

Fantastic! This is easy,satisfying, and quick to put together. I didn't have corn, so I used some left-over white rice and it became a one-dish meal.  Using Rotel in place of the salsa and adding fresh cilantro (as other reviewers suggested)gave this a fresh and delicious flavor.

the picture was nice, but it was horrible.  My husband and nephew agreed it looked like something they'd feed their dog.  I appreciated the recipe because it used ingredients I had on hand.  I was really looking forward to it, but this isn't quality food.

Love it.  This was so easy and fast.  The only change I made was to add a can ot diced tomatos.  My husband said it was even better than the chili he gets at a local restaurant.  I ran the calorie count on this and it is about 300 calories per serving.

This was the first chili I've ever made, and I was surprised how easy it was!  I didn't have any garlic powder on hand, so I minced one whole garlic clove instead which I added at the same time as the onions.  I also only had a half-cup of salsa, so I added a whole tomato to fill in the remaining half-cup.  Overall, it turned out great - by boyfriend loved it and had seconds right away.

Great recipe - it has some kick, so if you don't like things spicy, only add about half of the amount called for and go from there or it may be too much for you.

I made this exactly as written except I reduced the chili powder to a scant 1 T (I don't like it spicy) and I omitted the cumin.  It is wonderful and so easy.  I have made it twice within the past month, and it freezes beautifully.  Thanks for a fantastic, healthy recipe.

I made this tonight for the first time and my husband and I loved it!  I took others' suggestions and added a little corn starch to thicken it up a bit, and it was perfect.  I served it with corn bread and look forward to having leftovers tomorrow for lunch!  :o)

Great recipe. My first try at a Chili and it turned out great. I used oregano powder instead of leaves and next time I would used the leaves because I think it added a little more saltiness to the chili. Very good recipe. I will make this again.

This turned out fabulous. I took others' suggestions and added celery, cornstarch to make it thicker, and my own personal additions of fresh tomatoes. I felt like it needed something else - so I added a bit more sugar and some salt. Overall though, the flavor is great because it's not too heavy but also far from bland. The perfect chili. Thanks!

I love this chili! And its SO EASY. Every time I make it (and its always a double batch), there are never any leftovers! And I'm only cooking for 4 people! I definitely go back for seconds. This chili is awesome on a cold evening with some warm corn bread. I use Trader Joe's canned sweet corn. I also love Splenda, so I use the granulated Splenda to save the sugar calories. Don't forget the reduced fat cheddar cheese and non fat sour cream! (yes, NF sour cream. Look for the carton that has the black and white cow labeling---they'll never know its fat free!)

This was a real winner at our dinner table! I did add a few things though (none of them change the flavor of this dish). I added some diced tomatoes and tomato sauce for a little more body. We loved this! Perfect!

I made this tonight for the family and they loved it.  I used regular salsa (not chunky) and added some extra tomatoes.  It was healthy and great with some freshly toasted bread.

Quick, easy and delicious!
I added kidney beans to the recipe and garnished with fresh cilantro, and sharp cheddar cheese. 
My family thought this was great!  
I added cooked elbow macaroni to the left overs and everyone enjoyed it!
The next time I make this recipe I would eliminate the sugar because the corn added enough sweetness.

Made it for dinner tonight! Very simple and easy! I would leave out the sugar though. The natural sweetness of the corn is plenty enough but even with the sugar in it it was great! My husband loved this and he's not a huge fan of corn. It was very filling with a rich, full flavor.

I made this last week for my husband and his grandma. It was delicious! I put the leftover in a baking dish, put cornbread batter on top (from a boxed mix) and baked it for about 30 minutes or so until the top was golden brown and a knife came out clean. It was great both times!

This is pretty good.

Did not use as much chili powder as the recipe called for.  
Used half of a 15 oz can of black beans and about 3/4 of a 15 oz can of white beans, drained and rinsed.
Used home made salsa and about a half cup more than the recipe originally called for.
Used brown sugar as well.

Easy and quick.

This one is a definite keeper!  The changes that I made were:  using canned hominy (rinsed) instead of corn,  using seasoned canned black beans, using a Fire-Roasted salsa that we buy at Costco, and adding a bit of Corona beer.  I love this recipe because I was able to make it without a trip to the store.

Very good.  I only had picante salsa, so in the future I would add diced tomato...but overall it was very good.

This chili was very tasty. I did, however, changed it a little bit, only because I had to work with what I had on hand. I used ground chicken instead of turkey, sub. fresh chopped garlic for the powder, used 1 can of chopped tom. with chilis in replace of the salsa, a little red wine, and used creamed corn. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, I have to say, it was very good. I made it the night before, so the flavors could develop.Healthy.

Great recipe!  I made this the night before we ate it and just stuck it in a crock pot to cook all day.  Very filling, and not too spicy!

very easy.  My five year old and three year old gave me an ovation!  Haven't had one in a while.  Don't need to change a thing.

I loved this recipe. I used fresh sweet corn instead of canned corn. Next time I make it, I will add tomato paste and fresh tomatoes to thicken it up, the chicken broth is good for flavor but I wanted it thicker. I used more salsa than the recipe called for (I used 1.5 cups) I put cheese on top and ate with tortillas. The best chili I've had!

This was really, really good -- I used white beans instead of black because it was all I had, but the salsa I used was black bean and corn salsa.  I served it with corn muffins and it was gone in minutes!

This was good. I think it could use alittle more spice. Not sure if it should be hot but something that really gets your pallette.

Excellent as is!  Very easy to make and healthy, too!  The only changes I made was I didn't put oregano in because I didn't have any on hand.  Also used reduced sodium chicken broth.  I put in some cornstarch dissolved in water towards to end to thicken it up a bit.  Served with green onions, cheese, and tortilla chips.
