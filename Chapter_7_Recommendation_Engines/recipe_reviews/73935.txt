I love cucumber salads and I love vanilla yogurt, but I just couldn't bring myself to use the vanilla yogurt in this recipe because the brand I have on hand is a little too sweet (perhaps because it's fat free and gets it's sweetness from an artificial sweetner). I opted to use plain yogurt instead and a bit of sugar to taste. This recipe didn't specify what type of onion, so I used green onion because it's subtle. I sliced the cucumbers thin and left the skin on as I usually do with cucumber salads. Overall, pretty good.

I really like this salad. I did make a couple of changes.  I used plain yogurt, not vanilla and I roasted the garlic before adding it to the salad. I also sprinkled the top with chives and more dill before serving.

I tried this recipe out on some guests that came over and ended up regretting it.  The yogurt gives the dressing a strange sweet edge.  If I had to do it again I would substitute something savory in place of the yogurt.  I just don't think of cucumber salad as sweet.

Just perfect!  LOVED the flavor.  I stuck with the recipe as posted, then added a few bacon crumbles on top.  I salted and drained the cucumbers for 3 hours before making up the salad.  This makes the cucumbers very crunchy.  Also they don't drain into the dressing to dilute it.

I opted to use plain yogurt and this turned out great.  Very much like tzatziki sauce.  After reading through some of the reviews, I started thinking about vanilla flavored yogurt.  It seems to me that today's flavored yogurts are very sweet and some brands of vanilla yogurt are really more like a custard dessert.  It's not like the plain vanilla yogurt that you used to buy that was only slightly less offensive than plain yogurt.

The vanilla yogurt seemed to give it an odd flavor. Salad was edible, but not something I'd make again.

I really liked this! I opted not to peel my cucumbers and used fresh dill. Great flavor, similar to Tzatziki without the bite, and a subtle hint of sweetness from the yogurt. Very good, thanks!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but this didn't seem to have much flavor. It also didn't hold well in the fridge because it got watery after sitting for just a couple of hours. If I make it again, I will probably tweak the recipe a bit and not make it until right before I'm ready to serve it.

The yogurt in this recipe adds an interesting sweetness.  Since I didn't have onion, I used onion salt in place of the regular salt, and next time I would thinly slice the cucumber rather than dicing.  All in all, not bad.

Very easy, semi-healthy and delicious!  Got rave reviews and if you run the peeled cucumbers through the food processer (slice), it's almost no fuss!

No thank you... I made it exactly as written. My family has a cucumber salad recipe that calls for mayo/ vinegar/ sugar / onion salt / celery salt as the dressing so I thought this might be close with the sweet/tangy combo or vanilla yogurt & sour cream... I have to say (IMO) it wasn't even edible.

Very good side salad. I read other reviews and made the following changes: wash and cut my cucumbers and tossed salt on them and refrigerated them for a couple hours. Def much better the next day after all the favours run through. A keeper forsure.

This is very tasty and light.  I don't care for raw onions and garlic so I substituted 1 tsp. onion powder and 1 tsp. garlic salt and omitted regular salt.  I only had 2 cucumbers on hand so I used the other half for a vegtable dip for carrot sticks, celery sticks, etc. which was very good. I will definately make this again.  I think it will be especially good on a hot summer day!

I had to make a few adjustments, but it turned out delectable. I used low fat plain Greek yogurt instead of vanilla, salted and drained cucumbers first like another reviewer suggested, completely minced the onion in a food processor, and added roughly a tablespoon of rice vinegar. The vinegar cut out the yogurty after taste I'm not a big fan of.

This cucumber salad tastes just like the cucumber salad my grandmother used to make!  I've been looking for this recipe for a long time.  I love the way it tastes just as written.  Gets watery but I just keep draining.  Great side dish on a hot summer day.  Nice and light.

I made this for my wife, paired with roasted potatoes and pan-cooked tilapia filets, and she loved the stuff. She ate two helpings, and only stopped because she was stuffed. Personally, I think it needed more salt, and maybe a bit more seasoning in general. For me it was a 3 recipe, while my wife thought it was a 5.. hence the 4 rating.

I changed several things to make the salad tastier and healthier. Low fat ingredients have much higher carbohydrates, and the artificial ingredients in vanilla yogurt are just not good for you. So, I used regular plain yogurt and sour cream (Daisy has no additives). I scored the cucumber skins with a fork and made thin slices--very attractive--and minced the onion. Doing that made a superb, very low carb salad! The rest of the salad is an excellent basis!

I didnt notice that the recipe called for vanilla yogurt, so I used what I had on hand, plain nonfat yogurt  with regular Daisy sour cream. Salted and drained the cucumbers and added a couple stalks of celery with the onion. Great crunchy side salad for summertime.

I have made this many times, but I never, ever use low fat anymore - fat doesn't make you fat and it ruins any food you do that to. Eat less, don't buy diet food. FYI. Likely you've known this already and it's older - I used to use diet too, unless my husband clued me in.

I've made this several times. I use plain lowfat Greek yogurt (not vanilla). I now add 4 tsp apple cider vinegar, crumbled feta cheese, and I top it with fresh chives and a couple of shakes of paprika. Unless I'm making it for a crowd, I find that making the dressing and only adding the cucumbers when we're ready to eat is the best way to eliminate the watery aspect of cucumbers. The leftover dressing will keep a couple of weeks in the fridge this way and the flavor intensifies. Only add cucs when ready to eat - that  is the way to go.

The vanilla yogurt really throws the flavor out of whack on this one. We’ll try it again with regular yogurt and see how it turns out.

I liked it but it was very rich! I will make it again but I will use regular yogurt instead of the vanilla. It's a perfect dish to introduce children to cucumber salad.

I love cucumber salad but I did not care for this recipe. 
I didn't care for the vanilla yogurt, which I'm not partial to anyway, but it could  have been the brand of yogurt I chose to use because it was one of the only vanilla I could find. I doubt I will be making this recipe again.

Used low fat sour cream (it's what I had) and added onion and garlic powder. Served with a chicken avocado basil salad. Delicious!

No changes... i don't like cucumbers or yogurt and i truly enjoyed this AS IS.  Only recommendation is to make it and serve it soon after..  it does get watery.

Very tasty!!!  Peeled and cut the cucumbers a couple hours earlier, added salt and let some of the water drain out. Change up the recipe after reading all the reviews. Used fat free French vanilla yogurt, fat free sour cream, 1 tsp of onion powder, I tsp of garlic powder and 1 tbs spoon of tastefully simple dill mix. Taste was a bit odd so I added 1 tbs of distilled white vinegar and was perfect. Added salt and pepper to season. Felt not quite enough dill so added about a 1/2 tsp more and YUMMY! Will make again for sure!

I don't feel like I can give this recipe 5 stars since I made some changes, but the base was a great starting point. I substituted plain fat-free Greek yogurt in place of the vanilla yogurt, 1 tsp onion powder instead of the diced onion, and 1 tsp garlic salt in place of the minced garlic. Lastly I added just under 1 tbs of sugar to cut down on some of the sourness of the Greek yogurt. I chopped the cucumbers and made the dressing the night before my potluck, but I kept the dressing in a separate bowl in an effort to avoid soggy cucumber slices. The next morning, I mixed everything together and by lunchtime the flavors had all come together without any sogginess. Very good & will make again.
