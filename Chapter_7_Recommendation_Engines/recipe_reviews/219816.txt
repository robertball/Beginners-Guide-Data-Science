I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, a pinch of salt, 1 tsp vanilla and instead of nuts 1 cup mini choco chips. Best banana bread ever.

This is hands down the BEST banana nut bread recipe I've found online. I've been experimenting with banana bread recipes for years, and I'm so SO glad I found this one!! Sometimes, I add in 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, but it's fantastic with or without them.

Soooo yummy!! I switched it up a bit and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp salt and 3 tsp cinnamon. I also sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon on top of the bread before I baked it...the bread comes out beautifully with a great crunchy crust. This is a delicious banana nut bread recipe!

Although this banana bread has a beautiful appearance, i.e. browned very nicely, rose perfectly & looks very professional (see my attached photo), it is lacking in taste. It has a rubbery consistency, not much taste, and surprisingly, the cream cheese & butter added nothing to the taste.

My kids ate it hot, right out of the pan; said it was the best they've ever had!  We had three darn-near rotten bananas on hand so I used them all.  I also took feedback from the others and added a little salt and vanilla and then sprinkled the top with cinnamon.  One thought the crust was a little crisp, so maybe I'll just cook it for an hour next time.

Thanks for sharing your awesome recipe.  :-)

Best BNB ever.  I added 1/4 C sour cream & 1/4 C fage yogurt. Made it super soft. I've made this recipe 4 times in 2 weeks.

First time making banana bread! It was so easy! And it came out very yummy--except the bottom burned a little. I left it in the oven for only an hour, versus the suggested 1 hr 15 mins, but it still burned. I also used half the proportions of the ingredients because I only had one banana. I added Philadelphia Cream Cheese...I don't know if that is the same cream cheese this recipe meant. I also added almonds and dried fruits because I didn't realize we ran out of walnuts. And everything else, followed the recipe! It was so easy, I am going to do it again with the chocolate chips I have!

I did it today as my attempt to make bread for the first time and it came out splendid. I added 1 tbsp of vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of cinnamon  as well as sprinkled some cinnamon  on the top of the batter once it was in the pan.

Made this recipe today and the only thing I added was vanilla. I also used whipped cream cheese instead of regular because cream cheese and walnuts were the only ingredients I didn't have on hand. I didn't want to have to wait for the cream cheese to soften. I made sure I took out a stick of butter early this morning when I first woke up. My first time making banana nut bread and I'm proud of it! It smelled so good even while I had it in my mixer!

Thank you for sharing this incredible recipe.  I made this for home and for one of my teachers and it was loved and gone quickly.  So easy to make and instead of sugar I used splenda and it turned out wonderfully.  It is absolutely delicious.

Took the challange and for being the first time baking, I gave my selfe a pat on the back.
My friends daughter took the loaf to her attortney office were she works and told the coworkers, she made it.
The loaf was a rave in the office, and there are more projects in the works before the year is over such as Avocado Cheese Pie that I just  finished 2 allready.

I made this banana bread for my neighbors for Christmas. One of my neighbors asked for the recipe. I made it again just recently and my whole family told me how good they thought it was. Bravo on this recipe.

Absolutely perfect!! I also made it with 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar and tsp of vanilla extract. My family thinks I am pretty cool. The cooking time was a little less also but I used a bunt cake pan. First try = success!  Will try chocolate chips next! Thank you for the recipe!

Wow! This was so moist and it had a nice dense yet fluffy texture. I will absolutely switch out my current recipe and make this my go to. The only thing I did different is added some pecans in with the walnuts as my husband is a nut freak :)

I have made this a few time and I have never had any complaints...only request to make more. I am not a fan of walnuts, so I replaced them with pecans. I really like the crusty to. Great recipe

I had really ripe bananas, but no buttermilk, so searched for a recipe without that.  This was an excellent recipe.  I was in a hurry and did not soften the cream cheese enough, so it ended up with tiny pieces of cream cheese in it but when it baked, they disappeared.  Like other reviewers, I used brown sugar, but I used brwon sugar blend by Splenda and because I had 4 bananas, I used 4.  I think this is a recipe that can be tweaked many ways and still turn out great!

It was so good.  I had to use shortening as I was out of oil but it was still fabulous.

I made this recipe. I added toasted walnuts and cream cheese chunks to the batter. I also used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  It was a hit.

This is amazing! I used 3 bananas, added 1/4C chocolate chips,  2T vanilla, and used 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar. Perfect! *SECOND ATTEMPT:* Made same as comment above minus the chocolate chips. Also added 1T cinnamon and a dash of each: nutmeg, ground clove, and allspice. My husband and I liked this better. My 13yr old son, not surprisingly, likes the addition of chocolate chips better. Oh, also learned today that "whipped" cream cheese works just as well.

I cut back the 1/4 cup of flour, and cut the baking time by 10 minutes. I also added a half cup of chocolate chips and decreased the walnuts and it turned out delicious.

This is it !  This is 'The One"   Worked wonderfully as large sized muffins as well.   No changes made.  Pulled out at 1 hour and 5 minutes.  (elevation 5,000),   I have tried many good tasting recipes but this has the perfect texture as well.   Oh.... I did throw a few chocolate chips on the top, more for presentation.  Recommendation for any banana bread recipe.... don't over mix when adding flour.  I used a mixer until it's time to add the dry ingredients, then I fold/mix by hand.

I followed Abigail's advice and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of salt. However, I went with the walnuts as the original version suggested instead of chocolate chips-- and I loved the blend of flavors. Another thing, it browned really fast in my oven. But that just might be my oven. I had to take it out about a half an hour before it was done and cover it with foil so the outside wouldn't burn. I found the inside still had to cook longer because of a more custard-like texture due to the cream cheese. But once it was done, it really was the best banana bread me or my family had ever had!

An excellent recipe, and very close to what my Mom used to bake during the holidays !!   Thanks for helping to bring back great memories!!    Also,  I used 3 bananas (I like bananas..), and added a ½ cup of chopped cashews to the first loaf,  and a week later added a ½ cup of chopped pecans to the second loaf!!   They were both delicious !!

1 hour 15 minutes was too long.  Dry and not a whole lot of taste.  If I made it again maybe an extra banana and not so long in oven. Maybe go with a few of the suggestions to add flavor.

This recipe makes a pretty substantial loaf. I think my pans were too small because it overflowed.  We ate the overflow with butter as soon as it came out of the oven. So yummy! The outside is crusty but the inside is moist and really good. Love this one for sure!

Very good.  I added some salt an extra banana because I had 4 that were super ripe and I always  put a half teaspoon of almond extract in my banana bread.

Great recipe!  We made this Saturday evening. We modified the ingredients by adding an additional 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla and 3 bananas instead of two. We also used to loaf pans and asked them for 60 minutes. Both loaves were moist and very tasty. We finished both pans in 3 days. We will definitely make this recipe again!!!

Great recipe!  I also did 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown, added an extra banana, some vanilla and salt.  I made four small loaves and baked them for 50 minutes. Perfect, moist, and delicious!

I added a glaze that just sets this recipe apart from all the other banana  bread recipes.  The glaze is 1/2 banana,  1/8 cup cream cheese, powdered sugar, then to get the right consistancy add pineapple orange juice.

I make this all the time. Crowd pleaser! If I have it on hand, I will add a dollop of sour cream or yogurt to make it more moist.

It was tasty, but next time I make it I'll add cinnamon & nutmeg.  It looks fantastic, coming out of the oven and smells delicious.  You do have to be really careful not to over-bake it.

Best banana nut bread ever!  We prefer pecans to walnuts, but the cream cheese makes this so incredibly moist.

THE RECIPE USES THE SINGULAR FORM OF THE WORD PAN, IN TE BEGINNING, AND AT THE VERY END THE PLURAL, NOT NOTICING THIS, THE END RESULT IS A BIG MESS IN MY OVEN

Made this tonight and my family loved it! I wouldn't change a thing.  I have been looking for a good recipe for this bread and this is it.

Love it!  I followed it as written but had to adjust baking time since I had a smaller loaf pan and had a mini loaf too!  Was thinking of adding some raisins next time --
