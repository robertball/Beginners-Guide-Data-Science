Excellent, especially for those who don't like the sweetness of sweet pickle relish.

we  used this sauce as a dip for deep fried catfish fingers. This is better than regular homemade or store bought tartar sauce. I would make this again!

I love tartar sauce made with dill pickle relish!  I mix up the ingredients after mayo and relish.   My staple is fajita seasoning, splash of worchestershire, splash of lemon juice and dash of sea salt.  But any combination with mayo and dill makes a great tartar!

I changed the quantity of mayo and adjusted everything else for less volume and it came out very well.  We put it on some lemon fried tilapia and it was great.  The egg and dill pickle make the recipe rock.  Planning on having fried perch with this next week.  Thanks

I swapped the egg for some white pepper, but the rest went into it and I gotta say, probably the best tartar sauce I've had in a long time.
