I’m surprised these don’t have more reviews!  These are really good. I participate in a cookie exchange every year and everyone always hopes I make these again. I have actually rolled them out and used cookie cutters on them too rather than form the dough. I find that works well. Not sure what happened with the 1 star reviewer on here but I imagines they did not include the almonds or did not chop them fine. I chop my almonds in blender or food processor basically until it is like a flour. That makes up a significant part of the dough. Maybe they missed that part.

Amazing recipe. I added an extra tsp of almond extract because I love the taste of almonds. I also didn't use a measuring cup for the confectioners sugar amount, I did it by eye which I enjoyed in this cookie. This recipe has to be one of the best recipes I've ever tried and this is the second time I made it and I added just a little bit more of what I like to the cookies. ENJOY!!!!

Followed the directions to a t. 8 minutes into baking I now have a sheet cookie. Somehow I think the butter ingredient is wrong versus the flour amount.

I made these using this recipe for the first time and it’s a keeper. I made a couple minor changes. I’m trying to cut salt so I used unsalted butter and didn’t add the salt. But I made the mistake and bought self rising flour, and I used an extra 1/4 c powdered sugar. They still came out perfect. I doubled the recipe and got about 7 dozen half dollar size cookies. I didn’t shape them into crescents lol.

so simple and they turned out wonderful. I thought the amount of almond flavor was perfect. these are great if you need a last minute dessert or snack. to get a more uniform dusting of powdered sugar, I put the cookies and sugar in a ziplock and shook them around a bit. they look more like they're from a bakery that way :)

These turned out very tasty. The full recipe made 17 crescent cookies using a cookie scoop. They are a nice sized cookie as they expand quite a bit in the oven. My only change was cutting back the almond extract by half. I used pure almond extract, but still find it too strong to use more than that. For ease, I processed the almonds using my Vitamix machine.  I baked them on a parchment lined baking sheet for 21 minutes. ty

This recipe only makes 1-1/2 dozen. I followed directions, made sure to sift flour and grated the almonds in the blender.  I used cold butter and put the baking pans in freezer for 20 minutes. I also refrigerated the dough  for 1/2 hour. Came out great just not enough of them. I suggest doubling recipe if you want more.

Followed the recipe to a T, didn’t stray from it at all and I think like some of the other reviewer’s said but I didn’t notice before, flour to butter ratio is off. When I was forming them I felt like something was wrong, should’ve listened to my instincts. So much for making these for Christmas. Now I’ve got a run out to the store and buy more ingredients.

Followed the instructions but put the dough in the fridge for one hour like I do with all butter based cookies. 
Delicious. I made a small sized cookie batch that came out crispy and a larger sized cookie batch that are nice and soft.

I am sure I did something wrong. I made them and they taste delicious but they crumbled. Please help me figure out what I did. I even refrigerated the batter before baking them.

Same as another review, turned into a sheet cookie. Can’t even tell I made them crescent shapes.proportions of flour to butter is not right. And yes, I used almonds and ground them up in food processor.

These are really so delicious. I needed more then the re ipe called for, so I just doubled the recipe. I did add extra almond extract. Love how these tastes. I served these at Christmas. They definitely were a hit!

These are amazing, the only change I made was to toast the almond before chopping them.

The cookies hold their shape well.  Need to add a little more sugar and watch the oven for browning on the bottom.  Overall, good flavor.
