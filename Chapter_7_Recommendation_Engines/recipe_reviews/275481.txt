Very easy, super tasty!  Love the fresh berries in these - they don't all get cooked down, so you get bites of soft, sweet, bright flavor.  The combination with fresh basil is really interesting.  Oh - I substituted stevia powder for the white sugar, and brown sugar blend on the topping (I have a diabetic in the family), worked very well with no chemical aftertaste :D
