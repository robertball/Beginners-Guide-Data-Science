This was a great recipe for meatloaf.  I do have a little tip for those who mentioned the grease.  Use 2 disposable pans.  Poke small holes in the bottom of 1 pan along the sides, then place that pan inside the other disposable pan that has a small ball of foil in the bottom (so the bottom of the top pan won't rest on the bottom of the second).  As the meat cooks, the grease will drain down into the second pan, leaving the first one, and the meatloaf,  fat free.  Works for me.

I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and used shredded cheese.  I also added a little more italian seasoning.  I cut back on the sugar, and used a mix of bbq sauce and ketchup for the topping.  Tasted great.  My 15 year old daughter, who claims not to like meatloaf, liked it.  It's always helpful to read the reviews for ideas! Thanks everyone  :)

Hmm...I rarely leave a bad review, however I found that the addition of sausage left me with little pans of grease.  I put each into mini loaf pans, however the grease filled the bottoms of each one.  Perhaps if I had shaped loaves and place them all into a 9x13 pan like the recipe said, maybe the outcome would have been different (honestly I don't think so though).  Also, the flavor of the sausage was so overwhelming, that the flavor of the parmesan/ritz crackers (which I love in food) was completely covered.

Great meat loaf, but lean ground beef (or better yet, ground venison) is essential. Otherwise the loaves are too fatty because of the sausage.

Oh my gosh -- my kids just love these!  They call them "mini-meat lumps" and everybody is happy when these are on the menu.  We love them for lunch the next day, sliced and made into sandwiches with some of the leftover bbq sauce spread on the meat.

I had high hopes considering all of the rave reviews.  The beef/sausage combination gives a nice texture, but the taste is rather bland,  Without the sauce, it has little flavor.  I may stick with the meat combination, and add green peppers, diced tomatoes, and some minced garlic to enhance the Italian seasonings of this recipe the next time I make meatloaf.  Adding some of the sauce to the loaves may help also.

I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE.  THE SAUCE WAS WAY TOO KETCHUPY AND BARBEQUE TASTING.  THE MEAT LOAVES WERE INCREDIBLY GREASY, AND I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FLAVOR AND TEXTURE.

Good recipe. This was a real pleaser at my supper table.Use lean ground meat and use the 9x13 pan. I only used ketchup on top. Yum Yum!

Best meatloaf we ever had! The sausage adds a great flavor to it, and the smaller loaves are much easier to store as leftovers.

Love, love, LOVE this recipe!  I substituted bread crumbs for the crushed crackers and 1/3 cup applesauce per egg (because of food allergies in our house) and it still came out FABULOUS! Very glad I doubled the recipe and now have more in my freezer!

This recipe was delicious.  I have to say it was the best meatloaf that I have ever had.  I used 1 1/4 lbs of Plevalean ground beef which has dried cherries and oats in it and 1/2 a tube of the breakfast sausage.  There was very little grease in the pans.  This recipe made enough for two dinners.  Instead of using the ketchup/brown sugar mix I used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce and just drizzled it.

I just made this tonight. I used ground turkey and turkey sausage to cut some of the calories and grease down. I used half the milk because I thought 1/2 cup was too much and I used half the Parmesan because I had the store bought stuff and it has a lot of salt in it. I also made one big loaf instead of the mini ones. It turned out great! I will be making it again!

I did change this by making one loaf.  Only used half lb. sausage.  Extra Italian seasoning and worcester.  Mixed my crackers with the milk and added chopped mushrooms.  I also added cayenne pepper to the sauce.  Thank you for the recipe.

Who would have thought that meat loaf could be soo good?!?!?!?  I like to take the "butt ends" of a loaf of a bread & place a slice under each loaf.  You won't be disappointed with this one!!!  :)

This is a great recipe that I have used over and over again. The only thing that I do differently is I saute my onions because I don't like to bite into crunchy onions. But I do that on serveral recipes.

Loved it...changed a little du to the ingrdients I had on hand... I used Italian Style Bread Crumbs in place of the cracker crumbs. Did not use any onion as I had none, substituted with onion powder with pasley flakes (about 1tsp.) Used 1.25lbs of ground chuck and 1.25lbs of ground sausage (we have a local store that sells the 2 together in a nice package). Ended up cooking for the full 90 minutes. Loved the taste and texture. Not much grease either. With the Italian bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs, it gave it a really nice flavore. Loved the brown sugar/ ketchup topping (kept me from having to use cold ketchup for my meatloaf. Loved it...Thanks for a great recipe.

Very tasty.  I like these for a change but definitely wouldn't want to replace traditional ground beef meatloaf.  I love the individual meatloaves though and will definitely use that concept more often.

I don't like meatloaf but my husband asked me to make this. I was very surprised I ended up enjoying it. I did not make individual loaves, I just made two regular size loaves. Cooking time was the same.

The meatloaf turned out great i loved the addition of sausage, i used honey garlic and it was awesome. i also made a batch with no sausage and double beef and it was very tasty too, i ment to take a picture but i was too focused on getting into it that it was gone too fast lol.

I made these last minute and only had ground turkey.  I also used a little basil, rosemary, and oregano in place of the italian season, and 2 cloves of chopped garlic and salt and pepper in place of the garlic salt.  Still- very yummy!  My only complaint was that the texture was less meaty than we prefer (a littler mushy).  I'd definitely make it again!

The sauce is VERY good!  Other than that, I don't know if this is "too off the beaten path" or what, but it wasn't good.  The sausage was overbearing, the Italian seasonings were way off.  Maybe made as a basic meatloaf with the sauce, but this isn't a keeper by any means.  Perhaps my palate is off.

These little meatloves were a big hit.  Everyone liked having sauce cover the entire loaf, instead of just being in the top portion (like with traditional meatloaf).  I used ground sirloin and the loavesd were still moist and delicious.

This is one of the best meat loaves I have ever tried! It was so good that when I made it for dinner tonight Mick ate 4 BIG pieces! And he usually does not care to much for meat loaf and as far as the grease goes, people were saying there was to much grease in the pan after the loaf was cooked but there is very little if you use a good  quality sausage and hamburger. ie; low fat content. I gave it 5 stars! Oh, and I wanted to mention that the sauce Elizabeth uses for  this meat loaf would make GREAT baked beans as well. :)

This is an excellent Meat Loaf! I used 1 lb. of ground turkey instead of the pork because it's what I had on hand. Turned out great. Perfect portion size for a family, eveyone enjoyed having their own. And, no guess work on whether or not the middle of the large loaf is cooked through. Thanks for posting this recipe :)

My whole family enjoyed this dish, even the kids! I really liked the texture of this meatloaf as compared with regular meatloaf.  Everything about it was delicious!

Forget the kid rating...what kid likes meatloaf? But, man....this is wonderful and thanks Ann! For my tastes I don't like the sausage to be too spicey. But this is the best meatloaf I've ever tasted!

Excellent taste, firm loaves, definitely will make again!  I used individual size loaf pans, put the sauce on the bottom of the pan and reduced time to 45 minutes.  What a beautiful loaf when they are turned out of the pan!

I made this according to the recipe (left out parmesan because I didn't have any) and it was a big hit with my picky eaters.  Easy to make, delicious, and plenty of leftovers to put in the freezer for another day.  I may try it with turkey sausage next time to make it healthier but as is, it is great!

Very good. Making meatloaf into prsonal size portions is very clever. The sauce was good but a little to sweet. Next time i will reduce the sugar. Will make again.

wow, is this a delicious recipe! the two modifications i made were to only use 1/3 cup brown sugar in the glaze. also, being these meatloaves are half ground sausage, i chose to bake them on a lightly sprayed rack over top a foil-lined cookie sheet so the grease drained away from the food & there was an easy clean up. thank you, ann!

very good, but if you eat too much it gets sickening. Leftovers freeze well and actually taste better than right out of the oven. The flavor seems to sink in more.Would definetly make again. Kids love, and they normally don't like meatloaf.

Excellent!  For once, my husband loves my meatloaf.  Moist and very flavorful.  I did not use the ground sausage, but made it with lean ground beef only. Love the sauce!

I didn't know if my family would like the sausage so I cut that to 1/2 a lb. and put 1 & 1/2 lbs. ground beef from chuck. I also used Italian flavored bread crumbs instead of the crackers which eliminated the need for the italian seasoning. There was no grease in the bottom of the pan and everyone loved it! Thanks so much for the recipe. It is a new family favorite!

This was a little more involved than my usual meatloaf but it was worth it.  I actually used mini loaf pans instead of free forming the loaves.  I was able to get 4 nice sized mini loaves out of the mixture.  I thought the sauce would be weird and my husband wouldn't like it but we both really did like it.  The sausage I bought said mild but it was spicy so the sweetness of the sauce help cut the spice some.  Will make again.

Did not like these at all. I think they would be better either with sausage or meat but not both.

I made this for dinner last night...I did not used beef because my husband can't eat beef, but instead used ground turkey and to my surprise it was quite tasty!  And...moist!  I did add a little ground sausage that I had in the fridge, although good would probably leave it out next time.  The only thing I found was the all the ingredients made way too much for the amount of ground meat.  I sort of noticed that and thank goodness I mixed everything except the meat in a separate bowl.  So, I gradually added the mixture to the meat until it was quite moist, but I did end up throwing out about 3/4 cup of mixture.  The sauce on top made a lot - too much for the top of the loaf (I made one big one BTW.)  I did save the ketchup/worcestershire/brown sugar mixture because I think it would make a good dipping sauce.  However, a was a little sweet - I would use less sugar.  Overall, good recipe and loved the parm cheese in it.  I sprinkled parm cheese on top of the loaf prior to baking, which took about an hour.  The melted cheese was yummy and it looked nice on top.  I will definately make this again.

Being my Daddy & Husband DO NOT LIKE MEATLOAF, this was the BEST MEATLOAF for them EVER! HOWEVER, I DID substitute some things. I used NO Worstershire sauce AT ALL, (being I didn't have any). I used Jalapeno & Cheese Little Smokies in sub. for the Sausage. I grinded it finely and mixed it into the mixture. I did not use any BBQ Sauce, only the Ketchup & Brown Sugar. I left the sauce off of some being my Daddy does not like the "norm" Meatloaf sauce. I ALSO, used Muffin Pans for the "Mini Meat Loaves" which was awesome! It turned out perfect! I love all kinds of Meatloaf, but this was the BEST By Far to me! I love this website for recipes! However, anyone who uses this site KNOWS, YOU'VE GOT TO READ ALL THE REVIEWS FIRST!!!

This was the first time I tried this recipe for meatloaf. Really liked it and will likely make again. My one daughter who refuses to eat meatloaf even ate them!! They tasted a little like Italian meatballs. These were fairly simple to make and I had all the ingredients on hand, which is why we made them. I read the other reviews about the meat being really greasy, so I put on a cookie cooling type rack inside a jelly roll pan to be on the safe side. There really wasn't a lot of grease, but I used 85% lean ground beef and I used a 12 oz. roll of Jimmy Dean original sausage because that's what I had in the freezer. We liked the sauce. Went well with our garlic mashed potatoes we had.

The first time I made these, I had never made meatloaf before. That day I didnt have any sausage so I just doubled the ground beef. Since then, I only make this meatloaf and I make it very often. I never use sausage and it still gets kind of greasy. But it is soooooo good. The men (dad, dh,sons) in my life praise this one as their favorite of all  my recipes. THANK YOU for giving me this one. UPDATE: Still using this recipe and my fellas get excited every time.

I haven't made this exactly by the recipe, but I took several ideas from it plus reviewers comments and personalized it into my own, altering the meatloaf recipe I already had.  First, I love making the individual loaves - they cook SO MUCH faster.  Second, I had never thought of adding sausage, I now use 1 pound Neese's Hot Sausage (Neese's is available in NC and VA, maybe other areas) and 1 pound lean ground beef.    Third, one of the reviewers comments of adding barbeque sauce led me try it myself, using my favorite Sweet Baby Ray's.  Add about 1/2 cup to the meat mixture and top with the sauce. Fourth, adding italian seasons was a winner with me.  

Other alterations, I used bread crumbs instead of crackers, added green pepper, omited parmesan cheese & milk. 

My husband thinks this is the best meatloaf hands down he has ever put in his mouth.  Have made it for others and they raved as well.  I call it modern meatloaf :)

I love this recipe and my husband LOVES this recipe every time I make it.  I do a couple of things differently that might be helpful to somebody.  I place them on a grid on a cookie sheet which eliminates a lot of the grease.  I also make them into patties and grill them in the summertime.  Good luck!

This was very good. I did not like how sweet the sauce was. I would definately make the meat mixture again but just top it with Ketchup at the end. DH liked the sauce though. I would also leave the parmesian cheese off the top.

I thought the sauce was too sweet, so next time I'll reduce the brown sugar.  Other than that it was wonderful.  I do have one recommendation.  Make a double batch and freeze the mini loafs individually.  Great for a busy family, just thaw out as many as you need...

This meatloaf is VERY good. My whole family loved it, even the picky "I don't like meatloaf" people loved it. I made it as one big loaf without the sauce, because my dad is diabetic. It was still terrific.

I didn't love this recipe. I thought that after all the preparation it ended up being greasy hamburger with sweet catsup on top.

This meat loaf was amazing!!!  For garlic lovers: don't be afraid to add minced garlic.  I added about 5 cloves and I could have even added more.  For more of a low-fat recipe, use turkey sausage instead of pork sausage.  It tasted great!!!

This is the one!
My husband kept asking me for meatloaf.  I tried every recipe I found, BHG, Pillsbury book, Fannie Farmer, Onion soup mix, beef-pork-veal, cajun, brown sugar, etc. I even tried those expensive pre-packaged mixes.  All they did was convince us we had grown out of liking meatloaf.

The texture with Ritz crackers was perfect.  The sauce was not as sweet as others.  The sausage made the loaf tender and juicy.  

I baked it whole in a meatloaf pan with built in drainer, at 350F for 80 minutes and it was perfect.  But baking in in oversize muffin pans with extra glaze is great fun and yummy.

I've made this multiple times and everyone RAVES about it! The only thing I do different is use lean ground turkey (instead of beef) along with the sausage. I just prefer it taste-wise, but it also cuts down on calories, fat, and grease. I don't think the addition of the cheese is necessary, so I throw it in if I have any on-hand. Otherwise, I don't worry about it. My family loves it each and every time I make this meatloaf. It's definitely a "go-to" in our house!

I cut this recipe in half and omitted using the sausage, and only used the ground beef.  We found the meatloaves were not only moist, but flavorful, and the glaze was delish!

As written, these little meat loaves are great! My family loves them. The first time I made them, I used the buttery crackers. The second, italian bread crumbs. To be honest, couldn't tell a major difference. I love the texture and the ease of these. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought they could use a little more zip. Maybe some peppers or something. This will continue to be my go-to meat loaf recipe. Thank you!

I love this recipe! I've been using it for years now and plan on using it for years to come. My family is not to keen on sausage so I use all ground beef but other than that I haven't changed a thing. Thanks for sharing it!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made it with 2 lbs. of ground turkey instead of the ground beef and sausage and it was not greasy at all. I also used onion soup mix instead of the fresh onions to give it even more flavor. My daughters (who claim to not like meatloaf) loved it and even had seconds! This recipe is definitley a keeper.

Even those in the family who are not keen on meat loaf loved these.  Will definately make again.  I add about 1 Tbls of chili powder to the sauce mizture, really kicks up the flavor.  Also, I use the lower fat version of the breakfast sausage roll to decrease the fat content a bit.

My husband gave this "3.5" and I give it "4.5" so we split the difference.

He is not a big beef fan, so that he enjoyed this recipe says a lot.  It was very moist and tasty.  It tasted like neither sausage nor ground beef.

I did make a few changes.  I was out of ketchup, so used an 8oz can of tomato sauce in its place.  This worked well.  I also sprayed the pan with Pam.  It's still very messy.  I didn't use a muffin pan as suggested, because ours needs a good cleaning first.  I will definitely try that next time.

Thanks for a great one!  This is surely a keeper in our house.

(Added:  We now use this mix ALL the time.  We freeze it in thirds, and use it to make not only meatloaves, but also hamburgers and meatballs.  We love this recipe!)

I love this recipe!  I took other members' advice to cut back on the sugar and I used 1 and 1/3 pounds of beef and 2/3 lb of sausage to cut down on the sausage taste just a bit.  I also used onion powder rather than fresh onion.  This meat loaf is very moist and flavorful.  Thanks!

These were tasty.  I used 3/4 italian bread crumbs and omitted the crushed crackers and dried italian seasoning. Also, even though I used lean beef and sausages, this was still really, really greasy at the bottom.

I admit that I'm no cook, but I followed the recipe exactly and the end result wasn't as good as I had anticipated. The sweet and tangy sauce was really good but I thought the texture of the meat loaf was not quite to my liking. My wife said she really liked it and had seconds. I like the texture of the meat loaf that she makes better. Maybe I did something wrong, but to me it was just OK.

The meatloaves were great - the sauce was a little too BBQ - I prefer a more tomato base sauce for my meatloaf.  But the flavor of the loaves was very good.

I've been making mini-meatloafs for years.  My husband is a meatloaf freak and I can't stand hearing "Is it done yet?? I'm dying!!" for the whole time a large loaf cooks.  The addition of the sausage was so good!  The kids didn't really like the difference, but we adults did.  Another good thing about the size is that you are sure to get yummy glaze with every bite!

Definitely for 6 people. I made it for 5 and only my bottomless pit of a 14 year old and my 9 year old could finish theirs and they were in pain (not what I try to advocate around here) It was a tasty meatloaf and easier to serve than the traditional loaf. I doubt I will ever make my meatloaf in the loaf again.

Some modifications to this one, but the main thing was bringing a freshness to the recipe and adding flavor to the meat. I used extra lean ground beef from a farmers market which resulted in very little fat unlike others are experiencing. I also subbed out the Italian seasoning for freshly chopped basil with dried thyme and oregano, with some chili pepper flake as well as a teaspoon of sea salt and a few cranks of fresh ground pepper to add flavour. I didn't have ritz crackers so I used progresso italian bread crumbs. 

Other reviewers used mini loaf pans and I suggest skipping that. Make your loaves small and use the 9 x 13. Mine stayed intact the whole way through, browned nicely all the way around and again, very little grease. 

The one thing that the recipe doesn't say is how much sauce to use to coat while baking. I used a heaping teaspoon and let it bake for 40 minutes, then added another teaspoon before baking another 5 to 7 minutes.

This meatloaf was excellent. Great taste. Love the sauce on top. I threw in a little chopped pepper and a whole garlic clove chopped. It came out awesome. I would definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I used 20oz ground turkey and 2 cloves of minced garlic, as those were the ingredients I had available.  Baked for 60 minutes and they were done perfectly.  (They started on the top shelf, with a tray of cut up potatoes roasting on the bottom shelf.  I rotated them about 20-25 minutes into the cooking process so the potatoes could brown up nicely.)  Great the next day for a meat loaf sandwich, too.

I am NOT a meat loaf fan, but made this yesterday for my step-father for Father's Day...and we all loved it!  It has a firm texture and a great flavor to the sauce!  Will make this again!  I too used bread crumbs, instead of crushed crackers.

This is a keeper!  The only alterations I made were to use Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers.  I used 1/4 cup of milk (1/3 cup is way too much), even a little less than 1/4 cup would be perfect.  Depending on your salt tolerance, I substituted garlic powder for garlic salt.  I also added about 1 tsp. of dry mustard to the glaze.  My husband loved it and had a little for breakfast, I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!

I love this recipe!! I can't remember ever having meat loaf before... but my husband requested it one night. This has SO much flavor! I do put in Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the ritz crackers. And do 1/3 cup brown sugar. When I bake this I put it on a cooling rack on a jelly roll pan, just so the meat loaf isn't sitting in grease. A reviewer said they use this recipe for hamburger patties... I think I'll try that next!!

For health benefits, I use turkey sausage w/ lean ground beef and organic ketchup (no more nasty high fructose corn syrup). I also cut the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and use 1 1/3 cups buttery crackers (organic, if I can find it). Next time I'll try this recipe using Splenda brown sugar blend and use 1/6 cup, as recommended. These are the best!

Wonderful! I absolutely loved this recipe. My husband thought the sauce was too sweet so I will probably change that up a little, but just to please him cause I thought it was delicious. The sausage adds so much to this great recipe!

This was great. I used oats instead of crackers and cooked them in a muffin tin to cut the cooking time. I forgot the milk and they still turned out great!

I love this recipe! My 11 year old daughter makes this recipe and calls it her own! We've shared it with others who love it and even I, someone who dislikes meatloaf, enjoys this version. I think it's the sauce on top that makes it for me. Any recipe that my daughter can easily make and that everyone enjoys gets 5 stars in my book.

Very delicous!  We all liked the subtle zing the sausage gave this meatloaf.  I used homemade Italian sausage I made from a recipe off of this website.  Do this free form as the sausage does let out a lot of grease and it would make the loaf stew instead of forming a wonderful crust.

This recipe is so good. I don't even like meat loaf, but love this. I make the full recipe even though it is just 2 of us & a baby in the house because my husband has to take the rest to work for a couple of the guys there. They always ask him if I will make it for them. It is a very big hit! The sausage helps out so much - and I love the sauce. I can see how it might be too sweet for some, but I like the sweetness. Thanks for this one!

These mini meatloaves we really good!  However, the sauce made a little too much and overpowered the flavor of the meat.  I would cut the sauce in half next time.

My husband and I liked this.  My kids eat like birds and barely touched it  but that is normal for them anyhow.  I made some of the changes suggested.  Used Italian sausauge, increased the italian seasoning.  I also sauteed a cup of onion in olive oil then added a few cloves of garlic and after it reduced to 1/2 cup sauteed added that.  Also added a bit of salt and white pepper. I cooked the loaves without sauce for 40 minutes and then topped the last twenty minutes.  For the sauce whoever said to make half was right for us.  I'm not a big sauce fan.  I halved the ketchup, added about 1/8 cup of brown sugar, a couple of tablespoons of fresh lemon juice for some balance, and a couple of dashes hot sauce.

My husband said... these would make good meatballs.  I think they would over pasta and tomatoe sauce. Using the Italian sausauge they seem like it would be great.  I'm going to try it and bake them just like the recipe calls for.

The meat loaf itself was very good.  The sauce however was way too sweet for my family, even the kids who are sugar crazed didn't like it.  I will make it again, but find another sauce to top it.

The whole house LOVED these.  We froze half of them and they were still amazing a week later, even a friend who hates meatloaf loved them.  Be sure to only use about half of the topping we used all and had to scrape most of it off, too sweet.  Other than that yummy, will definatly make again!

I love this meatloaf and get tons of recipe requests for it from friends.  Changes I've made...I use all very low fat hamburger instead of sausage.  I add about 1/3 of the ketchup mixture into the meatloaf.  I used italian bread crumbs instead of ritz crackers.  This meatloaf is so yummy!

Until now, my husband despised meatloaf. With this recipe, I have converted him to a meatloaf lover. I made it for dinner, and he had it for breakfast and lunch the next day. I substituted breadcrumbs for the crackers, reduced the amount of sausage and brown sugar as other reviewers suggested, and doubled the amount of sauce I made. I put 1/2 the sauce on top of the recipe and simmered the rest to use as a dipping sauce. I also left off topping it with Parmesan. This recipe goes into the "make often" recipe file.

This recipe was awesome!  I've shared it with friends, they've made it and we all agree that this recipe will replace our old ones.  The only changed I'd recommend is to double the Italian seasoning, and if you like hot, use hot sausage, I used Jimmy Dean regular.  Will make again, and again.

This was edible.  I used 1/2 lb. ground pork sausage like another rater suggested.  It had a very unique taste.  I think a pound would have been overwhelming.  Although the texture was great, I gave it 3 stars because I didn’t care for the sweet ketchup taste and the parmesan cheese sprinkled top made it look UGLY.  Next time I make this I’ll keep the sausage, add in some diced red peppers, and definitely omit the parmesan on top as well as the brown sugar, it was just too sweet.  Thanks anyway.

We loved these--especially the sauce.  A few changes:  I sauted the onions in olive oil before mixing in with the meat mixture, just enough to soften them up.  Also, I used all lean beef.  I put slices of bacon on top to add flavor and keep them moist.  Great!

I made this today. It looks great and taste great. I followed other peoples advice and only used 1/4 of the brown sugar. I also used all ground beef instead of pork. You will not be disappointed with this recipe. Two thumbs up. Thanks.

Really really good!!!  After reading some of the reviews I decided to also double the worchestershire sauce and saute the onions in butter and use half the brown sugar.  My entire family agreed this was a superb meat loaf and I can't wait to make it again.

I have been looking for a different meat loaf recipe. When I saw all of the good reviews on this one, I thought I would give it a try.  Instead of using garlic salt, I chopped up four cloves of garlic.  I sauteed the onion in a teaspoon of butter adding the garlic at the end to soften the onion.  I added about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of ketchup, as well increasing the worcesterhire sauce to a tablespoon.  Using a reggiano type of parmesan always adds a better flavor.  Instead of the little loaves, I divided this recipe in half using one half for a 'bread loaf size' meat loaf (feeds three to four), with the other half made into meat balls for tomorrow's spaghetti sauce.  I baked both at 325 for 45 minutes to an hour.  Placing the meat balls in the sauce to sit over night in the refrigerator made this dish a delight to remember.  Hope all of you enjoy this. This is one of the finest recipes for meat loaf I have tried.  Hugs!

I like to increase the sauce by about 50%.  Makes unbelievable leftover meatloaf sandwiches (and I usually don't even like meatloaf)

This is a great recipe for meatloaf! We all enjoyed it. I did make a few minor changes. I chopped up some bell pepper, garlic and onion and sauteed it in olive oil until tender and then mixed into the meat mixture. My family likes the taste of onions and peppers in recipes but we do not like the crunch of them. I also omitted the brown sugar all together and mixed a small amount of the ketchup mixture into the meat loaf as well. YUM! I had to tell my daughter that it was"italian meat casserole with spaghetti sauce on top" (she will not even try meat loaf if she knows what it is and she ate an entire loaf by herself!!! I then confessed to the lie but she still gave it 5 stars! Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of this was great.  I only put 1/4 cup of brown sugar in the sauce and it was definately sweet enough.  I used a muffin pan as others suggested and I won't do that again because it was difficult to clean.

These were excellent.  My family really liked them.  You save a ton of time by making mini-loaves.  The topping was really good, and hubby really liked it.  He doesn't normally like meatloaf.

This recipe was great. Everyone in my family said it was the best meatloaf they've had thus far. I think next time i'll use a different type of sausage b/c the smoked sausage i used was kind of overpowering. Also, i left out about half of the brown sugar from the topping, so it wouldnt be too sweet, and it turned out good.

this was a great recipe..my huband and my 17 month old gobbled it down. The only thing I would suggest is to use a really lean ground beef. Otherwise you have a beautiful red topping mixed with beef fat..not to pleasant. Next time I make this I will use Extra lean ground beef. And I will definately make this again. Thanks!

My family has loved this recipe for years!  I make meatloaf once a year on Valentine's Day.  I hand-shape the mixture into hearts and bake mini loaves on a slotted roasting pan so grease drains off.  Love the addition of sausage, and even though I leave out the onions just from personal preference, it has great flavor and texture.  It's been a keeper!

I’ve making this recipe for 3 year and my family loves it. 

I split the onion portion with Bell Pepper and add a little brown sugar to the meat mixture. 
Pam works wonders when it comes time to serve and clean up

Thanks for the recipe guys!

It was really good! People said it was greasy, but honestly if you bake it for 60 minutes, you'll end up with the grease being baked out of the meat loaves. I would suggest more sauce, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

I don't make meatloaf that often, but I had the chance to  try all  kind of meatloaf recipes from this site or somewhere else. This one is definitely one of my favorites. I have been making it for many years, with a major change, using only ground beef. Also, I double the amount of salt ( always use 1 t for every 1 lb of beef). This recipe has the right  amount of egg/milk/starch to keep the meat moist and firm at the same time ( not too many cracks forms on the meatloaves). Last, but not least, I like the ease of serving the individual meatloaves.

My husband and I loved it!  I only made substitutions because I didn't have the specified ingredients.  Harvest wheat crackers instead of buttery (I added 1-1/2 TBSP of butter) and used mozzarella cheese.  He doesn't like ketchup so I omitted the topping completely .... oh, I doubled the Worcestershire sauce too.  Dee-lish!

Really good.  The mixture wasn't holding together well, so I just made one big meatloaf and cooked it at 375 for an hour and 15 minutes. I have a meatloaf pan that allows the grease to drain into a pan below.
Next time I make this recipe, I plan to try it with shredded mozzarella instead of parmesan cheese and cut down on the sugar.

I made this tonight as written (except using a two-piece meatloaf pan which helped with the grease factor, and I sauteed the onions so they weren't crunchy) and it was great!  My husband and ten year old (and I) loved it.  The sauce was a little too sweet for them, but I really liked it - personal preference is all.  Thank you for a great recipe!

One of my favorite recipes. This is one I keep in reserve for guests and special occasions, it's that good, and I usually hate meatloaf. I love the sauce, so much better than basic ketchup. I have a few small modifications. I typically use saltine crackers instead of butter crackers as that's what I usually have on hand. For the sausage I use a hot Italian sausage. A lot of other folks have mentioned the grease from the sausage. Two easy solutions are to use a cooling rack in the baking dish so it drains as it cooks, or what I usually do is drain the meat loaves on some paper towels before plating. Great recipe!

I have been making this recipe for a few years now...long enough that I don't measure the ingredients any longer.  I use more Worcestershire sauce than called for and don't use any of the brown sugar (more of a tangy taste).  Also instead of many small loaves I make two long loaves each taking half of a 9x13 baking dish.  One of our favorite recurring dinners in our home.

Delicious! My boyfriend said it was the best meatloaf he ever had and I agree. I used spicy sausage and jalapeño ketchup so it had a nice mild kick.

For the ketchup, i use barbecue sauce and a pinch of cayenne pepper for some heat.Everyone ate it up. And i did leave out the parmesan cheese out because i thought it didn't belong, Anne Collins.

Turned out fabulous...pleased a whole table full of teenagers.  I was able to make 10 smaller little loaves and I used marinara sauce and a little Parmesan to top each one.  Served it with a big salad and jello!  Lots of grateful happy kids!

a great tip to absorb grease is to lay white bread slices down on your pan and place the meat loaf or meat loaves on top of bread slice and it absorbs all the grease.

Very good recipe to eat when it 's fresh out the oven. I ate one the next day and I found it to have hardened a little too much to my taste. Flavor were great for a quick and easy recipe.

My family LOVED it. It was simple and easy to prepare. I incorporated the suggestions made by Jeffrey and it was delicious.  The change that I made to the recipe was to use ground pork meat only and the loaves came out very juicy.

We love this recipe at our house but I do make some changes. I use half beef and half ground plain pork, not sausage. I also make the sauce with tomato sauce instead of ketchup. There is so much sugar in ketchup that I can't see using both it and sugar. The small loaves are great for storing leftovers!

Delicious! This will be my go-to meatloaf recipe.  I added fresh basil, scallions, and spring onions from my garden and a good sprinkling of cayenne.  Using ketchup seems strange perhaps, but it is quite delicious this way.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  This was the first recipe that I have probably followed exactly as it was written.  My husband and I weren't a big fan of the sausage as it was too sausagey (if that is a word) tasting.  I would recommend only using a 1/2 pound of sausage.  We also found that the sauce was too sweet for our liking as well.  If I was to make this again, which I most likely won't be I  would use a lot less brown sugar.

I've never been a big fan of meatloaf but this recipe is delish! I chose to put these in a muffin pan and ended up with 16 muffin sized loaves, 8 for tonight, 8 flash frozen and bagged for a later meal. Baked them for 30 minutes & got mini meat loaf perfection. Definitely a keeper!

This is an awesome meatloaf recipe.  The only thing different I did was use ground pork instead of a sausage.  All the flavors work very well together.

This recipe turned out great.  I didn't have any sausage on hand so I just used hamburger meat.  The only change I made was the addition of about 1/3 cup of ground chilies (just because I had some and wanted to try).  It turned out great and I've recommended it to friends already.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.  Bravo!

Tasty little things... followed to the letter except for halving the recipe and making smaller portions (45 minutes was perfect for cooking 1/4 lb loaves) and adding in some Mexican 3-cheese blend instead of all the parmesan.  Also tried the suggestion of putting them on a wire rack in a baking pan... no grease!  Served with broccoli and biscuits.  They were a hit with my hard-to-cook-for husband.  We're looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow, even!

I was on the hunt for a quick, easy, and somewhat healthy meat loaf recipe and I stumbled across this one.  It's just my husband and I - so I actually cut the recipe in half by simply eliminating the sausage so we wouldn't be eating the same thing every night for a week!  I also wanted to make it a little healthier so I thought that would help some.  I also used the leanest ground beef I could find.  I think if I used a meat with a little more fat in it, it would have been even better!  I will say I might add some vinegar to the sauce next time.  It is a little too sweet for my taste so I would like to add something to cut it a bit to make it a little tangier.  When you mix it up, just give it a taste and tweak it if need be.  I did use dark brown sugar - since that all I had on hand - so that might have made it taste a little sweater.  Cutting the recipe in half made four little loafs - perfect portions for us!  Overall, it was an decent dish - one that I would make again!

I made this recipe for my fiance and his best man about a week ago and they both LOVED it!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I left out the ground sausage and doubled the beef as other reviews said the sausage made them too greasy.  These mini loaves were not dry at all and the sauce on top really adds a nice flavor (I didn't think it was too ketchup-y at all).  Great recipe!

I was never crazy about meatloaf as I always thought it was so fatty but my family loves this recipe with 93/7 lean ground beef and Italian sausage.   I bake the meat loaves on a broiler pan so as they bake the fat drips through the slots into the drip pan and the loaves don't bake in the grease.  This really cuts down on the grease.  My kids aren't crazy about the sauce so I cut the sauce recipe in half and bake some of the loaves without the sauce.

OMG AMAZING...my first time making meatloaf and the sauce on top was reallly good...i added a little BBQ sauce and less ketchup and it was AMAZING. The meat was also very moist. I will be making this a regular on my menu for the future.

The recipe sounds great but the fat and sodium content..high!! 38 grams of fat!! I would use a "light" or lower calorie sausage, low fat milk and egg beaters for a healthier recipe...

I always use this recipe when making meatloaf. I do change it sometimes (add a veggie I want to use up, less sausage for whatever reason...) but I love the flavor of the worcestershire and parmesan. The sausage/beef mix makes for a tasty loaf too.

I HATE MEATLOAF but I adore this one. They are tangy and sweet and cheesy. My husband thinks I am a cooking god when I make them. I have had people avidly protest to eating meatloaf who adore this one. Some times I substitute Heinez 57 for the ketchup and it is yummy too.

We have a new favorite meatloaf!  I made this last night and my boys were licking the pan once they'd eaten the whole loaf!

I made one big loaf, used all ground beef, used onion powder because I was too lazy to chop an onion.  I had no parmesean cheese, so that was left out.  It was still an excellent meat loaf and I think the original recipe would be even better. 
Thanks for sharing it!

This is an awesome recipe that I've made several times.  The only thing I change is that instead of buttery rounds, I use Italian bread crumbs.  This one is a keeper.

I've used this recipe 3 times and gotten rave reviews from family, friends and co-workers. I've tried mild and hot Italian sausage and liked both. I used spiced mustard in the topping and cut way back on the brown sugar.  I highly recommend this recipe.

An excellent comfort food!!!!!!!!  I've been making this recipe for 3 years now and have experimented with different combos of meats- it is close to perfect, next time I will try one and a half pounds of ground sirloin and 1/2 pound sweet sausage- the sausage I find from our grocery is just a bit too seasoned for my family's taste.  I love the brown sugar mixture just the way it is.  It definitely encourages my kids to eat meat(picky preschoolers are hard to please).

I'm often cooking for one or two, and really struggle to find recipes that are easy to half.  This recipe was excellent when I cut it in half, I ended up with 4 loaves, they were cooked just right.  The sausage, although not a prominent flavor, does add an extra depth to the meatloaf.  I also liked the use of crushed ritz crackers, which I always have around and never use fast enough.  I enjoyed the sweetness of the glaze, and added a bit of yellow mustard for added tang.

Quite tasty. I omitted the milk as other reviewers suggested. It was a bit salty, so next time I think I will add garlic powder (or fresh chopped) instead of garlic salt.

i am not a meatloaf fan but this recipe turned out great.  my entire family loved it, even my super picky 10 yr old.  i subbed ground turkey for the beef, made one large loaf and half dozen "meat muffins", and added boiled eggs in the middle of the loaf.  definitely will be making this one again!

Wow that was great, here are the changes that I made:
- I made them in the disposible tins, to have the fat drain (great idea)
- I used caned tomato sauce instead of the ketsup, and cut the brown sugar in half.
My wife said "this was the best ever".. but don't tell her mother..

This came out very moist despite not being covered in the oven, and the sauce was delectable. I threw out my old meatloaf recipe and replaced it with this one. A raving hit with the whole family and an absolute winner all around.

These meatloafs were a hit with my family.  I am giving it 4 stars because I modified the receipe.  I added green peppers, I omitted the parmesan cheese on the top of the meatloaf and used shredded cheedar cheese at the last few minutes of baking.  The big change I made was instead of ketchup, I used Open Pit barbecue sauce.  Will definately make again.

I hate meat loaf but this was excellent.  My fiance has begged me to make it for two years now so I tried this one.  Says it was better than his moms.  On that note I had to try it.  Excellent!  Next time I will wait half way through cooking before I put cheese on top of each one.

After 55 yrs of marriage and being able to only boil water and buy TV dinners I was forced into attempting to cook due my wife being laid up with a bad foot. This recipe looked interesting so I decided to try it. It was great. I did follow some suggestions from other reviews and reduce the brown sugar. I froze part of the servings for another good meal.

WONDERFUL!! I make this recipe all the time, but I substitute lean ground beef, or even turkey breast. I also found it too greasy otherwise. I also double the sauce recipe.
One night I turned these into meatballs, using just the meatloaf portion of the recipe, with a few minor seasoning tweaks. I bake them in the oven, then pour over a jar of spaghetti sauce. 
What a wonderful, versatile recipe.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out well.  Even my picky 4 year old son ate 3 bites of it!  It is sweet (which is great for the kids), and it was certainly a nice change from the meatloaf I normally make.

Very good! Everyone loves this. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers and seasonings. A great alternative to regular old meatloaf.

I'm a house mother at a children's home and take care of seven boys.  They love meatloaf but I wanted to do something different.  I found your recipe and tried it.  It was a success.  As I was making them the boys got a kick out of the size and enjoyed their own loaf.  There were no leftovers and we used the extra sauce for brisket the next day.  I will definitely make these again.

Excellent - used ordinary bread crumbs instead of crackers, turkey sausage, and egg substitute instead of real eggs. Hubby thought the sausage taste was a little odd, but he still liked it overall. I liked the flavor the sausage added, and the sauce was yummy. In total I used about 2.6 lbs of meat to make 6 loaves, and they were done in 45 min. Thanks, Ann!

I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  Around the time I started making the mini loaves, I realized I had made this recipe before.  It must've looked so good I picked it out twice.  The first time it was for company, and everyone loved it.  They ate it all. This last time it was for family and I got the same response.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was simple to make and my family loved it!!!  I made this in the "mini" meatloaf pan for individual size servings.  I used bread crumbs instead of crushed crackers and I substituted the Worstershire Sauce with A-1.

The family loved it and there were NO leftovers!!!!

The only downside to this dish was that I ran out of sauce.  Next time I make this I'll make sure to make more of it.  But other than that this was a great change to the regular ol' meatloaf.

This is by far the best meat loaf recipe ever!  I tweaked it a bit by making my own bread crumbs 1 cup and I also put slices of bacon on top.  Just wonderful flavor and very moist.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. My husband doesn't like meat loaf but loved this one.

5 Stars!  My husband loved this recipe. I gives meatloaf some exciting flava.  I omited the crackers and added italian seasoning.  I used a muffin pan(got idea from reviewer) and loved the consistency.  They were very moist and flavorful.  As for the sauce, I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and added 1 tablespoon of maille mustard and it tasted great.   I've read the reviewer's complaints about the grease, but mine were perfect.  I will definetely keep this recipe!









 and each mini meatloaf had plenty of sauce.

I've made this recipe twice.  I used lean beef the first time and turkey the next.  The sausage is a little overpowering with the turkey, but it was great with the lean beef.  I think next time I will half the amount of sausage (with the turkey), but overall, it's a great recipe!

My family loved it. The only thing I did differently was saute the onions and added minced garlic instead of garlic salt. I don't even like meat loaf or so I thought), and this was very good.

I made this meatloaf with ground turkey and without the sausage. It is pretty good.  I especially like the ketchup mix on top!  Yum!  Next time, I will try to make it with beef/sausage :)

I took another reviewers advice and put these on a serated pan to drain the grease, that was a great idea =)

Great recipe! I used maple flavored ground sausage (it was either that or spicy italian) and I enjoyed the sweetness it added. My boyfriend said it was the first time he had meatloaf that he actually enjoyed.

I've tried to find a meatloaf recipe "just like Mama used to make".  It's taken me 17 years, but it finally happened!  This is the best meatloaf you'll ever put in your mouth.  My husband begs me to make it...and make enough so that he can take it to work the next day for lunch!

I am not a fan of meat loaf, especially when ketchup is involved, But this stuff is the bomb! My whole family devoured it. I ran out of ketchup so I used half a cup instead of a whole and added about 2 TBS of water to thin it out. Great recipe will do again and again.

Excellent meatloaf! We really enjoyed these, and the presentation of the little loaves means that meatloaf can now be a company dish, too. Serve with your favorite mashed potatoes and veggies! (yes, the sauce is sweet, so adjust if that's not your taste)

I have a eight kids. they loved this recipe. So I took it to my cafe. I had people coming in the next day asking me if I had any more of it. They wanted to know when I was going to cook it again. I did add a little more meat to it than it called for. but other than that It was done just as the recipe called for.
thank you for this recipe. I will use it for years to come

This was great!! My boyfriend loved it..(I am vegetarian so I didn't actually eat it) He said it was the most moist meatloaf he had ever had!  I used A1 Sauce instead of Worchestire and I used less sugar as suggested for the sauce, I used 1/2 c. ketchup and 1/2 cup tomato sauce.  He took it to work today and all of his friends asked for the recipe and he has demanded to have this once a week!!

Tremendous!
I made a low carb version too, without crackers and using LC ketchup.
I pulverized the onion in a food processor, and used a grease removing loaf pan.

Yup this is the one I will no longer search for the perfect meatloaf this is it. I will decrease the brown sugar a little next time as it was a little on the sweet side. But oh so good. MY husband said, this was better than his favorite restraunts.

this recipe is really good.  my family doesn't like onions so i used a little onion powder and it was the best loaf of meat we ever ate.

Good texture - good flavour.  I used fresh bread crumbs instead of the crackers.  The sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste.  If I were to make it again I would reduce the brown sugar or add a Tbsp of vinegar to cut the sweetness.  Thank you for the recipe!

this was an excellent recipie (this coming from a gal who has hated meatloaf her whole life).  i didnt have everything on the list so i had to improvise.  i used some leftover rice from chinese takeout instead of the cracker crumbs.  iskipped the sausage (although i imagine that would be yummy) and i didnt have worcestershire sauce so i used some steak sauce that just happened to be in the fridge.  fantastic!  my boyfriend keeps asking when we are having it again

These were quite tasty.  I agree that there is a lot of fat at the bottom of the pan, and I even used extra lean ground beef.  My kids enjoyed the meat, but not the glaze.  I actually liked them better cold the next day.

This was a really good recipe.  I used 7% ground beef and didn't have any problems.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a Bundt pan.  Next time I'll invert it onto a cookie sheet and put the sauce on for the last 10 mins.  I didn't think about the sauce being on the bottom of the meat loaf when I flipped it on to the serving platter.

Everytime I make this people RAVE about it!  I was just so happy to find a meatloaf that is great.  I usually use half sweet sauage and half hot sauage for a special kick!

I'm not a big meat loaf fan but my husband had been asking me to make it and I have to admit it WAS pretty good. He said it was the best he'd ever had. Will make again.
