These cookies were very rich and very good.  They taste best after being refrigerated.  Very fancy looking too.  I plan to make these for Christmas presents.  I think that next time, I will decrease the sugar in the filling and topping- they were a little too sweet.  Everyone loved them!

Very rich, very tasty and rather finicky to make but completely worth it for the annual Christmas baking. A tip - be sure to make the butter cookies small, if you don't get 4 dozen they're too big and will end up being too sweet. As small bite sized treats though they are perfection!

The butter cookie, which is the base of this cookie, is terrible. Nobody liked it. I rated this 2 stars because the filling is very good and the cookies are beautiful. But the recipe did not come close to making 4 dozen as it claims. I only made 16 cookies with my dough and they were 1 inch balls as directed in the directions. My husband said these cookies were only good for one thing....to use skeet shooting. As gorgeous as they look, nobody wanted to eat them.

Yummy, different, great for Christmas!  Since my husband doesn't like nuts, I just doubled the coconut and they turned out great!

This are delicious cookies. The recipe didn't make 4 dozen; I only got about 16 cookies. The first batch I had a hard time getting the dough to roll. It seemed to need something more (butter, water, or maybe an egg) to keep the crumbly mixture together. When I put the indention in the cookie, it really crumbled. So, the second batch, I added 1 tablespoon of water and 2 more tablespoons of butter. The mixture held together and rolled out better. This time I didn't put the indentation in immediately, I let them cook for about 5 minutes, then put made the little hole. This worked much better. I love the filling and the chocolate drizzle. Plan to use caramel drizzle next time. Very melt-n-your mouth cookie! YUMMY!

I loved making this recipe, caution though when you drizzle the chocolate on top of the cookies it is hot. I will be making these cookies again I was very impressed on how these turned out.
