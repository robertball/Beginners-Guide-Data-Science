I will definitely make these again. A nice change from the usual plain baked beans.  I added crumbled bacon also for additional flavor.  This smelled wonderful as it was cooking. I cut back on the chili powder depending on the people  I was serving.

This dish is delicious, unusual, and has been a big hit every time I've cooked it.  It's a great fall hearty dish and is great leftover for a Sunday afternoon meal.  I use a crockpot and cook it for 30 minutes on high, then 3-5 hours on low.

i was looking for a baked beans recipe to take to a picnic. Something differant than the same old thing. This was it. I doubled the recipe thinking there would be leftovers to bring home. Boy was I wrong. They ate every last bean! This is a great recipe and so easy. They smelled delicious while cooking and tasted just as good. Thanks Maureen.

I had to try these since my name is Maureen.  I've made these beans three times and each time the group raved about them and I had requests for the recipe!

Brought this puppy into work and they loved it... can make minor substitutions in the beans... I didn't have wax beans so I used garbanzo beans.

I made these for a carry-in. Hardly anybody touched them at first. I guess they don't look that good. But I liked them, and the people I got to try them said they were good.

Excellent! Great compliment to any potluck or BBQ. I followed the recipe to the T.  I cooked these beans a day in advance for my daughters 2nd birthday party.  I warmed them up in the crockpot.  Everyone loved them.  Not spicy or too sweet.  Just right!  Thanks for the recipe.  Hope ya'll like the picture I posted.

I made these for our labor day/my mom's birthday cookout. I wanted an alternative dish to the normal baked beans and these were a hit! Everyone was leery to try them at first because of all the different beans, but after tasting them, everyone ate them up! I followed the recipe exactly, except my grocery store didn't have wax beans, so I used a can of pintos in it's place. Excellent!

Try this if you're looking for variations on a baked beans recipe: 

Saute onions and chopped bacon in a skillet with brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, and a touch or dry mustard. Once cooked and caramelized,add to mixture of the following: Butter beans, kidney beans, lima beans, and any assorted beans to your taste. Mix thoroughly, and put into a glass baking dish, in a 350 degree oven for 45 min. or until bubbly around the edges and center. Delish!

I had to do a great many things to these beans to improve the flavor I'm sad to say. 1 tablespoon of chili powder is not NEARLY enough to spice this up. I cooked mine the entire 5 hours and at some point, maybe halfway through, I decided enough was enough with waiting for the magic to happen and added a chopped bell pepper, a chopped jalapeno, a handful of dehydrated onions, and several more tablespoons of chili powder. To be fair, I did use a bigger can of tomato sauce initially than was called for though. In the end we liked the flavor, but when I get around to submitting a photo, you'll notice how amazingly un-pretty this recipe is. The green, yellow, red, and whitish beans floating in a bright red sauce (not to mention the green beans being so long and obviously green beans) make it look...odd, to say the least. I may try this recipe again with different beans & extra dark brown sugar...

I made this for a potluck and was asked several times for the recipe. It was a definite hit. The only thing I did different was to add some crumbled bacon on top before serving.  Next time I make it I think I'll add 8 oz more sausage. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic, and a family hit. I think 20 servings is a bit high, atleast not with my family. I thought it was a bit sweet and would cut the brown sugar back to 1/2 a cup. Like other reviewers suggested I made mine in the crock pot and then finished the last half hour in the oven with the lid off. Definately a keeper!

Keep an eye on your cooking time. If you prefer a soupier bean, you may want to take it out around 2.5 hours. I took mine out around 4 hours and it was very thick. I can't imagine leaving it in there for 5.  Still great flavor but I would have liked it a bit saucier. But despite that, Yumm! These are so delicious. They smell so amazing that its hard to stop sticking my spoon in there! We make this for a meal some times as well as taking it to potlucks.

I subbed lima beans for the green beans and garbonzos for the wax beans.  I also used turkey breakfast sausage instead of pork to cut fat drastically.  This is sooo awesome.  It's still too hot to eat and I keep sneaking some anyway.

Wow! This is a true crowd pleaser.  I substituted chick peas and black beans for kidney and waxed. I used Bush's baked beans, which are very sweet.  Next time I will cut the brown sugar in half.  These cooked for six hours in a crock pot.  FABULOUS!!!!  Effortless!!!!

I followed the recipe (which is unusual for me) and everyone that I have served this to loved it and have had many people ask me for the recipe. The only thing I did different is to make it in a crock pot, it does get a little soupy but I have not had any complaints.

These recipe is great!!! Wonderful for a cookout and something a little different (not like the typical baked beans you have at every cookout) We had a cookout with about 15 people and everyone loved them.

Also being named Maureen I had to try this one and was glad I did.  These baked beans are a meal by themselves.  This is the healthiest pot of baked beans I've ever eaten as well as being very tastey and easy to make.

Awesome! The best baked beans I've ever had. Of course, I don't really like baked beans, usually, because I find them too sickeningly sweet and one-dimensional. These beans were still sweet-ish, but also quite savory and flavorful.  I added all the sugar and could possibly have been okay with adding more. I think much of the flavor and savory-ness comes from the sausage (I added a little extra because that's what size package I had), so don't substitute it with unseasoned ground meat. One last note: I cooked this in a slow cooker for about 2 hours on high and 2 hours on low, and it started out nice and thick, but got increasingly thin (as the fat rendered out of the sausage or something?) during cooking. Actually got a little soupy as time went on. I'm sure this would not be a problem if made in the oven. Because of the soupiness, I actually ate mine over rice, which was DEEE-licious. In any case, as a baked bean non-eater, I think these baked beans are the best.

I made this a couple of weeks ago for a BBQ and everybody loved them.  I'm having a BBQ tomorrow and my father asked me to make "those Baked Beans" again and said they are the best he has ever had.  Living in the south where we have BBQs all the time that says alot!!

Very good and easy recipe.  I used an extra can of kidney and butter beans just to make it a bit heartier.  Cooked for only 3 hours - perfect!

Made this for a recent family holiday. Everyone loved them. I wasn't sure because of the wax beans and green beans, but this was by far the best baked beans I've ever had. Even people who don't usually eat beans liked them. I added pinto beans and a little bacon. Cooked it in a roaster oven for  about three hours, uncovered for 1/2 hour. Nice and thick as they should be.

I do not like beans baked or otherwise and I didn't taste this. I was looking for a baked bean dish for a party of 20+ folks at my house tonight. Everyone who tried this dish, the majority of those attending LOVED it and four asked for the recipe!  I couldn't find wax beans so as one reviewer mentioned I subsituted black beans and I cooked it as another reviewer mentioned in a crockpot on high 2 hours and then on low two hours but other then those two things I followed recipe exact. I will be using it again, maybe I might even venture to give it a taste.  Thanks for this recipe, based on my guest comments, it's a keeper!

This is a good dish.  You won't be disappointed. . .  Unless of course you don't like beans and pork sausage.

These were a hit! I did add some molasses though and left out the wax beans because I didn't have any on hand, but added red chili beans (rinsed) Yummy.

Maureen, you rock!! These were the best beans my family and I have ever eaten. They even tasted great BEFORE I cooked them, so you could almost definately speed up the cooking process. 3-5 hrs. seemed a lil long.

GREAT!!! I cooked it all in a  pot. (precooked the onions, garlic and bacon) I only added some sliced Keilbasa and some bacon. I took this to two family gatherings this week and left with an empty crockpot.

Excellent - I made this for an office party. Everyone wanted the recipe.  I did let it cook in my oven longer than was on the recipe, though. That's just the way I like it.

I used different beans (20 oz Kidney, 20 oz butter, and 20 oz Romano beans) and it still came out fantastic.  I added a big squirt of our favourite BBQ sauce as well, which really enhanced the flavour.  Thanks for a great recipe that the whole family loved!

I have made this several times to excellent reviews. But I don't care what anyone else thinks--I love it!
The only changes I make is that I use any type of sausage that I have in the freezer, and I prefer the more spicy dinner sausage. Also, I buy frozen or dried beans when available. It's not too much extra work, and much more healthy without the pthalates from the cans. Be sure to soak the beans the night before.

I gotta be another addition to the 5 stars!  It was interesting because I made it the same day my Dad made chili, and although they look similar, the tastes were so different!

I made a double batch of this recipe for my son's graduation party.  There was very little left over.  I had to give away my copy of the recipe.  What a wonderful dish.  Will definetly make this in the future.  So easy!

These beans were very good!  We ate them with rice as a main course.  The only modification I made was to put 1/3 the amount of chili powder called for, since I don't like spicy food.  It was still very tasty.

Tasty.  Tasted kind of soupy but it might have been because I used the crockpot.  An oven probably would evaporate more of the liquid.

These were pretty good. I used Johnsonville's Beddar with Cheddar smoked sausage instead of breakfast sausage in it, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. This recipe makes a huge amount!

Excellent ,but a bit sweet. Will use less sugar next time. Otherwise, everyone loved it. I cooked it in a crockpot rather than the oven, but I did put it in the oven for 15 minutes at the end to give it a nice top.

One of the best recipes for Baked Beans I've come across in a while.  My only change was I used Molasses instead of the brown sugar as this is what I've always used before.  The flavors in the beans the following day were out of this world GREAT.  Enjoy everyone. :)

I love this recipe. I like to add in different sausages or beans depending on how I feel.  It's hard to screw this recipe up. Planning on making this in a campfire dutch oven next.

I made this twice this weekend. It was a hit at both potlucks and people requested the recipe. It fit perfectly in a disposable 9x13 pan, too, so I felt I could leave it behind if we left before others. It disappeared before we left, but I didn't miss cleaning the pan. I will definitely make this again.
