We loved this!! I used half a can of pineapple chunks and its juice instead of peaches and just plain orange juice instead of the mango-orange juice(didn't have any of either ingrediant on hand).  Will make many mornings to come.  And this is very "basic," you can add/subtract fruits you prefer or have around the house.

We enjoyed trying your basic smoothie recipe in
different ways. The first time we made it with
tropical fruits, papaya, mango, canned and orange
juice. Other times we just used what we had around
the house...which is usually ripe bananas and strawberries, our family likes to add a couple of
teaspoons of vanilla and we sprinkle it with a bit
of cinnamon powder just to give it an extra kick.
Another possibility is making it with milk instead
of water, this is great when you do not have time
to have a sit-down meal. Good basic recipe. Thank
you Janelle!

Only O.K.  It just tasted like a lot of fruit blended together.  Not very smooth, not very sweet.  Will look for another smoothie recipe next time.

I've been making them with blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, a banana and apple juice and it is stiff competition for my favorite juice bars 'banana berry' flavor!

Delicious recipe! We scaled it down to 2 servings and used frozen strawberries & bananas, orange juice, and a 4oz can of peaches in heavy syrup. We left out the ice. We will make this again.

This recipe is a nice starting point... it's got a good balance between ice, fruit, and juice.  I used 1 peach, 1/2 quart of strawberries, 1 small banana, 1/2 cup of orange pineapple juice, and a handful of ice.  It turned out well!

As the name states, it's a BASIC recipe. I hate seeing people lower a recipe's rating because they don't know how to cook. This recipe is perfect as a starting point to alter to one's tastes. Try different fruits, different juices, different amounts of everything to your taste.  Another alternative is to add vanilla flavored soy milk for a hint of vanilla or cream. But remember, if you alter a recipe too much, don't blame the recipe, blame the cook.  ;)

We make simple healthy smoothies with only fruit and real juice daily. Instead of crushed ice, try frozen blueberries or other frozen fruit. No need for anything else for a great tasting way to use up ripe fruit and start the day right.

I agree with the reviewer that said this is a basic smoothie recipe.  We have been making smoothies for years and have found that adding yogurt to the mix helps smooth out the texture and adds to the nutritional content. We have also added other nutritional supplements to the smoothie such as spirulina - with strawberries for a purple-ish color - my daughter thought it was great. Get creative and enjoy! One other thing - we do not use ice.  We use frozen fruit instead.

This was good.  I used 1 peach, 1 banana, 5 strawberries, 1 mango added the ice blended lightly.  Then added about 3-4 tablespoons sour cream, 2 tablespoons sugar a pinch of cinnamon and a squirt of honey.  I know i made several changes, thats why im still giving this 5 stars.  It turned out great!

Sorry, but I thought this was flavorless.  I even only used about half the ice cause I used mostly frozen fruit - all of it would just water it down more.  I added an entire 1/2 cup of juice *concentrate* (and a squirt of honey) to make it taste like anything, and I thought that a pretty drastic move just to give it flavor.

I used frozen strawberries, bananas and peaches. My juice was just plain ol' orange juice. I didn't need the ice because of my frozen fruit. Very good.

Great basic smoothie recipe. I always use frozen fruit for at least one of the fruits so I don't need to add ice. I usually add apple juice and a dollop of plain yogurt. Refreshing and healthy!

I like to use frozen bananas and no ice.  That way the smoothie doesn't get watered down and it's more like a shake.  Delicious!

Yummy!  I used pinapple juice for the sweetener.  This is great in my vita mix.  I use frozen fruit so no ice is needed.  I also added tofu.

This is a good recipe to start with. I had to add sugar to make it sweeter. I also added lemon juice to get the taste that I was looking for. But this is a recipe I would use again adding my own variations.

Since I use frozen strawberries I had to cut the ice to half a cup and double the juice to smooth it out like I prefer. 

I may try this someday with fresh strawberries and see if it's better.

As the title says, this is a good Basic Smoothie.  We also added a banana for a little different flavor and as berries become in season we'll try those too.  Thanks!

I added 1 tsp Splenda and 1 tsp vanilla extract. And I used frozen strawberries and peaches, no ice, and only orange juice. This is a great smoothie, esp for those of us on a dairy-restricted diet!

I like this smoothie recipe as is, however, my husband and kids prefer a sweeter taste, so for theirs I'll add either sugar or fruit syrup.  Tip: freeze your fruit first if you can, makes it extra cold and you don't have to use as much ice!  I keep frozen bananas that have gone ripe just for this purpose!  Super yummy.

I love smoothies!  So healthy, quick, and delicious.  I use a half cup of orange juice, a half cup of mango nectar, one half a very ripe banana frozen in chunks, frozen pineapple tidbits, 4 oz. peach low-fat yogurt, several frozen strawberries, and some frozen raspberries.  I make coconut water ice cubes and use only a couple in this smoothie.  Everything's frozen, so it comes out very cold and icy....almost like a sherbet!  A good smoothie-maker blender makes it perfect.  Using less ice makes it very sweet....adjust the amount of ice the way you like it.

I thought that the amount of strawberries in this smoothie overpowered the other fruits. If I make this again, I think I will half the amount of strawberries.

This was great!  I loved it.  We made it while we were on vacation in Hawaii and it was the perfect tropical beverage--and super easy with only a few fresh ingredients.

I loved this recipe!  We used some frozen berry medley that I had kicking around in the freezer, orange juice and banana.  I did add some plain yogurt to make it a little smoother... but the basic recipe is awesome!  My kids (1 & 3) even came back for seconds.  I made it for desert, but will make it for mornings for me.  What a great way to start the day!

Smoothie came out great! This is a good base for any fruit smoothie. I tweaked the recipe by substituting the strawberries with more peaches. Also used only mango juice and added almond milk. Tastes good.

Great recipe!  I was limited on fruit, so I chunked up an orange and an apple along with my banana, and threw in some pineapple juice.  Takes a while to blend it down to smooth, but quite delicious!

I added a banana.  Liked it but will continue to try adding other fruits.  This was my first ever smoothie. I'm hooked. I'm sure I'll be making plenty more.

This is the hard way to make a smoothie. We use frozen fruit right from the freezer. No need to add anything else.  You can get an amazing variety of single and mixed fruit. So delicious!

Made it with the suggested fruits and the only change I made was to add vanilla yogurt instead of juice which made it creamy.

Our first try EVER making smoothies and this was our first stop for a recipe. We had everything minus the mango juice,but it tasted a little  sour so we added honey to give it a boost of sweet, not much but some! Thanks for the recipe, we will be testing  W/ other fruits as well.

I made this with a mango, a banana, some pineapple chunks and orange juice. It was fabulous! I'll keep trying new combinations. Thanks!
