I submitted this.  Just wanted to share that you have to put the whole strawberry in your mouth at once.  It will seem like a mouthful, but it's the only way!  Enjoy!

I made these for an appetizer for Valentine's Day.   They were perfect for the occasion and quite tasty.   I used an amaretto recipe from here, which is better than any bottled amaretto I've tasted.   I found out that you can't make these too far in advance or the cream will start to melt into the alcohol, but that's ok, because if you have your strawberries already prepped, making them as you serve them can be as much a part of the presentation as the shooters themselves.

These little treasures surprised me at how much I liked them.  They are so simple and delightful.  It’s hard to take it all in one bite, but good either way.  I’ll be serving these at my next get together. Thanks for sharing!

WOW!  These were so simple and so tasty!  Move over jello shots a new kid is in town.  The key is to have smaller strawberries so you don't have to bite into them as mentioned by another poster.  I can't wait to make these again.
