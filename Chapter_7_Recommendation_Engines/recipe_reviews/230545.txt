I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and used 2 eggs and it was still a bit too eggy for me. This is the exact same recipe as Grandma's Corn Pudding from this site and a quite a few of the reviews on that one used 3 eggs instead of 5 for a full recipe. I did like it and if I ever make it again I will use 1 egg for half the recipe.

I wish I could have taken a picture, but everyone ate it before I got a chance.  So delish, and this is my new dish to take to all family holiday gatherings.

I have made this twice and am very happy with the recipe. I assumed that I was to add salt and pepper as desired. For the second batch, I added caramelized onions and part of a poblano. This is a terrific recipe for gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan. It's easily adaptable for vegan needs.
