I loved this recipe!  I added garlic and fresh mushrooms along with the other veggies and served it with our turkey and other sides for Christmas.  It was a hit!

I made this with a roasted chicken.  It was pretty good, but i changed it up a little.  I used season salt (instead of regular), added some poulter seasoning to the broth.  To the veggies I added 1 clove of minced garlic, and more onion.  It tasted  a little bland.  The next time I make it I will add some grated parmesan.

This is so good!  I was in the mood for stuffing but it's a no no on the south beach diet (which I have been on since july).  It has the same flavors, but the texture is just a bit different. I now know what to do with that box of bulgar that I bought! This is a keeper!

Delicious!  Much better than most bread stuffings.  I was surprised at how good this was. My husband and I are using this as a replacement for rice as well.

This is a wonderful recipe.  It came out very flavorful, if not too pretty.  Next time I'm going to add different veggies to give it a better appearance.  I also had to cook it longer then the noted time.  I give it five stars on ease, flavor, price of ingred., and nutrition.

This is a surprisingly tasty recipe.  Fast and easy to prepare.  Served this at Thankgsgiving and it was gone before the regular cornbread stuffing I normally serve up -- and that is always a hit.

In my attempt to add more whole grains to our diet I gave this a shot. It was really good!! The only things I did differently was I had some dried portabella mushrooms that I rehydrated to use. Then I added some chicken bullion to the water I'd used to rehydrate the shroom in to make a mushroom/chicken broth.

Ok this is NOT stuffing like bread stuffing so it wouldn't fool anyone but it is a very tasty side dish and one we will enjoy often.

I admit I was hesitant but after reading the reviews - WOW!!!!  This is truly excellent and super flavorful.  This will be a staple in my kitchen from now on.  It made a pleasant change from the usual side dishes and my husband just loved it.

Delicious!  Very easy, fast and very tasty, Definitely a keeper!  This is a great replacement for rice.  I don't think it tastes exactly like stuffing though... but I still love it anyway.  Thank you!

I thought this was a great side dish.  It reminded me more of a heavy cous cous.  It was very flavorful and I'll have fun trying different veggies in it!  It did stick to the bottom of my non-stick pan but the rest was great.

This was really good.  I changed the serving to 4.  Serv ed this with Chicken and Apple Curry from this site.  If you are serving both make sure you have a lot of time because the prep work takes awhile.

This recipe was one of the worst things I've ever eaten. I won't try this again. I have to admit that I had never had
 bulgur pior to this recipe. If I had I might have know not to try it. The taste of the bulgur over powered everything.I thought the bulgur was a thickener and that the taste would be mild. I'm sure that anyone who likes the taste of bulgur will love this recipe.

This did not turn out well for me. I made it at Thanksgiving along with regular stuffing. The celery and onion were too crisp. We ended up throwing it away. May try it again though, as I feel it was probably my fault and I just need to cook it better next time.

I was so impressed with this! I wanted a change from the usual stuffing for Thanksgiving and this was a hit! The bowl was clean. I was so nice not to have a dish that was heavy as stuffing usually can be. I made the recipe exactly as printed, it was easy to. This will surely become a regular sidedish for us. Who knew bulgur was so tasty?

Very nice alternative to rice. My husband and I liked that this dish had the flavors of stuffing - without the fat. We're on heart heathly diets and this dish provides plenty of grain and veggie with plenty of flavor and texture.
