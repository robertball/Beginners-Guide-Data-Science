Like a pasty, it was very dry. Seasonings were ok, but this recipe needs a binder and something that adds a little moisture, possibly tomatoes.

I added 2 chopped jalepenos, an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and salt. I also used 2 frozen 9” pie crusts that I let thaw for 15 minutes to make it easier. It was done in 30 minutes. I think substituting chopped black olives for the Kalamata olives would be interesting. All in all, it was still just okay. It wasn’t worth the hour that it took just getting it together before baking.
