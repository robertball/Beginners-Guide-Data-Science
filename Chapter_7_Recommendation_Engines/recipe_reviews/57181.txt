I make a similar version of this using Canola oil and Ranch seasoning packet, I came across this one and added the Worcestershire sauce, EXCELLENT! Currently making these for my baby shower tomorrow :-) great easy to make snack that goes over VERY well.

I did this in the microwave as suggested by a reviewer of Bar stool pretzels.  This is very good.

This is a magnificant snack that is often requested by my friends. I normally add pepper and garlic to the soup mix and use a 16 ounce bag of broken pretzels. You can't go wrong!

Yummy!  I used unsalted butter.  I halved the recipe and it didn't seem like it required that long of a baking time, I think I let them go for about 35-40 minutes.

Served these at a ladies function and they weren't well received. Not sure I will try this again, but thanks for sharing.
