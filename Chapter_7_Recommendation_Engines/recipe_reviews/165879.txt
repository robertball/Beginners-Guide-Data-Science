Since leaving my childhood home 20 years ago, I have frequently yearned for my favorite desert, haupia.  When visiting family in Hawai'i, I am on a constant search for the wiggly, creamy goodness found in this coconut treat.  When I decided to do a mini Hawaiian feast last night, I knew I had to include haupia...I found this recipe, tried it out and OMG I'm so thrilled!  The flavor is spot on, the texture perfect.  I'm in heaven!  BTW, the quality of the coconut milk you use makes all the difference.  If it doesn't taste awesome out of the can, it's not going to taste good in haupia.  I've tried no less than 10-15 different brands and have only found one that I like.

This is my longest review ever... Sorry!  I've never had haupia but I had a can of coconut milk in the pantry and this looked like a simple recipe.  Upon reading the previous comments, I decided to change up the order just a little.  To get a good texture, instead of mixing all of the ingredients in the pot, I separated out 1/2 cup of room-temp coconut milk and whisked in the cornstarch until it was dissolved.  In the pot I put the rest of the coconut milk, sugar, and salt and heated it up until the salt and sugar were dissolved, then stirred in the cornstarch mixture.  I cooked it at a higher temp (med to med-high) because nothing happened at a low temp (maybe because pot is heavier or because I have a glass cooktop?)  I made sure to keep stirring it the whole time so it wouldn't burn, and let it cook until it was pretty thick, to avoid the raw-cornstarch flavor one reviewer mentioned.  I sprayed a glass baking dish very lightly with cooking spray (possibly unnecessary) and poured in the mixture.  Off to the fridge it went and jsut now I flipped it onto a seving dish.  It sliced it into squares easily and had a great taste.    It could be sweeter and/or more coconutty, for more of a desserty feel, but it is great and I will be taking it to dinner this evening at the house of a friend whose son is allergic to milk and gluten!

this was very easy, I scaled the recipe down to serve 18 so I could just us a can of coconut milk.  I put it in an 8x8 pan and it was very thin.  Growing up I remember eating haupia like a jello jiggler so this was how I remember eating it.  Next time I'll double the recipe and stick it in an 8x8 so it'd be thicker.

I cooked this beyond the 5 minutes because it was not getting thick enough. I cooked aprox 9 minutes. I sprinkled coconut and put it in the fridge to get hard. It never got hard. I have no clue what I did wrong, especially considering I cooked it even longer than reccomended.  I'm very disapointed.

i thought this was pretty close to the haupia you get in hawaii (i lived there for a few years so i wouldn't claim "local" knowledge but i've had it plenty before). i did have trouble getting it to set up but it's possible the pan i used made it too thick. didn't stop me or the kids from scooping it out with spoons and killing it in record time. next time i'll try a bigger pan and see if that helps. great way to use up that can of coconut milk when a recipe calls for a measly 1/2 cup :)

First off, I'd like to say ALOHA to Ms Hawaiian Deelit.  Hey, I used to live in Kingsland, GA too! Now the other day, bf and I got together and made a mini-feast of lau lau, limu poke, lomi salmon, and of course poi. At the end, even though we were stuffed.. we both felt something was missing but couldn't quite figure it out. Then we realized--HAUPIA!! To make up for that, I searched for recipes online and decided on this one because there was salt in it (salt makes desserts have depth and not taste like you're eating a sugar cube).  The only tweak I made to the recipe was that I used half white sugar and half coconut palm sugar. It got thick really fast when I was making it, so I thought I did something wrong, but I just kept mixing it over low heat until it was completely smooth.  Let it chill for a couple hours and voila--homemade haupia.  I thought this was really delicious and rich and creamy--just like tutu used to make. BUT the bf said that while the flavor was good, it wasn't 'gelatinous' enough for him.  I guess he likes the mass-produced-from-envelope style in the restaurants better. To each his own, but I love it! Thanks!

People loved this, and ate half the pan before I could set it out for the luau for my friend's birthday.   Definitely like the stuff I've had in Hawai'i.

This recipe was very easy to make and so tasty! I served the Haupia on a no-bake Amaretti cookie crust with roasted coconut flakes and fresh strawberries. Delicious!

I stayed with friends in Hawaii recently and got to try this amazing dessert!! I live in Colorado so finding good coconut milk is impossible! So instead i added coconut extract to soy milk. The flavor was really good, but it didnt't quit set up like it should. It was more like a pudding but still delish! It also took about 3 times longer to thicken up than the recipe says. But its a deliciuous healthy dessert! Colorado Haupia!!!!

Although I enjoyed this dessert, none of my guests liked it.  My mom barely got one bite down, as she didn't like the taste.  My dad liked the taste, but said he didn't like the jello-like texture.  My sister-in-law seemed to like it, but gave the disclaimer that a person would have to REALLY like coconut to enjoy it.  I had guests all weekend, and no one went back for seconds on this.  It definately is not a crowd-pleaser.

I love haupia. I grew up in Hawai'i and I miss it a lot. I remember the haupia pies at the bakery connected to Zippy's. I think it was called Napoleon's Bakery. This recipe was exactly what I was hoping for.

I love this recipe.  It's new to me, so I don't know how "authentic" it is, but I found it addictive. I've been making it every week since I tried it. I gave only 4 stars because it needed much more coconut flavor.  I feel like adding shredded coconut, but maybe using sweetened milk, as was suggested would work better. I will definitely make this again, it's a great base for a dessert, if nothing else.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a time-consuming operation because of all the stirring.  It actually took closer to 15 minutes or more to thicken.  I didn't want to scorch it.  The result was worth it, because everyone who loves coconut loved this simple custard.  It is a little plain looking because it is all white.  I'm thinking next time to dress it up with chopped pecans and toasted coconut.

After making this I loved it so much I made it again with just a few simple changes. I whipped the cornstarch and coconut milk together forming a paste before adding it to the coconut milk and sugar. I also turned the heat on high and kept stirring and whisking the milk until it started to instantly thicken and bubble. I immediately poured the pudding into individual dishes and covered them. After chilling in the refrigerator for 24 hours the pudding was firm and set. We added a few fresh raspberries and it was a cool chilled dessert.  Next time I will try a different brand coconut milk and see if that changes anything as suggested in a previous review. This is perfect for a taste of Hawaii or remembering a tropical vacation.

I have to throw it away. Not sure what I did wrong, but, it did not congeal, and it still has this powdery starchy after taste. 
This is not the first Haupia I made, but, I wanted to try this recipe as it has less ingredients. 

Well...back to the one I like. This is not for me.

This didn't work at all.  The mixture bubbled and never thickened.  Also, it tasted awful :(

Well... this wasn't too bad. The mixture never simmered, but it did thicken a lot. We all thought it tasted too much of the cornstarch, too 'chalky'. My dad laughed :( But I ate quite a few pieces just to really test it out. I think it needs more sugar, or to use sweetened coconut milk instead of plain. Also, a 13x9 inch pan is too big, the cubes were very very thin... meh *shrug*
