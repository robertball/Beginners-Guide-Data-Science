This is one of the best soups I've ever made and super easy. I skipped the tomato paste bc I wasn't going to buy a whole can for one spoonful. Didn't even miss it. I also threw everything into the crockpot and let it sit for 4 hours on high. Sausage needed a little more time to cook but it was fabulous. I also used polish sausage rather than smoked sausage. Whole bag of spinach and a whole bag of frozen tortellini (14 ish oz). Definitely will make again.

So simple to make and very tasty.   I've made this a few times.  I skip the canned tomatos and use the entire can of tomato paste.    Spinach is great but sometimes i switch it up with Kale.    I do add a bit of italian seasoning.  Works with any good sausage.   I use the dried cheese tortillini and it works just fine.

I was looking for a soup recipe that used sausage but no beans and this one looked like it would fit the bill. I followed the recipe but unfortunately I didn't have any tortellini but I still wanted to make this soup. I used 9 ounces of pasta instead and its still great. The flavours are really nice with the sausage and tomato and I didn't add any salt because the sausage was salty enough but give it a taste and chose if you want to add salt. I posted this so that anyone that wants to make this and doesn't have tortellini will know that the recipe works with that small change. Update-The pasta soaked up all the liquid in this soup so I would use less pasta.  It still tastes really good but it's more of a stew. Try 6 ounces of pasta instead.

I make a lot of cannelini/meat soups but thought I'd try this one with the tortellini today and all I can say is OMG!  What a refreshing break using the smoked sausage instead of a boring turkey/chicken add in and pasta instead of beans!  Made as is except cooked the tortellini separately before adding to the soup at the end.  Delicious and will be making this one often!

This soup is easy and sooo good on this cold, winter day!  I used a 20 oz. package of tortellini which was awesome, but the soup might need a little more liquid (another small can of tomatos or more broth). I also used turkey sausage. All in all, good comfort soup with Italian bread.

This soup has become a staple in our house.  I actually don’t chop an onion but buy a can of diced tomatoes with onion,basil and oregano already mixed in.  (Plus I’m not a big onion fan).

This is an absolutely easy and quick recipe.  I make food at home during lunch and this quick and easy recipe almost never has enough even though I use a 19 oz bag of tortellini.  This is simple, easy to modify to your tastes, and excellent.

It is tasty and healthy. I found it was too thick, so I added way more broth. Now is was a soup n0t stew.

I was lazy and didn’t want to dice an onion, so I put in onion powder instead.  Next time I will put in 14 ounces of tomato purée and 14 ounces of diced tomato as I personally do not like so many chunks of hot tomato in this soup.  My husband and I really like this soup as it is hearty and healthy, yet tastes so good!

This was really good. I added two cans of cannelloni beans and did just one can of the diced tomatoes. I also added a chicken bouillon cube and white pepper.

Really good!! Added extra Tomato paste. Extra garlic. Cook tortellini separate and in chicken broth. Add tortellini as you go, so leftovers aren’t overcooked, bloated and soggy. I’ll cut the sausage into smaller pieces next time.

I've been making a recipe similar to this that does not have the sausage.  When I saw this recipe I thought I'd give it a try. The sausage is a great addition!  It makes it heartier. A nice addition forsure.

This recipe was so easy to follow and the result was great! I did use less salt than suggested. It was a little salty for my taste but my husband liked it and he didn’t even add extra salt/pepper and/or hot sauce, which means it was perfect for him! Lol. I will sure make this again!

I made this - doubled the recipe so I can put this straight in containers for the freezers.  I used half the canned tomatoes regular, half as the basil, garlic and oregano kind.   I do wonder if the tortellini is going to soak up all the broth and juice.  We will see.

delicious...I am not a soup person but wanted something quick and easy and wanted to use my tortellini I had in freezer... I used dried garlic and onion which is all I had and I added precooked hotdogs with what little bit of smoked sausage I had...If this turned out this good then the complete original recipe has to be superb... ONLY change I made was I added a handful of shredded colby cheese....I am a cheese lover....

Super easy and everyone loves it. This is the 4th time I’ve made this and had to make a small adaptation to using frozen chopped spinach because I didn’t have any fresh baby on hand. It was still good but much better with the fresh. I used more sausage and more tortellini than called for as well, but everything else was the same. I browned the sausage really well before adding tomato paste, also omitted salt since there is plenty in the stock and sausage.

This soup was so quick, easy & delicious.  I doubled the tortellinis,  added Italian seasoning & about a quarter cup of red wine.  Next time I will double the spinach.  Honestly, it would have been just as tasty without my additions.  I truly enjoyed it!

My husband has a lot of food sensitivities, so it is very difficult to make dishes my whole family enjoys. I give this recipe 5 stars based on shear versatility. I needed to replace the garlic and onion with carrots, celery, and mushrooms, and also had to change up the cheese tortellini with butternut squash ravioli. Lastly, had to use beef smoked sausage. I added some Italian seasoning (just for fun). I was ecstatic when my whole family complimented the meal—which is a rarity in my house. Try this one cooks!

Such a great recipe & easy to make.  I followed the directions however,  I used smoked andouille sausage,  which added a nice spice to the soup.

Great soup recipe.  I used 4 pieces of mild italian sausage, 1/2 of white onion and 1- 4.5oz can no salt diced tomatoes.   I like spinach, so I think it can take 3 cups baby spinach.   It's also a nice quick weekday meal.

This was simple and easy!  And got rave reviews from my husband.  A good, flavorful and wholesome meal.  I added some red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch.  Also, could only find tortellini with spinach and ricotta.

I really liked this soup...especially with the temp outside hovering around 0 degrees. I had leftover fresh mushrooms from earlier this weekend, so I added them at the same time as the spinach. Along with fresh basil and fresh oregano. Wonderful.

Very tasty, but the tortellini absorbs most of soup base when leftovers go in fridge (it makes a lot).

Nice and easy to make. I had to make a few substitutes based on what I had in the house: frozen spinach, elbow macaroni instead of tortellini, frankfurters instead of Polish sausage, homemade beef broth instead of chicken broth. The soup tasted very good. I love recipes which taste different but still good when you replace ingredients.

Yep...high five! My husband and I can eat a good bowl of soup anytime..even on a 100 degree Texas summer day. I always use a half pork and half beef sausage, which gives it an excellent flavor. I didn't change a thing on this recipe and it has been added to our favorites list.

I didn't  mind this recipe. Unfortunately I was unable to make it exactly as stated, I didn't have tomato paste, so I used some sun dried tomatoes. I liked the spinach in the soup. I think I will try this again, making sure I can make it as stated.

I liked this with the exception of the smokey sausage flavor. I think it would be better with Italian sausage, which is what I will use next time. Other wise, an easy, yummy recipe!

What a great recipe! The only changes I made were chopping up the spinach before putting it in. I also used 3 TBS of the tomato paste. I love tortellini so I bought 20 oz rather than 9 oz.

My wife loved it.  Only changes were I used Oscar Meyer Select Italian Herb sausage , 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, and a little more broth and tortellini.  This will be a recipe that will be in my meal planning rotation.

With my changes I say this is 5 stars, oh my word. We wanted to use what was in our pantry but also make it a bit healthier to eat since Thanksgiving, so we omitted the cheese tortellini in lieu of just plain wide egg noodles, and didn't use spinach as we didn't have any. I upped the garlic from 1 to 3 cloves and used a whole can of tomato paste. I added more chicken broth, about 4 cartons worth, and 2 cans tomato sauce. For the seasonings I added garlic powder, italian seasoning, oregano, a few sprinkles of cayenne, salt and pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. To make it more healthy I added a frozen bag of a Gumbo mix and added more corn. I simmered it for about 4 hours, and it came out AMAZING. I had about two bowls worth, oh my goodness. Definitely a keeper with changes of course!!

Made this soup in place of chicken noodle for a sick hubs and it was perfect. Rich, filling and so savory.  This is a favorite for sure! Added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and a dash of cayenne for a punch of flavor. Awesome!

2.23.16   Used Hillshire Farm® Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage (tastes just like their regular smoked sausage to me) to reduce calories and fat...love that stuff!  I used Italian sausage & parmesan cheese tortellini (what I had on hand), so my soup had double sausage flavor!!  This was so easy to make, just a really hearty, robust soup that comes together quickly.  Definitely will make this one again.

This came together so quickly which is a plus for this working girl. I bought smoked turkey sausage to keep this on the lighter side and it was great, not greasy at all.  This was a perfect choice on this cold winter night.  A light filling soup paired with a tasty sandwich sure makes for an easy weeknight dinner. Tasty too!

Loved this soup! The Hillshire Farms Smoked Sausage added such great flavor. I've been making a similar soup for years & it never occurred to me to add smoked sausage. I am so glad I tried this recipe. It's definitely a keeper!
