Beware: If your artichokes are large, allow much longer for the steaming.  My jumbo artichokes steamed for 1 1/4 hrs before they were even close to done.  This wreaked havoc with coordinating an entire meal getting done at the same time.

The artichokes I used were delicious and the basil pesto was homemade.  I didn't use the breadcrumbs but I very much enjoyed eating my artichokes.

These were delicious!  The only change I made was using regular bread crumbs instead of the italian bread crumbs.

Delicious but with the pesto and oil it felt a little gresy to me... next time I would just use pesto to cut down on the oilyness. Still yummy though!

Not our favorite.  The butter, pesto and seasoned bread crumbs were delicious as the topping of this.  Not enough actual "artichoke" to enjoy.  I love the taste of artichoke dips and in casseroles, but not crazy about a fresh artichoke.  Sorry.

They came out perfect. I used lemon and garlic, basil, and avocado oil instead of butter.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  We had some pretty large artichokes, so I steamed them longer (45 minutes).  I have some classic artichoke plates, so we dipped instead of drizzling.  We have only ever done artichokes with butter or garlic butter.

?ONO!!!  Hawaiian for “delicious”.  I made this with vegan butter and a recipe for vegan pesto that i got from this app.  So this is a veganized version of the delicious artichoke.

I didn't care for the pairing of basil and other pesto ingredients with artichokes.  I love artichokes and expected them to be the primary flavor, not basil.  In addition, I thought the pesto added a greasy texture to the artichokes.  I'll stick to simple steaming or baked stuffed artichokes.  Sorry, it just didn't work for me.
