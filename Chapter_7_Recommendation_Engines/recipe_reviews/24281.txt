Excellent. Made these at least a dozen times and always turn out great, even using salted peanuts. If you skip "beating until creamy" the candy will be grainy. I find it easier to pour hot candy mixture into cooking sprayed cookie sheet and break apart when cool.  My step-father requests these all the time.

just like I remember as a child. they are becoming more and more difficult to find in stores. I was beginning to panic when I found this recipe. Have made it weekly for the past four weeks. Once forgot the butter and it was still great. Just to have some micro times to go by: I cooked the sugar, water, and karo in the micro on high for 7 minutes. then add the other items and cook on 50% for 9 minutes. After beating and pouring, it is perfect. Sometimes I make a huge patty and break it up after it gets hard and sometimes make in individual patties. Always perfect and always disappear quickly. thank you so much for this recipe!!!

It tastes great, (maybe a little sweet), but it oozed out all over the pan and every single one was now combined with another!

I was really craving something sweet and easy. I used a 2 qt measuring cup. Of course didn’t have corn syrup so I used honey. Followed the instructions other than that. The recipe is great I’m sure. I haven’t made candy in forever. The candy spilled over in the microwave and though I had a high powe microwave I couldn’t get it to lighten when whipped. In desperation I added some baking soda and it started to thicken and lighten. Poured it out and when it cooled tried it. I think I reinvented Bit ‘O Honey. Wasn’t peanut patties but still gave me my sweet fix. Thought I’d share my mistake in case anyone was craving Bit ‘O Honey. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe for an old school candy that is not easy to find anymore. My Dad loves these and I make them for him for Birthday and Father's day.
