I'm probably not going to make this sauce again, but it was ok for the one time I did. Made 1/2 a recipe because the proportions were inconvenient for less. Tossed the leftover because I couldn't think of anything I wanted to use it on again. Made it as written, except cut down by 1/2.

The sauce was awesome. We made fish sandwiches and used the sauce to mix into a coleslaw to top the fish. It was spicy but cooling at the same time. Great recipe.

Great on fish tacos, like a grilled tilapia.
