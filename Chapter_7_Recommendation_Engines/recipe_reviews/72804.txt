Excellent marinade!  One of our favorites from this site!  Don't be freaked out by the long list of ingredients -- most of them ARE in your pantry!  I halved the marinade recipe for 4 medium-sized chicken breasts, and used bottled lemon and lime juices.  Tender, juicy and flavorful chicken.

Great marinade!  I left this on overnight and the chicken came out very moist.  The flavors really came through.  Not overly sweet or spicy, just right.  I pounded the chicken down to 1/2 inch thick.  I used olive oil vs. veg. oil.  I used low sodium soy sauce and dijon in place of ground mustard.  I was a little leary of so much lemon pepper, but it was delicious!

A HUGE hit at our cookout!!! I didn't change a thing, the meat was so moist and full of flavor, yet not over powering. I got so many compliments. It was worth mixing all of the ingredients, and what a wonderful aroma!

You've got a winner here Ray! Surprisingly, didn't have any brown sugar in the house, so I used white and threw in some molasses. Ditched the rosemary, used marsala wine, as I didn't have the sherry on hand. I cubed the chicken breasts, and after marinating I skewered them and cooked them right on top of my stove on my grill pan. Flavors were wonderful and the chicken carmarized beautifully. Served this with grilled yellow and green squash. Family loved this Ray and thanks!

My husband and 4 kids loved this chicken. A good marinade (3hrs ziploc bag) for cheap chicken legs. I used red wine vinegar instead of sherry. We cooked them in the oven for 45min, then BBQ them for 20min.Very tender! Thanks for the recipe.

It was okay.  Nothing special or amazing.  I might have enjoyed it more if I hadn't already tried the marinade for "Unbelievable Chicken" on this site.  I just would never make this again over the "Unbelievable Chicken".   The kids liked this recipe, but both said they prefer the "unbelievable chicken" a lot more that this one.

We weren't real crazy about this chicken; we could taste the vinegar and soy sauce fairly strongly.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Ray.

PERFECT!!
I substituted the distilled vinegar for pure white vinegar (couldn't find distilled)...marinated it over night and EVERYONE at my dinner party LOVED it!  I had many requests for the recipe!

Excellent recipe! The whole family - including my little kids loved it! At first I was nervous using a whole list of tart ingredients in the marinade (soy sauce, lemon and lime juice, vinegar, mustard and sherry) but in the end - they came out so moist and delicious. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and used only 3 tbsp. of that. I made them into skewers and marinated it for a few hours. *TIP* I added about 1 tbsp. of corn starch to the marinade. The marinade that was still on the skewers when I grilled it thickened up a bit and helped to retain the extra moisture in the chicken!

Very good! Lots of flavors in there. I cooked mine on the stovetop. I browned the chicken in olive oil & garlic, added your sauce & simmered it til it was thickened. It turned out great. Oh, and I used fresh rosemary, which worked really well.

This was good but a little too sweet. I pounded the breasts and used prepared honey mustard instead of honey and mustard. Ours were that moist like I was expecting from the other reviews. I liked the rosemary flavor so that is why it is getting a 4* rating. Think this would be good on a salad. There is another marinated grilled chicken recipe that I liked much better.

i hesitated trying yet another "super moist grilled chicken breast" recipe.  however, i had all the ingredients except the sherry.  i thought don't waste money on sherry that you will use only once but i bought it anyway (turned out to be quite inexpensive).  well.....this HAS GOT TO BE THE BEST grilled chicken recipe i've ever tried!!!!!  i've never had grilled chicken breast that is so moist and tender!!!!!!!  the sherry will be sure to get used up and this will become a regular in our house!!!!!!!  i did marinate it overnight and didn't grill until about 4 the next day, so perhaps the longer it marinates the jucier and more tender it gets.  thanks!!!!!!!

I didnt have sherry so I used beer. Marinaded it for over 24 hours.. Placed on grill using the marinade as a sauce, brushing on chicken often. The flavor was beautiful and by far the moistest chicken recipe I have found on here. This is a keeper. Will make again

Nice alternative to our usual (lightly spicy) grilled chicken. The flavor of the soy and brown sugar were prominent, but not overpowering. Paired with a fresh Caesar salad and corn on the cob. Will use recipe again, even for company. Thanks for sharin, Ray!

We really enjoyed this recipe....Even my picky husband liked it! I didn't have 8 hours to marinate the chicken so I cut them into strips and put them on skewers and marinated them for about 3 hours.  Very flavorful and moist! Even had them in wraps the next night!!

SOOOO GOOOD! VERY tasty. I didn't know grilled chicken breast could taste this good.

I substituted the ground mustard for dijon mustard. And sherry for orange juice.

My husband asked who "Ray" was - I said "I don't know", but THANK YOU RAY!

Very flavorful chicken.  I boiled the marinade and then thickened it with a cornstarch slurry.  Do yourself a favor, and don't throw away the marinade; it makes a nice sauce.  Will definitely be making again.

Both my husband and I agreed that this marinade was okay, but just didn't sit right on our taste buds. I think maybe there was just too many different flavors in this and didn't mesh well together. Chicken was nice and tender.

Nice marinade, but a bit time consuming.  I used white cooking wine rather than sherry because that's what I had.  The chicken was nice and juicy and was enjoyed by all!

Great chicken marinade!! Used it on chicken breasts and then made a grilled chicken wrap.  It didn't need any dressing/sauces just added some lettuce, shredded carrots and onions...simply delicious! None of the flavors were overwhelming, they just somehow work perfectly together.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Going to use the left overs for quesadillas tonight.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was very tasty, with a lot of ingredients in the marinade, but this resulted in the complex flavours.  I did leave out the lemon pepper and used marsala instead of sherry, very good.

Wonderful!  Used red wine vinegar. Put all in ziplock bag in refrigerator for a few hours. My son was home for the weekend and raved about the taste.  This is a keeper!

Awesome! Got rave reviews from my 4th of July party. I made way too much so I used leftovers with Chicken and Biscuit Casserole. Yummy. My fam really liked the chicken cold too.

It was pretty good, but for all the ingredients put into it, the taste was just not there. Vinegar taste was about all. Meat was juicy, but not sure if it was my Weber grill or the marinade. Will look for another recipe.

This was great marinade for chicken. The chicken stayed moist off the grill and even my husband who doesn't care for chicken enjoyed this recipe. I will definitely use it again.

Wow.  It was very tasty.  I cut the recipe in half and marinated the chicken for only 2 hours.   I was a little leery of including the rosemary (since it's not a preferred herb of mine) but it ended up being very mild, combining well with the other flavors and complimenting the otherwise teriyaki taste.  I'm only rating it a four because it didn't knock my socks off, but it was really good and I plan on making it again.

Awesome marinade! I made exactly according to the recipe, and cut up the chicken breasts and put on skewers. Whole family, including a 2 and 5 year old, ate it up and declared it a keeper.

This was fantastic. I had last minute company tonight and couldn't figure out what to make. My boyfriend asked for grilled chicken, so I defrosted a few breasts and whipped this up. I could only marinate for like half an hour, but it turned out phenomenal. My boyfriend's brother actually asked what was in the marinade. :D

The only change I made to this was to sub olive oil for the vegetable oil.  The result was a wonderfully flavorful, sweet grilled chicken.  The brown sugar does add sweetness so if that is not what you are looking for I would cut that down the amount a bit.  We loved it and I'm sure I'll use this recipe many times over the summer.

Fantastic marinade for boneless chicken! I marinaded several extra breasts and will use them for lunch in salads. I added both lemon and lime zest and fresh ground pepper instead of lemon pepper but followed the rest of the recipie as written. Loved it!!!

Yum!!!  As others recommended, I doubled the sauce (but didn’t double the sugar).  I dumped all the sauce over the chicken and baked.  So delicious!

It is the best marinade I have ever tried. I let the chicken into the mixture for about 7 hours and you could feel the meat so soft. After I grilled it it was amazing. I didn't have sherry so I replaced it with white wine. I also left out the lemon pepper. Another change I made was to cut chicken breast in 3 slices each. I grilled it for few minutes and I put it into the oven for 10 more minutes and brushed it with the marinade. It was too good to waste it. Atvthe end it came out great. I served it with backed new potatoes and terriyaki sauce. Children loved it!

My husband and I really loved this! I did not have 24 hours to marinade so I popped it in the fridge for an hour, cut some small bite size potatoes, carrots, onions (roasted for 15 minutes with celery salt and lemon pepper), I then seared the chicken on both sides and put the chicken with the roasting veggies in the oven.  With the remaining marinade I boiled it on the stove, added chicken broth (eyeball to desired consistency), and less than a tablespoon of flour-Made a gravy and poured it over the chicken and veggies. I cover the dish in tinfoil put in oven  10 more minutes. In the mean time I chopped 1/2 C pecans and sautéed them in a pan with butter-4T, minced onions- 1/4 c, minced parsley- 2T, salt- when read to serve sprinkle this on top of chicken- great substitute for no ability to grill.

I was looking for something with fast prep time, so I didn't marinade. I've found that if I tenderize chicken breasts (with the tenderizing tool that pokes holes through the meat), and bake it in the marinade, marinating is less necessary, or even not necessary. It wasn't with this one. I threw the marinade together, poured it over the tenderized chicken, and baked it at 375 for 45 minutes. Excellent flavor - and I'm a bit of a flavor addict. Nothing was overpowering, just a good, flavorful blend. Thank you!

This was one of the best marinades I have ever had!  The chicken turned out beautifully.  I followed the recipe to the T, except that I did not have any sherry, so I substituted a little red wine vinegar.  I used fresh rosemary and probably a little more than a teaspoon.  

For cooking, I baked the chicken in a 350 degree pre-heated oven for about 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, I started boiling the rest of the marinade, and added a little corn starch for thickening.  Then, I put the chicken on the grill on medium-high heat for another 10 minutes, and basted the chicken with the thickened marinade sauce.

Served with some brown rice and sauteed chard - this chicken was delicious and I will definitely be using this recipe again!!

Wow! We really enjoyed this. The bone-in chicken pieces marinated overnight. I left out the sherry, I didn't have any and hubs isn't a rosemary fan, so I used basil. Loved it and will definitely become a "go-to" marinade this summer. Thanks, Ray!

awesome marinade and it isn't too fussy about the amounts. We used this on chicken breasts, left it for 3 days and then breaded and deep fried them, great for juicy chicken.

This was fantastic! Only minor changes I made were to use olive oil(that's all we use), and to halve to garlic. My boyfriend said it was the best chicken he has ever had!!I look forward to making this again. Thank you!

Wonderful flavor.  I overcooked the chicken a bit so it was not as juicy as it should have been.  My wife made great chicken salad the next day with grapes and walnuts and mayo which was 5 plus.  We will d it again and be more careful. I often have a problem with chicken breasts on the grill because we are so afraid of undercooking chicken.

We had a family cookout this past weekend and I decided to use this marinade on the chicken.  I didn't have sherry so I used apple juice instead.  It was excellent and everyone raved about it.  Thanks for sharing -- this one's a keeper and will definitely use again!

This was perfect! I only changed one thing...I substituted  garlic infused olive oil instead of the vegetable oil and garlic  clove. I served it at our Super Bowl party and EVERYONE loved it! When you serve ribs and steak the chicken doesn't usually get eaten so quickly but this chicken was gone! I marinated overnight and it was fine. 

I also made it again and marinated for about an hour and a half and it was just as good.

I baked my chicken for 50 minutes at 400 F.  The chicken was great and the drippings made fantastic gravy.  Thank you Ray, when the snow melts I will try the grilled version.

It did seem heavy on the vinegar as one reader said, but the chicken got rave reviews from the people I served it to.  I added freshly chopped parsley and omited the salt as I was marinating overnight.  The chicken had a dry texture I thought, but I didn't grill it so maybe it was just overcooked?

I made this for a family dinner and was disappointed, given the rave reviews. One of our group of seven disliked and the others were unenthusiastic. It does make for juicy and tender chicken, but I wouldn't make it again.

Great marinade. I didn't put as much soy sauce in as it called for cause I was worried it would give it a funny tast. Everyone loved it though so it is a keeper.

This is our go to chicken marinade.  I like to buy up chicken, make multiple batches and put it all in the freezer.  It marinades great as it thaws.  This way, I have quick easy grilling options!  Thanks, Ray!

Good grill recipe.  Quick, economic, and tasty.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the seemingly "heavy" flavor of lemon pepper in comparison with some of the other flavors.  Next time, I'll back it down to about 1 tablespoon and this will be a winner!

For breast meat, this recipe really produces incredibly moist and flavorful chicken.  I think it's the acids, but i may marinade all my chicken breasts now.  My husband literally eats this with only a spoon!

Ended up marinading my chicken for almost 2 days. Mixed up the marinade and added some frozen chicken. I put it in a big zip lock and stuck in the fridge. Didnt get a chance to grill it until 2 nights later. It was good but nothing spectacular. I followed the recipe to a tee. My hunt continues for a really great marinade...

LOVED! This was an awesome marinade! We already had almost all of the ingredients so it was fairly inexpensive to cook! I would make again. My husband burned it a little so I can't speak to the moistness, but the flavor is great! Don't change a thing!

This is THE BEST marinade I have used thus far!  The only changes I made to the recipe were to omit the mustard (not a fan) and subbed red wine for the sherry because that is what I had around the house.  I had 12 people over for dinner tonight and every single person raved about the chicken and how awesome it turned out.  You could by the smell when it was grilling that the chicken was going to rock!  A few friends even asked for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing!  :)

Great recipe! But i accidentally omitted the brown sugar and used sherry instead of the red wine vinegar.  You would not believe how flavorful (albeit more savory) this marinade became!

Not a WOW, but very good.  I prefer much less sugar, so I didn't use the honey and only used 1/2 the sugar but next time I will take out the sugar completely.  I also didn't have sherry, but next time I will add that too.  I think it will add to the flavor.  Everyone liked this recipe.

A great recipe.  I subbed apple cider in for the white vinegar, the other half of the lemon for the lime juice, fresh rosemary for dried, and added a bit of lemon zest to the marinade.  I marinated bone-in chicken breasts for 6 hours and then grilled them.  They were moist and very flavorful.  It did take a little time to put together (not too long, though) but it was worth it.

This was FABULOUS! We grilled and put over salad for a healthy dinner. Marinated about 27 hours, which probably helped. Thanks, Ray!

The sauce was fantastic. I however decided to bake the chicken in the sauce and then served your sauce along side the meal as a dipping sauce. Your sauce was full of flavor and each of the ingredients captured itself nicely with the chicken.

I only marinated this chicken for about 4 or 5 hours before cooking, and it still came out flavorful and juicy. The only thing that bothered me about it was that it tasted a bit too salty for my personal tastes. I would make it again, perhaps lowering the amount of salt and soy sauce used.

OMG I’ve found my new favorite marinade for chicken!  Just a tad sweet plus tangy. So good!  We made it exactly as stated with 2 lbs b/s chicken thighs and grilled on a gas grill. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Amazing Flavor.  Ray, I raise my hat to you!  Best marinade in all the land.
Just as an FYI to others, I  eliminated the oil and it didn't seem to impact the flavor, but the recipe is perfect as it is!

I marinated it overnight, baked it and then grilled.  My husband and friends loved it, but I thought something was off.  It wasn't until a few days  later that I realized that it was the lemon pepper seasoning.  I'll make it again, but will try to cut that ingredient in half.

This is an excellent marinade. I didn't change any of the marinade ingredients, it was perfect as is. I made a half recipe for 3 chicken breasts. I sliced the breasts into strips and marinated them all afternoon, then made Kebobs out of them, adding sliced onion, orange pepper and lime. My family loved it! Will certainly make this again!

I saw this recipe, liked the ingredients and decided it was a good recipe to use as a springboard. I made some changes: omitted citrus and pepper due to allergies; used different vinegar, oil and sweetener but kept same measurements; and used prepared Dijon mustard rather than ground. It was a hit! However, I only gave it four stars because I didn't actually use his recipe as written. But i'm sure it must be good because my altered version surely was delicious.

We marinated the chicken overnight and went exact to the recipe. The flavor was wonderful and went right through the chicken. We grilled the chicken and it was so delicious with sweet and tangy all in one. We will definitely be using this wonderful marinade again!

Excellent marinade for chicken and very easy to make. I let the chicken marinade for 9 hours and the end result was moist/tender chicken when grilled. Served along with cucumber/tomato salad and lemon thyme rice pilaf. Can't wait to make this again!

We love this chicken. My husband loved the marinade so much that I started making enough to fit into a 20 oz bottle to keep on hand for whenever we felt like making this chicken again. Thanks for the recipe!

This came out so well! I've been looking for a recipe like this to put into my regular lineup. I will definitely be making this a lot more in the future. I unfortunately did not have the dry mustard, so I used 3 tablespoons of honey mustard. Once I get some dry mustard powder, I'll have to try the recipe again to see which way is better.

I have REALLY picky eaters and they want me to stop trying new chicken recipes. This one was approved by one of them, the other one said it was ok but I think its because he is lazy and I used chicken breast on the bone and it was too much work. I marinated the chicken overnight (8 hours) and it had flavor throughout. I think next time I will reserve some of the marinade to brush on while grilling as mine did not look saucy like the picture does. I would also omit the salt as with the soy sauce, I think it would be enough as one kid said it was salty. This recipe is now on the "approved list" and I just need to use boneless next time and I think they will like it better.

this came out pretty good.. i cut this in half and used it on 1 lb of chicken breast that i cubed up to make kabobs.. the chicken sat in the marinade for almost 2 days (change of dinner plans) and it was obviously very flavorful.. i added a lot less oil and maybe 1/2 tsp of fresh lime juice and a couple of tablespoons of bottled lemon juice to make up for it.. i subbed marsala cooking wine for the sherry.. left out the honey, brown sugar, and salt.. i felt like the oregano overpowered this a bit.. but otherwise i liked the end result.. we cooked it on the george foreman outside on a yoshi mat.. ty for the recipe

This chicken comes out with a powerful punch of flavor and so moist and tender at the same time. I used all ingredients, except for oregano and rosemary since I didn't have it. Only marinated the chicken for 4 hrs and I can't imagine how it could get better. So good!! Thanksgiving is coming up and I know what I will be making.

This marinade is excellent.  I found a pack of chicken drumsticks buried in the freezer, probably been there a while, but this marinade worked beautifully.  The drumsticks were so moist and tasty after marinating overnight in the fridge. If you don't need all the marinade once mixed freeze the excess for next time.

It was great!  I forgot the Sherry; I was going to substitute wine when I opened a bottle that evening, but got the chicken marinating in an airtight storage bag in the fridge before I thought of it again.  I marinated it for 24 hours and it had a very nice flavor.  I'll use it again, Thanks!

Well I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but as I was making it I found I had white cooking wine instead of sherry, & as I was going to grill it started raining. Soooo, I kept some of the marinade & baked it at 350 for about 40min. It came out nice & moist & had a good flavor. I only gave it 4 stars out of personal preference- I'm not a huge fan of rosemary. But really, other than that (& the things I ended up having to change) a very yummy recipe.

This chicken tastes very interesting...never tasted anything like it. It tasted strange to me at first, but the more I ate it, the more I liked it. My husband thought it was just ok, but i really liked it. Great to change it up once in a while. I used rice vinegar, no sherry. I would definitely do again. thx

It was average.  I marinated 24 hours.  May have been better if I used bone in chicken as opposed to boneless skinless breasts.  It was just a little boring

I've been trying marinade recipes for chicken and so far this one is the best by far!  Very tasty.  Only marinated the chicken thighs a few hours in the fridge instead of overnight and it was still wonderful.

Lots of ingredients but this marinade was delicious.  We did not have time to marinate before grilling so instead basted the chicken as it was on the BBQ and loved the results.

Very tasty and easy!  I did it just as the recipe called (except a bit less lemon pepper) and it was perfect!

This is my Favorite marinade for chicken, by far. I made only one change. I didn't have Sherry so I used Marsala instead, it came out beautifully. I will try it with the Sherry next time. I have 3 small children and they also loved it. WONDERFUL.

Against my better judgment I gave this marinade a try, because you never know.   Wow, too much acid!   I count 5 acids in this marinade.   1.5 cups of acids to 1/3 cup of oil.  Not a tasty or pleasant mixture.   It did have some elements that where good, it just needed less of the hard stuff.

WOW!!!  The best marinade EVER! I only let it marinate for 4 hours and it was terrific! I ran out of sherry so I used half sherry and half white wine and it was still delicious! Will make over and over again!

This was a very good marinade.  I made one adjustment, I only used two tablespoons of brown sugar-simply due to personal taste-I don't like too much sweet stuff on meats!  But other than this-I loved it!

I've used several marinades lately, and this is the only one that I can truly say that I could really taste after the chicken was cooked. It reminded me of something you'd get in the caribbean or the keys. I was a little concerned about the brown sugar and pondered leaving it out (I'm not a fan of sweet chicken), but the chicken ended up not being even the slightest bit sweet. I didn't have the white vinegar or the lemon pepper, so I left the lemon pepper out and used balsamic vinegar instead. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil, and I also used bottled lemon and lime juice instead of fresh. I let 6 drumsticks marinate for 24 hours and then broiled them. Quite tasty. I'll definitely make this again with chicken breasts. I think strips of chicken breast in this marindade would be good in salads.

This is a wonderful, succulent, flavor filled chicken recipe. I cut the marinade recipe to two-thirds and use one-third to marinate 2 small chicken breasts for about 24 hours and save the remaining marinade to baste while grilling.  EXCELLENT!!! Thanks Ray.

The flavor is 5 stars. The chicken is completly flavored through. The breast chicken is moist as long as you don't over cook it. My kid's really enjoyed it, and the 3 adults in my house including myself liked the flavor, but I guess it just didn't wow us. I am sure I am not making sense, but I don't know how to exactly explain it. I think the chicken would be better served with some sort of sauce to compliment it.
