We used both cookie cutters and a mold and both turned out great-just spray the mold well.  We used frosting on the molded one (it was a turtle) and we used melted chocolate on star cookie cut out shapes that we dipped the star tips in the melted chocolate.  It's a nice way to dress up a no bake treat with little effort and the kids had fun doing it.
