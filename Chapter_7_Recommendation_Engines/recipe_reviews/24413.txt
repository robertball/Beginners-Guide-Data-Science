Delicious and hearty soup!  Love the red pepper flavor!  Leftovers held up well, too.  Served with bread for dipping.

This was very good! I subbed half green bell pepper (chopped) for the jalapenos and since I didn't have veggie broth, I used chicken broth. Mildly spiced but great for this heat-sensative family! It did need some extra S&P but I'd make this again! Good recipe Silverwolf!

This soup tastes great but is a recipe that a beginner may find complicated.  In the end, it is worth it---our party licked their bowls clean!

Delicious! I only had yellow bell pepper, so I used that. After the potatoes cooked in the broth, I added the tortellini right in there to cook, instead of dirting another pot (yes, I'm lazy, lol). When they were just about done, I added in the corn and 1/2 & 1/2. I thickened w/ Wondra flour instead of the flour/oil mixture. I didn't find this bland at all, we thought it was very flavorful. This was a wonderful, different soup that I will be making over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Fantastic! I made two small changes to the recipe:  first I used yellow bell pepper (it's all I had on hand).  Second, I used  milk rather than half-and-half (didn't have time to run to the store for more half-and half, I didn't have enough).  Other than that I kept to the recipe and absolutely loved it.  It's mildly spicy but still very comforting.  I enjoyed the mix of potatoes and tortellini, but I can see where others may not have liked it as much.  I'll be making this again for sure, but maybe I'll mix the flour with water or some milk (as someone else noted the oil does come up to the top of the pot).  Thanks for the recipe!

tonight, as i was clearing off the table and getting it ready for dinner, i turned around, and the fella was eating the soup out of the pot on the stove with the ladle. we love this recipe. we usually follow it exactly, but tonight, i didn't feel like dealing with the jalapeno or chile peppers so i just added a little jalapeno tobasco. it still tasted amazing. i'll probably skip those two ingredients from now on. either way, i have no idea why this isn't a more popular recipe. this chowder is amazing. oh, and i'd rather die than eat cilantro, so that was out, too.

Excellent! Just had this for lunch and loved it. I agree that tortellini and potatoes are an odd combination so left out the potatoes (and the red pepper flakes). It was still quite spicey but delicious. Will definitely be making this again.

I added some stewing beef and two tomatoes to this. It turned out great. I thought the pasta and the potatoes were a bit much though. Next time, I'll do one or the other.

Very good. I had all ingredients on hand except tortellini. So, I made it with out. I followed all amounts and directions as indicated in the recipe. I will make this again but use frozen corn instead. Canned corn is chewier, I think.

Tasted very good, but too spicy for the kids. The mix of tortellini and potatoes was indeed a little weird. Next time I will try doubling or tripling the potatoes and omitting the tortellini.

It was a nice change from the normal tortellini soups that I make with sausage, spinach, tomotoes or all added in.  Like another reviewer I used chicken broth since that was all I had and I only had chicken and Prosciutto tortelli so I eliminated the cumin since that might have been too much.  It was delicious - I would have preferred it a little thicker and will do that the next time using flour and water rather then the flour and vegetable oil.  That left a heavy, greasy film on the top of the soup. Thanks submitter.

I was looking for a hearty soup that was a bit different and not a tomato based soup. This fit the bill. I didn't have jalapeno peppers so I added a few extra pieces of red and yellow peppers. I would put in 1/2 to 1 tsp of cayenne or chili powder next time to add some heat but it tasted good as is. I'll make this again when I am looking for something different.

Awesome!! The smells were wonderful as it was cooking and you never know if it will taste as good...but it was fantastic.  And just got better with time as it seasoned.  I always believe cumin is the key so added a tiny bit extra.

The flavor was aright, but the tortellini just felt like over kill and a bit of an odd combination.  It would have stood well on it's own without it. Too spicy for the kids, but a perfect bite of spice for adults.  I think as a chowder it was decent, but I would leave out the tortellini next time.  Over all it just seemed like too much work for the end result.  Probably won't bother making this again.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added no green chilis and used fat free half and half It would have been great with fresh cilantro.

This was really good. Very nice spice to it but not overpowering. I didn't have half and half but I did have skim milk and heavy cream so I did one cup skim and about 3/4 cup heavy cream. Came out nice. Also, I used artichoke stuffed tortellini.

I used a small can of chopped green chilies, olive oil instead of margarine and one cup of cream mixed with one cup skim milk in place of the half and half.   It was delish!  I will make this again for sure.

Made it tonight and we really enjoyed it.  Was pretty simple and quick, I sliced my finger half way through and my husband was able to pull off the rest... which means it can't be too difficult either.

We used cauliflower instead of potatoes and spinach tortellini. Also about 1/2pt of half/half instead of a whole pint. Yum! My  jalapeno pepper was rather hot so only used a bit of it for the pot but a little bit more for the grownups.

There are many delicious soups to be found here, but this is the best recipe so far!  My husband raved about it so much I'll be making it for him again soon.  I "pre-made" the soup the night before, stopping before adding the tortellini, corn and half/half. The next day I reheated the soup and completed the steps. It really is a wonderful combination of flavors and very satisfying. Next time I will try using sweet potatoes as a nod to my husbands weight lifting diet.

We loved everything about this chowder - from the fresh veggies to the tortellini to the creamy broth!  I just eye-balled the veggies but measured the other ingredients.  This was great the night I served it and even better the next day as the broth got a little thicker.  A fantastic chowder that will be made again in our house.  Thanks SILVERWOLF for sharing your recipe.

My husband really liked this.. scored it 8 out of 10.  I thought it was excellent.  My son, who is very picky, did not like it, but that was OK by us, it meant we had more!
The only minor changes I made were, 1) only used 1/2 a jalapeno, since I have a wimpy palette, (Hubby would have loved the extra heat) 2) used a can of green chilies since that's all I had on hand and 3) used milk with the flour, not oil.  
Thanks for a great recipe!

This soup was very good. Has great flavor. I do not like spicy hot so it was a bit spicy for me but my husband thought it was great. I will defiantly make this again.

I am absolutely love this recipe. We tried it the way it called for the first time but the second time we switched it up a bit and just turned it into a potato chowder. We added bacon(almost every soup we eat has bacon in it) and extra potatoes but left out the tortellini noodles. still amazing..

I would have given this five stars- but I didn't like the combo of potatoes and tortellini. I would double the amount of one or the other. Either would be good- but the two don't go so great together in my mind. Besides that though this recipe has wonderful taste!

Absolutely Delicious!! The recipe is perfect just as is! I did not change a thing, and my husband and I loved it. We even ate the left-overs the next day. The chowder had thickened, but was still great! The chowder does have quite a kick, so if you are sensitive to spiciness, you may want to leave out some of the spicy ingredients.

Fantastic soup with just the right amount of heat - I’d describe it as just a touch less spicy than most “medium” salsas. 4 out of 5 of us devoured it, the fifth wouldn’t even try it because he could see the peppers floating in it. Kids. Ugh. The conversation at dinner included me saying that next time I make it I might prefer to double the potatoes and not include the tortellini. My husband and kids all vetoed that and said they love having the tortellini in it.

Easy to make and tastes great. It has the right amount of heat (mild but you know it has red pepper in it) for my wife and I. Doubled the recipe for my wife take to a potluck at the school where she teaches. The end result was an empty pot and multiple requests for the recipe. Thank you.

Nice job, Silverwolf! I followed the recipe and the result was great! My kids tend to groan when they find out I've made a new recipe. This time they wandered over to the stove and announced that it looked "interesting" and "weird." But when they tasted it they were pleasantly surprised and said it was "actually pretty good" (a glowing review coming from my kids!). Hubby and I both loved it too. I skipped the cilantro garnish and served with French bread instead of chips. We'll definitely make this one again!

This was pretty good, but I made a few changes, to save prep time and clean up. I did not peel my potatoes, and I didn't cook the tortellini separately, just added them in about halfway through the potatoes' cook time. I also added a good pinch of salt at the end because I tasted it and it needed 'waking up'.

I had to make a lot of substitutions with things I had on hand, and also to keep it from being too spicy, and lower in calories. My family doesn't care for spicy, so I used only the red bell pepper and onion, (one large of each, rather than measuring), which I sauteed in olive oil rather than margarine. We left out the potatoes since I'm making potato soup in a few days. I'm not crazy about cumin, so I only added ½ a teaspoon, and ¼ teaspoon of chili powder in place of the ground red pepper. Rather than oil and flour I mixed cornstarch and milk, and used nonfat milk instead of the half-and-half. I also tossed in two small chopped zucchinis that I needed to use up, with the (frozen, rather than canned) corn. I know it sounds like a lot of substitutions, and people hate when a recipe is rated with so many changes! :( Some were to keep it lower in fat, others were to keep it from being too spicy for my heat-sensitive family. I appreciate the base recipe, we really enjoyed it.

The base of this is awesome, but for us, it needed some meat and something a big more, so I added some browned spicy Italian sausage and some Italian seasoning.  I made it for a simple lunch of soup and homemade bread/butter.

Really liked this recipe.  I used chicken broth though for more flavor and butter instead of margarine.  Liked the crunch of the corn.  It's a keeper!

I tend to like my tortellini Italian spiced only! I used fresh oregano and German thyme I did enjoy finding an easy way to make it like a chowder. Normally I don't use potatoes. Its very hardy, great to warm up with on a blistery cool day. I didn't use the Mexican spices listed but I make lots of soups and I didn't need a Mexican style dish. I think the spices are spot on if you need one. Enjoy.

Very good and hearty on a cold evening.  Some reviewers have been put off by the tortellini/potato combination.  I agree, it's unusual, but it was interesting.  I mixed the flour with chicken stock to cut out a bit of the fat and used olive oil in place of the margarine to sauté the veggies.  I also used canned green chilis and chipotle chili powder (because that's what I had in the pantry)--very flavorful.  I "pinned" this recipe so that I will have it on hand to make again.

I omitted the jalapeno (because I didn't have one on hand) and yet I found the chowder to be very spicy!  Next time I think I'll use only a pinch of ground red pepper .

Perhaps my peppers weren't spicy enough but the main taste my chowder had was of Cumin.  It took a long time to chop all those veggies - not worth the time I put into it.

I thought this was very..different.  I didn't think that it blended together very well.  The idea was great, however there was something that just didn't mesh.  I did like the use of tortellini in a cream soup.
