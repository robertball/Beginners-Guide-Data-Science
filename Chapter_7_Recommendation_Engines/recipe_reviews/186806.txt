This was delicious! The apple is a must (I used Fuji). I left out the celery root and used half the dressing. The combination of the sweet veggies/apple and tangy dressing was perfect, and the apple added a nice juiciness and texture. Very easy to prepare, too!

I really liked this, once I got past the appearance. Of course, the whole salad turns a uniform neon red from the beets and I found that unappetizing, but the flavor combo of the veggies and the dressing was great. I kept to the recipe and used a food processor for quick shredding. It tasted best after sitting a couple hours. Served with herb roasted pork tenderloin and was a great accompaniment.

I just love the idea of this recipe = fresh ingredients in the winter time!  I didn't have any beets, so I made the recipe the first time without.  The celery root is a must, I think, it adds a pepperiness that is just lovely.

I thought the sauce was very sour due to equal amounts of Olive Oil and Cider Vinegar.  I've made the recipe a second time and replaced the olive oil with some mayo and added less cider vinegar; the rest of the dressing I left the same.

Another wonderful addition is some diced red bell pepper (in my case, instead of the beet), this adds crunch and sweetness without adding more sugar.

This is one great salad!  I had to leave out the celeriac-- it's not easy to come by around here.  The apple is a must-- it just goes so well with everything else.  Thanks for the recipe, Lynzee!

I gave it four stars. I followed the recipe to the letter but for me it lacked flavour. Next time I make it I will try using sesame oil instead of olive oil as I think it would better complement the crunchy texture of the vegetables used and give it more of an Asian taste.

I don't especially like carrots.  This salad is fabulous for using up carrots, because they're suddenly yummy!  It's super-easy and really really delicious. I didn't have the celeriac, and I did add some mayo, but this is a GREAT base recipe.  I added some crumbled smoky bacon on top and that was really, REALLY good.

This is a cheap, easy-to-prepare fresh salad for the winter, when our immune system really needs a boost. The cheery colour is an added bonus. Don't leave anything out of this salad!  The dressing is delicous too. I just used a tablespoon less apple cider, to lessen the sour flavour. I think I will be making this salad often from now on!

This is delicious.  The changes I made:  I left out the celery root and just added in extra beets and carrots.  I didn't have dijon mustard but felt like it needed some heat, so I used regular mustard and a dash of dry mustard.  Next time I make this I may try other veggies like radishes, onions, peppers, etc.  The beets have such a different flavor raw than when cooked, which is good because I don't care for cooked beets!

Wow, yum! I doubled the dressing, used 1 large apple, 1 celery root, 3 large carrots and 2 large beets. Shredded them all with my food processor. Super easy and super yummy!

I'm being generous even giving this recipe 3 stars!  Just didn't do it for me or my hubby.  If you do try it, cut the vinegar by 1/2 (and I love vinegar!).  So not worth having all the beet "blood" all over the kitchen!

Had a gathering of 9 ladies to dinner.  Didn't want a "salad" to go with my tureen of beef stew. This looked more interesting!  Not only was it a great hit, but was glad there was left over for me the next day.  I grated veggies day before and refrigerated each separately.  Then layered them in a glass serving bowl, added the apple and the dressing and Wow, what a hit! Did use a wee bit less vinegar as one reviewer suggested

Followed the recipe, but only used about a third of the dressing. We really liked it, and I will definitely be making it again. Next time I might add some nuts for crunch - toasted walnuts, or even sunflower seeds...but it was quite good as it was.
