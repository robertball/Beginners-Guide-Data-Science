I take the liberty of adding to pleeeaaase OMIT THE SALT as there is more than enough in the two soup cans and the dry onion mix.

We used to make this recipe in the oven and the gravy was simply fantastic.  I have yet to try it with the slow cooker.

We love this recipe!  I added a couple of bay leaves to the mix, and cut up some Yukon Gold potatoes to throw in as the hubby HAS to have potatoes with any meat LOL.

This was really good! I used venison tenderloin which was cut into large chunks. I misread the ingredients and only had regular beef broth (not condensed) so I used 3/4c broth and added two boullion cubes + the 1/4c water called for. It had a stroganoff-type flavor, so we served it over egg noodles, but it would be great with potatoes or rice as well. Thank you, Erin A! This is a keeper and a great way to use our wild game. If you like a lot of gravy, I'd consider doubling that part - a lot of it had soaked up by the next day's lunch.

Excellent.  The whole family loves it.  Used the leftovers to make a "hunter's pie" too.  :)

Used the Yukon Gold potatoes and added a tablespoon of Lawrys Seasoning salt to the rub.  Delicious.  Will add more carrots next time.

What a wonderful way to cook a venison roast. Changes I made included rubbing the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning, then browning the roast in a hot pan with a little oil (on all sides) before putting in the slow cooker. I also decreased the pepper to 1 teaspoon instead of a tablespoon. I didn't have onion gravy mix, so I made a roux in the cast iron pan (in which I just browned the roast) using a little more oil and 2 tablespoons of flour, to which I added the rest of the liquid ingredients. Once all that was smooth and without lumps, I added it to the crockpot and walked away from it for 8 hours. Fantastic!!

We've  never eaten Venison and always looked at people strange who did. I was given a roast and thought, what the heck. I used to what I had on hand: baby carrots that were forgotten in the fridge string beans that were losing their zest, potato,  a few beans I think I even pitted and cut up a leftover apple from my sons lunch.

My husband couldn't get enough! He ate bowl after bowl, my children raved! I was to nervous to throw all cautioun to the wind, but  I took a good sized taste.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. They enjoyed it so much I didn't have the heart to tell them what it was, but I will be making it again very soon.  Thank  you for posting!

3 kids and 5 adults loved this.  Didn't have cream of mushroom so used golden mushroom soup instead.  We fought over the mushrooms so will add more next time.  Served over rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easily the best venison pot roast I have ever made!  I didn't have all the ingredients, so I made some substitutions, but no major modifications. 
THE BEST!

It is very good.  No gamey taste to this at all and very tender.  I did follow some suggestions and added thinly sliced potatoes to the crock pot with the mushrooms and carrots.  I also added 1/2 Cup of red wine to rub on the roast instead of the water it called for.  Very good the family loved it,  will make it again.  Great for turning the tough cuts of Venison into a tender dinner.

Love, love, love this recipe!  I did use sodium free beef stock and didn't use any extra salt for flavor, enough sodium with canned soup and onion soup mix.  Loved the pepper flavor.  Did double the gravy, but didn't really have to.  Next time I will try to make it with less sodium, but loved the idea with mushrooms!  Just wow!  Will definitely make this again!

I will absolutely be making this again. The meet was incredibly tender and tasty. I added red potatoes. I would agree with several other users in saying OMIT the salt. There is plenty in the other ingredients.

Will make again. Easy! Think pepper should be 1t as even 1 1/2t was too much for us. Omitted salt and 1/4c water. Added 1 quartered sweet potato last hour. Plenty of gravy and flavorful. Thanks for recipe.

Added potatoes and served over rice. Perfect amount of onion, one bowl is all you need.
