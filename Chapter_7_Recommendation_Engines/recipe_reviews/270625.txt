This turned out pretty good. The only change I made up front was with the pine nuts. They are expensive and come in small bags and I only bought one which ended up being just over 1/4 cup. Even with less pine nuts I still had trouble getting the pesto to blend so I added some extra virgin olive oil and that did the trick. I ended up needing more flour than the recipe calls for but other than that this was great as written and one I will make often this spring once the basil plant takes off.
