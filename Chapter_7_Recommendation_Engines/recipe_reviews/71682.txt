This is really yummy! I used a mixture of black beans and blackeyed peas and defrosted extra sweet corn in the place of canned and let it set in the refrigerator overnight.

This is great! I added a can off kidney beans and a bunch of green onions instead of reg. onion. I also used fresh garden tomatoes and fresh cooked corn.
And instead of jalapeno used chopped cilantro. This is wonderful on top of navaho tacos or any mexican dish. Everyone loved it!

I make this with the Mild Rotel and chopped sweet bell peppers (red, yellow and/or green)instead of the jalapeno so my child can enjoy the salsa.  We really enjoy this with homemade baked tortilla chips (recipe on this site).  I serve this as an appetizer before dinner so we get our beans in each week.  It really deserves 10 stars-the taste is amazing!

Very good - only change I made was to drain the tomatoes - felt it would've been too much liquid w/ that & the italian dressing.    
Used a light garlic italian dressing & 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/ chiles.

Quick and easy.  I use frozen corn - works better.  Fresh lime and fresh cilantro make all the difference.  I've received lots of compliments on this colorful, healthy dish.

This recipe was wonderful!  Took it to a church function and it was a rave!  Served it with Frito Scoops and tortilla chips.  Very easy to make and delicious.
