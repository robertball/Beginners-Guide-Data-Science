I used chopped garlic dills and the juice from the garlic dill pickle jar instead of sweet pickles/sweet pickle juice. It's really just a personal preferance. I slightly mashed the potatoes to have a little more texture to the salad. Simple and delicious--my husband said it reminded him of his mother's potato salad. For those of you who have not tried mashed potato salad, you've got to try it.

FINALLY...someone else that mashes their potatoes for potato salad...so much more flavour and makes for great presentation if you use an ice cream scoop and place on lettuce leaves for individual servings - thanks for posting your recipe Micke

This was my mom's recipe, but she used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo and dill pickles instead of sweet. For a meal, she would fry some baloney and fill them with warm mashed potato salad.

This is the recipe I've been looking for.  I wanted a potato salad recipe that was simple, but tasty, and one that resembles my mother's.  She got Alzheimers and never wrote down her recipe.  This is the closest recipe I've ever found to what she used to make.  Thank you so much!!

Awesome very easy to make! Made it
for dinner today and the family loved it.
The only part I didn't like was peeling the
potatoes but is was worth it! You
got to try it.

My Mom has always made Mashed potato salad!!!  I never knew anyone else made it this way!  I love it because it is creamy and our family could eat every bite she made.  When I would call it "Mashed potato salad" people would say "Yuck" but they never tried it!  Once they tried it, they loved it!  You CANNOT get creamier potato salad, and it is addicting!  Lol!  Thank you for this recipe!

I'm from Idaho and I've had my share of potato salad. I made this for a gathering at our church and doubled it and it was gone so fast. People kept coming up to me asking for the recipe, delicious! I used yellow potatoes and didn't peel them. Everything else was exactly like the recipe.

I've made this twice now. I used white potatoes both times, plus I subbed dill pickles (and juice) for the sweet, since we don't care for sweet pickles. This is a GREAT recipe. My family loves it, and that's saying a lot.

This is a wonderful potato salad.  I didn't have any sweet pickles, so I subbed sweet relish and then just used apple cider vinegar for the "juice".  Was a hit at our Father's day dinner with everyone.

Love it!  Much easier than traditional (chopped) potato salad.  I added mustard to taste and sprinkled in some celery salt.

This is a really nice potato salad.  Used sweet pickle relish rather than pickles and juice and used russet potatoes because that's what I had on hand.  Takes quite a bit of salt and pepper.  ;-) After eating a bite with crumbled bacon and olive slices that I added for garnish when taking a picture, I will DEFINITELY be adding both of those to the whole batch next time I make this!

Wow, this makes way more than 8 servings! My 6 potatoes were close to 4 pounds, so obviously I had to up the volume of pickle juice, mayo, and mustard. Way more. I also used extra pickles (I used dill instead of sweet, personal preference). It is very good though! I'd watch the onion though, it tastes a little strong, even with my 4 lbs of potatoes. Great base recipe though! I also suggest mixing the mayo/pickle juice/mustard combo while mashing to make sure it is nice and smooth. It helped me get the flavor of the potatoes right before adding everything else.

I make this several times a year.  Yields about 2 quarts.  This style of mashed potato salad is exactly what I was looking for.  I grew up on this style and I can't find it this way in stores.  I used about 800 grams of just normal, pealed russet potatoes (weight measurements are a good thing, folks -- 6 potatoes can vary bunches.  I end up using about 7).  Used a sprig of rosemary from the garden (everyone needs a rosemary bush in their garden/flowerbed/hedge/whatever).  Added a little more mustard, celery and pickles -- 'cause I likes them.  The potatoes do not need to be mashed.  They fall apart on their own as the ingredients are mixed in.  My Mom used sweet pickles, but my wife and I prefer dill.  We even add a tablespoon of Lighthouse Dill.  Better the next day.  It firms up a little more and the flavors blend together after sitting in the refrigerator over night.  Make this on the weekend and have cheap, tasty, and vegetarian lunch all week for work with some homemade chili beans, soup or PB&J sandwich.  Better than anything you can buy at the local grocer.  And did I say cheap?  You can eat well on few dollars.  Just takes a little research and planning and discipline.

I was looking for a non Miracle Whip version of Mashed Potato Salad! This was just right! I have friend who's Mom always makes Mashed Potato Salad- hers is a little more basic than this but I just LOVE it. She cooks the peeled/cubed potatoes - drains them throws the minced onions on while hot, covers the pan for 5 minutes so the heat from the potatoes can soften the harsh bite of the raw onion. She mashes this and Then adds the Miracle Whip to the hot potatoes. I believe this step to be important as it keeps the salad light and not gluey.

Made this per instructions with the only change being that I substituted low fat mayo for regular mayo.  Very bland and flavorless...still cannot beat Publix' mustard potato salad.  For future potato salads I will stick with the Mediterranean Potato Salad from this site...it is very flavorful with far less fat.  Wanted to like this, but it was a miss for me...

Made this for a potluck and the bowl was wiped clean! Only thing I changed was I added more mustard and eggs and didn't mash the potatoes. My husband is very picky about his potato salad and said this one was a winner. Thank you

I made this for Memorial Day. I used sweet relish ( instead of pickles) and chives ( instead of onions). None of us knew about mashed potato salad, but it is now requested for the 4th. Very good and easy. Everyone loved it! This is my new potato salad.

Really interesting take on traditional potato salad. My only suggestion would be to cut your potatoes into equally-sized pieces before boiling to create a more even texture/doneness in your mash.

Definitely, the best mashed potato salad around. Almost the same as the one my grandma made. I will be making this one again. Thanks for a great recipe.

I make a great potato salad but didn't have all the ingredients. I made this with dill pickles and Dijon mustard.  My husband loved it!!! He didn't even know there were pickles in it. I'll make this again with a bit more mayo so it's moister.

My family requested this all summer!  There is something extra-comforting and delicious about potato salad that is mashed. I like to use a combination of sweet and dill pickles and juice, and I love the zip that it adds!

This is very similar to my own mom's recipe. She never made regular potato salad, it was always partially mashed. I left out the onion and celery because I don't like them, but stayed true to the rest of the recipe. Tastes just like mom's...thank you for sharing!

Just exactly what I was looking for.   This recipe is simple and simply delicious.  I have made it as written and put our own family spin.  Using the same amount of of potatoes, mayo and mustard ;I chopped parsley, dill pickles olives , green onions.  Will make this salad a summer time staple.

I normally only sort of like potato salad, but I LOVED this one!  I don't care for sweet pickles, so I subbed dill pickles instead.  I made it a few weeks ago for a neighborhood cookout and folks really liked it.  I took it to another cookout today and got several compliments.  Good stuff!!

I will make it again.  I added some mustard seed and a bit of sweetener to counter the taste of the onions.(I didn't have any sweet onions, so I used a different kind).  The celery was a bit to much crunch for me, so I will probably use celery salt the next time.

The easier and quickest and tastiest potato salad.  I had a leftover container of prepared mashed potatoes to use.  Turned out great and only took a little time to do the chopping of veggies.  Definitely a keeper

Who would have thought that a mashed potato salad could be so delicious, especially considering that cold mashed potatoes are normally so unappetizing? This recipe is wonderful.

I am not the best cook so I wanted something easy to make for a party.  A friend of mine's mother used to make this all the time & I loved it because it didn't have big chunks of potato in it.  The only change I made was to mash the potatoes slightly and I used sweet pickle relish instead of sweet pickles.  I thought it was a bit dry, so next time I make it I will add a touch more mayo.  All of my friends loved it!  Thank you for sharing MICKE.

Fantastic.  I'm always asked to bring this to gatherings.  I follow the recipe but omit the pickle juice.  Instead of pickles I use hot dog relish.

This is the potato salad I grew up with.  My family uses dill pickles in place of or along with the sweet pickles and perhaps a little more mustard.  To be honest I don't think anyone in five adult generations of my family measures anything.  We all grew up with it and just throw it together and and it always comes out right. It's good to see someone that does measure post this great recipe.  We usually add some paprika on top when finished along with a few slices of boiled eggs for presentation. Try this recipe.  My guess is you will get rave reviews from your family and friends.

This recipe tasted great as I was putting in fridge to get cold. I used a small red onion and 4 eggs. Instead of the pickle juice I used vinegar. Used yellow potatoes and cooked till real soft. Just chopped them and not mashed. I'd like to try it with the skin on next and green onions. Good all around potato salad recipe. Thanks

This seemed odd to me at first....but it turned out delicious! I doubled the recipe since I'm taking it to a family cookout and I followed the recipe exactly and added some chopped flat leaf parsley. I haven't gone to the cookout yet, but my husband tested it and said it was a keeper ;-)

This is just like my 86-year old mama makes it. My family loves this. We don't specify the potato, but usually use the cured red potato. Sadly, all we can buy at our grocer is the small new red potatoes. So we've switched to the russets...going to try the Yucon Gold and see how that works. We also use chopped sour or dill pickles, substituting apple cider vinegar when we don't have any pickle juice. Pickle juice is preferred.

Delicious. It has been very hot where I live and I do not have air conditioning, so I definitely did not want to boil potatoes! I microwaved the potatoes whole until tender. Then I cut them in half and scooped out the insides. Kept the house cool and was super easy.

Totally easy to make! The only thing I did different was I added more celery than the recipe called for because my family loves celery! As we say in New Hampshire "It was Wicked Good!"

Great, simple recipe! Couldn't find a few things locally so I substituted the sweet pickle with relish and mayonnaise with Spanish salad mayonnaise.  Flavor was pretty good too!
