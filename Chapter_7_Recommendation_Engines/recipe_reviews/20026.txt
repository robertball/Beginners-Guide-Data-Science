Intense, indeed! In fact soooo intense that I had to cut the intensity with 1/2 cup plain yogurt. I also reduced the honey to 1T. Very Very good, and soooo quick to make. Loved it! Thanks Diane!

Great flavor.... but definitely needs something else... it's all fruit.  Try adding yogurt, ice, or juice.

Smoothies are the best because they're fast and easy to make- this one is especially good since it has only 3 ingredients!  Very fruity and tasty.

I absolutely loved the smoothie. I didn't even feel the need for the added honey for sweetener. I added the natural fruit (peached in pear juice) and it was plenty sweet. Made a wonderful breakfast for my daughter before school and will make a wonderful snack when she comes home one of these days!

Good, but made better by adding milk and honey or sugar. I also enjoyed it a bit more by straining the smoothie after blending.

This was pretty sweet for my taste.  Next time I will omit the honey and canned fruit.  I will use mixed berries and orange juice.  It is a thick smoothie that can be eaten with a spoon, making it seem like an indulgent dessert!

Great quick breakfast, just had mine! Added a little OJ the second time I made it, because it was very thick. I also added a few ice cubes, to make it nice and cold.

Almosts TOO intense.  I added a cup of milk to make it more drinkable...without, it was like eating baby food.  But once I added milk, I thought it was delicious.

i have been on a green smoothie kick and looking for things to blend.  this was perfect.  the only thing i changed was i used a have package of frozen peaches and a half package of frozen berries. i added a small amount of vanilla yogurt, no honey, and 1 and a half cups of fresh spinach. perfect!  the berries covered any hint of spinach and i got a good amount of fiber!!

Great smoothie, but since my peaches and berries were frozen, I had to add some liquid in order to blend, so I added a couple Tbsp of soy milk and 1/4 cup of fat free plain greek yogurt.

Wonderful, I changed it around a bit, though. 
1 cup frozen blueberrys
2 cups frozen peaches
11/2 cups chocolate almond milk
2 tablespoons honey

Beautiful!

I love this smoothie! It's easy and healthy and delicious. I use canned peaches in pear juice and add the juice to the smoothie to soften the flavor a bit. I also add a dash of vanilla. I love a strawberry or raspberry with mango version. One word of caution: don't accidentally get frozen fruit with sugar added! It adds calories and makes it too sweet.

Haha, as my boyfriend says, this smoothie is the bees knees!  :)  A very, very delicious drink.  I did alter the recipe a little though (I usually add my own personal twist to things). I added just a dab of 1% milk and one 6oz container of vanilla yogurt.  I will definately make this again!  Love it!

This was the first smoothie I've made. It was really intense! It tasted great, but i did use a dap more honey and i added plain yogurt to cut it down a bit (as others have said).   That color stains though (duh) so make sure to clean up any drips if  you have a lighter colored counter space! :)

We LOVED this! I made it with a 12 oz pkg of frozen mixed berries, because the store didn't have 10 oz. I loved the 'intensity' of this smoothie, and the fact that there's no extra sugar added. Not to mention, the color was beautiful! Loved the texture too :) Thanks!

I used fresh fruit, added half a banana and a couple of spoons of yoghurt. It was by far the best smoothie I've ever had.

This was very good. It was seedy but that is the quality of the berry I think. This is a perfect alternative to ice cream when the kids are at DQ or a great boost for the morning!

This was very good and quick to put together!  I did cut back on the honey and I added some low-fat vanilla yogurt.

I made this for my kids' breakfast this morning using a package of blackberries.
They liked it, but I thought it was a little too sweet. 

Next time I make it, I'll forgo the honey and add a frozen banana. We've always got too many bananas.

A great way to start my morning.  The change I made was to use frozen peaches rather than canned.  Because all my fruit was frozen I added a little milk for the liquid so that my blender didn't burn up.  Not a fan of honey, I added it, but glad I couldn't taste it in the drink.  Thanks Diane for this delicious drink.

My family enjoyed this, I did tweak the recipe though.
My version used frozen berries, 1 banana, a can of peaches including the pear juice it was canned in. I didn't have honey so used about 1 1/2 Tbsp of brown sugar then poured a small amount of tropical juice.
With that combination it was very flavorful & fruity without being too sweet.
So many varieties can be made. Thanks for the recipe!

I made mine a little different. I used the frozen fruit. But instead of honey I substituted 2 shots of tequila. Then I used wine in place of peaches. It wasn't too sweet but it did lighten my mood.

The recommendation to decrease the honey and add the yogurt was good advice. Used no added sugar peaches to help reduce the sugar content that the yogurt adds. Best one yet!

I left out the honey and the canned peaches.  I used Frozen berries, honeydew melon instead of the canned peaches and a half cup of light cream (half and half) and a couple of ice cubes as I am under doctor's orders to gain some weight.  On days I can't face food (cancer not anorexia) it gets some nutrition inside me.

Delicious! At almost 8 months pregnant I was craving a really flavorful easy to make smoothie and mm mm this is the answer, my 2 year old kept trying to hog it :) have only made it with peaches so far but you can tell that no matter what fruit you mix it with it's going to be exceptional.

I loved it! I replaced the caned fruit with coconut milk because it was the closet thing I had and it tasted wonderful!
