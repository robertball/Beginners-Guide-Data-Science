My family has made this exact recipe for years.  Everyone loves it.  Here's a trick to make it easier:  cut the carrots into 4 or 5 chunks and cook.  The cooked carrots are soft and very easy to julienne.  Takes a little longer to cook but the cutting part is much quicker.

This sounded scrumdidly - and I followed the ingredients to the letter but it was a total let down. I love horseradish but for some reason it totally over powered the rest of the meal (I made it with beef) and left me wanting to pick the little crumbs out of my mouth with each mouthfull. Not a good combination of textures. Sorry I won't be making this again.

This recipe is pretty good, but I believe it would be a lot better next time I make this with some changes. The taste was really good to me, others not so much. I thought the horseradish went really well with carrots. I followed this recipe exactly, I used dried breadcrumbs, not fresh. When I mixed the crumb/mayo mixture it was very dry and I couldn't spread it over the carrots at all. If using dried crumbs be sure to add more mayo until you get a mixture that is of spreading consistency. My mixture was more of a crumbly topping, which was fine, but next time I'll play around with the mayo mixture. Equal parts of mayo and crumbs just don't seem to work well if looking to spread this, as the recipe states. I will make this again with some tweaking. Thanks (:

This recipe has swept our family and friends. Whenever we serve it the casserole is emptied. If you like carrots and enjoy the added zest of horse radish you'll love this recipe.

This recipe was in my husband's family for years. Only difference was the sauce (without crumbs) was put with the carrots, and the crumbs sprinkled on top of all. We used crushed Ritz crackers.
Update:  The negative comments on the horseradish seem to be from having it all sitting on top.  It is milder when mixed with all the carrots, and the amount can be adjusted so there is just a hint until kids get used to the taste.

Wow definitely will make again! I used 1 lb bag of baby carrots (julienne). I had only straight jar horseradish so I used half as much and added 1/4c sour cream. I made the topping first and the moisture was absorbed quickly by the breadcrumbs while I waited for the carrots to boil. Next time I will prepare the topping immediately before placing on carrots so it can "spread" easier. Served these carrots alongside slow cooker beef tips & mushrooms in wine sauce and boiled noodles. YUMMY!

I found it delicious and the whole family loved it. Next time I'll double the spread (may be I used too large carrots). I don't like mayo my husband doesn't like sour cream so I subbed the mayo with egg yolks and it worked fine very tender.

We use this recipe but use half sour cream and half mayo. Sometimes I add a little carrot water to thin the sauce too. We love it with our home grown carrots! We top the carrots with buttered bread crumbs instead of mixing them in.

This is great! It is tasty and zesty. I used the full 2 tablespoons of horseradish; use less or more to your taste. I have tried similar carrot recipes but this one was the best. I think the julienning makes a difference - I just used my potato peeler to "julienne" the carrots. Thanks Chef-Jeff!

We make a version of these carrots for EVERY family holiday meal and there are NEVER leftovers! We slice and par boil the carrots reserving some of the cooking liquid and mix it with the mayo and horseradish and add minced onion and a hefty portion of Parmesan cheese. We reserve the buttered bread crumbs and paprika as a topping. Dynamite side dish for ANY MEAL!!

This recipe is fair the way it's written. I found it a little dry. Just double the mayo because the horseradish was a little overpowering before and you'll have some delicious carrots!

Pretty good recipe. I used the suggestion of using more mayo since I'm not a big fan of horsey sauce.

My husband and I both love horseradish and we absolutely LOVE this dish. I actually HATE carrots but I love them in the dish. It's a shame that my kids think horseradish is too spicy for them so I don't get to make it very often. Otherwise this would be on the menu weekly. Amazing and so easy!

Very tasty & different carrot side dish. I took other reviewers suggestions & used about 3/4 cup of light mayo w/ the 2 Tbsp of creamy horseradish. You can definitely taste the horseradish so I was glad I added extra mayo. Will make again.

Nice Dish. I used a large mince instead of julliened carrots. Very creamy that way. Instead of boiling and baking (since I had no clue when dinner would be served today) we zapped the carrots in the nuke then slipped them into a medium-small'sh sized slow cooker in which I had already mixed the sauce. Worked out very well. Sadly my children who hate horseradish are still never happy when I add horseradish to potatoes or anything else these carrots included (though they do eat at least a little - so they might learn to like it yet after all they do like grist now! and they used to hate them horribly). I loved the creaminess of these carrots and my husband liked them overall BUT surprisingly enough my husband who likes more horseradish than I do most of the time anyway thought there was a tad too much horseradish in this particular dish! So next time I'll make it with a little less horseradish in the pot but then I'll add some at the table for myself.....

The flavor was delicious but the texture was a tad off. Next time I'll thin the sauce a bit and instead of mixing the bread crumbs into the sauce I'll toast them in a skillet in two TBS of butter and sprinkle them on top before baking. Otherwise I think the ratio of horseradish to mayo was perfect. I served it with a sirloin roast and it was a perfect sidedish to roast beef.

I didn't use mayo in this because it's the one thing my mom thought she had and she didn't but it was still good. I I made it for thanks giving and I added a little extra horseradish but I like horseradish.

YUM YUM YUM - I am so glad I found this recipe - the only thing I did that was different was to mix the carrots and the sauce together before I put them in the oven. Next time I might reserve some of the sauce to leave on top just to see if it would make a difference.

I am a little surprised at the rave reviews. I think maybe the paprika was too overpowering for me. It was definitely a good start but I will keep looking for other horseradish/carrot recipes.

This was a very good recipe for carrots. Will I make this again. Yes but will add another topping as the bread crumbs didn't do much for the dish. Next time I will omit the bread crumbs and just use the Mayo & horse radish.

I've been looking for a great carrot recipe that's other than sweet and finally found it.  I made this recipe just to get rid of some carrots and thought this recipe was amazing.  I absolutely hate horseradish so i changed the creamy horseradish sauce (private collection-store brand)  to tsps instead of tbs.  To me, this is the best savory carrot dish I have ever found. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!

The first couple of bites were promising but after that it was a chore to eat. We ended up throwing out the leftovers.

We've made these twice now. They are so good. First time my husband used horseradish mustard and I think I liked them even better than when I made with the horseradish. Either way was a great way to kick up a common vegetable.

first time went by the recipe baked 20 minutes and the topping did not get crunchy although it had excellent taste. Next time will mix ingredients and sprinkle bread crumbs on top.

Maybe this is an aquired taste but I gave it an honest go. Followed the recipe completly. The mix on top was way to thick to try and spread and just weird.
