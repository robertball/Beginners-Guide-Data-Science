Had to bring something to the soccer game. This was fast, easy and fun finger food. went fast. We made them look more like a black widow spider with two segments. We cut the hot dog pieces as the triangle spots with the almonds as legs. They didn't understand the idea of grubs in france, but we got lot's of spiders here. Thanks for the fun tasty idea.

Fun! Thanks for sharing! I thought the dough could use some herbs. Regardless this was fun and one I would make again.
