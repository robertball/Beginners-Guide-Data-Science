It is important to leave approximately a half of an inch border around the jam layer.  Also, it is important to place the jam in a small bowl and stir it (to loosen it) prior to adding it on top of the flour/crumb mixture.  Otherwise, the jam does not spread as smoothly.

These are good, and adding chocolate/rasberry swirled baking chips on top made them delicious!  My only note is that I think 1 cup of rasberry jam is way too much.  When trying to press the top layer over the jam, it was oozing all over the place (and I did it Very carefully!) so I ended up scooping off about 1/3 cup of jam, and it was still very difficult to get the top layer even.  My junior chef loved helping me make these and I"m sure I'll be making them again!  Oh and if you're wondering, I used regular oats instead of quick and they worked fine.  They baked for about 10 mins longer but not sure if that was the oats change or a recipe error.

I used vanilla extract instead of almond, since I find almond extract can often times be overpowering. Added a dash of lemon juice to the softened butter before mixing into dry ingredients, and used a cherry-blueberry spread. Yum.

they were really gritty in texture, way too sweet, and the almonds didn't stick. it was crumbly upon the bite as well (falling apart). won't make this again. needs more of a doughy dough.

I made this with peach jam and it was great.  Next time I would cut back on the sugar some- they were a little sweet for my taste.
