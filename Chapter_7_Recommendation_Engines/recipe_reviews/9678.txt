I used grapenuts for the bran cereal. We really enjoyed these cookies. In fact they make a terrific breakfast cookie. My teenager who prefers not to eat breakfast will have at least 2 of these with oj before heleeaves the house. I am about to make a second batch in the same week.

These are good cookies. But, they should be baked around 10 minutes, most of my cookies burnt. I had to through half of them away, but for the ones that didn't burn, they were pretty tasty!

I used 3/4 c. peanut butter and 1/2 c. butter for more peanut flavor.  Left out the raisins and added chocolate chips. Really good chewy cookie.  Reminded me of Cliff Bars.  So we call them Cliff Bar Cookies!

These cookies were great. Didn't taste like healthy food at all. I did change the cooking time to 10 minutes though and added 1 cup of melted chocolate chips to the batter instead of raisins.

Tasty, especially if you like a nice moist and chewy cookie.  I incresed the peanut butter to butter ratio for more peanut flavor.

These are great cookies! Very tasty and easy to make. I did cut the sugar and raisins in half though.

didnt really actually get to taste much of these. they were chewy. i followed the recipe exactly and all of my cookies fell apart! i made them the correct thickness but they just fell to pieces when i picked them off the cookie sheet after they had cooled. not the best recipe iv tried. sorry.
