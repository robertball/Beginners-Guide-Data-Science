Came out great!! One crucial step to avoid chewiness is to soak the frozen calamari in cold water and baking soda for 30 minutes to an hour.

Recipe as written was good. Second time I made it I added a little seasoned salt and bread crumbs and thought it was even better.  A solid recipe overall. Thanks

It was quite floury tasting and a bit rubbery. But, overall would make again. Also stated a lot more oil than needed. Would adjust the amount of oil and salt and pepper (was very salty for my tastings). Would recommend to all to follow an onion ring recipe and use that for the squid batter. Works way better and the batter is much thicker and cake like.  An OK recipe.

Great recipe!  Definitely use the soaking in baking soda trick recommended by another reviewer.

These are easy to make, and they tasted great.  The quality of the calamari rings I purchased (frozen) was not so good, and the finished product was too tough and chewy.  I will try this again with fresh calamari.

I liked the spices mix with the flour but the coating didn't stick enough and there were definitely no crunchiness to it.. Maybe this would be a different recipe.

Made the recipe as written and it was delish.  The next time I made it,   I added 1/4 cup of corn meal to the flour--it adds a little something for me.

Was told by a few, at our Christmas eve feast of the seven fishes, that these were as good, or better, than what they've eaten in the restaurant.

Loved it! I also added 1 tablespoon of bread crumbs in it.
