Excellent recipe.  I am 1/2 Italian, and spent my youth every Sunday eating home cooked sauce that took my mom 8 hours to make.  This recipe taste just like it, and only consumes 30 minutes of my time.  I love it!

This was good, although I made mine without the meat.  I didn't have a packet of spaghetti sauce mix or whatever that is called, but there is a recipe for it on this site that I referred to.  It makes a decent sauce that it very easy to make.  Thanks.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! This recipe rocks!  It was first of all, simple.  I was having my in-laws over, and they are older, and my friends from the Mid-West who don't do real spicey foods. I didn't want it to get too crazy.  THEY LOVED IT!

My family loves this sauce.  We won’t buy the jar of prepared sauce ever again; this is the only thing my family will eat now!  For an added zing we stir in a couple of thick slices of Velveeta at the end and simmer until it’s melted and stirred through.  It adds a bit of cheesy flavor and helps coat the pasta when you serve it.

I have been making this recipes from Ronnetta now for year's. This is a wonderful dish to make and much better than canned spaghetti sauce. As this being a base recipe, I have altered it in some ways. Once I have used half ground beef and half ground Italian Sausage. Usually I will add water, after the sauce simmers for about 8 minutes... 1 can of water from the tomato paste can. Then, let it simmer more and add one more can of water (with the tomato paste can) after 10 minutes.
I am starting to make this recipe again for this evening and cannot wait until it is completed!

This was a great recipe!  I added tons of water...about 1.25x the tomato paste. Fill the can once and then add some more.  It was just too thick without the water for us.  The taste was awesome. Added just a dash of salt and pepper.
As an aside, it was kind of funny.  I make all my spaghetti sauce.  When my husband saw the spaghetti sauce packages he was confused.  He had never saw me use actual seasoning packages.  I always do this on my own.
The seasoning packages were great and added a really nice flavor to the sauce! Try it! Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making a recipe similar to this for quite a few years.  The only thing I do different is omit the paste and puree a can of basil, garlic and oregano diced tomatoes, which I do because my little one won't eat it if he can see the tomatoes.  Glad to see you posted it on here, we just love it.

I tried this recipe November 2007 and my kids LOVED it!!!  I have to admit that it was delicious.  They have been bugging me to make it again.  I am heading to the store to purchase the ingredients to try it again.

Yum. We made this all the time too! A good thing to serve with it is lightly and quickly sauteed vegies. In a frying pan just heat a little butter, salt and pepper, slice up some Zoo-k-nee or mushrooms or whatever you have and place them in the pan. Serve on the side of the spaghetti, or on top.

I have found the spaghetti sauce that I will use from now on.  This was wonderful!  I don't like a sauce with a lot of "stuff" in it (mushrooms, peppers, etc).  Was looking for just a good basic sauce and this it IT! Love the thickness... runny sauces aren't a favorite in my house. Thanks for sharing this keeper.

I  forgot to get the dry spaghetti mix so I added Italian seasoning and more garlic to the sauce along with the meat.  I have a family of 6 so I decided to use two cans of tomato sauce. One just didnt seem like enough.  I also used fresh parsley and basil that I chopped and added to the sauce.  I used one pound of italian sausage and one pound of ground beef; cooked them both together with the onion and garlic and added italian seasoning.  It was a huge hit - much thicker than just using the sauce out of a jar.  I will definately use this recipe again!

Did add a little water...too thick for me, but husband loved it...also added mushrooms and italian seasoning with a tad of sugar.  Just seemed like it was missing something.

I hate cooking. I do it because I have to. I have always bought my spaghetti sauce in a glass jar - ready to use. No more! I used this recipe and wont be able to use anything else! My whole family loved it and had to have seconds. It was so simple too - which is a must for me. Five stars. Loved it and you will too - look no further - just use this one - trust me!

you've got to be kidding me!  This is what we used before jar sauce came out. This recipe belongs to the company who made the mix.  I can't believe you even posted this.

This was very thick. So thick you could stand a spoon in it. It definitely isn't going to run off the pasta. I added 1/2 c water. Not much flavor. We didn't care for this at all. I used a pkg of McCormick spaghetti sauce with mushroom. This turned out very bland. Sorry, it just wasn't for us, I guess.

I like to change up spaghetti sauces once in a while. I didn't care for this one too much but other family members really enjoyed it. I think children would especially like it as it is quite plain tasting. I'm sure I will be asked to make this again. Next time I will use the speghetti sauce mix recipe from this site rather than purchase it.

This is almost the same recipe I have been using for years, just a couple of differences.  I omit the tomato paste and use 2 15 oz cans of tomato sauce plus a big can (28 oz) of diced tomatos. I also cut it to 1 clove of garlic and 1 whole med. onion diced. At the end I sprinkle in parmesen cheese and let it cook in about 10 mins. This has been a crowd pleaser for many years and there is never left overs.

This was really good.  My boyfriend's a vegetarian, so instead of the ground beef (and instead of the fake "beef", which I find can get sort of dry and has little flavor) I added finely diced zucchini and eggplant.  We both loved it.  I added more garlic and some crushed red pepper, as well as some tabasco (which I add to everything!).  If your family isn't into spicy, then it's good as is.  By the way - if you're a vegetarian, make sure you read the spaghetti spice packet well - a lot of them contain animal ingredients.

This tastes very good and is so easy.  It took minutes to make and is not only simple but tastes great.  Never thought to use the spaghetti packet mix but it adds great flavor to the recipe.

This was good used in baked spaghetti. I did up the garlic a clove and add some finely chopped mushrooms and bell pepper. I doubled the sauce part and spices and kept the meat the same making 2 pans of baked spaghetti.

We love this sauce. Grating the onions really makes a difference! My kids no longer say "Ewww theres onions in here" Wonderful and easy. I like to add mushrooms sometimes. Freezes well and great for lasagna,ziti, etc. I will definitely use this at least twice a month on the rotation!

Not the best sauce that I've had by far, but I wouldn't say it was bad. Maybe a little too sweet & not enough spices.  Will probably look for another sauce though since my husband didn't like it.

Thank you Ronnetta for a very good recipe.  My husband and I enjoyed this sauce very much.  Me especially because of how quick and easy it was to prepare!  I had to make a couple of small changes because I didn't want to stop at the store on my way home.  I used what I had (one can whole peeled tomatoes blended instead of sauce, and turkey sausage instead of beef, plus a few added spices).  I also think this would make a great base for a long-cooking sauce as well.

We loved this sauce. I like that the onion is grated. It makes them well hidden so the kids don't complain. I did add 1 tbsp of sugar to make it less acidic and piled on the garlic, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written.

This was well received by my family. you can certainly add more spice to it if you want. It was a bit thick so I did thin it with water. I will be making this again.

THis is a basic sauce that can be used as a BASE! I followed the recipe and added green peppers, basil, mushrooms, whole garlic cloves, and I used my own dry seasonings. I slow cook it for a couple of hours and I add fresh tomatoes.

i would give this a 4 plus. my family really liked it. i used jimmy dean's reduced fat sausage instead of the hamburger meat. it couldn't have been an easier dish to whip up. literally minutes. i found it to be a little on the tangy side. maybe i could add some additional seasonings to give a richer taste. you will not be disappointed. really nice for a quick weekday meal.

I'm so grateful to Ronnetta for this recipe. I have tried in vain to make spaghetti sauce and none tasted good, but this is great. I added water to thin it out, and added a raw carrot, peeled and quartered and cooked it in the sauce to sweeten it up a little. It made 6 generous servings so i was able to freeze some. Thanks again.

Delicious!  Instead of using dry spaghetti sauce mix, I used 3 different seasonings that I had.  To the meat, garlic and onion mixture, I added 1/2 a green bell pepper.  After draining the meat mixture, I added some carrots already cooked and chopped, 1/2 a tomato and some leftover Sloppy Jo mixture from another AllRecipes.com recipe. I continued to follow the rest of the recipe using tomato sauce and tomato paste.

I love this sauce. It is so easy and my daughter loves helping me make it. She calls it ‘her’ sauce. I never pick up premade jar sauce at the grocery store anymore. Even when I’m in a time crunch. It’s that EASY! I’ve made it without the onions and meat and it tastes just as good. Thank you!

This is fabulous! I don't know why it's so much better than other sauce recipes, but it is. I don't put meat in it because I like to make my own meatballs. My family enjoys the thick, stick to the noodles, consistency. Tastes better the next day! It's a ski trip staple...make a batch, cool, put in Ziploc and lay flat to freeze. Packs well and is a comforting easy meal after a day on the slopes.

I found this recipe when I was searching for a spaghetti sauce my son would actually eat. This was a home run with him so I've been making it ever since & that was about four years ago. I add a can of diced tomatoes & will occasionally  add some chopped bell peppers since I prefer a thick & chunky sauce.

One of the easier homemade sauces.  It had good flavor, the one thing I would do next time is drain the meat before adding the other ingredients.

A very basic sauce, but bland. So I added some fresh herbs and that did the job. It is a good basic, quick sauce though.
