Both in quality and texture, this is one of the best ice creams I've ever made. I had none of the issues or criticisms others experienced like graininess, flecks of chocolate, consistency, freezing time, etc. In my opinion this is a flawless recipe, and my suggestion is to use the finest chocolate your budget can afford. I used 3 ozs. of Scharffenberger chocolate (by accident!) and it was perfect, tho' die hard chocoholics might even appreciate another ounce. This had a smooth, velvety mouth feel, totally creamy, chocolatey and rich. This is every bit as good as the frozen custard Wisconsin is so famous for. The directions are well written and easy to follow. No need to change or add a thing--unless you have some unexplainable burning desire to do so!

Don't be fooled by these ratings. Have been making homemade ice cream for years. This recipe will not freeze. In over an hour run time the best I can say is that it thickened. Taste is average at best.

Very TASTY Recipe! The only change to the ingredients was that I used half & half instead of the milk.  Also after the chocolate was melted I put the pan in ice water for 2 minutes then wisked in the cream & vanilla, then refrigerated the mixture for several hours before freezing.  This version is how my other ice cream recipes are made and they have all turned out great!

I agree with some others who had trouble getting this to freeze, except... I persisted and now I rate this a 5 star. On my first batch, I hurried.  I didn't "temper" the eggs properly (that's where you take warm mix out, add to egg & return to the pan).  And I threw in semi sweet chips that I presumed had melted sufficiently.  Then I failed to chill well before putting in my machine.  Worse yet, I used my Cuisinart freezer that allows a fairly thick build-up in the canister between the dasher & the edge, preventing the center from getting to the coldest area.  The band-aid was to put the half-frozen mix into a shallow container in the freezer and stir every few hours until it was ice cream.  Tasted good, but had "bits" (either choc chip or egg - not sure)  The CURE is: follow the directions!  Do not boil, properly temper the eggs, use as tiny chocolate bits as you can (shaved is best), chill completely before freezing, and use a maker whose dasher really scrapes the canister edge. (My Waring did great)  If you don't hurry, you will be rewarded with a very rich, delicious ice cream.  As another reviewer stated - not overly chocolate in flavor, but exceptionally rich in taste & texture.

Excellent!  Instead of the 2 oz unsweetened chocolate, both times I have made this I have used a 3.5 oz good quality dark chocolate bar.  (Lindt 85% cocoa)  Probably the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had!

This ICE CREAM is so good. The only problem I had with it that it was so think I had a hard time getting it to freeze and it would be something you might make and let freeze all day. Thank you for sharing.

We have made this ice cream 3 or 4 times.  It is wonderful!!  I always pour it through a sieve to make sure that I get lumps out.  I have also made it with any combination of half and half and cream.  Yummy.  Also, I  have stirred in peanut butter to make chocolate peanut butter and it is wonderful!  My family gives it 2 thumbs up!  Great recipe and very easy!

This was a fantastic ice cream.  I did make some changes to accomadate nearly sugarless diet.  I used 3/8 c agave nectar and 3/8c splenda.  I accidentally added only 2 egg yolks and instead of semisweet chocolate, used giradelli unsweetened dark chocolate.  I also added 2 1/2 c heavy.  It was GREAT!!!  Sure beats that no sugar added stuff in the market!!!

Oh. My. Gosh. This has to be one of the best things I have ever tasted.  So perfectly creamy and smooth and chocolaty.  Heaven help me.  
I cooked the milk mixture with the egg yolks to 180 degrees, removed from heat, and dumped in the finely chopped Bakers Semi-Sweet chocolate and let it sit a few minutes, then stirred until melted completely.  Refrigerated it overnight.  Added the cream and vanilla just before freezing in my ice-cream maker.  Absolute perfection.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I made this as chocolate flan, and was it ever luscious! I used unsweetened chocolate, so it ended up being a bittersweet custard that contrasted nicely with the caramel. It was a little soft-textured, though, so next time I think I'll use one whole egg and two yolks so that the flans will hold their shape better once they're unmolded. Perfect chocolate flavor.

WOW!!! This is better than Haggen Daaz.  This ice cream is smooth and creamy.  The chocolate is rich and deep.  Use quality ingredients, and it will turn out perfectly!  Invest in good cocoa; the price difference isn't that much. Trader Joe's Belgian chocolate is affordable and a great quality.

Great recipe!  I also tried this using 1% milk, instead of whole, and half 'n half for the heavy cream.  Everyone at the cookout couldn't believe it was light ice cream.

This is the first ice cream I've ever made and it is sooo good! I used whole milk, heavy whipping cream and Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate. The ice cream texture is smooth, creamy and rich and it set up beautifully! I did strain my custard mixture before putting it in the refrigerator. I'm a chocoholic, so I have to admit I added an extra ounce of the semisweet chocolate plus chocolate chips. Love this recipe! It is decadent and I will definitely make it again.

SO GOOD! This was my very first homemade ice cream ever, made in my Christmas-gift Cuisinart ice cream maker (which, btw, is worth the price tag vs. other models I've seen friends use). I chose this one vs. the other highly rated chocolate ice cream on this site because this one contains tempered eggs rather than raw ones. I did not adjust the recipe save to use heaping tablespoons of cocoa rather than level ones, just because I'm lazy and you can never have too much cocoa. The flavor is almost identical to that of homemade chocolate cream pie (minus the crust, of course!). I had high expectations for this recipe, but I must say this has thoroughly exceeded them. As a note to others who have had trouble, your grainy texture is most likely tiny bits of scrambled egg from improperly tempered eggs --chocolate mixture too hot when you added it to your egg yolks, or, didn't stir it fast enough after adding it to the yolks. Thank you so much for posting this wondeful recipe, it will make my husband's birthday party great!

This was absolutely amazing!  Please, please make this.  I am an ice cream freak, and it was the best ice cream I have ever eaten.  I used half and half instead of whole milk because that's what I had.  For the chocolate, I used Nestle's baking cocoa powder and Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips.  I also love mint ice creams, so I added 3 drops (it is very strong, so don't do more than that!) of peppermint OIL.  All I can say is wow, wow, wow!  You cannot get this at a store.  For the second batch, I added crushed Oreos, and it tasted EXACTLY like a DQ Girl Scout cookie Thin Mint Blizzard.

Very very very good! What more is there to say that already hasn't been said. I used bittersweet chocolate. I didn't feel the need to use the vanilla and in my opinion it was not needed. To help with  cocoa lumps mix the cocoa and sugar well before adding the milk. Excellent recipe. **Update** I was too lazy to make icecream so I poured the liquid into an popsicle mold and had the best ever chocolate popsicle!

This is the best ice cream I have ever made. The flavor is rich and delicious and the texture is smooth and dreamy. I doubled the recipe and used whole milk. I also poured the mixture through a strainer to get rid of any chocolate chunks and egg yolk bits that didn't dissolve. It really helps with the texture. With the recipe doubled, it made about 2 quarts, plenty for my family. My dad tasted the base before freezing it and he said it was so good, he would've eaten that! Thank you so much for this recipe. Will be keeping it forever!

Awesome creamy ice cream. This turned out prefect despite me using only two eggs because I didn't have three and not tempering the eggs, the step the directions called for. I used a small handful of Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips and 1 ounce of 99% cacao. I just had to improvise a bit with that I had on hand this time. I will make this again and again! Thanks!

I followed the recipe and instructions and it was super runny still 20 minutes into freezing it in my ice cream maker. I have never had this problem before so now I'm trying to figure out how to fix it so a whole batch of ice cream doesn't get turned into a very expensive chocolate milk.

superb recipe.  I did some changing around by adding more chocolate and used 2 hot chocolate packets instead of cocoa powder.  I also added a bit more vanilla and it tasted great.  (I dont suggest messing with the vanilla amount..  cept my wife wants vanilla in everything.  )

Wow! This is the best homemade chocolate ice cream I've ever had. Used high fat Dutch processed cocoa and 60% dark Ghirardelli baking chocolate. I can't wait to see how it ripens and to add brownie chunks next time- just like my favorite from Ben and Jerry's

O. M. G. This is amazing!  I made it twice. The first time I used Hersheys special dark cocoa and ghiardelli dark chocolate.  It was delicious. The second time I followed the directions exactly, except I used ghiardelli sweet ground instead of unsweetened cocoa, and it was also amazing. After I took it out of the ice cream maker, I drizzled melted chocolate (semi sweet, but you can use any) slowly into the ice cream while whisking it. It hardens like the chocolate does in stracciatella gelato and I really can't stress how good it tastes.  Little bits of thin flaky chocolate. Yuuum. You would never know this ice cream is homemade. Not sure why people had trouble with it hardening. I didn't have issues either time I made it.

Mmmm. Good ice cream! I've been craving something sweet all week, but nothing "too" sweet. This was perfect - creamy, smooth & mildly sweet. Although you can taste it, the chocolate note is not star here (Wendy's recipe is not overpowering or artificial tasting, despite my hubby's comment that it was "very" chocolatey lol!). If you want a more intense chocolate flavor, top your ice cream w/ chocolate syurp (the beauty of this is that it can be as sweet as you want it to be). I too had issues as AKBMEIER did, but not for the same reasons. I had no problem w/ the cooking process (i.e. tempering, melting, cooling). My hiccup was not using my (KitchenAid) ice cream maker correctly. :( In retrospect, I SHOULD have mixed my cooled chocolate, cream & vanilla together BEFORE adding to my canister. B/c I didn't, my chocolate froze, thus causing a thick build-up b/t my dasher & the edge of my canister. I almost had to give up (my dasher couldn't churn b/c everthing froze up b4 it had a chance to). In the future, I'll be more careful. :) The good news is that I was able to salvage everything w/o ruining the end product (i.e no unmixed chunks). My only complaint is that compared to other ice cream recipes, this takes a while to freeze. If you enjoy soft serve ice cream, this will be right up your alley. All in all, this is a great, basic "chocolate" ice cream recipe (not really "very" chocolately tho, IMHO...). My hubby approves of me making this again & I agree! Thanks WENDYWR! :-)

This was rather goooood!!! So tasty and yummy. I really don't have any complaints about this recipe. I will try it again using splenda in place of the sugar. My kids just scarfed it down. The batch as gone just after it was ready to be served. I guess I'll have to make another batch... ;)

This was easy to do and very rich and delicious.  The only problem I had was that it didn't freeze very well.  The next day the leftovers tasted flat. But we will definitely make this again!

WOW! I am tempted to skip dinner and just dive in to this ice cream. I just finished making it in my new ice cream maker and it is fabulous! Be sure to use the best possible ingredients for the best product. I used Ghirardelli cocoa which is Dutch processed. I hadn't really planned ahead and the only semisweet chocolate I had was Hershey's mini chips and I did use three ounces as recommended by Naples. I also used very good vanilla extract. I poured the mixture through a sieve before chilling. I didn't have any problem with getting it to freeze. I suspect that those who did made one of three mistakes: Be sure to cook your mixture enough. It should be thick like chocolate pudding while it's cooking; Be sure to cool your mixture thoroughly. I left a stainless soup spoon in which conducts the heat out and makes it chill faster; Finally, you do have to make sure, if you use an ice cream maker with a frozen insert or bowl, that your insert or bowl is thoroughly frozen. I added miniature peanut butter cups cut in half at the end for chocolate peanut butter cup ice cream. I can tell from just tasting this as I put it into a container and into the freezer that this will be some of the best ice cream I have ever eaten (and, believe me, I have eaten more than my share of ice cream!). My waistline will suffer but my taste buds thank you WendyWR!

This recipe is wonderful! I used nestle semi-sweet chocolate chips and they melted perfectly. I also froze the mix in the freezer and while stirring in every 30 minutes instead of using and ice cream maker. The ice cream is very sweet and chocolatey. It gas great texture and by far better than any other ice cream I've had! I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a great tasting treat!!

Absolutely the best homemade chocolate ice cream I have made to date.  Easy to make, ingredients easily had and the choice of chocolates you have to put in your ice cream depending on your taste are endless.  The flavor and texture are just prefect to my liking.  My family insist this go in the recipe box.

This is the first recipe I've tried with my new ice cream maker and it turned out delicious!!!!!  It was soft-serve consistency after churning for 25 minutes and after 3 hours in the freezer, it is the consistency of store bought.  Wow.  That's all I can say, is WOW.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I cooled the first part down in an ice bath before cooling in the fridge.  I will make this again and again...oh, and I used a chopped up Hershey bar since I had no fine chocolate...didn't think chocolate chips would do.  Okay, okay, one more thing-  I also poured it through a strainer after heating and I'm glad I did because I was able to capture some egg-type chunks.  Thanks for a great go-to recipe!  The kids and hubby loved it...

I halved the recipe and made it in two batches in my tiny half-pint ice cream maker.  I used half as much sugar as called for.  This is the first homemade ice cream recipe I've made and it's amazing-- lucious-tasting and incredibly smooth.  I'm making it for the third time right now, and will make it many more times!

Fabulous and perfect.  I've made it twice now.  Once, with dark chocolate flecks added before freezing.  Second time, it was a base for Rocky Road.  It's the perfect chocolate custard style ice cream.  It took about 35-40 minutes to freeze in my ice cream maker.  It then went into the freezer over night.  Smooth, creamy, scoopable, and a premium taste. Just follow the directions and you'll enjoy it too.

This ice cream is so good.  I used 2 oz of 60% to 80% cocoa this was what I had and 1 TBS instant coffee granules.  It made a chocolatey creamy delish ice cream.  I am trying this today as a vanilla version no cocoa powder or chocolate with 1 vanilla bean simmered in the custard.

Very good!  I'm not a huge chocolate ice cream fan, but the richness is great.  For those concerned about scrambled eggs, I would recommend straining the mixture after it cooks.

VERY CHOCOLATY!   In place of semisweet chocolate, I used 2 ozs. of unsweetened chocolate plus 8 teaspoons of sugar.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you WENDYWR for sharing!

I make ice cream at least once a week during the summer and this is the best ice cream recipe I have ever tasted.  As written, it has a smooth, thick and creamy (yet not greasy) texture and the perfect chocolate flavor.  I altered the recipe only slightly; I used special dark cocoa powder, and added chopped almonds.  Also, I did not refrigerate the mixture for two hours, only let it cool on the stove to room temp before putting in my ice cream machine and I had no problem with it freezing.  PERFECT!

This is hands down the best Chocolate Ice Cream I have made.  I added 2 whole eggs instead of the 3 egg yolks, mixing it in with the milk and cream before cooking, and didn't measure the chocolate chips, (I figured 2 hands full was enuff).  Smooth and creamy, it was wonderful.  Will make this again and again.

LOVED this ice cream!  It firmed up wonderfully, which rarely seems to happen with home made ice cream.  I threw in some mini marshmallows and chopped nuts and had a great rocky road.  I'm going to pour my next batch into a gram cracker crust, and make an ice cream pie.  This recipe is a keeper!

Perfect chocolate ice cream! Just came home from an ice cream party and this was just delicious! I used
3 oz of Scharffen Berger extra dark chocolate. I started grating it but that took too long to do so I put it in my Cuisanart and got it as fine as I could,
I added it to the custard over a very low heat and continued to stir until it was completely melted. This eliminated the tiny pieces of chocolate some reviewers didn't like. Of course if you want pieces of chocolate just follow the orininal recipe. I also refrigerated the mixture overnight before putting into the ice cream maker.If you like soft serve ice cream you can eat it immediately from your ice cream maker. I froze mine in a stainless steel container so we could make nice scoops for our sundaes.
It was realllllly good!

I followed this recipe exactly and was very disappointed.  It took a long time to freeze and the flavors were off.  It wasn't chocolaty at all, but tasted more like a wendy's frostee.  that said, i do enjoy a good frostee, so it wasn't too bad!

LOVE this ice cream!  Very chocolatey, smooth texture, and freezes very well.  Stays creamy and smooth even after being in the freezer several days (unlike lots of other homemade ice creams). I followed the recipe exactly, which I rarely do.  Wouldn't change a thing!

The BEST chocolate ice cream recipe I have ever made. Smooth, velvety texture. I pour it through a sieve prior to refrigeration, so there aren't  any lumps. The people who have had trouble with this not freezing, may have skipped the refrigeration step? I make this every week and have never had that issue.

Fabulous!  This was my first time making ice cream ever in my life, and it came out wonderful. After reading some of the reviews I added an additional ounce of dark chocolate, and poured the chocolate mixture through a strainer before chilling it...was glad that I did, because I could see where I strained out some little bits of egg that I had not properly tempered...other than that, followed the recipe exactly and it was SO good.  A keeper!

This was very yummy, rich and creamy.  I would not change a thing.  I had no trouble getting it to freeze as others have commented on.  Perhaps it's because I put the chocolate mixture in the freezer for about 2-1/2 hours to get it really cold before mixing with the heavy cream.  It was not frozen but just really cold before I put in my ice cream maker.  My husband said it was "excellent".  We ate it with toasted slivered almonds and a touch of whipped cream.  Yum.

Outstanding recipe. Made this twice this week, once with heavy cream and once with half and half. No problems at all with this freezing up even with my rinky-dink little ice cream maker. I added an extra ounce of dark chocolate and extra tablespoon of cocoa to each batch. I did put this through a sieve as recommended by others and also took another's suggestion to cool it in a pan of ice water for a few minutes rather than chill for 2 hours. This is now my go to recipe for chocolate ice cream. I did use shaved ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate for the second batch...yum!

I just made this today and it's fantastic!  It's definitely the best homemade ice cream that I've made. In fact, we're supposed to serve it tonight for dessert with friends and my husband wants me to keep it all for us. I'm making back-up brownies to serve to our guests now. :-)

I followed the directions exactly except that rather than refrigerating for 2 hours, I put in the freezer for about an hour because I was short on time.  I used plain old, Nestle mini chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand and it turned out great.  I can't wait to try again with better quality dark chocolate.

This was the PERFECT chocolate ice cream recipe!! Taste and texture were spot on... I felt like I was putting frozen ganache in my mouth... I did double the amount of semisweet chocolate (I used Ghirardelli chips), but I don't know that it  was necessary. As another reviewer mentioned: DO NOT BOIL, make sure your chocolate is in small pieces (GRATE if possible), and use the best chocolate that fits your budget. You'll LOVE the results. O, and if you can find it... use MEXICAN Vanilla!!

I love this recipe!  When followed completely through, it yields a rich chocolate flavor and ultra creamy.  The consistency prior to placing in the freezer is like a very thick shake.  What an excellent ice cream!

This is the best ice cream EVER! I will never use another chocolate ice cream recipe. I made this for some friends and they couldn't quit raving over it. Follow the instructions exactly and you will have a perfect, velvety smooth and rich ice cream!

I had only Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, so I added some espresso powder as well.  The best ice cream I've ever tasted.  My family loved it too!  Thanks so much!!!

Amazing! The only change I made was to increase the cocoa to 1/3 cup because I didn't have any semisweet chocolate to melt into it. (It was really nice to be able to skip that step, too.) The flavor was fantastic and the ice cream ended up firm, smooth, creamy and rich. I've made a lot of homemade ice cream lately, but this was my first time trying a custard style. I will definitely be trying this type for other flavors and will be using this recipe a lot!

The best chocolate ice cream ever! I substituted a 3.5 70% cocoa Lindt choc bar for the semi-sweet. I used Hersey's dark European style cocoa powder instead of regular, and made the tablespoons heaping. I cut the sugar to 2/3 cup. I used my in-pan blender gizmo to whip this recipe at every stage. Result? Froze hard and was beyond dark in flavor. In my next try i'm going to add Starbucks expresso instant coffee as a further flavor booster. My version of this recipe will be named Nuclear Chocolate.

I am not a mega chocolate lover and thought the additional semi-sweet chocolate might be a bit much so i left it out.  Loved the result.

I added some extra chocololate, and it tasted very good, but would not freeze in the ice cream maker. I'm going to find another recipe that works.

This was my first time making ice cream. I borrowed my neighbors ice cream maker and I will say that this tasted wonderful. Mine ended up more like soft serve but thats probably due to my lack of experience. I topped it off with sprinkles and 'Chocolate Syrup' from this site.

I just made this and it is GREAT!  I changed it up to be healthier and will share for those who are curious...as I always am;)  I used NutraSweet (no sugar) 1/2 & 1/2 (no milk or cream) and intense dark chocolate instead of semisweet.  Super super chocolatey and creamy as well.  I don't know how it would be, as far as consistency, if frozen for a long period of time, as it will not last that long, but it seems like it would freeze too solid, probably because of the 1/2 & 1/2...so if you are to try this I would try adding the bit of alcohol at the end to keep it scoopable.  Hope this helps someone:)

Great flavor and great consistency. I did have some issues with the ice cream being kind of gritty but that was an error on my part. I had a hard time melting my chocolate evenly so there were a lot of tiny chunks of chocolate that made it gritty. Next time I'm going to melt the chocolate separately and then add it to the cream.

This really is the best custard style chocolate ice cream I have made yet. Froze in my ice cream maker within 25 minutes as usual and when put in the freezer for a couple more hours had a perfect consistency.  I loved that it did not overfreeze in the freezer.   Follow the directions step by step especially cooling the bowls and making sure your ice cream bowl is very frozen prior to making.  I do recommend using sea salt instead of table salt and 60 percent cocoa instead of semi sweet chocolate.  Using good quality chocolate makes a huge difference in the flavor.

Wonderful as is -- incredibly rich and soft, and stays well in the freezer for several days without developing a chalky texture.  Can't wait to make it again!

SO GOOD! This was my first time making ice cream (as an adult, as a child I always helped my mom used to make it with a hand crank machine and chipped ice) so I wasn't sure what to expect. I've made custard before though so I had that part knocked. This turned out excellent for me. I used skim milk and only 1 cup of cream as that's all I had in the fridge. I also used 70% dark chocolate. I bet the quality of chocolate you use makes all the difference here. If you use cheap, it'll taste cheap. It still came out incredibly smooth and fudgy even with the skim milk, so I'll do it that way every time (and there WILL be others) I make this to shave off a few calories. Hands down better than any ice cream you can get at the store. I also baked a few double chocolate cookies, crumbled them and popped them into my kitchen aid about 15 minutes into the churning.  Absolute bliss - I'll never buy chocolate ice cream again.

INCREDIBLE!!! I used 1/2 and 1/2 rather than milk.... plain 'ol Hershey's cocoa powder and Baker's chocolate. Very good, very rich! Just what I was looking for. Not a single bit grainy. Froze just fine. I will try with more expensive chocolates just to play, but, WOW! Don't be fooled by negative reviews.

excellent recipe.  this was just divine.  very smooth and froze very well.   this is a sweet ice cream.  for those with a smaller sweet tooth, you could easily use 1/2 the sugar and it would still be tasty.  from now on, this will become our standard chocolate ice cream recipe.   thanks for sharing!

I misread the quantity of chocolate, instead of 2 oz, I mixed in 2 cups! I added about 1/3 of peanut butter along with the chocolate. I put the mixture into my ice cream maker bowl which I frozed for 2 days prior, then put in the refridgerator for less than an hr. Took it out and pour in heavy cream and vanilla extract. I also added 1/4 tsp of almond extract just because I love almond mix in with everything dessert. Then I let my machine do the mixing for 15 mins. It was less than 3 hrs in the freezer before my husband cannot resist any longer, took it out and start eating. It was frozen well, just like the ones you get at Ben and Jerry's. YUM! 5 STARS RECIPE!

I have no idea why someone would say this didn't turn out anything less than spectacular!   Maybe they messed up on the directions, because I made this, and my daughter says this the best ice cream she's ever had in her life!  I have to say, it was pretty divine!  I used all organic ingredients, and it was the bomb!!

I messed up this recipe in more ways that I care to admit, but the proportions are EXACT for my large Cuisinart ice cream machine. According to Ben & Jeffey, the "secret" ingredient to ice cream is air. Not a single recipe I've tried leaves enough room to let the air incorporate. This one does. I made this recipe for a sick friend who LOVES Greater's ice cream, so I was up against heavy competition :-) He was delighted and says it's as good as Greater's. Another reviewer mentioned that the Cuisinart's dasher doesn't scrape the sides well enough. True, true. This time I stuck a sturdy cooking spatula down the opening a few times to give the sides and bottom a good scrape and it was like magic. I also added marshmallows because that's what the friend wanted. Seemed a  bit too sweet for me, but he liked it. Now I'll go back to the proportions -- PERFECT!! This will be my go-to base for all my ice creams from now on. Thanks for posting it.  Um, can I add something about the eggs? I've tested mixing everything together and bringing it to 175 in a double boiler against tempering the eggs and then adding to a single pan. Every single test gave me *fewer* eggy bits (as in none) when it was strained if I started with all ingredients heated at once. Go figure.

Followed the recipe exactly. The Bakers Semi-Sweet Chocolate that I used left a slight grainy texture. I had read in the reviews before I made it that someone else had the same issue so I ran it through a sieve. Next time I'll strain it through cheesecloth. Even though it had that slight grainy texture, every ounce of it was consumed. I had no problem getting it to freeze in my Cuisinart ice cream maker. As with any ice cream recipe, the mixture must be very cold before you put it in the machine.

I've been using this recipe for about 3 years now and love it. I double it each time. I've never had any issues with it till yesterday and thought I'd post about it. In some reviews people mention graininess or flecks of chocolate. I've never experienced this till yesterday. If you do not follow the instructions EXACTLY this will likely happen to you. I heated the sugar/milk/salt/cocoa powder too long. There was no scorching but I did have a tiny bit of egg cook and it had to be strained. The other thing I did wrong was add the chocolate before the mixture was thickened. The result was chocolate specks throughout the ice cream. The specks were consistent so I called the ice cream Double Chocolate Ice Cream and got rave reviews. Our guests couldn't believe how the chocolate specks were so evenly distributed throughout the ice cream and they loved the taste. I made the recipe again today following the instructions EXACTLY. It turned out how it was supposed to be: rich, smooth, creamy with no specks of chocolate. This recipe reminds me of Talenti Milk Chocolate ice cream. It's really that good.

I have made this so many times! The chocolate is yummy but I actually use this recipe minus the coco powder and chocolate as a base. I have made vanilla, strawberry and mint Oreo. I just add what I want before I put it in the mixer. However, if you must add chocolate I suggest adding peanut butter cups before you mix. So yummy!!!

This recipe is RICH! In my electric frozen-bowl type ice cream maker, it made about 1.5 quarts, in about 12 minutes. A small scoop of this deliciousness is just about all you'll want - unless you're an 11 year old boy...mine ate two scoops and begged for more.

One tiny note: I made the recipe exactly as written, with one exception: I always temper eggs more slowly by drizzling a little hot mixture into the beaten egg yolks while beating with a fork, then drizzle a little more and a little more until I have slowly added about a third of the mixture, and then I pour the tempered eggs back into the pan. I've never had any cooked bits of egg with this method and therefore never have to strain.

Good recipe, double the chocolate and mix in the cream while the chocolate mixture is warm. If you follow the directions the texture is grainy. BTW, I didn't have any trouble at all getting it to freeze... I did "temper" the eggs, but if you don't do that you get little lumps pf scrabbled eggs, not unfreezing. I did double the chocolate, not sure if that made the difference. ALso I didn't bother chopping the chocolate into peices, I just broke the bar up with my hands. Adding to to the hot mixture both metals the chocolate and starts the cooling process. Like adding cold butter when making bernaise. Just be sure to whisk until it is glossy and smooth. 

Finally adding the cream into the warm chocolate means I let it cool longer to be sure it was well and truely chilled, but that's it. I have the Cusinart. Four stars because not whisking the cream in with the warm chocolate is a rookie mistake, bad advice, bad recipe.

Where is the 10 star box!  I now use this as a base for all my ice cream.  I did start out making the chocolate, then I made it without the chocolate ingredients.  And I also made STRAWBERRY and OREO COOKIE ice cream!  I think the strawberry turned out the best, next to the plain vanilla.  I used frozen strawberries; thru them in a bowl to thaw with 1/4 cup sugar; cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup to the milk.  Once the strawberries were thawed, I put them in my "bullet" to puree before adding to the cream mixture.  I will never be buying store bought ice cream again. And yes, take your time making the custard - you won't be sorry.

This Chocolate Ice Cream was fantastic!  We just got a new Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker for Christmas and having NEVER made home-made ice cream before, I am trying out recipes.  I did add 3 oz. of chopped chocolate but that was the only addition/change.  I strongly recommend that you pour the mixture through a sieve as it is poured into the chilled bowl in step one.  I am not new to tempering eggs, but after pouring the mixture through the sieve, I found tiny thread-like pieces of cooked eggs in the mixture, and those could have harmed the texture of the finished ice cream.  All in all an A+ !

My family really enjoyed the recipe.  It was nice and creamy and we used a hand crank to make it perfect.  

I mixed different types of  chocolate to help it.  Most was very good German Chocolate.

While this is very nice, it certainly isn't "Very Chocolate." I think I'll try it again, with substantially more cocoa and boil it in a little coffee before adding the other ingredients.

I hadn't really given much thought to making chocolate ice cream until I saw this recipe. I wondered whether the texture and flavor would live up to my expectations of what I like in a chocolate ice cream...smooth and chocolaty. Happily, my family was all surprised how good the outcome of this was- never having "homemade" chocolate ice cream before!   I'm not sure why others had the freezing problems. I think perhaps their base or ice cream freezer wasn't cold enough.

Excellent, simple recipe.  We used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate and the level of chocolate flavor is EXCELLENT!  We followed the recipe exactly and had absolutely no problems with it freezing or anything else.  If you are a chocolate fanatic, try this and you'll be very happy.  We doubled the recipe and folded in chopped up "butterfinger cups" at the end but the possibilities are endless!  ENJOY

Good recipe. Simple and easy to make. I substituted 1% milk for the whole milk and half and half for the heavy whipping cream.  I did this mostly because I don't like the greasy mouth feel that heavy cream leaves when heavy cream is used.
I also used 4 egg yolks instead of 3 and 2.5 ounces of Nestles Tollhouse semi sweet chocolate chips. Ill be making this recipe again, but next time Ill strain the mixture before melting the chocolate chips in to rid of any tiny clumps. Great recipe, yummy.

I agree with all the positive reviews- this is excellent when followed to the etter! Extremely rich and custardy. However...I also agree with the sentiment that it isn't very chocolatey. Its very *good* but a more modest, milk-chocolate flavor as opposed to like a rich chocolate. I had no issues with freezing but I tempered the eggs- I streamed the chocolate in and whisked with a fork while streaming in- and I chilled for a few hours before freezing. Also, my cuisinart kind of sucks at scraping the ice cream away from the sides so I had to help it out using a knife.

I did have issues with a bit of graininess/chewiness that seemed like chocolate bits. It was actually yummy but next time I will grate the semisweet chocolate as opposed to just chopping it.

OH.DEAR.GOD - This ice cream recipe is the best!  I used half and half instead of the milk as others have done also.  I put the mixture in the freezer for 1/2 hour before putting it in the ice cream maker - I'm new to the ice cream maker world and found this trick out after a failed batch wouldn't thicken. This thickened up with no problems.  The texture is SOOO creamy.  I swirled natural peanut butter in before final freeze.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!

Second time making this and it was even better this time.  I subbed light cream for the milk and heavy cream, increased cocoa to 1/4 cup, increased chocolate to 3 oz, and added 2T rum.  The result was a very rich and chocolatey ice cream.  On a side note, the mix was very thick after sitting in the fridge overnight, almost like pudding.  However, it froze in my ice cream maker with no trouble at all.

I just made this recipe, I actually took a shortcut with the cooling, and froze for 45 minutes, put in the cheapest 2 quart Wal-Mart special ice cream freezer for 35 minutes. My family commented that the flavor was better than the local custard (Sheridan's) store's chocolate custard. We wiped it out in less than 10 minutes. Maybe would be better if we made 4X the recipe in a good gallon sized freezer and froze it harder. EXCELLENT already have a second batch in the refrigerator for tomorrow.

Excellent recipe. I substituted heavy cream for nonfat raspberry yogurt and I substituted the unsweetened chocolate with some chocolate easter bunny I had lying around. It is thick and creamy. Add some frozen raspberries for an extra kick of flavor!

I made this on Saturday last and it was eaten right out of the ice cream maker.  I was lucky enough to save a small portion for myself.  I will definitely make it again because the texture is creamy and its not overpoweringly sweet. We added pecans. YUMMY!!!!

I made the custard base and oh man! It is delicious!! I used dark cocoa powder and then melted milk chocolate chips in place of the chocolate...waiting for it to cool...and I'm going to whip the whipping cream before adding it.  Make it fluffier..

I made this using 4 squares (out of 8) of a 3.5 oz  Lindt Excellence 70% Cocoa Smooth Dark bar. I tried grating it but it was too fine and was melting in my hands so I threw it in the food processor for a few seconds. I also used a wire whisk while heating sugar mixture on stove for better mixing. It was so yummy that I was eating it right out of the ice cream maker while it was going 'round.   The texture was so creamy.

I used an Emergency Dark Chocolate bar instead of semi-sweet, and it turned out great! Also, I didn't have an ice cream maker at my disposal, so I had to use the freezer, but I had no problems freezing the ice cream at all. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this ice cream is the best chocolate ice cream I've ever made.  Will continue making it this way from now on.  We also had the problem with the chunks- I think some of my eggs did curdle as hard as I tried to not let it happen.  Simple solution was to use a colander and strain them out, and viola!  Delicious, velvety, chocolate ice cream.  Next time, I'll be doubling it because it didn't last long....

This was my first ice cream recipe ever.  I only had 1 ounce chocolate square, so I used a little extra cocoa powder.  Everything else was the exact same.  My family and I all LOVED this recipe.  Thanks for posting.

We loved this ice-cream!  I didn't have any problems getting it to freeze.  After adding the egg and heating again, I removed the milk/egg mixture from  the heat and stirred in chocolate chips.  Once they were melted, I stirred in the cream.  The cold cream, cooled the mixture quickly and after about a half hour in the freezer, it was ready for my ice-cream freezer.It's smooth and rich and perfectly chocolatey.  I will definitely be making it again.

This recipe is so rich that you really don't eat that much at once; because it is so satisfying. 
I double and triple this recipe often (single recipe is simply not enough) and add a tablespoon or so of strong coffee for each batch to bring out the chocolate flavor even more.  Chocolate chips melt better than chopping the chocolate and I use organic milk, cream and eggs.  Be sure to chill thoroughly before processing in the ice cream maker or it will take a LONG time to freeze.

I made it as written only I doubled the recipe  and The taste was excellent very rich and creamy.  My only issue with this is that it was more of a chocolate mousse versus ice cream.   I am putting it in the freezer to see how it is frozen solid and not soft serve.

This turned out awesome!  It was very rich, with a smooth texture.  I used two handfuls of chocolate chips, and they froze into the tiniest little bits of chocolate throughout the ice cream.  It was pretty tasty!  I'd definitely make it again.

Awesome recipe!! Very good, I had no problem with it freezing to soft serve in my machine.  It is now in the freezer "ripening".  Tomorrow it will be firm like store bought ice cream.  Anytime I've ever made ice cream, that is the necessary steps to get it just right, so not sure what people are having problems with or they don't know about the "ripening" step.

The only change I made was that instead of using 2 cups of heavy cream (I just couldn't fathom all that fat), I used 1 cup cream and 1 cup milk, on top of the initial cup of milk.  I sneaked a few bites before putting it in the freezer and it was AMAZING!!!  I don't know how I'll wait.

I also did like a few other people and I strained it after melting in the chocolate.

I loved this recipe. Doubled it for my ice cream maker and it was perfect. Substituted Splenda for half the sugar and thought it tasted just like the real stuff. I also used regular whipping cream instead of the heavy to lighten it a little. GREAT!

We got a Cuisinart ice cream maker for Christmas this year, and this is the second-ever batch of ice cream, and the first custard-based, we've made. Everyone loved it! I did add one step to the prep, and that was to strain the mixture after adding and simmering the egg yolks, and before adding the chocolate. I was glad I did as I did find tiny pieces of "something" that came out in the sieve. Two other changes I made was to use semi-sweet baking morsels (I had no big block to use) and to add 1 tsp. of espresso powder to the mix. The chocolate chips did not melt all the way, but it added a nice texture to the finished product. The espresso powder idea I got from baking, where it does not add a real coffee flavor but really "kicks up" the overall result. My DH gave the review, "It tastes like professional ice cream!" My 7 yr old son just wolfed it down!  I'll definitely make again!

My family loves a custardy, chocolaty ice cream and we liked the flavor of this made with Scharfenberger chocolate and Penzey’s cocoa.   I have learned after years of ice cream making, however, that cooling the cooked mixture, adding the final ingredients and refrigerating overnight is the way to go, so  that is what I did to avoid the problems that so many others had with this recipe.  The overnight cooling makes a world of difference in assuring that the ice cream freezes appropriately.   Although good, this recipe does not compete with “Chocolate Velvet Ice Cream” from this site.

This is my second time making icecream with my Kitchen-aid stand mixer and icecream maker attachment.  I followed the instructions exactly, and I used relatively cheap chocolate (Hershey's cocoa powder, Nestles chocolate chips).    It turned out fantastic!  No problems with texture, no scrambled eggs chunks in the mix, no problems getting it to freeze.  My guess is the dude who said he's been making icecream for years and couldn't get this to get more than thick after an hour of mixing should invest in some new equipment.  Pretty stoked about this one!

Amazing ice cream. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Had no problem w/ it freezing. I always chill over night before I put it in the machine. Usually only takes 20-30 min. to become ice cream.

I used 2 cups of 2% milk and 1 cup of whipping cream, because that's what I had at the house. The chopped up chocolate left specks of in the ice cream, which I don't mind at all - tastes like bits of brownies to me. My boyfriend doesn't like the texture (although he loves the taste) so next time I'll try melting it in a double boiler first. Oh and don't worry if you don't have any fancy chocolate - I used plain old Baker's and Nestle cocoa powder and I still really love this.

This recipe was fantastic! It took a bit longer to set than other recipes (I had to put it in the freezer for about 10 hours to get it nice and firm) but the taste made it worth the wait! I also left out the chocolate chips and added Girl Scout thin mint cookies. Everyone loved it!

Although I shared some of the problems other reviewers had (small bits of cooked egg and unmelted chocolate), this is an amazing recipe! Not VERY chocolate as the name says, but incredibly rich and creamy.  I'll just learn from my mistakes (thanks to corrections from other reviewers!) and add more chocolate.  No reason to try other recipes...even with some problems this is the best!

Very good ice cream. I like that the egg get's cooked, and I love the chocolate. I didn't really like the grainness that came from the chocolate that was melted into it, but it was still good, perfect for any chocolate lover.

I've made this recipe several times and it always comes out great.  I've made it low carb by substituting the sugar with 1/4 cup Xylitol and 1/2 cup Splenda.  We like how the sugar alcohol (Xylitol) keeps the ice cream from freezing too hard.  I usually add chopped macadamia nuts and/or chocolate shavings.  To make a mocha flavor I bump up the sweetening to 1/2 cup Splenda Blend (no Xylitol but is equal to 1 cup of sugar) and 2 tsp Espresso Powder to the mix.  I use Droste Dutch cocoa and a good quality dark chocolate and it never fails to please!  You gotta try it!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but my machine ran for over an hour and the 'ice cream' would not get any harder than a VERY soft, soft serve. In fact it looks and tastes exactly like a Wendy's Frosty. Not that there's anything wrong with Wendy's frosty, but it's not at all what I expected.

I was impressed with this ice cream recipe.  My husband hates homemade ice cream, and he devoured this and wanted more.  The only variation I used was 3 T. of dark cocoa powder instead of 2.  If you're looking for ice cream for a crowd, though, you might want to double it, because it doesn't make a whole lot.  Other than that, this stuff is awesome!

This ice cream was very good, I added one more ounce of chocolate just because. This was a little more "melty" than other ice creams that I have tried and my husband complained that there wasn't enough of it, but the flavor was great so next time I will probably double the recipe. Thanks so much.

All I did differently was to add 2 tablespoons of coffee liqueur since I've had some trouble with super solid ice cream.  This was soooo creamy with a somewhat soft consistency (just how I like it).  I bet this would work just as well too if I replaced some of the whipping cream with skim milk.  I might add slightly less sugar too (maybe 1/3 less cup).

My, oh my, oh my!  This is so deliciously smooth and creamy - both the texture and the taste was superb.  When my hubby took his first spoon of this ice-cream, he went into ecstasy!  No one could tell this was home-made.

As some of the other reviews mentioned that the chocolate taste was not "chocolatey" enough, I put in 1/3 cup more of the cocoa powder (total 1/3 cup + 2 tbsp).

I did make a few other minor changes, though not sure if any of them made any difference.  I just had a similar custard style Japanese green tea ice-cream recipe that turned out fabulous and I replicated some of the preparation methods.  

Instead of putting the sugar into the milk/cocoa mixture to simmer, I whisked the egg yolks and sugar separately until light and fluffy, before stirring in the hot milk/cocoa mixture as per recipe.  I used cooking chocolate (only thing I had on hand), which I grated.  Oh, imagine if I had really good quality chocolate - could anything be even better than what I had??!  Must try it one day....

I also whisked the cream until it formed soft peaks before folding in the chocolate mixture.

I don't know how long it took to freeze, but it did freeze beautifully.  No graininess, no flakes, easy to scoop right out of the freezer, wonderfully chocolatey taste and such a delight on the palate :-)

This tastes just like Dairy Queen's chocolate soft serve.  I think the name "very chocolate" is deceiving.  While very good, it did not have a strong chocolate taste.  It makes a very small batch, so if you're look to fill a 1 quart ice cream freezer, double the recipe.

This ice cream is delicious! I agree with some other reviewers that it isn't very chocolaty, but I like that the chocolate flavor isn't overpowering. The best part about it is the texture, which is probably the best of any homemade ice cream I've personally tried. It's also the perfect base for adding your favorite topping, and it's quick & easy to make. This is now my favorite ice cream recipe.

OMG!  My kids and husband demand that I make this and stop buying store bought ice cream.  This is a truly delicious ice cream but it is rich!  That is good for those of us trying to lose weight because a small dish is quite satisfying.  Let the skinny little kids pig out on it!

I just got an ice cream maker 9cuisinar) and this was the 3rd recipe I've tried and, so far, the best.  Straining the chocolate mixture while still hot might cut down on the little chocolate flecks (which do not detract from the flavor btw).  I chilled the chocolate mixture over night and then strained it whicl also worked but required a little more effort since the mixture was rather thick.  The flavor of the end product was excellent.  I think it would be a great base for maybe a Rocky Road or some other mix ins.

Wondeful ice cream.  I used Hershey's Dark Chocolate Cocoa which gave it a deep chocolate flavor.  However, when I added the cold cream to the egg mixture, the melted chocolate shattered into tiny flecks.  It didn't affect the flavor of the ice cream, but made it a little grainy.

Delicious chocolate ice cream! I did have a burning desire to change it. Instead of adding vanilla, I added 3 tbsp of Amaretto. And when it was nearly finished churning, I added a small jar (8oz) of homemade cherry pie filling.
My company said it tasted like black Forrest cake.

This recipe makes the most delicious rich chocolatey flavor ice cream. I definitely  recommend! Took me 5 minutes to make then overnight in the freezer. I replaced the 2 cups of heavy cream with 3 cups of whipped cream from the can. It made it a little extra smooth

Perfection.  

Really easy to follow recipe and great balance of ingredients that contribute to a silky smooth, flavorful and classy chocate ice cream.   nothing was added, nothing was taken away.

To prevent flecks of chocolate, ensure chocolate chards are completely dissolved in the hot custard before refrigerating.

Made this as an end of summer treat for my daughters (8&6) They reported the chocolate mixture tasted like the best hot chocolate ever when they snuck a finger full as it was cooling. The recipe was easy to follow and came out wonderfully. The texture was satin smooth with lots of chocolate taste. They have decided it’s better than their favorite ice cream parlor in town!

This came out perfectly. You have to make sure you’re using good chocolate and good cocoa powder. And make sure you cut the chocolate up VERY fine or it won’t melt. I saw some reviews saying it didn’t freeze but I had no issues. My machine basically makes soft serve then I put it in a metal bread pan in the freezer for about 5 hours and it sets just fine.

I am very happy with the creamy results this recipe produced. Rich, creamy, easy. The only thing I changed is after tempering the chocolate custard, I strained it, it did remove any accidental cooked curd pieces. I also put my cold custard in the blender for a few seconds, it had a slightly lumpy look and I did not want to risk chunky monkey.. Then I added my cream just long enough to thoroughly mix. I will be anxious to see if it freezes well, as some have said it did not freeze well.

Delicious and great texture!  I swapped in half and half for the milk and added 25 chopped marschino cherries to the mix for chocolate cherry - yum!

I made this recipe and loved it. The main tweaks were as follows: 
1) I used 3 cups of lactose free half and half and eliminated the cream, which made the ice cream easier to digest.
2) I used Guittard bittersweet chocolate chips and Lake Champlain cocoa powder. This made the ice cream taste like Belgian Chocolate ice cream, which my family is crazy about. I highly recommend this recipe.
One note: We also have a Cuisinart ice cream maker, which needs to be put in the freezer for at least 24 hours before using. The ice cream mix MUST be cooled in the fridge for at least 2 hours! Once I pour the base into the machine, I let the machine run for about 10 minutes, so that it can freeze the ice cream more evenly. Don't be demoralized by the way it starts to freeze along the side walls- just keep going! This ice cream is well worth making.

I made this using only Cocoa for the chocolate. I used 50% more Cocoa than the recipe called for.  I didn't simmer it long enough so it set up way too thin (didn't freeze well). The recipe should let one know to simmer it until it is thick enough to coat the spoon. Make sure you strain the mixture before you freeze it to eliminate any lumps.

My 8 and 11 year old made this recipe (with adult help in minor details, like chopping the chocolate).  The 11 year old did all the math to double the recipe to make in our cuisinart 2 qt. ice cream maker.  The 8 year old measured mixed stirred, etc.  Both, and the rest of the family, give this recipe 2 thumbs up.  Our first homemade ice cream.  We mixed in the maker for 31 minutes, stored in 2 koji containers (the only ice cream storage containers we could find to buy locally) and right now are freezing in the freezer (although it did get frozen enough the kids wouldn't have minded to chow down right away.  We just wanted to follow the cuisinart instructions and user reccomend to freeze further afterwards).  Got waffle cones and sprinkles for the kids, tho not sure it really needs anything but a spoon!

With very little tweaking this was really good.  Added extra tablespoon of cocoa and 1 tablespoon sugar less.  Used all half & half instead of the called for milk and cream. By using half & half, I get a premium ice cream at a very good price. I also added brownie bits that I allowed to dry out exposed on a plate in refrigerator for 24 hrs.  Best Chocolate brownie ice-cream ever!

This ice cream is creamy and delicious.  I didn't change the ingredients other than adding a half tsp of chocolate extract.  Regarding the instructions, once I added the chocolate I did place the pot on low heat to melt the chocolate.  Then I ran the mixture through a sieve.  I also made a thick chocolate syrup to drizzle over the ice cream as I was adding it to the container.

Delicious. Good chocolatey flavor.  I made it a point to chill the custard over night.  I think it enhanced the smoothness of the ice cream.

This is the first time making homemade chocolate ice cream and by all accounts, very happy with the results. Very chocolatey, and very creamy. The only change is that instead of the semisweet chocolate that this recipe calls for, I used bittersweet instead, in an effort to cut the sweetness down a bit. Thanks for sharing the recipe, and I'll be making another batch by summer's end.

The most amazing frozen custard ever! Omg! The mouthfeel is so luxurious! I grated the chocolate bar to ensure quick even melting and strained the chocolate mixture to remove the little lumps of chalaza (the white stringy thing that suspends the yolk in the egg). It was late so I refrigerated it overnight. I added the vanilla and cream this morning and let it churn. I don’t know if I’ll even enjoy store bought ice cream ever again. I’m ruined!

I read the reviews before doing this recipe. This was my first time making ice cream, the instructions were very easy to follow, well written. When all said and done the ice cream came out very creamy and some of the best chocolate ice cream I’ve had. I definitely suggest this recipe!

I made this exactly as instructed and it is fabulous!  I can't believe how smooth and creamy it is!  The chocolate amounts are perfect.  I did cook it in a double boiler and then about 30 seconds of the top pan directly on the burner.  After chilling the chocolate mix in the refrigerator I put it (and the cream in a separate container) in the freezer for about 20 minutes.  I'm not sure why some people had a problem with it getting firm... maybe not enough time cooking the cocoa, mile and egg mixture to thicken?  I had no problems with scrambled egg-like pieces as I followed the instructions and whisked like crazy while adding a 1/2 cup of the chocolate mixture to the egg yolks.  Anyway, when w finish this (probably soon) I'll use it as a base and add cinnamon,  toffee bars, etc.

We loved this recipe. I've made homemade ice cream before, but never one that was so much like something I'd buy.

This came out great. I’ve I added more chocolate for flavor and used half and half instead of milk to make it thicker.

This is a very good chocolate ice cream.  It freezes just fine if you chill the custard all the way. I used a whole egg instead of the two yolks (it would probably be a little richer with the yolk, but it was rich enough for me), and I made sure the custard got up to 180-182 degrees after tempering the eggs. I also ran the custard through a strainer after adding the semi-sweet chocolate to strain out any little bits of egg and help the chocolate melt completely into the custard. I think this will become our standard chocolate ice cream recipe! It's delicious!

After trying several recipes to achieve my creaminess goal for homemade ice cream I found and used this recipe (minus the chocolate) as my base ice cream recipe. It is now my go to. Thank you to the contributor! My recipe search is over.

This is the best chocolate ice cream recipe I have found to date.  It creamy and chocolatey but not too much, just enough.  I recommend this recipe to everyone.  I will definitely make it again and again.

Outstanding!  I've made this recipe twice and it's been a huge hit!  Friends are surprised this is homemade.  It has a very creamy texture and rich in chocolate flavor.  This is my "go to" recipe now for chocolate ice cream.

Very good.  It's not super hard yet because it's only been in the freezer for an hour or two but I didn't have any issues that some other reviewers ran into.  I followed the suggestion of using a Lindt 85% bar and it melted beautifully.

My 7-year grandson LOVES chocolate!  I made this recipe and after it was at the soft freeze stage, I folded in chopped Godiva dark chocolate covered caramels, then placed it in freezer containers and put it in the freezer until it was more of the traditional hard freeze.  It was a HUGE hit!  Keeper of a recipe!

I made this twice. The first time I was careful to do exactly as the instructions stated and it turned out DIVINE! The best homemade ice cream I have ever had. Very rich and creamy. The only change I made was to add a shot of espresso.

The second time I was a little sloppy and didn't do it exactly as written. One difference is I added the cream to the chocolate mixture before it was chilled. I didn't think it would make a difference. I had the same problem others have written about in that it never froze in my machine, just thickened slightly. It still turned out ok after placing in the freezer for a few hours just not quite as creamy.

Wonderful, very rich chocolate ice cream! I made it and then threw it in the freezer and when I went to try it the next day it was fabulous! I’ve tried this plains the way it is written, I have broken up graham crackers put in mini marshmallows and chocolate pieces for a s’mores ice cream, and also I have drizzled in a hot fudge with Bailey’s Irish cream and it was awesome! If you make this and it isn’t right you were doing something wrong!

Wonderful!  Follow the directions, be patient ( it takes a while for it to thicken) and you will have a delicious dessert.  I did stain it to get any small lumps out and it was worth the extra step.

Temper the eggs properly!
This turned out so rich and flavorful. I put the mixture in my KitchenAid ice cream maker for 20 minutes and then froze the ice cream for about 5 hours. The consistency was very custard-like at that point. After 24 hours, the ice cream had hardened a little but more, but was still very rich. Would definitely try this recipe again!

Nice consistency, not too sweet and had no issues freezing it. I added slightly more cocoa to get a darker more intense chocolate flavour - was really delicious.

I froze peanut butter and added it as well. If you don't fully dissolve the choco chips you get nice dark streaks of chocolate in the ice cream.

If you don’t mix the egg mixture slowly enough (or don’t let the chocolate mix cool enough before mixing) you’ll get bits of cooked egg yolk— I poured it through a strainer when pouring into chilled bowl the second time I made this, and no teeny egg bits. Otherwise, if you follow recipe you shouldn’t have any problems!!

This turned out amazing. I did add some extra chocolate bar, all but one square of a 3.5 oz bar. And I did accidentally let the chocolate mixture almost boil for a few seconds before I realized it. But it still turned out rich and creamy.

I made it, and it is very good.  But, a problem that should be fixed on the All-Recipes website: I find no mention of the QUANTITY served.  By following the instructions, the recipe made about ONE QUART.

A prior reviewer panned the recipe because it would never freeze.  Not so with me, as to the recipe that made one quart; it froze firm and had great creamy flavor.

But, when I later trebled the recipe, I had great difficulty getting the contents to firm-up.  After experimenting, I discovered that I simply had not used the right type or quantity of salt.  Should use ROCK SALT, liberally.  Then, the recipe works just fine.

I used 4 med egg yolks. For the 1 cup whole milk I substituted 3/4 cup 1/2&1/2 and 1/2 cup 1% milk. I left this as vanilla so I omitted all the chocolate ingredients & used 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. Absolutely delicious!

I’ve made this twice now exactly as written and is it so good!  Even the kid who “isn’t crazy about chocolate ice cream” loves it. I do strain the chocolate mixture with a fine mesh strainer before chilling to catch any tiny lumps.

A terrific ice cream! Used 2% milk instead of whole milk (without thinking) and Hershey’s Special Dark Cocoa powder. Turned out great! Left in freezer overnight   No issue with hardening. A very slight “grainyness”, not sure if that was egg, fats, sugar, or what, but, barely noticeable. We hosted three boys last night and the recipe is a hit with all five boys.... a somewhat unusual breakfast, but not bad nutrition to start the day! (Next time, will try to remember to use whole milk, maybe that will remove the grainyness issue.

Excellent recipe. It worked perfectly and the texture & taste was brilliant. 
If you prefer you ice creams a little less sweet, you could possibly add in lesser sugar.
I added chopped almonds and fine chocolate chips at the start of he churning process.
Yummy, yummy, yummy!

I used the KitchenAid ice cream maker attachment for this (25 mins stir) and substituted half & half for the milk. Wonderful custard soft serve for dessert that evening and even better traditional cones throughout the rest of the week!

Custardy, perfectly rich chocolate ice cream! Had no problem with grittiness or freezing. Made a few changes:
- used 1/2 cup sugar and 4 tablespoons light corn syrup (improves creaminess per Serious Eats)
- used 1/2 c cocoa powder instead of mixing cocoa powder and chocolate
- added 1 tsp espresso powder

I didn't know how much two ounces of chocolate was as I was using chocolate chips so I used about 1/4c of chips. Tasted amazing - my family was crazy about it. I will definitely make this again!

To meet my dietary needs I substituted the milk and heavy cream with coconut milk. Sugar with xylitol sweetener. Both unsweetened cocoa and chocolate. The bitterness of the chocolate balanced out nicely with the sweetener. 
I tried the recipe same as above to accommodate my needs, removed the chocolate n put fresh nutmeg. Both were heaven in a bowl.  The texture was nice and smooth.

Following the hint from a previous reviewer, I used a 3.5-ounce bar of Lindt chocolate instead of the 2 ounces of semisweet. I used their Chili Dark Chocolate. The chili flavor doesn't come through as  chili -- it just enhances the chocolate flavor. Sensational ice cream!

My family loved it! I refrigerated the mixture overnight and put it in the ice cream maker the next day. It turned out smooth and creamy...texture was like frozen custard. My kids picked out a couple candy bars to crush up, and we added it to the mixture right before freezing. We will definitely be making this recipe again.

Wow! I don't even like chocolate ice cream and this was seriously the best flavor and texture I could imagine. The only thing I changed was I used half and half instead of milk. I also used 1 oz of pure dark chocolate in place of one of the ounces of semi sweet. Great recipe!

Fantastic chocolate ice cream recipe! I used this recipe as a guideline, but made a few changes. I like a very strong chocolate flavor, so instead of using semisweet chocolate, I used 3 ounces of 100% cacao dark chocolate and increased the sugar to 1 cup.  It was creamy, rich and froze just like it should. Perfect!

I liked this recipe, but giving it four stars because although I feel like it was rich and custardy, it was only light to medium chocolaty. A rich, light chocolate ice cream, but not very chocolaty, maybe the recipe title should be changed? In any case it is still a good recipe, just only needs to be adjusted slightly for the deeper chocolate experiece,  just add double the melted chocolate it calls for and it will make a rich milk chocolate and tastes fantastic!! Or for dark chocolate, use dutch process cocoa and dark chocolate chips - you will also need to add a few extra tablespoons of sugar because dark chocolate chips are more bitter than semi sweet chips.

This recipe did freeze and churn properly. The reviewers who say that it wont freeze are unfamiliar with custard base ice creams. #1 When you are making ice cream at home everything that you put in your ice cream maker must be cold or at least room temperature, or it wont turn into icecream. You must chill the hot cooked custard at least several hours before you put it in the ice cream maker or it will not work. #2 Most custard base ice creams like this are really not ice cream but frozen custard. Frozen custard is much softer than regular ice cream, and does not freeze as hard, but is really rich and yummy. This recipe  is not the same recipe as other recipes that call for condensed milk + cream to be dumped into the ice cream maker. It takes more preparation. This is a specialty frozen custard, that is very yummy if

This was wonderful! I added chopped toffee bars, too. Very smooth, no issues at all with mixing or freezing. When cooking the base, I sifted the cocoa and sugar to keep there from being difficult to manage lumps. I put the canister to our ice cream maker in the freezer a day or two before we'll use it (so that it's cold). For this recipe, I refrigerated the base for about 2 hours before adding the cream and vanilla. Will make it again for family this weekend!

EXCELLENT!!  The flavor and consistency were both spot on.  I even messed up a little-I realized after starting that I was out of cocoa powder.  I ended up using 1/2 C of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of 2 oz.  Also, I'd started this way too late at night and not really read the directions thoroughly enough ahead of time so I didn't realize I was going to have to wait 2 hours for the chocolate to chill before going to the ice cream maker.  Oops!  I wasn't going to stay up another 2 hours so I just left it in the fridge overnight and in the morning mixed in the cream and vanilla and went to the Kitchenaid ice cream attachment for 25 minutes.  Amazing chocolate soft serve right out of the ice cream maker and PERFECT ice cream after going in the freezer for awhile!

This ice cream is fantastic.  I did everything like the recipe except I added 3oz of bakers semi sweet chocolate grated.  I did use a candy thermometer and never exceeded 180 degrees.  and really took care tempering the eggs.  I have had issues with graininess in the past but did not with this recipe.  I did have to put it into the freezer to harden as I do with all my ice cream recipes w/my cuisinart IC maker.  Best IC I've ever made and I'm not even a big fan of chocolate.

A very easy recipe that belies the most deliciously creamy and smooth ice cream I have ever made.   I added two tablespoons of hot coffee if that helps its just my 'go-to' with chocolate.  So yummy.  It worked out perfectly for me, I will definitely make it again.

This is the best chocolate ice cream I have ever had.  Wonderful flavor and incredible, creamy texture.  Made it as written, but will try variations in types of chocolate or use of peanut butter chips in addition to cocoa powder. Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

This was delicious.  Far better than any storebought ice cream.  It worked perfectly in my ice cream maker.  It was chocolatey, and not too sweet.  I used half cream and half milk, and eggs from my chickens.  Good quality chocolate is a must.  
If you use raw cream, and raw milk, and fresh pasture raised eggs, and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup (and don't allow the mixture to get over 160F)- then you have not only something yummy, but something actually nutritious and nourishing.

This was my first try at making ice cream, after opening up the maker we bought about 2 years ago, lol. Had never made ice cream before, so followed the recipe to a "T". We could not believe how awesome this ice cream was. It was so smooth and creamy, uniform in texture and color. Nice chocolate flavor. Really loved this recipe. This will definitely become a staple in our household. Look forward to adding some almonds to it.

This was my first attempt at ice cream, and the tempering was scary after reading other reviews of scrambled eggs, but it came out amazing. This will be my go-to choc ice cream recipe. I didn't bring it quite to a simmer, because at Medium on my stove it seemed like it just wasn't going to happen.  And I did grate the chocolate with a fine grater rather than chop, since other reviewers had trouble with it fully melting. I also used heaping spoons of cocoa powder as someone recommended. The result was amazing, chocolatey, smooth ice cream! Thanks!

Awesome recipe! I used Dutch process cocoa and semi sweet chocolate chips. I also *slightly* increased the salt (I used a half tsp measure and filled it a little more than halfway), and, after the custard was made I put about 1/8 cup of whole coffee beans in the chilled bowl and poured the custard over the beans. After the mixture chilled I added the cream (with a little extra whole milk to make an even two cups) and vanilla per the recipe. I then strained the custard into a clean bowl before freezing. Really glad I did that because, in addition to the beans, there were some chunky bits of egg that I got out. Finally, I had some leftover brownie that I chopped up and added to the ice cream. Even though I made changes/additions, I used the base pretty much as written. I did not have any of the freezing problems others did. I will absolutely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe takes a longer time to freeze but it also makes it easier to scoop immediately out of the freezer.

Too sweet. Way too sweet.

This is the first time I've made ice cream with my ice cream maker and can I just say, it tastes even better than store bought. Absolutely amazing. The creaminess of the chocolate is mouthwatering. I only reduced the sugar by a few tablespoons and I used dark chocolate as the original recipe may be a little too sweet for my liking. But overall, fantastic!

This ice cream recipe produced an absolutely delicious product. I have to admit I made two alterations based on what I had in the house: I used two cups of milk to 1 cup of cream, and I used 4 oz. of semisweet chocolate chips. I will definitely make it again, but use a high quality bittersweet or semi sweet chocolate, chopped, because the chips did produce a slightly grainy texture (possibly because they contain lecithin? I don't know; I'm not a food scientist).  The level of creaminess was perfect with the 1 to 2 cream to milk ratio. In  fact it was VERY creamy and luxurious, so I don't really understand why it would be necessary to use twice the amount of cream.  Super awesome. Froze to a smooth, scoopable firmness.

I followed the directions to the "t", plus added chopped chocolate in the end and ended up to be the best double chocolate ice cream I EVER made.  Used Ghirardelli cocoa and Callebaut chopped chocolate. I agree with previous poster, what you use will significantly effect the quality of your end result. Best to buy the perishable ingredients same day.  This is one recipe I know will become a staple in our household.  Your bowl must also be extremely cold, ie left in the freezer the night before to ensure the custard freezes well.

I added extra chocolate chips and just under 1/4 less sugar.  During the process of freezing in my machine I added grated chocolate and finely chopped chocolate for crunch.  Excellent.  Make it every week!

I followed the recipe as written and had no issues with it freezing. it was a decent edible consistency after 20 minutes in the ice cream maker and even better after an overnight in the freezer. 
No issues with ice crystals or chunks of chocolate  (I used plain morsels for the first run).  Might be worth 5 stars if I had been more selective on chocolate choice.

First time making homemade ice cream. Followed the directions to the T but in the recipe I used special dark cocoa powder cuz that's what I had in the pantry. The consistency is super creamy with a well balanced chocolate taste. Not too rich, not too sweet.

This is my first time making ice cream with my kitchen-aid ice cream attachment. This stuff is really good if you like airy ice cream like Dryers slow churned. It was super light and fluffy and stayed that way after freezing (it did harden a little). 
I did substitute 1 cup evaporated milk and one cup heavy cream though.

I had to threaten my husband with frozen yogurt next time to keep him from eating it all!

This is a great recipe. I use it as a skeleton recipe for any flavor.  Simply, 3 egg yolks, 1 cup of half and half, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and whatever you want. That's how I use it. I also use only organic ingredients because if you're going to eat, you might as well eat the most nutritious food you can find. Grass fed, organic heavy cream. YUM!!! :-)

OMG!  The very best chocolate ice cream I've ever tasted!  I added frozen brownie bits , mixed in as I transferred it from the ice cream maker to the freezer container.  And I didn't have any baker's semisweet chocolate squares left after making the brownies, so I substituted cocoa, butter and sugar in the appropriate amounts.  I will definitely be making this again...and probably very soon.  This won't last long!

This was very good.  I did have flecks of chocolate but is that bad?  It was hard to get it in to containers without it melting somewhat so I'll see how turns out from the freezer.  I know my hubby will devour it if I leave it in one container so I put it in multiple small containers.  Oh, and I doubled the recipe since I have a large ice cream maker.

This is an excellent recipe, very easy to follow and the results are DELICIOUS; chocolatey, creamy, smooth(my only aside would be to strain the custard immediately after the cooking process).  It has rekindled my interest in my Kitchen Aid ice cream maker and I now use it as the base for most other ice creams I make, like cookies n cream, strawberry and vanilla. No more store bought for me! Thanks for this recipe!

Oh man, this was so good! Very smooth, very chocolatey, my husband said it was almost like a mousse. Will definitely make again.

We had run out of milk, so I subbed half and half instead. Otherwise followed the recipe.

For those people saying that it was grainy with chocolate flecks, the secret is stir, stir, stir that chocolate. Like, just put on a show or song and Zen out stirring for like 5 minutes. It will look done, it ain't, just go to your happy place and stir. BTW I didn't have any other chocolate in the house, so I used chocolate chips.

For those people who got ice crystals in their ice cream, there are two things that could have happened. Wait, three:

1. It wasn't cool enough. I know, don't throw a spatula at me, but like you and I are not the boss of the ice cream mix, it will completely cool when IT decides to. I make sure I put my mix at the bottom of the fridge to cool faster, then shove it in the freezer for 30 minutes as added insurance, if I have space and time.

2. Not enough butterfat. Sorry, this recipe doesn't convert to low fat AND stay roughly the same. If you used low fat milk or didn't use whipping cream, there's yer problem.

3. Maybe you overcooked the custard. If you cook the egg mixture too much, you get little bits of scrambled egg in your ice cream. Next time, once it starts to thicken, don't cook for more than a minute before taking it off the heat.

Why do I feel qualified to speak on this? Easy, I made a lot of crappy ice cream before I l

Made this recope exactly as described except I doubled it, and added two tablespoons of vodka while it was mixing so it wouldn't get overly hard in the freezer.  My husband said this was the best chocolate ice cream he'd ever had, and I agree.  I did use Dutch process cocoa.

The BEST chocolate ice cream!  I followed directions exactly and had no problems with freezing or consistency. I did have to churn for a little longer about 10 more minutes but otherwise this is our new favorite!

This is a FANTASTIC ice cream base for liquid nitrogen ice cream. The texture is nearly indescribable, but my closest try would be if you could make cream the thickness of ice cream with out it being frozen. It was that smooth. Great flavor.

Ohmygosh - it hasn't even set up yet and already I love it!  I had to stop taking spoonfuls or there wasn't going to be any left to put in the freezer!  I used mini semi-sweet choc chips and they didn't melt all the way, so what I have are delicious chocolate slivers in every bite.  Can't wait to see what it's like after it's been in the freezer a few hours!
UPDATE:  It's the next day and has frozen completely.  Delish!  It doesn't make much, so if you have and ice cream maker that's larger than 1 qt, go ahead and double it.  :)

This recipe was awesome!  The only change I made was I only used 2 egg yolks.  I didn't want it too rich.  Otherwise followed the recipe to a T!  It was SUPER yummy!  Not too chocolatey and not too sweet, just right!   I also made a second batch using this recipe as vanilla ice cream omitting all the chocolate and replacing with 1 tsp vanilla bean paste and it was just as awesome as the chocolate.   For procedures, I did take the advise of another member and after all cooking steps were completed, ran it through a strainer.  It did catch a few stray tiny bits of not sure what, egg maybe.  It's a really quick procedure and well worth it.  You don't want someone to get a wonderful bite of ice cream and have them feel a lump on their tongue, yuck!   Thank you Wendy for this great recipe!

Delicious, creamy, fresh and maybe one of the best chocolate ice creams I ever tasted.  Just follow the instructions and the results will be excellent.  Use an good quality cocoa and chocolate.  Next time I will double the recipe.

This was my first time making homemade chocolate ice cream, and I have to say I am surprisingly pleased with the results! My kids and I have made many other flavors, different types of vanilla, pistachio, strawberry, coffee...I guess we were just waiting for a convincing chocolate ice cream recipe. This recipe imho has a good balance of sweet and chocolate flavor. Its not too overly sweet with chocolate as an after thought, and its not too overwhelmingly bittersweet. I did not like other reviewers have an issue with it freezing. I used a blend of whole milk, cream and evaporated milk since the hubby and I have issues with full fat ice cream products. We made this into a quart and a half recipe and let it freeze overnight. This was so tasty I kept going back for more. And it has the stamp of approval from my 2 year old, so its going in the vault. Thank you! My icecreamophile children and I will make this over and over and over!!

This was super creamy and rich...even better than the local custard here in WI.  Followed this recipe exactly EXCEPT I did not have semisweet chocolate (other chan chocolate chips and felt they would ruin the recipe) so I used unsweetened chocolate and added an extra 2 T sugar.  I chopped the chocolate as finely as possible, and it melted perfectly with no chunks or bits.   I also  was sure to temper the eggs properly,  which resulted in a perfectly smooth, creamy chocolate base...no lumps of any kind and, thus, no straining needed.  I  allowed the mixture to cool completely before adding the heavy cream and vanilla, stirring it every 20 mins or so, cooling for 2 hours as directed..  Even then, I returned it back to the fridge to make sure it was as cold as possible prior to processing.    After 30 mins in my cheapo ice cream maker, it resulted in a velvety rich chocolate custard. It was very soft due to quality (or lack thereof) of ice cream maker, so I put it back in the freezer for a bit to harden.   Will definitely make again!

This is the first ice cream I've ever made. I made it in my Cuisinart  ICE 21. I used pure cream, high quality chocolate, and mixed in 1 1/2 cups brownie chunks. It was delicious and creamy. It froze smoothly, and took about half an hour in the ice cream maker, and another hour in the freezer. I would recommend adding  extra chocolate, as it wasn't quite as chocolatey as I like it. The brownie chunks also added a really nice touch; would definitely recommend. Make sure you whisk the cream into the custard until completely smooth (it takes a few minutes). Will make this recipe again, but with extra chocolate.

I followed the recipe exactly ( I usually do when I make a recipe the first time) .  My family really liked it.  It's smooth, creamy and very chocolaty.  Next time I'll double the recipe though, and  make a salted caramel sauce to swirl in at the very end.

This is my go to chocolate ice cream recipe. As long as you closely follow the directions it comes out beautifully. I use finely chopped dove chocolates and am always told  by anyone who has it that it's the best chocolate ice cream they've ever had.

This is hands down the best chocolate ice cream I have ever eaten! It is the only recipe I will use. I followed the exact recipe. I did separate out a portion and swirled in some marshmallow creme for an old childhood fave, but the chocolate ice cream recipe will remain the same for me!

This was the first attempt to make homemade ice cream for me. My six year old daughter helped me. I poured the hot mixture in too fast so had some chunks of cooked yolk. Make sure your pour it slow so you dont have problem I did. I used a hand crank machine for 39 minutes.  Its all I could do.lol it came out soft serve and was very delicious.  I made fudge chunks an added them to left over that  froze over night.was a great hit at my house

I've been selling ice cream for years and this recipe is spot on. Don't rush the process. Simmer, do not boil! Strain the hot liquid to remove any egg bits. Most people, I've found, prefer flecks of chocolate throughout. So I strain it and then add my chocolate chips, unchopped. Add vanilla when you add the cream. Make sure you get the mixture good and cold before putting in your machine. And if its too runny your freezer bucket is probably not cold enough. Put it in your freezer the day before. I throw a towel over mine to keep the cold in and its a big help. Remember its gonna come out like soft serve.

Second recipe for chocolate ice cream that I have tried, and now the last.  Hands down, better than any chocolate ice cream that I have had in a while.  I admit, I modified the recipe.  I used 1.5 cups milk and 1.5 cups heavy cream, and reduced the amount of vanilla extract (I use Pernigotti cocoa powder, which has a hint of vanilla in it already).
The first time I made it, I did have issues with the chocolate not all melting, which I fixed by straining the custard before refrigerating.  The second time, I put the chopped chocolate in a heat-proof bowl and poured about 1/2 cup of the hot custard mixture over it.  Stirred until the chocolate was all melted, then poured that back in with the remainder of the custard mixture.  Stir, strain, and refrigerate until ready to freeze.  No grains. No lumps.  Just creamy deliciousness.  Do yourself a favor and double the recipe.

I am not a huge ice cream fan but this ice cream is probably the best I have ever had.

This is only the second time I have made ice cream and I know I made some errors in execution.  I had a few chunks of chocolate that I failed to get melted but I pressed on, strained a few chunks out.

Boy was I glad that I didn't give up. I used big brand supermarket chocolate and the flavor was unbelievable. Can't wait to try this with high quality chocolate.

I made this in a Hamilton Beach little ice cream maker and it turned out very creamy and delicious. I did have to use a sieve after adding the hot mixture to the eggs, but it still turned out quite delicious and it made the perfect amount. My only problem was that it was a little soft. Other than that, very good!

Very tasty and very rich chocolate flavor. I used mini chocolate chips instead of chopping chocolate. Would love to add shaved chocolate at the end next time.

Very good chocolate ice cream!  It was a bit more work than I like to prepare for ice cream but the end result was really nice.  It sat up well in our cusinart ice cream maker.  It may of been my fault for using fat free half and half, or my ice cream container is just getting a bit faulty, but it could of been a bit thicker.  I actually preferred it the next day after it froze solid in the freezer.  It was nice and creamy and scooped out just like creamy ice cream from a tub.  I also loved to eat the "fudge sauce" by itself, that is made before adding the cream. I kept dipping my finger in it, it was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent chocolate ice cream. I did not have any issues getting it to freeze. I made it in my KitchenAid stand mixer ice cream maker. Wonderful texture and the chocolate and cocoa powder work very well to create a wonderful flavor. The only thing I would ask is that the original recipe state the yield. It would be nice to know ahead of time how much ice cream I'm making.

I followed the directions exactly as stated above and I thought it turned out delicious.  I think I ate half the bowl before putting it into the freezer...lol.  I did use really good cocoa and have a really nice Cuisinart ice cream maker.  Optional, I did add some finely chopped up Hershey bar at the end too.

This is the second time I have made this delicious, chocolatey goodness.  I've never had a problem with egg bits or anything of that nature.  It freezes nicely, even though it is thick - just the way I like it.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe so much, I've made it 3 times in 2 weeks. The only thing different I did was whip it for about 5 minutes in a stand mixer.  I love how light it gets...oh, I also added some caramel filled chocolate chips at the end...OMG!!!!

This is an excellent recipe. I used 70% dark chocolate. Follow the procedure exactly, and the result will be a creamy, chocolaty delicious ice cream. I strained my custard, and added the heavy cream to the mix before refrigerating, as I always do with any ice cream recipe (I don't see the point in waiting to add it). I had some very small chocolate bits but this was a positive as it enhanced the taste. Be sure to cool the custard sufficiently before freezing as it makes all the difference. My only comment would be to double the recipe as it made a small batch. I have saved this one to favourites!

Although this was rich and delicious, it did not freeze in the ice cream maker even after more than an hour of churning.... It also crystallized after I placed it in the freezer. Any suggestions on how to prevent crystallization?

I made this recipe pretty closely following the instructions except for one change: I added 1 extra ounce of chocolate. My feelings? Pretty awesome! It's rich, creamy, and smooth - especially considering it was my first ice cream! The only things I would change are maybe cutting back the sugar a bit and bumping up the chocolate even a bit more.

Excellent ice cream! Made it once so far and it was a success. I used Hershey Extra Dark cocoa which gave it a really rich taste and added extra small semi-sweet morsels at the end of the churning process.  This is a great chocolate base to add extras to the mix such as brownies or cookie pieces. I will definitely make again!

Turned out good and mine was more soft served. I used chocolate powder mix and adding an additional tablespoon of powder. Used a handful of chocolate chips. In the end, my family swirled caramel which turned out really nice. Great base. Gonna have fun mixing in things. Great plain too.

My new go-to recipe for chocolate ice cream. Texture and flavor were among the best I've ever had...homemade or parlor bought...simply fantastic! I did use more chocolate than listed...3 tbsp cocoa powder and added a little milk chocolate (2 Hershey's fun size bars) to the 2 oz semi-sweet. Since the recipe is for Very Chocolate, I wanted Very, Very, Super-Charged Chocolate. And the additions ensured that I got it! And to all who've said it does not freeze, I suspect that is likely an equipment malfunction. It certainly isn't the recipe's fault! If your ice cream maker is like mine, it churns it to a soft serve consistency. You need to put it in the freezer for at least an hour to harden it up. Thanks so much WendyWR for sharing!

Contrary to some claims, this WILL freeze solid.  I've made this (or variants using Black Sesame instead of Chocolate) and when my freezer is set to the very cold mark, it freezes just fine over night.  I use the Kitchen Aide mixer ice cream maker attachment, and put it in a jelly roll pan to freeze once made.  It gets to be soft serve consistency in my maker, when the attachment is kept in the freezer on a low temperature, and freezes hard in the freezer afterwards.  I've made it straight like the recipe, as well as using a mix of half and half and the heavy cream.  I have also substituted 1/2 Splenda instead of sugar, or used a Splenda/Agave Syrup/Sugar mix, and in every case, where the freezer is at the coldest or almost coldest setting, in preparing the ice cream bowl (maker) have had no issue with it getting hard.   With a "warm" freezer however, it would not get  hard.  I've also made it with double the vanilla, a 1/2 tbsp to 1 tbsp of Black Sesame oil, and two tbsp of black sesame ground in a hand held coffee grinder for Black Sesame ice cream (Black Sesame ice cream is popular in Japan, for example and is really good).   This is a good base for all sorts of ice creams, not just chocolate.   I plan on adding some Torani Blood Orange syrup to my next chocolate batch.

I took others suggestions and followed the recipe almost line by line. I had no milk so I used 1/2 and 1/2. This is one of the best chocolate ice creams I have ever tasted. I did grind the semi sweet chocolate chips in my food processor. It came out like delicious chocolate silk.

Excellent recipe.  Like any other recipe, the quality of the ingredients used will make a big difference.  I haven't had any problems getting it to freeze, but then again I always leave it in the freezer overnight.  Also, to keep little ice crystals from forming I put saran wrap on top of the ice cream when i first put it in the container for the freezer.  I have made this recipe 7 times. I do make some freestyle additions, including using vanilla paste instead of just extract, and changing up the chocolate types (i do like a good dark!), and adding an extra 1/8 cup of drinking chocolate for decadent richness.  I also like to substitute half and half for the milk.  Good recipe to play with.

This recipe is amazing.  It's kind of challenging and it took longer than hoped to freeze in my Cuisinart ice cream maker,  but the directions are good and the product is amazing.  I'm almost glad it's not easier to make because I  would probably make it too often!

WOW. Just wow! I am floored by the velvety texture and rich taste of this ice cream! These 5-star reviews weren't joking—this ice cream is really, really really really good. I'm a pretty picky eater, so I was expecting a good recipe... but nothing this wonderful. Miles better than anything I've bought from the store lately! Like another reviewer, I actually prefer this to Haagen Dazs too. I will say that my ice cream has some tiny flecks of chocolate in it, probably because I didn't crush the bar too finely. I love it this way, though. For ingredients, I used half a 4oz bar of Ghirardelli unsweetened, Hershey's natural unsweetened cocoa, McCormick's pure vanilla extract, Land Lakes heavy whip cream, Organic Valley's whole milk, and whatever salt/sugar came out of my cabinet. I was cautious with preparations after reading a lot of reviews here, and it pretty much turned out perfectly. When tempering the eggs, stir very quickly and mix very well before adding it back to the saucepan! For me, it was a bubbly and homogeneous honey-brown-colored mix. No yellow visible whatsoever! I was also careful not to boil anything, though this resulted in me turning the heat kind of low.. the mixture thickened only slightly before I took it off the heat (newbie ice cream maker here, not sure how thick it's supposed to get). But the results suggest I did fine, so huzzah! :-) My mom stuffed it in the freezer for half an hour and by then it was chilled enough (not frozen at all) to be put in our

This had a wonderful flavor and texture.  However, it did not freeze in my ice cream maker.  After letting it go for the alotted amount of time plus some, I finally took it out and put it in the freezer.  The next day it was frozen and tasted great!  I will make this again, but a day before I need to serve it.  And I will add mini Reese's Peanut Butter cups!

I also did not have any of the issues others had, however, I did use my own homemade chocolate that melts to perfection and is filled with flavor instead of store-bought chocolate. So my ice cream came out not only rich and creamy, but it was very delicious in flavor and it froze perfectly.  I followed the directions exactly as written (with how to handle the yolks, not boiling, chilling the mixture before churning, etc.)  This ice cream is unbelievably good!

I have been making ice cream for a while and I really love the texture of this ice cream. As for grainy texture there is none if mixed properly and not on a high temperature. I felt it was pretty easy to make  and super easy!!!

Excellent recipe! My family love it very much. The first time I left the mixture in the machine too long, so the ice cream was watery. The original recipe is too sweet, so I cut down 1/3 of sugar for the second time. The second time was success. The ice cream is smooth and rich.

Great ice cream. Very creamy added an extra oz of chocolate as my husband is a chocoholic. This was first time I made it. Followed instructions, slowly tempered the egg yolks, strained the custard before putting it in refrigerator. Put in ice cream maker and came out as a firm soft serve ice cream. Put it in freezer for a couple of hours to harden a bit more (husband likes it best that way). However, I loved the firm soft serve taste and texture. Yum very smooth, creamy, and chocolate tasting.

GREAT Recipe!!! I have used this several times and have NEVER had a complaint.*TIP*(for those having a hard time getting it to freeze: #1 don't skimp on the salt in the ice (remember its the salt melting the ice and thus creating it to quickly release its cold  energy and ability to achieve 17 degrees F. #2 "Age" the mixture overnight in fridge. # 3 freeze the canister before adding the mixture. I have also substituted heavy cream for half and half and had great results, as well. However, I must add, when I did so I also sprinkled in 1/8 tsp. of guar gum (can be bought @ any organic store) per batch. DONT OVER DO it tho, itll turn into marshmallow!! ;)

Amazing!! I actually put in a chopped up Hazelnut Milka Chocolate bar in place of the semi sweet chocolate, and it was SO good. Rave reviews. People didn't believe that it was handmade. Thanks for the great recipe!! Texture is perfect.

We loved, loved this recipe. My son made the ice cream, but he used Nitrogen. He mixed it in a metal bowl, it took maybe, 10 mins. It was the very creamiest ice cream I have ever had.

So incredibly rich I can't eat more than a tiny scoop. DH is raving about but I personally prefer something a little lighter.  I think I'll try half & half for cream next time.  Oh and I used the Ziploc bag method as an ice cream maker tub would just take up too much room in my freezer.

This is a great tasting recipe and super easy as well. I have made it twice and each time I have added more and more chocolate. The first time I added 100g(3.5oz) dark 70% cocoa chocolate (Lindt) and the second time I added 150g(5oz) of the same. I also saved a bit (1/3 cup) of the chocolate custard you have before adding the cream and swirled it through the ice cream before freezing it to set up. It is awesome and beautifully chocolaty. When finished in the ice cream machine it isn't super thick, more like a soft, softserve but bung it in the freezer straight from the machine and it firms up to a perfect ice cream. Thanks for the recipe!!

My first successful ice cream!  I followed the directions exactly as written.  A few times during the churning process in my Cuisinart, I ran a butter knife around to clean off the sides. The ice cream is awesome!  It takes somewhat like a Wendy's Frosty X AWESOME!  Make it and enjoy!

Made this on Father's Day for my husband. It is truly wonddrful. I followed the directions to the letter and it turned out perfectly on the first try!  I agree with the reviewer who advised not to rush the tempering and cooling process. This ice cream is defintely a keeper. Thanks for sharing it.

Superb! I've made this at least 5 times now, a favorite. I'd recommend melting only 1 oz of the chocolate and finely chopping the other ounce for some texture.

This is the best chocolate ice cream recipe I've found.  I love that the egg yolks do NOT remain raw, like in other recipes I've found.  I've read some of the reviews that say it will not freeze, while it doesn't become rock-hard after a day in the freezer, it does harden.  Unless you're taking it on a road trip in the sun, I can't imagine why anyone would need it completely solid.  The end result is a littler firmer than soft-serve, which is perfect for my family.

As chocoholics and ice cream lovers, we make a double recipe almost every weekend, since I found it, without changing a thing.  I follow the directions exactly, and I am continually amazed how good it is.  This ice cream would rival any specialty ice cream.  I fall in love with it each time I have a bowl (or two).  Thank you, WENDYWR, for sharing!

Great ice-cream!  We can't have sugar so I substituted 1/2cup splenda and used sugar free chocolate chips.  Even our friends how can have sugar seemed to enjoy my variation.  I made it in my kitchenaid ice-cream maker.  Loving it. Go for it!

Made this ice cream recipe the other day. It turned out pretty good.  The texture was thick and I had no problem with it freezing.  The chocolate tasted fantastic. I will be making this one again.

Love this recipe. The texture is rich, creamy and decedant it also adapts well to other flavors. I have made chocolate, spiced ginger peach, mint chip, strawberry and coffee flavor with this base recipe and I haven't had a hitch yet. Although I will say the two crucial steps are tempering the eggs and letting the milk mixture completely chill. Another step I add is straining the milk/egg before chilling.

Very wonderful chocolate ice cream! Thank you for the recipe. After reading the more helpful reviews we used 3 oz. of chocolate (nothing fancy, just baking chocolate I had on hand) and we added a step of straining the chocolate base after adding eggs and before adding the semi-sweet chocolate to the pan to melt and incorporate. There were some small lumps just from the egg white remnants that were clinging to the yolk when we added them for tempering. We were concerned we hadn't tempered properly, but straining did the trick. The result was fantastic and we will definitely be making this again. We have been making vanilla and variations for a long time but we are happy to now have a go-to recipe for chocolate.

Delicious! I had no issues with it - churning or ripening. It took about 45 minutes to set in my 4qt machine. After churning that long, it wasn't a particularly dense ice cream, but the texture was excellent, very creamy like a frozen mousse, and the taste was rich and substantial. It firmed up nicely during ripening. Next time, I may use half-and-half in place of the heavy cream, but the texture will probably suffer. I used melted bittersweet chips in place of the bar chocolate because I had half a bag I wanted to use up. I was afraid that the taste would suffer because I didn't use premium chocolate, but my fears were groundless. It was far better than anything I could have purchased.

Perfect chocolate ice cream! Tastes like Rocky Road without all the other ingredients. Perfect texture, even after freezing for a few days (I did put seran wrap over top before the ice cream lid which helps). Delicious!

This custard was velvety, buttery, and rich. The only thing I did differently was I took other reviewers' advice and was VERY careful about tempering the eggs.  I took the saucepan with the cocoa/sugar mixture and stuck it in a sink of ice for a few minutes before SLOWLY adding the eggs.  The only other step I did that wasn't listed was that I used a strainer as I poured my cooled mixture in the ice cream maker.  It firmed up beautifully!

This is a great recipe for chocolate ice cream. It is rich and tasty. Would have given it 4 stars but I agree it takes a bit to freeze. But it's so worth it.

It came out great. Nice and creamy. I did not melt the chocolate enough and it clumped up a bit, but it still tasted great. In fact it was nice to have a little chocolate swirl mixed in.

This chocolate ice cream is incredible.  It's rich and creamy and if you follow the recipe exactly it will be perfect.  I had no problems.  Used a cuisinart ice cream machine.  I've tried several chocolate ice cream recipes and this is a keeper.  I'm trying to find any other ice cream recipes WENDYWR has on this site.

This is awesome!  I had never made chocolate ice cream, only vanilla.  This was the first recipe I tried and will be my staple from now on.  The texture is so silky smooth, almost seems whipped.  My daughter said "I don't even like chocolate ice cream and this is delicious!"  This is true, child has never eaten chocolate ice cream in her life and is going through this like crazy. 
I followed the recipe exactly and had no issues.  It's a winner!

Amazing. I substituted full-fat coconut milk (Royal Blossom brand) for the milk and cream. It's a great way to have a non-milk ice cream and is JUST as creamy. It is so good! And I love that it's not too sweet. I'm going to make a 2nd batch tomorrow. This is THE chocolate ice cream for me!

The custard froze to the perfect consistency and remained decadently sweet.  As other reviewers have noted, you have to be precise when making the custard, and cannot rush it!  Also, if you deviate from the ingredients (lower fat content for instance) your custard will not have the same consistency after freezing.  This is true for any ice cream recipe!

Wonderful, I used 3.5oz of bittersweet chocolate and strained the mixture before freezing. No problems at all. Pretty much a standard ice cream recipe. It doesn't get any better than this. Use the best ingredients and properly combine, don't over cook, 172F.

Oh my gosh! I don't even like chocolate ice cream! (really)   This was SO good! I  made it for a guest.  I tweaked the recipe a little.  My cocoa on hand wasn't unsweetened and I used semi sweet chocolate chips that I had.  My guest said it was the best chocolate ice cream he's ever had.  Me too!  It's in my recipe box.

This is very easy ice cream to make.  It is more like frozen custard and it reminds our family of Ted Drew's Frozen Custard for its rich and cream texture.

The ice cream also freezes will in the deep freeze and it remain soft and easy to scoop.

Fabulous recipe ... I was eating it while it was freezing in the mixer. hahaha .... everyone does their own thing trying to make new and exciting ice cream. I put caramel in place of the cho chips and also walnuts. I used unsweetened almond milk instead of reg milk. I used the Hersheys powdered chocolate and it tasted yummy. I am glad to get this recipe because I have tried so many and never got what I wanted,  This is a simple recipe and so easy to make with my Cuisanart ice cream mixer. The almond milk may have made a difference in the taste and texture.

Fantastic ice cream and EXTREMELY fudgy.  YUM!!  I substituted Whey Low for Ice Cream (a sugar substitute which is good for diabetics) and couldn't tell a bit of difference in the taste.  I accidentally used the whole egg instead of the yolks, and aside from a few miniature lumps of cooked egg (which is probably more because I need some practice with pouring the hot mixture into the eggs and the eggs into the saucepan) it came out great.  I also opted to refrigerate overnight and did not stir.  The next day I put the mixture into the bowl of my stand mixture and mixed it on low, adding the cream and vanilla.  I doubled the recipe and put it in my 1 1/2 gallon ice cream maker.  It froze fine but didn't fill it up.  I will try tripling it next time.

Made this recipe exactly the way it is described.  It is very important to temper the eggs, and also to make sure your dasher hits the sides.  If you have a Cuisinart like I do, I noticed immediately that it had an 1/8" gap on the walls, but all I had to do was press the dasher up against the side and it turned out awesome.  The only thing I substituted was the cocoa powder, I used the special dark since I noticed that a lot of people said it wasn't too chocolaty. All in all, it was great, and more importantly my wife loves it.

I've tried a variety of different ice cream recipes over the years, but this is by far my favorite.  In fact, without the chocolate, the recipe is still viable with any flavoring, and I have made it with green tea (2 cups of green tea leaves and 1 tbl. of green tea tincture in 1/12 cups of milk left on a warm stove for quite some time to steep, substitute for the 1 cup milk in recipe, as it will cook down a little).  Some seem to have had problems with this freezing, but I never have.  I have used crushed ice, but prefer snow as a cooling agent.  I have sometimes added a little more milk, some half-and-half, with an extra yolk.

Amazing recipe texture wise once this recipe is tweaked a little I add extra cocoa powder I use condensed milk to replace the milk and use chocolate chips in place of the brick chocolate... It takes a long time to set but good things come to those who wait.... I let mine sit over night

This was a rich creamy chocolate ice cream,I read the other reviews, but I had no problems with grainy texture, I used a wire whisk and stirred almost the whole cooking and melting time. I tempered the eggs like the recipe states and used bakers german choc, and it still turned out awesome..

This was only my second time using my maker AND I couldn't find the directions so I had no idea how long it was supposed to run!  Mine turned out very soft but I could just need to freeze it longer too!  We were impatient but it was SO GOOD!!!!  Great flavor!  I just used chocolate chips in this and it worked perfect!  Thanks!  Update:  After sitting in the freezer longer it did turn into the consistency of ice cream!

This is so good!  After reading the other reviews, I just had to add a little more...my ice-cream froze very well.  It was all stuck to the paddle when I finished it up in the ice-cream freezer.  Maybe people aren't adding enough rock-salt to their ice to bring the temperature down???

This was tasty. A little too labor intensive for my liking. Especially when I get a better tasting chocolate ice cream by mixing 3 tbsp of cocoa in with a basic vanilla recipe, no eggs, no stove top.

This recipe was perfect.  I wanted homemade ice cream for my daughter's birthday party and we picked this recipe because the eggs were cooked.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I figured on two hours freezing time and was shocked when it was finished in a half hour.  We hadn't even eaten dinner yet.  So I stirred in mini chocolate chips, and put in a stainless bowl and put into the freezer until we had finished dinner.  Everyone loved it.  My father in law asked for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing it.

Excellent! That just doesn't begin to describe this wonderful custard-based ice cream. I would definitely suggest using a high-grade chocolate, such as Scharffen Berger, both for the cocoa and semisweet chocoate. I'm a very experienced ice cream maker and this freezes just fine if you don't try to rush the custard. Ideally, custard should cure overnight to develop the flavor and once it's completely chilled, it should freeze without a problem as long as you follow your ice cream maker's instructions. Too much rock salt, your ice cream will end up grainy; not enough rock salt and your ice cream will not freeze. Let it stand in the freezer before serving to let it harden. You cannot go wrong with this recipe.

Delicious!  I'm not sure what the one star reviewer was on about -- if you follow the directions, this works fine.  Just be aware: yes, you do need to FOLLOW the directions.  The pre-cooled bowl seems to help.  I used a thick Pyrex one, and that conducted the heat outwards very well.  Maybe that's part of the secret.  Also, be sure to whisk vigorously whenever combining ingredients (the egg and chocolate steps especially) or you will have lumps. C'est la vie.  Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This was VERY good. I used Dutch process cocoa and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Some of the chocolate pieces must not have melted fully because we ended up with a few solid pieces in the ice cream. We liked it though.

OK, I made this twice. The first was to try it as is. That was very good, but not enough chocolate for me. It was the creamiest ice cream I have ever had. Don't forget to run the liquid through a fine strainer to get any egg solids out before you give it a final chill before going into the machine. In all cases, leave it in the machine until the machine starts to beg to shut it down. YOU MUST HAVE A COLD FREEZER. This is the number one error for all the people who said that they could not get their ice cream to get past the liquid stage. My final, and best chocolate ice cream was made with 4 egg yolks, and 3.17 oz of Ghirardelli 86% Cacao Intense Dark Midnight Reverie chocolate. I also used two tablespoons of Hershey dark syrup, and a little extra cream. The ice cream is heaven.

I used only 1 oz. of semisweet chocolate and added an ounce of unsweetened chocolate (I used the Choco-bake product that's premelted).  I still thought the ice cream was too sweet.  Next time, I'll omit the semisweet chocolate and use 2 oz. of unsweetened.  The texture of the finished product was fantastic.  I used an electric ice cream maker, which never produces a particularly solid ice cream, but I love the "soft serve" texture.  Not sure how it makes 8 servings.  Four of us finished it off in no time!

This was the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had. I used a dark chocolate cocoa powder which might have something to do with it since I LOVE dark chocolate.

This is by far my most favorite recipe on this site. I have made this recipe many times, it always comes out great.  Everyone I have given it to loves it.  It is also an easy recipe to make variations  on. It makes a great base, I've made Vanilla, Brownie Batter ice cream, Hot Chocolate ice cream, coconut ice cream, strawberry, mint chocolate chip, and several others from this recipe. I can't praise it enough, this stands up better than any gormet ice cream or gelato.

I have mixed emotions about this recipe.  Could not even make my mind up whether to give it 3*, or 4* but decided in the end to be generous.  I followed the recipe exactly, did not change a thing.  But I could not get this to freeze at all in my ice cream maker, even after 60 mins.  The mixture was even thiner than when I took it out of the fridge, rather like the consistency of milk.  I decided to freeze it anyway over night.  It froze, but it's not like a creamy ice cream, does not seem to melt in your mouth at all, and has a sort of grainy texture to it which I don't like.  BUT The taste is so chocolaty and delicious.  I am sure I will use this recipe again but I will play around with it to try and make it more creamy.

This is a very good and easy to make ice cream recipe. The finished product tastes like store-bought ice cream, except that it has a richer chocolate taste. I was short about 1/2 cup of cream, so I used whole milk instead. Altogether, this is a very good, rich, chocolatey ice cream. Thanks for sharing!

The single best ice cream I have ever had. I made some modifications: I used 1c heavy whipping cream and 2 c heavy cream; 2T of Penzy's Dutch chocolate powder and 3oz of Scharffenberger extra rich milk chocolate (41% cacao). I also added chocolate Oreos as a mix-in. It is truly amazing. Great texture! Next time I will try adding walnuts and banana!!

Delicious. I made this for my daughter. I am not a chocolate guy but this ice cream came out perfect. I added some leftover chocolate chips i had from making cookies. Will definitely make again. I will probably double the recipe next time though. It is almost gone, lol.

This ice cream was very good, although my ice cream maker went capoots and I had to just stick the cream in my freezer making it a hard icy block.  The flavor was great though; I used half and half since it was all I had on hand and the taste reminded me of a chilled brownie, yum!

Excellent creamy, custard-style ice cream.  I doubled the recipe (it made about 3 quarts) and used about 1/3 to 1/2 of a bag of Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips in place of the chopped baking chocolate.  The end result tastes like Breyer's chocolate and would make a great base for Rocky Road ice cream!  I wasn't sure how thick the cooked custard mixture should be, but I cooked it until it was almost the thickness of pudding, being careful to keep stirring, and it turned out great.  I did have to chill it an hour longer than indicated (total of 3 hours).

Absolutely decadent! Rich and creamy. I used 3.5 oz. Green & Black's Organic Dark Chocolate with 70% Cocoa content (rather than 2 oz. semisweet). Very dark, and very delicious. This reminds me of a Bittersweet Chocolate Love Affair ice cream that we would have at our favorite ice cream shop in Vancouver, WA.

Wow! I tried this yesterday and I am home-made ice cream virgin! This truly is the nicest ice cream I have ever tasted! Even the hubby likes it. I made it exactly to the recipe and it freezes fine. I froze mine overnight after putting it through about 40-50 mins in the ice cream maker. It was divine. Is's now all gone. I am making a double recipe as I type this. Thumbs up to this recipe!

This is absolutely the best ice cream I have ever tasted.  The recipe was simple and the end result was delicious!!!!!  We made this on the 4th of July and my family and our neighbors had 3 servings each.  I will definitely make this again.

I'm having to beat my husband away from the ice cream.  We're having my son's 3rd birthday and I'm making homemade ice cream and it's taking me days.  This recipe is very chocolatey and creamy.  I'll update after the party when we can have more than just a tsp of a taste.  So, the ice cream was VERY chocolatety and rich!!  It's the kind of ice cream that you can't eat fast, savoring every bite.  I made a second batch with some modification: I mixed and cooked all the ingredients together,  let it chill for a full 24 hrs. and I added 1/4tsp of mint extract.  I'll be adding milk chocolate chips (chopped).  I'll let you know how that turned out.

This ice cream was absolutely incredible.  It was our first attempt at homemade ice cream, though my mom had made it for years.  We decided to try this recipe and were shocked at how good it was.  We expected it to be fun, and taste good, but it was amazing.  It ended up very soft in our ice cream freezer, so we put it in the fridge.  There was plenty of air in it, so that it did not freeze rock hard, but rather was very, very similar to the consistency of store-bought ice cream.  We added oreo chunks also, which made it incredible.  We will be making this again today!

This ice cream was delicious.  It took a bit longer to make because of the heating, but it was worth the wait.  It was a little too sweet for me though.

This is a dandy of a recipe. I had no trouble getting it to freeze well.  It was the first ice cream I have ever made and I did it in a 40 year old hand crank ice cream freezer in the tropical heat of San Pedro Sula, Honduras.  Very nice flavor. I used evaporated milk instead of cream.

I have just gotten into making homemade ice cream over the past few weeks. This turned out perfect for me. I have made it twice now with rave reviews. It is very creamy. I have to agree with another reviewer that maybe it is not "very" chocolate but I'm going to experiment with some darker varieties. But as this recipe is written, the flavor is quite good.

I haven't had great luck with homemade ice cream, but have continued to search for the 'perfect' recipe.  Found It!  I made some rookie errors - had to make this with with half and half instead of cream (grocery was out of cream on 4th of July weekend - go figure), should have let it mix longer, and didn't let it freeze long enough.  Despite these hurdles (in my defense I had dinner guests coming and a limited amount of time to prep), this is AWESOME.  Great mouthfeel, smooth texture, rich but not heavy.  Highly recommend it.

This ice cream was mega-chocolatey and very rich.  It tasted like the best chocolate cream pie I've ever had.  The consistency was very smooth and velvety, even after being frozen.  We made this for Father's Day, and now we're making another batch for ourselves.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love chocolate so this was great to try for my first time making ice cream. I doubled the recipe to fit in the maker. I also added more chocolate. This is very nice and smooth. I made this before I went to bed and the next day after dinner it was ready to eat!!! Yum Yum.

yummm!  this was a very easy recipe and so delicious.  it was worth waiting for the custard to get cold and for the ice cream maker to turn it to ice cream.  it is very rich, one little scoop was filling.  i wasn't sure about the cook until thickened part (after adding the egg yolks):  i cooked it what seemed like a long time and it only got a little thicker.  but it turned out great.  i substituted milk chocolate chips for the unsweetened chocolate and i put the custard in the freezer instead of the fridge by mistake; turned out fine.  i would definitely make this again.  we served it with sliced bananas.

This ice cream is to die for... I'd give it 20 stars if I could!!! 

I put in 4oz of semi sweet chocolate that I ran through my blender first and turned it into powder, (no flakes in my ice cream) and it is just right. I also added chocolate chip cookie dough... oooohhh... it's soo good. However, anyone who makes this will surely gain 5 pounds almost instantly, so be ready to diet afterward!!!! :)

This tastes awesome and is really easy to make.  

The only changes I made were because I don't like plain ice cream.  I switched the vanilla to almond extract and then when it was in the ice cream maker I put in some chopped up chocolate covered cherries.  As those were a big sticky mess to cut, next time I plan to use chocolate chips and chopped maraschino cherries. 

You just can't go wrong with this recipe though, it turned out perfectly.

If you're looking for a creamy style ice cream like you get in a premium ice cream shop (but with fresher flavor), then this is it. Not icey or grainy at all. One thing to be aware of is that it takes a very long time to freeze after you make it in the ice cream maker. It will be very smooth, soft serve consistency, like a very cold mousse until you freeze it -- almost like a very sweet, thick cool whip. I put mine in the freezer and when it was time to go to bed (8 hrs later), it still hadn't reached regular ice cream consistency. Of course by morning it had.

I love this!  I do have flecks of chocolate in mine, but I like it that way.  It adds kind of another dimension of chocolate flavor.  It melts in my mouth.  I added peanut butter to one batch (so good) and raspberry juice to another.  Both are very good.  I love this chocolate ice cream and I will make it again!

OK, but kinda grainy and not so "very chocolate".
