This was tasty. My husband loved it! I did not use stuffing mix because I wanted a lighter version. Instead, I sprinkled Italian bread crumbs over each layer. Yum!

You know what I love about AllRecipes.com?  With all the variations that others come up with to tweak a recipe, it really gives you ideas of how to make it your own.  And that's what I did with this one.  I liked the basic idea and just switched it up some, from others' reviews.  I used Italian seasoned Panko instead of the dressing mix.  I used parmesan & romano cheeses instead of Colby.  I used Italian seasoning instead of just thyme.  I did not precook the vegies.  Here's how it all went down:  "pammed" a 13 x 19 pan; layer of raw diced vegies, then layer of Panko, layer of cheeses; another layer of each, topped with a jar of pasta sauce.  Covered with foil, baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.  Removed foil, added more cheese, returned to oven for about 10 minutes, til cheese was melted and starting to brown.  This is one of the best dishes I have ever made!  Thanks to all, for your wonderful ideas!!

I am a vegetarian and LOVED this dish. I had guests for dinner--who aren't vegetarians =:O)--and even their college-aged kids loved it. I recommend peeling the eggplant--the peel tastes bitter to me.

Everbody really loved this recipe. Added yellow squash as well to add more color. Also used Italian style stove top stuffing mix and added Italian seasonings to the vegetables when cooking. Added Montery Jack and parmesan cheese to the cheese mixture. Diced the vegetables fairly large and didn't cook quite as long as suggested, didn't want them too soft. Was very flavorful and tasty. Have made a number of times already and has always been a winner.

Fairly quick to prepare--add about 15 minutes total prep time to the cooking times.  I used a wok to sautee the vegetables, as my biggest skillet wasn't big enough.  I also recommend using half the stuffing called for in this recipe (or less), as the taste of the stuffing can completely overwhelm this dish; if you use flavored stuffing mix, the vegetables just get lost.  I might try it again by thinly slicing and layering the ingredients and using very minimal stuffing.  I'd call this recipe only average.

This is definitely worth keeping.   My 25-year-old son who is a voracious eater says this is his all time favorite and I make it for him almost every time he visits.  This is also delicious cold and has a lot of protein in it.  I recommend it highly.

I have made this recipe several times and really like it. It is a great side dish or main dish for lunch. It does make quite a lot but is good as a leftover.

This was delicious!  I also tried it with zucchini and yellow summer squash when I didn't have any eggplant and it came out just as good.

Very simple, filling and delicious.  The cheese and stuffing made it kid-friendly, while the vegetables made it satisfying for my husband and I.  In just a few weeks, I've already served this repeatedly - it's wonderful!

Perfect summertime recipe using fresh eggplant and tomato! I didn't use the stuffing as I wanted a lighter tasting dish. Instead I layered panko bread crumbs between the layer of vegetables and cheese (vegetables, bread crumbs, cheese times two) I also added minced garlic to the vegetable mixture while it was simmering and cooked a little less than the recommended 15 minutes so there would be liquid for the bread crumbs to soak up. I took another reviewers advice and used freshly sliced mozarella cheese and parmesan instead of the colby jack. This smelled wonderful while cooking and tasted even better!! I can't wait to make it again when I get more fresh eggplant from the garden!!

Made this recipe for my 15 month old - he loved it.  I would definitely double the amount of vegetables, otherwise the stuffing just overtakes everything.  Would also start satueeing the zuchinni 5-10 minutes before adding in the tomatoes, onions and eggplant - the zuchinni just takes so much longer to get done and my eggplant and other veggies were mush by the time I added them to the casserole dish.  The flavor is good though.

I received lots of compliments on this dish!  I also left out the stuffing mix because I knew there would be stuffing for the turkey.  The textures of the eggplant and zucchini were wonderful.

My family loved this recipe.  Because of an overabundance of squash in our garden, I used a combination of zucchini and yellow squash.  In an effort to lower our fat intake, I didn't use the butter in the stuffing, but didn't miss it a bit!  This is a great way to get more veggies into my family's diet in a very tasty way.  I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good. We had eggplant, zucchini, onions, and tomatoes from our CSA that needed to be used, so this recipe seemed like the perfect fit. It was good, but I've found two other eggplant recipes on this site that I think are much better: Baingan Bharta (Eggplant Curry) and Eggplant Parmesan II.

I have never cooked with or even tried eggplant, so I was looking for a recipe that I hoped would make it great. This was it! Fabulous recipe! The only change I made was to add fresh mushrooms too, because I love mushrooms.

Great casserole!  I only give it 4 stars because I changed it a little.  I did not use stuffing mix (good advice from another reviewer) and instead used Italian bread crumbs.  I also used fresh basil, parmesan cheese and mozzarella instead of colby.  Great idea though!  The vegetables taste great together!

Incredible. Everyone loves it. I add more tomatoes and use whatever loaf of bread I have to make breadcrumbs with. Also, Colby Jack cheese. My one year old LOVES this, even reheated.

Very tasty!  We cooked everything longer and it was great. Didn't have any thyme so used seasoned salt.  Used a combo of colby and monterey jack.

I can't thank you enough! I live in the Mediterranean and am always looking for new ways to use the same old things. I was able to use some sad old eggplant and zucchini that had been in my fridge WAY too long. This was cheap, vegetarian, and easy to make and serve. A lot less work than the stuffed vegetables I had been planning to make. My kids ate it without complaining (miracle of miracles!!) and my husband pronounced it good. I used mozzarella and served it with a side of leftover rice.

This was ok. I made it as a side for Thanksgiving I was the only on who ate it. I love egg plant but I think th stuffing made it way to hearty of a dish and it masked a lot of th flavor from the veggies. Was very disapointed.

Yummy! Could easily have cut down on the butter in the stuffing. I used yellow squash as well, and instead of Colby I used Fontina and Havarti. I layered a 9x13 pan this way: stuffing, thin layer of the cheeses, veggies, layer of cheeses. Didn't need any salt. Mmmmm.

My husband and I loved this...the kids not so much. I thought for sure the stove top and cheese would be a hit with them but it wasn't enough to 'hide' the eggplant and zucchini. I will make this again..thanks!

I really liked this recipe.  I made it just as written despite reading the other reviews about cutting back on the amount of stuffing.  I made mine in a 9x13 pan and the stuffing was really rather sparse when spread over the whole pan for two layers.  I'll definitely make this one again.

This was easy and reasonably healthy (more healthy if you use low fat cheese). I substituted Italian bread crumbs for the stuffing mix.

If you like stuffing, you'll like this.  If you don't, though, you'll hate it.  I altered the recipe to substitute bread crumbs for the stuffing mix, but the thyme with the vegetables just has an inescapable stuffing-esque taste.  To me, it was gross.  Lesson learned!

WOW this was a success ! I made this for my whole family and everyone LOVED it - including my parents  My Husband & kids ate it and went back for seconds - No one could believe that it had eggplant & zucchini in it  I've been trying to make more dishes with Eggplant that everyone will eat and NOT just myself alone - which is usually the case but this was really a show stopper - everyone was eating MORE of this than the meat that was served that day - In fact I cant even remember what meat we served - LOL it was THAT good  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe - it came out perfect - will make this again for sure !

I use this as a base with other leftovers... use thanksgiving dressing, grilled vegies, etc depending on time of year and what I've got.  I typically add either chicken or turkey also!

I made this casserole last night for dinner and it was a huge hit.  I didn't cook it the full amount b/c my family doesn't like their veggies soft.  Also, I used the cornbread flavored stove top stuffing mix and added a dash of cayenne pepper, and it worked perfectly.  I topped it the last 10 minutes of baking with parmesan and shredded cheddar cheese since I didn't have any colby, and it worked just fine.  This recipe was a winner in my house!

I reduced the amount of stuffing and cheese by half, and I used part cheddar and part pepper jack.  Other than that I made it as directed.  I took it to a church potluck and got several requests for the recipe.  We liked it a lot.  The vegie mixture is essentially like a ratatouille and good all by itself, too!

This was excellent with a few changes that I made: I added 3/4 cup boiling water to the stuffing mix and decreased the butter to 2 tbsp. Baked the veggies and added garlic and green pepper. Didn't have Colby so I used some shredded Swiss and Provolone. I did add a little extra thyme also.
What a great way to use up the summer vegetables. Thanks for sharing!

I love this dish. It is easy to prepare. I make it at least once a week. My picky kids even like it. I even tried it with boneless chicken breast cut into chunks and it was even better. Thank you for this recipe.

Didn't have much luck with this. I think I know my mistakes, though. 
I used canola oil to cook the veggies in. Next time will use butter to bring out the thyme and natural veggie flavors. 
Also I used herb stuffing. It confused the veggie seasoning. Next time will use plain bread stuffing.
I also like another reviewer's suggestion of  using monterey witht the colby cheese.

We liked this recipe very much and I will put it into my rotation, but I agree with the reviewer who said that there was too much of the stuffing.  Next time, I'll make 1/2 as much and use it only on the bottom - maybe baked by itself for a few minutes first to create a bit of a crust.

This dish lacks flavor...I sprinkled seasoned salt on the top and it transformed the dish.  The amount of veggies is A LOT, so be prepared to use a wok.  I didn't have much luck with med-low heat...so I used medium.  I sauted my zuchinni with the onions first for 5 mins.  I should have done it longer because they were still undercooked in the dish.  I used 6 oz of stuffing mix (plain is PERFECT) and cooked according to the package.  I layered half veggies, sprinkled with cheese, layered the other half veggies, sprinkled with cheese and topped with stuffing.   Cooked for 35 mins and it was nice and golden brown.  Does not reheat well.

I used what I had on hand. 10oz seasoned croutons instead of stuffing. Sauteed eggplant,zucchini,yellow squash, a little spinach, small can of crushed tomato with fresh oregano,thyme,sage and basil. Just mixed with most of the croutons, layered with cheese and topped with the remaining handful of coutons and a bit more cheese. Didn't prep coutons in any way. Mixed them in dry. Baked 30 min....yummy

This was a tasty recipe, however for some reason the stuffing was too soggy and made the overall dish kind of mushy.  I will make this again, but maybe try stove top stuffing.

This was pretty good. I definitely would say that you need to use the herbed stuffing instead of the plain because almost all of the flavor came from the stuffing. I love stuffing, so it was fine. I thought it reheated fine the next day. I didn't precook the stuffing but let it cook in the casserole with the juices and it was good.

I read the reviews before making this, I was worried about the stuffing getting mushy, so I took a cup of the  stuffing mix and mixed with the melted butter and a little bit of water and used it to top the casserole for a nice topping. It came out nice and crunchy, It was fantastic, the stuffing did not overpower the casserole either. I will be making this again.

This was a real nice change from the usale side dish. I used stove top made with 1 1/2 cups of water, and left out the butter. Also add 1 clove minced garlic.

After reading the reviews about the stuffing being mushy I decided I would try this just mixing the stuffing with 1/4 cup of melted butter.  I am glad I put most of the stuffing mixture on top because the part I layered with the vegetables was quite soft but the stuffing on top had a wonderful crunch.

Hmmmm...what to say about this?  First off, to make it a little healthier, I skipped the stuffing and only used 1 cup of cheese. But I used Sargentos Bistro Blends Mozzarella w/ Sundried tomatoes & basil for some added flavour.  I added 1/2 a chopped green pepper, a few minced cloves of garlic and a can of diced tomatoes. I doubled the thyme and added the same amount of rosemary.  I liked the fact that the veggies simmer in their own juices instead of sauteing them. I think that adding some pasta will make it a sort of veggie baked ziti. It was a good way of getting veggies in.  And very versatile.  But it did require a lot of tweaking in my opinion.

Very good.  Not having any Colby cheese, I added a mix of cheddar and parmesean.  I also doubled the thyme in the recipe.  It turned out great!  The only recommendation I have is that a 2 quart casserole dish is a little small for the recipe.  Something slightly larger would work better.

Mmmm...I'm a fan of stuffing, but you can't use it in too many dishes--this was good. The veggies went real well with the stuffing, and the whole thing made for nice comfort food.

I liked this recipe so much I've already made it 3 times!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but since then I've used chicken flavored stuffing (and made it according to the package directions) and replaced the eggplant with sliced mushrooms.  My boyfriend and I really enjoy this recipe! :)

Very nice way to cook eggplant and zucchini.  I would add more tomato and maybe some parmesan cheese.  I made this for Christmas Eve and family members who liked eggplant really liked this.

A definite miss. Prepared stuffing turned into a mushy, gooey,paste-like mess under the sauteed vegetables. Too much butter and cheese, and I resisted the urge to alter ingredients so I could say I made just as recipe states. No texture, little flavor, an overall fail. Wish I could say there was something redeeming, but I am at a loss as to what happened to make this worthy of a one-star review.

This is a great recipe. It is especially wonderful in the summer when you can take advantage of the abundance of local garden vegetables which are available.  The only problem I had was that, the commercial stuffing mixes all seemed to contain chicken fat and other undesirable ingredients. We did end up finding one that was vegetarian the second time we made this. Next time I will check Whole Foods, or the organic section of Kroger. They might have healthier options.

This casserole is awesome! I changed from colby jack to cheddar but otherwise it was great! it also helps use up all the truck load of zucchini we get from the garden.

Delicious!  I took other reviewers' advice and cut the stuffing mix (as well as the water and butter) by half.  Even my two year old seems to be enjoying it!

My changes were 1/2 a spaghetti squash instead of zucchini, and swiss instead of Colby.  It was fantastic, we both went back for seconds, and will make this often!

Very good!  My meat and potatoes adult son even enjoyed it.  I just put stuffing in bottom of dish, added vegetables and sprinkled 2 cups of italian blend cheese over the top.  I did also mix in 1/2 C of tomato sauce just to get it out of the fridge.  I also cooked the whole dish in the microwave.  Did stuffing according to package directions, cooked vegetables 10 minutes covered on high stirring twice during the cooking time then finished the assembled dish for a minute on high just to melt cheese.

I found that I had to add a significant amount of seasoning to the dish: rosemary, thyme, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano.  I also added a bit of Parmesan cheese.  I used about half of the stuffing to make it healthier, and low-fat/2% cheese.  It wasn't bad, but it seemed like something was missing?

Followed the recipe exactly. It was a little too mushy and bland for us. But, I think it has potential. Will try again making some adjustments.

Wonderful flavor.  I was a little concerned when my husband said he wanted to become a vegetarian, but with recipes like this it's easy!  Next time I will omit the eggplant and add some other types of summer squash.

This recipe is awesome! Everyone ate this even my dad who is picky and claims to hate eggplant and zucchini. The first time I made this recipe I used Italian flavored bread crumbs, and the second time I did use chicken flavored stuffing. Both came out great! This dish is a very tasty way to disguise veges. The second time I made it I covered up the dish with tin foil because the first time the cheese was very rubbery and a hard layer. Turned out much better the second time around. Also added green peppers, chili-garlic-ginger paste for extra taste. I love this dish it is so customizable! I will definitly be keeping this one in my recipe book! :) Thanks

I absolutely loved this recipe! I didn't use stuffing mix, but just used Italian breadcrumbs instead. I used a Zucchini and a yellow squash for color. Used Mozarella and Parmesan cheese instead of Colby and added a couple of garlic cloves. This will definitely be a repeat! Great as a sidedish, but certainly could hold its own as a maincourse with a side salad. Thank you!!

Really good! I changed things up a little. I perpared the stuffing on the stove top, roasted the veggies at 425 degrees for about 35 minutes. I layered the veggies as suggested and dotted a little butter on top before baking.

Delicious! Followed suggestions of other posters and made a few adjustments (besides reducing serving size to 4) - added mushrooms, mini bell peppers (needed to be used up), & 2.5 cloves of minced garlic.  Also used 1 tspn each of dried thyme/basil, 1/4 tspn of dried sage, a colby/monterey cheese mix and panko bread crumbs (instead of stuffing). Didn't have zucchini but did have Italian squash.

The casserole came out PERFECTLY after 30 minutes in the toaster oven, complete with melted, browned cheese on top! YUM! Will definitely make again.  Great way to use up seasonal veggies too.

I made it to specifications  -- if you use "Stove Top" you need to disregard this recipe's instructions and follow those on the Stove Top package.  The pkg size has changed.    This is good comfort food.

This is a wonderful recipe and has a lot of "play" room. I did not have eggplant, so I substituted mushrooms. I did not have colby cheese so I used montery jack mixed with some leftover italian cheeses that I had. I seasoned heavier as recommended by other cooks and it was just fantabulous! I will make it again for sure.

Surprisingly good! I tasted it before baking and thought, "Uh oh," but it came out really well.  Changes:  I find eggplant always needs extra seasoning, so I upped the thyme, salt, and pepper, and threw in some sage, too.  Also added 1/4 lb. of very thinly sliced pepperoni I happened to have on hand; enough to add flavor without overpowering the vegetables.

This was tasty.  Even my husband who normally won't eat either ate this casserole.  They were disguised by the chicken flavored stove top stuffing that I used.  I only used the amount of water on the box because it was a smaller size than what it called for in the recipe.

This was easy and tasty.  I liked the combination of flavors and textures.  I picked a flavored stuffing that I knew I liked and so I didn't have an issue with the flavor of the stuffing.  I would make it again!

This is a keeper.  I used yellow squash instead of zuchini because that is what I had on hand.  It came out wonderful.  I don't even like eggplant but when I was given 8 eggplants to use for dinner at church I of course came to this site to find a good recipe.  Everyone loved it and wanted more but they had eaten every bit of it.  I only got to taste it.  Next time will make 2 huge pans of it!  Thanks!

I made this with a few tips from other reviewers. I sautÃ©ed the vegetables before layering and used panko instead of stuffing. Hereâ€™s how I did it: one layer eggplant, cheese, panko, sweet potato, cheese, panko then a layer of zucchini, summer squash, onion, mushroom followed by cheese and panko. I topped it with a sundried tomato pesto sauce.

DELICIOUS. Sliced the eggplant and zuch instead of dicing for texture reasons and I prefer that, but it did make cooking longer.

Used Italian bread crumbs, mozzarella and parmesan.  Have a lot of zucchini, so most likely I'll make a variation.

I made this as written, the only change I made was, I didn't have Colby cheese, so had to use what I had on hand, which was Monterey Jack. .. But it still turned out DELICIOUS!!!.. So HAPPY, to find this recipe, I needed to use up some garden vegetables!

I used gluten free corn flake breadcrumbs (a few cups) ibstead of the stuffing and goat cheese instead of the colby cheese bc that's what I had in the house.  I also added fresh thyme, oregano, parsley, and rosemary--I chopped about 1/2 cup total.  AND IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!  So easy and tasty, I would definitely male it again.

I made this with bread crumbs and Italian seasoning. Next time I would toast the bread crumbs first . I would use more cheese next time maybe a Colby jack. I used cheddar but it was awesome!

This was an EXCELLENT recipe!  I had complete strangers come up to me at a school potluck asking for the recipe once they found out who made it.  I loved the layering and I put it in a crockpot on high for 4 hours at an inservice.

It was good, but like Tara said, the stuffing can overwhelm veggies if its seasoned... Wish I would have read that first! I would sweat the eggplant or peel skin first to keep bitterness away as well. Good, not great.

Since my daughter is on gluten free, dairy free (except eggs), we used all veggies and no bread crumbs. Along with the eggplant, zuchinni, we added chopped kale, green/red peppers, broccoli, fresh parsley, season salt, pepper, and some chopped up ham cubes.. then added salsa on our plate. Amazing! My sons even liked it (who thought it looked way too healthy!).. it's a new favorite

I think this has the potential to be great!  However, I used Kellog's Corn Flake crumbs in place of the stuffing mix and it left it totally dry and tasteless.  Stick with the recipe or at least use the italian seasoned panko and add some butter or something.

Superb! I used a mix of parmesan and mozzarella cheese in lieu of colby. The nice thing about this dish is the ability to substitute all kinds of vegetables! Thanks!

Because I made a few adjustments/additions as per other reviewers(2tbsp of butter instead of 4/4oz bread crumbs instead of 8/1 garlic clove/1.5c sliced mushrooms/1tsp basil) I'm only giving this dish a 3-star. Even though I put most of the stuffing on top it still came out too 'mushy' in the end. I won't give up on this one and will definitely try it again until it gets at least a 4-star rating in this household. Thanks Linda. Cheers :o)

This was good - I added some diced ham since my husband doesn't like main dishes with no meat!  I also used a can of diced tomatos to add a little more moisture.  We all like this very much and all of the leftovers were eaten for lunch throughout the week.

I loved the veggies, hated the dressing mix. Maybe I got it wrong, it was confusing as to how to do the dressing. Maybe I wasn't suppose to add prepare the dressing? Next time I will make this but omit the dressing.

This was very good, but was missing "something"...  Not sure what, maybe adding green beans or something like basil or another spice.  I'll make this again and do some tweaking (once I can figure out what I'd add!).

I was looking for a recipe to use some of my garden produce in -- zucchini, eggplants, tomatoes. My husband is not fond of onions(and I am) so instead of the 8 oz. of stuffing, I used a box mix with added onion and I also added baby portabella mushrooms(about 3/4 cup).
My husband didn't even mind that there was no meat!
I also used reduced fat cheddar instead of regular.

It's okay, but for me it came out a lot like stuffing mixed with veggies with some cheese on top.  I did follow the recipe somewhat loosely and it was acceptably tasty but I'd try something a little moister/more cohesive next time.

This casserole was fantastic.  My family loved it and before the first one was even gone, they asked me to make another!  I agree with other reviewers about the bread stuffing mix though.  I didn't even use half, and next time I make this I will probably use even less.  I also needed to use my wok for the vegetables (there's a LOT of them), and I added some fresh basil for a little extra flavor.  Thank you for the recipe!

Wish I had done 1/2 amount of stuffing as I found it took over the flavour of the veggies. Also used cheddar and added mushrooms. It was good first time round, but I didn't enjoy it as leftovers as it went too mushy. My husband liked it more than me but then again he loves stuffing.

I couldn't find any zucchini at my grocery store, so I used a yellow and green squash instead. Definitely time consuming with all the chopping required, if you are doing it all by hand. I used a Coly & Montery cheese mix. Everyone loved it!

I found this recipe to be very bland.  I tried adding more spices, cajun seasoning, and sea salt but in the end it was just a big pile of veggie/bread mush.  We ate it and the leftovers but I will not make again.

Pretty good flavor. Great textures with the veggies. My only complaint is that I felt like I cut veggies forever! Plus it is hard to tell what is a large eggplant like the recipe calls for! ( I ended up only using 1/2 of mine.)Overall though we really liked it, even my husband who said, "eeew, eggplant!" To which I replied, " Have you tried it? " "No, but it looks weird!" Well, he gobbled it up too!

This was delicious!  I used Stoffers Stuffing 8oz Box
Italian Style and I used Montery Jack cheese instead of  Colby. My husband couldn't stop eating it and he hates
stuffing! He told  me it was definately a do over!
Thanks for all your reviews it really helped me in deciding
to make this recipe!

What a great way to use up those garden veggies. Definitely a recipe worthy of pulling out the food processor as it is a lot of chopping veggies, but well worth the effort! Made it over 6 months ago and my boyfriend still requests it regularly! Thanks!

This was a great dish.  Easy to make and lots of flavor. I made mine without tomatoes (didn't have them on hand) and it was still terrific!

This was way too much work for the end result. It took me two skillets to cook up the veggies and it needed a lot more cheese. I was not impressed with this and wont make it again.
