This is a very flavorful, serviceable weeknight soup. For those who think it a bit odd, a similar, sweet potato-tomato soup is very popular in parts of the Carribean. Relying on that experience, I made a few changes in the ingredients and method of preparation. Agreeing with prior reviews, I reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. because it's naturally assertive, eliminated the oregano, basil and rosemary, since it didn't fit the flavor profile and used canned stewed tomatoes. The powdered onion went, too, since there was plenty of fresh. I used minced, seeded, habanero chile in place of the cayenne and crushed red pepper, because  it's flavor works well with the other ingredients. I sauteed the spices with the onion, celery and minced garlic,which I doubled. To reduce the sweetness and highlight the sweet potato's natural flavor a bit more, I made sure not to buy "candied" sweet potato. I used bottled roasted pepper, since I had some left over from another dish. I also eliminated the water and used two cups of low sodium broth. Everything was partially hand blended at the end, before adding leftover, shredded roast chicken in the last five minutes of cooking, for a protein boost. Tasty in front of the TV!

My husband has declared this "the best stew". I used fresh black eyed peas and a fresh sweet potato. Since I used fresh veggies I had to increase the veg broth to 3 cups and I was also more generous with the sugar and spices. I also increased the cooking time to about 40 minutes. This was very hearty and easy to make.

This was awesome! I did make a few changes:Instead of roasting red pepper, I cut red, yellow and green peppers into chunks and sauteed then with the onions I substituted 1 can of stewed tomatoes for the plum tomatoes. I added 1 large minced thai chili pepper instead of cayenne. I added a little bit more cumin than a pinch (probably 1/4- 1/2 tsp). I simmered it for an hour to really bring out the flavors. I blended it with a hand blender for about 5 seconds just to make the broth a little thicker. I also sprinkled it with asiago before serving. Definitely a good recipe! This would probably make a yummy crock pot soup!

Wow, so so so good!  I followed "Big Rev"s suggestions of reducing the cinnamon, leaving out some spices, sautéing the spices with the onions, adding chicken, and skipping the water and using all broth.  I still think there should be more broth, so I'd probably go with 3 cups next time.  I did not add the bell pepper (I am allergic), and I did not have Cumin or coriander so I substituted with a pinch of curry powder which has both in it.  I also used a fresh sweet potato instead of canned (just simmer it 45 minutes instead of 20).  I found in my store's produce section "reconstituted" black eyed peas (brand name Melissa’s) which basically just saved me having to soak the dried peas overnight (I don’t like the canned version).  All in all, this was a tasty dish and I plan to make it again for a dinner party in a few weeks.

Beautiful!  Thank you Big Rey, for your review, as I took your lead and I'm so glad I did.  I used vegetable broth instead of water; didn't have any stewed tomatoes on hand, so used diced, and used roasted red peppers.  I can't imagine how it would taste if I used any more than 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  That was enough.  Once it was done, I pureed half of the soup ~ it looks, smells, and tastes absolutely wonderful!

This sounded strange, but was absolutely great.  I was very pleased with the soup, which was easy to prepare, and my family liked it.  Made for really delicious lunch the next day after the flavors married overnight.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! Even my husband, who HATES sweet potatoes, liked it!

I did make a few changes, but nothing major. I just omitted some of the spices and, per my dad's suggestion, had some Hot Madras curry powder on the table so diners could season their stew to taste - the curry powder really did add just the right flavor.

The spices I kept were the bay leaves, garlic (fresh), thyme, rosemary (fresh), brown sugar, cumin, salt, red pepper, cayenne pepper, and parsley as garnish. I think next time I may substitute cilantro for parsley.

I also just sauteed the red pepper rather than baking it to draw out the sweetness, because I just don't have the patience for that.

This soup is savory, sweet, and not overly complex with some spices omitted.

Thanks to AMANDA1432 for submitting this recipe! It's brilliant!

This was great. To enjoy this recipe, you need to like flavor-intense tastes. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the cinnamon to about 1/4 teaspoon and it was plenty. I also found more water was needed, so  added about an extra cup. Thanks for the delightful recipe!I will certainly make it again

I completely agree with the other reviewers - what on earth was up with that huge list of spices? I focused only on the sweet and spicy, stopping after the red pepper flakes, but I did throw in about a teaspoon of freshly ground cumin.  Being a cinnamon fanatic, the amount didn't bother me, but I do see how others would have found it overpowering.  Nonetheless, the soup was really quite good - I pureed it a bit and served it with some Greek-style yoghurt.  Very tasty!

The flavors meld together beautifully in this soup.  The sweet comes in first then the spicy has a strong finish.  I did not have garlic or mustard powder.  I used dijon mustard, about a teaspoon, and used a fresh sweet potato that I cubed and boiled.  The soup was served on New Years Day with sweet corn muffins to my friends.  Everybody loved it.

Made this last night and honestly made adjustments simply because of what I had on hand vs. going to the store. I used 2 cans of black beans drained, 1/4 can diced tomatoes, oven roasted fresh sweet potato along with the red pepper in a little olive oil, gave it some extra fire roasted taste. Skipped the mustard, onion, and garlic powder and added a little extra garlic. Very tasty, something I would definately make again because I usually have all on hand.  Would be good served with some brown rice.

I really enjoyed the flavor combination in this dish. I didn't use every pitch, but I happened to have most of the ingredients, so I used the ones I had. Nice Vegan Dish!

All I can say is Yummy!!! I made some tweaks to the recipe, but was asked to make this again... I used fresh sweet potatoes and sauteed them with the other veggies. I also used fresh black eyed peas. There wasn't enough liquid so I added 4 cups of veggie broth and 4 cups of chicken broth. We also chopped up a whole jalapeno, seeds and all to make it spicier... I didn't add the garlic or onion powder since I added fresh, but added dried cilantro and parsley. Last but not least, I used fire roasted canned tomatoes instead of fresh ones...

This was a very tasty soup and I will make it again!  This was my first time eating Black-Eyed Peas.  Just a quick note- I found that I had to cook the soup for about 3-4 hours to soften the Black Eyed peas.  I had soaked them overnight.  Normally I cook my soup in a crock, however this time I made it on the stove and I also found that I needed to keep adding water.  Great Recipe!

Used 2 small fresh sweet potatoes, one regular tomtato, and a whole red pepper. I used 4 cups of broth instead of the 1 cup of water and 1 cup of broth - with the increased amounts of other ingredients it was needed. I didn't put in the oregano, basil, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, and mustard powder. I kept the same amount of cinnamon, but then I love the taste so I didn't find it strong. I also increased the amount of cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon - I generally like my food spicier than recipes give. I cooked 3 breasts of chicken in the soup when it was simmering and then cut them into strips when cooked. I liked that this made it heartier and absorbed some of the extra liquid I used. 
With the modifications made, I really like this soup - the family agrees, although my mum found it too spicy for her liking - but this was because of my modification.

Sorry, I'm not a fan of this one.  There's too much going on with all the different spices; I think you need to pick a set of spices that compliment each other rather than using a pinch of everything.  Also, the cinnamon was a bit overwhelming.  Will not be making this again.

This was a lot better than I expected it to be. I love sweet foods, this one was just right. The sweet taste was not too over powering because of the spicy taste that it also gave. I will be making this dish a lot!

This was delicious!  The flavor of the broth is similar to a barbecue rub.  I thought it needed something green in it, so I added kale.

Not a fan of black-eyed peas, but this soup is delicious! I used jarred roasted bell pepper, and only used basic spices as suggested. I only used 1/8 tsp. of cayenne with no red pepper flakes, and the kids loved it! My husband added more spice and loved it too.

This soup was freakin' awesome!  I used part of a cinnamon stick and about 1 1/2 fresh hot peppers (it was a little spicy).  I refrained from taking a pinch of every spice in my cabinet as another reviewer suggested.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the recipe seems a little off with all those pinches.  Maybe I'm a jerk but oh well!  Stick to the spices that make the soup sweet and spicy and you've got yourself a five star soup indeed.

pretty good. used fresh sweet taters, otherwise followed the recipe reasonably closely. didn't have a couple of the "secret herbs and spices", but there were so many and frankly, so little of most of them that i can't imagine it made any difference.

We really liked this soup.  I followed the directions pretty closely, But used real onion and garlic, not dried and did put in most of the other seasonings, all fresh, though.  I also used fresh baked sweet potatoes and used less water. I also put in shredded chicken. It really hit the spot!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  We ended up making it with fresh beans and fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned beans and sweet potatoes, and it was delicious!  Already shared with family and friends.

This is a very good vegan soup.  My husband the carnivore even likes it.  I think it is much better made with meat broth and to add a little meat also.

Exotic and delicious.  I used a large fresh yam and 1/2 can diced tomatoes.  I left out the onion and garlic powder since the "real things" were already in the soup, and cut the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  Even better the next day for lunch.

Edible, but not great.  I prefer sweet potato pie and candied sweet potato.  I think the main problem is too much cinnamon and not enough other spices.  Adding asiago sounds like a good idea.

I have made this several times since I found it.. Absolutely a keeper.  And, contrary to other review, the spices do work together.

This recipe is fantastic. I used all the spices listed just in different amounts. I bumped the cumin, cayenne and coriander seeds up to 1/4 teaspoon. I did use freshly crushed coriander seeds for maximum flavor. I used just 1/8 teaspoon for the thyme, basil, oregano and rosemary. Used a pinch of mustard powder and stuck with only fresh onion and garlic  instead of water I upped the broth. 2 cans of Swansons chicken broth 2 cans of black eyed peas and I can of diced tomatoes. I cooked 2 sweet potatoes separate then diced them before adding them to the stew. I cooked the onion, garlic, celery and red pepper together to begin. I waited to add the spices until after I added the liquid. I did grill some chicken breasts and diced those up before adding to the stew for a more complete meal. Finally I garnished with fresh cilantro rather than parsley for a brighter flavor. Almost forgot I went ahead and used 1 full teaspoon cinnamon with the tablespoon brown sugar. I didn't think 1/2 tsp. gave it enough flavor. I almost didn't use all the spices but figured that was why I picked this recipe. I wanted to try something really different from my usual fare. This was truly an exotic and wonderful tasting dinner. We will be fixing this again often!

I really don't like being a negative Nelly, but I didn't care for this recipe at all.  :O(  I followed the recipe as written, so it may just be that I don't like my soups to be sweet.  I ended up draining the veggies and freezing them to do something with at a later time.

Delicious!  Wonderful combination of spices and textures.  I eliminated the Rosemary and cut back on the cinnimon, added apple chicken sausage and okra.  I also substitued the dried pepper spices with a fresh blend of chopped Mexican-style peppers.  I added the juice of and a teaspoon of Clementine rind.  Finally, I used avocado as a garnish.  My family loved it!  We served it with French bread. It is very different but should please even picky eaters.

My family loved this recipe.  I made the 'Big Rey' version and it was easy, filling and delicious.  I am looking forward to trying it cold tomorrow.

I made this soup for a Friday night soup supper during Lent and people inhaled it. It is sooooo good! I am making it again tonight for myself.

This stuff is kick *** good.  As others have said, omit any powdered spices, and use the seasonings you like.  I used the basil, oregano, cumin, coriander and cayenne pepper, and allspice instead of cinnamon.  I just used frozen peppers I had on hand.  This is such a versatile recipe, I will be sure to have the ingredients in my pantry at all times!  Thanks!

Good mix of flavors. Mine had a bit of heat. I think next time I would add extra beans or potatoes or a thickener (but I admit I added extra water not called for).  I thought this would be nice (if thicker) as fully puréed with a dollop of plain yogurt.

COMPLETELY AMAZING! Was looking for a vegan soup that was totally intriguing..and this was it, indeed.  While taken aback by the number of "pinches" of so many things, and the huge amount of cinnamon involved, I went with it, 99% as created.
I am so glad I did.  Disappeared too fast to even leave a single serving leftover!
The fragrance while it was cooking was incredible.  My fear that the large amount of cinnamon would render it bizarre was totally unfounded.
NOT SURE if this is a typo or what, but one cup of vegetable broth/one cup of water are NOT going to be sufficient to support "eight servings" and/or the weight of the ingredients involved, so I upped it to 4 cups of vegetable broth and a cup of water. That worked quite well.
The ONLY things I added were a thinly sliced carrot to saute in along with the onion and my traditional splash of lemon juice at the end to "brighten" the flavors.
This was PERFECT just as created!

I really liked how filling this soup is, and I like that it's full of healthy beans and sweet potatoes, but it did need some adjustments in the spice department. I agree with other reviewers that this recipe, as written, has too many competing flavors.  I could tell by the ingredient list that this would create problems so I left out the onion and mustard powders, the thyme, rosemary, basil, and coriander. Sometimes its best to stick to certain flavors and really let them shine, rather than throwing everything in the pot. Still a very good base recipe for warm, comforting winter soup. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe, but I made a few changes to adapt to the spices I had in the pantry. I used two pinches of Herbs de Provence instead of the Rosemary , thyme, oregano, and basil. Added more fresh garlic instead of the powdered stuff. Used Two onions and two stalks of celery. Used canned diced tomatoes and dried black eyed peas. Also fresh sweet potatoes.  Used one teaspoon of Korean Pepper flakes no Cayenne pepper. ALso Chicken broth instead of Veggie broth. THis is a great recipe. Lots of flavors and room for your own adjustments.  Tastes like a sweet chili
