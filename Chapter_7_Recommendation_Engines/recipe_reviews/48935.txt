Wow, refreshing is an understatement, Albert! This is a great recipe! Just the perfect combination of lemon and pineapple. Not too sweet, not too tart; and bubbly to boot! Love this!Thanks.

This is one of those drinks that you make when you want to treat yourself.  Sometimes I want more than lemonade or a soda.  This does the trick and is so good!  For an adult version, I added a shot of gin and there were raves all around.

This is sooooooo good! I did add more of the syrup than the recipe called for (it was too weak) but other than that it is fantastic. I added a little rum once (or twice or...) and it made a great adult drink.

Very refreshing summer drink.  I loved having the syrup in the fridge, although it didn't last too long since everyone wanted more....

We made this drink, exactly as written, for a summer BBQ and it was NOT a hit.  The honey gave the whole thing an odd after taste. We tried doctoring it up with additional lemons, then some orange liqueur.  No luck. There was something just off with the flavor and it missed the mark for everyone.  I gave it 3 stars because I love the idea of it.  Sorry, we probably won't make this again.

This was a delicous drink i believe i had about 3 glasses of this.it's so refreshing.I love the pineapple lemon combination so great.I really didn't let it marinate overnite because we kinda drink it up 4 hours after i made it.It was just delicious Albert.I didn't used 1/2 cup of honey i just used 1 1/2 cup of sugar didn't want the funny taste of honey in it.But all in all i know i will atleast be making this probably once or twice a week .That for sure i just gotta stock up on pineapple juice and fresh lemons Thanks again Albert.

We LOVED these!!  My husband said it was one of the most refreshing drinks he's ever had (another fave is Ginger Lemonade, from this site).  It was easy to do and looked so elegant.  I really love this recipe and I'm so glad I tried it.  We're always buying Knudson spritzers, and now we can make our own!  Oh, I cut back on the sugar, like another reviewer, to 2/3 cup.  Will make again!

yummy! I made with a little less of everything, and it was still good. Less sugar is better, though.

It was good, but I wished that this had more of a lemony taste to it.  I added an extra lemon, but may cut down to less pineapple juice next time.

Loved it!  My biggest challenge was finding carbonated water!  I don't know why, but it was very difficult for me to find!  I used more of the syrup per cup than specified, but it was phenomenal!  I think a little cocnut rum added to the mix would be for a great adult beverage.

This is yummy!  I didn't refrigerate overnight and served with club soda.  Also, served with sprite when the club soda ran out.  I would definitely say this makes more than six servings!

Love this drink! Really delightful flavour. Just one thing I might change the next time I make it is adding lesser sugar. I used 3/4 cup of sugar and it was still quite sweet for me. Otherwise, I really like the flavour of it! :)

This was nothing special.  I agree with some others that 2 oz syrup per glass was not enough.  I made several glasses and went back and tasted and ended up adding about 2 more oz. per glass.  Good, but not great.  Really couldn't taste the lemon juice, just pineapple and honey.

Delicious! Replaced carbonated soda with a light rum. A fantastic summer drink and well worth the few minutes in front of the stove (we did not refrigerate it overnight, just poured it hot over ice and added rum).

I didn't care for this at all because of the fact that it seemed to have a strange after taste.  At first I thought it was something I'd done wrong (though I made this recipe exactly as written), and that perhaps I was the only one in the family that noticed it, but my husband said he tasted it as well.  Maybe it's the use of  honey in this recipe; I'm not sure, but it might be interesting to try this using all sugar instead.  Also, I wouldn't use canned pineapple juice because that seemed to only add to the after taste.  Two ounces of syrup in each glass didn't seem quite right, it was difficult to taste anything except for the aftertaste.  I did not find this to be refreshing at all, just odd.  This was an interesting recipe, though, and I will try it again, but omit the honey and add fresh, ripe pineapple instead of canned juice (though with the addition of fresh fruit, I guess the syrup would need to be  consumed pretty quickly).  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I didn't plan thsi far enough ahead to let it sit overnight. I let it cool just enough to use. I made summery cocktails for the 4th of July by using 2 oz of the pineapple syrup, two oz of citron vodka & two oz of ginger ale...cheers!

This beverage is super refreshing!! After reading everyone's reviews, I did decided to make a few adjustments. I did not use any honey. I did use 1 cup of sugar like the recipe states, but to add a more intense flavor of lemon, I zested at least four lemons to the pineapple juice as well as the juice from those lemons. Then I strained the mixture before adding it to the soda water. It was sweet, tart and delicious!
