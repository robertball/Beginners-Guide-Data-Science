This was absolutely the most beautiful "fruit bread" I've ever had! Mind you, i'm crazy about orange and cranberries. It became my holiday favourite this year -- made 7 or 8 batches of it! Everyone I share it with loved it too. Used chopped pecans in one batch (almonds are my preference, but I ran out) and was still lovely. I'll make this again and again ... Now to invest in a proper zester so I can give my neighbour's back!

A great recipe for cranberry orange bread.  It came out perfectly, and the spices were just right.  Used pecans, as I had no almonds; it was delicious, but I'll be it's even better with almonds.  Thanks so much.

I used 1&1/2c cranberries cut in half and an extra 1/2tsp vanilla.  Fragrant and delicious.

very tasty, but I add orange juice that is more concentrated than usual.  Also watch the cooking time, the bread goes from perfectly done to overdone very quickly.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a great moist quick bread.  I only cooked it for 45-50 minutes so that it wouldn't dry out...it was perfectly done.  The only thing I wanted was a more intense flavor.  Next time will add more orange zest and try using plumped up craisins instead of fresh cranberries.

The sweetness and tartness of the bread is just perfect. I would add a little more orange zest, but first batch turned out magnificent.

Pretty good. I can't give 5 stars because it was kind of dry. The flavor was nice though.

Excellent.  Very moist.  Freezes well.  I added a little extra orange zest and made my OJ extra strong from concentrate as well as fresh orange.

My granddaughter and I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was delicious and moist -- although we did not add any nuts.  We made mini loaves, wrapped them in foil, tied them with homespun ribbon and then made gift tags.  It was such a hit that I know we will be expected to do it again for Christmas.  Thanks for such a good recipe.

I loved this bread but, based on other reviews, I used almond extract instead of vanilla and reduced the cooking time about 7 minutes. I was very pleased with the outcome but next time, I will add about 1/4 C more cranberries.  Great to have around the house during the holidays and it is sure to become an annual tradition!
