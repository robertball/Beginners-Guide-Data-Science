This might be a little basic, but perhaps that’s a good thing.  Because if you want a good, reference recipe for guacamole with reliable measurements of the usual ingredients of avocado, onion, lime (or lemon) juice and tomato, you can count on this one.  From there add cumin, fresh garlic or minced, fresh jalapeno peppers to your heart’s content.  (Recipe submitters hoping to be published, take note - come up with an adorable title like this and get AR's attention - as this did mine :)

I added a bit more garlic powder and used a can of organic diced tomatoes drained. I put everything in a food processor. It is quicker. My Favorite one....Thanks a million

This is a good basic starter recipe for guacamole, I used fresh garden tomatoes and fresh garlic, and a few dashes of my favorite hot sauce. I agree with another reviewer the title caught my attention.

Yummy!  It was a hit at my son's bday party.  It was gobbled up so quickly I wish I made double the amount.  I've been asked to make it again for an upcoming Christmas party.  Thanks

I used only 2 avocados. I needed to use more sea salts for flavor ( I blended Hickory/Maldon Flakes/ Morton Lite salt  ALL) also needed more Garlic powder & added pieces of Jalapeno .  Once I got it right for me, I ate the entire thing

I added less salt and still found it quite salty.  Although I loved it, I would definitely add even less.

If you want guacamolé to stay fresh and green instead of oxidizing and turning black, sprinkle lemon or lime juice over it in the bowl!

I like to garnish it with some black olives, as well!

Super guacamole! Try exchanging the cayenne for Green Tabasco sauce. I think it pairs so much better with the lime and cilantro in this dish. Since it has a milder flavor, I like to add a little extra. I taste after adding a few squirts and go from there.

This is pretty close to perfect guacamole for me. I don't always like to add tomatoes, but that's an easy fix. I used one tomato when I made it this time. I didn't have lime juice, but lemon worked just fine. I omitted the sea salt and garlic powder and used 1 tsp garlic salt. Made as written or with a few tweaks, you can't go wrong with this recipe.

Onion & tomato are great additions.  Very nice blend of ingredients to finish a great dip.
