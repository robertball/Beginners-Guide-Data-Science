I added fresh garlic, and used zuccini and red and yellow sweet peppers for the veggies.  A great side dish for chicken.

This was actually quite tasty and easy to make. However, I think that next time I make it (and there probably will be a next time) I will add either diced tomatoes or red bell peppers for the color. I did peel the zucchini, maybe that was why it was so bland looking. Over all a good recipe. Thanks for posting.

This is another versatile recipe; throw in whatever you like, can't go wrong.  I enjoy it best during the summer months with a variety of slightly warmed cherry tomatoes picked fresh from the garden. Great recipe, thanks.

As is this recipe is a little bland. I added some fresh garlic and a can of diced tomatoes. I think that some fresh grated parmesan would be a great addition to this dish as well, I didn't add any because I wanted dairy free.

Very good, but I like to add a very thin tomato sauce to it.

This was very good however I will add more cheese next time.  I actually am thinking of adding a shredded parmesan or romano to compliment this dish.

Using a combination of the previous two reviewers, I added some minced garlic and 1/2 green bell pepper (sliced).  After sauting the veggies, I added a splash of chicken broth and then a splash of white wine. Once heated, I poured all over the pasta. An okay, economical meal. If I had made this with a main dish, I might have recieved it a little better but since I made this as a quick lunch for my daughter and I - I found it lacking in flavor and a little "dry."

B-O-R-I-N-G recipe as written.  It might be okay for
some, but I tasted first & then added garlic, sun dried tomatoes in oil, slivered fresh basil, green onions and lots of parmesan.  I'll make it again with my tweeks.

It was very simple and easy to make, and for extra flavoring I added butter-sauteed onions and garlic and a few more herbs. It was sooo good.

Not too special, but it was a great way to use up a zuke I had in the fridge. I also added some chopped garlic. This recipe isn't bad to use as a starting point for great additions. Thanks.

I'm not sure how this recipe would have turned out if I'd followed it exactly. I added green pepper, onion, garlic, parmasean cheese, red pepper and carrots. I also stirred in some shredded chicken. It tasted great with these additions!

This is an extremely versatile recipe - I followed the recipe but also had some leftovers from the Fourth of July party we had, so decided to throw in what I had.  Delish!  I added artichoke hearts, feta cheese, olives and zucchini (both green and yellow) - fabulous!  I don't salt and pepper anything until just before serving and noted that it needed a little more salt than usual, but other than that this is a dish I can use leftovers in for a cold pasta salad as well as turning it into a main course (adding chicken or salmon, etc).

Sounds wonderful.  I will add green beans, tomatoes, garlic and corn.  Once they are sauted, I will add bow tie pasta and some cooked chicken.  Thanks for recipe!

This dish was okay but then I added Parmesan cheese and a large clove of garlic. This addition made it a five star.

I dislike onion so I chopped a tomato and some mushrooms then added it to the zucchini for a less potent flavor that onions produce.
