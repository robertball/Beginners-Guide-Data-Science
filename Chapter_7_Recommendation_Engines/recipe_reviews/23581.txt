Yikes! This recipe sounded good, BUT I made it for a friend's birthday and ended up having to run out and purchase (gasp!) a pie at the last minute. The cake was not sweet, very dense, but not very moist - it definitely needed something - but no amount of frosting could salvage this one. Sorry - but I will be removing this one from my Allrecipes Recipe Box.

I think the original recipe has too much flour.  I have made this for 20 years.  I only use 2 cups flour and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I use one 15 oz. can of pumpkin instead of measuring 2 cups and one small package of choc. bits (anything to make it easy for me).  Bake for 1 hour in bundt pan a5 350 degrees.  It is soooo moist.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar, too.  I make it for an annual holiday bake sale, and it goes immediately!

Good cake. Turned out great.  However, as soon as I tasted it I realized that there was no salt in the recipe. Try adding 1 teaspoon of salt to the recipe and you will find that it tastes much better.

YES, I had a successful muffin! I scaled this recipe back to 6 servings and I still ended up with 11 muffins that were on the small side. I only made one change and that was using pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. The chocolate chips I used were mini chocolate chips. Baking at 350*, my muffins were done at 20 minutes. They turned out moist and perfect with just enough chocolate without going overboard. I'll make these again.

I made this in muffin pans (it made 24 regular sized muffins). I also ommited the chocolate chips and nuts as my sister has braces. I gave it 4 stars because the muffins weren't as flavorful as I had hoped, but still pretty good. The next time I make them I will try adding 1/2 cup of sugar and increase the cinnamon to 2-3 tsp. With those minor adjustments I think this would easily be a 5 star recipe! These were really simple to make. If you use muffin pans instead it will take longer to bake than most muffin recipes, but I forgot to watch the time so just watch them closely.

made this recipe for a neighborhood get together and everyone ooh'd and aah'd over it.   Did do as other suggested and scaled down flour to 2 cups and added a tsp salt.
