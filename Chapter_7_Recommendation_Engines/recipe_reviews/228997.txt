I have been making this recipe for 30 years.  I don't even like blueberries, but I LOVE them with this recipe.  I first found it in a low calorie cookbook and I have been making it ever since.  I serve over rice.

I used chicken thighs and apricot jam because that's what I had,  and cooked 4 hours on high in a slow cooker.  Using a slow cooker did unfortunate things for the blueberry color, but it tastes AMAZING. This was great served over rice.

It was good: hubby really liked it, kids not too crazy for it, I thought it was okay not the best thing, but certainly not the worst. Thinking we will probably not make it again. Worth the try though, and not difficult to make! The orange marmalade was a predominant flavor though, present in every bite. We used fresh blueberries, too.

This is a super simple, but very different flavor for a chicken dish!  I used fresh blueberries which paired with the orange marmalade to create a very sweet glaze over the chicken.  Will definitely use this idea again!
