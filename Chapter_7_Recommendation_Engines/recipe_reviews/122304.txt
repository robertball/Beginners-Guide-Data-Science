"Wow.  Just like Davey's Chuck Wagon in Denver,” my wife said after her first bite. Instead of cutting back on the sausage (as others have suggested), I simply increased the amount of milk in the gravy to 2 cups.  Also, I highly recommend adding freshly cracked pepper liberally while cooking. And if looks matter to you, the way you drop the biscuit batter on the cookie sheet is the way they’ll come out.  Be sure to double the recipe if you’re serving more than 3 people.  The recipe for the biscuits makes about 5 large biscuits -- consider doubling it even if you don't double the gravy recipe.

I did not make the gravy portion of this recipe but did make the biscuits. My dad is my biggest critic and he told me that "These are the best biscuits I ever had". They are light and fluffy. To the people that thought they were dense must of over mixed them and made them tough. The key of biscuits is to never over mix. I cooked mine in greased muffin tins and they turn out wonderful. I will definltey make these in the future.

Great recipe and easy. Everyone loved it and ate it all up. The only thing is the servings were off, at least for me. I made a double recipe of the gravy and a quadruple recipe of the biscuits. If I were making just one recipe of the gravy I would double the biscuit recipe.

I made these this morning- vegan style.  SmartBalance organic for the butter, soy milk for the milk, and soysage for the sausage.  Delicious!  The only give-away to the veganness of this was that I used vanilla soy milk without thinking... Soooo the gravy was a bit sweet.  Fun, though!  Thanks!

This was so good! Biscuits and Gravy is my husband's favorite breakfast and he said that this was by far the best he's ever had! I made a few changes as suggested - I added 2 cups of milk instead of 1 3/4 cups. We also added more sausage (we used 1/2 pound pork sausage) because my husband and I are meat lovers. We also doubled the biscuit recipe, but followed the gravy recipe exactly. In addition, I added a little extra butter for the biscuits - 2TBLS and a little extra salt, and they tasted great. We still have several biscuits for leftovers too! Great recipe! "WooHoo!" says my husband. :c)

I only made the biscuit portion of this recipe, so I can not comment on the gravy, but the biscuits were the best I have ever made. Ever. Yay!
I lightly hand formed them in to "biscuit" shapes rather than just scooping and dropping them on the pan.
Next time I will add a pinch more salt.

Wow!!! I have never had gravy biscuits in my life up until yesterday. I live in the South, so I figured I needed to at least try one in my lifetime. I did, and I was instantly addicted! I made them again this morning! Do the recipe as is, as it is PERFECT! Loved it!

I make the gravy for this all the time.  I have my own biscuit recipe that is just great.  The only thing I do differently is that I used about 1-2 tablespoons of bacon grease along with some dried sage.  It works great.  
Thanks for the base recipe to help me out.

I cooked the gravy and sausage only. These were pretty good but not as good as everyone made them out to be. They tasted pretty normal and I have had much better. And I also don't get why my gravy turned out brown colored. I think because the recipe tells you to start cooking the gravy with the sausage in the same pan. It looked very gross actually, and I didn't want to eat it. When I make this again, I will do it separately then just mix the sausage and gravy together at the last minute.

It just doesn't get any easier than this! Like others, I decreased the sausage/gravy ratio. Added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder to the gravy (this gal loves her garlic). Helpful tip: recipe doubles very well. Used the leftover gravy for our mashed potatoes and fried chicken the next night.

I loved how fluffy the biscuits were!  Thank you for this super simple and just right recipe.

I personally used bisquick to make drop biscuits (just easier) yet I flavour them with dill and rosemary. For the sausage, this is a great starter but I do prefer more gravy to sausage than this gave me. With some tinkering, this has been wonderful!!!

I made the gravy and it looked really good but was a little bland for my taste.  I added some Worcester sauce and cayenne pepper to the mix and that made all the difference to me.  Definitely will be making this again.

I love this recipe. It's super simple and always turns out really yummy! I usually add a bit more pepper, but we always love it. I can even substitute our almond milk in there and it still tastes great! I will be making these tonight for dinner again, actually! :)

Very delicious! I'm not normally a biscuit and gravy fan, but I really liked these. They were really very easy and I really liked the texture of the biscuits. I used whole wheat flour and they still turned out great!

I loved the gravy and the biscuits came out good as well, although mine were very spikey and my husband called them "sea urchins". Oh well....

The one thing I changed was that I used turkey breakfast sausage as opposed to pork. Tasted pretty much the same but with a little different texture.

They were good, but it had this uncooked flour flavor. Maybe because I used buttermilk instead of whole milk for the biscuits, but I'm not sure. I'll follow the exact recipe next time.

This is really good- there were no leftovers, so I know it's a keeper! i only had one problem, the bottom of my biscuits were a bit hard, but it could be my fault. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the instructions exactly, even added a little extra salt. I did not over mix the biscuits.  Biscuits were dense and the gravy was bland.

The best gravy I've had in a long time. My family LOVED it! The biscuits were a little dense for me but I possibly overcooked them. I doubled both the biscuits and gravy and it fed our family of four with a little left over (my kids are toddlers so they still don't eat much).  I will definitely make again!

This was fantastic.  As it happens, I have never made biscuits ever before because I do not like them, at least the ones from cans!  So when my 20yr. old son requested biscuits & gravy for his B-day dinner, I thought oh my, well this will be interesting.  so to allrecipes i go and this is the one i settled on.  the only changes i made was to double the gravy, double the biscuits and added dried sage to gravy.  to my delight and the delight of the whole family, this was a hit and very delicious.  gravy rocked and can't wait to make it for chicken fried steaks!  even at age 44 i find if i didn't like something my whole life, just try it again homemade and i may be surprised!

These were delicious!  I made the biscuit recipe exactly as stated except tripled it so we would have some leftovers.  I made the gravy exactly as stated except left out the sausage (we don't eat much meat) and it was really great.  I have tried several different gravy recipes and none of them turned out very good, but finally, this one did!  I sort of understand people's comments about it being a little plain...but it's biscuits and gravy...to me, this is how it's suppose to taste!

I am giving this a five even though I totally forgot the BUTTER in the biscuit!  I microwaved it to melt it and forgot to add it!  The biscuits turned out a bit dry but that was my fault.  Delicious gravy though!  Great recipe!

WOW! Excellent!! My family did not leave any leftovers and they were searching for more :) Even my 4 year old who is a very picky eater LOVED IT!  Double the biscuit recipe if you are gonna feed more than 2 people and use 2 cups of milk in the Gravy.

I used the KFC clone recipe for the biscuits, so I can't comment on those, but the gravy is excellent.  I took this to work, and everyone raved about it.  This recipe is a keeper.

Followed instructions exactly but did modify the recipe slightly: I doubled the milk for the gravy recipe (for 2 reasons: I hate thick gravy and the amount in the recipe doesn't make enough in my opinion) and I didn't need to bake my biscuits that long. Other than that, I loved it! Quick and easy to make!!

This gravy is awesome! I used chicken sausage (I've never had bulk pork sausage, but the chicken was full of yummy herbs which really added an extra kick) and salt to taste. Also, the first time I made it, it was a little to milky so the next time I used a little less than 1 1/2 cups of milk and that seemed to be perfect. I used frozen Pillsbury biscuits which were ok, but I'm sure homemade are 100% better.

Excellent and easy recipe!  I had never made this before, now it's regular breakfast here.  I don't usually have sausage on hand, so I use ground venison and add a piece of chopped bacon if I have it.  Also a nice variation on biscuits is to add a cup of shredded cheese and a couple cloves of chopped garlic.  I have made the biscuits with 1/2 whole wheat flour also and they came out nice.

Wish I could rate this a 7 Trippled recipe for biscuits and tapped down with a spoon dipped in flour. They came out like home made GRANDS. Only had HOT Italian sausage otherwise followed recipe as written. First time making and if I had this in a restaurant, I would go back for lunch. This will be a family keeper for a long time

Great, quick, easy recipe. I made them vegetarian by adding seitan "sausage". I also added some red pepper flakes to get back the spiciness that was missing from not using real sausage. It was a big hit. I'll definitely make this the next time we have overnight guests!

I made the biscuits only and followed the directions exactly. The biscuits were hard and dry. Maybe the gravy would have helped.

Round one: followed recipe as written and the biscuits came out like pancakes and the gravy was bland.  Round Two: and we have a winner!!!  Sauteed half an onion and four large cloves of garlic with the sausage.  Also used my usual biscuit recipe: 2 1/4 C flour, 1 T baking powder, 3/4 t salt, 1/2 softened butter, and enough buttermilk to make a dough.  My changes made a 5 star breakfast!

These are nice, soft, crumbly biscuits good for crumbling up and smothering with gravy.  There is not a lot of flavor, so adding extra butter or maybe even salt helps.  I used double the amount of butter called for, but think it could still use more.  Since these are designed to go with gravy, a flavorful gravy will make up for the lack of flavor.  These are better than Bisquick, but my search for the perfect drop biscuit continues.  I plan to make these again, using more butter and salt to see if that helps.

The gravy was great- I used 3 tbs of butter instead of 1 in gravy, and browned it before I added milk, biscuits were pretty good, next time I would prefer canned if I have them.

I found the biscuits to be tasteless but I suppose that is what the gravy is for.  I didn't want to go to the store so I used canadian bacon (1 package) and added enough beef bouillon to mix with the 1 3/4 cup milk, adding it into the gravy mixture when it was sufficiently hot.  the bouillon added flavor but I am sure cooking with the sausage would have been more flavorful.  I think the canadian bacon was healthier and tasty so I would continue to make this with my substitutions but I am intrigued to try it with sausage.  I would use a different biscuit recipe though.

I didn't like the biscuits so much and prefer a more buttery biscuit, but my family enjoys the gravy part.  Will make the gravy again for sure!

I have been looking for a good biscuit and I FOUND IT... I doubled the recipe and put in 2 tbls of butter instead of 2 teaspoons and they were very yummy... Was hoping for leftovers but that didn't happen. My family of 4 devoured the meal. Definitely will be making this again and again.

I only made the gravy in this recipe but my husband and myself LOVE it!!! Neither one of us care for sausage too much, but in this recipe, it tastes great!

I made this exactly as instructed, and all 11 teenage boys loved it, even the picky ones.  Very easy, I plan to make ahead and reheat for an easy breakfast in the future.

I had never made biscuits and gravy before but my boyfriend can live off of them. When I tried this recipe the gravy was perfect but the biscuits just weren't doing the trick even after the 3rd and 4th time making this recipe. Now I just use this gravy recipe (cos it's perfect!) but opt for a different biscuit recipe. I must make this more than 3 times a week, this will fill you up on a cold winter day.

I have been searching for the best biscuits and gravy, by going from resturant to resturant. I finally decided that I need to learn how to make this dish myself.  This recipe was AWESOME.  My daughters and husband wanted more.  I can't wait to make it again.  I did substitute the pork sausage for turkey. Again, this was Great!!!

The first time I cooked this gravy I thought it was missing something, so the second I added just 1/4 tsp of "better than bouillon" beef base and it was the something extra I was looking for. Very yummy.

Delicious!  I used 2 cups of milk for the gravy and added a little dried basil when I cooked the sausage and it turned out perfectly.  It was the best father's day breakfast!!  Thank you for the great recipe

Love these biscuits! Have yet to make the gravy but the biscuits alone are fantastic! I add a little garlic powder and some shredded cheese to them. Used them as turkey burger buns last night and they were amazing!

I didn't use the drop biscuit recipe (hubby loves the gravy over toast..reminds him of the military!),but the gravy recipe was fantastic! I followed it but added 3/4 lb of sausage and hubby went back for 2nds and wanted to know when I was going to make it again. It was delicious!

This was really good. The biscuits are pretty straight forward, so next time I would double the salt. I did pour pure maple syrup over them, which helped the flavor and added sweetness. The gravy was really good, but I had to add extra salt and pepper to taste. My fiancee loved this, and said it's better than the biscuits and gravy at Ihop.

This is a really good, inexpensive, easy recipe.  Most of the time I buy biscuits and just make the sausage gravy...even easier!  I always double, since we like it so much.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

I gave this 5 stars because I am not a big fan of Drop Biscuits, but these were excellent.  Maybe it was the combination of the Gravy and the Recipe that made everything work to perfection.  I made one change with the sausage.  I cut the required amount in half and used bacon for the other half.  My kids wolfed it down and were beggin for more.

Mmmmmmmm is all our friend visiting from NC could say. Yes, he wants the recipe, too. He didn't know you could make them at home!  He loves gravy and biscuits so I thought I'd make this for him. It was sooo easy! Biscuits and I are not friends but I was at awe as to how well they came out. Delicious! Thanks for this post!

My husband loves biscuit and gravy for breakfast, so I decided to look for a recipe and  I found this by darlene. I followed all the ingredients except for the bulk pork sausage since I don't it on hand, but what I substituted was ground beef. I added 2 cups of milk and little bit of salt and lots of fresh pepper since my husband loves the taste. About the biscuit, it was so yummy! It was light and floppy,adding a pinch of salt made it the best biscuit ever!. I shaped the biscuit beautifully in the baking sheet and it really turned appetizing.

I made only the biscuits. I did follow that half of the recipe exactly as written. The biscuits were easy and delicious, and not too unhealthy. (As compared to some biscuit recipes with say, half a cup of butter. Per biscuit)

I double the biscuits and keep the gravy the same. My husband is from the south, and I am from california, so when I first made him this he was shocked! He said its the best biscuits and gravy he has ever had! I will be making this for years to come.

Really easy and really yummy! We use bacon instead of sausage for the gravy and it is fantastic!

My boyfriend wanted biscuits and gravy for breakfast this morning. I thought I would try some thing new and I picked this recipe because it was simple and had few ingredients, I was able to use everything I already have and not go to the store... 

A+ on the gravy, simple and delicious and a perfect thickness. 

I was not however very impressed with the look, feel or taste of the biscuits. I followed the recipe to the T and like some reviews may suggest, it was in no way over-stirred. I was expecting the biscuits to at least rise a little bit but they pretty much looked the same as when I put them in. They tasted ok but were actually a bit dense. 

I will definitely use the gravy recipe again but I think I will go back to my own recipe for the biscuits.

Very easy and tasy! The only things I did differently was add shredded cheddar cheese to the biscuit mix, which meant I had to add a bit more milk and melted butter until I got the right consistancy. As far as the gravy went, I added onion powder and a couple of dashes of red pepper for a bit more flavor. I also was liberal with the salt and the crushed black pepper. Thank you of sharing!

I made this for my boyfriend & I to have today and the servings for 4 ended up filling the two of us up perfectly. I am with the other reviewers in that this makes a LOT of gravy and not as much biscuits, which is fine by me, but might not be for other people. The only thing I will do next time is double the biscuit recipe to feed more people. Oregon represent!

I made the gravy recipe, and used bisquick drop biscuits.  The gravy was fantastic!  I doubled the sausage by accident, but it turned out to be good.  I also added 1/8 tsp cayanne and 1/4 tsp sage to the sausage.

I made this for my family one morning, to thank them for their hospitality and It was a HIT!! I used Pillsbury Buttermilk Biscuits because they were available, and I used the gravy part of this recipe and substituted the pork sausage for turkey sausage. Soo Delicious!!!

This will make you a very picky b&g eater because very few, if any, recipes compare.  It is also really good with the sage sausage and/or some extra red pepper flakes.

The easiest and cheapest thing in the world to make!  And the biscuits are to die for!  We have made this twice.  The first time we used 2 cups of milk in the gravy and 1 lb of sausage instead of 1/2.  Although, it was good, I went overboard on the meat.  3/4 pound is the perfect amount, using 2 cups of milk in the gravy.  You cannot go wrong with this.  And as long as you keep flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, milk, and butter on hand on a regular basis (which most of us do.. the baking powder may be the only less common ingredient for some of us), all you have to do is buy the sausage and you have yourself a meal.  You can make it over and over and over again, only having to purchase the sausage.  It is also excellent reheated the next day.  AAAAA+++++ Thank you, thank you for sharing this.   A true southern breakfast/dinner.

A really easy and flavorful recipe.  My first attempt at homemade biscuits and gravy and I was not disappointed.  If I can do this and have it turn out right, it is a no fail recipe! Try it--it's so easy.

It's always a trade-off to eat food that's healthy and food that tastes really good.  This was a good combination of both.  I used whole wheat flour but probably should have used white so I'll try that next time.  Overall this is definitely a great recipe for an easy breakfast.

I thought this was excellent.  I've made the recipe twice, once with the biscuits and once without.  The gravy has been amazing both times, using regular pork sausage and the second time italian pork links with the skins off, but the biscuits I made were a little lacking but from my own fault!  I didn't use all-purpose flour and instead used a wheat-like flour (didn't think much about it).  The biscuits were still good, but I think they would've been lighter and fluffier if I had instead used the regular flour.  This recipe will definitely stay as a staple in my kitchen.

I added beef consomme, Madiera, diced mushroom and onions to my sausage and gravy. It was excellent. Just make sure you not only time but watch you biscuits. I made small rounds instead it was excellent but if you over cook just a little it may get too hard.

This is one of the most simple ways to make gravy...I just took a whole tuble of Original Jimmy Deans sausage.  I just love the flavor it adds to the gravy.  I had to add just slightly more flour(4T alltogether)  My husband said it is now his favorite  :)

loved this made the gravy exactly as written except with a 12 oz package of morning star vegetarian sausage crumbles, in the freezer section.  i'm a vegetarian with a meat eater husband so this throw back to his southern, meat eating, comfort food, roots made him very happy.  i've made sausage gravy before starting with a flour butter roux and gradually adding milk etc but this method is better you won't get any lumps even if you are only occasionally stirring. a twenty minute crowd pleasing breakfast.  i did double the recipe because you can make some KICKIN' breakfast pocket sandwiches in a sandwich press the next day with left over gravy scrambled eggs and a little cheese.  try it.  :)

I too had to double the biscuit recipe because the original  did not make very much and I cook for a family of 4, but these are SOOO good.  Light and fluffy biscuits, not dry and crumbly.  I prefer more salt but this is a keeper.  My husband LOVED it.

Great starter recipe and you can customize it any way you like!  I added left over chopped up chicken breasts instead of the sausage, decreased the pepper to 1/4 tsp and increased the salt to 1/4 tsp.  It was fab!  I used the Joy of Cooking recipe for biscuits but I am sure these ones are fine too.  You could even do a vegetarian variety of the gravy with potatoes?  What a concept!

My husband and I love this recipe!  We add 1/2 a small chopped onion to the pan as the sausage is browning and also add about 1/8 tsp of garlic powder due to personal taste.  So yummy!

I made this recipe as listed except with double the sausage.  My family is very picky about their biscuits & gravy.  They said if they could give this 8 starts they would.  I will definately be making this again.

Like those who have already reviewed, the portions are rather off.  I would consider it to make about two or three servings for the gravy.  I haven't made the biscuits as I find Bisquick to be easy and amazing.

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  Simplistic, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this recipe. I used hot Italian sausage, and removed it from the casing.  Served it with over easy eggs.  It served two of us two biscuits each, smothered in gravy.  The proportions worked out perfectly for me.  Thanks

This is exactly what I thought it would taste! This was amazing! I had refridgerator biscuits and then I made the gravy- I only used 2  large casings of sausage since it was just me and the kids eating tonight- but next time I will add one more....then I did everything else according to directions- the only thing is next time I will NOT add salt because I find the sausage is salty enough.

This rating is only for the biscuits, as I used a chicken gravy to top them instead of this gravy recipe. The biscuits were SO EASY. Way easier than my normal recipe and with far less fat. Will make again!

I've always been scared of making Biscuits and Gravy because I thought it would be too much work for a Sunday Morning.  Boy was I wrong.  One of the best breakfasts and very quick and easy and this coming from a non-southerner.  This is as good as I got in any cafe.

This recipe gets 5 stars because its easy, cheap and tastes delicious!! My  boyfriend loves biscuits & gravy and he couldn't stop raving about these. I'd say this recipe makes about 2 servings, not 4 though.

I really like the biscuits, I make them alot. Today i tried something different and added about 1/2 cup chopped onion to the batter. They turned out great!!..It's a wonderful variation to the recipe. Since I'm on a low sodium diet I make the recipe with sodium free baking powder and omit the salt. I can't have the gravy because of all the sodium in it..Thanks for a wonderful biscuit recipe.

When my boyfriend mentioned he loved biscuits and gravy, I knew I could count on AllRecipes.com to help me find a good recipe. This recipe is soooo quick and easy to prepare and is a hit! The only thing is I cut back on the salt a bit because the sausages I buy are a bit on the salty side. Will make again and again!

I really liked the gravy but the biscuits were not good. They were dense like I like them but they tasted like cardboard. I added a couple things to the gravy and that made it awesome. A couple dashes of tabasco sauce, and a couple pinches of garlic powder and season salt. It was the best gravy I've ever made.

OMG!  Wow!  So easy and soooo yummy!  The hubby and even my kids liked these biscuits.  I haven't made the gravy, just the biscuits.  They were so awesome.  I'll be making these again for sure!  I may add garlic powder and some cheddar cheese next time just for kicks but they are awesome as is.

It was a hit!  My husband even said he "loved it"...never hear that about food from him, even when he does really like something.  I made it just as stated in the recipe and it turned out perfect and I was surprised how little time it took to cook such a great breakfast!  This recipe will definitely be used over and over in my family.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I only used this biscuit recipe (used my mom's milk gravy recipe with it) but it was great!  Just like the drop biscuits mom used to make as a kid.  So quick and easy too!  I will definitely be making these biscuits often!

Great recipe. I used 1/2 lb of Jimmy Dean sausage which adds more flavor than plain ground pork. I also used another reviewer's suggestion and used 2 cups of water for more gravy. Its so good that I don't have to go to a restaurant anymore for sausage biscuits!

Really tasty drop biscuits.  I couldn't believe how little butter was in it.  I doubled the recipe to make about 14 medium biscuits.

This was great even by itself with jelly.Thanks for the advice on doubling the recipe just right. My 3 1/2 helped this morning so I was worried they looked tough but they were moist on the inside.

I made the biscuits from my beaty crocker cookbook (tried and true fluffy drop biscuits) but then made the gravy exactly as written (but with extra pepper) it was wonderful! Just like Saturday morning breakfast at your favorite diner.

I personally don't eat biscuits & gravy but I made it for the first time with this recipe for my boyfriend. He loved the flavor of the gravy. I did decrease the amount of sausage to about 5-6 oz and used reduced fat sausage. I was disappointed with the biscuits. I admit, I'm not a fan of rolling out biscuits and thought that this would be a good cheat. Next time I'll either buy the giant biscuits in a can or actually make them. We're used to enormous biscuits at the restaurant we go to. Over all- it's a keeper!

So very tasty and quick!!
I used a bit less sausage as well for a more creamy gravy it was totally awesome!! Good for a large family breakfast or even for camping. Layer with your favorite eggs and a few dashes of Tabasco and you've got a good ol' diner breakfast in your jammies!!

just like grandma used to make.  I think buttermilk instead or regular milk makes it a little better.  the drop biscuits are so much easier than rolling them out and cutting them and there is no difference in the taste.

This came out so good! I doubled the biscuit recipe which is a basic drop biscuit recipe...I  added a bit more salt than it called for and added a tablespoon or so of sugar to add some flavor. They came out awesome...soft and fluffy on the inside and a light golden crunch on the outside. The key is not to over mix and do not overbake! I doubled the gravy as well, made with 2% milk and lean ground pork not sausage. Added some cumin, a dash of turmeric, a little bit of dried Italian seasoning and I added more salt than it called for and cracked black pepper. The gravy came out beautiful! Just perfect! The gravy is hearty but not heavy and unhealthy like a lot of bisquit gravy I have seen. I think using the ground pork instead of sausage def eliminates a lot of fat and the recipe only calls for a small amount of butter. To serve I cut the biscuits in half and spread a little butter on them then topped with the gravy. It was freaking delicious!!!! Total comfort food.

The gravy was excellent. Spooned it over a cooked egg nestled in a bed of Pillsbury Flakey Layers biscuits. No restaurant could top this.

I have made both portions of this recipe several times and it is a winner. Sometimes I top the biscuits with shredded cheese or brush with butter and herbs to accompany a soup. Perfect quick bread. The gravy is delicious and I agree with the poster who suggested liberally adding fresh ground black pepper. It makes the gravy. The textures and flavors of this dish are great. The only thing is I usually triple the biscuit recipe as it doesn't make enough for my family of 6. I make them nice and big and they come out light and fluffy.

I used this recipe for the drop biscuits. I wanted to have some biscuits for breakfast but didn't want to do the usual flouring the counter, rolling and cutting the dough. These were very good. I will be making these again. Thanks Darlene for a great recipe.

I always double this recipe! Also, I found the biscuits to be a little too bland, so I have experimented and now added garlic powder, dried parsley flakes, mayonnaise and shredded cheese to them. I am allergic to dairy, so I use all non-dairy ingredients and everyone loves them regardless! Using these extra ingredients makes the whole thing better and more flavorful!

I have made the gravy twice.  I doubled the recipe and it worked out perfectly.  Both times however, the gravy was too spicy for my kids.  I used regular sausage so the next time I will try maple sausage.  I haven't had time to make the biscuits so I've cheated and used the refrigerated kind.  I can't wait to make the biscuits too.

I chose this recipe because my 10 year old son was wanting to make breakfast with little help, and I figured this would be easy as he wouldn't have to roll out biscuits etc.  The gravy was fantastic!  I would have preferred real buttermilk biscuits but I knew what to expect and they weren't bad.

I've been making the gravy portion of this recipe for months now (Also increasing the milk to 2 cups) and it is fabulous. I actually decrease the pork sausage slightly, because my husband prefers a more gravy to meat ratio. Silly guy! However, today I tried the biscuits portion of this and it was NOT good! I would have preferred to eat the gravy on regular slices of bread than those biscuits. So tasteless. They took away from the yummy taste of the gravy. I won't make them again.

DELICIOUS!! Doubling this recipe, however, was still not quite enough for my family of 6. We will make it again, only quadrupled -- for some leftovers, too, of course!

The gravy is good, but the biscuits leave something to be desired. I did NOT over mix and they still turned out very dense and hard. They softened up once in the gravy but definitely not flaky.

First time ever making sausage gravy...it was super easy and a hit!  Definitely will make this again!  I did make a couple of alterations to the recipe.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 tbs of sausage fat and a tbs of butter.  I also salted and peppered to taste. Maybe next time I'll tackle the homemade biscuits.

Wonderful recipe! I didn't have pork sausage so I substituted ground beef and added a little chili powder, garlic powder, and onionion powder

Making this tonight with sausage and adding mixed veggies to the gravy. I made it a couple weeks ago as my first attempt at true biscuits and gravy. My family LOVED IT! I made everything with a gluten free flour blend and almond milk. I also didn't have sausage and subbed a can of chicken. My family still thought it was perfect. I can't wait for dinner tonight!

If you make this recipe EXACTLY the way it states, you WILL have wonderful delicious biscuit gravy! I changed the servings to 10, in hopes to feed a family of 5 and there is MORE then enough for another breakfast. Half of this recipe was consumed with 20 small biscuits. Make sure to add the flour and mix beforehand.. then pour in the milk (which was more then 4 cups when you change the servings to 10) Looks like it is too much, but when its complete, you will have creamy delicious biscuit gravy! I will not be buying the pre-made kind, or sauce packages anymore!!  Thank you!

It needed more seasonings. A little bland. Might try it again and add more to it.

delicious!!!  my first attempt at making biscuits and gravy and this will certainly be my go-to recipe.  a few things:  i doubled the recipe (both for gravy and biscuits).  i added approx 1/3 - 1/2 more cups of milk to the gravy.  next time i would decrease the amount of pepper (it was just a tad too much for my taste; of course not enough pepper for the hubs, so he'll have to season his plate much more generously next time!)  i also dropped the biscuit mix by tablespoonfuls into greased muffin tins--will prob do 10-11 minutes versus the 12 just so the bottoms aren't so browned.  thanks for the recipe, it's great ;)

OMG! this is the first time I ever tried to make something like this and it was delicious. I doubled the biscuits and am so glad I did. The gravy mix heated up wonderful for the next day. Would recommend this recipe to everyone.

Delicious!  My husband is hard to please and he said it was one of the best things I have cooked for him.  I thought the proportion of biscuits to gravy was perfect, but I tend to like extra gravy.  I would use less sausage next time, probably half of what it calls for, just my preference.  And it reheats excellently in the microwave!  Superb!

Trying to go healthy, substituted the butter with coconut oil.  Were still good with my own gravy & butter & jelly, but weren't flaky as hoped, more breadish.  Will try the next time using butter.

The gravy ended up very thin and bland, so we added garlic, onion powder, and more pepper and its 10 times better! 4 stars after additions.

I doubled the gravy portion of this recipe, and used 2 pounds of sausage.  I also added some fennel seed to the gravy. This is a very easy one-pan recipe without all the salt in the packaged gravy mix.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm only reviewing the gravy, since I made different biscuits.  I'm not the biggest fan of biscuits and gravy, but bf likes it so I thought I'd give this recipe a shot for an easy dinner since the biscuits were already made.  If you follow the instructions (I actually did--mostly--for once!) it works out just fine, and it really did leave us with four servings.  I ate one, bf ate two, and we have leftovers.  I actually think this is pretty good for gravy, and bf loved it, so it's definitely a success for us.  I forgot I didn't have any milk in the house before I started this, so I made my own from evaporated milk and just followed the package instructions.  Thanks for the recipe!

The best biscuit and gravy recipe out there.  I personally prefer to make drop biscuits using the recipe on the Heartsmart Bisquick box.  Aside from that, this gravy is absolutely amazing.  Couldn't recommend it more.

I must admit I cheated a little and used some pillsbury refrigerated biscuits. So this rating is for the gravy only. I used 8 flaky biscuits and doubled the gravy. Used Jimmy Deans hot sausage. It was fantastic!! Used the amount of milk suggested but could add a little more at the end if necessary.

The gravy was the best I have had, I did sprinkle a little onion powder and nutmeg in it too add another dimension to it.  The biscuits were good as well, not the best...but way less fat then awesome biscuits so I well keep making them...thanks!

Yum-- easy and tasty! First time I've ever made this. The boyfriend's request was filled and we were both amazed at how comforting and yummy it was. My favorite is Beeler's breakfast sausage.  I'll be making it again soon! I added a little extra pepper for kick, and made 4 huge biscuits, we had it with brussel sprouts. You could feed 3 if it were with other dishes.

Great! my husband loved them, said it was just like his mom made when they were growing up (she's an old farm lady from the midwest, so thats saying something). i love that there is no kneading, you can make the whole thing in 20 minutes and still have that comfort food that usually takes forever. mental notes (more for myself than anything): biscuit recipe only makes about 6 small biscuits, but they are very small. i may have overstirred as they were little dense. gravy recipe used extra sausage (12oz package) and a little extra milk (2cups) and probably extra butter since i dont measure (maybe 2tbs).

Excellent and easy to make!!  One batch makes two servings though.  It was perfect for just me and my husband, but we will double or triple if we have guests.

Biscuits and Gravy are my husbands favorite breakfast so I decided to make it from scratch.  This recipe was fast, easy and yummy!  My only note is that, as a first time biscuit maker, I was assuming the dough would flatten, spread or settle.  They don't.  They come out looking exactly how you place them so, if you care about aesthetics, make sure you make the dough look pretty.

This is my new go-to recipe for biscuits and gravy. The drop biscuits are SO easy - there's basically no reason NOT to make homemade biscuits! [Plus, you'll save money since you likely already have the ingredients in your pantry.] The gravy is exactly how I like it to taste. I didn't change a thing about this recipe and it turned out EXCELLENT.

I made the biscuit portion of this recipe. I was careful to not over mix the dough as this will cause any baked good to be too dense. Unfortunately, I did not care for the results. The only reason I gave this recipe more than one star was because I didn't make the gravy portion.

I actually only made the gravy and used that over Pillsbury biscuits.  It was wonderful.  Very easy to make and my family loved it.  Will be making again.  I doubled recipe.

I tried to make this recipe exactly as it was stated.   The gravy was actually pretty good. The biscuits on the other hand were pretty awful.   I'm not sure why it states "drop" biscuits because when mixed with the given proportions the batter is pretty thick and chunky more like a hard dough than anything you could drop with a spoon. I also cooked the biscuits in the nuwave, but could tell by their overall taste that cooking them in the oven would not make them taste any less floury and bland.   The gravy however tasted good and I will continue to use the recipe. I wish to find a  transfat free alternative to pillsbury biscuits and will keep looking. Thanks!

Loved this...so quick and easy.  The only thing I might change next time is not put so much pepper in.  I know the gravy is supposed to be peppery but I think it was just a little too much...not much though.

Our family makes the same recipe! If you would like to make this more health conscious, try adding a few ice cubes to the pan once the sausage is done. The fat stickes to the ice cubes! Very good recipe!

Great recipe! I like my gravy peppery, so I about doubled the pepper and I also added about 30 secs onto the reduction time to furhter thicken it. Excellent base recipe though. Made it for my father on Father's day and he couldn't get enough!

This turend out pretty good.  Not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst either.  I highly recommend doubling the recipe- the biscuit recipe only yielded 3 med sized drop biscuits w/ a small 4th one.  Once I doubled it I got 7 med sized biscuits all about the same size.  Since I had a 1lb pkge of sausage, I also doubled the gravy portion.  I only had skim milk on hand, but it turned out surprisingly well! Becareful seasoning the gravy until you've tasted it- some sausages are saltier/spicier than others.  I've over-salted my gravy in the past. :(  if you want a little more kick in your gravy, add a few shakes of crushed red pepper.  I really like the texture of the biscuits- mine puffed up nicely and had a soft, flaky texture.  I was caredful not to over-mix them.    My one disappointment was that the biscuits, on their own, were rather bland.  I think next time I'll use buttermilk.  However, with the gravy I didn't notice them.  Overall, a very good and easy recipe.  Will make notes on my printout and use again!

I have never been a fan of restaurant biscuits and gravy but I LOVE this recipe! The only thing I did to tweak this recipe was to use sweet basil italian sausauge in place of the bulk pork. This is a stick to your ribs favorite of my husband's as well :)

So good! I madThe gravy turned out amazing! e it with extra sausage and it turned out amazing. The biscuts didn't go very far, so we ended up using toast. I won't bother making the biscuts next time, just as soon use store bought. (unfortunately in France we don't seem to have any!)

I love biscuits and gravy, and although its a relatively easy thing to make, some places just can't get it right.  This is so good, just the right amount of pepper to be a crowd pleaser for the whole family.  The biscuits are perfect and so is the gravy...this is already in the recipe box and will be a regular Sunday breakfast favorite.  thanks!

I made this over the weekend and it was FANTASTIC!  I used 2 cups of milk as others suggested because I like more gravy than sausage.  Also, dont make the mistake i did and buy the sausage that comes in a log form.  I got links and I didnt get to break them up or crush them the way I should have.  But if you want a good biscuits and gravy recipe this is awesome!  will definately be making this again!  thanks for the recipe!

This was good, would almost like it better if it had a little more spice in it.  I added sage, but next time I think I will put a bit of cayenne pepper in it.

This is excellent!  I've used the gravy portion of this recipe many times, and it turns out tasting just like restaurant-style sausage gravy! :)  I do add a bit extra milk though.  Last time i was out of the tube biscuit dough, so i decided to try the biscuit portion of this recipe as well...and they turned out great!!!  The proportion of biscuits to gravy turned out pretty even (probably b/c we like thicker gravy).  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I give this 5 stars because it's pretty good, easy to make, and cheap to make. With some tweaking it will be perfect, I thought the biscuits were a little bland so next time I will add some seasonings to it. All in all a good recipe!

I quadrupled the biscuit recipe for our family of six, we did have a few left over. The biscuit recipe was great! The gravy recipe was average, I might alter the sausage to a turkey sausage and see if the flavor improves to my taste. It was too greasy.

This is an excellent recipe. So good, in fact, that my husband has declared it as "awesome" and "his favorite dish by me." I follow the recipe exactly for the biscuits but with the gravy, I used the 1/2 lb of sausage but I double everything else because we like alot of gravy but not so meaty. I also love this recipe because I always have all of the ingredients on hand except for the sausage so it is really a cheap and filling meal to fix when money's a little tight.

I had biscuits in the freezer so I did not have a chance to try the biscuit recipe but the gravy was really good.  Next time I will make the biscuits from this recipe since the gravy was so good.  This is very easy to make.

Easy to make, filling, flavorful.  I used an Italian sausage that was a little spicy and it added a nice zing to the recipe.  The biscuits were super easy to make and tasted better than I thought they would!

Really good--I made no changes from the gravy recipe and it was good.  I don't think it was unique otherwise I would have given it a five.  Just a good comfort food recipe.  I'd make it again.

I multiplied this recipe by 3 and by doing so gave fed 4 generously.  I only made the gravy portion and used Pillsbury biscuits to save time.  The only change I made to the gravy recipe was that I used pre-cooked sausage links because I was out of fresh sausage.  Because of that, I added an extra tablespoon of butter because the fresh sausage would have created more fat drippings.  Anyway, it was delicious!!!  My husband said it was the best biscuits and gravy he's ever had and would enjoy it any time!  It was so easy to make too, I will enjoy making this again and again!

This was a great quick recipe for sausage gravy!   I followed your recipe exactly.  I didn't make the biscuits, just the gravy.  It was ready in no time and my husband and daughter just loved it!  Will definitely keep making!  Thanks so much!!!!

I made this recipe knowing the biscuits would be chewy because there's hardly any fat in them.  They did indeed turn out chewy, but really weren't bad. I added more salt to both the biscuits and the gravy, and used soy sausage because I don't like the normal kind.  All in all, this was pretty good and I'll probably make it on a regular basis because we love biscuits and gravy but the normal kind is pretty high in fat and calories.  I'll try serving the biscuits on their own too.

We made this recipe today and it was excellent.  I like the idea you can make the biscuits from items from home. We needed to add more salt for our taste.

I've made this maybe 10 times now, and I love it!  I double the biscuit recipe, as others suggest.  I also use bacon instead of sausage (I prefer bacon gravy).  The last time I made these, I used soy milk instead of regular milk because it's all I had on hand, and it came out wonderfully -- the gravy was a little lighter than normal, which I really enjoyed.

These are amazing. I didn't have the Sausage, but adding a little paprika and some garlic was a great substitute. This is a great low cost filler upper.

Made this for dinner last night, and all I can say is WOW, absolutely amazing!!! I followed the recipe exact, except I used bacon grease in place of butter for the gravy,and I would have to agree, a little heavy on the sausage, which I will either omit or cut back on next time, but the flavor is outstanding and the biscuits were perfect!! This recipe is a keeper, thank you for sharing it!

I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this was...We had venison sausage to use and this was a great recipe to balance the spices added by the butcher.  My husband told me to add to the regular rotation.

Very good and easy! I did not make the biscuits though b/c I use Bisquick. The only thing is I would use a little bit more milk and flour. There was not enough of the gravy but lots of sausage. I used whole wheat flour and it tasted great!

If I would have known it was so easy to make great biscuits & gravy at home, I would have done so a long time ago!  These were very good and quick to make.  The only changes I'd make next time would be to use 2 cups of milk in the gravy since it ended up just a little too thick for me.  I'd also make sure to use freshly ground black pepper for extra flavor.

This had a great flavor. I used italian flavored sausage and it had a great flavor. I found the gravy a little thick so I used about 1/4 cup extra of milk. I didn't make my own biscuits I used the pilsbury brand and it still turned out awesome!

Very easy and tasty. I doubled the gravy recipe and quadrupled the biscuit portion to feed my family, though.

We have made these a few times now and we love them. We have made the biscuits but have found that we like them our own better. The gravy on the other hand is wonderful. We have used different flavors of sausage and it comes out yummy evry time. Our favoirte is habanero sausage..omg so good. It has become a staple in our home. Thanks so much!

Fabulous recipe! My husband and I both love biscuits and gravy, and this is one of the best we've ever had! Restaurant quality!  I used 2 cups milk for the gravy, like some others suggested. Love it! This will become a weekend tradition for our family!

Holy toledo! I'm not much of a cook, but  I'm glad I talked my family into letting me try this recipe. I doubled the entire recipe to yield 8 servings. 1 lb of meat was a bit much, but it was tasty all the same. Next time I'm going to use maybe 1/4 to 1/2 lb of meat or forgo the meat altogether. And I think I'll make the biscuits a bit bigger.

Great, easy recipe.  I put the biscuits in a cupcake pan and overcooked them while waiting for them to turn golden brown but they still tasted pretty good. I doubled the biscuit recipe and made 9 good sized biscuits and kept the gravy at 4 servings.  Was enough for two big appetites and two small ones.  I did use 2 cups of milk in the gravy and a bit more butter in the biscuits.  Def a keeper!

Absolutely love these biscuits and gravy.  My husband said they are better or as good as any he got when he lived in the south.  So simple.  I use reduced fat breakfast sausage and still came out great.  Will make this recipe for many years to come.

My family loves biscuits & gravy but I've never actually made it. This was my first attempt. All in All it was great. I did have to add more milk to the gravy, which may have been my fault. My family gobbled it up. I will have to play to get this just right. The sausage I used made no grease and I think that was most of the prob. But will make again. I was a little worried that the biscuits wouldn't turn out right since I live at a high altitude, but they were perfect.

I LOVED this because everything i needed was already right in my house! My boyfriend and I moved to Kentucky a year ago, so obviously cravings for "home cooking" have surfaced from time to time.  Recently I had been craving biscuits and sausage gravy for weeks, so I booted up and found this recipe because I didn't want to roll out "timely" biscuits! IT WAS PERFECT. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a quarter cup milk to the gravy recipe, and doubled the biscuit recipe and it couldn't have worked out better! Will definitely use again and again!

gravy is great, I wish I had used canned biscuits though.  My biscuits weren't great, not sure if that was my fault or the recipe.  Probably operator error.  :)  Gravy is great though and very easy.

The gravy is AWESOME!! My boyfriend and I don't like sausage in the gravy (which is why I don't order this in the restaraunts), so I made it without it. It was still WONDERFUL!! I didn't have time to make these biscuits, so I used Bisquick instead and the whole dish still was GREAT!! I will definately make this dish again and again and use the gravy for other dishes as well. Thanks for the recipe!!

I'm giving this a 5-star rating even though I've never made the gravy - just the biscuits. They are so good. Add a bit of sugar to make good biscuits for Strawberry Shortcake. Mmmm...

YUMMY!!!! I used the bicuits out of the can, simply cause it was in my fridge. But the gravy was terrific!! I used spicy ground sausage since i was making it for dinner, and it gave it that lil extra kick! I made it just last night and my boyfriend is already asking when I'm planning on making it again! Thanks for sharing=)

The first time I used this recipe, the gravy came out perfect but the biscuits were hard as rocks! I guess making biscuits from scratch just isn't my bag. I can't say enough about this gravy though, it always comes out perfect and delicious. I'll stick to biscuits from a can. Thank you for the gravy!

i am a first time cook, and this was too easy! the biscuits came out looking a little funny to me becuase i was expecting a canned pillsbury biscuit look. also the dough from the bread was hard to scoop onto the baking tray, it seemed it needed to be thicker. could have been my fault/inexperience. regardless, it was fast, easy, and delicious~

This was a delicious dinner! I had to feed myself and about 6 men/teen boys and needed to come up with something pretty quick and one of the boys came on here and found this recipe so I tried it and was I glad! But I quatrupled the biscuit recipe and doubled the gravy recipe. That made 24 biscuits and a large cast iron pan of gravy, along with a green vegetable, it made a hearty filling meal for all. The gravy was perfect except for needing a lot more black pepper. The biscuits were so good, it was a shock because it's really the easiest biscuit recipe I have seen! Thank you!

Awesomeness.  I had this once in Kentucky.  I made it without the sausage because i didn't have any.  Turned out great.  Probably less pepper next time unless i use the sausage.

My husband had a craving for biscuits and gravy last night so I made these this morning - they were really good and so easy!  And, other than the sausage, all ingredients are pretty much things you'll have on hand anyways.  These were a hit!

I thought for sure I was going to screw something up here.  I'm quite the amateur cook and this sounded just a tad too complex for me, but it turns out it really wasn't.  The biscuits were downright perfect, and the gravy was great as well.  This one's definitely a keeper!

This is, by far the best and easiest biscuits and gravy recipe I've ever tried!  Next time I will make a bit more gravy.  I will be making this a lot on weekends.  I have a party this weekend and will be making a big breakfast on Sunday for a crowd and this will be part of the menu for sure!!!  Thanks for such an easy and yummy recipe!!

This recipe is Fantastic!  The biscuits turn out fluffy inside and crispy but not hard ..outside!  I goofed and added too much baking soda..(error) but it worked great!!   Its an infailable ..durable recipe! That tastes great..works well especially with "pork gravy". or any other gravys! I appreciate your submission..It worked for me in a pinch..and I will use again!!  (family loves it!) Suzy

Super simple.  I raised the servings to 6 for the gravy to account for the 12 oz of sausage I had on hand and it turned out to be the perfect amount to cover the original biscuit amount.

Yumm! I was just looking for a gravy recipe b/c I have store bought biscuits, but I decided to try them both.  Especially since the store-bought ones are $2.50 a bag these days!  I thought it was a good meal--I don't know that I would eat the biscuits without gravy or lots of butter & jelly.  But overall not bad.  I doubled everything for my family of 4.  It seems we have lots of biscuits leftover compared to the gravy.

I only did the gravy because we had already bought some biscuits.  AMAZING!  I finally got the taste I wanted with the smooth creamy gravy texture.  Thanks!

Really good gravy, buscuits need a master buscuit maker to not make too hard or dry. I'm partial to butermilk buscuits, however, and it's like comparing apples to bananas.  fast, easy and delicous

My husband and I had traveled to VA. for a cheering tournament to watch our niece compete in and we stayed at a hotel where they made the biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  My husband loved them so when we got home and went right to this site to look for a recipe.  I found this one and I tried it!  It was awesome.  I used Jimmy Dean sausage and doubled the gravy mixture.  Will definitely add to my rotation list.  Yummy......

I looked up this recipe in an effort to satisfy my husband's love for biscuits and gravy...and he loved it, and so did I..and Im not a big biscuit and gravy gal. I did modify it a bit though-I doubled the biscuit recipe (just wasnt enough for 3 of us)and I added in about 1/2-1 C extra milk to make it more gravy-ish. I added in some ground white pepper, and I used Jimmy Deans hot sausage...which I think added a great kick that my family appreciates. It had a bite, but my 3 year old liked it so wasn't too bad (at least for him). Will definitely keep this recipe for our weekly biscuit and gravy mornings :-)

I bake the biscuit dough in an 8" square pan and cut into 6 or 9 pieces, depending on "who" is eating. It still turns out light and fluffy. I also make a similair sausage gravy but use the hot or spicy sausage. It's a family favorite.

The gravy was great, my family really enjoyed eating this for breakfast, then more at dinner. The biscuits were pretty ugly but they still tasted good.

I didn't have any country gravy sauce for my biscuits, so used this recipe. It was great! I doubled the portion size, which is sufficient for 4 people. Instead of using sausage. I cooked about 10 pieces of turkey bacon (less fat) and then tour them into pieces, adding them to the gravy. I also used the bacon grease to add to gravy. Came out perfect. I would recommend using less pepper than what it calls for, it's bit too spicy for kids.

Great gravy . . . but double it up if you are feeding more than 3 people.  I stretched it for 3 people.  I didn't make the biscuits since there were mixed reviews, so I have no comment on them!

Very very good. I have not liked biscuits and gravy in the past, but these are something I constantly crave now. For those who would like to make it a *bit* healthier, I would make the following suggestions: use 100% whole wheat unbleached flour (which actually made it taste better, I thought) and turkey (or better yet, soy) sausage instead of pork or beef. Also note that when using unbleached whole wheat flour, you will need to add an extra tablespoon or two of milk since it absorbs more liquid than bleached flour.

I give it 5 stars for the gravy, but not the biscuits.  I thought the biscuits were dense and rubbery.  For myself, my husband and my son, I double the recipe and don't have much leftovers.  It is pretty meaty.  Next time I am going to use 1 lb sausage, and multiply the rest of the gravy ingredients by 4 so that the gravy is not so meaty, and so that we have leftovers.

Great recipe.  I like this recipe better than my current one. I have used half hot and half mild (or reg) sausage.  I have also used buttermilk "grands" - the biscuits in a can when in a pinch.  Either way - both parts of this recipe are good!

Gravy was great.  Fried link sausage and crumbled instead of bulk, work just as well.  Did not make the biscuits recipe, used another.  The recipe I used for biscuits did not turn out, will try the biscuit next time.

I made this tonight because I had such a craving for some Biscuits and gravy. 
Made it for myself and my family. My mother's friend (who's from the south) said it came out great, that I did good. 

So I do recommend this. However, like a poster above I added 2 c. of milk with slightly more flour, came out great.

I was hoping this recipe would solve my pregnancy craving and while it fed me (and baby) it didn't exactly satisfy.  The biscuits were fairly bland and very hard on the outside, I think 450 is too high a temperature to cook at.  The gravy was okay I think I'd add a touch more salt though.  Thanks, but I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

I made the gravy without the sausage, because I didn't have any.  Because of that I added more pepper, and a fair amount of salt.  I made the accompanying biscuits without any intentional alterations.  While this did satisfy my craving for biscuits and gravy, I think I might have overcooked the biscuits, as they ended up a little tough on the underside.  The error probably lies with me, and this was a very yummy dish that I will make again.

This recipe is as easy as it gets! Great taste, and simple! The only thing that I do differently is use Jimmy Deans spicy sausage instead of regular -- it adds a ton of flavor. Awesome recipe, just like mom's :)

Yes, the biscuits are a bit boring, but so easy, cheap, and a perfect counterbalance to the gravy!
I used chicken sausage and skim milk to cut down on calories, but it was still remarkably decadent.  Some cayenne and a pinch of nutmeg for my personal twist and voila--a rich meal for mere pennies.

this is a great recipe.

i use bacon.  instead of butter and salt i save a little of the bacon grease for the gravy.  

i also feed a lot of people so i doubled the recipe.  

very good!

Update: My original review is below. I decided to give the biscuits another go as it was suggested that I over mixed them. I wish I would have just stuck to my original review of them. I did not over mix these, but yet again they were horrible. Same as last time. The gravy was again superb. Also, the biscuit to gravy ratio is off. Double the biscuits and you should be fine. I got 6 very tiny biscuits and loads of gravy. 

I wish I could rate the biscuits and gravy separately. The gravy was superb. I made it as is and it tasted delicious. Definitely will do again. 
The biscuits, however, were not that great. I'm from the South and biscuits are supposed to be light and fluffy. These were dense and chewy.

I made the biscuits from this recipe with my grandchildren, and  turned out beautifully. The 6 year old was able to put it all together and drop the biscuits. We used the biscuits with strawberries for heathy strawberry shortcake.

I have never made biscuits and gravy before, but my husband loves them. I left the sausage out of this and added some creole seasoning to give it a little kick. My husband absolutely loved it!

This is the best recipe for sausage gravy that I've found on this site so far.  I did make a few changes:  I used Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage, cooked it in bacon grease with some Portuguese Sausage, then added a dash of garlic salt and cayenne pepper at the end. The biscuits were pretty good but in the future I'll stick to my favorite buttery biscuits recipe.  The gravy was very easy to make.  It's a keeper!

I have tried many recipes and this one turned out the best and tastiest. Only one suggestion. There was too much sausage, I would either make more of the gravy or use less sausage. It is a keeper!

Soooooo easy to make! I'm a mom, a student, and I work a full time job and I've still been able to find the time to make my family this at least 3x a week! The gravy is so amazing, you can eat it by itself. 2 thumbs up. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very delicious!  It tasted just like my grandma's.  The only thing I did was cut back on the sausage, but that's simply preference.  My daughter loved it too and I enjoyed the left overs the next day.

I loved these biscuits. They were gone in maybe 2 minutes. Used a little extra flour to make it fluffier. You should make twice as many servings than you need because they are good.

Substituted pork sausage with MorningStar Farms Vegetarian Sausage.  Worked like a champ.  I am currently trying a few things to give the veggie version a more robust flavor, but this recipe is a good place to start.

I only made the drop biscuit part of this recipe.  I'd give them a 5 for ease of prep and ingredients were already on hand but only a 3 for taste.  Mine were tough (overmixed?) and quite small.  I served them with creamed chicken, though, and they were fine.  Cheaper than Pillsbury!

I didn't make the biscuits but the gravy was really good. I cheated and made biscuits from a can.  I did saute some onions with the sausage. If you like sauted oinions I would suggest you try adding them. I would make this again.

My husband and I are living in the UK and have missed Biscuits and Gravy so much! This recipe is superb.

If you're running low on sausage replace with a cube of boullion for flavor. Tastes just as great!

Perfect!  I was looking for something that would be quick and delicious.  I needed to be able to see both the biscuit and the gravy recipe.  The only sausage available to be doesn't give off a lot of grease, and this recipe depended on butter to help make the gravy.  It was perfect.  I did reduce the amount of sausage to have a more gravy-like gravy.  My husband said this was "the best homemade biscuits and gravy" he has ever had.  That is saying something!

I didn't make the gravy but the recipes is similar to one I do make and it's great:) The biscuits were easy and yummy! I loved that you didn't have to cut in shortening, a task I just dislike.

I made this last night and my family loved it.  The only thing they suggested was to cut the sausage amount down a little bit since it is a very meaty gravy which they don't care too much for.  Other than that one request from them they gave it a thumbs up!
