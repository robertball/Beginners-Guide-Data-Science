I live in Chicago & eat Chicago dogs all the time. Don't worry about not finding the sport peppers if you are in a different area, I think most people pick them off anyways cause they are spicy.
Also, most hot dog stands here use Vienna hot dogs that should be in stores. They have a nice skin with a snap. They make for the best hot dogs.

Born and raised in the shadows of Wrigley Field many decades ago, I can tell this is the correct and appropriate Chicago-style hot dog recipe. A couple of notes:  when you are in the city and ordering a "dog", when they ask "what would you like on that?", it is appropriate to say "hey, drag that dog through the garden, would you?".  As far as cucumber versus dill spear, this depends on the neighborhood.  So if you always ordered at the same dog stand, you might not realize the stand about 20 miles away uses celery salt and a dill pickle.  My suggestion:  Try them wherever you go.  Oh, and my thanks to Rachel Ray - the best thing for low-carb diets...the Chicago Style Hot Dog salad.  I had these for a week when my husband was on a business trip, and I actually lost more than 5 pounds.  Thanks Vienna Beef (hey, I think their outlet store is still on Damen Ave.  Seconds are excellent!)

Ahhhh sweet home Chicago; one of the reasons I love this city. This is the ONLY way to eat a hot dog around here. And do not, do NOT ask for ketchup, ever! For those of you having trouble finding sport peppers, they're sold by other jarred pickle/pepper products. They range from a light to dark green, and are about the size of your pinkie. They CAN be spicy, depending on your spice tolerance, check out viennabeef.com and click on products until you find the sport peppers. It is true most people (aka tourists) pick them off anyways! But to each their own; you haven't experienced Chicago until you've had a true Chicago style hot dog!

This "recipe" doesn't cut new ground, but if you're not in Chicago this is nice to have as a guideline for the required ingredients to assemble a Chicago Hot Dog properly at home.

These made our Super Bowl party complete!  My husband is a Bears fan, so I wanted to have Chicago dogs for him and his friends, and they were a huge hit!!  No one has ever heard of "sport peppers" in my area, but after some research, I found that Poblano peppers are pretty close, so that's what we used.  Poppy seed hot dog buns are not available in my area, so I steamed regular buns and while they were still moist, rolled them in loose poppy seeds.  These dogs were sooo good that we've now implemented them into our NASCAR get-togethers!  Thanks so much!

I hate hotdogs. Except for my beloved Gold Coast Dogs in Chicago. I lived there for years and had them for lunch, often. Then, we moved to Michigan. No more Gold Coast Dogs. So I searched and found this recipe. 100% perfect!! Just be sure to use an all  beef Kosher type dog, rather than a small mix hotdog. There are times that a turkey-dog won't cut it and this is one of them.

Chicago Dogs are a childhood favorite of mine since my family owned a restaurant that specialized in Vienna Beef Hot Dogs.  They aren't a Chicago Dog without the celery salt and pepperocini peppers have the perfect flavor to top the dogs.  Of course, they really aren't a hot dog, but a GOURMET hot dog...Enjoy!

Not being a pickle or pepper fanatic, I like mine with cucumber wedges instead of the pickles and peppers. For the record, I got a dog this way from a pushcart in Chicago.

My hubby and I now own a Chicago themed restaurant in Omaha - Papa Chris' Chicago Originals - and we know how to make a dog! He's a 26 year native of the city. You really need a Vienna Beef frank to make it taste authentic but in a pinch use the highest quality National brand you can find at the supermarket. I recommend using Roma tomatoes -less juice - and slicing your tomato into at least 8 wedges for easier eating. This is a big bite kind of food. Also, mince your onions, nicer to eat than big chunks. If you don't own a steamer basket, you can nuke your bun in a plastic bag for 15-20 seconds and it will be soft and steamy. Sport peppers are NOT pepperoncini as someone reviewed but if you can't find the real thing, any small pickled pepper will do. If your new to Chicago dogs, this is the best way you will ever eat a hot dog! Remember, ketchup is only for fries, NOT Chicago dogs! Happy eating!

A definate classic. You NEED the sport peppers, and the buns haee to be steamed. I tend to overdo it with the celery salt.

You nailed it.  This is a Chicago dog, the only city in the world where a hotdog is an acceptable meal for an adult.  My only concern is that the drink pairing is Reisling or Lemonade (don't know if these are user generated or what)...  The ONLY thing to drink with a Chicago dog is a ice cold DOMESTIC beer, or if looking for that sporting event feel a luke warm beer in a plastic cup that you paid $8 for and half spilled out by the time the people next to you passed it to you.

Holy mother of hotdog! These were excellent. A bit different, and a lot more kick than a standard dog, which is quite alright by me. I did use pepperoncini peppers, as I haven't seen 'sports' peppers before. I made Mike's Signature Pretzel Bread into hotdog buns for these, and was not disappointed. Great pairing. Thanks. :)

Made this last night with only a slight change, we grilled the beef dog on charcoal grill instead of boiling them. I couldn't find poppy seed hot dog buns so instead I brushed olive oil slightly on top of the bun and added my own poppy seeds, then warmed them on the grill. Added all the toppings just as stated, used jalapenos instead of sports peppers, since that is what I had in stock and prefer. After everything was on my dog I covered plate with a plastic cover and nuked for just a min and half in microwave and this made the bun like it was steamed. Very good dog and once in awhile you just gotta have a good hot dog.

I love a Chicago style dog, but to me it's not a Chicago dog without a Vienna wiener. People that are saying this isn't good are probably using a mushy, bland Ball Park or Oscar Meyer beef frank, which doesn't make the grade. Those are fine if you are going to bury them in chili, cheese and onions, but the star of a Chicago dog ~is~ the dog! and all the other ingredients balance out the flavor spectrum by giving you sweet, hot, salty and sour. Now that is street gourmet perfection!!

Try the sport peppers even if you don't normally like spicy.  I steam my buns by putting a splatter screen over the sauce pan while cooking the dogs.  And I always add celery salt.

These are the best!  What a great idea to share a recipe like this.  For those who are looking for sport peppers, try an Italian deli, you might have luck there.  As many have mentioned, the hotdogs are Vienna Beef and the poppy seed buns are S. Rosen's Mary Ann Poppy Hotdog Bun.  Vienna Beef has a store on their website and you can buy a Chicago Hot Dog kit there. Thanks to redhotcook for posting this!

I'm from Chicago. I served these (using Hebrew National franks as Vienna are not available in VA) while watching the Bears game on 1/16/11. Bears won to advance to NFC championship game. Was it the CS hot dogs that brought some luck to the outcome? Not sure but it sure didn't hurt. This recipe is the real deal! Followed the recipe to the T (T formation, Bears, get it?) but used pepperoncini's. We all raved about how awesome/authentic these dogs are. Go Bears, Go Cubs!!!

Was fine without the sport peppers. Make sure to splurge on the poppy seed buns and you HAVE to have the celery salt, and an all beef hot dog such as vienna, klements, or hebrew national.

Omg! Thank You!  Perfect recipe!  My father's family is from Chicago and I remember going as a kid and having everyone freak when I asked for only ketchup on a hot dog in a hot dog joint there (I was only 10)  When I was in college everyday my dad would bring me to get Chicago style hot dogs at a place in Houston and I fell in love!  What was I thinking when I was a kid?  Well now I make these in South America! The people here don't know what hit them!

As a lifelong resident of the Chicago area, I can honestly say that THIS is the ONLY version of a true Chicago Style Hot Dog. There are NO variations. Grilling the dogs, baking the buns, pepperoncini instead of sport peppers are all variations; nothing can be substituted and still be considered Chicago Style. VIENNA  Dogs are boiled (Or steamed), buns always steamed, poppyseed buns are the only way. When I make these at home, I put the onions on the bun before the hot dog, that keeps them from falling off when I eat them. Great recipe, try them for dinner!!

I had never had this style of hot dog before I tried this recipe....so I was skeptical.  But now, I'm a fan!  We loved them!  Next time we'll buy hotter sport peppers.  We chose mild.  Wished it was a little warmer.  Followed recipe to a tee.  Delicious!

I'm not from Chicago, and I've honestly never been there, but I've eaten a lot of Chicago dogs. I thank my grandpa for this since he fell in love with them after spending a couple months in the Windy City. It's the only way I'll eat a hot dog anymore! Couldn't find the sports peppers. :( I had to go without, which would make my grandpa's head spin if he found that out!  Veeeeeerrrrry delicious, I will be using this recipe all the time!

Made exactly to specifications, these are so great! Now that I have family in Chicago, I get gifted with sport peppers and that fluorescent green relish. If I only had a local source for the poppy seed buns.

The Chicago dog is tough to beat as far as tasty and delicious "comfort food" is concerned. We have our own version of this classic that is little more decadent. The hot dogs get boiled in beer and the buns are steamed in the beer steam. The only other differences are that we add chopped tomatoes and sprinkle with chopped grated cheddar cheese. Then we might load on the optional chopped jalapeno peppers. The wife being a non-purist also adds mayo and ketchup in addition to everything else, so this would not quality as a pure Chicago dog, but it is a tasty variation.

Since my wife and I are vegan, I made a vegan version of this. I didn't try to be exact, but as close as possible while staying within my ethical and (wimpy) hotness tolerance bounds. The only veggie hot dog I like a lot is Loma Linda, but theiy're not in my close-by grocerices, so I used Field Roast Italian sausage (very good), which I grilled. I used an Anaheim pepper, that's about as hot as I can take. Aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was great; my wife loved it, too. With some cole slaw, corn, and baked beans on the side, this was a wonderful pre-Memorial day barbecue feast.

I spent my entire life in Chicago and this recipe is missing one key ingredient - Cucumber slices.  Chicago dogs have cucumber slices... ALWAYS.  In fact, sport peppers are optional.  Just a head's up for those of you who want to be authentic!!!

These are amazing! I used Nathan's hot dogs, which were perfect for these! Also, depending on the area you live in, poppy seed buns can be hard to find. I made my own: I just brushed some melted butter on plain hot dog buns, sprinkled poppy seeds on them, and toasted them in the oven for about 5 minutes. They turned out perfect! I also used mild sliced pepperoncinis, and they were wonderful on it. These dogs are the best when every ingredient is there, so don't be afraid to try it!

I've always wanted to try a Chicago-style hot dog, but instead of boiling the hot dog, my husband wanted to grill them.  Also, you can't find poppyseed buns at our hometown grocery store.  But we followed the rest of the recipe, and they were terrific.

Made me love hot dogs! These have become my favorite late-night guilty pleasure.

I can't find sport peppers or poppyseed buns locally and I don't want to pay to have them shipped. I've taken the advice of other reviewers and am rolling my steamed buns in poppy seeds. Since they don't stick all that well, I also sprinkle some inside the bun.

For the peppers, I'm cutting up pickled hot peppers. If you are a Southerner like me, what I'm using are the same Tabasco type peppers we bottle in vinegar to make pepper sauce for greens.  I can't compare, but I sure like my results.

I never would have thought to put celery salt on a hot dog, but I love this added flavor. To make it easier to eat, I'm chopping everything up more than the recipe calls for and then sprinkling it all with the celery salt.

Finally, I'm taking an easy and quick shortcut by steaming both the hot dog and the bun, separately, of course, in the microwave. It's faster and easier than boiling and steaming on the stove. To do this, I just wrap them in wet paper towels and put them in the microwave.

These were a hit in our house!  I've never had a real Chicago dog before so I can't compare them to anything else.  I just had to substitute the sport peppers with tiny tobasco peppers from a jar.  Really really good.  Thank you for sharing

"Sport" Peppers are another name for pepperoncini peppers! You can substitute mild pickled wax peppers or jalepenos, depending on the amount of heat you like!

The way a dog should be served!    @Big Ugly Mich...there are no push carts in Chicago.  Not Chicago proper anyways.  But nothing wrong with how you ordered it. (where ever you got it) At least you didn't add ketchup.

I was looking for a recipe to add a bit of KICK to the ordinary hot dog...because that is what I had on hand.  Boy, did I!  This was it.  I'm your everyday mustard, ketchup, relish on a dog kinda girl, so this was a stretch. This was pretty darn (wanting to use another word) GOOD! My husband referenced the meal many times that evening saying how surprisingly good it was!  The best thing? The cost!

I leave this rating not because it was bad, but because it is well.... i don't even know. I would make them again. I can see maybe once a year or so. Dogs come in so many varieties subject to culture and geography. Just look at this and Martinsville, VA. as contrasts. I guess I can simply say as far as "Dawgs" go.. I am just glad to be from the South.

The "real deal" Chicago dog uses a Vienna Beef frank, STEAMED not boiled, a steamed poppy seed bun, neon green relish, and whole sport peppers. I gave four stars because of the advice to boil the franks. The Vienna Beef franks have a natural casing that has just the right amount of "snap" to it when you bite in! The buns need to be steamed so that they are just almost mushy and soft. Plenty of mustard on TOP of the frank, not on the bun, a spear of pickle, and plenty of onions and relish make this dog incredible. Finally, slices of tomatoes are a requirement. Don't mess around with perfection - the good people of Chicago figured out the perfect dog!

Absolutely must have a poppy seed bun.  They are not available anywhere but in Chicago but the one suggestion of steaming a regular hot dog bun and then rolling it in poppy seeds was a GREAT idea and really works.  Absolutely NO ketchup, and be sure and add the tomatoes and celery salt.  The BEST hot dogs ever!

Chicago hot dogs are the best, BUT this picture is wrong. Yellow peppers do not substitute for a sport pepper in Chicago. The flavor and texture is completely different. And to respond to the reviewer who said most people take them off, not true! A Chicago hot dog is delicious with them and also very good without them, but they are not just a garnish like parsley next to a steak. They add a distinct flavor that is worth experiencing. I personally bite the end off the pepper and sprinkle the juice over my hot dog!

These are amazing! I haven't been a huge hot dog fan, but we've made these like 3 times in the last few weeks.  We add pepperoni on ours also, might not be officially "chicago-style" but we think it's yummy.

I LOVE this recipe!  I made it for my dad and my uncle and it was a huge hit!  I didn't use sport peppers though, I used pepperoncinis, but other than that, very successful!

I was gifted some real Chicago style relish for Christmas and love making these.  The fresh tomato is so tasty, and the sweet/salty combo of dill pickle and sweet relish is great.  I subbed banana peppers for the sport peppers.  If you ignore the sodium, it's a pretty healthy way to eat hot dogs!  They are delicious.

I am not a big hotdog fan. But, when I do eat them I really like them this way. I don't know what a sport pepper is and I don't add the relish. But, the mustard, dill pickle spear, and tomato are a must! It is a really great combination for a hotdog. And, if using a good soft bun, I just stick mine in the microwave for 10 seconds for ease. It has always worked for me.

That is the only way to make a Chicago hot dog. I was born there and can remember eating them from corner vendors. One thing people forget is we always had a dog and bunch tamales.  Vienna dogs the best. Don't change a thing. JUDY

My husband started traveling to Ch. about a year ago would come home raving about these dogs. Thanks for the recipe. Couldn't find sports peppers here, but he brought some home recently. I'm a vegetarian but when i make for him i have all but dog and i enjoy it. Oh i also haven't been able to find poppy seed buns.

delish! perfect especially if you have all the stuff on hand. I wasn't sure what sports peppers were so I used sliced banana peppers. I melted some butter and sprinkled some poppy seed in then rubbed my hot dog bun in it and toasted it in the oven for a couple min. Worked just fine for me. Fun way to eat a hot dog!!

OF COURSE, there are tomatoes on Chicago Dogs.  Ketchup, no.  Tomatoes, yes.  Until recent retirement to Tucson, the husband and I are life-long Chicagoans, and my brother has owned a pizza place and a hot dog stand in Chicago.  Definitely, TOMATOES!!!!!

Chicago dogs are OFF THE HOOK! 

I agree with some previous comments. The picture shows the wrong pepper and you must have the unnatural nuclear green relish. :)

That being sad I'm sure there are thousands of delicious variations.

ENJOY!

I had a layover in Chicago on my way to Tacoma and was very hungry.  I was going to chose McDonald's but saw a hot dog stand instead. I am from the South so I have never seen one except on TV.  So I decided to try it and asked for ketchup and mustard.....needless to say, I didn't get that, but I did get a "where are you from???"  The gentleman made me a "Chicago Style" hot-dog and I have not had ketchup on a hot dog in the last 3 years. It's the best!! No one comes close!  I make mine exactly like this recipe....minus the peppers, lol!

I'm born and raised in Chicago and in my 75 years I've eaten more Chicago Style hot dogs than I can remember.  Your recipe is right on.  If you want it to be perfect, use Vienna Beef hot dogs.  One bite and you'll think you're in Wrigleyville!  (that's what they serve).  Someone wrote in and said to use Kosher hot dogs. Ugh!  They are obviously not from Chicago.

OMG! I have lived in Chicago for 60 years, and This Is It! We have traveled around the country and have found "Chicago Style Hot Dogs" in many places with Ketchup, Mustard and Relish. What are they thinking? It's not really that hard

Being born and raised in Chi-Town I can say that finally someone has gotten the chicago style dog recipe correct. I suggest having an ice cold old style and watching the cubs or bears to round out and make it a complete chicago meal.

Truly delicious!  I couldn't find poppy-seed buns or "sport" peppers so had to use regular buns and pepperoncini, but the dogs were still awesome!  All of the toppings and the celery salt just make it great!

There is NO other way to eat a hot dog. We always use Vienna beef dogs. And no ketchup, never ever never!  In my opinion, if you visit Chicago you must eat an Italian beef from Taylor Street, deep dish pizza from Giordanos, Garrett popcorn and a Chicago Style Hot Dog. With this recipe, you can bring a bit of Chicago to you if visiting is not possible. Do be sure to use the poppy seed bun, it won't be the same without it.

The only bad thing about this recipe is that the dog needs to be Vienna Beef. True Chicago has a topping style but a Chicago dog is the brand Vienna Beef- not just any beef dog. Also, never grill a Chicago dog save that for the east coast. :)

I love hot dogs like this. I first had them on the Navy Pier while visiting Chicago. I can't get some of the ingrediants near me. Like sport peppers and poppy seed hot dog buns. I've tried other things, but they never quite match the great flavor of this recipe.

Good dogs! Can't find poppy seed buns here in Central CA. Use French bagget type breads cut to size. They're better suited to standing up to all the "stuff". Not much on sweet relish. Peppers in question... I dunno. We use pepperonccini peppers. Also some kind of good cheese and maybe... chili!!!

We used Hebrew National Beef hot dogs, the flavor was delicious! I looked all over Fargo, ND for the Vienna Beef, but struck out.  Also, I had to put in a special order for the poppy seed buns at a "real" bakery.  Worth the one day delay! Everyone enjoyed them! Thanks for all of the advice with substitutions in the reviews.

We love making these! I always serve the ingredients chopped up in bowls so each person can 'dress' their own dog to their liking. (of course, best is made as-written, but not everyone in the family likes all the ingredients) I can't find sport peppers locally so I chop up some good pepperoncini peppers and they work well.

I lived in Chicago for a year and I was BROKE! One of the few things I could afford when I wanted to treat myself was a Chicago dog and fries. Talk about bang for your buck! This recipe looks perfect! Thanks for submitting--I hadn't known that the secret to the soft bun was steaming it!

Vienna hot dogs are a must.  They are the only one's that give you the true taste. Steamed buns and the celery salt make them just like home.

AMEN to all the reviews and I want to ditto by saying that the dog is so much better (and most original) when it snaps!  You ain't never tasted a dog til you tasted a Chicago dog!

This is how we've always made them for this Chicago-suburb gal's family. As a military family, I get lots of reactions to some of these toppings, but this is how they should be eaten!

Best hot dog I've ever had. I can never go back to a plain ole dog after tonight.    I used pepperocini peppers, not sure if they are "sport peppers" but it was still delicious. I followed the recipe to a T. I think one thing we often overlook, which adds a lot to a dog is actually steaming the buns. One easy way to do this without a steamer is to use a colander, put the dogs in a big pot with an inch of water, boil the dogs, drop the colander in the pot and use the pot lid to hold in the steam. Worked Great for me, you may have to remove some of the water to keep it from splashing up on the buns and check your fit BEFORE you drop your buns! The combonation of dill and tomato and celery salt adds a an awesome twist to this American icon. Don't put this off any longer. make it tonight!!

My husband said these were better than any other hot dog he ever had. I made them pre Father's Day. He actually ate 3 of them. I had 2 and I'm supposed to be on a diet. We had the Chicago Sport's Peppers already so that was great. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

My fave way to eat a hot dog...before it was just Ketchup/Mustard Onions...or maybe Onions and Sauerkraut.  Sheesh, what was I thinking?!  The Chicago dog is SO flavorful...and putting them together is really an Art more than a Science.  In my area, I've had problems locating Sport Peppers and Poppy Seed Buns...so to substitute, I use Sliced Pepperoncini's and Potato Bread Buns.  Don't know where to get Vienna Beef Dogs, but Boar's Head pinch hits just fine.

Just like you get at Vienna Beef!
For the record you can get an authentic Chicago-Style in Milwaukee @ Sammy's.  But making them at home is great, too.

Delicious! My recollection from 25 years of living in the Midwest is that Chicago dogs have a cucumber spear...but then again, my memory never was that great! This is great football fare. Set up a buffet and everyone can fix their own! Truth be told, you may need to set out the ketchup for the kiddies, but don't let anyone see YOU putting that red goo on YOUR Chicago dog!!!

I lived close enough to Chicago to enjoy a Chicago dog every now and again.  However this recipe is the closest I have ever come to that taste without a visit to ChiTown.  It is difficult to find poppy seed buns in the area I current live but when I do, I use this recipe to take me back.  Thank you.

I love Chicago dogs! The poppyseed bun is really good but hard-to-find. I can find sport peppers at a place called World Market. To me, the sport peppers and the celery salt is what makes the Chicago dog great.

This recipe is right on.  However, my hubby ate them across from Riverview Park some 70 years ago, and he insists they have to be Vienna Hotdogs, and that the "sport peppers" didn't exist then; it was pepperoncinis.  We never heard of sport peppers until this discussion.

I have avoided this as being "too messy to eat" but wish I hadn't waited so long.  I also wish I hadn't forgotten the celery salt because I was really trying to make as close to the recipe as possible...for me. I used another hot pepper because I couldn't find sport peppers and a veggie dog (as usual) since I don't eat hotdogs. I loved it. In my opinion the pickle wedge adds something that regular relish cannot.

This is the ONLY way to eat a hot dog. Remember NO ketchup. Not allowed in Chicago especially on your hot dog. This is one of the things I love about my old home place. I still have to have one every time I go back for a visit. YUM!!!!!

I was leary on trying this, as Im in Nebraska, and used to regular hotdogs or chili dogs. Had no idea about pickles, tomatoes, etc! But It was really good! Odd but everything accented each other! Didnt have the sport peppers so we ate without. Think this is how im going to be eating my dogs from now on!

You can get the relish, sport peppers, hot dogs, buns and more at http://www.viennabeef.com.  We try to stock up when back in Chicago but have also ordered so that they are made right.  They are a great social food!  Enjoy!

I made some minor alterations, due to my regional location (getting some of this stuff is hard!) but having lived in Chicago, I felt that with this recipe and my substitutions - it turned out well. I didn't have poppy seed buns nor did I have sport peppers. I also used red onions (I prefer them). It was a great meal - so great, in fact, we had it three times (Lunch, Dinner then Lunch again!)   Adding this to my list of favs, for sure!

We have what we call "Steamies" in Quebec all the time. This , however is MUCH better. I use Angus Beef franks and load it up with the condiments in the order stated - I bet it DOES affect the taste...

Just tasted these without the sport peppers and only had chicken wieners so definitely not authentic but was a very nice change from our boring Canadian hot-dogs ! Loved them and will try the authentic way next time. I did cheat and ended up adding ketchup .. couldn't resist !

Excellent!  I've used this recipe with all-beef hot dogs, bratwurst and mexican chorizo.  They all taste great in this style.

First Recipe I tried from this website and I absolutley loved it!  I did grill my bun and dog, and didnt have sports peppers, but never the less, was still an excellent tasting dog.  Nice crisp cool taste to it.  The wife took her first bite and goes "yeah its alright, tastes like a hot dog"  When she was done she said she wanted another one.  I go "thought it just tasted like a regular hot dog?" Her reply " Each bite after the first one got better and better" Good recipe

Yum!  Being from Ohio and having never traveled to Chicago, this was my first time having a Chicago-style dog.  Absolutely fantastic.  My daughter loves these and asks for them often.

I left out the celery salt because Hebrew National franks are salty enough and I only had hamburger buns, but this was still delicious!  Great flavors all together adding more veggies to a hot dog!  Definately no ketchup needed!

These were great, much better than a ketchup covered hotdog. I'm not familiar with sport peppers, but I used hot peppers and it was delicious. Celery salt is strong so go easy on it. I will definatly make these again!

The first time I got one of these wonderful Dogs was on Washington Island in Wisconsin at a little food stand and I ate 3 of them!  Everytime we go there I HAVE to stop and eat 3 of them!  We now make them at home after searching hard for some of the Ingredients!  I would not eat a Dog any other way!!!  We dont make them that often because I eat so many of them!  They are SOOOOOOOO GOOOOODDD! Dont feel bad if you eat a few like I do.  Just run an extra Mile tomorrow :)

I was born and raised in Illinois and remember Super Dogs as delicious.  Made these for a 4th of July picnic.  I couldn't find all the ingredients called for in Arkansas.  I had to substitute Hebrew National ¼ pound beef franks and hogie rolls.  The rolls were too stiff, but I can't hold the recipe at fault there.  All and all they were very good and got great reviews.  I did add sour kraut which I personally think make the dish.  I'll make these again soon!

Thumbs up all around on this one. Everyone loved these (even with the substitutions we had to make) I will be trying to track down the "correct" ingredients. Some recipes I found (other sites) called for cukes instead of pickles. I won't knock it till I've tried it that way too.

There's no tomato on a Chicago dog!!  Edited to say that I didn't know what I was thinking when I wrote this (as a long time Chicagoan)- maybe too many Chicago beers...what I meant was ketchup!!

I'm from Chicago also. This recipe is almost how I make them.  I was taught to steam the hot dogs for 5 minutes. Remove and place in bun 
return to steamer basket for 30 sec to 1 min. 
I live in the south now and do not have access to vienna beef dogs or sport peppers.  I settle for Nathan's hot dogs and pepperocini peppers. I also stock up on sport peppers when I visit or have visitors bring me some.

I consider myself a foodie, but sometimes I just want a junk food fix.  A Chicago dog hits the spot every time!  The sport peppers might be tough to find though.  I had to go to three stores--none at Kroger or Walmart, but found them near the olives at Marsh.

Really liked this recipe.  Somehow I missed getting a Chicago style hot dog when I was actually in Chicago last year so I decided to try this at home.  Husband wouldn't touch it, due to the veggies.  However, for me, it was a great way to sneak a bunch of veggies into an otherwise unhealthy hot dog dinner.  And the taste was great!  Thanks for the post!

I really like the Chicago-style dogs,which got me thinking (and tinkering)with what other combos would work well together.I used wasabi instead of mustard and the peppers,and table salt on the tomatoes instead of celery salt,enjoyed it this way,also.

These hot dogs are amazing, although I've tried twice, I haven't been able to find poppyseed buns or sport peppers. So I guess I haven't really experienced the Chicago Dog in all its splendor.

I am retired and now sell Hot Dogs at lunch time. The Chicago Dog is a very good hot dog combination. My comment is, READ ABOVE "the ingredients must be put on in the exact order". 
Me personally, I start with the dog on the bun, then build from there.
Some of my customers ask me to build it a certain way. I DON"T CARE.
it's their dog. It's the ingredients that make the taste, not the order. (Although, some look nicer to eat than others)

I used a regular hot dog bun since I couldn't find the other kind at the grocery store so it got overflowed with everything. Oversized hot dog buns are a must!

Aaaaahhhh yes.  A Chicago street corner vendor with a Chicago dog and a Chicago tamale.  Use to order the Chicago tamales and have them shipped here to FL but can't find the company any more.  Also, to cut down on the salt, I use celery seed.  Not a perfect match but, it gets the taste about right.

Absolutely all the ingredients in a Chicago style hot dog.  Just made one for me tonight and plain dogs for the grandkids.  They'll grow into the Chicago dogs later.  But if you check out Rachel Ray's Chicago Hot Dog Salad, she uses cabbage slaw and says that it is part of the Chicago dog.  No way.  Though her salad is tasty.

Only you must use vienna beef, and I prefer to use a dill spear with a dash of celery salt... the best hot-dog stand I have ever eaten from sits right outside the Shed Aqurium in Chicago and this is how they do it! I live near Wrigly and they do it more like this recipe, so I think either way is correct... it's just a personal preference. ENJOY!!!

I never thought that i could have a hot dog without ketchup. I'm also not a big fan or pickles or onions but this hot dog changed me. I loved this hot dog.

This is by far the best hot dog I have ever had.  I love how the flavors taste all mixed together even though I really did not think I would like it.  My husband who doesn't like relish loved it and my daughter who doesn't like any kind of peppers loved it as well.  This is a KEEPER.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Excellent! Sounds weird, but they are really good. We add sliced cucumbers with everything else ~ I like mine with banana peppers and my husband likes his with jalapenos. Sometimes we make on wheat buns or hoagie rolls. Very filling!

I personally have not had a dog in Chicago but my son will be going to college there.  I looked for a recipe for Chicago style dogs to go with going away Chicago themed party. Looked at comments and decided to give this one a try.  We live in Texas so couldn't find poppy seed bun. Had everything else and wrote a brief description on how to create this beauty and boy was it a hit!!! Thank you!!

99% of these reviews are ridiculous. Why are you reviewing a recipe, when you haven’t even tried it. Just because you do not like Chicago Dogs, doesn’t mean your opinion on this recipe matters. Thank you for the proper order on how to make a great Chicago Dog! The rest of you complaining about sport peppers and relish flavor need to find a new hobby.

This was really good.  I 'm from the south side and another hot dog that I'm used to is called a Bozo hot dog.  It's also got chopped cucumbers, some diced onion mixed with a little yellow mustard.  It has been thirty five years or more, so I don't know if that is still around.  The tomatoes were also chopped, anyway that is the way I remember them.  Thank You for the recipe and memories.

You can also leave off the tomato wedges and add ketchup instead. It works really well.

It is not bad but not great. I did not have sport peppers but the additional heat would not have added anything.  It is interesting in the taste and texture combination and unlike any hotdog I have had, I would eat it again, but not pay for one from a vendor. The celery salt though is an addition I do like

I did not use the sport peppers, I am not a fan of very spicy foods. I replaced the sport peppers with pickled banana peppers. I love this recipe and will be making it again! My family loved it too. Unfortunately I could not buy poppy seed hot dog buns in my area, I need to order them on online :(.  I am sure that the next time I make this recipe it will be even better with the poppy seed buns...yummy. I also favor the skin on all beef wieners.

Couldn’t find poppy seed buns anywhere in north central Ohio.  Or sport peppers for that matter.  A little improv here.
  I read about adding blue food coloring to regular relish to get the bright color. 8 drops was too much for a 10 oz jar. But it served the purpose.   I substituted pickled Serrano peppers for sport peppers.   I just had to grill the dogs.    Next time I’d boil them.  (And remember to steam the buns and use brat buns too). Tastes great though

Here in Oregon it can be difficult to find sport peppers or poppyseed buns. But it is possible, and worth it. Very good. We have these quiet often. Only wish I could be watching a Bears game!

For 100% authenticity steam the dogs instead of boiling them. Otherwise this is the classic chicago dog I grew up eating just a stones throw from Wrigley field on the northwest side of Chicago. It MUST be a natural casing ALL BEEF dog and it MUST be on a steamed poppy seed bun! Sport peppers are ESSENTIAL. And of course it's not a Chicago dog without the dash of celery salt! And yes the order of toppings is just as important as the toppings themselves. Follow this and you'll be eating a chi town classic in no time!

I love Chicago dogs. This was to the "T" exactly how I like them. The key is the poppy seed bun, which I couldn't find so we used whole wheat buns instead. Still very, very good!

It was great, but I needed a bigger bun as half the toppings fell off. I don't think I got the full benefit of them all. Next time...

We used low carb Mission brand  wraps instead of hot dog buns to make a yummy treat, that was relatively low cal, and low carb.  It did not seem like diet food. We also grilled the hot dogs instead of boiling.

Love the Chicago dog. Just had one first time. I disagree with another review. The sport peppers are what make it. I looked on line and you can order them if you cannot find them locally.

I use Oscar Meyer all beef angus selects. This recipe makes for a great Chicago dog.

I love the recipe just as it is when I am out and about and I buy one from a stand. However when I make these at home I like to leave off the sweet relish because it over powers every thing else in my own opinion. Other than that, I love love love this style of hot dog. Its my main go to hot dog topping.

I never would have believed that I would be weighing in on a hot dog, but this is amazingly above and beyond your average dog with ketchup, mustard & relish. One of those "sum is more than the components" things.

Yummy but the most challenging part is the perfect dog and topping to roll ratio. Buy them at the same time at the same store if possible.

This is definitely the recipe I grew up eating, but I'd make two changes to the recipe.  First, steam the hot dog and bun, it makes for a better texture.  Second, cut it to two tomato wedges (I can't imagine how you'd have 4 with everything else!).  Get Vienna franks if you can find them, and you're in for a great meal!

Very delicious.  All the different flavors worked wonderfully together.  I am not much of a meat eater, but these were a welcome exception, there is so many different flavors that I wasn't solely focused on the meaty hotdog.  I used sliced, canned jalapenos for the peppers (like so many others, I couldn't find sport peppers).  Turned out very well.  I also used hamburger pickles to line the bottom of the bun (rather than the dill spear) and that worked out just fine.

This is all well and good, save for the fact that a real chicago dog does NOT have a pickle.  Cucumber slices, actually.  Halve the slices, and stack them across the length of the hot dog.  THEN you have yourself a windy city classic.  Slainte!
