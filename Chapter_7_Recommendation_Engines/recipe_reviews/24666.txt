I have got to admit that I did cheat and use a store bought Bruchetta for this recipe...but let me just say this recipe is fabulous!!!  I was browsing for a simple, yet elegant appetizer...and this recipe is just that!  I served it with garlic bagel chips and it goes so well with red or white wine!

I wasn't sure which type of brie to use for this recipe so I went with one of "medium" softness.  This was okay but I should have used the "soft" brie because it solidified quickly and we kept having to pop it in the microwave to soften again.  The flavor was good so we will have it again but with the softer cheese.

Great flavor!  A huge hit with my guests.  I used green onion instead of white and cut down on the olive oil a bit.  Very good!

I made this last night for a Christmas Eve party everyone raved about it. I made 4 times the recipe for 20 people and it was devoured. Not one little bite was left. Thanks for this recipe.

Excellent - I've made  bruschetta many times but the bruschetta mixture combined with the warm brie was delicious.  I had 14 people over last night with this and other appetizers and this was the favorite.  Will be making again!

Excellent, attractive appetizer!  I loved that all the work could be done ahead of time and then it could just be "zapped" before serving.  I added extra basil and will cut back on the onion next time I make it (probably just personal preference or a very strong onion, but the onion flavor was overpowering).  Also, I added a dose of Celtic Sea Salt to bring out the flavors.

Talk about a delicious, easy and fabulous looking dish! I made this for a Sex and the City party and it was a huge hit! I bought a round bread loaf and cut the center out to insert the cheese.  Wrapped in foil and baked in the oven for 20 min at 325.  While that is heating up make the tomato mixture.  When the bread and cheese is done spoon the tomato mixture on top and pop into the microwave for 1-2 min!  Words cant describe! I served with ritz crackers and carlic toast chips.  The Ritz crackers were easier to manage.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This dish was easy, attractive, and delicious. I made it for my boyfriend and I, and I would definately make it again for guests. We don't have a microwave, so I used the oven until the onions were cooked. I also sprinkled additional basil and parsley after it was cooked. Thanks for the great recipe.

I first made this exactly as written.  I tasted the tomato mixture before topping the brie and did add some additional italian seasonings, salt, and pepper.  It was very popular with my guests, one of those things you just can't leave alone.  The next time I made it, I used green onions and cooked them along with the arlic in the olive oil a bit because I'm not wild about that raw onion and garlic taste.  I also find it easier to heat the tomato mixture separately before using it to top the softened brie. Avoids overheating and melting the brie too much.

Great recipe idea . When I went to get my cheese they had a Brie that had tomato & basil in it already and it happened to be half price so I gave it a try . It's wonderful with it . Also I had the Epicure bruschetta seasoning and added it to the tomatoes with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar . I used my oven instead of microwave to warm the cheese then added tomato mix and put it back in  few minutes longer . I made for us Christmas eve and it was a nice change from our uaual heavy foods . I will be making this again .

I use a brand of bruschetta that I find is better than any other store bought and much better than any homemade recipe I've tried. However, the brie and bruschetta concept is genious! I served with crusty bread and everyone raved! Thanks Lynn!

I've made this several times.  I refridgerate the bruchetta for at least one day before serving. Works well with the brie, or as a traditional bruschetta appetizer.

LOVE IT!!! I made this dish to go with an italian themed meal (pasta & eggplant) and it was the show stealer.  Thankfully after reading the many reviews, of which are always helpful, I bought two brie wheels and doubled the recipe.  My only problem was that the onion was way to much and I will be very careful with it next time. I would suggest using Vidalia's, finely minced. Also, I doubled the herbs.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

I have to say this was just the best!  I needed something quick and this sure fit that bill.  I will admit I forgot to remove the rind which caused a slight mess but once we got that off the entire thing went. I am planning to make this next week again.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

My grocery store was out of the round brie cheese so I used a wedge and didn't have any problems.  Just be careful to watch the cheese in the microwave as I was busy chatting with my guests and I let it get too soft.  Otherwise, everyone enjoyed it and I plan on serving it at my next gathering.  Yum!

AMAZING! i sauteed up the onions in some of the evoo first bc the bf isnt a fan of raw onions.  defly need to use a round wheel, bc i used an 8 oz triangle, and there was way to much topping.  i even used 3/4 an onion!  but still an amazing delicious dish. the favorite of 3 bruschettas!

This was really good. However, the cheese was gooey and not very spreadable. So it didn't go well with the guests.  They just used the bruschetta with the pita bread and skipped the cheese.

I thought this was easy but tasted just ok. And unfortunately it didn't go over well at my Italian themed game night...but maybe it was just us.  Thanks for sharing.

I admit that I too cheated and used store-bought bruschetta. Actually only used a wedge of brie and served it with Trader Joe's mini toasts. It was still fabulous. It was the first thing gone, and it left us wanting more.

This was really good!  I took it to a pool party and everyone raved about it.  I didn't have green onions on hand so instead used fresh chives from my garden.  I also added more fresh basil than called for and some salt and pepper.  This is my new "staple" appetizer.  So easy!!

This recipe was a hit hen I brought it to a family/friends gathering this past weekend!  Everyone kept asking me for the recipe but the only thing I gave was a promise to make it the next time.  The only things I changed were 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1 plus gr. onions with the white.

This was so good!  I made it as an appetizer for a July 4th celebration and everyone loved it!  I added more tomatoes and will decrease the amount of olive oil next time.

Very tasty. We were big fans of the dip and chose Pepperidge Farm flatbreads (tomato and herb) to serve it. Heat it up more than what it calls for to make it spreadable.

This is a very elegant and tasty appetizer.  I used a wedge of brie and didn't take the top rind off and it turned out great.  I served it with water crackers and everyone raved about it.  I'll definitely make this again!

I made this for a New Year's Eve party and thought it was ok.  It needed something, more of a kick.  I'd add more pepper if I tried this again.  The best compliment I can give is that it looked impressive.

Fabulous. I served this using just a wedge of brie (double cream brie, not triple cream). I loved the simplicity of doing it in the microwave, and my guests loved it. Made sure to add lots of garlic and basil! Perhaps a little less onion then suggested also.

This was a great base recipe.  Prepared this today for an impromptu potluck and it got rave reviews.  I did make some changes to the recipe - I used hot house tomatoes (the romas at the store looked subpar), I didn't use as much olive oil - simply poured in enough to moisten up the mixture (1/8 cup?), and added in a few splashes of balsamic vinagrette, and a dash of pepper.  I also didn't heat the tomato mixture.  I just spooned it on top.  The tomato mixture itself makes a great salsa!  I will definitely make this again!

Twenty stars!!!!  Next time I would remove more of the white coating as it got kind of gummy in the bowl, and would only use half as much olive oil, but this was a HUGE hit!!!

This is a winner. Definite five star material. However, WATCH YOUR MICROWAVES!

I made two of these. The first was with a group containing a person allergic to onions. So I cut a hunk out.  Then I watched my microwave for excess meltage since there was a break in the rind (is meltage a word?) Anyway, I have a 900 watt microwave and I ended up stopping it at about 30 seconds. Then I nuked the topping separately for a minute then combined the two.  Every bit was eaten and two people asked for the recipe.

The second one I made was for a group with no food allergies.  So I simply nuked for a minute following instructions.  I had a melty mess. Even with my underpowered convection/microwave combo.  

Moral, don't take the  times as gospel. I suppose it depends on the softness of the brie.  Watch and stop before you have a melty mess. When it's done right, it's absolutely delicious.

I am giving this a 4 star because like other reviews, it was messy and I am not sure how to get it to look like the photos of the recipe listed above.  It is extremely delicious and I will definitely be making it again but, just wish I kinew how to keep it without being runny.  Other than the appearance all my guests (15 of them) enjoyed this appetizer and devoured it. It's a great appetizer and delicious!

This is a wonderful way to highlight the wonderful tomato and basil combo in an appetizer.  I suggest using more basil than is called for - I've seen a similar recipe that calls for 1/2 cup, so don't be shy!  I skimped on the onion (used a red one) and the olive oil.  I honestly think you could skip the olive oil completely.  I added the parsley because I happened to have some on hand.  I'll probably leave it out in the future because I'm not buying a big bunch of parsley so I can have 1 tsp of it!  I'm not sure I like the parsley flavor in it anyway.  I served with pita toasts because that's all I had - it was good, but I bet it's better on bread.
