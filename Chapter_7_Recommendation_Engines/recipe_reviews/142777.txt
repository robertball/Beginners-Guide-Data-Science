This was very good. I used it as a veggie dish for dinner. I made one change -  I added a small amount of fresh minced garlic. When I make it again, which I will, I am going to top them with a bread crumb topping. I think that will add a great crunch and texture.

I used fat free ricotta and also added fresh garlic and sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs on top. I think the flavor was good, but next time I will add more seasonings and maybe some chopped tomatoes.

Could be a 4 star recipe, with less pepper. We liked it!

We used small curd cottage cheese instead of ricotta.

Excellent. I made these into appetizers.  I cut the zucchini into rounds and hollowed out a bit. I added a bit of garlic to the mixture and used Italian seasoning.  I put some filling on the zucchini rounds and topped with half a grape tomato and baked for about 10 minutes. Fabulous. Beautiful looking and everyone loved. Good way to use up the garden produce.

This was great!  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and it worked well.  Also, added garlic like some other reviewers mentioned and a dash of hot sauce.  Lovely!

Delicious! It's a great change from the usual way I've always prepared zucchini.
I added a clove of crushed garlic to the mix and sprinkled a little italian bread crumbs on the top. Will make again...and again! My daughter LOVED it!

What a great way to eat zucchini!  We gobbled this recipe up and I will be making it again.  Slightly reduced the amount of salt and put in a bit more dried basil than it called for ... fantastic, thanks for sharing!

This was so easy to prepare and cook.  I used 5 small zucchini.  I added 5 cloves of garlic minced and 1 green pepper diced.  I used fresh basil instead of dried and fat free ricotta instead of skim because that's what I had in the fridge.  Next time I will use the skim ricotta.  I also sprayed the zucchini before stuffing a little with Pam (I didn't want to use olive oil because with all the cheese I didn't want it to be too greasy).  Mine cooked at 450 for 30 minutes because after 20 minutes they still were not browned.  My husband thought this tasted like white pizza with fresh garlic and broccoli.  What a great healthy alternative! I will be making this again especially when we have people over to eat.  Delicious, healthy and flavorful!!!!

This was good.  I used fresh basil and about 50% more than the recipe called for.  I also added panko crumbs on top when I baked them.  The panko was great.  It really added a satisfying crunch to an otherwise soft dish.

This was a great way to serve fresh zucchini. The lemon and basil gave this dish a light, fresh taste. My chagnes: Per other reviewers, I added 1/2 tsp of minced garlic. I also added a dash of Italian seasoning to each zucchini half along with the salt & pepper. I added Italian bread crumbs to half the recipe just to see how it would be--good either way. A keeper!

Wow!  This is a great way to use up zucchini from the garden, that happens to taste wonderful!  I made this for a church gathering.  There were only 8 people there, and I had only 1/2 of a boat left by the time we were done.  It is really good just the way it is.  However, we like to top ours with a mixture of diced tomatoes from the garden and feta cheese for that extra zing.  I also added fresh rosemary and used fresh basil instead of dried, and some garlic powder.  Fantastic idea that we will make often.  It goes great with a simple side of pasta with maranara.

I had some ricotta cheese I needed to use up and this is the first recipe I found that called for it.  I decided to switch it up by adding fresh basil instead of dried basil.  Also I topped it with sliced grape tomatoes and minced garlic just to give it a little zing.  I uploaded a photo! It was pretty good, and my boyfriend approved... thats a plus!

I used the Italian mix cheeses (Parmesan, Romano, Provolone, Mozzarella) with the Ricotta. I also used 1 echalotte française and a small clove of puréed garlic and fresh basil instead of dried. An Italian Ripasso Valpolicella wine was to die for with it.

I love this recipe!  I add a bit more parmesan cheese, and I also add chopped up sun-dried tomatoes, chopped up fresh basil leaves, and toasted pine nuts.  YUM! I have used this filling to stuff hollowed out tomatoes and bell peppers as well.

Surprisingly, my picky younger son liked this dish and my husband and older son didn't.  Instead of greasing the baking sheet, I covered it with foil for an easy clean up.  I would probably make this again for my younger son and myself.

I made this tonight and it was delicious and so did my husband. i took the advice of some other raters including adding garlic and Panko bread crumbs. I also baked it in a cast iron skillet that made the bottom firmer.

I found this recipe when I was looking for a different way to serve up zucchni - especially since I love it and my husband doesnt care for it.  He LOVED it.  Actually he said "well, anything is good when you smother it in cheese."  LOL.  I used the extra smooth ricotta - which gives it a really velvety texture.  YUM.

I've made these a couple of times and they're definitely tasty. I think they look slightly better than they taste, as the inner part of the zucchine can go a bit mushy/'liquidy'. we like them better with breadcrumbs on top. fun to make and so pretty.

it wasnt a total hit but i think the problem is the salt and pepper... waaay to much (maybe its a typo?)... great idea though and with some tweaking can make a nice summer entree.  im going to play around with it.

The flavors work well in this recipe.  I too baked the zucchini halves before stuffing but after seasoning them with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning as I was afraid the shells would be too hard.   I also think I will cut down both the salt and pepper next time, especially if I include the Italian Seasoning again.  I added minced fresh garlic per suggestions from other reviews.  Thank you for the recipe!  My husband and I ate these for dinner, not an appetizer, along with some corn muffins for a meatless meal.

I made this exactly as the recipe directed, as I wanted to see what it tasted like before I started making changes.  As written, it was good and also easy, and I would give it four stars.  It was a little bland, and I agree with others that the recipe calls for too much pepper. I wanted to see what it would taste like with marinara sauce on it, so I heated some (Newman's Own) and served it in a side dish so we could sample the stuffed zucchini both ways. With the addition of the marinara drizzled over the top I would give it five stars for sure!  To both my husband and me, it added the little bit of zing that was needed and made it a super dish.  When I make this again I will cook it for 20 minutes, lightly spoon some marinara on top and sprinkle some mozzarella over that and put it back in for ten minutes.  I did have to cook mine for 30 minutes anyway as I used very large zucchini.  UPDATE: I did use my idea to top lightly with marinara sauce after 20 minutes and add grated mozzarella on top and finish baking. It was delicious. Definitely 5 stars to me with this addition. I also tried adding my homemade meat sauce as the topper and it was good, but not as good as plain marinara and cheese to me.

I used this filling recipe on eggplant rounds rather than zucchini halves and it was delicious.  It was like a much lighter version of eggplant parmesan, perfect for a light dinner on a warm day.  I had a little filling leftover (I was cooking for 1) and I scooped a dollop onto my ratatouille the next day - so good!

Used "Home Made Farmer's Cheese" for the ricotta cheese. The kidlets didn't like it but I thought it tasted pretty good.

I found this recipe while looking for a new way to use zucchini. This was great! I served them alongside fish as a meal. I'll be making these again soon. Such a nice change from the sauteed zucchini rut I was in.

Very yummy way to eat zucchini. My hubby especially liked it and he's not a big veggie eater.   The lemon gave it a really nice tangy flavor. Yum!

I didn't have any ricotta so I substituted cream cheese (the "whipped" kind) in this recipe. Instead of baking this, I just put the zucchini on a piece of foil on my outdoor grill, over high heat.  It was on there for about 20 minutes and it turned out  fabulous!  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make this one again.

My husband and I used this as an appetizer and it was pretty good.  I made it as exactly as showed. I was tempted to skip the lemon juice but don't.  You can't taste it in the final product but it gives the zucchini a brightness that's really nice.  It needed more Parmesan and some oregano, I think.  Also, cooking a bit ahead of time either in the microwave or boiling would help since it was way too crisp.  I will definitely make again, with the changes.

This was a very good recipe but I have found in the past that adjusting a bit works better. If you par-boil the zucchini before for a few minutes add the mixture, cook it on 350 for 15-20 min and also instead of basil use 2 tablespoons of dried oregano and hold the lemon juice and top it with mozzarella it turns out really yummy. I think the key is not to over cook the zucchs and don't over stuff them either. In this recipe the zucchini was a little mushy.

I used half the salt and pepper, and still way too much!  It tasted like that's all I was eating.  I will make it again but with garlic a couple of flakes of red pepper and just a small sprinkle of salt.

I thought it was ok   Wish I had read other reviews before making.  I think the garlic would have been a big deal that so many people added.  Will give it one more try and change up some including garlic and maybe  different spice for basil.  Maybe dill?>

Easy & delicious!  Sprinkled zucchini w/salt & pepper to taste.  Followed the recipe as written,  but topped with more parm & mozzerella before putting into oven. Served as side dish with italian entree dish.  Will definitely be doing this again!

I am getting ready to make my version of the recipe, by making a meat loaf mixture. Browning the turkey meat with sausage and onions, bell peppers, garlic Italian seasoning, then pack the boat and bake a bit top with tomaoe sauce or spaghetti sauce.

Finally a different way to prepare zucchini.  Absolutely delicious.  I also added garlic powder before the cheese, but other than that made it exactly as written.  The ricotta really soaks into the zucchini and for those vegetable haters, if blindfolded, they'll never even know they're eating zucchini and will keep asking for more.

Wonderful and delicious.  Fixed it for my husband and I then took the remainder to work.  My co-workers loved it, too.  Even those who don't like zucchini loved this.  May add some toasted Anise Seed next time to give it that bit of Italian Sausage taste w/o the sausage.

Loved this!  I did adjust the salt and pepper measurements to suit my tastes and used low fat cheeses.  It tasted so rich and delicious - but still healthy.  Quick easy way to use up the zucchini in the garden.  Thanks for sharing.

Nice recipe - I stuffed a huge zucchini from my garden and could have baked it a little longer, but it was still good.  I only used about 1/2 the salt and pepper suggested, and added more shredded mozzarella and fresh grated parmesan cheese on top before baking.

What a great recipe for zucchini, I made this tonight! My husband & I loved it, but I'll be honest, after reading some reviews, I made a few changes. I didn't have any lemons so I sub'd it w/lemon pepper (I never measure spices when it comes to salt & pepper, I just add what I think it 'needs'. I added just a bit of garlic, finely diced up onion, fresh basil & bell peppers (red & green). *I made spaghetti last night, so I had some leftovers of these*  When I say a 'bit', the total added items probably equaled a full tbls. I turned out great and will definently make again! Thanx

This was wonderful. The only change I made was using cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, since I didn't have any on hand. A keeper, for sure.

These were a little rich, but excellent.

I added proscuitto to give it more flavor.  It was good - not fabulous - but I'd make it again if I had extra zucchini because it's easy and the presentation is nice.

It is soooooo good.  Instead of part skim ricotta and mozzarela, I used whole milk.  I also exchanged swiss cheese for the parm and added some bread crumbs.  Everyone thought is was a five star recipe.
