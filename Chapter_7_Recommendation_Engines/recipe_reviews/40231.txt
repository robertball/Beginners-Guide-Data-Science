This recipe was more time consuming compared with a simple roast chicken, but it tasted utterly fabulous. My husband pronounced it "outstanding." After a lengthy examination of the extensive spice section at my local grocery store, I was unable to find the Greek seasoning mix listed (sorry, McCormick's, but I tried!) and so I used a mixture of oregano, dill (small amount), black pepper, salt, and minced garlic instead.

I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts instead of roasting a whole chicken, but stayed true to the remaining ingredients. Of course, cooking method changed slightly; I roasted the potato and onion mixture for 30 min in a 9x13 casserole dish, then pushed the potatoes to the sides of the pan, layered lemon slices in the middle and placed the chicken breasts (which were coated in the butter/greek seasoning rub) on top and roasted for an additional 30 min. After the chicken was done, I followed the remaining steps of the recipe as written. The result was moist, flavourful chicken and a huge burst of lemon in the potatoes that reminded me of the "lemon potatoes" a local Greek restaurant serve. There weren't any leftovers!

Wonderful dish for entertaining.  I used swiss chard instead of spinach just because that's what I had in the fridge.  Gave the veggies more "bite".  Also, I cooked the chicken breast side down with foil for the first hour, then removed the foil.  I brushed some melted butter on top during the last 15 minutes to make it brown.  Did not have McCormick's spices and mixed the usual: oregano, salt, pepper, basil, garlic powder, then added lemon peel.

Excellent!  I agree that it tastes as good left-over as the first night!  I was able to find the correct seasoning - thought it sounded like a large amount being used but turned out great.

I've been making this recipe for about 4 years now. When I was single it was my 'go to' recipe.  I still make it for my husband.  The chicken is always delicious and it can be dressed up and served for guests.  I love it!

This is a fabulous chicken dinner.  I have a chef service and my clients love it.  I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of whole chicken.

I made this only using legs & thighs since our family likes dark meat best; probably close to doubled the called for one whole chicken, but there was plenty of the Greek spice.  I too was unable to find the McCormick's Greek seasoning, so used Cavendar's.  Also doubled the number of small potatoes & the spinach.  The smell while cooking was unbelievable.  This fed my husband, myself, a teenage boy, and 2 school agers.  Will make again, but only when I have a lot of prep time.  Absolutely delicious and nice presentation.

The smell while cooking this was unbelievable. The butter-seasoning mix made the chicken turn out juicy and tender. The potatoes were a bit underdone; I'd recommend slicing them thinner. The lemons added just the right amount of pop to the dinner. I served this on Valentine's Day last year, and my boyfriend loved it - and loved me enough to ask me to marry him a few days later!

Excellent.  I would cut the potatoes into thin slices instead of wedges, so they get crispy in the oven.  I also used a lot more lemon juice than it calls for.

This is my first time writing a review at this site.  The reason I'm choosing this one to be my first is because it is without a doubt the best chicken dish I have ever made.  The chicken was delicious and the potatoes were out of this world good.  What a great recipe!  I am not a great cook so for those of you nervous about trying a new recipe, don't worry about this one.  It's easy to follow and looks and tastes like you spent a lot more time preparing it than you did:)  I told my husband I wish I could bottle the aroma coming out of the oven as it was cooking.

Absolutely delicious!!  Great texture, great flavor!  No one spoke at the table.  They just ate and ate.  Great meal anytime and especially if you want to make a good impression when expecting company.  All in one baking pan until the end.  Taste as you're finishing and add salt, etc. to your liking.  I couldn't find the McCormick seasoning so I substituted "All Purpose Greek Seasoning."  Thanks!!*****

This was an excellent and easy dish to prepare.  I wouldn't hesitate to prepare it for a dinner party.  It's easy and preparation time just before serving is minimal.  Served with a mixed green salad it's an easy dish to prepare and almost everything can be done ahead of time!

This was delicious after I read other reviews and kicked up the volume a bit on the spices.  1 TBS of greek seasoning doesn't look like enough.  Instead of butter, I rubbed the chicken with Olive Oil, sprinkled generously with Paula Dean's House Seasoning (salt, garlic powder and pepper) and then added about 2 TBS greek seasoning (reserving a bit for the veggies).  I used chickens halved, so I pre-baked my veggies for 30 mins at 400 degrees with a bit of greek seasoning and tossed in Olive Oil in the roasting pan.  Giving them a couple stirs during the cooking time. Oh, I also tossed in big cloves of elephant garlic.  Ummmm YUMMO! After veggies are done cooking, I pushed them to the side and added my chicken and turned the heat down to 375.  Used lemon slices to layer the bottom, put my chicks on top and gave them a bit of lemon juice squeeze and baked until they were done.  About 45 mins.  I did slice my potatoes and glad I did that since the wedges would not have cooked properly.  The chicken was fabulous and moist.  I didn't do the spinach feta thing either.. I just plated the chicken and served the veggies in a side dish tossed with a fresh squeeze of half the lemon and we were set to go!  Delish and very easy.  The elephant garlic was fabulous, but potatoes and onions were nicely browned and very tasty cooking in the chicken juices.  I didn't want them bathing in chicken fat and the chicken halves worked well... without the butter.

Very Good!  The vegetables had a great flavor and a beautiful presentation.  Not as time consuming as it sounds. A great change for a roasted chicken. I cut the chicken up and ran it under the broiler for a few minutes while the veggies were cooking to crispen the skin.  YUM!!!!

This was different and delicious. I couldn't find the Greek seasoning so I mixed up my own (although I didn't have any mint to add). Still it was really good, but I agree, it is time consuming.But don't let that keep you from trying it.

Very tasty!  The chicken was somewhat greasy - I think next time I will lessen or eliminate the butter;  used fingerling potatoes and they were thoroughly cooked when the chicken was done.

This recipe had really good flavor, but I think that was mostly due to the Greek seasoning mixture I mixed up myself (looked it up online).  And the fact that I squeezed the juice of one lemon over the chicken, and the other lemon over the potoato mix.  Without that, I really dont' think it would have tasted nearly as good as it did.  My potatoes didn't cook all the way in the specified time.  (I only used 4 potatoes).  I thought they were ok, because I pierced a few with a fork and they felt just right.  But when I went to eat them, they were too hard.  So they're roasting more right now, without the chicken.  I was thinking about pre-cooking them before staring this recipe, and now I wish I would have.  I didn't do the whole spinach/feta thing.  I did like the whole butter/spice mix rub, I think that provided a lot of flavor.  I might write down my own variation of this recipe to make again.

We were in the mood for a recipe like this but with tomatoes, so we added a 15 oz can of crushed fire roasted tomatoes. Had some green beans in the fridge so we threw them in half way through the cooking time. This was so good! Squeezed the lemons from the chicken cavity into the potato mixture for an extra lemony zip.

Wow. A lot of work for a pretty unimpressive dinner. The chicken was SO bland -- only bits here and there tasted lemony -- and the potatoes were okay, but nothing great.

This dish was phenom!  It was so flavorful, I am making it again tonight.  I did not use McCormicks greek seasoning, I used Cavender's.  It hard to find, but if you see it, snag it, its great on all meats.

My husband said this was possibly the best roast chicken he'd ever had. I couldn't find McCormick brand greek seasoning, but another brand worked just fine. I loved the spinach with feta and olives. This will be one of my favorites.

Really good.  I would omit the goat cheese next time, though.  I added more garlic, but overall wonderful.

This was just okay.  The chicken wasn't bad, but the vegetables were.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I left out the feta.  Won't be making it again.

We both really liked this recipe and would normaly give it five stars.  Being a Greek dish, I was expecting a bit more kick to it.  The flavors were nice, but not as strong as I was expecting.
