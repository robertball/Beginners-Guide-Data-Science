I made this for my Red Hat tea.  The taste was great the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is it was a little hard to spread. (even though i let it sit to room temperature) I followed the recipe exactly I thought it was very tasty. One lady told me I should add more honey.

This was very tasty!!  A nice change from the ordinary "salty" cheese balls.  I actually used locally made honey jelly which turned out GREAT!!  I also found dried mixed fruit bits by Sunmaid so that saved me the time from having to chop the dried mixed fruit.  Very quick and easy to prepare!  Thanks Debbye!

I thought this was a good recipe, but was a little bland. I added a tsp of honey and everyone seemed to like it. Tastes great with graham crackers.

This was a fantastic and addictive tasting recipe.  With only 4 ingredients you can't get easier than that!  I accidently used the whole pack of shredded cheese but it still came out great.  And instead of just using pecans I did a 50-50 pecan almond mix.  Delicious!

I LOVED this, great with digestive biscuits.  Definitely a keeper - lovely sweet, but not overwhelming, taste.  Next time might try with a kick of Brandy or other liquor...

This recipe is easy and delicious. I did make some changes. Instead of mild cheddar, I used Pepper Jack cheese and I used dried chopped cranberries. It came out delicious.

This is so good and easy!  I used dried cranberries and apricots and my daughters & I LOVED it. They're normally very picky but have asked for this for our Christmas celebration. YUM!

I have made this twice now and when people try it they are pleasantly surprised how good it is.  I made it exactly as written and for the chopped, dried chopped fruit I used Sunmaid Fruit Bits.  I served it with Teddy Grahams one time and graham crackers another time.  Both tasted great but I prefered the Teddy Grahams as they held up better to the thickness of this cheese ball.

The picture shows this cheese ball to be somewhat creamy however mine was not. It was bland as well. I followed the directions as stated. I will tweak this a bit  (which I dislike doing) to try to get this to be more 'spreadable" - perhaps more honey, less fruit, less pecan topping. I'm not sure what to do!

I made this with 6 oz of crumbled goat cheese instead of the shredded Cheddar cheese & added a half tbsp of honey! Amazing!!!

Delicious. I served this at my Christmas cookie exchange and got many requests for the recipe. I love the taste. I made it two days in advance and the flavor got even better in the fridge. I coated it in crushed pistachios. Thanks so much for this unique and fantastic cheese ball.

This was a unique twist on the usual cheeseball.  I couldn't find typical mixed dried fruit at the store, so I did a combination of dried cranberries, dried dates, and some freeze-dried mixed fruit.  It was pretty good, but I would like to try it as indicated.  People did like it, though!
