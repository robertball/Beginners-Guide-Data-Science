Be VERY careful to fill the cups a very SCANT halfway full.  If you fill the cups up too much, you will have a disaster on your hands!

These were really good for such a simple recipe.  I was a little worried about the texture but it worked out fine. I was making these for my husband for he loves sweets.  I filled the cups up just a little and dropped a hersey kiss in the middle (just a little extra love) and topped it off with the mixture.  When he took his first bit he was suprised by the creamy chocolate in the center.  Yes these brownies have a great chocolate flavore on there own and don't need anything else but if you really like chocolate try dropping some in the middle next time and see if you like it.

I was looking for something to take to my doctors office tomorrow and wanted something easy for the staff to share.  These are perfect.  5 stars all around the table.  My personal reasons being the entire package; how cute they are, the texture, and taste.  I made the mistake of listening to another reviewer about filling the cups less than half way and they baked extremely tiny...almost bite size.  But with my 2nd batch (yes, I have made these 5 times since discovering the recipe last week) I listened to the recipe's directions and filled them 2/3 of the way.  I didn't experience any mess, none what-so-ever.  I will certainly continue to make these but with a baking powder addition.

I love these. Absolutely delicious. I was concerned about texture with so many eggs just dumped in with the other ingredients, so I beat them with the sugar first until light colored (not too much or they'll collapse when they come out of the oven) then added the flour and folded the chocolate mixture. Maybe uneccesary, and this way probably created more of a cake-like cupcake than brownie-like. They were chocolatey, soft, sweet and needed no icing.

yummy. these are the best brownies and the best cupcakes I've ever tried. I did make a few changes: I added 1 tsp of baking powder, 2 Tble spoons of cocoa powder and I baked them for only 20 minutes. perfection. Will definitly bake these again with variations; walnuts, extra chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, etc.,

My kids really enjoyed these, but I still prefer just a regular, gooey, fudgy brownie.  Because these are baked like cupcakes, they have a hard top and edge to them, and were more cake-like than fudge-like.  I felt that they definitely needed frosting and topped them with a chocolate buttercream.  I did not use the pecans because I was mainly making these for kids.  I also did not bake for 35 minutes.  Watch closely, because mine were done in about 25 minutes.

These were very moist and came out pretty. My mom LOVED them and said they were perfect. To me, they weren't chocolatey enough and the vanilla overpowered the other flavors. Actually, they were  like black vanilla muffins and they tasted really good :) Just not the way I would have liked.

Today was my hubby's birthday and he wanted brownie cupcakes with peanut butter frosting.  I used this recipe along with another recipe from the site, Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting.  They go great together.  I did cut the recipe in half and additionally used 1/3 less sugar but everything else was perfect exactly as the recipe is written. Great recipe! Thanks!

Halved this recipe and it made 18 mini brownie cups. Used a non-stick mini muffin pan which worked beautifully since I didn't use liners. Decided to forgo the pecans. Put 4-5 Kraft caramel bits into the wells after filling by dropping them onto the batter and carefully pushing them in with a toothpick until just covered. Hoped for the best while baking. Did not need the 35 mins to bake since they were minis, kept a close eye on them after 10 mins. They took nearly 16 mins. The caramels didn't melt well but tasted good. They didn't sink to the bottom which I had hoped they wouldn't. Frosted them with Chocolate Cookie Frosting from this site and decorated with chocolate sprinkles. Yeah, these are good especially with a glass of cold milk. Mmmmm

I followed the recipe as listed.  The taste was good, except they were dry.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make them better?
