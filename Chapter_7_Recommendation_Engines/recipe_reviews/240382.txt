Delicious! It came out perfect, even though I used the chili with beans.

So I didn't use Hormel chili, but instead use my leftover chili for these. Ended up being pretty good use of leftover chili! I placed my cheeses on top of the crescent roll with just a slight sprinkle of cilantro to help change the taste from leftover to something new, and it added a very nice look to it. Serve with a side of sour cream and it is surprisingly wonderful.

It's in the oven now and I don't anticipate any problems. I forgot to add the cheese, but will still be good.

These were great! The filling was tasty and was delicious with the flaky biscuit dough.  I served these with giant dollops of sour cream.  There was a little leftover filling which I served over pasta the second day.

What a great take on chili for lunch! I love these chili pockets. They were easy to make and tasty to eat.

I made this exactly as directed.   I thought it was ok.   Seemed like it needed something else.   Will try again with some changes.
