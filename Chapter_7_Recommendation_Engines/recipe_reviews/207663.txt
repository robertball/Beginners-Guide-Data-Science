I substituted low-fat vanilla yogurt for the Greek yogurt, and omitted the vanilla flavoring and confectioners' sugar. The texture was much more fluid, but it was still tasty... I prefer the original recipe. Perfect for parties!

I really enjoyed this twist on fruit dip!  I LOVE that it has no artificial marshmallow fluff, and the cinnamon and mint complement each other well.  Thanks Sue!

This is a yummy dip, although my guests at a baby shower didn't try much of it.  I think the reason may be because the specks of cinnamon give it an odd appearance.  Or maybe the sprig of mint in the middle?  I felt the mint flavor was too subtle, surprisingly.  I could hardly taste it.  
The yogurt I bought (the only available) was honey flavored, and I added a touch more honey anyway, and the taste was fine in that aspect.  Probably didn't need all the powdered sugar, though.
Overall, I did enjoy the dip and will make it again, with alterations.
