Oh My.....  This is one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made! Used the food processor for the crust, and had no problems with the butter quantity.  Be sure not to over-bake. Remove from the oven while the center is still jiggly-it WILL set up, and you'll have no cracks.  Also, run a knife around the edge as soon as you take it out of the oven.  Cut small pieces!

This cheesecake tastes fabulous!!  The three different layers come out beautiful and makes people think you spent much more time on the dish than you actually did.  I ENJOYED this one!!!

This was the first time I baked a cheesecake. Actually, it was the first time I baked anything other than brownies. My boyfriend and I both made one to bring to our families for thanksgiving. They both came out awesome! Everyone was completely amazed and it was the best cheesecake that they EVER had. They couldn't believe a college student made it. The only thing I would change is that you need more butter for the crust to stick together. I recommend it for anyone! :)

I couldn't find the Special Dark chips, so I used regular semi-sweet.  

Half a stick of butter was not enough to get the crust to stick together.  I had to use a whole stick.

The cooking time may be a little long.  I checked it at about 45 minutes and it was already completely set.  This caused the top to crack and fall as it cooled.  So it didn't look as pretty as the picture, but it tasted great.

I made this cake for my boss' birthday - MISTAKE!  I thought it was horrible personally.  It was so bitter I couldn't get the aftertaste out of my mouth for 30 mins.  I guess I should have known better than to make a new recipe for someone's birthday.  I was honestly embarassed to have brought this for everyone.  I am a pretty good cook, everyone I work with knows that, this tarnished my reputation. If you have a sweet tooth this is not for you.  It looked WONDERFUL but the taste did not match. If I were to make this again ( which I wont) I would have to almost double the sugar. I'm giving 2 stars because my boss said he liked it; although I don't think he would have said so if he didn't.

loved it so easy to make and everybody enjoyed.  only thing i would change is the powdered sugar in the crust.  it makes huge clumps in the butter and cookie  crumbs like hard candy.  maybe regular sugar would be better.

UNBELIEVABLY decadent cheesecake.  Wonderfully easy to make with great results.  I will be trying this recipe with other types of chocolate chips.

Wonderful! very rich and creamy. and it looked great too. I will make this again. my third layer didn't come out well and mixed with the second unfortunately but that's due to not enough chocolate for the second. i'll work on it.

Perfect for chocolate and cheesecake lovers! My fiance loved it!

This cheesecake was excellent. I made for my mother's birthday party and everyone loved it. But I did make a few changes, because of my father being type 2 diabetic. I used 1/2 choc. chips and 1/2 unsweetened dark chocolate squares. I also used Oreo crumbs for the crust and low fat cream cheese (almost calorie free!)

This recipe was extremely easy to make and was a huge hit at our family Christmas party.  No one even thought of trying a piece of the other pies!
