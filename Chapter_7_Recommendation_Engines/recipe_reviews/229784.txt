Wonderful recipe with a nice combination of flavors! The sweet apple sausage paired with sharp cheddar was definitely an indicator that this was going to be tasty so I had to give this a try and boy am I glad I did! This was a nice change to our regular breakfast sandwich routine and so good you'd never know that the sausage was so low in fat. I used reduced fat shard cheddar along with whole grain bagel thins vs. mini bagels. And since I didn't have apple jelly I served this with a side of apple butter.  Perfect served with fresh fruit and OJ!

I thought this was okay. I did make some tweaks. SInce I couldn't find al fresco at my local Acme store, I did Coleman's organic apple maple chicken sausage instead. There was no indication in the recipe if the casings should be on and off either. I did cut one sausage in half for two sliders. I used almond milk and sweet Hawaiian sliders instead of wheat bagels or biscuits.  I would love to try it again when I make it next time with Al fresco chicken sausage.

Added a few things myself, but the recipe overall was solid and delicious.
