This was a tasty, light and relatively low calorie dessert. I used ricotta cheese drizzled with honey instead of salt and pepper. As I don't own a kitchen torch, I lined a baking sheet with foil (for easy clean up) and broiled the sugar on the halved figs under a low heat for a few minutes - turned out just right but keep an eye on them as the sugar will quickly turn from melted to burnt. This is one I will make again as it's easy enough to make a quick dessert just for one person as it is for several more.

Quick and easy and makes you look good. Flavors weren't quite as vibrant as I had expected, but it was still yummy and easy to make.
