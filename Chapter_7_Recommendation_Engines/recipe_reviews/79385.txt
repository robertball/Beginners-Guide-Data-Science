I rate this a 4 because of its a decent meal and fast and easy to prepare. What I did do different was combine all the ingredients together (noodles uncooked and used cream of chicken soup)added maybe about a cup of sour cream and some water, enough to make sure noodles were covered in pan. Baked covered for about a 1/2 hour. If I dont have to precook noodles before using them in a dish i don't.

I think that perhaps this recipe needs 2 cans of soup. Using just 1 can made it very dry. There was no "bubbling" when it was baking. Still, the flavors are good together. I personally am not fond of mushrooms, so I used a can of cream of celery soup instead. I also added some chopped celery and grated carrots for more color and nutrition. It is easy to get creative with this recipe by adding different vegetables or adding a topping before baking. I tried grated mozarella.

We liked this one - I followed the advice of others and added 1 can crm of chicken, and I also added garlic powder, minced onion, and sprinkled cheese over 1/2 of it.  My kids loved it, and I thought it was a great base to be tweaked depending on our mood.

This is an easy, fast, DELICIOUS recipe "as is". It's even better with cheese and CREAMED corn, as opposed to plain kernals. And onion- can't forget the onion :)

I can't believe how easy this recipe is! I didn't have corn so I made it with peas/carrots and it was very good.

I topped this casserole with a box of Stove Top Chicken flavored stuffing mix, prepared according to the package directions to make it stretch for my large family.  It also added to the flavor.

Okay.......this was just bad.  I gave it two starts just in case it was my weird personal taste or something.  This dish even smelled bad when it was cooking.  I will admit this is my first time to ever cook with ground turkey, maybe it was that in it's self that was gross, I don't know.  I will not ever try cooking with it again.

Anything that my two year old ask for seconds gets five stars in my book!  Made some changes due to what I had on hand. Used one can of cream of asparagus and one can of cream of chicken.  I also used a little chicken broth for more liquid b/c I didn't precook the noodles.

Pretty good base recipe but as people said, it needs seasoning.  I sauteed onions with the meat.  For seasoning I added garlic powder, onion salt and a bit of paprika & parsley flakes to add color.
Make sure noodles are covered or they become hard.  Might taste better with leftover turkey than ground.

Sorry I did not like this one at all.  Although my family did.  I thought it was way too bland.  I like the suggestion of more cream of mushroom and also adding french fried onions to the top.

Even with a bunch of tweaks this was just "ok" my husband said it was edible but he wouldn't miss it if we never had it again.

Changes I made were to use 2 cans of healthy request soup, a can of del monte fiesta corn, sauted some diced onion and celery with the turkey (white meat turkey) and added garlic powder, paprika and red pepper flakes to the mixture. For the topping (the best part imho) I used 2 cups of crushed reduced fat buttery crackers mixed with 2T melted butter and about a half cup of fat free sour cream.
In our opinion it had way too many noodles.

I didn't give this 2 stars because it was gross(it wasn't), but because it was extremely bland.  I read through all the other reviews and tried to combine them into the dish I made. So I added veggies (I used red and yellow bell peppers and onion) and an extra can of cream of mushroom soup. I cooked those with the ground turkey. I also added garlic powder, crushed red pepper and parsley. I didn't cook the noddles ahead of time. In a bowl I mixed the turkey mixture, uncooked noodles and 1cup of plain yogurt. I dumped that all in a baking dish and added water to cover the noodles. I cooked for 20min and than stirred/pushed down the noodles so that they all got fully cooked. Than I cooked another 30min and topped with mozzarella cheese at the end. It was still very bland. It might not be fair to rate this recipe 2 stars since I made a fair amount of changes but I don't think it would have been any better or more favorable if I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't want to throw out and waste all the food so I sampled it with BBQ sauce, A1 sauce, and hot sauce (not all at once but each individually). It helped somewhat but still not great. I won't be making this again.

We liked this and will probably make it again, mainly because it was quite quick. We took the advise of many reviews and this is how I tried it: we cooked the noodles only for 4min. Browned the meat with onion & garlic, then added a can of creamed corn & I used cream of chicken soup - I was out of cream of mushroom soup but I think that would have made it better. I also added celery and sage. I topped it with cheddar cheese too. I baked it uncovered for the 20min as written. It was pretty good, not spectacular but for something different & quick it's a good item to change up the rotation.

Easy; not exploding in flavor, but my guy doesn't like a lot of sauce/spice. Browned turkey & mixed together (noodles uncooked). Added a few shakes of pepper, minced onion, & garlic salt and an extra can of soup. I used canned corn so just left in all the juice in my mix to soften up the noodles. Cut up baby carrots & added about a 1/4 cup of water. It ended up fitting in one medium square baking dish for me & one smaller one.

i liked this. i agree with a lot of other reviewers that one can of cream of mushroom soup isn't enough, and used a can of regular, and a can of reduced sodium, because they were what i had on hand. i also added some garlic salt. it was pretty quick and easy and tasted pretty good. i'll probably make it again.

There was not near enough "sauce" in this dish.  It was quite dry.  It has the potential for a good dish, but it's a bit lacking.

Very good recipe!  I also added 2 cans of the soup and some peas and carrots for more vegetables.  Just before baking, I put a thin layer of French's "french fried onion" on top and it tasted great.  It reminds me of tuna noodle casserole without the tuna.

It's not bad, super easy to make but a little bland.  I used two cans of soup also.  It just feels like it needs something.

This is a good, base comfort food. I followed the other reviewer's suggestions and used two cans of soup (I used one can of celery and one of mushroom) and also used grated mozzarella. I added green onions to the turkey and grated carrot to the casserole mixture. This is going to be a good one to use when I'm pressed for time!!

The flavor was bland and with the amount of noodles to cream of mushroom ratio the mixture was dry. I could barely bring myself to eat it!

After reading that it was sometimes dry I added about a 1/2 cup each of sour cream and plain yogurt, 1/4 cup half and half, some frozen green beans, 3 handfuls of shredded cheese, and browned the turkey with herbs de provence for more flavor.  I also topped it with panko bread crumbs and a sprinkling of garlic salt and black pepper.  3 stars for flavor plus another star for convenience.

I did an ingredient search looking for a recipe to use leftover turkey with mushroom soup. this came up. great with cut up turkey.after reading reviews i added paprika, parsley,garlic powder,chopped celery, diced onion, crushed crackers on top. it was sooo good. i had one plate and my honey ate 3 plates full. it's all gone. i used about 1/2 the pasta recipe called for as well and 2 cans of soup.

When I read the recipe I could see why others thought it was bland.  I decided to use Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning and it was AWESOME.  I highly recommend it.  I added 2 stalks of diced celery, 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic and roughly 12 oz of frozen shoepeg corn.  I didn't have any onion on hand so I used some dried minced onion as well.  We definitely did not use all of the pasta that had been recommended (maybe 12 oz).  We also chose penne instead of egg noodles.  Much more hearty...    We used 1 can of cream of celery and a 1/2 can of cream of mushroom and added 1/3 cup of milk.      Next time we thought we'd try using some green chiles or mexicorn mix.   Hope this helps spice up the recipe for others!

I followed the recipe fairly close and even added some extra mayo and sour cream, but the noodles in the casserole never cooked all the way.  The top half of the casserole was hard and strange.  The flavor was good, so I think next time I will precook the noodles a little before putting it in the oven.

I have been making a variation of this casserole for years.  I use a package of ground beef instead of turkey.  I also use a can of cream of mushroom and also a can of cream of celery.  I add onion, 2 cloves-minced-of garlic, onion, 1 cup milk and for taste, I add seasoned salt and whatever else i feel like adding.  2 stalk chopped celery add some nice texture.  I also put everything into a pan (browned burger) and cook it all together.  When finished, I top with cheese on the plate.  I love this stuff!!!

This was definitely a yummy comfort food.  I used low-sodium cream of chicken soup (2cans and 1 can of water) and then added a few sprinkles of cayenne.  My kids said it reminded them of Thanksgiving in a bowl.  Will definitely make again.

This is a good meal for a night when you don't have time or energy to make anything complicated. I use whole wheat pasta and add some more veggies to make it a little more nutritious. My toddler loves the simplicity of this and my husband will eat it too. It's nothing gourmet but definitely good, weeknight comfort food.

I thought that this recipe was great!!
I would just suggest using Beef instead of Turkey. And try flavoring the meat while it's cooking. Also it's good to add just a little milk to make it somewhat creamy. I would deffinatly make it again!! And I encouage all of you to try it!!

Good flavor, but I suggest including about three or four LESS cups of noodles.  Next time I will also add a little milk to make it more creamy and less pasty.  Bake for at least 30 minutes.

I too had to add an additional can of mushroom soup. And since the recipe didn't tell you whether or not to add a can of water, I didn't. It was a tasty casserole.

This was really easy to make, but I substituted ground beef for the turkey, and 2 cans of potato soup instead of the cream of mushroom, and my husband loved it!  (he's a meat and potatoes kind of guy...)

I agree with the previous review!  The casserole turned out very dry - I would suggest an extra can of soup.  Also, I wasn't exactly crazy about the mix of flavors.  It was ok though, makes a ton of food and is pretty cheap.

I added one can of milk with the cream of mushroom soup.  And added creamed corn and peas to this. Sprinkled some cheese in it too.  Very good! Needed a 13" x 9" glass pan though. A lot of food! Will make again.

Had this for supper tonight. Everyone (even the incredibly picky teenager) liked it! We used turkey sausage and didn't even have to add any seasoning. We also put grated cheese on top. 

Next time we will add milk or a second can of soup. Great dish!

I added shredded turkey and cut up an onion and used half a cup of turkey broth so it wouldn't be dry.  I also added my own seasonings to taste. Onion powder, garlic powder, season salt and pepper.

As written, this recipe is good for fussy kids and husbands. However, next time I make this I will definitely add more seasonings to the meat and the soup mixture. I used cream of chicken soup and put grated cheese on top.

This is a great, quick, and very filling dish! Of course made slight changes/additions. Instead of Egg Noodles, I used Spaghetti because that's all I had at the time. I added potatos because I needed to cook them before they spoiled. I used two cans of Cream of Mushroom Soup and added water to cut down on some of the thickness. Seasoned it with Season-All, Garlic Powder, Ground Black Pepper, and Paprika for some color. It's amazing!

This was EASY! I already had leftover egg noodles and I had 2 patties leftover from Travis's Turkey Burgers with a Bite! So, I crumbled them up and followed the recipe, using creamed corn. I also added some pepperjack cheese on top! This was so good with garlic bread to scoop it up!

We didn't really enjoy it the first time, but are willing to try again. I tried someone's suggestion of using uncooked noodles and adding more fluid and it didn't work that well. We will try it the next time as written.

This was an easy recipe that my picky eaters really liked.  It's great as a leftover too. I did add a little bit of ground sage to the turkey to give it a bit more taste...it didn't need much!!
