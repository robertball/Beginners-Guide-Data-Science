We loved this one!  I had bone-in chops on hand so I used those.  I also subbed apple juice for the apple cider, which worked out beautifully.  As it was reducing I became impatient and decided to thicken it slightly to a glaze consistency with a cornstarch/water slurry.  Both Hubs and I really enjoyed these and I will definitely be making them again!  Thank you Chef John!

Very good, tangy flavor.  When I think of a glaze I usually like a sticky, almost crispy coating, this didn't cook down and coat the pork chops like a glaze would.  But all in all very simple and great taste!

I don't eat meat, so I have no instinct for cooking it.  I made these for my family and they loved it.  Really simple.

These pork chops were DELICIOUS!!  Everyone in my family LOVED them, including my 4 year old.  He kept asking for more "poke chops" haha! I made this recipe as directed.  I know someone mentioned in their review that they didn't really get a sticky glaze, but I absolutely did.  You just have to be patient with the reduction.  Also - if you are considering using dried rosemary that you have in your spice rack, I would implore you to use fresh rosemary instead.  Nothing beats the taste when you use fresh spices (in anything really.  In my opinion a totally different flavor than when you use the dried spices that come in your spice rack!  Rosemary has become one of my favorite spices but only when fresh and it's a wonderful addition in this recipe!!  Thanks chef John for a superb recipe!  This is definitely going into our regular rotation.

It takes a lot longer to reduce the sauce.  More like 20 minutes at medium heat instead of 3 to 4. Great tasting!  I'd make it again.

We made a variation of this recipe and it was dynamite!  Didn't have apple cider on hand so added 1/2 cup plain unsweetened applesauce plus 1 tsp. honey (didn't need to reduce the sauce).  We also skipped the mustard and red pepper because we didn't think the kids would like them (didn't matter - they didn't like the vinegar smell so didn't want the sauce anyway, but were perfectly happy with the plain pork chops).  But don't skip the rosemary - it really brought all the tastes together.

This was really easy to make. I loved the complex flavor. However you must cook the glaze down longer than stated in order for it to thicken.

Just searched around and was so happy to find this recipe again.  I won't forget to save it in my recipe box this time!  I made it about a month ago and have been thinking about it since then.  So juicy, flavorful, and perfect for autumn.  Not cloyingly sweet like many apple and pork recipes.  A 5-star review means a lot from me--I'm a tough critic.  But even my hubby raved about this recipe.  WTG Chef John!

This is one of my top ten recipes. my family loves it, the only addition I make to it is that I chop  two or three apples into cubes and add it when pouring the cider, the apples cook and taste amazing. 

I really enjoy John's videos very clear and excellent.

Fabulous taste. Took considerable longer to reduce the sauce for me, possibly down to different types of cider? With that in mind, I'll wait to add the rosemary next time. It added a great flavor, but wound up a bit bitter due to the longer cooking time. Thanks for the recipe!

I really did not like this at all, nor did anyone in my family.  The apple cider vinegar was overwhelming. Also, the glaze remained liquidy and less glaze-like after cooking down for 4 minutes, so I added cornstarch and tried to fix the glaze.

Easy recipe and a lovely flavor. The chops where juicy and tender and the glaze went well on the pasta I served with the chops. I will no doubt make this again. I followed almost to the tee this recipe except I only used 3 chops and I used chops with a bone.

I really liked it and I'm not a big fan of pork chops. The glaze was sweet and I liked the flavor. I made the glaze first because I knew it would take awhile to reduce and I didn't want the pork chops to get cold. (Cold food is my biggest peeve). It took about 10-15 min to reduce the sauce but it did so beautifully, then I transferred it to a bowl so people could spoon as much as they wanted. Then I threw the pork chops in to cook and put the Rosemary and red pepper flakes on them instead of in the sauce. Easy to make and I'd do it again.

Made this for dinner tonight and husband couldn't stop raving about it.  I made a few simple adjustments.  Coconut oil instead of vegetable oil to make it healthier.  I didn't have enough rosemary on hand so I used italian seasoning too.  I did slightly less red pepper flakes then a full tsp for the kids but they still thought it was too spicy.  Next time I'll try just a 1/4-1/2 tsp.  I also had to add cornstarch to thicken.  Maybe it was my preference but I prefer the glaze to be more of a sauce.  All very minor adjustments yet still incredibly simple recipe - highly recommend!!

Everybody liked this one. Sauce is delicious. I didn't have dijon on hand so used regular mustard. In place of apple cider (which I also did not have on hand), used Boiled Cider (1/4 to 1/3 cup) from King Arthur Flour site. This syrup is thick, so sauce thickened nicely in minutes. T-a-s-t-y!

I made it for one pork chop, halving the ingredients, and it does take longer than the 3-4 minutes to reduce and thicken the sauce/glaze. It was very good.

But the second time I made it, I replaced the apple cider with apple juice (more sugar to sweeten and darken the glaze) and tossed in some dried cranberries. Even better! Just remember to allow longer for the glaze to thicken however you make it, unless you prfer the thinner sauce.

Best pork chop EVER.  The only thing I did differently was like in his video I did add some herb de provence with the salt and pepper mix and only cooked four chops.  Like some of the other comments, it also took 20+ minutes for the sauce to reduce and become glaze.  Because of the length of time, I put my chops on a plate and in the oven on the lowest temp possible.  Just enough to keep them warm.  I served with sage stuffing and green beans.  Just happened to have the stuffing/dressing wouldn't have thought to serve with them, but so glad I did.  Yum!  This recipe definitely going into the mix.  This would certainly impress dinner quests.  In Chef John's words, "Enjoy".

The flavor of the apple cider vinegar was overpowering. Net time, i might add 1/2 cup of the wine to 1 cup of gravy.

Had some apple cider left over from the cold weather and was looking for a recipe to help use it up.  This was a nice find. I adjusted the recipe for 4 chops, I had two large bone-in chops.  The sauce was very flavorful. It did take me 20 mins to reduce to a glaze, no cornstarch needed as some said they used.  Just be patient, it's worth the flavor. When browning the chops, make sure not to over cook and you'll have juicy chops. Worked well with a nice fruity white wine.

I just made a restaurant quality meal with this recipe.  Thank you!!   Pairing it with roasted veggies - red potatoes, carrots and green beans, with a little glaze on the potatoes, was wonderful!

"reduces quickly to a thick, rich, sweet-tart apple syrup." NOT! I have made this several times and think it would be fair to say "eventually reduces to a thick, rich sweet-tart apple syrup". Tastes great!

This was quick and easy to make. And even my 12 year old who turns his nose up at pork cleaned his plate. The reduction took a bit longer than 3-4 minutes, but did eventually glaze. It probably took more like 10-12.  Agree the rosemary is a great addition. Not many rosemary lovers in our house but no one commented.  We served with sweet potatoes and a wilted spinach salad.  It's a keeper.

My husband can't stop talking about how good these are.  I followed the directions to the letter,  but the timing for the reduction was way off. It took about 15 minutes total.   
Very yummy recipe that I'll use often!

Loved this recipe! The mix of the sweet, sour, and spicy really came through! The dijon addition was especially delicious paired with the apple cider and vinegar. I coated the chops with a bit of gluten-free flour to form a nice crust. In Chef John's video he mentions that the black pepper mixture had a little bit of herb de provence (not part of the recipe)- but I decided to add a little bit since I had some on hand. I served it over some smashed red potatoes and raw granny smith apple & carrots. To me it added crunch and was a fresh component that complimented the sauce. I will definitely make this again!

Hubby loved this. It took about 35 minutes for the glaze to reduce to a thick consistency, so plan ahead for that! I made the glaze separately, browned the chops and then poured the glaze over a couple minutes before serving.

Fantastic recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  I did have some thyme left over for the mashed potatoes and added a pinch of those to the seasoning.  Usually I will leave out anything spicy but I have to say - I am very happy I didn't.  The glaze was the star of the show - the sweet, the spicy and the slight tartness was a perfect blend.  It seemed to have taken me longer to thicken the sauce but it got there eventually!  

Also, I know you said you have used apple juice before - I was glad you mentioned that because there was no apple cider to be found at the store.  The juice worked just fine.  Next time, however, I will have to use the apple cider!  

Another excellent recipe with fantastic narration!

I made this last night exactly as the recipe calls for...when I tasted the glaze I felt that I needed to add a little extra Dijon mustard and a pinch of brown sugar, because we like things sweet. This was an amazing recipe!!!! Definitely something different for pork! We absolutely loved it! The glaze does take longer than 4 minutes to reduce but be patient it's worth the wait! Thanks so much for this recipe, we will definitely be putting this in our normal meal rotation!!!

This was Great!  I only added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce up.

I will make this again - with a few changes.  I eliminated the rosemary and used spicy brown mustard since I was out of dijon.  I also added a chopped shallot in addition to the garlic.  While the sauce was cooking down, I added 1 small chopped apple.

This was amazing.  My husband said it was "one of my best meals"! Another Chef John spectacular! Did it a second time and this time I added a sliced apple after the vinegar and then added a pinch of ground ginger to the spices!  A little corn starch helped thicken the sauce really will.  Just delicious!

Well, I only had 4 bone-in chops, so although I adjusted, the smaller pan may have led to slower reduction, so I cheated and added a wee bit of cornstarch. Despite these modifications, the dish was outrageous!

I am thinking this will be a 5 star.  I am waiting to try this recipe because it looks wonderful.  Just wondering what I could use instead of rosemary, as neither my husband nor myself like it.  Would appreciate ideas!  Thanks

So much flavor and so easy! Wife and I both cleaned our plates to keep from missing any of that yummy glaze, and it paired well with some creamy, lightly salty risotto. Even though I used a cheapo sale cut of pork that turned out very tough, it somehow wasn't at all dry and the gooey caramelized crust of reduced glaze made it a lot more satisfying to chew through, lol.

While my reduction took more then 4 minutes, it didn't take more than ten for it to get down to an almost syrupy texture. Maybe it's just because I halved the recipe for our small household, but I would also definitely advise getting that heat up nice and high and not being shy about boiling it, as if you were making some caramel.

Final note, the recipe doesn't suffer if you omit the chili flakes, if you don't tolerate spiciness well.

This has become a staple in our dinners. My husband and I just love the apple glaze gravy. The fresh rosenary is a must! I have made it without but it makes alot of difference. The only downside is mine always takes so long to reduce. I have it on a med heat with a slight boil but it still takes  at least 15-20mins. Either way its totally worth it!!

I needed to boil the glaze for 8 minutes rather than 4 to thicken it. Perhaps my medium-hot was more medium than the recipe writer's.

I used hard apple cider instead of apple cider, because that's what I had in the house. And I used 1 teaspoon of Caribbean jerk seasoning instead of 1 teaspoon rosemary because I don't generally like rosemary very much. The jerk spice blend substitution worked very well for me. And the longer slower boil to thicken also worked just fine.

I reduced the apple cider  for a slightly longer period of time over lower heat.  This changed the caramelization of the Apple cider sugars, and lead to a slightly sweeter taste in the glaze which my fellow diners really enjoyed.

I added  1 chopped Gala apple to the glaze and just before the glaze was finished I smashed the apples with the spatula. If you want a sticky glaze and not vinegary broth, allow to reduce about 30 minutes over medium heat. It will still boil but the sugars in apple cider/juice won't burn.

Excellent!  I made the sauce EXACTLY as written, but changed other items a bit (the sauce is what makes this recipe).  I had chicken legs and thighs on hand (4 thighs, 6 legs), so browned those instead of pork.  Put them in a roasting pan, and added sliced acorn squash and fresh brussels sprouts.  Reduced the sauce (yes, it took quite a bit longer than 3-4 minutes - I went to the garden to pick the brussels sprouts while the sauce was reducing), and poured the sauce over everything.  I was afraid that there wouldn't be enough sauce, but the juices from the chicken and veggies added a bit of liquid.  Roasted at 350 during happy hour, then turned up the oven to 450 just to caramelize everything a bit more.  YUMMY!  I did not think the sauce was vinegary as some have noted, and there was enough sauce to cover the chicken and veggies...  Keeper!

Followed the exact recipe.  Used apple juice (all I had in the house). Took about 20 minutes for glaze to thicken but worth the wait.  Amazing results.

These pork chops are so yummy. Never been a fan of pork chops, the only way I will eat them is with an apple glaze, so this was perfect for me. Thank you again for another delicious recipe Chef John.

My teenage son said that this was "the bomb!"  That's teen-speak for awesome. Truly...we were dipping our pork into the pan to get the last of the drippings. Yes, it did take longer to reduce than indicated, but I was patient, and stirred it occasionally with a whisk, finally adding back the (bone-in) pork chops before it actually thickened. But by the time I turned them (2 minutes) the sauce was thick and dark. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I make this recipe often. Only problem I have is the cooking time. I use different size chops with this recipe. I recommend you to carefully watch how long you cook the chops.

My pkg. only had 4 chops so that's what I went with. I also didn't have any minced Rosemary on hand so I used the powder. I love button mushrooms with dishes such as this, so I sautéed them with the chops. I didn't salt the mushrooms until after they had browned.could not find apple cider in the stores (seasonal), so I used apple juice.i had no problem with my glaze thickening, as you can see. The recipe says to reduce it for about 25 minutes. I read some reviews that said they cooked it for 4 minutes & it wouldn't reduce or thicken, so they used cornstarch. Read the recipe & try doing what it says! I loved this recipe! I will make it again. I made it after seeing it on page 28 of the Sept./ Oct. issue of Allrecipes magazine.

Made this for my family tonight and it was delicious. Two cooking tips:  1) If you use a thinner cut of meat, adjust cooking time accordingly; and 2) Prior to cooking, ensure that your meat thermometer has not been mangled in your garbage disposal. I hope to make this again next week and apply these lessons. I hope also to make a good apple salad like in the video.

Great recipe!  My kids raved about it.  And easy!! Definitely will be serving this often.  I used garlic powder instead but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Glaze does take longer than 3-4 minutes to reduce.

Two thumbs up from my hubby… this will definitely stay in our recipe box … easy week night supper.  There are only 2 of us, so I only used 2 chops and cut the sauce ingredients in half.  The only "tweak" I made was to add cornstarch & water to thicken - it wasn't thickening on it's own.  This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Served it with cabbage braised in vegetable broth -- yummy!

When I put the garlic in it burned so wait for your own to cool down a while. Also, it took forever for the liquid to reduce.  It ended up very liquids. The top of the pork was somewhat flavorful but not the rest. I don't know what I did wrong.

The hardest part of this recipe was not over cooking the pork chops. I used apple juice instead of apple cider. The flavor was great! I'm normally not a fan of pork, but this recipe has changed my mind.

Allow plenty of time as the sauce takes easily 20-30 min to reduce. Loved the results - worth the effort.  I used whole pork tenderloins, browned nicely per recipe and then put them in the oven at 400 to finish (took about 20 min). That gave me plenty of time to cook down sauce, which is excellent.

Great recipe.  I too, found that the sauce was a bit thin at first, but continued to simmer longer then recommended, and it thickened up quite nicely. The flavor was perfect. Thanks Chef John

Loved it! Sweet and spicy, two of my favorite flavors.  I found this recipe easy and convenient.  My two kids loved and I will definitely be saving this recipe.  My only advice to those try this one is to really be patient and let meat simmer in the sauce on low heat.  Thank you Chef John

I love anything made by Chef John, but maybe it's because I did mine in the crock pot, but the sauce was like water, & did not thicken at all, even tho I cooked it in the fry pan for at least 10 min. Taste is OK - but not up to his usual level...

This had a lot of flavor and turned out well. My husband is an EXTREMELY picky eater and he went back for more 3 times. I didn't have rosemary but I thought it was just fine without it. I served these with a salad that had cut up Fuji apples on it and an apple vinaigrette dressing as well as some scalloped potatoes on the side. Thank you for sharing Chef John.

Loved these. I added apples and celery to the pan when I flipped the pork chops over. Added a little grated fresh ginger to the sauce and thickened it up with a tablespoon of corn starch dissolved into a fourth cup of water. The sauce was great over mashed potatoes as a side. This one will be going into my regular rotation. Make sure you use bone-in chops.

Nice, tasty fall dish.  Like others, my glaze did not thicken, but that may be due to the addition of  dried cranberries and a chopped apple.  Thick glaze or not, the flavor was delicious and a perfect pairing with the pork.  Served with oven fried fingerling potatoes and definitely buttered peas. Will definitely make again.

Ok so I had to change some/a lot of stuff due to not having enough of things.  But apparently my family loved it and demanded that I make it again.  So I hope I can remember what I did.  Basically just dumping things in.
I have a large crew so I used 7 thin bone in chops and 4 boneless.  I sear them all in a mixture of olive oil and butter.  I placed them in 9X13 baking dish.  In the pan juices I browned 1 1/2 tbsp of minced garlic.   I then put in about a 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar, and didnt have any apple cider so I had about a 1 cup apple juice.  The flavor was a bit bland so I added 1 pack of beefy onion soup mix and about 2 tbsp of maple balsamic.(been itching to use it in something.  After letting the mixture reduce a bit, I then poured the sauce over the chops, covered the baking pan with foil and put in in the oven at 350 degrees for aprox. 1 1/2 hours.  The bones fell out when we served it with stuffing and brussel sprouts  YUM!!

Made this for dinner today...it was amazing! Bonus .....I was able to use fresh cut rosemary from my little herb garden!  As apple cider isn't available this time of year I used apple juice....worked fine. Also is does take longer for the glaze to reduce than stated in the recipe.

The pork chops were great.  Our chops were very thick, so I had to brown them in the pan & move them to the oven.  I used the apple juice substitute, and had to use cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  BUT....we used the extra sauce/gravy on top of rice.....and it was too vinegary for the rice.

My wife and I liked this recipe very much. It was extremely easy and tasted great.
The next time I will coat the chops with flour to help browning as well as thickening the glaze.
I will make it again.

My husband and I both loved it.. I went heavy on the pepper to add a little spice to it.  Like others, my reduction didn't thicken too much but we didn't mind it.  We had it with rice and broccoli so having the sauce was terrific.

I made this exactly as directed.  The flavor was wonderful.  It does take more than 3 to 4 minutes to reduce 2 -1/4 c of liquid, though.  Turn up the heat for a rapid boil, and allow a bit more time.

Everyone in my family loved this dish!  It does take longer than the recipe indicated to reduce the sauce, I think it was about 15 - 20 minutes, but it is delicious once it finally thickens.

Very good! I had apple cider on-hand & was looking for a use for it. The sauce was especially good. I will definitely use the recipe again.

Good for something different. I also used apple juice instead of cider.

I did't have apple cider so I used apple juice instead.  The sauce did take longer to reduce so I added 1 tbs of corn starch slurry and it came out great.  The flavor was wonderful and I used fresh rosemary from my herb Garden.  Easy and delicious!  Will make again.

I made this about a week ago and it was delicious. 
I sent the recipe to my son who made it also and they found it delicious too.
A keeper that I will do again

Loved this! Made it with thinly sliced pork chops and reduced cooking time to 3 minutes per side. Didn't have apple cider so used apple juice. Also omitted the rosemary and red pepper flakes due to my family's taste (but I think that it would have been delicious!)

As most of the other reviews state, the sauce needs more time and/or cornstarch to achieve the right consistency (I wound up doing both), but  flavors were lovely.

We didn't like this one. The pork was pretty tough and didn't have any flavor. I used a little corn starch in the end and that helped thicken up the glaze, but this one just wasn't a keeper for us.

I liked this recipe, but would be happier with a couple of changes next time.  First, it was too tangy, so I would reduce the apple cider vinegar to 1 Tbs, reduce the garlic to 1 clove, and reduce the rosemary to 1/2 tsp.  I reduced the apple cider to 1 cup and added 1 cup of applesauce because I like applesauce with pork.  My pork was way too thick and it took forever to cook all the way through in the pan.  Next time, I would either cover the pan or roast them in the oven.  I would definitely make this again with these changes.

I made this tonight for dinner, I used pork tenderloin instead of chops! I mainly wanted to have the glaze! It turned out beyond amazing! I did tweak the recipe to my taste just a bit, it was a bit too tangy for me so I added brown sugar and some honey! I used the oil and butter and seared my tenderloin in it and then transferred it to a roasting pan and finished it in the oven with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika, covered and added apple juice while it cooked! For the glaze - I followed the recipe exactly except I didn’t put in the crushed red pepper, and added the honey and brown sugar! I let it reduce for probably about a half hour and it was reduced to about half, but still kind of thin, so I made a corn starch water slurry and added it and it was perfect! All in all this glaze was amazing and I’m so glad I tried it with the tenderloin! This is definitely a new one added into our rotation!

This was so good! My family loved it! The only thing I did different was that I left out the Dijon mustard because we don't like it. It also took longer for the sauce to reduce and thicken, about 20 minutes. I served it with green bean casserole. Definitely a keeper!

For my rub, I used equal parts Lawry's seasoned salt, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, cinnamon and pumpkin pie seasoning!  After rubbing on both sides so chops, I browned on both sides in olive oil, then poured some Worchestire sauce over followed by the fresh apple cider. I covered the skillet with a lid, turning the chops about halfway through the 24 minute cooking time.  They look carmelized just like the photo.  Fantastic!

delicious - I cut it down to 2  servings  and made it   for 2  -
I  took a thick loin pork chop and sliced  length wise --  I think next time  I will   make more sauce and I   had apple juice-- so made it w/ that -- will  make again .

Oh my Goodness this is the best recipe ever!  I am bad about not leaving reviews, but I had to take the time on this one!  I made exactly like the recipe with the exception I used 1/4 t rosemary instead of fresh.  Easy and so few ingredients.  Sometimes less really is better.

Chef John does it again!  This is a great recipe for pork chops and I will be making it again.  I did have a problem getting the sauce to thicken.  I followed the directions exactly but it still wouldn't thicken so I just used  some cornstarch and that did the trick.  I'm always looking for new and unique ways to cook pork and this one is now added to my collection.  Thanks Chef John for always coming up with easy ways to wow my family.

My chops turned out well. It took longer for the glaze to thicken, about 20 min.  Next time I would use half the amount of vinegar but that's because I like the sweeter side.  It turned out great and I'm am going to make this again.

It was better than OK - if I made them again I would simmer the chops in the sauce longer to make the chops more tender.

These were exceptionally good pork chops.  Two things: I added the pork chops back to the reducing cider after it had boiled for about 5 minutes to be sure they were cooked through as I had bone-in chops and it does take about 20 minutes for the cider to reduce down to a nice glaze.  I didn't have Dijon mustard, so used a spicy mustard.

This tasted delicious! I put less vinegar in than called for simply  because I was out, but the recipe is very forgiving. I also ommitted the rosmary. I too grew impatient waiting for the sauce to thicken and added cornstarch, but that could've been due to the fact I used less vinegar than called for.

I make the recipe as written and this is my favorite. It's an easy way to fancy up pork chops with minimal effort.

This was extremely tasty! I found that I needed to reduce the glaze for far longer than the recipe suggests. My only complaint is that my chops did not turn out as juicy as I hoped. Next time I'll cook the chops for less than 5 minutes per side at the start of the recipe.

Good recipe but it takes a lot longer than 3 or 4 minutes  to reduce the sauce.

Made it as is (except halved) and we all loved it. Great flavor and the leftover sauce can be drizzled over the chops. Great recipe!

A new flavor for us but we really liked it and will make it again. I did not make changes to the ingredients but found out that leaving the chops in the sauce towards the end  as it is thickening  makes them more tender and gives them extra flavor. It did take quite a bit more time to get it down to the glaze but the flavor really intensifies beautifully! Once I put my skillet on my copper diffuser the glaze came along much faster. Thanks for this delicious recipe, Chef John!

The whole family loved these. The only alteration I did was I sliced a large onion and peeled and sliced an apple thinly.  I cooked the onions after removing the chops. After a few minutes I added the apples and the rest of the ingredients. This was so simple and quite quick. I did cook the sauce for about 20 minutes. It thicker nicely. Thanks for the great meal.

I didn't like it because the glaze never really thickened. Just stayed a cidery soup for over 10minutes on high heat.

Great sauce.  Two things I'll do different next time-be mindful of exactly how long my chops cook (mine were dry-145 degrees as per the video-I went to the garden for chives and they were overcooked at 160!) and I'll add more salt to the sauce while cooking.  I wasn't sure about adding onions to this as some reviewers did, but I think I will also add those next time.  Thanks for another great meal, Chef John!

We found this very good but not over the top.   I think I would have liked a more carmely/sweet glaze, with just a slight salty flavor.   Thank you Chef John.

I made this without rosemary or crushed red pepper (kids don't like either spice) and added a slurry of 1 T cornstarch to 1/4c of the called-for apple cider. This recipe is delicious! The pork chops were cooked perfect, the quantity of sauce was just right, and the cornstarch made the sauce texture perfect with close to the called for cook time. I might make this again this week because it was so good! Thank you for the recipe.

This is a pretty good recipe!  Pork chops are always on sale at my grocer so I'm always looking for new ways to cook them. This had a lot of flavor and was so simple to make. I only omitted the herb, because I'm not a fan. Served with some lumpy red mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. Yum!

Made this last night - a cool, fall evening - and it really hit the spot. The flavor combination of apple vinegar & apple cider was sublime. Reducing took a while but was well worth it. I did decide to add a peeled, cut up Fuji apple to the mix after removing the pork chops but before reducing the sauce - it turned out absolutely delicious. I served it with roasted baby carrots & potatoes and green beans and a nice Pinot Gris. I'll definitely make this again soon. Thanks for another winner Chef John!!!

I made this exactly as written and it's delicious. The cider reduction takes about 25 minutes so that was the perfect time to pop some rice in the microwave for 20 minutes so it finished on time. This recipe is a keeper.

Awesome flavor and a nice fall twist on good 'ol pork chops. Next time I'll do it with half the sauce ingredients (and not spend quite as long reducing it.) It made a little more sauce than I needed.

This is awesome!!  Made exactly like recipe.  No problem letting glaze cook.....took 25 min.  I sauteed mushrooms in a separate pan and added them when I added the pork chops into the sauce.  GOOD DECISION.  They were wonderful.  You will not be disappointed.....they are spectacular.

This is a great recipe. I've made it several times now. I use apple juice just because I always have it in the fridge. It does take about a while to reduce the glaze and I add a little slurry of cornstarch & water to thicken it up a little more. Very good, thanks Chef John!

Loved the end result. Tasty tasty. Have repeated making this many times and find that it takes a lot longer to reduce sauce but that's ok as the chops turned out moist, tender and flavorful.

My husband and I liked this recipe. I used thin pork chops and they cooked faster than the more usual thickness chops so they were a bit overcooked. The sauce did not thicken even when cooked another 15 minutes. A little flour or cornstarch probably could have thickened it a bit. My husband enjoyed the first small chop and ate a second one!

Easy, fast, and quite delicious. I will definitely make this again.  I did not have apple cider so I had to cheat a little and use apple juice instead. Even so,  it was excellent.

I noticed some people mentioned they had trouble getting it to reduce.  I used a really big flat frying pan and it reduced quite quickly to a lovely thick glaze

I doubled the recipe twice(x4), and put it over a 10# roasted pork loin. Everyone loved it. I will be serving this at our family Christmas dinner!

Making this again tonight!  I use thick, bone-chops so i simmer them in the sauce to cook through.  I also reduce the sauce down after rrmoving chops  in order to concentrate flavors and thicken sauce.  This is a 5star recipe for flavor, ease of preparation and presentation.

I have made this recipe with no changes to it several times. Definitely has become a favorite in my household with the hubby and picky eating kids. Have also made it with boneless skinless chicken breasts and it's delicious with the chicken. I will say that the sauce takes longer than stated to form a thick consistency. Using fresh rosemary gives it a different taste than dry rosemary, so if I don't have the fresh rosemary I usually just skip it and it still takes fine.

I tend not to follow recipes closely, but I did and no way will this reduce  in a few minutes;  more like 30 minutes;  I loved the taste but I'll probably cut the apple cider to a cup and see what happens.

My husband & kids (3&4) loved this!! I used boneless pork tenderloin and followed the recipe exactly except for I forgot to add the butter at the beginning so I finished the sauce off with a little butter.  Definitely will be making this again. Next time I may add some chopped apples to the sauce.

Added honey, fresh minced ginger with the garlic, and 1/2 cup applesauce to the apple cider.  Omitted the red pepper flakes.  My family raved about how yummy it was!!  It's a keeper.

Easy, delicious. Served with plain cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, which tasted great with the glaze on the plate. My partner, who hasn't followed too many recipes, did a great job making this.

I followed the recipe exactly, but for as long as the glaze took to reduce down it still did not coat the pork chops as much as I was expecting. it was pretty good, but not worth the time in my opinion.

I made this on a whim last night and I just had to log back into allrecipes, after years of not commenting on anything, so I can brag about how good it was. I mean - AMAHHHZINGLY good. My boyfriend hates ACV and he loved these. I will say it took me longer to reduce the glaze than depicted in Chef John's video, like others have noted, but no big deal! The narration was very clear and lighthearted, which I appreciated. So yea, I'm making it again tonight...and probably next weekend too because this recipe is, quite simply, the bomb. It smells heavenly, it tastes divine, and its unbelievably easy to make (why make life more difficult than it has to be?). I would feel comfortable making this for anyone I wanted to impress with my amateur culinary skills, even in favor of some of the more time/labor intensive recipes I've defaulted to for such occasions in the past. I've considered getting a little creative and using some of the hard apple cider I have on hand and see how that goes as well.

I'll definitely be looking into more of Chef John's recipes if this one is any indication of the rest. Mmmhmmm.

This was really tasty. As others mentioned, the sauce takes at least 20 minutes to reduce, even at a rolling boil. The sauce by itself tasted very sweet, but over the pork it was perfect.

Made this for dinner and it was delicious! I too used Apple juice and thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch. I added a little more red pepper which gave it a kick. Served with couscous and steamed Brussels sprouts and it was a great meal!

I would give this 10 stars I used stone ground Dijon and followed recipe. I used organic vinegar and cider. I agree it takes more than a few minutes to reduce more like 20 at high heat but the finished result was amazing. So happy I tried it. Definitely a keeper. Thank You Chef John

This recipe sounded great and smelled great while cooking, but it was just not good at all.  The sauce never thickened up and the flavor was very bland.  I would NOT recommend this recipe to anyone.

I am not a huge pork chop lover, but my husband is.  This was easy to make and the flavor was really nice...I served it with butternut squash and snap peas.  Visually it looked like a lovely plate of food, and even my sometimes picky teenagers proclaimed it a "do over."

We loved this recipe! We'll make it again, for sure. I think I'll cook the chops in a broth, though, to make them a little more tender. My family thought they were perfect; I thought they could have been a bit more tender.

Delicious.  Took longer than expected to reduce the glaze but worth it.

This was really good, and being a novice cook I was surprised I was able to pull it off. But I was, and the only learning process was about reducing the apple cider mix into a yummy sweet gravy. But even that worked, although next time I think I will handle that part of it better. So combining the high yum factor with the ease of making, I give this one 5 stars.

Loved the taste but could not get the sauce to a glaze.  I see in another review that it took about 20 minutes to thicken it.  I did add flour but to no avail.  I will put this in my list of favorites though because the taste was awesome...

Simple, delicious and flexible. I chopped up some extra apples and onion to add to the glaze which soaked up the flavor wonderfully. I didn't have red pepper flakes so I used sriracha and I used apple juice in place of apple cider. Will make again!

Love this recipe! Of the new recipes I've tried lately, our kids liked this one the best. The sauce/ glaze was tangy and went perfectly with the pork chops.

This is very good as written.  I followed the directions exctly the first time I made this and it was outstanding.  The second time I used olive oil instead of the butter/oil and apple sauce with honey instead of the cider (couldn't find any), and it was not good.

My husband didn't like the sauce...I think it was the rosemary.  I though it was Ok.  I had thick chops,,,took awhile to cook.  Won't cook again.  I tried it give it 3 stars, it wouldn't take it.

Simple and delicious!  The only changes I made were that I used bone-in loin chops, and had to substitute herbes de provence for the rosemary (it's just what I had on hand.)  It also took a bit longer than stated for the sauce to reduce down. My slightly-picky husband said that he thought it was just a bit too "tangy" at first so maybe I'll cut down on the vinegar next time.  Other than that, perfect!

This recipe is a keeper.  I'm not a fan of pork chops but these came out great.  I followed the recipe to a T except that I always season pork chops with chili powder.  That's the only thing I altered.  Will definitely make again...soon!  Thanks Chef John!

Solid recipe! Extremely easy and surprisingly FULL of flavor! I don't even like apple juice/apple cider, but this was a great combination of ingredients.
