I was looking for a bread pudding recipe that was moist and more on the custardy side.  Husband says that most bread puddings are too dry. When I made this he was very happy!  I took it to a potluck and everyone loved the recipe.  I made it twice and both times it came out deliciously.  This is a very rich recipe... the only thing I did differntly than the recipe is to increase the cinnamon by 1 tsp.  I used what is called Hawaiian Sweet Bread.  This recipe is definitely ONO and a keeper.

I made this Christmas Eve and served it with homemade whipping cream and fresh raspberries. My husband's 88 year-old grandma said it was the best bread pudding she had ever eaten. It was so simple to make. I used vanilla challa bread from a local bakery which I think really made it extra special. I used a lot more than 2 pinches of cinnamon on top for a little more flavor but other than that, followed the recipe to a tee. It was very custardy. Simply delicious. I will make again and again.

I loved the taste and texture of this bread pudding.  So creamy!  However, it needed more flavor.  I made a quick whiskey sauce and Oh Yum!  Perfect!

Fantastic recipe!!!
I made it for my work, my husbands work, and my family... everyone loved it!!! I didn't butter the bread first or mix the bread in with the mixture, I layered the bread in the pan and poured it on top. I added butter last in slivers randomly on the top after it was all put together. I added allot more cinnamon than it called for, and in one of the pans I added a can of pumpkin into the mix. The pumpkin one was a SMASH hit! Thankyou for the recipe! For my first time making bread pudding, it was a foolproof, and an easy one to do! Happy Holidays!!!!

First, many thanks to all who took the time to enter a review. It certainly was a big help to me. I made the following changes: 4 qt (10x15) glass baking dish, 1 doz extra large eggs, 19 slices of cinnamon bread, 1 cup golden raisins which I placed in a bowl of very hot water (to plump up) for 15 mins, 3 tsp of vanilla and 3/4 cup of sugar. I let the bread soak up the egg/vanilla mixture for 15 mins before I added the other ingredients. Didn't need the cinnamon or nutmeg and didn't butter/toast the bread beforehand. Baked at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 20 mins. Very, very tasty!

I thought that this recipe was way to sweet. It also was very eggy. It also needed more cinnamon.

Perfect! Lends itself wonderfully to additions. I used a baguette and added dried cranberries and little apple pieces, then  made a carmel sauce to serve with - outstanding. This should be the base for all bread puddings, if not wonderful on it's own.

Don't change a thing as it's perfect as written!
Now if you want to add items to spice it up like cranberries, chocolate chips, nuts etc then add but keep the basic recipe the same. You won't be disappointed...Yummy, Custardy Bread Pudding

The best thing i like about this pudding is that it has texture!! sooo many bread puddings look so thick and one layered that i can't bring myself to eat it. I made enough for 2 batches. i used 2 very large glass pie plates that i purchased from IKEA for $4.99. I used 1 loaf of handbraded Challah bread and half a loaf of cinn-raisin bread (i know this was over 1 pound) i put extra cinn and nutmeg, added a little clove. It came out great i took them to 2 different homes for Thanksgiving and i got 6 phone calls about it. I just got through making2 more this morning for other people (one for my friend who will swap a pan of her famous mac&cheese for the bread pudding).  This time i used 1 1/2 Challah bread, i chopped 2 apples and in a pot on the stove i added 1/2 cup raisins, 1/4 cup of dried craisins, vanilla and 1 cup sugar of the 3 cups called for and brought it to a boil just enough for the apples to get soft and added it to the mix. It came out great!!!! i have 3 more to make before the week is out "OMG". I will try adding mashed pumpkin , sweet potato, sliced almonds, amaretto, rum, flavored liquors, peaches...... the list can go on and on of what i can do (not all together of course). Thank u so much this is the "Bomb". I will pass this recipe on to all. I am so impressed that it looks just like the picture that is soo important to me when i am looking for recipes.

This recipe calls for way too much sugar and vanilla. After only three bites I couldn't stand anymore of it's sickly sweet taste. If I were to ever make it again I would reduce the sugar and vanilla by half. However, having a 9x13 pan of uneatable bread pudding did give me a great idea. I chopped up half of this bread pudding, put it in an 8x11 pan, and poured my own basic custard recipe (minus the sugar) over it. I also added more cinnamon and nutmeg. I baked this new concoction for 1hour 15minutes at 350degrees. It turned out perfect! It was everything I was hoping the first recipe would've been; the perfect amount of sweetness with just a hint of vanilla. I'm freezing the other half of the too sweet bread pudding so I can make my version again some day.

I divided this recipe in half and used 2 8"x8" pans.  I used half white and half whole wheat bread.  I think that buttering each slice on both sides gives a very savory flavor although it is time consuming.  I used kitchen shears to cut up the bread.  I added 3/4 c raisins to 1 batch and 3/4 c blueberries soaked in vodka (They were strained from homemade blueberry cordial) to the other.  They were both delicious.

This was a very good recipe. It made a lot. I used some stale sourdough bread. I did the recipe just as, except I boiled the raisins for about 10 minutes in water, vanilla, and cinnamon. My husbad loved it, too. The only change I would like, is it be a little more syrup-y (is that a word? lol). Thanks for posting!

I have made this atleast 3 times cause it's a major hit with my friends. I can't bring myself to put in 12 eggs so I always put in 8. I also don't like the overly potent smell of vanilla so I only add about 2 tablespoons. I put extra extra cinnamon and extra nutmeg on top. Very wonderful recipe, I love it and make it every time we have family come in or an event to go to.

This recipe has become a staple in my family. I'm asked to make it for every holiday meal. Everyone loves it. I modify it a bit, less egg, more vanilla.

This was my first attempt at bread pudding, but it was so easy to make.  My only problem was that I read other reviews and added more cinnamon - which turned out to be too much for me.  I'll make this again for sure, next time sticking to the original recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg instead of the pinch the recipe called for.  I also used milk instead of cream and it came out spectacular.

Really good recipe Geoff.  I didn't have 5 cups of half and half so I used part milk and eggnog and left out the spices.  This made a huge batch and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  Thanks again.

This recipe was delicious! I was looking for a bread pudding that was thick and custardy, and this recipe was exactly what I was looking for. After reading the reviews, I decided that I would put 2 1/2 C of sugar instead of 3, and also added 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of a pinch. Fabuloso!!

Having to please an "Authentic Cajun Family" this recipe hits the spot. I make this for our annual Mardi-Gras Party every year. I did make additions to the recipe as it was a little boring. I add 1/2 cup of shredded coconut,1/2 cup chopped pecans, 1/2 cup golden raisins. I usually have to add a little more liquid to compensate for the dry additions. 
I serve this with a butter-rum sauce on the side. PERFECT!!!

This recipe was a HIT at two potlucks I attended recently.  I had never made a bread pudding before, and it was so easy and failproof.  Easy to make and adapts well to modifications (I used Splenda for Baking Blend instead of white sugar and Fat Free Half and Half).  Overwhelming raves from everyone; thank you so much for sharing this super tasty, awesome recipe!!  Truly ono-licious!!

This was a very delicious dessert we served at our family Christmas this year.  Everyone loved it!  We will definitely be making this a holiday tradition.  It was very easy and made a huge batch.  I actually had to use two dishes to bake it in because the large one was not large enough.  I will be trying different variations as well and I'm sure they'll be excellent.
