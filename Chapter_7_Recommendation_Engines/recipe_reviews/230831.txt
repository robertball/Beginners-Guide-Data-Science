GREAT recipe. Giving one star because it is EXACTLY the same recipe published in 2012 by Deb Perelman in her Smitten Kitchen cookbook. Not cool!

The recipe calls for 16 tortillas, but makes 6 servings. 

Shouldn't it be 12 or 18 tortillas so the number of tortillas per serving comes out even?

Great Idea. Our family prefers this with a couple of changes: 1) corn tortillas in cooked casseroles are great to us, but unless one has really uber fresh corn tortillas, they are too tough for our taste unless they are cooked, so we prefer either for this to be a cooked casserole, OR we switch to corn tortilla chips more like a taco salad or we make soft tacos using flour tortillas, 2) we prefer about 2/3 *less* lime.

I was delightfully surprised. Great flavour and very filling. On filled wrap was enough but it was so good I had two. Will definitely make again.

Awesome! I used some taco seasoning mix because realized didn't have cumin or coriander at last minute. Also just used shredded Mexican blend chees but sure the quest fresco would be perfect. Yummy and hubby loved them too.

Great vegetarian alternative for tacos! My partner (a meat eater) also loved them.  We also added sour cream and ate them with cheddar cheese and they turned out great.

I especially loved that the squash made the tacos much lower in calories - as opposed to using meat.  We like it spicy so we used a little hot sauce on top.  Hubby thought it needed more cumin but I didn't.  What a great way to use up those abundant spaghetti squash in my garden!

These were delicious, even without the cheese. I put some chipotle pumpkin salsa on top, which tasted great.
