I used a good quality salsa, double-batch of homemade taco seasoning and double the cilantro. I made the end result into fajitas with sauteed red pepper, sweet onion and minced garlic. As always, I think the quality of your ingredients can make or break your recipe--I'm glad I doubled the spices and used a good salsa. We were quite hungry today so this fed us well with enough leftover for another meal, with the sauteed vegetables. I'll make this again.

This a great way to feed a crowd.  I add a can of black beans, rinsed and drained, and a bag of frozen whole kernal corn.

Yum! Really, really good. Instead of taco seasoning mix I just threw in some spices: cumin, ancho chile powder, sea salt, black/white pepper, oregano, etc. The cilantro gives it such a fresh flavor; if you like cilantro, you'll like this dish. I served it in whole wheat flour tortillas with shredded cabbage, shredded cheese, plain yogurt, and fresh cilantro. I'll definitely make again. Thanks :)

I do this all the time but if you get a salsa with a lot of flavor, you can omit the taco packet. It only adds extra sodium. Instead, use a jar of salsa, 2 minced garlic cloves and a diced onion. I also like to use two limes. :)
(and if you add the lime and fresh cilantro in the last hour of cooking you get MORE flavor)

This recipe makes a whole lotta chicken so I tried it several ways. It was good in crispy taco shells and in corn and flour tortillas. The biggest winner, however, was chicken enchiladas. They were simply the best I have ever had. Just spoon into corn tortillas with a little cheese, pour your favorite enchilada sauce over top, top with a little more cheese, bake and you are in enchilada heaven!

I tried this tonight and, while the chicken was very tender and easy to shred, the recipe was too salty for my tastes. The combination of the taco seasoning and salsa made for the salty taste I'm sure. I would make this again but I'd look for a lower sodium salsa, if there is such a thing.

Found this a very easy to make taco filling.I used McCormick Chicken Taco seasoning and La Costena brand salsa verde. It was done in 7 hrs on low setting.This would even be good served over rice and topped the the juices from the crockpot and some cilantro and onions

I prepared this for guests that are on low-calorie diets last evening, and it was a HUGE hit!  I served it with super low carb, high fiber tortillas, salsa and fat free sour cream, and it was YUMMY!  Definitely a keeper, and it makes a large amount.  A serving is a large portion, very flavorful and filling.  Even my picky son LOVED it and asked to have it again tomorrow!  I followed some of the suggestions other reviewers had, such as not using the full pack of taco seasoning because of the high sodium content.  I added rinced black beans, drained whole kernel corn, and I sliced up two medium onions and added it to the mixture.  I threw this together on my lunch break and it cooked on high for about 4 hours and the chicken just fell apart and was so moist and juicy.  I will make this over and over again...no doubt!

This smelled so awesome while it was cooking! I cooked it on high for about four hours. It was so tender and pulled apart so easily. I plan to freeze some for later use. Will make great tacos or sandwiches!

I served it with naan bread and rice, GREAT combination with this chicken, and a great change of pace for us. I'll make it again, maybe for company next time. I appreciate that the meat pairs well with something besides boring taco shells and tortillas - it wasn't overpowered by the taco seasoning and didn't scream Mexican. Thank you for sharing!

This is a fabulous recipe! I make it once a week for soft tacos or taco salads.  My only change is that I add approximately 2 cups of water and I cook on low for 8 hours.  Delicious! You can also use two cans of tomatoes with green chilies instead of salsa.  Great, easy recipe!

Yummy. I loved the flavor of the lime and cilantro combined. I added lime zest to give it a stronger flavor. It made a really good chicken taco.

I know this may sound crazy but this recipes make a fantastic easy spicy Indian chicken curry.  I used a jar Tostito's Chunky medium salsa,  2 x packs of dry taco mixes.  1/2 cup of fresh cilantro and the juice of two small limes.  I added all these ingredients together at the start like the recipe states, that in the last couple of hours I added 2 chopped onions and 1/2 small yellow pepper and 1/2 small green pepper and 4 small Jalapenos.  The taste was gorgeous, served with wild rice and Garlic naan breads.  I will be making this recipe again and again...

Salty the first time I made it using packaged taco seasonings.  The second time, I used the taco seasoning from AR in an effort to control the sodium.  Worked like a charm....  If you like the bright, lively, fresh taste of the cilantro and lime, add it to the chicken in the last hour of cooking.  Occasionally I'll throw in lime zest as well to bring the flavors forward.  Thanks for a great recipe that can be used in a variety of ways.

I've been on a crock pot kick this week, and this is the best dish I've made in my slow cooker yet! My family was raving about this one. I'm a cilantro fan, so I added a full cup of the fresh herb. I wasn't sure what salsa to use, so I did 8oz. of Pace coupled with 8oz. of a Fresh Serrano Salsa I purchased at Trader Joes. Truthfully, I think you are safe using a canned Salsa like Pace because the Taco Seasoning becomes the dominant flavor in the salsa. I would not use dry cilantro, however...for me, the fresh cilantro made this dish!! Fantastic recipe that I'll be making over and over again. Super Easy to make, but your friends will think you are a Culinary Genius!!!

This was awesome, thanks for sharing!  I have made this four times in the last two months and it's such a great dish.  I followed the directions exactly the first time and it was amazing.  The next few times we changed it up a bit and it was still amazing.  Just used diced tomatoes, chopped onion and seasonsings instead of salsa and both came out great... but good to know if you don't have a jar of salsa in the house and want to make this dish.  We've also ate the chicken whole (without shredding) with rice, beans and veggies on the side.

This couldn't be more delicious or easy. I made it according to the recipe and the chicken was so tender and flavorful throughout. My Texican brother-in-law laughed at my 'white' attempt at making a Mexican dish - he's an amazing cook and makes everything from scratch. Even he was impressed. I think he was a little disppointed that it was so good.

! I cut up red onion, lettuce, tomatoes, added shredded cheese and sour cream and rolled up in a corn tortilla. We heat up the tortillas on the stove burner med/high - flipping it over and over till it's nice and hot - even char it slightly for added flavor. Delicious!!

I made a dish similar to this and it was very good I used the same ingredients except I added 4 cups of chicken broth and a block of cream cheese.  It turned into a wonderful soup that feeds about 12.  Served it with tortilla chips and hard rolls very comforting.. very good.

This was one of the easiest and tastiest slow cooker recipes I have come across so far!  I had chicken in the freezer, had bought fresh cilantro for another recipe and barely used any of it, had a lime on hand and had just whipped up some Taco Seasoning II (from this website).  Plus I always have spare jars of salsa on hand.  I used it as taco/burrito filling.  Whole wheat tortillas with some shredded cheese and taco seasoned rice...delicious!

I'd recommend draining the salsa before adding - the recipe will turn out a bit less soupy but with all the flavor.  Or get real pico de gallo instead.

Delicious and easy.  I tripled the amount of cilantro (just because we love it), but otherwise made according to recipe.  My husband has requested this as a weekly meal and my kids loved it as well.

Another 5 star winner!  When I walked in the door the smell of this coming from my crockpot was heaven!  I can't even imagine how my dogs could stand this all day simmering above their noses on the counter top!  As I was putting this together in the crockpot I discovered that my salsa was actually black bean and corn salsa, so I threw that in there and moved on.  Wow!  I will make this again but will always use the black bean and corn salsa - it added some great flavor to this dish.

This was PERFECT for my diet.  The only changes I made were adding juice from 1/2 of a lime more and adding 1/2 can of black beans.  It makes a very large amount, so I recommend scaling back the recipe for a family of 3 or less.  I served it on a tortilla as a chicken taco, and by my calculation, you can load the tortilla with meat and it's 275 calories.  I can seriously get 15 large tacos out of this without blinking an eye.  Thank you to the poster for putting this out there!  GREAT RECIPE!  :)

Excellent recipe
I added a can of Rotel, can of Mexican corn and one can of rinsed black beans.
We take the leftovers if any, wrap them in tortillas add a can or two of enchilada sauce, top with whatever  shredded cheese we have and bake at 350 for thirty minutes.
I actually prefer this over the original

This was a great recipe to start with, but I made some modifications:

Used a 24-ounce jar of salsa instead of 16. Use a good salsa, not Pace or anything like that. Omitted taco seasoning and instead seasoned chicken with garlic salt, pepper, cumin, oregano, paprika, crushed red pepper, and a teensy bit of cayenne pepper (if you're not into spicy you might want to omit the last two). Added 1/2 green bell pepper and 1/2 onion. Only used half a lime, set the other half aside. Before making the salsa mixture, I poured about 1/2 inch coating of *salsa only* on the bottom, just to wet it, then did up my chicken, then poured the finished salsa mixture on top. Once cooked I sprinkled on more cilantro and the juice from the remaining lime, and served with Spanish rice.

This turned out so juicy and good, all those seasonings soaked into that chicken and the chicken was so moist I didn't need a knife! Great recipe.

Easy and reliable slow cooker recipe.  I halved it. Added a can of drained/rinsed black beans.  Could have used more cilantro - I could barely taste it and I thought I put in a bit extra.  Low setting for 6 hours was enough time for my cooker. Next time will try with rice.  Super versatile!

This was SO good!! I made it for a small dinner party at my apt and everyone RAVED about it!! I used a whole jar of Herdez Salsa Verde, along with the cilantro and lime and made my own taco seasoning with cumin, garlic and other spices. Once i shredded the chicken with a fork (which was very easy) i poured some of the leftover juice from the chicken, over the shredded chicken. Everything was delicious!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is easy and delicious. For the people complaining that the chicken was 'dry', it doesn't matter how much liquid one uses to cook chicken breasts, if they're overcooked they'll be 'dry' i.e. have a 'mealy' texture, and timing for a better outcome can be tricky.
This is why I rarely buy breasts and use thighs where I can, which I used in this recipe. Now, to overcome the 'tricky' timing for a moist breast, I brine the breasts 24 hours ahead of time.  This takes some advance planning, but what a difference it makes, and the brine is simple; 1qt water, 1/2cup Kosher salt and 1/4 cup white sugar. Can adjust amount to fit needs, just keep the ratio the same. This method really makes a difference in the breast texture.  That said, they of course, can still be overcooked, but the timing is not as critical. Brining can be done for any recipe calling for chicken or pork. Hope this helps.

Really good and easy! Love the taste of the fresh lime and cilantro. I had a bit more chicken, so I doubled the seasoning packet and tossed in more cilantro.  Perfect for making chicken quesadillas!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This turned out amazing! I doubled the lime juice and used an entire bundle of chopped cilantro, added a couple fresh habaneros, garlic and onion. I cooked it on low for 8 hours, shredded the chicken, and put it back in the slow cooker for another hour. I had planned it for a dinner with a friend, but everyone who stopped over wanted to try it, and it ended up as a dinner party with 7 or 8 people, so I set up a taco bar. Everyone was stuffed by the end, and the chicken was devoured. It was so tender and flavorful. I'm already thinking about making it again next weekend.

This was a HUGE hit with my fishermen! I did use the addition of black beans and corn as suggested by another member. Because of that I used juice of 2 limes and a 1/4 cup tightly packed chopped cilantro to season extra ingredients. Native Texan Rosted Salsa was perfect. To avoid all the chopping and feed 10 hungry men ASAP, I filled the crispy flat bottom taco shells with a smear of refried beans, the chicken meat, a little green leaf lettuce, ready made Pico digiallo with problano peppers, and topped with Mexican cheese and a jalapeño. It was fast, easy and looked great. Tasted even better! I was able to serve them from a filled lasagna dish with nothing but napkins appetizer style pool side. Btw... I made 30 generously filled taco. I still had meat left over. This recipe makes a lot of tacos. Great for the crew I was feeding. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband raved about this. I think I used about 3/4 of the bunch of cilantro, and then sprinkled the rest over the chicken when it was finished serving. I served this in taco shells with black beans and corn, shredded cheese, and sour cream. Delicious!

Awesome recipe!! So simple and so flavorful. The lime and cilantro really add a burst of flavor to such a simple set of ingredients. If you're a cilantro freak like me, don't be shy... I'm not sure how much I used, but it was probably about triple the amount... and it was so good! I used frozen chicken breast right out of the freezer with no problem. It doesn't come out quite as juicy as fresh chicken does, but it was still easy to shred and tasted great. Everyone that smelled or tasted it loved it!

Cooked for 8 hours on Low b/c the recipe said the cooking time on Low is 6-8 hours and my chicken was frozen......came home to BLACK CHAR. Was NOT happy for all of the ruined food. The salsa cannot handle 6-8 hours on Low and the cook time needs to be adjusted, or other ingredients, like broth or water added to prevent charring.

This chicken is awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly but I do have to admit that I went to my favorite Mexican restaurant to buy their salsa as I have never been able to find any good salsa from the grocery and I didn't want to ruin the chicken with inferior salsa.  This would be a great recipe to use for a party and have a taco bar.  It was truly outstanding!!

Excellent! I spice it up with a chopped jalapeno and extra cilantro. This recipe pairs well with the 'refried beans without the refry' from this sight.

This is great!!  Fast, easy, kid friendly, budget friendly.  Everyone loved it.  On advice from another review, I added a small can of MILD green chilis, corn, and black beans.  Mixed in the corn and black beans after shredding chicken.  Served over boxed Spanish rice.  It's a keeper.

Very delicious! I incorporated several of the suggestions from other reviewers:  I doubled the salsa and added cans of fiesta corn and black beans.  I may have added a can of Rotel in addition to the salsa (It's been a few weeks since I made this so I'm trying to decipher my notes.)  I added (double) the lime and cilantro for the last hour of cooking time.  I cooked on low for 8 hours.  This made a huge delicious batch with plenty of leftovers that could be used in a lot of different ways.  (Our favorite was enchiladas.)

I have made this several times now. The first time smelled so good but was very salty. So the next time I used half a pack of taco seasoning and it was better. This past time I cooked this I used homemade salsa added green and red peppers. It was really good.

OMG Why have I waited so long to try this recipe?  So good!  I used peach salsa because that is what I had open in the frig, 7 chicken tenders and just half a package of taco seasoning.  I used my small slow cooker which only operates on high and it only took about 2 hours to be done.  The chicken absolutely fell apart.  I served the mixture on egg noodles.  Did I mention this was good?

Excellent recipe!  So easy & the house smelled delicious while it was cooking.  I too added organic black beans & organic frozen corn the last 30 mins or so of cooking.  Also used my own seasonings (red pepper, pepper, sea salt, oregno, basil, parsley, cumin, & garlic powder) instead of the prepared taco seasoning.  Served over rice first meal, will serve with whole wheat tortillas tonight, guacamole, black olives & Chobani Plain Yogurt.  Sweet recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Really good.  I realized my chicken breasts had bones and skin so I cooked the chicken separately, boned and shredded the meat then added the rest of the ingredients plus an onion.  I cooked it in a deep skillet for about 30 minutes and called it done.  This makes a great enchilada filling but my DH ate it over rice and loved it.  Very similar to my own recipe but I didn't use the lime juice - I think I'll add it from now on - it gives a nice, fresh taste.  Thanks for the recipe.

So easy to make! I added two limes because I love when that hit of citrus powers through spicy food. But I couldn't really taste it, so I might add more next time.
Because the salsa is going to be the dominant flavor, this chicken will only be as good as the quality of the salsa you choose.

For taste, I would probably give this recipe 4 - 4 1/2 stars.  The reason it gets 5 stars is for a) the simplicity and b) the versatility.  This is truly the easiest recipe I have ever thrown in the Crock Pot.  I made it for the first time and served the meat with whole wheat tortilla shells, tomatoes, cheese, lettuce, and low-fat sour cream for chicken soft tacos.   Everyone loved it.  What I love, though, is that every reviewer has done something different with it.  It is like getting 50 recipes (more, really) in 1 simple recipe.  I can't wait to try all the ideas others had.  This will be a great, easy idea for serving a large group while everyone is together over the holidays or for any kind of party.  I think I'm going to put this meat into the "Make Ahead Lunch Wraps" that I love from this site.  Anyway, I could go on and on, but I am really excited about this new discovery.  Thanks for sharing!

You know it's good when everyone stops talking while they're eating! I also used reduced sodium taco mix, and added corn and the lime juice the last hour of cooking. I made another batch the following day with pork. Excellent with either meat. I served it with tortillas, sour cream and mildly seasoned pinto beans on the side. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it, everyone did! I did however add a couple of things after it cooked to give it a little more wow factor...I don't know the measurements, I just added until it tasted perfect. The two ingredients and their approximate measurements were 3-4 T coconut oil, 1/4-1/2 cup fancy grade vermont maple syrup. Holy cow, this tasted awesome with that. I also used spices instead of a seasoning packet to avoid MSG, and the seasonings I used were cumin, cayenne pepper, paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, sea salt, and 1 T of cocoa powder and cinnamon (which I also use in chili and it tastes great!). Very easy, I actually diced it up after it cooked to allow more flavor to seep in, some used it in tacos, others just straight. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was a HUGE hit at our house.  The first meal was hard tacos for my husband and burritos for the rest.  The next two meals were chicken enchiladas on corn torillas.  Enchiladas were the favorite way to fix this.  So many ways to use this as filling!  I did add extra cilantro, as suggested, and I dumped in a bag of frozen Mexi Mix veggies (corn, black beans, peppers, and onions).  I also added about 1/2 - 3/4 Cup chicken broth so the leftovers wouldn't dry out.

Delicious and so easy!  I did add more cilantro, approx. 1/2 cup, since our family really likes it.  We served the chicken on warm tortillas, with shredded cheese, lettuce and tomato, like soft tacos.  My very picky 12 year old loved it! Definitely a keeper!

I made this for my family and they loved it! I served it in soft warm corn tortillas and garnished with lettuce and onions.  Next time will add guacamole. This tasted like we went to a restaurant! The only thing I did different  was that instead of using salsa, I used a can of Rotell.

I've made this many times. I make it for ALL of my work pot lucks. As well as football parties. And I have won the best dish contest. Now I usually end up printing out copies of the recipe. And bring them with the dish. Because everyone ends up asking for it.                                                                             I have read the reviews. And have tweeted it to suit my tastes. I now add a can of black beans drained. And a small can of corn.  Make sure to use a good quality salsa. Something with authentic flavors. I also use the low-sodium taco seasoning. And add 1 cup of water. I then serve it up with a side of sour cream. The hardest part of this recipe. Is  shredded the chicken. Make it as an appetizer. And serve with a bowl of tortilla chips. Or as a main dish as taco filling.   It is delicious !!

This was very good.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and when I got home I used this to fill enchiladas, adding a little shredded cheese.  Rolled them up, topped with canned sauce and more cheese, put them in the oven, and 20 minutes later I had some very tasty enchiladas.

This will probably replace my other enchilada recipe.  This is much easier.

The amount of liquid in the slow cooker is only enough to create a thin layer on the bottom, with a ton of chicken on top, uncovered.  In addition, the cooking time is way off--I used 4 frozen chicken breasts (much less than the 3 lbs called for in the recipe) cooked on low and after 4 hours it was cooked completely through and could be shredded by a fork.  The recommended cooking time, combined with the lack of liquid, would have ruined the meat.  I added 3 cups of chicken broth, an extra lime, and more cilantro.  I cooked on low for 4 hours, then removed the chicken, shredded it with a fork, and put it back in for 30 more minutes.  When it was done I strained the chicken out of the liquid and put it on tortillas with cheese and sour cream as tacos, which was very good.  The crockpot dish itself looked like a soup before I strained it, however.

I love this recipe! I've made this recipe at least a dozen times now. It's super quick an easy to make and a crowd pleaser. I sometimes follow the last step and shred and sometimes I leave the pieces whole and service over rice. And the left overs make an incredible soup too. Simply add hominy carrots and any other veggie you like with chicken broth and cook for 15 minutes.

I make this often. It is so easy to throw together and very, very good. The recipe makes a lot, but freezes well. I've used it in taco shells, burritos, enchiladas, and on salads.

Made this recipe Sunday afternoon for dinner!!  The house smelled wonderful!!  I did what others said in adding more lime juice and cilantro in the last hour!!!  I simply served it over brown rice and veggies for a side.  My husband couldn't stop raving over it!!  He loved it and wanted to make sure it gets placed in meal rotation.  Great as leftovers with a whole wheat tortilla!  Made a large amount so will freeze what we don't eat for a second day of leftovers!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Couldn't have been any easier, but was way too salty. I used Ortega brand taco seasoning, so maybe that was the culprit.

Nom Nom Nom.  I had bone in, but I just cooked it all and then later removed the bones when I shredded it.  I had dried cilantro, and ended up adding even more.  I also used a homemade taco mix, and then hit it with extra cumin. I nuked my lime for a bit so I was able to get a lot of juice, and I also scrapped some of the pulp right on into the pot. Towards the end of my cooking time, I cracked the lid to let the moisture reduce and the flavors intensify.  I then shredded and deboned and put it back into this thick beautiful sauce.  It was perfect and delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

I changed a few things because my husband hates the taste of peppers in salsa. I used one 16oz jar of tomato corn salsa and a small can of tomato sauce. I am glad I added the extra liquid because without it would have turned out very dry. I cooked it for 8 hours in my slow cooker and then put the shredded chicken into soft tortilla shells. Finished it off with lettuce, red onions, tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese and taco sauce. Very delicious!

Awesome! Few adjustments for my version. Used a 12 ounce jar of salsa verde, with about 1/2 cup of water. Used homemade taco seasoning, still about 2.5 tablespoons, added one seeded jalapeno and a small onion. Cooked on high for 2 hours and low for another 2 and ended up with the best chicken I've ever cooked.

Absolutely one of my favorite recipes on this site! Super easy, very good and versatile. The only difference in mine is that instead of using a prepackaged taco seasoning, I make my own. I include cumin, Mexican chili powder, cayenne, paprika, black pepper, a tiny bit of salt and onion and garlic powder. You could definitely use a prepackaged one, but I wanted to avoid the high sodium. There are some different things you can do once you have made the chicken. One, make tacos. Two, put it in enchiladas like I do--yum! Or three, just service it some beans and Spanish rice or fajita veggies...or whatever you'd like! It's truly a gem on this site, and something anyone can recreate.

Delicious and so easy!  This is my favorite slow cooker recipe by far!  
I double the cilantro, add a can of black beans and a cup of frozen corn.  I use 3 limes and zest one.  Look for chicken taco seasoning as it usually has the least amount of sodium.  I made this for a pot luck and it was a hit.  Serve it with pitas, rice or just by itself.  Add a can of chicken broth and have a yummy soup.  I like it by itself with a spoonful of sour cream on top.  So many options!

I added a cup of chicken broth and much more cilantro.  I also used low salt taco seasoning but it actually needed more salt at the end.  The trick to cooking with lemon/lime is to add it at the end.  I know this but followed the recipe and it did make it a little bitter. I would definitely make this again with these changes.

I have been making this at least once a month for about a year. It is SOOOOO easy and good. I use green salsa, make my own taco seasoning (Taco seasoning I, on this site), double the lime and cilantro, and shred an hour or so before I serve, if I have time...helps the flavors blend into the chicken a little better.

We use it on nachos, in enchiladas, in burritos, and in tacos...very versatile AND low fat...yippee!

Great recipe! I modified it. I used more lime juice, more cilantro and instead of a jar of salsa, I used diced tomatoes with cumin, red pepper, salt, pepper and garlic. Fresh cilantro was yummy.

This is exceptionally good!  I made the recipe just like it stated although I did not measure the cilantro so I might have added extra there.  As for the reviews that said it was too salty, they must not have used 3 pounds of chicken breast.  I used a little over 3 pounds and it was perfect.

We cooked a whole 2.5 lb bird this way. Pulled most of the skin off before throwing it in the slow cooker, adding sauce over top. (For the sauce - we used easily 4x the recommended amount of cilantro; juice from 2 limes plus threw one rind into the cooker for extra flavor; and one whole batch of homemade taco seasoning from this site.)

It turned out perfectly, very juicy and falling off the bone after 4 hours on high. We had exactly 4 cups of liquid juice/sauce which was so delicious we threw it in the rice cooker with 2 cups of rice. Highly recommend!

How can you not love this super easy, super tasty recipe.  I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site instead of packaged taco seasoning and left out the salt and I left out the cilantro because I used this chicken in the Pico De Gallo Chicken Quesadilla recipe which already has cilantro in the Pico De Gallo.  It was excellent.  I used about half the chicken but kept the seasonings the same.  I will definitely be making this again.

I did not use the dry seasoning mix (per other reviews) and it turned out very well. It wasn't as spicy as I like so next time I will add some chipolte peppers. Overall, great recipe! I will use it again.

This dish was good, but not as tasty as I was hoping for. I followed the directions exactly, and I used the shredded chicken to make "Chicken Enchiladas II" (recipe on this site). The overall result was good, but here is what I would do next time for ever better taste: 

1) Add more lime--maybe another full lime, juiced. 
2) Add a bit more taco seasoning
3) In the last half hour, I would shred the chicken, and then put the shredded chicken back in the slower cooker for the last 30-45 minutes to absorb the flavor.

Just Okay.  I used reduced sodium taco seasoning and a jar of medium flavor salsa.  My family still felt it was too salty.  
Mix the left over sauce with the chicken once you shred it if you want more flavor.

I have no idea what slow cookers everyone is using, but I tried this recipe and at 3 1/2 hours on low the chicken was so dried out it couldn't be shredded. I was so excited because the whole house smelled fabulous/delicious. I had to throw it away. :( I'll tweak the time and try again...

This recipe rocks!  I didn't have any skinless, boneless chicken breasts, so I used skinless chicken thighs instead.  I also put in a can of Embasa spicey carrots, a can of diced green chilies and sliced jalepenos for extra spice.  It came out fantastic!  Will definitely make this again!

boneless chicken breast was just too dry.  Even though the salsa, lime juice added plenty of moisture, it was still lacking a much needed moistness.  Baking chicken theighs and shredding a darker meat would improve on the final dish.

Really good recipe, but the cooking time was too long for my cooker.  It's probably my fault because I halved the recipe and still did it on high for 4 hours.  The meat is a little dry, but not too bad.  So sad!  I wanted it to be perfect!  I will have to do it for less time next time.  I did 1/2 jar of salsa and sprinkled some cumin, chili powder and powdered garlic into it and then added some fresh chopped garlic and onion too.  Smells so awesome!

I wish I didn't shred the chicken before serving it with rice. The result was really dry! Would do great as taco filling, though.

I have to say I was very surprised that this tasted so good.  I'm not a fan of of the packaged taco seasoning, but my whole family liked this recipe. I changed my stars to 5 on this because it has become a staple in our home.  We love it in CORN tortillas that I warm and brown on the burners of my gas stove.  Add sour cream and sheddered cheese, lettuce and what a meal! yum!

Tasty and EASY.
Added generic brand taco seasoning packet, salsa verde, one bunch of cilantro and the juice of 2 limes, threw in some extra onion I had. Made it for a Bunco taco night and got asked multiple times for the recipe.

This was a good, basic recipe.  I actually used 8oz of salsa and a can of Rotel, and left out the taco seasoning, which just adds sodium.  If you want extra flavor, add some chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, and cumin to it yourself.  I put the juice of 1 lime in with the salsa/tomato mix, added a can of drained black beans, and cooked.  About an hour before serving, I added the juice of another 1/2 a lime and a generous amount of cilantro.  Very flavorful and delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and this is great! I can also see so much more that this chicken can be used for. A great base for taco soup! Just add chicken broth and season to complement the added liquid, add in some black beans,corn and maybe some green chilies. this will made again and again in my kitchen. Great!

Great recipe, full of flavor and low in fat. I used   "Del Real" Guacatillo Salsa, sold at Costco in Calif. It's a green salsa,made from tomatillos, avocado, etc. There's something about adding the taco seasoning, lime juice, and cilantro that makes the sauce just "pop" with flavor. The chicken turned out moist, flavorful and easy to shred. I will make this agin, maybe next time with skinless chicken thighs.

Decided to try this because I have a ton of cilantro in the garden.  I went with CookinBug's suggestion of making my own taco mix instead of using a pre-made, packaged mix.  They're mostly salt, so it becomes very expensive salt with a few cents worth of other ingredients.  I also made green salsa from the tomatilloes, jalapenos and cilantro in the garden instead of using bottled salsa.  I used more cilantro than called for and held it out until after the chicken was cooked.  I feel this brings through the fresh flavor of the cilantro.  The result was delicious, but it's definitely not for those cilantro haters out there (you know who you are!)

I am so glad I found this site and specifically this recipe, months ago.  Every single person, including the finicky eaters, love this chicken. It's the easiest meal I make with the highest approval rating. I use Herdez salsa which is much better than any of the others I've tried. This is my first rating because of those facts. I've got to try the pressure cooker with this recipe.

I've made this three times now and use chipotle salsa and the juice from two limes. I've used low-sodium taco seasoning, as suggested by previous commenters. I almost can't stand how amazingly delicious this turns out! Absolutely my favorite dish! Four chicken breasts yields enough to make plentiful enchiladas for two with enough left over for a few lunches or other uses. This is delicious on pizza! Seriously, this recipe is so tasty I can't get enough!

Delicious! Works great for a slow cooker pot roast or pork roast too. Just omit the taco seasoning to reduce the sodium (as AshleyC suggested) and add a bit more liquid, perhaps beef broth/stock. Thank you for a great recipe!

The only changes I made were to add chopped onions and at least doubled the cilantro. I used trader joe's salsa verde, and mccormick taco seasoning. Cooked it on the high setting. It was perfect after 4 hours.  I pulled the chicken out, shredded with a fork and added some of the juice from the crockpot back in for a little extra flavor. We used it for tacos and it was awesome, moist and flavorful. I will definitely make this againg and again!

Super simple! Put together when I got home from work for lunch over the next few days.  I used 3 chicken breasts, 24 oz jar of Chi-Chi's medium thick and chunky salsa, reduced sodium taco seasoning, one lime, and a bunch of cilantro.  About 30 minutes in crock pot it smelled so good!

I just didn't care for this dish.  Admittedly,It sounded good, but the lime juice turned the sauce too sour for my taste.  Perhaps I should have added the juice towards the end of the cooking time and not at the start.  Still, my family thought it was merely "okay," and I don't think it's a keeper, as written.  This recipe benefits from some adjustments and additions.

This was as close to the chicken enchilada filling at our local Mexican restaurant as I've ever achieved. Very good recipe.

I made this with pace salsa and some dried oregano (cilantro is a type of oregano) and chicken thighs instead of breasts. I thought it would be okay but it was out of this world delicious! I will definitely be making this again, even my two year old liked it!

This is on the top of my list for easy and delicious! I made the recipe enchilada style with 3 large chicken breast and some spaghetti squash (already cooked). The spaghetti squash was a last minuted idea to adhere more closely to a more vegetable diet, a cheaper alternative to meat, and to reduce the calories some. It was yummy!

I used canned green enchilada sauce and cut it with chicken broth and cream of celery soup to dull the taste down. I used homemade salsa and didn't want to the sauce to be overbearing.

I'm giving this a 4 because I changed it up a bit. Otherwise, I would give it a 5! I used 4 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts, 2 cans of Rotel with lime and cilantro, 1 can of Rotel with medium heat chilies, extra cilantro and a double batch of Taco Seasoning I from this site. Easy and delicious! Will make this over and over again!

Very good!   I used my own Taco Seasoning, which costs a lot less than the pre-packaged mixes.

Doubled the cilantro, omitted the taco seasoning and used a jar of Pace picante sauce with a fresh lime.  After I took the chicken out I added some low fat sour cream in the crock pot and mixed with the remaining juices to make a creamy broth.  Placed the chicken over some Mexican rice and spooned the broth over the chicken and rice. Delicious!

This was a huge hit at my house. And it was so quick to throw together. Based on all the comments about it being too salty I also made my own taco seasoning using the 'Taco Seasoning I' recipe on this site (which took only a minute to make). It turned out perfect. The salsa I used was Old El Paso Restaurant Style Salsa Picante.

I cooked this in my tagine at 275 for three hours.  Thank you to the reviewer that suggested the salt elimination.  The lower sodium makes a huge difference in whether or not the dish is too salty.  I also added roasted red peppers to mine for taste.  The recipe is so simple and yummy but really low in fat.  It's a keeper.

I love this recipe! It's so easy and tasty, my two favorites :) I have a tiny crock pot, so I just use one chicken breast and eyeball the ingredients. It cooks perfectly in 4 hrs. I've tried different salsas, and in the future I'll probably play with the seasonings too. I use the shredded meat for chicken tacos/burritos; it's delicious, tender and juicy.

I have made this several times using different salsas.  My favorite way to prepare this is to use chicken tenders instead of the larger breast halves and green salsa.  I set the slow-cooker to high for the first hour, then turn it down to low for 3 more hours.  I add the lime and the cilantro during the last 30 minutes.  Serve over rice.  I don't bother shredding the chicken anymore, now that I use tenders.  Yummy!

I used about 2 lbs of chicken breasts, slightly more than a half packet of taco seasoning and the full 16 oz of salsa.  Watch the time on this - my chicken was still a bit frozen so I started on high for one hour then switched to low (what I normally do when the chicken is not fully defrosted). My chicken was done in slightly less than 4 hours total cooking time.  If I had cooked the full time, it would be very dry.  The chicken is moist, flavorful and a nice change of pace.  This would be very easy to customize for your family with the addition of vegetables and/or beans.

I don't typically review recipes because I often make a lot of changes, but with this one, I had to. It was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly, but I did add a can of black beans and serve it over brown rice. It was bursting with flavor and I was pleased with how healthy it was. This is definitely going to be added to the rotation!

I'm usually a "no cilantro please" kind of person, but I took a chance with this recipe because I love using my slow cooker.  I'm super happy I did.  Along with some homemade tortillas and chili corn, this recipe was really good (also added avocado and sour cream).  The salsa didn't cover my chicken, so I added a can of chicken broth.  The chicken still came out a tad drier than most meat I cook in my slow cooker, so next time I would probably add a second jar of salsa to make it more tender (I cooked on low for 7.5 hours).  I'm also usually a 'don't eat leftovers' person (food just never tastes right reheated to me), but I'm currently enjoying the chicken for lunch - another bonus.  Would definitely recommend this recipe.  Maybe it's because I love salty foods, but I didn't notice this being overly salty at all - has just the right amount of salt and kick for me!

Wow!  That says it all.  Very easy to make and we had 2 great meals with this and still had some leftovers.  We made enchiladas one night and tacos another.  Outstanding flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly with seasonings - BUT I used a whole chicken.  It worked perfectly.  I just didn't have 3 pounds of chicken breast.  In the future I'll make the whole chicken.  It was extremely economical!

Very tasty. I added purple onion, chipolte peppers, canned chopped chili peppers & green chili salsa then added diced green onions when served. This recipe can be played with a lot. Would be good with most any meat, especially pork.

I made this for dinner and the house smelled great and the taste was even better. We ate ours on softened corn tortillas with shredded lettuce and cheese. If I had an avacado that would have been good on it as well along with some sour cream. The chicken was so tender and flavorful. I used 1 jar of Herdez hot salsa (always have several on hand). I thawed 5 split chicken breasts and cut each one into quarters. I didn't think it was too salty. I only used about 2 Tbsps of the taco seasoning.

my family loved this recipe!  I wish I could remember what salsa I used, as I'm sure that detail could make or break this recipe!  I skipped the taco seasoning as suggested.  use all the traditional mex toppings, and tortillas that you put on the griddle yourself (SO much better)!  For left overs, we just fixed up more tortillas, and fried the chicken up in a pan till warm - good leftovers too!

One of the best recipes I have tried on this website!  Be sure to use the best salsa you can find.  I use the fresh salsa from Costco and it makes a world of difference over regular jarred salsa.  I add the lime juice to the salsa mix and then add the cilantro at the end.  Sometimes I add a can of drained, rinsed black beans and corn.  Good with or without the additions.

What a great recipe! I made this in my crock pot the other week and it came out fantastic. I changed the recipe a tiny bit by slicing up one onion and one green bell pepper and adding it to the pot. Once everything was done, I shredded the chicken and put everything in whole wheat tortillas with some sour cream. They made great tacos!

this was soooo easy & so yummy! i doubled up on the lime & cilantro & followed everyones suggestion by going with a top of the line salsa (went with the hot).  i also added a can of black beans & chopped onion.  you can make this extra healthy by using low sodium taco seasonings & low sodium black beans.  the chicken was SO tender and so easy to shred! served it on whole wheat tortillas with lettuce, tomato, leftover rice from the night before, fat free cheese, fat free sour cream,  and black olives.  having the leftovers as a "taco salad" today for lunch!

I made this recipe as stated. The chicken was moist, flavorful and just delicious.This recipe is a keeper and I will be using it many times in the future. The leftovers are also versatile. I made a soup using chicken stock as a base an added this chicken at the end with a squeese of lime juice delicious.

This was amazing!  The flavor scored beyond the 5 star rating for us and so simple to make.  I had the ingredients on hand so this was even better. Hubby said this should be on the menu once a week for us. It is also cost effective for family suppers and a great dish to haul to social gatherings.  I added a little shredded cheese & sour cream as my toppers, but black olives & guacamole
would be great too.

It tasted ok.  Would add the cilantro in at the very end next time rather than cooking it for so long.

This was fairly good and incredibly easy.  I served with Lime Cilantro Rice, Easy Corn Salsa (both from AR), guacamole, cheddar cheese, lettuce and sour cream for yummy burrito bowls!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, ltlmsmfft!

I make this in the pampered chef deep covered baker in the microwave in 30 minutes!  I use fresh frozen cilantro cubes from trader joes, organic salsa and organic taco seasoning - eliminates additives and chemicals. We've made chicken tacos . . Soooo good!  I also added frozen corn and black beans.  Easy and delicious!

This can be used for so many things.  I made enchilladas and had enough left over for soup.  For the soup I added the block of cream cheese and the chicken broth as recommended BUT I also added spanish rice and a can of refried beans.  Made a thicker consistancy.  Topped the soup off with a handful of Santa Fe style tortilla strips (Fresh Gourmet brand).  AWESOME!!!

This was very disappointing - it smelled great when I got home, but the chicken had no flavor. I couldnt even tell cilantro was used (and I added more)
Sadly I will not be making this again, despite how easy it is

Loved the flavors of this.  I added a can of black beans (rinsed and drained) per others' recommendations.  Served over rice with a dollop of sour cream and cheddar cheese on top.  Yum.

This was just ok.  I followed the recipe and added some corn and a can of black beans as suggested.  I doubled the cilantro and the taco seasoning.  I served it with Mexican rice.  I probably wouldn't make it again. It wasn't exceptional; the flavour just wasn't there.

tis dish was delicious!  We had tacos and then chicken nachos with the leftovers.  It tasted like it was bought at a restaurant.  I will definately be making this again (but this time I will try freezing half since it made a ton).

This is my favorite recipe on AllRecipes to date.  I highly recommend it in nacho-form.  I say "boo" to the nay-sayers.  Easy to cook, tastes wonderful (and different from most taco recipes) & one of the first meals I go to when I am entertaining guests.

This was amazing! I used 3 chicken breasts, a jar of salsa, 1 lime, and then used seasonings (black/white pepper, cayenne pepper, cumin, etc) instead of taco seasoning to cut back on preservative and salt (I used a couple of shakes from my sea salt grinder). It was heavenly. I paired it with suateed onions and green peppers in garlic to make fajitas and served it with sour cream, cheese, avocado and small whole wheat tortillas. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Very easy prep and versatile meal, great for a crowd. I think it would work great as part of a warm dip. Make sure you love the salsa you use as that's pretty much what the final dish will taste like.

Great!  Just made this for dinner, and I loved it. After reading another review, I added some black beans and it totally amped it up for me. My husband loved it, too, and since he's a bit picky, it gets double points for that. The cilantro and lime make the recipe. I used mild pace salsa, and it really put a nice, subtle kick to it.  For me, it was a bit messy, but that's what made my husband love it so much! Will definitely make again, thanks!

Absolutely delicious! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, doubled the cilantro (because I am a cilantro freak), stir-fried some peppers and onions and served them with the shredded chicken as filling for soft tacos. Excellent! A definite keeper.

This was pretty good...I added the black beans and corn that others had suggested and because those are staples in my household lately...yet I am only giving it four stars because I do not think I paired it right. I just made some rice...but as I was eating it I was thinking that it would be great inside tacos as the author stated in the intro. It would be sooo great in a taco with lettuce, sourcream, and some more salsa. Other than that the mixture itself was pretty great...would maybe add some diced tomatoes to it..or at the end top with more salsa to moisten it up.

I used six chicken breasts on the bone instead of cutlets.   Added one cut up onion, three cloves of garlic and a tblsp of cumin.    We don't care for the taste of cilantro so replaced it with parsley.    Do not add any additional liquid as it creates an amazing sauce.    I served it over "spanish rice" with garlic bread!    Such an easy recipe I will share with friends and family!

I think this was a really flavorful recipe and will make it again.   I like cilantro so I added a little more.    The leftovers froze really well in ziploc bags in single serve sizes.

The great thing about this is that you can top the chicken with the sauce it was cooked in.  Your left with a taco that is so flavorful you won't even miss the sour cream and cheese you're used to adding.

Loved this recipe - first time using my slow cooker ;) I used fresh salsa, low sodium taco seasoning and the rinsed black beans. Whole wheat roti to accompany. This meal rocked!

Made as written except I added about three times more cilantro- never could taste it though!  It was just ok. Definitely good enough to eat but I won't make it again.  It is really easy and fast.

A new family favorite. My slow cooker is my best friend during the fall and winter months when I am working and the kids are involved in sports.  This chicken was so moist and flavorful, just perfect.  We used this chicken in tortillas with lettuce, cheese, sour cream and salsa.  Everyone loved it.

Loved this recipe.  I get requests to share it from guests and love how I can do all the prep ahead of time and just let it cook through our busy afternoons.  

I made it with just a pound of chicken, 2/3 jar of salsa, 2 T cilantro, juice from 1 lime and half the taco seasoning.   It wasn't too spicy for my kids and the higher salsa to chicken ration made it moist, not dry.  It was delicious and plenty of food for four adults.  I have cooked it twice once on Low in the slow cooker and once on High for the shorter amount of time.  Both worked great and the chicken shredded beautifully.  I used a taco seasoning recipe from this site since I already had the spices in my kitchen.

I thought this was pretty good. I might suggest adding slightly more salsa, and definitely staying closer to the 6 hour mark. This gave my husband and I enough chicken for 3 large meals. We made tacos two nights, and nachos the other night. It's GREAT on nachos!

This was absolutely delicious and really easy. My kids said it's the best thing I've ever cooked. I used cilantro lime salsa. I put it over cilantro lime rice. It was perfect.

This was absolutely delicious!  My whole family loved it, and I really loved how easy it was to make.  The chicken shredded very easily after cooking all that time.
I added extra cilantro (because I love cilantro) and next time I will add a bit more taco seasoning.
I served this chicken recipe with shredded cheddar cheese in the tortillas, and offered sour cream, lettuce, avocado, and extra salsa on the side.  This recipe is a keeper!

I don't know how this got such high ratings. Maybe I'm used to adding seasons instead of a "jar of salsa"...although the later sounds much easier! I was hoping to be very pleased. Instead, wishing I did my own thing with the chicken. It was tangy, in a weird way. Not a fan!!

Excellent. I couldn't wait to make this since I found this recipe a couple of weeks ago. I was all set to make it thinking I had all the ingredients when I discovered I only have 1/2 jar of salsa. So I used that and an 8ox jar of taco sauce. It worked out the same. It was perfect with tortilla, lettuce, cheese and pico de galo. So yummy...

THIS IS AWESOME! A major hit with my picky husband (who doesn't cook, lol). I used a larger jar of medium salsa for more kick but that was the only tiny alteration. Perfection, will be made over and over again. Super easy and delicious, perfect for a working mom :)

This was a really great recipe! Paired with some soft tortilla shells, tomato and avacado, these turned out delicious! The only thing I regret is that I did add some extra jalapeno peppers as it was cooking and it ended up a bit spicy for my liking!  I used "Fajita" seasoning instead of "Taco" and I think that would have been plenty enough spice.

This was fantastic and this recipe couldn't be any easier!  I used my own homemade salsa and it taste even better than I expected it to.  This was so good for soft tacos and amazing for nachoes.  I will be making this again very soon!  Thank you for a GREAT recipe!!!

YUM!!! I absolutely loved this recipe...was in a bind one afternoon and needed to put it on high for 4 hours instead of low for 6-8...and still came out marvelous. I maybe wouldn't put an entire package of taco seasoning in next time as it's a little overpowering and really hard to counterbalance with a lemon-y flavor...but we still loved it. My bf finished off about 4 tacos and wanted to go back for more but it was gone :). Definitely a hit.

I liked how easy and simple this was.... But it wasn't anything out of this world, just an ordinary average chicken taco. Good news is it is so easy and you can make lots extra to feed a crowd, so it would come in handy for a party.

My new go to for chicken tacos. I used a 16oz jar of Pace mild salsa. It is acidic enough on its own, so I omitted the lime juice. For the taco seasoning, I used 1 tbsp chili powder, 1.5 tsp cumin, 0.5 tsp garlic powder, 0.5 tsp onion powder. Will make over and over again.

Very good!   I had about 3 1/2 lb of chicken.  I also cooked on High for 3 hours, 45 minutes and it was plenty done.  I shredded the chicken and put it back in the juices.  Unplugged the crock and let it sit, covered, for about an hour, as we weren't ready to eat yet.  Served with tortillas, sour cream, extra salsa and the Baja Salad recipe from this site.  Everyone loved it!  Thank you!

Made this on Super Bowl Sunday for a large group. The flavors of the ingredients blended very well and the chicken shred perfectly after cooking on low for several hours. Served it with tortillas, rice and various toppings. Everyone loved it! Will definitely make this again.  Very yummy!

Very good, but thankful I didn't put in the whole envelope of taco mix.  It would have been a little too much.  I added a can of black beans the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Very good!

So good and easy to make! We like it best using  Salpica Salsa Verde with Charred Tomatillos  (a green salsa) instead of a red salsa. I've made this many, many times...we have it at least once a month! Usually serve with a side of Mexican Rice and Refried beans. For toppings we have Pica de Gallo, Sour Cream, Shredded Mexican Cheese Blend and avocado or guacamole! YUM!

This is now a family favorite! I also hosted a taco bar themed party and every single guest (around a dozen people) loved it. There wasn't a bite left! We usually use our chicken in tacos but I've also used it in burritos and nachos.

Great on a taco salad.  Like others, I subbed spices in for the spice packet to cut down on the sodium.  Could've used more lime and cilantro, though!  The flavor didn't really come through the salsa the way I'd hoped.  I'll double both next time.

This is my favorite way to prepare chicken for tacos, taco salad, burritos and tostadas. Perfect as is. I sometimes just put in frozen chicken breasts and cook all day while I am at work and it is perfect!

Prepared as directed EXCEPT I added a few cloves of fresh minced garlic and added additional fresh chopped cilantro as a garnish along with home made pico.  Everyone loved it!

It was delicious! However, I omitted the taco seasoning mix. Instead, fresh minced garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne powder. It came out delicious. The cayenne gave it a nice bite to the flavor. Highly recommend it. To warm up, I threw the entire batch into a pan with sauteed onions. PERFECT flavor. Great for large gatherings as you're able to cook ahead of time. Great addition to a tostada bar too :-).

Thought it was really good, but didn't taste like cilantro lime... just seasoned salsa chicken! SO GOOD THOUGH! I used chicken thighes instead of chicken breast because that's all I had. Still turned out great!

This was a delicious recipe. However, I did doubled the cilantro, I used 2 squeezed limes, 2 packs of taco seasoning and I added garlic powder and Tony's Creole Seasoning. My family loved this chicken. I paired it with refried beans, Spanish rice and tortilla chips. I will make this again and again.

Nom nom nom. 
Quick and easy. Drooling on my laptop as I enjoy this dish while writing this review.
I used the President's Choice Peach & Mango Salsa, Epicure's Taco Seasoning with some salt and white pepper. And added a little bit of Adobe seasoning just for some kick.
Am eating it just with taco chips as taco shells drive me nuts and am celiac so can't have the wraps. Had bought lettuce and tomato to go with it, but don't need them.

Nom nom nom.

Love this! Made it many times and it's great. I like to use my own homemade taco seasoning which is much healthier than those packages! Delicious recipe! I've made it without the cilantro because I didn't have any and it's still great.

Used 1/3 of the taco seasoning, Newman's Own Mango Salsa, 1 1/2 (juicy limes), doubled cilantro (added 15 min before cooking is complete), and 1 tsp of fresh garlic, a small red onion, and a can of rinsed black beans. What's most impressive is how simple and quick it was to prepare. Will 100% be making this again.

Great recipe. I followed others suggestions and omitted the taco seasoning. I doubled the fresh cilantro . Added 1 tbsp of garlic powder, 1 tbsp of onion powder, 1/4 tsp of chicken bouillon, 1/2 cup of chopped onion, 1/2 cup chicken broth and a clove of garlic.
 Added additional fresh cilantro, garlic powder and onion powder, salt,pepper 2 hours into cooking. I also made this on the stove on low heat for 3-4 hours and it was so tender and delicious. The flavor was amazing! Served it over white rice and  made tacos ( corn tortillas, cheese, salsa, guacamole, sour cream)the next day. This is a new family favorite!

This was SO good. I only had dried cilantro but otherwise made it exactly as is. My kids went back for thirds. That NEVER happens. Will be putting this in rotation. May try it with sliced green olives next time for added flavor (and because I use any excuse to use olives), but it is great the way it is.

Update: my kids got in the whole "taco Tuesday" kick and want this every week. I have made this in so many ways. Tacos, nachos, quesadillas, and even used on top of spaghetti and it was delicious. I like it better with medium salsa. Gives it more flavor. I make it in the morning, and it's ready by dinner time.  Takes 15 min total. And then you add it to anything. Top 5 of my family's favorite meals.

So yummy!! I used 3lbs of chicken and kinda modified the amounts of the other ingredients, then cooked it on high for 3 hours. I would also definitely recommend using a quality salsa, and reducing the amount of taco seasoning. I used half a packet and it was still pretty salty. We made tacos with corn tortillas, poured some of the remaining sauce over the chicken, and then topped it with mango! I will def be making this again!

Made this for a party. Very simple to make! Used low sodium taco seasoning, otherwise, followed instructions/ingredients as written. Did not find it too salty. Chicken was tender and delicious. It was a big hit! Leftovers were put to use in a salad, and was delicious! Would definitely make again!

Absolutely amazing! I'm embarrassed to admit it, but it was my first time ever cooking with fresh Cilantro. This was wonderful! I will be using Cilantro more often, WOW what flavor it truly adds! I shred the chicken after it was cooked for 6 hours on low (shredded using a hand blender on the lowest speed - try it, this shredding trick really does work). I then put it back in the crock pot for another half hour to finish marrying together. We used the chicken mixture in tortillas with a small amount of sour cream & cheese, and any preferred sauce. We did find that a mexican flavored rice goes much better with this chicken recipe, instead of spanish rice which is what we did the first time. Also you could put rice inside the tortillas with the chicken mixture as well, and that is yummy to! It was a very nice change of pace for us! We love it so much, that now we're making a large batch of this to also use for a couple of different mexican style dishes to use in for the week to save time! Love, love, love it!!

I just made this for my book club, with only minor modifications: I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, b/c thighs are cheaper and, to me, juicer. I also took someone else's advice and added the cilantro and lime (2 instead of 1) during the last hour. 

Really easy, quick cooking and super delicious. The day after book club, I grazed on the leftovers all day, making chicken tacos for breakfast and chicken nachos for lunch. This is definitely going into the menu rotation.

Really fantastic. Since I need to eat low sodium, I skipped the pre-packaged taco seasoning and made my own leaving out the salt and also found a very low sodium salsa. I added onions and garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was awesome!

This was a really simple recipe. The second time I made this recipe, I used 1/2 jar of salsa, added 1 chopped onion, and 2 limes + zest. It is important to only shred the chicken before serving. I suggest taking the chicken pieces out, shredding the chicken, and serving the sauce separate so everyone can add as little/much sauce as they want. I serve this dish in soft taco shells with brown rice and fresh cut mangoes. It is really so delicious and healthy.

This was quick & easy...we all enjoyed it!  Shredded some leftover grilled boneless/skinless chicken breast.  Adjusted recipe to use only 1 LB of chicken, but used 1.5 times the amount of recommended salsa (Pace Medium heat), lime juice and taco seasoning.  Omitted cilantro (hubs hates it) and made soft chicken tacos with soft flour tortillas, shredded Romaine, shredded sharp cheddar & diced tomatoes.  Giving 4 out of 5 because had to up the seasoning per reviewer feedback however, this is a very quick, tasty & healthy meal for a busy weeknight...give this one a try...you can't go wrong!

This is one of our favorite recipes! It's so easy and simple. We use spicy salsa and seasoning for that extra heat. Also, I add about a tablespoon of red pepper. I'd recommend it if you like spice! It's better with hard taco shells. The juice from the chicken makes the soft wraps a little soggy.

It was fine (I made my own homemade taco seasoning from a recipe), but now I've read a few more reviews, I wish I would have doubled it. I did use kind of cheap salsa, but I also used fresh onion and garlic but it wasn't all that flavourful. It was OK and it all depends on what you do with the shredded chicken that makes it good. Agree with another reviewer that it would make good enchiladas - add corn, black beans, enchilada sauce, cheese and sour cream and it would be amazing.

I never tried the recipe as is, but adapted it with ingredients in the fridge I thought would work.. and it was delicious!!!
All ingredients listed in the recipe made it into my dish (used homemade taco seasoning i googled). A couple reviewers said to use a high-quality salsa, I just used Tostitos brand medium spice salsa and it worked fine. 
In addition to this I added half an yellow onion, two stalks celery finely chopped, 1 cup canned 6 bean medley, 1 cup chicken stock, 1/3 of a jalepeno.
Cooked in the slow cooker on low 8 hours. Good lord it was good. YUMMMMMM! Will most definitely be making this again!

I've tried this several times to feed a large group and it's always a hit! The quality of the salsa makes a difference and I usually add a little extra lime and cilantro because I love those flavors. Any leftovers can be made into quesadillas, enchiladas, more tacos, etc. I highly recommend this recipe!

We love this, and it is so easy! Perfect for a busy day. Followed suggestion to add cilantro for last hour or two of cooking, and used sodium-free taco seasoning I make at home.

This quickly became a family favorite. I add the lime and cilantro 1/2 to 1 hour before dish is finished cooking.  Also, I make a double batch and use the leftovers to start a yummy chicken tortilla soup (adding cans of diced tomatoes, black beans, corn and chicken broth, topped with cheese and corn chips).

This was a hit at my work potluck!,  I took some of the tips by leaving out the taco seasoning, added sweet onion instead. 2 hours before serving, added the black beans and frozen corn, along with roasted green chilies. Just before serving, added more cilantro and another lime. Yum!!

I never seem to remember the taco packet but I have a big thing of cajun seasoning to which I just add cumin and a little more chili powder.  I prefer using a salsa verde because man it has a great taste.

Really tasty AND EASY!

I did not have a taco packet - I used a fajita seasoning packet instead.. 

FAMILY LOVED IT!

I used my pampered chef salad chopper
http://www.pamperedchef.com/our_products/catalog/product.jsp?productId=15646&categoryCode=CE

to easily chop up the the chicken when it was done...

A very good recipe; like others, I used my own spices to lower the sodium, but the packaged taco seasoning is easy & quick!
 You can also add veggies, serve over rice, as part of a (chicken) taco salad, or in tortillas, but use FRESH lime juice and cilantro to have the best flavor.

I saw this recipe, read all of the reviews and made it the very same night. We had guests for dinner and everyone enjoyed it immensely.  I followed the recipe including using a can of beans and a can of corn that I threw in about after about 3 hours of cooking.   There is a lot of liquid but a slotted  spoon took care of that and as the mixture sat it absorbed nicely.  I served it with lime cilantro rice (Japanese white rice with fresh lime juice, cilantro and salt to taste) and the usual taco fixings.   What an easy and delicious "go to" recipe.

I had a freezer-burned bag of chicken thigh strips that I knew could only be saved by a slow cooker recipe.  Not only was this one edible, it was very good...even my picky kids ate it!  I literally just threw the frozen mass of chicken in my slow cooker with the other ingredients, cooked on high and stirred until it thawed, then set it on low until done.  Easy, and I have enough left over for another meal (enchiladas this time).  I doubled the cilantro and lime, and used an Ortega 40% less sodium taco seasoning packet.  I can see where using a regular packet would be too salty, so I will definitely use the reduced sodium packet again.  Next time I will use a fresh salsa or pico de gallo, which I think will enhance the taste, and I can't wait to make it again with fresh chicken.  But if you have a chunk of freezer-burned chicken, don't toss it, make this recipe.

Made this for husband, he rated it a 9 out of 10 (a record for me! lol) SO incredibly easy, lots of leftovers. I only put 1.5 lbs of chicken in, lots of lime and cilantro for more strength in flavor. I have made dozens of recipes that said they were top rated, but turned out bland. This one really is a winner.

A favorite. I use homemade taco seasoning and salsa. Delicious. We're trying to eat less carbs so we have "taco salads" using this chicken and sauce as dressing.

I did the optional 8 hours in my slow cooker and was terribly disappointed in the results. I will try this again but next time I will only let cook for the recommended 4 hours. It just came out bland with a hint of overcooked citrus. Served it with flour tortillas and sour cream.

Outstanding! I made this exactly according to recipe and it was terrific! Easy, versatile and yummy!

Three members of my family are not eating wheat so we made a sort of taco salad with shredded lettuce, sautéed yellow peppers, avocado, black beans, hot sauce, cheese, sour cream, salsa and mounds of this chicken. It was amazing! The other 2 members of my family made small burritos and loved it as well.  As reviewers have said, you can do a lot with this recipe by using different salsas, adding different veggies or beans, spicing it up or down, or even adding indian spices. I will definitely be making this again.  (I had 2.95 lbs of skinless, boneless breasts, cooked on high for 4 hours before shredding, and used Green Mountain Gringo jar salsa.)

Good flavor. Cooked this in the crock pot on low for just under 8 hours and the chicken was very tender. Next time I would probably do my own seasoning as the packet of taco seasoning was too salty.

Delicious! Served with taco shells and cheese. I use 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp garlic powder in place of the taco seasoning. It's much healthier and gluten free.

I was trying to find something new for low-calorie lunches for work and this fit the bill perfectly! After reading the reviews of how salty the recipe can get with a packet of taco seasoning (and trying to keep to a low sodium diet), I omitted the packet and used McCormicks Salt-Free Southwest Seasoning. I halved the recipe and only used about 2 Tbls. of salsa (since that is loaded with sodium), and threw in a whole can of low sodium petite diced tomatoes. I also had some red onion and added about 1/4 cup of those. Those were the only changes I made and it was so delicious. Served on a whole wheat tortilla with light sour cream and low-fat cheddar cheese made for yummy lunches that were the talk of the office!

This was really pretty good, I added a little extra lime and cilantro about 30 min before serving; using this as soft chicken taco filling! I also didn't have enough skinless boneless breasts, so I added a couple thighs I had in the freezer to get enough chicken in there! I doubt that made any diffrence to the end results, and I am also happy with all the left overs. I will try and use them up in chicken enchiladas later, so this is a winner in my book!

This was just ok. I cooked 4 breasts for 5 hours, the chicken was dry. The flavor was overwhelmed by the taco seasoning, that's all you tasted. There is nothing wrong with it tasting like chicken tacos, but you don't need the cilantro & lime in the mix, serve it along with other toppings.

My family and I really enjoyed this easy recipe. I used less chicken then called for and it still made for a huge portion. Served it the first night over rice then made a pasta bake with the leftovers the next night. Will definitly keep this one on hand.

THIS WAS SO GOOD!
I didn't have salsa. Used a can of diced tomatoes instead (less sodium anyway!). Since I halved the recipe I used half a packet of taco seasoning. I added, upon another user's recommendation, a pack of frozen corn and a can of black beans. I also added the cilantro towards the end, and when I did that, I added a bit of crushed garlic also because I just love garlic.
THIS WAS SO GOOD. We ate the filling with flour tortillas and had tacos. There is enough broth in the leftovers that you could eat it as soup if you wanted. I love that this recipe is essentially super healthy if you watch the sodium, and is adaptable. We will be making this time and time again!

I've made this recipe 3x now, and it gets wonderful reviews each time. The only thing I change is the seasoning packet. Weber Grill seasonings makes a southern Whisky marinade packet that works so well with these favors. Grab some individual tortillas,  then any toppings you like(cheese, rice, beans, hot sauce)..but you won't need them and you're ready to rock!

Per other reviewers I used good quality salsa, probably used 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro and the juice of 2 limes.  I have made this recipe twice, and not a bite goes to waste! Once I used packaged seasoning, and the next I put in my own seasoning. Didn't turn out too salty either way, and was delicious.

This was so delicious! All 3 of my children wanted seconds, even my 10 month old. I did add a can of rinsed black beans, served over rice, and topped with a Mexican blend of cheese. This recipe is going on my rotation.

I threw in some black beans and corn. Doubled the cilantro and lime joice and also added fresh garlic. I used roasted green chilie salsa and regular, medium heat generic salsa. I did not add any taco seasoning and it was just delicious! It freezes well too! Thanks for the recipe! I will definately add this to my regular meal plan!!!

LOVED it. I used a mild sweet mango peach salsa. Next time I think I will double the salsa. I think I overcooked mine just a touch, the chicken was a little dry. But the flavor was very fresh. I also added more cilantro than the recipe calls for, I used almost an entire bundle. Not that you can ever have too much cilantro haha.

The first time I made this which was about 1 year ago, I thought it was the 'bomb'. Great smell as its cooking, chicken was tender and falling apart, the cilantro I doubled because one of your reviewers had done this - great recipe.  The next time I made it I did two crock pots as we were having our children and our grandchildren over and had some left over..I made soft chicken tacos with sour cream and guacamole, to die for! And the next day I used up what was left and added corn, black beans, stewed tomatoes and diced onions, and added about a cup of water. This is my new chicken tortilla soup. Put in a bowl and added shredded jack cheese, tortilla chip strips and a dab of sour cream. Being hispanic, I was leary but it has my vote ;-D

This was SO GOOD!!! I followed the ingredients and amounts exactly plus added a can of drained Mexi corn shortly before serving (just to heat the corn through). I threw this together over lunch and put it on low for about six hours - it was PERFECT when I got home from work! The chicken just fell apart and shredded perfectly. I served this with a Cilantro Lime Rice recipe I found on here - when I make this again I'll probably serve with just regular rice (the Cilantro Lime Rice was delicious but maybe too much lime and cilantro between that and the chicken) or even in tortillas/tacos. Regardless, this will definitely be a regular for me. It was almost better as leftovers too! Overall just a great recipe - very few ingredients (cheap!), little prep time (easy!), and DELICIOUS!!!

This was such and easy and delicious recipe! I only used about a quarter of a packet for the taco seasoning, because I read that it can get salty and I also added some corn and an extra lime. The taste is great! I served the chicken over beans and a tostada shell. I will serve over rice next time so it can absorb the juices.

I love the ease, the flavor and the versatility of this.  It's a taco or enchilada filling.  It's great over rice or in a wrap.  Delicious in salad.  Good with beans.  So easy, so good!

I've made this several times now. So easy, healthy, and delicious. Be sure to drain your chicken before your shred it, otherwise you end up with runny tacos. It's a great base recipe to make early in the week and then use the leftovers for something else later, like enchiladas or chicken tortilla soup.

Did everything exact and was very disappointed. Tasted dry and almost flavorless. Worked ok when used in a salad and smothered with more flavors to carry it. Will try again with recommendations from other reviews.

This was a winner in my house! All 4 kid's loved it and had second's. I did make a minor modification. I did not add the lime juice and cilantro until after it was done cooking. I added it after I had shredded the chicken and before serving. My kid's liked this on flour tortillas with cheese and sour cream. I liked it by itself.

This is the first dish I ever tried with fresh Cilantro and this is an ingredient I really enjoy. This was great for the whole family.

After reading previous reviews and hearing that a few times it had come out salty I made this using reduced sodium taco seasoning and turned out great!!!

Definitely going to use this recipe again!!!

We loved this dish.  It was the easiest thing to make.  I put frozen chicken breast, a can of Rotel, sliced onion, tons of garlic, along with the taco seasoning and lime juice, into the crock pot for about 4 hours on high.  The chicken was incredibly tender and shredded so easily.  I bet I didn't spend 5 minutes total making this, and it was delicious, cheap and healthy.  It also makes a ton, so we had leftovers several times.  What else can you ask for?  Definitely going in the regular rotaton.  I wish I had a whole repertoire of recipes like this!

OMG. I love this recipe. I have made this about a dozen times. It is great as it but I have been making modifications lately and like it even more! I add - about a cup of chopped cilantro, a can of black beans, an extra diced onion or two and the whole big jar of salsa. I serve it with sour cream, more salsa, shredded cheese, fresh cilantro, white rice.  Super tasty! You can also add a can of jalapenos if you want to kick it up. Really tasty. Super easy! Oh and we have used the filling for fahitas and tacos too. I make my own taco seasoning mix so the sodium is cut. I could eat this every day! Makes tones of leftovers!

I have been making a similar version with just salsa for a few years and this was a delicious improvement. I just threw in frozen chicken breasts with the sauce. Served with chips or in a tortilla.

I used thighs instead of breasts, and the chicken just fell apart after 4 hrs on high.  This chicken is very tasty, and has so many uses.  We made one batch, and used it for 2 meals - taco salads one night and fajitas the other.  Kid-friendly and yummy.

Made this one night following the recipes and adding a little more cilantro at the end for flavor.  Had it as tacos and neither my husband or I thought it was spectacular.  A little too salty.  However, a few days later we used to leftover shredded chicken to make quesadillas and they were excellent!  Sauteed green pepper, green onion, and corn separately.  Then made our quesadillas with the chicken, veggie mix, and cheese.  Liked them so much more the second time!  And, a good use of the leftovers.

Excellent and so easy.  I forgot the taco seasoning and it was still good.  I think i'll only put in half a package next time since a whole one sounds pretty strong.

I loved this one...no complaints or changes made...fresh cilantro is key and I may have used a tad more than called for...the smell cooking was amazing. And the salsa I used was a black bean and corrn salsa....very yummy in a soft whole wheat tortilla with a lil lettuce, tomato, cheese, low fat sour cream and some taco sauce.... YUMMY!!!!

Delicious and easy!  I didn't add the cilantro to the crock pot, because I like it fresh.  Other than that, it's fool proof.  Chicken was tender and super easy to shred.

Excellent Recipe... The only variation i did is to add onions and green pepper. I also used frozen chicken. It came out great. Husband and kids love it !!! You can eat it with rice, flour tortilla or corn tortilla. Great as a taco filling.

Exceptionally easy.  It tastes like you would expect.  It's not anything amazing, but it's definitely worth making if you're looking for an easy go-to slow cooker chicken recipe.  I will probably make it again just because it was so simple.  I think some other reviewers talked about this, but a good salsa makes a difference in the end result.

Easy and tasty!  This chicken was great in quesadillas, and would be good for tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc.  I used Chi Chi's salsa.

My family did not like this meal.  I don't know if it was the salsa that was used but it did not taste good.  I think next time I will omit the salsa and try adding peppers such as jalapenos.

Absolutely AWESOME! Made it this evening for the Husband, 2 kids and In-Laws. Served it over Cilantro Basmati Rice and along side Mexican Braised Celery. We altered the recipe just a bit-used 5 chicken breasts and 36 oz. salsa.  We used the Safeway Select Three-Bean and Pepper Salsa. I wouldn't change a thing! Both my Husband and I love spicy, but our young children and my Mother-In-Law can't handle heat. The spice was perfect for everyone and the flavor made up for the lack of heat. Loved it! The recipe is easy enough to make adaptations according diners taste. We can't wait to try it with new additions next time!

My family LOVED this!  I used 4 chicken breasts and a roasted restaurant style salsa - we had lots of leftovers.  This chicken is also fantastic on a baked potato with some pico, sour cream and cheese.

i LOVE this recipe!!! I cook it on low for 7 hours and do not add cilantro because my fiance and roommate hate it and it is perfect! we have tried it in flour and corn tortillas and decided corn tortillas are the best with this recipe! we serve it with sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and beans! its one of my favorite recipes!

This was very good and very easy.  We shred up the chicken and eat it in a tortilla with taco toppings.  We prefer this the ground beef tacos now!

My husband loved this! I threw it in the crockpot before church, we came back and the house smelled incredible! I followed the recipe as described - perfect mix of flavors. We then stuffed the chicken and salsa mix into soft taco tortillas and added a dash of shredded cheese, dollop of sour cream, and freshly cut cilantro. DELICIOUS!

This is so simple and so delicious. I like that you can change the heat by changing the salsa and taco seasoning from mild to medium to hot.  Great also as a main dish with rice.  To use with pasta just double the salsa,taco seasoning, cilantro and lime to give you more sauce to use and then cut you your children into smaller portions to serve.  Kinda Mexican Spaghetti.

This is an AWESOME recipe. I made it for a Mexican Theme Party and everyone loved it..! I totally agreed with my other cook friends who has tried this recipe, using good quality ingredients makes this recipe a WINNER!. I added a little bit of Chilli Powder for extra spicy or just use a hot salsa. Double the cilantro and taco seasoning is a plus. As someone said is to salty. NOT AT ALL...this has a perfect amount of salt since the salt come already in the spices and other ingredients used for this recipe. Try it and you will try once and once more.   ;-)

This is fantastic!!! Will definitely make again.  Will use someones suggestion to make and use for chicken enchilades.  Didn't use pkg of taco seasoning, think would be to salty, instead sprinkled some salsa seasoning I had, could use tony's or a variety of seasonings.....2 limes.  Easy and awesome!
02/05/17:  Made again-SO GREAT!!  This time I did use 2T of spicy ranch seasoning and 2T of taco seasoning.  Built bowls using this with allrecipes black beans,corn and yellow rice-saved under sides.

This is so delish! I made it in the slow cooker the first time and I just made it on top of stove with leftover store bought baked chicken. We eat as tacos, over salad, and ttoday over brown rice with salad and black beans on the side. YUMMY

Loved this recipe. Added one small yellow onion and used a pricey hot salsa. So good, even my fiance liked it and he is not easy to please. Served it with whole wheat tortillas, and Spanish rice.

This recipe is awesome. I have made lots of spicy beef and pork in the slow cooker, and now thanks to this recipe I have a quick easy chicken option too. The funny thing is, I made this cilantro lime chicken with the cilantro and lime omitted so I didn't have to run to the store! Just the salsa, spice pack and chicken is perfect for us. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is sooooo easy and yummy.  I used a spicy salsa verde instead of a regular salsa, and cooked on low for 6 hours.  I can't wait to make this again and again!

We tried this out with a cheap chunky salsa and it still came out fabulous!  I did as another reviewer had said and juiced the lime right before serving, this gave it a nice flavor kick.  I will definitely make this again, only next time, I will try using a salsa without large chunks, as my husband doesn't like tomatoes and picks them out (if they are nice and minced up, he won't be picky at the table!).

Easy AND Excellent. My husband and three kids loved this recipe and asked that I make it again. Served it with lettuce, cheese, sour cream and tortillas. Agree that it would be great with Spanish rice as well. May try that next time. Definitely recommend!

I made this recipe and it was a big hit! Everyone was going for seconds. I served it over linguini. After 4 hours in the slow cooker, I used two forks to pull apart and shred the chicken. I will be making this recipe again soon. I may even double the batch!

I have made this recipe a few times now, and it's probably the simplest recipe I have EVER made. The best part of course is that it tastes great. I think I eat it every meal until it's gone. We are not big fans of cilantro, so we eliminated it. We didn't have lime, so we used lemon juice. We only used 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning, and it was a low sodium version to begin with. We also used fresh chunky salsa, which I thought would really make a difference...but tasted pretty much the same when we used a chunky jar type. I just eat it on a plate, as is. I can't get enough of it.

Wow, this was really good.  As per some reviews, I used Pace picante sauce, added half can of corn, 1/2 minced onion and 1 minced garlic clove.  To cut down on the salt, I only used 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning.  I added the juice of one LARGE lime & the cilantro the last hour of cooking.  Tangy & delicious!

Very good. Made some changes based on previous reviews. Added a can of black beans, red peppers, mushrooms, corn and some adobo seasoning for salt. It was a little runny but overall tasted great. We took it for a dinner and all 3 pounds were gone from only 6 people eating. People were getting 2nds and 3rds!

I added 2 cups of chicken brother to this because my crock pot was nowhere near half full with this recipe.  Also, used 2 lbs chicken and 1.4 lbs pork.  It was still really watery at the end, so just removed the meat from the broth and shredded for tacos.  I'm sure I lost a good amount of flavor that way, but it was still pretty tasty!  The broth is delicious, so we're saving it and will use it for soup when we're sick of leftover tacos.  :)

I followed the recipe.  I used Medium salsa, next time I will use Mild as it was a bit hot for me.  I also used Trader Joe's brand taco seasoning which I think is a little hotter than most store bought mixes so I think that had added to the heat.  I don't have a slow cooker so I just simmered on the stove a few hours.  Serving over brown rice and veggie on the side.  I am freezing because I am cooking for myself and will be able to grab this quickly for a few buritos or over rice/beans.

Very good.. Im a huge cilantro fan. Just forgot to ad the sauce back with the chicken after I shredded it. This would have tasted much better (too dry without it).

I was skeptical of this recipe at first - how could so little ingredients be THAT tasty? But this recipe was not only simple, but delicious and versatile as well. We made tacos, but I also turned it into a version of chicken chili mac over noodles with some cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Will definitely make again. YUM!

Very good and very tender. Added a little more lime, cilantro, and threw in some homemade chili powder and pico, but otherwise followed the recipe. I used salsa verde for the jar of salsa and cooked on low for 6 hours. There was plenty of juice from the salsa left to pour over the chicken.

YUMMY!!!  I have made this twice in one week it is so  good.  Made it the first time and only had enough chx to make half a recipe.  We ate it over rice and topped it with cheese and sour cream.  The second time I made a full pot and made enchiladas with the mix. My husband wanted the leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.  A wonderful recipe to eat some now and freeze some for later.  I did not have taco seasoning so I used garlic pwd, onion pwd, paprika, chile pwd and cummin (just sprinkled a bit on top of the chicken before adding the salsa)  Thank you for a great addition to my recipe box!

Absolutely wonderful!  I added the black beans as others had suggested and made my own taco seasoning.  Tonight was a trial run, teenagers are having a party this weekend.  I got 2 thumbs up to serve it to their friends.  That makes it better than 5 stars!!!

I made this exactly as written and it was so delicious!!  I used pace picante sauce for the salsa and didn't find that the chicken was too salty at all.  It was perfect.  My husband raved about the chicken burritos I made with it.  It would be great in tacos, taquitos and enchiladas as well.  Mmmmm!

So easy to throw in the crock pot when you don't have a lot of time in the evening.  We made chicken tacos out of it.  It would also be great for a taco salad or a quesadilla.  We will have this again.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I changed was to double the taco seasoning. 

I read where someone thought the 6 hours on low had burned the salsa and that the sauce was too runny, however, I did not have this problem. 

The salsa cooked perfectly on 6 hours at low setting and the sauce wasn't soupy at all once I shredded the chicken. 

I added a can of black beans at the end and served it over white rice. This is a keeper and I will definitely be making it again.

I have been making this recipe for years.  You don't have to use anything expensive.  I just use what every taco seasoning I have buy a cheap bottle of salsa and add water to cover the chicken.  We use it in tacos, burrittos and enchilladas.  You can also make this recipe with a boneless chuck roast.

So good. My husband is not a fan of chicken but he really loved this. I did add drained and rinsed black beans. I served it wrapped in flour tortillas with a dollop of sour cream.

This was very delicious! I added more lime and cilantro, and shredded the chicken with the sauce to make tacos.

This is a fabulous dish.  Makes for great tacos and enchiladas!  I used chicken taco seasoning and 1/4 cup cilantro and less chicken.  Enchiladas were a big hit at our work potluck.

I never actually "review" on this site but this recipe is worth reviewing.  I actually only did 2 breasts and cut down all the ingredients except for the salsa.  (Just to make sure I had enough.)  I used two Herdz salsa from the can (7oz) and the rest of the ingredients.  Can't tell you how much I LOVE MY CHICKEN!!

Thanks again!

used 5 large frozen chicken breasts, sauce was very watery by the time it was ready. Had to thicken with a bit of corn starch. Served over sprouted brown rice, flavor was great, chicken was tender.

This was a great, easy recipe! Variation: I love cilantro so I added more to the recipe as well as fresh, diced cilantro for topping/garnishment on the tacos. I used lime juice from a bottle (worked just fine). I also added 1 can of black beans and 1 can of corn. We used grilled flour and corn tortillas. Just an excellent dish, and made enough for 2 dinners (for 2 people)!

This is a great basic, versitile taco meat recipe. It really couldn't be simpler. I used a high-quality black bean salsa and 3 tbsp of a homemade taco seasoning mix that's a little lower in salt. Also, I used chicken breast tenderloin pieces and the recipe only took about 4.5 hours on low. 4 out of 5 just because I felt it could have been more spiced and flavorful, but then again it does allow for flexibility in seasoning for different tastes. I like spicy, but not everyone does. Thank you!

Pretty good and really easy.  I saw someone say that it was too salty..so I found some low sodium Taco seasoning (40% less sodium)  and only used half the packet.  It was wasn't bland at all and had great mexican flavor.  The first time I made this I added a can of rinsed pinto beans which turned out great,,this time I'm going to try a cup of frozen corn.

Very simple recipe.  I added a can of corn and light red kidney beans.  We served it over brown rice since we didn't have taco supplies.  But I know it would be delicious served that way as well.

Wow!!  Very tasty and easy!!  I used taco seasoning I recipe from this site. I made recipe as is with the exception of  taking the advice of others, I added a 12 oz. bag of sweet corn niblets and 15 oz can of black beans.  I put them in when there was 1 1/2 hours until it was done as I was leaving for evening church.  Mine turned out more like a soup as the salsa I used was from a bulk store in a large container and had more liquid in it.  My husband who is a soup lover ate it that way.  I saute'd red and green pepper slices and sweet yellow onion and then used a slotted spoon to drain the chicken mixture and had mine wrapped in a tortilla with cheese and sour cream, YUM!!!  We are making nachos with the left overs today and I am sure there will be enough for my husband to have a couple bowls of soup!  Makes a lot!!  Thanks for sharing a great tasting and EASY recipe.  I made a jar of the taco seasoning I by Bill Echols  (I calculated for 64 servings) from this recipe and then just scoop out what a need for recipes calling for taco seasoning.

Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken Haiku: "Shredded, great goodness! (I used bone-in breasts instead.) Easy meal to make!" My bone-in breasts, with the same ingredients as the recipe called for, took about 5 1/2 hrs. on low for the chicken to just fall away tender from the bone. I shredded it (w/ minimal effort) and put it back in the crockpot on warm b4 we served it over tostadas w/ lettuce, tomato, cheese and onions. I used the leftover chicken this afternoon in a grilled quesadilla to excellent results too; thanks for a terrific recipe to add to my regular rotation!

Ended up doing it on the stove top. Browned the chicken, added it to the salsa mixture, simmered for 30 minutes, then took the chicken out and shredded it. After the chicken was shredded, I returned it to the simmering salsa mixture and waited 10 minutes before serving. Very tasty on top of fresh flour tortillas served with refried black beans and homemade Spanish rice.

Easy and good.  The only changes I made was that I used my own taco seasoning blend that I make and I used beef because that is what I wanted today. I could see this being great with chicken too and will definitely try it in the future.

Made as recipe called and put into tortillas with some cheese.  Topped with an enchilada sauce and baked in the oven.  Topped with a little sour cream and salsa to eat.  So good!  Wouldn't change a thing.

Very good. I served it on soft taco shells with pico de gallo, olives, shredded lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. Very delicious, you could do just about anything with it! I made half the recipe, and it was enough for two tacos for my husband, one taco for me, and probably about 2-3 leftover tacos!!

My husband and I liked this very much, but we thought it was a little too spicy. I used my homemade salsa instead, so that may have been the problem. Next time I'm going to cut some of the heat out of my salsa, and add a little less taco seasoning.

This was a very easy recipe, and I loved that dinner was ready when I walked in the door!

I made this last night and it was fantastic! A couple of changes, though. Instead of regular taco seasoning I used a small jar of Penzey's Chili 9000, which has no sodium, but is very spicy.  I added more cilantro (we like cilantro), and after squeezing the lime juice into the pot, I added the peel to the pot.  This added to the lime flavor. I also used chicken thighs instead of breasts. My husband, who never raves, raved. This will go into the family cookbook, for sure!

Very easy and tasty. I used a lime and garlic salsa so the lime flavor was even more prominent. I mixed it with some brown rice and black beans for mini tacos. The rice, beans, and tortilla really cut down on the spicyness, which I didn't like. I added frozen corn to the leftovers and used them for quesadillas.

SO good! When it was done, I took the chicken out, shredded it, and returned it to the slow cooker. Then all that yummy sauce soaked further into the chicken. My super-picky eater husband loved it too. It's now a regular at our house!

Super yummy and so easy! I followed the recipe exactly (I love recipes with few ingredients) and it came out so tender. It reminds me of the shredded chicken at one of my favorite restaurants.

Easy to make & my family LOVED IT!  The only variation I did was that I did not add the salsa in the cooking process, and left it on the side as an optional topping.  It tates even better as left overs.

Delicious. I did cut the flavorings in half, and it was still plenty hot, so I could cut it again and it would still be plenty flavorful.

The chicken was surprisingly tender with a good taste.  I will try it with black beans and corn and serve as tacos next time.  Overall I liked it and my 5 year old ate it.

After 4 hours of cooking, the chicken is totally dry (despite having lots of sauce).  Also, it's too hot.  There is almost no fat in the recipe, so the dish doesn't have any richness.  Hot, dry chicken -- that's all this is.  If you sprinkled pepper sauce on a chicken breast and then cooked it too long, you'd get the same flavor.

I used 2 10 oz cans of rotel instead of salsa and cooked in my pressure cooker and it was amazing! Restaurant quality. (Ninja foodi) Coated the chicken in the mixture then removed the chicken, put mixture in the pot and place the chicken on the low rack and pressure cook on hi for 10 mins.

Absolutely delicious! I made this with a 16 oz. tub of fresh salsa from the refrigerated produce section & chicken tenders. I think that makes a big difference, because I noticed some people saying it was too salty. It was perfectly spiced made with the fresh salsa. I served it up with some deli made tortillas, guacamole, extra fresh cilantro, sour cream, and shredded cheddar jack cheese. We all made our own soft chicken tacos at the table and we loved it. This was a big hit at my house, and will become a regular meal for us. As directed, this makes about 3 meals for a family of 4, so it’s economical too.

5 stars from everyone in my family. Had a flavorful "sauce" to it, so the chicken wasn't dry. I added onion & 1/2 c. salsa verde it the recipe-super easy & great for a large crowd. I served with tortillas, black beans, cilantro, sour cream, cheese & onion.

I would make my own taco seasoning next time, but delicious nonetheless. I used pico rather than jarred salsa. Served up with fresh chopped romaine, more pico, homemade guac with a couple of baked corned tortillas. Delicious and healthy

It  was pretty good. I tend to cook slow cooker recipes for a shorter amount of time at a lower temperature than the recipe says as my machine is old and gets very hot. Warning! I used medium salsa and it was very spicy. Unless you can handle the heat I would recommend using mild salsa. Also it could even take less salsa; there was a lot leftover in the pan even after coating the chicken breasts fully.

Really good, although we let it go for 8 hours (a work shift) and it was too dry. Maybe extra salsa next time because we only do crock pot meals while we work.

Just made this tonight. It was amazing. I did double the fresh cilantro because I love it but otherwise follow the recipe. This will become a staple dinner in our house. I sautéed peppers and onions and served it all fajita style with flour tortillas which I would highly recommend.

I made my own taco seasoning using another recipe on AllRecipes.  I also used fresh salsa I got at our local deli.  Finally I just laid a bunch of cilantro on top of the chicken and salsa mix (rather than adding chopped cilantro) before closing the slow cooker.  I removed the cilantro before shredding the chicken.  Please note that this tastes better the next day.  I probably would have only rated this 4 stars on the day I made it but it was really good the day after.

I made this receipe using the basic ingredients .  Instead, i cut the chicken breasts into strips about 1/2 wide the length of the breast.  I then coated the breasts meat strips  with the the ingredients  in a bowl.  I then put oil in frying pan  and sauted the breast meat for tacos.  
Very tasty and very tender in soft tacos
With lettuce, salsa more cilantro and medium  shredded cheese .

Awesome recipe!  Everyone loved this!  I did add a can of black beans, and made my own taco seasoning.  I served it over rice and topped it with cheddar, guacamole and sour cream.  Yum.  Next time I'm going to add onions, peppers, tomatoes and corn.  And maybe a little more lime.

I decided to make this recipe and then read the negative reviews the morning I was going to make this. So I made a few alterations but I'm not sure it made that much of a difference. I can say that the recipe came out very good and I would definitely make it again. I might even try it without my alterations to see how the original recipe was.
My changes were: 
1: I added about 1/2 cup of water to the salsa jar to rinse it out and put it into the crockpot.
2: I diced up and added 1 small onion and 2 cloves of garlic.
3: I sprinkled about 1/2 tablespoon each of  cumin and chili powder on top of the chicken after coating it with the salsa mixture. 
4: Mix it up and flip the chicken 1/2 way through cooking time.

This was a hit with the family! I ended up using chicken thighs and lemon juice because it's what I had and it still ended up awesome. Next time I'll definitely use lime. I also baked it in the oven. :) Yummy! Served it with tortillas.

I made this for taco night.  My children are picky eaters and I always take a gamble with new recipes,  but they LOVED this!  I prefer dark meet so I used thighs.  Other than that I made the recipe as written.  We ate it on flour tortillas browned over the stove flame.  We garnished with cheese,  sour cream and chopped cilantro.  Simple but so good.

This was really easy to make. It does make a very large amount. Perfect for family get togethers. I did a taco bar and still had leftovers for taco salads and an entire dish of chicken enchiladas to freeze for another meal. I did use verde salsa instead of red but that’s just a personal preference.

We had this at my grandmas last weekend. I couldn't believe how delicious it was! This is definitely going to be a staple in our home  now on . We used her homemade salsa that she jars, canned chicken, and taco seasoning. She added a little extra chili powder and cumin I believe,  maybe garlic powder and didnt have lime or cilantro. How we served it was butter one side of a tortilla, lay it butter side down on a hot pan, spread with beans, add the chicken mixture, then cheese. Fold over like a taco, flip and cook on both sides until desired crispness. Sooo good served like this. I'm making it tonight but only have picante salsa, so not sure how different it will impact it.

I liked this one but it definitely needs more seasoning, but that may depend on what kind of salsa you use.  I may try it next time with two cans of Rotel, and then adding my own seasoning or adding more lime and cilantro closer to the end of cooking as some people have said here.

I kept the sodium low by making my own taco seasoning from an AR recipe. It was very good! I used plain yogurt as sour cream and whole wheat tortilla.

Absolutely delicious! I have a big family and we still had left overs. I added red peppers to the crock pot., and topped it with avocado.  I made spanish rice for the side dish.  I am saving this to my favorites!

The lime didn't come through as much as I would have liked. I will make it again though because it's really easy and feeds  A LOT of people.

Delicious! BF couldn't quit raving about how good it was. Based on other reviewer comments, I cut the taco seasoning in half to avoid an overly salted result. It worked but next time I'll probably leave it out based on my salsa selection. Oh and I added a cup of water (I only made a half a batch) so that it would dry out while waiting for us on warm. We will be making this again for sure!

Very good. I used 50% more salsa than recommended and blended a medium and mild salsa jar from PACE. Shredding the meat was super easy and it was very tasty. I might want to tweak the taco seasoning by making my own blend to try and cut back on sodium. I did use the Olde El Paso 40% reduced sodium one. I would 100% make this again

My family absolutely loved this recipe. We had it for dinner and it's a new favorite. I used chunky medium salsa added 2 cups of water for more juice, 1 package of fiesta chicken taco mix by McCormick, 5 tablespoons fresh cilantro, and 2 full  Fresh squeezed limes juice. Plus 1/2 can of cento black beans.  After stirring everything together i added 3 skinless boneless chicken breasts. Cooked in my crockpot on high for 4 hour's. It came out so flavorful, juicy, moist chicken, it was out of this world and very simple to make. I heated up soft tacos, placed lettuce down first with more fresh cilantro, then added the chicken & juices from the crockpot, some shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream. This is a new favorite for our family.

Easily one of my favorite recipes I’ve found on this site. We double the lime and taco seasoning while also rubbing the chicken in a Mexican seasoning mix we’ve found. It comes out incredibly moist and falling apart. We enjoy it on fried white corn tortillas with whatever fixins including more fresh cilantro, verde salsa, and diced poblano pepper

I really like this! I love to cook, but sometimes you just wanna throw stuff together & still have a great dinner. This is that dish.  I add black beans & corn sometimes in last hour. I also throw in a bunch of cilantro. HInt....make sure you like cilantro BEFORE you make this....Cilantro can be a Love/Hate kinda herb. Love  to serve this on tortillas i warm on gas burner flame. Fresh guacamole, sour cream,  shredded Mexican cheese, cilantro & good  Mexican hot sauce on the side. Cilantro Lime rice side great too.  Very forgiving  recipe, play with it & make it your own.

This recipe is wonderful as is. I’ve made it many times by now and my husband and teenage son still request it at least once a month. It makes a lot and does great as leftovers and for lunches in tacos, burritos, and homemade burrito bowls; I’ve even served it a few times with tortilla chips, cheese and sour cream as a party appetizer. Works great for a large group (like an office potluck) because it keeps so well in a small crock pot on warm. My tweaks - I now make it with the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site (instead of prepackaged), and after trial and error I’ve found that using a mild salsa allows the cilantro flavor to come through the best. Wonderful, simple, crowd-pleasing recipe. Thank you!

This was delicious!  I made a few changes--I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs because my husband prefers dark meat.  After reading other reviews, I also chose to only use about 1/2 of the taco seasoning packet.   It had great flavor and I will definitely make this again.

I've been making a modified version of this dish for several years.  The recipe as written is a good base but it lacks substance to be a standalone meal which is typically my goal when using the crock pot.  I add extra cilantro & lime, a can of black beans (drained and rinsed), a can of corn (drained) or half bag of frozen corn, and use fresh salsa (Jack's brand is my fave)  vs canned.  We typically serve on flour tortillas with sour cream and shredded cheese or with tortilla chips as a party appetizer.  This was a perfect dish for busy evenings when everyone was eating at different times. Also freezes well.

Made this using a quart jar of homemade Salsa Verde and leftover berbere spices from an earlier dish in place of the salsa and taco seasoning. Excellent.

This was great for tacos. I actually made it without the cilantro (not by choice - I had run out) and it was still full of flavor and delicious! The family really enjoyed it.

Tastes like a couple of jars of stuff cooked in a slow cooker. Not memorable, salty and tomato flavored. 
The Cleanup shortcut of using a plastic liner to cook your food in is a little disturbing, especially since recent reports say not to.

This was a very good recipe.  I really loved how incredibly simple it was.  I think in the future I would doctor it just a bit to add more seasoning for my personal taste as I like a strong flavor.  Having said that, my wife loved it.

One of our new favorite chicken recipes. We will be having this one regularly. Simple to make and all 3 of my kids loved it too. 

We put it in flour and corn tortillas with lettuce, tomato and sour cream.

I added half a block of velvetta cheese, can of corn, and black beans.  Didn’t cook the cilantro with it, instead diced up that, an onion, jalapeño, and mixed it with the lime juice. Family loved it!

Great base recipe! I married three different partial jars of salsa I had on hand, juice of one lime, added a dash of tequila, threw in some black beans (drained and rinsed) and frozen corn, and used only half a package of low sodium taco seasoning then set on low for 6 hours. When I got home I added the fresh cilantro and juice of one more lime and let it sit on warm for another hour or so before serving over lettuce, yellow rice, with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of tortilla strips. This was amazing! Everyone went back for seconds.  As others have said the filling would be great for enchiladas, tacos, nachos, etc...

Super yummy!  It was super easy. On the advice of others, I made my own taco seasoning rather than buying a package so I could control the salt.

I used the rotisserie chicken from Costco! Dumped it all in, and it was amazing!  Saved time, and dinner was ready in an hour. We don't always have to use a slow cooker, to enjoy the same ingredients, you just have to plan your time accordingly.

This chicken was awesome! I used my own salsa and seasoning but made everything else the same. First night I made chicken street tacos with an avocado lime crema. Delicious! Then with leftovers I put some black beans, corn, rice, and the chicken together with the same sauce. The leftovers were just as tasty ??

Great the way it is and SUPER EASY to make!  I made this in the slow cooker overnight and put in the fridge for dinner the next evening.  We like the street taco flour shells which gives us many meals for the week.

This is super easy and good. I’ll definitely make it again. I added more fresh cilantro to each serving as cooking cilantro causes it to lose a lot of its flavor.

I didn’t have taco seasoning pre-made so I found a recipe and made it. Used frozen cubes of chicken and leftover salsa that was 1/2 a jar of regular red and 1/2 a jar of green verde. Paired with homemade tortillas, tomatoes, cheese and fresh cilantro on top and it was awesome!!

A new favorite in our house!! So simple to make and SO yummy!!! We have tried making this with different flavors of salsa and it has always been a success!! Pineapple/Hawaiian salsas are one of the favorite swaps and we like to place slices of pineapple on top of the salsa and chicken while it is cooking. ????????

I have a large family. Finding meals everyone likes can be a challenge. This one, however, was a hit!! So easy to make. I am a fan of cilantro so I did add a bit more than the recipe called for.  Will definitely be making this again.

Oh wow! This was really simple to make and even easier to eat! My family love it. There was ZERO conversation at the table because they were so busy eating. I loved it because it made soooo much! I used the recipe as a starting point. I used Salsa Verde, 2 limes, and a packet of low sodium taco seasoning. Added the fresh cilantro and 4oz of cream cheese after I shredded the chicken and returned it to the crock pot. Will use the remaining chicken to make enchiladas and nachos!

Very yummy! I used 4 pounds of chicken breasts but left all the ingredient amounts the same. It only took 3 1/2 hours on high in my slow cooker. Lots of uses for this--we already made chicken tacos, taco salad, and chicken quesadillas. Thanks!

It is super easy and a family favorite.  I adjusted the recipe slightly to match our preferences- more cilantro and seasonings, diced onion, added frozen corn and can of rinsed black beans.  Serve tacos with diced avocado, shredded cheese, sour cream, diced red onion, salsa and chopped cilantro.  My husband and I add chili powder and crushed red pepper for some heat.  Very easy and is enough for two dinners for our family of four (7 and 9 year old boys and two adults).

Like others, I added corn and black beans to the recipe.  Probably because my chicken quantity was on the high side an extra can of tomato sauce seemed appropriate.  My family said this was my best enchilada effort to date.

This is so easy! I cooked it on Low for about 6 hours. I omitted the cilantro because family members do not like it, yet it is a favorite of mine. This is great for tacos, enchiladas, etc.

I used fire roasted tomatoes with the taco seasoning and added corn and black beans. Have made this several times now and we love it. Lots of leftovers. I serve it with refried beans.

Made this for my family on a snow day. I was looking for an easy crockpot recipe and Mexican style stuff usually goes over well in my house with my wife and I and our 14 year old. (the 5 year old eats cracker and bread only(SMH)...Whatever. My family was quite pleased with this. I have a usual blackened chicken taco recipe I normally use, that I cook on my Weber grill in a 12" Lodge cast iron pan. I use the grill so I don't smoke out the house cooking the chicken as our exhaust fan can't handle the smoke. These tacos came out great and so easy. I prefer my blackened chicken method but this is perfect for bad weather days for me or if I just don't have the time. This was too easy and apparently I will be doing this again real soon since it was such a hit with the family. Any crockpot meal is perfect for those who have too much to do and this took very little effort and tasted good.  I used Paul Newman's Medium Salsa and two limes despite what the recipe called for. I'd make this again!

It came out slightly bland but that could be my caution in adding the spices. Used the chicken to make enchiladas which turned out scrumptious. 
Am motivated to make again following the recipe exactly.

It was fine, but the name is deceiving. With all of the salsa and taco seasoning, you don’t taste the cilantro and lime.

It needs something else. I might want to try a few different types of salsa, or even add a sweet pepper or two.

This is SO SO SO good! I didn't have time to run to the store so I used lime juice from a bottle and cilantro from a tube (found in the refrigerated produce section). I added corn and black beans toward the end and served it over rice. We will definitely make this again. I was so tired of chicken so this is really going to help in that department too!

This turned out delicious! Made so much food my boyfriend and I will have lunches for a couple days! We added black beans while cooking, and fried up some corn and mixed it in when it was close to done. We served on a bed of rice with a little cheese and sour cream. I also added a bit of leftover guacamole from last night to mine! Very easy and very delicious !

Great! I used 4 bone-in chicken breasts, McCormick chicken taco seasoning, and 1 jar of tostitos mild salsa. The fresh cilantro made the dish. Much better than any other taco chicken I have made before.

This recipe made it quick work to put dinner together.  The recipe couldn't be any quicker to put together, and then when it got to be dinner time, it was just  a little chopping of onions, lettuce, etc.  We used it both in taco shells and flour tortillas.  Next time, I will saute onion and green peppers to serve with it on the flour tortillas.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion, and added the lime juice and cilantro the last hour, after shredding the chicken.  It had a nice limey flavor, and the cilantro flavor came through, also.  We served this with garlic re-fried beans on the side.  I might try adding black beans to the slow cooker the last hour, next time, but wanted to make the recipe as stated, first.

My son really enjoyed these and he’s super picky. I only used 1.5 pounds of chicken though since I only have 3 people to feed. We used flour tortillas and made soft tacos. Very good recipe. If I ever need to feed a crowd, this will be my go to!

I've only made it once, but felt like it was missing something. Still really good though.  I figured the first time around I would just stick to the recipe, but next time I'll likely be adding hot sauce to the recipe, not just adding it after it's been cooked.

We added brown rice and black beans to make them burritos.

I was definitely wowed by how easy and delish this is! I had some black beans left over, so I added them at the very end. This is going to be a staple for my house guests, as I can get it started, take them touring and then return home to a great meal. We are expats, living in Spain, with lots of friends and family coming to visit. These ingredients are readily available for us!

This was my first crockpot experience and it seemed simple enough. What a terrific recipe! So much flavor!  I used Aldi Pumpkin Chipotle Salsa, 1 Sazon packet, 1 small yellow onion, and homemade taco seasoning (chilli powder, adobo, cumin, onion powder, red pepper flakes, salt).  I added the cilantro and lime during the last 30 min of cooking. It was done in 2.5 hrs on high, maybe bc it was the cooker's first use. An awesome recipe I could easily make weekly to support my low carb lifestyle.  It's delicious! Thank you!

We made it exactly per the recipe and it was awesome! We didn’t notice much cilantro or lime taste so we will add more next time - probably 1 cup of cilantro and 2+ limes.  We will definitely make this recipes many times over while making adjustments along the way to fine tune it but this is a fantastic base to start with.

Turned out great. Used chicken tenders- cooked on high for one hour and it pulled apart perfectly. Stirred it up and Switched to low for 30 min to let it all soak in. Served on a tortilla with rice, lettuce, shredded cheese and a bit of guacamole. Will definitely make this again

I used the original recipe the first time. I thought was very good, but I also like to change recipes to better suit my families  tastes. This recipe makes it very easy to make changes . I added a little bit of lemon juice as well as the lime juice. I used a Fresh homemade salsa and one can of mild salsa. I put a good quality chili powder in. I put in about 4 tablespoons of Cilantro and then mixed the ingredients and then added 4 pounds of chicken . I do not add any salt. As I think it gets enough from the salsa. Always turns out great and my whole family loves it. We serve it on large flour tortillas with cut up onions, sour cream, green/red peppers and Mexican 4 cheese mix.

Cooked the chicken with the skin on for more flavor and tossed it before serving. Also added the line and cilantro in the last half hour. Super flavorful! Made tacos the first night and tostadas the next. Would definitely make again!

This was really, really good and easy to make!  Used the filling for burritos but also could use with tacos or just on it's own.  My husband added sour cream and cheese to his burrito and would also taste good with avocado or guacamole.  Added bonus....low in calories without the extras!

So very good! I used this as filling for quesadillas-- cooked it exactly as the recipe described but added some black beans and corn at the very end just to blend together for the quesadillas. So yummy and easy!

I used turkey, added my own spices instead of a packet, thick smooth salsa  and cooked in the slow cooker with onion and red bell pepper added. I used green chili enchilada sauce, cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream.

I followed the recipe and did not variate.  It was delicious.  Chicken had a nice rich flavor.   We just served it with tortillas and yellow rice.  Tons of left overs.  If you are on a low sodium diet you may want to take other reviewers advice about the taco seasoning.

My family love, love, loved this recipe. They're already begging me to make it again. My daughter is not a huge fan of Mexican food, and she ate it for lunch and dinner both one day. And it was super easy to make!!

Good, used greenwise medium salsa and not too hot for the kids.  The first night we ate as tacos, then reserved a cup for a soup recipe and still had tons left over (could use in enchiladas, quesadillas, etc).  If not planning for multiple meals, we probably should cut this recipe in half.

I used my personal favorite, higher end salsa and only added a bit of the cilantro to start. About 30 minutes before serving I threw in an unmeasured amount (at least triple the allotted amount in the recipe since we LOVE cilantro). This dish turned out really well. We had it on fresh tortillas that night with cilantro lime rice and the next night the leftovers made delicious quesadillas with corn and black beans!

This was really yummy & super easy. The only thing I did differently was make my own taco seasoning and I rubbed it on the chicken & let it sit overnight before putting into slow cooker. Put over brown rice & black beans, added shredded cheese..delicious! I will. Make again

So Good! I used green salsa instead of red, added extra taco seasoning and  used closer to 4 lbs chicken. The flavor was great, and the amount of liquid in the chicken once it was shredded was perfect! We served it on grilled corn tortillas with extra cilantro and lime...big hit!!

Great recipe, everyone love the way it tasted. The only thing was once the recipe was completed it seemed like there was alot of water/juices in the slow cooker, will try to drain the salsa next time.

I made this exactly as listed but used low sodium taco seasoning. I used restaurant style Tostitos salsa. The flavor was terrific! This is a great recipe for busy days...just throw everything in the crockpot and in 3-4 hours it's ready. I used the chicken for burritos and will have the remainder in a different way, maybe over cilantro lime rice. Yum!

Excellent and easy-peasy! Also no-fail. I threw this together in the crockpot before I went to church. When I came home three hours later I discovered I have set the crockpot on warm instead of high. I was able to throw it in a pan with a little olive oil, browned the chicken, poured the sauce back over it and warmed it until the chicken fell apart. I had made it for company with kids. My children said the other kids told them they had the best cook in the world for her mom. Will definitely make this again!

My family loves this recipe and eat it often. We usually put it in tacos but sometimes in salads and quesadillas. I usually use straight from the freezer chicken breasts and cook on high for about 5 to 6 hours. Comes out perfect every time.

Perfect diner for fire/EMS shift!
My partner and I threw everything into the crockpot set at low at the beginning of our shift, and did not return to the station until 12 hours later. 
The chicken fell apart being touched with a fork. The flavor was outstanding!! Kudos on this recipe!!

This is so simple and delicious!  My only change...i made my taco seasoning from scratch using the recipe on here by Bill Echols(because I didnt have a seasoning packet at home)
 
I also added extra lime and cilantro because we love it!  This was very good and folks really liked it!  I also added a little extra lime juice and cilantro the last 1/2 hour of cooking to give it more flavor.  Next time I might try adding a can of rinsed black beans as others have suggested to make it even more hearty.  This can be used in many ways, but I love that its all done in a crock pot!  Thank you for the recipe!  :)

DELICIOUS!! Because it makes so much I use half of all the ingredients except the cilantro--I keep that the same. And I add minced garlic. Hubby complained it's a little too salty so I used reduced sodium taco seasoning and it's perfect. We've had this as tacos with corn or flour tortillas, I've also made enchiladas with it, and I've used it to make a casserole with corn tortilla chips (that were slightly stale & still came out perfectly). My family loves this recipe!!

This turned out great and made a lot of meat.  I did add the corn from 2 ears of corn and a can of black beans.  I also used the taco seasoning as a rub on the chicken.  I would make this again.  Thank you for the submission.

I thought this was ok. I was expecting Ah-mazing flavor, but thought it was just so-so. Probably wouldn't make it again. I think doing a flash cooking of  bite sized chicken with a few spices actually tastes way better. I was hoping for an easy pre-prep recipe. Unfortunately, this is not it for me.

Great recipe.  I am single and only used 2lbs of meat.  It lasted me all week.  I made tacos, omelets, and mexican taco rice with it.  I doubled all ingredients except for the chicken.  Also make sure you have the toppings to go with it, such as, sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, lettuce, tomatoes, queso, and whatever else you like to eat on your tacos.  The first night I ate it without the fixings, and it was good but felt like something was missing.  The next night I added toppings and it was perfect.   Also I am single and only used 2lbs of chicken.

This was a little watery but tasted fantastic! I thought I had chicken in the freezer and didn't so I ended up using pork tenderloin instead.  I did tweak it slightly after reading some reviews by doubling the taco seasoning and lime and pretty much tripling the cilantro....LOVE cilantro.  Shredded the pork after it was done then added frozen corn and black beans.  Served it on tortillas with a little sour cream and Tex mex cheese....family lived it

1st time followed the recipe exactly my teenage daughter said best dish I ever made. Single dad w/mad BBQ & grilling skills indoor cooking  limited to Texas chili beer to jazz up traditional pot roast and lots of takie outie meals. 2nd time tripled whammied  the lime juice quadrupled the minced cilantro used organic hot salsa taco seasoning & went w/4 instead of 3 lbs free range chicken. Served w/fresh avocado chopped onions tomatoes a  more lime grated cheese & warmed up flour tortillas. Numero 1 primo Dad's most popular inside cooked recipe. Single women free to join us for dinner and/or a date w/Daddio!

Seriously amazing and it freezes incredibly well. This makes 3 meals for my family and I make sure I ALWAYS have some on hand because we love it. I make this with thighs instead of breasts, which have a richer flavor and stay moister. Our family's favorite taco is this recipe topped with Black Bean and Corn Salad II from this site. One of the recipes I've used this chicken in is the INCREDIBLE Slow-Cooker Chicken Tortilla Soup from this site. I've also used it to make enchiladas, casseroles, tortas, empanadas, burritos...

I use the taco seasoning mix recipe on this site instead of a store-bought one.  I also used a jar of chipotle salsa and it was delicious.

This recipe also works great for making a stack-up of crushed tortilla chips, cilantro lime rice, chicken mixture, black beans, shredded cheese, lettuce, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, etc...whatever you can think of to put on there! Add a side of red-hot apple sauce jello and there's your full meal deal! Delicious!

This was okay. It was a little too mushy to enjoy in tacos, but would be perfect for enchiladas. I probably won't make it again.

As is I would give this recipe 4 stars.  I took a few suggestions from some other reviewers and added corn, black beans, a chopped onion, a full cup of cilantro and the juice from 2 limes instead of one. I also halved the amount of taco seasoning as I don't like foods with too much salt.  Served it with soft taco shells, avocado, tomatoes, lettuce, jalapeños, cheese and sour cream.  It ended up being a 5 star recipe!

This was as easy as it gets! I added black beans and corn near the end and used this for chicken tacos. It was great, even my picky young boys devoured it! I prefer a little more heat, but I don't know if my boys would have enjoyed it as much. I didn't notice the cilantro, and I will try adding a LOT more and wait until closer to the end next time. Plenty of leftovers.

Turned out very good! The chicken breast I used were really big, I could of gotten away with two. I shredded the chicken and used it to make the tastiest enchiladas I've ever had.  Even had lots leftover meat for tacos tomorrow.  Definitely will be making this again soon!

Made just as recipe called for plus added two gloves of garlic that another reviewer recommended.  Served over rice and it was very good, but think it would have been better in taco shells or flour tortilla with cheese.  With those additions and maybe some avocado it would have been 5 stars.

This is a fantastic recipe.  The only change I made, was to use Chipotle Taco mix, rather than regular.  Everything else was exactly as written in the original recipe.  We made quesadillas with it, and they were amazing.  My kids loved it, and have requested this again!

I love this recipe!! This is my first review....I've made this at least a dozen times!! I use my pressure cooker and frozen chicken breasts.  I use homemade taco seasoning (from this website) and good quality salsa and its done in less than 90 minutes.  I use the shredded chicken in tacos, burritos, enchiladas or a mexi rice bowl with black bean and corn salsa.  Soooo delicious!

This is such a wonderfully easy and excellent recipe to make! It was a hit for everyone in my home. The only changes I made was that I used pico de gallo instead of jarred salsa, doubled the cilantro and lime, and I kept half a lime in with the food for about 4 hours to give it an extra kick. I'll be making this again for sure!

This is a great, easy recipe--but for us, it lacked flavor even though we doubled the fresh lime juice and used 2 handfuls of cilantro. We added green taco sauce at the table and it was more vibrant. I'd use green salsa (rather than red) in the slow cooker next time to see if that helps.  I'll be experimenting with this!

Turned out great.  I used rotel instead of salsa and added a bit more cilantro but that's just a personal taste preference.

I followed the directions as written except I added a can of Rotel tomatoes. I agree with other reviewers that it seemed a bit salty, but not to the point of ruining it. I might follow the recommendations made by someone to use instead of taco seasoning, "cumin, ancho chile powder, sea salt, black/white pepper, oregano, etc". Otherwise VERY easy and VERY tasty.

We absolutely LOVED this recipe!  I added a bit of cayenne pepper to the ingredients which, obviously, gave it a little "kick".  This recipe was a fantastic find and one that I'll definitely make again (and again, and again...)  :)

The chicken turned out super tender and shredded nicely but it was very bland.  I added all the spices called for but it needs something more.   It would probably be very good topped with sour cream to add some flavor!

Made it last night & my hubby LOVED it.  The only change I made was to add onion.  You can adjust the flavor by using either hot or mild salsa, we are in the medium mindset.

This was so good!  The only things I changed is I only used 1/2 package of taco seasoning and added the lime an hour before cooking was completed.  Will make again!

After reading the reviews I was pretty excited to try the recipe and the only addition I made was a drained can of black beans. I did use my own homemade salsa which has good flavor from garden tomatoes. All I can say was that it was just really "ok".  Nothing special. We used steamed flour tortillas and topped with shredded lettuce, sour cream and avocado chunks which added nice flavor. Will continue looking for another slow cooker shredded chicken recipe.

I liked this dish, very simple to make, but the kids, not so much. For me not enough lime and could have used more cilantro. My kids thought there was too much lime, but weren't wowed regardless. Not sure if it's worthwhile making again.

SO easy to make, and a big hit with kids and adults.  We used it in tacos, but I'll try in enchiladas next time as suggested by another reviewer.  I also omitted taco seasoning and instead added cumin, mexican chili powder, garlic powder and onion powder.  Worked great, and was not too salty

I used my own fresh salsa and cumin; omitting the jar of salsa and taco seasoning packet.  Fresh herbs and spices are a must but besides that, this was perfect last night and I will be using the left overs for soup today.

I'm not much of a cook, but this was simple & tasty. My very picky 8 year old loved it in chicken enchiladas & actually asked if he could have more of the meat (he usually hates meat in all forms). I knocked off one star because if I hadn't followed someone's advice to add a second lime & more cilantro at the end, it wouldn't have been as flavorful.

Great flavor. I used Newman's medium salsa. Added more lime and cilantro than the recipe called for. Based off other reviews I decided to only use half a package of taco seasoning and added some garlic.

First, so easy. I did add a 24oz.of picante, because my family loves things a little soupier, plus I was serving this over plain white rice. There are so many things you could  do with the recipe. Great as written. Make changes to suit your family.
Thank You for Sharing.
PS. This would be great for a party with all the condiments.

Not fair for me to star rate this recipe, but would't let me submit without one, since I made changes to the recipe. I didn't have any chicken, but the recipe sounded so good that I used a pork tenderloin that I cut into chunks to substitute for the chicken and put all in the crock pot. I had homemade green tomato salsa that i used for the salsa and added fresh garlic. Turned out great to serve over rice and add to tortillas to make burritos. Lots of leftovers, good with rice, pineapple.

Made this as directed and it turned out great.  Put the shredded chicken in a flour tortilla, with a little shredded cheese and sour cream--yum!  My son wants me to make it again soon. I always love finding something new to add to the meal rotation!

To be fair, I think I overcooked it. However,  I didn't think it had much flavor. The only thing  I added was sliced onions, otherwise followed the recipe as written. Very bland.

This is an excellent recipe. I followed another reviewer's advice and added a can of black beans and some frozen corn.  I served it with hard and soft taco shells. I used the leftovers on a salad the next day with a little ranch dressing...delicious. Thanks for an easy, nutritious and yummy recipe.

I made it as a Super Bowl dish so everyone could serve themselves. It went great! Everyone liked it. For the salsa I used a medium hot to give it more kick. I also placed a mixture of meat tenderizer and spices on the chicken breast so they wouldn't be bland. It was easy to prepare & I let it cook on low for 8 hrs while I left. (Leaving hubby to the occasional 2 hr mix) Sorry for the burnt edges crock pot pic but everyone ate so fast I couldn't get a finished product pic!

Wow, this was awesome... even my pickiest eater liked it. And this morning I used the left over filling for omelets (tasted like what most restaurants refer to as a Spanish omelet). I will certainly be making this recipe again. Only thing I did different was cut the taco seasoning and added some chopped tomatoes because I was concerned it might be too spicy(hot) for my tummy even though I had used a mild salsa... it was perfect on flavor without all the heat.

We loved it! I used 1/2 chicken breast and 1/2 thighs, as it is what I had on hand.  It's great to serve with rice tortillas (gluten / corn free house) We use homemade salsa and taco seasoning, both are much lower in salt than store bought.  I will definitely keep this recipe to make again, and serve it over rice with a slice or two of avocado and fresh cilantro on top!

I agree with many of the comments, the taco seasoning could be omitted, or at least cut in half,  it really is too salty. I threw some hot Rotel in too, it needed some heat. Next time I will double the cilantro and the lime, the tastes didn't come through over the salsa and seasoning. But it is easy to do and I think with those tweaks it could become a regular.

Super easy and packed with flavor (unless you're boring with your salsa).  I split this up into smaller portions and refrigerated it to use for breakfast burritos and it is AMAZING!  From tacos, burritos, or a santa fe chicken salad, this can be used anytime you're making a dish with some flair.

An excellent recipe that as far as I know, has its origins in northern New Mexican cooking. The only difference there is that they use equal parts of olive oil and tequila as well as much freshly minced garlic in with the cilantro and lime. Works great as a marinate for chicken also before grilling, but is equally as good when cooked in a slow cooker as per this recipe's method.

added extra cilantro and used tequila lime tomatillo and red salsas.  Also made quinoa (2 boxes) which is good mixed in. Served in tortilla boats.

Very good recipe as is although as others have said it is a little salty. I used boneless-skinless thighs instead of the breasts, this cut the cooking time by over an hour and made it moist and flavorful. I may try to use a "clean" version of taco seasoning instead of the packet next time to cut some of the sodium.

Great and easy recipe to make.  I have a family of four and they love chicken tacos. If you have kids be careful not to use salsa that is too spicy because the chicken really picks up the spices after 8 hours of cooking.  Everyone in my family really like this recipe.  I would definitely make it again.  I came home late from work a couple of days later hoping to eat leftovers and there were none to be had.

Dry brined the chicken, then seared it before adding to the crockpot. Low for 9 hours, easily forkable and not dry.

Goya salsa pico de gallo was a great choice for the salsa. Thick and chunky enough to withstand the long cooking and retain some texture.

Taco seasoning was just thrown in spices, mostly typical, but did add 2 bayleaves and a touch of brown sugar.

Frozen corn and can of black beans (strained) just plopped in also. Terrific additions.

I added a bit of water (maybe 1/2 cup) to make sure everything was covered, but it was a bit soupy in the end, so I'd probably omit it next time, as the water level rose during cooking.

Overall I made a few additions, but flavor was good enough to not need anything. That plus the ease, health, and relative inexpense gives this a 5.

These five stars are with an * included. I loved this chicken and so did my husband, * but I prefer it a little less salty, as others have mentioned. Paired with mango, it tamed the spices/saltiness down. Another amazing option... shredded chicken nachos. Yum!

Wow! What a great, easy recipe! I'm not a very experienced cook though so I like to know specifics - what kind of taco seasoning, salsa, etc. So I thought I'd share what I used becuase they came out so good! McCormick's chicken taco seasoning mix - the regurlar kind, not chipotle or anything - and Herdez medium salsa. After I shredded the chicken, I scoped the vegetables from the salsa out with a slotted spoon and mixed them in for color and flavor. We rolled the chicken in flour tortillas with cheese and it was great! Would also be great in tacos, chicken quesadillas, served over rice, or just about any other way you can think of to use it. Good stuff!

Well, I hate reviewing a recipe when I don't make it exactly as written but I just had to share what I did as it turned out great!  Not by choice, but only because I didn't have the exact ingredients on hand.  First, there are only two of us so I only used two boneless skinless chicken breast halves.  Placed them in an ungreased crockpot.  Put a little salt and pepper on top.  In a separate bowl, I combined 1/2 jar of strained  Frontera Tomatillo Salsa (Medium), juice of 1/2 lime, 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro then about 1 tablespoon of Chef Merito Red Fajitas Seasoning.  Note that straining the salsa is important as recommended by another reviewer.  The end result wasn't too soupy but the meat was still very very moist.  After combining these ingredients just pour over and spread it around the top of the chicken breasts.  Cover and cook on  low for about 4 hours.  Shred and serve with your favorite condiments.  We had it with flour tortillas, sour cream, fresh cilantro, lettuce, tomatoes and jack cheese.  Yummmmmmy!  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!  I will try it the original way next time!! :)

This tasted great! My family really liked it. I made my own taco seasoning from Allrecipes and cooked on the stove top so that it would done sooner.

I made half the recipe in a crock pot without changing any of the ingredients and made the chicken into burritos. We were raving over the flavor and moistness of the chicken!

I added a bag of frozen kernel corn and a can of unsalted black beans in the last couple hours of cooking.  
Spread across warmed corn tortillas and top with shredded cheese, sour cream, chopped fresh cilantro and a squeeze of a fresh lime.  
Was delish!

This was pretty easy and tasty.  I like that it's easy to change to your tastes, just by using a different salsa.  The chicken was very tender and easy to shred with a fork.  The only think I didn't like was that because it uses the entire package of taco seasoning, it would be a bit of a pain to make smaller portions.  I have the extra saved and play to try to make enchiladas with it.

I made this with a home-made taco seasoning instead of packaged. (It was what I had on hand.) Overall great taste, do take other reviewer's advice, use a good quality salsa. Will probably make again. :)

Very good.  I would add a few more spices and possibly double the taco seasoning.  It's good as is but could use just a little more flavor.  It also makes enough for a platoon of Marines so be sure to use the scale down feature if you are less than 6 people.

I cut back on the salsa to 1 1/4 cup of resteraunt style and increased the cilantro to 1 cup- chopped.  I use 3 frozen large chicken breast and cook on high 6 plus hours..then remove, shred and return to crock pot and cook on low until ready to serve (30-60mins).  Much better and not nearly as runny as using the full amount of salsa but the chicken is still nice and juicy

Followed the recipe. Served with warm flour tortillas, sour cream, lime wedges, grated sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack, shredded lettuce. Also made fresh salsa served with chips and margaritas. Rave reviews. Really delicious. Flexible recipe allows for all kinds of adjustments. This is a go-to never fail success story.

I have made this dozens of times.  I use a packet of low sodium taco seasoning.  It comes out great every time.  Fajitas, enchiladas, tacos, nachos - it's perfect for all things Mexican!  It freezes well, too.

I make this at least once a month, more if we're having a work potluck. Everyone loves it! I use Herdez Salsa Verde; I really think the green salsa sends it over the edge. I also use two limes and at least double the cilantro (only fresh!). This chicken really is the best and makes a ton!

So I doubled the recipe, and added in a can of black and half a bag of frozen corn. 6 hours later, I shredded the chicken and threw it back in for another 20 minutes on low. All my roommates tried it, and were dying for seconds. I'll be making this again and again, so flavorful and delicious!

We loved this easy recipe. It's so versatile too.  I use the meat for tacos, enchiladas or in omelets.  I still have some left.  Muchos gracias for submitting this recipe!  Gloria

Great flavor! Very adaptable to individual tastes and can use for a variety of dishes.  Only change I made was to add a teaspoon of cumin and turned out wonderful!

Followed the recipe as written, no modifications.  The resulting shredded chicken was used in tacos, burritos and enchiladas.  The enchiladas were the best chicken enchiladas I have made.  This recipe will be a "go to" recipe from here on out.  Great grub!

I find if you let it cook on low for 8 hours, it gets a weird texture. However, the 4 hours on high seemed to work fine. Love this, just shred the chicken, put in a corn tortilla with a little cheese, sauce, and sliced avocado on top.

Ohhhhh this is sooooo good!!  And it's sooooo easy to make!! Not to mention, it's not an expensive recipe, so that's a pleasant surprise considering it packs a ton of flavor!!! I've made this a few times and used only the ingredients listed in the recipe (although I'm not sure how to measure cilantro, so I just throw a blob of it in there).  I've served it with those Old ElPaso mini soft bowls and put lettuce, sour cream, and some of the frozen Birds Eye Mexican Lime Corn together with some rice on the side and it's amazing!!  Slow cooked for 7.5 hours today in low and I used a little over 3 pounds of chicken breasts but a jar and a half of the salsa.

We make this a lot. I usually end up just tossing the squeezed out lime in the crock too, though we don't eat that part. Very easy, very good.

I LOVE this recipe. I've made it as written, which is excellent in itself, but have also made it and added a can of black beans and a can of corn. Just gives it more depth. I usually serve on whole wheat tortillas with light sour cream and shredded cheese. Lasts in the fridge for days and just gets better. Make this!!

I made this according to the published recipe. The recipe appealed to me because it seemed like a "slam dunk". The result was  disappointing ... And that's being charutable. Sorry. But this one was a miss.

I halved the recipe since it's just me. Tasted kind of bland. I will try it again with more seasoning and a different salsa.

This was a good basic recipe that can be used in a variety of ways. I took the advice of other reviewers and added a chopped onion, 2 limes , juiced, and doubled the cilantro. I was already serving lime cilantro rice with black beans, so I didn't add black beans or corn, as some suggested.

I made this today! I changed it a little with 1 can of Cilantro and lime Rotel. This made it a little spicy.  Then I zest the lime before cutting it in half and placed the zest on the chicken, by using one half of lime for juice and cut up the other half and placed the cut up lime on top.  It was so yummy.  It was more than plenty. We could have fed 3 more people but we love left overs.

This is super delicious! Thank you for sharing it! I used homemade taco seasoning (half the amount) to add flavor and reduce salt. My husband loves it in a flour tortilla with some chopped lettuce,sour cream and shredded cheese.

One of the most spectacularly delicious meals I've ever made in a crock pot. The ingredients are so simple that you are caught off guard. I used a liquid taco seasoning pouch for chicken but this was the only variation.  The chicken was tender and succulent. The only changes I plan in the future is to use more taco sauce because we like it with a little extra drizzle and maybe  add thinly sliced onion and pepper s but that's it ...super yummy

This was very easy and convenient  to be ready when having to leave the house for three hours.  I cooked it on high for two hours, then turned it to low for the three hours I was gone.  It was perfect!  I used a homemade taco seasoning and served on corn tortillas fried in olive oil.  Avocado mango salsa and spinach makes it a healthy meal.  Everyone loved it!

This is one of my go-to recipes for my family and also for entertaining. It's fun to change up the flavor depending on the type of salsa you add. Peach or mango salsa gives a great sweetness with the spices of the taco seasoning.

Loved it! Unfortunately, I cannot taste either the lime or the cilantro. I would recommend adding them 15-30 min before you turn off your crockpot. Also, tastes great with home-made Pico.

After reading the reviews I added 1 chopped onion, 1 diced jalapeno, 1 jar salsa and 1 pkg. Fernandez taco sauce mix, 3 chicken breasts and a tablespoon of vegetable oil with the juice of 2 limes and extra cilantro.    Cooked on low 5 hours.   Removed the breasts to shred and thickened the juice in the crock on high with 1 Tbls. Corn starch for 20 minutes.   Added the shredded chicken back to the pot until reheated.   Excellent!

This has become one of my wife's most requested meals (that I cook). She doesn't like hot spice at all.  I've used an organic mild taco seasoning and mild salsa.  I've also added diced tomatoes to the recipe a couple of times as well, to turn down the heat when using warmer salsas or to extend cooking time if I want to cook it longer.  

Next step is to do away with any store bought taco seasoning and make my own using some of the recipes listed here.  

I've also used different salsas.  No Pace Picante (grin).  I've mainly used local made, artisan type salsas, which help to give it a little more variety.  I use a lime, cabbage, and carrot taco slaw (from by: mixingmedias here on Allrecipes) that is a great topper.  Then normally add cheese, sour cream or Greek yogurt, sliced black olives, chopped onion, and fresh cilantro.  

Very easy recipe. I increased ingredients and made it as a self serve taco bar one night for four couples.

I make this exactly as the recipe states.  I use Newman's Own medium salsa and McCormick original taco seasoning since the recipe doesn't specify.  The chicken shreds easily and tastes great!

Excelent! I didnt have taco seasoning on my pantry and I made one; the recipe is called taco seasoning I. I made enough for this recipe and saved some for later. I use this recipe when I dont have time to cook its very tasty I dont even shred the chicken I serve the breasts with sour cream and guacamole.

My husband loves these!! The first time I made them I was out of Taco Seasoning- so I use Fajita Seasoning instead- and it was great!

I'm not thrilled with this recipe.  It is rather bland.  After four hours in the slow cooker it was very tender and easy to shred, but just nothing special to taste.  I shredded it and then left it in the cooker for another 30 minutes after adding A LOT of additional spices: cumin, chili powder, onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Then I also added juice from another lime and finally about another tablespoon of cilantro.  It was just ok even after that.  I served it in a bowl with all the standard taco toppings; avocado, cheese, lettuce, tomato, salsa verde. For leftovers tonight I'll serve it over rice with same taco toppings and see if it got better over night in the fridge.  This makes a lot.

Used reduced sodium taco seasoning, due to comments about it being salty, and about 4.5lbs of chicken breast.  So easy, delicious, and seasoning was perfect!  My new go-to chicken recipe for tacos!

Very good and easy recipe!  I used a jar and a half of salsa, and used only half the taco seasoning mix.  I used the finished chicken to make enchiladas - they turned out amazing!

I made this with frozen chicken breasts on low for 8+ hours. We used black bean and corn salsa and low sodium taco seasoning. It was great. My 11 year old son even said that it tastes like real Mexican food...meaning authentic. We will make this again and again!

I have made this many times now, and we love it! The trick is to use good quality salsa. I have tried a few, but my favorite to use is Herdez Hot Salsa, it has good flavor and a little heat. I also use El Paso Taco seasoning, about half the amount stated or I make my own. I have used this chicken for nachos, tacos, and, my favorite, the Cheesy Poblano Enchiladas on this site. This is definitely a keeper!

Fantastic recipe.  Followed the recipe with these changes; which Sarah Jo had posted, adding  1 1/2 cups of fresh chopped Cilantro and using a good brand store bought salsa.  I also used a packet of Fajita seasoning instead of Taco. Mine cooked in 3 hours.  Served it with homemade Spanish rice, salsa, guac. Tortillas & Tortilla chips.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us all.

Really good recipe. Makes a ton of chicken! I'd recommend around halfway through pulling the chicken a little apart to get a little more flavor into each bite. But it's a great party food idea!

This recipe was a last minute thing and it turned out so awesome.  I cooked it on low for 5 hours and i had a few minor changes.  FIrst , i used a little less than a full taco seasoning packet ( Old El Paso's Hot and Spicy)  to keep the heat under control. I didnt have any cilantro on hand but can only imagine how it would blow the dish over the top!  I also added a few TB's of chopped garlic.  Finally i didnt have a full jar of salsa but it still worked out great.  The dish was done after cooking on low for 5 hours and had a lot of liquid in the pot but after shredding the chicken it was just a little wet.  My family loved it and this is definitely a keeper in my  Tuesday night Taco/Mexican rotation.

Love this!  I made it as is.  I used a green salsa from Trader Joe's and also a taco seasoning packet from Trader Joe's.  So incredibly easy and dinner for a few nights!  Burritos, enchiladas...

I followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious.  Made so much I am freezing for another meal.  Served it on low fat soft tortillas with diced avocado, shredded red cabbage, cilantro and lime wedges to spritz on the tacos.  This is a keeper!

This was so easy and good! I omitted taco seasoning like others suggested, and combined it overnight in a ziploc bag.  Served with sides of Mexican rice , chopped lettuce , and black retried beans!

Very delicious. I doubled the chicken as I made this for a work luncheon. I agree with previous reviews about using less taco seasoning. I chopped a habanero pepper and mixed it in...definitely added a kick!

I need to try making this again as written. I didn't have taco seasoning, so skipped that step, and it came out very bland. Moist and alright, but bland. Heated up left-overs with garlic, cumin, and coriander, (plus salt and pepper) and that improved it. It's so ridiculously easy, I want to love it, so will try again.

I give it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe to a T. I didn't add the taco seasoning per other reviewers...just a good salsa(medium), half onion, and 2 garlic cloves. I also waited to add the cilantro and fresh lime juice (2 limes) in the last hour of cooking. I made this for a gathering and to make your own chicken tacos. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe!

Easy to make and pretty tasty. Used mango salsa and 2/3 of a package of low sodium taco seasoning. Taco kits were on sale, so it was cheaper than buying the seasoning and tortillas separately.

This was super easy, even for me! The only change I made was adding a can of black beans (rinsed and drained).  Delicious, and DH loved it!

I made this using chicken thighs. No extra ingredients were added and the seasoning was fabulous. I baked it in a conventional oven rather than a slow cooker and it still turned out really great. Served over rice. My hubby loved it. I'll definitely make this again!!!

Wonderful!  Hubby and I thought it was wonderful!  Will be making this again!  I only had half a lime because I was using the other half for peppers and onions for fajitas.  It still turned out great!

OMG!  The flavor was good.  i was only sad that I hadn't planned better.  Black beans with onion would have gone so well with this!  we tossed it on some wheat tortillas and used the nuice from the crock pot for added juiciness.   Another recipe in rotation

This has easily has become a staple in my home. The only change is I use low sodium taco seasoning. This dish is great because it can be customized to fit your mood if you want more spicy. The best part is how easy it is make, the last time it was made in my home my 10 yr old made it and it was great.

This was very good and chicken came out tender and moist.  I skipped the taco seasoning, used salsa verde, the juice of one lime and added cilantro at the end.  I recommend cooking it on low as I think it makes the chicken soak in the flavors more.  Yummy!

I loved the flavor! The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is I had to add 2 cups of chicken broth so my chicken would be completely submerged. It could be my crock pot size, not sure. Very good, this will be a repeat for sure.

I used chicken tenderloin instead of breast since it happened to be discounted at the market. The chicken came out very tender and pulled right apart. The salsa/taco seasoning was fine, but the lime and cilantro flavor didn't carry through. I would suggest using 2X the lime juice, and 2X to 3X the cilantro

Hands down, this is the most frequent recipe we make from allrecipes.  I think the recipe is perfect as is.  The only changes are based on your personal preference.  For instance, I prefer lots of lime and cilantro so I add more.  
I also use low sodium taco seasoning which hasn't been an issue for changing the flavor!

As-is, I'd give this recipe 4/5 stars, but after a little tinkering this recipe deserves 6/5 stars. I highly recommend using salsa verde and going heavy on the cilantro. I also added 3 cloves of garlic. Absolutely delicious!

I made it according to the recipe and it was delicious! We ate it with soft flour tortillas, corn, black beans, avocado chunks, pico de gallo, sour cream and cheese, and everyone wanted seconds - including our picky kids. I plan to use the rest for Chicken Avocado Soup tomorrow and I can already tell it's going to be amazing!

It came out really good!  I did make quite a bit of changes.  First, I don't eat salsa in a jar.  I grew up with fresh salsa made with fresh roasted chiles   I made my own salsa and added the cilantro to it.  I used ~4 - 6oz of fresh roasted green chiles and jalapenos, 15oz can of tomatoes and minced garlic, onion powder and salt to taste.  Blended in blender to desired consistency then added to slow cooker.
Then I added 5 0z of canned tomatoes in blender, with 3 tablespoons of smashed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and lime juice for one lime with 3.25 tablespoons home mixed Mexican seasoning (I avoid packaged taco seasoning due to all the sodium and preservatives) with 1.5 teaspoon of corn starch (to thicken sauce while cooking) and blended well.   Added mixture to slow cooker.
Cooked in slow cooker for 5 hours and when done shredded the meat and served with home made corn tortillas, lettuce, tomatoe, and chipotle Monterey jack cheese.  I added some of the extra sauce to the top of the tacos and it was EXCELLENT!.  Great new spin on tacos I never thought of.  Thanx for the idea.

This recipe is great. So easy. Definitely use a good fresh salsa rather than one from a jar (Pace, Tostitos, etc). You actually don't really even need cilantro then because fresh salsa usually has plenty. I will definitely make this again.

It was great. I added 1/2 diced onion, 1 large clove of garlic minced and 1/2 pack of taco seasoning.  Then put in 3 frozen chicken breasts. I cooked it in the oven on 300 for the first 1.5 hours and then 285 for about 4 hours. I took it out and shredded the chicken part way through cooking.  Then with about an hour left, I added the juice of one more lime and threw in some more cilantro.  I served it with corn tortillas that I quickly fried into shells with sour cream on the side. Delicious.

Like other respondents, I added black beans and minced garlic. I also added pineapple tidbits and juice. It added a sweet, fruity zest to the recipe that was just delightful! Served with tortilla chips and soft shells, chopped romaine lettuce, chopped multi-colored peppers, chopped onion, cherry tomatoes and grated cheddar cheese.

This was delicious.  Made it with 2 limes instead of one and only 3/4 of the salsa sauce for 3 breasts.  It was super yummies served in taco shell with avocado, cheese, tomatoes and salad!

This came out great! I halved the recipe (except I did use the whole packet of taco seasoning). I cooked it in the slow cooker on high for about 3 hours. I used the cooked chicken to make enchiladas - I added the it to corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar. Topped with green taco sauce and more cheddar and cooked in the over for about 10-15 minutes. Perfect!

I made this recipe just as suggested.  I didn't change a thing and everyone loved it.  I have small kids and a teenager.  They all loved them.  We had enough for leftovers too.  These leftovers were not wasted.  We ate every bit of them.  Just a side note...  The level of spice or heat is determined by the salsa.  So, if you have small ones that might not like it spicy, you may want to use a mild salsa.

I really really liked this dish, I added a can of black beans to it. I used it on top of rice and in a a bulky roll. Next time I think i'll add another lime's juice and a can or corn.

Five stars. Easy and delicious, I used thighs instead of breast, halved the taco mix, added poultry seasoning, lime wedges, black pepper and garlic. I'm interested as to try it with tequila as well. Served it at tailgate and it went over well

Great dish.  Use less taco seasoning than recipe calls for and more cilantro.

My husband's favorite recipe. He asks me to make a new batch every week and eats it at least once a day. Seriously. I would suggest starting out by doubling this recipe and you won't be sorry! I use 2x the amount of salsa to keep it moist in the fridge. Our favorite salsa? Kirkland's Organic Salsa from Costco. We're not typically organic buying folks but this salsa is amazing! Can I give this recipe 6 stars?

Believe the reviewers who say this turns out far too salty with a full taco seasoning packet. All you could taste was salt and spices. The chicken will naturally be fork tender from the slow cooker, but that's all it had going for it. I had to remedy this recipe with the juice of 2 more limes, a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce, and a dose of honey to counterbalance the saltiness. Disappointing.

Overall it was a dish that was satisfying.  A few things i would change ... don't have to use that much tomato sauce since there's all that water from the chicken itself.  Another is that I always add cumin when cooking chicken; about a teaspoon per pound is what we do in my house.

We loved this easy Mexican shredded chicken.  I doubled the lime and the cilantro and used Mexican taco seasoning, which isn't very salty.  Some of us ate it on grilled corn tortillas, some ate it alongside Trader Joe's wild rice blend.  It makes a wonderful leftover because it has plenty of sauce.

I have made this for my family several times. However, I must admit I never used the red salsa and the taco seasoning as directed in the recipe. I used a chicken taco seasoning and a green salsa and  I used 2 limes juiced limes instead of 1. It is great for leftovers on a salad too.

If your looking for a little extra heat, you might consider upping the salsa to hot and or adding a little cayenne pepper, paprika or even some sirachi sauce.    The recipe is very good but my 8 year old and I like to add a little additional 'fire' to many dishes.   Still gets a thumbs up from all.

Used this to feed ten of us and it worked perfectly. Added a bit of chicken broth at the end before shredding to keep everything tender; otherwise I made no changes. It was a great addition to my recipe collection!

Made this the other night and used a homemade tomato sauce. We rolled up the chicken with a spicy couscous into a tortilla and ended up being a tangy, wonderful, tender chicken!

This was excellent! Made my own taco seasoning instead of a packet as I don't like that packaged taste and added lime and cilantro late as others suggested - this will be a regular meal for sure.

Cooked it exactly as the recipe. Came out great. Used Old El Paso Picante salsa and Old El Paso lower sodium seasoning. Served it with fresh lime juice, avocado, lettuce, tomato, fresh cilantro, cheese and sour cream. Amazing

I added an onion and used 3 limes an extra cilantro. I also added half a jar of verde and a container of garden salsa in addition to the thick and chunky salsa I already used. It gives it thebest flavor and it's juicier. I also combined all ingredients in a bowl and let it marinate overnight. It was delicious and we used the leftovers to make chicken enchiladas.

I made this recipe with green salsa from the Mexican store and homemade taco seasoning  (cumin, garlic powder, chile powder, salt n pepper). I also added an onion. I would say it is pretty good but next time I will cook about 5 hours on low instead of six. It is not particularly great by itself but is awesome when added to another recipe such as tacos or enchiladas. Shreds great and is very tender.

I think you really need to focus on the salsa for this recipe. I sent my husband to the store and he got standard salsa from the chip aisle and I felt like the sauce/chicken tasted like something from frozen meal. Not terrible, but I won't be making this again.

Per the suggestion of others, I used a low sodium taco seasoning. The rest was per the recipe. I don't like spicy or eat salsa but this had a great flavor. Family and I loved it and it is definitely going into the dinner rotation.

I made this according to the recipe, except I used boneless chicken thighs and in place of the packaged taco seasoning mix, I followed someone's suggestion and tried Bill Echols Taco Seasoning recipe from this site. The chicken was very moist and flavorful, melted in your mouth, but way too salty! Maybe it was the Goya salsa I used? Will try a different brand next time or make my own.  Also I think I'll halve the salt called for in the Taco Seasoning recipe, then adjust for taste if necessary. Otherwise, a quick and easy recipe that I will add to my rotation.

Made the recipe as instructed, on low heat, but in the last hour, I added a couple strands of cilantro then removed before shredding.  It was really juicy.  Super easy!

I made this almost as written, except I used my own spices; salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, cumin, chili powder, sweet basil, and some cayenne.  I did add sliced onions and minced garlic to the crockpot also.  We really enjoyed the lime flavor most of all.  Served as tacos on white corn tortillas.  Yum Yum!

Made the recipe for a Father's Day function at church.  It made a lot of chicken. I used it to make quesadillas. The taste of the tangy chicken with the melted cheese was yummy!! The quesa's disappeared as soon as I put them out--I made 3 trays.

Other than using two packages of Taco Bell taco seasoning (1 oz each), I followed the recipe as written.  It was done within the 4 hours.  I shredded the chicken after 3.5 hours and let it cook the remaining time.

I will make this again but only when I have a much larger crowd to feed.

I really enjoyed this recipe. My BF thought it was too soggy in a tortilla, but I used around a pound of chicken, rather than three, so that may be why. Maybe next time I'll reduce the other ingredients as well. Overall, very good.

This was really good. I used about 2 tablespoons of the jarred taco seasoning, doubled the cilantro,  and also added 3 cloves of crushed garlic to mine. I also only used 4 chicken breasts.

This is the best and SO easy!  I always use two jars of salsa (usually one corn/bean and one medium) and I follow other reviewers' advice and add the cilantro and lime with about one hour left to go.  I've found you can cook this recipe for 10+ hours on low and it still turns out delicious.  I make this a lot.

This was SO EASY  & DELICIOUS!  (I doubled the recipe & added corn I had leftover along with some salt & Tony's,  and I served it over brown rice & quinoa.)  I'll certainly make this again &  I think I'll add some black beans.  It was a big hit at my house!

Will make again...everyone loved it.  Used Clint's salsa with black beans and corn and it turned out great.  Added a nice touch.  While cooking it smelled very similar to the taco soup recipe on this site...very similar flavor but obviously a lot less liquid.  Served in flour tortillas with shredded cheese, diced red onion and diced red pepper with yellow rice on the side.  Would make a great quesadilla...may make some with the left overs.  Highly recommend!??

I love this recipe!!! I make it as a rice bowl. Add jasmine rice, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheddar, sour cream. OMG! So good I made a double batch for family dinner, it was gone lickety split! Haven't tried black beans with it. That would probably be awesome as well! Thank you for the great recipe!

This is one of my favorite crockpot recipes. Use a salsa you like enough to eat by itself. I used Penzey's taco seasoning, and added a cup of frozen corn towards the end. We serve it on a whole wheat, low carb tortilla with a little sour cream.

I loved this! My husband and I had it tonight--no leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly other than cutting it by a 1/3. Super flavorful and EASY. I'm definitely adding this recipe to my 'make again list.' I served it with crispy taco shells with cheese, sour cream, and shredded lettuce.

Delicious recipe! I cooked it on the stove top.  The chicken turned out tender & juicy.  I had to substitute Ro-Tel for the salsa (I didn't have any on hand) & added corn & black beans.  The recipe makes more than enough for us, so I added a mexican cheese blend to the leftovers to make a (sort of) taco dip & served it with tortilla chips. Hubby's co-workers loved it.

Turned it into a hearty taco filling by using hot salsa & hot taco seasoning and adding chopped onion & red pepper, diced jalapeño, a can of black beans & half a bag of corn. Served with shredded Mexican 4 cheese blend on corn tortillas. SO GOOD! My husband is the cook in our family and couldn't get over how delicious this was (not to mention the fact that I cooked something in the first place)!

It was delicious.  I made a big batch for thanksging dinner (16 servings).  One suggestion I would make it to omit MOST of the cream cheese. For 16 servings, the recipe called for 5.25 blocks of cream cheese and I only used half of one block and it was definitely thick enough. Would definitely make again.

Wow - Followed recipe exactly.. cooked for about 5 hours (on the 6 hour setting).  Roll it up in a tortilla with some shredded cheese and sour cream.. you WON'T be disappointed!  If anything, I would add more cilantro and lime.. You don't really get too much of those bold flavors.

I never write reviews b/c I'm not a great cook and wonder if my reviews would be relevant to those who are.  This was so good and easy, I felt I had to join the 636 others who had reviewed it already!!  It was so tasty - my husband loved it!  I made it Monday and had my last helping of leftovers for lunch today (Friday).  It still tasted as good today as it did on Monday.  This is a great recipe to make on Sunday and have leftovers for lunches (or dinner) on and off throughout the week.  Plus, as another reviewer noted, you can do many things with it - serve it with rice, pasta, in a taco shell...etc.  ENJOY!!

A favorite, easy recipe. I sometimes add a can of black beans. No taco seasoning needed if I use a flavorful salsa (fresh home made or Emerald Valley brand).

Great recipe!  Like others, I did a few slight modifications including using 1/2 diced onion on the bottom of the crock pot.  Used La Victoria Mild chunky salsa & 1/2 container Trader Joes pico d' gaillo (sp),  juice of 2 limes, & 1/4 cup cilantro.  I used 4 large chicken breasts & cooked on low for 6 hours.  AMAZING!

We used a mild salsa, and I made it with 6 chicken breasts - not quite 3 pounds worth, and didn't adjust any of the other ingredients.  It turned out great, and was a hit with everyone in the family - even the one year old!  It made enough for dinner, lunch the next day, PLUS enough to throw in the freezer as a freezer meal when we need something quick one night.

This recipe is a staple on our dinner menu.  It is a must try! Everyone who I have made this for loves it.  I learned that I don't even need to chop the cilantro.  I throw a full bunch in, stems and all, it ends up falling apart in the sauce.  So good!

This dish has potential to be a great slow cooker meal, but it was way too acidic and salty. I think it would be better to use a good stewed tomato sauce perhaps with your own spicing, like chili powder, cumin etc. We found the combination of the taco packet and salsa salty and very hard on the stomach. But we'll try it again, I was tempted to look up a Cuban dish that is similar to this, but more flavorful.

Easy enough to prep in the morning before work and then set on low to cook for the day. I sauteed my chicken before putting it in the slow cooker for added flavor. I will be making this often!

Omit the taco seasoning.   I've tried several different salsas of various $.  They all make the chicken taste so delicious it melts in your mouth.  When I'm in a hurry, I just put 4 chicken breasts in the crockpot and pour a jar of salsa over the top, cook on low 8 hrs.  So delicious!  Others have commented it gets to dry, add more salsa.

Not sure what I did wrong, but this is not very good. The chicken texture is weird and the sauce itself tastes odd.

Like some of the others, I added corn & black beans, but I also added red onion and jalapeno. When I tasted it, it was lacking in salt & seasoning, so I added salt, garlic, southwestern seasoning, another lime and more cilantro!

Great for chicken tacos or quesadillas. The flavor is wonderful. No changes other than lots more cilantro (love cilantro!) thanks! My family loves this!

I didn't have all the required ingredients on hand so I had to improvise a little, but it still turned out great. I used homemade taco seasoning without oregano, and two basa fillets instead of chicken. The fish was poached perfectly with enough sauce to top the rice as well! We ate it straight without shredding the fish or putting it into tacos. I thought it was so good I had to stop myself from eating more just for the taste. Our 2 year old ate one bite of fish, said he liked it but wouldn't eat anymore. Our 4 year old found the sauce too spicy but since I hadn't shredded all the fish into the sauce there was enough plain fish and rice to balance the spice so that he finished his plate.

This came out great! it was even better the next day. I didn't use all the taco seasoning because I was concerned there would be too much salt. I added some onions and yellow sweet peppers from our garden. It was delish!!

Family absolutely loved this dish. The only change I made was using a small can of diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of salsa, and a good quality taco spice from a spice store. We ate it in warm flour tortillas with sour cream, Mexican style cheese, and black beans. Lots of possibilities with this dish. I ate the leftover meat on tortilla chips and cheese as nachos the next day. Rave reviews from the family.

I made this yesterday and followed the suggestion of another to make my own taco seasoning (found on this site) and everything else I followed. I do agree that it was very salty which is weird coming from me because I normally enjoy to much salt! I should have left it out of the taco seasoning. Other then that it was really easy and you can def work at it and make it to your liking. It's a good base recipe to tweak as you go. The 2nd night we made enchiladas with the chicken and omg it was so much better the 2nd night. It was restaurant quality! We even have enough for tomorrow night and we will make fajitas. It makes a ton! Next time I will use 3 or 4 breast. 3lbs came to 6 breasts. Unless you freeze it or have a big family i would scale back on just the chicken portion. Oh and I used Pace salsa because that's all I had and it was still good. I'm not sure a better brand would really make a big difference but to each his own. Enjoy!!

I just made this today for dinner tonight and my 16 year old love it but I did change the recipe up a little bit. I  used about 2 lbs chicken, did not use the taco seasoning as multiple reviews said it made it salty. I also used 2 limes and did not use that much cilantro as I don't like it much.  I'll probably use this to make enchiladas next time.  The chicken came out nice and moist and had plenty of flavor!!!!!!

I followed recipe and then added 1 chopped onion, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 can of rinsed and drained black beans and 1 can of rinsed and drained corn. House smelled awesome! After cooking for 4 hours, I served in flour tortillas with shredded Mexican cheese, sour cream and more cilantro. You've gotta try this recipe. Mmmm...

Good golly...this was so simple and delicious. Ate the shredded chicken cold over mixed greens and sprouts that I'd simply dressed with red wine vinegar and olive oil. Spooned the sauce over chicken. Restaurant quality meal. Who knew something this quick could be this great?

One of my favorite go to recipes when I'm in a hurry. I do my own taco seasoning (a lot of it) with less salt and keep it on my pantry so its available at all times. I use Herdez salsa (use real Mexican salsa or it won't taste good) and only half a lime. The cilantro I use the whole sting so I can take it out after cooking and most importantly, this works much better with dark meat chicken than with chicken breast.

My fiance and I really enjoyed it. I've made salsa chicken before with tortilla chips, but this one is better because it has the extra kick of the taco package. We ate it with wild rice and it was very good.

This recipe is great and even better because of how easy it is!  I've also made the sauce in batches and frozen.  When I want to use I just toss the frozen sauce and frozen chicken in the slow cooker and let it go.  I serve on soft tacos with cheese & sour cream.

I made this yesterday and am very happy with how it turned out. I didn't have a pkt taco mix so I added chili powder, just a few dried jalapenos, cumin,  chopped green peppers and some sliced roasted red peppers, some grilled corn and a of can black beans....as I was serving it in a bowl, no rice or tortilla.
I added the cilantro at the end because I like to see the vibrant green color before it melts into the dish.
Delicious, I will be making this again soon.

This is my new fav. I really liked the taste. So easy to make. I cooked it on high and it started to burn on the end/walls of the pot. Next time I will cook it on low.

Made this for my son's birthday. Everyone at the party raved about the chicken being moist and having great flavor.  In place of the Salsa I used 16 oz of chicken broth (wanted to omit tomatoes in case a guest did not eat tomatoes). Turned out great!

I fixed this as described in the recipe and it was delicious. I like food a little more on the spicy side so may use hot-style salsa next time. I let it cook six hours on low and the chicken was absolutely falling apart tender. In addition to tacos, it can be used in a variety of ways. Don T.

These were really good! I added the juice of 5 limes instead of one, and used fresh salsa (PW Restaurant Style salsa)which is the key for me. I cooked the chicken on low for 8 hours and after shredding the chicken and returning to the pot, I added another 3/4 cup of salsa and cooked for another 30 minutes. Served on corn tortillas, with avocado and additional squeeze of lime juice. So good and so fresh-tasting!!! Will definitely make again!!!

Loved this recipe!! I used 4 large chicken breasts and 2 smaller ones.  For the salsa, I used fresh, hot salsa.  I used all the ingredients that was called for but used two packages of taco seasoning and 2 limes as other reviewers mentioned previously.  It was spicy but delicious!  I served them as chicken tacos and had leftovers for several days.  This will definitely be added to my "rotation" :)

Love this recipe, used it for my son's first birthday party and got rave reviews from everyone, now its a go to for large gatherings or as a meal to take to someone who just had a baby or got home from the hospital.  I serve alongside a black bean salad and spanish rice, with all the fixings, although with the bursting flavor, you really just need some cheese or sour cream in my opinion.

After reading some of the comments, I also did not use the whole packet of taco seasoning and it was just right. this was a hit in our home and its very versatile. First run we ate in burritos and leftovers were used for dinner in quesdillas. The remaining leftovers were refrigerated and when my husband returned from a business trip couple days later, I heated the chicken, chopped up some greens and made into a salad. Busy mom of 5 all in sports, I will add this to the weekly rotation because of its simplicity and great taste!! Thank you

It was wonderful and so easy to make. I made my own salsa as hubby is allergic to garlic (and garlic is listed in EVERY salsa out there). I use a whole bunch of cilantro and lime in my salsa, so didn't need to add any more in the crockpot. I also didn't use the taco seasoning- just chicken and salsa. It was delicious, will make this again. Perfect for when company comes over too, everyone can make their own taco or tostada.

I cooked this and I just love it! I was very easy to make in no time and was delicious. We used the chicken as a wrap filling and added sour cream, whole kernal corn and lettuce to it. Was really yummy!

Super yummy and easy!  I used a green Medium salsa and it was superb!  I omitted the dry taco seasoning because I didn't want it overly spicy.  Instead each person added more  salsa if they wished. I cooked rice and we filled a flour tortilla shell with the rice, chicken/salsa dish/ shredded lettuce, avocado and sour cream.

Yum!!!!

This was fantastic! I cooked it on slow for 5 hours. My 12 and 4 year old loved it! I will be making this again and often. I used On The Boarder mild salsa and McCormic mild taco seasoning. It was delicious!

Good recipe for inspiration but too salty. I never use jar salsa (fresh is so much better) and on the second try I used 2Tbs of salt-free SW Chipolte seasoning and more cilantro. I also add a little fresh salsa when serving. We like this over brown rice or on tortillas.

There are only 2 of us, so half the chicken, salsa, and low sodium taco seasoning.  I used 4+ tbsp. of cilantro and a whole small lime. It was plenty of wet contents for the amount of chicken.  I added 3 tbsp. of chopped onion and half a drained can of corn (no salt added).  The corn added a lot of flavor.  Cooked it on low in a crock pot for 2 hours and that was plenty then shredded it.  We ate it in whole wheat tortillas and/or baked Tostitos.  Low calorie meal but watch the sodium!  Whoever said omitting taco seasoning was a good idea was very wrong.  It adds most of the flavor to the meat itself.

This is my go-to recipe to make chicken filling for tacos, burritos, nachos, quesadillas and all things mexican. I like to add a can of black beans, corn and mexican diced tomatoes. I have also tried with many different salsas, I like it best with the chunky style - mild so the kids don't complain about the heat - the slow cooker intensifies the seasonings. I throw it on low all day, shred the chicken and add lime and FRESH cilantro and cook another half hour. What a great recipe!

Delicious!!!  I used fresh salsa from Costco, taco seasoning, lime juice and because I didn't have fresh cilantro on hand, I used cilantro infused oil. I made it for my husband and boys and my finicky sons asked for second and third servings! So easy and so delicious!

Great recipe! The salsa choice makes the dish - I used La Fogata Chipotle Salsa (You can get this if you're in and around South Texas). Don't skimp on the lime and cilantro either; this equals super fresh awesome fun time family recipe.

I really like this recipe. I have made it several times now. If I have leftovers I like to add some chicken broth, water and pinto beans to it. If need be I will add more salsa, cilantro and taco seasoning. Once it is heated I serve it with tortilla chips for a tasty and easy chicken tortilla soup.

I used McCormick taco seasoning packet and Joe T. Garcia's salsa verde. Great combination!

Skipped the seasoning packet since I really enjoy the flavor of the salsa I use. Used chicken thighs instead of breast. Was very tender, flavorful. Using thighs made it a little more fatty/runny/juicy that it probably would have been with breast meat. Will make this again for sure!

Very tasty....some might find it a tad too salty so you can go with a lower sodium packet of taco seasoning if desired. I added medium salsa because we like a little heat and was not too spicy for my 4 yr old. I did this with beef and it was very good.

This is one of my favorites! Great for office pot lucks, family get-togethers and more! I prefer the black bean and corn salsa, and only use a half packet of taco seasoning, as it seems too salty with a whole packet. Incredibly easy to just dump everything into a crock pot, turn on the switch and let it go.

This was a great recipe! I made about 2lbs of chicken (thin sliced breasts) with 1.5 jars of salsa. I used Tostitos restaurant style, and I made my own taco seasoning to control the salt. I ate this 5 days in a row for lunch with some rice. Oh man was this good! Definitely will be putting this into my crock pot rotation.

Love love love this! The best thing is you can add anything to it. Tonight is my 2nd time making it and I threw in a red pepper, onion, chilli beans along with all the other ingredients. My hubby loves rice so we add that to our tacos. A cilantro lime rice bc we already have all the needed ingredients!

This turned out really good. I used 4 chicken breast, 1 jar of salsa and two packets of chicken taco seasoning. after 3 hours on high i shredded the chicken, replaced it in the slow cooker then added the lime juice and cilantro. I cooked it for another hour and this is going to be my go to recipe for shredded chicken from now on :)

Do not use packaged taco mix...it would be worth your while to make a batch of the taco seasoning recipe from this site instead.  Put a couple of tablespoons of that in, and you'll be golden.  Do not add the cilantro nor lime juice at the beginning.  I would put them both in at the very end as a sort of garnish.  You never want to cook lime juice.

My family loved this. I took the advice of some of reviews and added a little more lime and put about a cup of cilantro. I might add even more cilantro next time we make it. Other than that I followed the recipe. Very yummy!

Yummy! We had pre-herbed frozen chicken breasts from target and just used those and didnt add the taco seasoning. I added more cilantro cause I love it. It turned out great. My husband loved it as well. We put it on some tortillas and had it as tacos.

Perfect for taco night! I love this recipe - super easy to throw together, a little bit time consuming to shred the chicken, but the end result is worth it. I accidentally doubled the salsa once, and then I kept doing it that way because it was so good! I also usually use dried cilantro, and it's still delicious. Once it's shredded, I often add a couple chopped up chili peppers to give it a little more heat, or add a can of black beans to make it go a little further.

This is PERFECT. I can use this chicken in so many dishes, soups, tacos, burritos, sandwiches! Or just eat it alone, the flavor was fantastic! I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 3 lbs and it cooked in 3 hrs to perfection, where it was still juicy.

We love this recipe! It is the only way we make chicken taco's now! Very easy, though I didn't have any cilantro so I just double the dry that I had. Very big hit in our house!

Great recipe.  We added corn to the recipe and then served it with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.  I would recommend reserving some of the lime juice and cilantro to add after cooking.

My kids loved this! I served it in corn tortillas with a little bit of shredded cheese and sour cream. I made a black bean and corn salad to go along as a side. Everyone in the family insisted on this becoming a repeat.

Super easy to make! I used Trader Joe's Taco Seasoning and their Salsa. The flavor was wonderful! We used tortilla's but they fell apart. Next time I will try it over Mexican rice and black beans.

With a few changes, this has become a go-to weeknight meal for us.  I use Rachel Ray's homemade taco seasoning recipe; add twice the cilantro; garlic; and a dash of smoky chipotle tobasco.  Easy and delicious served on warm tortillas with lettuce, tomato, and a little sour cream.  I've also used pork loin chops instead of chicken - turns out great every time.

This is a must try for picky eaters- I made this last night for my husband and he said it was THE BEST THING IVE EVER MADE AND WANTS ME TO MAKE IT WEEKLY! I followed the recipe (mostly) but used 1.5 lbs of chicken and only 1 T of taco seasoning. I used Newmans' Own mild salsa. I also added some fresh cilantro and lime at the end. I served it with white rice, green beans and black beans, and topped with avocado. Will probably try it wrapped in tortillas next week!

This was very good and can be used for many different things for EXAMPLE: tacos, enchiladas, salads, etc....  I doubled recipe except the taco seasoning (just one packet for 6 lbs. of meat).  I did double everything else as well as used fresh spices from my garden, added about 1 cup of water and sprinkled some chicken bouillon on top for more flavor.  I also added a sautéed onion to the salsa mixture before adding to the crock pot. I cooked the meat all day (at least 8 hours on low), pulled meat out at about the 5 hour point, shredded, then back in crock pot with more fresh spices.  Delish!  Served with corn tortillas (which were heated on the burner), topped freshly shredded cheese, avocado slices, jalapeno pepper slices, tomato, lettuce and for some (a little sour cream)! YUM YUM.....served with refried black beans and Spanish rice on the side.  The next day, I brought some of the meat mixture to work, heated and placed on top of salad greens.  PERFECT!  There was plenty to freeze for extra meals in the near future. My entire family from 8 years to 55 years loved this recipe. VERY SIMPLE!

I add a can of rinsed/drained black beans and corn.  One sliced onion and pepper go in under the (frozen) chicken breasts.  First night we serve it over brown rice, another night we serve it as burritos and then it's lunches for me and my husband.  It's a favorite easy meal in our house.

Omg! Of course i have my own version, i added rinsed black beans, chopped sweet onion, approx 3 cups frozen corn, extra salsa to make up for the thickness i just added. I served this on a bed of crisp green lettuce topped with hot whole wheat rice and a dallop of sour cream. Cant wait until im hungry again, yummy! Feel free to add extra spices to suit your family

I added an extra lime and used a taco seasoning recipe without salt after reading the reviews.  I loved the final results, but I only gave it 4 stars because I made those changes to it.  It was great, and went great with the mexicorn from this site and some tortillas.

I used a Pineapple Mango Salsa (24oz. instead of 16 oz.) and doubled the cilantro.  I took an extra lime and squeezed it onto the chicken.  I mixed up the ingredients beforehand and marinated the chicken in the frig for a few hours before cooking.  It was really delish!

I really liked this recipe!  Made it as written but added  a can each of drained/rinsed corn and black beans.  The chicken turned out very moist and tasty, and it was so nice to be able to quickly shred the chicken with forks and serve at dinnertime.  Will definitely make this one again!

I just found this blah. I think it could be good served as one review said - as chicken enchiladas. But just served as is over rice is too plain.

We loved this recipe.  We made chicken tacos with lettuce, cheese, avocado and fresh cilantro.  I made on the stove rather than in the slow cooker and used bone in breasts because that was what I had on hand.  I am sure they were more trouble shredding and removing the bones, but still turned out delicious.

Easy. Delicious. Versatile. We made taco salad with the chicken. Chicken tacos would be yummy. So would adding it to cheese quesadillas. We made a half batch for our family and wished we'd done the full recipe. At first it seemed watery from the salsa but after shredding the chicken the water amount was perfect.

Our family loved this.  We had it in tortillas.  It smelled great as it was cooking and was easy to make.  I followed the directions and cooked on low for 8 hours.  The chicken shredded nicely with 2 forks.  I can easily see this becoming a regular for us.

Delicious! I'm making it for the 2nd time right now and it makes my house smell yummy! I followed the receipe exactly, but added a little extra cilantro. It has a lot of flavor without being too spicy, and I also like how easy and cheap it is to make. We'll have it over rice and use leftovers for a quesadilla filling. YUM!

Wow! This is a great one for busy moms to prepare quickly and easily and not have to worry about dinner being ready. Love that I usually have these things on hand and it makes meal planning easy. I like it with 2 limes for my taste and my picky 2 year old and husband like it too. Add in a can of black beans or corn if you like too, or serve with rice. Yum!

Made exactly to the recipe.  Cooked about 8 hours on low and it shredded SO easily!  Served with flour tortillas, pico, sour cream and salsa.  Really great!  Don't overdo the lime.  I used one medium size but very juicy lime and it was almost too much for my taste

I have been making this recipe for years without the cilantro and lime juice and my family LOVES it!  I serve it with Spanish Rice, refried beans with mozzarella cheese melted on top and flour tortillas.  However, I think the next time I will try the cilantro and lime.  Sounds delish!

Amazing!  Not too spicy and not too salty (like other reviewers stated).  I used Pace medium salsa and slow-cooked the chicken from 11pm to 8am.  Shredding was a breeze and everyone who had it just raved over it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This tasted like I was getting a fancy burrito from a restaurant.  Very very good!  I did add a little bit of rice to the crockpot and we put the mixture in a burrito.  I can't say how good this was.  Added some cheese in the burrito and YUM!!

My family LOVED this recipe. I didn't use taco seasoning packet because it got left off the grocery list.  I just added some cumin, garlic powder, pepper, etc.  I had a jar of really fresh flavored salsa, so it, plus the few spices added plenty of flavor. It was so tender!!  I served it with sautéed peppers and red onion.  This will now be in our regular rotation..

Delicious. I made the refried beans without the refry from this site and everyone made their own nachos using the shredded chicken. Wish I had doubled the recipe so I could have it in the freezer for when those unexpected guests drop by.

Fantastic!  Soooo easy and so delicious!  I doubled the recipe and took the advice of previous reivews stating that they found it a bit salty so I used one regular package of taco seasoning and one package of low sodium.  We just served it on both soft and hard shells with guacamole, tomatoes, shredded cheese and sour cream.  Deeelish!  I will definitely keep this recipe and make again.  Excellent for a large group.

This was great.  As someone else recommended, I added a bag of frozen corn.  I also added a can of pinto beans and served it over brown rice and shredded cheddar cheese over it when I served it.  Easy and delicious.

I love this recipe as is (use low sodium ingredients)..  I sometimes add black beans and kernel corn, serve over rice and it's a complete meal..  Either way, it gets rave reviews!

This was a very delicious and easy recipe. I did take the advice of others and added a can of black beans towards the end and I used a Mango salsa I had on hand. Yuuuummmmm!! Will use the leftovers for Enchiladas this week. Thank you

I made this tonight....yummy!  I knew it was going to be good because of all of the reviews but it turned out better than I expected.  The cilantro I used came out of a bottle, the taco seasoning was old, the lime juice came from a bottle and I used a mild chunky salsa.  WOW was it good....I can not imagine what it would taste like with fresh ingredients.  My 12 year old son loved it too.  I used it wrapped up in a burrito with cheese and sour cream at first.  Then I tried it with chips, cheese and sour cream - that was salty.  It does not taste salty unless you are eating it with chips.  I had the cheesy baked doritos.  The mixture was salty...but still good.  I really wish I had some avacodos on hand.  :-)  I cut up the chicken because I prefer to cook it that way and I turned it to low after about an hour.  I think I had my burrito after about 3 hours of cook time.

Husband loved it.  I made it EXACTLY like the recipe.  I agree with the others...it depends on what kind of salsa and seasoning you use.  We ended up having to put A LOT of salt in ours...when I hate using salt.  I should have used the extra lime...that would have been a great addition!  We also threw it all in a tortilla.  Really good though!!!  Yes...the cilantro would have been stronger if added later...but it depends on just how strong you want it. I put mine in at the beginning and it was just fine.

Delicious!!! Made this today, and WOW.  I only had bone in chicken, but it turned out terrific.  Took another reviewers suggestion and doubled the homemade taco seasoning amount and doubled the cilantro as I had a ton.  Served it with some of the sauce over rice with a nice salad.

This was excellent! I made this exactly as written...I used Chi Chi's taco seasoning, I've usually found that to be less salty than others and Newman's Own Garden Salsa. I got two meals out of this recipe. The first night we used the chicken for tostadas and then the next night I made chimichangas with the leftovers. Will be making this again for sure!

This came out better than I expected!  I used homemade Taco Seasoning (without the chili powder) from this site, using half a recipe in place of the packet, plus I reduced the salt in that recipe from 1 1/2 tsp to 1/2 tsp (personal preference), and I used homemade salsa and doubled the cilantro.  Even though I used chicken breasts, which tend to dry out on my no matter what I do, the chicken was so juicy and tender and shredded so easily with a fork.  Can't wait to put this stuff to good use!

4.5 Stars for ease and taste.  I cooked 5 breasts on high for 4 hours, then shredded and refrigerated until dinner the next night.  We used them in soft tortillas and I plan to make quesadillas as well.  Super easy and tasty.

As far as flavor goes this was awesome! But I accidently over cooked the chicken and it came out dry, but I cant blame the recipe for that. I would like to pick a weekend to try this one again and pay attention to the chicken a little more.

This is super easy to make, and the chicken comes out very tender and easy to shred. I followed the suggestion to add the lime and cilantro in the last hour of cooking. The flavor was very good. I used mild salsa, then provided my guests with hot sauce to spice it to their liking. I used the shredded chicken as filling for soft tacos. It got rave reviews from my family and friends.

As a native New Mexican, I rarely find food that can pass as Mexican. This tasted just like the Mexican tacos I've had in the past. I loved it! I followed a previous review, and added the cilantro and lime in during the last hour of cooking. I also followed another reviewer's advice and used a good salsa, as opposed to some generic brand. I look forward to having this again!

I can see the potential in this recipe, but actually found it to be bland.  However, I read several reviews and believe that you really have to use good salsa for this recipe (I used La Victoria, which I am not crazy about). I also used a lower sodium taco seasoning and found myself wanting to add salt at the table.  On a more positive note, the lime and celantro really brighten the dish and the chicken was super easy top shred.

make sure to pull apart the chicken, and cook another hour.  don't over cook though, can taste dry.  freezes well.  easy tacos.  needs more spices to don't worry about overdoing it in that dept.

Very good recipe! The chicken can be used for many types of dishes. I used my own taco seasoning and added half a can of roasted diced tomatoes with the liquid. I also used the breast and wings of a whole fryer and omitted the cilantro. My boyfriend and I had this on white corn tortillas with homemade quacamole. It was really delicious!

this was surprisingly bland even with 2x the salsa and 2x the cilantro.  i added a can of black beans and a can of corn for texture and served in tortillas.  but giving four stars because 1. it's easy, 2. 20-month-old LOVES it and 3. it does make a LOT so used as enchilada filling and still have plenty left over for another meal.

It was good, but after cooking in the slow cooker, the lime and cilantro didnt "burst" like I had hoped. Next time I may add more lime and cilantro.

This is a simple, great recipe.  I LOVE cilantro and lime.  I grew up in San Diego, eating Mexican food all the time.  I use half of the taco seasoning called for (it is a no no when cooking authentic Mexican food.  But you can hardly tase it when it is done).  I use 1 1/2 times the salsa, 4x the lime, and one whole bunch of cilantro.  It ends up super moist.  The only reason for giving four stars is for the quantities of ingredients given.

Loved this recipe and plan to make another batch very soon.  Shared with a friend and she loved it also.  I used it in soft tacos and plan to try it over rice.  I took some of it work along with black beans and put over top of lettuce with 3 cheese ranch dressing and tortillia chips on the side.  It was wonderful!  I will be making this at least once a month just to have some in the freezer for a quick meal!

This is a fantastic and extremely easy recipe! I serve it on soft flour tortillas with fresh cilantro, black olives, shredded cheddar etc. I've even used the leftovers to make a great quesadilla!

This meal is amazing!! I put it on some microwavable spanish rice and added pinto beans and corn and it was a hit!! I chopped up an jalepeno as well and added some ground black pepper it was really spicy and delicious.  I used no taco seasoning at all b/c I used pace picante sauce (hot) which adds a tremendous amount of flavor. I defiantely recommend this meal.

We all really liked this dish. I only had 1 1/2 lbs chicken but still used the whole jar of salsa - so I used the full amount of everything else. Added 6TBL cilantro, which wasn't overwhelming. I also added about 1/2 cup of rice, there's not a lot of liquid so I hesitate adding any more. The shredding is really a preference. I think it might have even made it taste a bit dry. Next time I will cut/rip it into chunks after it cooks. Some of ate it with tortilla chips, others in a tortilla, but it would also taste good over rice.

Great and Easy family dinner!  It was a hit at home and I'll definitely make it again.  I used 1 and 1/2 jars of Salsa, added a 2 Tbl of olive oil to prevent drying, 1 can of kernel corn, 1 can black beans (drained), 2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I cooked on low for 5 hours.  Served over rice and sauted an onion for those that liked it.  It was delicious.  I also thought this would be a nice starter to a chicken chili.  Thx for the great recipe!

Absolutely delicious. I used a smoky chipotle salsa hoping to just get the smoky flavor with no heat. (We don't like hot spicy) It worked great. I would just add that it could use a bit more garlic. I used black beans, pinto beans, corn, peas, leaks for some veggies. Keeps it lower carb, and with the chicken breast, almost no fat. You could actually add rice to this, and it would be a perfect Mexican Chicken soup.

This is missing something. I think it would have been much better with sour cream on top or in burritos or tacos. Just served it over rice and beans I wasnt so impressed.

I would skip the premade taco seasoning and just use onion powder, garlic powder and cumin (if you like). This will cut down on the sodium immensely and provide a lot of flavor. The canned (jar) salsa will have more than enough salt. If you don't have spices go ahead and use the taco seasoning and substitute diced tomatoes and onions...

I made this last night, LOVED IT.  It is a HUGE portion though.  I added 1 cup of chicken broth to the slow cooker because I was afraid that the chicken would get dried out.  This added to the juiciness of the chicken when I shredded it and let it set on low for another half hour.  Great Receipe, not salty at all and I love that it't low in fat and calories!!   Will be making if for our next party.

Can't get any easier than this. I doubled the amount of lime/ cilantro and cooked on low for 6hrs. Also, I used a fire roasted salsa. As easy as this is, it can be used in a variety of recipes like enchiladas, arroz con pollo and tortilla soup (add 1-2 qts of chicken stock to chicken mixture with strips of corn tortillas as a garnish).

Delicious and easy, served over rice and as a fajita ... the chicken was tender and delicous.  Separated the chicken from the sauce and served each separately great easy meal That I am sure to make again!

Very easy preparation for a great meal. Other than adding extra cilantro I followed as written. We smeared sour cream on top of tostada shells and then sponned this on top. Unusual but delicious!!!

tasty, tasty tasty. we love this recipe so much that we have it at least twice a month. One thing we added was extra cilantro and sliced onions about 3 hours into cooking. Warm tortillas and add some homemade salsa and enjoy.  muy muy bueno

My husband liked it, but I thought it was salty and to saucy not enough flavour and it was too spicy for my son.

My familiy LOVES this!  I'm making it tonight for 11 people, just doubled the recipe.  I also add rinsed black beans and frozen white corn 30 mins before serving.  Served in taco shells for crunch.  DELISH!

This recipe came out very nice. It was super easy to make and was nice not having to fuss over dinner in the evening. I added a touch more lime than it called for and my husband loved the lime flavor of the chicken.

Fantastic recipe! I'm making it for the second time. All three of my young kids enjoyed this. It's going to be a while before I make the standard ground beef tacos again. If I got these tacos in a restaurant, I would be thrilled!

So, so yummy! I used salsa verde because it was what I had on hand.  The chicken was so tasty and tender, my family ate it solo.  They said it was too good to put in a tortilla!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly--except I used dried cilantro not fresh (did not have any).  Thanks!!!
