Delicious and easy.. tarragon and thyme are nice in this. I used Greek yogurt instead of cream and it was prefect

I guess I am not a fan of Tarragon, but I liked this anyway. I had no half n half, so I added sour cream @ the end....after I pureed in blender. Very thick n creamy! I would make this again without Tarragon...

I didn't have any dried terragon so I substituted it with dried basil. Also added some uncooked bean sprouts to the hot soup before serving and let them cook in it's heat on the table. Added a lovely crunch. Long story short, no leftovers!

I originally gave this a 3 star but changed it to 4 stars as my husband loved it (he can be picky, too) and went back for a second bowl.  I do think it is the preference of spices. My original review: Overall I'd say good but not great.  The base is nice tasting and creamy after blending, I just didn't care for the spice combination.  I think I would prefer it with different spices but this is my personal preference.  You may like the spices. UPDATE: It sat for 4 days and the fridge and it was quite good.  I think the spices ahd to mellow for me.

Fabulous recipe.  Easy and delicious.  We had it three days running and it just got better each day.  I didn't have cream so I stirred in yogurt but it was flavored with vanilla.  At first the vanilla flavor was a bit too much, but after the first day, it was excellent.

Pretty, nutritious, and an inexpensive go-to soup. It cooked up beautifully in my pressure cooker in half the time, making it a quick meal, too.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Lee.

Truthfully I am rating the carrot to liquid ratio and the fact that this is not a 400 calorie per serving veggie soup!  I had two gigantic carrots and this soup was perfect.  My changes were - 1. I sauted the onion in a pat of butter with the garlic before adding to the soup pot. 2. I didn't need to add any water.  Just one "box" of broth.  3. As for spices, I added herbes de Provence, salt, a little "Worcestershire pub burger seasoning", and smoked paprika. 4.  I omitted the cream because I am counting calories and the soup didn't need it.  This is an excellent low cal savory soup!!

It was delicious and very easy to make! I made a few changes: I used basil instead of tarragon, and instead of heavy cream I added sour cream (2 heaping spoonfuls). I also added more carrots to enhance the carrot flavor. I also added a pinch of sugar. It gets better the next day. I think when i make it again I will use cream cheese instead of sour cream. This is a fun basic recipe because you can customize it according to your own personal tastes! My husband loved it. Great way to get in those veggies!

I live in Japan, so I improvised a lot and still this came out delicious.  Three tablespoons consomm√© powder instead of broth.  Four cups water. 
Basil instead of tarragon. 
A bit of whole milk (maybe a half cup) instead of cream. 
I added cumin. 
Amazing.

Super easy and tasty.  I added evaporated milk instead of cream as I had it leftover from another soup I made, and it turned out great.  It's great reheated too.
