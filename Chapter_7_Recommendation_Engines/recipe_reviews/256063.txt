Ok, so I made this exactly as directed to begin with, cooking to exactly 236 degrees on my candy thermometer. I ended up with a pan of goo . . . tasty goo . . . I could have just eaten it with a spoon, it was that good . . . but I really wanted to be able to slice it like fudge, so I put it back into the pan and heated it again to a firm ball stage. It set up just like fudge, and cut well, but it's a bit grainy. I wish I would have just left it at the gooey stage and put it in a jar and used it as an ice cream topping or to add to coffee. Would make again that way, but not as fudge.

Made it but tweaked it a little;
1 can coconut milk 
1can coconut cream 
1can condense milk
Pinch salt 
2tlbs of butter

Stirred until thickened and turned light brown, added the butter, stirred for a minute or 2 , transfer to an oil/butter pan, waited a bit and cut with a  bread cutter. Last part needs to be done quick. Next time I’m gonna take of the heat couple minutes before. I did visited a couple of YouTube videos. Lol
Not bad for my first try,
I think some people just didn’t let it simmer down enough

I made this exactly as directed, using the vanilla and ginger. Cooking to exactly 236 degrees on my candy thermometer. I ended up with a pan of goo. Tasty, but not fudge.
