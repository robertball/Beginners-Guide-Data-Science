Try it! I had a slightly smaller loaf pan so I made a loaf and muffins. The peaches I had were large so I only needed 4. It had the perfect amount of nuts and the texture/moisture was very nice. The loaf was loved by friends and family, but we all agreed it needed more cinnamon so after buttering the muffin pan I dusted it with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar (1tps cinnamon - 1T sugar). Perfect.

Decent bread, nice and moist too. I upped the cinnamon to 1.5tsp and would have preferred chunks of peaches in the bread vs. using all puree.

I had a freezer-full of frozen peaches from last year's harvest, and have begun my holiday baking. This looked like a practical and simple recipe to make, so I used it. I made a double batch, for a yield of 12 mini loaves. (baking time on these little loaves is about 30-45 minutes). The only one change I opted for was ONE extra egg, for a total of five eggs (double recipe). I shared one loaf with my family, and we all agreed this is a five-star recipe. Very moist, dense, rich in flavor. Would be delicious as an accompaniment to a good, hot cup of coffee or cocoa :) I also think Santa would be tickled pink to find warm  slices of this delicious bread waiting for him, with a glass of cold milk!

Don't know how it tastes but I followed the directions and used a 9x5 loaf pan.  It's been in the oven for about 15 minutes and it is running down the sides of the pan. Lucky for me I placed the pan on a cookie sheet.  Thought it looked too full. Read all reviews w/ no mention of runover.

Made this delicious bread with fresh Colordao Palisades peaches and it won great raves, so I will make it again tomorrow. It made enough for a standard loaf pan plus 6 muffins and it was moist with a  wonderful peachy taste.  Note- I did adjust for our 5,000 ft high altitude here in Denver and both bread and muffins came out perfect. Great recipe so thank you very much.

This was FANTASTIC!  I'll definitely be making this again.  I used a can of peaches and chopped them up and it was super moist.  Made this for work and people were raving about it??

I added a teaspoon of nutmeg and a little more almond extract. It is pretty moist and what is interesting is that you don't get full flavor until after the first bite.  Great bread!

Great way to use lots of ripe peaches I picked... will be saving this one. 

Did not have almond extract used vanilla, still fantastic.

These are delicious! Super moist and not too peachy. I do think next time I will add some chopped up peach along with the puréed peach to get bites of peach throughout. Will definitely make again!

Fabulous!  I only had 2 cups of peaches and added a banana - super delicious!  Also saved some of the pecans to put on top - split into two loaf pans due to past reviews - perfect.

Absolutely in love how moist this bread is.  I did add less sugar just because I didn't have enough. Everyone who tried it love it.  Thank you

Super easy and delicious.  I wasn’t sure what to do with my frozen peaches from last summer and came across this recipe. My family loved it!

Almond extract overpowers the peach and the pecans. It tastes like almond cake. I made it again with vanilla extract instead and it was great.

Delicious. Increased cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. This bread was golden and moist, just perfect.. except... too much almond extract. I would make it again for sure but reduce to 1/2 teaspoon. Almost overwhelms the peaches otherwise. But this is a keeper. My oven is cheap and slow, it took 70 minutes, but did not over-brown, so it was perfect.
