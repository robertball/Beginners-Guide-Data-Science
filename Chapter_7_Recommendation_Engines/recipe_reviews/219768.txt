Very very delicious! I have to say the sauce was really good. The combining of clam juice & wine reduction with the alfredo sauce made the ingredients marry so well. It really pulled the clam flavor all the way through the sauce. I thought at first it was going to be really runny but as it turns out, it wasn't. The red pepper flakes gave it a nice heat at the end, but isn't totally neccessary at all, especially with minor children. The only thing I felt that needed more of...was the clams. my cans were 6.5oz cans not 10 oz so for the clams it's self I used 3 cans and only because it look like sauce with a few pieces. And I totally watched how much reserved clam juice I needed because the cans were a total of 13oz, not counting the 3rd can of reserved juice. But however, I'd make this again in a heartbeat. Very well paired with whole grain Linguine noodles. TY grainie.

Made this last night and I must say: we all enjoyed it. Small change: made the Alfredo myself. Otherwise, recipe is excellent as is. Thanks so much.

Nice easy twist on the boring jarred alfredo sauce.  The hubby wasn't overly impressed by it, yet he inhaled it! I would use more wine next time.  I topped with shrimp and broccoli. I would make this again.

BEST clam sauce I've ever made. I did make a few small adjustments which kicked it up a notch- BACON!!! And mushrooms.  Instead of using butter and olive oil, I just fried up about 5 slices of bacon (chopped into pieces before frying). Then added the onions to the bacon grease and bacon pieces, then added fresh mushrooms roughly chopped, then garlic, etc..  Also, I squeezed 1/2 a lemon to the clam juice and wine reduction. The Alfredo sauce is genius and the red pepper flakes add the perfect amount of spice. Phenomenal!!

I love this recipe.  It is so easy, fast and tastes wonderful.  Only changes I made was to leave out the wine and used 2-6.5 oz cans of clams instead of one 10 oz.  We will definitly make this again!

Very delicious. Served over a bed of spinach leaves, topped with finely sliced tomato , feta cheese and green onion. I also added a dozen shrimp and 1/4 cup more wine in the sauce.

Outstanding.  I doubled the crab meat.  I cooked the shrimp in a garlic butter sauce.  I added a touch of white wine (about 1/4 cup).

I really enjoyed this quick, tasty meal.  I used the Classico Alfredo sauce and it was perfect.  I only used a dash of the red pepper flakes and added some parsley for some color.  I did have to make about 12-14 ounces of pasta to use up all the sauce, 8 oz was not enough in my opinion.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, using 3 cans of Snows Chopped Clams, using all the juice from the cans to reduce with the wine.  Really good recipe, dare I say restaurant quality?  Thanks grainie for the recipe.

This was so much better than I expected. My grocery store didn't have whole canned clams - they were either chopped or minced. So instead I bought a bottle of clam juice and a bag of frozen baby clams. I soaked the clams in the clam juice for about an hour so they they both defrosted and got their natural salty flavor back. I used Bertolli Alfredo Sauce with Herbs and used way more than 1 tbsp of wine. I let the juice, wine and veggies cook down to about half before adding the sauce and then added the clams at the last minute so they warmed through but didn't get rubbery. This was absolutely delicious and I will definitely add this to our Christmas seafood dinner this year.
