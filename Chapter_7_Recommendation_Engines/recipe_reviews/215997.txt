As I looked over this recipe I noticed that while it looked like a fairly standard chocolate chip recipe on its surface, it had less flour than most.  Even tho’ I was somewhat concerned that this would impact the texture and thickness in a negative way (i.e. greasy and flat) I decided to take a chance on it.  I mixed up the dough as directed and refrigerated it for an hour or so until it became somewhat firm. And just to substantiate my initial concern, they did turn out greasy and flat. Or maybe I should say, “very buttery and not as thick as I would like.” Remembering sooo many years ago when I tried the original Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and disliked it for the same reasons (greasy and flat), curiosity got to me and I looked up that recipe and…sure enough, except for an additional teaspoon of vanilla, this Ghiradelli recipe is the exact same recipe!  No wonder I disliked these cookies so much! It’s the cookie I’ve ALWAYS disliked.  In fairness I should add, however, that the Nestle Toll House recipe is a classic that has stood the test of time, perhaps because the flavor can’t be beat.  And that there are plenty of people who LIKE their chocolate chip cookies greasy and flat, er, I mean, very buttery and thin.  So, bottom line: for those who do not like the kind of cookie I’ve described, either try adding another ½ cup of flour or moving on to a different recipe.  If, on the other hand, you love the Nestle Toll House recipe, you’ll love this one too.

Watch OUT! I have been baking with my Mum and Granny since I was 5 years old and never have I messed up a chocolate chip cookie as badly as this!  When I opened the oven my jaw dropped... they were as flat as pancakes, totally greasy, and when they cooled they were crispy like peanut brittle.  My baking ego was completely destroyed! But I fixed it :)  I mixed in 1/3 cup flour and 1/2 cup rolled oats to the remaining batter and refrigerated it.  Came out perfect. I expected that a recipe off the back of a package of chocolate chips would be fool-proof... I'll know better for next time.  There are much better recipes out there - tastier, more interesting, and healthier.

I really loved these.  I understand it's a *standard* cookie, I felt it held up to what chocolate chip cookies should be.  I mixed a day ahead, and did include pecans.  I used a cookie scoop the day of, and thru baking, they held their shape pretty well.  I will definitely do these again.

I read the other reviews after I made the recipe & these cookies came out plump & tasty. I didn't refrigerate the dough but I did mix the sugar/butter combo until really light & fluffy with my mixer then added all the other ingredients. I used the unsalted butter; but because I had no vanilla extract I substituted Frangelico liquor in its place that gives it a small hazelnut flavor. These cookies came out beautiful & tasty ... And 9 min at 350F on darked cookie sheet; 10 min on lighter cookie sheet; cookies came out delicious :)

I only keep salted butter on hand so I used that and eliminated the extra salt. I made no other changes, other than using organic ingredients where I could. I did chill the dough for an hour or so (I made the dough this morning while the kids ate breakfast, then set it in the fridge until I got back from taking my older boy to school.) I used fine chopped pecans. These baked up really nicely. 350* for 10 minutes was just right for me. Next time, I might use half extra dark chocolate chips when I make this recipe. I think that would be really good.

These are my favorite choc. chip cookies but I did make a couple of changes. I always use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup of shortening. I also add a little extra flour to the dough. I have also played around with the nuts and found slivered almonds make a great cookie! I have never had these to be flat or greasy. My husband is not a huge fan of big chunks of chocolate in his cookies, so I chop the chocolate up into very fine peces and increase the amount of nuts. Great cookie.

Boo Hiss. Cookies turned out flat and gushy. We had to eat them with a spoon over ice cream. Disappointing.

While I definitely prefer using semi-sweet chocolate chips, the milk chocolate ones were decent in a cookie.

Also, my rule with many cookie recipes that have a higher butter to flour ratio is: always add 1/4-1/2 cup of additional flour, or until the cookie dough is stiff.  This way, the cookies come out of the oven thicker.  Unless, of course, you like thin and crispy cookies!

These are a great cookie overall. I often use milk chocolate chips in my cookies and I recently bought Ghiradelli chocolate chips so I decided to give these a try. The only change I made was to use salted butter instead of unsalted. Two cups of Ghiradelli Milk Chocolate Chips equals the whole 11.5 ounce bag, just so you know. I was skeptical with the high baking temperature of 375 so I only baked two cookies to try it out. I found they brown too much, too fast around the sides and remain doughy in the middle. You may want to adjust your baking temperature for this recipe. I baked mine the second time after freezing my dough into balls at 325 for about 15-17 minutes and the cookie baked to a nice golden brown all over and ended up to be the perfect cookie. This recipe cal also be found on the back of the Ghiradelli Milk Chocolate Chip bag.

Made these for the first time the other day as I had a bag of chips in the cupboard. Never used 2t of vanilla before just the standard tollhouse recipe and these were fantastic.  Mine only made 36 cookies as I made walnut size balls and baked that way. YUM!

My husband (the dough tester) was convinced I screwed this one up. (by the batter taste) I thought it tasted overly sweet, also. When I cooked the first batch it was doughy... "greesy"? I over-baked the rest and chilled it. They wer ok after sitting but iv had better. At least my husband wouldn't be eating all the batter with these:) happy baking

It's as close to perfection as anyone will get. I get so many compliments. Don't over mix, butter can't be too soft, just slightly squeezable. Sift the dry ingredients and follow directions exactly!!! I bake at 370 for 10 minutes, 30 seconds. They may not look all the way done, but, get them out of oven and on to paper towel, ( just absorbs a little of the butter), and there you have a PERFECT cookie!!!! Never flat or greasy. I add the whole bag of semi sweet and sometimes chopped walnuts. Drop by a decent size ball on cookie sheet, ( never refriderate this dough before baking). Delicious!!!!

This it the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I use.  Everytime I make it and give some cookies to other people, they rave about how good they are.  Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate chips make the taste difference in this recipe.  I have tried using other popular chocolate chip brands as a substitute when my local grocery store was out of Ghirardelli and the cookies did not taste as good.  The only time my cookies were too soft was when my butter melted too much.

Flat and greasy. Not my ideal cookie and my 5 year old hated them. Definitely needs more flour.

These taste ok but look awful.  They flatten out and are very brown.  I like a thicker chewier cookie.  If I were to make these again I would add some flour to them.

I followed the recipe as written but I did use room temperature eggs and let the batter chill for one day. Cookies cooked perfectly at 375 for 9 minutes. Not flat at all! The only change I would make is using milk chocolate chips instead of the semi sweet I used.

Good standard chocolate chip cookie. No issues with flat or too greasy as others mentioned. Didn't have baking soda so I subbed with baking powder x3. Turned out great.

This is my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. My only modification is that I replace half the butter with an equivalent volume of coconut oil. The texture and color are beautiful, and the cookies have just the tiniest hint of mild coconut flavor, which is delicious.

The first time I made these I accidently only used one stick of butter (1/2 cup) and they were so good!  This time I used an entire cup and way too greasy as everyone else said.  Also, I think an entire bag of chocolate chips is too much.  I added toasted almonds and results were fantastic!
