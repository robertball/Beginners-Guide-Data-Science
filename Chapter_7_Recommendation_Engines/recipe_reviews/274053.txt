As written, I would give this 3-1/2 stars.  It's a good starting point, but it's not as flavorful as I expected.  I would double the curry paste and add chile garlic sauce for some heat.  A half-cup of vegetables is not enough for 8 servings; I would add several carrots (sliced), a half pound of sliced mushrooms, and a half pound of fresh green beans.  But it gets points for being super easy to make.  I will make it again with the above changes.

Was good. Would try it again. Personally would add more curry and spices.
