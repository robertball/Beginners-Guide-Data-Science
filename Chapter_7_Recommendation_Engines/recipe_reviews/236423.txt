I used 1\2 cup sour cream and 1\2 cup water instead of yogurt . I added an additional 1\4 sugar and another 2 tablespoons water.  The ginger is a nice addition. I didn't have any yogurt. Using less sour cream and adding water to it reduced the fat content in the sour cream to better mimic the fat content of the yogurt

Don't let the prunes scare you.  I too followed the recipe and only change I might make is to cut the cloves to a 1/4 tsp but that's my own personal preference.  I'll make again .

I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out lovely and made for a delicious snack with my coffee. It was surprisingly not very sweet, but I appreciate that quality in this loaf. Thanks for the recipe.
