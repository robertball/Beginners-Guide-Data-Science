I was working nights for the Christmas holiday and thought I would try this one.  I changed several things about the recipe.  The pomagrantes here didn't look so (going out of season) good so I used juice.  I also put every thing in the crock pot and cooked it on low for 10 hours.  Oh my goodness was it good and tender and my picky family truely enjoyed it.

I made this for a backyard party and everyone loved it.  I usually make my own changes, but this time I did it as written.  What a great flavor for pork!  Not one bite legt, even though I also cooked 15 New York steaks as well!

Okay, so I had a few problems with this. First off, I wasn't too happy with the pomegranate flavor. If you do what the recipe says and do the pomegranate sauce yourself, it is a lot of work for a little bit of flavor. Secondly, I'm not sure if i liked the choice of cut for the pork. Yes, it was VERY tender, but it for me personally, id prefer something boneless and with less fat. Would I make this in the future? yes, probably. But i would probably use boneless pork loin and use pomegranate juice instead.

The first time I made this, it was a hit at the corporate potluck.  Last time, I got good reviews at my family party.  The sauce reminds me of a sweet and spicy (cinnamon) teriyake sauce.

Easy enough and love the flavor of the glaze.  I added a little rosemary to the garlic and seasonings, and mixed it all with a little oil, then cut slits in the roast, packing them with the mixture.  Substituted apple cider vinegar and honey in the glaze.  Smelled great in the oven and tasted great too.

Absolutely loved this dish!  It was wonderful!  Used POM pomegranate juice which makes things a lot less messy.  Was a big hit!

This was pretty good. I think it was the way I cooked it that left it lacking. I cooked it in my crock pot and I used Pomegranate juice cocktail. I should have used straight Pomegranate juice, maybe it would have tasted better. I will try this again to see if I have more success.

I don't normally care for pork, until I tried this recipe.  Cant wait to try it with the pork grilled.   POM pomegranate juice shortens the prep time.  & I used brown sugar.  YUMMY!

Easy, looks great, but for my roast the flavor of the pomegranate did not really sink in very far.  Still tasty, but I whish more of the pomegranate taste got further in the roast.

Well, my pork came out quite tender, but the flavor was odd.  Maybe it's because I can't use cinnamon (allergy), but the pork/pomegranate combo just didn't do it for me.  

I'm going to use the remaining meat in some spicy croquettes or something to try and hide the flavor...

Family LOVED this! Instead of making my own sauce out of fresh pomegranate, I used pomegranate juice (as that was in fridge). I still reduced it with sugar, balsamic vinegar, and cinnamon, but used a a whole teaspoon of cinnamon because we love cinnamon. I braised the pieces of pork shoulder on the stovetop in about a tablespoon of olive oil. Then I coated the pieces with the sauce and cooked them in my pressure cooker for 40 minutes. It came out flavorful and fell apart in tender strips. I would definitely make this again!

OK let's just say I waited until I was 57 to start cooking.  I liked what I read about this recipe, but reading a few reviews there was talk of wishing the pomegranate sauce went deeper into the roast.  First I used 1/2 C POM juice and 1/2 C water - rather than going through the cooking of the pomegranate - I reduced it, but before it hit a glaze consistency, I loaded my turkey injector and shot the roast through with the juice.  I poured some over the roast, then saved the rest - adding it to a brown gravy mix to serve over rice - gravy from scratch is above my pay grade.

There were interesting flavors but you might want to marinade overnight for the spices to penetrate well.

A real family pleaser.  My daughter is pretty picky and doesn't eat too much meat.  I actually seen her go back for 2nds just on the roasted pork.  I will defently make it again some day.

This was okay. I used POM pomegranate juice instead of making it myself. I wanted the sauce to be a little thicker, so next time I will modify it. The different components blended well together and tasted great, but not as strong as I'd have liked. This is a keeper, but I will make adjustments to the recipe for next time.

Exceptional!!! I did use the crock pot as suggested by Sherri's review, and I had pomegranate juice so I used that suggestion too. My honey loves garlic, so I upped that.  I love the sauce, and next time will play with fresh herbs.

DELICIOUS!! & Pork shoulder are the BEST roast (was a meat cutter for yrs). A MUST try! Not a lot of work at all.  Everyone loved it.
