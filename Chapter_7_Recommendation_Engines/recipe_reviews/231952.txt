Since I found this recipe my two boys (19 & 21) hug me so much that I can't finish my dinner. I suppose that is not a bad thing.  When I come home with a big pack of chicken legs, the family knows what's coming.  I marinate for at least 24 hours, turning once, and then bake uncovered in a 350 oven for 2 hours or more.  Note:  I make a double batch so the legs are just about covered.  A few nights ago hubby was really late coming home from work and the legs were happily cooking for two and a half hours.  Oh, my...!  My oldest son couldn't stop saying, "Mom, look, the meat is just falling off the bones!"  Followed by yumm, yummm, yum noises.  Ok, Broomcladdad, that to me is a great compliment.  The last batch I made I tweeked your recipe and added maybe a 1/4 cup more soy sauce and a smidge more brown sugar.  I love sesame seeds but have to leave them out.  Hubby and I have bridges, and I'm not talking about those in Madison County either.
Next month, March 2014 my father-in-law is turning 75.  Guess what my mother-in-law wants me to make for the main course for his birthday dinner?  Job well done!!

This is a great recipe.  I doubled this because I was making a large dinner.  I added 1/4 C molasses (a secret Japanese ingredient) and 2 more Tablespoons of brown sugar (it wasn't quite sweet enough for my taste) totaling 6 Tablespoons as well as a few shakes of crushed red pepper.  I did not double the sesame oil because it is so strong so I substituted olive oil up to 1/4 C total. Again these extra ingredients were doubled!!!  This was delicious...enjoy!

If you are making this recipe to use as a sauce vs using it as a marinade - BEWARE.  It is VERY salty.  I made it as written and it was inedible.  I added more brown sugar, more water and more honey to try to save it.  It was still salty, but edible.  I'll make this again, but with definite changes.

Have been looking for this recipe for a long time.  Used fructose in place of honey, balsamic rice vinegar, a ton more minced garlic, and added a big splash of sherry at the end. Did not add cornstarch or cook it as I have found if you keep basting your food with its own juices along with the marinade while it's baking, the sauce thickens on it's own. Fabulous as it keeps forever! /arnetage68

This is really good.  For us the sesame seeds are not optional.  The fresh ginger is great.   I can see being able to use this for a lot of purposes.  Delish!  (I do use low sodium soy sauce)

This is an amazing recipe. Even better than the store-bought, and much cheaper. I use it for chicken and fish and it's great with both.

Very delicious, full of authentic flavor. I didn't have rice vinegar, so I substituted apple cider vinegar. I also added extra garlic as that's my preference :-) Thank you for the recipe

Exactly what I was looking for!  I'd run out of teriyaki sauce and needed something quick for the pork stir fry I was throwing together.  Saut√©ed chopped carrots, red peppers and celery (about 2c total) in 1T coconut oil.  Added about 12oz slicked leftover pork tenderloin to the skillet, added this teriyaki sauce and covered over medium heat until warmed through.  Served over brown rice.  The whole family loved it!

I used this as a marinade for thinly sliced beef for  a "beef and broccoli stir fry."  It was perfect.  I marinated it for several hours and it didn't overpower the beef flavor.  It had just the right amount of sweetness.

This "Teriyaki Marinade and Sauce" was quite delicious. I wouldn't hesitate to make it again. I made mine with low-sodium gluten-free tamari (instead of regular soy sauce) and left out the brown sugar and cornstarch (since I don't eat them). Thank you broomclandad for sharing your recipe.

Made this marinade for flank steak with a couple of changes.  I added thinly sliced green onions. While the steak was on the grill, I reduced the leftover sauce to spoon over the sliced meat. It was a bit salty for my taste--the soy sauce dominated. Next time I will try doubling the brown sugar and adding some more ginger.

Great basic teriyaki sauce. 

I use low salt soy sauce, use dried minced garlic and ground ginger, and omit the honey,  cornstarch and water. Using the dried ingredients  I can put this together in less than five minutes. Pour it over frozen chicken thighs and it can be grilled in a few hours. Triple the recipe and it fits in a large mason jar, and is enough for several meals.

I was very surprised at how much I loved this stuff. I added extra garlic and I also added a splash of Mirin for fun. I noticed that the extra water was really necessary (I omitted it the first time I made this recipe). I also added some onion/shallot because I love onion/ shallot. I have used this recipe for chicken thighs (yum!) and also for ground beef to make onigiri (super yum!)

I love this recipe - it's simple, quick to make, and delicious. I've used powdered ginger when fresh wasn't available. Also, I've omitted the brown sugar (to reduce sugar in general), and it still tastes great. I use more than 2 garlic cloves. Will add the sherry as suggested by others. Thanks!

I have used this on chicken, beef, deer, vegetables, it is good on everything! Only change I make is using a little less ginger. Not many recipes are perfect without alterations, but this one is.

Good flavor. Great for dipping, as a stir fry sauce or marinade. I had to use dry ginger to save a trip to the grocery store....still turned out good. 
Good on salmon, chicken, pork and even steamed veggies!

I doubled the recipe but may have added a couple more cloves of garlic than what was called for. I used Kikkoman reduced sodium tamari sauce to cut down on the salt. I find rice wine vinegar is not strong enough for me-.when I make dipping sauce, I use Bartenura balsamic vinegar as a kosher substitute for black vinegar, so that is what I subbed for the rice wine vinegar. It gave a more robust flavor to the sauce.  The only thing I'm working on is the corn starch slurry...while it's fine when the sauce is made fresh, once it's in the fridge it can break and get clumpy, so I will experiment with tapioca starch.  Despite the textural issues with cornstarch, this is an excellent recipe-I could eat it with a spoon, it's so good!

Overall, the sauce is great!  I cut the brown sugar and opted to add a bit more honey to sweeten it.  The amount of soy sauce used will make a very strong, salty sauce, so make sure to keep it's usage light.  The sauce served as a great glaze for my beef and broccoli recipe, and it is killer when mixed with rice.  I would also suggest lowering the amount of soy sauce in the recipe to curb the saltiness.

It was okay, but salty as marinade or sauce. Next time I made it, I doubled the brown sugar and diluted the soy sauce half and half with water. Also doubled the ginger and added crushed red pepper. Turned out perfect.

Was alright, too sweet for my taste.  An alright Asian sauce but did not remind me of Teriyaki.

I make this all the time for my family. I put it on chicken or meatballs depending the mood. Very good. I also skip the sesame oil and use olive or avocado. I usually don‚Äôt have fresh ginger so I substitute powered ginger and garlic.

Instead of water, I squeezed one orange and used the juice. I put the sauce on chicken, broccoli, peppers, and carrots right before they finished cooking in the oven, and it was delicious!

I think this is a good recipe with some changes; sub sesame seeds for the oil, 2 Tblsp. The oil is way too potent and use low sodium soy sauce. Otherwise it is a great recipe.

I made this recipe and I have to agree with other cooks this is really very salty. So I readjusted the recipe, my husband didn't like the honey taste so omitted that and increased the brown sugar I also  cut back on the soy sauce by 2 tlbs. It still doesn't taste right. I won't revisit this recipe again. Use caution when making it, just not that good.

Holy moly this was good! I won't give it 5 stars because I changed a couple of things.. I only used 1 and 1/2 T of sesame oil,  omitted the sesame seeds, plus used ginger powder rather than fresh. My whole house smells like sesame oil now, which is kind of a bummer, but the taste is amazing!

It was okay and I think most people would enjoy it. I just found it lacking a kick in flavour area. I really like my food spicy so I am not blaming the recipe I would next time make a few minor adjustments and I think it would be more to my liking. I would try it anyway if you come across it I think as I said most people will find it to their liking.

This was easy to make and tasted good!  The only thing I'd maybe change is using a little less fresh ginger.  I do like ginger, but a bit more subtle is better for me.

Tweaked this by upping the brown sugar to 5 tbls which helps to cut the saltiness. I also added tsp of chili flakes...very nice

Delicious! Everything teriyaki should be: salty, sweet, a little sour, and with delicious bits of garlic and ginger, yum!

I added a bit of rum, which I always do when I use teriyaki as a catfish marinade. Highly recommended!

Very quick and easy to make. Works well with chicken or beef.  My family likes their teriyaki to be thinner. We made it with, and also without the cornstarch and they liked it better without cornstarch.

I made the marinade for skinless chicken thighs. The marinade was applied 5 hours in advance so the flavour had definitely penetrated the meat. However, the  flavour just wasn't authentic. Next time, I would also add some brown sugar and reduce the amount of ginger.

For whatever reason, my sauce was not as tasty as all have reported this recipe to be. I ended up adding additional honey and sugar just so taste wasn't overwhelmed by soy sauce.  I will continue to look for a great sauce.

this was okay.. i'm not sure what i was expecting but i was wanting more.. i didn't have fresh ginger so i subbed some chinese five spice.. i used a little less cornstarch and doubled the garlic.. i agree with Vicky Ferrell Field.. the sauce is very salty.. which would probably better serve as a marinade.. i added this to stir fried veggies.. dont know if i would try this again

Made this marinade as written & it was perfect!  We put it on sirloin cubes & marinated about 24 hours.  Put the meat on skewers & grilled.  Everyone in my cooking club commented on how delicious it was.  I'm saving & making this again.

I halved the recipe to use as a sauce on 4 big pieces of salmon, it was excellent and I will make it again. I made as recipe specified but, instead of soy sauce, I used liquid aminos, which is same as soy sauce but less salty because it comes from soy protein (Bragg brand). Hmm, I may have added a little more honey because I didn't measure exactly.

Worked wonderfully on sauteed vegetables (cabbage, pepper, onion, zucchini and tofu). Prep time was very fast

Used this as a marinade for a London broil.   Used tamari (essentially gluten free soy sauce), and didn't have sesame seeds, but other than those, followed the directions.   Marinated the steak for about 3 1/2 hours,  grilled it,  and it came out very good.

A really good recipe but is too salty.  I tripled the water, doubled the cornstarch, and added some fresh orange juice to sweeten it up and it was the best!  I will be making this all the time...I'm sure!  Thanks for the good start!

added sesame oil, rice vinegar and honey to another teriyaki marinade I have saved in favorites, I only put a splash of each item in it,  maybe 1 tsp of each.

this goes along with Marla or Marina (chef) recipe

Its a good recipe. Didn't have rice vinegar so used white wine vinegar instead and it still came out good. It had almost a smoky sweet taste I really enjoyed on shish kebob from the grill over white rice.

I almost bought a bottled teriyaki sauce. Happy I didn't!! This is a very quick, easy and very tasty sauce :) taste is very strong though, so next time I'll put just a bit less of it on my plate...

First, i mishandled the meal and this sauce was ready before my salmon and shrimp were and freaked out thinking the sauce would get stiff and gelatin like but it held up beautifully.  I even took a small amount and chilled so I could marinate the shrimp while the salmon cooked in oven.  Everything was phenomenal, the only change I made was adding a bit more cornstarch (1/2-1 tsp.) into mixture to thicken more than the recipe amount called.  The one negative was that it came out a bit salty so I will use low sodium soy sauce next time to insure and even better dining experience.

The rice wine vinegar overpowered the sauce even after I all but doubled the sugar and honey. I'll have to keep looking for another recipe.

Used Bragg's Amino due to gluten sensitivity. Used it as a stir fry and found it too salty.  After adding more water and cornstarch, will make again.

Great and easy recipe. Used 1/4 cup soy sauce since I like mine a little sweeter than salty.  I microwaved the sauce at 50% strength for about 4 minutes. Yum!

Did not taste like a Teriyaki sauce at all and was a dark brown colour instead of a nice red.
