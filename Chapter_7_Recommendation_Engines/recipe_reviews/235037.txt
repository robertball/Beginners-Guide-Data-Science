Very good, when I served it to my friends they said there was something different about them.  On the boxed Ghirardelli mix, it called for 1/3 cup water and 1/3 cup oil.  So I just substituted the Kahlua for the water, rather than using only 1/4 cup and only 1/3 cup oil.  Added 1 cup chopped walnuts too.  To Gale who didn't think one should use a mix, not everyone is an experienced cook and brownies are not that easy to make from scratch and turn out right.

I used DH Brownie mix.  That mix calls for 2 eggs.  i debated but went with the one egg this recipe calls for.  The taste and texture were standard, awesome brownie taste.  I expected the Kahlua to really  add something special to the brownies.  Perhaps a mocha taste.  I ddin't see a noticable difference.  The rest of my family didn't either, although there was excitement that there was Kahlua in the brownies.

These are good brownies but they weren't anything special. I couldn't even tell that there was Kahlua in them.

I bought the Ghirardelli box of brownie mix.  It wasn't 20 oz ... it was 18 oz.  I set the oven to 350, as stated in the recipe above.  And, I cooked it exactly as recommended.  The sides were over-cooked when the timer went off.   I took the brownies out immediately, and when they "set up" ... they were as hard as hockey pucks. 

I should have followed the recommendation on the box!   It said an oven temperature of 325 ... not 350.   I had a second box of Ghirardelli, and that's what I did on that batch ... but I made it according to the box, without the Kahlua.  And this batch turned out fabulously.
