After tasting this, I did end up adding a few more spices (dill weed, onion powder, celery salt) but I did not gussy it up too much. I did not add any additional salt after I added the celery salt because cottage cheese does tend to be a little salty. This was surprizingly good. Of course I liked it but I was more surprized that my husband and kids liked it, too. I would make this again. NOTE: I used 4% milkfat cottage cheese.

This was pretty good, but I did have to add some seasonings to it----seasoned salt, garlic powder, more pepper.  Celery salt or some fresh dill or other fresh herbs would have added more flavor, too.  I couldn't make it creamier, but that is because of the cottage cheese I used perhaps.  It is definitely worth making, but be aware that it needs more flavor.  I did like the idea of this recipe!  Thanks, Jenn!
