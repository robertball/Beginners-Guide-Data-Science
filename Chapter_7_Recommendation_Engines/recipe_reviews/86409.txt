This went from a 4-star recipe cooked as written using a whole chicken to 5 stars when I doubled the sauce recipe and mixed it a plastic bag, then shook up a whole, cut-up chicken in it, and baked it for about an hour (I used parchment paper on the baking tray and poured the remaining sauce over the chicken). Outstanding flavor, and everyone loved it, even my picky husband. It's one of my staple recipes now.

This was a great change from the standard roast chicken.  I did make a few substitutions-- I used chinese 5 spice blend in place of the spices, sesame oil in place of the veg. oil, and used Mirin in place of the sherry.  I also only cooked it to 160F (it would have been toast if we'd gone to 180F).  The adults and my 3 year old loved it.  My five year old complained that it didn't taste like chicken, LOL!

This recipe was very dissapointing for both my husband and myself. The flavor was strange and not at all what I expected. So, I will not be making this again.

I liked the basic concept of this recipe. The ingredients that  were involved were simple. I did however adlib some of my own ingredients. I used sesame instead of fennel. I used tangerine juice in the sauce and the squeezed tangerines in the cavity of the chicken and I roasted breast side down for a juicier white meat. Overall though I think that it was a delicious outcome.

Pretty good. I used real ginger and threw it in the cavity instead of powdered. If you don't like 5 spice anything don't make this.

The flavor is definitely a welcome change from other roasted chicken recipes, although I did notice that more of the sauce would have made a big improvement.  Also, I had pulled a leg off the chicken to test for doneness and just laid it in the pan while it all finished roasting.  That piece was the best of all because it had soaked up the sauce and was very flavorful.  The next time I make this I will use chicken pieces instead of a whole chicken and use more of the soy sauce mixture.

I made this with a couple of Cornish hens. I wanted as much flavor as possible so I injected marinade under the skin, and let it sit in the fridge all day. Turned out great. I served it with 'Bok Choy, Carrots and Green Beans' from this site. Good stuff. Thanks!

May as well have put nothing on the chicken for as little flavor as the sauce added to the meat.  I have better luck basting with just soy sauce and butter.

Not sure if I would try this one again.  We marinaded in for 1 hr at room temp, turning if often.  I didn't have the fennel seed, so maybe that would have made the differeence.  It smelled GREAT when it was cooking, but after we pealed the skin off, the meat didn't have any flavor....I guess this is a common issue.  Maybe we should have injected some of the marinade.  We cooked a 3.8 lb bird for 90 minutes and it was cooked perfectly.

This was good, but a couple of changes. I would marinate the chicken at least 2 hours or more in the fridge before cooking. There was not much flavor to the meat just be basting. Also, for a 4 lb chicken, check often with a meat thermometer as cooking time made it slightly dry. Smells wonderful while cooking though... All in all, a good recipe.

I made a few changes. I omitted fennel & cloves & sherry.  I used Aloha Soyu & Sesame Oil.  I also used fresh finger.  I put all the spices in the cavity of the chicken.  I rubbed the chicken inside & out with coarse Hawaiian sea salt.  I cooked the chicken breast side down in a cast iron Dutch oven
It was delicious.
I am 66 & have been cooking since I was about 10 so always make changes to recipes based on past experience.  This is a good basic recipe.  Just learn to trust your instincts.
It just takes practice; like anything else.

Double the sauce, baste every 1/2 hour. Follow the cooking directions on the chicken itself. Def will make again. It was very delicious!

Definitely double the sauce and I found that if you add some water to the sauce and boil it to make a gravy, it would be even better.

Omitted the sherry and fennel seed, (didn't have any.) And cooked as directed, except that I tied the legs together and covered the wings after about an hour to prevent burning. Baked for about 2 hours. This was juicy and delicious.

I gave it four stars because I knew by the comments that I would need to make adjustments. I substituted veg oil for sesame oil and I also tripled the ingredients. I decided to cut my chicken and marinated in a ziploc bag for an hour and then added orange zest and squeezed the orange on the chicken. My husband and kiddos loved it so it will definitely be in rotation.

Disappointing , this is such a simple recipe, yet it lacks any flavor. You could just as well cover the chicken with soy sauce and garlic and you’d get a better chicken. Flavors are weak and just plain, oh and it doesn’t turn out like the pictures

This was a great change from the normal roast chicken that I have. With it as a side I had smoked Gouda Mac and cheese(also on allrecipes) and they went together great. Loved this recipe.
