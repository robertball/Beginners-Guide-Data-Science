I made this for my family. I put graham cracker crust instead. It was super easy. 
Just a hint for warming up the cream cheese to make it soft to work with .Take the cream cheese out of the boxes leave the foil on and put in hot water for about 10 minutes. Make sure the foil is sealed. It warms it up then you don't have to wait to get to room temperature it is done in a matter of minutes. I do the same with eggs as well.  I leave the eggs in the shell in warm water for about 10 minutes and it does the job.
I will keep this recipe for sure.

Pretty good cheesecake recipe. My usual recipe uses more cream cheese so I used this one. I used a graham crust in a springform pan. I always bake my cheesecakes for like 15 minutes at 450 then reduce the oven temp to 250-275 and bake for like another 45min. Then I turn the oven off and let it cool in there for an hour or so. Then place in frige overnight. This way there is no crack and it will be perfectly creamy, no water bath needed!! If I make this again I'd probably add a tablespoon of lemon juice.

I've tried this now 2 times.  Both times I did not use the crust.  I used the SplendaBlend (half sugar-half Splenda) and low fat sour cream and low fat cream cheese.  I bake it in a 9" nonstick round metal cake pan that I liberally spray with Butter Flavored Pam.  First time it cracked, second time it didn't. I don't mind the cracking though because I like the rustic look.  (Doesn't look machine made to me)
I baked at 325 for 70 minutes.  It come out to about 135 calories per serving if the cake is cut in 12's.  So Rich that is all I need!  I'm thinking about serving it with berries today for color.  I really enjoy this recipe. Thanks!

DO NOT ADD LEMON JUICE!

It will destroy your cheesecake. The thirteen people who rated the review that suggested that as helpful obviously did not follow the suggestion of adding lemon juice. It will react badly with the sour cream and the end result will be a mushy, dense, flat, and acidic desert that is not entirely unlike cheesecake.

I was very determined to find a cheesecake recipe that had only 1 cup of sour cream since that was all I had on hand. I was a little skeptical about this but gave it a go anyway. Oh.my.goodness.!! It was velvety smooth, creamy with the perfect amount of sweetness and a hint of vanilla. The shortbread cookie crust is a great idea, it set the cake off nicely.  For those of you who are having problems with cracking, bring your cream cheese, eggs and sour cream to room temp. The cream cheese must be perfectly soft; if you're pressed for time soak the packages in warm water and squish flat until warmed through. Mix the batter as little as possible-just until everything is blended. I've made this twice now and it's perfect. Quick, easy and simply delicious!

This is the BEST cheesecake I've ever had.  And it is especially awesome since I made it with all fat-free dairy, 2 egg whites, and Splenda!  Awesome!  I made this into 4 "mini" cheesecakes without crusts, so it only cooked for about 50 minutes.  I keep different fruits cut up in the fridge for a different topping every day.  Thank you for my new fave!

I made this for easter, it went over very well! I made my own crust with graham cracker crumbs (I didn't have a shortbread crust on hand, I'm sure that would be even better) and used low fat cream cheese (that neufetchetel sp stuff) and low fat sour cream, and it was still great! I decorated the top with strawberries and blueberries and my dessert was first to fly off the table (even before the double chocolate oreo cookie pie!) Nice and light after a big meal.

Wonderful - better than a restuarant! I made it for a special occation and it was perfect. Although I did make it with a biscuit base, the cheesecake was rich but not too sweet.
I cooked it in a waterbath for the time stated and it didn't crack or burn. 
Recommended with pleasure - Heaven!

Very easy to make, but does tend to crack, so if you are serving it for a dinner party, use a topping.

I only had only a few hours before a dinner at our house to come up with something yummy for dessert, & this was the PERFECT recipe!!  Picked up the 2 packages of cream cheese, & a pre-ready made graham crust at the store.  Put the cream cheese out on the counter for a few minutes, then creamed all the ingrediants together.  Poured over the crust, put the pre-ready crust tin in the oven, & it was done in 55 minutes!  No using a sppring pan, and the curst tasted just as good as the homemade ones I have done before.  Beautiful and SO yummy!  Sprinkled red rasberries and drizzled chocolate sauce over it.  Guests raved about it, and none was left!  This is a definite SAVE recipe that is SO super easy!!!!!

Cheesecake is my favorite dessert so with that being said I know a good cheesecake and this is really good cheescake . I have my go to cheescake recipe which is similiar with the ingredients just involves more bars of cc.  The reason I made this is bc I needed to bring something to a family dinner but didnt want to waist a whole cheesecake that wasnt gonna be all mine to enjoy lol. Since I had 4 bars of cc I thought great I can make 2 one for me and one to bring to the dinner which is exactly what I did!  The only thing I added was a TBLSP of cornstarch (tablespoon) to make it thicker and creamier bc I was worried that 2 bars would result in a skimpy cheescake and it came out perfect and wonderful you can even do 3/4 cup sugar  with this recipe and it would still be delicious bc my recipe involves more bars and 3/4 cup sugar and its perfectly sweet enough. For those who said it was eggy??? Im confused if you look at other cheescake recipes you will notice that for each bar of cc is an equal amount of egg added to it so there is no reason for it to taste eggy at all and mine didnt mine was perfectly sweet creamy and thick the way cheesecake should be so try it and I promise you wont be dissapointed.  I also used water bath on bottom shelf  my cheesecakec was on middle rack and water bath was directly underneath on bottom rack no cracks whatsoever. In my oppinion 60 min is perfect 70 will be over done mine cooked in 60 Im glad I put my timer for 60 min bc it was fully cooked.

This used to be the Philadelphia recipe! Years ago it was on the inside of the box, with graham cracker crust instead of shortbread though. It's my all time favorite. thanks for posting :)

I always try to make recipes a little healthier.  That being said, I used low fat cream cheese, fat free sour cream and splenda instead of sugar.  It was rich, creamy and absolutely delicious.

My boyfriend and I both thought that the sour cream left an after taste. We both threw away our slice and I tossed the pie. I followed the recipe exactly. Not sure what happened...

Recipe is great, but way too much vanilla if you are using any type of topping. Half it to one teaspoon if you are :) Otherwise, perfection! I always like the flavor of a dense cheesecake, but hated how thick and dry they were. This will give you that flavor with creaminess!  Cooked for 15 minutes at 400, then 45 minute at 250. Cracked the door to the over for an hour, and then left in the oven overnight to cool, (approximately 8 hours,) and then refrigerated, YUMMY!

Fast easy to make cheescake.  Used homemade grahem cracker crust in a 9in springform pan, bottom only, no sides. Prebaked crust for 10 min, while mixing up filling.  used about 1 1-2 sour cream(to finish off the container)  and no lemon juice (didn't have any).  Baked for 50-60 minutes, turned off oven, let sit for 30 min  (door closed).  Took out ran knife around edge and put in fridge to cool.  No cracks Tasted pretty darn good.

Just a hint to those who've ever had their Cheesecake crack:
Place a cake pan, half filled with boiled water in bottom of oven while cheesecake bakes. I helps keep the oven moist & cheesecake is less likely to crack!

Good luck & Have a Happy Holiday!

I have made this several times since saving the recipe and i must say...DELICIOUS! I don't know how many times i say that while eating it. Not only can i not get enough but my family can't either. They request it for all occasions(im the betty crocker of the fam) and also making a couple for my mom's school. That's how good. I do put a little more vanilla and a little less sour cream. Not by much though :) Thanks for the best cheesecake ever!

This is the best cheesecake!  It was creamy and light.  Not too thick like other cheesecakes.  I used regular cream cheese, light sour cream, and 3/4 cups of sugar (because those were the ingredients I had on hand).

I served it with whipped cream and strawberries.  We LOVED it!

I usually seperate out 2 tbsp of sour cream and melt it with milk chocolate chips, then stir it in with the rest of the filling.  Makes the absolute best chocolate cheesecake, especially in an oreo crust!

Love this recipe! Turned out great. I only had 3/4 cup of sour cream so I subbed in some vanilla yogurt to make up the difference and it was fantastic! I topped it with a homemade blueberry sauce and it was half gone before it even cooled! Will be using this as my staple cheesecake recipe.

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious.  The first time I used an 8 inch pie pan and the next time I used my spring form pan.  It was really thick in the smaller pan and thin in the spring form pan.  I preferred the thicker cheesecake.  I made my own graham cracker crust and put cherry pie filling on top.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe SBDEVENEY.

I used this recipe for cheesecake bites topped with homemade lemon curd and fresh raspberries. Very simple. Just baked the mix in muffin cups then topped with curd and berries and refrigerated. Delicious.

This was my first time making cheesecake, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how this recipe turned out. I spent a lot of time reading the reviews and didn't see that anyone had used greek yogurt instead of sour cream, but I opted for it anyways, and it was great! I cooked it for 80 minutes at 325 degrees because I put it in a roasting pan with water so it wouldn't crack, and it didn't. I also added a teaspoon of lemon juice. The texture is lighter than some of the richer cheesecakes I've tried so I didn't feel as guilty eating it! Next time I will make with lowfat cream cheese.

I also wanted to mention that I didn't have a springform pan, and baked it in a non-stick cake pan instead, and it was fine. I was just making it for me and the husband, but it came out of the pan fine.

Delicious and simple! I couldn't find a shortbread crust, so I mixed up some snickerdoodle cookie dough and made a crust from that.

I've made this recipe numerous times in the last year, and it's always been a big hit. I add two tablespoons of good rum instead of the vanilla as a nice variation.  To make it quickly, bake it up in foil muffin cups with a Nilla wafer on the bottom as a crust. They only take about 20 minutes to bake that way.   When I cook a whole cheesecake, I make a graham cracker crust and put some jam on top while it's still hot to make a glaze.   In either form, it gets rave reviews! I've never used a water bath, though I do bring the ingredients up to room temp. It sometimes cracks, but I couldn't care less. It tastes the same either way!

Great recipe. Here's another version. Mix at least 1 cup sour cream, 1 tsp vanilla, and a tsp or 2 of sugar. Mix well. Take the cheesecake out of the oven at 55 minutes.  Pour sour cream mixture on top and  Bake 15 more minutes.

This easy & quick to put together cheese pie is a keeper! Made as stated but I did add a sprinkle of cinnimon to the mixture. It made too much to fit in one pie pan so I baked 2 ramikins too. I used a graham crust and added blueberry pie filling on top when served. I love to make cheese cakes but my kitchen is very small so my springform pan is packed away. This is much better then the fluffy pies I make. More like cheese cake. Will make this agin! Company worthy.

Made this cheesecake yesterday. Used gluten free grahams with butter to make the crust. Followed the recipe and baking instructions just as written except for a little lemon zest into the batter.  It is wonderful. Baked perfectly-no cracks, light and delicious.  Made blueberry topping from frozen blueberries. I ate mine plain.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I make this recipe without a crust and substituting a sweetener for the white suger to make it a low carb treat.  It has become my "go to" recipe.  I have made it many times now. I like it with a dollop of no sugar added jam on top.  I have found that the longer you beat the cream cheese and egg mixture, the fluffier it will be when baked.  It really is a great base to experiment with add ins as well - try peanut butter and/or chocolate chips.  yum!   It is a perfectly simple and very tasty recipe!

This was the first time I made cheesecake and it was a hit!  I combed through my pantry and combined shortbread and graham crackers to make the crust from scratch.  Since I only had 8 ozs of cream cheese, I adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly (1/2 of sugar, eggs, vanilla, and sour cream.  The result was a lighter cheesecake.  For the topping, I warmed up frozen mixed berries on the saucepan and did not add sugar and then spooned on top of the cheesecake.  Will definitely follow the recipe next time and will probably come out with a richer cheesecake.  Never knew making cheesecake was easy and will never buy a store bought one again.

Excellent!! I followed this recipe to the T. I left the cream cheese on the counter to soften to room temperature. It baked perfectly in 56 minutes without a single crack. I let it cool on a rack on the counter for about 3 hours, covered it and left it to chill in the refrigerator for 24 hours. It came out excellent and tasted better than some store bought cheesecakes. It was smooth and delicious. I also made a caramel sauce to drizzle over the slices. It was a huge hit and I will definately be making this again. This recipe is a must!

I had to use up some sour cream and cream cheese before it went bad in my frig and I found this recipe. I didn't have a cheesecake pan so I had to use two pie pans. The batter was too much for one pie pan. I made a homemade graham cracker crust  because I didn't have the shortbread. The cheesecake was alright. I thought it would be better with all these good reviews. I will just stick with an original new york style cheesecake next time.

This is sooo good.  I baked it at 425 for 15 minutes as suggested, then turned the oven down to 275 for another 45 minutes - perfection!  I also added a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and used graham cracker crust.  Delicious plain but next time I will add a fruit topping. Really easy and very good!

Extremely delicious and easy!  Mine took a little bit longer to cook (around 80 min.), but I'm also at a high altitude, and used a water bath, so I'm sure that's why.  Because of the water bath, I had absolutely no cracking.  Very creamy recipe.  I made as instructed, and am very excited to make another with a fruit topping!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I've tried this cheesecake 2 times and I love it since it's very easy to make and it tastes great! The first time I made the crust and the seconde time I used a pre-maid crust and the cheesecake is very adaptable to both types of crust. The only thing is that both times the cheesecake craked but for me it's not that important.

I made a graham cracker crust since I didn't have the ingredients for the shortbread crust. I otherwise followed the recipe to the "T".  It wasn't creamy like other cheesecakes I've made. It was a bit gummy so I'll not use this recipe again.

This turned out great.  The sour cream makes it creamier and not as firm as other cheesecakes.  I made my own graham cracker crust and I added juice of one lime along with 1 teaspoon of lime zest.  I prefer a citrus flavored cheesecake.  I also topped it with a homemade strawberry sauce. I also used a bath and it didn't crack.  My wife and daughter just ate cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory, and they both said this one was better.

This is my go-to cheesecake receipe.  The ingredients are readily available, and it is so easy to mix and bake.  Unlike one reviewer, I add either lemon or lime juice as wanted with no adverse effect on the texture or taste.  This really is a great base for many cheesecake variations.

I've been cooking a long, long time but this was my first attempt at cheesecake.  My husband requested one for Easter. I picked this recipe simply because it called for the amount of cream cheese I happened to have. I made a graham cracker crust but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  It turned out perfect and was embarrassingly easy to make. I'll use this one over and over.

I made this for Christmas dinner today. It was wonderfully delicious! I creamed the cream cheese and sugar for a long time in my standing mixer (about 5 min on med/high speed). It made it very light and fluffy. I thought perfect. I seemed to have an abundance left over after filling the pie shell, so not sure if that was from creaming it so long or what but I could almost have made two wonderful pies, in fact I could have had I not overfilled the first one a little. I cooked it for 70 min. It did crack a little, but it was toasty brown on top and cooled and settled beautifully. I was impressed with my first attempt a cheesecake. It was a hit and so yummy!! Thanks for the recipe. I will make two next time out of this recipe and maybe try the graham cracker crust with one.

I loved how easy this recipe was!!! I used a graham crust, since its what I had, and I added a handful of blueberries to one, and some york peppermint patty to the other. They were a hit. Because I used a shallow dish, I ended up getting 2 pies of of the recipe!!! Everyone who tried it, loved it!!!!! It is a recipe I will use again and again!!!

This is a delicious cheesecake! Easy to tweak the recipe in order to make unique flavors. I added mini chocolate chips throughout the filling and put it in an oreo crust. Yum!

This has the same ingredients as my great grandmothers recipe but a lot less complex to cook.  Thought I would try it for my birthday because my son wanted to make cheesecake for me.  Should have stuck with my grandmothers. This was to eggy and not creamy, although it did have a decent taste.  Wont make it again.

I have used this recipe several times no changes to the ingredients. Making two today for some friends didn't have vanilla extract so I substitute it for lemon extract still came out good.

Wow, this was easy.  I wasn't concerned with cracking, as it typically doesn't take away from the taste so I beat the living daylights out of the cream cheese, eggs and sour cream.  

I did grease the sides of my pan, placed a cake pan full of boiling water on the other rack in the oven, and made a tinfoil tent over the cake itself. (I didn't want that chewy film you can sometimes get...thought the tinfoil would help)

Not only did it not crack, but it tasted AMAZING! Tip: Do let it sit overnight in the fridge. I tried a piece a couple hours after cooling and wasn't over the moon - This morning (Hey, don't judge, if there's cheesecake in the fridge it's just as much a breakfast dish as it is a dessert) the cake was SUPERB! 

I didn't use the crust recipe - I mixed a cup of chocolate crumbs with crushed walnuts and butter. Yummy!

Creamy, smooth and impressive! Will be making this one a lot! 

I also liked that it only used 2 packages of cream cheese - That stuff is starting to resemble the price of gold per ounce! ; )

This is delicious. Very light. I only had 1/2 of an 8 ounce pkg of cream cheese and another full 8 ounce pkg. I reduced the ingredients by half and it came out perfect. I used an already prepared graham cracker crust. We tried it while it was still warm. Yum!!!

I just made this cheesecake last night. What an excellent flavor!  The sour cream gave it a nice tang.  The texture was smooth and creamy, not at all like a traditional NY style cheesecake.  I thought it baked up very firm but was disappointed that it cracked a great deal while baking. It also fell about a half inch as it cooled.   I tried it topped with blackberry syrup, yummy!

Not your normal dense cheescake. You could eat more than one piece without feeling too full. Nice and light. Make sure it is completely cool before you eat it. I cut it too close to serving time and it was a little warm still. It was a lot better later after it was in the refrig for a couple of hours.

I made this recipe twice with great results. The first time I used low-fat sour cream, no lemon juice and used the water bath cooking method. The result was great tasting with no cracks but it wasn't "quite" set completely. I think the lemon juice would have done the trick. Second time I used regular sour cream, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and the modified heat cooking method and got great results without a crack also. Either way, it's got our vote!

I usually use Chantal's New York Cheesecake from this site, but only had two tubs of cream cheese and very little time so I made this one. Simple and easy. My husband loved it so I'll make this again for sure.
I baked this in a 9 inch pie pan and just pressed ground up shortbread cookies with melted butter into the pan and then poured the filling in. 60 minutes later it was golden brown with a few cracks, but topped it with raspberry sauce and it was delicious.
Recommend if needing a quick cheesecake.

This is a delicious, rich-tasting cheesecake! I used the shortbread crust recipe found on allrecipes.com and sprinkled chocolate chips in top of the crust before pouring in. I also added white chocolate syrup (used for coffee flavoring) to the cheesecake and whalah! The cake was devoured by family in less than 12 hours! I plan on making this one for the holidays! Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

This was a super cheesecake! My husband and I are on the "Somersize" diet so I made this without the crust and with splenda sugar. It tasted so good we don't miss having sugar and white flour loaded cakes and treats anymore.

Made this exactly as written.  It came out light, smooth, and yummy. 

Instead of prepared shortbread crust, I used the shortbread crust recipe from allrecipes PHILLY Bavarian Apple Torte Recipe (allrecipes.com/recipe/179674/philly-bavarian-apple-torte/). Easier than going to the store! Just 1/2 cup softened butter, 1/3 cup sugar and 1 cup flour, mix and press into the bottom of a springform pan.

Thanks for the yummy, easy cheese cake recipe! This one is a keeper!

I wanted to try this recipe when I saw how easy it was, but I have to watch my sugar intake. I omitted the sugar and replaced it with 1/4 cup stevia and 1/4 cup erythritol. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. It's even better the next day. That is if it lasts that long. I've made it at least a half dozen times and have never had any problem with cracking. Always taste great.

Doesn't get much easier than this. I made a low fat version with reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream. Also crustless since my wife is gluten free. Cooked for 65 minutes and no cracking since I placed a 9x13 dish of water on the bottom rack. Since I made it for July 4th I decorated it with fresh strawberries around the outside and fresh blueberries in the center

We did not realize how much we enjoyed it until we purchased a deli cheesecake and in comparison this one was so much better!

This is my go to cheese cake recipe... I've tried others and keep coming back to this one! I've use store bought crust and homemade, turns out great either way. I also cut back on the sugar for personal preference,we just prefer things on the less sweet side and it better for us. I always make sure my cream cheese is really soft and whip so there are no chunks and a water bath would alleviate the cracking for those who are having issues. Also, over whipping causes cracking as well!

This is my new favorite basic cheesecake recipe!  I made it exactly to the recipe.  I made my own graham cracker crust and used a 9" springform pan.  Husband loves cheesecake, so I do make them often, topping with cherry pie filling.  So delicious, and so easy!!

Delicious! I used a Graham cracker crust, the neufaundel cheese (or whatever it's called) with 1/3 less fat, and a sprinkle of lemon zest. Couldn't stop sneaking bites.

This is an awesome recipe. I never thought I would be able to make a cheese cake this good. The only thing I would add is that it is almost a must that your cream cheese is at room temperature. If you fail to leave it out long enough, put it in the microwave for 45 sec to 1 minute. Of course take it out of the foil packaging first. Oh, and it does crack, but I don't mind because I always top it with fruit. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good. I added a tsp or so of lemon juice b/c it was a bit sweet for me. Didn't use a crust (didn't have one) and halved the recipe. Turned out great!

because of product shrinkage, it was too  much filling for one pie crust! will try splitting it between 2 pie crusts next time.

This was THE BEST cheesecake I ever had! I think I will be making all my cheesecakes with this recipe. It came out so perfect looking no cracks or anything! I half the sugar since I didn't want it too sweet. This is such a wonderful recipe! I would recommend it to anyone.

Delicious and indeed very easy!  I used a graham cracker crust.  I also used two vanilla beans and just a tiny splash of vanilla extract in lieu of the two teaspoons the recipe calls for, and it turned out wonderfully with the black specks and all.  I made the mistake of not letting it cool in the oven, so it sank, but it still tastes great.  Thank you for the recipe!  Will definitely use this one again.

It was super easy and very delicious. Did reserve 1/3 of batter and added some melted chocolate, and for the rest added a little bit of marmalade, and then added the chocolate batter in spoonfulls for taste variance. Will deffinately do again as a basic recipe, with diff. flavors added.

I have made this many times. I very much prefer this cheesecake to the classic New York style. This is not as dense or sweet as a typical cheesecake. Not sure why everyone is so concerned about the cracking. Dump a can of strawberry pie filling on top and it is gorgeous and delicious!

Could someone tell me if the reason this tastes more custardy is maybe because of the sour cream that's in it?  I wasn't thrilled with it this way but it was easy and my family liked it. Thanks for sharing.

I made this cheesecake last night after I ended up with some unused cream cheese. I ended up using 3 8oz packages of cheese (only because I wanted to use it up) and 3 eggs. I baked it in a water bath. It looked beautiful, slightly browned on the top and no cracks. I made a buttered rum sauce that accompanied it wonderfully. Will absolutely make this again!

This recipe was wonderful!  I made a lower calorie version of this using 1 pkg of non-fat cream cheese and 1 pkg of 1/3 fat cream cheese.  Then I substituted Splenda for 1/2 of the sugar.  I'll definitely make this again.

The taste of the Cheesecake was great, unfortenatly living in Australia I was unable to get Graham Crackers for a crust and the biscuts I used did not bind well with the butter, the crust crumbled at touch, did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust which helped with the taste.  Everyone who ate it gave rave reviews said it was awesome.  I will be using this as my go to cheesecake recipe in the future.

Great recipe! I made this recipe just like the directions. When cooled, I topped with fresh blueberries that had been lightly simmered in a mixture of sugar, cornstarch, and water. My husband said to save the recipe, it was the best I had made.

I've made this recipe for my husband several times and it never lasts longer than a day!  Maybe my shortbread crust tins are small, but it produces about a cup more filling than needed.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect!

The flavor was perfect, but it seemed dry. I don't know if I baked it too long? It did crack on the top, maybe I'll use a water bath next time. I'm going to try it again sometime and I'll post another review. I did it without a crust but I may do the shortbread crust with chocolate chips on it, sounds good!

Now this is what cheesecake is supposed to taste like!  This was awesome!  I used a 9 inch graham cracker crust but there was a tad too much batter for the crust.  I cooked it in a water bath for 80 minutes and it came out flawless.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Awesome cheesecake!! I made this for my fiance for Valentine's Day and he LOVED it. He ate most of it by himself before I could get my hands on it. I don't really care for cheesecake because it is too heavy, but this one was perfect! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a super recipe that is extremely easy to prepare.  I omitted the shortbread pie crust (since I didn't have one on hand)and used a prepared graham cracker crust instead.  I used lowfat cream cheese, and regular sour cream.  I also topped my cheesecake w/strawberry pie filling/topping.  My husband (ever the discerning food snob) loved it!!!  Thanks for a great cheesecake recipe!

THIS IS SOOOO GOOD! My first cheesecake. It was so so easy. I made my own graham crust, which tastes much better homemade! And used a spring form pan, which made the cake come out beautiful. I made a strawberry topping for it...but the cake is so good, I prefer it just by itself! The sour cream REALLY makes this lighter and less rich than most cheesecakes...my family loved it so much, it's not gone yet and they are already making sure I will make it again soon. :)

This was a very good and simple cheesecake to make. My only complaint although rather insignificant was that the cheesecake cracked. I made it for myself though so I guess it didnt matter. Lol Overall Good.

The first time I made this I plopped a can of strawberry pie filling on top of this and brought it to dinner at my parents. The four of us ate the whole darn thing. It was excellent! Now I have to make one for all family functions. Thanks!

Great recipe! I used a pre-made (store bought)cookie crust. The batter makes more than enough for 2 of these. Would make again.

Great cheesecake! It blended nice and smooth, tasted awsome, and didn't crack!!  I did have to cook it for about five minutes more, but it wasn't much.  Goes really well with Caramel ice cream topping.

I usually make massive deluxe cheesecakes... I wanted something simple for my husband and I for New Years. This was perfect! I put it in a graham cracker crust instead, it was delish. So fast and easy! Thank you!

So, I couldn't help but notice that in a lot of the pictures, the cheesecake had sunk and cracked. At around 50minutes into bake time, I turned off the oven and cracked the door to let it finish. It gradually falls in temperature, rather than just pulling it out of the oven and shocking the cake. The result is no cracking or sinking. Hope this helps! Also marbled in some raspberry preserves after mixing all of the ingredients together for more flavor. Other than that, solid recipe!

Added sweetened coconut to crust and less sugar to filling... super delicious!  I’ll add more eggs next time, probably up to 4-6 for volume and fluff. Cooked at 450 for 15 with water bath on convection and about 20-30.  Will watch closer next time.  No cracks ??

This cheesecake is delicious. I lower the temp to 300 and bake a little longer than the recipe calls for.   I like to add chocolate chips . Always a huge hit.

Disclaimer:  This is one of those "I didn't follow the recipe at all and it turned out great!" reviews.
I've tried to make a non-dairy cheesecake with goat chevre before (basic cheese, eggs, sugar, vanilla). It was okay, but heavy and not that creamy. Tried again today and started with this recipe as my guide. I substituted the sour cream with 2T mayo and goat yogurt. I used the 16oz Costco size cinnamon and cranberry goat cheese. Also used a crumb crust. The results were pretty darn good!

Delicious! Light & creamy! Everyone in my family enjoyed it! I changed nothing in the recipe. The only thing I did that's not in the directions is, I cooked it for 60 mins, turned the oven off, & left the oven door cracked for 45 minutes & then left out on the counter for an hour before refrigerating.  In never collapsed & it looked perfect! This will be my new "go to" recipe when I need to make a cheesecake!

I followed the directions to a T, and ended up with a short not great cheesecake. The taste was more ooey gooey butter cake while consistency was more like something that separated in the time it took to get into the cheesecake pan, leveled with a shake and into oven. Even a lil watery and like cottage cheese even though I mixed it plenty.

Will say it was super easy and not horrible. Wouldn't make it again tho!

Made this for Resurrection Sunday. Everyone loved it. I used a scratch Graham cracker crust instead of shortbread.
Easy to make! Be sure to let all ingredients come to room temp first. It makes the combining process easier and leads to a better texture. Let your cake cool in the oven to prevent cracks!

Someone made the suggestion to make it in paper cupcake liners. I though it was a great way to do portion control. Then to cut back on fat and calories, I made it without crust. I didn't bake it long enough, only 35 min. It was the first time I made any kind of cheesecake. I may have beaten the ingredients to long, it was very fluffy. Anyway after I took it out of the oven they all fell, so the centers caved in. It tasted good, but slightly under baked. I think it was a bit on the tangy side, so if I make it again I would either cut back on the sour cream a bit, or add just a little more sugar. But overall it was tasty.

I will make this again. I made the recipe exactly as was written. I took it to a Christmas party and came home with an empty plate. I took No Sugar Added cherry pie filling for the topper. It was good with and without.

Made this as directed but I think it's just a taste preference. I like cheesecake thick and creamy but this was lighter, kind of like a box mix cheesecake. A lot of people like this so give it a try but I'd prefer to make the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake on this site. Also looking forward to trying Chantel's cheesecake recipe.

I like the simplicity and ease of the recipe.  I bought pre-made mini crusts to make individual cheese cakes, topped with a dollap of cool whip, sliced strawberries and blue berries.  They went over well!

Cut the temp back a bit and extended the bake time by allowing it to cool in the oven... less prone to cracking.

I used a graham cracker pie crust as I did not understand what a shortbread crust was. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The cheesecake had great texture and taste. I will make it again. Also the recipe was easy to follow.

I made a Banana Cream Cheesecake with this recipe. I added one package of Banana Cream pudding to the batter. It ended up being less "Rich", which is why I never liked cheesecake before now.

Delicious and very easy to make. I followed exactly except I used a prepared 10 inch deep dish Graham crust, and lite sour cream. Make sure all ingredients are room temp and mix thoroughly. Oven temp was just right. Thanks for the recipe

I made a coconut pecan crust instead. I made the recipe for 72 servings prested the crust into the bottom of a cup cake liner then baked it regular cupcakes a tin of 12 takes 20 min to bake. Mini cup cakes take 10 min to make 12-24 mini cheese cakes. I put a berry on top of each one.

I love this basic cheesecake recipe! I did cut back on the sugar to a 1/3 c because I like my desserts just sweet enough. I also baked using the water-bath method to ensure it stays creamy and doesn't develop that brownness on top and added chopped strawberries, and a blueberry swirl on top. And I skipped the crust. turned out great!

I made this! And everyone loved it. A few things though, bake in a water bath to keep from cracking. I also used powdered sugar instead of straight table sugar. (It has corn starch in it). Definitely agree that dairy should be pulled ahead of time  and lastly,  gently fold in your sour cream at the end versus beating or mixing in vigorously.  Oh and it works great with either a graham cracker or shortbread crust. Thank you and enjoy, we did!

I looked up this recipe because I only had one cup of sour cream and didn't have the ingredients for a different recipe. I also only had graham cracker crust instead of the shortbread. This was super easy and I served it the next day with no topping and loved it!! I disagree with the other reviewers about the lemon-- I don't think it's necessary. Next time I will add cherries on top.

This was my first cheesecake, so I wanted something easy. This was easy, and went over very well with my "focus group" (my coworkers). 

I made a few changes: replacing the sugar with Splenda, and a premade Oreo crust. Keeping things simple, I added strawberry pie filling on the side. I'm already getting requests for another

This is a great basic recipe to build on. My second time, I swirled the strawberry sauce in the cheesecake. 

The latest version, I adjusted by using about 2/3 (eyeballed it, trying for 1/2) of the cheesecake filling, covered with a layer of walnuts. Using the remaining 1/3, I added some Hershey's cocoa powder, and poured that on top of the walnuts. After baking & allowing time to cool, I finished with some freshly made chocolate whipped cream, and sprinkled chocolate chips on top

Best cheesecake I ever made!  Creamy and flavorful. I added a small dish of water to the oven to prevent cracking, however I overfilled the pie shell which caused it to crack at the edges.  This recipe is a keeper!  I will be making this delicious cake again and again.

I did not care for this. It was like expecting to bite into cheesecake but getting ricotta pie instead. There was way to much for one pie shell. WAY TO MUCH! I attempted to use 2/3's of it in one shell and it just kept on rising. Maybe Half all the ingredients. It tasted like egg. It's a shame I didn't read the 1 star reviews first. I am a starting chef and I didn't think this recipe sounded okay but I tried it anyways.

I think I beat the eggs for too long.  The whites got sucked into the beaters first so I worked those in real good, but I think in the end this resulted in a more egg-like, fluffy chiffon kind of pie.  After it cooled, it sank into a texture more like cheesecake, but it still tasted very strongly of eggs, surprising with so much cream cheese and sour cream.

I want to try this again in a month or two, but beating the eggs together in their own bowl, adding slowly to the main mixture.

It was very delicious with some pie spices added, I had enough extra to put in a little ramekin, and I spiced this portion.

Both the pie and the ramekin contents rose well above their rims, fortunately I was cooking them both on a pie sheet.

Now I am wondering how to work some pumpkin into this recipe!

Easy and Delicious!!  I prepared just as the recipe states. No lemon added for fear of curdling... I made mini cheese cakes in small tart sized pre made graham cracker crusts. (The crusts were a little too sweet). I served with canned cherry pie filling. Husband approved! ????

Wow-- I am so glad I made this fabulous cheesecake, but I'm going back to graham cracker crusts.  The idea of two sticks of butter in addition to 16 oz cream cheese and 8 oz sour cream makes me feel too guilty, and I don't like fat-free sour cream.  For a topping, I used a potato masher on strawberries and cooked them with sugar to pour over individual pieces; it was a very good addition.

My wife made this for Thanksgiving.  It was unbelievable!  I told her this was the best cheesecake that I have ever had.  My brother called yesterday after having some leftovers.  He called just to tell my wife the same thing.  It is the best ever!

Very fast and easy, tasty too.  Definitely was a good on to try as a first cheesecake attempt! I made it with a graham cracker crust as that is what I prefer and made it in a pan that is a fair amount larger than the 9" it called for so it was a shallower cake.  It cracked AND I ruined the edges but after pouring on a little berry sauce we made it looked great despite all the flaws.   TIP: Fruit sauce will hide most flaws in such a cake, especially if it is made with darker berries like blackberries.

very easy to make and delicious. i used a 7 inch pie crust and reduced some ingredients, still turned on a really good one, but i would suggest, chill in refigerator longer is best. would love to make it again.

This was my first time making cheesecake and it came out absolutely delicious.  This recipe was easy and quick.  I took the advice of putting the cream cheese in hot water before prepping and it worked.  The cheese cake didn't burn but it did crack.  All in all fantastic!

Awesome - My 11 year old daughter wanted to make a plain cheesecake and this recipe was a hit.  She used a graham cracker crust, since we didn't have the shortbread.  Highly recommend this recipe.  It's simple and delicious.

I followed the recipe as it states (except I made my own grahm cracker crust) and it turned out pretty good!  The best part was that it isn't too sweet annnnnnnnnd it was SUPER easy!  I impressed my inlaws with this one, so definitely a keeper!  I added strawberries to the top, when served.

This is good. Instead of vanilla I added 2 tsp. of almond extract and sliced almonds.   I felt that it tasted too much like sour cream.

Loved the simpleness of the recipe.  I did cook it as "Reta" wrote on a review.  I had my husbands boss's over for dinner and served it for dessert and they loved it!  I didn't have Sandie's but maybe next time I'll try it with the cookies!

WOW!  That's all my husband, son and dinner guest kept saying.  This was a delicious and very easy cheesecake to make.  The only difference was I made a graham cracker crust at the last minute because I dropped my premade crust in the sink by mistake.  Topped with a blueberry topping and it was , by far, one of the best cheesecakes we've every had.  Thank you!!!

Absolutely perfect!  No need to change ANYTHING - sooo easy!  I used the exact same ingrediants, however with 1/3 less fat cream cheese and lite sour cream, but still turned out perfect and delicious and didn't take one bit of a reduced fat or anything. We ate it first after it had only cooled for less than an hour, and then again after it was cooled in the fridge.  (We put cherry pie filling on each piece after it baked - too good!) Great even with no toppings.

This is the BEST cheesecake ever! Most of my friends think it is an "old family recipe" and I am not going to correct them!!! Very easy and I follow exactly with the exception that I make my own graham cracker crust. It is so easy to make them and it really gives it that "family recipe" touch.

Boy, this is so easy that I am requested to make it a couple times a week.  This was the first cheesecake I made and then I tried another Sour Cream one that was alot more complicated and not as good.  Now, when I get asked the recipe, I can recite from the top of my head, it's that easy!

This was super easy and delicious. The baking time was about 63 minutes for me.  I did not use a water bath, b/c I didn't have a pan big enough to put it in, and I used a 9 in spring form pan.  Also, my alterations were that I used a homemade graham cracker crust and I put a little bit of orange juice in the batter for tang.  I'd guess maybe about 3 tbsp. I like that this was not super sweet.  On top I put a can of blueberry pie filling, b/c that's my husband's fave. All in all, a great recipe!

this cheesecake was so easy to make. i did increase the cream cheese to 3 packages and added an extra egg. do let all cold ingredients come to room temp for a smooth texture and do a water-bath and let cool one hour in oven after turning oven off.  made this for my in-laws' anniversary party and heard many wonderful compliments, including "this is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten!" thanks for a great recipe!

Used 8oz ricotta/ 8oz cream cheese, and almond extract... such a light and delicious cheesecake!  Also used the Never Fail Pie Crust II from this site, halved, and added 1/3 cup cocoa powder. SO EASY AND YUMMY!  It took about 30 minutes total to prep both crust and pie.  
Only gave it 4 stars because it's not the thicker, heavy, traditional NY cheesecake you might want - but I think I like this fluffy style better!

I've been meaning to write a review for this cheesecake for a year now. I would just like to say, thanks for a flawless cheesecake. It has been my "go-to" ever since I have tasted it. Excellent by itself, or with topping. My fav is caramel.BTW, I always follow the recipe exactly. THANKS FOR THIS TREAT!!

The perfect texture and so much easier to make than conventional cheesecakes.  Added a tablespoon of lemon juice (We like our cheesecake less sweet). Crushed up graham crackers and some melted butter for a crust. Baked in a 9 inch silicone pan for the time stated in a water bath. Came out perfect and creamy. Will make again!

I thought this recipe was good but not the greatest that i've ever tasted. The top rose but it fell down quite a bit.  It also seemed that 60 to 70 minutes wasn't enough to cook it.

not that this needs another review but i just have to say this: THIS WAS GREAT! i needed something easy and yummy creamy and it came out well. mine had cracks cos i didn't bake it all in water baths and didn't make little dance around it but that was fine with us. my husband put Nutella and ground pine nuts on top and it was orgasmic!

I made this recipe last night and although it was very easy to put together, i was a bit disappointed.  i used a homemade graham crust rather than a shortbread, but followed the directions exactly otherwise.  When i first removed it from the oven it was quite thick, but after it dropped to about an inch thick rather than what i see on the photo attached to this recipe!  The taste is nice, the texture is nice, but it sure didn't look like that picture!

This recipe is perfect. It has now become my default cheesecake. It baked beautifully and only had 2 tiny faults. It held firm but was still creamy, and absolutely delicious. I used a graham cracker crust but will try others. I hope it can also be "tampered" with by adding other flavors without jeopardizing the body of the cake. Delicious!

So easy to make, I thought it was absolutely perfect.  I baked mine in a pre-made graham cracker crust on a sheet pan, it was very full, but it came out perfectly.  My first cheesecake that actually tasted like what I want a cheesecake to taste like.

This was the cheesecake recipe I've been looking for. The only thing I did different was I made my own crust with graham cracker crumbs. Best cheesecake I ever made!!

Very good, simple to make cheesecake.  I made this for Easter, and got big compliments on it..  I seemed to think it was a little tangy, but no one else did.... I will definitely make this one again!

This cheesecake was so yummy!  I will definitely keep this recipe.  I made my own graham cracker crust.  Then I added choc. chips on top of the crust as another reviewer suggested.  I did the rest of the recipe as written.  I baked it without a water bath and it came out perfect!  No cracks.  And it was so creamy and delicious!  I think next time I'll put cherry pie filling on top.

OMG!!  My oven ran out of gas in the last twenty minutes of baking so I just shut if off and left the cake in there with the door shut.  This is the best cheesecake I have ever made in my life!!
It probably sat in the oven for about two hours while I was waiting for the gas man.  I gave up up decided what the heck we will try it.  Wonderful!!
