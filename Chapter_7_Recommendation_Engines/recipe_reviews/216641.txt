Great recipe that's a hit at large gatherings! It always makes such a nice presentation on a serving platter. The mix of colors is so vibrant and the combination of flavors is so delicous that no one ever walks away hungry! I add a bit of rolled up prosciutto along with the other meats. I also use sliced plum tomatoes and my all time favorite sun-dried tomatoes! I add in some black olives and drizzle the whole thing with a bit of olive oil. I serve it with balsamic vinegar on the side vs. over top. All that's left is to add a basket of crusty Italian bread - it just doesn't get much better than this!

I made this today for Superbowl Sunday. It is delicious! I didn't have fresh tomatoes (I don't buy them out of season) but I did have a jar of sundried tomatoes so I chopped up a few of those. The touch of sweet is nice. I also used some sharp swiss cheese (not really Italian but we like it).  Delicious! Will make again. Thanks Katie!

Sounds great, but you need some peperoncini's!  And maybe some sweet peppers.  And I like the idea of another reviewer of putting the vinegar on the side; not all like too much vinegar.
Thank you.

This is an excellent antipasto. The only thing that seemed to be missing was sufficient dressing. We doctored ours with additional caesar dressing. I also added some pickled mushrooms which were a nice addition. Next time, I will not toss the ingredients and present it with the individual ingredients artfully arranged.

Awesome recipe! I made exactly but did not use the tomatoes. I cut the meat and cheese into small 1" squares. I sprinkled the marinated artichoke juice over everything instead of using oil and vinegar. A huge hit and colorful!

This is a great recipe, just two problems:  1.  It needs pepperoncinis! 2.  WAY too much meat and cheese.  I cut out half the salami and all of the provolone.  I also added half a head of lettuce.

OMG!  Good!!!  I called this my $45 salad because it was a little expensive to make, but it was so worth it!  Very yummy!  The only thing I didn't like was the provolone cheese.  Next time I will use something different.  Also, I added capers.  I will definitely make this again (for special occasions).

Our daughter made this as the salad course to an Italian meal. She served small amounts of it on romaine lettuce leaves. The leftovers I've been tossing with spinach for an easy lunch salad. Very good recipe.

Added mosticiolli noodles (8 oz), green onions,and parmesan cheese (dried). Used fresh peppers and omitted artichokes. Because of the addition of noodles I increased the olive oil (to 4 Tablespoons) and seasonings (to taste). To add zest, I added a few flakes of dried red peppers. Refrigerated for 3 hours. Wonderfully refreshing in weather too hot to start the oven. Served with breadsticks.

Loved this! The only thing I changed was to use the lovely mixed olives and from the olive bar and left them whole. What made this so good was the addition of the sharp provolone ( fantastic!!! ), in addition to the blander, softer mozz. There is a lot of confusion about antipasto salads, people seem to think they are pasta salads, instead of BEFORE (anti) the pasta. This was beautiful, delicious and just  perfect for those days when it's too hot to cook and you just can't face more lettuce. I served this with a white bean and tuna salad and some crostini.

Made this for our sons First Holy Communion in May.  I made it the day before because I love the 'sauce' that it makes.  I added pepporcinis to it, doubled the ingredients, tripled the vinegar, as we like it less oily. I also add a box of lined elbows (Barilla). I suggest lined because the sauce gets trapped in the lines and it is so good. It reminded me of Sunday dinner, growing up in New York.  It's truly better the next day, just like lasagna.  Making with Christmas dinner.  If you omit the meats it's perfect for Feast of Seven Fishes for Christmas Eve, but we will be waiting until Christmas dinner (or breakfast) to indulge.  Don't forget the crusty bread for dunking.  It's a bit expensive but it's worth it.

Yum, so good! Made it for a fourth of July BBQ. Will make again and again. The only thing I changed was to add torn green leaf lettuce on the bottom.

Went fast at the party.  A bit expensive, but I keep it for special occasions.  I used fresh small mozzarella balls, cherry tomatoes and olives all cut in half. I used only Genoa salami and  provolone cut in chunks.  Marinated artichoke hearts (drained well) and the basil and dressing.  And a few whole pepperoncinis Awesome!  Next time I will keep a bit out for myself before I serve it.  Goes very fast.

Delicious.  I have made this many times with many variations and different dressings.  I usually serve as an appetizer with fancy toothpicks.  As an appetizer everything needs to be bitesize so I leave the olives whole and make sure the chunks are big enough to pick up with the tooth picks.  With the longer toothpicks guests can make their own little kabob combinations.

It turned out great! Two small changes: I left out the artichoke hearts and used a tablespoon of balsamic honey dressing instead of the red wine vinegar. It really was yummy!

Love this recipe! I didn’t have tomatoes or basil, so I substituted seedless cucumbers and fresh dill. So delicious! Will definitely make this again.

Very good salad to serve with a pasta dish.  I used pepperoni and hard salami.  Don't even think of serving with additional dressing--it is perfect the way it is.

Made this tonight after my hubby asked me to try to make it after having had it at a BBQ earlier this summer.  I used Parmesan vs mozzarella and pepperoni vs one of the salami because I had them on hand.  Also doubled the oil/vinegar amounts.  I tossed it into my favorite Italian pottery serving bowl and can't wait to surprise my husband with it tonight!

I made this following the recipe with the exception of a handful of pasta i threw in to "dilute" all the salty meats, cheeses, and canned items. This was delicious.

I  thought this was a good antipasto. I followed the recipe fairly closely except for subbing Colby jack for the provolone and adding so.e cucumber I had on hand.  Was a very nice side for our Italian seasoned steak.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is really yummy.  I did it once straight from the recipe.   The second time, I combined this recipe with a panzanella recipe (adding cubed bread and leaving out the black olives 'cuz I don't like 'em).  It was terrific both ways.

This was great. I made it for a monthly dinner club I'm in. I didnt know what to expect as far as what people thought of it, but it was a huge hit! People were asking for doggie bags to take some home with them. 

My local market didn't have "regular" canned artichokes, so I ended up getting marinated artichoke hearts. This worked out well and gave the overall dish and the "dressing," if you will, a zesty taste.

I didn't make this, but a coworker did for our store picnic. She added 5 Roma Tomatoes, added a cucumber diced up and put one packet of Seven Seasons Italian dressing in to season it also. Really good!!!! My husband usually turns up his nose at anything with tomatoes, olives or any of the other things in this but HE was the one that told me to get the recipe.

I made this antipasto salad to go with a lasagna and garlic bread dinner.  It was the perfect accompaniment.  I did cut down on the vinegar to 2 T and added some garlic, sugar and Italian seasoning to the dressing though.

I miade this salad for a large family gathering. I added 8 oz of mostaccioli noodles. Also, replaced the oil and vinegar with artichoke marinade and the juice of half a lemon, as both were readily available. Super delicious! Everyone raved about this. My husband said "Let's move this to the 'regular rotation'!" Thank you for submitting!

This was easy to make and so good! I made it for a luncheon at work and it was a hit.
