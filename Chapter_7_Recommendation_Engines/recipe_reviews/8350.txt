OK - I don't want to be rude, but this is the deal:  this is a perfect recipe, and if it fails for you, it's your fault, not the recipe's.  A couple of things you should know about cheesecakes:

OVERBEATING WILL CAUSE A CHEESECAKE TO CRACK.  Beat cream cheese with sugar only until smooth.  Proceed with a wooden spoon for the rest of the recipe.

OVERBEATING WILL CAUSE A CHEESECAKE TO HAVE THE "WRONG" TEXTURE.  Air bubbles, gritty/not creamy texture, etc., are fixed my the same instructions above.

OVERCOOKING WILL CAUSE A CHEESECAKE TO CRACK.  Do NOT cook this cheesecake until it's set.  Matter of fact, don't check it at all.  Put the cheesecake in the oven, set the timer to 60 min., turn the oven off, and forget it.  I mean it!  Don't open the oven, just leave it alone to do its thing.

And that's it.  A beautiful cheesecake.  Far from bland:  this is a PURIST'S cheesecake.  It's great as is, but also a great foil for other flavours.  I serve mine with passionfruit pulp or mango puree.

I would like to update my review on this cheesecake. I originally gave it a five and still give it a five. I have made this cheesecake many times; sometimes it cracks sometimes it doesn't. Finally I read that if you grease the sides of your pan, it will not crack, since cracking often  happens in the cooling process as the cake pulls away from the sides. Since I began greasing the sides,I have not had a cracked cheesecake. People who like the NY style of cheesecake love this recipe.

I've made cheesecakes many times, only to have them crack and sink after cooling. With the tips that I picked up on allrecipes.com, Chantal's New York Cheesecake was a hit with my family & friends. After cooling, the top remained level and the center firmed up. The top was a beautiful golden brown with no dry edges. The inside was creamy and smooth, and not too sweet.

The tips are as follows:

1. Make sure that your ingredients are around room temperature, not cold, otherwise your batter will be lumpy.

2. Wrap your springform pan with 2 layers of aluminum foil to prevent water in the bain marie (water bath) from seeping in.

3. Place your springform pan in a water bath in the oven, filled with 1 inch of very hot water, then proceed to bake as instructed in the recipe.

4. Right after baking, run a warm or greased knife around the rim of the cake to prevent cracking while cooling.

5. Leave the cake in the oven for 2 hours to cool. (I didn't have time to leave it in for the recommended 6 hrs, and it still works.)

I'll make variations of this cheesecake, such as blueberry topping, oreo base and filling etc.

ENJOY!

AMAZING! The KING of all cheesecakes! This is the recipe you are looking for, Thick and Creamy! Ive made this 2X now with tremendous sucess. However, I found this crust to need some work, so this is the recipe I use: 1 1 /2 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. finely chopped Unsalted nuts (walnuts, pecans), 1/4 c. melted butter, 1 tsp. cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Mix together and press into 9" springform pan. As for the cheesecake mixture, make Sure to start with room temp. ingredients, use a mixer to beat cream cheese and sugar, then hand-mix from there on. Feel free to add chocolate chips, toffee bits, etc. to the mixture before transferring into graham cracker crust.  Use a water bath, (See Cheesecake section under Cooking Basics on this site) with the pan double wrapped in foil.  When cheesecake is done, turn oven off, run knife around edge of the cake to completely loosen from the pan. Close oven door, leave in for 3+ hours, until completely cool. Refrigerate overnight. I make a homemade raspberry topping, as follows: 1 10oz. pkg frozen raspb., 2 tblsp. white sugar, 2 tsp. cornstarch & 1/2 c. water.  In med. saucepan, mix sugar & corn starch well.  Add water & bring to a boil.  Add raspberries & boil for 5 minutes, or until thick.  If you wish, strain the hot mixture to remove seeds.  Place in refrigerator to completely cool.  Place 1-2 tablespoons over chilled cheesecake, top with a curl of white chocolate.  Award Winning!

I have been working with this recipe for a couple of years now.  Yesterday, one of my co-workers and I had a cheesecake cook-off.  Everyone RAVED about my cheesecake and I felt bad for the other guy.  His was made with Cool-Whip and took 20-30 minutes to make.  Mine was Chantal's (with modifications) and took me 16 hours from start to serve (including chilling).

I have been adjusting this recipe to get the perfect weight, density, and creaminess (to MY tastes) and I THINK I've got it!  (By George, I think she's got it!)  I like a HEAVY New York-Style Cheesecake that's not TOO cakey (translation: DRY!).  So here is what I've come up with:

I use 2 TBSP. flour instead of 1/4 cup AND use a water bath.
I baked it at 225 degrees for 3 hours and 40 minutes (I KNOW that sounds like a LONG time, but remember, I've been working on this for a couple of years - OK.......not consistantly, but whenever I feel like making a cheesecake.  I make myself notes on the back of the recipe.)  After it has baked 3 hours and 40 minutes, I turn off the oven and crack the oven door for a few minutes to get it to cool down more quickly.  I leave the cheesecake in the oven for 6 hours and then put it in the refrigerator until WELL chilled (about 6 more hours).

Was a big hit at my husband's office! Mine didn't crack, but I was careful not to overmix and had the cream cheese at room temperature, and these are supposed to help prevent cracking.  I also used a water bath, and I made sure that the side of the springform pan, not just the bottom, was well greased. (I read in a magazine that cheesecakes shrink from the sides of the pan as they cool, and if the side isn't well greased, the cheesecake will stick and, thus, crack.)  Per previous reviewers, I baked it at 325 deg. and made the crust as follows: 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, and 1/4 cup sugar. I substituted Bailey's Irish Cream for the milk.  I had a can of cherry pie filling available for those who wanted a topping. A picture-perfect cheesecake!

I found this recipe a few years ago, and have been making it ever since.  I have changed a few things according to my taste. I bake mine in a water bath, and that helps to keep it more moist, and also to avoid cracking.  Make sure you put it into boiling water instead of cold.  Also, put your cheesecake in an oven bag before you put it into the water bath.  Wrapping the pan in tin 
foil just doesn't seem to keep the water away from the crust.  I also don't even add the flour.  It allows the cake to be less like cake, and it makes it so creamy and rich.  I also double the butter in the crust, and I add the whites of one egg.  This allows it to hold together better, so it's a lot less crumbly.  Lastly, I don't let mine sit in the oven for 5 to 6 hours, who has the time?  I put mine straight into the fridge.  It seems to turn out just as well.  Good luck! :)

Recipe turned out great! I didn't have a pan big enough to put my 9-inch springform pan in for a water bath, so I just put it on a rack and put a pan of water underneath it. It was steamy enough to produce a perfectly uncracked cake (325F for 1 hr). At end of baking, unlike what it says in the cheesecake tips in the reference section, cake was completely SOLID, WITHOUT a "3-inch circle" that was still un-set. Cake texture still turned out PERFECT, so don't worry if there isn't a wobbly center after baking.

I used "Baker's Secret Pie Crust" (bake crust for 15 mins, not 10) instead of the grahan cracker crust, and made a sour cream topping for a professional touch (1 cup sour cream, 2 tablespoons white sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Combine and spread evenly after cheesecake has baked and cooled for 10 mins. Bake at 325F for 10 mins to set. Spread EVENLY, as the sour cream will not melt; it will only set, so any imperfection before you put it in the oven will show after baking. Leave in oven to cool for 6 hrs. chill and serve!).  


You might want to decrease the amount of milk to 1/2 cup for a denser cake, although do so with caution. My version as outlined above makes a 5lb cheesecake, which is about 1 1/2 inches high using a 9-inch springform pan. Everyone who tasted my cheesecake said it was as good as the famed cheesecake of a local 5-star hotel, whose cheesecake is widely regarded as the best cheesecake in the city! (my homecity has over 7 million inhabitants, s

Amazing cheesecake!  5 stars!  People don't realize that *Cracking* comes from overmixing a cheesecake or having too many air bubbles- as well as rapid cooling.  
The method of cooling this cheesecake WILL prevent cracking- if you don't overmix it.  Follow the recipe exactly, and it will turn out awesome.

I gave it two stars because it tasted "like" cheesecake, but that's the only reason. I was hesitant at first as with most recipes. I was puzzled by the use of milk with the sour cream. I was also curious about the amount of flour, and extra 1/2 cup sugar. Now I'm no stranger to cheesecake. I used to own a bakery up in Washington and I made close to 20 different varieties of cheesecake, most of which were customer requests and were sold by the whole cake. Enough of me. I was diligent in following this recipe as directed and it "fell flat". Here's why: The heat is too high (burns cake), the milk creates too much moisture and it takes too long to cook, too much flour made it too dry, and I don't know if it was the flour, or the extra 1/2 cup sugar, or the milk but it was hard to get the flavor and texture of the cream cheese to jump out at you. I think the people that are giving this recipe five stars really need to try some other cheesecake recipes and then rate this one. Okay, thanks but "no thanks".

Definitely worthy of 5 stars!!! I make cheesecakes often, and my husband prefers basic "no frills" NY cheesecakes the best (with canned cherry topping). I used reviewer NYGirl5's suggestion and made a shortbread cookie crust with lemon zest (to switch it out a bit). I reduced to 2 tbsp. of flour for a creamier texture. For a flawless, no crack or browned cheesecake, it is best to bake it in a water bath on the middle shelf of the oven. Cover bottom and sides of cheesecake pan with foil (to prevent water from seeping in) and set in larger roasting pan. Pour boiling water in roasting pan so that it reaches approx. halfway up cheesecake pan.  I never ever get cracks, and my cheesecake never browns. Also, it is important to bring cream cheese to room temp., so you don't end up overbeating the filling (which causes cracks and bubbles). I only left it in the oven for 1 hour after I stopped baking. Let it cool properly before putting it in refrigerator or you will end up with condensation on top. Great recipe-I will definitely be making this again. Thank you, Chantal!

The first time I made this recipe, I was half way through baking when I realized with horror that I had not bothered to read any of these reviews or suggestions. However, this cheesecake turned out absolutely heavenly without any modifications. The second time I made it though, I took the time to read all of the suggestions here thinking I could make it even better. However, when I followed all of these tips, my cheesecake turned out with a chalky texture, not nearly as good. So, my only suggestion is to avoid all of these suggestions. It's perfect as is! :)

After reading the reviews, I was concerned about the flour and milk.  I researched other cheesecake recipes, and sure enough, none of them called for either.  So I simply left out both the milk and the flour, and I'm very glad I did.  The texture was very smooth and creamy.  I'm convinced milk and flour do not add to the flavor or the texture, and they are better omitted.  I also followed the advice of other reviewers (don't you love being able to consult the reviews?) and added ground almonds, sugar, and cinnamon to the crust and increased the butter to 1/4 cup.  This really elevated the crust from blah to extraordinary.  I baked in a water bath at 325F for 1 hr and 15 min, and let it cool in a closed oven.  The lower temperature prevented the cheesecake from browning, and it set perfectly without cracks after refridgration.  (After I started using a crockpot liner instead of foil to cover the bottom, I've never had a problem with water leaking into my cheesecake.  Just make sure to tie the excess into a knot so it is tight around the pan and doesn't fall flat into the water or into the cheesecake.)  With these modifications, my husband and I would rate this cheesecake is the BEST we've ever tasted.  Thanks to the previous reviewers about the tips on room temp ingredients and not overmixing!  This is the first time my cheesecase has not cracked and had such lovely texture!

This is the closest I have ever seen anywhere to my heirloom recipe, and I do make the very best cheesecake ever - hundreds will attest to this fact. I can not give out my exact recipe for professional reasons but I do have a few tips. A cheesecake is supposed to crack. Don't worry thats what pie topping/fresh fruit is for. If you give it a waterbath it will change the texture to a custard. Refridgerate immediately, hot out of the oven - I'm not crazy, fabulous results. You must let your cheesecake rest for 24 hours minimum refridgerated, uncovered, untopped for best flavour. This is a great recipe.

I am so disappointed. People should not give it 5 stars if they change the way the recipe is prepared. I followed the recipe exactly as it says and it turned out horrible. The cheesecake grew taller than the pan, cracked a lot and turned brown on top. After reading the reviews and other more trustworthy recipes, I found out the oven was too hot (325 or 300 is ideal) and the ingredients should have been at room temperature (which the recipe doesn't call for). A water pan underneath would have been great as well. I am a great cook, but it's my first time making cheesecake and I didn't know these things, which is why I looked for a recipe well-tried with good reviews. Very misleading. Now i have to serve this at my daughter's birthday. Agh. Again, don't give a recipe 5 stars if you change the way it's prepared.

HOLY MOLY was this recipe a SLAM DUNK! I made this cheesecake for a bake sale and it was gone in less than 2 hours! I even had people coming back for seconds! My only problem was that I was caught a little bit off guard with the crust. The recipe calls for 15 graham crackers, but doesn't specify what constitutes a graham cracker. I first thought it was an entire sheet (that breaks into 4), but soon realized there were way too many graham crackers for the amount of butter specified. I ended up using a crust recipe previously mentioned (1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, and 1/4 cup sugar) and it literally saved the day (thanks KIMAR!) This cheesecake is hands down the absolute best cheesecake in existence. Don't hesitate to choose this recipe if you're looking to bake your first cheesecake... trust me... you will NOT be disappointed.

My wife says this is the best cheesecake she's ever had.  I did make a couple of changes.  Add 1/3 cup of cornstarch.  This makes it a bit more "fluffy" like we like it.  Also, this recipe allows the crust to become soggy when the batter is added.  Here's the secret to a great, crispy cheesecake crust.  Use 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of melted butter (the real stuff, not margarine!) to the 15 graham crackers.  Use a food processor to crush the graham crackers.  Mix the sugar and graham crackers, then add the melted butter.  Press it into the springform pan and bake in the preheated oven for about 17 minutes.  (that's right, 17 minutes)  I usually bake the crust in the oven while I'm preparing the batter.  The crust will get darker and actually gets more toasted rather than just heated.  Also, definitely bake the cheesecake in a water bath.  I wrap three layers of heavy duty foil around the springform pan before placing it in the water bath.  (I simply use a roasting pan.)  Be sure to pull the foil up at all points around the pan.  Any portion that remains low will allow water to seep in.  When the cheese cake is finished, the crust is crispy and delicious. I used to scrape away the soggy crusts until I came up with this.

This cheesecake turned out beautifully. Everyone who tasted said it was the best they ever had and went back for seconds. I served it with a strawberry puree. It was the first cheesecake that I've made. I was always intimidated by the springform pan, but now I know there's nothing to it. I didn't have a pan large enough to do a water bath. So I filled a 9x13 glass dish with boiling water and placed it under the cheesecake. It turned out perfect, plus no cracks on the top of the cheesecake. I baked it for one hour, then turned off the oven and left it in for 5 hours without opening the door. Then I put it in the refrigerator unwrapped for 18 hours. I used the crust recipe that someone else suggested earlier: 1 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 c. sugar, 1/4 c. finely chopped uUnsalted nuts (walnuts, pecans), 1/4 c. melted butter, 1 tsp. cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Mix together and press into bottom of 9" springform pan. I popped in the 350 degree oven for about 3 minutes so I didn't have a soggy crust. I didn't think I'd taste the pecans but it gave the crust a great flavor. Most important for the cheesecake batter, start with room temperature ingredients.

The first time I made this, I made many mistakes - and it was still wonderful cheesecake.

1 - this recipe decidedly calls for a water bath - at this time/temp, the lack of a water bath will have it very overdone.

2 - Do NOT add the vanilla at the same time as the flour - the flour will absorb the vanilla and you'll get little brown lumps.

Cheesecake seemed a very intimidating challenge for a novice like me.  I looked long and hard and finally decided on this recipe.  From some helpful tips here, I did not overmix, used room-temp ingredients, wrapped the springform in foil, and did the water bath.  Baked one hour, shut the oven off and left it in there for about 6 hours without opening the door once! (that was tough!) This morning, my result is a gorgeous, light, delicious cheesecake.  It did not crack or dry out and since I brought it to work, it certainly didn't last long!  :)  Thank you!

***ETA***
I first reviewed this recipe in November 2007 after making it once.  Since then I have made it several times and have more to add...

Attempt #1 - Used springform wrapped in aluminum foil and water 3/4 way up the sides in a water bath.  My result was a pale cheesecake, with slightly mushy crust edges because of the low quality of the springform.

Attempt #2 - Used same springform pan.  Set 9x13 pyrex full of water on the shelf below.  Result tasted the same, but wasn't as pretty - browned around the edges only and split a huge crack down the center.

Attempt #3(and everytime since then) - Used same springform with double aluminum foil wrap and only about 1/2" water in the roasting pan.  By the time I removed the cheesecake from the oven, all the water had pretty much evaporated.  Browned evenly all over the top, no crack and crust wasn't soggy!  Yay!  Finally got it right!

The recipe is very simple and fullproof.

I have made this before and know it is an excellent recipe.  I do want to warn against other reviewer's advice in attempting to bake in a water bath.  Number one, you cannot possibly wrap anything tightly enough in aluminum foil to prevent water from seeping in.  Number two, baking in a water bath provides a sort of insulation preventing the cheesecake from reaching the desired baking temperature thereby skewing the required baking time by as much as an hour or more.  The best thing to do is to place a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake.  Verifying that your oven temperature is accurate is also critical as temperature is very important. Better to be too low.  If you think your oven bakes things faster than the usual recommended time then turn your oven down 25C or so to bake your cheesecake.

I've used this recipe for years now....made a couple of changes. I use 5 bricks of cream cheese, 4 eggs, 16oz sour cream, 1tbs vanilla and 1 1/2 cups of sugar. No milk or flour for me because it makes it runny......the sour cream makes it rich and creamy. Also, if you have bubbles from over-mixing.....when you get all ingredients in the spring form pan, pick it up and drop it on the counter a few times....the bubbles will rise to the top and burst. Also use a water bath and you shouldn't have any cracks.

It's been awhile since I made these, but this is what I did.  I was asked by my best friends son if I could make cheese cakes for his wedding (I had done mini cheesecakes, 1,500 for his sisters graduation open house with multiple flavors)  I told him I would be delighted. I tried a couple recipes on friends and they all chose this one, so I had 20 to make for an April 29th wedding.  It's a good thing cheese cakes freeze well.  Since I was going to school and I could only had time to bake one or two nights a week and only had about 8 weeks from the time I decided what recipe I was going to use.  I tried the water bath, they cracked, in fact all of them cracked but once they were cut it didn't make a difference. I have two ovens, so I did two cheese cakes a night.  The trick was they wanted different flavors so sometimes I replaced the milk with a flavoring.  I did hazelnut, grasshopper (1 full package of Keebler Grasshopper cookies crushed), ButterFinger (10 funsize bars crunched) plain with fruit on top, Snickers and then I had two surpise flavors that ended up being the biggest hit at the reception.  One was Kahlua and the other was a carmel liquor.  Like I said, they all cracked no matter what I did, once they were cut no one knew and everyone raved about them.

Awesome recipe! This cheesecake is PERFECT: delicious, creamy, and very, very rich! I made mine into a decadent chocolate cheesecake by using crushed chocolate cookies for the crust and adding a cup of melted semisweet chocolate chips to the batter. This is now my "impress the guests" dessert. Thanks for sharing!

wow was this an incredible cheesecake, i cheated with the crust and bought it ready made. i used fat free sour cream, and a lower fat cream cheese and it still tasted as good as any cheesecake I could have gotten in a deli, and I live in new york!!! the only thing was since i used the ready made crust i got two cheesecakes out of it, it goes great with strawberry glaze also. And mine did NOT crack but that was because I put a pan as suggested of water under the cakes as they cooked and left it in the oven for the 6 hours, it was hard waiting but worth it.

I have made this cheesecake twice now and it was WONDERFUL both times.  The first time I made it, i did it word by word and served it with a strawberry glaze. Yum!  The second time i made it exactly the same way but instead made it with an Oreo cookie crust.  I was so relieved it turned out better then the first even though i forgot to wrap the pan in tin foil.  I am even getting requests on different flavors like snickers (I will let you know how that works).  My next one will have a crust made of Nilla wafers with a raspberry glaze.  Should be great.  Point is, this cheesecake is the best I have ever made or had. P.S. I am only 14 and had no trouble at all :)

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake and it was beautiful.  Thank you Chantel. I did use a water bath, I wrapped my spring form pan in foil- 2 layers. I removed it from the bath and let it rest in the oven for an hour and a half then, ran a knife around the edge and then removed the foil, let it rest another hour on the counter before putting it in the fridge. I left it in the fridge for 12+ hours. It didn't stick to the spring form pan. It was beautiful, no air bubbles, no cracks, no sinking. It looked like I bought it from our local cheesecake shop. No one want any topping, it was perfect w/o anything. The texture was like velvet. I served this New year's day after dinner. I have never been so proud of something I served. Thank You Chantal! I did change the recipe a little.  I added only 2 tablespoon of flour (like other reviewers said), added 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 extra tablespoon vanilla. I substituted chocolate graham crackers for crust and did need a little extra butter. My center was solid and not wobbly like other reviewer mentioned and I baked mine 325 degrees for 1 hr and 10 minutes. This is the perfect recipe. I would recommend anyone trying it to read many of the reviews for tips as well as the www.allrecipe.com tips for cheesecakes. I think doing that and this wonderful recipe is why mine was such a huge hit. I can't wait to make more. I think I am addicted to baking these.

I've made several cheesecakes, and this was the worst yet.  In accordance with the previous posts, I followed the recipe EXACTLY - even stayed up late so I could let it sit in the oven the stated amount of time!!  It was covered in cracks, was way too dense, was very "eggy," and the crust completely fell apart.  

Am very open to suggestions, if anyone knows what might have gone wrong, as I was very much looking forward to having a fabulous "classic" cheesecake recipe!  As it is - am simiply very glad I did a trial run before Easter dinner :)

I was expecting this cheesecake to be delicious from the rave reviews and the 5 stars. I am starting to wonder if the people that gave this cheesecake 5 stars or even 4 or 3 even know what a real cheesecake tastes like. First of all, the texture is not that of a normal cheesecake. Second, you cannot taste much of the cream cheese. Third, it is very bland. I always top my cheesecakes with shredded Dove milk chocolate, and that couldn't even help with the lack of flavor this cheesecake produces. Lastly, it is not sweet in any sense. If you are looking for an authentic cheesecake taste or just a good cheesecake for that matter, do not attempt to make this, you will be very disappointed. This recipe doesn't even  deserve 1 star.

How exciting! I am the 2000th reviewer! This was AMAZING. I still can't believe I baked such a perfect cheesecake! I made the crust as suggested by many reviewers (1 1/2 c graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 c melted butter, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 c sugar).  I baked the crust for 10 minutes.  The crust was good...not soggy.  I might try baking 15 minutes next time. Baking temp was 325.  

I used a 9" springform pan, greased bottom and sides. All ingredients were at room temp. I used mixer on low speed for cream cheese and sugar. I beat the eggs with a fork before adding so they would be easier to add with a wooden spoon.  (After mixing the sugar and cream cheese, I mixed the rest of the ingredients with a wooden spoon.) I wrapped pan in 2 layers of foil, used a 1" hot water bath in a large, rectangular pyrex baking dish. I baked for 60 minutes. I didn't peak once!! After 60 minutes, I opened the oven and it absolutely did not look done. I ignored all of my instincts to cook it longer and assumed it was done. I ran warm knife (heated with hot water) around edges and then closed the door. I let the cheesecake cool (water bath and all) for 6 hours.  By then it was 6:00pm. We resisted the urge to eat it, letting it chill overnight. It was wonderful the next day. It looked amazing. It could have been in a magazine! No cracks, perfect non-brown top...I still can't believe I made it.  Thanks so much to all reviewers who offered so many great tips to perfect this recipe. And thanks to Taliesen

10 STARS!

I made this for my sister's birthday (a cheesecake FANATIC), and she said it's at least 1 MILLION times better than her ex-favorite cheesecake! It was "smooth, creamy, and sooo decadent," in my family's words.This was my first cheesecake (I'm 15, by the way), so I took lots of precautions.

So here's some key things I did:
- Left all of the ingredients out on the counter overnight to let them come to room temperature.
- Wrapped a 9" springform pan tightly with 3 layers of heavy duty aluminum foil.
- Greased the bottom AND sides of the pan a personal recipe from http://www.recipezaar.com/78579- maybe unecessary, butit was PERFECT!
- Make the crust according to a recipe, previously posted: whisked 15 graham crackers (used the food processor), 1/4 c. sugar, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon together. Then, added ~6 tbp. melted butter. Patted on bottom and up sides with hands and flat-bottomed cup.
- Creamed the cream cheese in mixer. Then, put mixer (KitchenAid) on the slowest (Stir) and slowly incorporated the sugar. Put the setting back on "Cream" until just incorporated.
- Used a wooden spoon to gently mix in the rest of the ingredients- eggs one at a time, slowly stirring.
- Put mixer through sieve to catch lumps. Once COMPLETELY through, left resulting mixture to sit for 30 minutes for air bubbles to rise. Popped any air bubble I saw with a fork.
- Poured the batter into pre-greased pan and gently tap pan on countertop to force air bubbles up (at least 100 times). Popped any

Before I began making cheesecake, I researched tips on making cheesecake. I learned to be careful not to overbeat the cheesecake filling because if you do that, there will be too many air bubbles and the cheesecake will sink afterwards. I also learned that cheesecake must be baked in a waterbath. The way I made it was I took a bigger pan, put a towel on the bottom and filled the pan with boiling water. I then placed my springform pan on top, and I made sure that the water didn't overflow into the pan - I read that you can wrap the springform pan with foil so that water doesn't seep into the cheesecake. And the last thing I learned is that when cheesecake is done, it doesn't look done - it still jiggles a little. This was my first time baking cheesecake and it turned out excellent. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have used this receipe for 25yrs and it never fails to be a big hit. If you make cheesecakes very often it might be worth it to you to purchase a countertop convection oven if your oven doesn't offer that feature. The difference in the height of the cheesecake will be remarkable.

There aren't enough stars on here for this one!!! Now I know why so many have tried it!  This is New York style cheesecake!  I didn't change a thing except to double the crust.  I followed the directions and also did a "water bath".  No cracking at all.  It was creamy, smooth, rich, and delicious.  My husband ate every bite!

I have made this cheesecake several times and I get requests to make it more and more! People even tell me to enter this in contests! 
I always use a water bath, and I have recently used a new technique that has made sure my cheesecake hasn't cracked! Right when the cheesecake is done cooking, take it out of the oven and run a wet warm knife around the entire edge of the springform. (Be careful not to go too fast and keep putting the knife under running water) Put it back in the oven for about an hour. After that, you can put it in the frige uncovered for a few hours. (or it will get sweaty) Then cover.
Good luck!

First off: this is an excellent recipe. But, not without flaws. This amount of ingredients is too much for 1 - 9 inch springform pan. For this amount, you can make 2 - 6 inch springform pans. And for cheesecake, you should always use a water bath to prevent cracking. It promotes even cooking, also. Now, for my suggestions. I use the crust recipe from Pumpkin cheesecake II on this site. It has pecans in the crust and is incredible. I usually add some cinnamon to the crust, as well. And, I bake the crust for about 20 minutes first. Makes it so it is not mushy. Great crust everytime. I also use a mix of almond, orange, lemon and vanilla extract with some lemon and orange peel in it.  Again, I either cut down the ingredients or make 2 cheesecakes..  For the sake of argument, overbeating the batter will not cause it to crack. It will make it lighter. So, if you want a denser cake, don't mix the batter as long. As for cooling, if you leave a cheesecake out that long to cool, I think you are asking for trouble. I usually leave it out for an hour and then refrigerate uncovered until it cools. If you cover it too soon, moisture will form on the plastic wrap and top of the cheesecake.

This recipe got me second place in the office bake-off (and I still think it should have gotten first).  I made it twice, once in a springform pan, the other time in a 9X13 pan.  Both turned out excellent.  I do, however, have some tips.  

CRUST: A lot of people add cinnamon and sugar to the crust.  Just buy Cinnamon Graham Crackers.  Crush them up, it works well.  Like people said, 15 crackers appears to be the wrong number.  I used around 12 (even in the 9x13 pan) and regardless, added a lot more butter (probably at least 5 TBS).  You want to have a consistency in the graham cracker/butter mixture that you can ALMOST form a ball.  I tried both baking the crust for five minutes (and leting it cool completely) and not baking it at all until the batter was on top of it.  Both worked great - I really don't feel baking the crust added anything.  

CRUST CRACKING: I tried everything to avoid the cake cracking including greasing the pan and  using the water bath.  Both the bars and the cheesecake cracked regardless.  I did have better results, though, with leaving the bars in the closed oven overnight (I made them late at night - just turned the oven off at the right time and went to bed). 

Cracking or not - it's still the best cheesecake I've ever made!

This is my GO TO recipe for cheesecake. The keys to no cracking are these: don't over beat the mix, accurate oven temp., and let it set in the oven undisturbed to cool for several hours. I usually make this at night & leave it in the oven overnite. Then my DH puts it in the fridge when he gets up @ 6 in the morning. 
And don't forget that the sour cream topping ( 1 cup sour cream & 2-3 TBL sugar mixed well. Apply to cake during last 15 min of baking) can fill any imperfections, but smooth it nicely as it won't spread during baking.

This was the final cheesecakes of my taste test. It came in #1 and deservedly so! I have to say, it was virtually perfect.  It was as smooth and silky as butter, had fabulous taste, but it cracked a bit.  I lowered the temp and it was fine.  I'm glad it was suggested that the bottom outside be covered with foil, make sure you don't skip that part! Excellent recipe overall.

Perfect "cheesecake" taste! Thank you!!! (Suggestions for cook time and water bath follow.)  I had to make this twice to get the cook time right. The first time, I baked at 350 for an hour, but followed another reviewer's suggestion that 2 hours was sufficient to sit in the oven. After that first hour, the cheesecake was still very jiggly, but I assumed it would firm up during the cool down. It did not. The outside was firm, but the center was raw.  I don't want to invest 7 hours in a cheesecake, so I experimented. I baked for 30 minutes at 375 then reduced the temp to 250. According to a friend who makes cheesecakes professionally, the time can vary each time you bake. He suggested anywhere from 45-90 minutes at 250. Use your eyes to judge, not the timer. Start with 45 minutes. Tap the edge of the pan. When only the very center jiggles, it's ready. Turn the oven off, leave the door closed, and let it sit for an hour. I moved it to the fridge after that, there was no cracking, and the cheesecake was perfectly set the next morning.  As far as the water bath goes, unless you use extra wide foil, you are likely to wind up with soggy crust. Instead, put a pan of water in the oven during the pre-heat. By the time the cheesecake goes in, you should have some steam going. Put the cake on the rack above the pan, not in the pan. You'll get the same effect without the risk of a soggy crust.

This cheesecake was amazing.  Restaurant quality.  I was worried at first because this was only the second time I've ever made cheesecake.  The first time I had no clue what I was doing -- it ended up brown with a big crack.  Not bad, but not great either (mind you it was a different recipe also).  This time I prepared and read up on allrecipes tips.  I used a waterbath, made sure not to overbeat, used room-temperature ingredients.  I turned the oven on, let it preheat, stuck the cheesecake in for exactly 1 hour, turned off the oven, and left it in for 2 hours.  I never opened the oven until I took it out.  It was perfect.  No cracks, no browning, just smooth and white!  I used about 26 crushed Oreos for the crust and a chocolate ganache found here on the site.  It was thick, rich, and seriously absolutely amazing and addictive. UPDATE: I made this a turtle cheesecake and was told by two people that this is the best thing they've ever eaten. Will supply picture/add-ons.

OUTSTANDING!  Everyone told me it was the BEST cheesecake they had ever had!  I did make the following modifications:  CRUST- used 1/4 c butter and 2T sugar.  After pressing into the pan baked for 5 min then cooled completly. CHEESECAKE- made sure all ingredients were at room temperature, added splash of lemon juice, didn't overmix, sprayed sides of pan with cooking spray and baked in the oven with a pan of water on the lowest rack.  Cool complety in the oven-- DON'T peek!  There were no cracks and it turned out AWESOME!!  GREAT GREAT RECIPE!!

This recipes has a wonderful Cheesecake filling but there must be a misprint on the crust. 15 graham crackers with only 2 Tblsp butter does not work I have a wonderful tasting cheesecake sitting on top of graham cracker crumbs. Also I would bake in a water bath because the oven cooling method produced huge cracks

This recipie is so simple straight forward and easy.  I have made NY style cheescakes before and they ALWAYS turned out poorly.  I followed this recipie exactly and it turned out PERFECT.  It was a gift for my daughter's 14th birthday and she was delighted.  The only changes I would make the next time is less flour for a creamier texture and reducing the oven temp to 325 degrees.  Mine was a little too brown. I used the blender to mix the eggs into the cream cheese, but I used the whisk to add the sour cream to prevent over mixing.  This is a fabulous recipie and an excellent choice for anyone wanting to make an authentic NY style cheesecake.  LOVE IT!

Made this for Easter Sunday, and it was FANTASTIC.  It was rich and creamy, with the perfect "diner" cheesecake texture.  Better than the famous cheesecake store in Brooklyn. Never bothered to make a topping for it, was delicious plain.  I followed the others and used 2 tbl. flour, baked it in a 10" springform pan (9" would be too small) and had a 9x13 pan with boiling water on the bottom rack.  Not one crack!! I kept it in the oven for 3-1/2 hours and chilled it overnight.  My Dad and Husband both agreed, I can now throw out all of my other cheesecake  recipes. Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful recipe with me.

I baked this cheesecack the first time exactly like the directions and got some bad cracks. So I tried to help it out by mixing in a tsp. of starch to the batter just before pouring it in the pan. it came out great. I also just let it sit in the oven about 4 hours and then put it in the fridge. It came out beautiful.

Wow, I was really disappointed!  I love cheesecake, so I was really looking forward to trying this one.  I made the recipe exactly as written, with the exception that I baked mine in a bain marie.  It looked fabulous.  No cracks anywhere.  It also lacked taste!  It was very creamy...almost too creamy for a cheesecake.  It really resembled a "no-bake" cheesecake in texture, although it was completely cooked through.  The flavor was just bland.  I attibute this to the addition of flour (which probably helps keep it from cracking) and perhaps no lemon in the recipe.  It was edible, and my company said that even bad cheesecake was good...but I will not be making this cheesecake again.  I've made lots of cheesecakes, and this wasn't a favorite.

AMAZING Cheesecake.  I did alot of research before though, and took into account MANY of the tips shared by other uses.  This led to a great cheesecake!!  I used a different crust recipe thatis mentioned many times in reviews: 1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 cup sugar.  I baked the crust alone for 12 mins at 325 and then let it cool some while making the filling.  I did grease both the bottom AND the sides of my pan.  I made sure all my ingredients were at room temp, I lowered the baking temp to 325 and baked for 60 mins and then just kept oven door shut and let it sit the full 6 hours.  I beat the cream cheese w/sugar ONLY until smooth, then folded in everything else by hand with a wooden spoon and I also let the batter rest for about 15 mins after mixing before I put ontop of crust. I debated reducing the flour, because I didnt want a "cake like" texture, but I didnt end up reducing it and it was fine!! Very silky!  I did the water bath using my roaster pan and added about 1" of HOT water. I wrapped my springform in 3 layers of foil, but it wasnt good enough, water still seeped in. I was SO upset, but it actually setup great in the fridge overnight and you couldnt even tell the next day!  Topped with chocolate shavings. Took to a family function and every person raved about it.  Sure winner!!

I never thought about making my own cheesecake until I left home to go to school in Gainesville, and was distressed at the discovery that there was no Cheesecake Factory up here. So I Googled a few recipes, and thought this one looked pretty good, and sure enough, my cheesecake came out amazing, if I do say so myself, particularly for my first time making it! I made it for my friends and they all loved it. I didn't leave it in the oven for the recommended 5-6 hours after baking (I live in a dorm so I couldn't hog the oven for that long), I only had it in there for two, but it still came out scrumptious. The other reviewer's tips came in handy too- THANKS!
EDIT: I decided to make this cheesecake again, but for my boyfriend this time. I know he likes his cheesecake really creamy, so I decided to try leaving out the flour. He took one bite and proclaimed it perfect. Still the same scrumptious taste, just creamier. So my suggestion is, if you like your cheesecake on the creamy side, leave out the flour. If you like it more cakelike, flour is good. Also, like another reviewer, I changed up the crust and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter, which really improved the crust, as it was a little boring before, and I baked for an hour at 325 degrees rather than 350, and it looked much nicer when it came out the oven than before. (It's never cracked for me, but it would always come out a little too browned on the top, the lower oven setting did the trick!)

I tried this recipe just on a whim, instead of using my usual recipe.  This was horrible.  It did not have a normal cheesecake flavor and for some reason it was very grainy.  Plus, it fell before I even opened the oven door.  The crust wasn't very good either.  Maybe I should put my recipe on here, and give people a good recipe.

This was wonderful, my husband doesn't usually eat cheese cake, but he loved it.  For those who are new to baking like me, 15 graham crackers translates to 15 whole graham crackers, not sections.  I highly recommend the Springform pan for a professional look.

I was excited about making this cheesecake since it got so many good reviews. It was terrible I can now understand the negative responses. at first i thought the negative reponses were crazy compared to all the good ones. Mine also cracked turned brown on the edges and taste like an egg. Way too many eggs I think. Also I made this for dessert to take to a friends house and they also thought it was gross. I was embaressed. I will try the cheesecake recipe my friend has who says Its easy and good. It takes cottage cheese Instead of sourcream and way less flour and eggs.

I've never made a cheescake before.  This recipe was simple and turned out really well. Light and fluffy, no cracks.  If you are a cheesecake novice like me, be sure to check out the video and short articles on cheesecake tips... ie  make sure ingredients are at room temperature, don't over mix, wrap your springform pan in foil and then bake in a waterbath.  I had never used a springform pan before- check out the video for a demonstration!  
Enjoy!

This was my first Cheesecake ever and it was great! I'd made it probably 4 or 5 times when I decided to de-fat it. Here's what I did: Three 8oz containers of fat free cream cheese. One 8oz container of Organic full fat cream cheese. Fat Free Sour cream and milk. Instead of sugar, I used Xylitol (natural sugar substitute). For the crust I used 1 cup of Graham Craker crumbs with 1 Tbsp. Smart Balance Light and 1 Tbsp. applesauce. And egg substitute for 1/2 the eggs. I think those are the only adjustments I made. I figured it to be about 2 g of fat per serving and about 200 calories. I actually liked it better than the full fat version! And no one would think it was low fat!

I CANNOT WAIT FOR THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS TO MAKE THIS AGAIN!!!!!!

NEW ADD ON AGAIN:

WHO CARES IF IT CRACKS! ARE YOU GIRLS SERIOUS? IT DOES NOT TASTE ANY DIFFERENT! 

Tonight, as I sit and enjoy my yummy cheesecake in bed now that the kids are asleep, I am writing again to say how great it really is....

Just don't forget to allow at least 6 hours cooling time in the fridge and I like to make it and cut it up then freeze it and we can enjoy it piece by piece over the coming weeks. Here's the old review......

I have never made a cheesecake before & because of the reviews for this one I made it for Christmas. OH MY GOODNESS!! It was the best I ever had. I usually like to go to Cheesecake Factory because they have a great N.Y. Cheesecake. This is BETTER. FYI, It had the tiniest lumps when I mixed it and I thought it would a bit lumpy but no!! Everyone said it was the best they ever had! You could take it out of the oven after 1-2 hours. It will be fine. Also, for the water bath, I just used the broiler pan and filled it with hot water after I put the cheesecake in the oven so as not to spill it and it was fine! 

Chantal, I love you!!

Simple the best!  A few tips:  let all of your ingredients come to room temperature before you start.  And, don't overmix the ingredients.  I used a mixer for the cream cheese, but did the rest by hand.  Last, use the water bath.  Once I did all of this, I had no more cracks!  For best flavor, refrigerate for at least 24 hours before eating.

Great recipe. This came out perfectly. I used a water bath as well when baking. Try this as follows, if you like:

 Wrap the outside bottom half or so of the sping-form pan with a couple layers of aluminum foil before putting in the crust and the filling. When filled and ready for baking put this spring-form pan into a roasting pan and add warm water until it is about 1/2 way up the side of the spring-form pan. Bake in the oven as noted in the recipe. The water moderates the oven temperature and adds moisture which prevents cracking. My cheesecake came out perfectly...!

Thanks. Have a great one.

Ok-I'm TOTALLY going against popular vote here but let me give my 2 cents. I made this &  neither my hubby nor I would take more than 1 bite. It tasted like a mouth full of sourcream & left a funky aftertaste. The crust is also tasteless & doesn't stick together at all. Anyway, to be fair, I decided to make it a 2nd time, just to make sure I didn't do anything wrong the first time around. SAME issues.  I'm just shocked how many great reviews it has received.

I have been baking cheesecakes for a long time and never quite found exactly what I was looking for in a recipe.  This recipe is simple and turns out a cheesecake that is exactly middle of the road - neither heavy nor light. I grease the sides of my pan with butter and ALWAYS use a waterbath. If you are higher altitude like me, you have to leave a cheesecake in the oven for a little bit longer after baking. (Minimum of 5-6 hours although 7-8 is better.) I have heard a lot of comments about not overbeating the batter.  I suggest simply letting the batter rest for 15-30 minutes prior to pouring into the pan.  I generally tap the sides of my mixing bowl to help any air bubbles rise.  (This is a trick my grandmother taught me when we baked cakes together. It helps prevent them from cracking too.)

Wonderful recipe that is so easy to follow and tasted even better than the deli's. I tried  other recipes and this one by far is the BEST. I topped mine with Strawberry Coulis and everybody was raving about it.  I just cut down the sugar to 1 1/4 cup and then made a few changes in the directions to avoid lumps. Mix the cream cheese and sugar together at low speed, using paddle attachments, until completely smooth. Mix in the flour, milk and vanilla. Mix until smooth, scraping down the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Add the eggs one at a time, blending throughly after each addition.Incorporate sour cream. Lumps occur when the eggs are added to the cream cheese mixture too fast, when the bottom of the mixing bowl is not scraped properly or both. Be careful not to overbake cause this will cause cracking. Also, If you do  not have a springform pan, the cake can  be prepared in a 9 X 3 commercial cake pan. In this case, line the bottom with a circle of baking paper before you press in the crust. To unmold, run a thin knife around the inside of the pan, pressing tightly against the side of the pan so you do not damage the cake, to loosen the sides. See Advise section for additional info on cheesecake preparation.

I definitely WILL NOT be making this again! If I do I'll gain three or four hundred pounds! I can't tell you how many cheesecakes I have ruined over the years, but this one turned out beautiful. The trick is not to overcook it. I baked it at a lower temp, and also used the water bath method, and I think that's why it came out so perfect. I reduced the flour to 3TBS for a creamier texture, also. After baking an hour, I let it cool in the oven for another hour and then chilled in the fridge overnight. If you love cheesecake as much as I do, this is the recipe for you! Thanks Chantal!

I've been making this cheesecake successfully for many years now, and I figured it was about time I review it. I love this recipe--it's a perfect base. It comes out picture perfect every time!! After many, many, MANY trial and error sessions and reading MANY reviews, this is what I do:

1. Make sure ALL of your ingredients are at room temperature. This will make them easier to mix so that you don't overbeat the cheesecake.

2. Don't use a stand mixer. Use a wooden spoon and mix everything by hand.

3. Make sure to grease the sides of your pan so the cheesecake doesn't pull and crack as it cools. 

4. I like a less crumbly crust, so I make mine using 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup brown sugar. I then blind bake it so it doesn't get soggy before putting the filling in.

5. After pouring the filling in the springform, place your uncooked cheesecake in a turkey oven bag and then place the whole thing in a larger pan filled with 1 inch of water. The turkey bag makes the water bath so much more manageable and keeps the cheesecake from browning on top.

6. Decrease the temperature from 350 to 325. I've found that the residual heat from cooking at 350 has made some of my cheesecakes souffle on the sides while cooking. It makes for an icky gritty texture.

7. It's not necessary to leave the cheesecake in the oven for several hours after baking. One hour is more than enough.

8. At this point, I usually put cherry pie filling on top (if I do anything else to it at all).

I hope this helps!

@lou earlier today: you can use a quiche or flan dish, or indeed any cake tin - it's just that the cheesecake slides out better from a springform tin. I have made and served cheesecakes in a pyrex flan dish. Or you could use ramekins or muffin cases and make mini individual cheesecakes? ;)

I also believe in water baths.  Its unreal how smooth and full they stay, with NO sinking whatsoever!  I came across this great article for using a water bath - it gives step-by-step photographic instructions.  http://www.cheesecakesmadeeasy.com/the-water-bath-technique/

When I tried this recipe it was the first time I had made a cheesecake and so I was a bit intimidated, however this recipe was so amazing and simple to make. Now when I make it I do make some simple changes, first I don't add the flour so that it comes out with a richer, creamier texture. Secondly I don't put the cake directly into a water bath, instead I fill a pan with water and place it on the lower rack. This technique has the same effect as the  water bath but ensure that the water stays out off the crust and you don't have to waste time with the foil. Finally I grease the sides of the pan before putting in the cake so that it is easier to remove later. I do let the cake sit in the oven for the full 6 hours to cool but you can take it out  earlier if you wish.

Just a couple modifications: I baked mine at 325 instead of 350 (so glad I did- it was perfectly cooked) and used the 1-1/2 cup grahams 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup butter recipe for the crust.  This cheesecake tastes DELICIOUS and even though I usually love fruit on top I preferred this plain!  I used a pan of water on the rack below, never once opened the oven and cooled it inside for probably about 5 hours- NO cracks (yay!).  The only problem I had was that somehow little flecks of the graham cracker crust floated up throughout and to the top of my cheesecake!  I have no idea why this happened but it is not very pretty-looking.  I think next time I will pre-bake the crust to set it first.  Other than that perfect texture and taste- my guests said it tasted like the Chesecake Factory's!

WOW! this cheesecake is sooo good.  if you've overmixed your batter try this:  pour the cheesecake batter into the springform pan and let rest 15min at room temperature (this allow the air bubbles a chance to rise to the surface).  then with one hand holding the spring form pan steady, use the other hand to sharply tap the pan releasing the air bubbles.  if you still see air bubbles on the surface of the batter, lightly smooth out the bubbles with the back of a spoon or a spachila.  repeat as needed (i did this 3x just to make sure i get as many air bubbles as i can).  i also baked mine at 325F for 60min and left it in the oven to cool for about 4hrs and it did not crack.  you can also substitute some of the flour with corn starch to minimize cracking.

I've made this cheesecake twice and received raves from family and friends. Light, creamy and delicious!  In probing the few dissenting reviews I have some comments that are similar to those of other reviewers. First, my cake cracked both times, but I suspect it was because I couldn't resist taking a sneak peak and opening the oven. But if you are using a topping (in my case blueberry topping), no one will ever notice. Second overbeating and/or baking will change the consistency in any cream and egg based recipe. It's just something you learn with practice. Third, I'm from New York City so I am biased toward any "New York Style" cheesecake (i.e. more creamy than cakey.)  Some European style cheesecakes include more flour and have more of a stiff cake-like consitency.  So if that is the kind of cheesecake you prefer than this recipe may not be for you.  Finally, the cake tastes best if it is chilled at least 24 hours.  You need to give it sufficient time set and the flavors to settle.  This is not a cake you should eat the same day, otherwise it will taste "eggy" as some have suggested.  All and all I love this recipe.

I don't even LIKE cheesecake and this is great!  I made this first for my husband's birthday - it was a huge hit.  I just made it again yesterday and, again, everyone loved it.  Three things, in particular, that I read in the reviews by others that I think were very helpful: 1) Use a water bath.  2) Instead of wrapping the pan with foil for the water bath, put it in an oven bag.  What a great idea!  I had absolutely NO problems with the water from the bath seeping into the pan.  3) I used the following recipe for the crust from an earlier review, and it has a really wonderful flavor: 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup finely chopped walnuts, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  
I baked the crust first in the oven for 8 minutes, just to prevent it from getting soggy.  Also, I let the ingredients get to room temperature first.  
This isn't difficult to make, just time consuming (with leaving it in the oven for 6 hours after baking, etc.)  But both of my cakes turned out perfectly, with no cracks.

I would give this ten stars if I could! LOVED THIS! I have never made a cheese cake in my life & what a first! I did follow suggestions of others. I used the crust recipe off of the Graham Cracker Crumb box, mixed sugar & cream cheese with mixer then mixed the rest by hand(being careful not to over mix), greased bottom & sides of springform, wrapped (outside)bottom & sides of pan with foil & used a water bath, & cooked at 325 since I have a dark pan. Cooked until top started to turn light golden. It came out perfect! No cracks. The only thing I would suggest is mixing in all ingredients BEFORE adding the flour. The first time I made it the vanilla & flour formed small brown lumps, but tasted fine. Try it with the "Raspberry Sauce" recipe that is on this site(as someone else suggested). This cheese cake is MAGICAL! Thanks!

This was great tasting cheesecake!  I topped it with the raspberry sauce recipe from this site and it was delicious, everyone loved it!  The cheesecake batter was way too much for a 9 inch springform pan, I had enough batter to fill a 9 inch pie plate also.  Mine cracked but I just filled the crack up with raspberry sauce and nobody knew the difference.

The only thing I would add is the grated zest of 1/4 - 1/2 of a fresh lemon-the lemon zest is an essential flavor in authentic  New York cheesecake. It does not make the cake taste like lemon it just adds a deeper component to the flavor.

I gave this recipe a 4 because of the issues I had with it.  I was disappointed because I followed the recipe to a T and it rose above the pan (I used a 9" springform) and cracked A LOT. I had a huge 1 inch deep X in my cheesecake. I've made cheesecakes before and this has never happened.

However, the taste was DELICIOUS. I will attempt this recipe again because it was that delicious. Hopefully, I have better luck this time.

mine turnee out beautifully, but I did add 1/2 cup more sugar and 1 add'l egg.  I have always been told to use 1/2 c sugar per block of cream cheese (?) don't know where that rule came from.  Also, I followed all the tips for not over mixing, baking slow and also cooling it down at a very slow pace.   Once finished, It did not have even the tiniest crack.  Used this baking/cooling method as taken from other comments on this page.  Baked 375 for 30 minutes, reduced to 250 and baked 90 minutes. (sat a 13x9 pan of water on the rack directly BELOW the rack the cheesecake was on) Turned oven off but left cake in the oven for 1 hour without opening the door.   Opened door, let sit another 30 min.  Finally, moved to counter until cheesecake was at room temp.  Chilled in fridge overnight.   Takes patience but it works!

Well, I thought this cheesecake was amazing. I've read some bad reviews and I was shocked that someone could say something bad about this recipe.. I have been to some really good bakery's In my town of sacramento and even san francisco this recipe if performed correctly could beat or tie with some of the best. It was actually my second time making a cheesecake the first time i was like 9 years old and well i over cooked it because it was so jiggly in the middle..lol.. Now i know better... Well I definitely used the water bath and I definitely had my ingredients at room temperature.. I also didn't over mix. I creamed the sugar and the cream cheese together and hand mixed the rest. I also only left in the oven for 2hrs and it didn't crack.. It turned out perfect after another 2hrs in the fridge i covered it with chocolate ganache . .. A recipe i found on here.. then I just melted some white chocolate for decoration.. next time I will say I will make a thicker crust..  I like a thick crust thats just me.. I also did grease my pan before I cooked  . . I took this cake to a baby shower and they thought i bought it from a bakery and couldn't believe that I made it. . . . I actually took a pic of it.. and posted it on here.. I LOVE this site... Anyone who wrote a negative comment about this recipe is absolutely certifiable. . . . j.k =)

OK, mine cracked.  2 big cracks that crossed each other in the center.  If you are a beginner, ABSOLUTELY FOLLOW THE RECIPE TO A TEE!!!  I was so impatient that I opened the oven while it was baking (at least 2x) and opened it again several times as it was cooling.  There you go, I got punished for it.

The cheesecake will rise over the pan as it bakes, DO NOT PANIC, DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN.  The cheesecake will have a jiggly, wet looking middle, DO NOT PANIC, DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN.

WHAT EVER HAPPENS, DO NOT OPEN IT!

Thanks to Chantal for this recipe.  I am now the cheesecake queen around here.  My coworker's five year old daughter loves me because I make her cheesecake.  For hers, I melt a half a bag of rollo caramel candies with one can of sweetened condensed milk and stir it into the cheesecake just before I bake it.  She loves it.  I also use ginger snaps in my crust for a little kick, and substitute half of the vanilla for lemon juice.  Just some tweaks, but you don't really need them. This is a great recipe, even for people who aren't great cooks, like me :)

900 people cant be wrong....this IS the best cheesecake ever! Everyone that ate it commented the same, most more than once.

I did not have any problems with the cake cracking or falling in on itself.  Probably because I followed directions. I greased the pan (including sides) generously and left the cake in the oven after the cooking time was over.  Though I did peek a few times....

I made this recipe for some friends substituting in canned pumpkin for half of the sour cream and adding some cinnamon. It was a delicious creamy "pumpkin cheesecake" recipe everyone loved.

This was the first cheesecake recipe I ever tried and it was great.  I made 2 cheesecakes (with 1/2 regular cream cheese, 1/2 low-fat) for the 4th of July.  I dropped both on the counter a few times before putting them in the oven and didn't end up with any air bubbles.  I forgot to use a water bath on the first one so the sides came up a little and the cheesecake turned out darker in the same amount of time.  It also cracked a tiny bit in the center.  The second cheesecake was perfect.  I used a water bath and the cake retained its shape without cracking at all.  The only thing that I'll change next time is to add more crust along the sides of the pan and maybe add extra butter to make the crust a little more solid.

I can not fault the recipe as its a great one. for my personal taste it was way too rich, the next time i made it i put in 4tbls of lemon juice and some zest and it just hit the spot- stayed rich and creamy but the lemon just added some freshness. Thanks for sharing Chantal.

This turned out great.  I put a pan of water on the rack underneath and I got my first ever cheesecake without a crack on top! The flavor was great, I gave the cheesecake as a gift and now I have other requests for it!

This recipe was excellent. I added my own personal touches to it. It came out great.
Tip: Put a pan of water on the rack under the cheesecake to prevent cracking. Therefore you do not have to let it set for 5-6 hours

From everything I've read, New York style cheesecakes are supposed to be more dense and less creamy than other types of cheesecake, and therefore are not meant to be baked in a water bath in order to produce their unique texture.  Having said that, this is a decent New York style cheesecake. My friends and I generally prefer creamier cheesecakes,though-which are totally different. I make about 20 different cheesecakes and love them all so much that I can't pick a favorite. This is alright, but I've made much better. My oldest daughter loves cheesecakes of all kinds and this is the only one that disappointed her. (If you are happy with this recipe baked in a water bath then go for it! It is your cheesecake after all!)

I am a professional pastry chef, and this recipe with a few modifications is the best cheese cake recipe I've encountered. First off I add a pinch of sugar and cinnamon to the crust. Secondly. I add cream to the batter instead of milk(it is cheesecake after all not light to begin with). Plus I change the cooking temp. To 325' for an hour and 15 minutes. As for the cooling time, it is both stupid and unsafe to leave your cheesecake in the oven 6 HOURS to cool off!! The temperature danger zone is between 41degrees and 141 degrees, leaving it that long in the oven, specially with a highly perishable dessert can kill someone!! I take it out right away cool it for an hour and a half then freeze it it comes out much easier

This cheesecake recipe is wonderful!  On the subject that compelled me to post here, I just can't figure out why "candygirl" would enter a review here when she hasn't even tried the recipe.  She goes on to give another recipe, what's with that?!?

I had never made a cheesecake before, and this one was delicious!  I believe it would be good exactly as written, but I made a few changes as suggested by other reviewers. 1. I made the crust as follows: 1 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 c. butter, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1 T cinnamon. 2. I used a water bath, but did not set the cheesecake down in the water.  I put a 9x13 on a lower shelf in the oven while the oven was preheating and left the entire time cheesecake was baking.  I also wrapped 1 layer of aluminum foil on the bottom and sides of the springform pan, but don't know that this made any difference. 3. I omitted the flour 4. I baked at 300 for 1 1/2 hours 5. I let cool in the oven with water bath for 1 hour, without water bath for 1 hour, on the kitchen counter for 1 hour before putting into the refrigerator.  I topped this cheesecake with "Hot Fudge Sauce I" from this website.  It was very easy and tasted great.  Hope this is helpful!  Enjoy!

Great cheesecake!  I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly except I left out the vanilla and added a third cup of key lime juice and it was SO GOOD!  I think I may have over mixed it because I did get a crack in the middle but it still tasted great.  I also didn't use the water bath because it was my first time making a cheesecake and I wanted to make one without it to see if maybe, just maybe, I didn't need it...guess I do though, lol.  I left it in the oven for five hours and then stuck it in the refrigerator and it was great.  Looked good too except for the crack.  Next time I'll add more key lime juice for more tang.  Great recipe!!




----------------UPDATE------------------------




I've made this so many time and finally got it to where it doesn't crack and get brown.  I bake it at 325 for 15 minutes and then at 250 for 15 minutes and then at 225 for 15 and then 200 for 2 hours and 50 minutes and finally 250 for 10 minutes.  I know this sounds insane but it turned out so beautiful.  I found a recipe online and that is how they baked it so I decided to try it and IT WORKED!!!!!  Hope this helps someone.  I have also heard you can bake them at 200 degrees for around 3 hours.  Haven't tried that though.

Followed directions to the tee with the exception of the water bath, put it in the regfigerator over night, next day night mare, it was not done at all. Went to store bought more cream cheese. Round two did a little more reasearch and discovered that i should have got bath water up to boiling before adding and also that sometimes it can take up to an hour and a 1/2 to cook and that you want about a 3 inch in diameter jiggly center. So exactly 1 and 1/2 hours this took place. I turned the oven off and ran my hot greesed knife around the cake and then shut the oven door for 4 hours, then to the refigerator it went.. the next morning..perfection!!!! I am so glad i did not give up..

I consider myself a cheesecake expert and this is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten, let alone not buying it in a 5 star restuarant, but making it myself.
I followed the directions EXACTLY and it almost looks uncooked, when I took it out of the oven, but it was PERFECT! No cracks and you had the pull the fork through your mouth is was so creamy and rich!!! Make sure you really cover the pan with foil, because I had some water seep in, but truly it didnt matter. Will make this again and again as my ONLY cheesecake recipe!   ADDITION: I made this for the second time and put a pan of boiling water on the rack UNDER the cheesecake AND IT CAME OUT PERFECT, no cracks no water and I left it sit in the oven for 5 hours~~~! THE PERFECT RECIPE!!

This was the first cheesecake I had ever dared to make and it was amazing. I used a bit more vanilla extract cuz I love the creamy flavour and using my mixmaster made it so easy. I made two this weekend and now have orders to make more. As the other reviews say be very careful not to overmix the mixture and make it airy otherwise it gets bubbles on the top. I served mine with a Raspberry Coulis. Fantastic.

I used a 10" springform and it was fine. I did do the 12 graham craker,1/4c. sugar, 1/4c. butter crust some suggested with nice results-no pre baking like some.  I did do the water bath in my broiling pan- so not too deep but something went very right! I also cut it, once it was chilled, with dental floss.  Hold it taught and pull it downward through the cake and then let go of one side and slide it out the crust and repeat.  The slices lifted right up..it looked so professional!!
Oh yeah, and it tasted great too! Easy to make (and easier to eat)

Hi cooks! I have reviewed this recipe a couple of months ago and it has been my favourite cheesecake recipe so far. I have used it as a base of other flavors of cheesecakes like Bailey's Pecan Nuts, also strawberry cheesecake with chocolate crust. they both came out perfect and my friends and my husband loved it so much they were actually moaning as they ate!!!I would like to also suggest for making double super extra sure that the cake is not lumpy, I go the extra mile and sieve the filling mixture before adding nuts or anything chunky that owuldn't get thru the sieve. If you have any lumps in the filling, it helps and makes your cake really smooth like a pro chef!!! Well, if I have tricked my friends to think I am a pro, so can you!! :) Cheers!

Yummy, well it was very easy to make and i actually made some mini ones too. Mine cracked but i think that is because i kept sticking my nose in the oven door to smell it!! This will be a family fav for years to come. I recommend using a good brand of graham crackers so that you can be sure that the crust is as good as the cake. Also make sure you add the eggs as late as you can so that you mix them the least

This is a great recipe! The first 2 time I made it, I forgot to put in the sour cream, but it still came out good. My mom and neice enjoyed it so much, they keep on requesting it. Yesterday, I tried it a 3rd time--this time with the sour cream and WOW! This is the best cheesecake ever! So creamy and rich, so please make sure you don't forget the sour cream. This is what makes this cheesecake silky and smooth. Also my suggestion is to cream the cream cheese and sugar together with a hand held mixer on low and after that, mix everything else in by hand. This will prevent air bubbles in your mix which will reduce cracking. My search for the perfect cheesecake recipe is over! Thanks so much Chantal!

Wow! I have never made a cheesecake before, so this was my first. I made it to go along with Thanksgiving dinner. I got so many compliments, I will definitely be making this again!!

I did everything the same except I used 1 1/4 cup graham crackers with 3 tablespoons of butter, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. I baked the crust for 10 minutes then let the pan cool while I was mixing up the cheesecake ingredients. The crust definitely needed sugar. I made a really easy strawberry glaze for the top. Also I didn't have a pan large enough to use for a water bath so I used a disposable aluminum pan with 1 inch of hot water in it. I put it on the rack beneath the cheesecake and it didn't crack, sink, or burn. Thanks so much Chantal...my whole family thanks you!

Great cheesecake!  I wanted to add some lemon, but didn't have it so I stuck to the recipe.  Next time I won't change a thing!  I forgot to grease the pan so was very worried, but it turned out perfectly!  I thought I would have a crater in the middle because toward the end of baking, the sides rose but the middle didn't.  When it cooled the sides fell back down and it looked perfect - NO CRACKS!!!

I'm EXTREMELY scatter-brained. And even with all the mistakes I made, the recipe turned out perfect. This was my first cheesecake, and I wasn't very good at making my crust, but it was okay. I baked mine in a water bath and put it in the oven. I stared at it fondly for a few seconds before I realized, to my horror, I forgot to put in the flour. So I added the 1/4 cup right there into the cake itself and messily stirred it in. I had this sinking feeling in my heart "This is going to turn out horrible." After one hour I turned the oven off and let it stay there overnight.  In the morning I took it and put it in the fridge to have for dessert later at dinner. My family raved, It tasted fantastic. I bet if made it again, without any mistakes, it would taste even better.

This recipe has made me known as the cheesecake master at my work.  Every time someone's birthday rolls around they ask me to make it for them.  I add cinnamon to my crust and have topped off the cake with fresh strawberries and a chocolate drizzle before.  Every time the cake turns out beautiful!  Don't think I will ever try a different recipe after this one!

WONDERFUL!  I've made only one other cheesecake in my life (which was awful), but this one turned out absolutely gorgeous.  I did have to try twice and make a few high altitude adjustments, but the 2nd attempt was PERFECT!  My son is a "cheesecake officianado" at only 12 and he loved it on his birthday.  Will definitely be making this one again and again and again!
*high altitude* Use 1/4 c. butter in crust; subtract 1Tbs sugar for each 2000 feet; bake at 325 for one hour, cool in oven for 3 hours and then in fridge; make sure ingredients are at room temp and don't use an electric mixer past creaming the cheese... blend by hand.  PERFECT, I promise!

DH says that I make the best cheesecake now!  Thanks Chantal!  I followed the other members' tips on using a water bath and leaving it in the oven until it cools down.  For those that don't know, it is essential that the water be boiling when you place it in the pan for the water bath.  The steam is essential for keeping the top moist.

Not good...not good at all. first of all, the crust was way too thick, i used the recomended amount of graham crackers and the crust was twice as thick as it should have been and yes..i used a 9 inch spring form pan that i bought for my daughter's bday as she requested cheesecake and i had never made one before. the top was brown, yes, brown, and it cracked (which i didnt care about that) but the worst part was the taste, it didnt even taste good. not good at all, thick and pasty with no flavor. i ended up buying a cheesecake from our local bakery and it was delicous. i dont know what i did wrong when making this. i would really like to know.

I made this last week for my hubby's bday. I followed the instructions to the T. No water bath like all the reviews had suggested. My cheesecake rose and cracked, I wasn't too upset because I had made a strawberry rasberry purée for the top so you couldn't see it. My husband Loved it! He said it was delicious , me not so much. I couldn't pin point what it was that wasn't making me do back flips. It was good but not great. Not 4,000 reviews 5 star great. Sunday my mother inlaw asked if I would make the cheescake again because she loved it. I was reluctant but decided to please her, this time the only things I did different was add a Lil sugar to the crumbs and candied pecans yum! And I also did the water bath. Oh mY GoodNess!!!!! It was like heaven, creamy velvety smooth melt in my mouth awesomeness everyone went absolutely bananas! This recipe is definitely now a keeper and 5 star worthy! So glad i gave it a second chance.

Great cheesecake.  Would be 5 star rather than 4, except for the crust.....only 2 tablespoons of butter for all of those graham crackers is pretty much nuts.  Dry as dust....triple the butter, and it's perfect!

I've been making cheesecakes for 40 years and I didn't care for this one at all - sorry.  I like cheesecakes that are dense, creamy and smooth but this one was light, fluffy and almost grainy.  Also, it didn't have much flavor.  I think all the milk and flour ruined the taste.  Guess I'll go back to my old standby recipe or I might try another recipe on this site.

Wow.  Just wow.  I made two fo these for a wedding, an it was raved about.  I made one gluten-free by changing the crust and using gluten-free flour, and it didn't taste any different from then "normal" one.  Perfect texture, taste, directions, everything.  No cracks, bubbles or anything.  Will be making this again soon.

OK...WOW!!!!  This is one delicious cheesecake.  One minor change; I substituted 1-can sweetened condensed milk for the sugar...It makes for a more creamy texture.  I also baked it in a moist oven (place a large pan of hot water on the rack directly below the cheesecake about 20 minutes prior to putting the cheesecake in the oven -- this warms up and creates moisture in the oven).  I baked it for 1-hour without opening the oven then when I turned the oven off I left the cheesecake in the oven for 5-hours then refrigerated it.  It came out perfectly and was sooo yummy.  BTW, do not overbeat the mix otherwise the cheesecake will crack.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone was very impressed. I topped mine with cherry pie  filling and it was beautiful as well as delicious. From other reviews I recommend the following. Double wrap the outside rim of the spring form  pan with foil and put in water bath. Definately no peaking in the oven and allow to cool six hours in oven. Ingredients should be room temperature and not over mixed. I used an electric hand mixer and mixed the cream cheese and sugar until smooth. The rest of the ingredients were hand mixed with a wooden spoon. Also don't add vanilla and flour at the same time to avoid brown lumps in batter.

I, too, have been baking cheesecake for years and while this is not my favorite, it is an excellent cake for those who are not skilled in making cheesecakes.  

The taste is very good, if not slightly on the 'eggy' side as some have noted.  A hint of lemon zest and tablespoon of the juice of a fresh lemon.  This makes the taste fresh and summery.  As for the cracks, it is imperative one not open the oven during baking and do not open the oven until it has come to room temperature once more.  A water bath is almost a must in most cheesecakes.  It is too difficult to prevent cracking otherwise.  This yields a creamy consistency throughout and no cracks.

I tried to make this recipe into cupcakes for Christmas but they all cracked and tasted horrible! Worst of all it was late at night and I had to quickly make something else to bring the following morning and I only got about an hour of sleep! I don't think I'll ever bother to try to make this into a whole cheesecake, I'll just try another recipe. update: Try Alton Brown's Sour Cream Cheesecake at food.com. perfection. you can watch the episode of him making it on youtube!

I'm going to have to decline joining the fan club on this one.  I have made cheesecakes for years and have experienced splits before but never as bad as this.  It ran all the way across.  The taste was fine but not all the rave that I read about, in my opinion.  I expected better of a cheesecake recipe that tied up my oven for over 7 hours.  I will stick with my "old faithful" cheesecake recipe and not make this one again.

Wish I could rhapsodize about this recipe, but I cannot.  It not only cracked, it split wide open, was the worst damage I've ever had making a cheesecake.  I've never used milk in a cheesecake recipe, nor have I used flour.  I don't know if adding these made the results so much worse-appearing than other recipes I tried, but... In addition, this cake was too "custardy" tasting and not dense like a NY cheesecake.  I'll just keeping looking, as this one is not the "one for me."

The cheesecake was just O.K. I followed the recipe exactly. The cheesecake cracked, which was fine because I decided to put blueberries on top. The texture was pretty good, but overall it was just mediocre. I will not make this cheesecake again.

OK true story. The night before Thanksgiving my cat ate the middle out of my cheese cake while it was cooling on our deck. So 5 ***** from him. I whipped together a new batch (once I could see through my blurry, tear soaked, eyes again) and the rest of the family equally gave this 5 stars. Thank you for the great recipe!        
UPDATE; 1/2016 This has become a family tradition and is often requested for Easter and birthdays as well as Christmas. This year, for a change, I added the zest and juice from a large lemon and it was, dare I say, even yummier! Today I will be attempting a pumpkin swirl version.

This is the best cheesecake recipe I have ever made, and I have made MANY cheesecakes!  It does have to bake a bit longer than the recipe says (think 15-20 minutes longer), but I place a sheet of aluminum foil over the top to prevent it from browning.  It always comes out perfect, and is very popular at parties and get togethers!  Thanks for this one!

I use digestive biscuits instead of graham crackers and Quark cheese instead of sour cream, but otherwise follow the instructions exactly. I was a bit worried the first time about leaving it in the oven for 5-6 hours because I have an electric oven that takes ages to cool down and I thought the cake might burn--but it never does, turns out great every single time. Wonderful taste and texture, never a crack. I make this fairly often and it's always a big hit. Edited to add: I made this (as usual) for Christmas this year, but used ginger cookies in the crust instead of digestive biscuits. It was even better than usual!

Delicious! Since we like a creamy cheesecake, I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used only 2 TBS of flour. DH loves it- says it's the best cheesecake ever! It is already a family favorite- I was requested to make this cheesecake for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and another party this week!

This recipe is the best.  I have found if i put a bowl of water under the cake in the oven, it helps it not to crack. Also, you have to use the right size pan or it will crack.  The batter should be right at the top of the cake pan.  MMMMMMMM

okay, my first attempt (ever) at a cheesecake (mildly successful baker otherwise) & we're talking uber success here!!  I even used Splenda and it turned out amazingly well; also added a Blueberry Sauce to marbleize it (1 pint fresh blueberries, 2 tsp of AP flour, and 2 tbsp of Splenda= place in sauce pan, bring to boil, allow to boil for 5 minutes and then remove from heat.  mash roughly and then pour 3 tbsp over half of cheesecake batter in springform pan.  add remaining batter, then finish w/ 3 more tbsp of sauce to top.  run tip of knife over top to 'marbleize' it.  serve w/ rest of sauce).  It was a huge success, I can't thank you enough!!  :-)

Thank you for a Great Cheesecake Recipe!  I loved it!  Good texture, beautiful color, wonderful taste and easy to make!  I used a 9-inch springform pan, placed a 9 x 13 pan filled half way with very hot water UNDER the springform pan, cooled it in a "unique" way and had NO CRACKS!!!  Here's what I did:  As suggested by several reviewers, I made sure ALL of my ingredients were at room temperature.  I greased the bottom AND sides of my springform pan, and set the oven at 325.  I combined the cream cheese and the sugar with my mixer and then stirred everything else by hand.  I then used the mixer again for about 1 minute.  I also used the crust recipe from the box of Honey Maid graham cracker crumbs, and added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and even a pinch of ground cloves.  I baked it for exactly 1 hour, left it in the oven for another hour, then removed the 9 x 13 pan.  It sat another hour and a half in the oven, and then I put it on a table in the GARAGE!  It was much cooler than the house, but not as cool as the refrigerator!  After about 2 hours, I put it in the fridge until ready to serve (about an hour).  PERFECT!  No cracks, beautiful color, wonderful taste AND a hit for my friend (from New York!).  It did taste better the next day (my friend let me take 2 slices home!), but was still quite yummy the day it was baked!  Great Recipe!

AllRecipes never fails me when I'm looking for high rated recipes!  I followed the tips exactly: 1) brought my ingredients to room temperature; 2) was careful not to overmix; 3) made the crust with 1 1/2 c graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 c melted butter, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, and 1/4 c sugar (next time i might try baking it in the oven first or sticking it in the fridge to get it to harden); 4) used the water bath with boiling water (even though my springform was wrapped in foil, I think the water still seeped through and sogged up the outer rim of my crust; 5) baked it at 325 for an hour; and 6) let it sit in the oven for the evening (about 4 hours).  Results: absolutely delicious and no cracks!  It was soft and rich in flavor.  My co-workers loved it and told me it was better than a NY deli!

This is a nice simple Cheesecake. I added canned cherries to the top when serving. It was great for our family get together. Contrary to what one reviewer said about cheesecakes they are NOT supposed to crack and all cheesescakes should be cooked in a water bath. She should know this as a professional baker.

This was only the second one I've made and it received rave reviews!  I added 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel for a hint of flavor, and used the water bath (put the springform pan in another pan with about 1" of water in it (after wrapping the bottom of the s/f pan in foil to prevent water seeping into the cake) then put all into the oven for baking.  This is supposed to keep the cake from cracking, which apparently it did.) for baking.

Wow..Seriously. I haven't made a ton of cheesecakes but this is the first one I didn't crack. Incredibly easy and tasty (eating it as I type this).  I stayed pretty true to the recipe but here are my minute deviations:  I mixed the graham and butter in my spring form pan then once pressed in place I wiped down the sides of the pan to get the crumbs and RE-SPRAYED WITH COOKING SPRAY. I did all of my mixing in the mixer like the video--my cream cheese sat out of the fridge for several hours to make sure it was soft..that is the key with cream cheese recipes.  I mixed the cream cheese and the sugar on high until it was thoroughly smooth and the rest I did on low for only as long as needed to mix. I also scraped down often. I poured half the mixture into the spring form pan then scrapped the bowl and mixed it a few seconds by hand to make sure anything I scrapped was mixed so I didn't have a splotch of cream cheese.  The next part is where I deviated the most: I put the cheese cake in the middle rack and a deep pan on the next rack directly under it (not sitting in it).  I filled the pan with hot water.  Since the oven was open while I did that (losing heat) I turned it off and back on to make it fire up right away and added 2 minutes to the time.  62 minutes baking and turned it off (DID NOT OPEN IT) and let it sit for 5 hours.  The hardest part of this recipe is having watch it through the oven door for 5 hours!

I've tried many cheesecake recipes and this one tops them all. It is like a deli New York cheesecake. It is dense but creamy. I did not bake it in a water bath, I placed a pan of boiling water under it. I had a nice golden brown top and absolutely no cracks. (I greased the sides of my pan). This cake is not too rich! It would be great with a chocolate ganache or any topping really. I'm saving this recipe in my family recipe box.

The reviewer who said the temperature was too high is correct.  I just made this cheesecake and as it is cooling, enormous cracks appeared. Cracks are OK but brown edges and a dry texture is not.  I am not a novice baker and should have reviewed other recipes I have made. However my son preferred a "classic" cheesecake to a flavored one and I was sucked in by the positive reviews of the classic cheesecake.  I recommend baking at 300, not 350.  Oh well, will dress this cheesecake up with a strawberry topping.

Loved it! I had a bad experience the first time I tried to make a cheesecake in a springform, and because of that, haven't attempted one for a long, long time. So happy to have come across this. Simple, straight forward and oh-so-yummy! I did want something more than just a plain cheesecake, so I added eight ounces of melted (and then brought to room temp) Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate.  I can't wait to play around and try some other variations!

I have baked several cheesecakes and thought I would try this because of the many good reviews. About 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for directions. It can work with modifications. But not without.
1. Temperature too high, will burn. Try 325 or 300 degrees.
2. Crust measurements off, will be crumbly.Try 8 whole graham crackers.
3. Flour should not be added at end, will be lumpy. Try adding in with sugar.
4. Do not bake without steam bath or water bath, will bake unevenly and crack.

I made some revisions due to lack of correct ingredients and this came out fantastic... and very light for a cheesecake!!  I used 2 bars NON-FAT cream cheese and 2 bars LIGHT cream cheese, I used BLUE DIAMOND ALMOND MILK, I substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream, I used the seeds from a vanilla bean because I ran out of vanilla liquid, and finally, I FORGOT to add the flour!  Next time I make this, I'm gonna try using ALL fat free cream cheese and splenda for the sugar... I will let you know how it turns out, but thanks for the great recipe!!

Almost 5 years ago I searched the net for a cheesecake recipe for I had never made one before and I wanted to give it a try. So, I found this great recipe made very few alterations that were proposed by reviewers and made my first cheesecake, not only was it a BIG hit but my family won’t eat any other cheesecake elsewhere !!
these alterations are
the crust should be made as follows
1& 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
Also, 
make sure you grease the sides of the springform pan and not just the bottom,
make sure all ingredients are around room temperature, otherwise the batter will be lumpy,
and 
overbeating will cause a cheesecake to crack and have the wrong texture so beat the cream cheese with sugar only until smooth  then proceed with a wooden spoon for the rest of the recipe. 
i would also like to state that this recipe is PERFECT as it is and does not need a water bath and the baking instructions should be followed to a T.
hope this was useful and wish you enjoy :)

Wonderful Recipe..... I have never rated any recipe in the past but I could not help myself from writing.... It has worked out to be a perfect New York style cheese cake.... I followed few changes they are as follows: 1) I used all ingredients at room temperature..2) water bath is a must 3) I baked the crust at 475 F for 10 mins before poring the mixture 4) used 2 tbsp of flour to make it creamy 5) just kept in the oven for cooling for an hour after baking and transfered to the refrigerator.... Am sure no one will fail if these steps are followed....

SO I've made this cheese cake just once. And It was perfect. The only thing that I changed was the whole 6 cooling time in the oven. I let mine cool in the oven with the door open for about 1 hour and it turned out just fine with no cracks. As a matter of fact my family asked me to make for Christmas this year.

I would like to make this as cupcakes. Has anyone ever tried that? Please let me know. Thanks.

I have made this recipe at least 12 times and never had any crack. I have done several variations of it but I always cook it in a water bath. Wrap the springform pan with 3 layers of foil to prevent leaking and NEVER open the oven! The best variation I have found is instead of milk, I use heavy cream. It makes it much smoother. I have made this for family and several work meetings and there is never any left.

I made cheesecake from this recipe as I had lost the recipe I'd been using for years and this one seems similar.  I did remember that my old one had lemon in it and I squeezed half a lemon and reduced the milk by the amount of juice I had.  Then shredded and added the lemon peel.  It was out of this world!

JUST AMAZING!!! Best cheesecake recipe! So creamy, consistent in texture and most of all, always moist. Easiest and yet the most foolproof recipe. I spent a few months searching for the best cheesecake recipe, and found nothing good until I tried this. 

My tips: Mix everything with a wooden spoon(for stiffer items like the cream cheese) and hand whisk(once mixture becomes more easy to work with) only until just combined - working with an electric mixer may cause things to unnecessarily over-mix. 

For a light texture, use 160C (for fanforced oven); and for a denser yet not dry texture use 150C (fanforced too). 

I used to leave it in the oven for 6 hrs before taking it out, but recently I took it out after 3 hrs of cooling and it was set already! So I let it cool further at room temperature, poured my  then popped it in an airtight container into the fridge. 

Next, ALWAYS REMEMBER to grease the sides of the tin so the cake can pull away from the sides on cooling. 

For the springform pan, simply turn the base upside-down and clip it back on before using so that you won't have to try prying the sides to lift the cheesecake out and produce a potential disaster. To add to this, always make sure the cheesecake is completely chilled overnight before lifting it out - if it's only half-chilled it may crack when you try to lift it out.

Bake the crust so that it won't turn soggy.

These some good points I've gathered after experimenting with this recipe over the past year.

A.MA.ZING.
This cheesecake is fantastic! I made it a week ago and baked it without a water bath and it cracked and browned. I made it again using a water bath and it came out PERFECT. Those who ate it said it was better than one they get from a popular bakery. Don't let cheesecake intimidate you! Use a water bath and follow cheesecake tips on this site and you'll have a delicious dessert that looks professional!

This was alright, but I won't make it again. The cream cheese mix tasted like dry vanilla ice cream. It was creamy, but dry and essentially flavourless other than the vanilla. I added chocolate sauce to the top, but the cake itself was too dry and not like the cheesecakes that are so creamy and soft and delicious. Mine didn't crack and I used half the flour stated. Next time I'll make one that is creamier and has more flavour.

This is a phenomenal cheesecake recipe. I have been seriously baking for the past 3 years, but was always scared to attempt a cheesecake. This recipe was very simple to follow, and tasted delicious!  The first time I made it, it had a seismic crack running down the middle. I was discouraged. But I realized I had overmixed the batter. So, the next time, I only used the hand mixer to beat in the milk. Everything else I mixed in with a few turns of a wooden spoon, and voila! I made a perfectly uncracked cheesecake!  I topped this cake with a chocolate ganache (2 cups semi sweet chocoloate chips, 2 tbsp butter, and 1 cup heavy cream (boiled with butter and poured over the chips..then whipped until blended)

This recipe is amazing!!  I have nothing but compliments when I serve it.  My only issue though is it always crack.  I've tried following several other peoples suggestions but it still always cracks.  I cover my cheesecake with a thawed bag of frozen mixed fruit and then no one knows.  Sooo yummy!!

Tips to make this come out nicely: Once the cream cheese and sugar are in. Slowly beat the eggs in until just barely combined. Then with a spatula gently mix in the other ingredients.

It cracked, even reading 100 reviews of how not to make it crack.  Whether it looked good or not, it tasted wonderful!  So really....who cares if it cracks or not.  Put a strawberry over the crack.  No one will know or care after eating it.

This cheesecake is hands-down the BEST cheesecake I have ever eaten! I have made this cheesecake following the recipe exactly 2 times, and each time, my husband and I, along with our guests, could not stop raving about it!  A few tips for a perfect looking cheesecake that I  found on this site: 1) Let all ingredients come to room temperature!  I took all cold ingredients out of the fridge 4 hours before I began to assemble the recipe. 2) Mix the entire recipe by hand!  I used a mixer the first time, and my cheesecake had huge cracks in it (which did not affect the taste, but ruined the look of the cheesecake) 3) DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR DURING OR AFTER BAKING!!!  As another reviewer said, set the timer for 60 minutes, turn off the oven after the timer goes off, and DO NOT open the door AT ALL until the cheesecake has sat undisturbed for 6 hours. 4) I used a water bath to make my cheesecake.  I wrapped the outside of my springform pan in aluminum foil, placed it in a metal roasting pan, and poured very hot (right before the point of boiling) water about 1 inch up the side of my springform pan.   This is the perfect recipe and method for making the cheesecake, and I hope that all of these tips help!

It was perfect! no cracking and the flavor was excellent. Im a beginner baker and i dont have all those fancy supplies like the round springfoam pan but i didnt let that scare me off. I used a squared glass 8 inch pan and i lined it with parchment paper. I proceded by following all the instructions and when it was finally done i just pulled it right up from the pan and topped it with strawberries and raspberry sauce

So yummy and easy to make!  I did add just a bit of lemon zest into the cheesecake mixture, and then sprinkled some lemon zest on top....so pretty!

Great cheesecake. I followed the directions EXACTLY as written which I wish more members would do first before they review any recipe. In any event the only change I will make NEXT time is to add 4 tablespoons melted butter to the crushed graham crackers. This will help the crust to be less crumbly after baking. Also one technical tip with the recipe. The recipe calls for 15 graham crackers. The recipe is not specific as whether this is 15 graham cracker "sheets" or 15 pieces. There are 4 pieces on a sheet. Being an experienced cook I realized the 15 "sheets" were needed. I say this because a inexperienced cook may be tempted to use 15 pieces which would yield very little crust. Thanks for a GREAT recipe

As a professional baker and pastry chef I try a lot of recipes.  I can say without a doubt that this is one of the best baked cheesecake recipes I have come across.  The consistency and flavors are perfect and it lends itself well to variations.

I don't believe I have every given a recipe such a low rating and I hate doing so but this was not good at all. I followed the recipe to a "T" and I was first disappointed with the way it looked, it was way too brown on top , almost burnt looking and it had one tiny little crack in it. I did turn oven off after 1 hour. I was relieved when I cut into the cheesecake, it looked good, smooth and creamy. I took one bite of it and put the plate down, so did my husband and daughter. The texture in my mouth was similar to cottage cheese, not as lumpy though. I was very disappointed with the taste. I will not be making this again. Sorry.

This is everything a NY cheesecake should be. Tall, dense, rich, creamy. I baked mine with a pan of hot water on the shelf below the cheesecake - this step helps to enhance the creamy texture. The only change I will try next time is baking at 325 as my edges came out a little brown. This recipe is a keeper though - one that will be treasured!

This was better than deli cheesecake! The texture's perfect and it's not as rich as most cheesecakes so, you can actually finish your slice without feeling sick! lol Mine cracked but, I didn't try the water bath and my ingredents weren't quite to room temp, yet. THE BEST cheescake, though...THE BEST!

This was my first cheesecake, and it turned out wonderfully!  Followed the recipe exactly, and heeded advice to use ingredients at room temperature, and to not overmix.  Greased the sides of the springform pan, baked for 1 hour at 350 degrees (without water bath), then turned the oven off and left it for about 4 hours until I couldn't stand it anymore and had to crack open the door to see.  Beautiful cake, no cracks at all, top was slightly brown on the edges.  We had a small piece but it wasn't thoroughly cooled, and was much better the next morning after being refrigerated.  The crust was perfect (15 graham crackers, 2 tblsp of butter) and the cake itself is definitely restaurant-quality.  But alas, we're in NYC and Junior's is the standard, so I look forward to more experimentation.  Next time I'll try leaving out the flour and milk, and add another cup of sour cream instead.  

UPDATED 12/10/07 - Add 1 more cup of sour cream and eliminate the milk and flour, and it is perfect.  Oh, and add a lot of PATIENCE because it takes 3-4 days of refrigeration for the cake to meld into that perfect texture of smooth, silky & creamy. 

Another suggestion is to use an oven thermometer to make sure the temperature is accurate.

This recipe is amazing. I served it w/canned whipped cream and sugared strawberries. My guests said that it tasted like it was from the Cheesecake Factory (yay)! I read plenty of the reviews and did the following:  Cooked the cake in a round springform pan. I cut a circle of wax paper for the bottom of the pan. Greased the sides well.  I bought a box of crushed graham crackers (used about 1/2 the box) and added suger, cinnamon and extra butter.  I wrapped the sides and bttm of the pan w/aluminum foil.  Placed a pan of boiling water on the rack beneath the cake for the first hour of cooking only.  Took the pan of water out after one hour and let the cheesecake rest inside the oven(which was now turned off) for 2 hours.  I ran a knife around the sides of the pan and voila: perfection!!  I let the cake set in the fridge overnight. THE BEST RECIPE EVER!

This was absolutely amazing. I've never made a cheesecake before and this was a breeze. I tested my springform pan in the water bath before I filled it and the water gushed in, so I did as another person recommended and put the pan of water on a shelf below. I sprayed the pan with Pam to prevent sticking. It turned out beautifully with no cracks. After baking, I left it in the oven for 5 more hours and then moved it to the fridge. I used 15 full size graham crackers, 4 Tbsp of butter along with 2 Tbsp of sugar and the crust was perfect. I will definitely be making this again and look forward to trying different variations like chocolate chip or pumpkin cheesecake.

To start on a positive note I baked this cheesecake last night and the flavour was great I used the seeds from a vanilla pod  and a small dash of vanilla extract - delicious!  However I can be no more positive than that.  It had a very wet texture and was more like a custard tart than cheese cake.  I'm sorry but I would not recommend this recipe at all.

First time I change 2 pack creamcheese to Low fat creamcheese, and use Low fat sour cream too, cut sugar to 3/4 cup. also add 1tbs lemon juice. 12 servings recipe can fit in 24 muffin pan and 1 x 4.5"cake pan. i bake 350F for 15 mins than turn down to 270F for another 10 mins. My boyfriend and one of my girl friend said this cheesecake so Yummy and sweet enought for them, but I want a little bit sweet so next time i will change the sugar to 1 cup.  Tomorrow i will bring some cheesecake to my old office and I know those ABC like sweet thing, so I add some strawberry topping to make this cake perfect for them.

2nd time i bake in one 6" sprintform pan change recipe to 6 servings  . i put 1 cup of sugar perfect sweet. i also add 1/2 tbs of lemon juice and bake in 350F for 45 mins. next time i will bake 50 mins i think the cake is a lettle bit uncook in the center. but all my friend still love it, they said the center like ice-cream. taste good.

This was my first baked cheesecake.  And it is AMAZING and I don't even like cheesecake!!  If you are wondering if you should try it or not..you absolutely should be thankful that it's on this site.  Waterbath definitely works and chilling the cheesecake afterwards will make it even better and it lasts for long time for you to enjoy.  I used light cream cheese and it still worked for me.

Very good cheesecake recipe.  To prevent cracking place the cheesecake in another pan with 1" of water during baking.  The steam helps to keep it from cracking.  Also, turn the oven off when it is still jiggling in the middle, not completely set.  The reason they crack is because they overcook.

I searched the internet for a recipe and came across this one. I made the crust with crushed pecan sandies mixed with melted butter and all I can say is "aaaah". It is so creamy. I take them to work with me and my co-workers argue over the pieces.

All my girlfriends are mad at me because their husbands are begging them to make "that cheesecake Mandy made". Just make sure to use ROOM temp cream cheese. If you just microwave it, you'll have chunks. It was a REALLY good, classic New York cheesecake... LOVED IT!!!!

This is the 3rd time I have attempted to make a cheesecake, and both times I ended up having a cracked, puffed, soggy cheesecakes. This time, OH MY GOD, the cheesecake came out perfectly, without cracks, dent or soggy bottom. 

For those of you who want a smaller version of this cake. I used a 8 x 1.5 inch regular cake pan, and scaled the ingredients for the filling to half. 

Just like most of the other chefs, I did the waterbath and left the cheesecake in the oven for 6 hours and fridged for 12 hours afterwards. One thing to remeber is that you MUST take out the waterbath immediately after baking is done, otherwise the cake will be over cooked. 

I live in new york, and this cheesecake comes really close to the famous cheesecake place, as a matter of fact, my husband says this cheesecake is even BETTER than the brand name ones.  
Thank you, Chantal!

This was my very first time to bake cheesecake. it was very simple and I'm only a high school student so I haven't had much years of cooking or baking. I followed the recipe exactly but just added sugar to the crust. I did not use water bath but I did lower my temperature to 325degrees because my oven seems to get hotter than other ones. my cheesecake did not crack and it came out perfect. everyone loved it. some people told me it's better than cheesecake factory's. even my mom who doesn't like much sweet food liked it.

The cheesecake tastes wonderful, everyone in my family requests it at every family gathering.  My only issue is that it cracks everytime. I just cover it with whipped cream.

Excellent Cheesecake!! It is so creamy and flavorful!! Great with cherries on top.  You could easily add any good thing to this recipe.  I added  the flour to the sourcream and vanilla. It definitely helped with getting all the lumps out of the batter. 
Will definitely make again!

Absolutely Awesome!!  This recipe is definately a keeper.  I did not have a pan big enough to do the water bath so I put another pan in the oven with water in it while I was baking the cheesecake and there was still no cracks.  I served this with the Supreme Starwberry Topping recipe also found on this site.  Everyone loved both!!

Incredible!  My hubby's uncle said this is better than cheesecake from a restaurant or deli.  This is the first cheesecake I ever made and it is always great.  The first time I made this, I researched cheesecakes and found out the biggest problem is that if they crack they get dried out.  I found a tip to prevent cracks by baking it in a water bath.  Now I always use a water bath and I've never had a problem with cracks.  Wrap the springform pan in foil before placing in the water bath (to prevent water leaking through the cracks in the pan).

CRACKS, CRACKS, and more CRACKS!
I made little changes-for the crust I used 1 3/4 cup boxed graham cracker crumbs mixed with 4tbsp melted butter(I like thicker crust).
I followed all the rest of ingredients  exact but used half heavy cream half milk for the milk mixture.
I even added a bowl of water to the oven to prevent cracking as someone else suggested.  I had cracks as big as my oven.
During the middle of baking I heard a pop and looked in the oven and a piece of the side exploded off the cheesecake all over my oven. This happened three times.  I used a 9" springform and it rose way above the rim by like 3 inches or more.  Next time I think I will use bigger pan or add less of the mixture beacuse it did have a nice cheesecake taste despite all the cracks and explosions.  This is a nice recipe to use if you want to add a nice filling for the top.  All the filling would fall into those huge cracks.
Good news is-I will try again.

I'm not sure if it's because I live in a high altitude area, but this cheesecake was a disaster.  I didn't deviate from the recipe and not only did the cheesecake crack, but it also overflowed and burned.  I used a 9" spring form pan and probably would have been alright if I had used a 10" pan.  I won't be using this recipe again...I have better luck with others.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though the crust was soggy because the cheesecake itself was incredible!  Extremely smooth, rich, cheesy -- everything you want in a cheesecake.  I followed the ingredient directions exactly, but then I baked it in the "no fail cheesecake method":  15 minutes at 400, turn oven down to 200 and bake 3 hours with a pan of water on the bottom shelf of the oven.  When done, turn off oven and prop door open just a crack to allow to cool slowly for one hour.  Then cool completely on the counter before refrigerating.  This baking method will almost guarantee the perfect outcome -- no brown color on top and no cracks.  Great recipe!

Very good cheesecake but I had to tinker with it a little.  I made it 3 different times.  The first time, I made it with low-fat and no-fat cream cheese  and got a HUGE split down the middle and it browned up a lot on top.  I thought it might be the cream cheese so I made another one with regular cream cheese and had the exact same results.  My husband couldn't tell a difference in the taste, but strangely, my daughter and I both liked the low-fat version better.  The third time, I went back to the no-fat and low-fat cr. cheese and I used a water bath (covered the bottom of the springform pan with foil, placed in a pan and filled with boiling water 12 way up the sides of springform pan).  This time I baked it at 325 for 1 hr. and 20 mins.  Removed from oven but left in the water bath for another 10 mins.  Then cooled completely before refrigerating.  It came out PERFECTLY.  No browning and no split.  Finally, a success!!!

I've used at LEAST 20 different cheesecake recipes over the years; this one is the absolute BEST!  Very easy to prepare, and special enough for clients, parties, and such.  Needs no "extras", yet blends well with fruit, chopped candy bars, and other toppings.  Thanks, Chantal!

I have always gotten excellent reviews on my cheescakes and this one was no exception!  I have always had a problem with the top turning dark brown and would cut the top portion off.  This recipe was an answer to that problem.  It was the perfect color on top and it didn't crack.  I used a pan of water on the rack below but only left it in the oven for 1 hour after it was done cooking.  (I ran out of time!) I will definately use this recipe from now on.

I have made this cheesecake over and over again.
The only trouble I had was with the baking.
A few times I made it on 350 degrees and
cooked for 1 hour and let set in oven for
5 hours.  It alway split and looked to be
overcooked.  I just put toppings on it and
it was good.  This last time I made it and
needed no topping so it had to be perfect.
I baked it on 300 degrees for a long time
and let it sit in oven for about 3 hours.  
It did not split and looked perfect. It is
really a good cheesecake.

This is my go to cheesecake recipe.  I have made other cheesecakes that are much more complicated and take a lot longer and I always find myself going back to this recipe.  It is the best! Follow the directions exactly and you will be so pleased.  When my family wants cheesecake, this is the one they are always talking about.

I have never ever, ever, ever made a cheesecake.....way too intimidating.  Then I found this recipe, read a lot of the reviews, and dove in.  I made sure all of my ingredients were at room temp., and I used a water bath.  It was AWESOME!!!!!!! I would love to insert some expletives before "awesome"... But I want "cheesecake-newbies" to read and TRY THIS!  You can do it!  It is  beyond simple, and so creamy.  Razorbackmom24

I have made this cheese cake at least 3 times in the last week and a half......I love it and so does my family. All three times the cheese cake did not crack......The only thing I added was 1/3 cup of lemon juice and zest of half a lemon. This added a little bit more flavor and love it! This is a wonderful recipe that is fool proof if you follow the directions.

Adding my review to the 4,000 already posted because this is the best cheesecake recipe I have ever made. I made minor changes to the ingredients to make it Gluten Free(GF)  The crust: 7oz Schar GF Shortbread cookies, Crumbled in the food processor, added 2 Tbsp brown sugar and 4 Tbsp melted butter. I also substituted 2 Tbsp GF flour for the 1/4 cup flour. Allow all ingredients to reach room temperature. I used my hand-mixer to combine the cream cheese & sugar, then added the milk. I hand-mixed the remaining ingredients carefully.

The key to perfection is the baking. Followed instructions from an old cookbook for preparing the springform pan:  Assemble the pan and liberally coat bottom and sides with butter. Cut a circle out of parchment paper and line the bottom of the pan pressing into the butter. Cut additional parchment to line the sides of the pan, making it 3 inches taller than the pan. Press paper into the buttered sides. Butter the parchment paper and press the crust into the bottom and sides.  Preheat  to 350 degrees and bake the crust for 10 minutes. Remove and allow crust to cool while preparing the cake.  

I followed LaurelC43 cooking instructions. After baking the crust, I lowered the temp to 225 degrees. I do not have a pan large enough to hold my cheesecake, so I put a water-filled pan on the bottom rack. I cooked it for 3 hours, 40 min. Turned off the oven and with a knife loosened the crust from the paper. Closed oven door and left it for 6 hours. PERFECT!

This recipe is the real deal, authentic New York style cheesecake. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it produced something I still can't believe I made. I moved from the US to Australia and have been craving cheesecake factory cheesecake for so long...until now! Never attempted to make one myself before (I didn't even own a spring form pan until I decided I was going to give this recipe a try), so I was a little intimidated, but it was so easy and came out perfectly.  I used an electric hand mixer to mix the cream cheese and sugar ultra smooth and then I used a whisk to hand mix the remaining ingredients to avoid over mixing (as some helpful reviews indicated could cause problems). I honestly don't understand any bad reviews for this recipe. This is as classic NY style as it gets and pretty much foolproof. Chantal, this expat wishes she could hug you! AMAZING recipe!

I have never made Cheesecake before because I always thought it would be a big ordeal. But boy was I wrong. it was actually quite simple. I did as the recipe stated and left it in the oven for 5 hours after the initial hour of cooking. My god was it hard not to peak. But i'm glad I didn't because it turned out beautifully and was absolutely delicious. Thanks for sharing such an easy an ridiculously good cheesecake. This recipe will be kept and made over and over again.

This recipe must be followed to a T in order for it to be a success. It never fails. The texture is perfect and creamy and soft. It has just the right amount of sweetness. My only problem is that it always cracks.

The comments below are great and helpful IF one reads them. However, these extra tips need to be added to the recipe. No where in the recipe does it state to bring everything to room temp or beat only the cheese and sugar and hand mix the rest. It states nothing about using a water bath. This recipe should be written as if this knowledge isn't known. I followed the above instructions exactly. My cheesecake looks like a disaster...browned, cracked. I'm not a cheesecake expert so I'd like a thorough recipe. Next time I will use the comments I should have read before making another cheesecake. And another recipe.

I love cheesecake but have a question.  Can you use a store bought graham cracker pie crust.  If so are there an alterations that I should make?

SWEET CHEEZEUS. 

This was really good!! My guinea pig tasters said it was better than commercially sold ones! -beams- But I must admit, all the credit goes to the recipe! It is really easy to make and turned out so beautifully. 

The only changes I made were: (1) Using 2c digestive biscuits in place of graham crackers; (2) Cutting down 1/4c on sugar; (3) Handmixing after creaming the cream cheese and sugar; (4) Using a water bath. MY CHEESECAKE DID NOT CRACK! -beamsbeams- 

In future, I might take out the cheesecake after 2 hours, 5 hours browned the top too much :\ Also, for those who like a thick layer of biscuit under your cheesecake, the proportions of this one are woefully inadequate! 

Overall, a wonderful recipe, thank you Chantal (:

You can't go wrong with this recipe! Seriously!!!:-) I followed the cooking instructions by Morena. When you click to read the reviews it's the first one that comes up. My cheesecake came out perfect and it was the first time I ever made one.

Great texture and great flavor. I did change a few things but nothing major. I didn't have graham crackers to crush up but I did have a box of graham cracker crumbs. I used 1 cup crumbs, half a stick of butter and 1 T. white sugar for the crust and it was perfect. Instead of vanilla extract in the filling I used vanilla bean paste which tastes better and is prettier (you can see the bean flecks in the cheesecake). Mine did not crack and I took extra precautions to make sure that it didn't - I took care not to overbeat and I used a water bath. I took the advice of one reviewer and didn't check the cheesecake after 1 hr. of baking. I just baked for 1 hr. and then shut the oven off. It was baked perfectly. I did let it cool in the oven for about an hour, then I took it out to loosen the edges and put it back in to finish cooling for about another 2 hours. It did have a slightly eggy flavor and I think I will use a little lemon emulsion next time to take care of that. I will also maybe try dialing down the temp a little bit as the top got a little darker than I wanted. But overall it's an outstanding cheesecake and I will make it again.

My grandkids say this is their favorite food!Only ingredient change I made is to crust. (Use 1 & 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs precrushed bought in baking aisle, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/3 cup melted butter).Mix well in bowl and press on bottom & 1/3 up sides of buttered 9 inch springform pan. (Another reviewer wrote that a 9 inch pan isn't large enough. I've made this 10 times, and it is the perfect size). For cheesecake, bring all ingredients to room temperature then beat as follows with electric mixer: 1st beat cream cheese until smooth, then beat in sour cream, beat in sugar mixed with 1/4 cup flour. Add milk and vanilla and beat again. (Don't overbeat, just beat everything until mixed).  THEN, hand STIR in eggs one at a time until well blended. You don't want too much air, because that causes cracks. Book I read by pastry chef uses different method to prevent cracks without the dreaded water bath: Preheat oven to 350. Bake for 20 minutes. Lower to 300 and bake another 20 minutes. Lower to 250 degrees and bake for 20 minutes. Lower to 225 and bake for 20 minutes.  DO NOT open the door at all during all of this. Now turn the oven off, keep door closed and let it sit around an hour until the oven is cool.Cracks occur when there's a sudden temperature change. This seems complicated, but usually helps to prevent cracks without using water bath.(I tried it the way it is written in recipe, and it did crack).Tastes best when made the day before. Great w/ choc. ganache from this site.

To all the people making this:
You will need a pan that is A LOT larger than a 9 inch. I greased and prepared a nine inch one and when I actually poured it in, it would only fit less than half the batter. 
I am not impressed. I hope the end result will be much better than the process.

Excellent cheesecake. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and made some minor modifications. 
For the crust I did 1 1/2 c crushed graham crackers, 1/4 cup butter, dash of sugar and almond meal. The almond meal added a nice touch. I also baked the crust for about 15 minutes before adding in the cheese cake.
The only modification I made for the cheesecake itself was I decreased the flour to 2 tbsp and baked at 325 for 1 hr 15 min (in a water bath) then turned the oven off and left the cheesecake in the oven cooling for about 1 hour. After that I put the cheesecake in the refrigerator and served a few hours later.
Great taste, great texture, no cracking! Excellent recipe!

This is the first cheesecake I ever made. I was quite apprehensive, because I though cheesecakes were really hard to make. Plus, I didn't even have a hand mixer at the time, so I was mixing up four blocks of cream cheese with a fork, hah. Well, if you're worried that this will be too difficult, don't be. This cheesecake was SO simple, and so delicious. I gave it to a family friend for his birthday, and he's crazy about it! 

The only thing I did differently was the crust. I followed the recipe for the cheesecake exactly, but I followed the crust recipe of one of the reviewers. The crust got pretty soggy though, so the next time I make it, I think I'll stick the crust in the oven for about 15 minutes, then pour in the cream cheese mixture. Also, bake this in a water bath! I had no problems of sinking or cracking. Also, if you're planning on making these into cupcakes (which are also delicious, by the way), bake in a water bath for 30 minutes.

I like it but it's missing something.  I may incorporate heavy cream, drop of lemon & orange oil for a hint of citrus.  It is missing the creamy texture so I would suggest replacing the milk with heavy cream and I will do this next time because mine was a bit "eggy".  Thank you for submitting.

Awesome! It deserves 10 stars! I have baked many cheesecakes in my life and this was the best by far. I followed the reviews and baked it in a hot water bath. Thank you to the reviewer who suggested using a crock pot liner bag instead of aluminum foil (which can leak). The hot water bath makes all the difference...I will use that method for all my cheesecakes in the future. Friends and family raved about this cheesecake and most asked for the recipe. Thank you to the submitter!

This has the texture and taste of the New York style cheesecakes we had at least once a week when I lived in New York. We had "cheesecake days" when co-workers would bring in cakes from various bakeries so we could decide who had the best...Now, to those reviewers who criticize this (without trying it) for having flour and milk, and then explain how they make a cheesecake: this is a New York STYLE cheesecake.

Flavor was wonderful, however, 15 graham crackers was too much and not enough butter to meld the crumbs together. the recipe calls for a 9 inch pan, and I'm not sure how you would fit all of this batter into one. Maybe I over beat it and that's why. The recipe doesn't say one word about foil or water bath, which seems to be very IMPORTANT...

I made this at 7500ft so made a few changes (more flour and water).  The top of mine cracked and sunk in the middle, but since I served with cherries on top, no one could see the cracks.  I made with 10" dish, and casserole dish full of hot water on bottom shelf of oven - left in oven for 2 hours after turning oven off from baking.

Made with graham cracker base with butter and cinnamon.

The only thing missing was taste - it was the right consistency and texture, but it was bland.  Maybe I'll try some lemon juice next time.

Awesome!  I baked as some suggested; 325 for an hour and left it in the oven for 4 hours to cool.  No cracks, smooth and creamy, and beautiful.  I would have preferred the crust a bit firmer; I will pre-bake that in the future.

I have the biggest sweet tooth ever and cheesecake is my #1 dessert. This recipe is GOOD! I have amde many cheesecakes, looking for that NEW YORK taste and texture. This recipe is definitely perfect. However, since I am a baker myself I always have to add my touch. I added two tablespoons of Mexican vanilla and I also substituted 1/2 cup of condensed milk for sugar. Next time i will try adding ricotta cheese since I love the texture of it.

This scored a 4 on taste, a 4 on directions, and 5 for a good base of a recipe.  CRUST:  I had no clue if I should use full-size crackers or not.  I think 15 full-size ones were too big, so I would use 11 or 12 next time. I would also increase the butter from 2 Tbl to 6 and would add a little more sweetness by adding 2 Tbl sugar to it.  FILLING:  Perfect - - just make sure to not overmix it to prevent cracking later.  DIRECTION ALTERATIONS:  1)  Make sure to grease the side of the pan too.   2)  I wrapped the pan with two layers of aluminum foil to prevent the water bath from getting in.   3)  Use a roasting pan to put a 1" very hot water bath around the cheesecake pan.  I didn't have one, so I used a jellyroll pan with 1/4" water and it still worked out fine.   4)  I baked at 325 degrees for 1 hour, then turned off the oven and left it in there for another hour.  Then I opened the oven door for an hour.  Then I took it out and let it sit out for about 2-3 hours.  You want to gradually cool it over time to prevent cracking.  Put it in the refrigerator, covered, overnight or for at least 8 hours.  Take out 30 minutes before you want to serve and you can remove the pan.   5)  Dip a knife in warm water before slicing each piece.  (I ran mine under water each time to get rid of the cheesecake residue.)  It looks great and was delicious with a can of cherry pie filling on top.

AMAZING!!!  I read through a ton of reviews for tips and tricks, and have made this twice now, and this is what I'd suggest:

Really truly make sure your cream cheese is softened.  If you don't let it soften enough, it will be lumpy and uneven. 
DO NOT OVERBEAT.  I used beaters for step 2 and part of three through the milk stage.  I then used a rubber spatula from the eggs on out.
Really grease the pan and crust prior to adding filling.  This will keep it from cracking.

Finally, the crust really takes away from the heavenly filling.  It did not have nearly enough butter.  I followed the recipe exactly the first go around and although everyone loved the cheesecake, they agreed that the crust was essentially nothing more than crushed grahams.  Use a traditional graham cracker crust recipe with more butter and some sugar, and bake it ahead of time.  You don't want to have the perfect filling but have the crust fall short.

Doing everything as suggested above will give you the most delicious cheesecake you will ever have in your entire life.  I made it for my boss's bday and people who swore up and down that they hated cheesecake became converts. WOW!!!

I baked this for Thanksgiving dinner. It was the hit of the dinner. I was hesitant on leaving it in the oven for such a long period of time. I ended up leaving it in the oven for three hours because I needed to put the roast in. It looked so pretty when it came out. I can not wait to try this recipe again.

Hands down, the BEST cheesecake recipe ever.  Ingredient wise, change nothing.  The only change I make is to fold the eggs in last.  If you are adding them one at a time just to incorporate, it defeats the purpose to add them before the sour cream, vanilla and flour.

My three-star rating includes the four-star taste and the two-star tips from reviewers I chose to listen to. With every recipe I read the reviews first to pick up tips from others who had more success adding ingredients/steps/etc. I decided to use the following tips all to hopefully stop the dreaded cracking of the cake: "lower the oven temp to 325," "grease around the sides of the pan to the top to help prevent the cake from adhering to the walls," "mix everything by hand until just incorporated," and "use a water bath or a pan full of water underneath the cake." Well, after taking these precautions, a half hour into the bake and I had a HUGE crack down the middle. Very disappointing. I liked the taste of this uber-traditional cheesecake, but I think next time I make this; I'll forego the safeguards from other reviewers and follow the recipe without worrying about cracks. A crack does not affect the taste, but the useless tips wasted my time and dirtied more dishes. By the way, I made a vanilla mango sauce for the top and it was fantastic.

This cheesecake is amazing. I've made it several times, changing things here and there to make it better. Thanks to other reviewers for suggestions. I use a mixer for the cream cheese and sugar, after that mix by hand. Only use 2 tablespoons of flour for creamier cake. And finally, the WATER BATH! Very important for not cracking! The first time I did it I tried foil and water got in my springform pan. If you use a Turkey Roasting Bag, and just place the pan down in the bag, cutting off extra bag, no water gets in, and it's perfect!! Best Cheesecake Ever!

This is a NEW YORK STYLE cheesecake. The addition of flour in the recipe (the full 1/4 cup) gives it the proper New York Style cheesecake texture. I've been using this exact recipe for years. I use room-temperature ingredients and I wrap foil around bottom and sides of pan (careful not to slide it too much when putting it in the oven). When I first turn the oven on, I put a large, rectangular metal cake pan filled half-way with water on the bottom shelf and leave it there. I bake on middle shelf, 325 degrees for 80 minutes - perfect temp and time for my gas oven. I used to sprinkle the flour in the batter but now I gradually mix it, along with the vanilla, into the sour cream first. Sometimes I remember to grease sides of pan, sometimes not. Rarely does the cheesecake crack, unless I over-beat it! Once the cheese and sugar are mixed, use the electric beater only in moderation. I let it sit in the cooling oven for 5 - 6 hours (I bake it at night and set the alarm clock to get up and put it in the fridge) and in the fridge all day. I consider the time in the oven "fermenting" time :)  It tastes good all by itself. (one can get carried away!) I've made this cheesecake for bridal/baby showers, wedding receptions, with cranberry/holly sprig decorations at christmas, with homemade fruit toppings, with apple and caramel, with lemon curd topping... It doesn't taste bland; it tastes like class. The crust does not overpower the taste of the cake. It's just wonderful!

Just be sure that all of your cold ingredients are left at room temperature for a few hours. I only use an electric mixer to cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Everything else is folded together by hand. No need to worry about lumps, because they'll bake out. Don't forget to bake it in a water bath, so it'll stay at a consistent temperature. For the crust, I put six honey-flavored graham crackers (the whole crackers, not the sections of crackers) into a ziploc bag and smash them with a cup or a rolling pin. I then combine the crumbs with 1/4 cup unsalted butter, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, and 1/4 cup white sugar. I usually cut a circular piece of parchment paper for the bottom of my pan, so that I don't have to use additional fat. I bake the crust for 10 minutes before adding the mix, just so it can harden up a bit. The filling can be halfed and put into a regular 9-inch pie pan. The recipe can be easily altered to make different cheesecake flavors (I added melted some of the cream cheese and milk in a double broiler with 2 cups of white chocolate to add to the filling, covered the cake in raspberry topping, and used chocolate flavored graham crackers for the crust for Christmas). Of course, it's also just fine on its own with all of the bells and whistles.

I've been making this cheesecake several times and i made some improvisations, I use pie pastry instead of cookie crumb crust. After I baked the pie for 15 minutes, I arrange fresh strawberries on it before pouring in the cheesecake batter. Then I bake it as directions. It was a big hit and everyone loves it! When you slice the cake, the strawberries would be very decorative! I'll add the photo after this, hope you like it! ^^

This was delicious!  Not the best cheesecake I have ever had (hence the four stars) but very very good regardless.  I followed the recipe exactly and then topped the finished product with local raspberries my kids and I picked and a raspberry coulis I made from a few more of the berries!  Took it to dinner at some friends' and it was a big hit!

Followed the recipe exactly- only change made was to bake it in a water bath. It came out perfectly- no cracks. Brought it to a family reunion where there were 2 professional chefs and was told that this cheesecake was better than theirs. Also, for all the other reviewers, New York style Cheesecake is supposed to be a golden brown on top and it does include sour cream in the recipe! You can always decorate the top with a mix of strawberries for a nicer presentation.

yum!!!! this was SO delicious. Everyone gobbled it up, and now I'm making a second batch.  The water bath does help a LOT.  I would add more graham crackers for the crust, however...

Holy Cow!!!  I made this recipe last night and it knocked our socks off!!!  It wasn't a hard recipe at all. I think the key is the water bath and leaving it in the oven and not opening the door.  Not one single crack!  Thank you so much!!!!

I made this recipe again on Sun for the holidays in a 9in pan & a 10in pan (just increased all ingredients by 25%). Both came out perfect, no cracks! Of course I'm giving this a 5 based on the tweaks I've made to the filling and the crust. For the crust: 1.5cups of cinnamon graham crackers/7T butter/dash of nutmeg. For the filling: didn't use milk, only 1T flour, & juice of 1 lemon; also switched to wooden spoon aften beating the cream cheese. In a seperate bowl, I mixed my sugar/flour together & gradually added the combo to the cream cheese. After making filling, let it rest for ~30 min;also used the steam bath method. Cooked on 325 for 1hr, left it in oven w/ cracked stove door for 2hrs, cooled completely on counter for 3hrs & then in the frige!

My first cheesecake - delish and beautiful! I read a ton of other reviews, consulted with friend, and here's my technique, FWIW: used crust recipe from Philadelphia cream cheese website (1-1/2C crushed graham crackers, 1/2C chopped walnuts, 4T melted butter - it makes a little too much for a 9-in pan, FYI). I pre-baked the crust for 15 minutes as I was making the filling. I cut the temp to 325 since I was using a dark colored/glass bottom springform pan. Greased both bottom and sides of springform pan to avoid sticking. I made the filling recipe exactly as suggested here, except added a vanilla bean per cashoda's suggestion on this website, and cut the vanilla to 2t - a nice vanilla-y flavor! Make sure your cream cheese is at room temp, even if you have to zap it in the microwave for a few seconds. Mine was a little too cool, and so I had to overmix to get the lumps out. Then, to get rid of resulting air bubbles, after pouring into the springform pan, I let it sit for 15 min and dropped it on the table a few times so air bubbles would rise to the top, and then popped them. I did not do a water bath b/c I was afraid of leaks, but put a 9x13 pan on a lower shelf with boiling water to get the steam effect.  Once I put it in the oven, did not open the oven at all during 1 hr of baking! I removed it after baking to run a knife along the sides and put back in for 5 hours (again, no peeking!) before removing it to the fridge overnight. Topped with chocolate shavings before serving.

This recipe is great but needds some adjustments for starters don't use a full 1/4 cup of flour unless you like it cakey i used around 3tbls. also i only used 3 eggs it also isnt as fattening if you use 3. use at least double the butter that is suggested or else the crust falls apart,add a little bit of cinnamon or chopped nuts to crust it gives it a lot of flavor or else its really blan. Thanks so much for the recipe!

If I could give this recipie AND review's below a hundred stars, I would do that.  Cooking the cheesecake at 200 degrees for 3 hours and then letting it cool in the oven after its turned off for an hour has saved ALL of my cheesecakes that I made for an event. (I made 14 cheesecakes, 2 at a time) None of the cheesecakes that I made cracked, and all were creamy and not sunken in!  Thanks so much!  I have now had offers from people to buy them @ $35 each.  Oh another thing I changed is, I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk.  I used the baking method on all of the different cheesecakes I made, and all of them turned out wonderful!  UPDATE:  I was having trouble with my water bath going through the foil and into my cheesecake, so I fould that if i used oven bags just around the pan NOT closed around the cheesecake that I have no more water in my cheesecakes.  Also I stopped using butter in my crust, I found that the crust stays nice and dry and not so moist due to the butter.  Holds well.  Thanks again!  I just got done with another cheesecake party for a client and it turned out WONDERFUL!

WOW!  What an incredible cheesecake!  I've only made two cheesecakes in my LIFE, and this was the best I've ever tasted.  The only thing I will do differently next time is let it bake for another maybe 5 minutes; the middle was still a bit on the runny side with only 60 minutes.  I wrapped the well-greased springform pan twice in tin foil, and then placed it in 1 inch of HOT water before putting it in the oven.  Then, after it was finished baking, I took a greased knife and ran it between the pan and the edge of the cake.  Lastly, I closed the oven door and turned it off, and let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath for about 3 or 4 hours, cooling.  I can't believe how great those tips were!  The texture was perfect, there were absolutely NO cracks, and it was a beautiful golden brown.  Oh, I also made sure that I didn't overmix the batter.  I only mixed it just enough to incorporate the ingredients.  I think it's easier not to overmix if you mix by hand, not with a mixer.  This is definitely something I'll be making again!  Thank you for posting!

First, let me say I am a newbie at baking anything. Actually, this is the first cake I've ever baked. I went out and bought a spring form pan just for this!

I followed the recipe exactly to make the filling. The only changes I made were to use the graham cracker/butter/cinnamon/sugar crust (good call!) and I set the oven at 325 using a water bath. I did bake the crust alone for 10 minutes while mixing the batter.

Let me just say wow! There was no browning at all, no cracking at all and it came out creamy and delicious! The taste was truly great. I can honestly say this is restaurant quality (better than most restaurants) cheesecake!

The only problems I had were 1. I made a pretty big mess - I am a newbie to this! and 2. it was difficult to get the crust to peacefully separate from the bottom of the pan - I think this was exacerbated by the little lip around the pan. Therefore I couldn't transfer it to a serving plate as planned. I had to cut it in the pan bottom and then I could get a nice piece, crust and all. I think next time I'll try using a 9" parchment round paper in the bottom to help with this.

Edit: Last time I flipped the bottom of the pan to get rid of the lip (like I said, I'm learning) and did use parchment paper. It was a piece of cake (pun intended) to remove from the pan this time!

I LOVE his recipe. I doubled it and it filled the 9 inch springform to the top, it doesn't run over. It made a super thick cake, I posted a couple of pictures of the result. I also increased the cook time by 20 minutes to make sure the center was done to make up for the extra volume. The only extra thing I added was lemon and orange zest, and used heavy cream instead of regular milk. I didn't have any cracks at all, I used a water bath and let it sit for 5 hours without touching it. When you double the recipe this looks like a real NY cheesecake, being from there, I know my stuff. Great recipe, this is my new favorite!

This is an excellent cheesecake recipe. I made a few changes to the baking method and my cheesecakes come out beautifully. When mixing, I use the paddle instead of the whisk on my kitchenaid mixer and I mix it on the lowest speed.  Don't over.  The more you mix, the more air you incorporate in the batter, which tends to make the cheesecakes crack.  I line the bottom of my springform pan with parchment paper.  I butter the sides and bottom of the pan before I put in the crust.  This helps with removing the cheesecake from the pan.  Instead of putting the cheesecake in a water bath, I place a casserole dish of hot water underneath the cheesecake while it bakes.

This is now the ONLY cheesecake recipe I will use!  It is fantastic.  I made the crust that one reviewer suggested, with more graham crackers, sugar, cinnamon, and butter, and it was good.  Also I prebaked the crust for about 8 minutes before adding the filling.  I did not use the flour in the filling, since I wanted a creamier cheesecake, but I do want to try it with the flour to see how it is.  It came out nice and creamy.  I also put a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake since I didn't have a large enough pan to do the water bath.  I left it in the oven for close to six hours.  There wasn't even a HINT of a crack, it was beautiful!

I have been searching for the "perfect" cheesecake recipe for several years.  I feel like I have tried them all.  Finally, this recipe delivered.  I wouldn't change a thing about the ingredients.  The only thing to remember about this cheesecake is that it is not a recipe that can be planned and implemented on a last moment's notice.  I usually bake this cheesecake a day before, leave it in the oven all night after turning the oven off, and refrigerate for at least four hours until I serve.  This is not something that can be made in a hurry.  However, the extra time is worth it.  This cheesecake is "to die for".

This is a very well written recipe.  For tips on how to end up with a beautiful result sort the reviews by most helpful and read the comments by reviewer Chung_Brenda.  You will end up with a perfect cheesecake if you follow these tips.  I had to add a little more butter (3 Tbsp.) to the graham crackers to moisten them enough.  One note, check on the water bath throughout the cooking time.  Mine all cooked off and I had to add more.  I don't think the cheesecake needs to stay in the oven after baking for more than 2 hours.  At that point it can be refrigerated.  The result was both beautiful and great tasting! I served with fresh strawberries but the possibilities are endless.  Thanks for this one!

This was excellent!  FYI, if your cheesecake cracks from baking, I have a little tip/suggestion...  What I do is make a quick "Sour Cream Topping" for it.  Use 1 pint of sour cream, 6 TB sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and a tsp of Grand Marnier (optional.  Whisk everything together until well blended.  Spread on top of the cheesecake during the last 5 min. or so of baking, then cool and chill the cake.  That usually covers the cracks pretty well.

This was the best cheesecake that I have ever made.  It doesn't get any better than this recipie - PERFECT, don't change a thing.  Mine did crack on the top but when I covered it with the strawberries, it was just as pretty.  Felt like I was at some fancy restaurant having a ridiculously priced dessert.

I have made a lot of cheesecakes in my life and this has been the best one yet. It was a hit with all of my family. I did change the crust to add a little more flavor to it by doing what others recommended  1 1/2 C Grahm Cracker 1/4 C melted butter 1/2 tsp cinnamon 1/4 cup sugar. I cooked the crust for 15 minutes before adding the cheesecake mixture. Unfortunately it did have a huge crack in it because I forgot to grease the pan so please make sure and grease the pan. I also highly recommend the water bath. I think it added to the lightness of the cheesecake

With all of the reviews giving this 5 stars, I thought I would hear a choir of Angels sing when I took my 1st bite.

 I personally thought that the cheescake was average, but decided to give it another try just in case it was an error on my part.

 The second time I still thought it was an average cheesecake, however my mom came over and I offered here some. Her 1st question was "Where did you buy this?" and then said, "This is soooo good". 

 I'm giving this 4 stars because even though I thought it was average and deserved 3 stars, my mom really liked it and would have said 5 stars.

This cheesecake is to die for! I used Splenda instead of sugar to accommodate a diabetic family member and it turned out great. Instead of placing in a water bath,I set a pan of water on the rack below. The cheesecake ended up with a few cracks but they were too tiny to matter. The texture was firm but creamy. I'll be making this one again and again.

Update: Made this cheesecake several times using real sugar, heavy cream instead of milk, and a teaspoon of lemon extract. This is without a doubt the creamiest, best tasting cheesecake I've ever tasted. I bake it for exactly one hour, no more and no less. When done, I shut off the oven and run a knife between the cheesecake and the side of the springform to loosen it then I leave in the oven for an additional hour to cool. I've found that leaving it the oven for 5-6 hours causes my cheesecake to crack so I take it out of the oven and leave it on a cooling rack until it reaches room temperature then I put it in the fridge to chill completely. Try this recipe, you won't regret it and if your cheesecake cracks, don't sweat it. That's what toppings are for. Just spread it on and eat happily.

I dont normally leave reviews but this was amazing. I am still in shock that i made something so good! I've never made cheesecake before so i was a little nervous about how it would turn out. I followed others suggestions and only used 2Tbs flour (i prefer a dense cheesecake) and for the crust i added 1/4c sugar and used a total of 1/4c butter. Other than that i followed the directions exactly and it turned out creamy and delicious, it didn't fall in the center and there are NO cracks. Its almost too good to add topping. I did use a 10" springform and next time will use a 9" as i prefer a thicker cheesecake. Next time i'm going to make a chocolate one!

Oh. My. Gosh. This cheesecake is absolutely sublime. I didn't use a water bath and it was beyond perfect. I think it's a really good idea to let it sit in the oven and cool gradually. I want to make this again and again and again. And again. Mmmmmmmmmm.

I've never made cheesecake before and needed a dessert for a picnic.  I tried this one and baked it in a 9x13 pan.  It was perfect!  I topped it with fresh fruit and it was a hit!  Perfect consistancy and taste.  I did increase the graham cracker crust a little to get good coverage.  Otherwise, it is the perfect amount of filling for a 9x13 pan!  Thanks for a delicious cheesecake recipe that you'd think came from a bakery!  6-13-07... Update... I made this again in an 8" springform and did not get a single crack!  I placed a baking pan filled with water above the cheesecake while cooking and it turned out perfect!   Dense and creamy!  I can't wait to start adding flavors and switching up the crust!

Very light and fluffy. Very good. It produced a 1" deep split from one side of the pan to the other. Right down the middle.  The worst cheesecake crack I have ever baked.  hmmmm.  Just cover it with something yummy!  :)
1/7/09 update:  I cut the recipe in half, used the same amount of crust and pan, cooked for 50 min and it turned out just as good and fluffy as the whole one I made.  less guilt for the same size slice!!!

This was not good at all.  I was so excited because of all the good reviews.  I followed the directions exactly.  I have no idea what went wrong.  Mine didnt crack, but it did have air bubbles on the top.  The texture was different ????  I would not make again

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars only because I can't give it 10!!  This is an absolutely amazing cheesecake.  I have *very* little experience in the kitchen.  I can make toast and boil water for tea, but that's about it!  (lol)  So if I can make this cheesecake and have it turn out superbly, so can you!  I took it to a faculty gathering, and no one could believe that it was my first cheesecake ever.  They all thought I'd been making them for years!  Since then, I've been getting requests to make it again.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Chantal!!

This was my first ever attempt at Cheesecake and it turned out perfect! I read quite a few reviews, so I took a  few tips of advice. I had to purchase a springfoam pan for this recipe. I followed the recipe almost. I used 1 1/4 cups of graham cracker crumbs and doubled the amount of butter (and used real butter) I also added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the crust and about a teaspoon-tablespoon of white sugar to the crust. I added about one tablespoon of lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture. I used regular cream cheese and whole milk (though tempted to buy the reduced fat cream cheese and lower fat milk, I didn't want to chance it and compromise the taste) I greased my pan very well and did use a version of this crazy water bath I had read about. I  put about 1" of hot water in a 9X13 pyrex and put it in the oven on the rack directly under the rack the cheesecake was on. I baked for one hour on 350 degrees and never even opened the oven door! I wanted to so badly, but was afraid it would mess the cheesecake up. I let it cool for the full amount of time, and when I took it out, It was golden brown on top and not one crack and It did not sink either! the taste was excellent, will definitely make this one again! This will be my cheesecake recipe-it tastes store bought.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving.  It was every bit as good as everyone else has already indicated.  I had dinner for 24 people, and they went crazy for this cheesecake. I almost didn't make it after seeing the picture of it, which I thought was too sloppy-looking.  I chose it because it was easy, but it tastes like something that requires an expert's touch.  Thanks a million Chantal!!!!!!

I doubled the amount of butter in the crust.  Mom said this was the best cheesecake she had ever tasted, restaurants included.  Thanks for making my first ever cheesecake a star!

Love this!  My husband is diabetic so I make it with splenda and low fat cream cheese to cut the carb and fat content.  It's one dessert that he really enjoys!

My cheesecake tasted good but had a crater the size of the Grand Canyon.  Not sure what happened.  I also had some confusion over what exactly is a graham cracker- rectangle, whole sheet, etc.  I think I'll try another recipe next time.

This is a keeper! I have made it countless times. I've tried others and wasn't impressed. I have never changed anything on this recipe before, but yesterday I decided to do a little tweaking and they (I made two) turned out great. First I did about 2/3 graham crackers and 1/3 vanilla wafers, because that's what I had on hand. I also added a few more tablespoons of butter to the crust. Then the only other change was I baked it for 10 minutes at 425 degrees, then dropped it down to 350 for the rest of the time. I also baked them in a hot water bath this time. This is necessary though, I just wanted to try it. Make sure to tin-foil your springform pan on the outside if you do decide to try it. It turns out beautifully no matter how you bake it. Trust me, I have tried many and this one is THE BEST!

I've used this recipe many times and it's always a hit!  Everyone thinks the cake is store bought.  I like to use oreo crust and I never use the bath water technique.  Don't leave the cake in the oven too long.  I only leave it in the oven for about 2-3 hours then let it cool in the fridge.  Always comes out amazing!  Thanks Chantal!

This is the first cheesecake i have ever made and it was great! I halved the recipe because I don't have a springform pan. I used a normal round 9 inch pie pan, I was nervous about that but it still turned out wonderful. I wil make this recipe again and again.....

This cheesecake is simply divine!  I tried a different recipe on here once that used ricotta cheese, and boy was it awful.  But this recipe is gold!  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfect.  Even my father-in-law, a pure-bred Italian cook, loved this cheesecake and didn't have any suggestions to offer.  Which NEVER happens.  :)  This is my recipe from now on!  One tip I would offer is to make sure the cream cheese is room temperature before starting.

It was my first time making cheesecake and I feel like the queen of cheesecakes now thanks to you Chantal!  I took suggestions from others:  Double the butter in the crust.  Use a reynolds oven bag over the bottom of the pan and use a water bath 1/2 way up the pan in another pan.  Cook for a little over an hour so the center isn't mushy.  Cool in the oven for only about 1 1/2 hours then directly to the fridge.  Outrageous...boyfriend says the best he ever had - the taste, the consistency...I'm sooo happy!!!

This is a fabulous recipe, and one I'm requested to bring almost everywhere I go. With this, I HAVE FINALLY SOLVED MY WATERBATH PROBLEM! Wrapping tin-foil around my pan always allows water to leak in anyway, so I went looking for a better solution - and I've got it! I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought one of those red SiliconeZone Flexi Bakeware 9 1/2 in. cake pans. (It costs $14.99 without one of those coupons they send out all the time that never expire.) Anyway, I got home prepared my cheesecake as usual, and then pryed the cake pan around my glass-bottomed springform pan. (I recommend the glass bottom pan because the glass doesn't have any lip on it, and if you want to transfer your cheesecake to a serving platter, it's easy to get underneath it.) It's very tight, but the silicone bends easily and you want to keep the water out. After I had the springform pan resting inside the red cake pan, I put it in the water bath and baked as usual. MY CHEESECAKE WAS PERFECT! Usually my crust gets soggy because the water bath leaks in, but the crust was crunchy and tasty and the whole thing looked great. Best of luck to you with your cheesecake baking. Thanks for this FABULOUS RECIPE, CHANTAL!

Will not be trying this recipe again. Followed the recipe to a T and it cracked pretty quickly in the oven. I will stick with a water bath. The batter was too much for the pan, and was way too thick, and the flavor was bland for a New York style cheesecake.  Highly disappointing.

Came out perfect!  I used a water bath and also reduced baking temp to 335.  The cheesecake should have a wobbly 2-3 inch center when it's done...it will firm up in the 1-2 hours it sits in the cooling-off oven.  It doesn't need to sit 5-6 as the recipe calls for...you should get it in the fridge after 1-2 hours.  Mine did not crack at all.  A crust variation-- add 4 Tbs sugar, 2 Tbs brown sugar, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and use 4 Tbs melted butter per package of cinnamon graham crackers...really good crust.  Pre-bake for a few minutes before pouring in cheesecake batter.  Delicious cheesecake recipe!

The best cheesecake I have made yet, and I keep trying. The secret I am finding to all good cheesecakes is to just barely mix after the eggs go in and to use all room-temperature ingredients (or warm them in the microwave). That helps to keep things smooth. Also, cooling completely in the oven (without once opening the oven during cooking) keeps the cake from cracking.

Excellent!  I have never made a cheese cake before, so I have nothing to compare it to as far as prep work, but it came out really fluffy as well as tasty!  My only complaint is the crust, meaning that there wasn't enough of it, I will use more graham crackers next time.  Mine did have 1 crack down the center, but after it was cut, it didn't even notice.  Thanks Chantel for the great cheesecake!!

Was the biggest cheese cake I have ever made.  The husband managed to finish it off in one weekend so it must have been good.  

next time I think I will make a half batch and save a couple inches on my sweetie's love handles.

My thanks to Chantal for sharing this recipe.  It is one of the best I've ever eaten.
I did add 5 eggs, instead of 4 to mine.  I also used half & half instead of the milk.
It is definately better after it chills.  Makes a nice big cheesecake.  Anyone who likes cheesecake should try this one!

This cheesecake was a big hit with my husband and our friends. Great texture and taste. I followed the suggestions of using a water bath and bringing all ingredients to room temperature.(great help) My husband is already planning when I will make it again. Thanks Chantal for a great cheesecake.

This was my first time ever to bake a "real" cheesecake and it was well worth the work.  Just be really careful to wrap the bottom and sides of your springform pan well with aluminum foil if you use the water bath, which I did and it turned our beautifully.  I bake my cheesecake for about 10 or 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for, and I think it turned out with a wonderful texture; nice and firm, but not overcooked at all.  My guests couldn't believe I made it! SINFULLY DELICIOUS

I can't believe how great this cake came out!  It was sooo easy to make.  I practically had all of the ingredients in my refridgerator.  I'm a person to follow recipes to the letter, but I can't wait to try different variations of this cheesecake.  The crust was a little soggy, but I mistakenly added twice as much butter.  But it was still perfect.  It didn't crack, although I did use the water bath as suggested by another person who reviewed this recipe.  I have spent so much money buying those little, tiny, $6 and $7 cheesecakes at the grocery store.  If I were to eat a piece of this cake and a store brought cake from their bakery I couldn't tell the difference.  I think I'll make this cake again this weekend.

I am in the middle of this recipe for the first time.  It would really help if I would have known how many grams of graham crackers to use...were they square or rectangle?  I started with 15 rectangle and felt that the crust was too dry so I added more butter and froze the remainder crust.  As an America, living overseas, it really helps to know weight or measured amount of crumbs for these things. My cheesecake is in the oven now so we'll see!

Ok, I have to say I was worried beyond belief when first making this beauty. I'm not much of a baker (or cook at that) but I love to dabble and I thought "do i love cheesecake." And I am so glad I chose this recipe! Even having never made cheesecake before, this wasn't difficult at all - just long. It was torture waiting the 6+ hours for it to cool! Although it cracked along the surface (the family was too busy devouring it to care haha) and the flour clumping in the batter ruffled my feathers a bit (fixed the right quick with an electric mixer), I couldn't have been happier with the final product. Everyone in the house loved it! Next time I make this I'm definitely adding a fruit topping of some kind - that's the only thing we thought was missing from this bad boy!

This is a great cheesecake recipe. For those of you that had unsuccessful results, I would like to share some of my tips for making a great cheesecake.... I always make sure all of my ingredients are room temperature because it eliminates any lumps in my batter... I also always mix my ingredients with a wooden spoon by hand, never a mixer. If there is too much air in your batter, it will taste gritty. Also, don't forget to spray the sides of your pan with a baking spray to prevent the cake from sticking- this step, combined with the water bath will eliminate any cracks. Also, it never hurts to use an oven thermometer to check the accuracy of your oven temp.

As one other viewer mentioned, if you screw this up its your own fault. I did use half & half cream and added vanilla with wet ingredients. Took this to a Super Bowl party and it was the winner.

I made this cheesecake for my wife for Valentine's Day and she absolutely LOVED it.  She always orders cheesecake if we order dessert when we're dining out, and she said this was better than any she's had anywhere.  

I followed the recipe completely, and it didn't crack and was perfect. 

I made a raspberry sauce out of a small container of frozen raspberries.  Added a bit of orange juice and a tablespoon of sugar.  Heated it to boiling after I added 2 tsp. of cornstarch that had been mixed into 2 TBLSP. of water.  Perfect.

Every time we cut a piece and drizzled the sauce on it one of us said that it looked just like in a magazine.  Thanks for this recipe.

I rarely write a review but this recipe is absolutely devine so it was a must! This recipe was my first attempt at cheesecake EVER. I've made it twice in the same month so far.  I made it just as it is listed ingredient wise (maybe adding a little more sugar the second time.) I did however use a water bath. Which in my opinion changes NOTHING as far as the actual recipe is concerned, the method of cooking with a waterbath just enhanced this recipes texture (moisture) and apperance (little to no cracking). In my first attempt the cake did have a very small crack (I think it was because I opened the oven a few time too many times). I baked it in a 8 in cake pan since I didn't own a spring form pan at the time. The cake did rise and fall but was still perfect in the end. To cover the small crack I used a sour cream topping. The second time I used a springform pan. I tried to cheat and only wrapped foil halfway up the pan once, water did leak in a little. The crust did get soggy but wasn't a huge issue. The second attempt using the springform pan didn't look as nice as the cake pan edge wise, but was still a success with no cracks at all. I also covered it with a sour cream topping. Lastly, I also baked the crust for a few mins. before for each cake.  My water bath pan was a 1 1/2 inch cookie sheet with hot water added about 1 inch up. In my next attempt I will adjusted the temp a little lower to see of it helps lighten the edges. All in all this recipe is a Slam Dunk!

Simply deelish! I did change the crust from graham crackers to 50 Nilla wafers. I'm not a fan of graham and I found the vanilla wafers lighter. Something else not mentioned is the water bath, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! Next to NOT over beating the batter, I believe that a water bath aids in the cheesecake NOT cracking! I took the advice of something I read on this site and used one of those cooking bags instead of tin foil for the bath. I thought, "what a great idea! That way there is no chance of the water seeping into the cheesecake!" Worked like a charm and I'll use that again!!!! This was the most beautiful,  perfect, deliciously simple cheesecake I have ever made! I brought it to a Christmas party and people actually thought it came from a bakery! (No one touched the store bought cheesecake another guest brought!)

I made this recipe for Christmas dessert and was really good.  Even our picky teenage nieces liked and had it again the next night.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it cracked, and it seemed a bit too done on top.  The cracking could have been due to over mixing or maybe because I substituted low fat cream cheese for two of the four packages.  I will definitely make again and see if I have different results the next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Hands down the best cheesecake recipe ever!  I have topped it with lemon curd and made a sour cream topping button those are the only changes I have made.  Perfect every time.  Entered it in a friendly cheesecake competition and was almost disqualified because people thought I brought a cheesecake from a bakery!  Have all ingredients at room temp, bake and leave it in the oven overnight (if you bake in the evening) chill in the fridge and ENJOY!

Amazing recipe! First time I made it I got rave reviews. Now I have to make it for everyone's birthday at work. The only change I made was taking a package of Oreos (birthday cake filling, berry filling, or regular) put it in a processor (cream filling and all) then pressed into bottom of spring pan. Top with a can of strawberry pie filling...Absolutely divine! Will try incorporating white chocolate next time! A+++

The cake was perfect and very delicious.  Served it as a birthday cake with strawberries and whip cream.  5 out of the 5 people who tried it loved it.  The only problem I had was that after chilling in the fridge for several hours..the too thin crust stuck to the bottom of the spring form pan very bad.  Will probably try a different crust recipe next time.   I greased sides of springform pan with butter however, and the cake pulled away from sides beautifully..and with no cracks.  Nice.

It's not fair for me to say its terrible or awesome because I didn't follow the directions to a tee. However, I thought the recipe was very good. I didn't use milk or flour because I have never seen that before. I did add 1/2 c of sugar to my crust to give it more flavor. I also did 1/4 of melted butter. I accidentally used a whole stick and it didn't work so I had to scrap the crust. I let my cream cheese set out for over an hour to bring it to room temperature. I used my stand mixer to mix the ingredients. I was very careful not to go past 1 and to not let over beat. I forgot to put in the vanilla. I baked at 325 for 10 minutes and changed my mind and lowered it to 225 for 3 hours. I let it cool for another 2 in the oven then placed in the fridge over night. My cheesecake didn't not burn, fall or crack! I was so excited. It is very creamy and moist. I used a crock pot liner to put under my springform pan and placed in a water bath also. This took a while to make  and I grounded my husband from the kitchen and told him he had to tiptoe around the house.

The cheesecake itself was delicious and there were certainly no complaints! I made it exactly as the recipes states, but where I got stumped was the "15 Graham Crackers". I didn't know what constitutes 1 Graham Cracker so I watched the video and to me it looked like one whole cracker sheet, so I used 15 of those.... well I was wrong because my crust was really dry! Now I've determined it was 15 half cracker sheets (7 1/2 whole cracker sheets). No one whose eatin it has seed to mind and I will definitely make it again but this time I'll use what I've determined to be the proper amount of graham crackers. I left a pic too if anyone wants to see it! :)

My very first homemade cheesecake and all I can say is wow! This recipe is almost perfect. I only made a few slight alterations. I used the crust recipe from the other reviews and I baked it at 335 degrees for 1hr 10 mins, then shut off oven and left it in there for only 3 hrs, cracking the oven door the last hr. Then put it in the fridge.  It came out flawless, no cracks and the taste was absolutely divine. Firm but still very creamy.  Better than I have had in a lot of restaurants. I used my stand mixer the whole way through, made sure the ingredients were at room temperature, sprayed the spring form pan with Pam, and put it in a water bath in a pizza pan. Don't forget these steps and you should be golden.

This will give you a rich but light, almost fluffy cheesecake. Wonderful! If you want a more dense cake, omit the flour. Here are some other tips. 
1. Use a water bath, as with any cheesecake or custard.  2. Preheat oven to 350, then reset to 300 once the cake is in. Bake 60 min, the leave for 3-3.5 hours in unopened oven. Cake will be set with no browning or cracks.  3. Don't overfill the pan. 4. The recipe makes a bit too much. I use a couple ramekins for mini cakes. 5. I use buttermilk or milk soured with lemon juice in place of milk and love the extra tang. 6. Half Splenda, half sugar works beautifully.

I think this cheesecake would had been perfect if I had read the comments before baking it at 350. I followed the recipe perfectly, and did not over beat. Only after 20 mins of being in the over, my cake had risen quite a bit. I then read comments saying that cheesecakes need to be cooked at 325 or 300. I dropped the temp to 325 but still after the hour, the whole top and sides were over cooked and hard. On the plus side, the flavor was great, so I only suggest to cook at a lower temp

I cooked this cheesecake exactly as I was told, in a 9 inch springform pan, for an hour at the temperature I was supposed to and it is gooey in the center. :/ I've made cheesecake many times before. Is there something I did wrong? I don't see anyone else that had this problem.

This is the best cheesecake recipe. I followed the directions and it always turns out perfect! I have made this 3 times now. The only thing a have noticed is that I always have extra cheesecake filling which i just cook in an additional ramekin. It also seems to make too much graham cracker crust (which i now put at the bottom of the ramekin for the extra filling)....maybe i just need a bigger pan. This cake did not sink. Make sure your cream cheese is soft! (you don't want lumpy cheesecake). This recipe wows! Forget Sarah Lee.

I made this recipe and it was my first time making cheesecake. I used a water bath as suggested so many times and a springform pan. I had no cracks or anything. It turned out spectacular. I did add less flour and ground peanuts into the crust for added flavor. I also used a kitchenaid for mixing and didn't over do it. My husband who does NOT eat cheesecake had at least 5 slices of this one. This is a winning recipe. This week I am making it again but adding flavor and doing a different crust.

Totally amazing!! I forgot to grease the pan so my cake cracked in the center while cooling but it didn't matter because I topped it with cherries. I will make this recipe over and over and will switch up the toppings. Perfect cheesecake!!

flavor was okay, but the flour made the cheesecake way too stiff and dense. I had such high hopes for this recipe, will not make again.

Ok so I made this cheesecake like three months ago.  At that time everyone said it was the best cheesecake they've ever had. And it was my first ever in the cheesecake realm.  Well... I just unwrapped the last piece I had put into the freezer like months ago and......This recipe freezes soooo well, you wouldn't even know I just thawed it out months later.  Not only was this recipe stellar flavor and easy for beginners it also kept amazing all this time.  Great recipe contribution, thank you.

Just wanted to give those of you who are about to attempt to make this (or any cheesecake) if you wish to avoid cracking in your cheesecake, if you have a pan large enough to place your springform pan inside it, and place water about 1/4 the way up the side of the springform. If you do not have a pan big enough to place it in, then just below the cake, place a baking dish with water the moisture will prevent the cheesecake from cracking. Happy Baking!!

By the time I finished reading many reviews and alterations people had made to this recipe, my head was spinning, and I wondered what changes I should or should not make. So, I did what I usually do…stick to the original recipe first! I think it is only fair to try it as written first, then come back and change it, if necessary. With a few common-sense exceptions, of course, for example if you don’t like an ingredient (and omitting it doesn’t affect the recipe too much) omit it. 


On to the review: I did use the suggested water bath (with a pan of water underneath the cheesecake, NOT sitting directly inside…didn’t want to fuss with wrapping in foil or potential “leakage” issues). I also spiced up the crust to our families liking (adding cinnamon, sugar, a dash of nutmeg and crushed pecans). I do not consider the crust to be the real recipe here, and it is easily adjustable to tastes. The filling, conversely is the real “meat” of the recipe: For it, I followed the recipe exactly as written, including all mixing, oven temperature, baking time, instructions...added all the flour, sour cream, milk…everything just as the recipe states. How was it? Perfect! Smooth, creamy, not too custard-like or too heavy/firm…perfect texture, smooth, well-balanced flavor. We loved it! I did, however, get one small crack in the top of my cheesecake, but it didn’t affect the taste at all. I plan to try again using a newer springform pan (this might be my problem with cracking). Happy Baking!

This is an excellent recipe!!! Whether you make it exactly or make substitutions, this one is sure to be a crowd pleaser.  I usually swap half (or sometimes all) of the cream cheese for ricotta and or neuchâtel, and the flour for half as much corn starch (gluten allergy). I also swap the graham crakers for gluten free cookies (or puffins gf cereal, believe it or not) and pop them in the food processor to crush them easily.  Happy eating!

Simple & delicious.  I only had 3 (8oz) pkgs of cream cheese instead of 4, so I cut the sugar down to 1 cup & used only 3 eggs.  I also cut the milk down to 1/2 cup.  I used a 9" round cake pan instead of a springform pan & pressed the graham cracker crust along the bottom & up the sides of the cake pan.  I set a 9"x13" baking pan filled w/ 2" of water on a lower oven rack w/ the cheesecake baking on the rack just above it.  I baked it in a preheated 350 degree oven for an hour.  At the end of an hour, I shut my oven off & forgot about the cheesecake for 5 hours.  I then transferred it to my fridge & served it the next day.  It turned out beautiful, tasted delicious, & there were no cracks!

Cheesecake shrinks as it cools & pulls away from the sides of the pan.  Cracks form because the cheesecake sticks to the sides of the pan during the cooling/shrinking process.  Either grease the inside of your pan EXTREMELY well or just press a crust up the sides of the pan as well as along the bottom.  Serve each slice straight from the cake pan like you're serving a slice of pie.  Yum!

This is great, I did not have a spring form pan. I used a 9x13 glass pan and topped with crushed pineapple/pineapple preserves and it was delicious.  I will bake this many times.

I followed the recipe exactly...But I halved it and put it into a pre-made crust. (Thank goodness I halved it! Barely fit in the crust!) I followed another person's review and used a hand mixer for the first step and a wooden spoon for the rest. I tried really hard to just stir until incorporated, but last time I made cheesecake (was not with this recipe) I hadn't stirred enough...So this time I tried to stir it just enough...Baked for an hour (wasn't sure if I should bake it for less since it was smaller...) and it turned out a bit brown. Left it in the oven overnight and then put in the fridge all day. Lots of condensation on top of cake :( I wonder how to minimize that. Served it with fresh strawberries and it was quite good! The bites I had without strawberries were a little lacking in flavor, but my family didn't seem to agree with me--my sister raved about it and my mother said it was better than the cheesecake she had just had on a cruise. I would make this recipe again but I'm just wondering how I could add a little more flavor to it...

Not the heavy and dense NY cheesecake I grew up with in NY but a very nice lighter and softer version. True NY cheesecake is heavy as lead which this is not. Whatever floats your boat....

This is my go-to recipe for cheesecake.  I read some of the reviews and followed the advice. Don't over mix the ingredients, then use a hot water bath in the oven.   I also turn off the oven after the hour and let the cake cool for the 5-6 hours.  It looks beautiful when I take it out of the oven and tastes great!  I've made this cheesecake recipes several times and it is always a hit!

ingredients are great, however, please do not keep a cheesecake in the oven for 5 to 6 hours with the door closed after it is cooked to prevent cracking!!!! this is unheard of and will ruin your cheesecake as it did mine. i am very disappointed that i followed the directions for the baking part of the recipe.

Flavor was good, but mine didn't set very well. It wasn't very dense, it was kind of mushy. I didn't have any trouble with cracking or anything. I used a water bath when I baked it. Also reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups.
Didn't taste quite like the cheesecake I had in New York, but it was good nonetheless.

A perfect cheesecake.  I get rave reviews when I make this.  I followed other advise about not overbeating it and I always cook in a water bath.  My only addition to the prep is that I add the flour after I cream the cream cheese sugar mixture.  I had it lump once when I added it at the end along with vanilla extract.  I have never had the crack across the top like other recipes.

I have been making this a couple times a year for a few years and it is a no-fail recipe.  I am not a pastry chef, and this recipe comes out perfect for me every time.  Personally, my trick to keep it from cracking is to REALLY butter the sides of the pan.  When buttered, the cheesecake can pull away from the edges as it contracts and cools and not crack.  I have made it with and without a water bath and have never found that it made a difference.  After I pour the filling into the pan I always giggle the pan and tap it for a few minutes to get the air bubbles to rise.  It always comes out dense and perfect for us.  People are amazed.  Apparently, cheesecakes are supposed to be hard to make!

Great recipe.  I used the suggestion of someone else to mix the cream cheese and sugar on low with the mixer then hand mix the remaining ingredients in with a wooden spoon.  This helps stop the cracking.  However I still put water in the oven and turned the oven off after 40 minutes but left the cheesecake in the stove for 3-4 hours to finish cooking.

While I made this as a present for some young friends and was unable to taste the final product, I have to say that this was the most beautiful cheesecake I've ever made. I followed the directions and tried to incorporate all the comments from other cooks, and it all worked. This will be my go-to cheesecake forever!

This is the best cheesecake ever!! I have made it 4 times. I always use a spring-form pan, and don't mix to much! Also i let cool in the oven 6-8 hours and don't even open the oven door. I mad this 2 years ago for thanksgiving, my family went crazy for it!! They said it was the best cheesecake they have ever eaten and i agree!! It is a lot of work but well worth the effort! The second time i made it it did crack, but it was because my husband helped and over mixed!! Read about how to make a cheesecake, they have a thing on this site, it will help a lot!!

I live in France and have learned to re-create a New York cheesecake with this recipe. I have, however, modified this somewhat (but not much). I freeze the cookie crumb crust once in the springform to make sure that when pouring in the cheese filling it doesn't break up. I reduce the sugar to 1 cup, removed the milk and most of the sour cream, adding 1 can of non sweetened condensed milk instead as well as about 3 Tb of sour cream. I prefer lemon cheesecakes, so I put in 1 tsp of lemon extract instead of the vanilla. And lastly, I replace the flour with cornstarch. Baking time is usually more than one hour and I leave it in the oven until cooled. Mine rarely crack. Thanks for the recipe, the base was a perfect. I've used it to create a chocolate version as well as a raspberry version.

Hmmm, no wonder this tasted just like Mom's.  It's the same recipe just halved.  Her's was taller but tasted exactly the same except for one thing.  She added a teaspoon of lemon juice.  Otherwise perfect

Oh My!  If ever a recipe deserved more than 5 stars this is THE ONE!  It is absolutely delicious. I greased the bottom and sides of the springform pan.  I added finely chopped pecans to the crust and baked for about 5 minutes, allowed the crust to cool and then added the cheesecake mixture to which  I  added 1 teaspoon of almond extract.   Some of our guests wanted plain, strawberry or chocolate sauce.  Either way - it was delicious and well worth making.  Thanks for sharing - this is a definite keeper!

First time making a baked cheescake - this was a hit, no cracking, smooth and creamy.  I doubled my vanilla and picked up the suggestions of less flour,  well wrapped in foil and exactly 60 mins cooking.  Will make again and again.

This is a great recipe. I modified it to make a cheese cake mouse by just beating the egg whites to stiff peaks and whipping the cheese and sugar mixture. You get two pies worth of filling instead of 1, and its wonderful!!

Turned out perfect !!! I would recommend prebaking the crust, mine turned out a little mushy. Also, the recipe makes a little too much batter, but thats okay I just made a mini cheesecake too. I too did a water bath and had no problems with cracking and I love how it makes the cheesecake texture much smoother !

I made this for my husbands birthday dinner and it came out great.  I did not have any sour cream, so it was not added and I don't think it was missed.  My whole family enjoyed this cheesecake.  Thank you for sharing.

I used this recipe to make my first cheesecake I absolutely loved it. I did add 1/2 cup more sugar. I felt like the filling tasted a bit too sour once I added the sour cream. For the crust, I used 1 1/2 cups mixed graham crackers and Nilla wafers combined with 4 tbsps. of melted butter. Mine had one small crack in the middle but that's my fault for not letting the cream cheese get to room temp before mixing it. Everyone who has tried it has loved it!

Made this yesterday for my son's 17th birthday.  After reading other reviews, I only added 2tbsp flour, used a cooking bag for the bath water, swirled in strawberry jam, and even added a top crust.  Everyone loved it!! Was very rich tasting, and could not eat much at a time..

What a disaster! This came out burnt and tasting like a vanilla quiche. VERY eggy, and I cut it to 3 eggs because I had jumbo eggs. As far as I know I did everything right, not much mix, greased edge, water bath, directions to a "T" and cool time. The only thing I can think of is my oven is brand new and may be hotter then everyone else's, or the thermostat is off. I have had way more sucess with other recipes. Scraped off into trash after a few bites it was that bad!

Very easy to make. I didnt have a pan that would hold 1 inch of water, and fit the springform, so i just put a pan of water on rack below. Let sit in oven for 6 hours after time went off. Still cracked. Brought sliced strawberries, chocolate, and caramel for people to put on what they liked. I had one slice with half with stawberries and chocolate, the other half with caramel. Gotta saw, the half with strawberries ws much better. This was good cheesecake, but it wasn't OMG this is AMAZING cheesecake. Would I make it again, don't think so, going to try others

I have never made a cheesecake before so I am thankful this was the first one I tried!  My husband needed one for work so I thought I would give it a shot and it turned out perfect!  I followed the following tips: 1) line springform pan w/ parchment paper, 2) boil water for water bath, 3) use the large heavy duty foil to wrap outside of springform pan to prevent water from entering the springform pan and 4) I let it cool in the oven with the door shut for 6 hours.  There was not one crack in it nor did it sink in the middle and it cooked evenly without browning.  I also let all ingredients warm to room temperature before mixing and I had a very smooth batter.  Since I was sending this to my husband's office I also needed to transfer the cheesecake from my springform pan to a disposable cardboard round (covered in foil) and into a box.  So, I also followed the recommendations of others to make sure the bottom of the springform pan was the raised side and not the other side.  Since I lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper it was easy to transfer to the round.  I simply removed the ring, ran a long flat cake frosting spatula between the parchment and the bottom of the pan and when this raised the cake slightly, I slid the covered cardboard round underneath the cake and it transferred without problem.  Thank you to all the previous reviewers for your comments as I would not have had the success I had without your tips!!!

my family loves this cheese cake. I have made it a bunch. never could get it to not crack until I found Laurell43's review about cooking at a lower temp. I greased and floored the pan and then followed her directions concerning cooking and I finally had one with out cracks. basically she says to cook it a 220 for 3 hours and 40 min.
all I can say is it works for me!
Thank you Laurell43

This is the BEST cheesecake recipe.  I have been making only this recipe for several years.  Even when it cracks occassionally, it is excellent.  I cover up the crack with a topping =].  My husband is a New Yorker and he thinks I make the best cheesecake ever!  Even better than the ones in a New York deli!!!  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.

This cheesecake is GREAT! I made this cake in a water bath and the water had seeped into the crust making it soggy. I made it a second time and not a drop of water went inside. This is what I did: 1) covered the entire bottom & up sides of springform pan w/ foil, baked the crust for 8 mins. 2) after cooled and before filling it, I placed the springform pan into an oven bag and rolled the bag down to the rim of the springform pan making the bag even with the pan. 3) Put springform pan in a roasting pan and placed in oven, filling the roasting pan with water only a 1/4 high up the side of springform pan.. OMG! when it was ready to eat the crust was awesome! I hope tis helps!

Awesome!!!  Everyone who's had it, says it's the best cheesecake they've ever had!!  Served mine with caramel sauce and crushed toblerone the first time.  Then the second time, I put the toppings on the side, cherries, chocolate sauce and butterscotch topping.  Very very good!!!  Definatley take the cream cheese out the night before, I used also used a Kitchen Aid mixer and didn't worry about overmixing, it turned out just fine!!!!  How could it not with 4 containers of cream cheese!!!

OMG is all I can say! I have NEVER made a cheesecake before..I found this recipe, read some of the reviews and decided to try it. I followed the directions exactly, and while my cake cracked a little in the middle while it was baking, I am going ot attribute that to all me :)....It didn't matter though, I wasn't looking for perfection in looks the first time around, the taste, on the other hand was amazing! I read somewhere that I should tap the full pan on the counter a few times before baking to get the excess air out, and I am going to try that this time around. I am fixing to make it again! Thank you so much for the recipe!

The recipe is spot on, with the only omission that all ingredients MUST be at room temp.  Take them out of the fridge at least 2 hrs before you start, or warm them up in the microwave (milk, sour cream, cream cheese).  They have to be room temp when you blend them.  I mix ingredients in the following order to avoid over mixing the eggs: beat cream cheese with sugar and sour cream on low with mixer, then use spatula to mix in milk, eggs one at a time, then add flour and vanilla as you mix the last egg. The less you air up the eggs, the better. I bake for 45 min at 350 without any water bath. I sometimes open to oven in the last 5 min or so to gently shake the pan. If the mix does not jiggle very much, I turn off the oven; otherwise I bake it for a few more min. Cooling it in the oven, with door closed is a must and will help it set and further cook if the middle is still jiggly. Over baking will cause it to crack, very simple. This is an awesome recipe!

If I could give this 20 more stars I would!  This was the very first real cheesecake I ever made and it was a thing of beauty!  I used the water bath as several suggested, and I baked for one hour, turned off the oven and let it sit in the cooling oven for 5 hours.  I also let the cream cheese get to room temp before mixing.  There wasn't one crack and not one single lump!  Cheesecake, it would seem, is not as horribly difficult as it seems to be.  I now have friends and family begging me to make "MY" cheesecake for the next occasion or no occasion at all!  Thank you Chantal!  AND New York!  I have to add some new comments here as I have been using this recipe to make my special cheesecakes that EVERYONE loves and begs for! I've added Raspberry extract, strawberry extract or pumpkin to make great variations.  This week I made an Oreo Cheesecake using an Oreo crust. The next one will be a turtle cheesecake by adding chocolate, caramel and pecans or a Neopolitan making layers of Chantals vanilla, a chocolate layer and a strawberry layer!  This is STILL the best cheesecake recipe ANYWHERE!!!

This cheesecake came out beautiful.  I made 3 of them and had no cracks or sinkage.  I baked as directed, turned off the oven, and left my cheesecakes in the oven over night.  The next morning I refrigerated. They were perfect.  NO WATER BATH, YEAH!!! For those having problems, make sure cream cheese and eggs are room temperature before beginning.  DON'T OVER BEAT.  I just used a plastic mixing spoon to blend all the ingredients together (which is easy to do when your cream cheese is at room temperature).  As a heads up if you are using a dark nonstick pan you'll need to lower the oven temp. I only rated it 4 stars just out of flavor preference.  I like my cheese cakes a little sweeter.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I've been making cheesecakes for years and this is now the recipe I will be using....period.  The only thing I did differently was use heavy cream in place of the milk.  This is a personal preference which I think makes the texture creamier and the overall taste richer.  This is a VERY rich, creamy, decadent cheesecake.  Everyone who tried it raved over it.  Be forewarned; however, a small piece goes a long way!  I like to have several toppings available for people to put on their own piece.  I usually have cherry, strawberry, blueberry, chocolate and caramel in separate containers.  GREAT recipe!!

Absolutely delicious! Mine did crack a little, but I used a hand mixer, which is not as gentle. But, the taste was perfect!! I blended up frozen strawberries with a touch of sugar and I swirled that into the cheesecake! I also made graham crackers for the crust. (The ones in the store have too many artificial preservatives and flavors!) I added a touch of raw sugar to the crust, which was a compliment to the strawberry swirl! My family raved about it! Thank you for such a great recipe!!!!!

This is the best cheesecake recipe I have tried so far. I found it hard to mix at first, but that was because i did not use room temperature ingredients in the beginning. It could have been a lil creamier.

Loved this cheesecake!  It has a wonderful, perfectly smooth texture from the center to the edge.  I've been making cheesecakes for years and made this recipe for Mother's Day.  My family said it was one of the best yet.

This is absolutely the best.  I have made many cheesecakes, but none compare to this.  I used the equivalent of 1 cup of crushed crackers. Usually the crust is sweet and thick.  Not this. I could barely see the crust.  Another plus for me, is the non-cracking of the cake.  Some of my cheesecakes looked like a road map. I tried for the first time using a water bath.  Excellent.  There wasn't even a "hairline" mark.  It was absolutely professional looking.  I have already forewarded this to recipe to my friends.  If you like cheese cake, this is it.  Some reviews that I read stated it was hard to make.  To the contrary, it is simple and the ease of making it is awesome. Thanks for the A+ recipe.

I rated this a 2 for the flavor ONLY. I needed a basic cheesecake recipe in a pinch and was not where I could get to  my own. First: The 2 Tablespoons of butter is not near enough for the crust...more like 5 or 6 Tablespoons are,plus crust needs to be pre-baked 10 minutes to hold together. 2: No cake pan size is stated so I used a basic 9" and had 2 cups of batter left. 3. This cake did not get baked all the way and after being in oven all that time I should have. 4. ALL cheesecakes need to be baked in a water bath. This cake was a disaster and while it tasted good, it was still a litttle bland! Will not use it again or this sight. These recipes need to be tested first. I will use a reliable sight like Foodnetwork.

Absolutely perfect cheesecake as is!  Wonderful smooth taste!  However, we cannot eat such a large dessert, so I wanted to try different sizes.  From one recipe I made 24 bite-sized (1 inch), 24 mini’s (2 inch) and 2 small (4 inch)!!  I did make a second batch of crust. To bake smaller sizes, lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees.  I used paper liners for the 1.5 inch size, ½ teaspoon crust, and baked for 10-12 minutes.  I have a pan (Chicago Metallic) with removable bottoms (2 inch) that I greased and used 1 teaspoon crust and baked for 12-14 minutes.  Lastly I have several 4 inch springform pans that took 2 tablespoons crust and baked for 14-16 minutes. If you have a wooden "tapper," it is very useful to press down the crumb crust, but you could use your fingers or anything the right size.  I placed two pans of water in the oven for increased humidity. I did not have a cracking problem. These freeze well.  Now I can use a few from the freezer in the weeks ahead.   I have topped them with fruits or whipped cream.  Handy and fantastic!  MUCH better in taste and texture than any of the “mini” recipes on this site.

This is awesome! Upon others' reviews, I just added zest of 1 grated lemon and 1 tbsp of lemon juice to suit personal taste and baked at 300 degrees for 1 hour WITHOUT water bath as oven was too cram to accommodate another bigger pot for water bath. I let it sit in the oven for only 1 hour and took it out for complete cooling. Mine came out perfect without any cracks and its best topped with “Supreme Strawberry Topping”, also from this site! Thanks a million, Taliesen for this easy recipe.

I did not care for this recipe. I made it exactly as mentioned and it was very bland. Not tangy and just plain unflavorful. Will not make again.

Folks, I am by no means a beginner baker... but I'll be honest, I was INTIMIDATED by this cake! Mainly because of ALL the reviews. But on the contrary- this was SO easy to make! NO cracks, presentation was phenomenal, and taste was unquestionably 5 stars. I chose to top mine with canned strawberries. Little bakers secret: 1 cup crisco (not butter flavored) 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup veg. oil, mix it all together and you've got yourself a NO FAIL baking pan spread(keep it in a sealed container in your pantry). Brush it on your pan and your cakes will NEVER stick. I don't have a pan large enough to put my springform pan in a 'water bath', so I took another delightful reviewers tip of filling a pan of water and placing it on the rack below the cake, the steam rises and works just as good. YUM-MY, it was devoured at my New Years party, next time I'll have to make two : )

exceptional cake!  I have made NY cheesecakes for years and this is my top recipe.  In fact it is the only one I'll use now.  Thank you for sharing!  It is a wonderfully light and firm cake and the flavors keep you longing for one more bite.

The crust definitely needs about two to three times more butter to make it crusty. I was so afraid to overmix my batter because of all the warnings against it, that I must not have mixed it enough and it didn't set in the middle. I cooked it for an hour at 350 and let it sit in the closed oven for 5 hours, then chilled it, and it still was gooey in the middle. AND it cracked! I'm going to try it again to see if I can make it better.***EDIT***I chilled it for a full 24 hours and it was like a different cake. Besides the crust needing more butter, this was PERFECT! I also took about 3/4 cup of the batter out and added melted chocolate to swirl through. It looked wonderful (except the cracks) and tasted amazing!

Great recipe and technique! My first time making cheesecake and ...... it was a success! I followed recipe and used a suggestion to place a pan of water on the rack below cheesecake.  It worked like a charm, no cracks.  Second time I added a little lemon juice to cake and a bit of almond extract to the crust - just the way I like it.

Perfect cheesecake!! Okay so I agree with another user, if you mess this recipe up its your fault, not the recipe. I live in Colorado so here are directions for anyone at high elevation: 1. Use extra large eggs, and grease well with shortening. 2. Bake in preheated 350 deg oven middle rack in a water bath for 1hr 30 min. 3. DO NOT use foil to wrap your spring form pan, the water will leak through, use an oven bag and leave it open on the top. 4. Cover the top of the cheesecake with foil (tent form); because of our elevation the top will brown before the center is anywhere near done, remove foil after 45min, bake for an additional 45min uncovered. 5. Once the cheesecake is done baking run a butter knife around edge to help the cake pull away from the side so it does not stick and crack. 6. turn off oven and leave in the oven  as recomemned, then cool in refrigerator. Now onto the crust: I used 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1 1/2 tbs cinnamon, and 5tbs melted butter. Toppings: I made a raspberry sauce. I used 2 tbs butter, 1 1/2 tbs raspberry extract and 1 1/2 tbs vanilla ectract, 2/3 cup water, 1 tbs honey, 4 tbs sugar, 1 package fresh raspberries. Combine ingredients in a medium sauce pan over medium heat. Mash raspberries with a potato masher, bring to boil, reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is thick, cool and enjoy!!!! ( I pipe some into my cheesecake batter while it is in the pan so it cooks with some raspberry saue in the cheesecake.)

For people having problems, try cooking the cheesecake at 300 degrees F for 1 to 1.5 hours.  Also, a water bath may be used for gentle even heating.  Just make sure to wrap the outside of your springform pan with foil so water does not leak into the pan.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I've been making Chantel's cheesecake for several years.  My suggestion for using a water bath (and i very much recommend it) is to put the water bath into the oven while the oven is preheating.  Once you are ready to put your cheesecake into the oven, put it on the rack ABOVE and directly over the bath instead of inside the pan.  You can still wrap aluminum around the pan.  Putting the water bath into the oven while it is preheating creates a moist invironment for the cheesecake which in turn will produce one with less cracks or hopefully none at all.

I bake a lot of cheesecakes and I have to say this recipe is simply the best! I'm going to use it as a base now for all my cheesecake recipes. To try a variation -- split the recipe in half (make two smaller batches) and add 4 squares of melted baker's chocolate to one of the batches. Pour the chocolate batch in first and then the vanilla one on top and swirl gently with a knife. I make this with an oreo crust. It's fabulous! Make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature to prevent lumps. Next time I will follow other's advice and bake at 325* (mine burned ever so slightly). I love this recipe and so does everyone who eats it!

Very creamy, very good. I baked it at 325 like others suggested. But I took it out of the oven after one hour, let cool on counter and then put in the fridge over nite. It set up well, looked great and tasted wonderful.

This is a good recipe. Although, what I found interesting is that it is the exact same recipe (word for word) that I found on the back of the springform pan that I just purchased.

HELP!! okay, after seeing all the reviews i had to try this. it was my first time and i think it went pretty smooth. although i ran into a little problem, i prepared everything according to what the directions said except they dont really have sour cream where im currently living and i did some research and substituted it with plain yogurt. im not sure if that caused the problem. i put it in the oven at 2pm and turned off the oven at 3. let it sit in there for an hour till it cooled to room temp, i then moved it into the Air conditioned room since im in the dessert and its hot here, to cool for an additional 2hrs, i had no cracks but the center was still a bit wiggly so i put it in the fridge for another 2hrs. STILL wiggly! its 11pm now and the cake has been in the freezer for an hr and the center is still not firm. what went wrong? is it fixable? help :( im still giving this 5 stars because i feel the problem was caused by me not the recipe. UPDATE: ok after 8 hrs it finally firmed up. no cracks no sinks just beautiful creamy heaven. the first piece i sliced had a bite gone before i even got the topping on it. i should have made two. NOTE: make sure you leave plenty of time for it to rest and firm up, overnight if possible.

I've made this cheesecake at almost every family get together and people always ask for it again.  Just a hint: Don't use fat free cream cheese! It comes out chunky and watery. This recipe is perfect just the way it is. I like to add fresh blackberries or strawberries.  Yummm.

Wow, this is an amazing recipe. The cheesecake is smooth, creamy and delicious! I made some modifications per other user's suggestions-- wrapped the springform pan in aluminimum, baked in a roasting pan water bath with 1 inch of hot boiling water, reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup, and added to the crust ingredients (used 1 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon powder, 3 tbsp more of butter, and a splash of vanilla.). All the ingredients were at room temperature.  After baking for 1 hour at 350 degrees, I left it in there for another 2 hours, then transferred to the fridge for overnight. The cheesecake came out perfect! I made some strawberry compote to put on top, but just plain, it was to die for. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

I had such high hopes for this recipe based on all of the reviews, but I think it was my own fault that it did not turn out *perfectly*. First off, I left the cream cheese to soften on the counter for about 2 hours, which was not enough time. I should have either left it out longer before using it, or tried to soften it in the microwave, as my beater would not cut through the cheese, leaving it somewhat chunky. I was afraid of over-beating it so I left it with some chunks. Also, when adding the flour, sour cream and vanilla, I should have added each one individually, because when I added them together the vanilla stuck to the flour and ended up making small chunks in the batter. Otherwise, the recipe was really delicious.

This is a very outstanding basic cheesecake recipe. I have added cocoa powder to make it chocolate. I like to put mine is a water bath to prevent cracking. For all of you who watch Food Network, Alton Brown's Good Eats has an excellent episode with some great cheesecake tips, so try to watch it!** UPDATE** Here are some of the tips from the episode: 1. put cheesecake in pan (same shape but bigger) filled with 2 quarts of WARMED water 2. after cooking, turn off oven, open for one minute, then close and leave cheesecake in for one hour 3. Add one tablespoon of cornstarch to mix before adding sugar- it helps keep it from cracking.

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  It turned out wonderful!  He loved it.  I don't know if I liked the texture.  Didn't seem dense enough to me.  It was very simple.  I do want to mention that it will not look done when you turn off the oven.  It will continue to cook and lighly brown like a normal cheesecake while it gradually cools in the oven.  I would highly suggest this receipe!

This does make a great tasting cheesecake...however I wish that the recipe had indicated to bake it in a water bath.  That is my only complaint....and being a novice cheesecake baker this tidbit of info would have been helpful.  

***Update 12/2/8.  I made this recipe again.  Two changes - all of the ingredients were at room temp & I DID bake it in a water bath this time.  This made ALL the difference.  The cheesecake was PERFECT this time.

FANTASTIC!! Im from NY and this is how it should be. Important tip: Make sure the cream cheese is a room temp, and DO NOT OVER MIX! I wrapped foil around the spring form and put a pie pan filled with water on the lower shelf of the oven. DO NOT, DO NOT open the oven to peek at all. This will put cracks in the cake. And make sure to leave in the oven for at least five hours after cooking. Again do not open the door I know its hard, but will be worth it. Make the night ahead so it can chill. One of the best recipes yet. Thank you!

This is a great recipe! I made the cheesecake mix as directed but put them in cupcake tins instead of a pie tin. I pressed the graham cracker crust into the cupcake tins using a cup and then filled them up with the cheesecake. Baked at 350 for about 25 minutes or until the cheesecake is set in the middle. When they cooled I topped them with frosting. It's fun to watch people take a bite expecting a regular cupcake and get so much more! I followed the instructions in the recipe and also used the tips from the cheesecake articles from all recipes. If you've never made cheesecake before or if yours doesn't turn out I'd consult the recipes. Cheesecake is very delicate!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever made. Ive made this about 3 times and never had a crack. I changed the crust after reading the other reviews. You really do have to use room temp. indgredients and a water bath. I let mine cool in the oven as long a posible then over night in the fridge, the texture is much better.

Followed the recipe *exactly*. The crust did not stay together. The cheesecake itself was not very sweet, in fact it didn't really have much of a flavor at all. The texture was really nice and smooth but this is not a NEW YORK cheesecake. Where's the tang? You can't even taste the cream cheese -- isn't that the point of "cheesecake"? I salvaged by making balls of the filling, freezing, then dipping into melted bittersweet chocolate. THAT was good. This recipe, not so much.

Well to start, the crust doesn't have enough butter to hold it together.  Also it wasn't very tasty.  The cheesecake's texture was all wrong.  I prefer cheesecake to be rich, dense, creamy and smooth.  I knew as soon as I added the milk and it went all runny that it was wrong and adding the flour just makes it worse, because that is the texture you feel as you eat it.  Fluff and flour.  Flavor wise, it was just ok.  The first couple bites are alright, but then the blandness and bad texture completely kills it.  Not even topping helps at that point.  Thanks for the effort and I'm glad many people seem to enjoy it.  To each their own.  I will never use this recipe again however.

This recipe ROCKS. This was my first time to make a cheesecake; made it for our poker night to celebrate two birthdays, and guests loved it. I read all the reviews and the secret to the cake not cracking really is to run the knife around the edge when it finishes baking. I served with cherry pie filling and it was creamy and delicious. Because of a time challenge, I chilled it straight from the oven and it was great. Next time I'll chill it overnight. I baked it in a round Pampered Chef stoneware dish with a pan of boiling water on the rack beneath, and it was great. This is a keeper! Thanks for the post! **Update 8/31/08** Made for a Labor Day party and again it was a hit. I didn't let it chill overnight yet, but hubby went back for seconds. Note: use white all-purpose flour in the cheesecake, not wheat. I used wheat flour and it left little specks in the cheesecake, but fortunately this didn't affect the taste. Only one small crack but maybe because I let it cool for 20 mins then put in fridge on the coldest setting. Once it cooled enough I put it in the freezer for about 30 mins. This time, there was almost 2 cups of batter left over.

The cheesecake part was good. I tried making it in mini cupcake pans and I burnt burnt burnt the bottoms. I'm not sure if it was my oven or what. I usually make cheesecake in a clear glass pan. I will make again but not as mini cheesecakes. Any suggestions for making them in a mini cupcake pan please share. Also i used paper cupcake holders, do the aluminum ones work better?

Rich and delicious cheesecake! I didn't do the water bath but did put a glass oblong pirex with hot water in the shelf below. I got some cracks but it was for opening the oven several times to peek after it was done since I don't have an oven window! But I fixed it with an icing spatula after it firmed in the fridge. I added kiwis, strawberries and grapes to decorate. Every one loved it and was even fighting over last pieces! If you want a picture perfect plain cheesecake, please follow the instructions given in the reviews below the recipe.

I wish I had read more of the reviews before I made this cheesecake.   While it was tasty it does have a grand cayon of a crack and is a bit brown on the top.

What I've learned:   DON'T OVERWHIP.   Make sure you blend the cream cheese smooth BEFORE you add the eggs and then mix as little as possible.  Cook at 325...350 is too hot and results in a brown cake.

Good taste though.

I have baked this a couple of times, first following some reviewers' comments to decrease flour and then once following the recipe exactly. Everyone loved both of them, but it was much better following the recipe and not decreasing flour. I did use a different crust recipe that was suggested by some of the reviewers the second time, and it was much better. I also baked it with a pan of water on the shelf below it, and let it sit for a few hours before removing it from the oven. It was perfect with no cracks.

My favorite cheesecake recipe of all times. Very easy to make and very delicious, with one minor alteration... juice of one lemon. A great hit at every party I bring this to.

Absolutely incredible!  I even accidently put too much sourcream in it and it still turned out great!   Next time I will use 20 "sheets" of graham crackers and 4 tablespoons butter as my husband likes a thicker crust.  I cooked it in a water bath and left it in the oven for the recommended 6 hours.  Wow!  It was magazine picture perfect.  You might as well throw out every other recipe--you won't need another.  It deserves more than 5 stars.

WOW. Just WOW. 

I made this cheesecake to celebrate an early Easter dinner with my parents & everyone was floored at how incredibly delicious it was. My MOM couldn't get over how perfectly even the top of the cake was & when I released the spring part from the base of the pan, I couldn't help but smile at how beautiful it looked! Like something I might have bought at a bakery but BETTER!

That doesn't even begin to describe the flavor, the perfect texture, the creaminess, etc. This is my new cheesecake recipe & I will NEVER use another. I think I even made my little sister (the world's best baker) jealous -  up until now her cheesecake was hands down best. We're having a "cake-off" in May.

One thing I may change in the future, a tblsp more butter to the crust as it seemed it could have used a tad more. Also, I will grate some fresh lemon rind into the batter. That's how my mom always does it, and despite it tasting fantastic, that was the one thing missing that I am used to.

The only other thing I did different from the recipe was I only had time to leave it in the oven for 2 hours post baking. Then I refrigerated for a full 24 hours prior to serving.

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! GREAT recipe!!!

A MILLION starts for this recipe! You CAN NOT GO WRONG with this one! This was my FIRST attempt, EVER, at making cheesecake. This is a fool proof recipie. No lumps, no cracks, it was PERFECTION! I ended up with a 9 inch with a homemade crust and a 9 inch that was premade.. I sent one home with the inlaws. This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe was just "OK."  Tastes like store bought cheesecake and nothing compared to Cheesecake Factory or authentic New York Cheesecake.  Sorry, but I love pure, thick, creamy, cheesecake and this definitely is not it.  I received mixed reviewes about this.  From cheesecake lovers, they could not eat even more than a very thin slice.   HOWEVER, I have many diabetics in my family and they say this is good for those with diabetes or are border line.  I suggest using the egg whites and only and using heavy cream.  Sorry, I'm going to keep looking.  Definitely not worth the time it took to make.

I prefer a creamy, dense cheesecake and wanted to see if this recipe was better without the flour and milk.  So I made two cheesecakes - one with those ingredients and one without.  Both came out great and were equally delicious.  However, the one without the flour and milk was a bit too creamy even for me.  The texture of the one with the flour and milk was perfect.

I still haven't mastered making cheesecake that is all one color on top and that does not crack even the slightest bit. I am going to try next time whipping the egg whites to stiff peaks before adding them, lining the pan with foil and cooking the cake in a waterbath, and makign sure I don't open the coor or do anything until the next day, leaving it in the oven all night.

I baked this for our Xmas family dinner.  Actually I made this before but I gave the whole cake to my friend at that time so I didn't have a chance to taste it!  Wow!  This cake is amazing!  This exactly is my type ;) As many of reviewers suggested, I baked the cake in water bath, and at 325F for an hour then left it in the oven for an hour.  It didn't crack on the surface at all!  I also used a strainer when I poured the batter into a pan so that the texture would be smooth. I made "Blueberry Sauce by Isybel" on this site and poured it on the cake!  Perfect combination!! (Can you see my posted picture?)

YUMMY!  I can't believe how creamy, yet firm this cheesecake is.  I started mixing my ingredients and realized I didn't have any eggs so I had to leave the cream cheese and sugar mixture sit at room tempature for about a hour.  The finished product still tasted amazing!  I think it would be very hard to mess this one up.  Word of caution - make darn sure ALL of your ingredients are at room temp.  I put the vanilla extract directly from fridge to mixing bowl and it formed some small pods in the filling.  It didn't hurt the taste at all and actually made for a neat inner appearance.  Lucky, I guess!  I'm very thankful I chose this recipe.  Delicious!

I don't think I've ever made a cheesecake quite this perfect! I used heavy cream in place of the milk. And instead of a springform pan, I used 2 store bought graham cracker crusts.  I placed the cheesecakes on the top rack, and a pan filled with water in the second rack.  My cakes didn't crack whatsoever, and was so pretty!!

first time i tried it out, i got no cracks, even w/o a water bath. the next 3 times, all have had cracks. i think it's in part that i was using 2 different ovens, so i'll attempt the water bath for when i use the oven at my house. also, i find that the crust needs about 1 Tb more butter. what i've done in the past is take 1/3 of the batter, add 1/2 cup of melted chocolate chips and mix it, then pour it into the white batter in the springform pan and use a knife to cut into it and make swirls. and the result- a great looking chocolate marbled cheesecake!

Very good. I used a little less sour cream as suggested on other reviews and added half a cup of milk chocolate chips after putting the batter into the pan too. A water bath is definitely needed and in order to keep the cheesecake white and professional looking only cool it in the oven for 1 hour. If it does pop up at the edges or turn discolored in any area just use a hot wet knife to level it out, or just cover with some delicious preserves! Again very very good and very impressive to guests

I can't say enough how much I LOVE this cheesecake. I've made it at least a dozen times, and here's what I do different:  I use the Graham Cracker Crust I recipe from this site for the crust. Make sure all my ingredients are at room temp, it really does help keep your batter from being lumpy. Beat my sugar and cream cheese until smooth and then use a wooden spoon for the rest of the mixing. I don't have a 9" spring form, so I bake in a 10". When using a 10", decrease baking time by about 10 minutes. Be sure to grease the sides of the pan! My pan won't fit in a water bath so I place a 9x13 pan filled with water on the bottom rack. Leave it in the oven for the full 5-6 hours to cool and voila, perfection!!!

The cheesecake exceeded my expectations on my first attempt! It looked and tasted fantastic (and more importantly, it was as if the cake had been baked by a professional), and everyone who had a slice gave it two thumbs up. I baked this cheesecake again for my uncle -my second attempt- and his family of four finished it in 2 days! According to him, it was so good they had it after every meal; even for supper! Thank you Chantal for this amazing recipe!

Delicious! The crust needed to be sweetened a little. A friend suggested the following crust: 15 graham crackers, crushed; 1/4 cup butter, melted; 2 tablespoons sugar; 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour; pat into a springform and bake for 5 minutes. Let cool completely before pouring cheesecake filling over. I opted to bake in a water bath, and it turned out better than I expected. I left everything else the way it was; the cheesecake was phenomenal! Everyone who has tried it loved it! I've baked 3 so far; my fourth one will come soon.

Definitely NOT the best cheesecake I've had.  It was not cream cheese-y enough.  The crust was also not very good; needed sugar.  Easy to make bake but will not make again.  OK but not great.

AMAZING! I decided to use 9 inch Keebler Ready Crust (Graham Cracker) and it yielded two cheesecakes plus extra batter. They were soo good and gone in a week! Also my first cheesecake and the recipe was easy to follow. A+!

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made.  I baked it in a waterbath as described by other reviewers.  I also used fat free sour cream and 2 things of fat free cream cheese, two regular.  3 T of butter on the crust too.  This was probably the best tasting cheesecake I've ever had.  I topped it with the Supreme Strawberry Topping on this site and some homemade whipped cream.  But it was good with or without the topping. The next time I'll probably make more of the graham cracker crust and put it on the sides as well.  Excellent recipe!  Thank you!

This cheesecake recipe is the best recipe I have ever gotten. I shared a few pieces of this cake with co-workers and my sister got mad at me because she wanted it all to herself. I had to make more. It was really that good!!!! Thanks.

Excellent!  I halved the filling and put it in a store-bought graham cracker crust since I don't have a springform pan.  I think this will be my standard cheesecake recipe from now on.

WOW this is goood cheesecake!!!  I catered my mom-in-law's 60th birthday party and wanted to make something special and this fit the bill.  There were 30+ people there and they all raved about how good this cheesecake was.  There was a fantastic chocolate cake there also and the cheescake went first (very quickly!) and half the cake was left.  Many people asked for the recipe, they commented on how moist and the sweetness was just right.  My oven cooks hot so I lowered the temp 25 degrees, and I put a baking pan on the shelf below the cheesecake and half filled it with hot water before putting in the cheesecake (waterbath), and left it in for the time recommended.  After I turned the oven off and left the cake in the closed oven for several hours as recoomended I forget and left it an extra hour, no problems it was picture perfect like out of a bakery and delicious as well.  WELL DONE and thanks for the excellent recipe!

I brought this cheesecake to a dinner party and everyone loved it.  The hostess even said it was the best cheesecake she's ever had.  It was pretty easy to make, and mine did crack--it was my fault. But this did not affect the taste though.

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake and it came out great. I did the water bath and it cracked regardless. Put some cherry pie filling on top and no one knew. I was only able to leave it in the over for 3 hours, but that didn't seem to matter.

I made this over the holidays and it was a definite hit.  My boyfriend, friends, and family all raved about how good it was.  The first 2 I made didn't crack, but the third did - however this did not affect the taste, it just didn't look as pretty.  Nobody cared because it was still so good.  I also would say to either heat the cream cheese a tiny bit or let it get to room temperature.  I also heated up the milk so that it wouldn't cause lumps.  Great stuff!!

My family RAVED about this cheesecake at Christmas.  I was unsure about it since it didn't look like it was done baking in the oven.  I trusted the recipe so I turned off the oven and let it sit for 6 hours.  It did not crack in the slightest.  When I pulled the cheesecake from the fridge I warned everyone that it may not be good since I wasn't sure if it was cooked.  The entire thing was gone in a matter of minutes.  I only got a small bite from my husbands piece.  Everyone raved about it and is requesting that I make them more.  That's all anyone could talk about for the rest of the day.  Today I am baking 4 more cheesecakes for them.  This is the only recipe I will ever use again.

Wow! First time making any cheesecake in general and very surprised! This recipe is defineatly an esteem booster. It's very easy to make and the result is great. It's very important to make sure that the springform pan that you bake the cake in, is leak-proof. Even though i wrapped mine in aluminum foil before baking in the water bath, some water still got in. It didn't ruin the cake, but i got scared it would. Other than that, just follow the tips found on this web-site about how to bake a cheesecake and you're set! Great recipe! Thank you!

Wow!  if you like yor cheesecake thick and rich, try this recipe!  I screwed it up the first time I attempted it (I only used 2 packages of cream cheese) and it still wasn't bad. The second time I made it exacty as directed and it was the best cheesecake I have ever had!  I used a water bath in the oven and it only cracked a tiny bit.  If you have a holiday party to attend and want to make an great impression, make this cheesecake!

Simply amazing. I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar to the crust (thanks to whoever suggested that!) but I didn't change a thing about the filling, which turned out delicious: dense and creamy, yum!

This recipe is great! we do not have graham crackers here so i used digestive biscuits instead. Leaving the cheesecake in the oven to cool for at least 5 to 6 hours is very important to prevent cracking.My frens whom I hosted raved about this cheesecake! yummy!

This is the first time that I made a baked cheese cake.  Only used 1/4 of the ingredients and made a 6-inch cake.  Baked for 30 mins in water bath.  Only left in oven for 20 mins after baking and no cracks!

This was my first cheesecake and it turned out wonderful. Everyone loved it. My only complaint was the graham cracker crust.  Next time I will add sugar to the butter and graham crackers to sweeten it up a bit. Otherwise, fantastic recipe!

Amazing.. omg so luscious and creamy. I put a little less milk and flour and a bit more sour cream.. best thing ever, people thought I bought it and then told me that they loved me... 
I guess that counts for a compliment. Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly, and I ended up having enough crust to make two cheesecakes and enough filling to make about 4. I cooked it for an hour and it was burned(over cooked and brown even in the center) and cracked by the time it finished cooking and tasted very bland. I used the mix again to make a second one and added some more vanilla and amaretto and also turned the temperature down to 300. It looks better and hopefully it will taste better but we will see..

Wonderful and easy cheesecake!!!! WOW!!!! This cheesecake has a perfect texture and lightness. For those of you who can't get graham crackers (I now live in Scotland), use McVittie's Digestives for the crust instead. They're not quite as crisp as the graham crackers, but give you the same flavor.

This was okay but not the best cheesecake I've ever had.  Could have been richer I think - to make it more indulgent.  But it was so easy to make!  I actually halved the filling recipe and baked mine in a pie pan.  I 'freestyled' the crust because I wanted mine nice and thick.  To the crust I added finely chopped walnuts, 2 Tbsp sugar, and a dash of cinnamon.  I used a water bath and left mine in the oven for about 3 hours - no cracks!  It was beautiful!  I think I will keep this recipe but maybe look out for another cheesecake recipe to try next time.

I made this for Easter dinner and served it with strawberry sauce.  It was absolutely wonderful!  It was also my first time making a cheesecake.  The crust came out a little thick for a 9" springform pan.  I did use 15 "whole" graham crackers (meaning two squares = 1 cracker), so I'm thinking that may have been the reason why mine came out so thick.  I also had a little of the cheese mixture left over that didn't fit into the pan.  So next time I make this, I will probably put it in a larger springform pan (maybe 10-11").  The top did crack slightly in one spot - but not that big of a deal.  I will try using a water bath next time, as others suggested.  I will definately make this again! UPDATE: Made this for Christmas Eve 2014 - Used 15 graham cracker squares and a 9" pan and did exactly as Morena suggested, and it turned out PERFECT. No waterbath, no cracks, perfect amount of crust & filling!

Everyone liked it. As a native New Yorker, I thought some lemon rind would have made it 5-star. I prepared a brown sugar-based caramel sauce to accompany the cake and that was a big hit. I also made the nutty crust-delicious- mentioned here. I used a water pan on the rack under the cake in the oven (325 degrees), let it sit for only 1 hour with the door open, ran a knife around the crust, and put in the fridge. No cracks. Thanks for the recipe, Chantal.

Great cheesecake, easy to prepare!  When I make cheesecakes, or minature cheesecakes in muffin papers, I usually have problems with cracking or the middle will sink a little.  I always mix up an 8 oz. container of sour cream to 2 heaping tablespoons of granulated sugar.  Pour or spoon that over the cheesecake, while the cheesecake is warm.  It will fill in any cracks, and leave a smooth shiny topping that sets like a gelatin.  Works everytime!  You can then even put your berry toppings or cinnamon.

Cook time is WAY TOO LONG! I cooked it for 20 minutes less than stated and it was too long. Do not leave it in the over for as long as stated either for that was prt of the problem. Top got way too dark for a cheesecake. The crust needs more graham crackers to make a solid crust and a heck of a lot more butter. I had to use over half a cup just to have the graham cracker totally coated to press. Not a very good recipe! Won't make again.

Wonderful!  I had no problems with the cake cracking.  I left it in the oven to cool down and then refrigerated overnight.  It has a wonderful flavor and consistency.  I have found that letting all of my ingredients set to room temperature helps in preventing the cake from cracking.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!! I halved the recipe to fit a 7 inch round cake pan. It wasn't a springform pan, so I had to freeze the baked and cooled cake for about an hour. Then dip the cake pan in a pan of hot water. Invert the pan onto a temporary plate, then invert it onto another plate and decorate. I topped it with cherry pie filling. This is a very dense and delicious cheesecake. Something you would pay ridiculously at restaurants. 2 thumbs up!!

Excellent flavor and texture. The water bath is essential! I have tried this recipe three times by leaving it in the oven for 6 hours. All three times, the top cracked. On the fourth try I used a water bath.....no cracks! I have also cut down on the vanilla because we prefer a more cheesey sourcream flavor. Thanks for sharing!

This was a BIG hit!  I bake from the home and received 4 new orders right off the bat from the party of the first cheesecake.  My fiance was a tad jealous, so I made him one as well, but tried to hurry the process.  DON'T!!  It didn't come out as dense and it cracked more than the grand canyon.  I DEFINATELY suggest the room temperature ingredients, be sure to keep in the oven for the 5 hours after baking, and I can’t put enough emphasis on the water bath!  Good Luck!  And bring a glass of milk!

This recipe was just awesome!  I have tried other cheesecake recipes and have never found one that was this easy and this delicious!  I had no problems with it cracking and the texture was smooth and creamy.  I was very careful not to overmix and it resulted in the perfect cheesecake.  I think the next time I make this I am going to try it sugar/fat free...or as close as I can get to that.  Thank you Chantal for your recipe!

LOVE this recipe! I've made it a few times now and I've had to make some adjustments in order for it to look the way I want it to. I used a stick of butter for my crust because it didn't seem to hold together as well for me. Use room temperature ingredients from the fridge and do not over mix! Drop the spring form pan a couple of times on the counter to let any air bubbles rise to the top. I also used a water bath. Very important step! Get a big roasting pan, put that spring form pan in an oven bag and give it a bath. I don't trust the foil route! I barely trusted the oven bag. That made all the difference in the world in how the finished product looked for me. The taste has never changed, it's been delicious from the first time I made this! Thank you for sharing the recipe! I looked everywhere and with all the reviews and ratings, I chose this one and it's the only one you'll ever need! KUDOS!

Wonderful!  Followed the recipe with exact specificity.  No additions, substitutions, omissions, or "water baths". This was the first time I ever used a spring form pan. After 6 hours, I removed the cheesecake from the oven and was not cracked (another first).  In fact, it looked amazing.  The top was a chocolate brown.  The sides were a nice, light brown.  My wife and I loved the creamy texture and absolute, perfect deliciousness. This recipe (as is) is a keeper!

This is by far the best cheesecake I've ever had.  It was perfect in every way... Creamy and rich with a great vanilla taste and not too sweet either.  Even Cheesecake Factory has nothing on this one.  I read some of the other reviewer's suggestions and made just a few changes.  I added half a teaspoon of almond extract to the batter which gave the flavor just a little bit of something extra but no one could tell what it was.  I made sure to use regular cream cheese instead of lower fat as well as light cream instead of milk.  I lowered the oven temp by 10 degrees as a reviewer suggested as I didn't want the top to brown too much and it baked for the required time.  My oven temp might be a little warmer than it reads on the display anyway.  I put the cheesecake into a hot water bath while cooking which really helped bake it perfectly.  Be sure to wrap the pan in two layers of foil so the water doesn't get into the cheesecake while baking.  Lastly, I left the cheesecake in the oven, with it turned off and the door cracked open, so it would cool slowly for about an hour.  Then I let it cool on the counter a few hours before refrigerating it.  The result was a perfect looking and tasting dessert with no cracks at all.  This cheesecake needed no topping because it was wonderful without anything added.  I am throwing away any other cheesecake recipes I have and just make this one.

Love!
12 
 1.My 1st cheesecake EVER. I knew nothing! Cracks? Water baths? Huh? I was certain I would ruin this and not know why.
2. EASY PREP. I used a mixer for cream cheese and sugar only, wooden spoon for the rest, as suggested by someone else. (Ok so far, plenty of time to mess it up)
3. I added almond extract (I like it)
4. Used a hot water bath because I saw it in other recipes and got confused...I think this is ok
5. After an hour, oven off, I peeked and saw that cc was caramel colored and sunken in the middle. (was that ok? Who knows...  optimism dropping)
6. 30 min later worried about water bath, Googled, found out that not using foil around the pan, like me, in the bath, makes crust soggy. :/  whoops -- not very optimistic 
7. Immediately pulled it out of the oven, out of the water, then back in the oven.  (was that bad? Maybe. Probably ruined)
8. Left it in oven overnight. 7ish hrs. (was that too long? Definitely ruined)
9. In the morning CC was flat, pulled away from sides of pan and"crackless" (apparently all good things--maybe its ok)
10. Didn't know when to take it out of the pan, waited till last minute (did I mess up the crust? The easiest part?) carefully used icing spatula to get it off the bottom of pan. NP.
11. Crust edges a little soggy, but dried up after an hour. (not bad)
12. Best cheesecake my family had ever eaten! (shucks :) ) creamy on the inside, not too sweet, delicious alone or with the blueberry glaze prepared by my daughter! I am so exited.

Turned out perfect! Cheesecake came out beautiful and no cracks. I cooked in a water bath and changed the crust a little. I crushed the 15 graham crackers and it seemed like a lot. I looked up a recipe for a basic cheesecake crust. Mix 1 1/2 graham cracker crumbs with 1/3 butter and 1/3 c sugar. Bake crust at 350 for 8 min and then fill with cheesecake batter and bake another hour. Perfect.

I just made this recipe. And it is probably the best cheesecake I have ever tried. Tastes professional. I wasn't sure how many cups of graham cracker crumbs 15 cookies would be so I added melted butter to the crumbs and kept adding till the crust was As thick as I like it. I also added a splash of lemon juice though I can't taste it. I used 1% milk and low fat sour cream as that's all I had. For the vanilla I used vanilla bean paste. I followed the baking instructions but did not do a water bath. Cheesecake turned out amazing although there was a Crack which didn't matter as I cut up slices anyway. The cake tasted the best the next day. I have distributed this recipe to everyone who tried It. Thanks for an amazing recipe.

11/27/15 I had to update my review.  I just made this cheese cake again and it was wonderful.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was perfect yet again.  Don't be afraid of the reviews that bash the taste, the work, or how easy it is to crack.  Dive in, fear not and use a pan of water under your cheese cake.

This is the best cheesecake recipe I have tried.  I've made it about half a dozen times and it comes out perfect each and every time.  The trick is to stick a pan of water on a rack under the cheesecake to keep it from cracking.  Then just let it sit; don't move it, don't put it in the fridge just let it finishing cooling in the oven.  You won't be disappointed.  This has made me a hero in my house.   Thank you.

I've never left a review for any recipe before. I am not a good cook/baker. I have always wanted to try baking a cheesecake, but was always too intimidated. My 15 year old daughter loves cheesecake so she convinced me to try this recipe with her. We followed this exactly as written with all ingredients close to room temperature. The video was very helpful. This cake is AMAZING!! If I'd known I could make something this good I wouldn't have waited till I was 50 years old to try. Now I need to figure out how to make a good fruit topping and how to freeze slices. THANK YOU for this great recipe!!

This cheesecake is amazing! Light and delicious. I followed the recipe to the letter. Even the 5 hours in the (off) oven. I used a 9 inch springform and it filled it and made for a tall cheesecake. This recipe I will use again most definitely.

Delicious! I followed he recipe exactly except two small exceptions. (1) I used the crust recipe on the back of the crushed graham cracker box (1-1/4 c. Crushed graham crackers, 1/4 c. Sugar, 5 T. Butter). (2) The whole reason I was making a cheesecake was to use some guava butter I made earlier that turned out a little runny. I poured half the batter into the pan, added a few spoonfuls of guava butter, poured the rest of the batter in the pan, drizzled a few more spoonfuls of guava butter, and then swirled with a knife. I followed the baking directions as they are printed and it turned out perfectly! Impressive presentation!

First of all, it made 2- 9" cheesecakes which I was not expecting. I had to make another graham crust to use all the batter. I had to use way more butter for crust then what says cuz other wise don't stick. Although tastes good, making a cheese cake for  the first time, I relied on recipe to be accurate and it wasn't.

I made it lower fat, lower sugar, and lower carb. with fat-free cheese, sucralose, stevia, whole wheat flower, unsweetened almond milk, light sour cream and egg substitutes. I also made it crustless b/c one of my fave NY Cheesecakes is crustless. I like how it came out. I think that it tastes rich and good =).

YOUR LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME IF YOU MAKE THIS CHEESECAKE.
there i was, an innocent amatuer baker, when i stumbled upon this cheesecake recipe. what fun! how delicious! seems simple enough! holy  that's a lot of cream cheese! all of these were among my thoughts as i prepared to make this cake. and they all proved true. but i was not prepared for the enormity of cheesecake i would be creating. IT IS MASSIVE DO NOT LET IT INTO YOUR HOME IT WILL TAKE OVER YOUR LIFE.

I love this recipe! I followed it step by step, never making a cheesecake in my life, and it turned out perfect. It was a big hit in my family I am being asked to do this cheesecake for the next family holiday event. I am 13 years old and it was such a simple recipe to follow, if I can follow it being so young anyone else can do it. I recommended this recipe to anyone who wants to make a cheesecake and has never done it before. However, i do recommend to look up tutorials on YouTube about making a cheesecake, you would be able to get lots of tips and tricks on how to make the perfect cheesecake, and you'll be worry free when you want to make it.

This recipe was great! It was my first time making cheesecake and it came out absolutely wonderful.
I made sure everything was at room temp and i mixed everything by hand with a whisk...I was afraid i  would over mix the cheesecake. My efforts were paid off and i came out with a beautiful cheesecake.

I think this is basically a great recipe for New York style Cheesecake. I made it the first time as instructed with the exception of adding sugar, cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg to my crust mixture. I also let the ingredients come to room temperature, wrapped the bottom up the sides of my pan in aluminum foil, and baked in a water bath. I ended up with an overly brown top, no cracks, and too wet in the middle for my taste. I like a creamy, yet fairly firm texture. This is a recipe for those who like their NY Cheesecake's VERY creamy.

I made it again and changed a little more up. The first time, after adding the flour last I had noticed more lumps. This time I whisked about 2/3 cup of milk (instead of the 3/4)and the 1/4 cup of flour in a bowl before adding to the cream cheese/ sugar mixture. I added the eggs last after the rest of the ingredients, then detached the bowl and stirred a bit by hand. I baked the cake in the oven at 325 for 1 hour and let it cool inside for 3 hours. I opened the door and left it for another hour before storing in the fridge.
I ended up with a beautiful top, a creamy but firm texture,and enjoyed it more to my liking. I added these alterations to my comment, because several people tweak recipes to their liking and even though it changes some, it is so other people can read this and try it to appease a preferred taste or texture similar to mine. This recipe is great for tweaking or leaving as is.

OMG...this recipe is rediculously delicious!  I made the filling exactly as written, and filled 2 premade graham crusts.  I put both cheesecakes on large cookie sheet, poured approximately 4 cups water on bottom of pan to create a "water bath," baked 350 for 45 minutes, turned oven off and let sit for roughly 2 1/2 with door closed.  Amazing...I would even go as far to say that this cheesecake was so incredibly delicious it has become my very favorite dessert ever!

This was my first time making cheesecake, and it turned out amazing! No cracks, no sinking in the middle, etc. The consistency is perfect after you refrigerate it overnight. I was paranoid that I would mess up somewhere along the way because this was my first cheesecake, but thanks to the pointers that other people gave in their reviews on here, I had no issues. 
I did change a few things, however, based on other reviews. I used a water bath, which I assume is the reason mine didn't crack. I also completely left out the flour and milk, and it turned out amazing. It's like restaurant quality, seriously. I'm not sure what the point of the milk and flour is, because this cheesecake is incredible without them, and no other recipes I looked at called for either of those things. 
For the crust, again per other reviews, I used 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (the kind in a can you can buy already crushed), 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/4 cup butter...turned out great, you can actually taste the flavor in it, unlike a lot of cheesecakes where the crust is pretty bland. I also changed the oven temperature to 325º and baked it for 1 hour and 25 minutes. 

PS: it's not necessary to cool it in the oven. I've always taken it out right away and cooled it on a wire rack and it's never cracked.

I have been making this cheesecake recipe for more than a couple of years - and am just now submitting my 2 cents.  :)  This is an easy recipe with an end result that is sure to impress anyone you serve this to.  It is a dense yet creamy cheesecake that is delicious without any topping. If using a topping with this cake I would suggest using something simple and as close to fresh as possible - as opposed to a canned pie filling.  This recipe has never failed me following the recipe as is.  Ensure you leave this in the fridge for at least 6+ hours after taking out of the oven to allow it to settle & give you the best texture.  Bake it an hour before bedtime and leave it in the oven until you get up in the morning, then refrigerate.  It's ready to serve for dinner dessert. Nice....

Amazing and very rich! I used a 10-inch spring form pan, and am glad I did; a 9-inch would have overflowed! I just added a few extra graham crackers and a little extra butter to make sure there would be enough crust for the larger pan, and baked an additional 20 minutes. Will definitely be making this again!

First time I ever made a cheesecake used this recipe and it came out perfect!! I did do my research on cheesecakes and I used a water bath also wrapped my pan in 4 layers of heavy duty foil to keep the water from seeping in. Got so many rave reviews this will always be my go to cheesecake recipe. Also used cinnamon and sugar graham crackers and yummmm :)

This was my first time making a cheesecake, and this recipe came out perfectly.  Based on others' reviews, I placed my baking dish in a larger pan and filled the large pan with hot water before baking.  I baked until the edges were just slightly brown and beginning to dull (the center was still shiny and wobbled when I hit the pan), and then I let the cheesecake cool for an hour before removing it to the counter for another half hour.  I didn't have any trouble with it falling or cracking.  

Make sure to bring the ingredients to room temperature before mixing.  One thing I would do differently is that I would combine the flour, sour cream, and vanilla before mixing into the other ingredients because I had trouble with the flour clumping but was concerned about overmixing.

It was my first time I tried to make a cheesecake since I love it so much and I thought it turned out great.there was no cracks and the texture was creamy and dense.i cooked it for 1hour with steaming water under the springform and didn't open the oven at all.left it in the oven for two hours to cool and then put it in the fridge.some of the family members didn't go crazy for it and some thought it was too eggy but I thought it was perfect.i also think it's hundred times better than the one I had in a really good bakery .thanks for sharing your recipe Chantal

This is the best New York style cheesecake recipe that I have ever tried! I follow the recipe and my cheesecakes come out perfect every time! If it is not working for you, check your ingredients & ensure that you are following the recipe to a T. Chances are it is you and not the recipe!

I used this recipe to make my first cheesecake ever.  There are so many recipes to choose from but I went with this one because of the great reviews.  I was not disappointed.  This recipe makes a nice and light cheesecake which is my preference for cheesecake.  This will be my go-to recipe for cheesecake from now on.

I had to bake my cheesecake for about 70 minutes.  I let it cool in the oven for only 30 minutes because I wanted to cool it down slowly but I didn't have the time to leave it in the oven for 5 hours because I needed my oven for other things.  I set the cheesecake on my counter and cooled it completely before putting it in the refrigerator.  I'm not sure leaving the cheesecake in the oven for such an extended period of time is necessary as my cheesecake never cracked.

You should alway bake cheesecake in a water bath .. Remove when baked letting it cool slightly in the water before removing the cheesecake  from the water bath ... This won't take 5-6 .. Who wants to wait that long for cheesecake?

Excellent base recipe for a novice to even tweak if they wanted to, easy to make, good flavor, so here is the deal I made this last night it came out flawless baked in a water bath at 350 for 1 hour and I know its not in the instructions but making ANY cheese cake a water bath is an option for the baker especially if your oven has hot spots or is just crappy in general also you want to bake with no convection or air that will dry any top, that being said I am only writing this review because I went over some negative ones and I cracked up , one said I followed everything to the T and I don't know what happened it came out burned and cracked..lol well I don't know maybe you burned it? just saying ..lol.. you can almost not mess up the prep so any mistakes will fall on baking temps and time or oven, the water bath helps minimize that, get a larger tray put the 9" in it and use something to add HOT water in the open space between the trays as it sits on the rack mid oven , this will help you not getting any water in your cheese cake, fill up to about 1" from the top of the 9" tray so you can lift it out from the water without getting your hands wet with hot water, Don't attempt to pull the whole thing out water in and cake that's how you get water in your cake or serve the floor the whole thing, the water tray will be easy to handle when the 9" tray is out. Good Luck!!

Made this cheesecake yesterday.  I must have done several things incorrecly because it turned out to be a flub.  First, I've never made graham cracker crust without sugar but I did as the recipe said.  I never greased the springform pan for a cheescake before but I did as the recipe instructed.  Followed instructions and put in oven @ 350 for 1 hour.  The cheesecake had risen well past the top of the pan. DID NOT open oven at all.  After 1 hr turned oven off and left it in for the 5 hours stated.  Turned oven light on several times to "peek" and saw the cake had "deflated".  At the end of 5 hours i took it out.  The entire center had sunk in and top had a burned look to it.  I just had to taste it as it really didn't look great.  Had more of a custard texture than a cheesecake texture.  I'm hoping that being refrigerated will help the texture, but nothing will help the appearance.  Taste was so-so. With all the rave reviews I'm assuming I must have done several things wrong. This was not my first cheesecake but it was the first one I had problems with.  Have a can of cherry pie filling that I hope will help with looks at least.

Great recipe! I love to bake but have never tried making a cheesecake before. I decided to make this recipe for a Valentine's Day family dinner. Everyone loved it....my brother-in-law's sister makes cheesecakes and other desserts for catered events and he said my cheesecake rivaled even her best cheesecakes. I followed the advice of other reviewers and made sure all of the ingredients were room temperature. I also baked the cake for about fifty minutes (with a water bath) and then turned off the oven and let it sit for about three hours. I also recommend sifting the flour because it was a pain to get all of the lumps out when mixing. Amazing recipe that I know I will make again soon!

This recipe is amazing!!! It tastes just like The Cheesecake's traditional New York Style Cheesecake.  I followed the recipe for the filling exactly but changed up the crust by adding a 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon and 6 tablespoons of butter instead of 2.

I have made this a number of times. Really great cheesecake! Only thing that I changed was to decrease all the cheesecake ingredients except for the vanilla by 1/4. Otherwise it always overflows even my 9" springform pan. I use the waterbath and turn it off after 1 hour and leave it in overnight then chill it. It is so good!

I absolutely L.O.V.E this recipe!!  I've baked this cheesecake multiple times and yes it has cracked a couple of times but who cares?? Put some cherries or blueberries or strawberries on top and the guests will never know!  I've been asked to bake this for parties and it is always a hit!  Just know that the more bubbles you see as you mix the ingredients, the higher the probability of cracking.  Mix lightly to avoid bubbles and cracking and you can present it plain. =)

I have baked this cake twice now, and both times it cracked...but as per other reviews , "thats what fruit puree is for". My family was split on the taste, Kids loved it but my husband needed more 'umpf'. So I added the juice of one lemon, and this did the trick for him!. For me this cake is divine as is, even with cracks. Thanks Chantal.

This was my first time ever making a cheesecake.  After reading the review I was tempted to change the recipe, but I decided to make it as is, and I am happy I did. I did however change the crust recipe by adding cinnamon and sugar to the graham cracker crumbs.  I don't own a spring form pan so I used a 9x9 glass dish. I also halved the recipe becasue I only had 2 packages of cream cheese.  I baked it in the oven on 325 with a dish full of water on the shelf below.  I only allowed it to cool in the oven for about 1 1/2 hours then put it in the fridge.  I was plesantly surprised at the flavor and texture.  I will definately be making this again!

Outtstanding creamy and really delicious by itself or with fruit and whipped cream. I used a premade graham cracker crust, smashed it up and used it in my springform pan, easy and quick.

This was an absolute hit. Everyone was raving about it - even days later! I made it exactly as directed, only to make it gluten-free, I substituted gluten-free cookies for the crust and used sweet rice flour in place of the all-purpose flour. I also used skim milk and it still turned out delicious. I did not use a water bath, and it still turned out perfect, so don't go through the trouble! A word of warning though, this cake rises like crazy! It was almost touching the top of my oven by the time I went to turn the oven off. Don't worry though, it sinks back down to normal as it cools. It comes out very thick and creamy. Don't look any further - this is it!!! Thanks for the great recipe, Taliesen!

I never leave reviews, but I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out to be the best cheesecake I have ever had. Better than restaurants. It did crack though, but I'm sure I over mixed it. Doesn't change the taste though!

This was definatley my biggest cheesecake success yet, it was still a little gooey in the centre after letting it sit in the closed oven for 5 hours, but that was probably because I didn't chill it before serving. This cheesecake is dense, creamy and rich for the most part, but gets more cakey near the top and sides, in a good way ! Such an awesome recipe

So this was my first attempt EVER at a cheesecake. It was INCREDIBLE! No cracks, no flops....just great tasting cheesecake.  

I followed the direct pretty darn close. I was really worried I would mess it up. Especially after reading all the comments about cracking. There was a lot of conflicting advice. Mixing: I used a hand mixer. At every step I mixed until just smooth. Baking: This recipe said nothing about a water bath. My Mom and the "Cheesecake basics" both mentioned this. This is my only deviation from the instructions, turns out I did it wrong anyway. I placed the cheesecake pan in a shallow water bath and used cold water. It is supposed to be deep and hot water. But I guess it didn't make a difference. 

I will say in the future, I may modify the crust as I found it a little plain. The cheesecake did brown a little on top, but not burned.

I am clearly in the minority here, since I was somewhat disappointed in this recipe. I used the exact ingredients, and find that it tastes and has the texture of mild egg custard, not cheesecake. Having said that, I agree with many of the positive reveiws. Easy to make; turned out perfect. Next time, I'll try using less egg, more cream cheese, or something in an attempt to get it to taste and feel like real cheesecake.

Thanks to the other reviewers, the cheesecake came out perfect after I left it sit for a couple of hours in the oven, no cracking at all. Everyone loved it! Did a few changes though, since we ran out of sour cream, I used yogurt instead. Not much of a difference,I guess.

After two rounds of making this, I finally got the recipe to work... however there should be a specified time to chill in the refrigerator.  That time being at least 12 hours.

I got up early and made the first batch yesterday morning.  Did the recipe as directed.  After it set in the oven for about 6 hours, the cheesecake had cracked.  So I went ahead and placed it in the refrigerator.  After about 3 1/2 - 4 hours of chilling in the refrigerator, I served it.  It was the most disgusting cheesecake I'd ever had.  It was fluffy.  :(

So, I put the left overs back in the fridge and started making a 2nd batch.  I baked it an hour but inserted it directly into the fridge after baking.  I checked on it after 5 hours and it seemed fluffy, so I waited until this morning. 

After a total of 12 hours in the refrigerator, this cheesecake is absolutely delicious!   And it didn't crack!

Now, regarding the first cheesecake... since I'd let the leftovers set over night, it seems to have set well too.  Not as good as the 2nd batch, but it isn't as fluffy anymore!  

So I say whether you keep it in the oven or not is your call.  Should you make this recipe, do it the day before, that way it will have the right amount of time to set while chilling in the fridge.

Thank you Taliesen for the great recipe!  :)

If you follow this recipe exactly, your cheesecake will be perfect! I have made this 5 times in the past few weeks and they have all been flawless. I used a water bath with all of them, and none cracked. I recommend leaving the cheesecake in the oven for the full 6 hours after cooking, then place it in the freezer for an hour or 2; it really helps when it's time to remove it from the pan. I have received so many compliments on how tasty the cake is, and I have never attempted a cheesecake before :)

Very good. I used this recipe for cupcakes. I'm new to cheesecake so I'm working on perfecting the proper cooking times. Regardless, even if it's overcooked, this cheesecake is pretty dang good.

Awesome!  My boyfriend requested a NY style, dense, creamy cheesecake for his 40th birthday and this recipe worked PERFECTLY!!! This is the first cheesecake I've ever made and I was soooo proud of how it turned out! I was careful not to overbeat, used cream instead of milk (I had some I wanted to use up), and put mine into an oven bag.  No leaking, worked perfectly.  I baked mine at 325 for about 1hour 20min. Left it in the oven, door closed, for about 3 hours. Then it went into the fridge overnight.   NO CRACKS!   I mean seriously....it came out perfectly. He has already eaten half of it. :)

Recipe turned out wonderful.  I used an oreo crust (1 1/4 cup crushed oreos and 1/4 cup of butter).  Followed other reccomendations of using 2 TBS of flour.  Also put cake in a water bath.  I wrapped my springform pan in a crock pot liner which unfortunately leaked- fyi.  I think next time I will wrap the pan in foil and put it in a liner before putting into bath.  Even though some water leaked in, the cake turned out wonderful(kept in fridge for 24 hours before serving which I think helped the crust dry out).  This was my first cheesecake- so glad it turned out good!

wonderful recipe, great advice on how to prepare but New York-style cheesecake relies upon heavy cream. Usually, cheesecake is made from cream cheese, eggs and egg yolks

I make this cheescake frequently and for the longest I always over mixed. To avoid this I have modified the recipe. I mix the sugar, cream cheese and flour with the mixer and add the milk, sour cream, and vanilla with a spoon and incorporate the eggs one at a time last. Also I am kinda lazy so I poor about a cup or 2 of water in the bottom of the oven in lieu of the watter bath because I don't have a pan large enough to do the water bath and only have one rack in my oven. I also add strawberry syrup and swirl it into the batter as you would a marble cake. This is kinda sweet so I modify by only using 1 cup of sugar for balance. Also I use vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers. De-lish!

The cheesecake comes out creamy, fluffy and light. If you use a 9 inch springform baking pan for this recipe, the cheesecake turns out really fancy looking, twice as thick and twice as yum. I didn’t have one handy, so I had to make two smaller ones (oreo and graham crackers).

The key to having it not crack is creating a water bath for your cheesecake. The steam from the water rises and keeps the bulk of your cheesecake from separating/cracking because of the moistness. Another key is to fold in the eggs. I used a mixer to mix all the ingredients first. Then, I folded in the four eggs. If you over beat the eggs, your mix becomes bubbly and will rise in your batter while baking and inevitably crack. But, if it turns out ugly—you put strawberries on and no one knows the difference!

First, I am wondering why people who have not made the recipe feel compelled to rate it.  How is one able to issue an opinion of something that has not been tried?  The ingredients are somewhat different from my usual cheesecake, and the result is a different cake.  This one is denser and much more "New York" than the other one.  This one is a keeper!!

I was kinda shocked when I saw this recipe as it's almost the exact recipe I came up with years ago for the "perfect" cheesecake. Only two slight variations in the crust, and a tiny bit more milk. So I can definitely say that this cheesecake is perfect. I have a following of devote cheesecake worshipers every time I take my cheesecake. So definitely try out this version. It's seriously only slightly different but as equally as tasty as my own I'm sure.

Had to add my vote to the many, many others. Everyone is right! This was my very first try at cheesecake. I did a lot of research before attempting, read all the reviews and found this one. It is so, so good. I cannot describe! I made this for my husband's birthday and he was blown away! He said he thought I was going to screw it up (thanks, Honey!) but he brags all the time now about how well I did. I give all the credit to this recipe. Try it!!

it was alright. i thought the taste would be really good, but it's just ok. maybe i'm use to cheesecake w/o flour &/or sour cream. i'm use to that creamy rich cheese flavor, which does not come out in this recipe. the last few cheesecakes i've eaten were from cheesecake factory, so maybe i just feel downgraded... if you've had cheesecake factory cheesecake, you KNOW what i'm talking about!! anyways, my cake did not have a crack at 1st, but after cooking on my oven and banging my spoon onto the pot hard a few time (forgetting the cake was still right under), i look & CRACK! oh well, it was covered up with strawberry sauce & strawberries & did not affect the flavor.

WoW! This was easy and really delicious.  I was short 1/2 cup of sour cream and used whole milk yogurt to make one cup and it still was totally awesome! I will definitely make again!

OMG! My husband and I LOVED this cheese cake! This was the very first cheese cake I've ever made and it could not have come out any better. I forgot to add the vanilla and it was still super yummy! We added a strawberry topping and it was to die for! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I have never had a cheesecake turn out this perfectly! I followed the suggested tips (tinfoil wrap, waterbath, greasing the pan and gently mixing the batter) and its level, smooth, uncracked and absolultey beautiful.

-February 2012  

I made this again and AGAIN it turned out perfect. This time I placed a piece of parchment paper on the bottom for easy release (and because I was leaving the cake behind and taking the pan with me when I left a party), if you use bakers tape to seal the parchment to the sides of the pan it helps prevent water from leaking in. Also, a triple layer of foil, taped up the sides is an added layer of protection. Make sure you grease the sides well with butter! This helps prevent cracking as the cake cools and the water bath is essential. I let the cake cool for about 5 minutes longer than this recipe calls for because last time the center was a little soft. It turned out perfect! Don't open the door once the hour/ 5-10 minute baking time is up! Let it cool completely and then store in the fridge. This was divine. Add spices to the crust to give it a little oopmf. I tossed in brown sugar and cinnamon. It was a total hit

So delicious + oh so creamy!  Everyone in my family loved this cheesecake recipe.  Extremely easy to make.  I did sub greek yogurt for the sour cream (didn't have sour cream on hand).  Turned out pretty perfect; this will definitely be our go-to cheesecake recipe.  The only thing I will change next time around is the amount of sugar--my husband thinks it's just right, but the rest of the family agrees that it could be less sweet and still be oh-so delicious!!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!

This was so easy and super delicious! Next time I make this, I plan on kicking up the crust a bit. I used more crackers than the recipe suggested, but the crust still felt a bit thin.

I plan on changing the order of the ingredients listed and rewording some of the instructions so I can act like I made this up myself and build my family recipe book on it. It's so good, I want to plagiarize.

Best recipe for cheesecake EVER! If followed correctly, you will end up with restaurant quality tasting cheesecake. Many that have tried it said it was better than Cheesecake Factory cheesecake! I followed a review and made the graham cracker crust with 1.5c graham crackers, 1/4 cup both sugar and butter and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, this crust is amazing! After three tries, I finally figured out how to avoid the dreaded crack - definitely use a water bath (i used a large roasting pan and filled it with hot water 1/3 way up the springform, and wrapped the springform with foil to avoid water seeping in) and bake it for a longer time at a lower temperature (i did about 1.5 hours at 330 degrees, but adjust time to avoid the browning of the top, i'd keep watch after an hour and ten minutes) - finally, a picture perfect cheesecake!

This was my first attempt at cheesecake making and I must say that I am very pleased with the results.  My cheesecake came out beautifully, with no cracks.  I baked it at 325 for 55 minutes then shut off the oven and let it sit for 4 hours before refrigerating.  I tried to mix all the ingredients by hand but found out that it was almost impossible to cream the sugar and cream cheese to a smooth consistancy, even with room temperature ingredients.  Next time I will use an electric mixer to cream the sugar and cream cheese and hand mix the remaining ingredients.  This recipe is a keeper for me!!

Made this exactly as written and it was outstanding.  My only issue i had is that it did crack, but who cares.  It did take some time to prepare but end result is this will be the only cheese cake I'll make from now on.

Awesome recipe. Made this for my wife for Mother's Day... She loved it! A couple of suggestions: even through there is only a 1/4 cup flour, it mixes well if you sift it into the bowl. Like another reviewer, used a baking bag around my pan and baked it in water. I backed it for an hour, left in in the oven to cool for five hours and then another couple of hours cooling in the fridge. It was perfect.

The first time I made this it was a big FAIL!! lol but that was mainly because I didn't use a water pan and I didn't mix it properly. The second time however...I folded the mixture adding a little at a time. Then put a water pan on the bottom rack of the oven, and followed the directions completely.
The results were heaven.
Everyone I make this for LOVES it!

This is THE perfect recipe for a traditional NY style cheesecake.  I follow the recipe exactly and place a baking dish with an inch or so of water on the rack below the cheesecake during baking.  You could easily add toppings/mix-ins of your choosing, but the cheesecake is perfect as it is.  Every time I make on, family/friends BEG me to bake another for whatever event they have coming up.  This dessert is sure to be the star of the show.

It was good but I may try another recipe for cheesecake as it didn't seem to be very sweet, almost dry.  Next time I will cook at 325 degrees as it was a little over-done at 350 for an hour.

The oven temp was a bit too high…my cheesecake had a 2" browned ring around the outside edges.  I should have lowered the temp for the 1 hour it baked.  Followed the directions exactly, making sure not to over beat, the texture was creamy and good.  I will try it again I'm sure, maybe adding a bit of lemon as well.  Thanks for the sweet Valentine treat recipe :)

This is the second time I made this cheesecake, I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was fantastic...this time I attempted to make it "low carb" by substituting Splenda for the sugar and omitting the flour ~ it basically exploded in the over which surprised me because I have adapted plenty of other recipes in the past and never had this experience.  Does anyone know why this would have happened? (I am rating this on how it came out the first time when I followed the recipe exactly, not on this attempt!),

Awesome!  Didn't get any cracks.  I did as others had said, greased  the bottom and sides with lots of butter.  The texture was just perfect...smooth, creamy and not too sweet!  Will be making again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I've made this cheesecake twice. The first time, I added the vanilla & flour at the end as the directions say & the vanilla stuck to the flour & it all clumped up in little balls. The texture of the cake was grainy. The second time, I added the vanilla to the milk then I added the flour last, but slowly and I made sure to sift it first. The texture was perfect!!! I also changed the crust to be 2 cups of Nilla wafers (measured before crushing) and 4 tbsp butter. It was SO delish! Everyone who tried it loved it and one person even asked me to make one for his mom. Amazing recipe, rivals Juniors!!!

Hubby made this for Christmas. Huge hit. Delicious! It did crack but serving the pieces already cut fixed that problem. Served with blueberry compote. Yummy!

Easy and awesome!  Used the water bath which made the consistency amazing - only part that could have been better was the crust.  Think next time I will pre-bake the crust before adding the filling.

I made this cheesecake a while back and it was seriously the best cheesecake I've ever had. I overmixed it, so it was pretty ugly, but it was still delicious. My mom couldn't eat much of it because it was too rich for her, so if you can't take rich food, you might want to reconsider this recipe or not eat too much of it. My one complaint is that the crust is kind of bland, so you should probably add some sugar to the graham crackers before mixing in the butter.

I am so excited!  This cheesecake turned out PERFECTLY.  I have NEVER been able to make a cheesecake without it cracking AND sinking -- this one was beautiful enough to sell, and it tasted superb!    I did read all of the tips, and they really helped.   I made the crust on the back of the graham cracker crumbs box, only because I didn't want to deal with crushing graham crackers.  This was very easy.  I pressed it into the springform pan and baked it for 10 minutes for 350.  I prepared the cheesecake.  I mixed the cream cheese and sugar, but was so afraid of over-mixing, that I may not have made it creamy enough, because when I added the milk, at which point I switched to hand-mixing, there were some lumps.  I couldn't get them out, and I wasn't sure which was worse -- some small lumps (would they even out during baking??), or overmixing.  Well, I took a risk, dumped the whole thing into my vitamix blender and set it on high for about 30 seconds.  I poured it back into my mixing bowl and it was smooth as can be.  I hand-mixed the rest.  To be cautious, I let the batter sit for about 10 minutes, and I raised the bowl and dropped it a few times to release any air bubbles.  I didn't notice any, so who knows if this helped?  I placed the springform pan into an oven bag (turkey bag), rolled down the sides of the bag, then placed the whole thing in a larger roasting pan, which I filled with 2 inches of water.  I baked it for one hour at 350, then turned the oven off and waited.

I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't work out too well.  It cracked and the taste was just ok.  My husband likes this so it is the only reason I ever make it.

This was my first cheesecake and I decided to change nothing at all (at least not anything that would make a significant outcome in the taste of the overall cheesecake recipe). Although the cheesecake wasn't AS light as I like my cheesecake, (just my personal preference) it was  delish! I just had my first slice and loved it. The only things I did differently from the recipe is that I used a pre-made graham cracker crust pie shell instead of a spring-form pan. If you are planning to do this like I did, then HALF the recipe. I'm glad I decided to do that (due to height difference) because even when I halved it to 6 servings and filled up the graham cracker pie crust, there was still some filling left over! Using the graham cracker shell I baked mine for 50 minutes to be safe not to overbake it and left it in the oven for about 4 hours before placing in the fridge and mine did not crack at all (although since I made the cake for myself I wouldn't give a rats behind if it did anyways as long as it tasted good!) But anyways next time I think I will just buy graham crackers instead so I will be able to make about 3-4 mini cheesecakes with the left over filling. Also I substituted 1/4th a teaspoon of the vanilla ext. for almond extract AND for a little variety I swirled 2 tablespoons of red raspberry preserves into half of the cake. The pie crust thing is genius for those on a budget and/or diet. Half of the ingredients used, about half the calories, same 1 slice of cheesecake.

I have made this cheesecake at least 50 times, every time comes out perfect, it is the best cheesecake you can eat including restaurants. Everyone who tasted always asked me to do again over and over. Follow the instructions and there shouldn't be any problem.  Make sure your ingredients are at room temperature. Definitely add the eggs one at a time otherwise your cheesecake won't be white. When done with mixing hit the bowl to the table a few times in order to get rid of the lumps. When ready to put into the oven, place the springform into another bigger pan full of water to avoid cracks. I genereally use sweetener instead of sugar and add one teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of sugar (sweetener) to the base, in order to sweeten the digestive biscuits I use. I use creme fraische instead and Philadelphia lights.

I haven't made a lot of cheesecakes in general, but this is by far the best recipe i have run across. The consistency is heavenly; creamy, thick, and the perfect balance of cream cheese and sugar. The graham cracker crust is what makes it for me in almost any cheesecake. I varied the crust a little bit by adding some striped chocolate shortbread cookies. I also made my crust thicker by doubling the amounts suggested in the recipe.  When i mixed up the cheesecake batter I ended up with an excess amount of batter which i used to make mini cheesecake cupcakes. They were perfect! I simply pulled out a cupcake pan, filled it with cupcake wrappers, put a layer of crust, then filled it 3/4 full with the batter. Baked it for 15 min or until they were firm, but still a little jiggly in the middle.  When making the cheesecake I aslo used a water bath as some others suggested. I would definitely reccomend this. It seemed to even out the baking of the cheesecake. Also, letting the cheesecake cool in the oven after baking allowed it to cool evenly and prevented any cracking. All in all, this was a PERFECT cheesecake! I will definitely use this recipe again!

I used more butter to get the crust to stick together a bit better.  I used a bit more crackers than they said and a larger pan.  Next time I will be more careful to add the flour separately from the vanilla and sour cream because some of the vanilla got with flour and made clumps - would be easier to make smooth that way.  as other reviewers said that to stop it from cracking, don't overbeat, grease the sides of the springform very thoroughly, put a dish with water in the oven with it, and leave it in the oven for a long time, then out on the counter for a long time, before putting in fridge, so the cooling is very slow.  - did all these things and it didn't crack at all, looked and tasted very nice :)

I saved this recipe a few years ago and decided to finally make it over the weekend for my husband's birthday. All I can say is this was the easiest, most delicious cheesecake I've ever made. My husband, who isn't very big on sweets, thought it was absolutely delicious. No cracking, just perfect!!!! I highly recommend this cheesecake recipe. If I could give it 10 stars I would!

This cheesecake came out close to perfection. For some, it just might be the perfect cheesecake since the texture was light, fluffy, and creamy. The taste however wasn't as rich as I would like it. The sour cream left a slight aftertaste. The cake took 1 1/2 hr to bake which the cheesecake article on this site said was correct. The cake came out crackless because I used a waterbath and really smooth with a nice slightly browned top. Crust was a little soggy but I didn't care too much for it. Instead of leaving the cake in the oven for 5 hours, I just turned off the heat after baking, left the oven door slightly ajarred, and let the cake rest for half an hour. This allowed enough time for the cheesecake to adjust to room temperature without cracking. After the half hour in the oven, cool the cheesecake completely to room temperature, about 2 hours, and then chill overnight.

Update* After a few days the cheesecake's vanilla taste was more apparent and the sour cream aftertaste disappeared. It's possible that the flavors in the cake was more evenly distributed after being left in the fridge for a few days. I personally liked the results.

I made this cheesecake as a dessert side for a fondue dinner party, and it was a big hit.  It was my very first cheesecake, so I was extremely nervous about my abilities to properly make one, but everyone raved about it and ate their full slices (even after completely gorging ourselves on meat fondue.)  I did wind up with one small crack, though that was no fault of the recipe, but a fault of my own.  Since I was completely new to making cheesecake, I didn't let the cream cheese soften enough, and therefore had to overbeat the batter in order to get rid of the lumps.  I'd therefore advise any one making this recipe to spend the time to allow the cream cheese to reach room temperature.  Even despite my overbeating, however, I still only had one tiny crack, which was a better result than I expected.  I added a small basin of water in a pyrex dish underneath the cheesecake to also help eliminate cracking.  In the future, I'd maybe eliminate the four from the recipe, in order to make the cheesecake a bit creamier.  Oh, FYI, my boyfriend made a wonderful strawberry topping by mixing strawberries with 1/3 cup sugar in a saucepan and whisking it.  Perfect!

This  tasted NOTHING like a New York cheesecake. All I could taste was eggs, and the texture was nothing even close to smooth and rich. Most of these 5-star ratings made changes to the original recipe or changed the way the ingredients are mixed/handled...

This is the best cheesecake recipe yet!  I followed the recipe exactly.  However, I used the waterbath method and turned off the oven after one hour and left the cheesecake in the oven for only 3 hours.  Placed it in the fridge overnite and in the morning took it out of the pan and topped it with blueberries.  Everyone loved it and said that it was the best that they have ever tasted.  The only recipe that I will ever use. Thanks Chantal.

acceptable new york style cheesecake recipe in a "smaller" size.  did everything exactly as said, yet cheesecake still cracks.  i am completely positive i did nothing wrong, but it all tastes the same to me, so no harm done!  this recipe did not leave me jumping up & down with excitement, felt it could have been "creamier".

With all the glorious reviews, I was expecting something much more incredible. I really wasn't impressed with this cheesecake...I don't know why, but it came out with a sort of light, fluffy texture that I didn't care for. On the other hand, my brother, who doesn't care for cheesecake, really loved this one. I also had a problem with the recipe...the 15 graham crackers made no sense. I crushed up 15 whole sheets, and it was way too much...I think it means 15 half sheets. And there isn't enough butter either...2 tbs. isn't enough to hold it together. I did make one change to the recipe...I used one package of Neufchatel cheese (1/3 less fat, but tastes/works the same) instead of one of the packages of full fat cream cheese. I do this all the time with other cheesecakes, and it has never affected them. Also, I was in a hurry and had to bake a cake after the cheesecake, so I had to move the baked cheesecake to the top oven (I have a double oven) to cool for 6 hours. The cheesecake cracked, of course, which is what I expected to happen. But what else could I do? Thanks for sharing the recipe, but I won't be making this again. Unless my brother requests it, of course :)

This was an excellent cheesecake. I've made it twice, taking the advice about not over beating the mixture. I still got a crack in mine but it tasted amazing! If you're looking for a great cheesecake, this is it.

Loved it! Made it for a retirement party here at the office and everyone was just raving about it! I've made plenty of cheesecakes before, but never a "New York" style cheesecake, per se. I cut the recipe down by a fourth and did everything pretty much as it says and it turned out perfectly! Used low fat cream cheese, and a 50/50 mix of sugar and splenda and the cake was still rich and delicious! Do yourself a favor and follow  the directions =)

Absolutely amazing! This is my first and only recipe (for a cheesecake). This cheesecake had NEVER cracked ))) But I do butter up the sides of the pan! Very important, I do believe that is the reason why mine never cracks!

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving this year. I follow the recipe to a T and I did bake in a water bath. My ingredients were at room temp when I started. I wrapped the springform pan w/ two layers of heavy duty foil and set it down in my roasting pan and added water 1/2 way up the pan. I had to bake a little longer than the the hour the recipe indicated because after one hour the cheesecake was a little bit wobbly in the center. I baked for abour 10-15 minutes longer and turned the oven off and let it cool overnight in the oven. I then wrapped in celophane and put it in the refrigerator in the morning. It was delicious. I let guests choose a homemade strawberry topping I made from this site or a caramel topping that I purchased from the store w/ toasted pecans. Either of toppings went well with this. I will definitely make this again.

This is a really awsome recipe! I did have to solve a few common problems with cheesecake baking . I had all of the usual problems like cracking and and lumpy cheesecakes so here is how i made a PERFECT cheese cake. I started with preheating the oven AND the waterbath. For a waterbath i just used a turkey roaster half fill with water on the center shelf of the oven. Despite having a really nice springform pan mine is not watertight so i used a turkey roasting bag. I just placed the pan in the bottom of the turkey bag and tied 100%cotton twine around the lip of the pan to hold the bag in place and keep it from sliping. I just sniped off the extra bag about 1 1/2 inches above the lip of the pan.I brought all of my ingredients to room temp.I put cream chese in the microwave for about 15 sec a block and put the eggs in a bowl of warm water for a few min till they were room temp.I also only used a mixer to mix the creamcheese and sugar after that i used a wisk and mixed everything else by hand so that i didnt incorporate air in the mixing(that is really importaint!)I baked as directed and then without opening the door i just turned off the oven and let it cool about 5 hours. I removed the cake from the oven and cut the twine to remove the bag. I placed the cake in the fridge over night and it came out like a professional cheesecake.I also used a thin fishing line to cut the slices so it came out perfect like you see at a fancy restruant!!! It was so nice i have made dozens of them

I followed this recipe exactly. When I mean exactly I mean I followed this recipe to a T. The recipe was very vague in describing both the ingredients and the direction for making this cheesecake. 15 graham crackers??? (does that mean one whole graham cracker with 4 sections counted as one or does that mean the one graham cracker with 4 sections counted as 4 graham crackers.) Also they should emphasis how we should mix all the ingredients. Whether in an electric mixer or by hand. Also when I poured my mixture on to the crust, some of the graham cracker pieces ended up floating to the top of the mixture which ended up to be a huge disaster, but I still kept going. After about 50 minutes, I ended up turning off the oven because the cheesecake was almost burnt. I went to go check up on it after 2 hours and I end up seeing so many cracks and the crust caved in.I hate to rate this recipe so low, but I had huge expectations for this recipe because of such great ratings, but I was not satisfied at all. Word of advice, if this is your first time making cheesecake I would try finding a different recipe that provides more information than this recipe.

I used 15 squares of crackers not being sure if the recipe meant squares or rectangles. It seemed to work just fine. Great taste but I was wanting a smoother texture and more dense cake. Maybe it was the way I mixed it.

I don't need to say it again, but I will!!  It's perfect.  I had never made cheesecake before, so this was my first and it came out perfect and it does every time.  I followed some of the tips in the reviews and didn't have any problems.  I didn't have a spring form pan, so I just split it into 2 pie pans with graham cracker crusts and obviously didn't cook it as long.  It turned out perfect and does every time!!

easy to follow. I made 2 (as directed, without a baine marie, just to try it) and both cracked. So, as long as you're ok with that, then do it as directed. If you want to be sure, go ahead and try that--but I wasn't interested in the extra work.

Awesome cheesecake recipes.  It was my first time making one and I followed the ratings of others.  If followed the recipe to the T, but only cooled it in the fridge for about 3 hours.  It was not totally settled in the middle, but the taste was incredible.    I've made an adjustment to the water bath method that I found at another website...  You can use a Reynolds Oven Bag (used for baking turkeys) instead of foil and a 'oven proof' rubber band (Architec SCBMP 2-Inch Stretch Cooking Band, Multicolor, 25-Package) found at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I rolled the bag up enough to just cover the springfoam pan and put the rubberband around the bag and place it in the pan of water.  No leakage and the bag and rubberband is reusable.  I will certainly make this again.  Thanks Chantal!

Good base recipe, I changed it to my personal liking. Always add a tbsp of lemon juice. I use only 3 eggs and 3 packages of cream cheese. The flour isn't necessary. Also I use heavy cream in place of milk, adds a nice richness and creaminess to the cake.

I have never made cheesecake before until this recipe came along. It didn't crack! The only problem I had was I found the crust wasnt very solid.  Also, the top came out a little brown. I used a water bath and did not overmix the batter. 1/30/11 update: I have made this cheesecake over half a dozen times now and it never fails to impress. However, I have given up on the crust. This last time I made it I used an Oreo cookie crust: 2.5 cups of finely crushed Oreo cookies (centers removed), 1/3 cup white sugar, 5 tbsp melted butter, 1/8 tsp salt.  Mixed well and pressed into springform pan making sure to cover about 1-2 inches along the sides as well. I baked it at 325 instead of 350 and it was just perfect. Everybody ooh'd and ah'd telling me I had taken this cheesecake to a whole new level!

Thank You!  I would be considered a "beginner" in the cheesecake world, and this turned out wonderfully for me!  Creamy, no cracks, not dry.  I used a waterbath, and baked it for 60 minutes and shut the oven off, didn't even check it, and it was perfect.  The only thing that happened (which was my fault, so don't do this!) was I let it sit in the oven for 3 hours, not 4-6, and I put it in the refrigerator, uncovered right then.  I think it was still too warm, and it caused condensation to form inside the mold and made the crust soggy.  So make sure to wait until it is COMPLETELY cool before refrigerating.  Then wait 12-24 hours to cut it.  I know it's hard to have that much patience, but it's worth it!  Thank you so much for all the helpful hints everyone!

This recipe is perfect! I had faith in the recipe and shut the oven off after 1 hour and let the cake sit. I didn't jiggle or move it. Hours later I peeked and it was beautiful! This is my first cheescake that has turned out so delightful.   Next time I will add a bit of lemon though, my boyfriend is from New York and noticed the deficit immediately. He told me it was beautiful and delicious, but it couldn't be perfect without lemon.

This cheescake turned out to be a huge hit, everyone loved it. When I made the cheesecake I did cheat a little bit. I used a pre-made ready graham cracker crust, and thus had to change the serving size to 8. I also added some carmel topping into the cream cheese mixture, making it yummy! I also only baked it for 45 minutes and followed the other reviews doing the water bath and shutting oven off so it didn't crack. When I was ready to serve it I put a little carmel topping making it even better! I will be making this again!

Coupled with the cheesecake tips article here on allrecipes, I think this is the only cheesecake recipe I'll EVER be using! It was the first thing I ever made for my inlaws and since then I've been known as the cheesecake queen! Can't thank you enough Taliesen!

This is honestly the best cheesecake I ever made. It's not too rich, but so creamy and delicious. I topped it with chocolate and caramel. You could really make this cheesecake into any kind.. it's so perfect. I just halved the flour to make it less cakey. But this cheesecake.. is honestly the best new york style cheesecake out there.

This is awesome.  The first time I made it, it didn't crack and was absolutely perfect.  The second time it cracked even though I did the exact same thing so who knows why.  It didn't matter it was still delicious.  On the cracked one, I made an icing of sour cream and powdered sugar. Hid the crack and gave a nice finish to the cake.

This is an excellent recipe. The hints to avoid to avoid cracking, which is a problem I've had in the past, were exceptionally helpful. Wanting to remove as much air as I could I used a strong wooden spoon to hand mix the room-temperature ingredients in a large heavy ceramic bowl. (It required patience and determination, with occasional rest periods.)  After blending it all, I bounced the bowl on a thick cutting board and watched numerous bubbles pop as they rose to the surface. Following the rest of the instructions produced a professionally looking cheesecake.  I had extra batter left over because I'd proportionally upped the ingredients, which I’d planned to use to make enough for fifteen servings, instead of the 12 noted in the recipe. As it turned out, my springform pan wouldn't hold it. So I poured the rest in a paper lined cupcake tin. Being smaller they cooked much faster. When they browned on top I knew I had to pull them out even knowing they would collapse. I figured they'd make OK failures for me to eat as snacks. Sure enough, they did collapse but, being fresh fruit season, I realized that those depressions would make great places to stuff some crushed or halved fruit. Using strawberries for some and mashed papaya for the others, they made super bite sized finger desserts.  All goes to show that good things can even come from an ill-designed experiment by a novice baker!

We love this cheesecake.We did let everything get to room temp before we began combining the ingredients. We also added some more butter to the crust so it would press nicely. We also used a water bath on the rack below the cake. We sprayed the inside of the pan with cooking spray. It came out great! We baked it at night and left it in the oven over night after baking it for one hour (we did not touch the oven door)! We are very pleased with this cheesecake. We will make it again.

I tried to incorporate all the reviews (ingredients were room temperature, used heavy cream, a little more crust, greased the springform pan, baked for an hour then let sit till morning. . .).  It was cracked to the point it did not look appetizing but tasted okay - not super great but okay.

Great consistency.  Mine cracked up, but I swirled in two bars of melted semi-sweet chocolate, so maybe that's why.  I tried the water bath beneath the cheesecake (my cheesecake pan drips). Having said all this, the cheesecake lacked something for me.  I enjoy that tart taste (lemon juice?) in a cheesecake and this didn't have it.  A great recipe though.

I don't like overly sweet cheesecakes but next time I'll add a little more sugar to this one and might cut down a little bit on the sour cream...the top of the cheesecake got a little bit too browned - I'm wondering if other people cover the cake with al-foil while baking?  I also added chocolate chips to the batter but they sunk straight to the bottom - if I try that again I'll use mini-chips...

Awesome! So simple for a neophyte like me. First time attempting a large cheesecake! I did use the water bath when I baked it and it didn't crack at all. The sweetness was just right. Next time may add a couple of TBSPs of lemon juice as I had used yogurt i/o sourcream. Can't get sourcream where I live. The only problems I had were how to transfer the whole cake from the springform pan onto another plate for serving and despite lining lining the springform with two layers of aluminium foil as suggested by other reviewers water still seeped into my pan.

OMG! I'm 15 and i like to cook. I tried this recipe aqa couple times brfore and the cake cracked and it browned on the edges. That was because my dad was being too cheap to buy a springform pan. We used ghram cracker pie crusts- eww! this time i got my mom to buy a springform pan and it came out perfectly.  Helpful tips: Make sure the cream cheese and sugar is completly mixed. Not grainy., It does not matter how long you cream these two. Add the other stuff and mix that with a spoon. When adding the eggs, do not use electric beater, the eggs hold air which is bad for cheesecake. And lastly, after everything is mixed i add a tablespoon of lemon juice to make it a little tangy! This recipe is great and i will make this again!!!

apparently I am the only one who thinks this makes far too much filling for a 9" springform pan.  My cheesecake ended up 6" above the pan.   It's a muffin.

The cheesecake this recipe produces is simply amazing. It is creamy, rich and flavorful. My husband who normally turns his nose up to this dessert raved about how delicious this cheesecake is. The recipe is so easy to follow.  I gave my sister and her husband some of the cheesecake (in an attempt to get it out of the house; I would eat all of it! It is just that good!) and he claimed it is "the cheesecake that will change your life."  The first two I made didn't crack, but every one after those have been getting large "Y" cracks in the center.  I greased the sides, put a pan of water underneath the cake, and added a teaspoon of cornstarch.  I'm guessing that maybe I over mixed the batter.

I used this recipe last weekend to make my first ever real cheesecake.  It turned out fabulous- very dense, creamy and smooth texture.  I was nervous about over mixing as I used my stand mixer- but it turned out perfectly.  Tips I used-  1.  reduced flour to 2 tbs and mixed it with the sugar before adding to the cream cheese mixture (to avoid clumps) 2.  Put pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake when cooking (modified water bath) 3.  Baked for one hour as instructed and cooled in over for 5 more- didn't open the door at all!    Result- no crackes, perfectly cooked cheesecake.  I am trying a lemon version today- addint 2 tbs lemon juice and 1.5tbs grated lemon peal.  Using Kraft animal crackers for crust and blind baking crust first so it is crispier.

This cheesecake is to die for!  As I was mixing my ingredients, I realized I made a huge mistake.  I did not know it was a baked cheesecake and I wasn't planning on using a 9" pan.  I freaked out about the oven temp and the amount of time to bake the cheesecakes. However, it turned out far better than EXCELLENT!  I cut the ingredients into halves. and I made 18 cupcake cheesecakes!!  I used 2 pkgs LIGHT philly cream cheese and used more butter than it called for the crust. I turned the oven down to 320 F and baked it for 25-30 MINUTES.  I also added the WATER BATH  and lightly greased the sides of the muffin cups and my cheesecakes did not crack at all.  Greasing is important because bits of cheesecake will stick to the side when you peel the paper muffin cups off. Also, I didn't wait to cool it down in the oven for an hour and however many hours out of the oven because I really wanted to eat it so I took it out and straight into the fridge.   To finish, I used "Supreme Strawberry Topping" from Allrecipes to top it off.  It was SOOOOOO good.  I will be making this again and again and again. Thank you for this WONDERFUL recipe.

The description on how the cheesecake should be blended is unexplainable and therefore guarantees failure. I am very disappointed. Description is key when putting together recipes for the first time and this did not do so.   I did not care for this recipe.

Perfect cheesecake.  I used the water bath, room temp ingredients, and I did not even open the oven door for 6 hours.  This was the first cheesecake I ever made and it was amazingly perfect.

Absolutely perfect! Followed what other reviewers posted (beat sugar and cheese and proceed by hand, water bath, grease sides of pan, add cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg to the crust and let it sit in the oven for 5hrs before transferring it to the fridge. I made a hommade raspberry coulis because I had them on hand and didn't want them to go to waste!  Drop-dead delicous!!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe I'm an ex pat and wouldn't be able to buy this here even if my life depended on it!!

USE THE WATER BATH!  I had never made a cheesecake before so I made this one based on the high rating.  Made the first one following the recipe to the letter, not using a water bath.  Amazing taste, but it had a huge crack, and the edge was browned all around.  Rave reviews from those that tried some!  Made a second today, modified the crust a bit, using a few more crackers, 5 TBSP butter, some cinnamon, and a hint of ginger.  I used the water bath method, and this one looks beautiful!  Can't wait to try it out tomorrow!  Next, I'm going to be looking for some toppings to make, and maybe some things to swirl into the next one I make...

OMG DELICIOUS!  I had to make this recipe twice.  The first time I followed directions as is.  "HUGE" crack in the cake! Next day I used the waterbath and lessened the flour.  WOW, Perfect!! This is an awesome cheesecake.  I wanted it to look as good as it taste.  I brought it to a birthday party and everyone went ga ga. 2nd time I was short on time...left it in the oven for 2 hrs and refridgerated it.  A must try, WITH THE WATERBATH!

This is an awesome recipe.  I baked it 3 times during the holiday season.  From my experience baking Cheesecakes here are the most needed tips for a perfect cheesecake.
1.  Place the springform pan in a water bath while baking to prevent cracking.
2.  After placing the cheesecake mixture in the pan, before baking, let it sit on the kitchen counter for 15 minutes.  Any air bubbles caused by overmixing will rise to the top of the mixture.  Prick them with a fork to remove them.
3.  DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN WHILE BAKING.  Put the cheesecake in the oven and don't even think of opening the oven door for several more hours.
Bake and cool as directed and the cheesecake will be ready to devour in about 24 hours!

My husband loves cheesecake and begged me to make him one for his birthday. I was a little hesitant, because I had never made one before and I knew how difficult it was to make the "perfect" cheesecake.  The night before his birthday, we went to Ruth's Chris for dinner and of course, he ordered cheesecake for dessert.  It was by far the best cheesecake we had ever had.  The next night he ate my cheesecake and said mine was even better than the cheesecake from Ruth's!  Seriously, best cheesecake ever.

Wow!  The taste of this cake is unreal!  In all fairness mine cracked.  I did use a water bath but I didn't properly grease the sides of the springform pan.  I think to get a crack-free cake takes practice, because it totally depends on what oven you're using and room temperature.  That said I followed the recipe exactly and got a massive 10' cake!!!  Everybody said it was the best cake ever.  It's thick, dense and the taste is the perfect combination of creamy semi-sweet cheese.  One sliver will fill you up if you're hungry, because it's that dense (at least it did for me).  I will be definitely experimenting with this recipe in the future to get crack-free cake, but in the mean time slapping some topping on works great!!!!  I wish I could rate it more then 5 stars.

Follow the directions and you will be pleased. I had to adjust the time/temp slightly to keep mine from browning to much. This is a perfect cheesecake recipe.

This is on the short list of best cheesecakes I've ever eaten!  I've made this several times now and we have loved it every time!  I double wrap the sides with aluminum foil and also use a water bath and leave it in the oven to cool a minimum of three hours without opening the oven door.  Never had a crack yet!

This is the very best cheesecake I have ever made or tasted!!  Fail proof, goof proof, novice proof!!!  Main points to remember for cheesecake perfection:  Never overbeat--always beat on slow speed, ingredients at room temperature,grease the sides of the springform pan, bake at 325 degrees for one hour, then leave it in there, just like the recipe says--Perfect every time!!!

I thought this cheesecake was really delicious, and had the perfect texture. Even though I did not overmix, and left in the oven until completely cooled, it still cracked a bit, but that's easily covered with blueberry sauce. Unfortunately, I had to give it four stars, because even though everyone thought it was good, they all said that the other cake that I usually make is way better. This one had a little bit of sourness to it due to the sour cream. The recipe I use, which is from "Tyler's ultimate", doesn't contain sour cream, and the eggs are separated and whipped separately...etc, different processs, but worth the work! Thanks for this recipe though, really good and nothing wrong with it, just not the best I've made according to everyone who tried it(about 10 people).

100% the best! I made this as a surprise wedding cake for my cheesecake-loving brother and sister in law. They raved more about this cheesecake than any other desert I have ever seen them eat. This turned out PERFECT, not a single crack, no bubbles, it cut, came out and held together perfectly. I made a couple slight changes based on other reviews. I baked the crust for about 15 min. and also added some sugar and increased the butter to 1/2 cup, which made a perfect crust. Also reduced the flour to 2 heaping Tblsp. I baked at 325 for 50 minutes, then reduced to 250 for another 20-30 min, cooled in the oven for over an hour, removed to cooling rack, covered for bit, then uncovered, then finally to the fridge about 2 hours after it was done baking. This made a perfect cheesecake- no browning on top, perfectly set, no cracks, and did not fall apart once cut and served.

This wasn't the first cheesecake I made, but what a perfect cheesecake! My family doesn't like to eat things that are too sweet, so I halved the sugar and it's still sweet. It's best if you use the cream cheese when it's at room temperature to prevent over-beating and creating air bubbles in the batter. I bake this in a 9 inch springfoam pan with a water bath to evenly distribute the heat, let it cool with the oven closed, and it has no ugly cracks on the top of the cheesecake. The center will be a little jiggly when you take it out, but that's normal. The worst thing about this recipe is the WAIT - like every cheesecake, it has to firm up, which is torture when it looks so good. Let it set in the fridge overnight and it will be dense, rich and delicious!

I know this Cheesecake does not need another review but I just HAD to get on here and say how awesome it was! It took me a long time to get up the courage to attempt it. Cheesecake is one of my very favorites and I have made them in the past. Usually they turn out tasting great but not looking so good. (a crack here and a crack there) This one came out PERFECT!!! This was the first time I baked a cheescake in a water bath!! I baked it for an hour then left it completely alone for 6 hours in the oven! WOW!!! Thanks so much for the recipe! I have a feeling people are going to be asking me to make this quite often! lol

My Brother-in-law and i made this recipe for the first time last week. This was our first attempt on a cheesecake ever. We used an electric oven so our spring form pan was a 22cm and the there was more batter, we had to extend the cook time for another 10-15mins for the center to cook. Unfortunately enough the 6hour cool down in the oven is a must. After the cheesecaked cooled we ran a knife around the edges and covered it with glad wrapped (its easier to store that way) then placed it in the ref for 2 hours to cool before we served it.

This is the first Cheesecake I have ever made and it's the best I have ever tasted. Used a water bath, reduced flour to 2 TBSP, and added 1/4 cup pecans + 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the crust. No cracks and No sinking. The Absolute Best!**I tried this again the other day and used the full 1/4 cup of flour and it was much too cakey for me. I will stick with the 2 TBSP flour.

This is a fantastic recipe! I have made it twice now for special occasions and everyone loves it! Plus it impresses even the experienced cooks in the family that you can make a homemade cheesecake. This is an easy recipe and turns out so delicious! For the crust, I use 1 1/2 cups crushed graham crackers, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon & 1/4 cup sugar. The cinnamon just adds a little extra flavor that I like. Make sure your ingredients are at room temperature. I use a hand mixer for the cream cheese and sugar, but then switch to a wooden spoon for the rest of the mixing. After baking for 1 hour, I run a greased knife around the edges of the pan so it won't stick, turn off the oven and leave it in the oven overnight to cool. Then just keep in the fridge until ready to serve. We love this one. Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious!!  This was my first attempt baking a cheesecake.  It turned out beautifully.  I baked it for 1 hour and 15 mins, at 325 degrees, in a waterbath, turned off oven, let it remain in the oven for 5 hours, transferred to refrigerator and it turned out perfect.

Thank you for sharing.

I made this recipe twice: once as is and another with the suggestions made by others (325F oven, water bath, KIMAR's crust).  Both were loved, the taste of the filling was the same, but the crust was way better the second time around (thanks KIMAR!).  Plus, the coloring of the cheesecake was better (even and ivory) with the water bath and 325 oven; as opposed to a blah brown on the outside and ivory center.  Neither of the two cracked though.

This was my first attempt at cheesecake -was way easier than I expected.  I didn't do a water bath as I wanted to give the original recipe a chance - although I did use a different graham cracker crumb crust (with the cinnamon and sugar) as recommended in the most helpful tips.  I sprayed the sides with butter flavored Pam - I did get a few cracks but it didn't sink.  My sides were not stuck to the pan so I don't think running the knife around would have prevented the crack.  I know I didn't overbeat either.  I'm pretty sure if I would have done the water bath I wouldn't have had the cracks.  As for taste, I am so not a cheesecake person and even I enjoyed it (topped with cherry pie filling).  I used all light ingredients and you never would have known.  Will definitely use this recipe again when I need a cheescake. (BTW - I almost chickened out and bought one instead...they were a quarter the size that this one was - for the ease of making this recipe, it would not have been worth it to purchase a store bought one!)  Update:  This is even better the next day.  I for sure would make this a day ahead - especially since you have to let it sit in the oven so long, it takes a long time to cool off and even more time to chill in the fridge.  If you're using cherry pie filling as a topping, one can isn't quite enough as the the cheesecake is thick.  I'm still getting rave reviews the next day.  An impressive recipe (that I would keep as your little secret! ;)

PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT! After reading other reviews, this is what I did. All ingredients were at room temp. I used 1 1/2 cups of cinnamon graham crackers with 1/4 butter for the crust. Greased the pan all the way up sides. I decreased the flour to 2 tbsp, and used a hot water bath. Baked for 1 hour at 325* then let it sit in the oven for 5 hours. Then moved to the fridge. Not one crack, and no browning. I am at high altitude and it turned out beautiful! My other recipe... gone to the trash!

This is by far the best cheesecake I've tried from this site. It was perfect, smooth, no cracks,..... mmmmmmm, delicious!! As others said, place the pan in a water bath, and do not open the oven during the process, this way you avoid all those annoying cracks. Also don't overcook it, 60 min is just right, and leave the cake in the oven. I think it's not a problem if your ingredients are not at room temperature (at least it wasn't for me: the cheese, sour cream, eggs, milk...were very cold), and overbeating the batter only causes little air bubbles, not cracks! As a result of overbeating the batter, my cheesecake ended up with little tiny insignificant bubbles I could barely see.
Thanx for this recipe, it's a keeper!

I have been craving some good New York style cheesecake since moving to the west coast 3 years ago. This was perfect. I used a water bath and only mixed until smooth. I'm at high altitude and I made the recipe to a T and did not have any problems. Perfect texture, great flavor. Everyone who tried it, loved it!

I must say this is the best cheesecake recipe ever!  I used this recipe to make a cheesecake for a church potluck and it came out better than I had imagined. I already have requests to make this for several upcoming events!  I topped mine with cherries and piped it with a wonderful light whipped topping.  It really looked and tasted like it was purchased from a top quality bakery.

When ever I decide to make a recipe from this website I always read reviews first. Reviews add helpful tips. So, the night before I made this cheesecake I read alot of the reviews. I got up in the morning and pulled everything I needed out of the fridge so that it would all be at room temp. I went about my morning cleaning and then came back to make the cheesecake. Excited by all of the reviews I really wanted to like this cheesecake. These are the problems I had 1.) Not enough butter for the graham crackers, had to add alot more. 2.)Way to much batter. I had to reread the recipe to make sure it called for a 9in. pan and not a 10in. pan. I filled mine to the top and still had about a 1/4 or more of the batter left in my mixing bowl. 3.) Started cooking wonderfully, then about 40 minutes into cooking it rised about 2in. over the pan and began to crack everywhere. Then the sides all fell off onto the bottom of my oven. Maybe this is my fault for not using a water bath?
After cooking 1 hour I turned the oven off and left it in the oven for 2 hours. There is something about leaving a milk based product in the oven for 5-6 hours that doesn't sit right with me. I then placed it in the fridge for 3 hours. After dinner my cheesecake loving husband couldn't wait to try this cheesecake. The whole thing was mushy, it did not have the texture of a cheesecake. It was no where near done, but yet very brown all over. After trashing this cheesecake I came to the conclusion that this is more

I can assure you, this recipe will yield a tasty result. I followed the recipe to a "T" -- alright, I've already lied! I used "Half and half" rather than milk. For the crust, I used 1 to 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, combined with 4 tablespoons of melted butter and 1/4 cup sugar. It made a lot of crust, so I threw some away... then I realized I had too little of a crust! Anyway, I didn't, but I would suggest baking the crust for about 5 or 10 minutes first. As for the cheesecake, I beat it by hand with a wooden spoon after the initial cream cheese/sugar beating. This was rather exhausting and my texture still ended up rather funny (Maybe it's the flour?), but it is definitely acceptable. This made A LOT of filling for my 9" Springform Pan... it was nearly overflowing, definitely maximized space. I don't have a deep baking dish, so I place a casserole dish full of boiling water into the oven for my "mock" waterbath, I baked it at 325 (Lower temp than what it calls for) for 1 hour, then shut the oven off and left it in there for about 4 hours before putting it in the fridge. It did not crack at all, and the top only had the slightest lightest brown color-- quite pretty. Eat it plain, or with some cherry topping to mix it up! I think the tangy flavor would go well with some citrus-- I'm going to try combining lemons and/or limes with it next time.

Excellent flavor and texture!!  Wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this or a bakery bought cheesecake.  I halved the cream cheese mixture, just because I didn't have enough cream cheese for the full recipe.  Still delicious, just a shorter cake.  I also used(room temp.): 1/3 less fat cream cheese, fat free sour cream, 1% milk, the cinnamon crust recipe(per another review).  I only used my mixer for the cream cheese and sugar and then used a wooden spoon to mix the rest of the ingredients. I baked at 325 for an hour with a pan of water on the rack underneath.  Took sharp knife around edge of cheesecake after the hour (I had sprayed my pan with cooking spray), then left in closed oven for about 2 1/2 hours, then refrigerated. After the hour, there were a few very small cracks along the edge of the cake, but after leaving it in the oven the 2 1/2 hours, they had disappeared.  I had sprinkled some chocolate chips over the top of half of the cheesecake and there were a few small cracks by the chips, but not bad.  I will definitely make again and my husband(the real cheesecake lover) wants me to try the full recipe for the taller cake.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was, by far, the worst cheesecake recipe that I have ever used.  Since the recipe had such a high rating I decided to make it for a church function without testing it out first.  The cheesecake looked very good; however, it had a very gritty taste and did not have a good flavor.  After tasting this recipe I was very embarrassed that I had served it.

Very good cheesecake and very simple. I cut the recipe in half and made it in a premade graham cracker crusts from the grocery store. I don't have a springform pan so I had to improvise. It turned out excellent. I did not do the water bath as some suggested. I just put it in the oven at 350 for 40 mins then turned the oven off and left it for 2 hours. Then I stuck it in the fridge overnight and I didn't get any cracks. We had some for breakfast this morning with our coffee and it was delicious!

This cheesecake was easy to make and came out wonderful!  I used 15 whole graham crackers and it was too much crust for me. I also omitted the milk and reduced the flour to 3 Tbs.  The directions do not say to bake the crust, but I think next time I will.  I did not use a water bath and the cake looked wonderful, not one crack!

It didn't taste like any great cheesecake I have ever had.  I followed the directions to a tee.  It didn't crack, but the taste was not great.  It was nice to have strawberries on hand to cover up the taste.

DEEEE-LICIOUS!  Yum!  The only thing I would do differently is prebake the crust; mine got a little soggy after sitting in the fridge!  I used all my ingredients at room temperature and let it cool in the oven for about 4 hours before chilling and I had no cracks; it turned out PERFECTLY.  Go Chantal.

I followed directions to a T, twice, but this came out horribly cracked both times.  I even tried shortening the bake time to 50 minutes.  My step-daughter commented that the end result resembled "a road map".  It tasted fine but I've had better luck with many other cheesecake recipes.

This cheesecake was fantastic!  I did make a few modifications to the recipe after reading the reviews. I baked it in a water bath as suggested by other reviewers and it worked perfectly. I also sprayed the bottom and sides of my springform pan with Pam before adding the crust and cheesecake batter. It pulled apart from the sides super easy and didn't crack even a little bit.  I decreased the flour to 2 tbsp and hand mixed the ingredients after I blended the cream cheese and sugar together. I also added about a 1/4 cup of sugar to the crust and about 2 more tbsp of butter to the crust mixture. It was sooo good!  I do have a couple of things I would do differently next time. I would recommend mixing each ingredient into the mixture individually. I put my flour and vanilla in at the same time and the vanilla clumped with the flour, so there were little spots of vanilla in the mixture. I am also going to use less vanilla next time, like only about 1 teaspoon instead of a tablespoon.  The texture of this cheesecake was fabulous! I let it sit in the oven overnight because I baked it in the evening. I then refrigerated it all day before we finally cut into it.  It really turned out GREAT. And the flavors seem to get better each day as the cheesecake ages.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

My first cheesecake was a huge success!  I followed the directions as written but I did include a water bath.  I left the cheesecake in the oven for almost seven hours and there was not a crack to be seen!  I made it two days before I needed it and everyone loved it and asked for a slice to-go.  I will make this every chance I get- sooooooo easy and delicious!  Oh, and I did serve it with cherry pie filling on the side-  I didn't want to cover the cheesecake because it looked so amazing.  Thanks so much for sharing such a remarkable recipe!

This cheesecake was so good! My mother-in-law wanted to eat the whole thing, and my grandma got mad when I tried to share with my aunt!  My mom made a rasberry topping (taken from a cobbler recipe) that complimented it really well and even though it didn't last too long we found that the next day the flavors had really had a chance to meld and was fantastic with a rich roasted coffee.

wow. wow. wow. wow. WOW.

this was my first attempt in making cheesecake and i was totally blown away at the end result! i was really afraid of overbeating the cream cheese, so i beat the cream cheese with a beater and then mixed in everything else by hand. however, i was still a bit paranoid, and might have underbeat the filling (there were small little lumps).

however, this recipe turned out to be AMAZING. it was creamy and had a great texture!!

on top, i made a raspberry sauce (10oz frozen raspberries, sugar, cornstarch, little bit of water to boil; drain seeds). so i drizzled the raspberry sauce and garnished with fresh blueberries make a killer combo! :D

i will be most definitely making this again!!

OMG -- this cheesecake is to die for!  Thank you so much for making me look so good at my husband's holiday party.  Used the water bath as suggested by other reviewers with picture-perfect results.  EXCELLENT!!!  2nd comment added 7/28/08 -- made this again and it was just as terrific.   There was not a crumb left on anyone's plate....trust me folks...this is the real deal!

The absolute "BEST"! I baked Chantal's New York Cheesecake for Thanksgiving and my family and guests couldn't get enough!  Neither could I!  This recipe is restaurant quality, if not better.  The taste and texture are superb.  I followed this recipe to a "T", and it came out perfect -- no cracks.  I have requests to bake more.  I will use this recipe again and again -- a definite keeper.  Thanks, Chantal!!!

Even with the few substitutions I was forced to make, this cheesecake was divine!

I could not find graham crackers or sour cream anywhere, so instead I used ginger snaps for the crust and plain low fat yogurt. I also used fat-free cream cheese, topped it with cherry pie filling, and it got rave reviews by all. This recipe is a sure keeper!

This was a beautiful cheesecake!! I followed the instructions, used a water bath, and had to increase the baking time a bit. I left it in the oven and was in a rush so I forgot to run a knife around the edge, which I would recommend you doing. It was pretty, but when I came home a couple hours later, I looked in the oven and it had a little crack in the center. I masked it with toffee bits and dark chocolate sauce. I made this for a charity event to sell (fortunately they sell by the slice and cut the cake strategically- no more crack!) and they loved it! I just wish I could try some- I'll definitely make this again!

Taste update: Very, very good! This rivals my hubby's cheesecake (: Original review: This was an ok recipe, but I followed the instructions & it still cracked badly on top. I did trade 1/4 cup of the milk for coffee, and I topped with mocha chocolate chip cookie crumbies (thanks, Amy!). Will update on taste and probably bump up a star. Having this for my niece's bday get together tomorrow.

This is really good...mine cracked a little, despite a water bath, but who cares. It was my first. I dont think it's a true NY cheesecake, but it's yummy. For my sauce I made this: 1/4 cup sugar (heated in a pan), a cup of pureed raspberries and a cup of pureed strawberries. Strain both and add to the sugar. Put in almost a whole bottle of a mini bottle (airplane bottle) of Amaretto, drink whats left of the amaretto, and juice of half a lemon. Heat just under a boil then refridgerate. A perfect berry sauce.

This is a spectacular cheesecake recipe!  Although I have spent years baking, I have never attempted a cheesecake before.  I decided that I had to try this one after I read all of the great reviews.  I made sure all of my ingredients were room temperature and I also made sure not to overmix the filling.  I did as other reviewers suggested and placed a pan of hot water in the oven on the bottom rack for 20 minutes prior to baking the cheesecake.  I left it in there the entire time and my cheesecake did not have one single crack in it.  I also made sure not to ever open the oven door.  The suspense was killing me, but it was so worth it.  I used cherry pie filling as a topping.  This is just a really great recipe and I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was destined to be a flop for me: I didn't have any graham cracker crumbs so I couldn't make a crust, my spring-form pan is broken so I had to use a 9 x 13 pan, I forgot to set the timer, and so on. But it turned out great! Apart from those little glitches, I followed the recipe exactly as written. THIS is real NY cheesecake and is exactly the taste that I expected. I will definitely make this again in the future. Thanks for such an amazing recipe!

Really, Really good cheescake. It was my first time making cheescake and it came out perfect. I put the water bath on the shelf below and it worked just fine. I also used two (but I had enough for three) store bought crust because I dont own a springform pan and they worked great, I just lowered the heat to 325 (as others suggested) cut the cooking time in half. I didnt get not one crack.

Sigh. I followed this recipe to a T, and it smells divine as I type this. But in the center is one big, giant, ugly, inch thick X. I tried so hard to make it beautiful! I hope it tastes amazing, as I will try to make another one tomorrow that looks better. Otherwise, what a waste of money and ingredients and time. The tops and sides are nice and pale, no browned sides. So why the crack??!!  :(  UPDATE: I really did not care for the taste of this recipe. Consistancy was fine, it looked ok (aside from the giant cracks), and it smelled delicious. The taste- not great at all. There were a few who enjoyed it somewhat, but just not a hit here. I'll keep looking.

I made this cheesecake with my mother for a family reunion. We used a 10 inch springform pan because she didn't have an 8 inch. It raised very high while baking, almost spilling over the pan. We thought it wasn't done so we left it in about 20 minutes longer and the whole top turned brown. While it was sitting overnight it shrunk down in height, and cracked in a circle. I think if we'd just let it be after the first hour it would have turned out better. None the less it tastes great! and I'm topping it with "Praline Sundae Topping" from thsi site - Heaven!

I made this cheesecake and it was so good I did not even get a piece.  I did like someone suggested and baked it in the water bath, but my crust did not come off the pan when it was being served.  I am going to make it again tonight.  Thank you.

This recipe is easy and I've never made cheesecake before or knew what a water bath is.  Bake it at 325 degrees for an hour and make sure to put aluminum foil around the springform pan.  Very easy and I took the cheesecake out of the oven after 2 hours and put it in the refrigerator.  No cracks.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I too expected big things from this cheesecake.  Everyone said it was good, but mine didn't look anything like the picture.  Maybe I over mixed it or something, but it was dark on top and tasted just average to me.  It also had a large crack down the middle and I followed the recipie exactly as written.  It did taste good, but I probably won't try it again.

Wow!  Amazing recipe, great flavor and texture.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did take others' advice and I reduced the amount of graham crackers to about 12 and I still had too much.  The secret to a NO-CRACK top is to spray the sides of the springform with Pam.  As the cheesecake cools it won't stick to the side of the pan which causes the crack in the middle.  I tried it and I had a picture perfect result.  Everyone kept asking me if I bought it!! A winner, I will make this again and again!

i poured a layer of fudge on top of the crust and then pressed dried organic cherries (without added sugar) into fudge layer and then poured the cheesecake mixture on. topped with  real whipped cream & chocolate shavings after cake cooled. everyone was impressed.

Absolutely perfect cheesecake!!  I followed advice from other reviewers: added 2 TBLS sugar, increased butter to 1/4 c. for the graham cracker crust,added 1 1/2 tsp. lemon juice to the filling and baked using a water bath.  My family loved it!!

I've been baking cheesecake for years, and this is the best recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I tell all my friends that I have perfected cheesecake, but the truth is that Chantal did! Thanks Chantal- we'll keep it our little secret (and all the allrecipe viewers) Enjoy!!

Great Recipe!!  I also altered the crust as other users did.  I actually used a 9.5" glass pie pan, because I don't have a springform pan(this was my first cheesecake).  I had quite a bit of batter left so this gave me two cheesecakes :-).  Worked great... tasted delicious and no cracks!  I set my oven to  325, filled a broiler pan with water and set the dish in that.  Once the cake was set, but still moved in the center I shut off the oven and let set for 5 hours.  My family loved it!!  We drizzled the top of the cheesecake with sliced frozen strawberries.  Yum!

I made this for a dinner party over the weekend, and my guests included a number of world travelers who have dined in many fine restaurants.  They all insisted this was THE BEST cheesecake they had ever had.  I sweeted my crust with a little sugar, and topped it with sliced strawberries.  Can't wait to make it again!

This is a wonderful recipe. This was my first time making a cheesecake. I got a springform pan for easter, so I thought why not. My family and boss are already putting in orders. I loved the recipe, it was so easy. I did everything in the reviews, greasing the whole pan super well, ingredients all at room teperature, tried not to overmix, wraped it in double foil, and bathed it. I got out a old roast pan and filled it half way with water. I only checked it about 45 minutes later so the water did not all evaporate. I didnt want to open the door a bunch and ruin it or let all the warm air out. I let mine cook a hour, rest in the oven for almost seven hours and cool in the refrig. untill we ate. Actually, we fell asleep.  At the end, NOT ONE CRACK!!!!! I was so excited. The only thing I made different was I made mine oreo, with oreo crust, I used 16 oreos but should of used probably 25- 28. I cooked the crust for ten minutes while i mix the other stuff, and folded in six crushed oreos. I would give ten more stars!!!!!

I find this cheesecake to be the best in FLAVOR!  I have never been one to like cheesecake of any kind; they always were very overpowering of a heavy cream cheese taste.  With Chantal's New York Cheesecake i've now changed my mind; very smooth and creamy! I even ate a piece of this one along with all my friends this cake was finished in a day.

I am writing this review only for people who want to try mini cheesecakes like me. I just couldn't have baked a whole cheesecake for 2 people, yet I wanted the dessert to be special. So, made 1/4th the recipe and baked in muffin tins with muffin paper. Baked for 30 mins. My minis cracked like none of my cheesecakes ever have inspite of the water bath. I am sure it had to do with  the paper in the muffin tins. The cheesecake was a little dense than usual. But the truth is it didn't taste bad. Hubby liked it. So, worth the effort but  baking the whole thing would have been better.

I made this for my husband and I. It was excellent! Using a springform pan and a waterbath, it didn't crack at all. We savored every last bite making it last for two weeks.

Superb.  I got a little crack even though I used a water bath, but I admit I opened the oven door to sneak a peek after my 60 minutes was up.  Actually, I think 55 min would have been long enough for my oven which runs very hot.  When I checked it at 59 minutes it was definitely done (nearly set in the center) and starting to brown around the edges.  Next time I'll just peek through the oven door at 55 min and see if it looks done.  Having said that though, this is definitely EXCELLENT both in flavor and texture.  You don't need me to tell you that 900 reviews later though!  Definitely a keeper for "plain" (in the nicest sense of the word) cheesecake.  Delicious.  Thank you.

This recipe is great, I use it as a base recipe and have made many variations with it.  It does crack, but if you put a pan of water in the oven with it and use a 9" pan it comes out perfectly!

Wondering if you should try this recipe? Yeah! I was a bit skeptical even thugh the ratings were high since i'm from Trinidad and my taste might not be the same as a lot of the reviewers but this recipe is the bomb! This coming from a caterer and cake decorator! Its so good that i'm pretty selfish when people ask for the recipe! Hee hee...

This is a great New York style recipe!  I had a little trouble with my oven and had to open it a few times so my cheesecake was cracked all over - but after sitting overnight in the fridge it settled down and was delicious!  My husband ate 2 pieces a day until it was gone!!  Will definitely make again!

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake, and what a success!  The texture was great, exactly what I like (not as light and fluffy as other people make prefer, though).  The crust turned out a little dry, so I may add more butter next time.  Definitely a recipe that I will use again.  Thanks!

A good cheesecake, very creamy; but not a great cheesecake. Too bland for my personal tastes, but my company enjoyed it.

Ok, I can't really cook very well.  So if I can make this, anyone can!  

I've never made things where people are oohing and aaahhhing over it.  No one has ever asked me for a recipe.  

However, I brought this into work and everyone went NUTS!  One guy has begged me to make it for his birthday coming up!  So good and so easy!  Thank you so much!

THE BEST!  Followed cheesecake pointers and BaM, I had a perfect cheesecake.  I changed the crust up a little, didn't pre-bake as suggested, came out excellent.  One important point, Hide a piece because it is gone faster than a good gravy.  ENJOY!  THANKS!

oh my goodness!!!  WOW!  This cheesecake is amazing!  Better than specialty stores!  I am not a fan of baked cheesecakes and my husband doesn't like cheesecake at all, but between dessert and going to bed last night we managed to eat 2/3 of it ourselves.  Yes I had three pieces!!!  It was creamy and light with amazing flavour.  I used graham wafer crumbs and melted butter for the crust (too lazy to crush crackers)  and I used a strawberry topping with shaved white and dark chocolate.  My new "have to impress someone" dessert!!!!

I made this recipe for Longest Night (cheesecake for Longest Night being a tradition in our family) and it was absolutely delicious. I was terrified I'd overbaked it because of the springy feel it had by the time I turned the oven off, but it turned out to be slightly *less* done than I like! The middle was done, but creamy and soft, whereas I prefer a dryer, almost crumbly texture, which the edges did have. Next time I'll bake it longer and with more confidence, and believe me, there will be a next time.

Excellent flavor and texture. I did the water bath and not one crack. I did not have a springform pan, so bought a graham crust from the store. If you do buy a store bought pie crust, half the recipe or buy 2 crusts.

This recipe is a gem! I've made this cheesecake a few times and I always get the most compliments from it. For those of you that know The Cheesecake Factory, this recipe rivals their NY Cheesecake recipe. 

I also added a sour cream "Topping". I don't let the cake sit in the oven for hours - I find that mine cracks regardless, so I let it sit for 30-45 min in the oven then take 1 8oz container of REAL (not low or no fat)sour cream, mix in confectioners sugar to taste, then spread on top. I place the cake back in the oven for another 30 min or so, take it out, and  let it cool on the counter...then into the fridge overnight.  When I take it from the springform, voila! A beautiful NY Cheesecake. 

THANKS CHANTAL!!!

I'd give this recipe more stars if I could!!! Simply put, it's the best! Tastes like it's from the bakery and has restaurant quality---it was my very first successful cheesecake (others I've tried before turned out to be a gooey mess, even after I've baked it). This tastes best after a couple of days, so like others said, you should make it 2-3 days ahead of time. Didn't change a thing about it! I did have a teeny tiny crack, but didn't care because it tasted so good. This is the only traditional cheesecake recipe I'll use from now on!!! (I made it for Thanksgiving, and the family and I fought over who gets the 'left over' or 'extra' pieces of cheesecake after everone already got a piece!!!)

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit!  I lightly drizzled Dove ice cream chocolate over it and added a few blackberries on the top.  I did double the melted butter for the crust. My cake split, but who cares! It was great!

The cheesecake itself is wonderful.  I actually took some advice from other members by adding more butter, sugar, and cinnamon to the crust, and a sour cream topping to the top after baking.  Well, I should have followed the original recipe word for word.  My crust was too sweet and the topping sub par.  I cooked the cake in a water bath and springform pan, with no cracks or sinking whatsoever.  The cake came out beautiful (and HUGE!).  For classic cheesecake, this is the best recipe ever!

ok, I'm jumping on the bandwagon!  This recipe is fabulous.  I used the water bath according to the cheesecake baking tips on this site, and I didn't have any cracks!  Absolutely heavenly flavor and creamy texture!    Thanks for the recipe, Chantal!

The is the first time that i've ever made. There was a few cracks even tho i used water bath. I used a 7" springform pan so i halved the ingredients, and baked at 300F for 40 minutes. I also let it sit in the oven for 3 hours. It didnt look fully cooked in the middle, and the crust was too thin. Next time, i would add more graham crumbs and bake at a higher temperature for a longer time. I guess these were all my own fault because i changed the baking time and temperature. Overall, this cheesecake tasted WONDERFUL! I would definitely try these again!

This cheesecake is amazing! After I combined the graham crackers with the butter and tuck into the base of springform pan, I put it in the freezer for 15 min, or you can put it in the fridge for an hour to make sure it doesn't get messy and stays firm after baking. Baked for an hour with a bigger pan filled with water (au bain marie), and make sure cover the bottom of the springform pan with aluminium foil. I never once opened the oven door, went to the mall and when we came back, it stayed there for around 2 hours and it looked beautiful. No cracks or whatsoever and taste delicious. Dip the knive in hot water before cutting. Thanks a lot for the recipe. Hubby says it's one of the best cheesecake out there!

This is one of the few cheesecakes that I've made that turned out picture perfect!  It sliced perfectly (with the help of a heated knife) and looked store bought. I did make a few changes though...I added more graham crumbs and butter to work up the sides of the pan (I just think it looks nicer) I also didn't add the flour or milk and used 500ml (2 cups)of sour cream instead of one. This made the cake firm yet rich in taste...I also used a water bath.  I'm not a fan of creamy or runny cheesecakes so to me this is one of the best yet!  I will definitely make this time and time again!

I used fat-free milk, cream cheese, sour cream and only 1/2 the sugar. 

I had no clue how it was going to turn out. I took it out of the oven 30 mins ago. It was still warm, and between my 2 daughters, son-in-law, husband and granddaughter... there is NONE left for desert!! When I told them it was done with ff ingred. No one believed me! If I could rate this more then a 5 I would!
I can't even imagine how good the REAL recipe would taste.

This is the first cheesecake I have ever made and it is without a doubt the richest and creamiest cheesecake I have ever eaten. Not because I made it, but because the recipe is sensational. 

This recipe was really not as daunting as I expected it to be.
     I left the cream cheese, sour cream, butter and the eggs out for 3 hours to get to room temperature. I preheated the oven  whilst I was mixing the ingredients and then made the base. (I blended it on med-low until smooth and it came out with no lumps at all. 
I put the cheesecake in the waterbath of HOT water and placed it in the oven for and 1 hour at 175c. (I also have a non-stick spring pan that seals well so i didn't have any water leakage.) I let it cool for 3 hours in the oven and then took it out and placed it on the counter for another 30 min. Then I refrigerated it for 3 hours and it was ready. I had no cracking or bubbling whatsoever.

Overall this recipe is wonderful and I strongly suggest that you give it a go.

For the base you absolutely have to try Dutch spiced windmill cookies. They already have a rich blend of flavours in them and really seem to bring out this cheesecake well. I used 1 and 1/2 cups of them and about 60g of butter. It worked a treat for me. I do hope some of you give them a go.

Wow! This was soooo good. I served this when me and my bf were throwing a dinner for my parents. Everyone loved it. A piece was saved and forgotten in the freezer. About 6 months later I found it and ate some again. It was still divine! I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks!

Quite possibly the best cheesecake I've ever tasted.  I followed the directions and it cracked anyway, but I couldn't care less.  A small jar of spreadable fruit on the top and who's the wiser?  It was delicious.

This is an amazing recipe!!  It's so simple to make and comes out just like the cheesecake from the delis and diners I recall so fondly in NY.  I used shortbread cookies and lemon zest to make my crust to furthermore mimic the authenticity of a NY city slice of heaven!  Delicious!

This recipe was amazing!  I have never made a recipe for anything from scratch, but this came out perfect!  I used the oven roaster bag and the water bath as recommended by others.  I left it in the oven with the door closed for 3 hours afterward and then transferred to the fridge.  It was sooo good - creamy and smooth with just a hint of gold around the edges.  It did not crack or get over cooked.  Simply amazing!

How many times can I say YUM?! This was only my second cheesecake I've ever baked...it was perfect! No cracks, no sinking...I was SO excited when I woke up 6 hours later and removed it from the oven! I did, however, as a safety precaution, put a little metal bowl of water in the oven next to it while it baked because I heard that prevented cracking. This was delicious! I did, however, have some trouble with the crust...2 tbls butter was just not enough. I ended up refering to this site's White Chocolate Blueberry Cheesecake (my first cheesecake) recipe to make the crust, using 1/4 cup butter and 2 tsp caramel but omitting the almonds. Delicious! I used 1 block of reduced fat cream cheese with 3 regulars, still tasted awesome! I baked it for my friends and they loved it...one even announced to everyone that I bake the best cheesecake in the world *grin* Thanks so much for this fantastic recipe!

This recipe was absoulutely fabulous.  I made one for church fellowship and it was literally completely gone in 5 minutes.  People bypassed the main course just to get the cheesecake before it was gone!!  I baked in a water bath and left the cake in the oven for about 15 min. after baking and had No cracks -- everyone asked how!!  I put a handful of strawberries inthe blender with a few heaping tbs. of sugar and let puree for a min.  I put in a piping bag and drizzled over cold cake before serving and put a few strawberries in the middle.... MMMmmmm... Perfect!!

I love this recipe.  Everytime I make it, someone asks me where I found the recipe.   I have changed a few things.  For the crust I double the butter, otherwise the crust turns out really crumbly.  This cheesecake also HAS TO be baked in a water bath, or it will definitely crack.  Instead of wrapping tin foil around the base of your spring form pan,  use an oven bag to put around the pan, because with tinfoil water leaks in no matter what.  I don't keep the cake in the oven for 5 to 6 hours.  I immediately put it in the fridge.  This also helps to prevent cracking.  Don't be discouraged if the first time you make it, it cracks.  It takes a little practice.  Even if it does crack, the flavor is generally just as delicious.

Amazing cheesecake!  Everytime I make it I get rave reviews, I have been asked to make this cake everytime someone I know has a party or special occasion.  Kraft cream cheese really does make this the best ever.  I also add 2 Tbs of brown sugar to crust, it makes it stick together a little better

This recipe was FANTASTIC! My first attempt at a cheesecake.  I was a bit nervous because I was making this for a dinner with my parents and my husband's parents.  I followed the recipe exactly but still ended up with a crack in the cheesecake.  Covered it up with a sour cream/vanilla/sugar frosting.  I also baked the graham cracker crust for about 10 mins before putting the filling in.  My husband was raving about the cheesecake and saying how much better it was than other ones he's had.  I have to admit, it is great and I will make again!  Everyone else seems to really enjoy it too, very creamy. Thanks!

I made this cheesecake last night, and as I do with any new recipe I doubled it. I made one cheesecake for myself to test before serving the other one to friends and family.  As stated in the blip this does taste just like real New York deli cheesecake.  Its wonderful, and didn’t crack at all!  However, I did feel the recipe needed a couple of alterations.

1.)For the crust 15 gram crackers just didn’t quite seem like enough (I like to push the gram crackers to the sides of the pan as well as the bottom).  I used about 1/12 cups of crushed CINNAMON gram crackers and 6 tablespoons of melted butter.  The crust was soooo yummy!  I baked the crust for 5 min in the 350 degree oven before adding the batter
2.) Also, I’m not sure if it’s my oven or what, but the cheesecake required LONGER than 60 min to bake…the center was still too gooey.  I baked it an hour and 20 min (using a water bath as other readers suggested it didn’t crack at all.
3.)I only left the cheesecake in the oven for an hour (rather than 6 like stated) before placing in the fridge….I didn’t receive any cracking.

This was a wonderful cheesecake and I will definitely use it again!  Thanks!

Chantal! My, my, my, my, umm, umm, good!  Guess what! this was my very firt time baking a cheesecake and I got very good raves on it. I am a homebaker in the Raleigh area (Unique Cakes) and I've had request on doing a cheesecake wedding cake. This will be the recipe I will use. I wish I could give it more stars other than 5 because this deserves it. I made a few moderations to this for my taste and it worked out well for me. I was reading over some of the many reviews you got from this and I've added 1/2 cup of sugar and increased the butter to 1/2 cup for the crust. I didn't count the graham crackers but I put 1 1/2 cups (I guess it depends on how thick you wnat it. I also added 1/2 t. pure almond extract to the filling and it was great.  As for the crust I bake it at 400 degrees for 3 min. and bake the whole ch.cake for 15 min. and turned the oven down to 200 and continue baking for 3 hours. I let this cool in the oven for about 5 hours then refrigeated it, It turned out beautifully.  Thanks again.

There's a reason for the high rating on this one!  It is superb!  My husband LOVES cheesecake but I have never tried it before because I always thought they were so fickle.  After reading through all of the reviews and tips here, I decided to try it.  I did the graham cracker crust with the seasonings and avoided overmixing.  I placed a 9x13 pan full of boiling water on the rack below the springform pan, baked for 1 hr at 325 degrees (I had a dark pan) and let it sit for 4 hours in the oven before refrigerating uncovered overnight.  No cracks!  I served with some blueberry topping I made with fresh blueberries.  Even I, who doesn't care much for cheesecake, can hardly keep out of it!!!

mmmm!! it is deeelicciousss. i made a different crust using the recipe other reviewers suggested: 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup chopped pecans, 1/4 cup melted butter, except i only used 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. the crust had a nice taste although maybe i'll try a walnuts next time. i baked the crust for 3 minutes before filling it but i think it was too little time because it is still a little soggy and i didn't even use a waterbath. so next time i will bake for 5-10 minutes. i had this huuuuge crack in my cheesecake, but i think it was because i overmixed it. good tip i read on here .. add the vanilla and mix that in before adding the flour! i baked it for an hour at 325 F because i have a dark pan. when it was done, i was about to take it out and take my knife and run it around the edges to prevent cracking but as soon as i opened the door i started panicking because it looked sooo weird! so don't get freaked out when you open the oven door and the middle is sunken in and take a knife and dip it in warm water and run it around the edges to prevent cracking and stick it back in the oven for cooling. and don't cover the cheesecake when you put it in the refrigerator to cool or else it'll get all.....wet. this was my first time making cheesecake and even though there were a few minor problems it still turned out delicious in the end!! i will definitely be making more cheesecakes now :)

Very easy to make.  I chose to use a pan of boiling water on the rack below the cheesecake instead of the water bath.  Didn't want to take a chance of water seeping in. Mine did crack, but leaving it in the oven for 5  hours and refridgerate till the next day, it settled and couldn't see a trace of the cracks. This was very creamy & delicious.

Very creamy and velvety smooth!  One of the best cheesecakes I have ever had - couldn't stop eating it!  I made it light - used Neufchatel, 2 eggs and 4 whites, and light sour cream - and it was still delicious! (use 2/3 cup milk with Neuf. as it is a little softer than regular cc).

This cheesecake is FANTASTIC! My husband said "this is restaurant material." I brought all of my ingredients to room temperature first. I used a crust recipe from the side of the graham cracker crumbs box and added a teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice for a little zip.  I also put a pyrex dish of hot water on the lower rack of the oven.  I didn't have the 5-6 hours for the cake to sit so I took it out after 3 hours & put it into the fridge and it didn't crack. I'm looking forward to making this again.

Wow! This is one terrific cheesecake. What I was actually looking for was a peanut butter cheesecake recipe. What I ended up doing was using half of the sour cream and I added a cup and a half of P.B. I then melted semi-sweet chocolate and drizzled over the cake. We all loved this rich and creamy dessert Chantel! Thanks for sharing.

This was such an easy cheesecake to make.  I made it the night before, and let it set in the oven over night.  The top was beautiful.  And it had a wonderful creamy taste.  I will make this again and again!

I was scared to ever make a cheesecake.  I thought they would be to hard.  I tried this one and all I can tell you is OOHH so creamy.  The best!! My hubby doesn't eat desserts usually, but he couldn't get enough of this cheesecake.  Not too sweet.  LOVE IT!!  Thanks!!

I made this for my family for Christmas and it turned out perfect.  I was told it looked and tasted like a "professional" cheesecake.  I served raspberry sauce and cherry pie filling on the side for those who don't like it plain (like me) but most people loved it by itself!  Easy to do, too.  Thank you, Chantal.

Having been from NYC originally, I was looking for a recipe that really popped. La Bella Ferrara or Junior's type cheesecake. That's not what I got. I only left the heat on for 45 minutes vs. an hour and it was still a little too brown on the edges. I had two very small cracks, even with a water bath, but if the cake wasn't so brown it would have still looked nice. The texture was right on, but the flavor wasn't. Any good cheesecake I've ever had has had a slight twinge of some sort of citrus-like flavor and this lacked it. I'll probably try it again, but the recipe and cooking time will be tweaked a bit.

Cake did crack even though I did not open the oven for over 6 hours. This should not happen if you wrap the pan in aluminum foil (to make it water tight) and bake it in a pan with an inch of water.

This recipe is FABULOUS!!!  I agree - it's easy to make, incredibly tasty, just like yhe cheesecake I pay $6 for at the restaurant.  I followed this recipe exactly (no water bath, variations, etc.) and it turned out beautifully high, fluffy but smooth texture, light brown and no cracks.  It's a keeper - thank you Chantal for sharing this gem of a recipe!!

This is the first baked cheesecake I have ever made and it came out perfect.  I did not open the oven for six hours after turning off the oven and I got no cracks.  I'm glad the other reviews stressed this step.  I don't even like cheesecake much and I ate three pieces!

Outstanding!!!  I have been making cheesecakes for years but this is undoubtedly the best!  After reading other reviews I used a regular recipe for the graham craker crust that contained sugar.  I followed the recipe to the tee and it came out beautifully - no cracks - no change in oven temperature.  I did add a pan of water on the rack UNDER the cheesecake and I left it in the oven (without opening the door) for the allotted time. I put a blueberry topping on it.  This one replaces all the other cheesecake recipes I have!!  Thank you!!

I improvised this recipe somewhat and it turned out perfect.  I used 11/4 cups graham cracker crumbs with 1/4 cup sugar and 1/3 cup melted butter for the crust.  I only used 1/2 cup milk and three eggs to make it less runny and a bit more dense. Baked it at 325 degrees for one hour.  The secret to not having cracks is letting cheese come to room temp. and making sure you don't overmix batter.  Also careful not to overbake.  Thanks for the great recipe Chantal.

This is an excellent cheese cake. My mother is very picky, and she usually buys those real expensive one's from Sam's...but she loved this one. It was easy, and not to mention cheap. The only problem I had was with it cracking, and I didn't like the crust, it was somewhat bitter. Other than that, it was great.

I made this twice.  the first time I didnt realize I was out of milk and didnt have enough eggs when I went shopping, I made it anyways using extra sour cream and a bit of water.  It actually turned out great.  I took it out of the oven after it resting an hour cause it needed to be cold by night.  It was a hit

The next time i made it, i followed directions like a bible, thinking it might even be better.  I left it in the oven for 6 hours after turning off the oven.  When I returned it was a shriveled up, nasty, thick skined, funny textured mess.  Well it wasnt cracked . . . but who cares what it looks like when it tastes so bad.  The kids wont eat it, my boyfriend and my dog will, they will eat anything.

my husband found the best way to make this cake is to let the cream cheese soften and do all the mixing by hand in a very large bowl.  We also added a bit of sugar to the crushed graham crackers.

This is my usual recipe for New York style cheesecake. It's practically foolproof if you have the correct temp in your oven and follow the directions.  The number of people who have negative ratings on this lead me to believe that they have never had the real New York style. It's dense and not overly sweet. I usually put slices in the freezer and only partially defrost so it's still very cold and firm and pieces flake off with a fork.  Once it gets to the correct time, I turn the oven off and leave. I don't look, peek, or check for 6-8 hours. Never, ever had a problem in over 20 years of using this recipe.

This (with a few tiny adjustments) is the best cheesecake in the world. Here are my recommendations - First, use 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of vanilla instead of 1. Second, add a tablespoon of lemon juice to the cheesecake mixture. Third, use 2 tablespoons of flour instead of 1/4 cup. Fourth, bake it at 325 for one hour exactly, then turn the oven off and let it sit for at least one more hour before putting it into the fridge uncovered overnight. I did not bake it in a water bath, instead I put a large pan of boiling water on the shelf below it as it was cooking. It did not crack at all.

That's it! I made my own custom graham cracker crust but unfortunately I eyeballed everything for the crust instead of using measurements. I used a medium stack of graham crackers, finely crushed. Add no more than 1/2 cup finely ground raw unsalted almonds. Dash of cinnamon, tiny pinch salt, nice little pile of sugar. mix together, then slowly blend in melted unsalted butter until it it at a consistency that can *almost* be formed into a ball without falling apart. Press into pan and voila.

This is the second time I've made this recipe.  It needed a half cup of butter for the crust and it needed to be baked at 325.  I let all of the ingredients come to room temperature before mixing.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as is and it's perfect!!

I made this exactly as per the recipe (maybe a little less flour) and it was perfect.  I greased the sides thoroughly and while I wrapped it in foil for the waterbath, I didn't have a bath big enough for it so I did without and it was perfect.  No cracks.  Left it in the oven for about 2 hours after cooking (cooked for about an extra 25 minutes) and then refrigerated overnight.  Topped with berries.  My husband loved it! So rich but so delicious.

I completely agree with Rollin's review. I didn't like the way it tasted. Mine...there were parts that burned, the outside was dry and cracked some while the inside was really mushy.

I am a complete rookie when it comes to making cheesecake, in fact, i was TERRIFIED to even try making a cheesecake.i always assumed it was THE most difficult thing to do. this recipe changed my mind completely about cheesecake. i followed the recipe to T and it came out PERFECT. tastes DE-LISH!!! i did have cracks on top(doesn't bother me) but i will definitely try  the suggestion from another reviewer which is not to over mix(i beat the hell out of the ingredients). TRY it! it's the easiest most spot-on recipe ever!!!

I made this without reading any of the comments - my cream cheese was cold, and I used my mixer to blend everything together (i.e. didn't blend the extra ingredients by hand). As I made this in the evening, I didn't have 5-6 hours to leave in in the oven... so I just left it for 3 hours, then used a sharp knife to go around the edge before I put it into the fridge. It turned out perfectly! No cracking, nice texture throughout and very delicious. The only thing I would do differently is add some sugar to the crust next time.

Yes! This! It's amazing. Although I used a different crust (Graham Cracker Crust I from this site, which was delicious), I followed the recipe otherwise. I baked it at 325 for an hour with some pans of water on the bottom rack of the oven, left it in the oven for 2 hours to cool, then put it in the fridge overnight. It was the perfect texture and flavour and it didn't have any cracks. This is the best cheesecake I've ever made (and I've made a lot). One tip (which someone else has probably written somewhere in the thousands of reviews of this cake) for bringing your cream cheese to room temperature more quickly without a microwave is to put the little foil packages of cream cheese in a Ziploc bag and submerge them in a bowl of warm water. I left mine in there for about 30 minutes I think. Having room temperature cream cheese (and other ingredients, but cream cheese especially) is really important and this is a good way to expedite the process if you are in a hurry.

This was my first attempt at full-size cheesecake.  I've made the small cupcake versions from Kraft recipes and they always turn out great so I finally purchased a springform pan. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and was very sad because none of us liked it.  I couldn't even give it to my 22 year old son who eats everything!  It was too "airy", bland in taste and the crust stuck to the pan. I chose this recipe because of the stars and amount of reviews.  I also followed the recipe exactly except I was uncertain on the size of 15 graham crackers. I noticed that some people grease the pan or add a tray of water.  They also noted changes that were made to the recipe or stated not to blend too much.  If there are little tricks that are needed it would be wonderful to add to the directions because some of us newcomers aren't aware that these steps are necessary.

Best cheesecake recipe yet. Super easy and tastes fluffy. I don't put as much sugar as the recipe asks for. I only use 1 1/4 c, also add 1T lemon juice.  I then pour homemade strawberry syrup  and fresh strawberries just before serving..  Always a hit at parties ??

Taste great, a little burnt. When you shut of the oven only let it sit for 3-4 hours other wise it seems to get burnt.

The only thing I added on my own was a tablespoon of sugar to the batter because when I tried it, it was very tangy. Neverthess, it wasn't tasty at all. The batter needed so much more sugar, at least one full cup. It wasn't smooth or creamy either. I

I have never made cheesecake before. Made this recipe exactly as instructed, without any modifications. It came out perfectly- thick, creamy, and the perfect amount of sweetness. As a bonus, it didn't crack. My boyfriend feels it is restaurant quality or better... And I'd have to agree. 
Note: I was sure to only hand-mix (and avoid over-mixing) after creaming together sugar and cream cheese. This was noted in other reviews and think it may have helped my success. I greased the pan and followed the baking instructions. I did crack the oven at 3 hours to help with cooling, and then put it in the fridge at 4 hours (we got a little impatient). Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect and delicious. That's all I can say. This recipe is fabulous and is definitely worth your time. The first time I made this was probably the best tasting and it may never be the same again but no matter how the taste changes for me it will always be PERFECT AND DELICIOUS!

If you are looking for a New York style cheesecake, look no further than this recipe. It's thick, creamy and downright delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. I did get a few cracks around the edges but I could tell, as it was cooking,  that it was sticking to the sides as it was rising. I will make sure to grease the sides more thoroughly next time. 

Thank you, Taliesen, for this beautiful recipe!...and thank you Morina for the helpful tips in your comment.

Maybe I didn't cook it long enough but I've made cheesecakes for 10years and never did i have one split in half and not be cooked all the way through! It shouldn't take all day to cook first of all, I'm so disappointed. Never will I ever use this recipe again!!!!

I've made this cheesecake many times and it always gets rave reviews. However, I don't care for the crust so I use my own Oreo crust recipe - 2.5 cups ground Oreo cookies (centers removed), 5 tbsp melted butter, 1/3 c sugar, 1/8 tsp salt. 
I usually follow the directions and leave the cheesecake in the oven for 5 hours after baking but this last time I didn't because I was pressed for time. After it was done baking I cracked the oven door open and used a wooden spoon to keep it from closing. I let it sit for about 20 minutes then pulled it out and let it cool on the counter for about an hour before putting it in the fridge to chill. No cracks. I believe it's because I baked it in a water bath. I wrapped my 9" springform cheesecake batter filled pan with 2 layers of aluminum foil and set it inside a 12" round pan. I poured about 1" of boiling water into the larger pan. Then put it in the oven to bake. The steam from the water helps keeps the cheesecake moist and prevents cracks. In fact, once I didn't use a water bath and the cheesecake cracked even after letting it cool in the oven for 5 hours.

This is only my second cheesecake, and I made a few changes based on other recipes I've found.  

For the crust, I used 2 cups cinnamon graham crackers, pulsed in food processor with 1/2 cup walnuts, 1/2 cup melted, unsalted butter, 1 egg white, 1/2 cup organic sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  I greased a springform pan and pressed the crust mixture into the bottom and up around the sides (my husband prefers it that way); then I pre-baked the crust in a 325 degree oven for 17 min.

For the batter, I omitted the flour and milk altogether. The rest of the ingredients are the same.  I found that Cabot Neufchatel Cheese and Cabot Sour Cream work well, and they are GMO-free.

Rather than wrapping the pan in foil to set in the bain marie, I simply filled a large roasting pan with about 1 inch of hot water and set it on the rack below the cheesecake.  I baked it at 325 for one hour and let it set for only 2-3 hours in the oven (no opening the door).  Removed from oven, I let it cool to room temp. (no cracking! Yay!), then popped it into the fridge overnight to chill.  

This made an AWESOME cheesecake!  The crust was the best I've ever tasted, probably thanks to the added walnuts, sugar & cinnamon.  I am new to cheesecake-baking, but I found this combination of ingredients to be a total winner.  This cake got RAVE reviews from family & friends, and is so easy to make.  Will be making this for years to come!

This is a delicious, delicious cheesecake! And this was my first attempt at cheesecake too. I watch my carbs, and gluten is not my friend, so I replaced the sugar with 1 1/2 cups of regular Splenda, and I replaced the flour with about a tablespoon of coconut flour (coconut flour is much more absorbent than regular flour, so it is not a cup-for-cup exchange). I also used 15 gluten-free graham crackers for the crust. Success! I probably over-mixed it a bit, because while it was baking, the top puffed up like a souffle - but it sank evenly while it cooled, and the end result was still delicious, thick, rich, creamy, and the texture and flavor were perfect.  The top did crack but I made a quick sour cream topping and covered them up. No one knew the difference, and it was so good, no one would have cared anyway. No one would have guessed it was sugar free, either! Other than the sugar/flour substitutions, I made the recipe as written. If you follow the directions exactly, start off with room temp ingredients, and don't overmix - this comes out perfect! A great sugar-free, gluten free dessert!

I read the previous reviews and I must say, I agree that there are small tweaks but everyone's pallet is different. For me this was an amazing cheesecake. Only tweaks I made was cooked it on 325 for 1 hour and added sugar and nutmeg to crust.

This was my first ever attempt at making a cheesecake and it turned out perfect! I followed the recipe as is, with only two slight changes (per other reviewers):
1) the crust: Be careful here. it calls for "15 Graham crackers" which I interpreted as 15 whole crackers or 1.5 packages! I realized this was way too much after crushing them all. Use the previously mentioned recipe for the crust ( 1.5 C crushed graham crackers etc).
2) I did follow others recommendation and baked in the water bath. I used 3 layers of foil someone suggested and had no problem with water getting into the pan. 
I baked it for 60 min at 325 degrees and then just shut the oven off and let it sit in the oven for 8 hours (over night, since I baked it in the evening)Then, in the morning, refrigerated until serving it that night.
Perfect, perfect. perfect. So yummy. Thanks so much. This is a keeper!

I have made this cake a few times now.  And  it's the best i have ever eaten. I was happy making junior's of n.y. but this blows them out of the water.  First it does'nt turn back into a dense block of creamcheese. It's a bit fluffy in texture and still creamy. Read other reviews and pick different tips. I hand mixed after creamcheese and sugar spun in stand mixer. Also a water bath, ran a knife around it after the hour and put back in oven without water for remainder of the time. Pefect every time.

i don't know if this recipe is different from the classic new york cheesecake but i like it and my dad liked it too , but i had 2 issues : first the crust , very moist so i recommend to put it in the oven for 10 min to be little dry and crispy . the second issue that the cheesecake batter was little runny so i added 1 more Tsp four but after baking it was to short , i mean the batter was like compressed

Let me just say I have never made a cheesecake a day in my life. This receipt is rich, creamy, and absolutely delicious. I followed the instructions to the letter. I also baked it in a water bath as some have suggested. I sprayed my pan with a bakers spray that contains flour before I added my filling. I cooked my cake an hour before work and left it in the oven when until I got off. It didn't crack or dry out. I also added my flour last after everything was smooth. I mixed the floor in with a wisk by hand for about 30 seconds. I didn't want to over mix the cake. This receipt is perfect.

My go to cheesecake recipe. I substitute regular sugar with evaporated cane juice/sugar because it is less refined and you need less, only about 1 cup.

This is the best and easiest cheesecake I have ever made. I live in Germany and made this for my Osteopath and when I saw him on the next visit he had to pause and take a deep breath and say, 'This is the best cheesecake I have ever tasted.' Mind you, I live 20 minutes from France and they are know for their cheesecakes. I have tried this cake with cream cheese and with creme fresh, depending on what I had on hand, and had great success with both. The creme fresh tends to be lighter in texture, but not on flavor. I make my own Grahame crackers from organic Spelt instead of wheat. I use the recipe from here for the crackers. They are wonderful as well.  I do add my eggs last and it seems to make it even creamier in texture.  I have also made half the recipe and used a small spring form pan and it worked out great.  This is definitely a keeper. I try to make one a month, if not for my wonderful husband and I, then to family or neighbors. What a great gift to give, yummy cheesecake! I have added several pictures so you can see just how wonderful this cake is. MashaAllah!  Enjoy!

It was my very first time making a cheesecake from scratch and naturally, it was more than a little intimidating. Secondly, my oven won't be nominated for any prizes -- unless you count "Museum Centerpiece" or "Not-quite-antique-but-just-old", so, needless to say, the odds were stacked against me from the get-go. But, the amazing thing is, having read all the reviews, and, intent on applying the cross-cutting modifications, then reading a review that said to ignore all the modifications, I went ahead and ignored them, and then some. I did, in the short of it, follow this recipe to the exact T, nearly, with the exception of substituting regular milk for low-fat evaporated milk and very religiously, ensuring that I did not get too carried away with the mixing. Taking another reviewer's suggestion, I only mixed the cream cheese and the sugar with the handmixer. I did, however, pulverize the white sugar into a castor-sugar like particle in order to cut down the mixing time. And thereafter, I used a spoon to do the incorporating. I don't know if this helped - but I had not a crack on my cheesecake - absolutely flawless. My oven time did run to about 1 hour 30 minutes, but I fear that's because my oven will soon be retiring (or so, I hope!). All in all, this is an absolutely (almost) fail-safe, and comfortingly decadent and soothing cheesecake recipe. Bake away and enjoy to your heart's (but not waistline!) content.

This was great!  My only criticism is that the crust was too dry, so it was still in cracker crumb condition even after baking, so I'm going to stick to my tried-and-true crust recipe in the future.  I used blanched almond flour instead of all-purpose, since I don't keep all-purpose at home.  I used one of my mom's cheesecake tricks, which is making everything in the food processor, and it turned out perfectly, aside from the crumbly crust.  I didn't open the oven from the time it went in until 7 hours later when I took it out.  The taste and texture are fantastic, just what I was looking for.  New staple for the holidays!

I omitted the milk and flour and it was perfect.  It isn't overly sweet which we all loved.  There was a slight crack but not extensive so it was fine.

Made this for my husband's birthday at a family gathering.  Everyone loved it.  The cheesecake did crack severely even after leaving it in the oven, but I put a strawberry pie filling on top of the cheesecake and the cracks disappeared.  The flavor is excellent and lends itself to be altered if you desire.

4.5 stars only because it still cracked. I will definitely try a water bath next time. However, the taste and texture were phenomenal. Made it for Labor Day weekend and covered the cracks with cherry pie filling. Nobody noticed, nobody cared, everybody loved it. Will definitely make it several times in the future.

I've tried this recipe three times. I followed it exactly the first time, used a larger pan the second, and followed it exactly again for the third. Every time, it rises out of the pan, falls down in the center, and burns on top. The second time, when I used a larger pan, it still rose and collapsed in the center but the pan was large enough to hold it. It tastes okay, though.

I made this to recipe, it turned out perfect! I have never had cracking happen from not greasing the pan,(I never remember to grease the pan) but I do know if you over stir, it will crack for sure. I use my kitchenaid mixer on the lowest speed and let it stir until it is smooth. When I pour it into the pan I tap to make sure any bubbles are out.  I made fresh berry compotes to drizzle over, it was delicious!

This turned out so beautiful!!  The third cheesecake recipe I've tried and this one I will keep as a staple.  Perfect texture, very creamy, very cheesy, with just the right amount of cakey.  My batter did come out lumpy because I used fresh-out-of-the-yogurt-maker homemade sour cream, but after it's baked you can't really tell.  I used a smaller pan so I scaled all the ingredients to 2/3 of the original, used 1/2 cup truvia (2 diabetics in the family), and used seeds of a vanilla bean instead of the extract.  Those are the only changes I made.  Oh, and I also used a waterbath.  I blind baked my crust first, cooled, wrapped plastic wrap tightly around the bottom, then added 2 extra layers of aluminum foil.  No soggy crust.  My cheesecake did have a brown skin forming on top though, not sure why, but probably because the top was burning.  Next time I'll try baking with a loosely covered foil on top.  Great recipe, but probably wont turn out as well if you don't know tips & tricks or have experience.

This is the best NY cheesecake I have seem, and Joan says the best tasting. I followed directions with one change. I cooked the cheesecake in a Freling glass bottomed springform placed in a Cheesecake Moat pan the moat is a pan in the middle of a pan allowing you to surround your creation with water that can never get in your springform. The only two changes made were to cook in a water bath, using the cheesecake most to protect the cake from any leakage.

Such a great, easy, and perfect recipe! Wouldn't change a thing! I don't own a cheesecake pan so I used a regular 9x13 pan with aluminum foil lining it. This allowed me to lift the cheesecake perfectly. Love love...love!

Absolutely loved it!  My cheesecake cracked, but in the defense of the recipe it was my first ever time trying a cheesecake ever.  I believe the more i cook cheesecake ill get better with that.  But the taste is absolutely wonderful.

This recipe is very good. This is my second time making it. The first time I did exactly as described and the top turned out too dark but luckily I was topping it with strawberries and pineapple. I don't like to do the waterbath with cheesecakes and leaving it in the oven as directed it did not crack which is wonderful. Today when I made it I did tweak the directions a little, I made it with the same ingredients however, I lowered the temp to 300 and baked it for an hour and twenty mins. It turned out great. Great color and no cracks. Will definitely make again.

This came out PERFECT!! Followed recipe as is. I used waterbath as well as lined sides of pan with parchment paper. I am no stranger to making (or eating) cheesecake. I was just browsing for a new recipe saw all the reviews and thought i would give it a try and soooo glad i did!!! However i did remember after i was all done that i forgot the cornstarch!! Did not miss it!

Divine!!! With the exception of adding more butter to crust mixture and pre baking it for 10 minutes, I followed the recipe to the tee. This turned out beautifully!!! First cheesecake I've ever made. Not one crack or sinking!! I baked it for one hour then left it in the oven for the whole six hours to cool. Dont open the oven door!!!Made a fresh blackberry reduction to drizzle on top!  Complete awesomeness!!! A must try...You won't be disappointed!!

This is my go-to recipe for cheesecake. I love that the texture can be modified to be creamier by leaving out the flour or made drier and more cake-like by adding a little more flour. I change my crust recipe to a shortbread one (found on "New York cheesecake III" recipe which i also use but prefer this one with less ingredients)  its 1 1/2 Cups flour, 1/3 Cup white sugar, 1/2 unsalted butter,  and one egg. Mix the flour, sugar and butter together until butter is small crumbs then add egg and flatten into a greased springform pan. Bake for 15 mins at  400. Let cool, re-grease the pan sides and place extra long foil around the pan. Make sure the foil is covering the sides completely and then make the cheesecake. While you make the cheesecake place a large saucepan on the stove and fill with water. Bring to a boil. I place my springform pan into a large cake pan and fill the cheesecake. I put this in the oven and carefully pour the water into the surrounding cakepan. The water should come up to about 1/2 way. Then I let bake 1 to 1 1/2 hours until cheesecake is fairly firm. This is called a bain-marie (water bath). It ensures even baking and keeps the cheesecake moist. Ive never had a cheesecake crack when I do this. I take mine out of the oven, wait a few mins and pour the leftover water out. Remove the foil and pop into the fridge or freezer. This all sounds like a lot of work but its really not lol. My family, friends and co-workers beg for this cheesecake and this makes it

I use this recipe a lot. It is a lot fluffier than an average cheesecake but it tastes exactly the same. I have to make an oatmeal crust since I have a vegetable oil intolerance (probably a chemical since I can eat pressed oils) and graham crackers always have some sort of vegetable oil. It still turns out really excellent. It always cracks but I don't worry too much, its easier to top the cheesecake with fruit sauce and pretend its not there than worry about water baths and cooling times. The hardest part is keeping the boys away from it for a day to truly set.

Only a few changes to the recipe.  My family doesn't like a thick crust so I brush the sides with melted butter and dust the pan with crushed graham crackers ( about 2-3 is all you need).  Also the flavor of the cheesecake doesn't truly come out till you let it sit for atleast 24 hours (refrigerated).  Plan ahead and you won't be disappointed.

This has pretty much been my go to recipe for cheesecake for years! I sometimes use cream instead of milk and I have also tweaked for a Dulce De Leche cheese cake.  Everyone loves LOVES this recipe and it always turns out perfect!  My friend whose family is Italian said this cheesecake is very close to his moms recipe his family made.  Just take your time, don't over mix and make sure you use heavy duty foil for your water bath.  Happy cooking!

I loved this cheesecake, it was delicious, my family loved it. My cheesecake cracked a little, but i think i had mixed it a little bit too much. While transporting it to the fridge it slid off my plate and hit the ground, that was also my fault. overall great recipe, you have to love it

I don't know...with all the raves I expected it to be better than it was. It's okay, but the texture and flavor are not what I love in a NY cheesecake: it's more eggy than I prefer, and other than a strong vanilla flavor it's kind of bland. I did make sure the ingredients were at room temp, didn't overmix, and kept a pan of boiling water in the oven during baking. Disappointed, because I don't make cheesecake very often, plus all these ingredients add up moneywise! I think next time I'll try a different recipe.

Fabulous! Cheesecake was amazing!! I used 1 1/2 c graham cracker, 1/2 c sugar, 1/4 c butter and 1 tea cinnamon as suggested for crust since I wasn't sure about the 15 crackers. I didn't over mix and baked in water bath, which unfortunately leaked into pan. I did leave in oven for 3 hours after baking and no cracks! Made it for husband for Fathers Day and he loved it! Next time I'm going to try the pan of water under the cake instead of in water do to my leaking mishap.  Great recipe!

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING!!  It was my first attempt at making a cheesecake and it turned out perfect.  I did not have vanilla extract in the house (much to my dismay!) so I used Penzey's Vietnamese Cinnamon instead - just eyeballed the amount...a little goes a long way!  My fiancee and parents said it was the best cheesecake they have every had in any restaurant or anywhere else.  I agreed!  I left it in the oven with the temp off for 5 hours as the recipe said - and it did still crack a little but that was no problem at all.  Thank you for sharing this recipe - I now have confidence in my baking ability! :)

Fabulous recipe! The bottom should be baked first for no longer than 10 mins at 350, otherwise it's too soggy.  This is a great base recipe to add flavour to- I made lemon with lemon extract and grated rind from a lemon. Will make many times I am sure!

Very good recipe. I've made it already a few times and always get good reviews on it. 
I do recommend, if you're short on time, to replace the milk, sugar, and sour cream with a 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk. It still comes out with a great taste and texture but you don't have to give yourself the trouble of measuring all the ingredients. 
Oh and for extra taste you can add cinnamon powder to the cracker mix.

I have made this at least 3times now and it is truly the best cheesecake I have made. My family prefers this to any commercially made cheesecake. I have made it plain with just graham cracker crust and topped it with a blueberry sauce from this site and also made it Black Forest style with Oreo crust and cherries on top. Both so yummy!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe IS perfect. If you don't chill the cheesecake it will seem like the crust is mushy and the filling undercooked. But I reiterate all reviews that are top rated. Do not overbeat and do not overcook.

Fabulous cheesecake!  Made 100% as written no changes.  Simple and classic with the flavor and texture of a bakery/restaurant quality cake.

Baked my first cheesecake with this recipe & it received rave reviews! I did read some reviews first & made the following changes. 1.) The crust 11/2C. Graham cracker crumbs, 1/4C.melted butter, 1/2tsp cinnamon & 1/4C. sugar. 2.) Kept the filling the same with the addition of 1TBS. Almond extract. 3.) Reduced the oven temperature to 325* still baked for 1 hour & placed a 9x13 glass baking dish of water on the rack under the cheesecake. Did not open the oven until 3 hours later & stored in the fridge until the next day. No cracks & a light golden edge. Now lets see if I can do that again!

I am so impressed with how it came out! Made it for my hubby's birthday and he loved it!
I changed the crust to: 1 1/2 cups crushed graham crackers, 1/4 cup sugar, 6 tablespoons melted butter. 

I didn't have anything large enough to fit the springform pan in to do a water bath, but I did put a cake pan of hot water on the rack right under it. I don't know if it had the same effect, but it turned out perfect so I will probably do it again that way next time as well.

Easy! I didn't change any ingredients, used a wooden spoon to mix after beating the sugar and cream cheese. Did NOT use a water bath, and kept the oven door closed for an hour after baking. 
Creamy, delicious, no cracks. Kinda thick crust.

Have made this a number of times now and it is always a winner.  I sometimes take about a cup of the batter out and mix with melted chocolate for a marbled cheesecake.  Have also used neufchâtel with no ill effects.  I will never need to look for another cheesecake recipe!

I LOVE making cheesecake and this is my favorite one! DO NOT touch the oven once you put it in. I actually leave it overnight in the oven (cook later in the evening, right before bed). Turns out perfect every time with no cracks!

This cheesecake is simply wonderful. The texture is fabulous! It's sweet, but not too sweet. When serving, you can use very simple sauces such as raspberry, strawberry, chocolate, Carmel. Because the cake is so lovely, you only need a touch of sauce if desired.

I made a gluten free version of this recipe using Udis Gingerbread cookies, crumbed - rather than the graham crackers.  I also used a GF all purpouse flour.  I pressed the cookie crumbles and butter mixture into cupcake tins and poured the mixture right on top.  There weren't enough cookie crumbles for all the tins, so i poured some cheesecakes without a crust.  I baked each batch for about 17 minutes at 350 degrees, just until i saw the first signs of cracking - then i removed them from the oven and allowed them to cool.  They turned out perfect - these are amazing! Great recipe! Both the ones with the crust and no crust turned out great.  I topped them each differently with pie filling, melted chocolate, carmel, peanut butter and chocolate, and cherries. Definitley a keeper!

Well, I made the recipe exactly like it said to. The cheesecakes turned out beautifully, but the recipe itself was very...bland. It's interesting because the texture etc. turned out perfect - but it just doesn't taste right. I added everything correctly, mixed it correctly, but there's just something missing there. :( I wanted it to taste better than it did.

This cheesecake was AWESOME! I let it set for 2 hours. It cracked a little, but once I put the strawberry topping and whipped cream on top, it didn't even matter. My husband and son are in heaven. It made a nice thick cheesecake and I still had some mix left over for another smaller pie. For convenience I used a store bought graham cracker crust. I will definitely be making this again.

This cheesecake was awesome!  I made 4 mini cheesecakes using 1/2 this recipe. I baked cheesecakes in 4.5" springform pans in water bath at 300* for 42 minutes.  After turning off the oven I left the cheesecakes in the oven for an hour with the door cracked then refrigerated for about 4 hours.

This recipe is perfect as is, only explaining what I did because I looked for instructions on making mini cheesecakes in waterbath and couldn't find the info so thought I'd share what worked for me.

I've been making this cake every Christmas & 4th of July for the past 10 years, and it comes out perfect every time. You must use the water bath method so the cake won't crack and won't fall.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was eaten over pumpkin and pecan pie! This cheesecake had perfectly smooth, velvet-like texture. It did come out with a crack on top, even with a water bath, but I don't blame the recipe; that's just the nature of cheesecakes, sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.  I topped with warm cinnamon caramel apples just before serving.... awesome!  Can't wait to try again with different toppings and add-ins.  Thanks!

2019 Update: I’ve made this cheesecake numerous times and it’s truly a never-fail, often requested recipe.  Going to try a chocolate version of this. Fingers crossed.

2013 Review:  I followed the directions and it came out perfect.  Mine stayed in the oven about 3 1/2 hours after I turned it off.  And I used the water bath to keep it from cracking, double wrapped the springform pan in tinfoil as suggested.  The only two changes I would make is perhaps a tad more sugar, though my family didn't agree.  Plus I would place a piece of tin foil loosely on top of the pan about an hour after the oven was shut off to prevent further browning.  It looked great just a bit golden on the outer edges that I would have preferred not to have but that's just me being picky.  I made a strawberry sauce and served that along with hot fudge sauce and caramel sauce for topping options.  The purists ate it with nothing on top and raved!  A perfect go-to cheesecake recipe and very simple.

I made the recipe for Christmas; I wanted a classic cheesecake.  I do not love this cheesecake. I followed the changes most of the reviewers advised...2 T flour, make my own crust, etc.  I love baking,his cheesecake is fine, but not extraordinary.  I will not make it again.  I was slightly disappointed with the final outcome.

I haven't eaten this yet but the batter tasted AMAZING. I like to bake the crust a little before adding the batter and I also add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the graham crackers. I did a water bath with 3 pieces of aluminum around the pan. I turned off the oven after 60 minutes and left it in there for over an hour and not one crack on the cheesecake. Perfect!!

Wonderful cheesecake. It's a big hit.
Perfect every time even if it cracks.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving because my little sister doesn't like pie, and it was a huge hit!! We had some friends over for dessert and I think more people ate this cheesecake than any of the pies I made! It was absolutely delicious!! We always have leftover pie and cheesecake for breakfast the few days after Thanksgiving, and there was hardly any leftover cheesecake! Needless to say, my sister was not very happy about it. I substituted the graham cracker crust for an Oreo crust (I'm a chocoholic!) and everybody loved it! My only complaint was that it still cracked even though I left it in the oven for 6 hours; however I live at a high altitude so a cracking cheesecake is hard to avoid.

The cheesecake tasted very good but I followed the recipe to the T and like another reviewer also said the temp was too high and the top came out too dark.

After reading several of the bad reviews this morning, I have to chime in. This is my only cheesecake recipe. I have tried others, but I adore this one. To circumvent the "burned top" issue, I simply LIGHTLY COVERED just the top of the cheesecake for most of the baking time. I used my food processor to mix the ingredients, and it always comes out very smooth and creamy. This recipe does not crack, or sink, if you follow the directions. It's a great recipe for "dressing up" if you have a theme event to go to, like today, I'm making one for a holiday event, so I'm adding a bit of pumpkin spice to it. I did this last week, and it came out so wonderfully good!

This is AMAZING! I've made it 5 times now! I use the crust recipe on the graham cracker crumb box(+a little cinnamon and vanilla) 
Make sure cream cheese is room temp
And bake in a water bath. It will be perfect!!!

I LOVED THIS CHEESECAKE!  This was my second time making cheesecake ever, first being a Red Velvet Cheesecake several years ago(it too was awesome).  I am not so concerned with the top cracking a little as I always top mine.  I put two bread pans of broiling water on the second rack, one on each side of the oven, instead of doing the whole foil water mess.  Maybe some day I will try it.  I did add some pecans to my crust as I like that a lot!  I would not change another things... except maybe a wonderful Fresh Strawberry Topping that I made to put over it.  I made a water/sugar/cornstarch mixture and cooked until boiling, then added about a cup of chopped/mashed strawberries and cooked it a while longer. I then poured this over 2 cups of sliced strawberries - mixed it together.  I put this in a bowl next to the cake so those that wanted topping could have it!  The strawberries remain very fresh tasting and have perfect sweetness!

The recipe is awesome! I works really good and tastes even better. My only problem was with the baking time. 1 hour was too much for me (maybe because of my oven) and the Cheesecake turned a little bit dark in the edges. Anyway it was my first cheesecake ever and i couldn't be more satisfied.

After reading the reviews this was the one I chose for my first attempt at making cheesecake, and it came out perfect! It was absolutely wonderful and have made it about 3 or 4 times now. Everyone always raves about it and super-picky hubby loves it. Better than most all other recipes I've tasted. It's a winner!

I have made around 12 pies with this recipe now and have made some adjustments. 1st my bf who is a cheesecake fanatic, (I make the cakes for him) complains theres too much vanilla. I cut the vanilla in half and the masterpiece was separating the egg yolks and white. Beating the whiites till they have stiff peaks and folding it into the batter. The result was a delicious and lighter version. Best I have made yet. Oh and after adjustments it cracked like crazy, but the taste was sensational.

THIS RECIPE WAS THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT MAKING A CHEESECAKE FOR MY WIFE AND I. THE HARDEST PART WAS WAITING TO TRY IT. VERY SIMPLE RECIPE TO EXECUTE. WE FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY AND GOT FANTASTIC RESULTS. THE CHEESECAKE DID CRACK, BUT WE THINK THAT WAS DUE TO OUR OVEN TEMPERATURE BEING OFF. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Stop looking for the perfect cheesecake recipe! This is the one! I followed the recipe to a t. No substitutions or altercations. I have searched for years and now I finally found my go to cheesecake recipe. As long as you follow directions you will be fine. Make sure the cream cheese is room temp. I left it on the counter for about an hour and the eggs, sour cream, and milk for no more than 1/2 hour. This helps so much and is critical. Also a water bath is so important. It is a must!! I am looking forward to making this again with different flavors swirled in! Wow what a cheesecake!! It received rave reviews!

I've tried a few different cheesecake recipes and I like this one the best! It was easy to assemble & it baked perfectly! The cake was rich & creamy and so delicious! I baked it in a water bath pan for 1 hour, then turned off the oven & left it in the oven for another 3 hours. Took it out and refrigerated it overnight. A very impressive, beautiful cheesecake that doesn't taste dry! This is the only recipe I will ever use... everyone raves about my cheesecake! *Note: I added 1/4 cup of sugar to my graham cracker crust and a little extra melted butter. Crust came out perfect!

So this was tasted good and maybe if I get some suggestions, I can give it 5 stars. This was my first cheesecake ever, so I have nothing to go off of. My cheesecake did cook up over the top of the pan and cracked. As it cooled, it sank to the height of the pan. I did not put my springform pan in a cookie sheet or baking dish since the recipe did not state that. I even checked because I always make a pie that way. I did not watch the video first, sorry. Should I have also put water in there as well as other reviewers have written?

Also - I would pre-cook the crust for about 5 minutes or so, just to get a crunchier consistency, but that could be a personal preference thing.

Lets just say some of us take directions literally.
I mixed until smooth and ended up with a souffle. This does not fit in a 9" pan.

After watching the video I see that the demonstration batter is far from what I would define as smooth, I must assume my failure was in over mixing.

I would also point out that in the video she puts a pan under the Cheesecake. I strongly recommend the added pan.... 

Alternate crust;
1 1/2 cups Graham Crackers
1/4 cup sugar
1/3 cup melted butter.

I made this for the first time. I don't usually adjust recipes the first time I try them, but after reading the reviews, I decided to change a few things. I cut back slightly on the flour, adding about 2/3 cup instead of 3/4. I also replaced about 1/4 cup of the milk with fresh Meyer lemon juice. Finally, I made a sour cream topping, using about 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/8 cup sugar and a tsp. vanilla. I mixed this thoroughly. When the cheesecake was done, I gently spread the sour cream topping, put it back in the oven and let it sit for several hours as the recipe indicates. I served it with a fresh strawberry sauce (strawberries, water, sugar and a little cornstarch cooked on the stovetop). The result -- a delicate, creamy, perfect cheesecake.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated - using the full-fat, name brand versions of cream cheese & sour cream - and it just turned out kinda, well, bland.  The texture was fine, but the taste - eh.  I think it could've used some lemon juice - something to give it more flavor.

Every time I bring this somewhere people say it's the best cheesecake they've ever had and they want the recipe.  I make it exactly as stated other than i push the crust crumbs into the bottom and sides of the springform pan.  The only time I have had this crack on me is once I tried using the mixer on it's LOWEST speed to incorporate the eggs (thinking it would be as gentle as hand mixing). I was wrong and it cracked.  If you follow the recipe directions exactly and ALL ingredients are at room temperature before starting and you mix very gently by hand from the point you start adding eggs until the end of the directions then it shouldn't crack.

OMG!!! best. cheesecake. ever!!! Seriously, STOP right here, dont look at any more recipes. I searched for DAYS and looked at all different ingredients, and what to use and not to use and how to do things differently!  I made this recipe, but used 1/2 cup milk instead, and CHOCOLATE graham crackers for a little chocolate taste! I also used a water bath and i had the most perfect looking cheesecake you'd swear you bought it at the cheesecake factory.  I also baked my graham cracker and butter mix in the sprinform pan in the oven for 15 mins so that it wouldnt be soggy. It was PERFECT. Everyones been asking for the recipe and want me to make it for holidays :)

I made this for Thanksgiving & it was an incredible success. No one even touched the other desserts till this was gone! haha. It was a perfect creamy, smooth texture. Very rich, VERY delicious. However, instead of using 4 ounces of cream cheese, I used 6 ounces & upped the sugar by a half cup. & instead of using milk, I used heavy cream. These changes made a much better cheesecake than the first time I used this recipe. To spice up the graham cracker crust I added 1/3 cup of sugar & a tablespoon of cinnamon, plus the already recommended butter. Everything turned out excellent.

All I can say is STICK too the directions. Grease the spring form pan WELL! Do not open the oven door  during cooking. Shut the oven off at the exact time and leave in the oven for 6 hours *Do not open the oven door* Best to cook at the end of the night so it can remain in the oven for the full 7 hours undisturbed. Let set covered in the fridge for at least 2 days. I added canned cherry topping the sauce works great. Truely the best home made cheese cake I've ever made!!!

I love this recipe! It's never failed me! I use this cheesecake recipe as the base for my turtle cheesecake and it's the best! I just substitute oreo crumbs for the graham crackers and swirl melted chocolate through the cheesecake batter and top with caramel, melted chocolate, and pecans. The water bath is super important to prevent cracking, as is keeping the door completely closed for the full time. We found that the flavor actually tastes better if we allow it to sit in the fridge for a minimum of 2 days. It helps coease everything together flavorwise. You can really take some broad liberations with the recipe to achieve anything from chocolate cheesecake, raspberry swirl or whatever. It holds up well!

First of all i love traditional new york style cheesecake, this is the best recipe i have tried and i dont think i will go away from it.  That being said, ive made this recipe several times...is it just me or is this alot of batter? I can make 2 cheesecakes with the amouts given (ill admit i cheat a little and use premaid crusts).  Second, everytime i make cheesecake it ALWAYS cracks....fustrated ive done a little research...no you dont have to the water baking method.  It seems the temperature is just too high in the oven! Simple fix..adjust the oven temperature to 325 and bake for one hr...aaand voila! No crack cheesecake..hope this helps for those of you who have the cracking problem :)
p.s - just ket it bake and DONT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR! I know its tempting but dont do it! Also once its done baking let it sit in the over for a bit...and hr or so...more if you have the time...Good luck!

Amazing cheesecake! I followed the directions to a T and it came out beautifully. Creamy but not to dense, perfectly balanced flavor. My whole family loved it. It was very easy to make too! Will for sure make again.

This is a great cheesecake ...... I baked mine using the "waterbath" as I do all my cheesecakes which prevents cracking.Stuck to the original recipe.I also do not leave it in the oven for all those hours which I believe would cause some moisture loss(residual heat). I simply remove it from the oven and waterbath and place the springform pan on a wire cookie grate to bring down to room temperature.After it's cooled it goes into the fridge overnight ....done ! No offense but if your cheesecake "cracks" you either did not use a waterbath or you wayyyy over beat it.

Absolutely amazing!!! I did the fat-free version: using fat-free cream cheese, fat-free yogurt instead of sour cream, and fat-free milk, and the result was a rich and dense cake! I don't think it is a huge compromise, and it does reduce the calories.
TO AVOID CRACKING: Apply butter LIBERALLY on the sides of the pan! This way it will separate easily as it bakes. I bake in a water-bath, and start checking for doneness at 45-50 min, and then every 15 min (until it jiggles like jello in the center, but the outside is firm). I left 1 hour in the oven, then with a warm knife separate the cake from the sides, leave outside 2-3 hours, then refrigerate. My cakes never cracked so far!

I have become famous for my cheesecakes because of this recipe! :)
My tips: 
1. Understand what a New York style cheesecake is: it's denser, and less super sweet than the "no bake" styles of cheesecakes. This cake is made to be topped with whatever you like, and so it is an unparalleled blank canvas!
2. Use a water bath to prevent cracking/falling of the cake. Also, DO NOT open the oven door! Even regular cakes will fall if you open the oven door.
3. Grease the sides of the springform pan to prevent cracking
4. Do not overmix the cake. It is not meant to be light and airy (it's not frosting). I agree with Morena: only use an electric mixer to cream the cheese and sugar; after that, use a wooden spoon. Introducing too much air into the mixture will cause the cake to crack.
Try a crushed pecan crust instead of graham crackers!

Awesome recipe!  I have made many cheesecakes and this is our new favorite recipe!  I followed the cheesecake recipe exactly as written with the exception of the addition of sugar and cinnamon to the crust and I reduced the cooking temperature to 325.  The cake cooked for one hour, I then turned off the oven and let the cake sit over night. It was perfect.  No browning, cracking etc.  I did cook the cake in a water bath, used room temp ingredients and a well greased pan.  My guests raved about it!  I even had one woman pull me aside on her way out and ask me if I really made it!  Obviously it was a success!  I definitely recommend this recipe!

Wonderful recipe! It tasted delicious. This was my first time making cheesecake, and I messed a few things up. First, I didn't realize that a graham cracker was one SQUARE, not one rectangle- I crushed double the amount of crackers and didn't realize it until it was already in the pan, so I just removed half and added more butter to try to make up for the lost. Then, the cream cheese wasn't room temperature yet- it was still a little cold. This made my batter a bit lumpy. Lastly, when baking, I accidentally turned the oven off for a few minutes without realizing it, but I'm not sure this changed anything. I would reccommend avoiding these mistakes, and not even checking to see if the cake looks finished after an hour, since it doesn't get golden or look done. You can serve this with chocolate syrup on top, cherry pie filling, strawberry sauce or whatever filling you want. A delicious, moist cheesecake.

this is the second time i made this cheesecake, I used lite cream instead of milk....i also used a 10 inch pan, it was too much batter for a 9 inch pan....it was good but both times had small cracks in the top....didnt leave in oven that long after baking because it would have gotten too dark.....we like a lighter color on cheesecake......Made this cheesecake again and followed another recipe that used a pint of sour cream and 2 tbls of flour......that recipe came out very good with the extra cup of sour cream and 2 tbl. of flour.

First let me say that I love this recipe; it is divine!  With that said, I just wanted to add an interesting piece of info about this recipe.  I recently purchased a Nordic Ware springform pan, and there was a cheesecake recipe included.  I thought I would compare it to this recipe and pick one or the other to make.  To my surprise, the recipe that came with the pan is this same recipe.  The ingredients and amounts are the same, listed in the same order, and even the directions are the same, word for word.  So either Chantal must work for Nordic Ware, or Nordic Ware is copying from Allrecipes

I have been making this for more than 3 years and I always get rave reviews! I cut down on the sweetness level though. I love how rich it tastes and sooo different from those bought in cafes (which are rather cake-ish than creamcheese-ish). Mine comes out not as pretty as those served in restaurants and cafes but it TASTES WAAAY BETTER. Thank you very much Chantal! :)

I made this cheesecake yesterday after reading many reviews from other members who raved about this recipe. I did not bother with a water bath and there was no crack when I turned off the oven. However when I was letting the cake cool in the oven, cracks started to form. I guess it was because I baked it in a black springform pan and I should've lowered the temperature slightly. I should have turned off the oven when the middle part of the cheesecake is jiggly but the sides are firm.

I did exactly what the recipe called for but because  I could not get graham crackers from where I live (Malaysia), I substituted it with Digestive biscuits. 

The recipe is really good, my family and friends loved it however I did find it a little bit eggy tasting. I'll be making this again but I will add some lemon juice to give it a little tangy taste. The texture of the cheesecake is really creamy and dense. Even with the cracks, my friends and family claimed it's really good. Looks like this recipe is a keeper.

If you're looking for a cheesecake recipe that will produce a dense cake, then this is the recipe for you! I made this yesterday with some variations: 1). Instead of the graham crust, I opted for an Oreo crust. 2). I topped it off with some chocolate ganache once it was cooled.

Some tips: 1). You can't make this on the day you plan to serve it. It has to be refrigerated overnight to get the best consistency and texture. 2). If you're wondering how to tell whether a cheesecake is ready to be removed from the oven-- the center should be quite jiggly in the center. Cool the cheesecake to room temp before refrigerating. 3). Have fun! If you don't enjoy what you are doing, it will show in your product. 4). Making cheesecakes need lots of patience! 

This is a definite keeper, and I wish everyone the best of luck in their cheesecake making. Cheers!

I followed this recipe as it was written and found it to be not a sweet as the store bought NY cheesecake.  In the future I will modify it by adding more sugar.  Also, unlike many others who reviewed this cake recipe it did not crack.

Caveat: sour cream is expensive and difficult to find overseas where I am staying now so I omitted the sour cream; likewise, graham crackers practically don't exist so I substituted digestive biscuits. That being said, this recipe blew the socks off every single person I served it to... and these are picky people who usually moan and groan about the slightest shortcoming in a food! The taste and texture of this cheesecake is pretty much perfect: smooth with a bit of a cheesy bite. Honestly, I probably won't ever bother with sour cream in a cheesecake from now on. This is a tough cheesecake not to crack though, so be super careful not to over mix and make sure you have the oven temperature perfect. If you still have cracking trouble, CHEAT: use cupcake trays for mini cheesecakes, or throw a topping onto the cheesecake (although this cheesecake frankly doesn't need a topping so less is more if you go that route).

Very good cheesecake, true to the sweet dense cheese flavor I expected.  Seemse like a good base recipe that could be modified a lot of ways for variety.  Next time I will either put chocolate on the crust, or sub amaretto for vanilla.

I had to halve the graham crackers and use the 2tbsp butter, but other than that I made the recipe EXACTLY as directed and it was PERFECT! This was my first NY style cheesecake EVER & I was making it for Valentine's Day. It was amazing.

I don't know what went "wrong", I LOVE the flavor and the texture, but it doesn't really taste like cheesecake and it's not hard either, it's more like a flan. I anyways love it!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit!  My family, a traditional southern dessert-loving family, absolutely raved about how good the cheesecake was.  Excellent flavor, texture and very simple to make.  I served it with cherry and strawberry filling on the side and no one used either - everyone said it was yummy and the fruit would have ruined the taste.  The only thing I did that the recipe did not suggest was bake the cheesecake in a water bath.  It didn't crack or sink.   Thanks for sharing!

This was a fabulous cheesecake! I followed the directions, added more vanilla only because I had alot of vanilla to everything. Only question I have for others is how do you keep the top from getting so brown? but over all a very creamy cheesecake! I will diffanetly bake again! you can't go wrong with this recipe!

Another 5 star review for this delicious cheesecake! I followed the recipe exactly and had outstanding results. I did add 1/2 c of sugar and slightly more butter to the crust and it turned out yummy. I prefer a more dense cheesecake and this was perfect. It definitely looked at as good as it tasted and I was proud to serve it to my family of die-hard cheesecake fans for Christmas! Everyone loved it.  Thank you for an amazing recipe!

This recipe turned out fantastic! I used half and half instead of milk, and I added some sweetened ground cocoa to my graham crackers to make a chocolate crust. I baked it for an hour and 15 minutes and then I used a silicone spoon in the oven door so it was only cracked a little. I left it in there for 7 hours. It had a small superficial crack on top,  very minor. It didn't fall at all. It was very thick and had perfect texture. My sister and brother-in law said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had. This will be the only cheesecake recipe I use from now on.

What a fabulous recipe.  This was my first cheesecake and it’s defiantly a keeper.  For the crust, I used:  1 1 /2 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. finely chopped Unsalted nuts (walnuts, pecans), 1/4 c. melted butter, 1 tsp. cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Mix together and press into 9" spring form pan and baked for 5 minutes.  I didn't have a pan big enough to put my 9-inch spring form pan in for a water bath, so I just put it on a rack and put a pan of water underneath it. It was steamy enough to produce a perfect uncracked cake.  Highly recommend!!

I followed all instructions but it still cracked. Which wasn't too bad considering i covered it in strawberries. However the taste just wasn't worth the time for me personally.

Fabulous!  I had a group for dinner and served this for dessert.  All off the guests said it was the best cheesecake they ever had!  It was creamy and delicious!  Follow the directions and read the tips on making cheesecake.  Don't over mix! I've made it several times exactly as the recipe reads and everytime it has been perfect!

Just made my 1st cheesecake(s) & they turned out perfect! This recipe, along with the tips on this site, worked as well as everyone else says! Tastes great, looks perfect, no cracks! 

FYI- I did change a few things b/c I was intending to experiment. 

1) I used 2 store bought graham cracker piecrusts. I still had about half of the mixture left, so I quickly made the crust on this recipe, & pressed it into paper lined muffin pan. After filling 12 individual cups, there was still more left over. 

2) I used the 'alternate' water bath mentioned on reviews. I put the muffins in a casserole dish of water, but only put another dish w/ water under the 2 pies. 

3) Used a diff baking method, also found on the other reviews. I preheated the oven to 350 for about 30 mins. As soon as I put them in the oven, I lowered the temp to 250. After 1 hr, I turned the oven off. I let them stay in the oven for 6 hrs to cool. I also did not open the oven during baking or cooling, not even 1x. 

I hope this helps! I felt like I did everything wrong, but w/ room temp ingredents & not over-mixing, I was so suprised to see and taste perfect cheesecakes!

Top of the cheesecake burned and also it overflowed my pan. Next time I'm covering with foil and putting in an 11 or 12 inch pan. Good overall and very easy to make.

This is the easiest, most versatile cheesecake recipe I have ever used.  I've made the plain one dozens of times.  I've also made it mint chocolate chip and pumpkin spice.  Takes some trial and error with those adjustments but the results are always edible and sometimes they are amazing!  LOL  The only tip I want to add is, when you're baking it in a water bath, instead of wrapping the pan in tin foil, which never completely works, use a crock pot liner.  Set the pan inside the liner, folding down the edges so it doesn't touch the batter.  You'll have a perfectly dry crust every time.

This is am amazing tasting cheesecake recipe! I made 8 cheesecakes this year for Thanksgiving and this was one of them. I only made two changes because of a gluten free friend: I omitted the flour, and made the crust with gluten free corn chex cereal. I also baked it in a water bath.

It got rave reviews and I would absolutely make it again!

Who knew a cheesecake could be so easy?

With 1 recipe (12 servings) I made 2 separate cheesecakes in the store-bought graham cracker pre-made crust pans.  Same cooking time, but you will definitely have a lot of leftover batter.  

I'm definitely NOT a cheesecake fanatic.  I could generally take it or leave it, if there are other dessert options (love me some cobbler) available, but this turned out much, MUCH better than any other pre-made or restaurant cheesecake I've tried.  I'll definitely make it again!

Super easy, super delicious! Brought this to thanksgiving and was accused of it being store bought. Had family say it was the best cheesecake they've ever had and my family does not spare feelings, so I know they meant it. :). Followed the recipe exactly and added the water bath. Paired with the chocolate ganache recipe here as a topping and it was beautiful.

The only exception I made was to mix the cream cheese and sugar with a hand mixer and the rest was mixed by hand.  This is a very important step that will prevent your cake from cracking.  After the baking hour....shut the oven off AND LEAVE IT ALONE....it was turn out PERFECT!

Excellent. Easy enough for this novice that I made two on one day for the birthday crowd at my house for my son's 19th birthday. It was my first time using a spring pan too!

This cheesecake was amazing. Everyone ate it up. It did not crack and looked beautiful. I topped it with piped Cool Whip, which gave it a professional look. A must try!! I used an 8 in springform pan so I had extra batter and crumbs, which I put into greased muffin tins for miniature cheesecakes. I baked them for about 20 minutes.

This recipe probably doesn't need ANOTHER endorsement, but the other reviews were so helpful in selecting this gem that I wanted to add my voice to the chorus. My 9 yr old daughter and I, made this cheesecake as a surprise for my wife's birthday, and it was a hit. My wife begs us to make it again and again. Three cheesecakes in, and we're still turning out excellent cheesecakes. Follow the directions to a T, and USE THE HINTS IN THE "CHEESECAKE TIPS!" We bake it in a water bath, and it cooks up perfectly every time--no cracks, no sagging middle. We also crush up our own graham crackers rather than buying pre-crushed graham crackers, but that's really just because it's fun to do. :-) This is truly an excellent, restaurant-grade recipe that even a husband and a 9-year-old who barely know a TBSP from a TSP can make. Thank you, Chantal. Happy eating!

Family and friend favorite!!  Every time I make it everyone says its the best they ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly.  When I baked it I wrapped the pan in foil and placed it in water during baking.

I honestly don't understand how you can get this recipe wrong. I used it for my first cheesecake (it was cracked but still delicious, I followed the recommended baking time and didn't take in consideration the changes ) and have used it 5 or 6 times since. I cheat and use a premade crust (because I'm lazy); just half the recipe and only cook for 45 minutes, it'll turn out perfect. I haven't had cracks since reducing the baking time and I never use a water bath. My boyfriend gets SO excited when I make this cheesecake, I can only hope it turns out as well for those reading my review.

unbelievable...was very scared to make my first cheesecake for Thanksgiving, because I know how tempermental they can be...followed everyone's suggestions, and this recipe was outstanding!!!!  Hit dessert of the evening...biggest things I learned from reading the reviews was room temp ingredients, didn't overmix, and added a pan of water on the lower shelf of the oven...only could leave it in the oven for a little over two hours, but didn't crack at all!!!!!

The best cheesecake recipe I have encountered, I love this cheesecake its so easy to make and come out delicious, everyone loves it when I make it for dessert, in fact I have one in the oven right now. The only thing I changed about the recipe is that I baked the graham cracker crust for 6 minutes before pouring in the batter to get a crispier crust.

This recipe is absolutely perfect!!!! Its by far the best cheesecake I've ever had! Only problem I had was that I didnt have a springform pan so I cut the recipe exactly in half and used a 9 inch pan. Turned out lovely :)

I changed it up a little bit and added a mixed berry filling to it and then made my own hazelnut whipped cream to put on top and then sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.  It was DELICIOUS and creamy!

Let me start by saying, this is the best cheesecake mix out there. I make cheesecakes regularly and this year's Thanksgiving I decided to make this recipe just because I wanted try something different than my usual recipe...I felt like taking on some risk. Anyway, everyone was raaaving about this cheesecake (I added my personal touches of course). The taste is pretty basic if you don't spice it up a little and if you love NY cheesecake you will not put the spoon down on this one. 
I basically followed the recipe. For the crust I used: 3 tbspoons butter, graham crackers (crumbled), about 1/3 of a teaspoon ground cinnamon and about 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar (NOT confectioners). 
Melt the butter and add the cinnamon then the graham crackers and the sugar *in that order would be optimal cause you don't want the sugar melting to caramel* mix them well over low heat; when the mix looks wet enough press it down on the pan and throw it in the oven for a couple of minutes to 'dry'. 
Now, for the cake I basically added an extra tbspoon of vanilla extract and about 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest for fragrance and flavor. (you can add zest to your taste just don't over do it and your guests think you are serving them lemon custard cake. 
I served mine with homemade strawberry topping and fresh strawberries. I baked it at 360F for 1h and let in the oven 1 hour. It sets nicely and NO cracks :) Creamy perfection! HIT recipe, you won't regret making it.

Was so Delicious everyone loved it:) I made enough for 12 servings and used half in a graham cracker pie crust and the other as a top layer to a chocolate cake mix. It's definitely worth a try:)

This is one of the best cheesecakes I have ever made.  It was fairly easy, and is incredibly versatile. I did make a few changes simply for personal preference though.  I used 1tbsp of lemon extract instead of vanilla...YUM...and I used graham crumbs because that is what I had on hand.  I also followed the suggestion about the flour and didn't use any at all...just because I prefer a less "cakey" texture.  I topped it off with cherries for the traditional cherry cheesecake.  Between me and hubby half the cake is already gone!!!

I never made a baked cheesecake before, and then I tried this recipe...Oh my gosh, am I glad I did!

This is the BEST and easiest cheesecake you can make. I have made this 4 times all with great results. 

Today's cake is for my husband, 10 year anniversary! 

How I make mine: make my crust and bake it for 5 min., let cool for a few minutes, then spray the sides of the springform pan, use a hand  mixer and slowly beat creamcheese and sugar. Everything after that is really slow (not to overbeat) and the last few items, I stir in by hand. 

Bake in a water bath (springform wrapped in heavyduty foil) 1 hour at 350, turn oven off and leave in for 4-5 hours.

I'm so happy I found this recipe!

I made this into an oreo cheesecake and it turned out delicious! I simply crushed oreos in a bag with a rolling pin until I had enough to cover the bottom of a parchment paper lined 9X13 pan. I mixed about 15 crushed oreos in with the double batch of batter before pouring it in the pan. Even though this was a bigger cheesecake I followed the baking instructions on this recipe and it turned out great! Will make again and again. Thanks!

The perfect New York Style Cheesecake. Echoing others sentiments...make sure the cream cheese is at room temp and do not overbeat. I made this in a half size (4" springform) and mini muffin tins for a gathering and it turned out excellent. If you are concerned about cracking or dryness you could bake it in a water bath (roasting pan with a little water in it). I added a pinch of salt and a little 2 tsp of lemon juice to the batter for the taste I like. Will be topping it with a layer of sweetened sour cream. Enjoy! Easy and a good recipe!

Made for dinner party last evening and I was not impressed.  Taste did not have the wow factor.  Mine did crack despite following the recipes instructions to a tee.  I would definitely try the water bath technique the next time I attempt a cheesecake that other reviewers suggested.  I have had much tastier cheesecakes.  Probably will not make again.  Kind of bewildered by all the 5 star ratings??

I find this cheese cake just too wet! I have made many cheese cakes in my time, and I realy should have known better, but there were so many great reviews, I had to give it a try. It was awful, not like any cheese cake I have ever made, almost the texture of scrambled eggs. really there are so many other great cheese cake recipes out there, This is not one of them. I gave it a try (exactly as the recipe is written) I am goimg back to my good ol' stand by!

This is the bomb! This is the most fantastic cheesecake! I've made many, but I struggled to find the perfect texture. This is it. I'll never go back to the sub-par recipes. I took the advice to reduce the flour to 2 tbs because I prefer an ultra creamy texture. I avoided over beating, used a water bath, and allowed it to cool in the oven. And guess what? No cracking! For the first time ever! It's also delicious, way better than any cheesecake I've ever eaten. I like this with a gingersnap crust. My only issue was the very outer edge browned slightly. It didn't overset or become tough, just slightly golden in a couple of spots. Next time I will take the advice to lower the heat considerably and cook longer. I chalk this up to user error or a wonky oven. It's certainly not the recipe's fault. I absolutely love this!

Fanatastic.  Made this gluten free by substituting 1/4 cup flour with 1/4 cornstarch.  Substituted graham cracker crust....with 2 cups gf ginger snaps from Trader Joe's...6 Tbsp melted butter. Also, decreased fat by using low fat cream cheese/sour cream.  

Took many reviewers suggestions:  Did not overbeat; baked in hot water bath; used Bailey's Irish Cream instead of milk.. This recipe is a winner.

made this recipes many of times and sometimes it cracks sometimes it doesnt... sometimes the texture is off sometimes its great! im blaming only myself it takes practice to get a good cheesecake. ive learned as of recent to mix this in a food processor, it gets less air than if done in a mixer and it was awesome, i always grease the sides and do a water bath and that helps with the cracking, if it cracks i just decorate the top it still tastes awesome, please try this again if you fail it takes practice!

This was far less impressive than promised.  The flavor was pretty bland.  Not rich at all.  If you want a simple, run-of-the-mill cheesecake, try it.  If you want a delicious, decadent NY cheesecake, you'll be disappointed.

I can't remember if I rated/commented before. I made this for the third time this weekend. Last time I changed pans, overmixed and overcooked it.  It still tasted good but texture was wrong and it cracked. THIS time I used a hotwater bath due to uneven heating in my oven, used parchment paper for the bottom and sides, had all ingredients at room temp., and only used a mixer for creaming the sugar and cream cheese and gently mixed the rest by hand.  This was THE MOST PERFECT cheesecake I have ever had! If there is such a thing, it was too perfect.  No one believed I had made it.  Oh well. I knew and that was all that counted. Served with two toppings, a sour cherry topping and a peach topping.  Both had a hint of Amaretto and they were so good.  This is definitely my go-to recipe for cheesecake!

The non-cracking cool down did not work for me. After baking it already had a huge crack down the middle, but no worries. As long as it tasted good I wasn't concerned. I thought the crust needed more butter as it was extremely crumbly. The filling, however, was creamy and delicious! I served it with Supreme Strawberry Topping to many compliments.

I was terrified to make my first cheesecake, but I needn't have been!  This turned out PERFECT!  I can't believe I made something so pretty and so delicious!  And I didn't even have the springform pan!  I used a 2 inch tall, 9 inch cake pan instead.

I assembled the ingredients in the exact order, used the handmixer only for combining the cream cheese and sugar (about 30 seconds on the low setting), after which I gently stirred everything with a wooden spoon.  I baked it at 350 for 60 minutes as directed.  (I did place the cake pan in a deep cookie sheet and poured hot water in the cookie sheet to keep the top from cracking while cooking.)  After turning off the oven, I let sit for 6 hours without cracking the door.  

The springform pan would have made the slicing easier, but because I buttered the sides of the cake pan really well before pouring the batter in, when it cooled and pulled away from the sides, there was just exactly the right amount of space to slide a flexible cake cutter inside.  The first piece wasn't perfect in terms of its look, but all the others were!

I am so excited to know how to make such a wonderful cheesecake.  Thank you so much!

This is a yummy and thick cheese cake. As it is easy to make I enjoy this recipe. I like to add fruit topping to add to the already sweet cake.

Excellent! Mine didn't even crack. Tasted excellent. I made the supreme strawberry topping but kept a lot of the strawberries whole and put them on top with the points up then drizzled the sauce all over. So good!

I followed this recipe as listed.  
1. It rose out of the pan-made too much batter for a 9 inch springform
2. It was completely burnt around the outside, even the bottom of the crust was burnt.
3. After turning the oven off, I let it sit for two hours and then checked it and it not only fell, but all the sides cracked off and fell into the center of the cake.  
4. Once I pulled it out and peeled away a bit of the burnt pieces, it looked like a cheesecake and definitely smelled like one so I thought, Hey! Maybe it's just not so pretty.  Took a few bites in different places, all you can taste is egg.  

All in all, a horrible recipe.

This recipe was phenomenal! I did one of the different crusts suggested, with extra cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg and then used crushed maple pecans as well. I was a little too afraid of overbeating, and ended up with a lumpy batter - but the top was solid! I also should have double wrapped the pan in foil for the water bath. Some of the water got in and made a mushy crust. But I can't wait to try it again!

This recipe is wonderful as is, except I used oven temp. of 325 degrees and cooked it 15 min. longer, and I used a casserole dish of water under the cheese as water bath. The cheesecake turned out beautiful (no cracks), and tasted wonderful. Had compliments from all who ate it, and they wanted the recipe.  Actually, this was my second one in one day because on the first one, I turned the oven on broil instead of bake (by mistake of course). When I started smelling it right away I knew something was wrong, so I checked it and sure enough the selector knob was on broil instead of bake.Duh....I immediately turned it to bake and finished baking it for the remainder of 1 hour, and left it in the oven for an hour to cool(while I went to the store and bought new ingrediends). Believe it or not, it tasted pretty good after I peeled off the burned part.All in all, it is a great recipe and I will definately make it again (and cook on bake instead of broil!).

This is a great cheesecake recipe. I followed the recipe almost to the letter the first time I made it. I didn't leave it in the oven for 6 hours was the only change I made. It turned out perfect. I have since made it with minor changes and it has been a hit wherever I bring it.

I made this cheesecake using sucessful changes that others had compiled and it tasted great! My only problem was that about a 3 1/2 inch diameter circle in the middle came out a bit thinner in consistency, like maybe the inside didnt cook as well as the outside. Because the outter portion was perfectly FABULOUS! I just dont know why the inside didnt cook as well. Anyone know why? I baked for exactly one hour, NO CRACKS (my secret was to lightly greese the edges of the pan with vegetable shortening) and let cool in oven for 3 hours and then 3 more hours on the counter. We still ate it all up anyways :-)

OK so the flavor and texture of this cheese cake is amazing... I did exactly as the recipe said but mine still cracked. I dont know what hapened there. Also, my crust just crumbled and I think it's because I used 30 graham crackers because I didnt break them in half... once again I'm not sure. All in all I will be making this recipe again just witha few adjustments.

This always turns out perfectly for me. It tastes delicious and is my go-to New York  cheesecake recipe. I follow the recipe exactly (ingredient and prep wise). The only change I make is the actual cooking instructions. I always bake my cheesecakes in a water bath and have only had one to crack (to the point I refused to present it to people outside my family) one time, and even then the taste was still perfect. I usually top it with fresh strawberries and the “Supreme Strawberry Topping” recipe I found on here as well and some sweetened whipped cream (the real stuff, not whipped topping).

This recipe is ridiculously good! The only thing I did differently was adding only 2 tablespoons of flour, otherwise followed it to the letter. I baked it for an hour, shut the oven off and left it in for 8 hours. Perfect, perfect restaurant quality cheesecake.

I made this recipe using heavy cream instead of milk (I didn't have any) and I left out the flour.  I haven't tasted it yet but it baked up beautifully with no cracks or anything,.  I used splenda instead of sugar and swirled in sugar free strawberry topping.

This cheesecake was phenomenal!  Everybody raved about it.  I took the advise of many and used room temp ingredients, used a water bath and left the cheesecake in the oven for six hours.  It didn't crack and tasted delicious!  I also baked it at 325 degrees.  For the crust I added cinnamon and sugar which made it very tasty.  I will make this over and over again for sure!

I make this cheesecake all the time, tweaking it depending on the flavor that is requested. I have discovered that baking it at 325 degrees and using a bain marie (water bath) results in a cake that doesn't crack as much as when baked at 350 degrees. I also place a wooden spoon in the door during the time it cools in order to slowly circulate air in the oven.

It wasn't until I shut the oven off that I realized I'd forgotten the flour. I freaked out a bit, but took solace in another review that said they had forgotten it too and it still turned out great. I have never put flour in a cheesecake!
That being said, I've made better, I've made worse. This is middle of the road for me.

I can't give it 5 stars because the crust was soggy--wet and soggy!  The rest turned out great, but definitely needs a different crust.

A simple, perfect cheesecake.

My daughter wanted cheesecake for her birthday, so I tried this recipe and it was incredible. I made it exactly according to the directions, allowed cream cheese to soften to room temperature and was careful not to overmix everything. No cracks and perfect density. We enjoyed every bite and I'll definitely make it again.  Thank you!

This is an amazing cheesecake recipe. I used a 9 inch springform pan and I needed more graham crackers than the recipe calls for. It's soo important that the ingredients are at ROOM TEMPERATURE so that you end up with a smooth and creamy cheesecake and not a lumpy one. I used an oven bag to keep the water from getting into the pan as I cooked in a bain de marie. LEAVE IT IN THE OVEN! I cannot stress this enough. After one hour just turn the oven off and leave it in there for a few hours. I made an amazing ganache that I poured on top when the cheesecake was cold.

Nutella Ganache: 1 cup of heavy cream, 1 cup of nutella, 1/3 cup of semisweet chocolate chips, 1 tablespoon of dark rum. Heat in a saucepan and then cool.

This recipe really doesn't need another review, but I have to agree with the other reviewers.  This is a wonderful cheesecake recipe.  I made this for Easter lunch and everyone raved about it.  Very creamy and not too sweet. Mine did have a small crack in it :-(.

This was good. Not knock your socks off good, but very good. I might try a few different flavors in it to take it up a notch. This was my first time actually baking a cheesecake. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of only letting it sit in the oven for 2 hours- then it went into the fridge. I sprayed the pan and had no trouble with it sticking at all. The ladies at work enjoyed it. I served it with cherry pie filling.

I made this using the crust recipe by SCIOTA. I don't know what happened, but using that crust recipe with my 9" springform pan made the cheesecake puff up WAY above the pan. I'm glad I wasn't planning on serving this cake plain, or it would have been ruined. I haven't had a chance to taste it yet, but I am very disappointed in the aesthetics of the cake.

In the future, I will only use about 1/2-3/4 of the cheesecake mixture.

This is absolutely the best cheecake recipe I have ever made.  I was unsure about the flour as I've never used flour in cheescake but you can't even taste it.  It's fantastic!  My hubby just returned from a deployment & he looooved it!

This was the first time I have made a New York style cheesecake and it turned out perfect! I surprised my fiance with this for his birthday. Cheesecake is his FAVORITE and he said we wouldn't ever buy a store bought one again.

Made for my parents get together. Very nice cheesecake recipe. Only difference I did was do half milk & half fat free french vanilla creamer. Also I did a waterbath. No cracks, no troubles. Delish cheesecake!

This is excellet! ...Though I must admit I changed the dickens out of this receipe, just to make it as low cal / carb as possible ^____^ Okay: didn't use the crust, I used Tnuva fat free soft cheese instead of cream cheese, left out the milk, splenda instead of sugar, egg substitute, low fat sour cream and 2 tbs corn starch instead of flour.  It is admittedly not the kind of thing you'd use as an indulgence, but at 90 cals a serving it allows for a tasty snack that feels indulgent, even when you're dieting!

Totally worth the time!  I was searching for a New York Cheesecake recipe to surprise my Valentine and stumbled upon this recipe.  I started by greasing the sides and bottom of my springform pan and made the crust with 1 1/2 c of graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 c of crushed almonds, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 egg white (as recommended by another review.)  I mixed only the cream cheese and sugar with the mixer, and the rest of the ingredients by hand, and cut back on the flour to 2 Tablespoons for a more dense cake. I double wrapped the pan in aluminum foil before filling the water bath with boiling water from the teapot.  We could not wait the 5-6 hours until removing from the oven, but did give it a good 2 1/2 to cool and from there into the fridge.  It was picture perfect without cracks or lumps. Absolutely decadent.  I made us an optional topping on the stove with raspberry preserves, lemon juice, and a small amount of balsalmic vinegar to intensify the flavors, and thickened with a small amount of cornstarch...was good, but I preferred it plain.  You won't be disappointed!

Terrible directions, the temperature is way to high I'm glad I didn't follow the advice of others on here because if I hadn't looked in the oven after 60minutes and just turned the oven off and left the cheesecake it there it would have been completely burnt. I made this recipe last night for dinner today and now I'm going to have to go buy a cheesecake because this one is ruined. What a waste of money. The crust is burnt and the top of the cheesecake is also burnt. I will not be making this again

I know squat about making cheescakes, but had the hankering for one so I followed this recipe to the letter and it almost turned out perfect. Some cracking occurred. I decided to make more for xmas gifts and hand mixed the eggs and the next few cheesecakes turned out perfect. My neighbor said it was the best cheesecake he had in his life. I agree.  Three things are important! ...hand mixing the eggs at the end, bake on a small rack above a pan of water and letting it cool in the oven are key!!  Cooking above a pan of water keeps humidity and prevents cracking. Thank you.

Very good and easy to make.  Be sure you have time to leave it in the oven and then to chill too.  Mine cracked, but tasted delicious.  I discovered that 15 graham crackers meant 15 half sheets of graham crackers.

This here is real cheesecake, thick and rich and delish!  I have made FIVE for my "ahem" family thus far and I only came across the recipe this Christmas!  Thank you Chantel where ever you are!  I now slice this into cubes, roll them in the graham cracker crust and then put em in the freezer-bite sized treats for me all year!

Very good recipe.  I used 2 regular and 2 low fat packages cream cheese and Whey Low as a substitute for the sugar.  I also just followed the recipe on the Graham Cracker Crumbs box for the crust again using Whey Low instead of sugar.  I cooked down some frozen strawberries with a little sugar and vanilla for the topping which really set this off.  I took the advice of others and hand beat the cheesecake filling, but I think next time I will use my Kitchen Aid mixer set to 'stir' as the hand beating didn't seem to get this smooth enough.  I will definitely make this again!

This is my go to cheesecake recipe! I love it!!! My twist on it is that along with the vanilla extract I put some almond extract which gives it an ice cream flavor. Also when I'm being lazy I use already made graham cracker crust which is fine but its not as good as making the crust. For those who experience the cracking, I usually just make some type of garnish and cover it up( Fruits, mint leaves, candied nuts, etc). Problem easily solved!

I followed this recipe exactly and followed all the cheesecake tips on this site- I used a water bath, I used room temp ingredients, I did not overbeat, and I set the timer to 60 minutes and then turned the oven off and left it sit in the oven for an additional six hours, but my cheesecake cracked horribly in the middle, just the same as past cheesecakes that I made without doing those things.  The cake still tasted fine, but I doubt I will make another.

I followed the recipe to a T.  I was hesitant about the crust, it seemed really thick on the bottom and very crumbly. It WAS! I used a wooden spoon after mixing the cream cheese and sugar to insure not over mixing, I also sprayed the spring form pan with cooking spray to insure no cracking, but it cracked, BIG TIME! It was also burned by the time I took it out and dry!!!!  I will not make this again... Sorry.

Ok so this was my 1st time ever making cheesecake and let me tell you it came out awesome! I made it for christmas and everyone went crazy for it. I did the recipe exactly, however I did do a water bath which was very simple and after baking it for an hour at 350 degrees i shut oven off and left it in oven over night. I refrigerated in the morning, not a single crack in it. I also made sure all the ingredients were at room temp before starting. Def making again soonn!!

This cheesecake is the absolute best. My husband is a huge cheesecake fan, so I made it for his birthday. It was by far the best I have ever made. The flavor is just right, not too sweetmlike most recipes. I a making the same for Christmas with an added pumpkin swirl. Thank you so much for this.

OK, FOLLOW RECIPE EXACTLY AND YOU CANT GO WRONG. IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS. I HAVE MADE IT TWICE AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LEAVING IT IN THE OVEN LIKE SHE STATED. I DIDNT ON MY SEC ONE AND IT CRACKED. IT'S CREAMY, JUST LIKE NY OR CHEESECAKE FACTORY. I ALSO HIGHLY HIGHTLY RECOMMEND THE WATER BATH. AGAIN, FOLLLOW THIS RECIPE TO A TEE AND YOU WONT BE SORRY....

This is such a simple recipe but results are INCREDIBLE!  It is now my father-in-law's favorite dessert.  Every one who has had it has commented it is the best cheesecake they have ever had.    If you have not tried this recipe, you need to try it!

VERY TASTY! I halved the recipe and made it in a prepared graham cracker crust, cooked for 45 min, my leftover batter was just enough to fill a greased mini-muffin tin, cooked 30 min - everything came out great!

Absolutely delicious.  I followed one simple recipe for many years and when I lost it I hunted and hunted for another...  Came to this recipe and decided what the heck and now I won't use another.  Thank you.

Great recipe ! i have never baked a cheesecake or even watched some1 do it ,and it turned out great .  here is summary of important advices : 1-all you ingredients must be at room temp.(V.Imp) 2-A water bath is the best approach so it wont be dry. 3-if white lumps are stil visible after mixing  just use a filter to remove them  4-grease the pan especially the edges. 5-when it is done cooking after one hour pass a 6-knife between the edges of the cake and pan. 7-instead of 1/4 cup of flour use 2tbs gives it a very creamy texture. 8-Add cinnamon ,and nutmeg 1/2 small spoon to the crust. dnt check on while it is baking,and hopfully it will turn out great !

I've made this cheesecake twice and it is amazing!  The only changes I made were of a personal preference...i added about a 1/4 C of sugar to the graham cracker crumbs.  Also, the second time around I made a chocolate marble cheesecake.  My family of 4 polished them off w/i 24 hours...lol.    Also, let me say that if you follow the recipe and use the water bath, let the cheesecake cool the full 5-6 hours and then refridgerate...there should be no cracks.  If you follow the recipe, you'll end up with a perfect cheesecake.  If you don't end up with a perfect result....YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG!!!  Don't blame the recipe and give it a poor rating, if you don't use the water bath or altar the recipe drastically.  It's unfair to blame the recipe writer because you can't follow simple directions.    Thanks Chantal for a truly amazing cheesecake recipe.

I want to start off by saying that when I made this recipe I was living in the United Kingdom so had to use Digestive biscuits instead of the crackers. I have now emigrated to California and will definately be making this again - hopefully this weekend.  Anyhow - The first time I made it  I decided to substitute half of the cheese for a low fat option and followed the directly to the t but I just don't know what went wrong, maybe combination of the cheese and overbeating..? But it just didn't seem to be cooking  for some time and once it was done it tasted a bit like feet, had a hint of cheesecake flavour but it just was not good. But it didn't put me off and I attempted a second one - only I used all full fat Philadelphia. That one came out perfect! No cracking and really did taste amazing. I put half of it in an air tight container and froze it (it keeps very well) and kept the other half in the fridge and it seemed to taste even better the following day! I put it down to the flavours coming through. This really is a great recipe and one I will use again and again.

Best cheesecake ever...perfect texture.  The only change I made was...I added just a tad of sugar to the crust and pressed it into the bottom and slightly up the sides of the pan.  This is my cheesecake recipe from now on.

First time i ever made cheesecake not from a box mix.. Loved it and so did my boyfriend... I took a 1/2 a bag of frozen strawberries let them defrost then mixed them with my blender and a little sugar added the them on top.. EXCELLENT!!! Going to make for a Thanksgiving treat to take to my fathers house.

Excellent Cheesecake.  After reading reviews, I went ahead and adjusted the butter to 1/4 cup. Crust just seemed to need more moisture. Used my Kitchen Aid mixer, but was careful not to overmix. A few of my kids complained that they liked my other cheesecake better. This one wasn't settling well... But there were no complaints with the leftovers!  Only left in oven for 2 hours, and then in the fridge for 1 hour--no time for longer. Was even better the next day after the additional fridge time. Served with a huckleberry syrup I mixed together.  Yum!

Absolutely perfect!  A purist's cheesecake, indeed.  I didn't find one problem with this recipe.  I made it as is, and voila - creamy, smooth, EASY, real (NOT no bake!) cheesecake.  You won't be let down by this one!

Best cheesecake I've ever made.  Though, I don't make it often, as my husband and I can polish it off in two days!  Best of all, no water bath needed!  Although, I have had some large cracks, but I don't care!  It tastes great and that's all that really matters to me!

This was my first cheese cake and it was incredibly easy to make. The flavor, the texture, the color everything was superb. Even though I skipped the water bath test suggested by alot of people, my cake came out crack less.. I baked it for one hour and let it sit in the oven for 3 hours untouched,lets face it who has 5 hours?? Do NOT over mix it and you're good to go. My family devoured it.. Great recipe!

YUMMY CHEESECAKE, BETTER THAN CHEESE CAKE FACTORY!!!! Followed Review Caranicole154 suggestion dated 8/19/10 on cutting the cooking time. Cooked at 375F for 30min reduced to 250 for about 45-90 min and let sit in oven off for 1 hour and move to fridge. See her review for more detail. MADE FOR DINNER PARTY AND EVERYONE LOVED IT.

This makes my mom moan with every bite and makes me envious becuase I'm lactose intolerant and can't taste 'this little piece of heaven'. I made this for guests who were staying for us and the thing bareley lasted the night not to mention the morning after. I 3/4'd the recipe but it was still huge and when I was baking it (since it was my first cheesecake) I was like a snarling lioness camping out in front of the oven and checking it every 10 minutes.   I did everything water bath, ect. but it still had 1 unperfect crack which I covered with blueberry sauce and strawberry slices.   I used chocolate gramcrackers for the crust and added a cup of chocolate chips for that extra Kick. Perfect for the occasion, a real crowd pleaser.

Look NO more for a perfect cheesecake. This is it! Extremely dense, like a great one should be. Great flavor, great texture. Thank you Chantal!! UPDATE: Have made this one several times now...this is cheesecake perfection! If you do get cracks, cover them up with garnishes and decorating.

I always use this cheesecake recipe.  I use the store bought crust so my cakes may be thinner, because this recipe makes two cake for me.  They always turn out delicious.

Very creamy & delicious!. I buttered the bottom and sides (no cracks & easy to remove).  I used all of the tips that laurelc43 suggested on her review. My water bath though was a pan of water on rack under cheesecake as per another review. (no mess and no foil). Made the Philly oreo cookie crust & topped it with the Chocolate Ganache ( this website) Everyone loved it!

This is THE New York cheese cake recipe.  I have gotten rid of all the others.  It has a nice dense but creamy texture, not fluffy like Philly style.  And when prepared as directed here…perfection!  Everyone needs to try this once and decide for themselves.

This was such a great recipe!  I was worried that it was going to have a more cake-like substance after an hour of cooling, but after leaving it in the fridge overnight, it became the dense cheesecake I enjoy.  The only problem I had was the water bath.  Even after using aluminum foil that others suggested, water still seeped in.  Any other suggestions on how to keep the water out?

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake - and it turned out amazing!! I am so excited! I followed a few tips by other reviewers (placed a pan of water on the rack underneath the cheesecake as the water bath, used a graham/butter/sugar crust and hand mixed all ingredients after the cream cheese and sugar).  This turned out great - no cracking.  It got a little brown on top so next time I might cut the time down just a touch, but it didn't change the taste so it probably doesn't matter.  Very easy recipe - I'm not a cook by all means so if I can make this then anyone can.

Tried this recipe this week and loved it.  My husband said it was the best one I have ever made.  It turned out creamy and did NOT crack!  I was so happy since I was making it for a baby shower.  I did follow the advice of several other reviews.  I reduced the flour to 3 T, did a different crust (1 1/2 c graham crack crumbs, 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 sugar) and reduced cooking temp to 325.  I probably could of cooked it an additional 5 minutes and still been good.  I left it in the oven for 2 hours after baking.  I am not sure what caused it not to crack but from now on when I make my cheesecakes I will mix by hand all ingredients after beating the cream cheese and sugar together and grease my springform pan.  Seriously have to agree with others on this recipe.  FABULOUS and will def make it again@

The flavor and texture of this cheesecake is amazing! You will need to  add more butter to the graham crackers and I baked the crust for 15 min before baking with the filling, otherwise this is a really great recipe I will be using again!

I gave this recipe to a friend to make for a Valentine's dinner at church. She had never made a cheesecake before and was nervous. It came out perfect, better than the cheesecakes that I make. Now I am making it for my family for Easter. The only difference--so a water bath won't ruin your crust, I always use a pan of hot water on the shelf below my cheesecake rather than putting the chessecake pan into a water bath.

Wow . . . I'd give this six stars if I could!   I have made many cheesecakes, several of which i thought were quite good.  But this one is amazing - great taste, incredible texture.  I will never make any cheesecake other than this one!

Its for sure a labor of love, but I followed this pretty much exactly and it turned out great.. once the hour is up just turn the over off.. no peeking and also if you have greased your spring form pan, you shouldn't have to run a knife along the sides... I greased well but then opened the oven after the time was up to run the knife and realized fast that all i was doing was messing things up, it was already pulling away from the sides fine.. So just leave it alone.. So good. I also followed what others suggested with the berry sauce.

This came out awful for me! :'( I used 2 pre-made graham cracker pie shells and still had extra. After cooking they were extremely cracked and thin, the graham cracker crust was hard and nasty. We used the mixer to put together all the ingredients and think we may have over mixed, also probably wasn't a good idea to use a mixer on the egg. :( I am giving this 4 stars because I am pretty sure the mixing was the problem.

Wow, thank you for helping me make an awesome cheesecake!  This was the first one I have ever made, and it set perfectly without cracks.  I doubled the crust so I would lots for the sides as well (used 1 1 1/2 cups crumbs, 1/4 cup butter, and 1/4 cup sugar for each batch of crust, as suggested by other reviewers).  I greased the whole pan really well, used room temperature ingredients, tried to minimize mixing time, and used a water bath.  I didn't have time to let it sit in the oven for 6 hours, but 1 1/2 hours worked well, and after sitting in the fridge overnight, this is the best cheesecake ever!!

This is a very good cheesecake, and easy to make.  My husband, who is not a dessert eater, loved it.  I used the water bath method of cooking it and it came out very light and creamy.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I have made MANY cheesecakes and this one was a total flop for me. The cake came up over the edges and flopped onto the bottom of the oven. Yes, I used a 9 in pan.  And yes, I mixed the eggs in by hand. I had a HUGE mess! Sorry, but I am going to stick to the Classic Philly recipe.

Absolutely perfect as written!!  It doesn't get better than this.  I did make sure to grease the sides of the springform pan, and put a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake, but otherwise made as written.  No cracks, perfect texture... this is THE recipe I've been searching for!

An excellent recipe that delivers what it promises:  professional-level dense New York cheesecake.  I was concerned about the crust--it seemed so simple--but it also worked well, adding a bit of a counter-balance to the sweetness of the filling.  One quibble:  I threw in the sour cream, vanilla and flour all together and the flour clumped a little with vanilla, marring an otherwise perfect cake (I covered it with blueberry sauce).  To avoid cracking, bring up the ingredients to room temperature, use an oven thermometer to ensure exact heat, put the cooking cake in a water bath and run a knife around the edge of the cake after it has baked.  Presto, perfect.  With all that said, I personally prefer a less dense and fluffy cheesecake and I was wondering if readers here can point me to a reliable recipe?  Thanks!

I've been thinking about making this cheesecake for about a month, after reading all the reviews and tips I decided to try it.  This is the first time I have ever made a cheesecake in the oven, so I was gonna make sure I did it right.  I bought the full fat cream cheese, sour cream, let it set out overnight with the eggs to bring it to room temperature.  I get up in the morning to make the cheesecake, and my eggs are missing...My husband ate them for breakfast!  I was thinking, "Do u always make it a habit to eat stuff that is just sitting around on the counter?"  Anyways, after buying more eggs and warming them in the oven.  I made the cheesecake. Left my daughter in charge of the crust, she forgot to add the sugar. We added a 1/4c of pecans to the crust mixture(YUMMY). I used almond extract instead of vanilla (my preference)  After the cheesecake had been baking for about 30 min, I realized I forgot to add the flour.  Anyways, after letting it cool down for a bit in the fridge(I couldn't wait) I tried a piece.   It is great! So creamy, not too sugary, not too sweet, just perfect. I gave some to my co-workers, they said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had.  So, at the end of the day it was a perfect cheesecake for a not-so-perfect day.

This was my first cheesecake for thanksgiving.  And oh, my gosh, it was amazing.  I used all organic ingredients and I did add a bit more butter to the crust but that was all.  I had a water bath on the rack below and let it cool for 7 hours in a closed oven.  I found those tips on allrecipes.  I'm making another one today for my sons 3rd birthday.

Nice, classic cheesecake. Mine did crack, but I didn't not bother with the water bath-- I figured that it was going to be cut up anyways :) It was smooth and creamy and I thought it was plenty sweet enough.  I was a little confused about the amount of graham crackers, I wasn't sure if it was the whole sheets or individual crackers. Obviously it was NOT the whole sheets b/c that was way too much for the crust. Will use those crumbs for a different dessert. Also, next time I would use a 10 inch springform. There was so much batter that the whole thing rose out of the pan during baking and because of this, became a little to o brown around the edges.

Wow. . . this cheesecake is amazing!  This is the first cheesecake I'd ever made and it came out perfect.  And it has come out perfect every time I've made it since.  I've made it as is and I've substituted the reduced fat cream cheese and it's fabulous every time.  It has cracked on me a couple of times, even with the door closed, but I just threw some cherry pie filling on top and you couldn't even tell.  I love this cheesecake!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Fantastic recipe didn't change the ingredients at all but i did turn them into cupcake size and baked them in a water bath for 25/30mins  and took them out the oven straight the way and let them cool on the side. They were perfect no cracks and they didn't sink and the kids and my partner thoroughly enjoyed them.. thank you for a lovely recipe.

First time cheesecake here!! I was a bit nervous after reading all the reviews on cracking and overcooking etc.  I followed the recipe and the cake was PERFECT.  Mine did not crack but I had one or two almost invisible air bubbles on the top.  I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and changed the recipe for the crust.  I used 1 and 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, and 1/4 cup sugar.   I also used a water bath and wrapped alumunium foil over to prevent water from seeping through. Since this was my first cheesecake Iwas patient enough to wait for the 6hr cooling time and it was worth the wait..simply delicious!! I can't wait to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe. AMAZING!!!!

first two times i made this it came out not so great. but i accept full responsibility for that! first time, i didn't get past prep, cause my ingredients weren't room temperature(big mistake, i got soup instead of cheesecake batter). the second time i didn't have the water bath, and i didn't grease the sides(also big mistake. it cracked BIG TIME). this last time though i had the water bath, and greased the sides(hooray!) and for good measure i put tin foil over the top just in case it decided to rise :P and it came out perfect! will be using this recipe for... um... ever?!

I'm making this cheesecake for the 3rd time in a week.  I took one to work.  Our family just LOVES it.  I read the hints on making cheesecakes and found out the importance of the water bath.  I used my springform pan and also my 13"X9" cake pan.  When I used the springform pan it raised approximately 3½" without a crack.  In the cake pan it raised about 2".  Either way it was PERFECT~!  I used my 18qt. NESCO  oven to bake it in instead of my oven.  I placed a towel over the nesco to keep the heat in it better.  After the hour I turned it off and let it cool for about an hour before putting in the refrigerator.  I never had one crack and we enjoyed it without any toppings of any kind.  I just asked my 14 yo daughter what she'd rate the cake, I asked a 5, which is the best, she said, NO, Mom a 6.  LOL

Doesn't even taste like a cheese-cake.. Not to mention it was to eggy, there wasn't enough butter to mix all the crust, it was more like a sponge cake with no flavor and the fact it burned even before it cooked!!! I agree with the person who said they will never make it again!

This is an awesome recipe.  If you like the classic, rich, "plain" cheesecake, this recipe is for you.  Don't change ANYTHING!!  Follow the recipe to the letter.  I've made this many times and it comes out perfect every time.  I bake mine in a hot water bath and I follow directions and no matter what---don't open the oven door for 5 hours.  It has never fallen and looks and tastes delicious!!

I followed the recipe completely and left the cake in the oven for 5-6 without opening the door but it still cracked. I had also greased the sides of the pan and even put a dish with hot water on the lower shelf of the oven. Is there anything else that I could have done?   Other than that, the cheesecake WAS THE BEST CHEESECAKE THAT I HAVE EVER TASTED! So creamy! The crust was a bit too thick for me though so I might try it with just 12 crackers next time.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

i don't know how this tastes, because it's still sitting in the oven, but it raised above the pan and looks like a muffin top! it looks terrible. it absolutely DOES NOT look like the picture and i followed the recipe EXACTLY. i don't know what the heck happened. i am so disappointed because it's christmas eve and i'm supposed to take this tonight!

I just made this yesterday! I was so happy of how it turned out to be-- It was very tastey, not too sweet, not too plain- it was just perfect. Instead of making one whole cheesecake, i made mini cheesecakes instead with strawberry and whip toppings! I will be baking more for this christmas for sure!

Tastes great and looks great once you take precautions to prevent cracking. I followed it exactly, but as others said, it's important not to overbeat the ingredients and use them at room temperature! Only problem I found was that it was way too much for my 9 inch springform.

this was my first cheesecake ever and it was a HUGE hit. the only thing i still wonder is whether or not to COVER the cake when baking..i didn't but as mentioned below i followed the cooking instructions to a T and mine had a light brown top layer.  i cooked the graham wafer crust for 7 min at 375 and cooled it as the receipe didn't mention what to do here and the wafer box had those instructions.    I used the boiling water bath for the cooking that other people suggested and then removed the bath when i turned off the oven at the 1 hour mark and ran a knife around outside of the cake and then immediately returned the cake into the cooling oven and left the oven door closed for 4 hours while it cooled.    i used only 2 tbsp of flour as others had suggested instead of 1/2c the receipe says.  i used a raspberry/ blackberry sauce made with about 2-3 cups of the berries heated and then strained from seeds and then put back on the oven top with about 1/2-3/4 c flour until deep colour and thickened. Cooled sauce before decorating.   i wasn't sure whether to knife away the top layer of the cake as mine was a light brown not white as in the photos, but the deep red sauce covered up the cake nicely. then to decorate, i used toasted coconut around the edges as well as the first inch of the crust's edge with some fresh kiwi fruit and it looked great.   i took it to a party and it was 100% worth the 5 stars!!!! everyone including myself thought it was DElicious!!!!

This is the perfect cheesecake recipe and I have made it many many times!  My neighbor requests a cheesecake from me a couple times a year, and my daughter just called me for this recipe this morning as her husband requested it for Christmas Day! It is so good that a topping, although tasty, is unnecessary! I spray the bottom and sides of the pan, and I place a pan of water in the oven, but I do not put the cheesecake into the pan of water.  I also run a knife around the sides of the pan before removing it, as spraying helps, but it still may stick a little.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe as written, and it comes out perfectly every time!  I agree with another reviewer, if it doesn't work for you, it is definitely not the recipe, it is something you have done wrong!

Very good flavor and texture.  I was making the juniors cheesecake for years but thought I'd change it up.  This one is a lot easier.  Crust wasn't that good, maybe it got wet from the water bath.(I know the recipe didn't call for one but I never made a cheesecake without one) Next time I will definitely buy the larger foil to wrap the pan.  Will definitely be making again.

Something is amiss...  Followed directions, everything room temp,  oven works just fine.  Problem: the recommended oven temp seems too high-my cake was too brown.  Texture was very dry and the rise was unremarkable.  Will not use this again-too time consuming and the end result was less than impressive. Waste of time and money...IMO  I will go back to my moms old fashioned new york cheesecake

This is a very good cheesecake recipe. This was my first cheesecake and came out amazingly good. My family could not believe this cake wasn't store bought. Already there are requests for the next one. The only thing i change was the crust, I used the Graham Cracker Crust 1 recipe from this site. All of my ingredients that I use was room temperature e.g milk,eggs,cream cheese and sour cream.I didn't have a big pan to do an water bath, so I boil some water put the water in a pan directly under the cheesecake and bake it for one hour, turn the oven off and did not open the oven until six hours later. The best time for me to bake this cheescake was at night, there were no temptations for me to open the oven I was sleeping : ). If you are a fan of cheesecake this is a must have recipe.

Everyone at work loved it, beware if using fan assisted oven reduce time by around 15 mins and temp by 12 degrees, I ended up with burnt top which I sliced off and managed to rescue. phew.

This is the best cheesecake ever!!! I followed Morena's suggestions regarding not over mixing the batter and it turned out PERFECT! I don't even like cheesecake (since I'm lactose Intolerant) but I actually tried a piece of it and it was worth stomach pain that came later on......

Whoa...I had no idea I could make a cheesecake this good.  :) Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  I did follow the tips of the previous posters...ingredients were room temp, I didn't over mix, and I bake in a water bath.  I also greased the pan well.  I cooled for 2 hrs in oven and then placed in fridge.  I did have 1 very small crack, but that was over looked due to the taste. ;)

This recipe was so simple to make.  Some of the take-away points from other reviews that made this better for a novice cheesecake baker included: 1) room temperature ingredients, 2) grease the pan to allow proper cooling without cracks, 3) when preparing the water bath, use an oven bag to place the pan in to prevent any type of leaks to reach the cheesecake, 4) added some cinammon and nutmeg to the crust ingredients.  This cheesecake was just wonderful.  Fluffy, moist, and perfect consistency.  I am not a good cook, but I did it!!!  And, my family ate the whole cake with nothing to spare.  Way to go!!

All I can say is, YUM. This has great texture and flavor. I did add 2T butter and 1/4 cup sugar to the crust. The suggestion to leave it in the oven to cool is key to prevent cracking.

The best cheesecake I have ever made.  The texture is so light and fluffy, but all the flavor is there!  I even used 2, 1/3 fat blocks of cream cheese.  Very easy to make and will definitely make cheesecake again.

I made this for my boss' birthday.  Used a wooden spoon after using a mixer for cream cheese and sugar.  He and his family raved about the recipe and have added it to their family cookbook, the ultimate compliment.

I messed this one up, but it still tasted better than any cheesecake I've ever made. I think I used the wrong size springform pan, because the middle of the cake was not done at all and the edges had risen above the sides of the pan too... I'll have to pay more attention to the size pan next time. I also made a strawberry sauce, found on this website, and it was great as well!

The first time I've made a cheesecake that has actually turned out! I've always been intimidated by cheesecakes until this recipe. It was amazing!! I made a dinner and dessert for my future in-laws and they were very impressed. Also my boyfriend loved it so much he couldn't stop eating it. I would recommend leaving the cheesecake in the oven after baking to allow it to cool then refrigerate over night. I will make it a day in advance as well. I topped it with chocolate ganache and my boyfriend can't wait for me to make another one.

This was very tasty! It was my first cheesecake and for the most part turned out well. It didn't crack, yay! A few mistakes I made: I didn't let the creamcheese cool completely, I got impatient and the batter was a little clumpy, although I didn't really notice clumps of cream cheese in the finished product. And, the big one, I added sour cream, vanilla, and flour all together and then stirred. Anyone who is not a beginner like me would have foreseen the problem - the vanilla clumped up in the flour in little, dark and very strong tasting vanilla clumps. I tried my best to smoosh them all, but of course couldn't. The flavor turned out ok, but the appearance was ruined. When it came out I gave it some chocolate swirls and that covered it decently. I will know for next time.

Very disappointed in this recipe. Way too dark and way too much filling for a 9" pan - it grew at least 2" out of the pan and looked like a muffin top.  After 1 1/2 hours sitting in the oven it already had 3 massive cracks in it too so I took it out.  I will not make this one again.

I have my own cheesecake recipe but I always like to try new recipes when I get a chance.  This one was just OK.  It wasn't sweet enough - maybe because of the sour cream (my recipe doesn't use sour cream).  Still, it was a decent recipe but I wouldn't make it again.

Awesome recipe.  I left out the flour as suggested and it was delicious, very moist.  My husband loves new york style cheesecake and said it was the best he ever had!  I used the bath, greased the sides of the pan with butter and the sides came away on it's own and there were no cracks.  Used really heavy duty tin foil and wrapped three times to make sure no water got in.  Used 10 inch pan as I didn't have my 9 inch pan.  Baked at 325 for 45 minutes and left in oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes more.  Then left out of oven for 1 hour, then refrigerated for two days.  Cannot rave enough about this cheesecake.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this a few weeks ago and it was DELICIOUS. Follow the recipe exactly and READ THE CHEESECAKE ARTICLE on this site...room temp ingredients and water bath are key...I will be using this recipe for years to come and can't wait to put my own twist on it with a fruit, chocolate or caramel swirl!

Ohhhhhh so good! The first time I misunderstood and used 15 whole gram crackers....way too much crumbs!  It wasn't really crust, just crumbs.  Anyway the second time, I used 7 whole crackers and 4 tbs butter- perfect!!  I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Soooo wonderfully delicious!!!

My husband is a big fan of the deli style cheesecake, but I had never attempted to make one before because of how difficult I heard they were. For our sixth wedding anniversary I decided to give it a shot. Using 'Chantal's New York Cheesecake' recipe, along with following some tips from the reviewers, my first cheesecake turned out absolutely amazing!   The changes I made to the ingredients were to cut the flour in half and to use a different crust recipe ('Graham Cracker Crust I' from this site) that included more butter, plus sugar and cinnamon. Other than that, the tips I picked up were to be careful not to overmix the batter and make sure all the ingredients were at room temperature. I also set a pan of boiling water on the rack beneath the cheesecake in the oven. The result was heavenly and my husband can't wait for me to make this again!

WOW!!!!  What else can I say about this cheesecake?  It is fabulous.  I've made it numerous times with each one getting better than the one before it.  I even made this cheesecake for my in-laws last year in Algeria.  Cream cheese is an expensive rarity there.  I substituted creme fraiche for the sour cream as that was all that is available there.  In the end, it cost near 40USD to make.  Everyone loved it though.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the directions and took a lot of advice from reviews. It tasted wonderful all except of one little thing that was my fault. Either my cream cheese was not completely room temp. or I was so worried about "over mixing" that I did not mix well enough. I had chunks of cream cheese throughout mine, lol. It did not crack at all though and did not brown at all either. I think for my first attempt at cheesecake I did an alright job and learned from my mistakes. Thanks for a great recipe! I will make another attempt at it and do it right...

Best cheesecake recipe I've ever made.  Very important to have ingredients at room temperature and do not overmix them.  I'm a water bath failure, so I fill a roasting pan with boiling water and set it on the rack below in the oven.  Perfect, no cracks, delicious and decadent.

Great recipe...turned out great. The only thing I'll do different next time is use honey graham crackers instead of cinnamon...the cinnamon took away from the cheesecake flavor

This review is based on Hubby's proclamation that it was better than Cheesecake Factory's.  I did make a few changes based on other's reviews:  added cinnamon and sugar to the crust, but next time I will add an egg white to bind it together a little better.  I only used 2T flour because I wanted a creamier cake rather and oh was it!  I used a water bath and baked at 350 for 1 hour and left in oven for about 2-3 hours before transferring to fridge.  I had a perfectly set cake by morning with no cracks.  The only other thing I will change next time is to use a cooking bag instead of double wrapped foil around my pan.  I ended up with soggy crust, but it didn't affect the taste of the cheesecake a bit.

Sugar Free Version: I used one cup of Sorbitol Powder instead of sugar. You can buy this for about $4  a pound.  I also used  one level teaspoon of : NuNaturals Brand, "White Stevia Powder".The cost varies for that product, based on the size,  but it is not expensive. If you don’t know what the natural sweetener “Stevia” is, please do a search on the internet. It is really good stuff!!! And no calories.  For the crust, I bought Vortman's brand sugarfree Shortbread cookies, put all of the cookies in a food processor, added 3 tablspoons unsalted melted butter, a dash of cinnamon, one half a teaspoon of sorbitol poweder, and 1/4 cup of unsweetned dessicated coconut, also available at Iherb.com.for about $3  a pound.  I pulsed this until it was all fine crumbs. I used that for the crust.. The cheesecake turned out  sweet, but not too sweet, and it does not have an aftertaste like a lot of artificial sweeteners have. I used a dallop of sugar free cool whip on the top of each slice. I have made many cheescakes and this one is simple and comes out perfect! The sweetener in the cookies is Maltitol,which is similar to Sorbitol and the Stevia powder is all natural, from a plant. So there is not Splenda(sucralose) and no Equal(Aspartame) sweeteners. If you like it more on the sweet side, add 1/2 cup more sorbitol powder to the cheescake batter.

I am a cheesecake fanatic. I have tasted good cheesecake and bad cheesecake, homemade and store bought. This is without a doubt THE BEST cheesecake I have ever had. My whole family LOVED it and said it was the best. It came out picture perfect and tasted amazing! I do suggest buying the ingredients at Wal-Mart or a cheep store. I probably spent a whole $10 to make this, because I shopped at Wal-Mart. Follow the directions and don't be overwhelmed when you see how full the pan is with the mixture. Don't worry it will work out and be delicious!! TRY IT!

Not giving it 5 stars, but I think it might be my mistakes so I will rate again when i try again, but i felt it was too creamy in the middle, would of wanted it to set in more & not be so jiggly in the middle... so i think it wasn't ready honestly... i will definitely try again and try to perfect this!

This cheescake deserves more than 5 stars!! everyone that had it LOVED it!!  I took some of the suggestions of others: 1.baked in a bain marie with boiling water, covered the pan well with foil. 2.Used digestive biscuits with melted butter (they have a great taste) 3. left it for 7 hours in the oven, and the one time i left it for 4 only, it didn't set properly. 4. baked in a 350 degrees oven, and it didn't brown or anything. 5. greased the pan really well!

This was my very first time I had ever made this! And it turned out PERFECTLY! Thanks to all the reviews I read that helped me greatly.Before I do a recipe here I read the reviews first to get all the tips I can and thanks to that this was the most perfect cheese cake ever! My husband Just kept remarking how wonderful it was and so did I! I did use the water bath,the foil worked,no leaks I used the large size heavy duty foil.I only used the mixer for blending the cream cheese w/the sugar,then used a woooden spoon to mix the rest.Also made sure that eggs & cream cheese were at room temp. One thing I did do that I didn't see mentioned (since I seen that bubbles in the batter was one of the reasons that would make it crack)was after I poured the batter into the pan was to gently tap the pan on the counter several times to bring up air bubbles in the batter to the surface. I had o cracking.Baked for 1 hour turned oven off- then I left in the oven 'without peeking'lol for about 2 hours.Then let it set on the counter for about 4 hours.It was set firmly and was cooled and ready to slice,my husband(& me too) couldn/t wait any longer!It was perfect. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!And thanks to all that submitted their reviews,which were so very helpful.This is a Wickedly Good recipe!Can't wait to make it for a outing and of course the holidays!

To DIE for! This is my 1st NY cheesecake and it was a complete success!!! Got heaps of praises from family members, neighbors and those who ate it. I followed everything to the dot except the crust, I used Oreo base instead as I personally love Oreo so much that I just wanna include it in ;p Well, I suppose the steaming water bath helped too. No cracks, it didn't sink. I left it in the oven without opening to check or anything. It was PERFECT when it came out! Thanks so much for this lovely recipe. Good recipe is hard to come by, this is definitely a keeper for the rest of my life!

One word. Perfect...as long as you follow the directions it will turn out. I did use a water bath and wrapped my spring form in foil then set that into an oven bag. No leaks! No cracks! Highly recommend this recipe!!

Excellent recipe.  I use chocolate graham crakers or oreo cookie shells for my crust, and I add some mini semi sweet chocolate morsels to the batter for a chocolate chip cheesecake that is the best you will ever have.  Beats any $50 or more cheesecake you will find.

I was very nrvous to try & make a cheesecake. But with this recipe it was to easy. I followed others reviews & did it excatly.After baking for an hour, I turned off my oven,{i left the cheesecake in the waterbath not really knowing if that was ok to do}went to my dock & had drinks for the next 4 hours or so,then went to the grocery store. Then I took it out.It looked beautiful & tasted even better.So like another reviwer said, its you not the recipe if it doesnt turn out great.

This was my first time making a cheesecake from scratch, and it turned out to be very tasty.  I did add some sugar to the crust, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I followed the recipe ingredients as directed but used the helpful hints from prior reviews to get perfect results!  Greasing the springform pan, creaming the cream cheese/sugar then mixing the remaining ingredients gently by hand, and baking in a water bath produced divine results.  The result has been heralded by family and co-workers alike!

Easy, creamy, delicious cheesecake...I  did add a little more butter to the graham cracker crust and I used cinnamon graham crackers.  My kids and my "super palate" husband loved it!  I liked it so much I gave some to the neighbor.  My self control button went out of whack from it's creamy goodness!

I made this cheesecake twice and both times it came out excellent.  Rave reviews all around. I also followed the tips about the water bath. I did get one crack but it closed when the cheesecake settled as it cooled.  Highly recommend.  The first time I made it I used a hand mixer.  It came out lighter than when I used a stand mixer the second time.

This is the best and easiest recipe EVER!!  It is sooo delicious, I got so many compliments.  I made two day before yesterday and currently have two in the oven now. My family kept asking for more.  I will use the recipe from now on.  Add a little chocolate,caramel or strawberries...whatever topping you desire and you will have the perfect dessert. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.

i have had this recipe for so long and i finally made it.  this recipe is delicious and my cheesecake turned out great!  i followed everything except for the baking directions on the recipe because i didn't want to wait that long.  i was careful to not overbeat and also had a water bath while baking.  i like my cheesecake with a little bit of brown edge...i got that and it didn't crack or sink...it was fabulous!  for baking method---i followed the instruction on the 'Baking Cheesecake, Step by Step' article found on this site.  i will definitely be making this again...maybe next time with some modifications that others suggested, just to see the difference.  this recipe is good and easy to make :)

I've made this cheesecake over 10 times now, and it never gets old. This is the most delicious cheesecake I've ever had/made. It's creamy, decadent, rich, full of flavor, and absolutely delicious. I always try new things with mine though, recently I've been putting about a half a tablespoon of cinnamon and a little bit of finely chopped chocolate chips. Then when I mix the batter, I pour it into the springform pan in layers (2) and I add chocolate chips. It's so good. I love this!!

I had never made a cheesecake like this before. After reading many helpful reviews by other cooks and cheesecake articles written by AR's staff, I was ready to attempt the unknown! Boy, was it worth the effort! Excellent dessert! It's important to know that your ingredients must be at room temperature so you won't have lumpy batter. Do not over beat the batter. Baking it in a water bath was helpful also. My cheesecake turned out absolutely beautiful and so tasty! My guys LOVED it! Thanks so much for the great recipe and expertise! I will be making this again especially when I need a great dessert for a wow occasion.

Excellent Recipe. I increased the recipe to 18 servings. Instead of using a 9 inch spring form pan I used a solid 10 inch by 3 inch deep cake pan. I lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper befor puting in the crust. I followed the direction exactly for preparing the filling. Once I filled my cake pan I baked the cake at 300 deg for 3 hours in a water bath. Yes it may be a long baking time but with the size of the cake and thickness it is the best way to cook it. Once the cake was done I turned the oven off and left it in for the 6 hours. Once I removed it from the oven I put it in the fridge overnight and removed it from the pan in the morning and it came out perfect. The family loved it. I topped the cheese cake with the filling from the Strawberry Pie II. I will be using these recipes again.

This is by far the "BEST" cheesecake. I followed the ingredients but I changed the baking method. I used a water bath that I put in the oven as it was preheating. Then I sat the cheesecake down in to it and baked it at the time and tempature on the recipe. It came out great no cracks and the flavor WOW! Thank you for this great recipe.

I have experimented with a lot of cheesecake recipes over the years and this was one of the best.  Very creamy, dense, and delicious.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I used my own crust recipe and made a sour cream topping.  Definite keeper.

I was a nervous wreck making this cheesecake and all for no reason!  To date it is the best recipe I've chosen from this site!  I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the flour to 2TBSP for a smoother consistency!  It was easy to put together--I had no problems with cracking at all.  Mine did brown on top though and I baked in a water bath at 350 for one hour and turned off oven and let sit for approx. 5 hours.  Next time I think I'll take the tip of one reviewer and bake at 220 for nearly 4 hours; that may reduce the chance for browning on top.  Thanks for the recipe and all the great reviewer tips!!

This has a good flavor, but it didn't seem done after an hour of baking and 3 1/2 hours resting in the oven, just as another reviewer stated, unless it is supposed to softer than normal.  I also think the graham cracker-to-butter ratio was quite a bit off, but that was easily adjustable.  UPDATE-Once the cheesecake completely cooled, it was absolutely delicious.  Sometimes it's hard to let things sit in my house, though, lol!

This cheesecake tastes awesome and no cracks. My husband asked me where I bought it, he said it was the best cheesecake he has ever had. I made this in a 8 inch springform pan over a water bath (didn't have a pan big enough to put it inside) and sprayed the pan first with PAM, only used 1/2 a cup of milk and let the ingredients get to room temperature before mixing. Also I was unsure what 15 graham crackers meant so I used 8 whole graham crackers (Honey Maid, Honey Grahams) with the 2tbsp butter and it was perfect, just keep mixing the crackers around takes a little while but 2tbsp is enough. Otherwise I made it exactly as stated. I made this around midnight and let it sit in the oven while I slept. Thank you for this recipe.

Let's just say that a recipe with 2230 people giving it a 5-star rating can't be wrong. I baked this for my son's birthday party over the weekend, and made a blueberry topping to go with it. I reduced the sugar slightly to 11/3 cup just because we had a sweet topping on this cake, but it is a wonderful cheesecake as it is.  Followed the recipe faithfully, no cracking, and texture was really good. Got compliments from friends and family. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

I LOVE this cheesecake (as does everyone else that eats it). It is sooo thick and delicious. It's like a brick of cheesecakey goodness. My only complaints are that I would like it if the top of my cheesecake got more brown (the flavor is better then) and to use 5 T. of melted butter in the crust instead of 2 T. If I use 2 T., it's wayyy too crumbly and dry. Oh, and as always, I always top the cheesecake with canned cherry pie filling and piped whipped cream. Delicious and pretty!

This is an awesome recipe! Creamy, delicious, and perfect. It was just like the ones in a deli. However, it made way too much crust. I used Honey Maid graham crackers and I only used about 7 or 8 crackers. The top of my cheesecake cracked a little but nobody minded. This recipe is definitely one to keep!

The taste was Divine!Moist,creamy,PERFECT I added r/s  blackberry jam over mine  for a little sweetness.Awesome! Thanks  a million for helping me keep hubby happy.
UPDATE: 11-13-09
I made this again and this time added 2 rows of crushed Oreo's to the batter. The family LOVED it!! They thought I bought it! I used cinnamon gram crackers for the crust. I also baked it in a cake pan, lined with cris cross foil, so I could use a water bath and not have to worry about leaking of spring form. I put a plate on the cake after it cooled in the oven for 5 hrs and just slipped the cake out and put in a cake cover.It turned out Great!! Hope you like it too:)

This was so delicious! I made one 6 in. pie and 2 dozen mini cheesecakes--yum! The mini ones took about 15 minutes to cook. I even melted some raspberry jam to swirl on top, but the plain ones were just as good.  I did have a problem with cracking for the pie, but I was in a hurry and I'm sure it was due to not cooling it slow enough.  My fault, not the recipe's.  Make sure the cream cheese isn't too cold or you'll have lumpy batter.  Next time, I'll sprinkle the flour in the batter a little by little b/c I got a few bumps.. maybe if I mix it into the sour cream first? Anyhow, I got a bunch of compliments, so I'll make this over and over (well, when I'm not counting calories =)

Ok! Let  me start by saying that this is the most delicious cheesecake I have ever tasted! And I am not just saying that because I made it, but everyone who ate it loved it! It is the first cheesecake I have ever made and to tell you the truth, I was so worried that it would be a disaster. I didn't know much prior to baking this cheese cake so I took advice from the other comments. I started by letting ALL my ingredients sit until they were room temperature.  Then I realized that I did not have an oven bag to wrap around the cake pan. So i used plastic wrap, making sure i placed it around the cake pan tightly and neat. After the plastic wrap, i wrapped it a few times with aluminum foil. I didn't use a mixer to mix my ingredients because I read that over mixing can create bubbles in the cake and cause it to crack. Since the ingredients were at room temp, it was easy to mix with a wooden spoon. I used one tablespoon less flour. I also whipped every egg separately before adding it to the batter. And i made sure to oil the sides of the cake pan. I cooked my cake in a water bath. I simply used a 9x13 baking dish and filled it half way with boiling water. Once my cake was baked, i waited 30 minutes, then took it out and removed it from the water bath, and place it back in the oven for 4 hrs. Then took it out, let it  cool completely to room temperature and placed it in the fridge. Next day, we enjoyed it!

Amazingly rich and creamy! I tried to rush mine (mistake) and it cracked, it looked great covered with strawberries though! Next time I will follow the directions more closely.

Follow the instructions and you can't miss.  This is the best Cheesecake outside of NY I've ever had!!!!! I used a water bath covering the bottom of the springfoam pan with a Reynolds turkey roasting bag.  This worked perfectly.

This cheesecake is awesome.  I've made it on several occasions and everyone loves it. I made 2 this past Thanksgiving and it was gone before I had a chance to try it myself.  I had never made cheesecake before and after trying this recipe I am sticking to it.  Before you try making it read the reviews they are very helpful.

Wonderful! Everyone loved this cheesecake, only problem I had was that it made almost 2 cheesecakes, which was really no problem , I just made more crust(out of Gingersnap cookies, FABULOUS), and put it in cupcake pan, cooked for 25 minutes) Hubby ate these very quickly. Finally found a true cheesecake recipe that has the right consistancy.Thanks!

I overmixed this and it came out to "cakey."  I will hand mix most of it next time.  Very good though.  I liked it.

I was really a little freaked out about trying this recipe. The reviews were so good that I was a little intimidated. It turned out really good. My crust was a little soggy though. It certainly wasn't because I got water in it, I wrapped my pan with two layers of aluminum foil and used a crockpot bag to keep airtight. There was no evidence of water leaking in. I followed the recipe to a tee, except I only used 2 tablespoons of flour. I was a tad bit nervous about adding the flour, it didn't mix in well and seemed to be lumpy but it turned out beautiful. No cracks at all and there was no browning. I cooked for exactly 1 hour, then turned off the oven and left it in the oven without opening for 2 hours. The texture was smooth and creamy like a true New York cheesecake. I made a strawberry sauce by cutting up a pint of fresh strawberries and 1/3 cup sugar. I cooked on medium heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. It was yummy.

Oh boy! okay I followed the directions 100% the only thing I added was a strawberry rhubarb topping (from this site) and a butter cream frosting which I dabbed all around the edges to hide the imperfections. ( you know minor cracks) It looked so professionally done I could not believe it. I am a supervisor at Costco and thanks to my bakery staff I learned how to make it look soooo goood. What a wonderful recipe lite and creamy. Next time I will use a mango glaze topping. remember don't change the recipe. Just add an incredible glaze or topping and  be creative in the end.

Its deserves ALL the five stars.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out so perfect. Used all ingredients at room temp, and let it cool in the oven as suggested, but just for about an hour. Served with Strawberry sauce, its like from a 5-star hotel! :) Thanks!!

This was great. I topped it with the Supreme Strawberry Topping from this site (VERY good). I did modify the crust to include sugar and cinnamon, and left out half of the flour, as per some other reviews. And put a pan of water on the rack below it in the oven. Otherwise, I just tried not to overmix and followed the instructions. Now I don't know if I peeked into the oven one too many times or what, but it couldn't have been cooling for more than a couple hours when it cracked like the Grand Canyon. Maybe I should've greased the sides or ran a knife around it. Oh well, I've never understood the anti-crack mania, since I'm just serving it to family here at home and it tastes just as good! The one issue I did have: the middle of the cheesecake tasted better than the outer part! It was all good, but the middle was just noticeably better -- more moist and sweet. Don't know how I could've overbaked it or anything, since I followed the instructions .... Oh well, I'll probably make it again, next time I get the cheesecake urge.

BLUE RIBBON RECIPE!!!!!  This was my first cheesecake ever, Wow, it is delicious, and so easy to make. As some reviews say, YOU CAN NOT MESS THIS UP IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS STEP BY STEP, trust me!  After reading some other reviews, I used "cinnamon-graham crackers" instead of plain graham crackers, and added some white sugar, about 1/4 cup, I also thought the crust  needed a little more butter, so I added an extra tbspn for a total of three. I sprayed the pan with "bakers joy" spray making sure I sprayed the sides, as I read some people had trouble with the cake sticking to the pan sides.  I always heard about the water bath and cheesecakes, and I had no clue as to how to "do the water bath" - nothing to it, I covered the bottom of my spring-form pan with two layers of aluminum foil and added boiling water to lasagna pan, and placed the spring-form pan right in the middle.  As the instructions say, I had it baking for exactly 60 minutes at 350 degrees. I then turned the oven off and left it in there overnigt, about 8 hours, although it says 6 hrs is enough, I went to sleep and took it out in the morning, placed it in the fridge for about 3 hours; and..... Wow!!!!  What an amzing cheesecake, no cracks, sinking, or nothing.. Thanks Chantal, and thanks to all of the reviewers for your tips!!!

This is my first ever baked cheesecake.  I noted the following:    1.  For me, it took WAY MORE than         2 tbsp. melted butter for the         crust.  I used 1 1/2 sticks.        The crust turned out perfect.        I advise everyone to be aware and        be prepared when making the crust,        in case you find you need lots         butter like I did, you'll have it         out and ready.    2.  I baked the cake an hour and         20 minutes.  Next time, I'll go        an hour and 30 minutes minimum.    3.  I used everything straight out of         the fridge, added item by item to        my food processor.  Once it was         super creamy I poured it straight        into the springform, on the crust.        PERFECT!  No bubbles, no cracks.          (I'm not sure, therefore, what the         big deal is about overmixing.) The end result was a delicious, creamy smooth cheesecake that I will make again.

OMG! I am amazed! Everyone who knows me knows my fascination with cheesecake but this has got to be the simplest and most delicious cheesecake recipe out there. The only thing I would watch for is to blend the cream cheese very well or you will get clumping.

This was a great recipe for classic cheesecake. We ate it with sliced fresh strawberries. It's fresh tasting, and displays beautifully if you are having company.

This recipe was excellent. 1) Use a water bath and wrap foil around the pan to prevent water from seeping in 2) Hand mix to prevent air bubbles 3) Use a sieve if there are lumps 4) After pouring the batter into the pan, lightly drop the pan onto the countertop a few times and air bubbles inside the batter will rise to the top, then smooth the bubbles over with a spatula.

Wow.  This was spectacular! Served it to guests as part of a birthday celebration, and it got rave reviews from everyone.  I used Graham Cracker Crust II recipe from this site--didn't bake the crust, just poured the cheesecake in.  Added the flour in w/ the sugar and room temperature cream cheese, per another suggestion.  No other changes to the recipe.  I did NOT use a water bath, didn't have a pan big enough--and the cheesecake turned out PERFECTLY...no cracks at all.  This recipe makes a marvelous, better-than-store-bought cheesecake--thanks for sharing!!

this was a great base recipe.  I did bake for an hour in a water bath.  I didn't have any cracks.  I also used lowfat cream cheese and lowfat sour cream.  For the topping I did a mixed berry compote (that I usually use for pancake topping, etc.). 1.  Bag of frozen berries (abour 14oz) 2.  Place in saucepan w/ 1 tbsp. cornstarch, 2 tablespoons butter, 3/4 c. sugar, 1 lemon juiced 3.  Bring everything to a boil and then cool it in the fridge before topping cheesecake.    Delicious!

Didn't have a springform pan, so I lined some round cake pans with foil and baked it that way. Pulled the foil up after it cooled and it slid right off. Excellent. Thank you.

excellent! i use chocolate graham crackers. be sure to wrap your foil tightly. fyi- put in your vanilla, stir, then put in your flour- if the vanilla hits the flour it will create lumps impossible to get rid of. MAKE SURE ALL THE DAIRY IS AT ROOM TEMP. otherwise you wont get the creamy texture.

I was really hopeful with this recipe and followed it exactly.  I left it in the oven for 6 hours and didn't touch it and it came out with the middle sunk in and a brown ring around the top - anybody know why this happened?  Also - no cracks until I moved the completely cooled cheesecake to the fridge.  Bummer.

Wonderful Cheescake. I have been making this recipe since I found it in 2007. I reviewed it back then but somehow it disapeared from my recipe box. It's one of my families favorite cheescakes.

This was the best cheese cake I have ever had. I added a scoop of peanut butter to the batter then chopped up a few reeses cups and put those on top. With this recipe as a base, you can really make a lot of different flavors or keep just the classic. YUUUMMMYYY!!

I've been making cheesecakes for a long time, and this recipe is absolutely the gold standard. Success with it has a lot to do with mixing the batter properly and knowing when the cake is actually finished cooking. A few tips that make a difference for me -   1.BRING ALL COLD INGREDIENTS TO ROOM TEMPERATURE - if in a hurry, you can cut the creamcheese bars in half and *carefully* nuke them for 10-15 second intervals until room temp (use a digital thermometer to check), you can also soak the cold eggs in a bowl of tepid water for a few minutes  2. DON'T OVERBEAT THE BATTER. If you find that your cakes rise way up and then collapse in the oven, it's because there's too much air in the batter from overbeating. Instead gently mix by hand and thoroughly blend(especially the eggs) the ingreients.  3. USE A WATER BATH. You will never crack another cake if you do this. Make sure to use several layers of aluminum foil around the springform pan to prevent water leakage (I prefer a solid silicone pan instead, it takes some practice to flip the cake out afterwards, but result is worth it). 4. USE A DIGITAL THERMOMETER. Poke it into the center of the cake near the end of the cooking time, when it reads 160 deg  TURN OFF THE HEAT!  Happy Cheesecaking!

This was the firts time I ever tried making Cheesecake, I knew it was an art to make it and I followed some of the tips provided by other reviewers, although mine cracked a little bit(because I forgot not to beat after you add the eggss)it was a hit, I made it for a reunion were 25 friends of my friends were and I was invited to meet them. I had no left overs and they were all asking me for the recipe. I am sure I'll make this again and I'll try to remember not to beat when adding the eggs.

I've cooked this a few times. It is really good plain or with your favorite toppings. I made it for my wife the first time for her birthday and she love it. Been making it every since. Has never cracked using the water bath. The 1/4 cup of almond, 1/4 cup of butter, 1/4 cup of sugar, and 1 1/2 cup of graham crackers that one review suggested gave the crust a really good flavor. You won't be disappointed with this recipe. To get a smooth clean cut when slicing the cheesecake, stick the knife in a glass of hot water for a few second to warm the knife. Dry off knife then slice.

For the crust, I used the amounts suggested: 1.5 crumbs, .25 c sugar, .25 c butter, melted, 1 tsp cinnamon and dash of nutmeg.  However, I don't have graham crackers where I live, so I found a nice cookie to sub but also used IKEA gingersnaps for 1/3 of the amount.  Added a really nice quiet zing.  I used the bain marie (hot water bath) method as well as greased the sides of the pan and had a perfect cheesecake in form.  It was soft and creamy inside with a firm top without a crack in sight.  It was a thing of beauty although we didn't hesitate to cut to enjoy.

As others would agree, this recipe is perfect. Why would I only give 4 stars? Well, aside from my personal preference of avoiding sour cream in cheesecake at all costs because I feel it ruins the smooth taste, I ran into a problem with the spring form pan. When using a spring form for this recipe, I learned that it was best to sit the spring form inside of a bowl-shaped sheet of aluminum foil before sitting it in a roasting pan of water. This ensures that no water finds its way into the spring form while it is resting/cooling after cooking. If water gets inside the cheesecake will get mushy. Also, using room temperature or warm water (not hot or boiling) in the roasting pan gave me the best results. I'm not a chef or food chemist so I can't tell you why, but that's how it was for me. After all of this, the end result is that my and my girlfriend's family loved it. My girlfriend's family swore it was store bought and refused to believe otherwise.

Like this recipe needs another review. Anyway this makes a lovely smooth creamy cheesecake. I think that it is very important to use room temp. cream cheese and eggs. I used my hand mixer for the cream cheese and sugar then mixed everything else by hand. Definetly use the water bath and leave in the oven for at least an hour after baking. I've made this twice so far and each time it came out without any cracks, did not sink in the middle and was very lightly brown on top.

OMG!!! I am so proud!! I made a cheesecake.  And it came out soo good.  This is my proudest baking moment!! Every step was so easy.  I would do as some one suggested and combine the flour and sugar.  I did have a few bits of clumpy flour, but that was me only issue.  It was wonderful

I made this Recipe to the exact no changes as everyone seems to do this is one of the best Homemade NewYork Style Cheese Cakes I have ever tasted and I made it and I never brag. It taste just like I bought it from a Bakery or Deli.
Now I did not make the Crust I had the Pie Crusts already so the batter was enough for two Pies so I shared one with a friend. She could not believe how wonderful this is, very thick dense New York Style. Oh Goodness I will never try another Recipe when it comes to Cheesecakes this is a Real Winner. I suggest do not change anything and why this is why people post recipes.

Delicious.  This was my first time making a cheesecake and it came out great.  I made it for Thanksgiving and I got rave reviews from my family.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I make it (and there will be a next time, for sure) I won't do anything differently.  I left it in the oven after it was done for about 2 hours and it didn't crack.  It was delicious with strawberries on top too.

I originally made this recipe for a baby shower and got rave reviews.  I had enough filling left over to make 2 more cakes after the one I made for the baby shower, so I added chocolate chips to the rest of the filling and used an Oreo crust.  HEAVEN!!!  I could eat it all day, everyday...but that wouldn't be good for my rear-end.  :D

Delicious! Mine did crack because i forgot to run a knife in a 'S' shape before baking and I didn't do a waterbath but live and learn. I did do something slightly different that I saw on Throwdown with Bobby Flay, I separated the egg yolks from the whites, incorporated the yolks in the mixture and went on in the directions, I whipped the whites into soft peaks and at the end of all the original directions I folded them in, its supposed to give a light texture, I loved the texture of this cheesecake. I also used the topping Bobby used on his cheesecake that won him that throwdown. Caramel Apple topping. Delicious! Pretty easy too, but just to warn even if a little caramel sauce gets on your clothing let it sit or use a washrag because if it touches your skin you'll have a pretty painful blister on your hands, no pun intended...lol. Anyways definitely try this recipe and the topping...perfecto!

This was my first baked cheekcake I've ever made. This recipe made me feel like a pro, (which I am NOT, by any means.) I followed the directions and baked it in a water bath. ( I used a disposable slow cooker liner under the springform pan, as one of the reviews suggested.) & Let it cool in the oven 6 hrs then refrigerated. It was perfect! I couldn't be happier. Now that I know it's this easy, I may show off this new recipe and make one for the holidays! Thanks so much!
I later shared this recipe with a colleague, so she went out and purchased a spring-form pan. The recipe on the pan label was EXACTLY this same recipe. EXACTLY! (hers turned out great too.)

This really is such an awesome cheesecake recipe! It's a simply recipe with delicious results. I too used a water bath for my cheesecake... and I ran out of foil after only wrapping the pan once. In the end, a little water seeped in the pan, making my crust a little soggy in places (totally my fault) but even then, this cheesecake is GOOD!!! I also used cinnamon graham crackers for the crust which came out fabulous. Thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake and I was very disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only good thing I can say is it didn't crack.  The taste barely resembles cheesecake.  It tastes very strongly of egg.  My boyfriend says the taste reminds him of custard but I just taste egg.

This is the PERFECT cheesecake! Sometimes cheesecake can be too rich and thick and  you really can't enjoy much of it. This is NOT the case with this one, it's so light and creamy and delicious at the same time! I kept the recipe exactly the same except I added a bit of sugar and more butter to the crust. I made sure my cream cheese was at room temp as well. I baked in a water bath at 325 degrees for an hour and 15 minutes then turned the oven off and left it in for 3 hours. I then took it out and let it get room temp on the counter, then put it in the fridge. It was absolutely perfect in color and texture with NO cracks. I made a strawberry sauce to serve with it, it was so delicious!

It has been at least 10 years since I've made a cheesecake, and I was worried about this, but I thought with so many reviews, I couldn't go wrong.

The flavor and consistency of the filling was absolutely perfect, perfect, perfect. I made a strawberry reduction with fresh strawberries and sugar to put on top.

There seemed to be something wrong with the crust---it was awfully dry. I'm not sure if the 15 graham crackers means 15 sections or 15 whole crackers. It seemed like I either needed to halve the graham crackers or double the butter.

That said, it was delicious, and I will keep it in my file and make the small change of doubling the butter in the crust.

Like one reviewer said, this is a "purist's cheesecake."  It stands alone with no topping.  I followed the tips of lining the pan with foil & cooking in a water bath.  The only alteration I made was to use a shortbread crust rather graham cracker.  Decadent!

This was WAY too eggy--tasted like flan or custard. We ended up not eating it.  Huge waste of ingredients.  I don't know if it was something I did or the recipe itself, but I won't be making ths again.  This recipe in no way tastes like New York Cheesecake.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! The first time I made it, it cracked big time but tasted fantastic.  So the second time I decided to try the water bath, which was a completely new concept to me.  But to all the skeptics - IT WORKS!  I did one and a half times the mixture and split between 2 cakes.  I also tried to have cream cheese very soft before beating and only beat until combined.  I'm going to cover with a chocolate ganache for a party.  But seeing how these are the most perfect cheesecakes I've ever made, it almost seems a shame to cover them up :-)

This cheesecake is amazing. It always comes out of the oven looking perfect. And it tastes like something you would buy at a fancy store. Bake it in a water bath at 325 degrees and you won't be disappointed.

Absolutely delicious! Very simple recipe to follow. Comes out beautifully. I didn't have any problems with cracking. I let my ingredients come to room temperature. I also used a water bath and mixed only until blended. I only had time to let it sit for 2 hours in the oven, and it still came out perfectly. HIGHLY recommended.

This is a very good NY Cheesecake recipe. Very easy to make and delivers in flavor. It really lacks nothing. I would have given it 5 stars but I feel it can be improved by putting your favorite topping on it. I did bake it wrapped in aluminum foil and submerged half way in water. After turning off the temperature I let it sit in the oven for two hours and it did not crack. It was rich without being too sweet and had a great texture. This is a NY Cheesecake recipe that I will make again and again. Thanks for posting.

So easy and yummy. 

I topped mine with blueberry pie filling ~ delicious! Could not resist eating on same day, but definitely recommend letting cheesecake cool overnight in fridge for better texture ~ allows it to set better. 

I read about the hot water bath, but also read about water leaking in, so i filled a tray with water and put it on a shelf underneath the cake ~ worked well, no cracks. 

Used the recipe for crust from other reviewers and not the one listed here. Got rave reviews for that too!

I LOVED this! I've been craving cheesecake for the last few months of my pregnancy, and decided to make one instead of buying. I'm glad I chose this recipe! I served it with fresh strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries. Mine did crack, but I didn't care, it doesn't affect the taste.

Absolutely fantastic.  This is an incredible cheesecake.  The first time I made it (my first cheesecake ever) it was just ever so slightly underdone, so the next time I left it in for an extra 5 minutes and it was PERFECT.  Can't wait to make it again and again!

This was pretty easy to make. It did not crack and was picture perfect. But I found something lacking in the taste, hence only four stars. It was nicely smooth and creamy but definitely missing something. Maybe some lemon juice????

This cheesecake is amazing!  I made a chocolate ganache for the top (simmered 3/4 cup whipping cream, removed from heat, and stirred in 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate). I also made a chocolate crust instead of graham. I had to bake my cheesecake for 70 minutes.  The finished cake was super creamy and looked professional!

This is a dense lovely cheesecake, comparable to the kind you would get in a restaurant.  Anytime I make this it is an instant hit with anyone who eats it.  The only thing I do different is grate some lemon zest into the cream cheese mixture to give the cheesecake a slight lemon undertone.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I LOVED this recipe. I am blown away!!! I did use the suggested changes in the crust- cinnamon, graham crumbs, sugar and butter, and found it to be a wonderful surprise when you got to the crust. I used all items at room temp and put it in for exactly an hour. We did take it out after two hours, and the middle was still too soft. We put it in the fridge and waited till the next day and my goodness, the wait was well worth it, in fact, we tend to think on the 3rd day it was even better!!! We cooked it at 350 in the water bath and did the two layers of foil (though water still got in there, it didn't ruin it thankfully). My mother- who is NEVER impressed, went off her diet to have more than one piece EACH night we had it!!!

Not nearly as fantastic as I was anticipating. The cheesecake had great texture and was very beautiful, but I didn't love the way that it tasted.  I didn't think it was sweet enough and the crust wasn't very good.  It did have a highly impressive appearance.

No need to look any further, this is it. Made as directed, all items room temp. Did not use a mixer, by hand to prevent cracks. crust 1 & 1/2 c graham cracker, 1/4 c melted butter and 1/2 c sugar. Bake in a water bath, 1 hour, do not open door for 6 hours. Top with supreme strawberry topping from this site, out of this world

Personally, I'm not a fan of cheesecake, so this review is based on the opinions of those that did have it.  I was unable to keep it in the oven to cool for five hours as the recipe said (I just didn't have the time) but when I brought it to a dinner party the next day, everyone loved it.  And this is coming from a group of genuine New York Italians.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this cheesecake!  It has a wonderful flavor and I only got one small crack.  ;o)  I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't have the density that I associate with NY style cheesecake.  The flavor is excellent, but it was lighter & fluffier in texture than I expected.

This is an awesome recipe that I have made many times. One tip: beat the egg whites separately before adding them to the mix. mix until medium peaks form. This makes it have a lighter and more airy texture.

I had no problems with cracking.  The thing with cheesecakes is you have to cool SLOWLY.  This was one of the easiest cheesecakes I have ever made, and it tasted phenomenal.  My only variation was extra graham cracker crust, because I love the way it tastes.

Doesn't get any better than this.  It took me a few times to perfect it but now it is requested by family as one of their favorites. Perfectly creamy, thick and not for the faint of heart! Serve with chocolate ganache, fresh fruit and/or caramel sauce and roasted pecans.

Delicious, followed as written and dumped into pre-made oversized graham cracker crust, and had extra filling, my son has been asking for another piece all day long!  First cheesecake I have ever made and definitely not my last!

It was good but not the best I've had. I followed the recipe exactly, but it cracked & tasted eggy. Maybe I beat it too long or the altitude made it crack???? I will try it again though with adjusted cooking time & maybe in water bath. Company loved it.

Fabulous cheesecake recipe.  I added a little more butter to the graham cracker crumbs, but it is the first recipe I have made that didn't crack.  It was a big hit with my husband and friends.

This is the first cake I made in 30 years.  My cake's decoration was heavily inspired by The Italian Chef, another rater.  The cake itself was fantastic - better than expected.  It tasted great even though I am not a cheesecake fan (I made it for my husband's b-day.) No tears, no lumps, no grittiness.  I followed all the tips mentioned by other rater, e.g. no overmixing, double aluminum foil + waterbath, 6-hr+ cooling off time, hot knifeblade to loosen around the edges  and to cut in slices.  In order to get the cake onto a pretty plate I placed a flat plate on top of cake (after taking the springform off) and flipped.  Then I flipped it one more time onto a pretty plate.  This was my mom's idea and it worked.  I will make this cake again!

This was my first cheese cake.  I've made it several times now.  My husband loves it so much (he's a cheese cake expert).  Everything about this recipe is perfect. DO put a water bath in the oven with it or it will for sure crack, I learned the hard way.  Even if it does crack...so what its the best cheese cake you'll ever have if you do it right.  Follow the directions and enjoy!!!!!!!!

I have never reviewed a recipe before, but feel now is the time...  I have our whole community over for dinner once a week and this has become something they've begged for!  The first time I made it, I only had one layer of foil and water seeped through, but the other times I've double-foiled and it's turned out perfect every time!  THANKS!

To get a beautiful cheesecake that is golden brown on top and does not split/crack please take the time to read the reviews.  I used a water bath (for the water bath you can just use a deep cookie sheet filled w/hot water) and let my cake cool in the oven and my cheesecake was gorgeous and tasted amazing (I added two split vanilla beans and made a vanilla bean cheesecake).  **Tip for cutting**  Use a large butcher knife and run it through some really hot water, wipe dry w/a cloth and slice slowly into the cake.  Remove the knife and run under the water again, wipe off, and repeat...this will ensure clean even cuts each time.  Enjoy!  This is a keeper for sure!

Very good recipe, tastes just like at the restaurants! I put a shallow pan of water in the rack below the cheesecake and it didn't crack at all! I put strawberries and glaze on top and it looked delicious!

This was my first attempt at real cheesecake and it was really good. The only complaint I have is the crust was really soggy. Maybe if I bake it first?? Otherwise, it had a wonderful flavor and looked very pretty.  I will definitely make again, with some alterations to the crust.

This is the first real cheesecake I have made.  I didn't use a water bath but pretty much followed the directions as written.  I think my oven cooks a little hot - so that may have caused the one problem I had.  The cheesecake sprouted a collage of cracks in the top of it!  But the taste is sensational.  This is a really really good cheesecake recipe.  I will be making again - next time I'll use a waterbath and will try stirring in rest of ingredients after blending butter and softened cream cheese together.

OH MY GOSH!!!! I have never made cheesecake before, and it came out next to perfect(all i had was wheat flour).  You really can't mess it up if you follow the instructions.  As like others, I made the crust with cinnamon and sugar, and cooked the cheese cake at 325 for 60 min in a water bath, and it never cracked.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!!!  I got a lot of compliments and made me look like i knew what i was doing in the kitchen!!

Thank you for making my fiance's first shot at cheesecake a huge success!  We made it for our Christmas party and our friends loved it.  Don't know what went wrong, but it did crack (he claims that he didn't peek, but I bet curiosity got the best of him!)  We covered the crack with a can of cherries, simmered with a bit of confectioner's sugar to make a thicker syrup, and no one was the wiser!  And the taste?  I've never had a richer cheesecake!

For our Superbowl party, in honor of the teams participating, I made New York cheesecake and New England Clam Chowder.  The Cheesecake was perfect!  I did cook it in a bath as several reviewers suggested, but I'm not sure that was necessary.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Yummy!

This is an extremely good recipe. I made it for the first time yesterday, and although I didn't follow directions exactly, the cheesecake came out with absolutely no cracks, air bubbles, indentations, or sinking. It was perfectly cooked and set.Tips for people having difficulty:

1. Be sure that EVERYTHING (cheese, milk, eggs, sour cream) is at room temperature.

2. Mix sugar and cream cheese gently on low speed just until the ingredients are blended, then stop mixing.

3. Mix everything else in BY HAND, using a large wooden spoon.

4. Use a water bath!!!!!

What I did differently from the recipe is the following: 

1. I baked it for exactly 60 minutes but at 325 degrees instead of 350.

2. Because the top was already very brown and I guessed that leaving it in the over longer would result in more browning, after 60 minutes, I took the cheesecake out of the water bath (gently) and carefully ran a knife around the pan to insure no sticking. I let the cake cool on a rack, outside the oven, for 60 minutes.

3. After letting it cool for 60 minutes, I removed it from the springform pan, put it on a covered cake plate, and put it in the refrigerator overnight.

My only criticism of the cheesecake is that despite baking it at a lower temperature, the top browned. However, after it sat in the refrigerator overnight and had set well, I took a large, sharp 12" knife and carefully shaved off the thin layer of brown. The cheesecake looks perfect, just like from the bakers.

I didnt have a springform pan, so I cut the recipe in half and poured it into an 8" round. It came out sooo good, and filled the pan perfectly. Wow, the normal recipe must make a pretty massive cheesecake! Thanks for the recipe, will be making again.

I've made this cheesecake twice now.  The first time I used yogurt instead of sour cream and halved the recipe for my smaller springform pan.  I used the waterbath and there was no cracking.

Tonight I used sour cream and didn't do the waterbath.  It's cooling in the oven right now and is cracked but I don't care about the cracking ... I'm all about the taste and can't wait to try it tomorrow :)

this was verry good. I baked it for my family and they loved it. but I used a half a cup of sugar and it turned out fine yet a bit less sweet, but it dose do some good when your cutting back on the sweets. (not too much sugar you know?)
P.S.: it is good with pie cherry's

I eliminated the flour and added lemon juice. It tasted fantastic, but it browned a lot more than other cheesecakes I've made and the browned part soes not taste good. Otherwise... great texture & taste, very easy!

Everyone loved it! I baked mine in the spring form as directed. I couldn't find a large enough pan so I didn't use a water bath and I was also pressed for time so I was only able to let it sit in the oven for 30 minutes. Amazingly, it came out PERFECT. This has got to be the easiest, best tasting cheesecake I have ever had!!!

Absolutely fantastic flavor and really easy to make. I made an Oreo cookie crust for it and it was SO good. You just need 15 cookies and 2 TBL of butter, mash it together or use a blender, then press it into the pan and about 1/4 inch up the sides of the pan. I will definitely be making this cheesecake again!!

Incredible. Loved it. Followed directions but i will have to do the water bath to a T this time. I made a mistake and it had a small crack. Still tasted delicious though.

This cheesecake is terrific! I halved the recipe and baked it for about 35 minutes at 325. I turned off the oven and left it in for about 2 hrs. I had a little bit of cracking, but no sinking which is what I was really worried about. I made a sour cream topping by using 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 sugar, and 2 tsp of vanilla. I added a little more sugar and vanilla to taste, and spread this on top of my cheesecake after I was finished baking it. As it sat in the oven, the topping harded and blended in with the cake. After I took it out of the oven, I let it cool in the fridge for several hours. It turned out great!

AMAZING!!!!  I made this for Christmas & my family was so impressed....it is truly "restaurant quality".  I followed another's tip & only left it in the oven for 2 hours to cool. The key is to put it in a water bath - it works perfect!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wow times 10. I think this is absolutely the best cheesecake. I've never made cheesecake before, and this recipe worked like a charm. I used skim milk and it still worked amazingly great. Also, I don't own a Springform pan, so I baked much of the recipe in a 9x13 pan and a pie pan. It turned out to be so much. I served the 9x13 at a NYE party, and everyone raved about how good it was. It was devoured in no time! 

Also, I was using the oven all day, so I had baked it for the hour it suggested and didn't open the oven once in case it would crack. However, I took it out immediately, let it cool and put it in the fridge. No cracking, turned out beautiful. I wish i had a picture to share.
PERFECT 10!!!

This was my first time baking cheesecake and it turned out perfect!  I also did not have time to let it cool in the oven for 5-6 hours so I baked it in a water bath for the hour recommended then turned the heat off and left in the oven for only 2 hours.  Everyone loved it!  I will be making this often:)

I've never been inclined to submit a review for a recipe before, but this is the exception.  My mother has been making a particular cheesecake for 30 years and nobody has been able to top her recipe. I've tried to out-do her with countless recipes without success. Until now.  I made this for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous.  I bought a bag of frozen mixed berries and made them into a compote by cooking, adding sugar and a bit of corn starch.  I served the berries over each slice of cheesecake and it looked as fabulous as it tasted!  I will never look any further for a cheesecake recipe.

this cheesecake cracked for me, however it was COMPLETELY my fault. this was THE best cheesecake. hands down. i served it (b/c of the crack) with a mile of cherries and there was NONE left at the end of the night. i am SURE if you follow the no brainer instructions, which it seems, i had lost myself that night, this would work out perfectly. it was so good i am making a mini one this week for christmas. i agree with others, if this does not come out terrific, its your own fault. thank you for posting this one...

This recipe is fantastic. I did the water bath and let it cool in the oven for ~3hrs,  and it didn't crack. I replaced the milk with 1/4 cup heavy cream and added 1/2 cup espresso. My husband LOVED IT.

oh my gosh! i did it. made this and it didn't crack and it tasted great. word to the wise - followed tips water bath / do not open door / cinnamon sugar to crust/ but started cooking at 325 degrees and almost failed- after 50 minutes my cake was doing nothing- so i kicked it up to 350 and let it go about 40 more minutes until it had risen and browned nicely on top/ let it sit in oven for about 5 hours and chilled overnight.  served with strawberry topping/ it was great. might tweak a little next time- lemon zest with blueberry topping maybe.  great recipe

I would not make this again.  I am shocked at the rave reviews.  The high rating is why I tried it.  It looked too brown as one poster said and it was too flour-y.  It also cracked horribly.  The crust needs more butter.  I would say this cheesecake is worse than the boxed "no-bake" cheesecake.  Try a recipe with no flour or sour cream like the cranberry cheesecake on this site--it is really to die for!  Happy Holidays:-)

Wow wow wow! This was PERFECT cheesecake! This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake, and it couldn't have been better!  I used the advice of others and modified the crust a bit by adding 1/2 cup of sugar to it.  Maybe next time I'll add the cinnamon and nutmeg too.  I made sure all ingredients were room temperature. I used my mixer to mix the sugar and cream cheese and stirred the rest of the time.  I also followed the recipe and kept the cheesecake in the oven 5 hours after it was done...lastly, I lightly greased the pan with spray and had NO problems with it sticking.  It was perfectly done after the hour baking. Before serving, I combined a 16 oz container of frozen strawberries with some corn starch and a little sugar. I brought it to a slow boil and boiled it, stirring constantly, for about 2 minutes. It made a delectable topping!  This was definitely impressive...perfection at its best! Thanks for the SUPER recipe!

Wow! So Easy-I filled a large cake pan with 1-2 inches of water and set it underneath my springform pan while the cheesecake was baking. NO CRACKS- I am taking this out of town for Thanksgiving! I am using a raspberry sauce to make it look festive. It is tempting to eat it before Thanksgiving but I will resist-the batter I tasted was awesome!!

This was a perfect classic cheesecake!   The secret to no cracks is to run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake from the side of the pan.  Cheesecakes crack when it cools and shrinks but sticks to the side of the pan.  Mine didn't crack and I didn't use a water bath, used cold ingredients, and even opened the oven door several times to make sure the cake wasn't sticking to the pan as it cooled.  I served it with a blueberry/strawberry sauce and fruit on top and got lots of complements.  I'll definitely make again!!

Wonderful cheesecake recipe! I made it this morning and following your  directions with the exception of adding some finely chopped pecan and cinnamon to the crust and 1/2 tsp of lemon extract to filling.  It turned out beautiful, no cracks, lovely texture and divine taste. My husband who is a big NY Cheesecake lover was impressed. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it is a definate keeper!

You know, I REALLY wanted to love this cheesecake but I didn't. I've made many cheesecakes, and this one just isn't even close to being one of the best. It's bland and boring. I'm a pregnant woman who LOVES cheesecake, and I don't even care to finish it.  It's not worth the calories. If I'm going to eat a fattening cheesecake, it better darned well taste GREAT!

The best Cheesecake I have ever made. I followed the tips and advice from the website and did not get any cracks at all. The cheesecake came out picture perfect. I followed the recipe exactly. With a few changes. 1>Used the halved version of this recipe, and made it in a pre made graham cracker crust. 2> Filled a cake pan with water and put it underneath on the bottom rack while baking. (I even peeked twice for a couple of seconds to check the doneness – still no cracks.) 3>  Then : Cool 3hrs in the oven, cool 3hrs on the counter, wrap and chill for 3hrs in the fridge. Came out perfect! Also making sure all ingredients are at room temp is a must.

This is an awesome NY Cheesecake.  I really don't have any reason to go anywhere else for cheesecake, when I can make it at home.  I did the waterbath below the cheesecake and followed the 6 hours in the oven.  Even my in laws asked for seconds.

This recipe is fantastic! I had never made a cheesecake in my life and followed this recipe (only changing the sour cream to heavy whipping cream), it came out perfect! I followed the tips for making cheesecakes which was extremely helpful and baked it in a water bath. My family, all serious cheesecake lovers were very impressed. I will definately make this again.

The only reason I give this cheescake 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact mine, after the long cool time in the closed oven, came out browned and with a sink hole in the center. I ended up cutting off the top, then it cracked a little. But it was delicious! Best cheesecake ever! Next time I'll try only filling the pan half way, since it does rise. And maybe cracking the overn during the cooling process or shortening the cooling process.

This was very, very good and easy to make.  We followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out beautifully.  We drizzled the cooled cake with caramel topping and sprinkled it with chopped pecans.

This was very good.  I used 2 pkgs Neufchatel cheese and 2 pkgs regular cream cheese.  I removed from the oven after about 2 hours of cooling, and I'm glad I did as I think it would have been too dry if I had not--perhaps that's from the lower fat cream cheese.  My family loved it--served with a homemade cherry-amaretto sauce, and it was a hit.

I think that I was expecting far too much from this recipe.  After reading all of the amazing reviews, I was a little disappointed with the end result.  It was an ok cheesecake - but I have definitely had far better.
I modified the crust - 1 cup of regular graham cracker crumbs, and 1/4 cup of chocolate crumbs for additional flavour(in the future I would probably increase the chocolate crumbs).  To prevent cracking, I did use a water bath, which was fairly successful - only one tiny crack that was easily covered.  The top browned a bit more than I would have liked (definitely will decrease the time on the next go).  Served it with chocolate sauce, which was very good!! I will try this recipe again, just with more modifications.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a lot of work but it came out nicely. I still got cracks but with a topping, nobody knows. :)

I made this dessert for my family in hopes it would be similar to what we buy at a restaurant. The cheesecake came out good, but tasted low fat. I made my own strawberry topping to go with the cheesecake and everyone enjoyed it.

I made this for a family dinner and it was a big hit! It was perfect! I did forget to put in the flour and didn't realize it till later but it was still great- so I am unsure of the benefit of the flour. 
I put a pan of water on the rack under the cheesecake while cooking so the steam would keep it moist and I had no problems at all. 
I finished it with canned strawberry pie filling and it was so great! 
I will make this again!

WOW! I made this for my boyfriend, after he had an 11 day at the office, and boy was he pleased. (The lasagna and garlic bread helped). I used a 9.75inch springform pan and it worked perfectly. I never made cheesecake before! But this turned out perfect, no cracks, excellent color and texture and the flavor! Wow! My boyfriend brought some to work, and they thought it was the best they ever had. His mom even loved it! I also made the strawberry topping from this site too, but you don't need it!!

Not sure what I did wrong...Precooked batter tasted fabulous (raw eggs, I know!) and was really excited about tasting the final product but it the top and crust ended up burning with 10 minutes still left to cook!   I also used room temperature ingredients but got a gaping crack too.  These issues were probably the fault of the cook and not the recipe itself.  Think I stick with store bought.   I find cheesecake a very hard thing to master!

Excellent recipe - I used 1/3 fat cream cheese, skipped the milk, used only 1/2 cup of sour cream, and a little more than 1/2 cup of self - raising flour (did not have all-purpose flour, will use that next time). The cheesecake was extremely tasty.

Very quick and easy to make and went down a treat with friends.  I used digestive biscuits as I we don't have graham crackers in the UK.

I did this recipe just the way it was written and I don't think it was all that great. It was kind of bland tasting. I'm going to top it with something sweet to give it a little more flavor.

WOW, this turned out so great! It was finished off as soon as I served it. I also took the suggestion of using the water bath to cook in, and I only left it in the oven for 1 1/2 hrs to cool. Still turned out great. I will try to leave in cooling longer when I have the time. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've been through all the cheesecake recipes in the world, and I keep coming back to this one. It has the taste and texture I want and cooks beautifully. Sweet and a bit of tang, thick and dense in texture . Everyone who I have served this to ask for a second slice. I'm sticking with this recipe !

This was relatively easy (other than my attempt at burning my house down).  The cake came out smooth and creamy, and next time I'll not be lazy and I will take more steps to avoid cracking.  Additionally, I will either modify this crust recipe or use another crust altogether.  There were far too many graham crackers and not enough butter.  I think I would take another reviewer's suggestion of eliminating 5 of the graham crackers in the future.

Ok, my lil brother requested cheesecake for his graduation. I made one before from another site and wanted something better. Sooooo, I found this lovely one! It was great! Although, I am very impatient and didn't let it cool in the oven for seven hours and of course it cracked. But nothing a lil whipped cream couldn't fix. Everyone loved it and I am making it for a retirement party for one of my co-workers tonight!

Maybe I missed the boat on this one but for me it was just OK. It could also be that my expectations for this cheesecake was a little too high. Nothing about the dish stood out. I following all the instructions and even some suggestions such as the water bath and even then..my cake cracked. Not only one crack but several which wouldn't have made much of a difference if it was good but since it cracked and lacked flavor so I was just upset....I just have to give this one a 2. Sorry Chantal but I'm still searching for the perfect cheesecake and this by far wasn't it.

This recipe is a huge hit!  The texture is just right, and the flavor is outstanding. I hadthe most UNFRIENDLY co-worker come up to me to tell me this was the best cheesecake he ever had, and that I needed to teach the Hyatt Regency Hotel how to make cheesecake, because mine was resturant quality.  Love it!  5 Stars aren't enough!

PERFECT!  NO CHANGES NECESSARY!  Makes lots of batter - fills a 9" pan almost all the way up.  Still cooks perfectly.  Serve with fruit.  I tried serving with chocolate, but chocolate and other candy toppings probably need a denser cheesecake - this one is less dense than most.

This was the first cheesecake I ever made,although I bake often...It was amazing! I did not line my springform pan, it just seemed like a lot of work! Instead I added a full roasting pan of water on the rack below and it turned out great- Thank You!

Awesome cheesecake. I made it for my dad's birthday and everyone, including my sister's picky boyfriend, loved it. I was surprised at how easy it was. The tips were invaluble--definitely use the water bath. I didn't have one crack, and I only left it in the oven to cool for 2 hours after baking. Make it, impress your friends, or just impress yourself!

Cheesecake cracked and cooked faster even though I had the oven in the 300-325 range instead of 350.  I think it was pretty good, but too thick.  I don't know if it got too thick from the being overcooked but it just feels too overwhelming to eat and needs more flavor.  Maybe less cream cheese and/or more sugar.

I made this for my friends birthday and it turned out fabulousy delicious!  The only thing that went wrong was there wer 2 huge 1 inch deep cracks in the cake.  Nobody noticed because I made a Caramel and Cream cheese topping, but next time I will try the water bath.  Also, this recipe made alot more than would fit into a 9 inch springform, so make sure you are prepared and halve a bigger pan on hand!

Perfect recipe. I've made this recipe many, many times and it never fails. If you want a truly delicious, beautiful cheesecake, this is the recipe for you. If you follow the recipe you won't be disappointed. VERY important that ingredients are at room temperature and that you don't overbake it.

Whew. I was nervous making this.  I am an experienced cook but cheesecake is new territory for me. It turned out great.  No cracks. I doubled the foil and made a shallow water bath in a jellyroll pan. I also came down on the temp to 325 but ended up cooking it alot longer so I think next time I'll try the recommended 350. I also used the recipe for crust that used cinnamon and didn't end up liking that flavor, I think I'll leave that out next time.

INCREDIBLY, sinfully perfect!  After reading the seemingly endless reviews, I decided to make this decadent treat and I'm SO glad I did. I decided to try low fat cheese and sour cream (kept the eggs in) and you never would have known anything remotely low-fat was used. The texture was creamy and light, the flavor was perfect and mine had no cracks. I even froze the cake for a week and it thawed perfectly. At least two people refered to this as the "best cheesecake ever."

I made this wonderful cheesecake over the weekend for my son's birthday. I had never made a cheesecake before and this cheesecake turned out perfect. It was a perfect consistency and did not crack. I followed the directions exactly and included the sour cream topping as suggested by reviewer MARIGOBOE. I didn't have a pan large enough to fit my springform (9 1/2 inch) pan so I filled a pan with water and set it on the rack below my cheesecake.  Easy to make and delicious.

I followed all the directions and tips for making the cheesecake and I have been making cheesecakes for years.  I had absolutely no cracks or bubbles and it was delicious.  I covered it with strawberries and homemade chocolate sauce but it is perfect with nothing on it.

I made this for a friend's birthday and it was exactly what I was looking for - GREAT and truly "cheesecakey" but not TOO dense.  

I did have a tough time with the water bath (suggested by this site) though.  I read through people reporting that they had had difficulty (leaks etc.) and figured I should be safe - so I used 4 layers of alumininum foil (and figured that that wouldn't happen to ME!) and the first time around, it STILL leaked.  Aluminum foil is touch to make a water tight seal with, since it tears so easily.

Anyway - I threw that cake out, and the second time around - I put a pan of water on the tray beneath my cake when cooking.  I am not sure that it has the exact same effect, but did keep the oven moist, and relieved the worry of a ruined cake after all that effort.

The (successful) cake itself was phenomenal.  I did a middle layer of: partially cooked apples (4) with their water drained; 1/3 of a cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon mixed in. I also put pecans on top, and drizzled with carmel.  Yum!

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made, and it was awesome! I was nervous because so many reviews mentioned that their's cracked, but MINE DIDNT! I was also unsure about the 15 graham crackers mentioned in the ingredients, maybe it was just me, but I didnt know if that meant 15 whole, or 15 halves or what since the crackers are broken up into 4 sections.  I kinda eyeballed it.  I ended up using 1.5 sleeves of crackers. Also, I added more butter to the crust, and i failed to measure it exactly, I just kept adding it until it stuck together, and was easy to mold.  Dont be alarmed if your cake starts to rise quite a bit above the pan, it will go back down on its own without overflowing.  I got nervous because it looked like it was about 1 inch above the rim, and was starting to turn dark brown, but it turned out perfect! I topped with Pecans, hot fudge and caramel! DELICIOUS! Everyone asked for the recipe!

This turned out so well for my first cheesecake attempt!  I did wrap the springform pan in foil and place in a water bath.  I used 2 low-fat cream cheese packages and 2 regular, and low-fat sour cream.  There were no cracks or bubbles in the cheesecake.  Oh, and I used cinnamon graham crackers for the crust... I found grinding them in a food processor was easier and made a great crust.  Thanks for the recipe!  We topped with the supreme strawberry sauce from this site.

I didn't use a water bath, so my cheesecake cracked. It didn't really bother me though since this was my first cheesecake. I was amazed at how tall the cheesecake was. And it tasted divine with the Supreme Strawberry Topping.

Best cheesecake I've had in a long time.  Followed every part of the recipe (water bath, oven for 5 hours...)  Served it with a homemade raspberry sauce.  
This is the only cheesecake recipe you'll ever need.  Next time will try making them in the little individual ready made pie crusts...everyone will have their own cheesecake!!

This was a great recipe. It made 2 cheese cakes though instead of 1. So I now cut the recipe in 1/2. I also use a premade crust for convience.

This is such an easy recipe to make - who knew I could bake cheesecake!  In fact, it's so good that I've stopped making it for family functions.  I made one for the family get-together for my boyfriend's birthday, and his mom's cake sat, uneaten.  Making this cake gets me in trouble!!  Only for non-family functions from now on :)  *UPDATED*  I have made this recipe numerous times now, and every time I get rave reviews.  One of the best ways I've prepared it, is to get caramel ice cream topping (a thick kind) and use it as 'glue' around the sides of the cheesecake.  Then press Oreo cookie crumbs into the caramel.  On the top, around the edge place Turtles chocolates, and then criss-cross caramel and chocolate sauce in the middle of the cheesecake.  Mmmmmmmmm!!!

Absolutely wonderful! This was my first time making a cheesecake, and it truned out perfect! I didn't have a springform pan, so I ended up with 2 9" pie cheesecakes. I also put the pie dishes into pans w/ water, and they didn't crack like some users mentioned. I topped it with mang, strawberries and pineapple, a great treat, nice and dense!

Wonderful! I shrunk the recipe to 3 servings (for just me and my husband, because we WOULD eat a whole cheesecake in one night) and baked it in a ramekin, in a water bath, and it didn't crack. (Didn't really matter, because it got a little hacked up trying to get it out.) But it was delicious. I might decrease the milk a little next time to get it a little denser... but definitely NO complaints. From now on my only cheesecake recipe!

Yes-this is a NY cheescake very creamy, using a stand mixer I needed to make cupcakes with the extra batter, will use a larger pan next time - seems everyone is upset about the cracks-if you make a topping of 1 cup sourcream and sugar to taste spread over the cake when the baking is done-no one will know and it is so good needs no other topping.

"Absolutely deliciosly creamy!" its the second time i bake a cheesecake. Since my first attempt was a little bit disappointing (another cheesecake recipe), i gave it another try with this recipe and i am so happy it went very well. i followed one of the reviewers advice to wrap the pan with a double layer of aluminum foil and bake bath the cake with a very hot water. i also use a baking paper lining the inside part of the pan, as what is advice, i left the cake inside the oven -door close(after one hour of baking) for 6 to 7 hours. my husband is very particular with cakes and when had a sliced of it he says.."it's the best cheesecake he has ever had!" i'll definitely make this wonderful cake again!  thanks chantal! 5 stars for it...no doubt!!

Great! I do recommend using a larger size pan, typically I use my medium size which the cake cooks over in the oven and creates a crack.  The larger pan prevents it from reaching over the edges.   I also made it into a Marble Cheesecake this last time by using 1 ounce of melted chocolate with a cup of batter.  It turned out great!

this cheesecake is the best... be sure to let your cream cheese come to room temperature before begining it helps a lot when blending

AWESOME Cheesecake! This is my first attempt at making a cheesecake from scratch.  My family and friends all loved it.  I've made it twice, once with a waterbath and once without, both times I did have a crack.  Any Suggestions????

This receipe is amazing.  I was a little worried because it expanded over the top of my springform pan (I think I mixed it too much with my mixer), but the flavor was great.  I followed the instructions and my pie still cracked A LOT, but it still tasted great!

This is great cheesecake. Mine did crack, but no one cared - it tasted so good. I did add sugar to the crust and served it with strawberries and heavy whipped cream. This was such a hit and so easy that it will become a family favorite.

Almost 800 people can't be wrong.  This cheesecake recipe is tops and it's so easy!  I've made it twice and both times it has been a success.  Took the suggestions for the crust (1.5 cups graham crackers, .25 cup butter, .25 cup sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon).  Did a water bath last time (using a roasting bag instead of foil).  This time I did just a pan of hot water in the oven with the cheesecake.  Great results both times.  And most importantly of all, it tastes delicious!

I used to joke with friends that my husband married me for my cheesecake. This however was by far the best cheesecake I have ever made!!! I followed recipe to the letter with the only exception being my oven needed about an extra 10 minutes bake time.

AMAZING!!  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! I made this a few months back and it was extremely well received.  Everyone agreed it was the best cheesecake they had ever had!  It was first attempt at a cheesecake, and I was a little apprehensive but it was so easy!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  The only difference was that I used a 9x13 glass pan .... I didn't have a springform :(  I will definetely be making this again!

Wow!! My very first cheesecake turned out beautifully!  I did adjust the crust using the 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and I needed more graham crackers.  I think I used 1 1/2 packs of graham crackers.  I put a pan of boiling water on the rack under the cheesecake. I'm not sure but I think the springform pan I used was maybe a 10 or 11 inch because it didn't seem like enough crust.  Though I am a crust lover.  I took it out after 2 hours and loosened the sides of the pan and then returned it to the oven for 6 hours.  It was perfect!  The color was gorgeous and there wasn't a single crack! Yay!   And it was simply delicious.  Several family members that "don't care for cheesecake" said it was an exception to the rule! I loved it myself!

I am trying a new spin on this recipe.  I'm using brownie as the crust but keeping the cheesecake part the same.  I hope it turns out just as beautiful because I'm planning on giving this one as a gift!  

Thanks for the great recipe Chantal!

Loved the taste - I cooked it in a water bath to make sure it didn't crack, but the center never set. A little disappointing but I will definitely try it again in a larger springform pan.

Absolutely perfect!  I used one sleeve of graham crackers, added a bit of sugar and the melted butter.  I patted the crumbs about an inch up the side of the springform pan.  For everything else I followed the recipe exactly.  It cracked but hey, so what??  The taste, texture, and sweetness was absolutely perfect.  I served with a slight dollop of seedless blackberry jam.  I don't have to look for another recipe!  Thank you so much Chantal!

My first cheesecake ever.  I won't need to search for another one, unless i wanted to make it all elaborate with other fillings.  For a straight forward cheesecake, add a little fresh fruit and blended fruit puree, it was all that was needed.  It was pure creamy, best after being refrigerated overnight so that it was cold all the way through.

I added oreos and everyone at work said it was 10 times better than the store bought pies brought by coworkers.  It's awesome... the last piece i broke up into vanilla milkshakes for the kids.

This had a huge crack in the middle even though I followed the directions exactly.  The flavor was good.  I might try again and see if it might have been my oven's fault.  I will cook for less time next time.  If it turns out better I'll change my rating!

This is a great recipe.  It turned out so smooth and creamy.  My only addition was 3 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice.  Another reviewer recommended 4 tablespoons but, I found it the lemon just a little bit too bright.  Highly recommended, I'd definitely make this again and again and again....!

Oh Lord! Yes this really is the best cheesecake ever. Both my husband and brother have proclaimed it "Better than the Cheesecake Factory".  Mine always cracks on top no matter what I do, so I solve the problem by putting crushed Oreo's on top.

Shame on me for not doing this sooner.  This recipe is SO easy to use and so very good.  I was amazed at how easy it is.  It is now a family favorite.  We have been enjoying this for over 2 years.  I just saw that this is the "Most Reviewed Cheesecake".  Believe me, there is a reason for that.  It is excellent!  Taste is good, smooth in texture, super easy to make.  I have made it for years now.  No changes to receipe.  It seldom lasts more than 2 days.  You do not need topping to hide the flavor of the cheesecake.  Bake and Enjoy!

This was my first cheesecake....turned out delicious. I opted to use vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract. I also used a waterbath and followed all the instructions. It turned out beautifully!!  All my extended family are begging for more.

OMG, this cake is delicous... Everyone loved it and it's so worth the wait... I do not use the crust on this recipe. I buy "Honey Maid" graham cracker crumbs. 1 1/2 graham cracker crumbs, 1 tablespoon sugar, 6 tablespoons of butter melted. To keep crust from getting soggy in water bath I wrap the bottom of the springform with aluminum foil.
Pat the crumbs on the bottom of springform pan, bake for 8 mins, let cool to room temp. Then, you can continue with the recipe instructions.

This was my first attempt at making a real cheesecake.  It was really good.  I don't think it cooked compeletely though the center still seemed a bit "wet"?  Tasted great anyway.  I followed the directions to the letter.  Maybe I will just read on this site about cheesecakes.  Thanks for the recipe!! I can't wait to try it again!

my 14 year old daughter and her friend made this by themselves - it was great.  Even better the 2nd day, I would recommend making it the day before you plan to serve it.  We'll be making it again soon!

Oh wow, this was so good.  I've never made cheesecake before and it wasn't for company, so I went the easy route and bought a premade pie crust and halved the recipe, turned out to be the perfect amount of filling.  Because I had less ingredients I baked at 300 for 40 minutes and turned off the oven and let it sit for about an hour before refrigerating overnight.  No cracks or anything!
Amazing!  Dense but not too dense, creamy, melt in your mouth, perfect cheesecake, thank you so much!  Can't wait to try variations of this with different toppings, etc.

Don't throw out this recipe just yet! I've made it in two separate ovens and in the first one, the cheesecake came out burned, cracked, and eggy after only 30 minutes. In the second oven, an electric oven with a consistant temperature, the cheesecake came out AWESOME! I highly recommend getting a thermometer for your oven if this recipe didn't work out, because it is so worth it when it comes out right!

This is a nice recipe but I was looking for something a little firmer and not so creamy.  The only way to bake a cheesecake is using a water bath and allowing the cheesecake to cool slowly by leaving it in the oven with the door cracked.  Be sure to turn the oven off!

Awesome flavor!  I used the graham cracker recipe on the box (with sugar).  I followed the directions but still ended up with cracks.  Will try water bath next time.

Perfect cheesecake--dense, rich, creamy, but not runny. And no cracks!  I modified the recipe a bit (who doesn't?).  I used crushed gingersnaps for the crust; replacd 1/4 c. of  milk with Amarula (marula fruit creme, kind of like Bailey's Irish creme); added the zest of one lemon; baked it in a waterbath (using boiling water); let it sit in the oven for only two hours after baking, then on the counter (on a hot summer night) another 2 hours before putting it in the fridge.

Great recipe. Very simple to follow and great results for a beginner. I thought the crust would be a little bland - especially because Keebler's graham crackers are a little tasteless. I mixed 1 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs, 3 tablespoons of white sugar and about 1/2 - 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. I winged the butter until I got a desired consistency.

I've never been a huge fan of cheesecake. I made it for my brother's birthday, and I think it turned out pretty darn good for my first time making cheesecake. I will have to find a better recipe for the crust (maybe it depends on the type/brand of graham crackers that you buy). I will use less flour next time. I think it might be missing something though. I had high expectations for it after reading all the good reviews. I'll have to experiment a little more with this recipe. I used a water bath, and it ruined my aluminum pan. I wrapped the bottom in 2 sheets of foil, but water still seeped in. Use an oven bag! I didn't get any cracks. There's a page with advice about making cheesecakes on this site. Read it! I didn't open the oven at all until maybe 4 hours later. I used low-fat cream cheese, and it turned out just fine. I was very pleased with this recipe.

Chantal~your recipe is the BOMB!  Everyone thought I purchased it in a store.  It was rich and creamy, and totally delicious! I used 2-3T of flour, as rec. by another poster, and 1T of sugar in the crust.  The rest was per the recipe. It did crack, despite the water bath AND long cool time in the oven, but it was so wonderful NO ONE cared!  Thanks for the killer cheescake!

Delicious!Made it for my daughters 15th birthday party, and everyone enjoyed it.  One comment made was that it tasted better than cheesecakes sold at bakeries or restaurants.  Served it with a strawberry sauce.

This is just FANTASTIC! It was simple, yet tasted as if I slaved in the kitchen for hours. My sister in law(who owns a bakery) asked where I bought it. When I told her that I baked it myself she just HAD to have the recipe. I did deviate from the recipe a bit, and I added a little sugar to the graham crackers for the crust, and I also baked it using a waterbath. I agree, if you have to pick one cheesecake recipe out of all the choices you have here, this is the one to try if you want an authentic cheesecake taste. Chantal - thanks for sharing it!

We thought this was very good. It's not as complicated as I thought it might be, but I noticed that the cake did crack in the middle, a lot, even though I followed the directions about leaving it in the over for 5 hours. We chilled it for a few hours, but it tasted better once it had chilled overnight. Also- does cheesecake usually have a crust all around the sides or just in the bottom like this one? Overall good recipe, very tasty!

This cheesecake is wonderfully delicious! I did use 2 tablespoons of flour, and a water bath as recommended by others, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. My husband who doesn't even like cheesecake ate half by himself. This is the cheesecake recipe to try!

This cheesecake is amazing! Only my 3rd cheesecake ever, and it came out perfect-no cracks, perfect texture. It was a huge hit at a party we had, I even got phone calls the next day about it. I did a different crust (added some sugar), only used 2 Tbs. of flour, and baked in a water bath with a long cool time in the oven-delicious! Thanks Chantal!

This is a great recipe but it definitely needs to be baked in a water bath. I made it a couple of times without the bath and it cracked everytime. In addition to using a water bath, I also bake my cake for 10 minutes at 475 and then reduced the oven to 350 for 50-60 minutes. It comes out perfect every time.

This is an excellent recipe, I ran out of cream cheese at 3 and not 4 like the recipe requested, so I increased the flour by a few tablespoons, I used chocolate grahams and doubled that part and then I added chocolate chunks (about 1.2 cup) which sank down to the crust layer to bake and topped with blueberry filling, decorated with chocolate leaves and it was a huge hit at a party.

Delicious, rich and creamy!  Not being one to like crusts, I omitted it and just buttered the pan.  I was careful  not to overmix the batter and actually put all the filling ingredients into my mixer bowl at once, then combined just until smooth.  It was a warm day and the cream cheese was very soft -- I had let it sit out for several hours to soften.  I used a water bath too.  When it came time to turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven, I discovered it was almost time to start dinner and so the cheesecake had slightly over an hour of resting time, not the 5-6 hours recommended.  I removed it from the water bath and let it rest right on the oven rack for the cooling time.  At the end of an hour, the entire cake looked a little wiggly, but not liquid.  I refrigerated it overnight and the next day I had an uncracked, lovely, lightly browned, creamy, delicious cheesecake!  I will definitely make this again.

Perfect as usual! I do have some tips to prevent the cracking. All ingredients should be room temp, Do not overbeat the ingredients, lightly butter the springform pan and when you take the cheesecake from the oven, gently loosen around the edges because it shrinks up a bit as it cools and if you don't loosen the edges it will pull from the middle and crack.

This recipe was the best! I made it for a family gathering and everyone enjoyed it. However, I did follow other reviews and baked it in a waterbath and it came out with no cracks.  I also double wrapped the pan in foil so no water would leak in. I also made a strawberry topping to go along with it (2 cups of strawberries, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1 tbs. cornstarch; cook over low heat until desired consistency.)  I also found a sour cream topping that went great with the cake too (1 cup sour cream, 2 tbs. sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and 1/2 tsp. almond extract; mix all ingredients together).

Chantal Thank You! Easy to make and everyone loved it.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I made three of these,1 I filled 3/4 of the way from the top, it didn't crack, but the other two I fill to the top cracked, next time I'll just fill them 3/4 of the way.

I have been making this recipe for years and ALWAYS get rave reviews.  I recently tried using a Reynold's oven bag for the water bath, as water always seeps in , even if I wrap the springform pan well with foil.  It worked!  Just place the springform pan in the oven bag, and roll the edges down to right below the top of the springform pan, and viola!  No leaks!  Thanks, Chantal for a really great recipe!

this is the last New York Cheesecake recipe I will ever look for. turned out extremely creamy, perfect amount of sweetness. i used skim milk and it did not take away from the creaminess at all. 
I used a 10" pan so it would be more spread out. i also wanted an extra thick crust so i used 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/2 cup margarine. everyone loved it.

Great recipe- VERY easy- VERY delicious!  I used Baily's Irish creme instead of milk.  YUMMY!!  I made several attempts at this to make this into 4" springform pans.  I baked 4 at a time.  After several tries, here's what I found:  Bake at 325 degrees, 35-30 mins.   I placed a pan of water on the lowest rack in the oven, and it worked great.  No cracks.  Hope this helps someone else!

I have tried many cheesecake recipes from this site, and this one is the BEST! I made only a couple of slight modifications: I made an Oreo crust and used only 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla, baked in a 10 3/4" springform pan, put a pan of warm water on the rack below the cheesecake in the oven, and did not cool it in the oven at all after it baked for an hour.  Cooled almost completely on the counter and refrigeratated.  We waited 24 hours to cut into it, and it was perfect: tangy, just the right amount of sweetnees, awesome creamy texture.  This will be my basic cheesecake recipe from now on!

Yummy!  The best cheesecake ever....I will never pay for another cheesecake.  The texture was perrrfect and the taste was incredible.  I was just wondering how long I would put it in the oven for if I were to half this recipe.

I've reviewed this many years ago, but I'll update it.

This recipe is very easy to play with.  

- I've added Balies Irish Cream in the batter as part of the liquid
- I've added powdered chocolate to half the batter to make swirls.  
-  I've topped it with tempered chocolate to make it like a cheesecake dove bar.  
- I always serve with a fruit topping.  Usually raspberry.  Just take a pack of fresh raspberries, mix it with some water, boil it, strain it, add in some sugar and corn starch, add in some brandy and you've got a nice creamy fruit topping.

You can do anything with it!

I wouldn't trust any other recipe at this point, even though this is the only one I've tried.

Some things I want to try:

- Oreo crumbles for crust.
- Make caramel and swirl it in with the batter.
- Pumpkin something.
- Using a non-springform pan to cook in (I can never seem to really seal up a springform pan so it is 100% water tight).
- Cooking on a lower temp for longer (another reviewer seems to cook it at 250 or so for a couple hours)
- Adding a tablespoon of corn starch with the sugar.  Alton Brown gives this as a tip to take out insurance against cracking.  
Remember you are basically making custard here.  The lower the temp and the longer the cooktime, the more "custard" it will become.  Watch Good Eats on this :-)

My advice for first-timers?  Make this recipe to the letter the first time.  Odds are very good in your favor it will work out.  Then just start to play with it the next time

This was an awesome recipe! I'd never made cheesecake from scratch in my life and decided to make this one for my husband's birthday. He loved it and has requested that this be made again!
The texture, the flavor, and the color turned out amazing!!! It looked like something from a New York deli.
This was wonderful with strawberry sauce over the top and would probably be amazing with raspberries. 
Thanks for the fabulous recipe. YUM!

I made this dessert for a non-traditional Thanksgiving dinner my family had last night. I stayed up Wednesday evening to make 2 of these cheescakes. After the hour bake time (yes, I baked both in the oven together) I simply shut off the oven and went to bed. When I got up the next morning, I put them in the refrigerator to get cold, then took them to my party. My family absolutely LOVED them. Much better than any box mix. And on one cheesecake I nearly forgot a whole brick of cheese! I added it before the eggs and it still came out wonderful. For those willing to try this recipe, a few hints: first, have everything ready, all measurements of ingredients, etc. Mixing is the hardest part. Second, make sure the cream cheese is soft, nearly room temperature - it makes mixing that much easier. Third, think ahead. These should be baked a day before needed, to allow for rest time in oven and chill time in refrigerator. Fourth and last - DON'T BE TEMPTED TO TEST WITH A KNIFE! I wasn't thinking and tested for doneness with a knife and wound up with cracks. They still turned out wonderful and the cracks can be hidden by toppings, but who likes cheesecakes with cracks? All in all, an excellent recipe. Thank you Chantal!!!

This was good, but I would suggest lowering the sugar amount to 3/4 or 1 cup.  It was just too sweet the first time I made it, didn't taste "cheesy" enough.

My husband almost bit my fingers off when I tried to pour some cherries on top of his slice of cheesecake. Said it's too good to cover up the taste with other stuff. LOL I guess you could call that a great review. This was easy to make and had a wonderful texture and flavor. Something tells me I'll be making this cheesecake again and again...minus cherries.

Creamy yet firm and delicious, this cheesecake is a winner! For the filling, we followed the instructions exactly and minded the recommendations for making cheesecake provided by AllRecipies.com, including making sure the ingredients are at room temperature when mixing, not overmixing, using the water bath, and letting the cake cool overnight. This produced a cheesecake a world of difference from what we had ever made before! Thanks for posting the recipie Chantal!

SO GOOD. No more needs to be said, everyone else's comments have pretty much summed up what everyone who tasted this thought...
My boyfriend and I had just got back from NYC when we tried this recipe. We thought it was as good, if not better than what we bought in the delis. We did alter the crust by using one pack of graham crackers (10 graham crackers wrapped in plastic), nearly 1/2 cup of butter, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. The crust turned out well, a bit sugary which I thought was wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe, it is DEFINITELY a keeper.

I loved this recipe.  I used a water bath to prevent cracks and a different crust recipe using walnuts, pecans, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Left it in the oven over night and then refrigerated unwrapped for 4 hours. It is creamy and has a delicate flavor.  It was not as firm as a traditional NY Style cheesecake so I may have not baked it long enough (1 hour at 350 degrees).  It is a definite hit.

This turned out really well. I made this for my family while I was on vacation, and every peice was eaten. If I could give one peice of advice for this recipe, it would be to have your cream cheese and sour cream at room temp. That's an important step in making the "perfect" cheesecake that many people ignore. I used a waterbath like other reviewers and wrapped the bottom of my springform pan with foil to prevent any leaking. I thought the crust was the best part, and I could have eaten it all by itself. I wonder if there is a way to make it into cookies??  I served this with Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce.  A terrific combination. Thanks Chantal

WOW!! This IS the best cheesecake I have ever had.  The only thing I changed was to change vanilla to half tablespoon to make a more tart cheesecake taste.  Mine cracked, but oh well, after the tast, who cares about the cracks.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND! A++++++++++

Okay folks:  This is *the* cheesecake.  There's nothing more to say about it that hasn't already been said.  Bake it, love it and swear by it!  You won't find a better one, it's classic!  Remember to bake it in a water bath and you won't have cracks either!

WONDERFUL!  I cut the recipe in half & added 8 drops of orange oil (could add orange zest as well) with the vanilla.  I used an 8 inch springform and baked at the same temperature for a half hour.  I turned off the oven & let it sit over night.  It did crack but I put a layer of bittersweet chocolate on top & then topped with Strawberries that had been dipped in chocolate.  Beautiful AND tasty.  You can't go wrong with a recipe that has been reviewed this many times and has a 5 star rating!

I made this Sat. for Mother's Day.  It was good but not as creamy as I would of liked it to be.  I like most others baked the cake with a pan of water under it.  It did not crack and it did look beautiful. I might make this again, not sure yet.  I also changed the crust recipe by adding more butter, white sugar, and cinnimon. I will try some of the other recipes for cheesescake on here. Honestly, this is the first recipe on allrecipes.com I have rated 4 stars out of about 20 recipes I have tried. The rest have all been fives. Thanks.

The best. I have tried many different cheese cakes but this one wins hand down.  You can play with this recipe alittle.  I have made this with the low fat cream cheese, was good , but not as good as the regular recipe.  I add alittle lemon juice, and you can also sprinken some Cin. & Sugar on the bottom of the crust for extra kick. 

You do need to grease teh sides of the pan, and do use a water bath!! I have only had this cake crack once out of about 12 cakes.  So far .... so Good!


THE BEST CHEESECAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ThIS WAS OK..I was disappointed by the crust because I used regular graham cracker crumbs from the box and it was just not that great..It was all mushy after the cake cooked ..I made this cake for a potluck at my office and it WAS THE FIRST thing to go, but I was not that happy with the ending results..I think I will make it again, but follow the advice from other posters .i am also goingt o use a store bought crust next time..OH..I also had to buy canned cherries to add to the top of the cake because after it cooked it was a weird brwon color..nOT LIKE REGULAR CHEESCAKE..OH WELL.

This is absolutely incredible! I made this for New Year's Eve (with a blackberry sauce) and everyone just RAVED about it. I wasn't able to taste it since I had a bad cold, but I know it was delicious because my fiance (who claims to be a cheesecake expert) is still telling everyone about it! He said it's definitely the BEST cheesecake he's ever had. This means a lot to me, since this was the very first cheesecake I've made. Thanks, Chantal, for a fabulous recipe!

I made this cheesecake for a paty. It was absolutely fabulous!! I baked it for 75 min though. Plus I made a choc-chip cookie base instead cos the kids like that. It was creamy, rich & very dense, just the way I like it. This is the best NY cheese I've ever tried.

made this for christmas 2 years ago and now my family demands i make it for every gathering.  my uncle from new york swears it's authentic.  last time i substituted 1/2 of the cream cheese for reduced fat and used low fat sour cream...they couldn't tell the difference!  goes well with a strawberry topping!

Chantal Thank you!  This recipe is a hit in two weeks I made four wonderful cheesecakes and the responses are amazing. Haven't had a good cheesecake in a while. Will be making this over and over again.  The only difference made crust all up the pan. Oh, I don't leave the cheesecake in for as long after baking gets a little overdone for my taste. Thanks again.

Instead of putting the eggs in one at a time, to help prevent cracking like mine did, put them all in at once!  But it was a great recipe. I don't like cheesecake, but my family loves it.

WOW!!!
This is the recipe to try!!! I loved it, my friends loved it....it is truly an amazing recipe. It was not time consuming. Though I didn't try the water bath technique and it did crack. We all loved it anyway. Also I was able to make the cheesecake using egg-replacer (rather than real eggs) and it was still fabulous.

This was easy to make but mine came out very burnt- and the crust made a huge mess everywhere- there was not enough butter to hold it together-
flavor was ok- but will not make again- sorry.

This is the most delicious cheesecake I've ever tasted.  It is so smooth and moist.  I used a can of chilled cherry pie filling as a topping and it was totally awesome.  I think next time I will try it in a muffin pan to make bite size cheesecakes.  Thanks Chantal!

This is a very good cheesecake recipe.  I really like the flavor.  I had to reduce the heat some, because mine really started to brown on top.  My only real problem was the water bath.  For some reason, although I covered the pan in aluminum foil, the water still seeped into the pan leaving the crust really soggy.  :(  I think next time I will just try a pan of water on the rack under the cake.  I had no cracks, and only left it in the oven for 4 hours before transferring it to the fridge.  Great recipe!

I had never made a baked cheesecake before. This was very easy. I had read other reviews about not over mixing, so I was cautious. I also did do the water bath as it baked and cooled. No cracking! We liked the texture of the cheesecake better after it was a few days old and got drier. Next time I will try it with the mini choc chips.

This is the best...Only change would be to add a pan of water under the cake when it's baking, which is an old rule when baking cheesecakes.  Also, is a great way to use some of the seasonal fruits that are so bountiful and inexpensive.  Enjoy!

This was my first cheesecake, and I was so impressed, as was my family.  I followed the suggestions of the water bath and used a dish towel in the roasting pan, NO CRACKS!!!  I can't wait to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe and the helpful suggestions.

I didn't know I could make cheesecake until this recipe.  The only gripe I had was that even keeping it in the oven for a few hours afterward didnt'prevent cracking... but it still looked great and tasted even better.

This is the closest to a German cheese cake I have ever come. Everyone loved it. I did add the grind and juice of 1 fresh lemon. We also like it when bottom is layered with peaches before pouring filling into crust. Great recipe, thank you very much.

This  is Eric in Houston.  My wife and I loved this recipe!!!  My wife took several pieces to work and her co-workers loved it, and now they want me to make the cake for an upcoming party.  My cake did not crack.  I bought a brand new springform pan, and I did not open the oven for six hours.  My only problem is, I need a good recipe for a strawberry topping.  The stuff in the grocery stores are no good!

I made this cheesecake for a get-together with friends.  It turned out wonderful!  It looked terrific and was delicious.  I made a different crust using 1 1/2 cups graham crackers, 1/4-1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup melted butter.  I also placed it in a water bath while baking. After it had cooled I spread the top with caramel ice cream topping and drizzled hot fudge over that.  I then added some pecans.  YUMMY!  The group was very impressed.

I used this recipe for a party and everyone LOVED it! It was a little brown and cracked, but I added fresh fruit so noone noticed. For the crust, I used cinnamon-sugar graham crackers (this gives a beter taste) and packed it on the sides of the pan as well as the bottom.  It's a little more time-consuming but worth it if you're a crust-lover like me! This is definitely my new favorite recipe!!  :o)

This has been my go-to cheesecake recipe for a while now.  I have to admit, turning the oven off while cheesecake is still jiggly in the center always freaked me out a bit, so I'd always bake it for longer than recommended (another 30 minutes or so) until it was completely set.  The top would brown a bit and I always got cracks, but it tasted soooo good and was nice and dense but still creamy.

I just made this recipe again yesterday, determined that it was going to be a pretty cheesecake this time!  I followed the instructions exactly - baked at 350 for 1 hour, then I turned the oven off without opening the door and left it in there for about 4 hours.  I also wrapped the bottome of my springform pan in two layers of foil and put it in a hot water bath to bake.  It turned out gorgeous!  (See my posted photo for this recipe.)  Only very slightly browned on the edges, no cracks, and definitely pretty to look at.  However, the consistency was very creamy and soft.  Many people prefer their cheesecake this way, but I personally like mine more firm & dense, so I may go back to cooking it longer even if the end result isn't as pretty!

Either way, it's absolutely delicious!

I use 12 graham cracker squares (so 6 rectangles) and 3 Tbsp of melted butter for the crust.

This cheesecake is delicious! I used Bailey's Irish Cream instead of the milk for a little change, and it came out great! If you are looking for a versitile plain cheesecake, this is definately the one. Only one drawback - the crust came out a little too mushy, but that can be fixed by the amount of butter added when mixing the crust.

Absolutely delicious! The consistency was spot on! I tried a piece after the suggested  2 hour refrigeration time and it was still too soft for me. I then waited until the next day and it was magnificent!

I've made this a few times and each time it's been amazing.  I have read a lot of reviews to see what the consensus is and used many of your tips.  This is what I did:
- since I like a dense cheesecake I reduced the flour to 2 tbsp and reduced the milk (in my case 1/2 &  1/2)
- added the zest of one Meyer lemon and about 2 tsp of the juice    
- let the ingredients, all in their original seal, sit out to get to room temp except for the 1/2 & 1/2
- beat everything only enough to incorporate
- put a 9x13 pan of water under the cake instead of the direct water bath which soaked my cake when I tried it
- 325F at 1 hr 15 min then left it in for several hours without ever opening the door, then into the fridge with saran wrap over it
Thanks to the original recipe poster and to everyone who has made this recipe and contributed to the comments...they're very helpful!
No cracks.   Delicious, dense, creamy NY style cheesecake that gets rave reviews from all who eat it.

I make this cheesecake often following the recipe to the t, except for the cooking instructions. Here's what works best for me. I preheat the oven to 400 degrees. I then cook the cake on the middle rack for 10 minutes. Then, I turn the oven off and leave the cake in the closed oven (no peeking) for another full hour. I then open the oven door and leave the cake in the oven for another full hour. Next, I sit the cake on the counter for a couple of hours until it is completely cooled. And, lastly I cover the cake and sit in the fridge for another 24 to 48 hours. I always get rave reviews! Today, I tried something different. I wanted to make this cake for a dinner with friends tomorrow night, but the full cake would be really over doing it for 6 people. So, I bought myself a 7 inch springform pan and cut the recipe in half. I still preheated the oven to 400 degrees and cooked for 10 minutes, then I turned the oven off and kept in closed oven for 50 minutes, and then another 50 minutes with the door ajar. Another successful cheesecake! I can see myself making the half cake again often as we usually have so much leftover when I make the full cake. Cheers!

Perfect! Followed all the tips and tricks re creaming the cheese first and then again with sugar then adding eggs one by one and hand mixing. I doubled the topping and cooked for 1 hour and 15 minutes then let sit in the oven with it off for 3.5 hours. I made a caramel sauce for the top and roasted apples with cinnamon, brown sugar and butter and placed them on the top. Perfect thanksgiving dessert.

This cheesecake was very good.   Came out perfect.  The only change was I didn’t have any milk so substituted with coffee creamer. Had a little crack in middle but nobody noticed with the blueberry topping.  DELICIOUS

Best cheesecake recipe ever! Easy to make and everyone loved it. I did bake it in a waterbath so it didn't crack. And left it in the oven for a few hours while cooling down. Best if it sits in the fridge for a few hours before eating as well :)

Made this using the ingredients exactly called for in the recipe.  After reading many of the tips and reading the Allrecipes "How to make perfect cheesecakes", I decided to use the warm bath method and lower the temperature to 325 for one hour.  I didn't have a large enough pan to put the cheesecake directly in a warm bath, so I used the tip of putting a 13 x 9 dish filled with hot water below it in the oven.  I also left the cheesecake in the oven for 5 hours after the one hour of baking and then kept in in the refrigerator overnight. I was careful not to over mix the ingredients to minimize the amount of air in the mixture.  The cheesecake came out great with no cracking at all.  The taste and texture was just like a New York style cheesecake, as I like it.  The only difference I would make is set the oven for 350, as the recipe states, instead of the 325.  The center was very slightly softer and more of a custard like consistency and I believe the higher temp would have taken care of that.   Overall, for my first attempt at making a cheesecake,  I was extremely pleased.

I made is exactly as the recipe called for. It is wonderful. My only problem is cracking, but everyone I bake it for said they would take it with a crack any day. Plus for the ones who love fruit on top, it hides it anyway. I have been told this recipe is better than McGuires!! Most say it is the best cheesecake they have ever eaten.

Besides making my own graham cracker crust  and baking it in a water bath, I made this exactly as directed. It did brown a little bit on top, but it was still the most delicious cheesecake I've ever had. Next time I'll lower the temperature a little bit to avoid that. I highly recommend making this if you love cheesecake!

I made this for our Christmas Eve dinner tomorrow night.  I left it in the oven, per the instructions, to avoid cracking.  I just took it out of the oven after 5.5 hours of cooking and it is majorly cracked all over the top.  Luckily, dinner is with my adult children and grandchildren, so looks don’t matter; taste will be the Test.  But I could never take it to an event.  Next time, I will take it out of the oven to cool.  I will update this after we actually eat it.

I’ve never made a cheesecake before as I don’t really like cheesecake all that much. But my hubby really wanted cheesecake for his birthday. I gave this one a shot and it turned out beautiful and tasty. The hubs, kids and I all loved it. I followed the directions exactly. Next time I will add 1 more tablespoon of butter to the crust for a total of 3 tablespoons to 15 crackers. I did not do a water bath but did leave the cake in the oven to cool for 5 hours. No cracks! My oven runs a bit hot so I would probably reduce the temp by 10 degrees or so next time.

Wow! This cheesecake is absolutely perfect. I added some peppermint extract and instead of graham cracker crust used Oreos, and it still came out amazing. Plus, this cheesecake did not crack and fall in the center, like most others do. I only had time to leave it in the oven as directed for about 2 hours instead of 6, and it still came out gorgeous. I feared of it being a little mushy, because that's how it was when it came out of the oven, but it hardened into the perfect consistency overnight in the fridge. Cheesecake is my favorite dessert, and now I have the perfect starter recipe that I can modify into any type of cheesecake. You must start with room temperature ingredients - the batter will lump if not. Also, do not thoroughly mix the eggs, just enough to have them incorporated. If you follow these few "rules", you will have a gorgeous cheesecake waiting for you in the oven.

FABULOUS!!! My 16 year old found this recipe and made it. It was her first time baking a cake from scratch much less a cheese cake. It was Delicious and perfect. You have to be patient. You have to be patient and further more you have to be PATIENT. It is not a box cake that you take out of the oven and cut warm and serve. It have to ripen.  It was so tempting to want to eat it warm. We even googled it to see it we could it looks so good.  Lolll. She listen too what the reviewer MORENA said and did not over mix and basically have we left it alone in the oven over night till the bottom of the pan was cool (she made it at night) then we chilled it in the fridge for the rest of the day and had it after dinner. ( a real earlier dinner lol). It does need to ripen because on day two and three, OH MY GOODNESS! Even better than day one. Her dad is a Cheesecake Factory junky and he loved it. We shared some with a friend and he was in love with it. He said he it was perfect no too sweet and far from bland. I put white chocolate sauce all over it yum.  She put dark chocolate. Good base for fruit and toppings. To my credit I have never done a review here before in five years. That thang was good!

Sweet. Baby. Jesus. This cheese cake was AMAZING! I followed the recipe to a T. I was a little concerned at first when my cheesecake looked like it was going to topple over but, once it was cooled down and put in the fridge it settled into a nice, perfect taste cheesecake. My cake did have a rather large crack in the center but I truly did not care. This was the best cheesecake my whole family has ever ate AND two of my members even had cheesecake straight from New York. My 16 year old said she wants this for her birthday cake in August. Thank you SO much for the PERFECT cheesecake recipe.

I have never ever attempted to make a cheesecake. I followed the recipe to a T and took others advice to be sure not to over mix and bake it in a water bath.  I baked it exactly 1 hr and left it to cool in the oven for about 6 hrs ( got up at 3am to put it in the refrigerator quick lol) and it turned out PERFECT!  My boyfriend went back for seconds.  It's very creamy and light, not at all heavy. Success!!!!

This is the best one I have tried! Had company coming over and made this without knowing how it would be. Everyone loved it. The only issue I have is the amount of the melted butter for the crust. There is no way 2Tbls of butter would be enough for 15 graham crackers. I used a stick which is 1/2 cup. I looked at several other recipies which called for less crumbs and a lot more butter, so I knew this was not correct.

Alright this whole recipe revolves around preventing cracking but mine had a HUGE crack in it, bigger than ive ever had while making a cheesecake and i've made quite a few. I followed the directions  to the letter and it still happened. It was tasty though which is why im giving it 3 stars, the texture was good despite it looking very dried out and I was surprised the crust turned out okay since you don't bake it in advance. All in all I would use literally any other recipe but its not the absolute worst.

Made this for thanksgiving. So after looking at countless reviews and countless other recipes from Philadelphia cream cheese, Keebler, food network, and Nabisco, I basically followed this  recipe and did used some of the suggestions from other reviews. I will tell you NO WATERBATH NEEDED! CRUST: I crumbled up the vanilla flavored graham crackers ad added 1/4c butter,  1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4c sugar baked for about 10 minutes. FILLING: everything basically stayed the same but instead of using milk I used heavy whipping cream, and instead of using 1/4 c of flour I put 2tbsps of cornstarch. I baked on 300 instead of 325 for 1hr, left it in the oven for 3 hrs ad then let it sit in the refrigerator for another 3 hours . This was my first cheesecake and it did not crack and again I say I did not do a water bath. It was very rich and creamy. I did not pour all of the batter in but most of it I did and my daughter made cheesecake cupcakes out of the rest of the batter both tasted awesome. This was a big hit with my family and friends and my fiancé who loves Cheesecake and eats so much of it till he is sick

I've made SO many cheesecakes and this is the first one I've ever made that didn't crack!! The whole "leaving it in the oven to cool" trick awesome! I even completely forgot to add the flour and it turned out great. IF yours DOES crack (like so many of mine through the years), I've learned to take about a cup of sour cream mixed with just enough sugar to take away the tang and a few drops of vanilla (or almond is great too!) and spread over the top when the cheesecake is done. Bake for about another 10 minutes, and you have a nice glazed, smooth top again.

I made this recipe the first time exactly like the cooking instructions. This has a lot of potential I just need to practice it a bit more. It cracked, I was careful not to over beat it but it still cracked it also seemed VERY over cooked so my oven may be running hot . The cheesecake tasted fabulous so i know I will try it again. I will probably come back and review it more. It was VERY thick but I really think that had more to do with it being overcooked than anything. So, Until next time... this was a good recipe

This is an awesome recipe.  I did make it twice so here are my tips.... I didn't grease the pan good enough the first time or do a water bath as recommend by other people. As a result it stuck to the sides and cracked bad along with not being very flat.  The second time I greased the pan really well and did the water bath.  It came out beautiful and perfectly flat.  I also made the Fresh Strawberry Sauce Recipe by Chef John that is on here and it was an amazing addition.   I will make this again soon I'm sure.

Like previous comments stated, be sure to butter the sides of the pan. Also, various graham crackers come in different sizes. Classic Nabisco graham crackers are 4 crackers per rectangle, so be wary of that whilst forming the crust! Don't be scared if the very center appears uncooked, the cooling in the oven makes short work of that. 

This recipe is fantastic! It's super easy and tasty! I made this dish for my family due to mild grief from having to share measly slices at restaurants. With this recipe,  you'll never be short on Cheesecake again! Be sure to follow the directions about letting it sit in the oven; the cooling process is critical to the flavor and feel of the Cheesecake.

I just made this and followed the recipe to the T. I don't think a 9" pan is big enough for this recipe. I noticed the batter wasn't gonna fit so I switched to a 10". Even after I placed the batter into a bigger pan, the cake still doubled in size and over lapped the bigger pan. How is everyone else getting this right? I'm pretty good at baking and I can't figure out what I did wrong.

Turned out fantastic! I used Laurelc43's cooking method, baking it in a water bath at 225 for 3 hours and 40 minutes, then shut off the oven and left it in for another 3 hours. It was perfectly level, with no cracks. This will be a go to for special occasions.

Love it just the way it is written! Perfection if you follow the instructions to the letter. Also, as an aside, if you are as annoyed by the ads in the ingredients list as I am, just click the "print" button above and to the right of the ingredients list and it will take you to a screen with the recipe written in a clean form without the distracting ads. :)

The best cheesecake recipe, secret is don't overbake. 1hr is perfect, it WILL set on cooling. Leave it in the oven (off) to cool for the full time, it does make a difference. When cooked properly it is smooth and creamy. Cooling it slowly makes all the difference. Made a lot of cheesecakes and this is THE best one!

This cake is great every time! I've tried it several times, but this time I was able to get it to not crack! I greased the pan really well with coconut cooking spray. I baked it in a water bath, after having foiled the cake pan in several layers. Once the one hour of baking was up, I took out the cake for a minute to run a plastic knife around the inside edge of the pan to make sure the cake is not stuck to the pan. I then put the cake back into the oven and left it there for five hours. It's the best if you can leave the cake in the fridge for a long time before serving. The times where it sat in the fridge over night were best!

This is a great recipe! It's so easy to make and very hard to mess up. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to making cheesecakes and even I couldn't mess this one up. My husband requested an Oreo cheesecake for his birthday so I made this cheesecake with an Oreo crust and I added some chopped Oreo's into the mix before baking it and then put some on top afterwards. You could easily add any type of topping or filling you desire and this will still be delicious. I will definitely be making this again. Also, I didn't have time to leave it in the oven for 5-6 hours. I left it in the oven for about 2 hours and it was still fine. I baked it with a pan of water underneath to help prevent cracking.

This was my first time making cheesecake. It's delicious!!! I did what another reviewer said though after beating the cream cheese & sugar with a mixer I used a spoon so I didn't over beat it.  I also timed the oven at 60 minutes & shut it off. I didn't open the door either. This is A great recipe!!

I followed the directions exactly, took advice of another reviewer and never checked it cooked it for one hour turned the oven off, and waited several hours before opening the oven. Turned out beautiful and tasty. My husbands coworkers asked if I would make more for $50 each!  This cheesecake is perfect!

I have been making it since the year of 2002 and every time it is a hit. I've baked other cheesecakes but this one is the best!
The only thing I'm changing is the crust. Sometimes it's a layer of sponge cake, sometimes crushed Oreos with butter (discarding the filling). 
Also using 1/4 cup less sugar tastes better to me.

Tthe flavor was okay, but the cheesecake was very light and airy, and I couldn't taste the cream cheese like I would in a normal cheesecake. There was a huge split in the middle when I took it out to refrigerate, and just got worse when it was ready to be eaten. I followed the directions perfectly, but the texture still came out kind of disappointing.

Second time making this cake.  Making it this time with cinnamon toast crunch crust (Crush 6 cups cereal and mix with 1/2 cup melted butter).  I over baked the first one but it was still yummy!  Hoping I do a better job this time with the wonderful recipe.

anybody who has anything negative to say about this recipe either has a vendetta against the person who submitted the recipe or they did not follow the directions.  this is hands down the most delicious cheesecake i have ever made or eaten!!  thank you so much for this superb recipe!  i will say i only kept the cheesecake in the turned off oven for less than 2 hours because i needed the oven to make dinner and it was still perfect...no cracks at all.

This cheese cake comes out perfect if you do it correctly!  I used the wrong size pan the first time.  I cracked very bad.  Re-did it in the right size pan and it turned out perfect!!  It looked professional!

I made this perfect cheesecake for Easter, without doing a test-run beforehand. Thank goodness it was absolutely delicious. It was dense, but still moist and fluffy. The only variation I made, which was completely accidental, was I used too many graham crackers. I used 15 sheets, when I think each small rectangle counted as 1 cracker - oops. But I just had an extra thick crust which went up the sides of  my spring-form pan. I also ended up adding a lot more butter to the crust, since I had quadruple the amount of crumbs. The addition of the flour and the lack of a water bath worried me, but I stuck with the exact instructions and I am glad I did. If you love cheesecake, make sure you try this recipe. You will love it!!

I put strawberries on top and made the strawberry sauce from this site. Everybody asked me where I bought it. It was seriously amazing and looked fabulous -- this recipe obviously needs no further reviews but I couldn't help it. It deserves it. I used a water bath, left it in the oven for about 3-4 hours after baking and didn't overbeat the ingredients after the egg. I'm gluten free, so I just picked up a Midel GF graham crust, crumbled it and reformed it to my cheesecake pan. I also used GF flour.  Absolute perfection.

I wanted a smaller cheesecake (crazy I know) so I cut the recipe in half. It worked perfectly!  The cheesecake was the perfect texture and I will definitely be making it again.

Perfect classic cheesecake. As another reviewer said, it is a "purist's" cheesecake. I followed the recipe and directions exactly, and it turned out wonderful! Cheesecake Factory, eat your heart out :) We eat it plain or with raspberry sauce and whipped cream.

Excellent. Don't put too much grease in the bottom like I did and keep to the exact serving of butter if you want more crunch to the crust! Awesome and simple recipe.

I've been making this recipe for a year or so now, and unfortunately still haven't perfected it. First time, awesome. Second time, burnt it (ick). Fifth time, tried to do a bath with it to prevent cracking, and the water got through to the cake (more ick). Even after all this time, I still get cracks. However, this is still a yummy recipe, and pretty easy for a beginner like me.  I often pair it with a strawberry sauce recipe as a topping. Overall, good cake, but I'm sure there's something I could do to enhance the flavor just a bit.

Agree with other reviewers that the temp is too high.  Mine was completely set and even puffed up a little before the time was up. The center was great, but the rest of the cake became a little too dry for my taste.  Would reduce temp next time or watch the oven well ahead of time.  Flavor was excellent.

I've made this cheesecake recipe twice now. The 1st time it cracked horribly. I thought I did something wrong, so I decided to give it another whirl. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it still turned out super ugly and cracked. The cheesecake overflowed the spring form pan when I baked it. Either lessen the amount of ingredients listed or include something in the recipe about not pouring the entire bowl of batter in the pan. Also, 15 Graham crackers?! 2 Tbsp of butter?! What?! That makes no sense. Way too much Graham cracker and not nearly enough butter. The crust just falls apart if you follow the recipe, and 15 Graham crackers is too much anyway. I'm still giving this 3 stars because my family did thoroughly enjoyed the actual flavor and texture despite how ugly it was.

SUPER super easy recipe. Not overly sweet..very creamy and dense..not heavy,you can enjoy a normal slice without feeling like you over ate...
Mine cracked, but, that is probably due to being out of practice. DEFINTELY making this again.

Turned out great! It wasn't as "pretty" as I'd have liked (edges browned too much and surface cracked), but the flavor makes up for it. Family dubbed it "restaurant quality".

This cheesecake was so creamy and delicious! I did reduce the Flour to 2 tbsp as recommended and used a water bath as well. I let the cake cool in the oven for an hour after turning it off and then cracked the door for another hour to let it cool more. Then I cooled it on the countertop for an hour before putting it in the refrigerator. I refrigerated the cake for 4 hrs and it was delicious!

I'm a big fan of cheesecake and I'm always looking for an easy recipe and this is a GREAT ONE. This definitely will be the one I continue to use. I gave it the above rating because as said it was easy and the taste was great. The only problem is it cracked after I followed the exact directions.  I don't  know what I did wrong. But it seems every cheesecake I've made it had always cracked in the middle. So for those who want to use this , it's a great recipe. Hopefully yours doesn't crack right in the middle.

I made this recipe for Christmas and it was a fabulous hit! I've made many cheesecakes and this one was by far, the best. I read the various reviews as I always do when trying a new recipe. My advice... make the recipe as instructed! Especially the cooking part of it. LIke someone else said, put it in the oven and LEAVE IT ALONE. Do what the instructions tell you to and your cheesecake will come out perfect. I've always had a problem with cracking and this one didn't AT ALL. I made a blueberry compote topping and again, the cheesecake was a raving success!

The cheesecake looked freat when it came out. The only problem was that when i cut into it the crust crumbled. So it looked like cheesecake filling and crushed graham cracker on the side. But other than that it tasted great. I wish it didnt have to take that long in the oven. Even though it was off. But if that is what it takes for not cracks im good.

WOW! Rich, creamy, outstanding cheesecake. I made this gluten free and lower-fat and got RAVE reviews from the family when I served this at Christmas dinner. My sister-in-law, a professional cook, even asked for the recipe! To accommodate my celiac husband, I substituted GF graham style crackers in the crust and used a GF all-purpose flour mix in the cake. Because I like a "darker" flavor profile, I also used brown sugar instead of white in the crust and about 3 tsp of cinnamon---this gave the crust a nice pop that my guests loved. I used neufchatel cheese, 1% milk, and fat-free sour cream, to reduce calories. Despite this, the cake came out amazingly creamy and rich, with a wonderfully decadent mouthfeel. I would never, ever have guessed that this cheesecake was either GF or lower-fat, if I hadn't made it myself!

Second time making this cheesecake. Never made one before. It is very tasty, everyone loved it, however, and I know it is something I am doing, it has cracked both times. Wonder if I am over mixing? Regardless, still yummy!

I've never made a cheesecake before, but I followed the instructions and tips users wrote in their reviews (including an alternative crust with cinnamon and nutmeg) and it turned out perfectly! Very happy with the taste and texture, and I will be bringing it as my contribution to Christmas dinner this year :-)

This was one of the best cheesecakes that I have ever made or tasted, so I want to thank you for this recipe.    It exceeded my expectations and I will be using it again.  The cheesecake was super smooth and creamy;  and neither too tart nor too sweet.    My family kept raving about it, asking if I made it, as though they were in disbelief that it didn’t come from a bakery.      I did cut down the entire recipe by 1/4th, using only 3 packages of cream cheese; because I was running short on ingredients.   It worked out fine in a 9-inch spring form pan, making the cheesecake about 2.75 inches tall.   The cheesecake was in a water bath while it was baking in the oven to prevent it from cracking or drying.  I also reduced the cooking time to 45 minutes.      When that time was reached, the oven was turned off and the cheesecake was left in it, gradually cooling down.   After a few hours of cooling in the oven, the cheesecake was wrapped in plastic and refrigerated overnight, while still in the spring form pan.   Please note that when the cheesecake was done baking for 45 minutes, the center of it had a slight jiggle, but the sides were firm a few inches deep all the way around it.

The key to baking the perfect cheesecake is to follow the instructions,  spray the sides of the pan to keep it from sticking,  and YOU MUST USE THE HOT WATER BATH! My cheesecakes come out beautifully each time. No cracks and excellent flavor. This time I substituted the vanilla with Amaretto.

This is THE cheesecake recipe. And it's so versatile! I've used it to make pumpkin, strawberry, blueberry and blackberry cheesecakes.  It can be used with a graham cracker crust, an oreo crust, a nut-based crust, anything. I've used this recipe at least 10 times now. It's very difficult to do though. The recipe has to be followed very precisely, the mixing has to be PERFECT (make sure it's smooth as silk), and you absolutely have to leave it alone in the oven (don't check on it!). Also, if you don't have a springform pan, I really wouldn't recommend trying this recipe. It's very difficult without it. Use a water bath if you can manage it. It really helps prevent cracking from temperature variations. Grease the sides of the pan, it prevents cracking. And I personally like to put parchment paper on the base of the springform pan, then put the side on over it, close up the pan, then cut off the excess paper around the sides. This makes it very easy to move it around after you're done.

I have made cheesecake for 4 years and always use this recipe. A friend of mine who usually does not like cheesecake even loves the cheesecake I make!! I usually make half the ingredients and reduce the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup to suit mine and my friends' taste. There's nothing else I could change about it.

I can't get graham crackers where I live, so I substituted it with 250g crushed digestive biscuits and 100g melted butter. I mixed it in a saucepan, pressed it onto the bottom of a cake tin and baked that for 10 minutes before pouring the cheesecake filling in. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was outstanding. I served it at a family dinner and it was extremely well received! 

One small gripe I have about it is that despite switching off the oven and leaving the cake in for a few hours, my cake still cracked in the middle. Think that may have been due to insufficient buttering of the sides of the tin so I might try that in future. One of my aunts also felt that it was a little on the sweet side, so I might reduce the sugar to 1-1/3 cup in future. But if you follow the recipe exactly, the results will be fantastic, as good as if not better than any store-bought cheesecake!

So easy and delicious! I put in 2 tablespoons of flour instead of 1/4 cup and it was awesome. So creamy and smooth. I also ran a knife around the edge after it was done baking and put it back into the oven with the door ajar to let cool for about an hour. Then straight to the fridge and I unlocked the spring form pan and no cracks. Thanks for posting. I will be making this wonderful cheesecake again! :)

It's good but I wouldn't say it's the perfect cheesecake. I've made it twice now and both times, it has really cracked. Not that I care if it cracks, but if you follow the recipe perfectly, it will crack. Now to me the flavor is the more important part of these cheesecake and it is in this area that I find this recipe lacking. I wish it was a more creamy texture. The second time I made the cheesecake I did cut back on the flour (used about 1/8 cup), and decreased eggs. I also added sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust. These were good variations but still is just isn't quite as creamy of a cheesecake as I'd like. I'd say it almost reminds me more of a custard. I may try the recipe again and cut out an entire egg. Another note: it must cool all the way and be refrigerated for several hours! The first time I made it my S/O convinced me we should try it early (had been in over for about 5 hours but not in fridge for very long), the consistency was completely off! We were both disappointed. The next morning his son grabbed a piece and said how good it was, so we tried it again, it was a night and day difference! We vowed never to rush it again.

The good: beautiful, creamy texture and flawless instructions so it baked up beautifully with no cracks in sight.  The bad: total sugar bomb.  1-1/2 c of sugar and a full tablespoon of vanilla was too much for me.  The only change I made was adding the zest of a whole lemon.

Love this recipe!!! This is now one of my favorite cheesecake recipes. I made this for a celebration, and every piece of that cake was gone! I even have request for it afterwards. I suggest you try this recipe because it's just that amazing!! My cheesecake cracked but that was my fault. I just plopped some whip cream on top and it was good as new!

My cheesecake rose about two inches while cooking then fell flat in the center. The edges were too dark for my taste. It did not look appetizing.

Have made this recipe several times.  Once use it to made cheesecake bites. Used a cookie sheet and reduced the cook time to about 20min. Had alot going on so didnt have time to let it cool in the oven for 5 hours so I took it out, let it coll on the counter for 45min and put the whole sheet in the freezer.  After it was frozen cut it into squares and wrapped in in shrink wrap. They were AMAZING!!! Perfect for bites and to dip in choise toppings.

I made Chantal's recipe many times over and it never failed me, I've even made it for a resturant and they served it! If I could I'd give it a Michelin star! My guests will give it 5 more stars.

A few years ago I tried this cheesecake as my first ever cheesecake attempt. I failed. I've been jinxed ever since and have FUBARed every cheesecake I try, but today I revisited this recipe and used a few tips I found throughout my cheesecake failures... And... It came out perfect!! I am so relieved and thrilled! Things I did differently this time: 
-let ingredients come to room temperature, not cold out of the fridge. 
-Water bath - if you don't know what it is you should google it! 
-Allow the cake to cool at least 1 hr in the oven, turned off, don't ever open the door! Allow to cool a few more hours on the counter before refrigerating, it won't crack! :) also don't take the spring form off until its cool.
Thanks so much for the great recipe I hope my tips can help the other cheesecake novices!

This cheesecake is possibly the best cheesecake ever! People that had issues with it's texture, or to dry, or to brown, or cracking, you are doing it wrong!

I want to first start off with saying, you HAVE to have  room temp ingredients. Don't over mix, actually I don't even use a mixer at all. I do everything by hand. I recommend not using the amount of flour it calls for (1/4 cup ?) I only used 1 tbs or you could not use any. Also I only add 2 tbs of milk. The sour cream gives it plenty of moisture all ready. 

Always use a water bath! Wrap the spring form pan in tin foil + a turkey bag. Some water still might seep in but it will evaporate if you stick it in a low temp oven for about 10 min after it's done. Don't RUSH it! I set my oven about 15 degrees below what it recommends ( My oven cooks hot) let it cook for the hour, shut off the oven, and let it do it's thing. 

Don't peak, look, or even stare at it! Let it sit for as long as humanly possible. Stick it in the fridge for min of 12 hours and I PROMISE you will have the best cheesecake you, your family, and friends have ever had!

This was my first time making a New York Cheesecake and it turned out great.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I just made sure the ingredients were at room temperature and did not over mix.  I didn't have any foil to wrap the bottom of the springform pan so I just put a small pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake pan and it turned out wonderful with no cracks in it. I baked it for 1 hour and then left it in the oven for 4 hours. Once it cooled I then refrigerated it. The family said it was the best cheesecake they had ever ate.  This will be my go to recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

My best friend and I tried this recipe. It was... ok. We are not by any means professional bakers, so I'm sure we made some rookie mistake (like over beating the cream cheese, which I saw in the comments). However, the graham cracker crust I felt was too dry and needed more butter to hold it together. Also, the cooking time recommended burnt our cake! :-( Our cake did NOT crack, though! We cooked it for the recommended 1 hour at 350, then let it sit for 5.5 hours. The cake itself was a bit gritty (over whipping, I guess) and lacked flavor. We topped with strawberries but I think the overcooking really just killed it.

I had tried several slices of the famous New York - style cheesecake before trying to make it myself. I had even tried a couple of cheesecakes while in NYC. Since I'm from abroad, I was reluctant to try to make this at home, but after coming back from New York we decided there was no way we were going to get that same taste/creamyness/quality here in cafes/restaurants in Spain. Therefore, i decided to look for a recipe to make it myself at home, and we bumped into this one.
I decided to give it a try with light cream cheese and a lot more crust. The result? Heaven on Earth. 
The only downside to this recipe is that the baking temperature might be too high. I just made my second cheesecake, this time following the recipe to a tee and it's still too brown on the top for my taste. So i guess that baking with a lower oven temp could do the trick, or maybe even lowering the rack a bit.
Still...i give this a 5 star!!! We will never buy cheesecake here again!
This recipe is fool-proof if you:
-use good quality ingredients
- have all ingredients at room temp
-use a huge mixing bowl
-leave it in the oven to cool down (4-5hours) before chilling it in the fridge
the steps are better explained in Chef's john's version but this is the recipe I followed so this is the one I'm rating.
I have yet to try the water bath (bain Marie)
If you want an easy, heavenly cheese cake recipe, THIS IS IT!
Mine didn't crack!

I followed the recipe exact and it came out wonderful. Everyone thought the cake came from a bakery. It wasn't overly sweet like some cheesecakes can be. This tastes how a cheesecake should!

Hands Down...best cheesecake I have ever made.  I will never use another recipe!  The only change I make, and I found this out by accident....I no longer add the flour, leave this out!!  The texture will be perfect, not heavy, and no cracking!

I have failed 2 times before success~ I follow every steps on the1st time, and it crack. I add a tray of water on the bottom rack, and it crack again, but smaller crack~ now I have to lower the oven to 300F°, and bake for 90 minutes, and place the foil wrapped baking pan in a larger baking pan filled with water, than leave it in the oven for 6 hours.  I finally success!

LOVE LOVE LOVE CHEESECAKE AND THIS RECIPE IS THE BOMB DIGGIDY. It's important to follow the recipe because substituting for reduced fat cheese causes the cake to be more pudding-like. I've also used a waterbath a couple of times.

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake, it did crack in the baking process (after reading reviews probably due to slight over beating) but I didn't mind too much bc I covered it with a berry glaze anyway ;) Turned out awesome! Thanks for the great recipe!

Although the taste is excellent but a bit creamy for our taste, I could not in good conscience give it five stars because the batter is way off ratio. As another reviewer said, there is enough for two 9-inch cake. The temperature is also too hot. At 150C, my cake still burnt a bit. It will probably be badly burnt if I went with the recommended temperature of 175C. For people who want a cheesecake not that moist, I suggest at least doubling the flour. Oh, and I cut the sugar to 120g instead of the 300g called for. It felt too excessive and may cover the cheese taste.

Our cheesecake turned out perfect! My daughter helped. We started out with room temp ingredients and were careful not to "over mix " . My oven runs hot, so we decreased the temp to 325. Other than that, the hardest part was waiting for it to cool and chill before eating. SO, we had cheesecake for breakfast. :)   I used the Supreme Strawberry Topping recipe from this site to make strawberry and blueberry toppings. I am so pleased with how well this cheesecake turned out!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It had so many great reviews I chose it for my mothers birthday cake without even trying it. I thought it was very bland. It could have used more sugar definitely. The only part I liked was the crust (which I used a modification for).

Made it for the first time for my friend's graduation. Came out pretty well, I didn't use a water bath or use the flour (because I ran out). Therefore, it cracked but it didn't matter b/c I improvised and used the leftover of my sour cream to cover it. I had 8 oz left and I added 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. However, it wasn't enough so I suggest doubling that. For the blueberry sauce, I put a pint of blueberries, 2 tablespoons sugar, and a lemon zested and juiced into a small saucepan on medium heat. Then I simmered it for 5 minutes and waited for it to cool. It was simple and my friends and family loved it.

This recipe is amazing. I've made it so many times, and it's time for me to leave a review with my 2 cents. 
Firstly, the ingredients should all be at room temperature, they're easier to mix if they are. I use only a tablespoon of flour, and I sieve so there are no lumps. A water bath should be used, I just stuck a pan of hot water underneath and it works the same way. 
Don't overbake, or it will crack and have this strange lumpy texture when eating. Leave it to cool in the oven when the centre is still a little jiggly, as residual heat in the cheesecake will cook it through.
I also used 1/3 of the recipe, which made 12 perfect mini cheesecakes (18 minutes in oven).
So delicious, thanks so much for sharing!! Will never use another baked cheesecake recipe ever again.

This is the best NY style cheesecake recipe I have ever tried!  I followed the suggestions of others such as room temperature cream cheese to start and leaving the cake in the oven to cool off and to avoid cracks.  I didn't agree with some reviews that adding the flour made it taste "cakey".  I will be making this one again and again!

This is the only cheesecake recipe I've used the past 6 years. My family thinks I'm the cheesecake queen because of it. My tips: make sure all ingredients are room temp before mixing to get the right consistency. Use a water bath. Add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust.

The cheesecake itself is awesome. Great taste and perfect texture. I added a little bit of lemon zest and that was delicious. My only problem with this recipe is the crust. 15 graham crackers and 2 tablespoons of butter? Really? That doesn't make a crust, it makes crumbs. You need less graham crackers or more butter or both if you want the crumbs to stick together into something resembling a crust. Tweak the crust for sure. Otherwise, the cake is a hit!

My only issue with the recipe was I had little light brown lumps in my batter.  This happened twice.  My cream cheese was super soft.  I think this happened after I added the vanilla and flour.  Anyone else have this issue or have suggestions?

This was the first cheesecake Ive ever made.  I love my cheesecake heavy and dry.  The kind that you really have to use your lips to get off the fork all the way.... this recipe delivered!  It is thick and rich and not too sweet!  However, my cake did "fall and crack".... but I dont care about that.  Im not sure where I went wrong but seriously, when it tastes this good, who cares??????

Easy as pie...follow recipe, put in 350 oven for 1 hour, cut off oven and leave for 4 hours and DON'T OPEN DOOR. The cheese cake was wonderful, texture was great.I did wrap the cake in Saran wrap when I refrigerated it. When I made the cake again, I added 1/4 cup of sugar in crust. No cracks in cakes and tasted better than any cheesecake you could buy. Have no fear, this is a great recipe.

Terrific! This recipe is amazing! Followed it to the tee. I've also used this recipe to make mini cheesecake bites. When making the bites you have to make more crust (about double) to account for how many bites the cheesecake batter makes

This was first time making a cheesecake of any flavor and my family says it was a homerun! My son wanted a New York cheesecake for his 18th birthday, and I like trying new recipes, so I looked one up and it looked easy, so I tried it.  However, mine did crack, and sink a little.  Still it tasted delicious!!

With the exception of adding some sugar to the crust, I followed the directions...it was great!! Mine cracked during the cooling stage inside the oven, no biggie to me. If you like NY style cheesecake I highly recommend.

I am a cheesecake fanatic and for years have been making Lindy's New York Cheesecake. Only problem I had was consistency in the results. I followed most of this recipe except I used heavy cream instead of milk and I also add orange zest from one orange. I like a nice smooth creamy texture and not too dense (dry as one review state LAURELC43 has a very good review except I was trying to get away  from the long cooking time.). When mine came out this way it was to die for according to many of my friends and family and church family. 
     The thing I find about this recipe is it is almost foolproof. I baked at 350 for 1 hour but let sit in oven without opening door for 3 hours. Also, I might cut the flour down to 2 TBLS like she did. you could see how it firmed up but did not get dense and was really creamy. I hesitate to even try 5-6 hours as stated in original recipe.
    A few things I have found are, make sure cream cheese is soft. I usually make mine in late afternoon after cream cheese has been sitting out all day. Then put in oven and take out when time for bed and put in fridge. I also found a lot of people who don't like the actual taste of cream cheese tasting cheesecake actually prefer the orange zest or maybe even lemon.

Like all other reviews, this is the best cheesecake, foolproof recipe, you'll ever find. I did not have enough time to let mine sit in an oven so I pulled it out about an hour after baking and put it in the refrigerator. It did crack as I did not do it the right way. But to me - who cares!!! Cover those cracks with some berries. I combined cut up strawberries, blueberries and raspberries in a bowl and tossed with about 2-3 tablespoons  strawberry glaze, just enough to coat the berries. Glaze can be found where the strawberries are in the supermarket. I also doubled the graham crackers and butter for a thicker crust.

My cheesecake turned out completely awful. Okay, that's a half truth. The cheesecake itself tasted heavenly, but it wont be winning any beauty pageants anytime soon. I'll accent Morena's statement---the destruction of my cheesecake was my own doing. This was my very first attempt at making cheesecake that didn't come from a box (I hate those so very much, but it was what I had been accustomed to). That alone makes it special. I lacked the springform pan (again, all my fault), but all hope wasn't completely lost. There were cracks and at first it seemed mushy in the middle, but after placing it in the freezer for a few hours, it pulled together and tastes amazing. It was thicker than I imagined it would be, and my family loved it. This was only a prototype---one that will be made again and again. Five stars!

I made this cheesecake for Easter and it was very simple to put together. However, I was unsure of the amount of graham crackers to use. It states fifteen, but is it fifteen whole crackers or what!? I used fifteen whole with the recommended amount of butter and it just wasn't a good crust once baked. I would alter the crust ingredients next time. My cheesecake also cracked although I followed the instructions

I wished I would have read the bad reviews before I invested in this recipe. It cracked, turned brown on top and there was no way I could have left it in a semi-hot oven for 5-6 hours. This recipe also made way more than I needed for a 9" pie plate - don't have a spring form pan. I had the 10" pie, and 5 ramekins of cake! The taste is okay - nothing special in the least.

I made this cheesecake one time before, first time was with a good processor. No air bubbles anywhere, it was the best darned cheesecake I've ever had in my life. (I don't like cheesecake so says a lot) exactly what a few offer people are saying, I used a sporting form pan, set the oven to 350, turned it off and left out to just do it's thing. It came out absolutely perfect. The second time I made it I was drunk. Really drunk. When I woke up and my hangover finally left me, I tried the creation yet again and it was just as delicious. (I followed the recipe to the T) it was just as perfect. THAT being said, this is the simplest, most delicious cheese you will ever make. Honestly though, follow the recipe, don't check it, leave all the hot air in, if you must, peek at it through the oven when you turn it off but DON'T TOUCH IT. Leave it there for 5 hours at least and you will be very happy.

i've made this twice so far. the first time i followed the directions exactly. 2nd time... few minor changes (reduced the amount of flour and attempted to use a water bath). both times it had turned dark brown on 75% of the top of the cake. also the texture isn't that great and it is a bit eggy tasting, but other then that taste is fine.

i was hoping the water bath would help with the browning but no go on that. but i'm not highly experienced in cheesecake making either and i am still learning this part of the cooking world. but following these instructions exactly has not worked.

Oh no, mine totally cracked! I don't care though because it tasted so good and rich. My husband and I didn't even want to share with friends because it was so good. (We did share though, because we are nicer than that) I would make this recipe over and over again.

I have used this as a base cheesecake for lots of different things.  One that is never-fail with my friends is this: make the crust as usual. Mix the cheesecake mixture as directed. Pour part of mixture over crust. Flip out a frozen pecan pie over cheesecake mixture. Cover with remaining cheesecake mixture. Top with Chocolate Ganache (1 12 oz. dark chocolate chips, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1 cup heavy cream; heat cream to near boiling, pour over chips, add vanilla, mix until smooth. Pour over cooled cheesecake; top with chopped pecans.

Great recipe. I baked it in a pan of water which lets it heat and cool slowly, preventing cracking. Folks make a big deal if it cracks. Put some cherry pie filling over the cracks and enjoy. I won't tell. Still tastes great.

This is a good cheesecake! Easy too. I always do the crust with boxed breadcrumbs, butter, sugar and a little cinnamon. As for the "cheese" part-- omg! Yummy!!!! I was horrified I forgot the flour completely until it was in the oven. Made no difference at all. After the hour of cook time, I turned off the oven and let it sit in there for a few hours. Then put it in the fridge overnight. I got up to a chilled, beautiful cheesecake. My husband said it tastes like it's from an upscale bakery! Make this recipe!!!

This makes a LARGE cheesecake.  I too modified the crust to include sugar and cinnamon and it turned out great.  Make this cake the day before, as it takes all day to cool in the oven and then a few hours to completely chill.  It was a hit with my family!!

Made this cake for my friends birthday. I never liked the taste of cheesecake but decided to give it a try again and I really liked it. It helps if you put the cake pan in a larger cake pan with water it prevents it from cooing too fast and keeps the cake moist. If you are using a spring form like I did just cover the bottom weigh foil so water doesn't get in it. I also replaced the graham cracker with Oreos. I put the entire Oreo with the cream (regular not double stuffed) and put it in a food processor to crush it and continued with the rest of the recipe. (I used an entire pack of Oreos for the crust)

Made this cheesecake for my daughter's birthday.  Was not a huge fan, in fact the cheesecake cracked severely and raised above the spring form pan.  My son, who likes everything, commented he thought I had used light cream cheese, which I hadn't.  Will not make this again

I made cheesecake for the 1st time and used this recipe. It was great, will for sure make again. Only change I made was used 1-1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs and baked for 65 minutes in bath water. There was not one crack on the top. This will for sure be my go to cheesecake recipe.

I really wanted to like this recipe. I read and followed the recipe word for word. I used room-temperature ingredients, mixed with a wooden spoon being careful not to over-mix.  The cheesecake turned out to be dense and dry and had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  I hate to give a recipe only 1 star but it just didn't work for me.

I had never made a cheesecake in my life until I tried this recipe for a New Years Day dessert.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out PERFECTLY - like the large, dense and creamy cheesecakes you'd get from a deli or bakery.  I urge anyone considering this recipe to go ahead and make it, following the directions as written and keeping the oven door closed during those critical post-baking hours.. You will be glad you did.

Ok, so I've compiled a lot of the reviewers changes and loved the cheesecake from this recipe: 1) allow ingredients to come to room temp, 2) modified crust (1 1/2 cups crumbled gram cracker, 1/4 teasp ground nut meg, 1/2 teasp cinnamon, 3 teasp melted butter and 1/4 cup fine chopped walnuts), 3) grease the pan and bake in over and leave in there 5-6 hours or overnight to avoid cracking. SO DELICIOUS!!! I made little cheese cake cup cakes and bake ~40min

So perfect!  I did the recipe in half and used a smaller springform pan.  So rich and creamy and also very easy.  No cracks just beautiful.  i topped mine with chocolate ganache.  Will definately make this again.

Great recipe, very easy to follow. Everyone raved about it. One woman said it was the best cheesecake she has ever had (and she is in her 60's) My only question is what is meant by "15 Graham Crackers". They come in crackers about 2 1/2" x 5". Is that 2 crackers or 1? I used about 14 of these and it seemed like a LOT, so I only used about 2/3 of the mixture and the crust turned out just fine, not too thick, not too thin. So do these need to be broken in half before counting them? I couldn't even tell from the video what to do, so if I used twice as many crackers as I needed, then I only used half the needed butter for the amount of crackers I used. Other than this question the recipe was very clear and concise! 
Oh, and the top of the cake cracked (a big "X" shaped crack) despite leaving it in the oven to cool without opening the door. Next time I may put a pan of water on a lower rack to fix this, but the cracked surface didn't affect the quality or taste of the cake, so no biggy!

I made this exactly as written. It made a LOT of batter for the size pan called out in the recipe, over-browned on the top, cracked horribly - even before I turned the oven off, and was a bit dry. Made a blueberry sauce to serve over it once plated, which helped with the presentation and moisture. I think I'll keep looking for that perfect cheesecake recipe.....

I have been using this recipe for years.  I absolutely love it.  I also Have to agree.  If yours isn't coming out right you are doing do in something I make sure you don't just throw all the ingredients together and start blending.  Blend out the cream cheese till smoothe. If you follow correctly it will not crack.  Alternately you can bake it for about half way then drop the temp and adjust to bake longer at a lower temp.  I don't always let it sit for the 6 hours but I will at least a couple. Either way.  AMAZING recipe.

I have made this three times now. It tastes great, and is fairly easy to make. I have a couple of comments though. First of all, I always end up with too much batter to go in the pan (using a full sized Nordic ware spring form pan). When the recipe says "15 graham crackers" do they mean the large rectangular graham crackers that are made up of several sections? I usually use 12 that size. Also, my cheesecakes always crack no matter how carefully I follow the directions. I am not sure what I could do to prevent this.

This was my first attempt at cheesecake.  The taste and texture were excellent although it did crack.  It was for a birthday and I just explained the crack in the middle was the chinese symbol for her age!  Next time may try the water bath.

The cheesecake tasted great but after an hour of cooking it was not done and still soft in the center.  When we cut into it the center was runny - it was quite embarrassing!  Next time I'm making the crust twice as thick and cooking this longer.

DELICIOUS. I still had trouble with the top cracking, but I can chalk that up to a combo of not greasing the sides enough, not letting set long enough, over mixing the batter, or high altitude. At the end of the day it was a THICK, RICH, DELICIOUS cheesecake. Only thing I wasn't sure about is the crust makes a very thick crust and I don't think I even used all of the graham cracker because my pan wasn't tall enough to hold that much crust plus the cheese part, but everything tasted GREAT!

UPDATE:
Making this again... what did I do wrong?! I should have followed a different recipe for the crust since 15 crackers is WAY too much. Also, now my cheesecake is overflowing ... I'm using the same pan as last time so what went wrong?! I'm sure it will taste great, it's just ugly as heck.

I'm 65 years old and have been a cheesecake fanatic my whole life.  This is unequivocally the BEST Cheesecake recipe EVER...  It's easy, and quick (except waiting the 5-6 hours).  I will never make another cheesecake recipe again; this is my go-to.  That being said, I've just finished making one and used gingersnaps for the crust ( added a bit more butter than called for) and subbed a cup of ricotta for one of the cream cheese bars.  Did the same last time.  I was concerned about the overflow aspect and added a collar of foil.  Not needed - and nothing burned.  I must agreee with Morena - If it fails you it's not the recipe's fault.  The consistency was outstanding - nothing cracked.  I did appreciate the waterbath mention.  I think that goes a long way in preventing the cracking as well.  This one will be out Christmas Dinner dessert and I can't wait.  Thanks VERY MUCH Taliesen

I've made this twice, the first time with the original graham cracker crust and the one I made for Thanksgiving had an Oreo cookie crust. The only other changes I made included adding more vanilla extract and using cake flour instead of regular all purpose flour. The cheesecake tasted amazing. Both my boyfriend and his mom were shocked by how good it was! I'm going to take that as a compliment. :-)

I don't like cheesecake at all, but someone requested I make it. I made half a recipe for a 6" pan, and actually ended up forgetting the vanilla and flour. The requester still loved it anyways. I broiled it for a bit after it was done baking to get a brown top. It did sink a bit but fruit fixes that.

My sister in law challenged me to bake the best cheesecake ever. And I found it. This cake was light, fluffy, and the height on it was spectacular. I love this recipe, but I love winning the cheesecake war even more.

I tried to make this today. Followed the ingredients to a T and my cheesecake doubled over above the springform sides. I cut the top off and started baking it again because the middle wasn't cooked and it's rising again. I'm not sure why it is doing this but I'm not very happy with the recipe

This is absolutely the best cheesecake recipe.  The only thing that I do differently is wrapping my springform pan in extra large, heavy duty foil and place it in a bain marie (water bath) for even baking, which help prevent cracking.  You have to be careful when placing the springform pan in a bain marie or else you can end up with a soggy crust. Prepare the bain marie before you transfer any of the batter to ensure that your springform pan does not have any leaks.  MORENA's suggestions are also extremely helpful.  My cheesecakes have never failed.

This recipe is so amazing!!!! I made it with my dad for my birthday and it was the best cheesecake ever!!!! It did not have any problems making it and it cracked a little bit but it was probably because the climate that I am in. I would also probably add a dash of cinnamon to the crust and maybe some nutmeg too. just adds a little bit of spice.

I  made this recipe for my daughter's birthday,  first homemade cheesecake I  have ever made.  It was a hit,  turned out beautiful looking and tasted great. It made 2 cheesecakes and only 1 had a small crack.  If anyone wants to make one i would suggest this recipe.

I tried this recipe. omitted the flour as suggested by other user. also didnt use bain marie. I also halved the recipe since i was making for just the two of us. The cake was cooked thoroughly but was very very dense. The cake had initially sunk in the middle, but upon remaining in the oven for 4 hours it had settled nicely. The cake had browned a lot on the outside to my liking. My hubby loves cheesecake, he didnt even comment on it. :'(

I served with the raspberry puree as suggested by someone. the ONLY highlight of the preparation.

Incredible! i only had two 8"x8" pans (the given recipe filled them nicely). the pan that was on the top rack had a more toasted top and a less creamy texture but the bottom one was absolutely perfect! great recipe and tips in the reviews

This is my second time making this cheesecake.  I followed the directions exactly and both times, no cracks. This time I topped it with cherry pie filling and entered it in a office bake-off.  It won first prize.  If you follow the directions exactly you will have an outstanding cheesecake.

I have been using this recipe for years! If I am having a get-together and my nephews don't want to come, I tell them aww too bad you can't make it, I am making cheesecake ... they cancel their other plans just to get a piece of this cheesecake! I bake it different than the instructions, if I bake it the entire hour it dries out, I shut the oven off after 40 minutes and let it sit in the oven for 8 hours and it comes out perfect every time. Using all ingredients at room temperature makes a big difference, and I fold ingredients by hand starting at the sour cream step. This recipe is also perfect for adding different ingredients lik eoreos, pecans, heath bars, just about anything to make a custom cheesecake!

This was a great cheesecake.  Followed recipe exactly and baked it with a pan of water on the shelf below. Kept it in oven for several hours after turning off and it never cracked and was done perfectly.  This is definitely a keeper

Followed the recipe exactly and used a water bath for my cheesecake. Immediately after the hour I ran a knife around the edges to separate the cake from the pan to avoid cracking. I let it cool in the oven for several hours and then refrigerated a few more. The result was a perfect cheesecake that no one can resist!

this was flavorful, thick but light! It didn't crack. I turned off oven at 1 hr and left it in the oven at least 5 hours after that fact.  Removed it covered it and placed in fridge! Rave reviews at the office today!

My cheesecakes always crack, but it is delicious! I swirled in cherry pie filling this time, and that worked very well. I think it is a great, thick recipe with plenty of flavor, and it is easy to add other flavors.

Okay, so here's why things could have gone wrong:

I'm in a country that doesn't sell good cream cheese.

I was using disposable foil loaf tins.

I was using a tiny, cheap toaster oven.

And guess what, perfect, creamy, uncracked cheesecake. So delicious, really does taste like what you get in a cafe. And it looks such a lovely pale, even color... I was sure it woudln't work given the circumstances, but the recipe was too good :)

I didn't put my foil loaf pans in a water bath because there wasn't room, but I left the cookie tray that came with the toaster oven on the shelf below the rack the cheesecakes were on, and filled it with water. I don't know it it helped, but I didn't get a single crack. I did leave them to cool in the oven, and well-greased the pans with pam spray.

Now I can't help but cut myself a slice every few hours... mmm..

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made and I have to say that I did fallow all instructions and left the cake in the oven for the full six hours to cool after baking and it did sink about a quarter of an inch... other then that I will add that if you are using a gas oven you will want to preheat oven at 350 and then lower the heat to 300 for the one hour bake time or it will burn. Gas cooks differently then electric ovens.  It's a beautiful recipe and very tasty, I might add my cake did not crack and I did substitute the cream cheese for plain white yogurt.  Thank you and I will try this recipe again. Rose

OK, so I made this last-minute - didn't let the ingredients come entirely up to room temp, and probably overbeat because of it.  The top cracked a little bit.  But who cares?  This cheesecake is the BOMB.  And it is super-easy, too.  The hardest thing about this (well two things) is remembering to take all the ingredients out of the fridge long enough to make it to room temperature, and not opening the oven while it's cooling.  Seriously, I turned on the oven light and peeked through the glass at one hour, and it looked slumped in the middle.  I kept the faith and turned off the oven.  When I looked through the glass at three hours, the cake had risen over the pan.  When I opened up the oven and pulled it out after eight hours, it was PERFECT.  Oh, and don't forget the water bath - I couldn't find my 12X18 cake pan, so I used a very large skillet, heated some water in my teapot, and poured it about halfway up the side of the pan (wrapped in foil, of course).  I also added a little bit of lemon and orange zest to the batter, and it tastes SO GOOD.  This will be my new go-to cheesecake recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I have made many cheesecakes over the yrs and this one is by far the best one I have ever made. I slightly change part of the recipe to have a chocolate layer. Before starting your cheesecake batter, melt 3 oz of good dark chocolate 55%. Let it cool. After you make the cheesecake batter, pour half the batter into another bowl about 4 cups, set aside. Pour in the cooled melted cooled chocolate into the mixing bowl. Mix just until all the chocolate is incorporated. Pour the chocolate cheesecake batter into prepared pan, then the remaining cheesecake batter you set aside onto the chocolate batter. Bake as directed. The key to your cheesecake not cracking on top is not the amount of time left in the oven, but in greasing the sides of the spring form pan, this is a must! I use butter. You can leave the cheesecake in the oven for the amount of time after cooking as the recipe states though if you are not sure if its baked fully. I then made a chocolate ganache with 12oz dark chocolate 55% and 1 cup 35% cream. Bring the cream to just a boil and then stir into your chocolate. I use Valrhona chocolate disks and have no need to chop up the chocolate with these but you might need to do it if you use something else. When the ganache has cooled, it will thicken as it cools down, start in the middle of your cheesecake, pour the ganache and let it spread. Go slowly. Chill cheesecake and enjoy!

I made this recipe today for the first time and my husband and I LOVED it!!  The only thing I improvised was the crust, as graham crackers and butter seemed a little bland to me.  For the crust I used: 1 1 /2 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. finely chopped Unsalted nuts (walnuts, pecans), 6 tbsp. melted butter, 1 tsp. cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg...and it was amazing. We don't have a convection oven, so I had to bake the cheesecake for an hour and a half instead of an hour.  I put it in a water bath on the middle oven rack and after an hour and a half I turned the oven off and left the door open.  I let the cheesecake sit in the oven for one hour and then put it in the fridge uncovered (so it didn't condensate).  There was absolutely no cracking or browning at all! I'm really not sure how people got weird results with this recipe, ours was absolutely perfect.  Wow!! I will make this for every event from now on!

first time making a cheesecake and everyone enjoyed it!! I did do the tips others have left on here like the water bath and turning the oven off after the 60 min but leaving the cheesecake inside, although i only did that for 2 hrs then i put it in the fridge, it still came out amazing!

First, this is the best recipe!! I have made this many times and I have never had a crack. The only difference to the recipe is that I use 3 tbsp. cornstarch instead of flour, and yes, having ingredients at room temp is important, also stirring in ingredients keeps it nice and dense. I put my pan on a cookie sheet, but not a hot water bath, bake it at 350 for 15 minutes then turn the oven to 200 for 2 hours. After the 2 hours, run a sharp knife around the  cake to loosen it from pan sides very carefully and then turn oven off for 2 hours. Remove cake from oven and let cool before putting in frig. Oh, and a little lemon extract or fresh grated lemon peel to the batter doesn't hurt either!! Yum!!

I followed the recipe exactly - used room temp ingredients, greased the sides of the pan, didn't overmix, didn't touch oven door - and it still had a massive crack on top. Looked like an earthquake fissure. However, it was still yummy. I like a slightly creamier cheesecake so taking off one star for that (and the crack). I would still make this again. I might bake it at 325 rather than 350. Also, I made a delicious raspberry sauce for it and the tart sauce went perfectly with the rich cheesecake.

I have to rate the recipe with 5 stars because it came out perfect. If anything, I would change some of the ingredients. I usually like the taste that sweetened condensed milk gives a cheesecake so I was looking for a different taste/texture. I think the flour is what gave it a different texture. Even though it wasn't exactly what taste I was looking for, this cheesecake was profound. I used a water bath of about 1 inch and let it cool in the oven for about 3-4 hours with the door closed. The temp I used was 10 degrees less since I know my oven cooks a little fast. Made my own strawberry topping and it was delish! If only it was a little sweeter, and a little more dense.

Great recipe!! This was my first ever cheesecake from scratch. It turned out pretty well. I felt the graham cracker crust needed more than 2 tbsp butter so I add 4 total. I also left it in the oven for 2.5 hours and it formed perfectly. I also did a water bath as I had seen suggested on a "The Chew" episode last week. I will definitely make again.

My advanced foods class tried this recipe.  We LOVED it!  The flavor was just right and the recipe is very easy to follow and fits nicely into a 85-minute time slot.  I adjusted the recipe to half (6 servings) to save on lab costs.  We used muffin tins to make individual cakes rather than larger springform pans (don't forget to use paper liners if you use muffin tins!).  The cakes baked in about 28 minutes.  Students made fruit toppings while their cakes baked.

Okay maybe this review is a little early but I will update it if I change my mind later. I have never made a cheesecake before that wasn't a "Jello" box made one, so I really have no experience on it and I haven't tried it yet as it is still cooling in the oven.  But I would like to say that I feel the directions for this cake is lacking.  Followed the directions exactly and the cake cracked really badly in the center and out to the sides.  My batter was also a bit lumpy when I made it.  I also felt that the crust need about another 2 or 3 tablespoons of melted butter in it to really shape nicely to the pan, but I just followed the directions still.  However, I apparently needed to read some of the reviews before making this because there were some helpful hints that could have prevented my problems.  The water bath suggestions, making sure that your ingredients are all at room temperature before mixing, and others who have also said to add more butter to the crust mix.  I feel that if these are the things that should be done when making this recipe then they should be in the directions.  But it was very easy to make.  So once this has been taste tested and I may try this recipe again using some of the hints found in the reviews, and if they work I will update my review.  But for now I am not ecstatic about it.

The cheesecake it self was very delicious and easy to make.  My problem was the amount of cream cheese I had to use. The recipe said it's for 1-9 inch pan, which is not true. I had to use 3-9 inch pans. I made it for Christmas and it was a hit, but I was left with three cheesecake. Therefore I gave my neighbor some. I also did not leave it in the oven for 5-6 hours. I took it out immediately and let it cool, then refrigerate. It was perfect!

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made and it was perfect. It could have come from a professional kitchen. I substituted Splenda for 3/4 cup of the sugar and it was still fabulous. You can't go wrong if you simply follow the instructions.

I'm new to making cheesecake, this was my first. I ran to the store to pick up the ingredients, along with a springform pan! When I opened the pan, I pulled out the cardboard with the NordicWare logo, flipped it over to see if there was a recipe, and I kid you not, this EXACT recipe was on the back! Somebody swiped a recipe! Anyway, overall the flavor is pretty good. I didn't know anything about over beating the ingredients. I did it all with a hand mixer. I had a crack in the top, probably an inch deep and 3" long. Maybe from the fact that it rose high above the edge of the pan while baking? I don't know. It did settle back down though. I also didn't care for the crust. I used 15 sheets of graham cracker. Put in the 2T of melted butter. That didn't seem to do anything so I added another 2T & that helped it to hold its shape a little bit. It seemed like a lot of crust, but I used it. Pushed it up the sides of the pan about 2 finger widths high. When we pulled edge of the pan off, the crust had browned & changed flavor. It was ok-but Ill be looking for a new crust recipe. The top half of the cheesecake had also browned around the edges and was not very pretty. I let it set in the oven for a few hours. The crack was already there when it came out. I'm rating it 4 stars for the flavor. Given I didn't use a water bath or anything, I'm sure a lot of the mistakes are my fault, plus nearly 4,000 people can't be wrong. I will be making this again & trying the tips in the reviews.

This is the best recipe for cheesecake.  Every one has loved it and I have even made a little money on the side by selling a couple. I made one for Christmas without the crust and placed it on a layer of red velvet cake and frosted it with cream cheese frosting (homemade) and it was wonderfull and pretty inside and out! Like other people have said, do not over mix or it will be more likely to crack, also I bake mine in a water bath so it bakes evenly.

We loved this. Due to probably my own error, it sank a bit (and was a little too mushy when done) but over the next two days it firmed up well. We used some leftover sour cream, vanilla and sugar as a 'topping' (got the idea from a magazine) and put it on the cheesecake 10 minutes before pulling it out. It was wonderful. Topped it with cherries and called it a day!

The rating is based on my 2nd attempt.  After reading a review that said this was foolproof, I followed the directions to a "T" and the results matched  a second review, very overdone.  My 2nd attempt was to reduce the temperature to 325 and use a water bath and it came out perfectly.  I always like to follow a recipe exactly the first time but not all ovens are alike.  Still have to trust your own eyes and ALWAYS use a water bath.  Happy cooking!

Tasty.  I admit I could not wait the full time for keeping the cake in the oven.  I had to get other dishes in to cook.  It did crack, but I didn't care because it was just for me and my husband and kid.  I think in hindsight I would have liked a bit of sugar in with the crust.  What I like about this cheesecake is that it isn't overly sweet or overly dense.

I read the suggestions and varied the recipe.  I started with 1 and 1/2 c. graham crackers, 1/4 c. sugar, 1/4 c. butter and a dash of cinnamon for the crust.  I deleted the milk and flour from the recipe to make it creamier.  I baked it at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 15 mins. and turned off the oven and let it set for 2 hours.  I added a pan of water on the rack below.  It did not crack but it was browned on the top and sides.  I was hoping for a white cheesecake.  Mine didn't turn out like other bakers said theirs came out.  It was delicious but certainly could not be mistaken for a store bought cake.

I am giving this recipie four stars because I used it as my base for my holiday cheesecake. I use the word base loosely because really the only things I changed were; I bought pre-crumbled graham crackers and I subsituted the milk for Eggnog. The cheesecake turned out great with a wonderful creamy texture and a bold but sweet cream cheese flavor. It did have a giant crack downt the middle but I think that was my fault not the recipe's. I definately overbeat it (I figured the more I beat it, the smoother it would be) and I put a pan of water on the rack underneath but didnt think to fill it with HOT water (oi). Also I preheated my oven the 350 but then turned it down to 325 after putting the cheesecake in, due to some other reviews suggesting the oven temp was to high. I will definately be using this recipe again.

My first Cheesecake ever and I was thrilled with the results.  EXCELLENT recipe.  I used the nuts, cinnamon and sugar crust that other reviewers recommended and I used only 1/8 c flour instead of 1/4cup to keep it creamy and dense.  I served it at a party and it was AMAZING!!

The first time I made this cheesecake, I forgot the milk.  It turned out perfectly.  I read a few reviews that mentioned the milk created too much moisture.  I have since never added the milk.  This cheesecake gets rave reviews every single time I make it.  It bakes perfectly, and has a perfect "deli" consistency.  I've gotten rid of all my other cheesecake recipes... this one is foolproof.

First cheesecake I ever made and it turned out perfect! I adjusted recipe to 3 packages of cream cheese for a smaller pan, and though I did not let it rest in the oven as long as the recipe suggested, I did allow it to sit for about an hour. The top did not crack at all. I served this at Thanksgiving and there was another cheesecake served too but I had compliments from everyone on my cheesecake. I will definitely be making this one again(and again and again and...).

This recipe was great! I've never made such a professional tasting and textured cheesecakes. One of my pet peeves about making cheesecake are lumps, I'll spend an hour trying to get them out only to fail and the batter for this particular cake was hassle free. My whole family agreed that I couldn't have done a better job. The only thing that I was disappointed with was the method to prevent cracking. Within in two hours of staying in the oven my cake had already developed a huge crack. Best tasting cheesecake I've ever had but by far the worst and biggest crack I've ever had.

I wish I could give it 10 stars! I made this for Thanksgiving and got many compliments. Followed the directions, greased sides of pan, baked in a water bath and let it cool 4 hours in the oven.  This cheesecake was perrrfect. It tasted as good as it looked. I will never use anyother recipe.

I make this recipe ALL the time. Never once have I made this and someone NOT like it. I even got my MOTHER who HATES cheesecake liking this recipe! I don't know what the people who don't like this recipe are doing to it but I have NEVER had it grainy or taste like egg. I have even used the pre-made crusts and used 1 recipe to make 2 cheesecakes. I even bought the mini pre-made crusts and made mini cakes for the kids! BY FAR this is the ultimate cheesecake recipe for doing them yourself. It is great plain, sometimes i will do toppings but nothing to take away from the creaminess of the cheesecake.

First time that I have ever baked a cheese cake and it was so delicious. I served it for dessert at a dinner party and it was a big hit,everyone like it.I served it with fresh raspberries and shaved white chocolate ontop.I followed the recipe exact and I didn't change a thing. I had a few small cracks on top but it was ok as I topped it with the raspberries so no one was able to see the cracks. I will be making this cheesecake over and over again.

Very easy, basic recipe. 

Great flavour. Not too rich. Probably a little sweeter than I would normally prefer but no one else complained; I will very slightly reduce the sugar next time I make it. Nice texture, but that's an issue of technique so read up on your cheesecake making tips :). 

This was an impulse bake: I used low fat cream cheese instead of regular and Greek yoghurt instead of sour cream as it was what I had on hand - worked just fine and cut down on the fat content a little. 

I also had to halve the recipe because I didn't have enough cream cheese for the full recipe - used a smaller pan, adjusted the cooking time a little for a thicker cake, had no trouble really.

This is some of the best cheesecake I've ever had.  Great texture and just sweet enough (it doesn't even need fruit)! Just make DARN sure that if you're using a water bath (highly suggested) that it's water tight!  It wasn't particularly difficult to make.  

Also, I wasn't sure if it was dumb luck, but I only waited three hours when the oven was fully cooled instead of the instructed five to six and it turned out fine (we were in a bit of a rush).

Easy to make and delicious! Be sure to leave it in the oven after baking. Let it cool and then release the spring foam pan to avoid cracking then put it in the fridge. Cheesecakes are best eaten when it is chilled.

I do not have a spring form pan so I just used a regular pie Graham cracker crust. I halved the recipe and the amount was perfect. The texture is perfect and guests I served to said it was the best they've ever had (and they love cheesecake). I topped it with homemade caramel sauce, candied pecans and drizzles of milk/white chocolate. Yummy, don't change a thing.

As always, I followed the recipe exactly as written, out of respect for the person who wrote it/posted it. I enjoyed it but gave it 4 stars because it was missing that tangy flavor from the cream cheese. I think I will reduce the amount of sugar next time and try it without the milk or flour (per a couple of reviews I read). Mine cracked but you know what? I don't care! :) It was still very good and this was my first time making cheesecake.

If you will follow the direction precisely, it won't fail, but like several other people said DO NOT over-mix or it will crack. The greased sides of the spring-form will also help a great deal. Baking a great cheese cake is an art. I am from new York City and this recipe' is as good as it gets.

This is an almost perfect cheesecake. I say almost, because I have ran across more authentic methods and recipes (most "purists" cakes do not require flour, sour cream or "crusts" and many require water baths for maximum dense moisture). Since I am not a "purist" or cheesecake afficiondo, it's fine by me. This is a *perfect* cheesecake for an oops proof result, as long as you remember that it is AIR that is incorporated into the filling that is suspect number 1 if your cake splits or cracks. If you have made a sauce, jam or grown fruits you are particularly proud of, here is your perfect foil!

Made this as my first cheesecake! It was a huge success!!! I did it in kind of a hurry, as it needs so much time to rest.. Only thing that may have made it better was not to use the mixer the whole time (read comments AFTER, duh..). Either way, I don't care about cracks. I think it adds character & shows "homemade". = ] I deducted a star because the crust should be 2 or 3 times as thick!! I will def make it thicker next time! Other than that, I got all but a standing ovation for this baby! And it was my first try!! Love it!

This cheesecake was SOOOOOO EASY to make! My first time making it, my sister (who isn't a big fan of cheesecake) said that it tastes better than the one that Publix (our neighborhood grocery store) sells. To add to that my cousins husband liked it so much he asked if he could take some home, after being offered a piece initially but declining (I'm guessing he's not a big fan either...lol), but decided to taste it from the piece my cousin had. Everybody who had some said it was SO GOOD with the texture being just right & it being so soft and creamy without the taste of the cheese overwhelming everything.

A good classic New York Cheesecake... non of that quick no bake want-to-bes.. this was a great recipe which turned out wonderful... I followed the recipe to the T (except added a few extra graham cracker crumbs and another tablespoon of butter to the crust) and had great results not a crack in sight... there is nothing healthy about this recipe 2 pounds of cream cheese and then a cup of sour cream... very very good though....

Stunningly perfect! I practiced self-control and prepared the recipe as written. At first, I thought the cooking temp was too high, I thought the batter was too thin, too much milk, and I thought it was silly to spend 5 or 6 hours letting the thing cool in the closed oven....I was wrong on all counts! DO NOT alter this recipe.  It is everso slightly cake-ish, but don't let that deter you from trying this recipe....it is FOOLPROOF! You can serve this to your priest, pastor, rabbi, or mother-in-law

This is really good and EASY! I am a good cook but hav enever tried sheesecake because of the long wait. But i made vheesecake bars by Paula Deen and they were excellent so I tried this. I added cinnamon and one egg white to crust. I did the rest as instructed except left in oven 3 hours opening door the last hour then refridge overnight. Yummy it is dense  I will try it next time without flour but I like both ways. So I will make both ways for a change sometimes.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I followed the suggestion of others and brought everything to room temperature.  I also did the water bath which makes a huge difference.  Also, you have to be careful not to over mix the ingredients. I make an animal cracker crust for mine; it doesn't get soggy and provides something different.  I have made this several times now and everyone loves it!

Wow! I made this the first time for Thanksgiving and nothing was left! My family raved about and said it tasted better than any other cheesecake they had. The only difference was I used cinnamon graham crackers with an added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 of nutmeg mixed in, and doubled the crust as it was initially very thin.

Perfect recipe - my only issue was the crust was a bit soggy.  I might try to bake the crust for 5 or so minutes before putting the filling in.

Ok, I joined allrecipes just to review this recipe! There's a comment that states if you fail this recipe its your fault and not the recipe, and she's right. Easiest recipe and so delish. I followed exactly, I didn't leave it in the oven for 5 hours, because lets face it, who can have a cheesecake bake for 1 hour and then wait another 5 hours after that without cutting into it. I left it in the oven for 2 hours, went out running and prayed that 2 hours would go by faster than it ever had before. Even though I left it for 2 hours there were no cracks! I added some fresh berries to the top and now I'm enjoying this awesome cheesecake!

This was very good as far as cheesecakes go.  I was however a little disappointed in how it looked.  It could have been baker error but I would have liked it to look a bit more prettier.

This is the most tasty addictive cheesecake I have ever made and eaten!  And it's so incredibly easy to make.  I will be making often.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla but only half the amount of almond extract as it is quite strong.  Next time I will melt some dark chocolate and drizzle it over the top when it is first baked.  I made it to take as a dessert when travelling to my Aunt and Uncle's house for a vacation, and they wanted the recipe too.  You simply must make it - you will be hooked!

This recipe is off the chain! This recipe created 2 cakes for me with more than enough left over to create a third. However we just decided to lick the mix because it was so good! My hubby used it to dip strawberries for a snack. Anyhow I blew it a bit with the time set up because I really didn't realize how much mix I had so I put one pie in the oven first, then I added another maybe 30 minutes later.  Why am I sharing this well because I was a bit skeptical when I read all the negative reviews about the cracking and the blah blah blah so I was concerned.  Either way both pies (one was a bit browner than the other) came out as masterpieces! One was extra overcooked and the other a tiny bit under cooked (by 10 minutes) but you couldn't taste the difference at all by letting them cool. These pies didn't make it to the end of the week... I received so many compliments and wow did you make this? Yes I did, and I have Chantal to thank.... Amazing recipe, way better than the no bake Jello cheesecake that was my inspiration for finding this recipe in the first place!

If you pour it into already made graham crusts you get two cheesecakes out of this recipe. Its so good!This is the best cheesecake I have ever made. Thanks so much for the recipe. I did like other reviewers and left it in the oven to cool for a few hours.I only cooked mine for 40 minutes because of the fact that I used already made crusts so thecheesecake wasn't as thick. Perfect!

Everyone wanted the recipe for this :), I didn't have my springform pans anymore so I just bought crusts and made 2.
Edit: I've made this a few times. I've read a lot of the reviews, I swear mine always cracks  no matter what i do, but I don't care. It tastes good (I have never made this crust, just the filling) and I like it the way it is. Maybe it should say to leave your cream cheese out to room temp, for those who don't know.

Perfect batter recipe!  (For the crust I followed a separate traditional graham cracker crust recipe.)  Followed the recipe exactly plus the tips given in reviews:  warm temp ingredients, don't overmix, double foil water bath, grease the pan well, leave in oven 60 mins then turn off and don't touch it for 5-6 hrs (not even to run a knife around the edge).  Absolutely gorgeous cheesecake, no cracks (a first for me), awesome taste.  Don't understand reviews that said it didn't taste like cream cheese, this came out so delicious and very much like a moist bakery's cheesecake.  To make sure there was no air in the batter before baking I lightly dropped the bowl on the countertop a couple of times, making the air bubbles rise to the top and burst (there weren't many, but just in case....).
Next time I will make sure to grease the bottom better as the crust stuck a bit, or bake the crust for 5 mins before filling.

Excellent cheesecake for my first attempt.  Very easy to make and an easy recipe to follow.  My cheesecake did crack but I'm sure I overbeat the mix.  I should have used a wooden spoon after mixing in the sugar.  However with the cherries on the top, you can't tell it cracked.

This was so easy to make.  I still had cracking on the top but with some cherries on top no one would ever know!   My family said it was the best cheesecake I had ever made and I have made quite a few looking for the perfect one.  I found it.  In fact it was so good itd gone slready so I'm making it again tomorrow!

First attempt at making baked cheesecake and it's delicious! Very easy to make! I added raspberry topping which gives that slightly tangy taste - well balanced with the sweetness of the filling. I'll make it again, for sure!

If I would rate this on taste definitely 5 stars!!!!! But if I rated it on appearance, I would give it 3. I made this cheesecake a couple times, but each time it cracked terribley on top. I googled it and found that cheesecakes crack if the cool to fast, or if the inside reaches above 160 degrees F. I tried turning down the temperature for the last 30 minutesm but it didn't help. I think I'll search for a new cheesecake recipie.

I wanted to try making cheesecakes (because they are one of my favorite desserts) so I looked for something simple to put together and easy-to-shop ingredients.  This recipe is it.  I served it at my church and job potluck and everyone loved it!  Considering I've never made cheesecakes, this recipe was easy to follow and definitely easy to eat.  The only thing I would share is to put it in a water bath (make sure that water does NOT get into the cheesecake pan) and let it sit in the oven, after you turn it off, overnight (this really does help the cake not to crack).  Early the next morning put it in the fridge and its ready to go by noontime.  Great recipe, easy to make and wonderful taste.  One last note, just because I like to do stuff the easy way, I used canned cherry pie filling as the topping.  Still great and divinely tasting!

Amazing! 1st time making cheesecake and I guess I over worked the ingredients because mine cracked. Didn't matter to me though because I topped it with a freshly made strawberry puree and drizzled dark chocolate on top. Also sprinkled dark chocalate chips on top of the graham cracker crust before adding filling to add a chocolate layer on the bottom. Will definately be using this recipe again. Thanks!

I actually made this into mini cheesecakes (muffin sized) and added a little sugar to the crust.  I baked them for about 15 mins each and they turned out great!  My coworkers raved about them, so now I'm making them again for another function.

Awesome recipe! I made this for my hubby's birthday surprise cake just this friday and he loved it!! Topped with his fave blueberry (sauce recipe by martha stewart) to sweeten the deal! First ever attempt at making cheesecake from scratch and it was a relative success. Used a water bath which guaranteed me no cracks whatsoever. The "don't overbeat" rule is a little tricky though. I might have overbeat mine just a tad bit coz it was definitely not as dense as i wanted it but the taste great! Hubby loved it ofcourse and said he liked my "lighter/airier" cake than the more denser ones at the store or resto. Overall a success and will definitely make this one again! Would add a little cinnamon sugar about 1/2 cup to the crust though for added sweetness and crunch to the crust. Would definitely recommend this one even cheeseake neophytes like myself! Cheesecake making is no longer an impossible dream! Wootwoot!

I give this recipe 5 stars because it's the best tasting Cheesecake I have ever made. However, even after following all the suggestions in the comments I have yet to make one that hasn't cracked. I have one in the oven now, I don't know if it has cracks, but I do know that it will taste Great! I usually top it with Caramel (ice cream topping). I've been told I should call it a "Creme Brulee" cheesecake. I will keep trying to make this till I get one that's smooth on top. Love this recipe!

I was so excited to make this cheesecake after reading all the reviews. My cheesecake still cracked and I left it in the oven. Tasted great after chilled. By the way, this was the EXACT recipe that came with my springform pan!

I don't know what I did wrong but my cheesecake came out more like one of those no-bake ones where you mix the cream cheese with condensed milk and lemon juice.  It had a very creamy texture - maybe it was underbaked but I followed the directions for baking and leaving in the oven to the T.  I also thought that 15 graham crackers was too much.  My husband gave this one a thumbs down; I ate it but prefer a firmer texture.

Made this yesterday for my bf's birthday... Everyone loved it!!! Don't over beat the eggs, mine cracked even though I did use the bath technique. I covered it up with strawberry, blueberry, and whipped cream. Definitely will use this recipe again!! Thanks :)

Oh my God... Need I say more. This was the first time I have EVER made cheesecake and I think I have found my forever recipe. I used the waterbath technique along with only 2 tablespoons of flour so it came out as a creamy, none cracked masterpiece :) Super delish... 5 stars 5 stars 5 stars!

You do not need to do an actual water bath, just put a pan of water in the oven, under the rack with the cake. If the pan is properlly greased, you should have no pro lens. I experimented with lemon shortbread and graham cracker crust, a perfect compliment to the vanilla here. No need for a blender! Use a rissotto spoon instead to break up the cheese and avoid over-beating. You want this cake a little soft. Enjoy! It's a lovely cake.

lovely cheesecake recipe.  I didn't need it so sweet, so I used about 1 cup sugar.  I also use my own crust recipes- sometimes a plain flour and butter one, and sometimes a nut and sometimes various cookie crusts.

This was a fantastic recipe!! I split it into 3 pie pans and it easily made 3 great cheesecakes. I turned the oven off after 35 minutes. I did use a water bath. No cracking or sinking! Very tasty, easy and impressive.

As a person who is not a great cook, this was a fantastic recipe.  I did not use a waterbath, I simply greased the side of my springform pan with butter.  The cheesecake did not crack or fall, and was delightful.  Very easy to make and a hit with the kiddies.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Great basic cheesecake! I halved the ingredients to make a small 6" cake. Baked at 160C for 25-30 min until the cake was wobbly in the center when tapped.

I baked it with a water bath and sprayed the sides of the tin with PAM. If u spray the sides, the cake will simply lift itself out of the tin. No need to scrape the sides with a knife. My cake turned out with PERFECT edges, no browning, sinking nor cracking.

For those of you the have trouble with water from the water bath seep into the foil, try lining the cake tin with a layer of parchment first.

Topped this with Blueberry Sauce by Isybel, also from this site.

This cheesecake was amazing. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars however was the soggyness of the crust. It didnt take away from the taste however. I didnt change anything in the recipe except I included a water bath. (This was probably the culprit for the soggy crust) We will be enjoying this cake with strawberry topping! YUM!

best cheesecake recipe i've found! working with all room- temp. ingredients helps keep you from over-beating...and a pan of water on the rack beneath the cheesecake while baking is recommended.

My only modification was to add a water bath. I baked at 350 for one hour as instructed and let it sit in the oven with the door closed for about 8 hrs. Turned out beautiful on the outside, but sadly mushy on the inside (in the center). 
Overall, a tasty cheesecake. I may possibly use this recipe again in the future adding at least an additional 15-20 minutes of baking time.

The recipe, as listed and baked, came out great. I gave it four stars only because I prefer a little more "bite" to my cheesecake flavor, and a 4-star rating may catch the attention of others who might feel the same. 

Excellent recipe, though! The texture was creamy but held up well, and the finished product had a fantastic "mouth feel." Not a bit of grit or dryness.

Again, the difference is in the final flavor. If you like a more tart cheesecake, I'd suggest a different recipe, or experiment on this one with some lemon zest and juice. Still -- well done, Chantal!

This was the first time I've ever made a cheesecake. Every time I went to a restaurant and ordered one I felt my money went to waste...but after making this everyone sees me as the greatest pastry chest (I'm not a good cook) but I've found that I'm good at pastry and this recipe as lifted my self esteem and assurance in the kintchen and it is SUPER DELICIOUS!

Perfect! The first time I overcooked it but the next time I used a water bath and what a difference! I also used chocolate cookies instead of graham crackers for a change. A big hit with the family...now my friends are giving me requests:)

This recipe turned out a lovely, creamy, dense cheesecake with no cracks (I did cook it in a water bath for one hour, and then left it in the oven for an additional 6 hours, as suggested by previous bakers) - strongly recommend it for anyone wanting to serve cheesecake.

Seriously, this is the best cheesecake ever! Everyone who tried it loved it, especially the super creamy texture! Best advice for this cheesecake is to leave it be! Set that timer for an hour and do not open the door for any reason after that. This is a fool-proof and delicious recipe if you follow it correctly!

This was the easiest cheesecake I have ever made. We had a New York friend over for Christmas dinner and served it. He said it was great, just like in New York. There isn't a better recomendation than that.

I have tried other online recipes from well known chefs, but this one it is just perfect. Exact quantities used with a little vanilla flavor. Cake has an excellent shape and taste. No cracking, no burning.

I'm a spastic amateur.  If you don't get the cream cheese soft enough, it will make little dots of unblended ingredients.  I had to use a whisk instead of a paddle to blend it.  Glory be, the cheesecake turned out perfect.  Next time, though, I will use cream instead of milk just to see if it is better.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it so much that they're asking me to make another one for Christmas!  I used one of the other reviewer's recipe for the crust and it turned out great.  Thanks to all the other reviewers because without their tips, I don't think I would have done as well!

This is wonderful!  My first attempt at a "real" cheesecake and it is delicious.  I used 2 pre-made pie crusts and still had filling left over.  It cracked real bad (totally my fault, I mixed filling too much), but it didn't matter, the taste was phenomenal.  I can't say thanks enough.

Thank you for this great & fairly easy recipe! I am a novice cheescake baker (although experienced home cook) and I followed this recipe exactly with the warnings of reviewers not to overbeat. The comments I got on this cake were "impressive" , "DELICIOUS", "outstanding".  There was no cracking or any other problems! Thank you!

My stepdaughter and I decided to make this for Thanksgiving. I was a little nervous since I had never made a baked cheesecake before. This recipe is truly simple, easy to make and will turn out perfectly. I turned off the oven after 1 hour and left it in the oven for approx. 2 hours; I then had to move it to the microwave to finish the cooling process as I needed my big oven for other things.  No cracks and we recieved raves about our "beautiful" cheesecake the next day!

THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!! NO cracks even w/o a water bath! 
I am not a big cheesecake fan, but I made this for my 14 year old son's birthday, he couldn't say enough wonderful things about it! My family loved it, friends loved it, I even loved it. 
Very rich & creamy! Crust was a bit bland, & even used extra butter (maybe some cinnamon next time?)
Make this, follow directions, no need for water bath, trust your instincts, you won't regret it! 
Only one con,PEOPLE KEEP ASKING ME WHEN I AM MAKING ANOTHER ONE!! LOL

Followed instructions to the T- great flavor, but top cracked.  I made a light cream cheese frosting and topped the cheesecake with that to mask the cracks.

This turned out AMAZING.  Followed the recipe exactly as written, but put it in a bain marie, per other reviews.  Left it in the oven to cool too and it was fantastic.  This was the first time a cheesecake recipe has EVER worked for me.  This recipe is a GEM.

Overall this recipe was pretty good. This is not a 9 inch recipe though! I suppose I should have known something was wrong when there was too much for the pan, but I was in the middle of making a very large dinner and so just went with it. Cake souffled over the top and did not set right as a result. I will try it again with a bigger pan. I will say, it did not crack, lol!

I love this cheesecake, it reminds me of the cheesecakes they use to sell at the Olive Garden without the chocolate on top.  I have made it as is and have added powdered cocoa to it and did a swirl of the cocoa so that it is marbeled when finished and both way are fantastic.  I always get rave reviews when I make this.

I have been making cheesecake since I was married 41 years ago.  Only once did my cheesecake NOT crack and it was terrible. The reason it cracks is because there needs to be a pot of water in the oven with the cake. Greasing the sides has nothing to do with the cracking of the cake.

This is the recipe I will keep forever. The cheesecake is perfect , dense, rich and delicious.I did have to improvise as I wanted to make this and found I had no graham crackers. I happened to have cinnamon toast crunch cereal in the pantry and ran it thru the processer and with just butter was perfectly sweet enough.

I was really excited to try this recipe. Especially after reading the reviews. However, I was sorely disappointed. My cheesecake did not crack, but the top burnt very badly. There is another variation of this recipe which is much better. It has a different crust recipe, 3 tablespoons of flour, and cooks at 325 degrees. I recommend finding and using that recipe if you are considering this one.

I made this recipe and for the most part it was as wonderful as everyone said.  I made one change and that was to split the cream cheese so that I had 2 regular and 2 neufchatel.  It was very creamy and not as heavy as some cheesecakes.  The only thing I had a problem with and why I didn't give a full 5 stars (maybe I did something wrong) was the crust.  I did as told with the graham crackers but the crust was very dry and didn't compliment the cheesecake at all.  I welcome suggestions for what could have been done differently.  I am an avid baker and I would love to add this cheesecake to my list of favorites but have to fix the crust first.  Also, I baked for an hour and left it in the oven to cool for 5 hours and like many also had a big crack in the middle.  I am thinking it was do to over mixing but either way it didn't affect the taste at all.  Was proud to call this my first cheesecake!

This cheesecake was truly awesome!  I have an excellent recipe from an Italian restaurant that I acquired from someone that worked there and this I think is better.  I loved it.  Everyone should try to make this.  It was easy and excellent!

Great Cheesecake! I recently bought an inexpensive item called "the perfect Cheesecake". It contains an oven safe water bath holder with handles which eliminates the issue of leakage. You place your 9 inch spring form into the holder and all into any deep baking dish filled with hot water. perfection!

Delicious! I've never made cheesecake before....I followed advice from Morenas review and mine came out perfectly done. Everyone at our party loved it and begged for the recipe! Once you beat the cheese and sugar, do the rest with a wooden spoon. Then, let it cool properly and it will not crack.

this is a good recipe I only question why you would leave it in the oven for 5 hours after baking?  I have many NY cheesecake  recipes and they all say to leave in turned off oven with door closed for 1 hour.  not criticizing, just curious. I left it for a couple of hours then proceeded as directed and it turned out great.

It was my first time to make this and it did not disappoint. I followed what was written on here and did the water bath method. It did not crack at all but gave me a very shiny and firm cheesecake. It was dense as well and has just the right amount of sweetness. I put some blueberry jam on top of it and some frozen blueberries. This one requires patience. The waiting game is a killer but its worth it.

I've used this recipe twice now and it bakes a perfect cheesecake. Definitely follow others peoples reviews and grease the sides of the pan and let the cheesecake cool in the oven for 1hr after cooking to ensure that it doesn't crack. Also for those wondering about the best way to crush the graham crackers to get an even consistency the best way I found was to put them into a ziploc bag and use a rolling pin to crush them. My go-to recipe for cheesecake!

I made this cheesecake yesterday.  I cooked it for 60 minutes as suggested but it kind of browned on top and split.  It tasted good but I felt like it was missing the creamy factor.  Maybe it was just over-cooked? Also, my crust wasn't brown and crisp- it was a little soggy! Must just be me, because everyone else seems to have no problem with this recipe.

With with being said, everyone did enjoy it a lot.  I did receive compliments. I guess I'm just a perfectionist!

Best ever cheesecake, tried several and this is hands down the favorite.. FAR better than any store bought cheesecake, it is a "true" cheesecake with perfect texture and a rich, full flavor!! I am not that crazy for graham cracker crust but ad cinnamon and sugar to the crumb mixture and gives it a nice taste verses just a plain graham cracker!!

I've made this a number of times, all with great results.  The cheesecake always gets rave reviews.  I make the crust with some(1/3 cup) sugar and instead of doing everything full fat, I used skim milk, light sour cream and 1/2 of the cream cheese was low fat.  This thing is pretty high calorie and you don't lose the taste by making these substitutions.  Good luck everyone else :)

So, this was my first Cheesecake attempt ever, and I baked it with a pan of water on the lower oven shelf. It cracked like it was hit by an 8.0 earthquake. It was however, DELICIOUS! just not pretty! I was a little unsure of wrapping the pan in layers of foil and baking it in a pan of water, but maybe next time. It was very tasty and I will make it again.

This cheesecake turned out absolutely perfectly. Waking up at 3 a.m. to take it out of the oven after letting it rest for 6 hours was totally worth it.

Great recipe! If you are looking for a classic new-york style cheesecake, this is the recipe for you! Like other reviewers, I made sure not to overmix the batter before pouring over the crust. I baked for one hour and let sit in the oven (after turning it off) for about 4-5 hours. It is really important to make sure the cream cheese is soft enough (room temperature) before making the filling. My crust was a tad dry - maybe I used too many graham crackers, but I think it could have done with a bit more butter. Overall, excellent cheesecake. Served with choice of whipped cream, cherry pie filling, and nutella glaze on the side and everyone loved it!

I used this recipe for a catered party at work. It went over so well I made another for the other cooks. Garnished with candied orange peels and simple hulled fresh strawberries, this was wonderful, smooth and delicious. New York cheesecake is a classic and this recipe was no exception. Thank you Taliesen! The only thing I changed on my second batch, was used toasted ground hazelnuts in the crust mixture, about a half cup or so. wonderful

I made this for the first time and it came out perfect. I changed it though....I know I love my NY style to have that slight lemon zing so I added the zest of one lemon and it was PERFECT!!!! Now just trying to keep my son out of it!

This was beautiful. This was fantastic. This was delicious. 
I think I managed to fall in love with a cheesecake. 
It was literally that good. It even tasted better than anything I've had at a bakery. And that means stuff, folks. 
But anyway - I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a water bath. 
The only thing that needs to be edited is the crust - I believe some people recommended adding cinnamon and a few other spices, which I will definitely do next time(and there WILL be a next time). 
Otherwise, follow the recipe exactly. The oven instructions sound funky - listen anyway. It makes your life easier, anyway. 
Surprisingly, the most annoying part of this recipe was just making the crust. Everything else was completely easy and simple. And when a 17 year old says that, you know it's easy. 
My entire family loved the cheesecake too and could not get enough!

On the good side, the texture is light and very nice.  On the "bad" side, I felt I wanted more flavor.  It seemed a little bland to me.  I'm going to make it again and see if I did something wrong or if I can boost something, because the texture made this worth trying again.

awesome. made it for a pregnant coworker who was craving nyc style cheesecake- which is kinda hard to find around fort campbell ky. She loved it. I swirled a blended strawberry mix into it to make strawberry swirl cheesecake. I was skeptical but Im glad I gave this a try. Never made a cheesecake before and it turned out perfect.

I love cheesecake, it's my all time favorite guilty pleasure.  Came across this recipe and decided this would be my first attempt at making a cheesecake.  I followed everything to a "T" with the exception of adding appx 1/4 tsp of lemon zest.  It baked with zero cracking and zero sinking in the middle!  So HAPPY!  Great recipe, easy to follow and easily adaptable should anyone want to change it up.  I will surely be making this again and again now that I've gained my confidence!

This was my very first cheesecake recipe. I made it exactly how the recipe called for and it turned out perfect! I tried it before it was completely cooled, it was a bit soft but after it chilled in the fridge over night it was firm creamy and delicious! Great recipe.

Excellent pure New York smooth cheesecake. It doesn't get easier or more tasty. Just follow the directions. Once you make it pure as is.... then tweak and add choc. chips, choc chip cookie dough pieces, walnuts, choc. and carmel etc.

I made this exactly to the recipe.  It was sooooo good! I used a spring-form pan. I also used a boxed brownie mix for the crust, cooking it before adding the cheesecake on top and cooking again. I also cooked it in a water bath and left it in the oven to cool. No cracks.  It did get a little brown on top but it tasted fine and I put a chocolate ganache over the top. Everyone who tasted it raved! I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!!!

First time I really made cheesecake! This is so DELICIOUS and EASY to make. 

Mine didn't crack at all and I did a water bath for it. I made it at midnight, and left it in the oven for 6 hours. ;) So I woke up to a cheesecake that I was ready dive into, but I had to let it chill. 

The texture is REALLY rich, decadent, and creamy. I would definitely make this and bring it to a party.

I have made this recipe many many times and it is , by far, the best of the best~! If I could give more than 5 stars, I would give it 100! It is a delectable dessert!  It IS important not to overbeat it, and also make sure you mix only with a wooden spoon.  Guaranteed perfect every time~! Kudos to the creator!

Excellent recipe. Bringing all ingredients to room temp and cooking in a water bath will prevent cracks.

This is a fantastic cheesecake recipe - used cinnamon graham crackers and turned out beautifully.  Works well with cream cheese that was previously frozen, so a great way to take advantage of sales! Did have to use 5 T melted butter to get crust right consistency.

My brother can be a bit of a food snob, but he insists that I make this cheesecake every year for his birthday. I've tried oreo, turtle, m&m, lemon raspberry variations and have all gotten rave reviews.

Yum, this is 4.5 stars!  I made some minor changes.  I left out the flour.  I doubled the crust and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixture.  After beating the cream cheese and sugar, I did all the rest of the mixing by hand (wooden spoon). I cooked the cheesecake in a water bath.  I used a slow-cooker bag to put the cheesecake pan in so the water wouldnt seep into the cheesecake.  I cooked it for an hour then turned off the oven and let is sit inside for 2 hours.  NO CRACKING!  But the edges got a little brown which was disappointing.  It tasted delicious anyways!

Turned out really well.  I drizzled the top with chocolate and sprinkled chopped pecans along the edge of the cake.  I received a ton of compliments.  It looked and tasted so good most people thought I bought it at the bakery.

ok.....I made this today, followed the recipe but in the cream cheese/sugar mixture, I added orange/lemon zest, I only used the hand mixer to mix the cream cheese and the sugar, the rest I mixed with the wooden spoons.  The suggestions by the other comments totally helped.  I baked mine 350 degrees for 1 hour/10 minutes.  Like the suggestion, I left it alone for almost 4 hours, and covered it with foil loosely, and refrigerated it.  Prior to all of these baking steps,  I made sure that bottom and sides of spring form pan was generously greased, in my opinion, you really have to do a water bath, that really helps the cooking process, making the heat even, also make sure that you wrap the bottom of the pan halfway to prevent seepage.  At long last, this is my first attempt at making the famous cheese cake and it was a complete, utter success.  It has no cracks, perfectly moist and creamy.  I made cherry sauce from one canned cherry filling.  I drained the cherries, put it aside, I added 2 tbsp of cornstarch and 1/4 cup sugar, let it boil and cooled, I then added the cherries...refrigerate it as well.  I know you're suppose to wait until cheese cake sets over night, but it was fine when I cut it after 5-6 hours.  My b/f was salivating the whole time, said a few expletives about how excellent and out of this world it was.  This success made my day, I will definitely make this cheese cake again......Thanks Chantal and all the wonderful suggestions from all the people here.....

Must say that I did devour my share of this cheesecake. It was quite delightful to say the least. My company enjoyed it as well. I did like the fact that it was not so sweet as many other cheesecakes may be. Will be doing again and again. Thanks for the recipe. I will recommend others in trying it. Very easy to make.

Mine didn't turn out great.  Huge cracks on top, and an airy texture, not creamy.  I think I know what I did wrong!  Cream cheese wasn't room temp when I started, so I kept whipping, whipping, whipping to try and get everything to incorporate well.  But I think it added tons of air to the batter.  Resulting in a cheesecake that rose almost 4" above the top of the pan, only to fall and crack as it cooled.  I'll try this recipe again; this time with room temp ingredients and taking extra care to stir, only until combined.  Hopefully this will give me a dense, creamy, sweet, slice of deliciousness!  :)

This cheesecake is very dense..it's really good. I'm not sure what I did with the crust...it was overcooked a little. I doubled the recipe and not sure if I added a bit too much butter....but the crust on the bottom was a bit hard and overcooked tasting.... dunno

I tried this (first time!) using tenderflake (2 inch diameter) tart shells. I was absolutely delicious. I cooked them for 18 minutes at 350 degrees. One pan I took out right away and one pan I left in as the oven cooled (only for about 20 minutes though), result were in favour of both; they were both great. Makes about 48 cheesecake tarts at full recipe, I made 36 with 3/4 of the recipe.

I have made this three times now and my family LOVES it!!  I have learned that it is best to bake in a water bath and to leave it in the oven 5 to 6 hours as directed.  The cheesecake was beautiful and almost flawless in appearance.

I have made this on several occasions. My very first one did not crack but ever since then it has. I still follow the recipe to the T the only change has been the oven... I am making this again tonight and hopefully it won't crack! I love the flavor of this cheesecake, a lot of people use this as a base and add flavors, I must be plain because I love it the way it is!

This recipe was so well received by my friends that I felt like a celebrity chef. I think the only thing I did differently was just to make more crust. I like a thick graham cracker crust and so did my friends. I followed some other tips and buttered the sides and bottom of the springform pan to keep the cake from cracking as it cooked and pulled away from the sides. I also put a pan of water beneath the cake as it baked. Do not overbake this cake. The stated cooking time in a preheated oven is dead on. It will feel like you need to bake it longer, but don't! Leave the cake in the oven (along with the hot pan of water) and turn off the heat and let it cool completely in the oven. Then remove the springform sides. You will have a perfect cake with no cracks and it will be completely level and gorgeous. Not one thing about the recipe needed to be changed. This is the most perfect recipe I have ever used.

I have been making this cheesecake for my husband's birthday every year for a few years now.  It's his special request ....with raspberry sauce on it.  I even make the crust gluten free now, so I can have a piece.  It doesn't last long, especially with a 15 year old teenager in the house too!  Thank you very very much for the recipe.

This recipe is fantastic! I"ve tried cheesecake for the first time and came out lookin like a Carnegie Deli Cheesecake. It tastes great!  I followed the recipe however I cooked it in water by wrapping aluminum foil around the pan. Due to circumstances I could not keep the cake in the oven for 5-6 hours and I only kept it for 2 hours to cool off. Right after that I put it in the fridge to set.  It looks great and it did not crack at all. I did follow the instructions on not to over-mixing the filling from the other reviews.  This recipe definetely a keeper! Thank you!

I followed the recipe along with the tips provided by the other reviewers, such as not over-mixing and using a water bath. This was my first time making cheesecake and I ended up making this twice in two days and neither one of them cracked! Delicious and great-looking cheesecake! I highly recommend this recipe. It's not too sweet and has great texture.

Tasted divine!  Mine did split on top but I didn't use a water bath.  I'll go back to that, next time, but continue to use this recipe.  Taste can't be beat.  Perfect texture, also.    I recommend making a day in advance.  You really want it to have time to chill!

I didn't have a springform pan handy, but this cheesecake came out wonderful without one. I put wax paper in the bottom of a round cake pan and sprayed it with cooking spray. As recommended by one reviewer, when it was done cooking, I turned the oven off and left the cake inside for a few hours. The cake came out of the pan with no problems. Because I used a pan that was more shallow, I had enough batter to make a second cake. I topped it with a can of cherry pie filling, and it was delicious. Not too rich.

I first made this recipe for friends at a New Year's Eve dinner.  Needless to say I blew my new year's resolution out the window with the leftovers!! The creamiest cheesecake I had ever had and I didn't even have time for it to sit in the oven as long as it said. It did not crack or sink!  And I'm not even a dessert pro! I'll WILL make this one again!  Hubby was so impressed

As someone who does not bake regularly and is generally just learning my way around a kitchen.. I was kicking myself when I agreed to make dessert for my (new) boyfriend's family Christmas dinner.  The cheesecake turned out so amazingly well that I've made it again and it has made me look like some kind of genius chef.  The only small modifications I recommend: use more crackers for the base than listed (I'm in England so I use digestives), about 22 makes for a thicker crust and also use more butter.  I also used a water bath and had no cracking whatsoever.  This recipe is idiot proof, trust me.  Make it and you will be very very popular at whatever party you attend.  Cheers.

SO AWESOME! This was my first try at a real cheesecake so I didn't attempt a waterbath, but just baked it and let it stay in the oven for a total of 5 hours. It did crack, probably because I didn't do the water bath, but the flavor and texture were soo goood. Definitely making this for every Christmas Eve from now on. Thanks!

If you like New York style creamy cheesecake that melts in your mouth and leaves you longing for more, then this one is for you.  The best cheese cake I ever made.  Thanks Chantal for passing this delicious recipe on to us.  I can't wait to make it again.

This was my first EVER cheesecake and it was AMAZING.  Easy to make and DELISH!  I followed the recipe almost exact:  but I just cut the sugar down to 1 1/4c.  You can't go wrong with this.  SO GOOOOOOOD.  Smooth, rich, and droooooly good.

Awesome!  Great recipe, but I took advice from the reviews and made some changes:  All I had was a 9.5" spring form pan, so I increased the servings to 15 and prepared the filling accordingly and baked an extra 25 minutes.  I baked in a hot water bath, ran a knife around the edge after baking, and let cool in the oven for about 3-4 hours and refrigerated overnight.  It came out beautifully with no cracking!  For a little extra effect, I arranged fresh fruit attractively on the top and glazed.  For a perfect fruit glaze, heat orange marmalade on the stove and strain to remove orange pieces then brush over the top (spreads easily when heated).

I used light cream cheese and light graham crackers and it was still really good. I did have to add more butter to the graham cracker crust to make it come together, for some reason. I also don't own a springform pan so I made individual sized cheesecakes in a muffin tin, baked 20 min. Perfect!!

Never have to buy another New York cheesecake again, this is the perfect recipe.  Followed the direction as written.  It came out great.   Would not change a thing.  This is an awesome recipe its better than most cheese cake that you buy at the grocery store.  I made this for my sister in law and she now wants to pay me to make this recipe for her.  This is definitely a keeper

This cake is perfect. It's thick, rich, delicious and amazing. When I think of New York cheesecake, THIS is it. After one hour, I turned off the stove and let it stay in there for another 2, and it's just the richest, creamiest best cheesecake. I made a quick caramel sauce when I forgot the strawberry sauce, and it's fan-bloody-tastic, although it's amazing plain. I wish I could give it more stars.... or Chantal a hug!

This recipe gets 5 stars because I screwed up the baking time and it still tasted fantastic.  Can't imagine how good it would taste if I made it correctly!

This was quite good came out creamy and light. The only thing was just the top with presentation and I am going to say it is my fault b/c I didnt have time to let it sit in the overn for 5 hours after cooking I took it out and as it cooled the top ended up with a huge crack in it. i did do a water bath while it was cooking which I figured would prevent that. Everyone at the house like this

Followed the advice in the comments: brought all ingredients to room temperature, added eggs last one at a time, reduced flour to 2 Tbsp, used a water bath, and left the cheesecake in the oven for several hours after baking. It turned out phenomenal! No cracks, and a beautifully smooth & creamy texture! I forgot to grease the sides of the pan before preparing the crust, but there was enough butter in the graham cracker crust to keep it from sticking. I also used 1/2 reduced fat cream cheese and light sour cream - still tasted great. My one slight complaint is that the crust was not crisp and crunchy. This is probably unavoidable, however, due to the long time between baking and eating. :) Wonderful recipe I will definitely be using again!

There is no flavor. It didnt even taste like cheesecake. My husband and I travel all over. Having just come back from NY & eaten at some of the finest Italian restaurants, I was craving cheesecake.

My daughter-in-law used this recipe for her very first cheesecake...took it to her office party and it was the hit of party! Her boss kept asking her if she really made it, and telling her how great it tasted. I will be making it very soon. I really appreciate reading all of the reviews.

So...this was my first cheesecake and I'm so glad I went with this recipe. I made it for a party and it was perfect! I was a little nervous because I watched it rise while baking and I was worried that I didn't something wrong. Maybe that's normal, I don't know, but it went back down and the taste and texture was perfect. I followed the recipe as is and I got many comments on how great it was.

This cake is awesome! I made some minor changes namely adding rum, more vanilla, using a little less milk (because i personally like my cheesecake nice and heavy) and using powdered sugar in place of white sugar in order to get the filling as smooth as possible, as well as covering the baking tin with aluminium foil to keep in the moisture. I also found it beneficial to run the filling through a strainer to get rid of all the lumps. When it came out it was perfect, not cracked, and it was so creamy and decadent. I used a store-bought strawberry pie filling as my topping and it was good to go!

I've made a few cheesecakes in the past and none compare to this one! So easy to make and it turned out great. A couple of recommendations to definitely follow are to mix the eggs in last by hand and not to over mix! Then, I did bake mine in the water bath for 1 hour and turned the oven off. I left it in for 6 hours afterwards (my oven always takes forever) and it only had one crack (I think it was because I overmixed). I then let it chill in the fridge and covered the entire cheesecake in melted dark chocolate. It was amazing!

This is only the second cheesecake I have ever made, and it is delicious!!  Followed the recipe exact, except used graham cracker crumbs b/c I had already bought them before I found this recipe.  Mine cracked on top, but I know that is because of my errors, not the recipe.  (forgot to run a knife around the edge) Will be using this recipe again!!

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made and I was SO proud of it! I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and he couldn't have been happier. READ THE REVIEWS and it will turn out great. I baked it in a water bath, made sure I greased and floured the pan, and left it in the oven for about 3 hours after baking. I also turned the heat down once I put it in the oven. **I made a chocolate shortbread cookie crust, which was marvelous. Ground 15 shortbread cookies, and half a bar of dark chocolate. Mixed with 4tbps. melted butter. Delicious! I also put a simple raspberry sauce on top from another review.

Stellar! I let cream cheese and eggs come to room temp, but not sour cream or half & half (which I substituted for milk). No water bath, but did let the cake sit in turned off oven for 6 hours.

First off, know that I do not know how to cook. That being said, no one has ever turned their nose up when I make this. I have even had friends ask to buy them. This is the the best cheesecake recipe ever. Probably as good as The Cheesecake Factory! I printed this out originally 3 or 4 years ago. I looked it up again today because that printout is worn out. I found tips to making cheesecakes on all recipes and have never had one turn out bad.

Fabulous!  Made it last night :)  Make sure to read the tips on making a good cheesecake first found on this site.  I incorporated many of those tips when making and it turned out perfect.  I also added a couple tsp sugar to the crust mixture.

Absolutely love this cheesecake. I've only made it once but my family gobbled it up and the entire cake was gone in 10 minutes. I use 2c graham crackers and 4 tbsp butter with a dash of cinnamon for the crust and I poured a chocolate glaze on top before serving and it was FAB! I got the chocolate glaze recipe from Paula Deen.

5 stars!! Came out perfect with no cracks. I did use a water bath and allowed it to cool in the oven for 2 hours. I then topped it with chocilate covered strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries. Beautiful!! Check out my profile pic for it.

I recently made this cheesecake for my wedding.  It was my first time making cheesecake, so we decided to make it a few times before the wedding to make sure it would come out ok and every one was PERFECT!!!!   The BEST cheesecake I've ever had, and my mother-in-law agrees(and she herself is famous for her amoretto cheesecake).  Was a huge hit!  It even freezes really really well!!

Great recipe! It was my first time making a cheesecake and I followed the recipe and came out with almost perfect results. The cheesecake was a little too brown on the top for my tastes and it did crack (no water bath but did put a pan of water underneath the middle rack that I baked the cheesecake at). The taste though! It was so yummy and everyone really loved it. Some claimed it was the best they had ever had because of its moistness. I added lemon juice to mine and it enhanced the flavor tremendously. This is a purist's cheesecake so keep that in mind when making this.

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake, and even though it did crack, it still tasted WONDERFUL and I received many compliments on it.  Will definitely be making this again!

OMG, this cake is delicous... Everyone loved it and it's so worth the wait... I do not use the crust on this recipe. I buy "Honey Maid" graham cracker crumbs. 1 1/2 graham cracker crumbs, 1 tablespoon sugar, 6 tablespoons of butter melted. To keep crust from getting soggy in water bath I wrap the bottom of the springform with aluminum foil. Pat the crumbs on the bottom of springform pan, bake for 8 mins, let cool to room temp. Then, you can continue with the recipe instructions.

This was good and easy, the whole family enjoyed it.  Great texture too.  I think you could cut back to only 3 packages of cream cheese - it ends up being about 2 1/2 inches high!  I prefer mine a little sweeter so if you use all 4 packages of cream cheese then i suggest adding a topping like cherries or some other fruit filling.

Perfect, fast and easy!!!! I added powdered chocolate to 1/4 of the cheeses mixture and added it last to the cake by dropping blobs of it on the plain cheese and swirling with a butter knife. This made a beautiful chocolate swirl cheese cake. YUMMY!!!!! Will do again! The only thing that I wasn't sure of is how much graham crumbs to use as I bought mine already crushed so I tried by adding crumbs then butter then crumbs again and then butter until I got it right.

I just had a slice of this; I made it last night.  I followed the directions with the cooling in the oven step. I went to check it barely an hour after cooking, and it was already cracked.  The top of it is not white; it is very golden along the edge.  The texture is not what I was hoping for. It's strangely moist and not as thick/dense.  The flavor is very bland. I didn't get much of a taste from it at all, especially not the classic decadence that cheesecake is notorious for.  This recipe was very disappointing. I will never make it again.

WOW ok, I made other cheesecakes before but this one came out amazing. I don't have a big enough dish to do the steam bath but it still came out SO moist. It was such an easy one to make! It's first time backing it in this oven and it seems that 350 a bit higher than most ovens at 350 because it got brownish on top. Either way, I came out so yummy.

Fantastic recipe!! For a bit of a change I separated the filling into two halves. The plain half I poured into my springform pan as instructed, The other half I mixed with half a cup of Dulce de Leche caramel. I then poured the Carmel mix on top of the Plain half and mixed it in with a butter knife slicing it back and forth. When It was done cooking The cake had a nice marble look to it and had a sweet dulce de leche flavor.

Great flavor, very rich. The directions about not opening the oven were great. I cooked mine in an 8" pan and had to turn the (convection) oven off 15 mins early because it was browning.

i am not a novice to baking cheesecakes but in the past i've always used a bain marie when making them (they usually turn out picture perfect).  i decided to try chantal's recipe without the bain marie because it was so highly rated and honestly, if i can skip a step why not?  the batter looked great (NB> i am very careful not to overmix my cheesecakes) and all was well until *holy smokes* it cracked!  before cooling even.  i now have a cheesecake that looks likes the grand canyon is running through it.  in the future i will not cut out the bain marie step!  i may up the rating after i try it... but for now all i have to say is THANK GOODNESS i have a berry sauce to put on top otherwise i would be making something else to take to a dinner tonight!

I served this at friend's baby shower, it was fantastic! I didn't have a spring form pan so I put it in a 9in. cake pan. There was extra filling so I had to put some in another pan :) I also put a sour cream topping on it using 1 cup sour cream, 2T. sugar, splash of vanilla during the last 10 mins. of baking. Amazing!

Made this for my girlfriend the other day.  She absolutely loved it.  said it was the best cheesecake she has ever had.  i did make a simple topping from fresh blueberries.  that was simple, blueberries and a few tbs of sugar heated to boiling and then straight to refridgerator.  This simple recipe earned me major "bonus points".

I made this cheese cake for the 4th of July 2010. I baked it in a 9X13 so I could decorate it with fresh blueberries for stars & fresh raspberries for the stripes.. other then baking it in a different pan, I followed the recipe precisely. The end result was a cheesecake with several cracks (I had spread cool whip on my cooled off cheesecake so no big to do) that had an OUTSTANDING taste!  It was definately a new york cheesecake! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe =)

I followed directly, it rose twice above height of  spring form pan and then browned way too much for my liking. BUT- DELICIOUS! The taste was awesome , everyone raved anyway!

I am a cheesecake fan, and have tried quite a lot cheesecake recipes. I am telling you, this is my go-to recipe from now on! I sometimes alter it by making a chocolate crust, out of oreo cookies and melted butter. Yummy!

This is the first cheesecake I have ever made and it was a great success. When I read the recipe and reviews I was intimidated by the amount of work involved. I did not want to go through the process and end up with a sunken, cracked cake. However, after reading numerous reviews and picking and choosing instructions from each one I made a great cake that my coworkers raved about. I used Laurelc43’s instructions for baking the cake @ 225 for 3hrs40min. I also used cut the flour to 2tbs. For the crust I used about 10-15 graham crackers, seven pecan sandies, 1/8 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tbs nutmeg, ¼ cup of butter and ¼ cup of brown sugar. The crust was sweet so if you don’t want it too sweet cut the sugar. I used a reviewers suggestion to use an oven bag but found that condensation still got inside of the bag. I was not sure if I was supposed to seal the bag or simply sit the pan in the bag and fold the bag down on the side of the pan so next time I will wrap the pan in foil as well. The one problem I had was the crust sticking to the bottom of the pan (yes, I did grease the pan). Overall, this was the best cheesecake I have had in years and I will make it again.

Wow what a flalwless recipe! And like the other  reviewer said...if it doesn't turn out it's you or you oven. If you want true New York dense Cheesecake this is it! I made blackberry sauce for the top, 4 cups  blackberries and 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 tbsp lemon juce. Cook down and run it through a sieve place back on stove add 2 tsp cornstartch disolved in water to the blackberries. Then add lemon juice. MMM MMM good...what a winner

I find that if you do NOT modify this recipe it is a WASHOUT!  My husband liked it, that is liked NOT loved. I did not care for it. It tasted like custard pie and looked NOTHING like the picture posted. I did cut the recipe in half and hand mixed everything, so maybe that was the mistake.

Great tasting cheesecake! This was my first ever cheesecake experience and I have to admit I was a little nervous after reading all of the other reviews - I didn't even realize there was a potential of cracking. Unfortunately, mine cracked, but based on other reviews, that means that I did something wrong (which is certainly possible!). I served this at a bridal shower on a whim and it turned out great - I was very proud of my first cheesecake making experience.

I have been making this for years and do not change anything with it...although I cheat and use pre-made graham cracker crusts which actually yields 2 cheesecakes.  There is so many great things you can add into this base recipe, some of my favorites are pineapple, strawberries of course, I have tried amaretto and used an oreo crust before and it was marvelous.

Good cheesecake, but i was scared to whip in too much air and have it crack. Mine was denser than it could have been, but it tasted good! My friend made this first and she used electric beaters to make hers and it was fluffier than mine.  Next time i'll beat the first part a lot more.. and maybe add a bit more sugar, mine wasn't very sweet at all, overall a really good cheesecake though!

The best cheesecake recipe!  I added a bit more butter to the crust mixture and think this may have made it a little soggy.  Maybe pre-baking the crust before filling it with the cheesecake mixture would fix this problem.  The actual cheesecake part though was rich, creamy and dense just like the cheesecake factory.  I did bake mine in a foil wrapped springform pan and placed in water bath. It turned out perfect with no cracks, bubbles or browning.  I highly recommend this recipe if you like cheesecake factory results.

I have made this cheesecake tons of times.  Everyone absolutely loves it! I do add some crushed walnuts to the crust along with the graham crackers.  I also bake the cheesecake in a water bath and also use pam for the sides of the pan.  I find that greasing the sides really helps prevent the cracking.  Amazing cheesecake and am looking forward to making more!

This recipe is awesome as is!  I followed the ingredients exactly, but did make sure I didn't overbeat anything and I did use the water bath or bain marie that other people had talked about.  My co-workers loved it and said that it was better than the cheesecake factory!

I don't review recopes as much as I should, or very often, but I HAVE to review this one!  This is the most perfect cheesecake recipe I have ever tried!  No cracks, perfect tecture, awesome taste.  If yours cracks, then you probably over mixed it.  I have tried several other cheesecakes on here, and probably due to my fault, they cracked, or just didn't taste right.  I have made this 3 times now and it has come out perfect everytime!  No more boxed cheesecakes for me!

The cheesecake turned out well, I gave it 4 stars as the texture was more coarse than I would have liked.  Other than that, the flavor was good.

Excellent! I made the cheesecake following the directions exactly. I doubled the quantities for the graham crackers crust for a thicker crust. I did not have a suitable pan for a water bath, so I put a pan of water on the rack underneath the cheesecake (I preheated it with the oven, don't know if that matters). I received tons of complements and the cheesecake was gone! I highly recommend this recipe.

Good things happen when you wait...this has been the best cheesecake that I have ever made. The instructions fit to a "T" and I have never had a crack in the middle of my cheesecake. Even this last time when the cheesecake couldn't sit in the waterbath, I just placed the waterbath directly below the cheesecake and it worked out just as well. I had no complaints and will continue to use this as a base cheesecake in the future. Thanks!!!

Oops, I forgot to add the flour but it turned out fine.  The center was a bit jiggly after the 1 hour bake time but I left in the turned off oven for 2 hours and it turned out fine.  A small crack developed even with the water bath method, but no biggee, the taste is what counts.  Remember - Cheesecake is always better day 2, 3, or 4, if you can get it to last that long...

This cheesecake was a hit at my Easter party! What people liked about it most, was that it was creamy instead of thick. Will make again! I didn't use a water bath and it still didn't crack. Let's see if it can win my city's baking contest in August!

fantastic!!!!  I made 2 changes, since we live in the UK and don't have access to graham crackers....  so I substituted: 1 1/2 C. digestives and 1/4 C butter.   Followed others advice:  put a pan of water into the oven while cooking (rather than water bath) and ran a knife around the edge after 1hr cooking time. Then left it to cool in the oven over night.

Ok, now i havent tasted it yet. Saving it for an Easter dinner tomorrow. BUT I did follow all the suggestions so it wouldnt crack. Mine STILL cracked. I used room temp ingrediants, I did bake it in a water bath, put 2 layers of foil around my springform, and let it bake for 60 minutes, used a buttered knife to seperate the cheesecake and the pan then let it sit in the oven for 5 hours. IT STILL CRACKED! What else could I have done!!!  Not only did it crack, but I also got WATER in the bottom of my crust. Now if my crust is mushy tomorrow....I will NOT be impressed...
So my crust was not only mushy, but completely inedible. I understand it was not the recipe's fault, as I followed reviews instead of sticking to the tried, tested and true recipe. I know better for next time, because there WILL be a next time. The cheesecake itself turned out fantastic. Very creamy, and rich and good. I do not reccomend putting it in a water bath. Mine cracked anyways, plus it leaked water in my crust, and made the crust horrible.

I found this recipe and made for a special occasion last Fall.  It was an astounding hit!  My family and friends love the taste, texture and flavors.  It is so light and creamy in texture and flavored with rich vanilla....perfect!  I have made it several times since and it has received rave reviews.  My family loves it so much they have  requested it for this Easter Sunday dinner!

I've never made cheesecake before but honestly this tasted amazing, my entire family said it was the best they've ever had, it was incredibly moist. I baked it inside of a pan with an inch of water. FLAWLESS

This cheesecake has a great flavor and is very easy to make. I had no cracking when I made it and thought the taste was superb. The only suggestions I would make are adding more butter to the graham crust and do not open the oven door at all while baking or setting! When the time is up, turn the oven off and just forget about the cheesecake for the 5-6 hours. Awesome recipe.

This was a great "starter" cheesecake. I put a pie tin with an inch of water at the bottom on the lower rack in lieu of a waterbath and messing with wraping the pan in aluminum foil. I also used half the flour. Left in the oven only about 90 min as it was starting to get a bit dark.  Turned out perfect, my father-in-law loved it (it was for his birthday), and I served it with fresh sliced berries. Definitely will be used by me in the future.

I have not come across one person that has tasted this recipe that is not in love with the cheescake. I took others advice by dolling up the crust a bit. Add 1T cinniman, 1/4T nutmeg, and 1/2c chopped nuts (ie. walnuts or pecans), 1/2c white sugar, one graham cracker brick, mix all the ingredients with a food processor until finely choppped. Add 1/4c melted butter. As for the batter there was post about using a bath water and baking at 225 for 3hrs. and 40minutes. This is the key to a perfect cheesecake!!!!  Also, only use 2T of flour. Leave the cheesecake in the oven with the door cracked for 6 hours after baking. Then put in the fridge for at least 6 hours. Then tada you have heaven in your hands.

Love this cheesecake, but beware let the cream cheese warm up to room temperature before using or you will have lumps. Also consider using a water bath to cook the cake. I followed the instructions and had a large crack in the middle of the cake. The crack did not effect the taste, I'll definatly make this again.

Very good. I made a shortbread crust instead of the graham and baked it 10 minutes before adding the filling. I did have leftover filling which I used and made muffin size cheesecakes. I also cook the cheesecake in a water bath and it came out perfect, no cracks. I left it in the oven for 2 hours after baking.

This is a recipe that I have wanted to try for years after seeing all the beautiful photos and great reviews from others.  I did use a different graham cracker crust recipe, but followed the filling instructions exactly.  I thought this was good, but not very flavorful.  I ended up with a significant five-pointed crack that was about an inch deep...sort of a decoration across the entire top of the cheesecake even though I oiled the sides of the spring form pan all the way up and also let it cool for the full amount of time in the oven.  Next time I make a cheesecake I will probably try a different recipe, but if I do make this one again, I'll make sure to use a water bath and also add a little more vanilla.

I used chocolate graham crackers instead of plain ones. For some reason, the crust was very dry and crumbly - I don't know if this was because of the graham crackers I used or something else. Other than that, it was delicious. Very rich!

If you want the New York style of cheesecake, this is the recipe for you.  I followed the recipe to the "T" and it came out wonderful.  I served it with a berry sauce that I made, and it was requested again shortly thereafter or a birthday.  I will only use this recipe from now on.  Terrific!

It didn't turn out very pretty, which is probably my fault but I thought it tasted delicious. VERY thick. My boyfriend prefers the lighter fluffier cheesecake so he wasn't a fan, but I enjoyed it!

I made this cheesecake (AGAIN) and (AGAIN) rocked our world. The kids were licking the pan clean. (AGAIN)(*ONLY change: I used graham cracker crumbs and measured 1 and 1/4 cup plus 1/4 cup sugar plus 1 stick butter for the crust. If you do this DO NOT GREASE THE SPRINGFORM PAN OR YOUR WHOLE HOUSE WILL SMOKE!) Chantal RULES!

Wow!!  I would recommend this rich, delicious cheesecake recipe to anyone.  I had never made a cheesecake before, and was very nervous.  I followed the directions and it came out beautifully.  There was some cracking on top, but who cares?  I gave slices to everyone at work, and people were raving.  Everyone said it was better than a restaurant.  While pressing the crust into the pan, it looked like it needed more butter...but in the end, more butter is unnecessary.  Just trust the recipe - it won't steer you wrong!  I will definitely make this one again and again!

EDIT - GLUTEN FREE: I made this again for my mother's birthday.  She is allergic to wheat, so I made the cake using a package of gluten-free gingersnaps in place of the graham crackers for the crust.  In place of flour in the cake, I used a special gluten-free flour blend that my father developed using various commercial non-wheat flours.  (You could also use a commercially available blend.)  Then I put fresh fruit on top.  The cake tasted exactly the same, except with a gingery crust.  Nobody could believe it was gluten-free!  My mom was so excited.  If someone in your family has celiac disease, this can be a great gluten-free special occasion cake.

This is probably the best homemade cheesecake I've had and it's so easy to make.  As others have said, if it fails, it's because you're doing something wrong!  I use a water bath (wrap the pan twice in heavy duty foil - it never leaks), preheat my oven, make sure all ingredients are at room temperature and don't over-beat!  I don't know if this helps or not but I use a KitchenAid stand mixer on its slowest speed to mix.  I also rap the batter bowl on the counter after mixing in order to eliminate as many air bubbles as possible.  Additionally, right before I put the cake in the oven, I rap the pan gently on the counter - again, to eliminate any air bubbles.  Only thing I do different for the recipe itself is that I use a different graham crust as I like mine to have a little sugar and cinnamon.  I serve the cheesecake with a homemade raspberry or blueberry sauce and it gets RAVE reviews EVERY time!  Hope everyone else enjoys this one as much as I do!

This was actually very easy and on my first try I made a delicious New York style cheesecake.  I used a bathwater and allowed all the ingredients to warm up to room temperature before combining them. While it was tempting to peek in the oven, I am glad that I didn't because I got a uniform, creamy and rich cake without any drying or cracking.  As it may have been suggested, wrap the bottom of your springform pan in aluminum foil before putting it in the bathwater to help eliminate a soggy crust. Keep in mind that this is a NEW YORK STYLE CHEESECAKE, and TRUE TO THAT STYLE, it is creamy, firm, and not extremely sweet, perfect for including sweet additions and/or toppings. This recipe is more Martha Stewart and less Paula Deen, if you know what I'm sayin'.

This is a really great tasting cheesecake. I always end up making 2 cheese cake with this recipe. I read other review and I did follow the water bath direction. My cheesecake looks great with the water bath but it did crack when I didn't use one. Everyone love the cheesecake.

I followed the directions exactly (including not stirring too much) and while the cheesecake looked nice, it didn't taste right.  The texture was not smooth enough and the flavor was much too eggy.  Considering all the positive reviews, I think I must have done something wrong, but I am not going to bother trying this again.

I am disappointed in this - esp after how long it took to make.  It was just bland and if it wasn't for the fact I had cherries to put on top, I probably would have just thrown it out.  This is not how NY cheesecake tastes from my experiences with it growing up out there!  It just was not rich at all.  If I make it again I'd probably add a lot more cream cheese.  Guess my hunt for the perfect cheesecake recipe continues

I used one person's idea of using Bailey's instead of milk, and I didn't really enjoy it. I'll have to try this recipe again just as is. Oh, and I also used that same person's recipe for the graham crust... gross! 1/4 cup of butter is waaaaaaay too much for the crust. But the person who said leave the cheesecake in the oven and don't touch it... they are right. It won't crack if you do that. But be careful with the cooking time... in my oven, 1 hour was too long. I'll try 50 minutes next time and turn oven off and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for a few hours.

Followed the directions, except I could not wait the whole 6 hours, so we settled for 4.  We also used a water bath.  This will be the recipe I use from now on.  This is the perfect texture and taste.  We topped with canned cherries for half, and a raspberry sauce we made for the other half.  Superb!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent recipe. I use the water bath technique and the cheesecake looked and tasted amazing. This is a recipe my family continues to ask me to make for occasions.

This cheesecake recipe is perfect and amazing. My family said it tasted just like a cheesecake from a deli or restaurant. I followed the instructions to a T, with a few hints from the comments section. I made sure my ingredients were warmed to room temperature, I was very careful not to overmix, and I ran a knife around the edge of the pan about an hour after turning off the oven. I only let it sit in the oven for about 4 hours before transferring to the fridge, then I let it cool in there for almost 3 hours before serving. The consistency was nothing short of perfect, and I only had one crack about a centimeter long. This cheesecake will not disappoint you if you follow the directions!

Well, I have to say I followed this recipe EXACTLY, and was less than pleased.  Bland ... not very sweet or flavorful.  I don't know if the author meant 15 individual crackers or the sheets, but 15 ind. crackers and 2 TB of butter are NOT enough crust for a cheesecake so thick.  And mine cracked, too, even though I just mixed the ingredients and kept it in the oven after turning it off.  Sorry, not impressed!!!

heaven.
added a little lemon zest, baked at 350 for the first 15 minutes, then dropped the temp to 250 for the last 45 minutes. changed the servings to 9 (3 packages of cream cheese) and used only 2 rounded tablespoons of flour.
Spray the sides, no water bath.
yummy

Aaaah, the cheesecake.  So delicious. I brought it to a New Year Eve dinner part and it was a major hit.  People were all over me for the recipe.  And that never happens to me :)   BUT, I had to make the cake twice - the first one didn't turn out. It was lumpy and very cracked. Here's what I did different the second time around:  1.  Cooked at 325 degrees for 1 hour.  Immediately took cake out of oven and knifed around the edges of the cake pan and then quickly put back in oven to cool.  (my aunt the cheesecake expert told me to do this and it worked). After one hour the cake was still jiggly in the center and looked unbaked. But it set further as it was cooling.  2.  Seriously, the cream cheese has to be at room temperature.  And mix it well with the sugar. I was worried about overbeating.  I think its the later ingrediants that you have to go easy on the mixing.  3.  DO NOT mix in the flour and vanilla together. What a nightmare - my first cake had brown lumps in it. YUCK!  Good luck and be careful, these cakes are fiddly. But well worth it.  I froze my first cake and have been eating it too (not so bad tasting even though it is ugly)

This was by far the best cheesecake that I've ever made. It cracked, but I didn't care. Who cares, when it tastes sooo good! I did everything by the book and it cracked, but I will try a few tricks. I didn't have time to read everyone's reviews before making it, so I will try the tips given. Definitely wait to eat it. It tastes sooo much better the next day. Texture is perfect, tastes yummy, soo good! Thanks!

I made this in a jelly roll pan without a crust.  Baked it at 400F for 10 min, turned down to 200F and cooked another 20 min., turned the oven off, and didn't open it until morning. Very good flavor and texture.  Only problem was trying to mix in the flour without clumps.

Absolutely delicious! Its hard to find a perfect cheesecake recipe, but this did it! I added chocolate chips and marshmellows to one and it turned at great. It's a simple recipe that can be eaten as is or you can mix it up! I'm saving this.

DO NOT DISREGARD THIS STEP: MAKE SURE CREAM CHEESE IS ROOM TEMPERATURE! I WAS TOO IMPATIENT TO WAIT ANY LONGER SO THE BATTER WAS LUMPY WITH A FEW OCASSIONAL CREAM CHEESE LUMPS BUT OTHERWISE SO GOOD!

I have never made a homemade cheesecake before this and I am so glad I tried it. If you buy store bought grahm cracker crusts this recipes makes 3 pies!! I was able to give one to my in laws and parents, and still had one for myself. Delicious and simple to make.

The best cheesecake I've ever made. I used five  pkgs of cream cheese and no flour, but no other ingredient changes. We're at 7500 ft, so baking time was about 15 minutes longer. I used the usual advice: water bath, leave in over for cooling, then in fridge overnight. It still had minor cracks, but stood up tall, was very creamy. Thanks a million, Chantal.

Well, I was extremely skeptical of this recipe, having never before made one that called for flour, or that was completely liquid when I poured it in...I thought, "That's never going to set up!" But it did! Mine did crack down the center a bit, but I expected it to since I didn't use a water bath. I planned to top the pie with blackberry pie filling all along, and did so. It baked up tall, and fluffy, and almost the exact same consistency as cheesecakes from a well-known cheesecake making restaurant, which is what I was going for. I was very pleased! (P.S. I used 2 pkgs regular cream cheese and 2 pkgs 1/3rd less fat.)

I followed this recipe to a T and incorporated the advice included in other reviews for a well-textured product.  I gave this one three stars:  zero for flavor and 5 for texture.  I LOVE cheesecakes, and it's not that the flavor was BAD (I've never met a cheesecake I DIDN'T like), but it certainly lacked the 'tang' associated with cream cheese that makes me sacrifice my hips for the cheesecake cause.  I don't know if it was masked by the flour or the sour cream or what, but it definitely wasn't there.  My sister, on the other hand, commented that it was the best cheesecake she's ever had, but her idea of cheesecake is thawing out a round brick from the freezer section and calling it good.  This was the first "from-scratch, homemade" cake she's had, and I'm accostumed to cheesecakes whose life didn't begin in a factory.  I didn't find the consistency to be too 'cakey', but pretty consistent other with New York Cheesecakes.  My overall conclusion was, "Meh".

I've made this multiple times and it is by far the best homemade cheesecake I've ever had. It is very moist, creamy, and delicious. The only complaint, however, is that it still cracked every time, no matter how little I beat it or how much I greased the pan. I am convinced that it's my oven, but I'm okay with it as long as it tastes good!  Add fresh raspberries or the strawberry topping (my personal fave) and it is truly amazing! You pretty much can't screw it up if you follow the directions exactly.

This was my first cheesecake ever and I have to say I was very, very happy with the results. I buttered the sides as it said in the reviews and left the cheesecake in the oven for an hour only and it came out great! No cracking, no weird texture and simply delicious.

This is a fabulous recipe and the reviews were really helpful. I read a lot of the reviews and have listed the ones I used.  I brought this to a family gathering and got great reviews, an empty platter back and multiple requests for the recipe...  The tips I used from reading the reviews:  1. The person who thought to use an oven bag instead of tin foil for the water bath is a genius, it worked perfect, didn't leak and the top never cracked. (wish I would have thought of that)I didn't use a rubberband ... I just rolled the edges out so that it stayed up and fit...  2. I made sure to use my mixer only to beat the cream cheese and sugar and hand mixed everything else... this made for a nice dense cheesecake.  3. I listened and did not open the oven(eventhough I wanted to)... I'll be honest, I used the oven light and looked in at the hour mark and really questioned if I should turn off the oven.  I followed the directions and it was perfect. I made this the evening before and left it in the oven all night and first thing in the morning put in the fridge... by the time we left for our party it was well chilled and no cracks...  4.  Spraying the pan so the crust doesn't stick is essential (I have never had a cheesecake come out the pan that easily)  5.  I used Bailey's Irish Cream instead of Milk... (same amount of liquid) and it had a great taste.  6.  I did put sugar in the crust as many people suggested.  I usually do anyways so I would say this is a good tip.

I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out.  It did crack last time I made it but I'm sure that's some fault of mine and not the recipe.  Always a big hit with the family!

This is the Best Cheesecake Recipe! I followed other peoples reviews and used a water bath to bake the cheesecake in so it didn't dry out & covered the outside of the pan with foil so the water didn't leak in. I also used a foil tent while baking so the top did not brown.  I also added more crumbs than the recipe called for to the crust to make it thicker and more butter also. It turned out great, I just made it for thanksgiving and everyone loved it.

Our cheesecake cracked even with spraying the sides, but I think it was in the oven too long.  Next time I'll try the reviewer's suggestion that said turn off the oven as soon as you put it in and let it sit several hours.  It was still so delicious - just like authentic NY cheesecake!

Wow!  This recipe is really starting to give me a reputation as chef...even though I beat and stirred the ingredients by hand rather than use my wive's fancy mixer.  I tried this recipe yesterday for a "cheese party" that we hosted last night.  The guests were blown away.  The cheesecake was smooth and creamy.  Not too heavy or dense.  I did use about double the amount of butter in the crust.  It was about as perfect as a cheesecake could be...and it was my first try at cheesecake!  Once again I'm thankful to allrecipes.com and the great reviewers' comments.

I made this exactly as stated, except that I topped it with blueberries (baked on).  I cooked  a 12 pkg of blueberries with 2tbsp flour and 4 tbsp cold water.  I cooked it until it was thickened, about 10 minutes.  It was wonderful...and perfectly cooked.  My only problem was I didn't have a springform pan, so I used a cake pan and the crust ended up being soft and sticking to the bottom (although i greased it.)

This may replace the Bon Appetit cheesecake recipe that we've used for years!  Wonderful texture.  Easy to make!  I was hesitant to follow the directions and leave it cooling in the oven... but I did and it was even perfect.  (I actually wasn't even home.  I set the timed cook clock on the oven and left after I put it in the oven!)   Read the reviews about cooking with a water bath.  We'd never done that before... but it really helped prevent cracking!  Had to modify the crust a little bit: added more grahams and more butter, as there wasn't enough to cover the bottom of my pan.

This is a fantastic recipe for true cheesecake although I did modify it a little on my second attempt. When I prepared it as directed I found it to be a little too sweet and a little too creamy (kind of like a box mix cheesecake) so, I dialed back the sugar to around 1.25 cups and I upped the flour to about .50 of a cup and it came out the consistency of a cheesecake you'd get at Cheesecake Factory or persoanlly it came out like the cake a friend of the family typically makes for the holidays.

Incredible recipe if you do it right. My first try I couldn't get the water bath right. The cheesecake tasted good, but didn't have that good cheesecake texture to it and was more like a regular cake. Then I purchased extra-large aluminum foil and used that around the spring form pan so that I could use just one piece. This worked great! The cheesecake came out looking like what you would get from the Cheesecake Factory or from a nice restaurant. Now I'm totally into making these and will be making more at Christmas.

This recipe rocks!  This was my first cheesecake attempt.  By following the recipe and reading the other reviews I made a cheesecake that is better than the cake in our favorite bakery.  I doubled the butter for the crust and added one egg white as someone else had suggested.  My crust held together perfectly.  Now I know what to make for our Brownie bake sale!  Thank you!

This long island girl LOVED this cheesecake! I made this exactly as directed in a 10in springform pan and it came out PERFECT. No crack, perfectly white and thick but still creamy. My whole NY family loved it.

I have found a holiday mainstay dessert & vow never to buy a ready-made cheesecake again.   Mine cracked but I think that one of the teenagers disturbed it during the hours in the oven... nobody cared!  Definitely make this if you want to impress!!!

This was great! I've never made cheesecake before, and decided to give it a shot for Thanksgiving...I know so daring :-)  I changed this recipe up a bit, for the crust I did a ginger snap crust (1.5 cups of crumbled gingersnaps, 1/4 cup of sugar, and 1/2 cup melted butter) and after I baked it and waited for it to cool I made pumpkin chiffon.  I took off about 1/2 of the top layer of the cheesecake and layered on the pumpkin chiffon.  This made it a double layered cake, half cheesecake and half pumpkin chiffon.  The pumpkin chiffon is very light and frothy so it was a nice compliment to the heaviness of the cheesecake.  It was so yummy, I'm making it for work tomorrow!

Made this for Thanksgiving.  Used a stand mixer to mix all ingredients.  Everything was at room temperature.  I removed the cheesecake from the oven after letting it rest for about an hour and a half.  The top was slightly browned on the edges.  After being out of the oven for about 15 minutes it cracked.  Still tasted delicious!  It disappeared faster than the turkey.  I am going to make another one for Christmas.  Everyone told me it tasted like a restaurant quality cheesecake, and I agree. NOTE:  I wasn't sure if the 15 graham crackers meant 15 sheets, or 15 quarters, so I tried 15 quarters first, it wasn't nearly enough, so I went with 15 sheets.  This made a nice crust just under about 1/4 inch.  I packed it lightly with the bottom of a glass into a spring form pan. I baked the cheesecake without any water bath on the center rack for an hour, then left it for an hour and a half with the oven off.  In hindsight I think I should have baked it for about 45 minutes, then let it rest.

I haven't wrote a review in years, but this exceptional.  I made this one a couple of years ago, and it's still the best, but I just did things a little differently. My husband grabbed pre-made graham cracker crust instead of the boxed kind and it still came out great.  Matter of fact, the filling was enough for two pre-made graham cracker crusts. Definetly use the water bath concept and make sure eggs and cream cheese are room temperature; my cheesecake has never cracked.

I made this cheesecake for our thanksgiving dessert as directed.  The only problem I had was even though I followed the cooking and cooling directions the cake still cracked.  I would recommend adding a dish of water on the rack below the cheesecake while cooking and cooling to help prevent the cracking.  Excellent taking cheesecake none the less!!!!!

OMG! A PERFECT cheesecake! I followed the directions to a tee and it came out delicious, and no cracks! I used a water bath and left the cheesecakes in the oven for a couple hours after baking. I used a raspberry topping with whipped cream to top it off. Overall, a very delicious cheesecake and it earned me alot of compliments! Glad I saved one for Thanksgiving tomorrow!

THis is the  second cheesecake I've made using this recipe. I baked it differently and it came out with no craccks.  Preheat oven to 350, put cheesecake in and immediately turn down to 250. BAke for 90 minutes, then shut off oven, but DO NOT OPEN DOOR at any time, and leave in for a few more hours. Also, put a pan of water directly under the cheesecake.  This works great. . no cracking, beautiful smoothe top like from the deli.

I haven't eaten this yet, but will update when I do. I'm like a proud mama over this cheese cake. It is so beautiful! This was my first attempt at a cheese cake and I'm so happy with the out come. I mixed everything with a stand mixer on low, helping it along with a rubber spatula here and there. Make sure to ADD THE EGGS LAST! You do not want to mix very much after the eggs are added because it will make the cake crack. I was too scared to try a water bath so I just put a roasting pan full of water on the shelf below. I'm going to serve it with the chocolate  brandy sauce from the  White Chocolate Cheese Cake with Brandy Sauce recipe from this site. Can't wait to eat it!

really amazing.  i used 2 tbs instead of 1/4 cup flour. i also use this recipe along with the double layer pumpkin cheesecake from this site.... basically take this recipe, pour half in the spring-form, then with the remaining half, add 1 3/4 or 2 cups of pumpkin puree, 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 2 pinches of clove, 2 pinches of nutmeg. then pour this pumpkin mixture on top of of the first layer.  bake as usual.  (you can also just use a can of pumpkin pie filling- already has the spices in there.  or if using the puree, you can vary the amount of puree and spices depending on your liking) soooo good!!

Simply put- This is the best cheesecake ever! I do make a slightly differnt crust for it as I added some crushed almonds, brown sugar and cinnamon for a delicious taste.  I haven't had any problems with cracking at all and I have made this recipe several times. It really does taste like it was store bought, only better!

just awesome . I baked it for a few friends, they thought I had bought at a deli. I used Speculoos biscuits for the base and made a cherry topping : cherries with juice in glass jar, I boiled the juice with sugar and a spoonful of maizena, put the cherry on top the cheesecake and cover with the thick cherry juice and back to the fridge. thank you so much for this fab recipe.

I had an 11 inch pan and I didn't adjust the baking time or the heat of the oven so the edges came out a little dry and a little dark for my taste but the middle was so creamy and delicious!!! I will definately make it again and cook it on 300-325 until I get it perfect. Everyone else didn't think it was too dry or too brown. EVERYONE LOVED IT!!! Thanks. P.S. I was always very intimidated when it came to cooking cheesecake, but with this recipe and all the tips... its a breeze!!!!

Can't rate this recipe too highly.  Easy to make and gives 12 substantial portions.  Just about the most delicious, authentic cheesecake I've come across.

I did not care for this recipe.  First of all, the amount of butter for the crust is too little.  Then after following the recipe to a T, the center of the cheesecake was gooey and raw.  I have never had that happen to me. After cooking it more, at a lower temperature, for 20 minutes, it looked no better.  Overall, tasted raw, very egg-like and bland.  I will never make this again

My daughter and I made this cheesecake. It was the best we have tasted homemade period. My wife who hates cheesecake was sneaking a piece last night. It came out very creamy and tasty. We also took one reviewers advice and cooked it in a bath. Thank you for the recipe. My little girl and I will be cooking soon.

I made this recipe and added cinnamon and cardamom to the crust and the cake itself too.  It made it really amazing!  My husband's coworker said it made him weak in the knees!

I only gave this recipe 4 stars. I believe as others that you should rate the recipe as written. the top of my cheesecake got brown. the cooking temp. stated is to hot.the crust is to dry and won't stay on cheesecake when sliced. the flavor is great. the recipe needs a little tweeking.

I omitted the flour accidentally, which I don't think was a big deal.  The texture still turned out okay but the taste was rather eggy.  I do agree that baking at 300 degrees would have worked better as well.

Going to add my bit here- LOVE this.  I omit the flour, as I like the velvety smooth texture.  I made sure I let everything come to room temperature before starting (bought the ingredients then left them on the counter) I baked it at 300F for 1.5 hours in a tinfoil wrapped spring form pan set in a bath of boiling water.  Then I let it sit for another 2-3 hours.  I had no problems with cracking/bubbling/browning.  We at it later that night, and WOW.  Between three of us, half of it was gone.  Just about to make another.  So good.

Not the best cheesecake I ever had/made. It tasted too heavy of cream cheese and seemed like it lacked one essential ingredient to make it truly good (maybe it lacked lemon juice?). The positive aspect of this recipe is that it was straight-forward and simple.

This recipe flopped for me.  However, it could be that my oven was too hot?  It's old and can be tricky.  Anyway, I was very disappointed in the look of the end result. :(

Ok, I made this recipe only once and even though I probably did something wrong to cause it to have a crack. It was amazing the tast and texture were great, I made my crust a little thicker because I love the crust. But it does help to read that overmixing or cooling too fast can have an effect. I have never made a cheesecake before so I think it tured out pretty dang good I plan on making it over and over again until I get it right, I would reccomend it to anyone. So what if it has a big crack in the middle, its pretty simple to add some topping to cover it up. Cooking is suppose to be fun and a lot of people dont appreciate it anymore and will nit pick about the littlest things. DON'T LISTEN ! THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING AND I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IT FOREVER !!!

Turned out wonderful!! I cooked it in the "hot bath" for one hour and then let it sit in the oven for 6 hours. My only corrective for next time is to insure that the cheesecake pan is wrapped securely with foil. I wrapped it with three layers, but water still got in to the bottom of the cheesecake. I might try a cooking bag under the foil next time. Even with the soft crust, it was delicious, and everyone loved it!!

I've read the previous reviews and it seems that the only people who like this recipe are novices. This was the worst cheesecake I have ever eaten in my life. This did not taste like cheesecake; it was fluffy and spongy. There is no way you could follow the baking directions, and have it cook properly. It was overflowing out of the pan, burnt on the edges, and undercooked in the middle. I thought cooking at that temperature for an hour seemed too long so I cut the cooking time by 10 minutes, and I still burned the outside. Do not waste your time or resources on this recipe!

I have been baking for a long time and I followed the recipe exactly, so I don't understand what the fuss is all about.  The crust didn't hold together at all and the cake was fluffy, I expect cheesecake to be dense.  I've made a lot of cheesecakes and was really looking forward to this one, but we didn't care for it.  Thanks anway.

The first cheesecake I've made - was very pleased with how it turned out. Moist and delicious - however mine had cracks but I didn't mind. Doubled the amount of crust ingredients and it turned out just nice.

This cheesecake was DELISH! I used another crust (with honey graham crackers and macadamia nuts), and I drizzled some caramel on top and worked it into the cheesecake. I wish I had had more time to chill it... I ended up taking it to a party at room temp. It would have been wonderful if it were cooler. But I am happily eating it right now! I followed the exact directions and then used a water bath--the top cracked a little, but because of my caramel design you could barely tell. Wunderbar!

This is the only recipe for cheesecake that I will ever use again. I had so many compliments over it. The only trouble I had with it was that it didn't bake in the middle. I followed the directions to a "T", but it seems that it applies only to top rated ovens. If you have an old oven, I would suggest turning down the temperature and bake longer. I ended up double baking it, and even after all of that, it was the most delicious every cheesecake!

Soooo good!!  I made it for a crowd and it was a HUGE hit.  I'm not that experienced at making cheesecake but I followed the directions exactly and it came out completely smooth on top--absolutely perfect!!  The only issue was that I used a water bath and the water seeped into the crust.  After a day in the fridge the soggy crust firmed up a bit so it wasn't a huge loss but it would have been better without being water logged.  Not sure if I want to attempt it again without a water bath since it came out so beautifully.

Delicious! Recipe is perfect as is. We do like a tad bit sweeter cheese cake so I add 2 cups of sugar rather than 1 1/2 cups.

VERY GOOD AND PRETTY EASY IF YOU DONT MIND WAITING TO LET IT COOL SLOWLY TO PREVENT CRACKS. I PREHEAT OVEN TO 350 PUT CAKE IN WITH PAN OF WATER ON BOTTOM RACK, CAKE ON MIDDLE. TURN OVEN TO 275 AND BAKE FOR 1 HOUR 15 MIN. GIVE OR TAKE. TURN OVEN OFF WHEN DONE (CAKE SHOULD STILL WIGGLE SOME IN MIDDLE)LEAVE CAKE IN WITH OVEN DOOR CLOSED FOR AT LEAST 4 HOURS (BEST TO MAKE AT NIGHT AND LET IT COOL AS YOU SLEEP). PUT IN FRIG. TO CHILL ALL THE WAY THROUGH. THIS PROCESS WILL GIVE YOU A CHEESE CAKE WITH A WHITE TOP WITH OUT A SKIN OR CRACKS LOOKS JUST LIKE IN THE COOKBOOKS!! DONT FORGET TO BUTTER DOWN THE SIDES OF THE SPRIGFORM PAN GOOD TO PREVENT STICKING. HOPE THIS HELPS.

Its a great cheesecake recipe, but not an authentic New York cheesecake. I prefer to use a shortbread crust with all my cheesecakes. Here is the recipe for this crust #  1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour # 1/3 cup white sugar # 1 egg, beaten # 1/2 cup butter, softened Mix all ingredients together and press into a 9" springform pan, bake at 400 degree oven for 15 min, remove and let cool. I also fill a pan with 1-2" of water and place it in the oven when baking the cheesecake, this prevents cracks in the surface

OMG!!!!  The best cheesecake ever!!!  I read through several of the reviews which helped a lot!!   Everyone thought I bought it because it tastes like it came from a restaurant!!!  I made a homemade strawberry topping which I got from allrecipes too. I did make a few adjustments. Added a little sugar to my crust, didn't add as much flour the recipe calls for and I didn't leave it in the oven for 6 hours.  I left it in for 3.  NO cracks at all!!!  Will definitely make again!!!!

It tasted ok, though certainly wasn't my favorite.  After it sat in the fridge for like 10 hours (and that was after I had left it in the oven as recommended in recipe) it tasted too eggy and spongy, not dense and rich.  After it sat for like 24 hours it became much more rich and more like cheesecake texture.  However, it was pretty bland and not very tangy or rich.  And I thought it was too eggy tasting and not rich enough.  I was surprised about my results, I had researched for a long time before selecting this recipe.  The technique itself was good, but the ingredients weren't quite right.  Needs to be tangier, richer, and less eggy IMO.

I've made this cheesecake several times now, and I get rave reviews every time!!  The texture is amazing, the flavour is creamy and perfect!  Easy to make, easy to get addicted to!! My advice is to read the cheesecake tips.  Make sure the cream cheese is at room temp.  Do Not over mix it.  And make it at least a day before you need it.

It was a huge hit! I followed the ingredients exactly and took the suggestions by the reviewers of greasing the sides of the pan and leave it in oven for 3+ hrs to prevent cracking, and it didn't!  I am definitely making the cake again with a topping!

This recipe is simply the best, the only problem is that it was not enough! My daughter even went back for thirds and everyone else had seconds. Great recipe!

I am editing my previous review, which was 4 stars due to me not tasting it yet. :)  I now rate it 5 and cannot believe how well this cheesecake turned out.  I will give 10 percent credit to myself, for paying attention to user recomendations. :D.     Other than that, read what users have to say about this recipe and methodology.  They deserve the majority of praise!!

Amazing recipe, I made mine with fat free cream cheese and a combo of 7 graham crackers and 4 packages of 100 calorie Sandies smashed, and 1/4 cup almonds toasted and finely chopped for the crust. I also took the advice of other members and baked with a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake instead of a water bath. We all loved this cheesecake, My husband raved about it so much that my mother-in-law asked for the recipe and made it for her mother-in-law who also asked for the recipe. I made this for our anniversary and microwaved 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 tsp vegetable oil for 30 seconds, it wont seem melted, just stir. Add to a sandwhich bag, cut the tip and drizzle over the cheesecake.

I made this for my husband's birthday and we both loved it.  I changed to recipe to be healthier, and it was still very very good. I used only (3) 8 oz packages of cream cheese as that was all I had, 2 fat free and 1 reduced fat.  I used egg beaters, splenda, skim milk, whole wheat flour, reduced fat graham crackers for the crust, and the butter substitute brummel and brown (as it has much less calories than real butter).  Mine did crack in one spot, but that was my fault.  I was in a hurry...my cream cheese was not at room temperature, I forgot to grease the pan before pouring, and I couldn't let it rest in the oven as I had other cooking to do.  I made a red raspberry cream sauce for the top to cover the crack and it worked perfectly.

Very good!  Mine cracked, but only because I got impatient and didn't put enough water in the bath.  I'll try to let it sit longer next time!

It was okay. And I mean okay. While the cheescake looked nice, and had a wonderful creamy texture, the flavor was lacking a richness that one expects with cheesecake. Also the crust was far too crumbly and messy.

BEST   CHEESECAKE   EVER!!! I've made this several times now and EVERY time I make it, people tell me it's the best cheesecake they've ever had and ask for the recipe. I followed the fellow reviewers suggestions and am careful not to over beat the mixture and I grease the spring foam pan well so that it separates easily from the sides. It's amazing! Even my mom loved this! She said it was the best and she can be tough to please when it comes to cheesecakes!!

This cheesecake is the BEST and definitely tastes like a restaurant.  I made it for my husband's birthday and he loved it and is still raving about it 3 days later!  Definitely will make again.  It did crack in the middle though, so I am not sure what went wrong, I even greased the sides of the pan and did a pan of water in the oven.  It still tasted great though!

I made two of these one 9" and a 10" the 10" I gave to a cheesecake expert and it was rated a 10 1/2..the 9" I kept for my family and they loved it even with the mistake I made by adding a 1/4 cup more milk but it only came out smoother. My daughter said it was rich and grandson love it and I LOVE IT!!!  and it was my first homemade one. Thank you Ms. C for sharing.

My first time making cheesecake and this turned out ridiculously well.  Shared them with the family and they fell in love, thought it was bought at the store.    What I think helped out the most was leaving the cheesecake in the oven for five or six hours to cool.  Afterwardws I cut it up into little pieces and threw them in the freezer for frozen snacks.  Perfect in every way.  Next time I'm adding a hard chocolate shell to the pieces!

I have been making Cheesecakes for a while, but this recipe is the very best starting point for a New York Style Cheesecake.  Increased the sugar a wee-bit, waterbath, greasing the pan,  6 hours cooling in oven, and then cooled overnight in the refrigerator resulted in a cheesecake as good as any restaurant dessert.

I used reduced fat cream cheese & light sour cream &  the cheesecake was still so rich & so creamy.  I served it with a strawberry sauce.   I, too, used a water bath & there were no cracks in the cheesecake.  It was fabulous!

Wonderful recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  Also, if you use the water bath method and cook for the length of time and the temperature that the recipe calls for, it shouldn't crack.  I have made this recipe several times, and it came out perfect both times.

Wow! I've never made a cheesecake and I was extremely nervous to make one, but this recipe was awesome! I changed the crust a little bit by adding a little sugar and cinnamon, I only used 2 tbsp of flour in the mix (which I suspect added a couple of lumps to my cheesecake), used a water bath and I only left it in the oven for 4 hours to cool. My top browned some, but aesthetics don't really matter when you're just feeding your family. If I didn't know, I would think it was made in a bakery. :)

This recipe is wonderful. I did put the sour cream glaze on top. This is a beautiful cheesecake. I put the pan of water under the cheesecake and it worked perfectly. Thank you for the recipe.

Truly the best cheesecake, the taste the texture are delish....you really want to use the water bath.  After all, this is a $30 cheesecake so you don't want a crack!

This is a full-on 5 star cheesecake in terms of taste. I did have a little trouble, as I have made this twice (I used a wooden spoon for mixing to prevent incorporating too much air). The flour formed large lumps in the batter when I stirred it in so I ommited it on the second try. I still got cracks in my cheesecake both times, so I'm guessing it has something to do with temperature and/or overbaking. Next time I'll try at 325 degrees and probably in a water bath. Despite the fact that mine looked like the Grand Canyon, the taste was SUPERB, and I just know that this will make a beautiful cake once I find a way to steer clear from cracks. :)

Ok, so I followed this recipe to a T...except that I substituted light sour cream for regular.  That's all I had.  I was very excited about this recipe because of the fact it stated that there would be no cracks in the cheesecake. Well, mine did not have any cracks at all....it had the grand canyon on top!!!  I was so disappointed.  There were 2 inch deep cracks in the entire top.  I wasn't sure what I was going to do.  I made a sour cream, vanilla and cool whip topping and it looked perfect.  It also tasted VERY good.  Just a little disappointed about the grand canyon type cracks.  I would try this again, but will use regular sour cream.  Not sure if that was the problem of the cracks. Update...9/21/09.  I tried this yet again and the grand canyon was still on top of my cheesecake. Followed the recipe but substituted an oreo crust.  I have not tried this yet, but the crust smells very burnt.  I am not at all sold on this recipe and think the issue is leaving in the hot oven for so long after it is done baking.  This one just doesn't work for me.  I will try another.

My brother said this was the best cheesecake he's ever had. I used a water bath and then let the cheesecake sit in the oven for several hours before refrigerating to prevent cracking. It was good plain, with no toppings.

I was nervous to make a cheesecake; however, it was GREAT!!!! I had some people over for dinner, and everyone thought it was amazing.   I followed the directions, but I only let it sit in the over for about 2 hours (I had to put it in the fridge because I needed it to cool for dinner). It turned out great, but I recommend, if possible, making this dessert the day before you need it. It is much better after a night in the fridge. The next day when I came back to have a piece, it was even more amazing!  This is the BEST cheesecake EVER!!

Not that this recipe needs anymore reviews haha. This was my first time ever making a cheesecake and it turned out perfect for the recipe. I didn't alter the ingredients at all. I didn't give it a water bath but put a pan of water on the shelf under the cheesecake to keep it moist. My cheesecake didn't crack at all =] As for taste, I have tasted better but this was pretty good. I like mine to be sweeter though, i'm not sure if the New York style is supposed to not be as sweet as cheesecakes i've had in the past. Thanks for the recipe.

This cheesecake is delicious and really is easy to make!!! I have made it once so far but it was a hit at our family gathering and everyone fought over the last piece! I am about to make 2 more today for a birthday (my niece asked me to make it for her birthday, instead of her mother buying a cake).  I followed the recipe to a "T" except that I added 2 tbsp flour instead of the 1/4 cup.  I also turned it into a "turtle cheesecake" by adding chopped pecans, chocolate chips, and drizzled caramel over the top of it after it cooled.  It was superb! I highly recommend this recipe to someone that is looking for a good cheesecake recipe! This one will surely impress!  I have made lots of cheesecakes but this one is definitely the BEST!  I won't be using another recipe! Look at how many ratings this recipe has....over 2300!!!! It is awesome!

Fantastic recipe.  I followed all the recommendations in the reviews, ie All ingredients at room temp, did not over beat the batter, used water bath, baked at 350 for 60 mins and left the cake in oven for 6 hrs. Still had one crack on the surface. Texture and flavor were excellent as good or better than the cheese cake factory. Only problem the top got too browned, aesthetically not as pretty.  Any suggestion out there to prevent the cheese cake from browning too much.
Addendum 5/2016
have made this multiple times now. Flawless every time

I made this cheesecake for my brother's girlfriend's 30th birthday-- she works at a dessert restaurant and she said it was the best she has ever had!! Word to the wise: Research how to make cheesecakes! I spent an hour reading about the science behind it and it surely paid off!! I baked it in a cookie sheet with hot water, and checked it every 15 minutes to make sure the water hadn't evaporated. Also, I used a 9" springform pan-- that MADE the cheesecake!! When it was done baking, I left it in the oven to cool, and after 5 hours of cooling in the oven, I transferred it to the refrigerator for an hour or so. This is such an easy recipe as long as you follow the directions!! My best friend and I are going to make it again this weekend!

This recipe is the best! what can i say, i followed everything to the dot and the cheesecake came out great my boyfriend loved it my mother loved it. I don't know if i did something wrong but comparing this cheesecake to other cheesecakes i ate it's not as sweet as the ones you buy at the restaurant and i had a bit of a cream cheese after taste, there is nothing wrong with that. But I would like to make this a bit more restaurant style - maybe I should add more sugar? But i will definitely make this over and over again until i become a great grandma.. if i live that long haha.

Absolutely wonderful!!! This turned out to perfection. I followed the recipe, except I put the water bath under the rack with the cheesecake (I didn't actually put the cheesecake in the water).

This was my first time making a cheesecake, and it came out absolutely perfect and delicious! I did follow some of the reviewer's suggestions: reduced temp to 325, reduced flour to 2 tbsp., used a water bath and changed the crust for a little more flavor.   I had no problems at all with cracking or under-cooking - it was absolutely beautiful and even better tasting. 5 starts without a doubt!

I tried this cheese cake, YUM. HOWEVER, don't attempt it if your coming off a nap, I did and forgot the flour, It grew so huge in oven I feared it would overflow, not sure if thats normal or because I forgot the flour, the gluten protein thing, even though I made that mistake, leaving it in oven lowered it considerably, did not look gorgeous, but this a.m. I cut into it, put canned cherries on a piece and it was still YUMMEY. My husband agreed and asked me to slice the rest, decorate them with a spoon of cherrie pie filling and he would bring them to the party. So, I say, delish, easy, and don't forget the flour. :)

Yup - I've tried to make cheesecake before and vowed never, ever, ever to do it again.  The reviewer who said "it's you, stupid, not the recipe!"  made me try again and it turned out perfectly!!!  This is my DH's favorite dessert and he was very pleased.  Thanks for the great recipe

OK so there are plenty of reviews to let people know that this cheesecake is good but I feel that I have to add another review.  I have never made cheesecake before but I was asked to bring dessert to our family’s Italian dinner.  Well what better dessert then a cheesecake!!  It was easy to make.  It did crack on me but now that I am reading other reviews I think I overbeat it.  I put blueberries on top of it so you couldn't even see the cracks.  Cracks or not this was a huge hit at the dinner!!!  Everyone loved it.

I made this for the very first time in my life and I am SO proud of myself!  The whole family LOVED it!  I never was a big fan of cheesecake because of that bitter/sour after taste.. until now!  This cheesecake definately does NOT have that aftertaste!  It's absolutely delicious!  I now Love Cheesecake!  I greased the sides of the pan and let it cool down in the oven.  It came out perfect, no cracks at all.

My dad wanted a plain cheesecake for father's day. I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out perfect except a tiny little crack. When my Dad ate this he said "wow this is really good". He doesn't usually compliment food, so im very impressed with this recipe

I made my very first cheesecake, for a family event, using this recipe.  IT WAS A HUGE HIT!!  Everyone raved over it!  I've now been asked to bring this to every family event!  I did change the amount of flour added, to 2 TBSP, which made it creamier.    AWESOME!!

I added some vanilla bean, replaced graham cracker crust with ginger snaps, and WOW! Looks like I'll be bringing this to family dinners for a long time to come. I did get some cracking, but it was probably my fault for peeking! :)

This recipe is amazing.    I do not do the water bath -- I just put a pot of hot water in with the cheesecake, and it works fine.  No cracking; beautiful golden brown top.  Everyone raves about this.

This was sooooooooo tasty!  Took it to a gathering and everyone was in cheesecake heaven.  Mine did not crack.  Took care to not overmix, left it in oven as directed to cool, and placed a separate pan of water in the oven while it baked.  Topped with rasberry sauce (just microwave seedless raspberry jam).  Yum Yum.  Go Chantal!

I've been making this cheesecake for awhile now.  At first I had issues with the cheesecake cracking, but after doing some research, I found that all I had to do was put it in a water bath and...VIOLA, no more cracks!  But now, sometimes a little water leaks through the springform pan, but next time I will probably try lining the pan with foil before putting it in the water bath.  Otherwise, great recipe!  I was never a fan of cheesecake before, but even people who aren't cheesecake lovers would love this.  I love the texture and the taste of it!

Oh my goodness have your taste buds ready for this....AWESOME!!! I cooked mine in a water bath which was the way to go if you do not want any cracks in your cake.  Cover the bottom of your pan with foil and I also used a cooking bag (to make sure no water got in) and then put in a cast iron pan with about 1 1/2 inches of water.  After cooking I left it in oven for about 2 hours then in the frige.  It came out wonderful.  Will be making this again real soon.

I've never been much of a cheesecake person, but this recipe could certainly make me one! Not being big on graham cracker crusts, I made a shortbread crust of 1.5c flour, 1/3c sugar, 1 egg, 1/2c butter, 1 tbsp fresh lemon zest. It was a bit more crust than I wanted for the 9" springform, so I made 6 small cookies for my hubby to munch on while waiting for the cheesecake. :) I made this in the evening, so it only was left in the oven for about 2 hours after it finished and still came out perfect. I agree completely with previous posts to not touch the oven door once it's in the oven.. and definitely use a water bath. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

AWESOME!  I made this last night & it was FABULOUS!  I don't know if my springform pan was smaller than 9" or what, but I had too much batter & ended up putting it in an extra dish & baking.  My top also cracked, not sure what's up with that.  But the taste is great!

This was so easy to make and awesome.  I did change the crust by adding pecans and cinnamon as others suggested and I did bake it in a water bath. My friends husband claimed it was the best cheesecake he has ever had and asked me to Marry him!

I have made this twice and it received rave reviews.  I used Ruby Red Strawberry Sauce from all recipes which was perfect.  I did not have cracks with a pan of water under the cheesecake and baking at 325 for an hour.  This was much easier than wrapping a pan.  I think room temp ingredients make a difference in the process.  I used 2 TBSP of cornstarch rather than flour.  I am fascinated reading the reviews for this recipe.

This is a really great cheesecake recipe. It was the first time I ever made cheesecake and it came out fabulous. I made it for mothers day and it was a huge hit with my family who are from NY and definitely know their cheesecakes. 5 stars!

I just made this cheescake, it was absolutely perfect! I put a roaster pan of hot water on the oven shelf below the cheesecake. This makes more sense than trying to wrap foil around the pan and placing it in a water bath. Why take the chance of the water leaking into the cheescake? I made this exactly to the directions, making sure all ingredients were at room temperature. AND NOT OVER MIXING!! I sprayed my springform pan with non-stick oil.  I baked it late in the evening and let it set overnight in the oven (without opening the door!!) The result was a "PERFECT CHEESECAKE", no cracking in the cake, it was well set and had a very creamy texture! Added a can of cherry pie filling on the top.  I will definitely make this again! This recipe is foolproof if the directions are carefully followed! Everyone that tried it gave it a great review! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The recipe produced a very good cake.  It was my first cheesecake.  It cracked but thats because I everything was cold when I blended it.  I also probably overbeat it.  I am going to try again following some of the advice from others.

I've never made cheesecake before so I was very nervous. It seems easy to mess up. OVERALL this turned out great! The taste and texture was delicious. I think the middle didn't get baked as much as the outside because it was much creamier. Since I'm at sea level I wonder if I should have cooked it a bit longer than recommended. I also was terrified of overbeating the cream cheese but mine probably could have been beat a bit longer, there were a few lumps. Per lots of advice and articles I got a glass bottomed springform pan and some heavy duty aluminum foil, and made a water bath with my roasting pan. I used light sour cream and cake flour. My topping was a modified cherry pie filling. Overall this was terrific, thanks for such a nice recipe!

I have tried to make cheesecake for several years & failed many times because I was over beating them. I am master baker but had not reserchased baking cheesecake. I found this recipe to be the best cheesecake I have ever tasted even without any topping. I had everything at room temp. I mixed the cream cheese sugar, flour & vanilla with a hand mixer then added all other indgs. one at a time mixing by hand. I used heavy cream & only 2 Tbsp. flour as suggested by Laurelc43 in  the reviews.  She said to bake it 3 hrs. & 40 min. at 225 degreese F. it was perfect. The 1st time I put foil around it & it leaked so the 2nd time I used a baking bag with great success. I would give this 10 stars.

I made this cheesecake for Easter and I followed the instructions by timing the oven at 325 degrees and I left it in the over overnight. The cheesecake was perfect!!! I did have a little bit of cracking on the top but that was completely my fault as not all of the ingredients were at room temp but I could wait any longer and had to make the cheesecake then. To hid this I cover the top with cherry filling and it was a hit!!! Will definitely make again and it will be my 'go to' recipe every time I make a cheesecake! ---------------------------------------------------- I just wanted to update this review as I made this recipe again last night for my father-in-law's birthday! Ok again this is AMAZING!!! I cooked it on 325 for 1 hour and 20mins...I also substituted the milk for heavy whipping cream in the mixture and added cinnamon  (1/2 tsp) and sugar (1/4cup) to the graham cracker bottom. This is the best cheesecake ever!

This cheesecake is awesome! I've been making it for a few years now. I am constantly asked to make it for family functions, and actually have to make it today for a function tomorrow.   I follow the directions exactly. My cheesecake always cracks in the center, but it doesn't matter to me because I always top it with cherry pie filling. I will try some of the tips other people have suggested, though, such as not overbeating it and greasing the sides of the springform pan.

I made this cheesecake over the weekend and it came out excellent! I made it a marbled cheesecake by taking almost 2 cups of the batter and adding 6 semisweet baking choclate melted and dropped throughout the batter.  It was very easy to make and very, very, delicious!

I believe this is one of the best cheesecake recipes Ive ever made. I followed the directions to a "T". I also read the reviews for important tips to ensure a perfect cheesecake. I did the waterbath, and covered my springform pan in the aluminum foil to ensure no leakage in the water bath. I have made this twice now, and both were perfect. Thank you for sharing!!!!

Oh my god!  I never would have thought that I could make a cheesecake, much less one that came out PERFECT and tasted like HEAVEN.  I followed other reviewers advice and baked it in a bain marie (water bath) with the pan wrapped in a roasting bag.  I have made this three times now. This last time I made it, I forgot to grease the pan and realized it as I was pouring the filling over the crust!  Daaang!  I freaked and ran to Google "I forgot to grease my cheesacake pan".  After reading several accounts, I realized I was not in big trouble after all.  Well, I baked the cheesecake and when it was finished I ran a knife around the inside of the pan as suggested.  The only thing this accomplished was to tear up the crust a bit.  I was nervous as this cheesecake was meant to be dessert that night.  We were entertaining some fairly new friends and I wanted to make a good impression.  They arrived that night bearing sweets, so I knew that if the cheesecake was a disaster at least we would still have dessert.  The time came to bust out the cheesecake and I gave my disclaimer about forgetting to grease.  We cut into the cake and served it around.  It was perfect again.  Save for the bit of roughed up crust we were in business! Thanks chibi chef!  You and this wonderful cheesecake ROCK!

Excellent cake, smooth and creamy.  The best I have had..only complaint was the crust, it was a bit bland it could use a little more sugar and nuts.  I am going to try adding sugar and more butter.  BUT you can't go wrong with this recipe.

Perfectly fabulous, creamy, smooth and beautiful!  Even after my stupid water bath leaked through the foil into my pan and made my crust all mushy, it was awesome! I topped it with a shiny chocolate ganache and sliced strawberries. I can't wait to make it again and taste it with an un-mushy crust.

So great!  I followed a lot of the reviewers suggestions.  -Only used the electric mixer for creaming the cheese and sugar.  Hand stirred everything after that. -Baked it at 325 degrees. -Used a water bath.  The crust did get a litte soggy after the first day, so next I make it I will try one of the other crust recipes posted in the reviews.

For the holidays I always bake a cheesecake. This is the first time ( probably 20 attempts) I ever made a perfect cheesecake with no cracks or dips in the middle. It was truely a work of art and the taste was fantastic. I used the recipe as written and the techniques discussed in other reviews. I preheated the oven for 1 hour, placed a pan of hot water on the shelf below 30 minutes before I baked the cheesecake. I only used the beater for the cream cheese and sugar and used a wooden spoon to blend in the remaining ingredients by hand. I sprayed the entire pan with Pam. I baked the cake 1 hr and never opened the oven door until 5 1/2 hours after the cake was baked. The result was perfect. I had to take a picture. Thanks to everyone for your tips. It is a good feeling to finally have success.

This cheesecake was incredibly delicious!  I just always have problems with the top cracking.  I have no idea how to fix it, but it ticks me off!!!!  This cheesecake still tasted amazing...but mine just didn't look as nice.  :)

When reading this recipe, I saw that you needed a "springform" pan, and that it needed to cook in a "water bath". I wasn't going to try this recipe, simply because I didn't have either. I really wanted to try it, though because of all the great reviews. So, I compromised and used a regular round cake pan, heavily greased it, and put it in a rectangular cake pan about 2'' tall. I put this in the oven, and then filled the rectangular pan with about 3/4'' of HOT water. I baked it at 350 for about an hour, turned off the oven, and left it inside to cool slowly (about 3-4 hours). The top didn't crack, and the sides didn't stick. So, if you don't have a spring form pan or are intimidated about the word "water bath", please use this method because this is THE BEST cheesecake!!! And it was my first time making one!! Thank you !

This Cheesecake came out AMAZING! I PROMISE!!! I followed the recipe exactly. **except i just made my own recipe for the crust*** Just broke up about two leaves of Graham Cracker and melted butter...added more cinnamin and nutmeg then baked crust for amount 10 min before putting in the filling! I baked for exactly one hour then turned over off! It was perfect! I made this for my hubbys 25th Bday! He loves Heath so around the sides I spread Caramel and put Toffee chips all along the outside and a little on the rim. Then caramel topping on the top! It was easy and everyone couldnt believe it wasnt store bought! His little brother wants me to make it for his bday! Excellent Recipe will def make again!

My first cheesecake was a hit!  I have been a baker for years, but feared the cheesecake.  This recipe is so easy and delicious!  Fantastic!  But don't overmix or you could still get cracks!

My family said this cheesecake was the best ever! It all got eaten in just one night. I only changed a few things. I cut the recipe in 1/2 baked it in a 8x8 square glass dish.  I love shortbread crusts, so instead of a graham crust, I used a shortbread crust ("Shortbread Crust" from allrecipes.) I also added a little more sugar to the recipe. When you half this recipe, it calls for 3/4 cup of sugar. I did just slightly under a full cup (pretty much a level full cup). You dont have to do this, but I like my cheesecakes more sweet. And to me it was absolutely perfect this way!!!!!!! Loved every modification I made. Loved the way I did it! But this is definitely the best cheesecake recipe I have ever tried!

Nothing more can be said bout this great cheesecake! But for those thinking of making this 'healthier', I used Low-Fat greek style yogurt instead of sour cream and you won't be able to tell the difference. Also, I baked it at 225degF for 3.5 hrs as the other reviewer suggested, grease the sides of the pan well and a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven. No cracks. Also, if there are tiny air bubbles in the mixture when pouring into the cakepan, you might wanna poke it or it will create little holes on the final product.

Excellent recipe!  I added chopped up Snickers before baking.  Then after it had been refrigerated, I drizzled caramel and hot fudge over each slice before serving.  Very delicious.

This cheesecake looks like you bought it at the Cheesecake Factory!  Everyone oohs and aaahs over it like you brought some expensive desert.  ( figured it cost about $7 to make..with cherry topping )...the only thing is that mine did crack like an earthquake..but the topping covered it up!

To be honest, with all the modifications I did to this recipe it was hardly the recipe at all, but the measurements of the ingredients were the same, except that I halved the flour.  I was skeptical at first, especially since I've have had bad luck with allrecipes in the past.  I took the advice of LAURELC43 and reduced the flour and changed the cooking time to 3 hours and 40 minutes at 225 degrees.  This worked beautifully, the cheesecake barely had any color on top and had none on the sides.  I still don't know how people get it with no browning at all like the picture shows.  I basically used Alton Brown's method of doing cheesecake.  Sour cream first, then cream cheese and sugar.  I did let the cream cheese warm, but I don't think it was enough since it had a few lumps.  Then I blended all the liquid ingredients and added them in a thin stream.  I had no idea when to add the flour so I added it in the beginning. I'm going to omit it or use cornstarch next time.  I used a springform pan and water bath of course.  I recommend wrapping the pan in aluminum foil and putting parchment paper underneath the crust.  It wasn't perfect, I did end up with some small bubbles on the top of the cake, but it was great nonetheless.  The sides also didn't come away perfectly, perhaps I should have sprayed them a little more than I did(I used the canola/flour spray).  I may try smearing it with a shortening flour mixture which I've had very good success with when using cakes cakes. I'm goin

I followed the recipe exactly.  The graham cracker crust was way too thick and not sweet enough to compliment the cheesecake, so next time I'll reduce the number of crackers or possibly replace them with another cookie.  Otherwise, this was a hit and I will definitely be making it again.

I trusted the most popular reviewer, the one who said that the recipe is perfect and if it didn't turn out, it's my fault. Well I followed the recipe to a T. Let the ingredients come to room temp. Didn't open the oven door. Even made sure the oven's temp was really 350. I did not over beat anything. The cheesecake came out gritty, over-browned, and with a large crack. If a water bath is necessary, then the recipe should say so. Maybe this recipe is perfect after you make tons of changes, but again, I made it as stated. IF I make this again, I will make it with a water bath. I know it was over cooked, but it's my fault for trusting the review, and the recipe.

OK ..This was my first cheesecake attempt, and based on previous reviews-this one seemed like the perfect one for my trial run. I decided to not go with some of the suggestions (mostly because I begin to get confused.) I followed the recipe to a T, and it turned out WONDERFUL. It did have a slight crack  on one side, but honestly-I didn't care. It looked great. I served it to my husband and a few friends, and everyone was amazed that it was my first cheesecake. This is Cheesecake Factory good. This dessert will become a go-to in my recipe book for impressive and delicious desserts. You will not have any regrets if choosing to try this recipe. YUMMY!

This was very good but not quite as creamy as I would have liked I will make again but think I will try to reduce the flour to 2 tablespoons. The flavor was incredible.

So good! Two suggestions (both common sense):  1) Let all your ingredients warm up to room temp before mixing. It makes them blend much easier/require less mixing and thus not as tough.  2) Don't be an idiot like me and dump the vanilla extract on dry ingredients (like flour). I did this (stupidly) and I had brown clumps of flour throughout my cheesecake. Still fantastic

EXCELLENT!!!!  I followed the directions almost to the letter. Rather than using a hand mixer (wasn't sure if I was supposed to!), I mixed everything by hand. It appeared a bit lumpy, so I then  poured the mixture into the cake pan through a sieve. I also used a 10" pan, as I don't have a 9" pan. I did use a water bath, and only left it in the oven for 2-1/2 hrs after it had cooked for an hour.   The end result was a wonderful cheesecake without cracks, that all have enjoyed either just plain, or with various toppings.

Perfect.  This is my first attempt at baking a "real" cheesecake.  I used light cream cheese and light sour cream, and my pan was a 10" instead of 9".  I kept the baking time the same, and left the cheesecake in the oven for only 1 hour before taking it out after baking.

So, I didn't have a spring form pan, and I didn't really want to go out and buy one for this dish.  Instead I used a round ceramic quiche dish that I had (although I'm sure a round cake pan would do just as well) and I lined it with tin foil.  I sprayed the tin foil with non-stick cooking spray so that the cheesecake wouldn't stick to it.  I was worried about the crust not having enough butter and thought it might not hold together, so I added another Tablespoon of butter.  I realize now that I probably didn't need to, it would have done fine, but it turned out to be just as good with the extra butter.  I ended up doing a water bath as well, and IT DIDN'T CRACK!!!  After baking, I cooled it in the oven, and then overnight in the refrigerator.  When it was completely cool, I was able to pull the tinfoil right out without a problem!  Who needs a spring form pan anyway?  It was THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER.  Do yourself a favor and don't try it, your hips will never look the same!

This was, by far, the best cheesecake I have ever made.  I'm no chef, but my friends who are frequent chefs raved about it!   I followed the advices given here and made a different crust with cracker crumbs, sugar, butter and cinnamon.  I also substitued Bailey's Irish Cream for the milk and cut back on the flour.  My cake cracked, but that was my fault as I didn't have the cream cheese at room temp and probably over-mixed it.  But the crack was just a cosmetic flaw - didn't affect the taste at all!

This is a brilliant recipe. I'm an amatuer baker and this was my first cheesecake. Followed the advice of other reviewers; used a water bath, mixed by hand after creaming the cheese and sugar and omitted the flour for a smoother, denser texture. Cake turned out crack/blemish free and absolutely divine! Thanks Chantal for the recipe and everyone else for the tips :)

Next time:  (1) add about 2 tbs more of butter to crust b/c it was kind of dry for my liking, (2) don't let the vanilla and flour mix b/c the clumps are tough to get out, (3) make sure all ingredients are room temp.  All in all, my tasted good, but it was kind of clumpy.  Oh yeah, it split one time in the center.  I didn't think that I over mixed, but this was my first go at cheesecake.

Amazing recipe! I LOVE cheesecake, and bake it at least once a month for some occasion. I use this recipe, adding berries or something depending on the occasion. I would increase the amount of crust, and I used splenda/light cream cheese for a lighter recipe, but my family didn't even notice, it was great. Thank you so much :)

Well, I was disappointed in this recipe.  It taste like other cheesecakes I've made and considering it had so many 5 star rating, I expected something really outstanding.  Mine did crack and followed a lot of the advice listed.  It was however, the smallest crack I've ever had in a cheesecake.  Perhaps my cheese was not warm enough.  However, since I was not wowed by the taste,  I will not try this one again.

This cheesecake was outstanding! I'm only posting a comment, because my husband requested an oreo cheesecake for his birthday. So I used an oreo base (instead of graham crackers) folded in a few crushed oreos in the mix and on top. Fantastic!

I am rating this a 5 because my cheesecake tasted like a baby watson new york cheesecake...my mom is a born and raised NYCer and I think she almost teared up at the memories of this cheesecake! However I halved the recipe and combined it with White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake. I also cooked it according to this method + a water bath. Here is what I did for those that want it: •	2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese  •	2 eggs  •	1/4 cup sour cream  •	2 tablespoons all-purpose flour  •	1 cup white chocolate chips  •	1/4 cup half-and-half cream  •	1/4 cup white sugar

The taste of this cheesecake is excellent. Mine did not seem to be quite done in the middle, but that might have been because I used an 8.5" pan and still baked for only 60min. Next time I will increase cook time a little. Did the water bath and left it in the oven for 4hrs- no cracks! For my first cheesecake I was really happy and my boyfriend loved it for V-day.

Delicious.  I prepared it mostly as the recipe detailed and it turned out perfectly firm and delicious.  I made a bit of a topping with some blueberries, lemon juice, corn syrup, and powdered sugar.  It went perfect with the not-too-sweet flavour of the cheesecake.  No wonder why after 2000 reviews this recipe has 5 stars!

Awesome recipe. I followed some advice from other reviewers and I baked in a water bath and allowed to set in oven for about 4 hours before transferring to the fridge. Definitely plan on leaving it overnight it changes the entire experience of the cheesecake. Overall a great recipe that I will be using for a long time!!

I found this receipe from this website some time ago, and I have never looked for another recipe since.  It is perfect, and it is DELICIOUS!  Follow the steps EXACTLY.  I have never had a single cheesecake, when following this recipe at least, come out with a single crack.  They are always perfect. My family is constantly requesting that I make it for family gatherings.  I love to mix up my own raspberry topping for it.  No recipe to follow, I just cook raspberries with a little bit of sugar and water in a saucepan, and let the raspberries break down.  I add honey and more sugar to taste.  Let the raspberry mixture cool, then strain to remove the seeds.   YUM!

This recipe was just so so. Not as creamy as the raves stated. I'm a long time cheesecake maker and have never had a problem like this one. It ended up with a huge x crater in the center after using a water bath, being gentle with the mixing etc.Sorry to say I've tasted much better.

WOW. I don't even like cheesecake, and I loved this.  My boyfriend was in awe of how much better a good, homemade cheesecake is than store-bought.  I used the recipe for "Hot Fudge Sauce" from this site as a topping and it was fabulous.

This is a wonderful yummy recipe!  I only changed a few things, I used buttermilk instead of milk (since that's all I had on hand), I cut down on the flour and I used 5 tbsp of butter for the crust.  My cheesecake did have crack, but I know I overbeat the eggs.  The taste was wonderful and when I brought it to work, no one believed I made it, they thought I got it from a bakery.

I usually make the New York Cheesecake III recipe (which I pull off without a problem whatsoever), but was requested to try one with a graham crust. I used all organic ingredients- for whatever reason, organic cream cheese is extremely difficult to cream (yes even at room temp). I had to mix the milk in with it in the sugar to get it workable. After I blended everything, I dropped the bowl as much as I could to get out air bubbles. Despite baking exactly one hour, the cheesecake browned a lot (probably too much) on the edges. It rose up like a mushroom cloud but now that it has settled, it has a San Andrea faultline sized cracked straight down the middle. Ugh! Everything was room temp and I tried not to overmix any of it. Maybe after it settles more the crack will heal itself (doubtful). I hope it tastes better than it looks. And crushing the graham crackers is a huge pain and extremely messy. Just toss it in a blender and save yourself the trouble. (I used cinnamon, and added extra butter/cinnamon/nutmeg as suggested, left out the extra sugar) I'll stick to the other cheesecake recipe from now on.

I just made this cheesecake for a work potluck, and it was fab! I got so many compliments on how moist and creamy it was, and several people said it was the best they ever had. I have to admit I was very nervous about making it, as this was my very first cheesecake attempt-but just be sure to follow the directions and make sure to use a water bath!

This cheesecake comes out perfect every time i cook it.  Its almost fail proof, I don't know how anyone could mess this up.  The trick is getting all your ingredients to room temperature BEFORE combining them, and when your finished baking, just turn the oven off and walk away.  DO NOT take the cheesecake out of the oven, just let everything cool down by itself.  I usually make this the night before and leave it in the oven to cool all night.  I'm considered the queen of cheesecake at work now, and they are a tough crowd (frequent Cheesecake Factory diners)

Everyone LOVED this!! Made with exact ingredients, but I did the waterbath separately with the pan of water on second shelf.  I did have two very tiny cracks, but they made NO difference, it was still veryyy creamy and wonderful!! I was concerned that it may taste "eggy" as was reported in the lower ratings for this recipe, but that wasnt an issue at all, not even a hint of egg taste.  I was also concerned that I didnt bake it long enough since it was a little wobbly still when I took it out of the oven, but after letting it cool, then spending the night in the fridge, it set up perfectly!!!  Would definately make this again!!

This was my first cheesecake. I made it as one of the two cheesecakes I made for Christmas 2008. It cracked and I over cooked it so the crust was a little burned because I didn't hear the timer but guess what..... NO ONE COMPLAINED. They ate it up and loved it! Now once I cook it and pay attention to the timer I'm sure it will still be the best basic recipe for a cheesecake! Thanks a lot!

I had this recipe in my box for a long time before actually using it.  WOW!  I made this for one of my husband's employees' birthday and what a hit!! In fact, another employee asked for it for his birthday which was just 5 days later!  Mine had a huge crack because I forgot the water bath, so I just covered the top with fresh whipping cream and swirled sweetened strawberry puree into the cream.  Looked beautiful.  The second one I made I used a water bath and it came out perfect.  It's such a big cheesecake you expect it to be a little "dry" but it was so creamy and light!  Excellent recipe.

Mine cracked like it'd been hit by an earthquake, but it was soooo yummy. Only changes I made were to use light sour cream and 1/3 fat cream cheese. Next time I will use a bit less sugar too.

Best cheese cake I ever made!  Everyone loved it.  I did use a water bath and that helped it from cracking.  I also doubled the crust recipe.  Easy to make and won rave reviews.

Simply wonderful recipe!!! This was going to be my fist attempt at a cheesecake so I did a trial run as I wanted to make sure I was sucessful for Christmas. First time was amazing no cracks with using a water bath and following other instructions completely. For Christams I used a full sleeve of graham crackers a couple of Tbs of sugar and 4Tbs butter. I made a caramel sauce and poured 2/3 over the crust. Sprinkle about a cup of chopped pecans over the caramel. POured all but  1 1/2 cups of batter into pan.I melted about 1/2 chocolate chips and combined 2/3 in the reserved batter. Swirled into pan. Using heavy duty foil you could tear a sheet that turned sideways so I didn't have an edge in the water to stop any leaks. I did double the foil for a thicker covering. After pulling it out of the oven at the recommended time. I used the reserved (reheated) caramel and chocolate chips to drizzle over the top with a few pecans. Just georgous!!! Thanks a gain for the perfect cheesecake recipe.

This was my first time making a cheesscake and WOW!! This recipe was awesome! I received so many compliments on this cheesecake that people were stunned this was my first effort. I did follow some of the suggestions in the previous comments and added in 1/4 cup ground pecans and cinnamon into the graham cracker crust. I used only a springform pan and not a water bath to cook the cheesecake and this wroked out fine. I did cook the cheesecake at 350 degrees for an hour and then let the cheesecake sit in my oven for 5 hours before I put the cake into my fridge overnight. I will definitely be making this recipe again!!

I have been searching for a cheesecake similar to one offered at Buca Di Beppo.  This recipe is even BETTER!  I made one cheesecake for Christmas Eve -- I was making a second one on Christmas Day!   My husband thinks this is the best cheesecake he has ever eaten (big O)!

This is an excellent recipe! I have a few tips for no-fail results:(1)Butter the sides of a 10-inch pan.(This allows the cake to easily pull away from the pan as it cools, eliminating cracks.)Change the crust ingredients to 2 C. cinnamon graham cracker crumbs, ½ C. melted butter, 2 Tbsp. sugar, and ½ C. chopped pecans; press into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes in a 350-degree oven. Let cool. Wrap the outside of the pan in 6 sheets of heavy aluminum foil.(This keeps the edges creamy and the bottom from overcooking.)(2)Use 1 ½ times the amount of ingredients listed when making the filling. This fills a 10-inch pan perfectly. Also, change the flour amount to 2 heaping Tbsp., and substitute cream for milk. Allow the ingredients to reach room temperature before mixing. Beat the cream cheese alone first, until it’s smooth and creamy, before adding any other ingredients.(3)Place a broiling pan half full of boiling water onto the lowest rack in the oven.(The moisture produced from the water while baking also helps prevent cracks.) Move the top rack to the middle, and bake the cheesecake on the middle rack.(4)Follow Javaflops’ advice on baking. They produce a PERFECT, BEAUTIFUL cheesecake. Her instructions are: “…bake it at 325 for 15 minutes and then at 250 for 15 minutes and then at 225 for 15 and then 200 for 2 hours and 50 minutes and finally 250 for 10 minutes.” Then turn the oven off, prop the door open with a wooden spoon, and let it set overnight.  Don’t touch i

I am definitely not a cooker/baker but I decided to make a cheesecake for chrismas and wanted a simple recipe. This recipe was simple and easy to make. I followed the directions just as they are listed and my cheesecake turned out scrumptous. The only kinda bad thing was that i left it in the oven for 6 hours with the oven turned off and it still cracked. But who cares about a cracked cheesecake! I almost didn't get a slice myself. Everyone loved it. I'm sure it will be my specialty dish for the holidays to come.

Ok, this was my first attempt EVER at cheesecake.  It was quite easy, mine did crack, I baked as directed and left it in the oven for 5 hours, it cracked before then, so I didn't think it was necessary to wait any longer, the damage was done.  It was my turn to bring dessert to family holidays, so I topped this cake with cherry pie filling, everyone loved it, and no one saw the crack :).  It was quite tasty, next time I think I'll add the "bain marie" as one reviewer suggested, also I didn't mix anything by hand as another suggested because the recipe said "do it just the way it reads" and I didn't want to risk it. If the "bain marie" doesn't help next time, I'll go with the "by hand" suggestion.  Regardless, the cake was a huge success.  Even my niece, the "cheesecake" specialist enjoyed it.

I made this for a Christmas Church gathering and it was a big hit.  The only changes I made was my crust was 1 cup crushed graham crackers, 2 T. sugar and 1/4 cup melted butter, pressed onto the bottom and up the sides sligtly of the pan.  I did cook it in a water bath like others said.  Once cooled I topped it with a chocolate sauce.  To make do the following; in a microwave safe measuring cup put 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and pour heavy cream over chips to almost the top of them.  Microwave for 45 seconds.  Stir mixture until all chips are melted and sauce thickends up.  Pour over top of cheesecake and refrigerate.

This is cheesecake always gets rave reviews. I think it is better the day after. Sometimes I change out the crusts. A favorite is using a whole box of Lorna Doone Shortbread cookies with a sprinkling of Cinnamon mixed in or using oreo cookies. Make into crumbs using my food processor and then combine 3 TBSP of Butter in.  To avoid a cracking cheesecake it has to be moist enough to prevent this in the oven. So, even with turning off the oven and letting it sit for hours mine cracked every time.  Nothing I did wrong. So if this is happening to you like it did me, countless times. Use a water bath. It works and is easier than you think. Buy wider foil to wrap pan in. Pressing the foil slightly over the edge of the pan to seal it.I do a double layer of it. Boil water on stove. Put cheesecake with foil in the pan. I use a roaster pan. Pour the boiling water around the cheesecake about and an inch or more. Bake cheesecake for an hour. Shut the oven off and leave cheesecake in for about 6 hours. Take out an put in fridge. Turns out beautiful every time.

This is the first time I've made a cheesecake.  It was for a friend's birthday.  He just raved about it.  It came out beautifully.  I topped it with a blueberry compote.  It was so pretty I wish I had taken a picture of it.  The only problem that I had was it cracked in the center but thankfully did not sink.  I hid the crack with the compote.  Also, I did not have a 9in pan so I had to use my 9.5in pan.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I DID IT!  I DID IT!  I DID IT!  Of course with Chantal's help and a water bath as recommended!  It turned out awesome!  No cracks, evenly browned and CRAZEE delicious.  I made it for Thanksgiving with my husband in mind.  He always talks about the gourmet cheesecakes they used to have at the Lazarus department store in Columbus, Ohio.  He said this one was pretty darn close! Thanks again to Chantal and Allrecipes.

This cheesecake was good. I think it needed something else for flavor. Although I followed the directions exactly, it still cracked in three places. I don't know if that was due to baking in an electric oven (I've always had a gas oven until now) or overmixing.

I made Cheesecake for the first time and I used this recipe. It turned out perfect and was a huge hit on Thanksgiving. :) I followed the recipe exactly as written and also applied everyone's recommended tips (water bath). No cracks or nothing. I didn't have time to wait for the cream cheese to become room temperature so the batter had some lumps but after it baked you couldn't even notice. For Christmas I am going to make a raspberry chocolate variation. We'll see how it turns out!

My husband loved this as well as our guests! I did crack on top and I followed the recipe as instructed, but I think I probably overbeat it don't know. It didn't really matter, I heated up some jelly and mixed it with the strawberries, blueberries, raspberries etc and it was great! Will make again

Wonderful cheesecake and super easy to make!  I did use cinnamon graham crackers and a few pecans in the crust, but besides that I followed the recipe.

I used all the "tricks"- put my water bath in the oven while it was preheating, greased the bottom and sides of the pan, didn't over-mix the batter (I even whisked all the eggs together in a separate bowl before adding), and baked it exactly one hour, then turned off the oven and left it competely alone, no peeking, for 5 hours.  BUT, I put the bottom of my springform pan in upside down, and the waterbath leaked into my crust.  This recipe STILL turned out WONDERFUL despite user error!  It was unbelievably good- and it looked perfect.  No cracks, no pulling away at the sides, and smooth and silky all the way through.  Except for a soggy crust.  Next time, though, it will be perfect!

This is always a hit at social events. For people who are concerned with the cracking-- just add a nice berry topping and no one will really notice. Who has time to wait for the cheesecake to cool 6 hours or the energy to set up a bain de Marie?

People beg me to make this recipe. I get compliments EVERY TIME. This is such an easy recipe-and so delicious! It has become my signature dish. It tastes so good all by itself, I've stopped serving it with chocolate or strawberries because everyone devours it without them. I've been told I should sell them for the holidays.

this cheesecake turned out perfectly. I took some other reviewer suggestions, making the crust with sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and a little more butter. Nothing but rave reviews...thanks for the great recipe :)

This made me really nervous to make. So many people were saying different things and then others were saying "just follow the recipe" and that is what I did. I did however cook it in a water bath and I think that helped, but overall....beautiful product. My family members are begging me to make this for them. Thanks...and ps-I didn't have any cracking at the top. Woohoo!

I made this cheesecake for a birthday party today and it was a huge hit! I mixed the flour with the sour cream before adding to the cream cheese mixture and that avoided the issue with the flour that some other reviewers had. Because I was short on time I cooked the cheesecake for an hour at 350, turned the oven off and left it in the oven for an hour with the door closed, left it in the oven for 1/2 hour with the door propped slightly open, then put it in the fridge for 3 hours and it was perfect. It didn't crack and it was well set. I've never made a cheesecake before and this was so easy! This is a new family favorite. Thank you.

After trying many cheesecake recipes, this is my favorite. I just made 12 of them for a wedding. I also changed it up to make it a Gluten-Free version, I used Rice Flour instead of white, and crushed Pecans instead of Graham Cracker. This is the best recipe ever.

Mine cracked but it was my first time making a cheesecake. Also I got little chuncks of flour so be sure to mix or sift the flour when you add it. I'll keep working on it, otherwise it was delicious.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  Did the whole hot water bath thing.  The cheesecake cracked all over and completely fell apart when I took the ring off the springform pan. Don't know what happened.  I am hesitant to try it again.

Ok, I am a total newb cook. This is the second time I have baked anything in my 41 years of life (besides frozen pizza) and it turned out AWESOME, (the cheesecake, not the pizza). To the one who said it did not turn out; try it out again because you screwed it up somehow.  I did the water bath thing with a pan of water on the shelf below the cheesecake and it turned out flawless. I was VERY careful not to over mix the stuff so I did all of the mixing but the milk by hand (sore forearms). If I can do this anyone can. Seriously, if it does not turn out for you, look for what you missed or messed up because all I did was carefully follow the directions. Go figure.

I've never cared for cheesecake until I made this for my boyfriend's birthday.  It's delicious!  I followed other reviewer's suggestions for the crust (1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar) and lowered the flower to 2 tbl spoons.  Also put a pan of boiling water on the bottom rack and lowered baking temp to 325.  The cake turned out beautifully, no cracks, rich smooth texture.  I made another cheesecake the next week using 1/3 less fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream (did everything else the same) and still got rave reviews.

I have a small deli-style bistro, and had always bought from my suppliers their pre-made cheesecake, because I was afraid of not being able to make one as good.  I gave this one a try made it just as the recipe read, with the exception of wrapping the pan in foil and adding a small amount of water to cookie sheet, and now I can't keep enough of these made.  This is absolutely the best.  Thanks  
PS  I usually make this late in the evening, so that right before bed I turn the oven off and leave it untouched till early morning and it has never cracked.
Thanks for the recipe!

Stop searching for the perfect cheesecake recipe cause this is it!! It's simple and absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  We drive from toronto to the cheesecake factory in buffalo and I can honestly say this is just as good!!! Make it as it is - no need to change anything!
OH! except make sure you put a pot of water on the bottom rack of the oven under the cake -this prevents any cracking.

The first time I made this, my husband said he'd take this over The Cheesecake Factory any day.  This is my only cheesecake recipe now!  Assuming you do everything correctly, it turns out PERFECT.  It's an awesome base recipe for adding extras to as well.

OK, so I was skeptical about this recipe, but tried it anyway.  I have a degree in culinary arts and I felt the cook time didn't make sense but I thought I’d try it anyway.  Sadly I was right.  This cracked - or should I say - cratered in the middle in three directions after the first 45 minutes in the oven. I left it in with the heat off and it was done in about another 90 minutes.  If I'd left it in the entire time it would have been ruined.

Next time, I'll use the basis of the recipe, but will turn down the oven after 30 mins and bake it with the oven on and water in the oven to create moisture.  The base flavor of the recipe was good that's why I gave it 2 stars....I had to camouflage the top with strawberries to serve it though - very disappointing.

WOW, this was AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't have a springform pan so I used a 9-inch cake pan. There was a little extra filling so I made a mini cheesecake in a custard can. I did use a water bath and cooked for about 15 extra minutes--at one hour the center was still very jiggly. Then I broke some major rules...I didn't cool it in the oven, but ran a knife around the edge and then threw it in the fridge overnight covered in foil. There was no cracking whatsoever and it had the perfect fluffy, creamy consistency the next day. YUM!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great. The texture is wonderful and the taste is to die for. This wasn't as complicated as I'd been led to believe about cheesecake. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I bake all the time, and I have lots of experience making cheesecakes.  That said, this recipe is just ok.  First of all, the crust needs a lot of work, it is bland and there is way too much of it.  Secondly, the cake itself is creamy, but the texture is a bit firm (maybe too much flour).  I still liked it, as did my boyfriend, but it is not the perfect recipe that so many other reviewers have said it is.

This was my first time making cheesecake, and it was amazing! So smooth and creamy, and it tasted so good! THIS IS IMPORTANT: Keep ingredients at room temperature, and mix everything in exactly as written, one by one slowly! Also, I had no cracks! Next time I will whip up a strawberry topping of some sort!

I love love this cheesecake, but honestly, I've messed up on it a few times.  I guess the fact that it is so thick makes it difficult to get it done all the way through without making it brown on the outside.  I've tried lowering the temperature and baking it longer, and I've done the water bath as well.  I guess I need more practice.  The times I have succeeded, however, makes it worth it.  Superb cheesecake!

This recipe is so simple to follow and came out wonderfully! My cheesecake actually didn't crack, which is usually a big issue for me. The cake was very smooth and creamy and was a big hit at my family reunion!

Very delicious!  I used 15 full graham cracker sheets, and 3/4 stick of butter and brought the crust up onto the sides of the springform and I substituted heavy whipping cream for the milk, covered the top with cherry pie filling.  Awesome awesome!

I love NY Cheesecake and have accumulated a number of recipes for it over the years.  Even so, I am always on the lookout for a better recipe.  I was quite excited when I came across this one, especially with the ratings it received.  It was a good cheesecake, but not great.  I have other recipes that are better.  Sorry.

This was not very good. After a cost analysis of the ingredients and thoughts of calories for the amount of tastiness, it makes more sense to buy a frozen sara lee cake. Highly disapointing.

Wow. This was amazing!!!! This was my first cheesecake attempt and it turned out perfectly. I followed instructions exactly, except for the crust (followed Sciota's crust idea)and it couldn't have turned out better! Mine did not crack, so I think the not over-mixing part is very important. I made a caramel sauce from the recipe Bananas in Caramel Sauce on this site, and it was so good that there was none left in less than ten minutes! Everyone at the party loved this and raved!

Anyone who said they won't make this again or it didn't turn out or it was bland should probably stay out of the kitchen.  This is an amazing cheesecake.  Perfect every time, never cracks, etc.  I made this for my b/f's birthday.  I read a lot of the reviews and took a little bit off some of them.  It turned out AMAZING.  Smooth, creamy and had a wonderful flavour.  For the filling, I used 2 tbsps of flour instead of 1/4 C.  I baked it at 225 for 3 hours and 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven.  I made a sour cream topping of 1 C sour cream, 2 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.  It was just unreal.  I was VERY pleased... as was the rest of my family.  Even a friend who hates... HATES ... cheesecake like this one.

Update to review 6-11-10
I just made this recipe again after a year of more. It is still just as good as I remembered, maybe better.  I made 2 for about 50 people and it got rave reviews for everyone.  Personally I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, too rich for me, but even I like this.  It's a perfect recipe as is or you can add variations like chocolate swirl or lemon zest.   


Excellent recipe.  I followed the crust modifications from KIMAR and added a layer of pecans to my crust. I also used a whole vanilla bean and cut the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons.

One of the tastiest cheesecakes .  Creamy and perfect and I usually can't eat a whole piece of cheesecake. This one I could eat seconds.  Son-in-law said best he'd ever eaten. Will be in my collection forever.  11/09 Want to add that some reviews say not enough butter in graham cracker crumbs and they're right, but just add more. I do what other reviewer said to cook 1 hr. 325 and don't open oven and leave in all night. Cook in water bath with alum. foil doubled so water won't leak in.   I do it every time and it's perfect, no cracks.  Then put in fridge.  I add a little cinnamon to crust too.  If you don't like this recipe, you're doing something wrong because it's fool proof.  I use the heavy duty large aluminum foil doubled.  Water bath is a must.  Also, I leave it in oven after turning off overnight sometimes but definitely several hours.  Don't open it or touch it.  I just made crust with gluten free ginger snaps from Trader Joes so hope it's good.  For gluten for I add gluten free flour to mix too.  Works fine!!  I won't make any other cheesecake!!

I was very excited about this recipe but less than thrilled about the results.  I found it very "eggy" and not the thick rich cream cheese texture I was looking for. While the cake didn't go to waste, I'm still on the lookout for that perfect New York cheesecake, like the stuff you get at Carnegie Deli!

This came out perfect! I didn't have a springform pan so I foiled a round pan and peeled off the foil after it had chilled. It looked flawless.

This was delicious.  I used a mixture of vanilla wafer crumbs and graham crackers for the crust because I didn't have enough of the latter, and the crust was still delicious.  Also, for the filling portion, I reduced the recipe by 3/4 so that I only needed only 3 packs of cream cheese.  This was actually plenty and filled my pan.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I am treated like a rock star every time I show up with this cheesecake.  When my nephew graduated from high school last month he told me:  No present.  Just bring me a cheesecake.  Hands down, the best recipe ever.

I made this for my daughter's birthday, and it was a complete sucess!  I used the waterbath for the first time - having cracked every other cheesecake I have tried - and it worked wonderfully.  I also held out 2 cups of batter and mixed in 1/4 cup baking cocoa. Then dropped the chocolated batter in spoonfulls and swirled it with a knife.  About an hour before serving I drizzled melted chocolate over the top (as well as the glass cake plate before putting the cheesecake on) then rimmed the edge with chocolate dipped strawberries. Wow it looked just like a professional one!  It is so cool when something turns out that great on the first try!

I'd never made cheesecake before *IN* MY LIFE, and decided to try this for a family barbeque.  I warned everyone it was my first time making it, and told people not to expect much.  This recipe made it easy. People were AMAZED and asked that I make for all the other family get togethers!  I subsituted nufanchuel (or whatever the lower fat stuff is, next to the cream cheese), for 1/2 the creamcheese (in an effort to make it A LITTLE healthier), and I also made more ghram cracker crust (my preference), and a home-made topping of choice (peach-strawberry in sugar).  I didn't have a water-pan thing, and it DID crack, but the topping I made (peach and strawberries in sugar) covered it up.  Everyone LOVED it and couldn't believe it was my first time making it. And I didn't cook/bake much when I tried to make this...I just know what tastes good.  So the recipie is really easy AND tasty

Also, I used 'hand beating'/mixing because I didn't have a mixer.  I don't know if that makes a difference... but just thought I'd put that out there.

My husband requested a New York style cheesecake for his birthday.  He is quite fussy and I'm pleased to say he just loved this cake.  I added the cinnamon and sugar to the graham crumbs which made for a much nicer tasting crust.  The cake turned out perfect - no cracks.  I topped mine with frozen blueberries and 1/2 cup of micro-melted blueberry jelly.  Delicious!

FANTASTIC!  I couldn't believe how much this makes. It filled TWO 10 inch pre-crusted aluminum pans!!! Next time I will cut the recipe in half.  Very good with a can of cherry pie filling.  Also, I did take some advice:  Mix the sugar and cheese with the mixer, but stir the rest with a spoon.  My cheescake did not crack!  I also only left it in the oven for 1 hour after cooking. It still turned out great!

Yummy!  Half the recipe made 48 mini cheesecakes (in mini muffin pan) and 5 regular muffin size.  I used about 4 Tbsps of butter for the crust and it seemed like it still could have used more since it was still a little dry and crumbly after baking.  I baked the minis for 30 minutes at 350 and the regular muffin size for 40 minutes.  Once chilled, we tried  them with blueberry pie filling, caramel drizzle and strawberry jam -all very disappointing.  I made them for a BBQ and thought I'd have to throw them out but the next day I tried one again, this time without any topping, and it was delicious!  I love the bite size for parties!  My only complaint is that mine must have had air bubbles in the batter because the cheesecake had holes in it instead of being thick and dense but they were still really good!  With a full size, I bake it in a water bath & let it cool in the oven like the recipe says & it's perfect -no cracks! Great recipe -thanks!

I think it tastes better "the next day".  I made it in the morning and we had it that evening after dinner. It tasted too "eggy" to me and I didnt like it. The next day it was much better.

This cheesecake is FABULOUS! I lightened it up in the following way and it came out perfect: Used lowfat cream cheese, lowfat Grahams, substituted vanilla soy yogurt for the sour cream and used a 50/50 blend of Xylitol and Splenda in place of the sugar. I also added a couple of teaspoons of lemon jice. You'd never know the difference from teh original

This is a great and simple recipe!!!  It is true that this is not a dense cheesecake.  It is what I would describe as light and fluffy and is easy to eat.  It is not overpoweringly rich.  I used an 8 inch springform and just scaled the recipe back to 75% of the original and it was the perfect amount.  I also used the alternative crust with the sugar and cinnamon and I HIGHLY recommend it.  It is FABULOUS!!!  Many people suggested more crust so I did not scale back the crust.  I did not use the water bath.  I baked it at 350 for an hour and then let it sit in oven until cooled (never opened the oven).  It cooked with no cracks, set up nicely and the crust was perfect; however, the top cooked with a slight rim around it that cooked a little too brown for my taste.  I simply cut it off with a sharp, serrated knife.  This did leave it looking less than perfect so I made a raspberry sauce and poured it over the top and piled some raspberries in the middle.  The sauce added a tangy taste that worked well with the cheesecake and hid the imperfection.  It is as follows:  1 cup raspberries, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 lemon, 1/4 cup water
Stir, let sit 30 min., process, then strain.
This is a thin sauce and makes enough for a 9 inch cheesecake with a little left over.  It works great with strawberries and frozen berries work as well as fresh.  One last suggestion:  take care when adding the flour, etc.  My batter was perfectly smooth to that point and then got lumpy.  But, don't fear the lumps

The first time around I followed the recipe exactly and gave it 4 stars. The second time around I made mini cheesecakes and used 1/2 of all the servings. I also added 1 Tblsp of condensed milk and 1 Tblsp of heavy whipping cream. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!

This is an excellent basic cheesecake that lends itself to many toppings.   This is the recipe I used when I helped our daughter with her catering business. If directions are followed carefully it will not crack - worth all the fuss.

I made this for a family gathering, and everyone thought it was very good. It cracked I didn't use a waterbath. My problem is I thought the flavor of it was inconsistant, maybe I didn't mix it well enough I was worried about overmixing. I will definately make this again.

This recipe was just ok. The only change I made to the recipe was to add some melted chocolate to the recipe to create a marbled cake, and it was still kind of bland. I ended up with two canyon-sized cracks in the cake, and the crust was very crumbly and unstable. This turned out to be a "fluffy" cheesecake, not a dense on like I was expecting.

Really good!
I followed the advice, room temp ingredients, water bath and leaving it in the oven till completely cooled.
I did not add the milk of the flour as some people suggested it makes it a bit too cakey and not dense enough.
I tried not to overbeat and banged it in the kitchenn surface a bit to get the air bubbles out.
I placed it in a waterbath and after an hour the top was still nice and pale but I didn't have a circle as some people said, it was a bit wobbly and reminded me of vanilla pudding but yeah, I ran a knife around the edge though I think it didn't need that as I greased the tin very well.
I left it in the oven over night as it was pretty late.
Next morning I put it in the fridge and after like 7 hours I had my first slice and it was really creamy and had a good flavour.
I do believe this is the best cheesecake one ca probably make at home.
I do prefer the really dense ones which is basically totally solid but I really enjoyed this cake.

This wasn't the greatest tasting cheesecake.  BUT to be fair, my beater broke about halfway into mixing, so I had to mix everything by hand with a whisk, which I'm assuming explains the lumpiness.  Also, only had about a teaspoon of vanilla, so I'm not sure how that changed the flavor.  I baked it less than suggested (about 50 minutes), but it was overbaked, so I suggest keeping an eye on it.  And I think I might spruce up the crust with maybe some chopped pecans or something.  I was just hoping for something a lot creamier (which again, may be the result of not having a beater).

I followed recipe exact except added 1 tsp vanilla. It needs to cook longer than 10 min at 475 and 1 hr at 200. I had a 4 inch circle in the middle raw. The taste of the cooked part was a 10+. I always bought cheese cakes in Little Italy in NYC and the taste is equal. Just cook longer and you will have a top notch cake.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I definitely would!  This was my first cheesecake and it turned out WONDERFUL!  I served it to a group of ladies at my house and they all thought it was store bought, they didn't believe me when I said I made it!  They just raved :)  I did cheat a little though...I used a graham cracker pie crust since I didn't have the graham crackers or spring-form pan.  Such a simple yet elegant recipe, I will definitely make this over and over!

To make this gluten free substitute 2 TB Cornstarch for the flour in the batter and use gluten-free graham crackers or some other gluten free cracker for the crust.  
I made this last night, with no water bath and only letting it cool for an hour in the oven and it was still great, altho it did crack in the middle.  But it tasted good and was ready for dessert by 8pm and I didn't start it till noon.  Not bad.

This recipe worked beautifully.  The ONLY modification I made was using cinnamon graham crackers instead of plain.  Having never made a cheesecake in a springform pan before, I had no idea how this would come out  I baked it "bain marie" style and it was perfect.  Thank you very much for posting it and I thank the previous reviewers for their tips!

I give this 5+++ hands down, and I believe everyone I served this cheesecake to would agree with me.  I made the cheesecake for the first time, for a friend's birthday party and it was fabulous!  I've made other cheesecake recipes before that were good, but this is above and beyond good.  If I hadn't made it myself you could have served it to me and said it was from The Cheesecake Factory and I would have believed you, it was that good.  It was creamy and smooth with the right amount of sweetness and no overwhelming cream cheese flavor.  I served the cheesecake with a strawberry sauce, but it would have been great plain.  This recipe will be the based for many many cheesecake variations in the future.

My only issue was with the crust, instead of 15 graham crackers I just went ahead and used 2 packages which was 18 crackers, so I used 3 T. butter and that didn't seem like anywhere near enough, so I ended up using 5-6 T.  Even if I would have used just 15 graham crackers I don't think the 2 T. of butter would have been enough.

I made this recipe twice for a party.  The first time I followed the directions perfect; it cracked and was a brown on the top and edges (not v. pretty).  The second time I made it, I read several reviews first.  I ended up following the directions exactly as I did the first time, but baked it in a water bath!!!  IT TURNED OUT PERFECT!!!!!!  I baked both the same day and the only difference was the water bath.  Chantal's Cheesecake is by FAR the BEST cheesecake I have ever had!  I can't wait to have another party so I can bake it again.  I don't usually say WOW THIS IS AWESOME about food I make when I have company over, but I couldn't help it.  It was beautiful!

Wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars...it is excellent! Not much can be said that hasn't already been said. I think that the key for this recipe are the baking instructions. I tend to overbake cheesecakes and check on them frequently while baking which leads to cracking. I followed this recipe's baking instructions exactly and even though it didn't appear to be done, the cooling time firmed everything up, leveled the top and resulted in a perfect cheesecake. Wonderful taste, wonderful texture. Don't bother with looking farther than this recipe...this one's the best! Thanks for sharing.

This cheesecake came out very good.  I made it for a friends b-day at work and have gotten rave reviews so far.  I did things a bit differently.  I did use a water bath and unfortunately, although I covered the pan with foil some water seeped into the crust so it was a bit soggy.  I cooked the cheesecake for an hour and then left it in the oven for 2 hours, left it on the counter for 1 hour and then put it in the fridge.  Unfortunately there was a huge crack right down the center of my cake anyway.  I'll have to figure out how to stop that, trial and error is the only option I guess.  This was my very first cheesecake and was really a success especially with the good reviews I got from friends.  Will definitely make this again.

Well I have made "Chantals New York Cheesecake" many times now and it's always hit in our house; the first time I made it I was very disappointed at the color which is why this recipe only gets 4 stars as is.  The high temp. causes it to get dark.  Many people suggest putting it in a waterbath or putting a big pan of water beneath the cheesecake while it bakes, I've tried the later and it didn't work, my cheesecake still darkened.  OK so besides the color the cheesecake is wonderful!  The flavor the density and thickness are spot on.  Going back to the waterbath; If you like a softer cheescake that is what you will get from the steam of a waterbath, to get a firm "New York" style cheesecake I wouldn't use one. So yesterday I made the "almost" perfect baked (no waterbath) cheesecake... I followed the recipe and then messed up with the temperature... That's what happens when you read too many reviews! lol... I Covered my cheesecake with aluminum foil and baked at 350 for 30 minutes then I lowered the temp to 325 taking foil off for last 30 mintues and preceeded to let cool in the oven; my cheesecake was "underdone" in the center for our Thanksgiving dinner but looked beautiful and not brown or cracked... Maybe I was the only one who noticed the slightly gooey center but I think I will do the same thing next time only not turn the oven down for the last 30 minutes... Perfect cheesecake is an effort, I know why they charge $30-$40. for them at bakery's.. :) ~ Happy Thanksgiving!

I've made this several times and it always gets great comments. I bake at least a day ahead, two days is preferable. Wrap in plastic wrap then foil and refrigerate. Bring to almost room temperature before serving. Fantastic!

You simply cannot mess up this recipe.  I forgot to turn off the oven and baked it for another 45 minutes, so when I turned off the oven I opened the door to cool it down faster, then shut the door and left it another couple hours.  It only sank to level and no cracks.  It was very firm but I like it that way!  Used a water bath.  Everyone at work loved it!  Served with fresh strawberries, PERFECT!

This is better than the cheesecake from scratch I made while working in a great little restaurant.

I used wide foil to cover the bottom of the springform pan and put it in a water bath too. It's just a thing I do.

Now I've seen some of the pictures posted and you DO NOT need to make the top golden brown, that means you overcooked it. Please stop :)

Best cheesecake EVER.  Foolproof.  Came out beautifully! Once it was done baking I turned the oven off and let it sit for several hours then chilled it overnight. Perfect, no cracks, and very very good.

I was a little nervous making this cheesecake since it was my first attempt and heard that they could be tricky to make but after seeing all the positive reviews I knew I had to try it.  I took the advice of other reviewers and baked my cheesecake in a water bath and used room temperature ingredients.  Just make sure you wrap your pan with a double layer of foil and preferbly the extra large foil as opposed to the standard size if using the water bath to prevent water from getting into the pan (I used a double layer of the reg. size and some water seeped in).  My cheesecake came out so well, very creamy and didn't crack!  I'll definitely be making this again, esp because I already have a request to make it for my sister's birthday.

Best cheesecake ever.  I am asked to make this all the time for events.  It has become my signature dessert!  Mine always cracks so I top it with a maple glaze from a different cheesecake recipe and it is received with rave reviews.

Seriously the best recipe! Took it to a family party and everyone thought I bought it! My husband loves cheesecake and he loves making them and his always cracked and it would make him so mad, so I look and found this recipe and cooked it in a water bath and it was amazing! We put chocolate and caramel syrup and made a marble look. Where the caramel was the cake cracked, but I am pretty sure it was because of the caramel. My only question is, even with the the foil around the pan a little water got in. How do you make it so the foil keeps the water out completely?

This is my first cheesecake ever and i followed the recipe to the tee, except for the crust.  it came out perfect!  After an hour of baking, i cut it off as instructed.  I kept it in the oven for at least 3 hours afterwards and never opened the oven door and it came out un-cracked and golden brown.  I had nothing but raves on it.  Will do it again and again.  It's a great recipe, just follow directions.

This cheesecake really is amazing. I read several of the reviews before making it and took some of the advice - the water bath was a good idea. I decided, again because of the reviews, to make the crust using the recipe on the Philly cream cheese package (1/4 cup melted butter mixed with 1 1/4 cups of graham cracker crumbs)and the result was excellent. It did crack while sitting the two hours in the oven, but I think it was probably because we had a cold snap and the air was super dry even with the water bath. I then covered it with plastic wrap, making sure it was placed directly on the surface so that the cake would not form a dry "skin". This came off with no problems the next day. 
I took the cheese cake to my boyfriend's for Easter Dinner and it was a huge hit. (I sliced it in the kitchen and spooned cherry topping over it so no one had any idea it had cracked.) I was also pleasantly surprised at how creamy it was - and pretty proud of myself. 
I am adding this recipe to my collection as a definite keeper!

This is a very good cheesecake...

The best tip I can give people is that instead of adding the vanilla, flour, and sour cream directly to the cheese mixture individually - it is better to whisk them together in a small bowl before adding. This will prevent any unseemly lumps within the batter....

It's better than the rest !! One guy said that it literally gave him goosebumps upon the first bite. Another guy told his stuffy wife (who passed on all dessert in an 8 week class)that she "had to try this one".  If you are even considering this recipe "JUST DO IT".  It will really make you look like you are a pro.

I've had some trouble with this recipe, and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. The waterbath helps me little -- sometimes I end up with just a tiny crack, other times it's as deep and wide as the Grand Canyon.   The last time I tried cooking it slower (and longer) it ended up being an underdone soupy mess. I just keep making it, though, because the flavor is FANTASTIC.

I followed the directions exactly, or so I thought.  I assumed that when the cheese cake was done baking I should take it out of the oven, so not to overcook.  I was wrong and suppose that the extra heat and time in the oven IS nessesary because the middle of the cake was not cooked completely.  Overall great texture,(except for the middle) and great favor, thus the five star rating.

I make this every year for Christmas at the request of my Aunt and Grandmother! I've made it in springform tins, muffin tins for individual cheesecakes, with caramel, with pumpkin pie spice... And always, ALWAYS amazing. My lovely boyfriend got me electric beaters last year, now my family thinks ill bring cheesecake everywhere :) love it, great recipe, versatile and delicious.

Wow!  This cheesecake was fantastic!  It was my first one ever and it came out perfect!  I followed the tips of the first 3 reviews:  ingredients at room temperature, careful to not overbeat (though i did use my countertop mixer and not a wooden spoon as recommended), water bath and cinnamon crust recipe.  My cheesecake had no cracks whatsoever and was perfectly smooth and looked like one you buy at the store.  Everyone loved it and it was unbelieveably easy to make.  This is recipe to use!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever made. It was very easy to make and everyone loved it. I've made cheesecakes before that turned out just okay. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you Chantal!

The suggested baking time was a little too long (for my oven) but apart from the slightly browned top and edges, the cake turned out really well. It was the very first cake I've ever baked, and it got really good reviews! It turned out to be a little more dense then I had expected, but the texture was right. I added some instant coffee to give it some kick. Really easy to make. My husband was disappointed that there wasn't more because everyone else had finished the cake.

What a fantastic recipe!!!
I completely disregarded the springform pan, but it came together just fine.
I also used a 9" Keebler ready crust.  No cracking, no problems at all!

Question: did anyone get enough batter to make TWO 9" cheesecakes?  Because I did, and I didn't see any other reviews noting this.  Did I do something wrong?  Or is there just a lot of batter?

I have made this many times now and it never disappoints!!  I've tried pretty much  all of the  tips on how to not let the top crack, but nothing seems to work.  It doesn't really matter though, if your going to top it with a fruit spread anyway.  I always use a combination of 2 regular cream cheese and 2 no-fat cream cheese and I cannot tell the difference - it always comes out rich and creamy and wonderful.  Thank you!!

First time that I have made cheescake from scratch.  turned out great but a little dry - that was my fault, I left it in a little longer because I didnt think it was done yet.  topped with melted dark chocolate and raspberries.  everyone loved it!

OMG!!  I made this as my birthday cake and it was HEAVEN.  I halved the recipe as I don't own a springform pan and only had a 9 inch pie plate and it was perfect.  I cooked it for 60 min at 325 in a water bath and did not open the door, and after 60 minutes left in the oven for 3 extra hours.  It was perfect and not a crack in sight.  It tasted amazing, although it didn't quite have the texture I prefer in a cheesecake, which is a firm texture.  It was light and creamy.  But it could have been something I did, and it is something that I can completely overlook as the taste is so amazing!  ***update***  I have made this recipe probably 10 times now and never had a problem until today!  I finally got a springfoam pan so I used it for the first time, followed the recipe as always (after the first time, I cut the flour to 2 tbsp to get the texture I like) and today I got 2 HUGE cracks!  I am so disappointed because I have come to depend on this recipe to give me a perfectly baked cheesecake every time

My very FIRST attempt at making a cheesecake, and after reading many reviews, I was so apprehensive!  Some said that a bain marie was essential - others said not to use one.  I just didn't want to waste the ingredients on a failed attempt.  I chose Chantal's recipe due to the ratings and positive reviews, and SO glad I did!  I followed ingredients as per the recipe.  Did not have a baking pan large enough to accomodate my springform pan, so followed anothers advice and placed a pan with water in the oven alongside the springform pan.  I did wrap the springform in heavy duty Reynolds wrap foil just in case of leaks.  Baked 1 hr., then turned oven off and left cake in with door closed for 4 hrs. (bedtime!).  Just 1 minor crack in the top...no big deal.  Will be serving tonite with fresh blueberry sauce for hubby & son...I am the only cheesecake "purist" who loves it just as it is.  Excellent recipe - excellent results! Many thanks, Chantal!!

I had promised my teenage son the requested New York cheesecake for his birthday and this one delivered his rave reviews. He is a choosy one about what he eats so this is significant!  I read many of the suggestions and modifications and chose a few. I did the water bath and the cheesecake surface was incredibly smooth and uncracked.  As for the crust, I used the suggestion of half graham cracker crumbs and half vanilla wafers. It was delightful. A touch of sweetness but still a great crunchy crust. This was a gem in the opinion from someone who knows her cheesecakes! A real keeper.

True to the promise, it's a good cheesecake. I followed directions to the letter and put blueberries on top. I will try and add less milk, I feel that 3/4 cup is way too much and makes it just a tiny bit runny in the centre.

This tasted really great! I did it just as the recipe stated and used a springform pan, and it did end up having a big crack in the middle (but since I really can't cook at all, and having it end up tasting great...it didn't matter) If I can do this and it comes out edible, anyone can do this recipe!

This is the best cheesecake recipe ever!!  It's the only recipe I will use from now on.  My whole family loved it.  The texture was great and the flavor was to die for.  I'm making more this weekend.  This will be my new dessert to bring to functions.

This really is the best. Purists say never is there flour or cornstarch in real cheesecake but without it-expect cracks and poor texture. This recipe has everthing you need for the perfect cheesecake and nothing you don't. I've made this several times with rave results.

This is by far the BEST cheesecake recipe ever!  Bain marie (waterbath) is ESSENTIAL, as is turning the oven off and leaving the cake ALONE for 5 hours.  I've made this cake a few times and it is a huge hit with everyone.  I added two teaspoons of sugar to the graham cracker crust mix to sweeten it slightly.  I always top with a can of cherry pie filling as my husband loves cherry cheese cake.  One can makes a PERFECT topping.

Delicious!!!  Used the water bath, and followed directions exactly.  Worked perfectly, no cracks.  After the hour baking time, I turned the oven off, and left the cake inside as directed.  I remember thinking this doesn't look done.  Cake was very, very wet, and had not pulled away from the sides the way others had indicated it would, so I was a little concerned.  However, I looked again 2 hours later, and the cake didn't look wet anymore.  I left in the oven overnight, by morning it had pulled away from the sides.  I let it age in the refridgerator 2 days before serving.  The flavor was awesome, perfect.  Not to sweet, a good cheesecake.  Deserves all the ratings it is receiving.  Thanks Chantal!

This is great recipe...made a few changes: used heavy whipping creme instead of milk.  add more butter (margarine) to the crust mix and used half vanillia wafers and half graham crackers. I also added 2 tsps of lemon juice to the cheese cake mixture.  Have at times also substituted equal amounts of Splenda for the sugar...and it tastes just wonderful for the diabetic cheese cake lovers...

My cheesecake cracked on top, but that doesn't bother me :] I'm pretty sure that I over mixed it, but I was looking for flavor and not presentation and I definately found the flavor! This cheesecake tastes great and creamy and delicious! YUM!

I made this for my husband's birthday and he loved it. I ran into a few small problems: it doesn't say how many cups the 15 graham crackers amount to which posed a small problem because I used teddy grahams instead. (all the graham crackers had ingredients that I don't use and the only natural brand at the store  I was at only came in bear shapes) I used the whole box which amounted to 2 1/2 cups. I had to use twice as much butter to bind it leading me to believe that I had too many bears. 
Next, the recipe made a TON of filling. I  have no idea why, I followed the recipe exactly. I don't have a springform pan so I used a Pyrex pie dish and filled it to the top and still had enough for one more, which was fine but confusing. 
I was baking other things so I took it out of the oven immediately, after one hour. It was baked perfectly, golden around the edges and creamy in the center. It looked soft and perfect except for two small-ish cracks that wasn't a big deal for me. 
I know a lot of folks take cheesecake baking very seriously but mine was perfect enough for us, tasted great and had just the right amount of crust-to-filling ratio, despite my minor deviations from the recipe. I spelled out "35" in raspberries and you couldn't even see my small cracks. 
Next time I would add a tiny bit of lemon extract, juice or rind but as is was great too.

It didn't blend together very smoothly and the top was very dark.  Good flavor but not too good presentation.

I made this cheesecake, and while it was really good, it didn't seem to be any more special than any other cheesecake I've made before.  But then again, I'm not a real big fan of plain cheesecake.  I think it would be great with added flavor, maybe chocolate or raspberry or even marbled! Yumm! I will definately make this recipe again, but with flavors, instead of plain.

This was the most delicious basic cheesecake I have ever tasted in my life. It was gone within minutes for my family. I highly recommend this recipe.

I followed these tips from other viewers and get perfect results every time:

1) Use a waterbath.
2) Don't overbeat the ingredients.
3) You only need to leave it in for 2 hours, not 6. It won't crack.

I followed the recipe closely and it turned out beautifully. No cracks, no sinkholes. The only change I made was baking the cake in a water bath as suggested by other reviewers. The cake pulled away from the sides of the pan (which were NOT greased) and I didn't need to cut around the edges. I used a heavy non-stick springform pan. I doubled the butter to make the crust because I knew from the look of the graham cracker and butter mixture that it would not hold. I give it 4 stars because the texture is not the kind I like for cheesecake. Otherwise, great recipe!

This is amazing, every time I make it. I do shut the oven off after its done baking, and let the cheesecake sit in it overnight. However,I would be careful to remove the foil-wrapped spring form pan from the waterbath when you are letting it cool, as water can eventually seep into the bottom of the springform pan.

I can't understand how people couln't love this recipe. It came out rich and creamy not too eggy. We ate it plain and loved it! Thank you for the recipe. This recipe isn't for people who don't have previous experience making cheesecake or know how to follow directions.

I had never tried making a cheesecake before simply because I don't really like the stuff. But on a whim on day I decided to experiment. It came out perfect and got rave reviews. I ended up having to make another within the week for a friend's birthday and he requested one over the Christmas holidays for a party. I don't think that I will even bother trying another recipe. 5 stars and 5 thumbs up. I baked it in a waterbath and used a regular cake pan that was brushed with melted butter and lined with waxed paper. I can't contemplate how some others' cracked. I ate a whole slice and for a non cheesecake lover that says a lot.

Easiest cheesecake recipe I've ever tried. Excellent taste; no cracks. Sprayed sides of pan and baked in a water bath. Let sit in oven only about 2 hours. Tasted even better after about 3 days.

This was soooo awesome! I was told it was more than 5 stars!! I baked in a water bath and NO cracks. WooHoo! I made the crust a little different. 2 C of crushed graham crackers, 6 T of butter, 3 T of sugar, and a bit of cinnamon. Thanks so much for this great recipe!!

Followed recipe exactly and left in oven for 5 hrs w/o opening door, but it cracked.  Guess I should have used the water bath like other reviewers suggested.  However, still great flavor and everyone loved despite the crack which was covered with strawberries!

I followed the recipe exactly and found Chung_Brenda's tips very useful.  My cheesecake did not crack and was the most delicious cheesecake my family has ever eaten!  This is a big compliment because they are all cheesecake-lovers who unfortunately have a Mom who does not like cheesecake.

Thank you for the recipe (and for the tips, Chung-Brenda).

This recipe sets the standard for all cheesecakes!  As one reviewer stated, the flavor and texture are perfect.  Visually, it's magazine cover worthy.  I followed the advice of those before me:  add more butter to the graham cracker crumbs and cook it in a water bath.  I wouldn't change one thing in the actual batter recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing!

The BEST cheesecake I have ever tasted!! I cheated by using a pre-made pie crust but the filling was delicious. Mine did crack a little but take in mind it was my first time ever making cheesecake.

Wonderful! I'm not much of baker and I've never made cheesecake before, so I'm amazed this came out so perfect! I used the water bath and left it to cool in the oven for 5.5 hours and got no cracks (see my photo). :)

A word of advice to anyone using the water bath -make sure you DOUBLE wrap it with tin-foil!! I only used one layer and somehow it got a little hole in it (even though I thought I'd been really careful!). Thankfully it didn't get into the cake, but it would have been a disaster if I'd been using a crappier cake-tin. 

Thank you for a wonderful recipe -I'll definitely make this again!!

HEAVENLY!  I followed the suggestions of others to let ingredients come to room temperature first.  I also put a pan of water on a rack under the cheesecake - followed everything else to a T and it was awesome!

This was the best cheesecake that I have ever tasted in my life.  It was so thick and rich, I couldn't believe that it turned out so well on my first try.  This is a fool proof recipe, just follow the directions.  From reading the hints from former reviewers, I did wrap the pan in AL foil and set it in a water bath.  I had no cracks nor did it brown..... Beautiful!!!!!!

Awesome!  I made it for a party and got many compliments.  I baked it for one hour in a water bath.  I took it out and cut around the edges of the pan and placed back into the warm oven for 2 more hours.  There was no cracking.  I served it with strawberry and cherry pie filling as a topper.

This was my first attempt at a NY style cheesecake (other than an Italian Ricotta cheesecake - quite different).  It was easy enough, and I followed other suggestions (waterbath, room temp on the ingredients)and it still cracked.  So the presentation wasn't great, but the taste was really good and the texture creamy.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Perhaps getting it not to crack is a matter of practice makes perfect??  I would make this one again.  I had leftovers, so I sliced the remainder and froze it. Hope it freezes well...

The texture and taste of this cheesecake was perfectly how I like it. I dont like creamy cheesecake, i like it a little more solid. My pan was larger than the recipe called for, its 10.5" so it wouldnt fit in the water bath as reviewers had mentioned. So I just filled a cake pan with hot water and put it on the shelf below it. I put it in the oven for 60 minutes on the dot, and then turned it off and let it cool for five hours WITHOUT OPENING THE DOOR. This is very important so you don't let out the steam and heat! Mine did not crack! Turned out beautifully. Only thing I didn't like was the crust, but that's probably because I bought the graham crackers with added fiber instead of the regular kind. Oops!

Good cheesecake, but after 1 1/2 hours of cooling, it explode after removing it from the pan. Will definitely leave for longer next time.

WOW!  Made this for thanksgiving and it was gone before anything else!  It was so good!  The only changes that I made were that I made mine into a "brownie cheesecake" by adding cooked brownie bites to it before baking and used chocolate animal crackers for the crust.  I took the advice of others and put the pan of water underneath, turned it off at the required time and didnt open the oven again until time to take out.  It was great!!!

I followed this recipe to the T and came out with a HUGE crack in the middle which almost separates the cake in half.  But I had to come back and re-rate with 5 stars....the flavor is perfect!!!  I think maybe someone just slammed the door while I was baking...I will try this again!!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. This will be my new fallback cheesecake recipe.  As others suggested, FIRST bring all ingredients to room temperature, DO NOT overmix, DO NOT remove from oven early.  DO enjoy a dense, not too sweet cheesecake!  I cannot wait to try new variations using this recipe. Love it!

I just made this for Thanksgiving, and it turned out perfect! No cracks and very dense. Everyone loved it so much they finished it off even though there were 4 other desserts. In fact, my 16 yr. old son asked me to make it again today! I followed the recipe (except for the crust-I used purchased graham cracker crumbs and added some cinnamon), made sure the ingredients were room temp. and also greased the sides of the springform pan. I didn't set the pan in a water bath, but I did put a 9x11 pan of water on the bottom rack. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone that loves cheesecake!

I made 2 of these. One in my pressure cooker and one in the oven.  They both came out perfect.  The only advice I would give is if you are cooking it in a pressure cooker is cook it for 35 minutes, take it off the burner and let the pressure cool down naturally.  I would say about 30 min. It will look a bit pale on top.  Put it in the fridge for 3-4 hours to firm up.  I made the mistake of cooling it on the counter for an hour and then digging in.  It was very loose in the middle and oozed out.  It is very important to refrigerate it first.

I am a beginner baker and I wanted to try this recipe. It was easy to put together. I read most of the reviews on tips. I did the 2 in. of water on the shelf below the pan. No changes to the recipe except for some cinnoman on the crust. Baked 1 hr @ 350 then turned off. Of course I peaked 2 hours later and several times after that. Finally a long 5 hours I took it out to put in the fridge over night and not a single crack. I took it to the In-laws Thanksgiving dinner with Strawberry topping and it was a hit. No peices left over. I will defintately bake again.

Awesome recipe.  We subbed Bailey's Irish Cream for the milk and it was excellent. Add about 20 minutes more to the cook time though. Everything else we did to a T.

This cheesecake is marvelous and absolutely  no cracks. It was my first time making cheesecake and I will definitely use it again. A special note, however, the crust is wonderful if you add some cinnamon, sugar and a little more butter to make it just right!!! Enjoy!

This was a good cheesecake, but after reading some of the reviews, I thought that it would be phenomenal - it wasn't.  The crack that appeared, however, was!!

This was wonderful. I did take the advice of LaruelC and only used 2 tbs of flour and baked at 225 for 3 hours 40 min. Had a pan of water on the second shelf. I did not crack the door at all. After the baking time I turned off the oven and just left it alone for 6 more hours. It has a very creamy texture. I am afraid more flour would make it more cakey. I will definitely be making this again.

I've cooked this cheesecake more than 20 times now.  First 5 times, it cracked every time.  Then I found the secret!  

DON'T BOTHER WITH ALL THAT WATER BATH NONSENSE!  You don't need to.  Just FOLLOW THE RECIPE.

Here's the secret.  Grease the springform pan - bottom and sides.  Then line the springform pan with baking paper.  It won't stick to the sides and won't crack.  I bake it for about an hour at 150 deg C (fan forced) in my oven.  I turn the oven off and let it cool with the door open a little for about 4 hours.   I know that's not what Chantal says - but it still doesn't crack!

I use two tablespoons of self-raising flour.  If you want a less cakey taste and a lighter creamier texture - use less flour.

The other "secret" is - the cream cheese MUST be at room temperature when you beat it.  And you must beat the hell out of the cream cheese and sugar to get rid of all the lumps!

DON'T beat the eggs any more than you have to.  Add them one at a time and mix slowly until they are just barely combined.  Same for the other ingredients.  Don't over mix them.  

I love this cheesecake and I wouldn't bother cooking it if I had to do that silly waterbath business.  You don't need to bother with it either.

This was very good. I'd been looking for a creamy cheescake and this fit the bill. I understand now why this is a good basic cheesecake; the other recipe I make has a better flavor but this one has the right texture, but if you put any kind of topping on this, you can't go wrong. Will definitely make this again.

This was my first cheesecake. It turned out better than I hoped! The texture is wonderful and it tastes heavenly. The only problem I encountered was a cracking top....even after I followed the instructions. I might read some of the reviews and cheesecake tips to see if I can prevent it from happening next time. But I will definitely use this recipe over and over!!! It's nice to find the perfect recipe on the first try!

The best cheesecake I have ever tasted!  I don't like to taste too much of the cream cheese twang in a cheesecake.  This was perfect, just enough sour to sweet.  It ended up with some pretty major cracks, though.  I think next time I will bake it in a water bath.  Thank you for the recipe!

A great original cheesecake recipe. I would have preferred a firmer texture and a more flavorful, less buttery crust, though. I will bake this again, using oreo for the crust and baking the crust first before adding the cheesecake filling.

This recipe turned out great for me. I have a set of three spingform pans so I used the 9 1/2 inch one and placed it inside of the 10 1/2 inch one for added thickness. I baked it exactly like the directions and left it in the oven for six hours and refrigerated overnite and it couldn't have looked or tasted any better. Will definitely make again.

I recently made this for my husbands birthday party. It was absolutely fantastic! My husband doesn't like graham cracker so I did replace the graham cracker with about 1 1/2C chopped walnuts and 1/3C of light brown sugar. I don't usually bake but this was so easy and turned out so well I'm looking forward to making it for the holidays! Thank You So Much!!!

Amazing! This is so ceramy and delicious! As did other reveiwers, I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust to give it more flavor. Instead of placing the pan directly in a water bath, I placed a pan of water on the shelf below the cheesecake in the oven and it worked out perfectly, as suggested. I served mine with an apple pie filling spooned on, then drizzled with melted caramel- It was sooo yummy! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This turned out really well, considering that I didn't have time to improvise for a waterbath, and the ancient springform pan I ended up using. Not much advice I can add to the 1000+ reviews previously posted, but thanks anyway, Chantal.

Great recipe!  I followed the suggested of  CHUNG_BRENDA and wrapped the springform pan with 2 layers of aluminum foil then put the pan in a water bath in the oven, filled with 1 inch of very hot water.  I left the cheesecake in the oven for 5 or 6 hours.  It turned out perfect!

Thanks

Apparently this came out great, but I never got to try it because it was all gone by the time I had a chance to get a slice! I did swirl some melted strawberry jam in to the top and also topped it with fresh strawberry slices that I had dipped in a bowl of sugar-water. I only heard good things about it...

My first attempt at a "real" cheesecake and it was amazing.  I started a little late so ended up taking it out before the 5 hours was up but next time I won't since it was a tiny bit softer in the middle than it should have been.  Still absolutely wonderful flavor and texture.  I did put a pan of water on the tray below while baking and it worked - no cracks! My husband loved it with a strawberry sauce and I thought it was great covered with mini-chocolate chips and drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce.

This cheesecake was very good!  I made it in a round cake dish instead of a spring pan, and it turned out very good.  I topped the cake with strawberries and chocolate syrup.

This is by far, the best cheesecake recipe!  I topped it with strawberry pie filling - it was a huge hit.

I made this and it turned out incredible.  I've never made a good cheesecake until this one.  I got many compliments and I myself probably ate 1/2 of it.  Awesome recipe!

I used an alternative base from a different recipe at allrecipes to give the shortcrust texture i was after, i also left out the sour cream and used double/heavy cream instead to give a soft, dense texture and gentle flavour that was amazing, you could eat so much of it, definately a keeper and the best cheesecake recipe i have found so far. thanks

Such a great recipe I was so worried that it was gonna turn out bad and was perfect didnt last no time on the table . Word of advise make sure you let the cake sit in the oven for the recommended time it does make a huge difference. Great JOB

This Cake was amazing! i decorated it with strawberries and chocolate drizzle and added a little bit of chocolate chips ont he inside. i used a completely different crust recipe and found that useing premade graham cracker crumbs was much easier. i used only 3/4 cup of cour cream and it made it a WHOLE lot better than one cup!

This is my absolute favorite cheesecake recipe! I usually top it with fresh berries. It is always a hit with guests, and looks much harder than it actually is to make. :) I have been asked for the recipe many times. Delish!!

Absolutely Delicish (in the words of Rachel Ray - LOL)!!! People would not believe that I made this cheesecake by myself. It was a perfect NY Style cheesecake - rich, thick, creamy and just the right amount of sweetness! I added a layer of strawberry glaze and fresh strawberry halves to top it off! Fabulous - this one is a keeper!

Honestly the most AMAZING cheesecake I've ever made. I took it to my Dad for Father's Day and he couldn't believe the smoothe flavor and texture. I eliminated 5 of the graham crackers and did add 1/4 C. sugar to the crust. Entire cheescake was gone before we left.

This is a great recipe. It was the first time I ever made a cheese cake and it turned out perfect. I did follow the advice from others on: 1/4 C butter & 2T of sugar to the crust. I also added just 1 tsp of lemon juice and I used a water bath while it was cooking. It turned out perfect. Thank you for the recipe!

I have never made a Cheesecake and thought that I would make one since I was having dinner guests. Everyone loved the cheesecake and I am so pleased with how it turned out. My husband said that it was the best cheesecake he has ever had.

Luscious!  I've made this three times now; twice with a splash of lemon juice in the mixture, and served with a raspberry and orange coulis.  The third time I added a block of dark chocolate to half the batter and made a marbled cheesecake--yummy!  I use gingernuts for the base, too, and vanilla paste as well as essence.

Don't bother with foil-wrapped springform tins!  I make mine in a regular piedish and it works beautifully (with a water bath).  There's always enough mix left over to make a cheesecake 'loaf' in a loaf tin as well.  That one sits at the bottom of the oven, without a water bath, and never cracks either!  Seriously, this is a surprisingly forgiving recipe, and definitely delish.  Make the day before; I've found if I taste it while still warm (even barely) it tastes rather bland and boring.  But 24 hours later... mmmm.

My cheesecake cracked even though I left it in the oven for the 6 hours and didn't open the door.  However, that took nothing away from the flavor.  Very good and easy.  Will definately make this again.

This was amazing...I used all the tips I've found online for cheesecakes, and ended up with a perfect one! I baked it for 65 minutes, and then turned the oven off and left it in the oven for about 6 hours (until oven was completely cool). Refrigerated it for over 24 hrs. Not a crack in it, and my coworkers thought it had come from a bakery! Thank you for sharing! I will continue to use this recipe.

I have made many "fancy" cheesecakes and was looking for something more basic- just to really enjoy and not mix with snickers or nuts, etc..I followed the recipe but just added some extra sugar to the crust-(few tbls)  I only left it in the oven an hour after and about half hour on the counter and then refrigerated it and ate it about 5 hours later.  It was perfect.  Great texture and flavor- not too fluffy, not too dense- not overly sweet.  I served it in strawberries that had been soaking all day in some sugar.  A huge it.  Will make many times.  Had to give away most of the leftover so I wouldnt attack it all the next day!!

This was my first time baking a cheesecake and it came out almost perfectly. The only problem was taht it did crack on top, but I think that was partly my fault since I peeked while it was cooling ;). But it was so dense, delicious, and I heard from more than one person that it was the best they had ever had.

This was great!  It was first attempt at a "real" New York Cheesecake.  I followed some of the suggestions in the other reveiws.  It didn't crack and it was very creamy.  Will be making again for my husband's class reunion.

I made this cheesecake for my mother, who is a master baker, and she loved it. It is a lot of batter (enough for a second cheesecake) but it turned out perfect. I added a mashed banana and a dash of banana flavoring. I topped it with sliced strawberries. It was so good. My mother was even a bit jealous! Thanks for the recipe! It was easy to make too.

Family loved this!  I only halfed the recipe because of a smaller pan, and it still gave a lot!  I made this for the first time and I think I will stick to this recipe.  Very easy...THANKS!

I first made this recipe for a family birthday party.  My graham cracker crust recipe had ground almonds and walnuts included and a stick of unsalted butter - melted (an old favorite).  Although my pan was too large for a bath, I did use a pan of water underneath.  The cheesecake did crack - but never was noticed from anyone.  Everybody absolutely loved it!!!  I'm having dinner guests tomorrow night and I am making this cheesecake recipe again.  My brother gave it 'two thumbs up' and my son adores cheesecake - - everyone loved it!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I will make a chocolate sauce to accompany it!

I recommend this recipe for ANYONE!

I have made tons of cheesecakes before and none ever turned out as good as this one.  I have made this 4 times, and am just about to make it again.  It is very easy to make, creamy and sooo delicious.  I usually make it late at night, and just put the cheesecake in the fridge after I wake up in the morning.  I highly recommend this recipe, everyone raves about it!  The only difference I ever make is sometimes I use an oreo crust and sprinkle oreos on top

There's not much more I can add that hasn't already been said.  The only thing was... I had to practically double the crust.  I don't see how you could possiblyhave enough using the amounts as written.

I shouldn't be surprised, that this would be as fabulous as it truly is..900 people can't be wrong. =P This was my first attempt at making a baked cheesecake. It was cracked and soo very ugly, but tasted soooo good!!! Forgot about the bath water (my mistake), but I piled no sugar added cherry pie filling on top of the cake and (voila!) it looked pretty as a picture. lol This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

This recipe was good, it did crack a little in the center, I crushed the graham crackers myself, however next time I think I will buy the precrushed ones. I topped with some chocolate sundae syrup and fruit and the family loved it.

I thought this was a good recipe.  I added canned cherries to the top.  My cheesecake split really bad even though I followed the recipe exactly.

I made this for my christmas dessert, wow! It was the first time I have made a cheesecake. I made it a lime cheesecake, I used about 1/4 cup of keylime juice and reduced the milk slightly. I decorated with twisted keylime slices. Very Very good. I also used the water bath when baking and cracked the door after baking during cool down, Absolutely flawless esthetically. I have already been asked to bake this again.

This is a very easy cheesecake to make.  I made it for a friend's birthday and everyone seemed to love the taste.  However, I was somewhat disappointed that even after following the directions to a tee and doing a water bath--the cheesecake had a HUGE crack!!! Definitley NOT very pretty! I will definitley make again but not cook as long as the edges also turned a little too brown--I am sure it's just my oven!!!!!! :) Overall a very easy and delicious cheesecake--just wish I could figure out what to do to keep it from cracking! Any suggestions are appreciated!!! :)

This was really good.  I'm not experienced making cheesecakes so I didn't know it was okay to be jiggly in the center.  I cooked 15 mins long because of the jiggle.  I left it in the oven for three hours, the jiggle went away and was replaced with a huge crack.  It doesn't matter though because I put cherries on it.  Very, Very delicious.

This was PERFECT! I have been so scared to attempt making cheesecake, but this was AMAZING. I made it for New Year's and all night, everyone commented on how great it tasted. It didn't crack at all and the texture was perfect, just like a store-bought cheesecake! I will definitely be making this again!

I made this cheesecake for Christmas and it was perfect!  It neither cracked nor sagged and was beautiful and absolutely yummy in texture and flavor.  My cream cheese was out of the frig for hours to ensure room temperature.  Also I baked it in the evening, turned the oven off and went to bed so it cooled in the oven overnight.  I left it in the spring form pan until a few hours before serving.  My family is already wanting me to bake another one...and I definitely will!

I made this cheesecake again to see if it would be as good the second time around. I have had no complaints, everyone loves this cheesecake and there is never enough. Ensure that the cream cheese is at room temperature and always use a water bath. This cheesecake is too good to be true.

WOW!! This cheesecake is a winner! It did crack, but who cares? I did add a little sugar and extra butter to the graham cracker crust. I served it with dark chocolate sauce on the plate and raspberries on top. Yum!

Made it Cristmas eve for Christmas dinner.   Had to use a little more butter to keep the crust from being too crumbly, but followed the recipe exactly.  The only difference was that I used a water bath.  It was awesome, better than  in most restaurants.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was my first attempt to make cheesecake, and at first, after it was done in the oven, it looked like it was still really undone.  HOwever, after chilling for several hours and letting it freeze, then thaw, it turned out excellent!

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake. I followed the recipe exactly, except using reduced fat sour cream because it's all I had. I didn't use a water bath, and mine cracked pretty badly. It may also be because I opened the door a couple times. I was a little disappointed in the texture/taste at first, but after a few hours in the fridge... it was AWESOME! It was like a totally different cake. My fiance and I were so surprised. I made a prettier one to take with us for Christmas and didn't open the door this time. (and still didn't use a water bath) It looks much better!

First off, let me just say that I'm a firm believer in the Cheesecake-By-Water-Bath method.  I have switched from recipe to recipe for my cheesecakes, but I have *always* tried the water bath.  However, since my apartment has the teeniest, tiniest oven, and I'm unable to fit a roasting pan big enough to fit my springform pan into it, the waterbath is right out.  So, desperate, I tried this recipe.  The method itself is odd, and I did have to rotate the pan because it was browning unevenly.  Two hours into its cooling down inside the oven, however, I noticed a small crack.  I thought, okay, whatever.  Half an hour later, the crack was much larger, so I pulled it out and let it cool the rest of the way on the stove.  So, one star taken away for my not-so-aesthetically-pleasing cheesecake.  HOWEVER.  Oh, wow, was the recipe itself good.  The cheesecake was moist, deliciously rich, crumbly and not soft (how a good, deli cheesecake should be!) and everyone at the annual holiday party raved about it.  I could barely get a slice for myself!  In conclusion, I could leave the cooling process behind, but I think this will be my cheesecake recipe for many cheesecakes to come.  Yum!

I made this cheesecake for the holidays, followed the recipe exactly as it said and also heeded the advice of many reviewers. I used the water bath on the rack below and let it cool in the oven. Not a single crack, the edges were smooth and it was the most delicious cheesecake I've ever tasted! It was my first attempt at cheesecake and I'll never use another recipe. Kudos to Chantal!!

This doesn't have the smooth, creamy texture of the cheesecakes that I've had in NYC, but it is very good and deserves five stars nonetheless.

I made this recipe twice and it's soooo delicious, everyone was asking for more both times. Very easy to make (thanks to my KitchenAid!) and both times, I let it completely cool in the oven without opening the door and it turned out just perfect, no cracks, no sinking in the middle. This is my staple NY-style cheesecake recipe!!

My very first cheesecake and it came out perfect. Not even a crack and wonderful color - I mixed all the ingredients by hand and i did use the water bath. Next time I will add some lemon juice to the composition. Thanks, great recipe!

My friend made this recipe, but due to inexperience (and not reading the recommendations on this site about 'how to bake a cheesecake' we used cold ingredients (always use ingredients at roomtemperature) and overmixed everthing. The taste was good but it cracked and sinked.. our mistake. We will try this again definately.

Followed the recipe as written. Baked in a water bath and did not open the oven door for about 5 hours. No cracks, beautiful light yellow top, as smooth as silk. Added a cherry topping. Took it to work the next day and many said it was as good as any cheesecake they ever had. Fantastic!!

I adapted this cheesecake recipe to make a peanut butter cheesecake for my husband. I added 1 cup creamy peanut butter, and extra 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and 5 snickers bars. It made a very rich, dense cheesecake that my husband has declared to be the bar by which all other cheesecakes will be judged. Great recipe!

I made this for father's day over my husband's "concerns" it would be too heavy in the hot weather.  Boy was he wrong eating two pieces himself.  I topped it with kiwi and fresh strawberries and it was just sweet enough and "not" heavy at all.

SUPER!!!! I always stayed away from cheesecake because I thought it would be too difficult.  Not with this recipe.  I used a store bought crust and followed the recipe.  The next time I'll cut some calories by substituting half of the cream cheese with 2 low fat blocks.

I make a dessert every Sunday night for my husband to take to a pot-luck barbeque at work.  Yesterday I decided to make this cheesecake.  Usually my husband will leave any leftover dessert at work for the next shift to enjoy, but this morning I found half of the cheesecake in the fridge.  I was concerned that maybe everyone didn't like it and that's why he brought it home, but when I asked him about it, he said that it was the best dessert I had made so far.  One of the people he works with is a lover of cheesecake and she said it was the best cheesecake she has ever had.  He brought it home so our family can enjoy it too!  I made a strawberry topping to go with it and it all worked out deliciously.  I was so happy that they had all liked it that I had to try it for myself and ended up having a piece for breakfast! LOL.  Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have whole graham crackers, so I used the recipe of the graham cracker crumb box to make the crust.  It all worked out perfectly.  I am very pleased with how well it turned out.  I can't wait til I have a reason to make it again!

I followed this recipe to the letter.  Too much vanilla for me.  I would cut it in half.  I didn't use a water bath and it craked REALLY bad.  The texture, however, was great.  Will try again using 1/2 the vanilla and a water bath.

This was divine. My whole family loved it and could not get enough!!

I baked it at 335 degrees with a cake pan of boiling water under it. I used a 10" springform. I tuned the oven off after 70 minutes and left it in a closed oven for over 8 hours. There wasn't one crack.

 The recipe says 15 grahms, and I wasn't sure whether 1 grahm cracker means 4 rectangles or all 8. I used all 8 and it seemed like too much. I had to double the butter in the crust. It still turned out fine.

I also didn't put in the full 1/4 cup flour, but close to it.

I used milk to 1/3 cup and the rest w/ heavy cream.

I topped it with a raspberry sauce that was excellant!!!

Thanks for a great recipe!

Being from the UK i can't get graham crackers so for the base of this excellent cheesecake i uesd McVities Digestive biscuits and they worked fine.This is a wonderful cake it tastes great.I used toffee sauce and black cherry pie filling on top of some of the slices and had the rest of it without anything on it and whatever way you eat this it  tastes wonderful thanks for a great recipe.

This cheesecake turned out perfectly!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and WOW  what a hit!  Everyone loved it and my company said it was the best cheesecake they had had.  Usually when I make a cheesecake they end up with cracks, but this one didn't have a single one.  I served it with a strawbery sauce off this site.  Delicious!!

I followed the recipe exactly.  Perfect cheesecake.  My wife said it was the best she has ever had.  Definitely better than any store bought.  I may add a little more flour to make it a little firmer.

I made this for Thanksgiving, everyone LOVED it.  I added a 1/2 cup of blackberry sauce to it and created a marbled effect.  Then I poured more of it over each piece before serving.  Delicious.

This was the first time I ever baked a cheesecake.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful.  It was very large and had no cracks.  I baked it on the top rack and put a pan of water under it.  I will use this recipe over and over again!! Thanks!!!!

My husband made this cheesecake and we both agree.  This tastes exactly like a New York Cheesecake should...even better!  We baked at 350 with shallow pan of water under on the bottom rack...cake was on the rack above.  This kept the cake moist and no cracks.

The BEST! This was my first cheesecake and it not only turned out perfect (No Cracks), it saved my Christmas dinner. My wifes grandmother, who was a cook her entire life said it was the best cheesecake she ever had! I followed the recipie exactly. The only thing I did different was to put an additional pan in the oven under the cheesecake with approx 1" of water in it. after the cheesecake was done baking I left it in the oven an additional 5 hours before removing it. Thanks for this wonderful recipie.

Wonderful cheesecake!  I followed the suggestions of others and reduced the flour to 2 tablespoons.  I used a water bath and left the cheesecake in the oven for a full 6 hours after baking and it was perfect--no cracks, with a smooth and creamy texture.  I now know why it has received so many 5 star ratings -- this one is a keeper!

ABSOLUTELY the best cheesecake I've ever made! Mine did crack while cooling in the oven, but I just covered the crack with my cherry fruit topping and then the problem was solved! This recipe takes a long time to make, but it is well worth the wait! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I use this more than any cheesecake recipe I own. It goes with any combination of toppings and variations. It's just what you want to taste when you eat cheesecake. I think I've only had it split on me once out of about 12 or more times.

The recipe was solid, but it turned out too cakey for my tastes.  Also, to prevent splitting, I greased the sides of the pan and stuck strips of parchment paper along the sides.  They were wrinkled by the time the cake was all done, but they didn't take away from the appearance at all, and they peeled right off -- no splits!

I think the oven timing is way off on this and the setting may be to high.  Too many cracks and the center sunk down.  The appearance was not very attractive, but it taste okay.

This recipe was beyond excellent. It was light and melted in your mouth. My entire family loved it. Some said it was the best they ever tasted. Mine cracked. I assume it was because I only left it in the oven for a few hours not 6 or 7. I put chocolate shavings to hide the crack which was beautiful. The kids even loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

I've never dreamt about baking a cheesecake until I saw this recipe. I tried baking cakes few years back but none of them a successful 1. I just can't discrib the excitement that I had when I had the first bite on the cheesecake. It's like a miracle!! After the first trial I was cofident enough to bake another 1 with variation, & it was for my relative's birthday. Everyone said it's so delicious.

This was excellent. I baked it in a water bath and left it in the oven for at least 4 hours after cooking. It did not crack. I served mine with a rhubarb sauce that I made from frozen rhubarb. The sweet tartness was absolutely delicious with the creamy cheesecake! Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe! I have made this 3 or 4 times now and everyone loves it. To avoid cracking (since it did the first time) I used room temperature ingredients and avoided aver beating. This is a better cheescake than I can buy. Thanks.

I tried this recipe first and like it very much, and then I tried another one....it didn't even compare to the taste of this one.  I am about to make it again, I learned the last time don't overfill my pan, and I put some in a spare pan.

If this recipe had 10 stars, I'd give it! I use 19 graham crackers and a whole stick of butter for the crust. I also keep the oven temp at 325. I always use the waterbath, and it turns out just right. After my first time making this cheesecake, I was forced to be the dessert supplier on special occasions. Only, they want this cheesecake! I am now obligated to make it for all family holidays. This is the most delicious, perfect cheesecake that I have ever had. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

I adjusted the temp on the oven as one reviewer suggested and this was the best cheesecake ever. I used to own a pastry cafe in Scottsdale and this beat our cheesecakes hand down. No cracks. Wonderful receipe.

This is my third time making this recipe and it gets better every time.  I had no cracks this time and I attribute it to the ingredients all being at room temperature.  Rather than a water bath I put in a jelly roll pan full of water on the shelf below my cheesecake while baking. My cheesecake got rave reviews at Christmas dinner!  YUMMY!!

Thank you so much!! This is my first cheesecake experience, and WOW!! Everyone was so impressed. My husband is a very honest critic when I cook, as I experiment alot and he knows I will make it again unless he tells me the truth!! He said it honestly tasted better than the cheesecake factory. He said he was really expecting it to taste bad, for my first try, or have cracks galore in it. WHICH IT DIDN"T!!! 
Also, my 12 year old normally puts tons of strawberries or cherry pie filling on top, after she tasted it, she didn't want any on top, she said she loved it just the way it was! So, this recipe is a keeper! thanks for sharing!!

I understand this isn't supposed to be an authentic "new york" style because of the crust and all.... but regardless it got rave reviews when I brought it to a party recently.  Everyone was demanding the recipe afterwards!!  I thought it was the perfect texture, not too creamy and not too dry... plus not too sweet.  I haven't tried it yet, but I'm sure it's great with any fruit topping!!

Delicious!  This was my first cheesecake and I was a little initimidated after reading some of the prior reviews.  I had all ingredienta at room temp, and didn't use a water bath (just a pan of hot water on bottom oven rack) but the cake cracked anyway.  I planned on covering with cherries so it wasnt a big deal.  I used the graham crackers/cinnamon/sugar/nutmeg recipe that I saw posted earlier and will definitely be making again!  The crust was perfect...I did bake it 1st for 15 minutes/350 degrees before I put in the filling.  Great recipe!! Thanks!

I changed some of the ingredients to be a little more health conscious.  I changed to fat free cream cheese, lowfat sour cream, reduced fat graham crackers for the crust.  I added a crushed oreo topping and drizzled it with some Nutella.  It was amazing!!!

This cheesecake makes you look like a gourmet chef!  Try adding chocolate chips, or chocolate swirls and a dusting of cocoa at the end!  Your friends will drool!

Absolutely fabulous!  I am a displaced New Yorker now in North Carolina.  Deli's are non-existent along with any type of good northern cuisine.  Made this recipe and it was a winner.  I did wrap the bottom of the pan in tin foil and use a water bath, however, the water leaked into the pan.  The cake was a little soft on the bottom, but nonetheless was loved by all!  Next time I will omit the water bath since the top cracked anyway.  Thank you for a winner!

I have tried almost every speciality cheesecake recipe out there, but this is the best.  Sometimes less IS more!  I used a round of parchement paper and greased the sides really well...this, and having room temp ingredients, produced a crack-free cake. Served with cherry topping.  Thanks for sharing such a winner.

Wonderful cheesecake!  I made this for Easter and everybody loved it!  I did use a water bath and did not have any cracks at all.  I drizzled warm chocolate and caramel over the top and used a crushed vanilla wafer cookie crust instead of the usual graham cracker.  This one is a keeper!  My family and I thank you, Chantal!

I was given a springform pan two Christmases ago & it was collecting dust. I wanted to try a cheesecake and browsed this website until I decided on this one. I made this for Easter 2004 and brought it to my inlaws. Highly recommended for anyone's first attempt. It turned out good, was perfectly done, and I didn't have to worry about the process. Thanks so much Chantal!

TRULY an excellent tasting cheesecake!  I took it to a party and after all the praise I got, it made me feel like a baking king!  Back of Ms Betty Crocker, that’s all I have to say! 

To add my own flare to it, I added some chopped walnuts to the crust mix and followed the rest of the recipe to a “T”.  Awesome, just awesome!

This recipe was definitely easy.  It was my first ever cheesecake attempt.  I was a bit dissappointed in the consistency.  I LOVE cheesecake but this was, for lack of a better word, like spackle.  It kind of stuck to the roof of my mouth.  It's probably my fault, it was my first attempt.  It DID crack, but that was ok, I was just putting fruit on it and my family would not care as long as it tastes yummy.

I took this to a Bible study and it was gone within 30 mins. Someone told me is tasted like I bought it from a gourmet place. Another said it tasted professional. The only think I did different from the recipe is I only had light sour cream and I used 1/4 almond extract and the rest vanilla. I topped this with sliced strawberries that had a small amount of sugar and soaked overnight. REALLY GREAT!!!

I agree with several other reviewers that if your cheesecake does not taste like the best deli cheesecake you've had then you did not make it right. I've made this recipe for the last 8 years and everyone loves it. It is "My" dish to bring to all the holiday dinners every year! I've used it to make my own modified "flavored" versions as well such as with rasberry swirl, chocolate, and fudge pieces - And it comes out perfect and works with everything. I even made it into pumpkin pie by pretty much mixing a batch of homemade pumpkin pie mixed up just before you'd normally bake it and mixed it into the batch of cheesecake then baked it and voila! Had pumpkin cheesecake. It actually came out much better than any actual "pumpkin pie cheesecake" recipe i've found so far! Thanks Chantal!

The flavor of this cheesecake is great.  It tastes like a true cheesecake should.  Not too thick but thick enough.  Mine did crack but I will just make sure that I followed the recipe fully next time.  Made it last week, am making it next week.  Great recipe.

Great flavor, very rich, and not too horribly sweet. I add cinnamon and chopped walnuts to the crust for a little extra kick. This cake had the perfect texture, but in my 10 3/4 inch dark nonstick springform pan, the outside cooked far too fast while the inside was absolutely perfect, all regardless of using room temperature ingredients and careful mixing. I imagine it would be completely perfect in the proper size pan, if you can perfect the baking times for your own pan and own oven.

Absolutely perfect.  I substituted chopped pecans for about 1/3 of the graham crackers in the crust, and pre-baked the crust for about 10 minutes to ensure a toasted nutty flavor and crispy crust.  I baked the cheesecake with a broiler pan full of hot water on the rack underneath.  Also shortened the baking time.  The center was jiggly after 50 minutes, so I turned off the oven and cracked the door at that point.  The cheesecake cooled in the oven for a couple of hours, and came out perfect:  no cracks, and a delicious creamy texture.

This was a good cheesecake.  If you have tried REAL NY Cheesecake and you like it, then this recipe is what you want to make.  If you are a more the I-make-mine-from-the-box type of cheesecake lover, then you might not like this one as "regular" cheesecake has more of a light and fluffy texture, this is thick and dense and not as sweet.  I really like it but an 8th of a sliver is plenty for me!

I tried this cheesecake for a Christmas party and everyone said it was the best cheesecake they had ever eaten.  It is very delicious and had a great texture.  I baked two at the same time--one in a regular springform pan and the other in a black coated springform pan.  The regular springform turned out perfectly--no cracks--the black coated springform pan absorbed too much heat and cooked too hot and made a large crack in the top (but it still tasted great!)  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will use this recipe all the time for making cheesecake.

This is the one recipe I come back to this site for, again and again!  I've come back at least 5 times for this recipe, and it has never disappointed me.  Every time I serve this, everyone at the party fights for who gets to take the last couple of slices home!  Chantal, you discovered the secrets of the cheesecake served in all of the best restaurants, bravo!

I must add, that because of a friend of mine that is allergic to gluten, I was able to make changes to this recipe and have it still come out perfect.  I substituted a small pack (about 6oz) of gluten free chocolate chip cookies, crushed in the bag, for the crust, and about 2 and 1/2 tablespoons of rice flour for the all purpose flour.  I couldn't taste a difference in the cheesecake when I made it.

(Added Aug 28, 2008):  Let me give you a hint if the cheesecake cracks: chocolate ganache.  There are recipes on this site, but you can also make a simple one with 8 oz of whipping cream and 8 oz of semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips.  Pour the chips into a good-sized mixing bowl, set aside.  Heat the cream to just boiling and then pour into the chocolate chips.  Stir until the chips are melted and consistency is uniform.  Immediately pour onto the cheesecake, making sure to not spill any over the sides.  Let it cool in the fridge for at least 8 hours.  Et Voila, no one knows it cracked.

My husband and his family LOVE cheesecake and they all say this is the best they've ever had. I now make it for all special occasions, even thanksgiving! I do add juice and zest of 1 or 2 lemons, double the crust and add a sour cream top (16 oz sour cream, 1 T sugar, 1 t vanilla,  beat, pour on top and bake last 10 minutes.

I made and donated 34 cheesecakes using this recipe for a black tie gala; people who don't 'like' cheesecake were complimenting the quality of this cake and told me they scraped their plates clean. It is one recipe that is definately worth taking the time to make.

This cheesecake came out perfectly.  I left it in the oven for 4 hours after baking, and then refrigerated it for a day.  The only thing that I added was a little more melted butter to the graham cracker crust to make it less crumbly.  Thank you for the great recipe Chantal.

The cheesecake was AMAZING! (Not that you need me to tell you that) I only wanted to make a smaller sized cake (approx 4.5") so I used approx. 1/4 of all the suggested portions and baked it at 270 degrees (130 degrees celcius) for abt 30 mins, left it in the oven for 1 hour. Chilled overnight. Turned out perfectly.

Might bake it for longer next time (I like it to look a little bit browner) but otherwise, absolutely perfect!

My family loved this because it wasn't too sweet and too rich (unlike a lot we've eaten) and most of all, they were shocked that I (beginner in baking) could come up with something which tasted like it was bought from the store. I usually halve the filling. Thank you ever so much Chantel, this is the only recipe I'll ever use for cheesecake.

at first i was a little apprehensive about baking this cake as i'm a disaster in the kitchen. but everyone loved the cheesecake and i'm definitely going to make this again!! it's not only easy to make, but it also looks like the cakes you see in cafes!! but instead of using graham crackers (as i couldnt find it in the supermarts), i used shortbread instead but it still turned out wonderful, although it may turn out slightly sweeter.

This is the best cheesecake I have ever had anywhere! I got distracted while cooking and forgot to add the flour, it was still firm, yet creamy.  I took the suggestions of others and used 1 1/2 C. graham cracker crumbs and 4 T. butter plus I added about 3 T. sugar.  It was awesome. I baked mine in a water bath for 1 hour and 10 min. (my oven tends to take longer) and left it alone for 4 hours, chilled overnight, and can't stay away from it.  SEROUISLY... I've been looking for the perfect cheesecake recipe to make on my husband's birthday, and here it is!!!

Can you freeze this?  On a whim I tried this recipe (without the crust) several weeks ago, and it was huge hit at work.  I would like to make it again, but even cutting the recipie in half a whole cake, is a little too much for just me and my husband - this time around we aren't sharing with others!!!

THE BEST - THE BEST - THE BEST
So easy and absolutely every person at the dinner party raved.  I put the bowl of water in the oven as recommended and left it to cool in the oven for 5 hours and it came out just as good as any fancy restaurant or deli.

This cake turned out great! I changed a few things though. I used cinnimon graham crackers and i added about 1 tbs of sugar to the crust, yum the crust turned out yummy! The only two flaws that I ran into making the cake was that I only had to bake it for 40 mins, an hour would have burnt it! And I also had alot of the batter left so I made the leftover batter into tiny cupcakes and everyone at work loved them! Thanks for the great recipe! it was so yummy! (oh, and I didn't use a springform pan and it still came out great!)

This cheesecake was very delicous, and deserves more than 5 stars.  It should at least be in the Hall of Fame.  The texture was perfect: creamy yet firm.  The sweetness was perfect too.  I used digestive biscuits for the crust.

I didn't have a springform pan, so I used a regular rectangular baking pan, and placed it inside a bigger pan filled with water.  The steam produced is supposed to prevent cracking.  Also, right after baking, I took a knife and cut around the edges of cake so that the cake would not stick to the edge of the pan while contracting, prevening cracks.  Finally, I left the cake in for one hour with the oven door closed, then left it in the oven with the door open for one hour, and let it cool until it was room temp., and then put it in the fridge overnight.  All that work paid off, the cake had no cracks!

Wow!  This is amazingly easy to make even when our 120v mixer got fried by Hong Kong's 220v power.  I can proudly say that this is the best cheesecake I've ever tasted in ASIA!  They just have no clue.....

great recipe with a couple minor additions. i changed the crust recipe so there would be enough to line the sides of the pan- 25 graham crackers crushed with 6 tbsp of butter. I added a bit of lemon zest to the batter for flavor, and baked in a water bath to prevent cracks. also, for a beautiful presentation, i marbled the top of the cheesecake by melting down semisweet and white chocolate (separately) in a double boiler.

I made this cheesecake to bring to someone's house.  We all loved it.  One person said, this is the best cheesecake he has ever had.  I partially sliced two strawberries (not cutting them thru to the stem) and fanned them, making a flower in the center of the cheesecake, then lined the outer rim of the cheesecake with halved strawberries.  It was not only delicious, but pretty too.  I have been making cheesecake for years -- many different kinds.  This one is at the top of my list.  Thanks so much Chantal for a wonderful recipe.

Yummy, yummy yummy! Very smooth cheescake! I had never made one before and suceeded! Super easy, mine did crack on top, but I am not one who's picky if it tastes GREAT! Highly recommended! I didn't have a real mixer, just one of the old-school hand crank kind from my grandma and it still turned out perfectly.

Beautiful cheesecake!  This turned out great with only one crack that was barely noticable.  I did not bake it in a water bath, but put a roasting pan with water in a pan right below it.  I also made a strawberry glaze and added some strawberry slices to the top.  I will definitely make again!

This was AWESOME!  I made it for my husband's birthday.  He loves cheesecake but is very, very, VERY picky about what cheesecake he likes.  He loved this one!  We ate on it for a week.  I followed the recipe exactly, but baked in a water bath.  It did not crack and was beautiful.  We ate it with Caramel Sauce drizzled on top.  Yummy!  Thank you Chantal!

My daughter asked for Blueberry cheesecake for her birthday so I picked this recipe out for the base filling. I'm glad I did! It was so delicious! Creamy and smooth but it cracked awfully even though I followed the base recipe and left it in the oven nearly all day. It did not hurt the taste and nobody really cared. I used frozen, defrosted, drained berries dusted with flour. The flour keeps the berries from bleeding and turning a beautiful cheesecake into a brown ugly mess. I sprinkled the berries over 1/2 the filling then poured the rest over. I added a T. of fresh lemon juice to the filling because we enjoy a tart cheesecake and it complimented the berries very well. Several people said it was the best cheesecake they had eaten in years! Oh, I used a 10 inch springform pan and it filled it up! Thank you! I will make this again for sure!!

This cheesecake is amazing.  I can't wait to make it again.
I think that two tablespoons of butter is not quite enough for the crust--I ended up using about 4.  
Other than that the recipe was a complete success.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  Thank you Chantal!  I made it exactly the way the recipe stated except I used the crust recipe that another reviewed suggested that uses chopped pecans and nutmeg; it came out delicious!  I had my neighbors over for dessert and coffee and they raved about it all night long!  I also made a raspberry sauce for the top which really put the "icing on the cake"! Highly recommended :o)

WOW! First try, perfect results...I even used neufchatel cheese, and substituted some yogurt for missing sour cream. Perfect texture when baked at 325 degrees for 60 minutes.  I then left it in the oven overnight.  Perfect.

Delicious cheesecake.  The first time I made it without reading reviews -- it was delicious, but it cracked, and the texture wasn't quite right.  The second time, I followed the AllRecipes suggestions and the cake did not crack and has a nice, smooth texture.  I baked for 325 for about 80 minutes, then left for 2 hours in the oven and it is still just a bit soft in the middle (but awesome).  HOWEVER, I will never try the water bath again with a spring form pan.  I wrapped very carefully and the water still got in around the edges.  It doesn't seem to have badly affected the cheesecake, though.  I will try using the pan of water on the rack underneath next time.  Thanks for "my" new recipe!!

One of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted much less made!!  I followed some of the other reveiwers' advice and cooked it at 325 for one hour.  I also made sure everything was at room temperature before starting and used a water bath.  To top the cake, I bought strawberry pie filling at the supermarket, put it in the blender and pureed it to make a glaze for some color.  I put it over the cake after it had cooled for about an hour (still in the warm oven).  Afterward, I melted some dark chocolate morsels and drizzled chocolate over the top... SUPERB!  I'm making this one again tonight :)

This cheesecake was WONDERFUL!!!  I love cheesecake and this is by far the best one!!  It definately is as good or better than most restaurants.  Easy to make and very tasty and creamy!!  A few relatives also tasted it and said it was the best they'd ever had.

I did the water bath and only left it in the oven for about 3 hours then to the fridge.  It did not crack.  I also used all room temp ingr.  I will definately make this agai1n.

Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I have to say this was my first cheese cake and it was a HUGE success. This recipe is very easy to follow and make a wonderful lite cheese cake. Not a slice was left. When I told my husband that I was making this cheese cake he said that no one made a better cheese cake then his mom. So I thought I'd give it a shot....My husband now says MY cheesecake is the best and he wants me to give the recipe to his mom!! Thumbs up Chantal!

So very yummy! Cake has a great texture and delicate taste. Next time I may experiment with different crusts b/c graham is so done - but otherwise very very good and highly recommended. Everyone wants the recipe!

Excellent!  I made this for my husbands birthday.  He loves cheesecake and said this was the best he has ever had.  I too used the water bath method and kept it in the oven for just 45 minutes due to time constraints and it turned out perfectly and did not crack.  I would recommend not serving until completely chilled otherwise the cheescake is a bit soft.

I was very nervous making this cheesecake for the first time for a large family gathering.  It was the easiest recipe to follow and the most delicious cheesecake that I have ever made by far.  I got so many compliments that I am making another one this weekend. I have tried so many recipes over the years...they don't beat this recipe.  The key is to turn the oven off on time.  The cheesecake doesn't look done but it will finish setting up in the oven.  Doing that creates a super creamy cheesecake. Otherwise it overbakes and gets dry and crumbly.

This was the easiest and most delicious cheesecake recipe I have found.  EVERYONE I offer it to asks for another slice.  I like that it doesn't have cottage cheese- which I can't ever seem get the lumps out of- to make it look smooth and taste creamy.  It's a great find!  Thank You!

I made this for Christmas last year... Im just really slow at following up with the rating :( sorry.

This was really good and I plan on making two again this year one will go back to work with me and one for the kids.

They all loved it and several girls at work ask for   "my" recipe HEHE (yep I told them it wasn't really mine and handed over the recipe and the name of this site :)

Thanks for the recipe, I enjoyed it and will use it again!

WOW!!!  I have never before in my life made cheesecake before and this came out great!!!  I didn't have have enough eggs, so I only used three and no electrical appliances, i.e mixer, so it was hard labor but well worth the work and the wait.  I didn't have a springform pan (was debating if I should buy one) so I used pie pans and the recipe yielded two of those with a little extra graham crackers for the crust.  And the beauty of it all is it stayed together when I removed the slices from the pan!!! Super!!

Great texture and taste, lowered temp like a few others and of course used the water bath... it baked fine, but in cooling sank and ended up with 3 massive cracks.  Still tasted great but ended up having to make another dessert in a pinch for company.  Never had this happen on a cheesecake so I am not sure what to make of it.  Just thought I'd give a new cheesecake recipe a shot.  Will attempt again with better results hopefully.  If anyone has any ideas?!?!

I made this with the ready crust and it came out great.  It tasted so good and just like the deli kind.  It did crack though but it didn't take away from the taste.

This is my first chesscake and i find that it is very easy to make but the most important is that everyone of my family also said its wonderful....my father and cousin even said it is better than the one I brought from the hotel....that's great.  I follow all instrustion there and lucky I found no crash.  However, 1 hour is too short for baking and my cheesecake has no brown color on the edge and the center of the cake is so creamy.  Also, the batter is too much but lucky my 9-inch tin can just enough to fill in.  I serve it with sour cream and strawberry sauce.  Its really taste good.  And I will do it again this week.

This was the best recipe for cheesecake. Super easy to make. Worth every calorie! Just like the cheesecake you get in the deli's in New York City!

This recipe was great!  I made it for father's day and my Dad LOVED it, he wanted to eat the whole, cake, my grandfather was in disbelief when he asked what bakery she got it from, and she said I had made it!  I am making it again this week!!  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and it was the best!  I also used honey maid grahm cracker crumbs instead of 15 crackers, recipe on the box, it makes an excellent crust!

While the flavor was very good, I only rated it three stars because of the huge cracks that developed.  I made this for my husband to take to a potluck at work and I almost didn't send it because it looked so terrible.

I've made hundreds of cheesecakes and had small cracks show up now and then, but NOTHING like the crater in the middle of this cake.  It opened up like the San Andreas fault.

Seeing as how my chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake and my snickers cheesecake always come out without cracks, I have to think that some adjustment could be made to this recipe to prevent such ugly cracks from forming.

I doubt I'll take the chance of making this one again.

This recipe was easy and tasted GREAT, but it cracked even after leaving it in the oven overnight.  Maybe it was because the center did not bake after only an hour in the oven.  I'll still try this one again because it tasted good, but maybe bake it longer in a water bath and then remove it from the oven to cool.

I have been making cheesecake for years using the same recipe. NOT ANYMORE!!!!! This is my new recipe. I made it tonight for a birthday party. It is super easy to make. It came out perfect!  No CRACKS, lightly browned around edges, it looked like a picture and it tasted divine! It was the best cheesecake I have every made. Thanks Chantal! It is a wonderful recipe.

This cheesecake is the best I've ever made! My husband used to visit the Bronx in New York City and buy cheesecake from a bakery there, and he has been raving about that darn cheesecake ever since. I have baked many cheesecakes trying to duplicate the one he had many years ago in N.Y. City. Thank you Chantal, I've finally done just that with your recipe. The only things I changed is the crust. I used the recipe on the box of Honey Maid graham cracker crumbs. I also baked it 30 minutes longer than the recipe called for. I cooled it in the oven for only 3 hours, and on a rack outside the oven for a few more hours. This is the first cheesecake I've baked that didn't crack. I am throwing all my other cheesecake recipes away and making only this one in the future. Thank you so much Chantal!

This recipe was easy to make, and although there was a slight crack on top it didn't detract from the look of the cheesecake.

Everyone seemed to enjoy this cheesecake, but the fact that there is still half of it left after it has been sitting in the fridge all day tells it's own story.

I'm a bit of a cheesecakeaholic and usually people have to keep their extremities well away from my mouth if I'm eating cheesecake. Not so with this offering. 

All in all this cheesecake seems to be rather bland.

I think I will make it again sometime, but next time I will serve it with a chocolate or fruit topping.

This was a good recipe, but letting it cool in the oven didn't help me.  It had a crack the size of a canyon down the center.  We didn't put any toppings on it, but maybe it could have used a side of blueberries or something.

This is the most delicious cheesecake I have ever made.  I made it for my family on (Canadian) Thanksgiving and they are still raving about it months later.  To allow for variety I put toppings on the table instead of on the cheesecake.  The options made it even more pleasant since they were able to have what pleased THEIR palate.

Made this for Christmas.  I was the best cheesecake we have ever eaten.  I made it late at night and left it in the oven until morning.  Then chilled it until mid-day.  It was beautiful no cracks at all.  Was the hit of all of the desserts.

I made this for my mom's birthday, and everyone loved it!  I used a different crust though, and since my grandma doesn't eat eggs, i substituted 1 Tbs custard powder for each egg, and it held together well.  Although it had a crack at the top, I topped it off with strawberries and whipped cream and it looked and tasted fabulous!  For those who do not have a springform pan, I don't think it's a problem, because the filling was too much to fit in my springform pan, so i just made some extra crust and used a regular nonstick pan for the excess, and it wasn't a problem to remove the cake from the pan.  Excellent recipe Chantal!!!

I followed the recipe and it was simple.  The cheesecake turned out delicious, and everyone that tasted it enjoyed it. I thought one hour in the oven was excessive, and I was unable to prevent the cheesecake from cracking. I will have to work on that one. Nevertheless, this cheesecake is wonderful.

I HAD TO MAKE THIS DESSERT FOR THANKSGIVING.  (IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I WAS MEETING THE IN- LAWS).  ALL I CAN SAY IS AMAZING.  THE CRUST WAS A BIT SOGGY, BUT NO ONE NOTICED, BECAUSE THE CHEESECAKE WAS SO TASTY. I DID PUT THE CHEESECAKE IN A WATERBATH, AND I ALSO ADDED A DISHCLOTH TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ROASTING PAN.  I LEFT THE CHEESECAKE IN THE OVEN, AND HAD NO PROBLEM WITH CRACKING OR A DARKENED TOP.  I WILL BE MAKING THIS FOR CHRISTMAS AGAIN.  NEEDLESS TO SAY THE FAMILY LOVES ME... AND I GUESS THE CHEESECAKE.  THANKS CHANTAL

Excellent cheesecake!  I took it to a luncheon and people were assuming it was store-bought!  One lady said she was a cheesecake expert and said it was the best she'd ever had!  I did the water bath and baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, then lowered the temp to 300 for 50 minutes, cooling in the oven for 5 hours.  No cracks, no browning at all!  The only flaw I had was that I poured my vanilla on top of the unmixed flour, resulting in brown clumps that wouldn't blend in.  Otherwise it was perfect. I used a different crust:  1 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup melted marg, 1/4 cup sugar. Thanks Chantal!

Chantel: this was the best NY style cheesecake I have ever tasted. The recipe was easy, and the cake came out like I bought it at a store, no cracks, LOOKED PERFECT. My family loved it, now it will be one of my recipes for holidays and special occassions. I live in NY and you can't buy a cheese cake like this anywhere.

Wonderful, better than any store bought I've had.  Several have complained about
the crust -- for a twist, the next time you bake drop cookies, save a few, freeze and
crumble and use instead of graham crackers.  I tried this once and it was very
well received!

I use this recipe when I make cheesecake for the other teachers and staff at my school.  It is extremely easy to make and lends itself to simple additions, like mini chocolate chips!  I highly recommend this recipe.  Everyone who trys it loves it!

Followed directions yet it cracked very badly, which is usually due to overcooking but I think 6 hrs in the oven is too long.  Take out earlier next time?  Time consuming because of oven requirement.  Texture, taste and crust were good, but not great.

This cheese cake is delicious.  Unfortunately, allowing it to cool in the oven means that you must make sure that you will not need to bake anything the rest of the day.

I really liked this cheesecake, with the exception of the crust.  It didn't have enough butter to hold it together and it needs some sugar added.  The cheesecake portion was delicioius, but find a different crust recipe to use.

Very easy, you just need to prepare in advance so that you can let it sit in the oven 5 or 6 hours.  But worth the wait.  It tasted great.  This was the first cheesecake I had ever attempted and I was very impressed!  I will definately use this recipe again!

This is the BEST cheesecake I have ever tasted. I made it for New Year's Eve 2000 and everyone that tried it, loved it. My husband and I can't get enough. I might have to make another just for ourselves.

The only problem in making it is that it cracked badly although I followed the directions about leaving it in the oven (turned off) for five hours. However, it could have been that I had to hand mix it since my mixer broke while making it.

This is my first time making a NY style cheesecake.  I read a number of the reviews and followed most of the recommendations and it came out beautifully.  The only thing I had an issue with was getting all of the cream cheese to incorporate smoothly. It remained a bit lumpy.  I greased the pan well, put a pan of water on the oven rack about an inch below the rack that held the cake pan, baked it for 1 hr at 350 degrees and after the hour I took a plastic knife and separated the cake from the cake pan. I then left it in the oven to cool for about 2 hours. The cake was very loose in the middle after the hour of baking and solidified after the 2 hrs cooling in the oven.  It seems like using the knife to cut around the edge worked because when I took it out of the oven the cake had pulled away from the pan by about 1/2 inch and the cake did not crack at all. I  removed the pan sides and then put in the fridge overnight. In the morning I used a piece of dental floss to remove it from the bottom of the pan.  I added a few tsp of sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to the graham crackers for flavor as suggested by some.
I didn't use the flour and replaced some of the milk with about 1/4 c of Kahlua.  I really appreciate all the suggestions that people make to adjust a recipe or to help with technique, without completely changing it.  All recipes can be a good base and this one came out beautifully. I haven't eaten this yet because it's a gift but I'll update w

This cake is very good. The people I've had taste test it loved it. There are only a few things I would like to point out during my experience make it. 
Last weekend was my first attempt at ever making cheese cake. I followed this very easy recipe double and triple checking I was following every step. It came out terrible. The edges were burnt, cracked and it was so sunken in. I let it cool of and it when right into the trash. 
I decided to make some adjustments. I had been worried that the instruction say to keep the cake in the oven while it cools for 5-6 hours because I though this would over bake the cake. And in my case I think that's what happened. My oven took long to cool down and it ended up cooking it even further to the point of drying out cause it to pull so much from the sides and crack. 
My second attempt at the cake was much better. I followed the same recipe, cooked for the same amount of time but after the hour cook time I moved the cake from my top oven to my bottom oven. I think this helped drastically over all. My cake still cracked. but on a tiny bit in the middle. And the edged where a little more browned then I wanted but that's just cosmetic. I shared the cake with some friends and they all loved it. 
I'll be making this cake again with a few more changes to the cooking and cooling process.
*This is no way an attack on this recipe. If it worked for others then obviously it works and its good. I wanted to share my experience with this recipe and I just

This recipe was easy to follow, turned out to be the best cheese cake I ever made. I substitute the milk with condensed milk and it tasted amazing. I didn’t do the topping I just put fresh strawberries and blueberries with a drizzle of condensed milk.

Excellent results! I’m a total nube at baking. I read probably 25 reviews with tips and variations. I followed the recipe for the cheesecake exactly, including using a mixer for the entire mix as the video shows. (I did use a different recipe for the graham cracker crust with sugar and more butter.) I used the water bath and left the cake in the oven for 5 hours (impatient) and left in the refrigerator for 24 hours before taking out of the pan. No cracks, and excellent texture. I may not have a refined cheesecake palate, but my family and I thought it was fantastic!

OK so I did this recipe exactly and I was excited about it. looked good going in oven. I made sure to grease the sides like suggested and not open oven door for 5 hours after I turned off oven. what an ugly thing when I opened door! 3 giant cracks in center and edges were brown. haven't tried it yet but the battery tasted good before baking. maybe cause my cream cheese was cold? I don't know but it will be awhile before I make again as this was expensive to make.

It was overcooked even after shaving 10 minutes off the overall baking time.The amount of sour cream was overpowering and when baking that long it left it a strange texture. But it didn't crack! My search for the perfect NY Cheesecake continues.

love it every time. I follow the recipe.  I prefer adding real vanilla, the inside of the bean itself.  I follow the recipe and it always comes out amazing.  I see all the reviews that add this or subtract that. I just followed the recipe.  using vanilla bean. I add homemade lilikoi butter

Tastes fabulous.  I did leave it in the oven as directed and it cracked almost to the crust.  Will need to research a different technique, but the recipe itself is spot-on delicious!  (just saw another review that mentions possible overbeating the ingredients can cause it to crack- I do think I mixed this quite a bit)

Good recipe.  I have not baked a cheese cake in 5 years. This recipe worked well.  Added fresh lemon juice and rind to batter.  A dash of ginger and cinnamon  to crust.  Topped with lemon curd after baked.  Very pleased with results and husband agreed.

Fantastic recipe! I’ve made it as is, or with 50/50 graham cracker and ginger snap cookie crust for a little extra zing. My whole family loves this cheesecake and begs me to make it for special occasions or just because. I always do mine the evening before we want to eat it. I am sure to put a pan of water in the oven with the cheesecake to keep it moist and help prevent cracking on the top. Don’t over mix the batter. As others have suggested, I bake mine for 60 minutes and then just turn the oven off and leave it overnight. Don’t crack the door. Don’t check to see if it’s set! Just leave it alone. I get up in the morning and put it in the fridge to chill.

This cheesecake is amazing!  my family congratulated me after trying it, lol.  Mine did crack, but that's because I didn't leave it in the oven to cool as I needed to use the oven.  it was fine though, still tasted delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Followed directions and the cheesecake was great. Very rich and creamy. Only issue was it cracked so next time I’ll use a water bath.

If you want to know how to fix a cracked top and brown top edges then read on! 

This was my first time making a cheesecake and it was a success! However, I did run into some problems making this cheesecake so I thought I would share how I fixed them.  I did not let my cream cheese come to room temperature so the batter didn’t look really smooth, which then led me to over mixing the batter to compensate.  This led to a cracked top in the middle in the end (will share how I fixed it).  The other issue was my oven at 350 was too hot (going to do it at 300-325 next time) so the cheesecake was dark brown on the sides and around the edges on top.  It didn’t look that great.  What to do you asked? Well after I let it rest in the refrigerator for 6 hours I took it out and first carved out the brown edges on top.  This worked for me since the edges of my cheesecake was higher then the middle. I just made it all even. Then I got a metal cake spatula and a cup of hot water the one you use to put icing on a cake.  It has to be metal. Then you dip the spatula in the hot water to warm it up and then you wipe the spatula with a towel to dry and press gently on the cracked area and watch it disappear.  My crack was pretty big so that took sometime. Then I just did the same with the cut edges and the cheesecake looked much better at the end.  I covered with fresh fruit and powder sugar and it looked great! (see picture)  You can search on youtube repairing cracks in cheesecake and the first

Made exactly as recipe stated. Did not like the crust at all- tasted burnt & ruined the taste of the cheesecake, which was overall good. This cheesecake did come out very pretty though- no cracks at all, but wouldn't make again without changing the crust

This cheesecake is a winner every time!!! It's so creamy, thick, and delicious. Every one raves about it every time I make it! The only thing I do differently is cook it at 325 degrees instead of 350. It always comes out perfect!

I've been making this recipe for years. If you do just leave it alone for 5 or 6 hours after the 60 minutes, it turns out great. If I'm going to serve with fruit topping, I put some lemon juice in (about 3 tablespoons) . If it's going to be with chocolate or caramel toppings, I leave out the lemon juice.

I have made this recipe for cheesecake many times over the past few years. It is always a hit. The first time, and only the first time, I made this it cracked. My wife suggested a water bath and haven’t had a crack since. Simply wrap springform with foil and place in a larger cake pan with about an inch of water in it. I usually only leave it in the oven for an out or two after initial bake time and haven’t had a problem.

I spoke too soon and rated this recipe badly. My brother and sister in law went crazy for it. It tasted better once chilled to me. I’m willing to admit that I was wrong. This is a good recipe for those who like cheesecake.

Oh my incredible goodness!  I bought a spring-form pan 10 years ago with the intention of learning to make cheesecake and never did.  I took a chance on making it for my family's Christmas and really hoped it turned out good since it was the only dessert.  IT.  WAS.  AMAZING!!  Incredibly creamy all the way through.  Never stuck to the sides or cracked.  Cut in nice neat wedges for serving.  I read several of the reviews to make sure I followed all the tips and incorporated what I thought were the best ideas.  1) reduced flour to 2T instead of 1/4 c.  2)  Made sure cream cheese was to room temperature.  3) Made sure I didn't over-beat -- in fact I hand stirred it all and only until the point of ingredients being blended.  4)  I liberally sprayed the sides and bottom of the pan with cooking spray.  5) I wrapped the bottom of the pan in two layers of foil as instructed and set it in a pan with water in the oven.  This was the most challenging as I didn't have a "pan" big enough.  I used the bottom of my broiler pan and it worked great.  6)  Baked on 225 degrees for 3 hours and 40 minutes.  Then turned off the oven and left it in for another 6 hours with the door cracked.  Then refrigerated for 6+ hours.  Result was a cheesecake of perfection that got rave reviews from all that tried it.  I will be making this again very soon!!

We now call this "the legendary cheesecake" in my family. I have been making it for years and I made it this year for Thanksgiving and my aunt, who is a huge health nut and does not like sweets tried very hard to resist but she caved in and had, not only one slice, but two. 

I am an experienced baker and I will say just follow this recipe and it will be perfect. do not change a thing and do NOT overmix this batter no matter what because that's how cheesecakes get cracked or cave in the middle etc etc. Also just leave it in that oven and no opening just leave it in there. This cheesecake is PERFECT.

This is the BEST cheesecake recipe ever. I get so many compliments every time I make it, and so many “this is the best cheesecake I’ve ever had!”. I get requested to make this for every event I go to. Such an easy recipe, tastes like the perfect cheesecake. The only problem I have is that it cracks every time for me and I have tried a few different techniques, but I always cover the top anyways so that isn’t stopping me from using this recipe every time!

I have made this cheesecake a few times. I haven’t always gotten it crack free but the taste is a big hit. I even subbed a gluten free pancake mix instead of the flour when I was entertaining a celiac. It cracked up quite a bit but the taste was still excellent.

I am very happy with this recipe. I followed the directions and the recommendations on preparation by other reviews and the author of the recipe suggested. A crack-free, creamy, high, level cheesecake was my result. I was skeptical throughout, especially just leaving it in the oven to finish, but I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing I did different was the bottom. I didn't have any Graham crumbs so I used the recipe for chocolate chip cookies from Company's Coming and put some of the raw cookie dough on the bottom and baked as per the recipe.

My husbands favorite cake. I was a bit intimidated with this recipe, not the recipe it self, but by my husbands expectations. LOL Low and behold it turned out perfect. Easy to make for sure. Highly recommend this recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe ! I’ve made it a few times and I think I finally got it just right. Do not open the oven lol! You’ll want to but don’t do it. And when it’s been that temp for a while set it on your counter. If you don’t let it cool all the way before you put in fridge, you’ll get condensation all over it.

Awesome recipe! I am in my 60's and I think I've only made one other cheesecake in my life. Decided to make one for Thanksgiving. My husband is a "cheesecake snob" and said it was truly the best he had ever had! I watched the video and used the baking sheet under the springform pan as shown. I also added a little insurance by placing a 9x13 pan of water under the rack as was suggested in another review. After cooling in the oven and completely cooling in the refrigerator, I had seen a suggestion to dip a butter knife in hot water and go around the inside edge of the springform pan, dipping the knife in water every few inches. It came out perfectly! Very happy to say I would not hesitate to make this again!

This recipe is a now holiday tradition in our family. I have made it numerous times and it comes out great every time. This year, I poured chocolate over the top for a change and it was beautiful.  My family LOVES this cheesecake and I get all the credit, but it's really this recipe. 
A long while back I read somewhere about wrapping the cheesecake pan in tinfoil and placing in a pan of water about 1 inch deep while baking and it will not crack. I began following that information  whenever baking cheesecake and NEVER  have any problems with cracking whatsoever. 
Other than that, I follow the recipe EXACTLY and every time it comes out beautiful and delicious. 
AMAZING RECIPE!!!!

Recipe came out great! Made it two times. Two things I tweaked: doubled the crust and added a water bath. It is important to leave the cheesecake in the oven as instructed to prevent cracking. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

I am giving this low marks because I made it as directed but, it didn’t set in the middle. I was so disappointed to find a runny middle, I am not sure what I might have done wrong, the flavor is very good. Two things, the cracker crumb crust was crumbly. I read after the fact that you should bake a cracker crumb crust 10 mins before adding the filling, that wold have been helpful to know in the recipe. The consistency around the edges is exactly what I was expecting, set and fluffy, but the center was not set. It was creamy and tasted good, but not set like the edges,

This cheesecake made me the star at my last family gathering so now every time there is a get together this cake is requested so up at 4:30am to make it with love for my family this Thanksgiving. This recipe needs nothing. It is perfection. If you change it, you have ruined a perfect NY Style Cheesecake.

The people who failed at this cheese cake have not followed the instructions as printed.
There is NOTHING to adjust! it's as easy as 1-2-3. The problem is that people have their own theory of what a cheese cake should look/taste/feel like. 
This is a great recipe.. and if it failed for you, then you are obviously doing something WRONG! I've been using this recipe for 15 yrs.. never had a crack & I did not use a water bath! So TRY AGAIN!

I left a 4 star rating because I was disappointed that after following the directions exactly and even greasing the pan the cake cracked all down the middle. But the taste and texture are phenomenal!!! Five stars all the way!

This is an amazing cheesecake. Works out perfectly every time. Very creamy and smooth. Everyone loves it, and I get requests for it. I don't vary from the recipe at all. I do not stick it in a "bath" of water though. I actually just put a large pan on the rack below it and add water to that. It creates the steam you need. I let it cook in the oven for an hour, and then I just leave it in there (without opening the door) for the next 5-6 hours. I immediately place it in the fridge from there. I have gotten away with just 3 hours in the oven and it worked out fine, but I prefer the 5-6 hours. My cheesecake has never cracked, and, honestly, I mix the heck out of it with my mixer. I do butter the bottom and the sides of my spring form pan, and I do press the graham cracker crust 1/2 way up the sides of the pan. Sometimes I make my own graham cracker crust, and other times I use the boxed kind.  Honestly, best cheesecake ever!

Absolutely the perfect Cheesecake that can sell for $60.00 at a New York City bakery. If you want a more creamy texture just cut the flour in half or don’t add it at all! This cake is divine!

I’ve made this recipes several times and it comes out great every time! Just follow the directions. Don’t over analyze the recipe. Do not over beat. Turn your mixer on low speed and only blend enough to incorporate the ingredients. This not only makes for a dense cheesecake, but it prevents cracks and over-rising. You can also make this lower carb by using truvia sweetener in place of the sugar. It still tastes great!

I have been making this recipe (with minor tweaking to the crust and technique) for a LONG time and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews. I personally find the crust is a bit bland as is so I add 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, and 1/4 cup sugar to the crushed graham crackers. I leave the filling as is, it's perfect. I don't usually get cracks but I utilize a few tips not mentioned in the recipe (using a water bath, using room temp ingredients) so I'm not sure I can give the recipe all the credit there. Overall this is an excellent cheesecake recipe. I prefer to top mine with fresh strawberries but even plain, it is scrumptious.

I have been making cheesecake using this recipe for several years now. I have tried other recipes but I always come back to this one. BEST RECIPE EVER! Took me a few tries before I figured out how to prevent cracking and read a few reviews and it seems like mixing with a spoon is what has worked best. I am currently working on how to incorporate carrots or pumpkin to this recipe, will update once I figure out the best way to do it!

I made this last night but cut the recipe in half, it turned out pretty good.  I kept thinking that I did something wrong.  It just hit me this morning that I forgot to add the sour cream.  Still had a good flavor, didn’t sink or crack.  Will definitely try again the right way next time.

This is the best cheesecake ever!  I have made it for many occasions and every time I am asked for the recipe.  I use it for the jumping off point to make many flavors of cheesecake.  Great recipe.

I've made this cheesecake twice now and will say it's amazing. I let the cream cheese and eggs come to room temp before starting and follow the recipe exactly. Cracks every time but it's still super delicious. The last time I make it I did have an issue with the flour and vanilla extract clumping together and being scattered within the cake but no one noticed it and if they did it didn't matter because that one was eaten within 2 hours.

it was delicious!! But cracked big time in the middle followed direction to the tee...added canned cherries and it covered the cracks...no one knew, lol.
Ok made it again and it split again... I think the oven temp needs to be lowered after the oven is heated to 350 and place cake in oven and turn down to 300...anyone else have this problem?

I love this recipe! Everyone who tries it loves it. I am going to experiment with some suggestions and try to make a gluten-free cheesecake tomorrow by leaving out the flour and milk and making a crust with chopped nuts, butter and an egg white to help hold it together.

I have made many different cheesecakes in the past. This is how my only cheesecake. I am known by several family members as the "cheesecake lady".

I tried many times, and failed to make cheesecake many years ago. I switched to the "No Bake" cheesecakes but found they were never as good. Now that I am a little older (29, I was trying when I was a teenager) I thought that I was comfortable enough with my skills in the kitchen to try the bake cheesecakes again. With this having so many positive reviews I thought to myself "Well, I can't screw this one up, I guess" and I DIDN'T !!! This is simple, easy to understand it everyone LOVED it! Thank you for this recipe! I used a topping (Also from this site) and it was so delicious! I am diabetic, so had a very tiny piece, but the whole cake was gone that night with NO leftovers! I will definitely be making this a lot!

I made a few modifications:

For the crust, I used two sleeves of cinnamon graham crackers, added an additional 1/2 t of cinnamon, 2 T sugar and a 1/4 c butter. 

For the cheesecake batter, I followed the recommendations of another review I read on here and decreased flour to 2 T then baked at 225 for 3 hrs 40 min.  Once it finished baking, I turned off the oven and let it sit in there for 6 hours before putting it in the refrigerator to chill.

I also lined the sides of my springform pan with parchment to prevent it from sticking and baked it in a water bath.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was marvelous. This was my first cheesecake ever! I did lots of research and watched many other how-to videos as I had heard that it could be tricky to get the cheesecake to not crack.  Mine came out perfect! I was so impressed with myself since I am by no means a seasoned baker. I love to bake, but still have a lot to learn. There were no cracks and no browning on top! I made sure to mix everything by hand like others suggested after I creamed the cream cheese and sugar. I put in a 9x13 glass pan filled halfway up with hot water on the rack directly underneath my cheesecake. I think that did the trick.

I made this for my husband for his birthday . Everyone said it was delicious . My parents said it was as good as cheesecake they have had in NYC. I made homemade chocolate ganache and homemade whipped cream to go with it ! I followed the recipe exactly but it still cracked ... no one seem to mind ! Thanks for the perfect cheesecake recipe

I have made this a couple times for parties with friends and co-workers and have received nothing but great reviews. I have made it as a plain cheesecake, Oreo cheesecake (best one yet), and made one with a raspberry compote on top. It has cracked on me a couple times but I didn't have a great oven and other times I think I over stirred it.  Even with cracks it's still amazing. I read some of the low reviews and I experienced none of what they said. I also think you have to make sure you find a recipe to cater towards what you want in a cheesecake. I like a more sweet cheesecake without a strong cream cheese flavor and this recipe hits that mark. Next is incorporating some Reeses or make a turtle version.

One of the things I was reminded on the cheesecake is you need to make it the day ahead.  On the first day it was only so-so but on the second day it was wonderful.

I followed this recipe to a T against my better judgement and it didn't turn out that well. I measured out 15 graham crackers with 2 tablespoons of butter per recipe for crust and it wasn't enough butter, the crust was crumbly and just fell apart. I left it in the oven to cool to avoid cracking and it still cracked down the middle pretty bad.

The recipe is amazing and the cake was a success. I unfortunately did not read the reviews on how to keep a cheesecake from cracking, and my first one did crack. I will know next time to hand mix the batter after creaming the cream cheese and sugar.

I love this cheese cake! Simpler than other recipes and freakin tastes like heaven. I had a little more filling than my pan could take so I threw some smushed graham cracker on the bottom of a few cupcake liners and filled the rest with the filling. I took them out after they got firm (Obvi before the big cake was done) and wam bam thank you mam I have some cheesecake cupcakes. They are so so good. Highly recommend!

I made this exactly as recipe. It is delicious. I was a little worried when I was baking it because only the sides lifted and the middle seemed uncooked....  I turned it off at exactly an hour and left it in the oven without opening exactly how recipe calls for and it turned out so beautiful and well cooked. One of my daughters said it was a little to sweet but that can easily be fixed, maybe 1/4 cup less sugar will do the trick.

Amazing recipe, HOWEVER, if you have a decent oven, DO NOT LEAVE INSIDE FOR 5 HOURS! Not even 2. Experiment first.

The first time I made the recipe I didn't have enough time so I didn't leave the cheesecake in the oven (like the recipe suggests) after it was cooked. It turned out fantastic, no cracks.

The second time I made it I thought I'd leave it in, just to follow the recipe exactly as it is. I looked through the glass 2 hrs later and it had darkened AND had developed a crack down the middle! 
The crack certainly wasn't there when the baking finished and I turned off the oven. So leaving it in caused the crack and created somewhat of a dark, slightly crispy crust around my cheesecake surface which is not good.

Also the crust crumbles way too much. You're left with half the crust of your slice all powdered up on your plate.

From now on I will be
- taking it out immediately after the baking is complete and letting it cool down on the counter before refrigerating
- baking the crust for 5 minutes before I put the mix in

Ingredients are great though. Everybody loved it.

KETO COMMENT BELOW.  I have made this multiple times, as is and with modifications (this weekend is lemon cheesecake).  Some recommendations:

1. Beat cheese and sugar (I use fake sugar) on high until well combined - watch not to overmix.

2. Pre beat eggs, slowly beat into batter on LOW. DO NOT OVERMIX!  I actually gently stir in the remaining ingredients with a spatula, not the mixer. Overmixing causes cracks and a different texture.

3. Once you pour the batter into the pan, drop it from about 2" height onto the counter several times.  This removes bubbles.

4. Bake at night, turn off the oven and LET IT SIT IN THE OVEN OVERNIGHT.  Do not open the oven door!  In the morning refrigerate it (no cracks, ever, bain marie or not).

To make this KETO friendly, obviously, replace sugar with Swerve or your fav sugar replacement. I use Swerve confectioner sugar replacement but granular would work.

CRUST: Use toasted coconut mixed with golden flaxseed meal, butter and some Swerve (a couple of TBL).  Toast the coconut to deep brown but not burned!  Crunch it up (I do it with my hands) so it is the same consistency as graham cracker crumbs.  Then follow recipe.

BATTER: Use 5 bricks of cheese, 4 eggs, 1 c sour cream, sugar replacement and desired extract (I use vanilla or almond or coconut or whatever.  I also use more than recommended in this recipe - like 2 TBL.)  Bake roughly 60 minutes (based on your oven) and leave it overnight in the oven to cool S L O W L Y.

I will often top

A really solid recipe. Follow the instructions and you will have a crowd pleaser. I have made more than my for share of cheesecakes in the past and have gotten a ton of outstanding compliments. That being said, this cheesecake recipe didn’t quite hold up to that expectation. My normal recipe uses sweetened condensed milk and lemon juice, and this recipe seems a little bland in comparison.

This is the recipe you want to use every time. I’ve made this cheesecake a handful of times and it never fails. I make it exactly how it is written. Sometimes I make it into a sweet potato cheesecake and it comes out perfect. It has never cracked thankfully. I combine all ingredients before adding the eggs just to make sure it passes the taste test. I add eggs last. I cook in a water bath. Someone here had a tip. Instead of wrapping the bottom in foil just place the cheesecake pan in a larger pie pan and then place both pans in a water bath. This will eliminate water seeping into the bottom of the cheesecake pan. I also bake my graham cracker crust for about 10-15 mins before adding the mixture. Turn oven off at exactly 1hr and let it sit in oven for about 5 hours. Perfection. Everyone loves this cheesecake. Add some homemade whipped cream and strawberries to the top and it’s even better.

So this was my first cheesecake with a springform pan, I was so nervous but This cake was ssooooo easy and after reading the reviews which I recommend doing, I used some tips and made some adjustments. I made it the day before I served it....its best to make it the day before, because it helps with the process and flavor! I loved the way it sank just enough to make a perfect pocket to hold my topping.  Next time I will double the graham crust bc I would like to have a thicker crust and have it creep up the sides of the cake... I feel like the more I make this the better it will become! I would say don't even bother with the water bath, save your foil bc all u need to do is put a small baking bowl or pan (what ever u have that can be used in oven) of water under the cake, this will be perfectly fine and ur cake should not crack. I read a lot about why the cake cracks and there seems to be several reasons, but a Fact is if the air is dry the cake will crack ..just like dry skin ..u must keep it moist or it will crack, and if it does throw a topping on it, no one will know but u! The family loved it, I will make it again for sure! Thanx to everyone for all the reviews they really help!

My first attempt making a cheesecake, it turned out nearly perfect! I followed this receipt for the most part, I left out the milk and flour. I also put my spring form pan in a water bath while baking the cheesecake, this helps keep the cheesecake moist while baking. As soon as the time went off, 1 hour of baking, I turned the oven off but cracked the oven door to allow my oven to cool off quicker. After an hour cooling in the oven I put it right in the refrigerator, waited approximately an hour before releasing the spring form pan. My cheesecake turned out perfect, the texture was amazing and no cracks. This recipe is dummy proof as long as you follow the directions. One important thing to remember is DO NOT OVER MIX YOUR INGREDIENTS, mix just long enough to incorporate. I will hands down make this cheesecake again and couldn’t recommend it enough! My husband rated the cheesecake as a 9/10, I was impressed myself! (I swirled raspberry filling throughout the cheesecake)

While nothing is perfect, this cheesecake  is darn close.  I added orange zest and it was delicious. Wonderful texture, very creamy,  ENJOY.

I've used this basic recipe countless times over the years. My main change is to use Animal Crackers for the crust. 
To do a great chocolate variety, add 3 heaping teaspoons of cocoa powder to the sugar and a half tsp of both cocoa and confectioner's sugar to the crust with a dash of vanilla(fake is ok for chocolate chzck)
Pumpkin is a challenge, decreasing the milk is a good way to keep it from being too loose.
Mocha - Mix instant coffee with the milk (don't be shy) and make the base chocolate batter.
Let me know your successes with these slight modifications.

This cheesecake turned out perfect and everybody loved it!  I have been baking cheesecakes for a very long time and this is one of the best recipes that I have found.  So easy to make, delicious and beautiful to look at!  I like that it uses 4 packages of cream cheese and also 1 cup of sour cream as it makes a nice and deep cheesecake.  As we have many chocolate fans in our family - I did a chocolate cookie crumb crust, and topped it with a simple chocolate ganache with blueberries and strawberries - it was gorgeous!  Thanks for the recipe!

So far it's the best I've made, but not the best I've tasted.  I did add a tablespoon of lemon juice for flavor.

Very good! Instead of using 2 tablespoons of butter and 15 graham cracker pieces, use 3 tablespoons butter and 24 graham cracker pieces (not whole bars). Also, I request cooking cheesecake for an hour and then letting the oven cool with the door open while the cheesecake is sitting after cooking for one hour. We left it in for 5-6 hours and it over cooked but if you let the oven cool and leave the cheesecake in for one hour with the door open, it should taste great!

This was my very first attempt and baking a cheesecake. Also, let me add that I am new to baking and I don't really like sweets. However, I followed the recipe as directed and let me tell you, it was a sure fire hit. It came out beautiful. But, it did crack in the center. I believe I over mixed it. I have friends who love cheesecake and have made hundreds and now they are asking me for this recipe. It was light and fluffy and not overly sweet. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.

This is my go to cheesecake recipe. The only variations I ever make are to whatever I used for a crust. Sometimes, it's crushed oreo cookies (any variety), vanilla waffers, brownie, or what not. Sometimes I'll add lemon zest to add a little pop to it. Also, I picked up a silicon water barrier (from Amazon) for using a water bath. No matter what I did before, I'd have a leak and soggy crust. Now, perfect water bath results - No crack, no leaks.

This recipe was still really good even with these changes that I had no choice to make....I forgot the milk and used ladyfingers crushed up for the crust.  I baked it for an hour and a half, took it out of the oven for about a half an hour and then moved it straight to the fridge due to lack of time.  I wanted to have it for dessert a few hours later.  It was a major hit!  It didn’t even crack.

Excellent recipe.  I did however make a few changes based solely on personal preference.  I changed out the graham cracker crust to a ground almond crust as my son prefers it.  I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk because I happened to have some that needed to be used up, and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup.  Also, after reading about some people having problems with cracking I wrapped the pan with heavy foil and placed in a baking pan half filled with hot water, then checked the cheesecake at 50 minutes bake time.  I ended up having to bake 1 hour 5 minutes.  It just depends on the accuracy of the oven and I would rather check beforehand than have an overcooked anything.  This recipe is very forgiving, letting you change things up depending on preference.  Great recipe.  Family all loved it, better than the cheesecake I made for Easter from Driscolls website.  Got lots of 'wows' from everyone. Thank you.

I've made this for years and can't believe I didn't rate it. Best cheesecake recipe you'll find. Read helpful reviews. Don't over beat, grease sides of pan. I follow it EXACTLY with exception to adding a teaspoon or two of lemon juice and using a water bath (ok so not exactly). Oven temp at 350 for MY oven is fine. Everyone knows if mom is making cheesecake DON'T open the oven door. ;)

I made this the first time as is and it tasted great but the crust was crumbly and it cracked even though I had everything at room temperature, hand mixed, and left in oven for 6 hours to cool. When making the second time I increased the butter to 4 tbs and added 2tbs sugar and a pinch of salt to the crust. For the cake I used 2/3 cp of heavy cream instead of the milk. This time I used the mixer for the entire recipe. I left the cake to cool for 6 hours in the oven and NO CRACKS! This cake was sooooooo creamy and smooth and the crust was to die for. Will definitely be my go to recipe (with my changes of course)

Followed directions exactly.  Used a hand mixer for cream cheese and sugar, hand mixed everything else.  Kept in in the oven for a extra 10 minutes which made it a little brown on top but I covered it with strawberries to no one minded.  This is a keeper!

I have never made cheesecake before. This recipe is perfect as is. The only mod I made was adding more butter to my crackers so that they hold together better. So I eyeballed that and I also followed the advice of others and left the ingredients at room temp. Served with strawberry sauce and now this is my go to recipe for cheesecake. It really does taste like one you would get in a deli. :3

The tip about not over mixing, leaving it in the oven to cool down made this cheesecake with the perfect texture and barely, I mean barely any cracking. This came out like a dream.

I’ve made this cheesecake twice. The first time followed instructions as is. Tasted great but looked like a total disaster and was a little dry. The second time, I allowed ALL ingredients to come to room temperature and followed the advice of mixing everything in with a wooden spoon (except for the cream cheese/sugar.) I also cooked it at 325 for 1hr 20 minutes in a water bath and let it cool in the oven for a few hours. No brown top, no raised edges and no cracks. It was PERFECT. (Luckily because it was for Mother’s Day!)

Between the how too video and the written recipe this turned out to be the most perfect cheesecake anyone in my family has ever tasted.  The 5-star rating is well-deserved.

The first time I made this exactly as it is posted- The cheesecake burned then cracked 7 ways to Sunday. The second time I followed other recipe techniques and Baked the crust first for 10 minutes at 350. Then I baked the cheesecake at 325 in a water bath with the pan wrapped in 4 layers of aluminum foil. Much bettter

Great go-to cheesecake recipe.  It's not overly sweet and is great with fresh berries.

I've taught cooking for over 25 years and I made a few changes:  I sifted the sugar with the flour to help prevent lumping.   The first time I made it I did as per the instructions given and my cake still cracked.  So, the second time (and thereafter) I used the water bath method and the cheesecake didn't crack and browned just slightly around the edges.  Lovely.  The taste and texture are just superb.  Thank you.

This was the first time I have made cheesecake. I was apprehensive as I was serving it to new guests. I followed the recipe exactly along with the cheesecake tips ( bath, baking for an hour and leaving  in oven for 5 hours to cool then to refrigerator). It was absolutely amazing. The guests compared it to Juniors Cheesecake and asked if they could have a piece to take home. Worth the effort and research.

I made this cake a couple of years ago for Christmas holiday.  It met with rave reviews.  Now I have to make it every year!  The only substitution I make is using mostly half and half instead of the milk.  Delicious!

Very easy to make and delicious! The only thing I would add  is to give your cheese cake a bath. So put tinfoil around the bottom of your spring form pan and then place it on a deep cookie sheet and add some water onto the cookie sheet so it creates a bit of steam. The steam will prevent your cheesecake from cracking by keeping up the moisture. Works every time.

This recipe is AMAZING. I was tempted to fall into the trap of thinking I know better - I'll just tweak this, change that a little - but I trusted the recipe and it came out amazing. I made sure to grease the sides of the dish to avoid cracking, and it pulled away seamlessly with no cracks at all. It was beautifully set, the perfect consistency and taste. I did the same technique with the strawberries that is seen in the photo, and I made sauce with frozen raspberries, leftover strawberries, maple syrup, and corn starch, and it was a hit. I will absolutely be making this again.

This is my favorite cheesecake recipe. It’s very simple to make. It has a delicious and creamy texture. It goes well with any fruit I have tried with it, but can stand alone. You have got to follow the directions. Cheesecake is not the time to make substitutions on ingredients, for me anyway.

Excellent recipe.  Same recipe as on the back of my spring form pan wrapper.  I did not have a pan large enough to set the spring form pan into with water. So, I just put a pie pan on the lower rack with hot water. Worked great, no cracking. I will definitely make this again and again.

I give this a four star only because the recipe makes enough for a 12inch springform I have made it several times and there is no way this amount would fit in a 9 or 10 inches. Not sure why no one else mentions that.

Excellent cheesecake!  I followed the directions as written except I could only leave the cheesecake in the oven for 3 1/2 hours and then cooled it on the counter for an hour before putting it in the frig.  It didn't crack and was cooked perfectly.  Everyone loved it!  It was as good or better than the Cheesecake Factory!

Meh.  my second time making it.  this is fantastic --with all the changes.  the bath on the below rack, no flour, no milk, more cream cheese, reduced sugar, reduced temp to 325 with additional time of 1.25hrs, additional butter for the crust as well as spices.  I made it without changes and it was rather gross.  the changes make this a success.

SOUS VIDE Cheesecake!  I made this recipe SOUS VIDE METHOD and cooked it in ten 4oz mason jars and one larger glass container. It came out excellent!  The smaller mason jars were much more like a ‘cake texture’ while the larger glass container was creamier texture. The only downside was the graham cracker crust wasn’t crunchy like the oven baked version. Next time I’ll try cooking the crust only in dry heat then add the cheesecake. Wish we took picture but everyone ate it up too quickly.

This recipe is pretty solid and delicious. But, I'm a perfectionist and want to improve it more. Here are my notes to try and improve the next time I make it:
- Top burned a bit - lower temp? I added some lemon juice, maybe that's why it burned? Otherwise, I followed the recipe religiously
- Want it to be MORE CREAMY. EXTREME CREAM! Maybe look at other recipes that maybe use heavy cream

Used this recipe to make a Valentine’s Day cheesecake for my husband. Followed the instructions except for taking out of the oven after only 3 hours and then refrigerating. He said it was next level. Loved it!  Definitely a go-to for a fabulous cheesecake.

This recipe is a great base work, my only issue is that it is an all day adventure. Waiting 7+ hrs to put it in the fridge is mind blowing especially when you dont have that much time to handle it. Mine did crack, i didnt read the reviews peior to making it and didnt realize that you arent suppose to use a blender after the cream cheese/sugar step. Oh well. Ill try again next time:

I loved this cheesecake! Super easy to make and real yummy. The only thing I was disappointed with is that it ended up cracking. That may be my fault though. Another thing that was a tad inconvenient (also my fault) was I had to stay up for five hours to take it out of the oven and into the fridge. I was up until 3 in the morning!

First time I’ve made cheesecake and was a success. The only Chang I made was to the graham cracker crust. I used a stick of butter, 4 packages of graham crackers a 3/4 cups of sugar. This way the crust went up the side of the pan. The cheesecake was nice and creamy and the taste was superb!!

This was a fanstatic, hevenly recipe. The only I did different was cooked it in a waterbath. This is better than any store bought cheesecake. I did cool it down for three hours, then transferred to the fridge overnight to finish the cooling process. I will definately use this again

Anytime my family wants cheesecake, this is my go to recipe. Albeit my family loves their desserts on the sweet side, I add about a fourth to a half cup more of sugar. I took one to my coworkers and they raved about it as well.

I thought it was delicious but I had a good bit of batter left over and the graham cracker crust was to dry even though I added extra butter because it seemed to dry

I LOVE this cheese cake.  Every place I take it to people rave about it.  My only issue and I am sure it is something I am doing is it cracks every time.  If anyone has ideas on how to avoid this I would appreciate it.  Delicious.

Good flavor. Mine didn’t crack or sink. All of my wet ingredients were room temperature. I beat the cream cheese and sugar with the electric mixer, but I hand-whisked everything thing else until just blended, to avoid over mixing, which causes cracking. I cooked for one hour,  left in the oven for one hour with the door closed and the oven off, then cooled for one hour on top of the still warm oven, then one hour on the table, then I refrigerated it. This was my method of gradual cooling. The only negative comment I received was that it was a little thick. I think next time I will use 2tbs flour instead of 4.

My daughter and I made this cheesecake yesterday and followed the recipe exactly as written. It did not crack but the taste was good but not great. It's a bit bland for us. Also, using the 9" pan made it way too thick to cook evenly, next time I will use a wider pan and adjust the crust size accordingly. Also, the crust had a "sandy" texture, next time more butter. I'm now looking up berry sauce recipes to spruce up the flavor so we don't waste this very large cheesecake.

Delicious!  I followed a few of the reviews and used a water bath.  It cooked closer to 1.5 hours, but turned out perfect.  We only let it sit 5 hours in fridge.  it was good, but the texture is MUCH better if you let it sit overnight.  Per another review, I also added a little cinnamon and white sugar to the graham cracker crust.  yum!!  Making my second cheesecake with this recipe as I'm typing.  This time, we're going to let her cool for a full 24 hours.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written, including the instructions that say to turn off the oven and leave it and it turned out really great. This was my first time making a cheese cake and I found it to be simple to do. I did not find it to be eggy or too sweet as others did. It was creamy and delicious. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us. I will make it again and again.

This was REALLY good! And easy to make.
I'd recommend you have a good mixer. Or when you're mixing the cream cheese and sugar you add the milk right away so it isn't so thick and hard on your mixer.
I want to make a smaller version of this for an 8 1/2 inch pan. What would the conversion be for this?

I like cheesecake a little sweeter and the sour cream in this tones it down quite a bit. I would taste batter and cut sour cream down some so that it still remains sweet.

Followed the instructions to the letter. I might add a little more vanilla in the future, as I use homemade vanilla, and the taste is slightly different than store bought. Also, I did use a water bath during the baking part. 1 hour, shut it off, and forgot about it until I came home later that evening, and put it in the fidge.  Everyone raved about it.

My one advice: Don't skimp on the quality of the ingredients.  With limited ingredients, use top quality stuff, not store brand.

I made the recipe exactly as stated. Turned out perfect. This was my second time making this cheesecake. The first time it was not completely done in the middle. I think it was because I opened the oven door to check on the cheesecake. DO NOT OPEN the OVEN DOOR.  It lets out the heat needed to completely cook the cheesecake. It is very tempting, but DO NOT OPEN the oven door.

I’ve made this many times over the years, following the instructions to a “T” and it always cracked. It didn’t bother me too much- I just served topped with cherry pie filling. This year, I tried a water bath and OMG!!! Perfection!!!  No cracking. Just smooth, creamy perfection.

This was my very first attempt at making cheesecake and it came out perfect...I followed the recipe almost exactly...I did add a splash of lemon juice, I reduced oven temp to 325 and put a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven...and to be honest, I really did not measure out the crust portion...I just crushed a bunch of grams and mixed in melted butter a little at a time till it was the right consistency.  When I make this again I am going to blind bake the crust...its good, but I prefer a more crisp crust.

I use this recipe often! I use 4 tablespoons of butter and bake the crust for 5 minutes before I pour in the batter. It stays together nicely this way.

The only change I made was the design which does not make any change. I will definitely make a change.

My go-to cheesecake recipe for years now! Follow the directions to a tee. I don’t use a water bath but I do place a cake pan full of water on bottom rack of oven. Never cracks.

I have made this cheesecake many many times. I sell them!
It is my go-to cheesecake recipe and if I need different kinds I just add what I want: caramel, Raspberries, chocolate.... Etc. 
I love it and it has gone in my heritage cookbook that I will pass on to my kids. (with author credits of course)
Use it. Add to it or keep it classic. It's a winner

I've made this cheesecake many times, even substituted this cheesecake recipe for a layer between red velvet cake layers.  It's to die for and the only recipe I ever use for cheesecakes.  Absolutely wonderful.

Used the other reviewer's suggestion & tried to not mix it too much to prevent cracking. I also put it in the oven for exactly hour & then immediately turning the oven off without checking or opened the door. Also needed a little extra melted butter to add to the cracker crumbs. Next time I will have to remember to not add the vanilla until the flour has been mixed in to prevent ever so tiny brown lumps.

Made this for a family get together, follow the recipe exactly still cracks right down the middle and this was a large crack! Otherwise was great in taste and texture will probably make it again just not sure how to keep it from cracking?

I've made this time and time again since I was in highschool. This is my go to recipe for cheesecake and everyone always loves it. I do add a sour cream topping to my cheesecakes to help cut the richness but this is perfect.

When I make cheesecake, this the only recipe I use.

I do add about a tablespoon of ground cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg to the batter when I add the vanilla.  It adds just a hint of flavor that people usually can't identify but everyone tells me adds a really nice flavor.  

As others have mentioned, I put the cheesecake pan inside an oven bag and place that in another larger pan.  I then add hot water in the outer pan so it reaches about 2/3's up the side of the spring form pan.  Doing this, I have never had a cheesecake crack.

Made this last weekend and it was really good!  Dense but not too dense, creamy and not too sugary.  

I followed the directions exactly but got huge cracking .  I hid the cracks with strawberries on top but it was annoying. 

I'm making it again today for thanksgiving and I'll try a water bath and see how that works....

This is a very good basic New York cheesecake. It is a traditional cheesecake, so if you haven't made one before read the comments with "how to" particulars. I added cinnamon and chopped pecans to my crust for added flavor. It would have been fine without though. If you are looking for quick and easy, this is not, but if you are looking for an award winning recipe that everyone will ask for, I highly recommend this one!

I downloaded the recipe for the first time 2 years ago & I've made it about 10 times since then.  I  do it just as the recipe was written, but I use a waterbath, the first couple of times that I made it, it did crack, so my husband used a thermometer in the oven and we realized my oven heats up hotter than what it says on the dial, so I set my oven to lower now and it works fine. I put a wooden spoon in the oven door to hold it open.  (When it did crack I just added a chocolate fondant to the top & no one complained that they got the part with the extra chocolate in the crack, but that hasn't happened since I started checking my oven with a thermometer to make sure the heat isn't over 350F.)

For context, this was my first attempt at a BAKED Cheesecake.

Overall, pretty good though not quite what I was hoping for.  I do plan to give it a second shot but with a couple changes to see if it gets a bit closer to what I was aiming for: 1) remove all flour [too "cakey"/fluffy for my taste], 2) perhaps remove much/all milk [there's something just a bit off about the taste/texture combo and I can't tell if it's just the flour or flour/milk], 3) lower the oven temp 5-10 deg [the outside edge and bit on top edge were dark brown - not burnt but heading that direction], and 4) reduce the sugar by about 1/2 cup [just a tad too sweet for my taste].

I didn't have a pan large enough for a water bath, so just had a pan of water in the bottom of the oven for steam.  I left it in the oven for the full 6 hours after baking finished.  The Cheesecake did still crack, however perhaps I over mixed.  We'll see on the 2nd attempt.

Somewhere I lost half my post but as I was saying I also added a sauce I found online which made this cheesecake exceed 5 stars. I used a water bath, let it cool in the oven for three hours and threw it in the fridge overnight. This recipe is truly amazing and one I’ll make again! Thank you to the woman/man who shared it! ??

Best EVER Cheesecake! I make this for every Holiday, or special event its  so wonderful! My family asks me to make it every year for Christmas .I had made it with several variations. I don't change the recipe, I just mix in lots of good things to change it up. I often add mini chocolate chips & drizzled the slices with chocolate syrup before serving. My personal favorite is adding Mint chocolate chips  and top it with shaved chocolate pieces. Its such a wonderful recipe you can even mix in slivered almonds or chopped walnuts. Its so good & everyone asks for the recipe! This Recipe is beyond 5 stars!!!

My 10 year old daughter requested that I make this for her birthday! I have made it about 5 times; according to the directions. It has never cracked- I put foil around it, then tie a crockpot liner around it, then place on foil pan with hot water in it. Legit, leave in for 6 hours. Then into the fridge. Great because you need to make it day before, so easy on the day you need it. A family favorite!

Oh my gosh, this is my favorite ever cheesecake recipe EXACTLY as it is! My only problem was on the graham cracker crust. It didn’t clarify 18 whole graham crackers vs 18 quarters. With whole graham crackers, it wasn’t enough butter to be able to pack down the crumbs, and with just the quarters, it wasn’t enough crust. Very easy to make ( I didn’t do a water bath or any of the other suggestions and it was perfect). Everyone raved that it was the best cheesecake they had ever had.

The filling was so delicious!! My boyfriend and everyone loved it. I messed up on the crust sadly, so next time I’ll just lightly butter the bottom of the pan & spread the crumbs that way.

I’ve made this cheesecake probably 4 times and each time it came out perfectly! I bake it in water bath and once baked leave it for like 5 hours in the oven to cool down, after wrap it and put in the fridge over night! and it turns out beautiful each time, no cracks, doesn’t fall... just delicious

Only thing I want to point out is that the graham cracker and butter amount is not correct . I used 15 graham crackers and 2 tbsp did not even make it remotely moist. I think I used 2/3 stick of butter to get the crackers moist enough to be able to press it into the pan.

I've made this cheesecake 6 times, each time it came out perfectly.  I use a 9" Pyrex casserole dish with the inside greased so it can pull away as it cools and shrinks, & bake it @ 325, no water bath; hasn't cracked once.  I leave it in the oven for 5 hours with the door closed after I turn it off.  Ridiculously easy to make & better-tasting with superior texture compared to any cheesecake I've bought.  I leave the cream cheese, eggs, sour cream, & milk to sit @ room temp for 2 hours before preparing.  Also, I do not use the flour; it turns out amazingly creamy.

I used Kimar's crust - loved it!  Thanks, Kimar!  The cheesecake was very tasty, the consistency was a little weird after I added the flour.  I might try it next time without it.  But all in all, I will make this again.  Thanks, Chantal!

This was ok. Definitely much better the second day. The flavour was good, it just wasn’t quite traditional cheesecake & it didn’t have the consistency & flavour of cheesecake. I prefer a denser cheesecake, this was almost a cold cake. As others said, you could taste the egg. I followed the recipe exactly,  it looked nice and I think came out as intended. It just wasn’t for us. If I make it again I would double the cream cheese but then I don’t know how that would affect the other ingredients. So I probably won’t.

This is absolutely delicious, I’ve never made a New York style cheesecake before so I was skeptical however, I loved it. I’ve made many different kinds including my own lemon cheesecake recipe. This is the best cheesecake I’ve ever made.

I've made this countless times and always get raving comments on it. I almost never have leftovers. I've had the famous New York Junior's Cheesecake twice and this is pretty close to it (but way cheaper). The recipe is pretty foolproof and I would say that the water bath is a must unless you want the top overcooked and dry. I had issues with soggy crusts many times (even with foil) until I discovered using the crock pot liner bags. Seriously works! I've brought it out when the timer beeped for time's sake before and it was just as good as when I left it in the turned-off oven for a few more hrs (with a water bath, it shouldn't affect it much!). I agree with upping the butter to 1/4 c and I usually add a pinch of salt to the crust. I've tried many variations of this including raspberry swirl, chocolate chip, and also a gluten-free version (no flour and use gluten free cookies instead of graham crackers) for my celiac and gluten sensitive friends. All in all, my go-to cheesecake recipe.

I just made this for the second time with a little more confidence than the first time. Didn't use the lemon or orange zest because I wanted the classic taste. I think it taste better a couple of days after it's made. It may just be in my head but most desserts seem to taste better after they've sat for a bit. I love this recipe and I will do it again and again. I've always been told  homemade cheesecakes are difficult to make but this recipe is simple and the results are amazing.

This cheesecake recipe is terrible. I make an amazing cheesecake but decided to try a different recipe. I BARELY mixed and the texture came out entirely wrong. I’ve never had so many cracks in my cake and the edges were burned. Just awful!!! Use any. Other. Recipe.

AWESOME, it’s my first time ever making cheesecake I always had it at Starbucks, now this one is even better without even a topping! It’s top was so caramel-like so we ate it like that, my grandma loved it! One thing is that it’s not as thick/high as the rest of the pictures, idk why? Other than that it’s great thank you so much Allrecipes

I made this using a waterbath as suggested - wrapped the pan in foil then set into a crock pot liner to make sure no water got inside- baked at 325 for 75 minutes, then left in the oven for four hours to cool.  It did not look cooked AT ALL after the 70 minutes, no browning on the edges, but i just left it and trusted it was cooked.  After a day in the fridge i tried it and it was DELICIOUS!  The day after that it was even better! I think for my next one I will back off the sugar in the crust, it was a little weepy and a tad too sweet, so i'll probably halve the amount of sugar.  Made a blueberry topping for this, and OMG was it good!  Several people said it was the best cheesecake they've ever had and I've been asked over and over for the recipe.  It is now my GO TO cheesecake!   

Make sure you allow all your ingredients to come to room temperature, it makes a big difference in the success of your cake.

Made exactly as written; it was a bit dry for my taste. Not as creamy as other cheesecakes I've made. I'll stick with Ina Garten's cheesecake as it's much more decadent and creamy.

I made this cheesecake exactly like the recipe said. And I read a ton of reviews on it first. Including the first one that said if you mess it up it’s your own fault. I greased the sides of the springform pan, I didn’t over mix it, I didn’t open the oven door and let it cool in there for six hours, and I still have a crack the size of the Grand Canyon in the middle of it!

Ok ...here is my story ... I am not a baker and the few times I have made cheesecake they turned out okay ... but I thought I would try again, I found this recipe, followed it precisely (including keeping the cake in the oven for hours after it was baked) and it was professional looking and everyone loved, loved, loved it .. so to the one reviewers point if someone's did not come out right, it was them not the recipe! I am making it again this week!

This cheesecake recipe is perfect as written. I’ve made it a dozen times at least. I frequently have difficulty with the cake cracking, but I don’t think this has anything to do with the recipe and has everything to do with how much I mix the recipe, my oven, waterbath and humidity level when baking.

It doesn't taste so bad, but I think it's a lot of sugar and a lot of vanilla, I like that cheesecake taste creamy and kinda sour but this was like a vanilla sweet explosion. I won't be making this ever again :(

Maybe a teaspoon of vanilla instead of a tablespoon would do the trick and less sugar.

This recipe makes me so mad!  All of my friends and family always ask me to make it...  ugh!  ??This is, hands down, THE best cheesecake recipe ever.  Make sure you use a water bath, turn off oven at exactly one hour and let cool in the oven for a few hours.  You will not be disappointed.  I didn’t change a thing!  Happy, crack free, baking!

I think it needs more butter in the crust. I tried it and the graham crackers are falling apart.

I followed the recipe exactly. I made sure not to over mix. Mix by hand once the sugar and cream cheese have been combined. This was incredible!!! This was the first time I made a cheesecake and it the best cheesecake I've ever had. Many people were saying this could be sold at a bakery!

I decreased the flour to two tablespoons as suggested by other reviews. I added an additional 1/4 cup of sugar for more sweetness. I baked the cheesecake with a water bath and turned the oven off when time done. The cheesecake was creamy, delicious, and rich.

I made a mistake! When I added the vanilla and flour I should have done this separately because of course I have little flour lumps of vanilla throughout the cake. It is in the oven so I will see how it ends up. I should have known better. My fault.

This was good. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is for the crust, which was kind of bland. I would make this again, but with a different crust recipe.

I impressed myself! I didn’t know how easy making homemade cheesecake would be. I think I over mixed it because mine also cracked, but besides that it was delicious and a perfect basic cheesecake.

This is an excellent recipe which doesn’t need any tweaking. It is delicious and and I have baked it many times for family & friends. It is really important to leave it in the oven for a few hours after baking.

I make this every yer for my husbands birthday.  Absolutely the best cheesecake recipe.  I leave it plain and offer a buffet of toppings for those who like to add to their slice, but it is perfect plain too.  The texture is perfect not too creamy and not too dry!  Can't wait for the next birthday!

Five stars even when I changed the crust. I replaced a 1/4 cup roasted, ground pecans to the Graham cracker crust then baked it for 10 minutes at 350 degrees and cooled. Proceeded as the recipe. This is the only dessert my 30 year old son will eat and requests it every year on his birthday. I've made it  for the last 6 years since I found it here. Thanks!

Let me start by saying that I’m Not a baker! Its a second cake I ha ever baked and first cheesecake! Turned out amazing!!! I made it for my husband for Fathers Day! Topped off with strawberries in jello! He absolutely loved it! I followed the recipe and must say that only think I might do next time is lower the temperature to 325F as my cheesecake was little to brown on top! Other than that thank you for amazing recipe!!!

Excellent recipe, it really fills the cheesecake pan though. It cracked but only a small crack in the middle and my family could have cared less. I will use this recipe again.

Amazing Recipe! Made not many deviations, however might change the crust to make it a bit crisper next time ... I did put it a water bath and I let it rest for right at 5 hours... even cook and no cracks! Did cook it at the lower heat 325.  Took it to work and it was all gone  in les than an hour! Huge hit!

Rolla you are entitled to your opinion but keep in mind, everyone’s taste is different. I have tried MANY cheesecake recipes and I myself think this is by far the best I have ever had. It’s better than any restaurant cheesecake and I have ate at fine restaurants. You can add a little less flour and/or sugar and if you read the reviews there are exceptional ideas to keeping it from cracking or browning.  My daughter is having me make 3 of them and stack them for her wedding

Don’t overbeat, room temp ingredients, more butter for crust. Used 8” pan and baked for little a bit longer, 350 for 45 min, 325 for 25min, in a water bath. So creamy and delicious.

I took some advice and it still cracked. I found it to be somewhat dry. Not very sweet. Not as creamy as you would like cheesecake to be. I probably won't make this one again but it was worth a try. Very dissapointed

Made it 3x now (my son has) and it’s delicious every time. Better than Cheesecake Factory. The changes he makes is to only use 3tbsp of flour, to use more butter with the graham crackers, bake the crust for 8-10 minutes before and wait for it to completely cook before pouring mix in, and use a water bath.

Yummy, Taste five stars! I give it four because I feel like it needs to add some very needed tips for cheesecake novices like me. I made it and it turned out great except that the sides browned a bit and there is a crack down the middle. It wasn’t until after this happened that I looked up what should have been done to avoid this like putting it on a pan with water, being very careful to not overwhip, and other helpful tips.  It’s definitely missing that something that makes a perfect cheesecake!

seems to be a bit more costly than most, but made exactly and everyone enjoyed so a keeper. I use a jelly roll pan that's about an inch thick and fill with water and put the cheesecake about it on the next rack. Works perfectly as a steam bath. Don't peek leave it be for at least 5 hours once the timer goes off. I put out several toppings so everyone enjoys their favorite.

Excellent, excellent recipe! I have made this now three times and my last attempt was my best!! The recipe itself is very clear and is impt to follow. There were a couple of reviews which helped me, as well. I had a slight cracking with my previous two attempts and have reduced my mixing and added extra butter to the sides to prevent pulling when cooling. This last time I also tried placing a baking dish with water underneath during baking and cooling. A water bath was recommended, but I was nervous to submerge, so I just kept an extra pan with water below to add moisture. A must try!!

I used a pre-made 9 inch graham cracker crust and the filling was enough to make two.  Next time I will half the recipe as I do not need that much.

I have this now for the fifth time and never had a report from anyone who tried it. Thought I’d do something a little different this time swirled in caramel,I’ll try to update after my family tries it this weekend at our annual Christmas party.

Thanks for a great recipe.  I made it for a nephew's birthday party; it got rave reviews.  Delicious.  Will make again for another special occasion.   I followed the recipe since cheesecake baking is new to me.    The only thing I didn't care for was my choice of graham crackers.  I used Nabisco and I thought their flavor was a little too strong.  I used fresh eggs (as in laid by my chickens just hours before baking) and their dark yolks made the cheesecake a lot darker than those I've eaten in restaurants.

First cake I've made on my own, turned out perfect so, so easy. Every one loved it. I made an icing with whip cream. 1/4 of a half gallon of heavy cream, 3 tbs of powdered sugar, 2 tsp of  vanilla extract.

Did not change a thing.  Made it at a request for a birthday cake.  Seven of us had a slice and everyone raved about it.  As I had not made a cheese cake in over 25 years I wasn't sure what it would look like when I opened the oven door.  No cracks, smooth and beautiful.  Thank you so much for posting.

The texture of the filling was good, but it wasn't sweet enough. The crust was too crumbly and didn't stay together when cut.  It caused quite a mess.  Cooking time was too long.  I peeked in the oven after 50 minutes and I could tell it was getting too dark.  I shut off the oven at that point, but  I still had to scrape the dark brown (almost black) surface.  The crust tasted a little burnt too.  I covered the scrapes with a mixture of sour cream and powdered sugar and it looked ok.

If I make it again, I will increase the sugar by 1/2 c. for the filling, increase the butter to 1/2 c. for the crust and add about 1/4 c. sugar to the crust as well.  I'll cook for about 40 minutes instead of 1 hour.

Ah- freaking- mazing!! This is by far the best cheesecake recipe out there. I did add more butter for the crust because the amount in the recipe was not enough for the crust stick together. Make sure to grease the sides, this will help it to not crack as it rises. Do not over mix!!

absolutely the real deal! PERFECTLY DELICIOUS!! it is my no fail, go to, impress our dinner guests dessert recipe.... i do recall the instructions used to have more details though....
all ingredients room temp, pour batter through a cheese-cloth or sieve to remove air bubbles, cook in a water bath and yes DONT open oven to check it just turn oven off and leave it there for 5-6 hours... DONT forget the perfect cutting  techniques either.... long bladed knife (one cut) ran under hot water so it wont tear up edges, then ran again under hot water to clean & heat blade before each cut. PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL EVERYTIME! Thanks Chantal!

Delicious! I made this twice in two days and both times, it turned out perfectly with no cracks. I used another reviewer's crust recipe (it included cinnamon and nutmeg; I couldn't resist), and then used the cheesecake recipe as was. It was light, fluffy, moist, and sweet. I did a waterbath for it, baked it for an hour, and then walked away for five hours without even cracking open the oven. The result was a beautiful cheesecake. I will be making this again and again!

My first time making a cheesecake and it came out so well my boyfriend at a whole one by himself! Definitely making it again soon .. sidenote: the tip about not overmixing is real as is the one to not check on it in the oven .. mine cracked but not so bad that strawberry topping could cover them ;)

I tried this recipe as my first ever homemade cheesecake. It turned out fantastic. It was a work of art. It was so thick and pretty I hated to cut it. Mine did crack some of top but that wasn’t a deal breaker for me. It tasted wonderful. I would suggest adding something sweet as a topping such as cherries or chocolate/caramel sauce. Also I only let it “cool down” in the oven for an hour. I couldn’t wait any longer. ;)

I did not have a 9-inch pan, so I made 2 cheesecakes. I used smaller aluminum pans. The recipe made 2 cakes. My family loved it. I will definitely made it again.

This was EXCELLENT!! I made it for New Year's Eve and everyone LOVED it. It baked a little longer than called for and was very brown on the top, but tasted great! We served it with cherry pie filling and fresh strawberries.

It was delicious! I used 4 tablespoons of butter for the crust and it came out perfect.

I've made this cheesecake twice for my boyfriend, who is an excellent cook himself, and so hard to impress. He thought it was a perfect cheesecake both time.
The first time I made it exactly as the recipe stated, paying careful attention to not over-mixing and cooling slowly. It was delicious and the texture was perfect, but it cracked. The second time I used a water bath which added to the cooking time. It came out prefect. Both times I used 4 sheets of graham crackers for the crust because I don't like  a lot of crust.

Tastes great! Definitely a party pleaser.  The only thing I can't seem to get it right is that the top cracks every time.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?

I loved this cheesecake. The ingredients were perfect for the flavor, texture, and micronutrients I wanted. Not too sweet and perfect for any topping - chocolate, fruit sauce, fresh fruit, anything!

This was the best cheesecake. Next time I will add a bit more butter to the crust as it was a bit crumbly and maybe some cinnamon and sugar to give it some sweetness.

I'm putting a 3 simply because I need to remake this again, as it is.  I tried to make this recipe with what I have available to me in Germany, and well, made a couple substitutions (accidental) which yielded a yummy cake, but not this cake, and certainly a more "cheesy" cheese cake than I'm used to.  For those in Germany (or of German background), if you like the taste of Schmelzkässe, I used this recipe with Schmelzkässe instead, as well as I left out the sour cream (another purchasing error), and it made a very taste, although cheesy, cake.  My girlfriend and her friend encouraged me to post this as an alternative for those struggling to find the right ingredients in Germany, or for those who really enjoy Schmelzkässe.  Also a note on the crust (for those where grammar crackers are not found), I used Leibniz crackers, which ended up being an excellent substitute.  I'll update this once I've been able to make the real recipe!

PS - As far as cracking is concerned, absolutely no cracking, and it baked perfectly.

I put a water bath above and below the cake (I put a rack in the bottom bath so the pan stays above the water line.)  I mix the flour with the milk with an immersion blender before adding it to prevent lumps.  I have done it with and without parchment.  It comes out amazing every single time.  The top water bath prevents drying and cracking for me and creates a smooth unbrowned surface.

Made exactly as stated. It did crack just one but I’m not a perfectionist yet the cheesecake tasted perfect! It’s straightforward and delicious. I baked, chilled overnight and served yet the day after it tasted even better. Highly recommended!

First time making this recipe, based on the number of reviews on the site.  While there were many suggestions and modifications posted, decided to follow the recipe as is my first time around, with the exception of a little less sugar because I ran out, be using Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream because sour cream wasn't available. I also mixed everything by hand because I did not have an electric mixer. I greased the baking pan well to prevent cracking. My cheesecake turned out great with no cracks even without using the water bath that many people suggested.  While creamy, the cheesecake turned out to be a little soft, whereas I would have liked it to be a little more dense, but other than that, it is a great recipe and the cheesecake was a hit! I will try it again with The suggested modifications so that I can compare the results!

I halved the recipe and it still made a 10 inch pie. I used a store bought graham cracker crust and it was good. I followed the recipe except I had to use what I call, fake sugar (hubby's diabetic) and I didn't leave it in the oven for several hours. I started out baking it at 350, then reading some of the reviews saying they baked at 225, etc, I turned the oven down to 300 for 1 hour. It turned out fine and I let it set in the oven for about half hour then cooled it on the stove. I will make it again, for sure. Good, simple recipe.

My first time making cheesecake! Brace yourself for a long review as I also write this as notes to myself for future baking.

First: reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. So 4 stars just to be safe and not overhype this recipe.

I made 15 servings worth to fill up my 10.25" pan and it was the perfect amount. I didn't "beat" at all as I didn't want to whip any air into the batter. I had it on stir and stirred the cream cheese by itself until fully smooth. I whisked the flour and sugar together separately to break up the flour and prevent flour lumps in the batter. Then I stirred the ingredients in the order as instructed, except for the milk bc I kind of just forgot. I DID add a tiny splash of almond extract (I do this with many of my different types of bakes) as it can really round out flavors. I lined the bottom of my springform pan with parchment for a hopefully easy removal onto a cake board afterward. I ended up baking this for 45min at 300F, then 30 min at 325F, then 30 min rest in closed oven, then another 30 min in an door-ajar oven. The reason for the 300F is because my oven when down in temp after I put the cake in--it started at 325, then down to 300. When I turned off the oven, the cheesecake was doming around the rims with a dip in the middle (like a donut shape) and a couple of very small cracks along the sides, but as it cooled down, the cake leveled out and pushed the cracks together so you don't see them anymore.

This was my first time making a cheesecake. I made this exactly as written except for 2 very minor changes: I added 2 more T of melted butter to the graham cracker crumbs because with the first 2 T they seemed pretty dry and like they would not pack into a crust and  I also didn't have quite a full cup of sour cream on hand. It did crack a little on the top but that did not change the taste of this cheesecake. It was fantastic and got rave reviews from all who tried it. I was making it for a birthday of someone who likes plain, no topping cheesecake so I did not add any type of sauce, etc. to it. Re: the graham cracker crumbs, I used 15 full length graham crackers, not 15 squares..maybe I used too much? I'm not sure if the extra butter was needed or if it would have been fine without it but it was delicious the way I made it. If I need or want to make a cheesecake again, I will return to this recipe.

I made this cake as requested for my grandson’s 15th birthday. I didn’t eat it, but I had 2 reviews: AMAZING from my daughter-in-law and PERFECT from my grandson. I had to take a few shortcuts because of lack of time (should be made one day ahead to follow the recipe perfectly), but these reviews speak for themselves. I was concerned about not precooking the crust a bit, but apparently not a problem. As suggested by other reviewers, I buttered my pan and it really help with the ‘cracking’ or lack thereof. Thank you for a great recipe. Plan to make again and allow for another time for cooling, etc.

This turned out amazing!! I researched cheesecake recipes for two hours and finally decided on this one! I had no way to do a water bath, so just chanced it, by baking in the middle of the oven for 60 min., it finished baking by 7:00 pm last night, I just shut the oven off, left the cheesecake in there until 7:00 this morning! It was absolutely perfect!! The creamy velvety texture melts in your mouth! I did a caramel toasted pecan topping from another recipe, turned out more like a praline, it was Devine!! Because the cheesecake is not very sweet, perfect in that way, the sweet pecan topping was just right! By far the BEST cheesecake recipe!!

Tried several recipes over the years and this one is hands down the BEST of them all! The only change I made was less sugar - about half of the amount, actually. It's perfect every time and the only time it did fail me was when I used really cheap spft cheese - never again. I highly recommend this one as it's really easy to make and wins the day every time. ;-)

This was my first time making cheesecake, so I read a large number of comments prior to starting the process. I used a different crust. The filling was as directed except I only used 3 T flour, as someone suggested, and I used sucralose sweetener instead of sugar to make it diabetic friendly. Many reviewers said having everything at room temperature is key and numerous comments said to use a water bath. I placed a broiler pan of hot water on the oven rack directly below and placed the spring form pan on a cookie sheet to bake it. It baked for 60 minutes, then I removed the water container, shut the oven door, and let it remain in the oven for 6 hours. It was still slightly warm, so I allowed it to cool before covering and storing in the refrigerator. This cheesecake was a hit when I served it the next day. It was especially good with fruit toppings and whipped cream. Thumbs up!

I added a “Samoa” topping of toasted coconut, mixed with caramel and drizzled with chocolate. I also made the crust from shortbread cookies.  The top didn’t crack at all (a first for me) and everyone LOVED it! I’ll definitely be making it again.

Excellent cheesecake! Best I’ve ever made and I’ve tried many over the years. I’ve made this exact recipe 5 times -not deviating from it at all- and it’s always absolutely perfect, classic cheesecake texture and flavor. I typically use the graham crackers as the base crust but I’ve often used crushed biscoff cookies instead! So yummy!!

After making this cheesecake multiple times and it cracking, I've finally found the adjustment this recipe needs. 350 degrees is too high. It needs to be around 315-325. An hour is also too long. 45 minutes is a better time. I also add the eggs last and mix with a silicone spatula instead of an electric mixer.

I haven't tasted this cheesecake yet, but it looks horrendous. I was trying to cut corners for Thanksgiving and avoid the water bath, so when I saw this recipe I thought I'd give it a try. Baked it for exactly one hour and left it in the over for 5-1/2 hours and when I opened the oven (the light is broken in my Thermador so couldn't see it beforehand...it was sunken in the middle, over-brown around the edges and cracked all over. I followed the recipe EXACTLY. Have made many cheesecakes with great success and this was a great disappointment. I guess you need the water bath. Maybe it's me--or my oven , or something because there certainly have been a lot of people who made this with success, but for the life of me I can't figure out what happened!

This was my first time making cheesecake ever and I looked like  a pro. I didn't change a single thing about the recipe and left it in the over for 6 hours. It was perfect! Creamy and rich without being to dense.

I’m sure it was my fault somehow (overmixed the eggs?) but this cracked like crazy!!! Followed recipe exactly. Next time will cook at lower temp for longer.

This is the best and easiest cheesecake recipe I have ever made! My family actually requests I make it for birthdays, holidays... as a form of payment lol. My husband is a cheesecake SNOB and even says this recipe is better than any restaurant he has ever tasted, and what makes it even sweeter it is half the cost! Now I did read alot of the other reviews, and cheesecake 101 is ingredients have to be room temp, no over mixing the eggs, and no peeking in the oven! These all equate to a cracked cheesecake. Still delicious, but flawed (aren't we all really? :p) Also I was reading on a few reviews that the flour was giving a "cakey" taste to the final product, get this... I used RICE flour. Its super loose, it doesnt clump like all-purpose and no "cakey" after taste... I telling you its AWESOME. Ive made the cheesecake 4+ times now (I honestly think my family won't allow me to stop making it) and its always turned out fantastic.

Tastes good and turned out fine but not dense enough to be called NY Cheesecake. You either add the milk or you add the sour cream but you don't add both.  It makes for a very light texture which is okay if that's what you prefer, it just isn't NY Cheesecake and isn't what I wanted. I should have realized it wouldn't be dense since there are no extra egg yolks included in the recipe. My mistake.

I have never made this cheesecake, though it sounds absolutely amazing. Is there anyway I can convert this so as to make it a Peanut butter/chocolate cheesecake? I know the ratio of fats will have to be adjusted, but I’m just not savy enough to be able to figure that out in my own.

Revising:::::  I scaled the reciepe to serve 100 servings.  OMG 
 it was more like 1000.  Now I have so much cake.  Neighbors will love the holiday's.  . Cheesecake is phenomenal.  I have made cheesecake for years.  I would say this is the best one yet.  I do change it a bit.  I take about 1 -2 cups of sour cream add surgar till it taste good about 4 tablespoons  of sugar.  I bake cheesecake as directed remove about 5 min before it is complete.  I gently pour the sourcream mixture over cake and bake about 5-10 min longer.  It is a nice topping.  I think it was originally designed to cover the cracks for the novice baker but it adds another layer of flavor.  Awsome Reciepe as it is to.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this cheesecake step by step for my sister's cook out yesterday. This cheesecake was very creamy, fluffy, and smooth. I added cherry pie filling throughout my cheesecake then baked,  it was fantastic everyone loved it. I was skeptical about adding the milk and flour to the batter, but it was so little of it you do not taste it.  This is a very good cheesecake recipe. I made many cheesecakes in the past using almond extract, but I like the vanilla extract better.

I made this for a triple birthday and everyone flipped out - it was so good!  This was the first time I made a cheesecake that had ZERO cracks.  I used the same ingredients with the exception of cinnamon sugar graham crackers for the crust and enough of them to coat the bottom and halfway up the sides of the pan.   For the mixing/baking, I followed a combination of others' recommendations: ensure ingredients are at room temperature first; pre-bake crust for 6-10 minutes to dry it out (and yes, you need more butter, big deal..); only use mixer for cream cheese and sugar - all else stir just to incorporate; don't add vanilla and flour at the same time; wrap outside of pan with tinfoil to make water tight and place in large roasting pan with water filled to 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan; turn oven off after 60 minutes and leave door shut for 5-6 hours before moving to refrigerator.  I served this with some strawberry sauce on the side, an easy recipe I also found on this site.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made the base recipe so many times over the years without any changes, it really is my favorite. I've also found it to be a fantastic base cake for different variations. I've used it for chocolate, oreo, strawberry,  peanut butter & chocolate, mint chocolate, and passion fruit. With each of those it's taken a few small tweaks here and there but overall is fantastic recipe!

Love this cheese cake!!!! I use gluten free chocolate chip cookies, almond milk in place of regular and pilsbury gluten free flour. Sometimes mine cracks, but it's ok I just fill with a strawberry or raspberry glaze.

People can't get enough of this cheesecake.  I get more comments and requests for it than any other dessert.  It even gets compared to Cheesecake Factory.  Personally, I can't say I've had any cheesecake that can top this one.

I've made this a few times, by accident. The first time it was ok. I made it last year and it turned out horrible. I forgot  I used this recipe last year and tried it again today.  Followed the recipe exactly. Had to cook it for almost 2 hours in order for it to be cooked all the way through. It comes out with a gross custardy texture. I will definitely NOT make this again. So gross!

In order to keep cheesecake from cracking, cover the bottom and sides of your springform pan with aluminum foil (outside not inside). Then place pan in a roasting pan with 1" of water. It will never crack.

This is a good cheesecake and easy to make, but the crust was very bland. I would recommend adding cinnamon and sugar to it.

This recipe is a winner! I love it more than the Cheesecake Factory's original. I beat the sugar and cream cheese with a mixer and then incorporate the rest of the ingredients by hand using a wooden spoon. I always add water to the oven to give it a water bath. Turns out great everytime!

While it was baking I recalled using this recipe unchanged with identical results. Major cracks which I had to disguise with whipped cream for an event. Ok but I prefer the recipe I've used for years from Joy of Cheesecake

made this using my own homemade cream cheese and natural sugar. It came out wonderful! only thing is I didnt leave it in quite long enough in the oven, was a little soft in the center. the natural sugar gave it a lovely dark cream color.

Cake was dry and cracked.  Next time, I'll try a lower temp (probably 325 degrees for 45 min) and a water bath.

You will not be disappointed. No cracks, prefect constancy, absolutely delicious!!! 

I'm often asked by friends and family to make it again.

I used a little more graham crackers crumbs than called for to build up the sides (personal preference) and a few sprinkles on top (only for appearance). Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T.

My family absolutely loved this cheesecake. I added a caramel topping that really made it pop, but the cheesecake itself is creamy and delicious, and very simple to make. It does make quite a large cheesecake for a 9" springform though, so if topping, it may be a good idea to use a 10".

Sous vide! :)
176°F for 90 minutes in 8oz wide mouth Mason Jars for wonderful self serve cheesecakes!

We first tried the Chef Steps recipe. Unfortunately it was not a hit at our house. To my family the flavor of that recipe was off. So I decided to give this one a try. I halved this recipe and it made 12 individual servings on cheesecake. They were devoured! In the sous vide there's no concern of the cake cracking or not setting up right. They each turned out as good as anything we've ever bought. We will be making these often. I've tried making cheesecake before we bought our precision cooker, and all my attempts were failures. With our Anova Precision Cooker, Mason Jars, and this recipe - easy success.

I'm not the greatest cook. But we did follow this recipe exactly.  The texture is great.  It's just not our favorite cheesecake.  Crust was dry and we decided we like a sweeter cheesecake.

Excellent.I give this recipe 5 stars made  as is. I used the exact ingredients and proportions as listed in the recipe. I made sure all ingredients were room temperature. Followed preparation suggestions found in various reviews. and voila, a perfectly even picture worthy cake without cracks or cravices (picture attached). Here is what I did:
I used a mixer to mix the cream cheese and suger, then used the spatula to mix in rest the rest of the ingredients making sure not to over mix. I used a 10 inch tart pan with removable bottom and made sure to grease the edges as well as the bottom of the pan (once the cake was chilled, it slid out like butter). As nany recommended, I baked my cheesecake at 325 degrees farenheit for an hour. I turned of the oven, and left the cake in to cool for an hour refrigerating overnight afterward. I kept a baking tray with 1/4 hot water right underneath the cake pan like a waterbath while vsking and cooling (it kept my cake from cracking and the top came out looking like a mirror).  I also prepared a Supreme Strawberry Topping found on this site (preserved 1/3 of fresh strawberries to mix in with the other 2/3 in the sauce). It complemented the cake perfectly. Great recipe. Will definitely make again.

I am giving this cheesecake 5 stars because it was so easy to make once I read the reviews and followed the directions ! It is so moist and dense and just the perfect texture. I used pre crushed graham crackers and used 1 1/4 cups and 4 tbsp melted better . I think I might add some cinnamon or nutmeg and finely crushed nuts next time for more flavour . The actual cheesecake is perfect , I followed everything except the vanilla which I never measure . I would use a vanilla bean next time for more flavour and nice look . Some suggestions for toppings would be a ganache of melted chocolate and heavy cream or fresh fruit such as strawberries , mixed berries. I have made so many cheesecakes and I've got to say this is a winning recipe with the proper tricks . You do need to but it in a water bath . What I did was put an 8" inch springform pan into a larger 10" inch pan and then covered that in aluminum foil then proceeded with an inch of boiling hot water . I cooked the cheesecake for one hour exactly which I was a little skeptical of but I did as told and turned off the oven after an hour and left it in overnight , the next morning refrigerated and cling wrapped it . It is perfect . Thanks so much for an amazing recipe .

Full disclosure: I made one change and baked this in a water bath, which is how many other recipes are written. I'm not sure how much of an affect that had.

GREAT recipes. I left all ingredients as-is and it came out perfect! Also this was the first time a cheesecake I've made hasn't cracked, or sunken in after cooling. It was honestly beautiful. This will be
My go-to recipe, and I'll just modify with flavors when I'm in the mood.

I was a bit worried because one reviewer said his came out bland and without that characteristic cream cheese richness (he blamed the milk and flour I think), but this was restaurant quality.

Omit the milk and reduce the flour to 3 TBS.  Remember to use a water bath and spray the springform pan prior to baking to prevent cracks.  Cheesecake perfection!

I've made plenty of cheesecake, but this is the first time I can remember using milk. The consistency was pretty awful. In fairness I only let it set a few hours before serving. Perhaps it'll be better in the morning, but so far it was pretty awful.

Baking time is waaayyyy too long.  Began cracking with 25 minutes left to bake.  Still cooked an hour, as stated, and let sit in oven, as suggested.  Probably should have cooked for about 30 minutes, then removed.  Seemed more like a custard than a cheesecake.

I didn't follow the recipe entirely. I made use of the crust recipe i found in the comments (graham cracker crumbs, nuts, sugar, cinnamon) and I omitted the milk and flour and it turned out good. For the baking, I did it at 325 degrees fahrenheit for exactly 1 hour and 10 mins turned off the oven and left it there overnight before I took it out and put it in the fridge. It was perfect.

Turned  out amazing!!! The only thing is I had to add a little  more melted butter to the graham crackers for the crust for it to hold together. I will definitely be making this again!!!

This is honestly the best cheesecake recipe I've ever made. No alterations and it was perfect. I love to bake and cheesecake is one of my husbands favorites so I've made probably 30 different recipes. But I am no longer searching or trying new recipes. Printed this one. Put it in my recipe bible. It's that good. Really.

Fixing my review. When I first tried the cheesecake, it was soggy and very fragile. So I put it in the fridge. This morning, when I tried it, I was so shocked! It was DELICIOUS!!! I will DEFINITELY make this cheesecake sometime soon.

I love this recipe! I made it one other time and it cracked, so I took the advice of other reviews by: making sure all ingredients were at room temperature before mixing, different graham cracker crust recipe & water bath cooking technique. I also tried to make this in a regular pie pan the first time around, so followed the directions and used a spring form pan this time. I had no cracks and the actual cheesecake tasted better than any cheesecake I have ever tasted before. Even my picky father-in-law went back for seconds, complimenting that it was the best cheesecake he had ever had! Great recipe!

This is a good cheesecake and I got raves for it. I  made it exactly how the recipe said to.  I found it a bit dry and much less creamy than most cheesecakes I have baked. This is the first cheesecake where



Good cheesecake, guests liked it.  I followed recipe exactly, and found it looked great but was on the dry side.  I prefer a creamier cheesecake.

Made this as a raspberry swirl cheesecake. Excellent taste and texture. Used SCIOTA's crust recipe. It was very good but next time will bake the crust a little longer before adding the filling. Used bain marie with pans double-wrapped in aluminum foil. Delighted my friends with an Easter dinner surprise.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

First time cheesecake Baker.  Cracked while baking.  Not enough tips on the front end to prevent cracking while baking for the inexperienced cheesecake Baker.  I read the instructions and baked early enough to let sit.  Also rose above the height of the spring form pan around the edges.

I made it exactly as stated, and added 4 tsp lemon juice. It turned out perfect! I never opened the oven door for the entire 6 hour cool down,and turned it off after exactly one hour. This will now be my go to cheesecake!

I've made this cheesecake many times. It is perfect. You have to know that it will crack unless you take precautions. It isn't about overbearing/mixing. You need moisture while baking. Put a small baking pan with an inch or so of water on the rack below while baking. This will give moisture in the baking environment to prevent cracking. Works for me each time. This cheesecake is so so good.

I just took the cheesecake out of the oven & I was shocked! I have never made a cheesecake that was so horribly cracked. Just awful. This was the first time with this recipe. I have made cheesecake often in the past 30 years- my favorite recipes include Ina Garten's raspberry & Paula Deen's pumpkin. I thought I would try this as a basic recipe that obviously was popular and well liked by many. I followed it exactly. My oven in very even temperatured and I have an internal oven thermometer. I left it in for 5 hrs & it has huge craters not even cracks (I posted the photo). We will try it but it's definitely not going on the holiday table. Extremely disappointed

I think this is probably the worst cheesecake I've ever had. I followed the instructions letting it set for SIX hours and it did not on crack but it was wayyy to light a fluffy. I've made multiple cheesecakes but this one is probably the worse.

I would have given this five stars but made quite a few substitutions. Crust: 1 1/2 cups graham crackers, 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Made the recipe as is but omitted the milk and flour all together. Baked at 325 for 60 minutes. I followed other advice and let all my ingredients come to room temperature and didn't over mix. I greased sides and bottom of springform pan but did not do the water bath. Came out great! And no cracks! Ran a knife around the edge right when it was done baking then put back in oven to cool for an hour then cooled on counter for an hour then the fridge for 4 hours. Delicious!!!

I made this with all ingredients listed, but I added the lemon  zest and lemon juice of one lemon with a blueberry sauce topping. I baked it at 350 degrees for one hour, but I placed it in a water bath as many suggested. I let it cool for an hour then put it in the refrigerator overnight. It was perfect, no cracks, creamy, and not too sweet. Will definitely make it again.

My family loved it!
I used a 'deep' spring form pan so I think I  should've baked it at a lower temp for longer time  (it browned on the edges). I layered it with prailine candy and it was awesome! I'd certainly it again.

I made this for a friend's party and everyone loved it. I cheated by just buying graham cracker crumbs and didn't like the taste of them so next time I will put in the extra work and get actual graham crackers but the actual cheesecake was divine! The best homemade cheesecake I've ever tasted. This was better than my aunts recipe. I was thrown off when I saw the cheesecake rise the way it did during cooking but it went back down. It overflowed the pan and some even fell out into the oven. Lol. Overall a new staple in my kitchen and will be making again. I'm planning to use this recipe when I make my chocolate chip cookie cheesecake. Super excited!! Thank you for sharing

I read several of the ratings before made this cheesecake. So here is what I did: I beat the ingredients together with a folk!( I am sure this got the lumps out and produced a light texture), had most ingredients at room temperature, used only 1/2 cup of milk, 3/4 cup of sour cream and 2Ts of flour and sent a pan of water in the oven under the cheesecake when baking. The cheesecake was light in texture and tasted great! I think this is a forgiving recipe if you have a basic sense baking. this will be me go to recipe! Thanks to all the suggestions.

We really love this recipe! My husband loves whiskey cheesecake so I modify it based on some other reviews I've read. For the curst I use 1 1/2 cups ghram cracker crumbs, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup of melted butter for the crust. I think any more sugar is too sweet. 

When we make the whiskey cheesecake I add 1/2 cup of whiskey instead of milk, and we add 2 TBS of flour instead of the 1/4 cup the recipe calls for. I also decreased the sugar by a smidgen to 1 1/3 cup in the cheesecake it's self, and when I make a regular cheesecake  I used 1/2 cup of half and half.

I did not have a spring form round pan. So I used a 8x12 casserole dish. Made perfect cheesecake squares. Baked for 40 min. Then let cool in oven for 5 hours before I refrigerated it overnight.  I used vanilla cookies with white chocolate chips and caramel chips for the base. Made for my brother's birthday. Whole family enjoyed it. Paired with cherry topping and whip cream. 
Yes would make again.

I made it and took it to work and was surprised at how many compliments I got from co-workers saying it was the best cheesecake they had ever had and they wanted the recipe, and I am not a baker at all. it is easy to make and taste delicious. I think it became even better after chilling in the fridge over night.

I watched the video that assists this recipe, and noticed that they poured the batter all the way to the top of the spring form pan. I filled my pan up all the way, just as they did, and my cheese cake rose way too high. As it got taller and taller over the pan, the top of the cheesecake reached a more brown color, much darker than golden brown. I suspect this was because it was reaching closer to the top of the oven, and because I filled the pan up to the rim. I understood that cheesecake rises, but assumed that if I just do exactly as the video says, I can't fail.

I know this is the MILLIONTH rating, but this is THE cheesecake to make.  If you are going to make a cheesecake with 3+hours of your time, do it right.   I make the basic recipe and then add a ganache on half with the rest left plain.  I serve berries and glazes (lilikoi, mango and maple almond) on the side and I cannot tell you the rave reviews.  SO worth it.

FAT CONTENT IS KEY!   I have made this recipe several times now and always ended up with HUGE cracks. I have been tweaking this recipe and finally got the Perfect cheesecake!  What I did was lower the temp by 25 deg and used whole sour cream, not the light or fat free stuff, THEN I also ditched the whole milk and instead I used Half and Half. Now I have a perfectly smooth cheesecake and no slightly brownish edges from over cooking. I did leave it to cool in the oven for about 6 hours. Now I can present a perfect cheesecake without using fruit filling on top to hide the cracks!  - sorry, but I really dig cheesecake so this makes my day!

Halved this recipe(except for crust, of course) since I only had two packages of cream cheese and baked for 40 minutes. Did not over mix, only sat in the oven an hour after baking before moving to fridge. For this halved recipe, it turned out perfect!

I have steamed the cake and bake the last 10min in the same oven. Left in the oven for whole night and no bubbles or cracked??
The crust made from choc graham cracker and no milk added.

The consistency and texture of this cheesecake was perfect.  This will now be my base cheesecake recipe.  
I used it to make minis and a regular-sized cheesecake.  It is much better in the larger size because it retains the moisture.
Although it tastes good as written, here are the modifications I use:  3 fewer graham crackers, substituted for about a 1/3 cup finely chopped macadamia nut, sub vanilla bean paste for the vanilla extract and add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of Madagascar vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract.  Tastes amazing as a vanilla bean cheesecake or becomes a lemon cheesecake by adding a layer of lemon curd on top with some white chocolate curls.
I cook mine in a water bath to keep it moist.  Be sure to let the cold ingredients come almost to room temperature so your batter doesn't get lumpy.
Thanks for the great recipe!!!

First time I made cheesecake and it turned out amazing.  I did some research and made sure all my ingredients were room temp and did a water bath.  I tried it that night after chilling for four hours and it was lighter in texture.  I was sad at first until I tried it the next day.  PERFECT!  Lesson learned-needs to chill overnight and it gets heavier and creamier.

This is a very very good cheesecake recipe. The only changes I made were to the crust. It needs way more butter and a little sugar added.

This is the second time I've made this cheesecake and for both times it has came out amazing. It's the perfect balance between sweet and sour. Just make sure that EVERY cold ingredient is room temperature and that includes eggs, sour cream, cream cheese, milk etc. It usually takes about 2 hours maybe, I forgot to slice my cream cheese into cubes but microwaving saved time! I used my electric mixer throughout the entire process, after every addition, make sure that you make sure it is JUST MIXED and smooth. Don't over beat. My cheesecake has always come out with a little bit of air bubbles on the surface but never a crack. Follow the instructions of letting the cake sit for a few hours and bake no further. I recommend to not use a water bath for this recipe since it has a starch component in it. Other than that, this is delicious!!

I halved the recipe because that was all the cream cheese I had and I was making it in the heart shaped insert to my spring-form pan for Valentine's Day. Replaced sour cream with plain Greek yogurt for healthier as well. Served with strawberries frozen from our garden. Came out great!

This turned out wonderfully. The first time I've ever made a cheesecake, even went and bought a springform pan.  I used several tips from the comments section. I let the cream cheese and eggs get room temp, and only used the mixer for beating the cream cheese and sugar. After that I used a rubber spatula to minimally mix in the rest of the ingredients. I used a water bath and left the cheesecake in the oven for several hours after turning it off before letting it chill for about a day, not a single crack and the texture was great! I also incorporated a part from another recipe to make it a coffee cheesecake by replacing 1/4 cup of the milk with espresso, so I had a 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup espresso and it tasted amazing. The only problem I had was that the crust was a bit too soft for my liking, even though I baked it on its own for 8 minuted before hand. Maybe baking it a couple minutes longer?

This is my Goto Recipe for Cheesecake. I've used others, but keep coming back to this one.

I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. Maybe a tad more sugar maybe, but that's about it, everything else is prefect!

Such good cheesecake! I followed the directions to the tee and it came out wonderfully.  I made this for valentine's day so I added some pink food dye and did some marbling with the food dye on top.  The only thing that came out weird was the top of the cheesecake cracked.  Might be that I need to add more grease to the sides of the pan.  Other than that, just added some strawberries and whipped cream and it was perf (:

It was my first time making cheesecake for my boyfriend for Valentines day and I am glad I went with this recipe. Everyone loved it. Unfortunately, I was not able to taste it myself as I am vegan. Even without tasting it while making it, it still came out amazing. Everyone was socked that was not a store bought cheesecake. Will definitely make it again.

I made this cheesecake for our wedding cake and it is absolutely perfect. Cheesecake is my wife's favorite dessert and every time we have it in a restaurant she says, "yours is better." I've made it for her several times over the years and just put one in the oven for Valentine's day. I found Morena's review especially helpful and funny. ("Don't do XYZ or it will CRACK!") Her advice should be part of the recipe because it's perfect. Love this recipe!

I made this exactly the way it said, only I left out the flour. I did not use a springform pan, instead I used a disposable pie tin and it came out perfect. The only difference is the cake itself won't be as tall and you'll most like have to make two cakes. Also, I didn't use a water bath and my cake didn't crack or cave in whatsoever. I added chocolate chips to the batter to make it more flavorful. I'd let it chill in the fridge for at LEAST 5 hours before eating. Huuuuge difference in taste between the cake being lukewarm and cold!

I have made this twice now, both times to the letter of the recipe. I will keep coming back to it time and time again, it is so simple to make and sheer joy to eat with any sort of topping!

You have got to try it.

Let your eggs and cream cheese come to room temperature. I nuke my butter in a glass bowl, and mix into the graham cracker bits in the food processor. I also spray my pan liberally.

This time, I made 6 cupcake sized cheesecakes (in silicone cups) and still a (thinner) cheesecake, because I am bringing the little ones to share with my coworkers tomorrow.  (The cupcake ones were done in about a half hour. )

Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

I forgot to add the flour! But it still turned out incredible.  I did tweek it a little - add 1 vanilla bean and an extra egg YOLK only and for the milk 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream.  It is a delicious and simple recipe.   Tomorrow I'm going to top it off with a berry compote and a drizzle of Chocolate.

Part II - 24 hours later.  Know this first.  I have Fibro and yesterday was a particularly bad day.  I was using Lamaze breathing techniques to get me through the electric shooting nerve pain.  I almost went to the hospital.  Infact I grabbed the keys twice.  But I though I would just "breathe and walk" my way through the pain and finish the cake off.  So GUESS WHAT?...I also forgot the SOUR CREAM!!!!  uGH!  I noticed that late lastnight when I put the cake(s) in the fridge.  
So, this morning, I whipped up 2 (8 oz) pkg of cream cheese with one cup sour cream, 1 tablespoon lemon juice (and zest) and 1 tablespoon vanilla and about 3/4 cup  powdered sugar.  Then I spread it on top and put it back in the fridge.  IT  TASTES GREAT!!!  Just a 2 textured thing, but it's still yummy.  I'm going to top 1/2 with a fruit compote and the other half with Torani Dark Chocolate Sauce.  #anythingcanbefixed!

its easy to make.  don't forget to grease your pan so it wont crack, put an aluminum foil at the bottom of the pan and on top as well. i didnt follow the "leave it for 5 hours to cool" as my cousins are very anxious to taste it but instead i left it in the oven for 2 hours then 3 hours in the fridge. this is a plain cheesecake so if you want to make it special you can add some compote or marmalade. my family liked it a lot so will defo make it again

The first time that I made it, I read other reviews so I added 1/4 tsp pure lemon extract and a pan of water on the lowest rack. I made sure all my ingredients were room temp before starting. It came out of the pan easily and not one single crack on it! Thank you to all the cooks who share their tips. I have made it 3 times since then and it is creamy and delicious!

i have made this cheesecake several times, and it used to happen that it always cracked. My oven is a gas one and i s hard to get temperature correctly. However, i have substituted the milk and flour for a cup of heavy whipping cream and its much better. Although it is a little harder to whisk ingredients, the final result will be better

I made this exactly as directed.  It was still runny in the middle,  but still tasted good.   It would be better without a graham cracker crust.   I prefer my cheesecake without it, but it was otherwise good.

I followed the recipe and directions exactly and it turned out wonderful.  I wish I had read the reviews closer as I may have mixed it a bit too much so it raised quite a bit.  I left it sit in the oven and it fell and cracked a bit but  I made a raspberry sauce and covered it. I took it too a party and everyone raved over how beautiful and delicious it was! This is now my go to cheesecake recipe--Thank you for sharing!

I consider myself  a amature baker. But I've made this cheesecake in chololate,lemon, pumpkin,plain, swirled in fruit pie filling before baking and who knows what else. Would not try another recipe.   Oh yes mint choloate!

I make this frequently! Some changes I've made is I've used chocolate chip cookies instead of Graham's for the crust. I've used almond mild, or coconut mild and gluten free flour all these changes have proven to still turn out a wonderful cheese cake always requested buy my friends and family! I do get cracks some times, but it's varies maybe it's because I mix it too much?! Idk, because it's not consistent why I get crack and it still taste delicious so i.e. Gotten over my pride about the cracks when they do show up!!!

yaaaaaaas cake! made this for the first time with a few tweaks from the other reviews that i read on here. I used a water bath, only used 2 tablespoons of flour (instead of the 1/4 cup ) and for the crust I used 10 graham crackers, and an entire sleeve of DoSiDo's Girl Scout Cookies, oh and 3 tablespoons of butter. all mixed in a food processor to make it super fine.It's a gift and a curse that my daughter is a Daisy scout because i have CASES AND CASES of Girl Scout cookies in my living room, so I think I might make variations of this recipe with different GS cookie crusts. Thin Mint crust...Samoa crust...this is why i'm still fat haha.  after I greased the pan and pressed in the crust, i sprinkled on cinnamon, nutmeg and lemon zest before pouring in the batter. i also added lemon zest to the batter. i took someone else advice and cooked it at 225 degrees for 3 hours and 40 minutes, turned the oven off and opened it to vent a little faster, then closed it and let it sit for 5 more hours.  Its pretty friggin phenomenal .

It was perfect! Wouldn't change a thing. The only thing I did do was lower the temp to 325 degrees because my oven runs a little hotter than most and I cooked it in a water bath. After it was finished a cracked my oven door a tad to let it cool gradually so it wouldn't crack. It got rave reviews.

Used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.
Bake 325 for 1 hour and then left in oven for 5 hours. It did crack a bit on top but it didn't matter. My guests loved it and asked for the recipe. I served it with a raspberry sauce I made. Will definitely make it again.

Tasted okay -- I'd've preferred more sugar and more vanilla in the filling; it was too egg-y a taste.  Crust was pretty bland, as well.  There is no way this cheesecake needs to bake for a hour; 45-50 minutes is more than enough, and I would lower to 325 instead of 350.  One hour at 350 gives HUGE cracks.

This is the best cheesecake recipe I've followed thus far on my cheesecake journey. Thank you for posting it. I changed a couple of things: switched the crust from graham cracker to Oreo, and I substituted plain Greek for sour cream. Also, I used a water bath, left in the oven about 10 mins longer than the recipe, and left in the turned off oven for 3 hours before putting into the fridge. The texture was great and the top didn't crack.

This was really easy to make. I never made a cheesecake before. I made it four times already. First time, I followed the recipe exactly, without any changes. The cheesecake was yummy, exactly how I would think NY Cheesecake taste like at bakeries or restaurants. However, the side was burnt and the top cracked. It still tasted great! After reading others' reviews and recommendation, I made the following "technical" modifications. The subsequent cheesecakes were PERFECT!  The changes made are: Cream cheese, eggs, and other ingredients were allowed to come to room temperature. Made sure creamcheese and sugar were thoroughly mixed prior to adding any other ingredients. I greased the side of the pan as well. I pre-baked the crust before the filling. I used water bath to bake it. While some says to use hot water in the water bath, I used faucet water. I also baked it pre-heat oven at 325 degree. After an hour later, I turned the oven off and left the cake in the oven for another 2-3 hours.  I also made sure the cake was little bit underdone before the oven is turned off. The cake will continue to cook and then begin cooling. Then I refrigerated the cake for another 4-5 hours.  I also used a pie can to bake this cheese cake, cutting the recipe in half. It worked perfect as well. The final product was a half size, not as tall. However it was a perfect size. I was careful in cutting the cheesecake, as I were cutting a pie. This takes some time but was worth it. I will bake this cheese

This is simply the best cheesecake recipe I have ever tried. It has a light and creamy texture. It literally melts in your mouth! I left the cake in for only an hour and a half after baking because I needed my oven. It didn't crack. Made hubby a special dinner! He loved it!

I give this 5 stars for flavor and texture! I used a scant cup of sugar because most desserts are too sweet for my taste, so it still tasted plenty sweet to me. Crust: Omitted the sugar, added cinnamon, and used a 1/3 cup of butter.  I wish I knew why my cheesecake always cracks, but I'll keep trying and reading other reviews and maybe I'll figure it out (I added a pan of hot water on a lower rack, but still, it cracked).

Barely changed a thing. Just added a bit more butter to graham cracker crust to help form it a bit more. (I used almost a whole stick and crust was great- maybe will use 3/4 of a stick next time.) Otherwise, made it exactly as recipe states for ingredients. Of note, I don't have time to leave things in my oven that long. I baked until it was done. Let it cool down just a bit on the counter for about 15 minutes and popped it right into fridge. Yes, I sure did. Guess what? It looks fine. No crack (I did grease bottom and sides of springform pan.) And we even had a piece about 5 hrs later. It's even better on day 2 later! Creamy, soupy cheesecake to me is like the instant box kind. This is the real, rich, stick-to-your teeth kind that I had in New York! Forgot to add that after slowly adding the eggs one by one on "stir" on my mixer, I then mixed the rest by hand with a wooden spoon to avoid overmixing per another suggestion. Worked great. I wouldn't change one ingredient on this recipe except adding a bit more butter to the crust until your liking for texture.

Great taste, but an hour at 350 degrees caused the top to caramelize, crack and toast. Would highly recommend watching closely at around 45min to prevent.

It was good. No doubt. But it just didn't have the heavy "cheesecake" flavor to me. But my family died over it.

The only thing was I think that the temperature/time stated to bake it for is too high.  Mine came out slightly burnt and I followed the directions exactly.  Maybe my oven is hotter than most? (It's electric)

This recipe is amazing. I didn't change anything- I'm sure I made some mistakes but it was gone within two days so I guess it was family approved. I will make this again and again! Thank you For the creator- whoever you are.

Delicious and authentic!  Be sure to completely chill before serving.  I served mine initially premature (not fully chilled) and it was just ok.  Later in the evening I tried it again fully chilled and it was WONDERFUL!!

I  didn't change anything with this recipe and it turned out well. I left the baked cake in the oven overnight and it didn't crack at all. I made a blackberry topping but I poured it on the cake before I stored it in fridge for 12 hours, which made the crust soggy. Won't make this mistake again!

I'm not a baker. When I try to use a new baking recipe the results are usually less than satisfactory. This is absolutely the best cheesecake ever!!! I followed the recipe exactly and left it in the oven for 6 hours. It wasn't very complicated and even a person who doesn't bake very often could pull it off :)
Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This cheesecake was amazing!!!  The only change I made was adding 2 tablespoons of sugar to the graham cracker crumbs and an extra tablespoon of butter. Otherwise followed the instructions. I did like other reviewers recommended and only used the mixer to cream the cream cheese and sugar together and otherwise mixed everything by spoon. I put a pan of water on the bottom rack underneath the cheesecake and did not open the oven as instructed in the recipe. Came out perfect!!

Alright, I know, you shouldn't rate something 5 stars if you didn't make the recipe to a T. I am sorry. I rated it 5 stars due to the amazing recipe itself, along with outstanding tips & tricks by other reviewers. 

The adjustments I made to the cheesecake itself was I only used 1/4 cup of milk and 2 TBSP of flour. This only effects the consistency, not the taste (so much). I like a more creamy, dense cheesecake so that is what I adjusted. 

I also followed the guidance of others on here of using 1.5 cups of crushed graham crackers, 1/4 cup (maybe a smidgen more) of melted butter, and 1/4 cup of sugar to make the crust. I didn't pre-bake the crust or anything like that and it turned out crunchy and all together.

I baked at 325 for 1 hour and 10 minutes. I turned the oven off, removed cheesecake from water bath and left the door closed for probably another 45 minutes.  I removed the cheesecake and allowed to stand at room temperature (in microwave) for another two hours, prior to refrigerating.

It turned out amazing. 

Tips, as some others have stated: 

1. Double or triple wrap springform pan in heavy duty aluminum foil.
2. Ensure the water bath has boiling water in it prior to placing cheescake in.
3. Do not overbake, because when you jiggle the cake it looks to wiggly in the middle.  Cheesecakes still look that way, even when they are done, at least while they are hot and haven't set completely. 
4. Just use a stand mixer to mix the cream cheese and sugar. After that, han

I decided on this recipe after reading several positive reviews. The only change I made was to add a flour based crust, not graham cracker. When I placed it in the oven, I took a look at the poor reviews and really started to worry. How could 1 hour in the oven do the trick? I was afraid it would come out a sloppy mess and I was expecting 10 people for Christmas dinner! But I stayed true to the recipe (and the advice of the first commentator) and just left it in the oven for several hours. Actually it was in the oven overnight because I had forgotten about it! Getting to the point, it was delicious! Everyone, even the small kids, loved it. It didn't crack, nor was it dried out at all.  So it seems like an easy, fool proof recipe - and I can't wait for an excuse to make it again!

I have made this recipe about 10 times... Each time it comes out perfectly! This is the most popular dessert at each party. I am still working on getting it to stop the slight cracking in the middle, but in the meantime, I just cover it up with a can of cherry pie filling.  ;-)

This is very very good. I have made it several times. The only addition to this recipe is that i accidentally added way more graham crackers and butter for a thicker crust, and i really like it that way. Let it sit after turning off the oven and i really did make it to where it did not crack.

This is an amazing recipe. It is so light and easy to eat. I made it for Christmas so I changed the milk to egg nog, added some nutmeg and a little rum to make it a egg nog cheese cake and everyone loved it. At thanksgiving I did a pecan pie topping on this recipe too.

Fantastic. I did 1.5 cups graham crackers and a couple tablespoons or more of butter to coat them. I baked the crust for 4 mins first. I cooked the remainder as it said and it cracked on top, I wonder if it's because my cream cheese was still a little too firm and needed to sit out more to reach room temp. But the flavor and consistency were very good. I had lots of compliments at Christmas when I served it with raspberries on top and a homemade raspberry sauce (recipe also from this site). I will definitely make this again.

I have made this about eight times and it comes out perfectly without exception. Yesterday my sons requested that I put smooth peanut butter in half of it and cinnamon in the other half. I dotted about 8 teaspoonfuls of peanut butter all over one side and pushed them down in the batter until completely submerged. For the cinnamon side, I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and then used a fork to lightly mix it into the batter. My sons thought this was my best ever. I also used The suggestions of two other reviewer's and added 1/2 c sugar, 1 teas cinnamon and 1/2 teas nutmeg to the crust. It needed 3/4 of a stick of butter to hold it together. Also, after baking one hour, I only let it cool for two hours in the oven, then ran a knife around the edge before refrigerating. Perfection again!

I made the recipe with no changes.  It came out looking gorgeous, but it is much too custardy.  It is NOT New York style cheesecake to be sure.  If folks are used to those no bake mixes, it might be delicious but to those that know real cheesecake, it's just not that good.  I will NOT be making this again.

We made this for christmas dessert the night before. Everyone said that this was one of the most delicious Cheese cakes that they had ever tasted. The only change I made was to add 2 more tbsp of butter to the graham Cracker Crumble. It just made this a tad more sticky and form the sides. I had wish that i had let the milk and the Cream Cheese warm as i had to mix a bit long and still had small remnants of undissolved Cream cheese about. I was fearful this extra mixing would impact the end result. However it was really Awesome. Taste And Texture. 
We sliced Strawberrys on the top because we ran out of time for the strawberry coating.   Try it!

I have made this recipe three times now, it is delicious.  I do have an issue with presentation.  Mine gets very brown on the top and despite my best efforts at preventing cracks, it happens during the cooling process.  It still tastes superb though, and no one ever complains how it looks.  I just wish it looked as good as the picture or as good as it tastes.

Wonderful cheesecake! Just one issue with the recipe as written: putting the flour into a liquid batter is difficult as you end up with lumps that you have to overmix, thus ruining the consistency of the cheesecake. Add the flour at the beginning with the sugar and it's much easier.

Tasted too sour the day after but 2 days later it tasted really good.
Don't overheat as it will make it have the wrong texture and it will crack. Only mix till it's smooth. If you overcook, or don't grease the pan, it will crack. 
Bake for exactly 60 mins then turn off oven and leave it alone in the oven.
All ingredients should be at room temperature.

This is the most amazing cheesecake I've ever tasted, and I've eaten a lot of cheesecake! I followed the recipe to the letter and the taste, consistency, and color were perfect. My company was raving about it and are still talking about it! Mine did crack a little on top but I didn't care. I served mine with warm cherry compote on the side for those who wanted it. I will make this again and again!

I give this a 4 because I did have to follow other suggestions of increasing the butter for the crust.  The filling itself is definite 5 star!!  I used this for the filling and then did muffin sized "cakes" .  For the muffins I took the additional butter recommendation and used another recipe as a guide on the cooking time.  Had tons of left over batter but not enough for a spring form pan, and didn't have a mini one, so used a square cake pan.  This time used 2 TBL of butter as directed.  The crust is all crumbly and can't serve it.  I cut back the baking time to 45 minutes since it was a smaller pan, and left it in the oven like everyone said, while I ran an errand.  Came back and the top was browned but not cracked.  Done a little too long but the filling itself is definitely 5 stars!!!  Someday I'll try this in a springform pan.

This is a great recipe.  I followed it exactly, except I did use a water bath and just made the crust as directed on the box of graham cracker crumbs.  I'd never seen a cheesecake recipe with flour and I was worried about it, but it was fantastic.  It baked up firm and thick and cheesy.  When done I took it from the water bath and put it back in the oven to cool, only left it in the oven 2 hours, cracking the door after the 1st hour, then out of the oven altogether as I needed to go to bed.  Will definitely make it again.

I made exactly as noted. It was PHENOMENAL!
My oven rapid cooled and it did crack, but not the recipe's fault. I'll fix.
 Question though, can you do two (2) cakes at once?

I made this cheesecake and it's terrific!  I did use a water bath and wrapped my springform pan in a crockpot liner; however, I followed the rest of the instructions exactly.  Came out perfect! No cracks!

This recipe was great I didn't trust it at first but I loved it.  Only thing beware this in no way fit into a 9-in springform pan.  The top puffed up way over which caused it to get too brown, but I cut the top off to even it out and it was delicious!!!

I made this cheesecake the first time as per directions and found that the cake almost overflowed out of my pan. The second time I made it, I used a water bath. I baked the cheesecake at 350F for 1 hour, turned off the oven and let it sit inside for another hour without opening the door. I found I could make a thicker cheesecake this way and could use more of the mixture. There was a lot left over the first time I could have made a second cheesecake with it.

I also use almond milk in this recipe and there's no difference in taste or consistency.

Perfect cheesecake. I leave the milk out as I accidentally did it the first time I ever made it and it turned out perfectly. I live at 9000 ft and cannot seem to keep it from cracking but it always tastes great.

Over beating didn't effect the cracks for me.
I usually over beat the batter to make sure it's smooth.
The key to no cracks is the water bath.

Definitely will make this again! The taste was AWESOME! i put a little too much graham cracker crust on the bottom b/c i miscalculated what was meant by the 15 crackers. i thought they mean 15  of the whole big cracker sheets. which is basically double what it should have been.

 also i dont know what i did wrong b/c i followed this to the letter--but mine DID crack. even after leaving in the oven to cool. it started cracking before its time in the oven cooling was even up so at that point i just put it in the fridge.

This cake is spectacular! Creamy, rich, decadent...I followed the directions precisely. The top of the cake DID crack, however that was easily concealed with cherry pie filling on top.  I also added 1/4 cup of sugar to the crust, just to add a bit more taste to it. Now I am going to try to make a chocolate marbled cheesecake by adding 1/2 a cup of cocoa powder to the filling, and top it with strawberries! Very excited! (I am also going to try using a water bath to see if I can't get rid of the cracking) ANOTHER TIP: Do NOT overbeat or overcook this recipe, and if you think that you have overbeaten it, tap the bowl of filling on the countertop a few times to release those air bubbles. Do NOT open the door while the cheesecake is cooking, simply set the timer for 60 minutes, and turn the oven off when it is done, leaving the cheesecake in the oven 6 more hours. Chill overnight for best results.

I've used this recipe for the past 6-8 years - and it's perfect every time.  I make this cheesecake recipe exactly as it's written.  (Sometimes I add a tsp of lemon extract for extra flavor).  I never skimp on the quality of products I use - I made this cake today and used a store-brand cream cheese, and it was A.W.F.U.L.  The texture and flavor were all wrong!  Lesson learned - use only the best ingredients!

This is the best cheesecake recipe I have used, because of its perfect texture and taste, but also because of its user friendly flexibility!  Sometimes I add caramel sauce to it before I bake it and it sinks in and when I cut it there are beautiful veins of caramel inside.  I make this a few times a year, and its never let me down.  I recommend this to any and all bakers, especially those who fear cheesecake making, this is as close to no-fail as it gets...

I made last Saturday and it turned out great.  I always read reviews for suggestions, and I changed the crust per reviews, and took flour down to 2 TBS , did the water bath and made sure ingredients were room temp.  Cooked at 325 for 1hr 10 mins.  Only had time to cool in the oven for 2.5 hours, then have to move it to the fridge.  It was beautiful, no cracks.  I let it chill overnight and it was creamy and really delicious!  My first cheesecake, I will use this recipe again and again!!  I did have trouble transferring from bottom of springform pan, wish there was suggestions to make this easier!

This was by far the best cheesecake I have ever made or even tasted, ever! My husband gave it a 10/10!  I used the water bath, triple wrapped the pan in heavy duty foil, and let it cook in the oven at 325 for 60 minutes and resisted the urge to open the oven for 3 hours and it was enough.  The only thing I thought I might improve was the crust - it was a bit soggy - so next time I may try putting a pan of water on the rack below and pre baking the crust longer.  I did use pecans, cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg in the crust, and it tasted great.  I was so proud of this cheesecake!  Thanks to all those who posted reviews, I followed all the tips and it came out great!

Fantastic!! So moist and creamy! I baked the cheesecake in a water bath for 1 hour 15 minutes, shut the oven off and left it in the closed oven for another hour. (I did not have time to leave it in the oven for the recommended 6 hours) I then pulled it out and allowed it to cool on the counter for about an hour and a half before putting it in the fridge to chill! It was amazing! And no cracks!

This is a very easy and excellwmt excellent recipe. I am a first time baker but thiascheesecake came out beautiful without any cracks and evenly baked. The only change i made was waterbath and the temperature. 
I baked at 150 degree Celsius for 90 mins and let it cool in oven for another 4 to 5 hours without opening the door.
It was fully set till then.
Should try this recipe definitely!

Followed the recipe as written, but did the water bath during the baking time. After cooling for five hours, I removed from oven with no cracks and a perfect color and texture. Tastes amazing!

Made this for Thanksgiving and it came out tasting GREAT! I followed the instructions to a "T", but mine did crack after the oven was off for about half an hour. Not a big deal for me, but I may try a water bath next time like other users suggested just to try.

First time making cheesecake and this recipe was awesome.  I made the recipe as is and will definitely make it again.  One note I used 1 and 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs and that was the right amount.  Mine cracked but I think it's because I used non-stick spray instead of crisco on my pan.

I have made this numerous times and people have said it's the best cheesecake they've ever had. Definitely let the cream cheese and sour cream sit until its room temperature so that the batter isnt lumpy. I also dont touch the oven while the cheesecake is cooking to prevent cracking.

Excellent! I made a cheesecake for the first time and this one turned out perfect! Everyone loved it! I followed recipe and everything was great and no cracking. I added an apple topping and made caramel. We enjoyed our caramel apple cheesecake on Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe made for my family this Thanksgiving came out great. Follow it to a T with just there exceptions one stick of butter in stead of two tablespoons. Also add a lil cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. To the cheesecake batter into add the zest of one lemon along with the vanilla. Still came out awesome.

Mine are baking...I'm so excited. The only thing I added was a couple Tbsp of lemon zest and fresh lemon juice. The batter tasted awesome. The lemon added a brightness to the batter! Ty so very much! I'll let you know how they came out!

This is by far the best cheesecake recipe. I made the cheesecake filling exactly as is-did not change a single thing and it turned out absolutely perfect and creamy. However I did jazz up the crust a bit by adding cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar. As for the cake cracking- mine did not crack or sink at all. I added a pan of water in the bottom of the oven (so not an actual water bath)- this aloud for it to create enough moisture to prevent cracking without the worry of water leaking in the cake pan. I did as the recipe said and tured oven off after baking and left in oven for 6 hours. If your cake cracked then you either over beat the filling or did not add a pan of water. Took this to thanksgiving and everyone raved that it was the best they ever tasted. Thanks for the amazing recipe.

This cheesecake is the first one I've made that didn't crack and it tasted wonderful!  I did add a teaspoon of homemade vanilla because it's homemade. Definitely going down as a yearly addition to our Thanksgiving dessert.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. I also read some of the tips and tricks to help it not to crack. I think I may have over beaten my cream cheese mixture, because mine did crack but the flavor was exactly what I was hoping for! Awesome recipe! I will keep trying to get it with no cracks but will enjoy eating along the way. I served mine with fresh blueberries but most everyone just wanted it plain! Rave reviews from all! Thank you!

PROS: The ingredients list is spot on. 

CONS: The cooking method and time are so wrong!

I planned to make this cheesecake for Thanksgiving. I made it the day before, so I had the whole next day to cook other dishes. I opened the oven, after letting it sit in there for 6 hours. It was BROWN, cracked, and completely solid. I was devastated! That meant going back to the grocery store in the madness right before Thanksgiving, and scrambling to get it done the next day. It turned out perfect, though, when I used a water bath and cooked it for only 45 minutes. Also, no need to leave it in the oven for 6 hours!! Just let it sit in the waterbath with the oven door open for maybe 30 minutes, to cool down a bit, and then stick the cheesecake in the fridge.

FANTASTIC !! this recipe is literally always a hit. Sometimes I put crushed Oreos in the batter or swirl it with other flavorings. The recipe itself as a core is great BUT I cannot get over how much is left over after pouring that one 9 inch cheesecake to bake.  Like literally there is an in Normas bowl full of cheesecake batter left over that I mixed all from scratch with this recipe only to make one small 9 inch cheesecake. So I'm kind of puzzled as to why it yields so so much. Am I the only one? I mean it turns out great every time. I just can't get over how much is left over   So I try to cut the ingredients in half or something. The

I don't add the flour, but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. I'm a heathen who uses store bought/pre-made graham cracker crust and this recipe will fill about 3-4 of those, for the curious ones. 

Everyone fights over the cheesecake when I bring it over to family events and I've never felt more powerful. Definitely can be used as a bribe if you need something.

I made this cheesecake when I was in culinary school. I had to make it for over 700 people. It was the AMBROSIA of the day.
Fast forward 4 years later, I got married two years ago but never made it for my husband until yesterday 11/19/2016. HE ATE IT FOR BREAKFAST  today   and said you can make this EVERY DAY.

I think I WILL MAKE CHRISTMAS PRESENTS  THIS YEAR!!

It was easy and fun making this cake, but I haven't tried eating it yet, it is still in the oven, waiting for it to cool. When it was done baking, the cake rose up over the cake pan, and when I turned off the oven an hour later I found that It went down about an inch and a half and cracked. I followed the recipe and kept it in the oven and didn't open it, I don't know why it cracked.

I really loved the recipe itself, as far as the ingredients and taste goes, however, please note that this makes a LOT of cheesecake mixture! I accidentally over filled my 9 inch crust pan and had lots of cracks. :( There's actually enough in this recipe to make 3 pies. I wish this was noted in the original recipe.

The cheesecake tastes great but it rose an inch above the pan and puffed  up like a souffle but sunk in the middle. I followed all the tips except for the water bath.  I did double the amount of butter used in the crust as well.

First time making cheesecake and this recipe was absolutely amazing. It is light, creamy and just the right amount of everything. My cheesecake did not crack, which I was super happy about. I think one of the hardest things about making this recipe is not being able to cut it immediately! I left mine in the oven for 6 hours after turning the oven off, I also did a water bath in the bottom (I think next time I will line it with more foil because the water seeps in a little), also I would like to thank the commenter who altered the crust! You can really taste the cinnamon goodness adding it to the graham crackers. Overall a superb recipe!

The graham cracker crust was a bit dry and didn't hold together .  I doubled the butter and this helped a bit.  Next time I would use a different crust recipe. 

The cheesecake itself was creamy and very tasty!  Overall a great recipe.

This was my first time making this recipe, so most of the error is on me. But I followed the directions word for word and my cheesecake was horrible. I ended up over whipping it and it rose like a souffle to the point it cracked before it was done cooking. I did not open the oven and left it in there after I turned the heat off and it overcooked. I will try this recipe again and use the suggestions in the reviews.

The cheesecake cracked. 
Reading one of the reviews, it might have been due to beating sugar with cream cheese a little longer. But this wasn't warned in the directions...
I'll try to bake it again some other day.

Recipe as written - The best cheesecake recipe!  Moist, creamy, delicious!  And first time my cheesecake didn't crack!  Read some reviews and made modifications 2nd time - just as great!  Made the crust with sugar and cinnamon - added some mini chocolate chips to the cheesecake - yummy!  So, as is or tweaked to your liking, this is the recipe to use!

Alright I cheated and purchased pre-made graham crust and recipe had more than would fit in little container but turned out amazing! 

I stirred everything with a wooden spoon to prevent over beating mixture. I also added eggs one at a time mixing in between. After cooking I let the cheese cake sit in the oven for two hours to let it naturally cool. I than placed in refrigerator over night to let it form and get firm. It did not crack at all and browned just perfectly!

Stupid good. Better than restaurant quality. Ours cracked which was my fault but it was still ridiculously awesome. It's now a favorite. Highly recommend.

Update: I've made this 4-5 times over the past few years. Always comes out great. Really love it. 

I forget, 100% of the time, to take it easy in the mixing as some reviews suggest. I do exactly as the recipe suggests and it's the best cheesecake ever. Oh, and it cracks every time. I guess I can try harder to prevent that but I don't see why it's a big deal...but the last time I made it I left it in the oven for 5 hours and it still had a crack...but was still awesome.

This was an amazing cheesecake!!! My family loved it.....definitely will make it again! I followed the ingredients exactly as written.  All I changed as far as baking goes was to wrap the bottom of the springform pan in foil and placed it in a water bath,  and baked at 300 degrees.  I baked it at a lower temp because 350 seemed too high for the water bath.  For anyone concerned about the use of flour in the batter I assure you this cake was FANTASTIC, rich, creamy, and not "cakey" at all.

Was really excited about this recipe because my cheesecakes always end up cracked. This one is no different will try to make it a few more times.  Cake tastes delicious. Nothing some chocolate and strawberries can't hide.

I followed the recipe.  I still got a crack. No One Cared!!! everyone loved the cake.  They loved that it wasn't the gooey, dense, sickly sweet  type of pastry that gets served as cheescake.  I will work on the non-cracking goal, but heck, covered with a lil fresh fruit or garnish of choice, great reviews.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out a beautiful, delicious and perfect (even with a crack on the top I thought it was perfect) cheesecake.  I added a homemade raspberry sauce and it was out of this world!

My family absolutely Loved this recipe!  Only thing I would change is bake time. I baked mine for 1hr 20mins. It was still soft in the middle. Next time I'll keep it in a little longer. It was nice and creamy, perfect mix of cream cheese and pumpkin.  I will definitely be adding this to my favorites list. :)

So i didn't habe a spring form pan so i used a regular pie dish.
Turns out there was way too much batter so i made two! Totally worth it. Made the second one with chocolate grahams and put chocolate chips on top. Oh muy goodness they both came out amazing

I have made this cheesecake 3x's and twice it turned out perfect! The third time it cracked and I didn't know what I did wrong, I'm going to try some of the tips that y'all put. This cheesecake has been a BIG hit for everyone that ate it, my daughter in law has requested it for her birthday, so that's what she's getting! It's a must try for anyone that wants a delicious, creamy cheesecake. In fact I had to borrow the pan the first time I made it and knew after that, that I was going to be making it more that I went and bought my own pan.

This is the creamiest cheesecake I ever made !  
it turns out great every time I  make it.  

I use some pure vanilla bourbon extract that really boosts the flavor and I also add cinnamon and sugar to my graham cracker crust.

I enjoyed making it, as it was so easy.  Everyone loved it!
The only minor change I made was to the crust.  I used only 1 &  1/2 cups graham crackers & 6 tablespoons of butter.
Suggestion:  Ensure all of  your cold ingredients are at room temperature before mixing.

This was my very first cheesecake making experience. The recipe was easy to follow, and the cheesecake was delicious. My  coworkers even raved about it. I used a water bath, per a friends recommendation. It was on moister side, which I prefer.  It was a little fluffy(?) for lack of better word. It wasn't super dense like some cheesecakes. This may have been because I over-beat the cream cheese. Regardless, I thought it was perfect. I think density and moisture preferences probably vary person to person. ;)

Okay very good recipe, but when making the crust i found that i had to use a whole stick of butter instead of just 2 tablespoons? So just be prepared to use a whole stick just in case. 
Also something that made this recipe 100× better was I added a whole lemons worth of lemon zest and juiced the whole lemon and let me tell you, it was super good. 
Also this recipe seemed to be enough for 2 cheesecakes with more to spare? just keep that in mind i suppose, because i ended up making two. Other than that, good recipe :)

This cheesecake is THE BEST EVER.  It's not terribly difficult; anyone who loves baking should find it simple to make.  The end result will have your company thinking that you spent all day in the kitchen.  If you appreciate great cheesecake, this is the one !!!!!

My very first attempt at a cheesecake.  I agree with Morena. If this recipe has failed, it is your fault.  I have no experience with cheesecake and this one turned out to be phenomenal! The only thing that was a pain was spreading the graham crackers up the sides of the pan.  But that is it!!!!  Loved it.

The only thing I did different was put my graham cracker crust all the way to top of pan. That way when it pulled from the edge it wouldn't crack!!!!! It looks gorgeous. And tastes just as good!!!!

I have done it about 6 times because everybody loves it!  Even though I leave it 6-7 hrs in the oven it always cracks. But it's not a big deal, I make a whip cream frosting and decorate it. Also I make raspberry or strawberry drizzle and yum!!!

I made this just as the directions stated and it came out very good. I used blueberry topping and it was delicious. I like that you only use a little bit of sugar because I really don't like things that are over sweet. I really didn't think you needed extra sugar after putting the blue berries on it anyway.

I used a graham cracker crust recipe that is really easy. 1 pkg graham crackers, 2/3 cup sugar, 1 stick of butter and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I followed the rest of the recipe as far as the ingredients go but I took into account all the baking tips in the reviews and came up with this: wrapped the springform pan in foil and then submerged in a water bath, cracked the oven door and let cool for 6 hours before refrigerating, and once in the refrigerator put a plate on top of the cake to prevent drying.

This was my first time ever making homemade cheesecake from scratch. I followed the recipe exactly. Made it for my mother-in-law for her birthday as a last minute request.   Everyone LOVED it. I did not realize how long it takes for a cheesecake to set so I did't have time to cool the cake overnight or even a few hours.  We actually ate it out of the oven, still a bit warm and it was yummy! Even better the next day, cooled.  I plan to try adding almond extract the next time I make it as I read in one of the reviews, just to try a different flavor.  I did use one of the hints I read from other reviews and put a pan of water on the bottom rack while baking and my cake did not crack.

Taste is ok, texture is way off. One would be better off using the basic New York Cheesecake recipe. Water baths work great.

Followed recipe almost exactly, only reduced cream cheese by a quarter and the filling was still almost too much. Taste was great but the cake cracked despite following other reviewer suggestions (such as greasing the pain and using hot water bath and leaving cake in turned off oven for various hours). Covered the cracks with mango coulis and presto...it looked and tasted great!

Sorry, but as a former pastry chef, I must agree with the reviewer that said the oven temp is too high.  I was taught to bake a NY cheesecake at 250°F (admittedly, depending on the oven - esp a home oven, compared to a commercial one, you may need to increase the temp to 275°F or even 300°F - but no more!) and either in a bain-marie or putting a bowl of (hot) water in the oven separately.  CRACKING is usually caused by the oven being too hot, but over-mixing* does not help.

 Also, IMHO, NY cheesecake should not have ANY flour!  It certainly doesn't need it.

Lastly, yes, definitely do not (*) over-mix !  Cream cheese and sugar first, as has been mentioned, but further to that: I always add my eggs LAST, after the sour cream (I also add some grated orange and lemon zest and juice) -- ONE AT A TIME -- and I still do this in my stand mixer.  You do not need to use a wooden spoon and mix by hand.  (In a commercial kitchen, that would be impossible!)

Kudos for the mention of leaving the door closed after turning off the oven, but you are only partly right: leave the door closed for 15-30 minutes (if the cake is still fairly jiggly), but then, crack the oven door OPEN for 30 minutes before removing to a rack to cool.

Trust me, I have made more cheesecakes than most people make in a lifetime, and this method has never failed.  Happy baking!

This recipe is fantastic.   It is a keeper and I get tons of compliments on it when i make it.    the top cracks every time, however that's because I'm way too impatient and open the oven.

This recipe was awesome. I had never made a cheesecake before and I was worried about making one for the first time. Especially for a 55 year wedding anniversary gift. But it came out amazing. I had a small crack but it still tasted great. I wonder if I can make this into a pumpkin cheesecake. Anyone have any ideas on how I could do that?

i basically changed the whole recipe. i made twice. the first time  i didn't change any thing. it was dry and heavy. very eggy as well. too sweet. i changed it the second time with three eggs, 3 teaspoons of flour, 3/4 cup of sugar and i made a blueberry garnish on top. way better. add maple syrup too and it will give it more flavour. i made my changed cheesecake for a party and everyone said it was delicious.

I'll admit, I made this recipe about 4-5 times before getting it just right. And it was my own fault for not following instructions. I kept leaving it in the oven too long, thinking it was jiggly in the middle and not all the way cooked. Finally, after following the directions EXACTLY...wouldn't ya know, it was perfect. I did follow the tip of someone else, doing the water bath in the oven, it made the texture much creamier and for once, my cheesecake didn't crack! When it says don't overmix, they mean it. Stir in the last few ingredients with a spoon or spatula - NOT an electric mixer. Make sure your butter and cream cheese are room temp. After it's done, turn the oven off and leave it there for 6 hours. No peaking! Do all this and it should turn out amazing.

I made exactly as is (except crust), and did butter the pan all over as someone recommended to help prevent splitting.  Sadly, following instructions to the letter for the filling, it did split.  It didn't matter - it is still a really good, yummy cheesecake recipe. I would like to know what I can add to it to give it more of a tang though. On a side note,  one of the reviewers suggested substituting Bailey's for the milk - I did this the second time, and it was delicious!  For the crust, I didn't add as much granulated sugar, and added a few tsp of brown sugar. It gave the crust a richer taste combined with the cinnamon - for us anyway.  I will make it again!

I read many of the helpful reviews to help me bake my first cheesecake. I realise that the recipe isn't at fault - I didn't read carefully.  I used a mixer to beat instead of mix.  My cheesecake turned out tasting like custard!!

Excellent and easy! Just make sure you let it cool long enough. I couldn't wait to dive in and it hadn't set enough and tasted a little "eggy" to me. But once well cooled it was a great cheesecake, especially with blueberries!

The cheesecake is delicious. I love cheesecake and the cheesecake doesn't disappoint!
The crust, I found, was okay. Nothing noteworthy or special. I found it a bit too crumby for my tastes, actually. But it didn't take away from the delicious cheesecake.

I did follow all the instructions and look at the video when I was mixing the ingredients however, I needed the oven for cook something else after the cheesecake. So, I took the cheesecake out of the oven as soon as my timer sounded and I let the cheesecake resting over a rack the rest of the night. Next morning the cheesecake was perfect!!! No cracks, no even a line on it and it tasted delicious! I don't rate this recipe with 5 stars because the crust needed some other work, it was too lose; the crumbs didn't stick together well.

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and I set my oven to 320.  My family loved it and said it tasted like a restaurant.  Will make it again.

I made this last night before I went to bed, turned the oven off and let it sit until I got up this morning. I rate it 3 stars because this recipe does have a few flaws, and the author's claims that it is the perfect recipe is far from true. I used each one of her suggestions: only used an electric mixer to mix the cream cheese and the sugar until smooth, did not over beat it, and then used a wooden spoon for the rest of the mixing. I don't think this recipe needs the milk and the flour. I think it would have been more dense and creamier without either. Furthermore, 350 is way too much heat in the oven. Mine came out very dark brown. 300 or even 315 would have given the perfect cooking and color to the cheesecake. Finally, 15 crushed graham crackers needs more than just 2 tbls of butter. I had to use 3 1/2 to get the graham cracker crumbs sticky enough to not break form and crumble. It was creamy, but it wasn't dense. It was rich, but not rich enough. The cream cheese taste did not pop out at me, and it didn't leave me smacking my mouth wanting more. I think with a few improvements this could be great. As is, it is just average. I want to taste New York, not the boonies.

Edit 9/12/2016: I remade this without the milk and the flour and it came out a hot mess. It had too much moisture without the flour, which made the cream cheese custard fall apart. It came out gritty and wet. Overall, this recipe is just bad. With the flour it comes out muted, and without it comes out wet an

Unbelievable. Cheesecake is my all-time favorite dessert, and  my family says this one is better than any cheesecake we've ever been served in a restaurant. I followed the baking instructions precisely and it turned out creamier than I had dared to hope. Just lovely. Perfect flavor and texture. My top edge browned more than I would have liked, but I'm sure that has to do with my oven. I will be tweaking the crust to my own preferences. Served with homemade blueberry topping. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I used this recipe to make a Raspberry Rainbow cheesecake.  I divided the  batter between 6 bowls.  I added 2 tbls. of  raspberry puree to 2 of  the bow;s  and colored  them red  and  purple.  Then colored  the remaining 4 bowls  green, blue, yellow  and orange.  Poured the  batter into  a Oreo cookie crust  to make a tie dyed  effect. I baked  mine  at 325  for 1 hour and 45 mins in a water bath.  Let  it set in the oven with the  door open  1 inch for 2 hours. Came out  beautiful and  delicious.  I uploaded  a picture of mine.

I feel like this is way too sweet, but it may be because I typically prefer a more cream-cheesy flavour than sugary flavour. The texture turned out perfect, and the recipe was pretty much a no-fail, but I would definitely put way less sugar in next time. Maybe just 3/4 of a cup! It's probably more my flavour preferences. This was also pretty easy to make, which was great.

This was phenomenal!! I did use a water bath and reduced the flour a bit because I prefer a creamier texture. I also used a different crust recipe, same ingredients just different proportions. Earned rave reviews from our friends!

This cheesecake is tremendous! I have made several changes after reading all reviews! Brand name, room temperature ingredients are a must....generic made a huge difference in the taste. I used generic the second time and it made a big difference. I used vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers too. I used a roaster half full of boiling water instead of foil and had no cracks.  One of the best cheesecakes I've ever had!

This was really good!  I gave it four stars because I didn't follow the recipe perfectly.  I read the reviews and made the crust with gluten free graham crackers, pecans,sugar and butter.  I also left out the milk and flour since I needed the cheesecake to be gluten free.  I lowered the temp to 325 and still if browned up on the top.  I also put a 9x13 glass pan with water on the rack belie

First off -- loved the cheesecake. Very tasty.  Now for a mini-rant on why it's getting 4 out of 5 stars ...

It cracked. It cracked in less than ten minutes after I turned the oven off. The only reason I'm so annoyed about it is because the recipe said it  wouldn't if I turned the oven off and left the cake in.  I live in Utah, so maybe the higher altitude messed with it. I really don't think I over-mixed it, but maybe I'm wrong.  Either way, I'm annoyed. Other than that, this is a fantastic cheesecake! I made it for my husband's birthday and he LOVED it. Totally making it again. Definitely a big hit at our house. I just need to figure out how to keep it from cracking...

I've always been looking for a good recipe for a cheesecake, and I finally found one!! Such smooth texture and great cheese flavor. I did exactly what the recipe said. It cracked possibly  because I didn't grease the side of the pan enough. But it was delicious!!

This was the very first cheesecake I ever made, and it was perfect.  Everyone loved it, couldn't believe it was homemade.  I did follow some of the excellent tips provided in other comments, especially about not over mixing, letting it cool in the closed oven for a longer period of time, etc. and I think that helped it turn out as perfect as it did.  No sunken cheesecake here.  Can't wait to make another one!

Great cheesecake  I added fresh lemon and lime to the batter. Didn't get the flavor I was looking for. Next time I'll add lemon extract as well for more lemon flavor. I left cake in oven for about 5 hours but still got a huge crack. I'll try the water bath next time. The crack doesn't affect the taste tho. My friends still loved it.

Very delicious and easy recipe! I followed the instructions to the tee the first time, and the cheesecake cracked while baking, but was still delicious.

The second time around, I decided to the put the cheesecake into the oven as soon as I turned it on. Let the temperature of the pie rise with the oven. No crack afterwards. It browned a little on the edges, but that didn't take away from the flavour.

This is a recipe I will recommend to anyone looking for a good cheesecake recipe.

Made this a few time with NO issues. I didn't have to leave it in the oven 6 hours either. Just an hour. Then an hour or two on the bench top, then in the fridge until chilled. Always perfect, no cracks or anything. This last time I made little cheesecakes in a Texas muffin tin. 18 - 20 minutes and then the same resting period in oven/counter top/fridge before serving. Still awesome :-)

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made. I always manage to mess up recipes but all my roommates say this is the best thing I've made so far. As a little tip, after putting in the oven, these did rise quite a bit (not sure if it's my fault or whatever) so just be wary of that. This recipe made enough for 2 cakes.

This was perfect! I did end up cooking mine for an additional 15 minutes because it was still all liquid and wasn't set on the sides like I'd like. Could have been because I cooked it in a hot water bath. After that I turned the oven off and left the door shut for an hour. Then cracked the door and slide a warm knife around the outside edge of the cheesecake to release it from the pan and the left the door cracked for an additional two hours to cool. Removed pan to counter to cool for another three hours then let set in the fridge overnight. This was sooo creamy and velvety. Perfect texture and so tasty. I left all of the ingredients the same and did use whole milk. My in laws and husband and I all loved it.

I love to cook and am NOT a baker by any means, nor am I a plain cheesecake lover, but this was a great recipe and it was my first attempt. 

I did make revisions to the crust, as per the reviewer's comments (thanks Sciota, review#4). 1 1/2 cup graham crackers (about 12), 1/4 cup of finely chopped nuts (I used walnuts), 1/4 c salted butter, melted, 1/3 cup white sugar (some reviews said 1/2 c and some said 1/4, so I took the middle ground), 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I also put the crust in a 9" springform pan very greased, in the freezer to set and harden (reviewer suggestion), until I had completed making the cheesecake mixture. After making the crust, I put a 13X9X2 filled with boiling water  water on the lower rack in the oven (paranoid that I would make a mess with the water bath!!) for a warm moist oven (thanks Porusgirl review #118)I then made the cheesecake, as per the ingredients (at room temperature-per many comments), and also tossed in a Tbsp of lemon juice (per a reviewer, and that person was correct, it did not make the cake taste 'lemony' at all, which I did not want, only to enhance the flavors). I baked the cheesecake  on the upper rack at 325 for 75 minutes. I did leave the cheesecake and water in the oven for the additional 6 hours to cool. (No peeking was easy as I put the cheesecake in the oven at 2:45am, and turned the oven off at 4am, then went to bed.) 

The changes that I might make next time are to double the crust recipe, so that the

Cheesecake is my boyfriends favorite, so I recently made Chantel's recipe for his birthday.    Let's put it this way... He was upset that I let his daughter take 1/2 of it home at the end of the evening.  Loved it!

I was so nervous to make my first cheesecake, but after reading a lot of the reviews I figured I was ready. It came out GREAT. I was actually told this was better then Juniors' (pretty close I would say:) I think the key is the make sure the ingredients are room temp. I left everything out on the counter for  over 5 hours. Also, I was careful not to over mix except for the cream cheese and sugar. I did use a water bath and  when the cheesecake was done (one hour)  I shut off the oven and left it in  to cool overnight. A little radical, but I wanted it to be perfect. I should mention I used the crust recipe from the back of the Kebbler crushed grahm cracker box and used a well greased heart shaped spring form pan (no cracking!) Definitely looking forward to making this again. Thanks so much Chantal!

T'was my first time making a cheesecake and this turned out really good. I only did half of the recipe but used the same amount of graham but with 4 tbsp of butter. Then I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream since I didn't have any. But it tasted really good. Make sure the ingredients are room temperature. I also strained the cheesecake mixture to make sure there is no lumps. I baked it for 1 hr at 325°F and kept it in the oven overnight. Topped it with my homemade Blueberry topping as well. I uploaded a picture too! ?

I'm sure this is a great recipe, according to the comments! I made a big mistake but not so big! I forgot to let my cream cheese soften before mixing it! 

So my cheesecake came out cracked and clumpy, it was not very good :(

But...after it cooled, I scooped all the inside out from the crust and mushed it all together with a fork until it was more smooth but still had a little clump in it. And EVERYONE loved it! They said the texture made it better than the store bought ones because it had small tiny clumps in it! I also topped it with whip cream, strawberries and strawberry puree oh oh! And a sprinkle of cinnamon on top!

I tweaked the recipe by adding Calamansi juice for a competition using Citrus fruits. I also altered a few of the ingredients used in this recipe as well as the temperature in baking. It turned out great!!! Got 2nd place in our local Citrus Festival and got a silver medal for it!! Thank you!! I'll be sharing my recipe on the site, it's called Calamansi Cheesecake. Happy baking to all!!

First time making cheesecake and it turned out perfectly! Followed the advice of some of the other reviewers: Baked at 325 degrees for one hour with water bath, then allowed to sit for about 6 hours. Made sure all ingredients (not just cream cheese) were at room temp and hand mixed everything after the cream cheese and sugar.  Only used two tablespoons of flour as my husband likes creamy cheesecake and added sugar and cinnamon to the crust.

Cheesecake came out with no cracks and a great creamy texture. The taste of the cheesecake is phenomenal, and my husband says it is the best he has ever had. I did not like the cinnamon addition to the crust and will be leaving it out next time. 

Per other reviews and tips the main things to do to get the cheesecake to turn out right is:
1. Bake at 325 degrees
2. Use room temp ingredients
3. Do not over mix
4. Bake in waterbath
5. Do not open oven to check on cheesecake

I've tried several cheesecake recipes. This is the best ever. The water bath is the real trick to keep it from cracking. You have to be patient with cheesecake, you cannot rush it. Allowing it to sit and age properly, is worth the wait.

Mine was not a pretty cheesecake!  It was cracked and lumpy, but it tasted delicious!  I followed directions, made sure my ingredients were room temp, allowed it to cool in the oven, greased the pan, etc., but it still cracked!  I covered it up with a fresh berry sauce and everyone enjoyed it despite it's appearance. I have made pretty cheesecakes before, but I guess I'll try it again before going back to my old recipe.

Great flavor, I hadn't made cheesecake in over ten years so I forgot that you need to have room temperature ingredients and not to over mix. Mine cracked in the middle. I wish the instructions would have had these tips. But I will definitely be making this again. Also I had to add about 4 more tablespoons of butter to the crust to get it to the right texture.

Omg!  I have now made this cheesecake  twice,  and it just keeps getting better and better. I love the bake only for an hour since hydro went up in Ontario. Lol whoever Chantal is, this is so great. Thanks for allowing others to try it.  I read one review, indicating this was awful.  Must have used a different recipe because now I've  made it 4 times and each time my hubby says its better than the last one.??.  This timei put in 3/4 cup of whipping cream instead of  the milk. I hope  i haven't  ruined this fantastic cheesecake.  I will let you know.??????

This is a great recipe.  I read a lot of reviews and made a couple of changes. I used half the flour and cooked it in a water bath raised up with some balls of aluminum foil. The cheesecake was perfect in my opinion and the credit goes to the original recipe. I topped mine with a lemon berry compote I made with lemon juice sugar water blueberries and strawberries.  I then thickened it with a cornstarch slurry.

This was the best recipe yet. I've been trying to find a rich, creamy cheesecake. I've found a couple good recipes but this is the one I needed.  I did do a couple things different but not really to the recipe.  I used a chocolate wafer crust abd had a 10"inch springform pan. So had to multiply ingredients by 1.2 to get it right.  Also,  I cooked it at 325° instead of 350° for one hour. Let it cool in oven for 3 hours abd then refrigerated.  It was PERFECT. I'm still excited!!

This is, by far, the best cheesecake recipe I've made.  I do it in a water bath and zero cracks. I've also tweaked it a bit.  I make the regular recipe then take out 1 1/2 cups of the batter and add 1/4 cup cocoa, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 teas vanilla and 1 TB oil.  Mix that up and marble it into the regular recipe and bake as normal.  Who needs The Cheesecake Factory.  Serve with a bit of whip cream and a nice Moscato!! I'm in heaven.  Thanks for the recipe!!  Since our nearest Cheesecake Factory is 3 hours away, I make this a lot!!

The most perfect cheesecake recipe. I make mine in a silicon springform pan which I spray with Pam. I don't even need to run a knife around the edge after it is finished baking. No cracks or flaws at all. My crust recipe is slightly modified:   1-1/2  cups crushed graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans, 1/4 tsp. Cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg.

The best cheesecake I've personally ever made. the texture was creamy and smooth. I followed the measurements exactly and  realized you only need about 1 cup and a bit of sugar. Another change I made was at the very end when I was mixing the batter, I actually used an electric mixer on low for 1 minute and that made the cheesecake fluffy and light. I highly recommend this recipe!

Very good recipe! I've made a few different ones over time, this is one that is on the top. Couple changes I made
1. Make sure everything is at room temperature before starting, makes the cream cheese lighter.
2. I used evaporated milk for the milk for a richer flavor
3. I incorporated the eggs at the very last and only mix the eggs enough to incorporate them, do not over whip them it busts up the proteins if you do.

Mine still cracked, but honestly who cares? You made a cheesecake that is delicious, no one cares there's a Crack I promise, they're just excited to eat the cake, crack and all!

I used this recipe for my very first attempt at a cheesecake. It turned out perfect!! However, I did use a few of the tips from reviewers and made sure my ingredients were room temperature and used a water bath. I will definitely use this recipe again!

First time (5/16I made as is; no water bath, ingredients at room temp, did not overmix. It rose up really high and the edges got really brown and there was a crack in the middle. Second time (6/17) I lowered the temp to 325 and baked on lower rack with pan of water under. Baked for 1hr15m, let sit 90 min and put in fridge - middle was runny. Next time I'll bake for 1hr45 and use maybe 12 graham crackers and more butter - I baked the crust for 10 min first but it's still more like a layer of crumbs than a crust.

I scoured various recipes and went with this one.  Used the crust that others recommended.  I did use heavy cream for the milk, one less egg white and added some lemon zest.

I baked in 1in water bath for 70 minutes at 325 degrees., shut oven off, and let sit for an hour.   It set perfectly, no cracks or anything. 

This cheesecake is better than some bakeries I've gotten.  Dense, creamy.  Served with a mango coulis.

Amazing!  First time making it and it came out perfect ! no cracks....I followed everything they said, only changes I did was bake it in a water bath at 325 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. And then removed it after 2 hours and put it straight in the fridge overnight. It was nice and creamy and just plain delicious

The cheesecake alone is 5 stars. But the crust needs work. Next time I will use Carol's Graham Cracker Crust http://allrecipes.com/recipe/12254/graham-cracker-crust You do not want to overmix the cheesecake and use water bath.

Delicious! I will make this again. Everyone loved it. After reading many of the reviews I made a couple changes. I made the crust like many reviews suggested (1.5 cups crushed graham crackers, 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, and baked the crust for about 5 minutes on its own). I used room temperature ingredients, didn't over mix, banged the side of the filled cheesecake pan to release air bubbles, greased the pan well, and baked at 325 for 1 hour. I  used half the amount of flour and milk the recipe called for because many reviews used less or none at all. I did use the water bath method because many of the reviews suggested it. My cheesecake pan would only fit on my cookie sheet pan so I had only about 1 inch of water. It seemed to be fine because my cheesecake had no cracks and the texture was perfect. I used an oven bag to protect my cheesecake from water seeping into the pan. Many reviews said wrapped foil doesn't stop the water so I used an oven bag, worked great. I cut the bag so that it came up to the top edge of my cheesecake pan and used the tie it came with to secure it. After baking (for 1 hour) I let the cheesecake sit in the turned off oven for 1 hour before removing the water bath and running a greased knife around the edge of the cheesecake. Put it back in the oven for 2 more hours. Then let it cool on the counter for 1 hour before covering and putting it in the fridge. I didn't have time to let it sit in the oven for the amount of time the recipe call

Keeping it in the oven for several (we left it for 2 hours per a review) hours after the 60-min cook out seemed to burn the top crust a bit. But not so far that it would taste burned. Next time, I am going to let it set outside. We loved the taste although the sugar content recommended was a bit too sweet for us, I guess. Otherwise, the recipe works great!!

I believe one of the best cheesecakes I have made. I did end up with a small crack, but I read some of the other reviews advice and plan on making it today again. This recipe is now the only way I will make cheesecake. Soooooo good!

I love how easy this recipe is.  Two bowls and done!  I used a pyrex glass pie dish and it was fine.  I used the lid of round casserole dish to make a mini cheesecake with the overflow.  Very tasty!

This has been my cheesecake for the couple years! Sometimes I use half the batter with melted chocolate chips and swirl it in! Yummy always a hit.  I use the Bain Marie always! And spray the sides.

Rich, creamy, thick but fluffy cheesecake! 
Best cheese cake without the lime-y flavor.
Maybe I don't know how to describe it but it's not gelatin-y like other recipes or (like others) it doesn't slowly start running off the sides after the first slice is cut out.
This is perfect slices of cream-cheesy sweetness! 
After baking, I like to top it off with a layer of home made cream cheese frosting for added sweetness.
Also, we've made a 1/4 of the recipe and poured into the ready-made graham cracker crusts and it turn out perfect.

Excellent!!! I read the previous reviews about lemon juice, but a 1/2 tsp of lemon zest was amazing! I used heavy cream instead of milk, & it gave it a slightly creamier texture.

I've honestly never made a cheesecake before.  I followed the directions and some of the advice: water bath, bringing ingredients to room temperature and not overmixing it, and it came out amazing!  We had cheesecake at the cheesecake factory a couple weeks ago and this was FAR better!  It was for my husband's 60th birthday and he said it was the best cheesecake he has EVER had, high praise indeed.  I used my own graham cracker crust, simply because I've used it before and knew how many graham crackers to use (like others wasn't sure what 15 crackers was).  My recipe uses a whole sleeve of graham crackers and a stick of butter.  Amazing all around.  AND IT DID NOT CRACK!!

Awesome... changed a little from reviews.  Crust: 15 graham crackers, 1/4 c. almond slivers, 1/3 c. sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Mix in food processor and add 6 TBS melted "butter".  Press into foiled and greased 10.5" springform pan.  Bake in preheated 325 oven for 15 minutes.  Made cheesecake in my Kitchen Aid (the one on a stand).  Creamed cream cheese and sugar as stated on high speed until creamy.  Then on lowest setting added eggs, vanilla and sour cream in that order.  Omitted flour and milk.  Made many cheesecakes - doesn't need.  Let sit 25 minutes.  Pour onto crust.  Put 1" hot water in 8 X 8 pan on  bottom of preheated oven, and the cheesecake above it.  Cooked for 1 hour and shut off.  Left for 5 hours and refrigerated.  Bed time!!  Made my own toppings.  If you're going to go this far.... go all the way!

Very easy to follow recipe and very smooth and creamy texture. I made this recipe a couple of times now and both turned out great! The first one cracked but that was my overmixing, just made a brown sugar glaze to hide my mistake. What the eye doesn't see, etc....Second one was the charm. Ne xt time will add a few oz of bittersweet chocolate to get a chocolate version.

This was my very first attempt at Cheesecake. Served it at Easter and it was gone in minutes!! It did crack. I'm bad at checking the oven. Next time I'm going to follow the warnings to see how much of a difference it will be. I've heard a water bath works too to prevent cracking but I'm nervous about trying it. Used blueberries to make the topping (since cherries aren't in season in April) and they also hid the few crack. 4x 8oz Philadelphia sticks seemed too much as it rose a good 3/4" above my 9" spring form pan.

All I need to say is that I made this cheesecake one week before we went to The CheeseCake Factory for dinner.  After we finished our cheesecake my husband turned to me and said, " I feel yours is better! "

Perfect recipe!  Simple to make.  This is my go to Cheesecake recipe that everyone I have made it for, falls in love with.  I have used this recipe, with no fail, about a dozen times now and will never go to another Cheesecake recipe.
This really is the A+ of all!  Compliments galore, never a disappointment going with this.

This is one the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted!!! Everyone raved about it at Easter! It did crack despite following the directions exactly. Next time I'll try a water bath. But despite that this was an amazing cheesecake recipe. Thanks for sharing.

My husband is a New York native and he gets upset if I tell him he has to share the cheesecake. I often make it as payment to friends and family for yard work or mechanical fixes to my car. I make Chef John's Fresh Strawberry Sauce from this site to go with it and they are the perfect pairing. As others have said, make sure your cream cheese is room temp and don't overmix. I make it with my stand mixer but I keep an eye on it the whole time. Also, the quality of the vanilla will change the outcome. I recommend using Madagascar bourbon vanilla extract.

This cheesecake recipe is so simple and so delicious! It is honestly the best cheesecake I've ever made! I followed the recipe and added a sour cream frosting to cover the crack that happened. I recommend this recipe one hundred percent, its better than any fancy cheesecake sold at specialty restaurants and for a fraction of the price. Try it out, you will not be disappointed. As for the negative reviews, there must be something seriously wrong with your technique because I found it very simple to follow the recipe.

Ladies and Gentleman:  My cheesecake is in the oven - awaiting results.  Gave it high ratings as the recipe was easy to follow.  However, I read the reviews *before* starting the recipe....so I could be prepared.  2 problems - (1) "15 graham crackers" isn't specific enough, as each 'sheet' of graham crackers has a total of 4.  I went by the serving suggestion on the grahams' box which equaled 3 3/4 sheets, and it appears the crust is a bit thin to me; (2) Water bath?  Someone mentioned in their comments it required a water bath, which it does not.  Although I appreciate the info, it made me nuts trying to figure out what I missed.  So, I decided - no water bath, bake 1 hour and leave in there for 6 hours as recommended.

I wrap bottom of springform pan in two layers of aluminum foil.  Place in large pan and fill with 1/2 inch of very hot water, a "bain marie."

DO NOT OVER-MIX ONCE EGGS ARE ADDED.

For 1 and 1/2 cups of graham cracker crumbs for the crust, use 8 full graham crackers (sheets)

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Actually, better than perfect. This recipe produces a cheesecake that is thick, creamy with just the right consistency. It's superb. Really. And it's easy. No water bath. No cracks. This is definitely a keeper!

I just found it slightly too sweet, I will use 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 next time but that is really a matter of personal taste

Directions were simple, cake looked beautiful but not sweet enough even with cherries on top. I recommend adding 1/2 cup of sugar for sweetness and cornstarch and I more egg for fluffiness.

I made this recipe last night.

I only had 2 cream cheese blocks, so I halved the recipe and made it in a 9 inch pyrex pie plate.

I used other reviewer's notes for the crust: 1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I did not pre-bake the crust, and it was fine.

I thought I had enough sour cream, but only had half of what I needed, so I used plain greek yogurt for the other half.

I added the zest of one lemon to provide a little flavor.

I baked at 325 for 1 hour and then let it sit in the oven for about 4 hours, then put it in the fridge.

It came out beautifully (no cracks) and tasted great.

If you are expecting some other taste from the cheesecake, I don't know why. This recipe is unflavored, so it's all about the cream cheese. I chose to add the lemon zest, but I'm sure it would have been fine without. If you want flavor, then add some, but don't judge the recipe because it is a pure one.

I mixed everything by hand with a fork since I believe that is the best way to prevent over-mixing. I also let the ingredients sit out (minus the milk) to come to room temperature before mixing. I did not use a water bath and I don't think it's necessary, but maybe I'll try one next time to see how it changes things, if at all.

This is a great tasting cheesecake. I however made it into mini cheesecakes. Makes about 24 in muffin tins. I also used foil liners so that it didn't leak through the paper. Cooked them all at the same time for 30 min. Took them out of the oven after the 30 min so they didn't dry out. I only had two crack a little. Everyone loved them and they came out great

Turned out perfect! This is the best cheesecake I have ever had and turned out beautifully.  Not a single crack! Made sure to use whole milk and made sure the cream cheese and eggs were at room temp.  I used a water bath and a little butter around the pan to keep it from sticking and cracking.  Amazed when I finally looked at the finished product.  It was so pretty I felt like a success even before tasting it!   The texture of this cheesecake is perfect.  Creamy yet thick and not overly sweet.  This is my go to for all future cheesecakes!

Wow, I'm guy and I've never made a cheesecake before this is amazing!  Followed the directions exactly and let cool 6 hours in oven, not one Crack and it's rich and firm just like true NY cheesecake!  I'll be making more of these.

This was a simple, no fuss recipe that created a delicious cheesecake. I can't get sour cream where I live so I made my own and used a little bit less than the recipe calls for as homemade is thinner than store bought sour cream.  Other than that, the only change I made was to use a water bath as I always do with cheesecake. I made it for a British friend who loves NY style cheesecake after living in the US but claims you can't find a good slice anywhere around her home country . She was a pretty happy woman when she tasted it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

It was still really good.  I just turned the oven off when I realized I had forgotten to set the timer for 10 minutes.  Left in the oven for a two more hours.  Refrigerated overnight.   Very creamy.

Delicious! This is my second attempt to make a cheesecake, it's been a while since the last time.. And it went out perfect! Very delicate, creamy, moist enough, just wonderful! I did strawberry compote myself, which completes the dessert.

I followed the tips in reviews about the process. I upgraded the crust a bit adding cinnamon, nutmeg and a bunch of grounded almonds, baked the crust alone for 7 minutes, then I used KitchenAid mixer to mix all the ingredients one by one and just to incorporate them. It did it perfectly! But just in case there's a lot of bubbles left, I threw down the form to the table a couple of times to let bubbles go up, leaving the flat surface of cake ready to bake. I baked for 1 hour using the pan with bubbling water on the lower rack as a water bath, turned out the oven and left the cake there for 6 hours. Honestly, I don't think it requires so much time to cool down, next time I'll wait not more than 4 hours or so. Then cooled it in refrigerator (happens to be overnight, but again, I would say 1 hour and it's ready!). Excellent easy recipe! Everyone's happy. Definitely will be making again!

PERFECT result!!! The only changes I made were to the crumb crust, I pre-baked it (10 min) and used 3x as much butter as they suggest, 6tbsp, to make sure it didn't crumble as so often happens to me (I can't get graham crackers here so I use some biscuity cookie things which work OK but often make a very crumbly crust). Also, when I poured the batter into the pan, I poured it through a small strainer because the flour had left lumps in the batter. I was concerned about the instructions to add it last, thinking it would lump. I should have listened to my instincts and maybe mixed it together with the sugar before even adding the cream cheese in the beginning or something. Still, the straining worked and the cake came out wonderfully, no cracks and the perfect taste and texture, so it still gets 5 stars!

Chantel I just want to thank you for this recipe. I have made this cheesecake recipe for years! It's the best cheesecake I have ever had. I followed the recipe to the tee and it comes out great every time and everyone raves about it. I still haven't made one that does not crack but I'm working on it.  
I wonder if it has to do with where I live that causes it to crack? I live in VA.  Thanks

I made this cheesecake and it was the best !!!  I used baking Pam ,no problems releasing from pan. Also,I put a larger pan of  hot water on the lower oven rack,on the start of preheating the oven, rather than waterbath. I've made this recipe at least 10 times and not once has it cracked.

Made this multiple times, works everytime as long as you follow the instructions especially in regards to allowing cooldown in the oven. Best in a water bath , however if you are not able to use a water bath, place an oven proof bowl of water in the oven during baking to keep humidity high.

For all you doubters out there, the recipe, as it stands, is perfect. Now, I did take a tsp. of lemon and orange zest and add it to the mix for flavor. But the whole thing was great. I did make a ramekin with extra mix so that I could taste it before decorating it (fresh fruit: strawberries, kiwi, raspberries and blackberries). Both I and my spouse thought it superior. All that said, I did read every darned review before I started and watched the video of Chef John to learn some tips. It's easy, time consuming and definitely worth the effort.

The only thing that didn't work for me was leaving the cheesecake in the oven for 5 hours after it was done cooking for an hour. I left in in for only 2 and the result was a HUGE  y-shaped crack. That was disappointing.

I finally dared make a cheesecake!  My son is not a fan of cake, but loves cheesecake.  I'd never braved it as I was fearful of cracking, but I followed the directions to a 'T', including a couple of the tips from comments for good measure (a pan of water underneath, not over mixing, and making sure all ingredients were at room temperature) and it was fantastic!  No cracking and positively delicious.  It was best after having been refrigerated for a day, so I'd suggest making it in advance if possible.  I will definitely make it again, though I'll be looking for a different crust recipe.

I do not cook or bake so when my daughter (8 yrs) asked me to please make a cake with her, I needed an easy-no fail-fast-anybody can do it-tasty cheesecake recipe.  I do not own a springform pan and I do not own a mixer (I refer back to my first words in this review) so I used store bought ready pie crust and blended the creamcheese by hand.  It was enough for 2 cakes. The cakes turned out perfect!!!! I could not believe it!! My daughter called grandma and invited her over to try the cheesecake we made.

I just recently started cooking/baking. I've made this cheesecake 3 times now and I have everyone fooled. I took it to work the other day and everyone went nuts. I've been reading the comments for tips on how to make it so that it doesn't crack, but no one has complained about the cracks. They were all too busy stuffing their face...lol.

This is my go-to cheesecake, and it's a hit  every time!  I don't change a thing, except for the crust, which I typically make using the recipe on the crushed graham crackers box.  Otherwise, it's an absolute hit, and easy as ever to make.

Just made 3 pies because this recipe makes waaaay too much! I highly recommend cutting it in 1/3rds at least 1/2 for a reg pie crust, but it tastes awesome. 1st time cheesecake maker.. It cracked but it still tastes good, I recomend turning it down 25-50 degrees. Added blackberry jam, few dollops and a couple stirs before putting it in. Delicious!

Taste and texture were great. Followed the instructions to the letter, but it still cracked. Found other ideas to fix that issue so I will make this again. The family loved it!

Always mix your sugar and  cream cheese with mixer, than by hand, mix everything else. I've  been making New York style cheese cake for years and this one is the best!  This isn't a sweet cheese cake you would buy at the store in a box, those have too much sugar in them. This is a classy cheese cake you would order at a nice restaurant. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I couldn't find my recipe tonight and I was craving cheese cake. My boyfriend loved it, as well as I.  :)

Loved how easy this recipe is to make. Can't wait to taste it. In the video you put it on a cookie sheet but in the recipe you don't say to do that. Is that going to make a big difference?

I've been making this for years and it's still a favorite! I get requests for it all the time. It definitely takes being very careful and patient, but it's worth it. I also cut up fresh strawberries and shave some milk chocolate on top. Perfect!

This is by far the best cheese cake. I found this recipe a few years ago and everyone loves it. I have one grandson that asks me to make him his own personal cheese cake for Christmas every year.

This is the best cheesecake I've ever made! Not just my opinion, everyone who's tried it loves it. My only springform pan is 10 inch, so I was worried about the bake time. I added 30 minutes to the 75 minute bake time at  325 F that another reviewer recommended. So that's 1 hour and 45 minutes total. I didn't  open the oven at all, despite the fact that it still didn't look done. After 6 hours to cool, transferred to the fridge. At this point it had set nicely, no cracks, and pulled away from the sides.I used a shortbread crust with lemon zest, rebuttering the sides after prebaking the crust and letting it cool. and a bain marie with an oven bag rather than foil per reviews. Switching to a wooden spoon after the step of creaming the sugar and cream cheese together also helped avoid over beating. The final product is dense, moist, creamy, rich, and everything I love in a cheesecake. The lemon zest in the crust makes it a treat on it's own, and it stands up to macerated strawberry juice without getting soggy. One thing I'd do differently is not to use a cake circle under the crust. It got soggy from condensation, and the crust is so thick and sturdy that it can take the condensation on it's own. It may be that the cardboard weakened the seal on the pan, causing more moisture to collect than necessary. I puddled the juice on the plate, and set the crust on top, then topped with the berries, and the crust was still nice and firm. The long cool down in the closed oven is really th

I made this EXACTLY as the recipe called for.  No water bath, no changes!  I was looking for a dense NY cheesecake and that's what I got!  Wonderful!!!  Just a tip...make sure your ingredients (especially the cream cheese) are at room temperature and DO NOT overmix!

This is a delicious cheesecake. Follow the directions step by step and you will have no problems. I always seem to get confused with graham cracker quantities - I use a "package"  (nine rectangular graham crackers) for the crust.  Also, I use my largest spring foam pan as it makes a nice, large cheese cake! I'm going to try greasing the pan the next time to avoid "cracking" as another person commented.

Not a big fan of this recipe.  I made it yesterday for a surprise for my son coming home from work.  I was so disappointed in the outcome as it was tasteless and burned.  I followed the recipe exactly and have no idea why it was a flop.  Several things come to mind for the bad results:  I have always put a water bath in the oven but this recipe didn't call for it.  Further the temperature was too high for the batter IMO and the cake was overall flavorless.  Unfortunately it was a big waste of ingredients and I will never make it again. So sad.  Too bad.

Made this exactly as the directions stated and left it in the oven after baking for 4 hours.  Only minor cracking around the edges.  So very smooth and creamy, the best cheese cake I've made yet.  Absolutely delicious!

My boyfriend lick all the bowl and the spatula .. This is perfect, with perfect measurement it could be the most epic cheese cake just like the one from cake shop. All you need to remember is to bring all the ingredients to room temperature and remember to set the oven heat and not open the oven even after 60mnts it will be better to let it little longer in the oven and let it rest to (again) to room temperature so it came perfectly smooth..

Upon realizing I had absolutely no lemon juice or zest in my house, I went on a search for a good cheesecake with no lemon included. I was suspicious of the use of so many wet ingredients, but I was very pleasantly surprised. This recipe was just as good if not better than all the cheesecakes I've made previously! I used pre-prepared crusts which were normal sized for cheesecake, and I ended up with enough batter to make 2 full cheesecakes. The only downside to this recipe is that the cheesecake cracks more easily than other kinds I've made, but the taste is wonderful and if you're careful it comes out really well.

This is an excellent cheesecake recipe, I've made it twice so far. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe said, with the addition of a pan of boiling water on the rack below it. Turned out great. The second time I added 2tbsp of sugar to the crust mixture and baked for 8 minutes at 350. Everything else the same, even better!

Mine turned out perfectly.  Only had 10" Springform pan and an hour did it but I might shave 3 or 4 minutes off the hour next time.  No cracks and thanks to the reviewer for the 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg who doubled the butter for the graham cracker crust to 2 tablespoons.  No cracks either.  Would make again for sure but next time with chocolate chips.  Would like a variation of this recipe for chocolate cheesecake.  Greasing sides of pan worked perfect too.  THANKS ALL AND CHANTAL

I followed the recipe precisely.  The cheesecake rose well above the top of the 9-inch spring form pan, splitting over the top of the pan and down the sides.  It actually "exploded" and I had bits of cheesecake all over the oven.  Never had that happen before!

I have made this cheesecake twice, and, I have learned a couple of things: Use a water bath!  Even if you just use a separate pan with water in it - do that and wrap the cheesecake pan with aluminum foil!!! The second time I made this I did not wrap the outside with foil and my cake cracked very bad

I made a cheesecake years ago and I guess it didn't turn out so well, because I haven't made another one in as many years!
I made this one after reading all the rave reviews, and suggestions...and it was a breeze!  However, I made changes as follows; Used a 10" spring-form, made the suggested crust of 1 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/2c. melted butter, 1/2 c.sugar, 1/4 c.pecan bits, 1t. cinnamon & 1/4t. nutmeg.  For the filling I used the ingredients as listed, except I left out the flour and the milk.  In place of the vanilla, I used fiori di sicilia, which gave it an INCREDIBLE flavor!!  I baked @ 325, for an hour 5 minutes, utilizing the 13  x9 pan of HOT water placed under the cake pan.  The top still browned a little...next time maybe I will try 300 degrees, even though the slightly brown top doesn't bother me in the least!  I will post future changes as I make new cakes.  Thanks soooooo much for such an AWESOME recipe!  You took all my fear of making a cheesecake out of my sails.  I think this is a good thing.....I'm certain my waist line or scale WON'T agree!!

Love this recipe!

Here's a few tips I've gathered from other reviews.  

-make sure all ingredients are at room temperature before mixing together.
-mix cream cheese and sugar very well with a whisk.  Mix all other ingredients lightly with a wooden spoon.
-don't forget to sift flower.
-make a water bath for the pie.
 Wrap the spring form pan with two pieces of foil, making sure the bottom is completely covered and no water will seep in.  Next, place pie in a baking pan and fill it with 1" of hot water.
-bake 350 degrees for 60 minutes.  After 60 minutes turn off the oven and let the pie sit in the oven for 5-6 hours. Do not open the oven. Ever. Just turn off the oven and let it sit.
-after baking, leave pie in the spring form pan and refrigerate leaving the top open. If you cover the pie moisture will gather and drip onto the pie.
 Enjoy!


I was out of sour cream so I replaced it with Greek yogurt. It came out great.

This cheesecake tasted great but I followed the instructions to the tee and it had huge crevices on the top when I finally took it out of the oven and the sides were very dark.  I had to shave the top off and take a hot icing spreader to the cake to fill in the deep cracks but nothing could be done about the sides.  The flavor was very good and, in order to cover the top, I added raspberries, a raspberry sauce  and drizzled with dark chocolate.  Every bite was eaten but it was a bit labor intense with fixing the appearance.  I might try it again on a little lower temp.

I have never made cheesecake before; this was my first time trying a recipe, and it turned out so good! I modified the crust as others had suggested by adding a tablespoon of cinnamon to the graham crumbs. It cracked a little while cooling but I didn't mind because also added a simple cherry topping that I made myself. I made it for Christmas and my family absolutely loved it!

Amazing recipe; I've made it twice now.  Only recommendations I have is to ensure everything is room temperature before you mix it all together. Also, I used the 'Graham Cracker Crust I' recipe from AllRecipes instead of the one from this one. All in all, fantastic cheesecake.

All in all the cheesecake was good, I made it for Christmas dessert and everyone loved it. It did crack in the middle but it wasn't too big of a deal. I paired it with fresh fruit and it was pretty yummy. I think with the crust I would have used a little over half and added a couple more tablespoons of butter. It was too crummy for my tastes, needed a little more butter.

I made this and it wasn't bad, but I do have to admit that its not the best I've had or made myself. Its definitely a good starter recipe for adding other flavors, but I thought it was kind of bland. 

I would definitely make it if your interested. But it's just not my cup of tea personally.

I made it for Christmas.  Everyone loved it.  It was fairly simple.  Mine did crack but I was not overly concerned about that as long as tasted good.  The cracking I think can be created by many different variables and different people have different takes on how to prevent.  I did minimal mixing after initial mixer but did sparingly use a whisk as well as wooden spoon to get smoother.  The texture was perfect and did not have to use knife around edges to release from pan, came right loose.  No messing with pans of water in oven.  

Totally pleased with this recipe.  Plan to use again.

Oh Man ...Don't change a thing...This is a no brainer. All you have to do is follow these directions and trust in it to work. Do the water bath and foil wrap. I have made two and the only thing I changed is instead I used 18 Graham Crackers  because I prefer a little thicker crust. Took it too a Christmas dinner and it went over like mad. Made a Raspberry sauce for it . There will be no other cheesecake recipe for me ever.

I'm very disappointed with how my cheesecake came out. I followed the directions to a tee and it still has a huge crack! My ingredients were room temperature, I mixed only the cream cheese and sugar together, then hand incorporated the rest of the ingredients to avoid air bubbles, let the cheesecake rest before baking and kept it cooling in the oven without opening the oven door for several hours! I was so excited to see it when I finally opened the oven door and my heart just sank :(  Haven't eaten it yet, but I'm sure it tastes great - how can a cheesecake not taste good! I wanted this to be the perfect Christmas cheesecake, but unfortunately it didn't work out that way.

This is the best cheesecake I have ever made.  The only thing I did different was use 2 teaspoons vanilla and 1 teaspoon almond extract.  I used a stand mixer on speeds 2 and 4 and did not have any cracks.  This was so creamy and smooth!!

Fantastic cheesecake recipe!!! This recipe has wonderful flavor and texture, so smooth and creamy.  I would agree that this isn't a true NY cheesecake in that it's too creamy and not dense enough, but I actually prefer this recipe.  I did follow other suggestions and cooked it in a water bath.  after the hour of baking, run a knife along the edge of the pan to release the edges which prevents cracking.  I also remove from the water bath at that point to dry out any water that may have seeped in. So far I've made the recipe as is and as a pumkin cheesecake; next I'm trying it as a white chocolate peppermint cheesecake with ganache topping. All were huge hits with my guests.

I have made this recipe several times and i absolutely love it. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it came out perfect and even my husband (who hates cheesecake) loved it. The only thing i did different was to add cinnamon to the crust recipe for a little extra flavor and i baked the crust for 10 minutes so it would not come out soggy. After the crust was ready i added the cheesecake to it and cooked it for the recommended time and left it in the oven for 6 hours without even opening the oven. Be sure to start with room temperature ingredients and only use a mixer to mix the cream cheese and the sugar, after that use a wooden spoon and mix by hand. It came out perfect. My daughter in law loves a good cheesecake and she loved this one. I also used the water bath and greased the sides of my springform pan, so i had no cracks. This is literally the best cheesecake i have ever made, and i have made several. If you stick to the recipe as is you will have the best cheesecake and everyone will rave about it! Enjoy.

Made EXACTLY as written with only 1 change - cooking over a water bath. I did make sure all ingredients were room temp, and was very careful not to over mix... also greased the spring form pan. The texture was perfectly smooth and creamy, not dry. It baked perfectly even, and didn't fall what so ever! Changes I'll make next time: make sure it's on the lowest rack in the oven, as the top did crack around the edges slightly, and browned a little more than I like. I may also reduce the sugar slightly next time.

I followed the recipe exactly, but I also made sure that I baked it in a water bath and it turned out beautifully! I've never made a cheesecake that looked and tasted this great. I would recommend that you make this a few days ahead and leave it in the fridge to firm up.

This is my go-to cheesecake recipe that I've made a handful of times now. I cut the sugar down to one cup and add the zest of an orange to the batter which makes it taste so fresh. I also add a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a pinch of allspice into the graham cracker crumbs for the crust. I bake the cake using a water bath by wrapping the spring form in heavy duty aluminum foil so no water seeps. Room temperature ingredients and making sure not to over mix (stand mixer on the lowest setting and mix just to incorporate the ingredients) are really key steps to making sure the cheesecake doesn't crack. 

After the cake cools, I reduce a cup of strawberry jam over medium-low heat, fold in 2 containers of fresh raspberries once the jam has cooled, plus a little more orange zest, and then top the cheesecake with the mixture. 

I've gotten rave reviews with this recipe from my husband who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, from my in-laws and from my family. Great recipe all around.

This is the very first cheesecake I've made. I made it for a family gathering and I got  good comments about it. I made my own flavor additions. I added a teaspoon of lemon to the batter and a cup of crushed walnuts and  a teaspoon of almond essence to the crust. Add and extra tablespoon of butter to make the crumb pack properly. Everyone loved it. Ill make it again. The nuts in the crust were  a bit much. I might leave it out next time.  I also cooked it for 3 hours at 200 degrees. It came out smooth and creamy. It was also really dense, which we all liked.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is better than store bought but I don't have a homemade cheesecake to compare it to. I couldn't let it sit for so long because of time. I also put it in the freezer for about half an hour after cooling. I liked it, you might too.

I followed the recipe exactly, while using a water bath to bake.  It tasted delicious but the top of my cheesecake was burnt and completely black! I just cut away the top and my family enjoyed it this Thanksgiving.  Has anyone else had this problem or have any ideas to remedy this?

I've made cheesecake before & had always been disapointed in the taste.  But this recipe is on the mark! I did not made any changes to it. Even my husband loved it & he's very picky about cheesecake.

This was the first cheesecake I've ever made. I only changed the crust to a shortbread version. I also didn't use any flour and it didn't make any difference. I made this twice and it came out beautifully, both times! Presentation is lovely and the taste is wonderful. It doesn't need anything else.

Oven temp too hot. Definitely overcooked the cake. The flour and milk made it too cakey for me and there is too much sugar in this recipe. I tried this one because I Lost my tried and true one but followed it anyway cause of the good reviews. Just not for me.

I followed the recipe exactly!  No water bath, nothing extra, no reviewers comments and it came out FANTASTIC!! I was so tempted to leave out the sour cream because it just seemed odd but I didn't. My kids say it taste like a restaurant cheese cake. I will certainly make this again.

The taste is excellent.  I made it two times.  One with a water bath and one without.  Both times it cracked.  I've made many cheesecakes without this happening.  I don't know why this recipe cracked on me.

I have made this about 20 times now so here is my review and notes for myself ...  I buy graham cracker crumbs in the box and add sugar, cinnamon and butter generously without measuring.  I pack the crust evenly in my greased (with butter) spring form. I microwave my cold cream cheese bricks until they are soft enough for the mixer.  For milk, I go with a mix of skim and half and half.  I cut the flour down to about a tablespoon and it makes the cake more creamy.
I let the mix sit in the mixer after its mixed up well so that it settles.  I put 2 pie pans of boiling water on the bottom rack and bake at 350 for one hour.  I let it sit in the oven for 3 hours after I turn it off.  Then, I mix up the topping, 2 cups sour crea,. 2 tablespoons sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla.  I spread it on the cake and put it back in the oven at 350 for five minutes.  I cover and put in the frig.  
My cake hasn't cracked since I cut down the flour.  My ingredients are usually not room temp.  
Everyone loves this cake, I get requests for it all the time!

It really wasn't that great...and usually cheesecake is pretty fabulous.  I actually made it twice to see if the mistake was on my end but nope, second time also it was simply *meh* as far as desserts go. There are MUCH better cheesecake recipes here, that are less particular but turn out better too.

This is an amazing cheesecake that my family have loved for many years.  
 This recipe is very easy to follow, you can add anything to it for a variety.
I have added Oreo cookie crumbs, and covered it with a hard chocolate top. 
other additions are adding amaretto, and other liquors

I think this is my favourite recipe on this website. Follow the instructions, don't mix it too much so it's creamy not fluffy, and grease the sides of the springform pan well so it doesn't crack. It should yield the perfect cheesecake.

Baked on 325 instead :-) It came out great! Perfect color, flavor and texture! Make sure to use a water bath and to follow other instructions completely. Best texture after refrigeration! Very good!!

I've made this a few times, following the recipe to the T, and it has come out perfect every time - no cracks, just delicious.  I live in Europe, so I use speculoos cookies for the crust.  My only mistake last time was not following the recipe and taking it out of the fridge a while before serving.  If it's not cold, the texture is not right.  My fault!

I made this recipe as faithfully as I could without a springform pan, having to substitute ricotta for more than half of the cream cheese, cookies for graham crackers and cream with yoghurt for sour cream, and it was beautiful.  Didn't crack, light and creamy, different texture from most familiar cheesecake, but wow!  Thanks for the recipe!

This cheesecake is the most amazing cheesecake I have ever had. Great if you like New York style cheesecake. Beautiful flavor and texture. I used with room temperature cream cheese and it was smooth and delicious. However, every time I made it mine cracked, even after greasing the pan, not overmixing, and not opening the oven for several hours. But I didn't use a water bath because I didn't have a bath big enough to fit my pan. Didn't matter to me, though! It was still a beautiful cheesecake! I added three tablespoons of butter to my crust instead of two because it wasn't holding together. It pairs perfectly with a homemade strawberry topping! Love this cake.

I haven't made this yet, but I think I will soon. It  looks amazing! Oh, by the way, this is totally off topic, but does anyone know how to post recipes? Can anyone do it, or do you have to be part of their, I don't know, team? Thanks!

I thought it was easy to make but kind of grainy, floury in texture. It's possible I overcooked it, but I don't think so. I also used a water bath. I think it was that flour. It's a lot!
Liked the flavor though.

I've tried many times to find the perfect recipe for cheesecake and I have finally found it.  If you enjoy thick and creamy cheesecake this is the recipe for you.  I've made it many times now and I get compliments on it every time.

I made this cheesecake for the first time about a year ago as a birthday cake for my best friend. since then I've made about 7 more...mostly at his request. This recipe is phenomenal! I usually make a strawberry sauce to accompany it, and they go beautifully together. But this cheesecake is great just as it is!

Thank you for this recipe!

The sauce is simply 1 pound of strawberries, hulled and halved, or quartered for bigger ones, juice from 1 medium-large lemon, 1/2 cup of white sugar, cooked down in a small saucepan over medium heat for 15-20 minutes, depending on the thickness you like. you can mush up the strawberry pieces with a wooden spoon in the pan, or throw it in the blender for a smoother mixture. Refrigerate it and serve with your cheesecake! Also great with plain Greek yogurt or over pancakes :)

This recipe is very, very good! Although I was reluctant to do it at first, due to the long waiting to cool time, I tried it anyway and was rewarded. Big time! Creamy, perfectly balanced and delicious! A staple in our family's cookbook from now on! The only change I've made was to substitute the sour cream with greek yogurt, because I can't find any here in Greece..! Thanks for sharing!

This is awesome! The only change I make is to do a shortbread crust- 1 C. flour, 4 T. sugar and 3 Tb. butter- mix together and bake at 400 for 8 minutes before adding cheesecake batter and bake as directed- delicious! I also put sour cream topping- sour cream with 3 T. sugar and a splash of vanilla. spread over top. Drizzle dark chocolate over top- baking chocolate melted w/ a bit of butter and sugar until melted- drizzle over top.

I made this cheesecake last night and it came out perfectly. I did wrap the outside of the pan with tinfoil and I made sure everything was room temp. Eg: eggs sour cream, cream cheese. Left it in the oven for five hours afterwards and no cracks just a perfect cheesecake. Will be making this again for my Nieces wedding, this was a practise one for me before the big day

I loved it because it didn't have that lemony flavor that comes from so many cheesecake recipes that require lemon peel or juice. It was so smooth and creamy; not dry or crumbly at all. I look froward to making it again for friends and stuff!

Since I made my cheesecake in a 9x13 pan, I had to increase the amount of crust I made. So I made the crust with 3 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup of sugar and melted butter, and a teaspoon of cinnamon. I also baked the cheesecake at 325 degrees for an hour and left it in the oven for 7 hours and chilled it in the fridge overnight. It did end up browning at the edges but no cracks showed up! To avoid cracks, I avoided over mixing and placed a pan half filled with water on the rack underneath the one the cheesecake was on.

I am not a big fan of cheesecake BUT I follow this recipe with the exception of the water bath. I tasted it the evening it was done and slightly cooled it was ok. The next day I tasted it it was totally different and absolutely wonderful. My top had a small crack but that was my fault and really folks not the end of the  world. This was so simple and easy will definitely be a keeper. If this is your first time making one like mine and I'm a good cook don't be scared to try you won't be disappointed.

delicious!  husband loves when I make this.  I lighten up the recipe by using the neufchatel cheese, half stevia-half sugar, skim milk, and lite or fat free sour cream.  still comes out delicious.  this recipe is so simple and perfect, love it!

The cheesecake is perfect if you follow the directions exactly,do not over mix or you will crack the cheesecake . make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature if you want that browned New York style cheesecake look do not put in a water bath sit on a cookie sheet, if you want a perfect cheesecake with no Browning light golden color and no cracking put two layers of heavy duty foul and sit in a waterbath do not peek at the cheesecake.  I made this cheesecake at least a dozen times perfect every time

Fabulous, my first attempt to bake a cheesecake and it came out perfect. Only think I changed was the crust, I added 3 tbl spoons of butter and 1/4 cup of sugar, because I bought an original graham cracker. Next time I'll go for the honey graham cracker. I baked it in a water bath but as some reviews mentioned double layer of foil didn't stop the water from getting in. I will try a roasting bag next time. Thank you for the recepie.
Update: I have made this cheesecake many times since and everyone loves it, I used this recepie as a base for flavored cheesecakes and also added a caramel crumble on top. When adding apples or other flavors I baked it for 20 minutes longer.

I was expecting a creamy cheesecake and I ended up with something that more resembled an egg custard. I've made many baked cheesecakes in the past and never really had it turn out like this with this flavour or consistency. However all was not lost, it was still edible and had a pleasant flavour.

Made the recipe with minor changes:  in a 9in pie pan, made for 4 servings, it fits great, except, make more crust than what the recipe calls for at 4 servings.  Baked for 32 minutes and left in the oven with a tiny opening to cool for less than the long hours the recipe calls for.  Cooled for about 1 hour.  I added pure chocolate powder to the crust just because I wanted to try it.  Hope this helps.

Overall a great taste! I put chocolate and caramel syrup over the top with chopped walnuts and everyone said to make it again! However must use a lot more butter with graham cracker crust.

Followed the recipe except for the cooking method and crust because thats what other reviewers said and it turned out amazing.  People think I'm a professional :) 

Used the water bath and reduced the flour by a touch.  Also i only cooled it for an hour or two before sticking it in the fridge and it didnt crack (i butter the sides of my spring form pan really well).

I made this cheesecake this morning, and followed every step perfectly, but when I got it out of the oven it was cracked. It's the Fourth of July, so I topped the cheesecake with cherry pie filling, fresh blueberries, and whipped cream. Although it wasn't the best cheesecake I ever made, it was still delicious!

Followed recipe exactly. Only thing I had issue with was cream cheese. I should've let it soften a little bit first. But no cracking and not too sweet.

I've made this several times and it comes out great every time! I recently made this for the first time for my step dad and he was over heels in love with it. It was great cause its not often that I see him beaming over anything. He said it tasted very professional and couldn't wait for me to make it again for his birthday. Enjoy!

The most amazing cheesecake I have ever been able to make! I followed directions exactly and it was perfect. My only change was halfing the recipe and using a pre-made crust. I don't have a springform pan.

I have been making cheesecakes for a long time. however, I always made them in a pie plate with a similar recipe using about half of each ingredient. this was my first cheesecake using a spring pan. It came out wonderful. 

I used 18 "full sheets" (2 packages) of graham crackers mixed with 1/3 melted butter for crust. 

I made the filling exactly as the recipe called, except I alternated adding the milk and eggs (I also beat each egg prior to adding it to the batter. ...a trick I learned on Emeril a long time ago. it helps the egg incorporate better) *be sure to use all room temp ingredients. 

When pouring cheesecake into pan, I used all the batter minus about 1/3 cup. The batter was about 1/3" from the brim, so very full.. this initially worried me, but it's fine! 

I baked it at 350 for 1 hour, then left the door closed and turned off the oven. when i checked on it thru the door, I was horrified to see the middle was all sunken in and the outsides were fluffy. but. ......after the cake cooled, the sides flattened out and it looked perfect. 

Mine did Crack...but no bigs. I put some strawberries on top and no one knew. 

Try it! Don't be intimidated! This tastes just like a "Cheesecake Factory" cheesecake.

This recipe lived up to its reviews.  I was worried about making it.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and greased the sides of my pan, used only the mixer for the cream cheese and sugar and cooked it for the 60 minutes then left it in the oven for 6 hours without opening the door.  It came out perfect with no cracks.  My family loved it!

I have made this many many times and it is always a hit!  I LOVE THIS RECIPE.
Just a few hints:  ALL ingredients should be at room temperature before you start so the batter is smooth without being overbeaten; instead of greasing your pan use a round piece of parchment paper in the bottom (easy to find in baking aisle) and cut two strips of parchment to go around the sides; and place a baking pan of hot water on the lowest shelf in your oven under the cheesecake.  Changes I made after making it EXACTLY like the recipe:  3 tablespoons butter for the crust; add 1/2 tablespoon ground ginger for the crust (I like the flavor and it cuts the sweetness); and sour cream topping (1 cup sour cream mixed with 1/4 cup white sugar spread on top of cheesecake 10 minutes before it's done & then finish as per recipe).

Finally an EASY cheesecake that works and tastes restaurant-quality.  It was even easier for me than the recipe requires as I did not have the time to leave it cooling in the oven for 6 hours, but did so for only about 2 - 2 1/2 hours.  Still worked great. No cracks! Some reviewers it seems still used the water bath.  I didn't and it turned out fine.  

My crust seems to have gotten a bit over-toasty, but I am beginning to suspect that my oven runs a little hot, so I will adjust accordingly. Great, easy recipe!

This cheesecake is great for starters!  I have been complimented by both family and the office that this looks professional and is one of the best homemade cheesecakes that they've had.  I may have whipped the filling too much the second time I made it, which lead to the surface breaking.  
It is also great served with fresh fruit compote!

After thoroughly reading reviews I made the recipe with cooking at 325 for an hour as many people mentioned - i followed the recipe exactly except i used 2 tb's of flour instead of 4. I cut a slice out of my cheesecake this morning after I let it cool in the oven - it had not set it didn't bake long enough. Really disappointing. I put in back in the oven for a half hour and then threw it in the fridge. Hopefully that will help salvage it, next time I'm following the instructions exactly as they had them.

I found this recipe a couple of years ago and I love it, as is. It was my first attempt at making Cheesecake from scratch and it was a huge success. I switch up the crusts from time to time, but it comes out perfect each time!  It's now a staple at my summertime BBQ's!

This is probably the best cheesecake I have made yet, and I am not new to cheesecake! I also don't normally like plain cheesecake, but this was to die for....serve it with fresh strawberries and watch how it disappears! I will be making this again without a doubt.

This is delicious!   My family loved it.  We were camping in our motorhome when I decided to tackle this, I used an aluminum pan instead of the traditional springform.  It came out great!  I made the crust a little thicker which helped when cooling.  It did not crack it was beautiful and delicious!    Will definitely be making this more often.  By the way my aluminium  pan were shallow only about 1 1/2 inches deep.  This recipe made 3 except for the crust.   My brother in law took one for himself!

This is, by far, the best cheesecake recipe I've tried! It actually tastes like a store bought cheesecake. I used this recipe to make mini cheesecakes and they turned out great! Because I was baking little portions rather than one huge one, I cooked for about 25- 30 minutes. However, I suggest cooking for 20 minutes, which is a bit before the cheesecakes start to rise too much.  After you are done \ LEAVE THEM IN THE OVEN for at least an hour or two to prevent from cracking. Also, I took Morena's advice and used spatula to incorporate the ingredients after beating cream cheese with sugar then milk. (folding motion). This was the best advice for a novice like me. This recipe makes 24 mini cheesecakes (if you are using cupcake pans). 

I also used ~ ¼ cup less sugar than the amount the recipe calls for. It was still sweet enough for my taste.

Loved it! Followed it to a T. Top cracked but thats alright because it was creamy and not too light or heavy.  It was just the perfect consistency.  I topped with strawberry drizzle.  Will make this recipe again!

I love this recipe! It's so easy to make! The only trouble I come across is the cracking. I found that if I divide the mixture into two pie pans instead of one springform it cracks very little. Cracks and all this is my favorite cheesecake recipe!

Rich and delicious!!! I made it for Thanksgiving. I only left it in the oven for 2 hours after turning off the stove and refrigerated it right away and there was no cracking at all. The only change I would make is using a few more graham crackers to make a thicker crust. The cheesecake is so rich and delicious, a big piece can be too much...but I was told it tastes like it is straight out of NYC.

I give this a five based on the input from SCIOTA.

This recipe was delicious! The crust alteration offered by SCIOTA, incorporating a little spice and pecans pieces into the crust...I blended in via a food processor...really makes this an absolute 5!!!

Awesome recipe everyone loved it!

OMG this cheesecake heaven. I'll say I was concerned about the cooking instructions, but don't be. AND don't open the oven door. Just follow the directions, first time my cake didn't crack, browned beautifully, perfectly flat top. AND SO CREAMY.

First attempt at cheesecake and it turned out awesome. Didn't have e right pan but used 2 9 inch regular pie pans and extra left over.... And only baked 35 min because of the shallower pans.

This cheesecake is wonderful.  Mine did crack, I was trying to be careful but maybe over stirred.  And it didn't need to bake for an hour.  I checked mine in 50 minutes and it was already set so I took it out.  Edges are slightly brown but it tastes incredible.  Next time I make it will be more careful with stirring and baking time.

I was planning on making this for thanksgiving for my family.  It didn't exactly work out.  First of all, I used half a cup of butter for the crust because there was no way the mere 2 tbs was going to be enough to stay crust like.  I put the cheesecake in for less than the hour recommended, but my cake still ended up burnt and cracked.  This recipe disappointed.

So good! I followed the filling recipe exactly, although I did warm up the ingredients on the preheating oven so they weren't cold. For the crust, I used 1 sleeve crushed crackers, 1/2 stick butter, and 1/3 cup brown sugar. SO GOOD - but should have doubled. Wrapped spring pan in two layers of big, heavy duty foil, no issues with water coming in. I poured a full kettle of boiling water in large roasting pan bath. Put in 350 oven for 60 min, then just turned oven off. No cracks and perfectly set.

All I can say is WOW!! I followed the recipe exactly and my cheesecake turned out amazing. The only thing I forgot was to grease the pan in the beginning, so the cheesecake did crack. But it was easily covered up by my topping. I made a lemon blueberry compote using half a bag if frozen blueberries, the zest and juice from one lemon and sugar to sweeten it up. Simmered until thickened and poured on top of cheesecake. It was my first cheesecake and everyone said it tasted gourmet! Seems like a fool proof recipe, I enjoyed it a lot!

Well I am here to tell you that the reviews are true.  You cannot ruin this cheesecake if you follow the recipe.  I didn't even have a mixer, I did the mixing by hand and remember DO NOT NOT OVER BEAT. Take your time it is so worth it.  Also Don't over bake.  BAKE 1 HOUR THEN LEAVE IT IN THE OVEN 6 HOURS, DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR TILL THEN.  It came out perfect and it IS NY CHEESECAKE!!!

Back in the 90's there was a show called 'Martin', on it was a character named "Shenay-nay"! Her trademark saying was, "Oh my Guuudness!". Well, haven't thought about that young lady in years, why did she come to my mind when I ate my first piece?!?! Oh my Guuudness!!!!! I can't believe I made this. I am a scattered cook with not a lot of confidence honestly, but this was awesome! I decreased flour to 2 Tbs, tweaked crust: 1 1 /2 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. finely chopped Unsalted nuts ( pecans), 1/4 c. melted butter, 1 tsp. cinn. No water bath was used but would like to try so I can measure difference. I read reviews b4 I started, only changed what was necessary for my taste, because I knew I wouldn't want a cakey cheesecake (flour), and love a good crust on my desserts. I actually took it out after 1 1/2 hrs, no cracks!!! made a simple topping: 8 oz sour cream ,2 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract. If there were any imperfections, it would have been covered by this yummy topping. Used strawberry pie filling to gather berries from and put them in two rows around edges. I never review/rate anything, but I had to let you all know.......FoolProof! Amazing! Thank all who reviewed this recipe before I attempted it!

I've made a few cheesecakes and this is the best. I prefer more butter in the crust but that's the only change. Everything else is perfect.

Cheesecake is fickle; I'll be the first to say that.  I've made a couple of them, typically with minimal ingredients: crust of butter and graham crackers; filling of eggs, cream cheese, sugar, and a little vanilla.  Sometimes it cracks, and sometimes it doesn't.  I incorporated all of my tricks into this recipe:  soften the cream cheese, don't overmix, don't open the oven door at all during baking and a couple hours after.  After several hours I opened the oven door to a glorious...crack in the shape of an X decorating the top.  After some chilling, I tried a slice.  Still runny in the middle.  Oh well.  This time was definitely a miss.  The filling tastes delicious (needs a little less crust), but I'll have to fiddle with the method a little more to get it just right.  Edited to add:  okay, so I'm coming back the next day (after leaving my cheesecake in the freezer all night) with my tail between my legs.  I should've known better, too:  THOROUGHLY CHILL YOUR CHEESECAKE.  Firmed up nicely and tasted perfect.  2ND EDIT:  I think that the crust ratio is off here.  A good graham cracker crust is usually 2 parts cracker to 1 part butter by weight; I used 12 crackers (about 6 ounces) and 6 tablespoons of butter.

Divine!!! Love this recipe. I leave out the milk though, because it makes it too soft and I use brown sugar instead of white. This is a keeper. I have made it many times and it works out perfectly every time. If it does crack, then I cover the cake with fruit or ganache or caramel.

Such a great Cheesecake recipe!!!! Was my first time making cheesecake and was a huge hit! Did use a water bath in the oven while cooking however. Didn't crack at all...left it in the oven until it was cool. Tons of compliments and requests for the recipe! Highly recommend---- A+++++

Easiest and best Cheesecake recipe ever!  Don't change a thing.  Mine did NOT crack.  I bake all of my cheesecakes in a water bath.  I think the steam helps them not crack.  Make sure you wrap your springform pan in foil first.

This was delicious.  Mine really cracked, but that didn't affect the taste.  Next time I'll try to mix it less per other reviewers.  Anyway, we just trimmed the top part off and covered with fresh, sliced strawberries, which made it look gourmet.

This is the best cheesecake recipe I have ever made if you truly like cheesecake that tastes like they should. It is thick cheesy and creamy. I have made this lots of times and everyone thinks I am the queen of cheesecakes thanks to the recipe.

Here in Belgium this kind of cheesecake is unknown. While living in Canada I fell in love with them! The first time I made it - it cracked - the whole family and the friends loved it! The cake was gone in seconds and they all asked for the recipe. For a while I am keeping this for myself, for I want to shine alone with this cake!

Best recipe for cheesecake on earth I enhance it by swapping normal sugar with extremely smooth sugar + if want to prevent crack and dark sides use 2 things cook it in water pool or add 2 bowls with water on each side of your cake ban additional to that I'm using deep cake ban its not ment for cheescake but I found out it cooks better in it beside adding cooking paper around and in bottom.

I made this recipe last year about this time and it was THE best cheesecake I've ever had.  I'm making it again today, for my daughters 20th Birthday - it was her request.  This cake is smooth, velvety, and absolutely delicious.  I suppose if you're looking for something that tastes like you bought it off the grocery store shelf, you may not like it, but if you're looking for a taste of real Cheesecake heaven, look no further!  I followed the recipe to the "T" but since it cracked last time, I will try a water bath method.

This was my first time making a cheesecake, I followed the directions but when the cheesecake baked it rose above the springform pan and cracked on the edges. It also got really dark brown even though I only baked it for the directed 60 min's. I left it in the oven for about 5 hours and when I removed it was really cracked so I don't know if I over mixed the batter or what. I did make one mistake and didn't place the pan on a cookie sheet so I'll correct that the next time.  I'll try it again though to see if I get a different outcome.

Tried this for the first time and only reduced the flour by a little bit, that was my only change.  It is super delicious!!!  Definitely a very heavy and dense cheesecake, not the fluffy kind.  I made a blueberry sauce (Martha Stewart's, actually) to go on top, and that made it even better.  Highly recommend!!

For my son's birthday we went to Cheesecake Factory.  He also asked me to make a cheesecake.  Everyone liked this cheesecake more than the one's at the restaurant!

It is so creamy and delicious and was simple to make.  It doesn't even need a topping!  YUM!

Made for a card night with a bunch of friends was a huge hit. Made sure I read others on watching for ways to prevent cracking and it worked well for me.  Had a few but they were small and you didnt even noticed after it cooled.

I made this for my sister's birthday.  I have never made a cheesecake before.  My springform pan is 10", not 9", which was a good thing as it wouldn't have fit in the 9".  I used 15 whole graham crackers, which I don't think was intended as there wasn't nearly enough butter...I just added added more and went with it.  Due to a physical disability, I used a mixer for all the mixing, instead of a wooden spoon.  I followed all the directions, but my cheesecake did split.  I'm not sure if this was because I used the mixer or if I didn't grease the pan enough.  No matter, it was delicious!!  I will definitely make again and try greasing the pan more liberally and work on mixing enough but not too much.  A crack would not be a deal breaker...there would be plenty of ways to disguise it.  I would be totally happy if I were served this in a fine dining restaurant.

Best cheesecake ever!!! We have to do this recipe for one of my brother's birthday's. He is so funny!!! Oh, if you  want a cheesecake and don't have sour cream for it. You can use one tablespoon of lemon juice plus one cup of evaporated milk. I've done it and it taste the same!

This will be my only cheesecake recipe I use. It came out just like the directions said, it was a thing of beauty !,I reccomend you make it early in the morning or late at night, that 5 hours in the oven ties up the oven,and you need every hour to make it perfect,like I did, I didn't use a mixer I used a fork for each egg and a spoon for the sugar and cream cheese. Fantastic !

It's a simple recipe that's easy to follow. I loved the results. I poured my mixture into pre-made graham cracker tins. I used 5-pkgs of cream cheese, and increased my ingredients to the next level. My mixture allowed me to pour 3-tins and still had a little extra. It was delicious!

This is a great recipe. I followed Morena's advice the second time cause the first time i was having a hard time blending it with a spoon and over beat it and it cracked. It was still an excellent cheesecake even though i cracked it. I like it with a Graham cracker crust instead i just used 2 cups Graham cracker crumbs and a half cup butter with 4 tbs sugar to male a wonderful crust.

Made it as described and everyone loved it. I wrapped my spring form pan in foil and placed in a water bath. Cooled with oven door closed for 4 hours then refrigerated over night. Cooked perfectly no cracks and had a slightly golden top

Worth the wait!! Just be careful not to over mix!!  This is the real deal, famity from new York gave the approval for this recipe...I didn't have time to let the cake set for the full 5 hrs (1 1/2 hr was all) since it was christmas morning and I was travelling.  I allowed the cake to cool for about 15 on the counter top after 90 mins of cooling in the oven and placed in a cooler for 1 hr road trip and it held up just fine..some even said it was the best cake they ever had!

I've made this many times.  I would not make any other NY cheesecake  but this one!  It always comes out fabulous and everyone loves it every single time!  I always make sure I have fresh strawberries and strawberry glaze on had just in case on a rare occasion the cake crakes so I can camouflage the crake before serving.

This is really good! I'm no expert baker, but I think this turned out surprisingly well. We ate a few slices the same day I baked it and it tasted okay, but after 24 hours in the fridge it's really good. I followed the recipe carefully, but as it was baking in the oven, I read some reviews saying I should let the cream cheese reach room temperature before mixing. After baking the cake for one hour, I turned the oven off and let it cool in the oven, door closed. After an hour, the cake cracked and deflated, still in the oven, door never opened. Maybe it's because the cream cheese was cold? I don't know. But I don't really care, that's just aesthetics, right?

This tasted delicious, however it cracked like crazy. I followed the recipe precisely, even staying up until 2am so that it could cool down with the oven, but when I pulled it out it was cracked worse than any of my cheesecakes ever have been. Oh well! It's the taste that counts in our house!! Also, I always make a chocolate chip cookie crust rather than a graham cracker crust, it's delish!!

I made this recipe 3 days ago, it's gone now, and I wish calories were a myth because I want to make it again. I don't understand the bad revies this has. mine turned out to be creamy, rich, sweet, cheese flavoured, light, and all over delicious and decadent. I followed the recipe exactly, while putting to good use my own experience baking cheesecakes; always grease the mold so it won't stick to the sides and break, always let it set inside the oven with the door cracked a bit so the cake won't crack, for a moister cake always bake in a ban marie, (I didn't use the ban marie and it turned out great though). Thank you for the recipe.

Suggestion: use room temp butter instead of melted when making the crust.  No need to pre-bake. I like a thick crust so I just judge by texture.

My first time making a cheesecake and I chose this recipe based on all the good reviews.  It has good texture, but mine did crack.  I tried not beating it too much as other reviewers have mentioned and I did put it in the oven and left it alone for 5+ hours, but it still cracked. I think it needs more sugar, a little bland to me, but others love it.  I will make this recipe again, but adding a little more sugar and making sure I don't overmix it.

Outstanding taste.  I like a cheesecake that is not TOO sweet and slightly dry.  It did crack but that is my fault.  I was in a hurry and could not wait to get everything to room temp AND I forgot to spray my sides really well.  That being said, I had some raspberry filling and swirled it into the batter before baking since it was Valentine's day.  Baked one hour and shut oven off.  It set up well aside from the cracks and the taste.....holy cow..... ate enough to make myself sick feeling....lol.   Great basic cheesecake.  My daughter is a cheesecake fiend and said it was better than anything she has ever tried at a restaurant (even the one that has Cheesecake in it's name...lol).

This is FANTASTIC!! I used half stevia and half sugar.  I used gluten free graham crackers.  This is very versatile (as are most cheesecakes) when you are opting to make some changes.  I am going to  make this recipe again sometime today.

I made this. Followed the recipe, and it turned out great. The taste is spot on. My family and my girlfriend loved this cake. The consistency is not like a classic cheese cake, but a little bit more sticky, as peanutbutter - just not that much at all. I really like it like this, though some might not.

Brilliant!!!! I'm from NY...so I can say this is right on point. I changed the graham cracker crust to CHOCOLATE graham cracker crust. Not a fan of the plain. Browned a little too much baking for an hour...next time I will drop it to 50-55 minutes. I also use a water bath. But leaving it in the oven those extra hours is the real trick. Cheers Chantal!!

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake.  The recipe was so easy and it turned out perfectly!!  Instead of crushing up graham crackers, I used 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs.  The next time I make this, I will add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of sugar to my crust to make it just a little sweeter.  I also used whipped cream cheese instead of the block.  This made for a very smooth cheesecake.  My friend's daughter from Ohio was visiting with us and she and I couldn't get enough!!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I made this, following the recipe perfectly.  It looked great!  I thought it tasted horrible though.  It is mushy, and flavorless. Also, the crust was dry and really didn't hold together well.  Needed more butter, and could have used some sugar.

I had never made a cheesecake before, but after receiving a springform pan for Christmas, I was aching to make one.  I followed this recipe to the letter and even let it cool in the oven for five hours.  The result was a cheesecake so amazing that my family demanded a second one the following week.  The flavor is so incredible, and the density is ideal.  I challenge anyone to find a better cheesecake in a restaurant.  I'm making another one this weekend, and everyone is very excited, including me.

I followed the directions EXACTLY and it still split, so i had to top it with strawberries to hide all the cracks. I served it at thanksgiving and some people liked it, but i thought it was kinda bland. It didnt really taste like cheesecake.

Ok so growing up in newyork I had some  good cheesecakes, this just fails in flavor, which for me was really disappointing. A true ny style cheese cake has a bite in the same context as a X cheddar has that twang to it. It was smooth and creamy no cracks at all but still lacking in flavor that would also hide that eggy/custard flavor.

This was yummy :) I added cherry extract and that gave it a really really yummy flavor! It wasn't super pretty looking but it held up really well and I suggest using the extract.

I followed the recipe exactly as it said even though it seemed like it needed to bake about 5 more minutes. It turned out awesome; so creamy and tasty. I used a Graham cracker crust recipe from another recipe but that is not the showcase here - the cheesecake was super good!  We top with cherry pie filling.

I would rate this less but that would be wrong. The consistency, fluffiness, MILD sweetness- all qualities some LOVE, but not me. Don't get me wrong, it's all but gone- eaten by the other members in the house, but it was not as rich as a Cheesecake Factory slice...which was what I really wanted.

i don't get the hype over this cheesecake.  i admit, i messed with the ingredients and changed the ratio to suit 3 packages of cream cheese.  it was so cheesy and mousse like. would have to make this again properly one day.  however, don't see how the cake can be redeemed.

Great recipe! I adapted it to my gluten free needs. I used gluten free "graham" crackers for the crust and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of flour and it baked up just fine! Mine cracked, but only because I didn't follow others' recommendations. I topped it with a raspberry sauce I made from frozen raspberries, sugar and cornstarch and the whole dessert was fabulous!

I followed recipe to the tee. It came out perfect. I will definitely be making this again. I added can of pineapple pie filling as topper along with whipping cream and cherries for looks. It belonged in magazine. Oh yes, I do believe in the water bath while cooking.

Several problems with this recipe even thouhh I followed iy exactly. First off through entire process, I hamd beat the batter so not to over beat it.
1. This should be done in a water bath found that the edge of the cheesecake was over done. Was dark and dry.
2. Also, I find that the oven was entirely to hot at 350. Lower it to 325. Found that the cheescake overcoagulated and yes it did crack.
4. Since the cracking was caused by the trapping of air. It would help that if the eggs should be the last thing that is  .  Placed in the batter. I have cooked a lot of cheescakes I found this to be average.

I've made this a BUNCH of times over the years..It's WONDERFUL !!  My hubby took one to work for a contest today ( Christmas Eve ) and won first place....I topped it with Cherry topping. I will say that I have found that making it at least 24 hrs in advance makes the texture set. I love this recipe !!!

Perfecto! Lo he hecho en varias ocasiones y siempre queda riquísimo. Mi recomendacion es que en vez de engrasar el molde (como otras personas sugieren), utilizes "parchment paper". Siempre lo hago en baño de María y protejo el molde con papel de aluminio.  (= Perfect! I've done it several times and is always delicious.

I'm not sure what went wrong with mine.  I checked on it in the oven after 6 hours cooling and it is not cooked all the way. :(   Mine is also severely cracked.  Maybe it had to be something I did.

This is a good cheesecake..I was given compliments on it,it had a good texture and flavor. However the majority of my friends requested I go back to my old recipe from the back of the graham cracker crumb box. This one is very very similar but to time consuming with the coolong in the oven and then the fridge. I dont use a water bath, i let mine cool on the counter for an hour then in the fridhe for four and no cracks...however I choose to cool mine overnight always as it brings more flavor and better texture..

Loved this recipe, instead of regular milk I used carnation sweetened condensed milk. This gave it a richer flavor and creamier texture.

This was great cheesecake and everyone loved it for Thanksgiving.  I would try to cook this at a lower temp next time,  as the edges were too brown for me.  The taste also didn't jump out at you.  I would try less milk and less flour next time.  I also did not like the crust.  While it was easy to make the crust, I just think it would be worth taking a little extra time to make a homemade crust. As other reviewers suggested DO NOT OVER MIX THIS! So this all being said, if you don't change a thing, it turns out good, but for the people that want much better than good, you will need to change things a bit.

It was a hit!
I made this for Thanksgiving and it was great. I substituted 2 of the 4 packs of 8 oz regular Philly cheese with two 1/3 less fat Philly cheese. And I used 2% milk. It was really easy to make. Although I let it sit for 6 hours in the oven, it slightly cracked. It wasn't a deep crack though. I layered the cake with a can of cherry topping and ta-da. It looked AND tasted awesome!

I have made this twice so far. It is a great recipe. The only thing I change is the crust. I tried a crust that I found on this site but it was not what I was looking for. So this time I'm going to add more butter and add sugar to the crust recipe and see how it turns out.

I was looking for a good cheesecake recipe to make for my husband's birthday.  I am not a great baker or cook by any means, so I was worried about how this would turn out.  First try, I went the whole hour at 350 and the cheesecake was overcooked.  Also, I overmixed and it cracked, not to mention I had never heard of a 'water bath' before, therefore I had not used it, so there was a grand canyon crack.  Overall, my first try was good, just not great.  It took me a couple trys to figure out the right temperature & cook time (mine ended up being about 330 at about 48 min, just kept checking on it to make sure the top didn't overcook), don't over mix and get the waterbath concept.  At about the 3 try, I had it figured out and needless to say they have been DELICIOUS!  I have also used half vanilla/half almond extract to give a different flavor.

If you want the perfect cheesecake that is dense and not runny - this is it! I have searched and tried out different cheesecake recipes and this is by far THE BEST. I now always make this and friends and family always request it for gatherings. This is a definite keeper and I recommend this recipe to everybody! Thanks Chantal!

This is an ok tasting cheesecake. As a novice, this is my first attempt at any cheesecake requiring an oven. I am proud that it didn't crack, the color and texture was pretty spot on, but I am quite disappointed in the flavor. I was expecting a much richer flavor. -Wayne

Omg!!!! This recipe was great. My first time making a cheesecake and it turned out perfect. I only used 2Tbs of flour and i did a water bath. I also made a pecan shortbread for the crust. It did not crack at all. It was thick and creamy.

The only problem I had with this cheesecake is that after I put it in the oven it cracked! I dont know what I did! But I did make a few changes... Instead of cream cheese I used neufelatchel cheese (taste the same but just healthier) and for the top I made my own blueberry glaze. For the blueberry glaze I did 2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
1/2 cup water
1/2 cup sugar
2 tablespoons fresh orange juice
2 tablespoons cornstarch, mixed with 2 tablespoons cold water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Zest of 1 Orange
1. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the blueberries, 1/2 cup of water, sugar and orange juice. Stir frequently, and bring to a low boil.
2. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of cold water.
3. Slowly stir the corn starch into the blueberries, taking care not to crush the blueberries. Simmer until the homemade blueberry sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, about 5 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and gently stir in vanilla and orange zest.

This is only about the 5th cheesecake ive made, but i wasnt really pleased with the final result. When i think new york cheesecake, i think more of that cream cheese flavour, and all i seem to pick up is alot of egg. I like the method of cooking with turning the oven off, but i only let mine sit for about 2 hours in there, because the edges were starting to turn a bit brown. I also got a crack in there, but definatly not blaming that on the recipe, i just covered mine with cherries.

Loved this recipe!! Got rave reviews from friends and family - tastes exactly like the ones at the shops!! Next time I will use 3 packets of cream cheese instead of 4, and reduce the rest of the ingredients by that fraction. Loved the taste! It was a bit rich for us, so reducing the cake portion will be perfect =]

Thanks Chantal! excellent recipe!! ^^

This is by far the best New York style cheesecake recipe that I have tried.  It is rich in flavor, thick, and just down right GOOD. I add strawberry topping to mine, and it is a huge hit! I can't thank you enough for this one!!

My daughters favorite dessert is cheesecake - I don't make it cause mine is usually dry/cracked. BUT for her 40th surprise B.Day Party I just had to. I read so much about making one and this was the recipe I chose. I did cut the flour to 1/2 the amount - I've done it with the full amount and it was not near as creamy - so if you like a "dense" cake use the full amount. I put boiling water in a pan on the bottom shelf - room temp. ingreds - hand beat everything after the cr. ch./sugar -  greased/floured entire pan - baked for 3 1/2 hours at 225 degrees - knifed around the edge when it came out - let it set 3 hrs. in the oven with door closed - set on counter to cool a bit more - SHOULD HAVE: set in the refrigerator for a hour or so before removing pan only because it bulged on the side a tiny bit...but still didn't crack. THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T DO WAS TO PUT PARCHMENT PAPER IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN - so i just set the cake with bottom connected on serving plates. There was a problem of serving and not getting the entire bottom crust with the cake. NO ONE CARED!!! THIS CAKE WAS SO CREAMY AND YUMMY. TWO PEOPLE WHO MAKE CHEESECAKES ALL THE TIME SAID IT WAS DA BOMB!!! I used crushed Heath bar in the middle and on top since thats her favorite candy bar. 
I THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART!!! I used to work in a wonderful bakery (though we never made cheesecake) and I love to bake - but my kids never cared for my cheesecake - so I just gave up - they now think "I'm Da Bomb"!!

I made this recipe in a glass pie dish and 21 mini cupcake size ones for my neighbors. They turned our great. I skipped the cooling in the oven. No cracking here. I put a pie dish of water on the second oven rack. For this I reduced the temp to 300 F. Pie one took an hour. Cupcakes took 10_ 15 min depending on your oven.

I made this cheesecake yesterday and it is absolutely amazing! Everyone who tried some loved it! But you can't leave it in the oven for 5 to 6 hours because it burnt my cheesecake. Not the inside but the top of it was turning black. So I'm baking it again today and I'm going to take it out after an hour and a half maybe two because it was done cooking at 5 and even though I turned the oven off, around 8 the kitchen smelled like something was burning. So today I'm baking another one and hopefully it won't burn a little.

Made cheesecake for the first time using this recipe. Found it to be simple to make and very delicious. Just follow the directions and you will be fine. It makes a dense, firmer style cake. This recipe is a keeper, everyone I've served it to really likes it.  Topped it with a fresh blueberry topping once and it was amazing. Enjoy!

I made this recipe for a get-together and it was a HUGE hit! I topped it with some strawberries that I cooked stove-top with sugar and vanilla and then drizzled the whole thing with melted milk chocolate. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

I like to experiment but since this was my first time making a cheesecake I made the recipe as is and it was absolutely perfect, a huge hit with family and friends!  It was gone within a day! I've already had a request for the recipe. I read others' comments about cheesecakes and decided to bake in a 1 inch water bath covering the pan with foil to prevent water from seeping in and I believe this prevented it from cracking.  The longer you leave in the fridget the better it gets! Thank you so much for this recipe!

I make cheesecakes on a regular basis...not sure if I did something wrong but it didnt taste like cheesecake! I expect that rich taste and heavy consistency and I didnt get it with this recipe...it tasted quite bland eggie! I do know cheesecakes quite well and have won first place for my pecan pie cheesecake! Just my opinion!

My first cheesecake ever. OK. I've read all the reviews; good and bad. Here's my take. I followed the directions exactly except I PUT A PAN WITH WATER IN THE OVEN with the cheesecake. I didn't over mix but I needed to mix it to the "satiny" stage. 
Pros: texture is creamy and soft. No cracks. Cheesecake is picture perfect. First bite is amazing. 
Cons: crust was soggy even though I baked it prior to filling. After the first few bites I could taste the egg. Almost reminded me of a sweet deviled egg. Took forever. 
Next time: I'll use 2 eggs only. I'll add more vanilla and lemon zest. I'll add more butter to crust and cinnamon. 
Good recipe just tweak to your specific taste.

Mine turned golden brown on top (yuck), and cracked. Not to mention, this thing is 3" high in a springform pan. 

The crust tasted like sawdust, dry, thick, bland, horrible crust. It pushed that 'cheesecake' button, so I'll give it two stars, but won't be making it again.

This is a good recipe. The taste was perfect and so was the texture. If you like a more tangy cheesecake, I would suggest adding some lemon zest to the recipe. Anyway, I followed the recipe to the T and it still cracked. Yes, I did grease the pan (with a baking spray that contains flour), so the cake pulling away from the sides as it cooled was not the issue. And, yes, I did turn off the oven and left it in there with the door closed as it cooled for 6 hours. I would suggest using this recipe, but water bathing the cake as it bakes. I will try that next time and write about the results. PS I iced it with a sour cream frosting and topped it with strawberries which not only hid the cracks, but tasted amazing!

TIP FOR CRACKS: I have found out that the best way for dealing with cracks in this cake is to use a hand whisk. Add ingredients one at a time and gently mix everything together(don't use machines for this cake). Do not mix fast because this creates bubbles in the batter. This is a delicate cake to make so be gentle.

Unlike most of the other negative posts, mine did NOT crack. In fact it is like pudding in  the center...not cooked.  I used a pan of water under the rack instead of a water bath and it STILL didnt cook.

The flavor is ok (too eggy tho) and it is yellow (from the eggs?  I used yard eggs and they have more color than grocery store.)  

The texture around the outside ( where it is not runny) is good.  I will try another's suggestion and freeze this in balls dipped in chocolate...as is, we will not eat it.

Absolutely delicious. Creamy and not too sweet. Mine did crack a little, even following the directions exactly, but I was adding a cherry topping anyway, so it didn't matter. It's a keeper for sure!

I've made this several times now.  I always put a pan of water below the cheesecake to prevent cracking. This recipe is good plain or swirled with melted chocolate.  Yum!

i was so excited to make this recipe for my husband who LOVES cheesecake, the creamier version. i'm 23, pretty much a beggining baker lol. i didnt realize how technical cheesecake was! my husband said i chose a very difficult recipe. but it turned out SO AMAZING!!! i will never buy another fake cheesecake :) i did look through the comments and used a few changes they mentioned. i let my cream chz reach room temp. before i started. i cut down the flour to 2 tbsp so it would be creamier. I did use a water bath but putting it in an oven bag didnt work the bottom still got lil wet. i added a sprinkle of nutmeg, cinniamon, and sugar to the crust mix. one thing i didn't know and no one mentioned it was to sift the flour into the batter mix. i ended up wit little clumps i had to break up. then before i put it in the oven i dropped it on the counter (a trick my granny taught me to get air bubbles out of cake batter) im not sure if that really made a difference or not. but i let it cook for 60 min without opening oven then i turned off oven and left it for 3 1/2 hours then put it in fridge. it turned out sooooo beautiful. i got my husband some strawberry filling in the can and he went to town on the cheesecake lol. he even told his uncle about it (husband gm of jerry js, uncle is the owner of the franchise) :D i will def. be making this for family reunion or christmas to share wit the family!

The Cheese part of the cheesecake was good, but the crust wasn't very good at all. It was too crumbly after I baked it and it had a bland taste. I think the butter should be increased in the crust.

This cake was edible, but I rated it one star because it doesn't deserve the five stars it gets by a long shot. There wasn't enough room in a nine inch springform pan for this recipe--it was so overfilled that it ended up breaking. I've never broken a cheesecake before! I recommend other testers use a ten inch springform pan. Secondly, one hour wasn't NEARLY enough time to cook this cheesecake. Since the recipe called for the cake to sit in the oven six hours after, I figured it would set better---WRONG. This cake was beautifully browned but TOTALLY raw in the middle. Really? I ended up cooking it another half an hour and since it was already broken, I just topped it and refrigerated it. My tips would ultimately be to use a ten inch springform (which I had at home anyway...ugh!)and to cook for an hour to an hour and a half. Overall, I would just choose a different cheesecake recipe. Disappointing!

I love the recipe but for some reason I can't get the top to come out white like on the picture; mine comes out slightly brownish from cooking. Do they cover the top with something to maintain the color to match the inside?

I had never made a 'real' cheesecake before; in fact I bought a springform pan just to make this recipe. The recipe that came on the insert of my new Nordic Ware pan was this exact same recipe! It turned out perfectly and was wonderful. My husband said it was the best cheesecake he'd ever had. A+ for the recipe, F for the plagiarism.

First time ever making any kind of cheesecake and it wowed my husband and family:) Followed directions exactly, didn't use a water bath as others suggested, and no cracks. The only thing I added was a little sprinkle of cornstarch for extra density. This cheesecake had the perfect consistency and wasn't too sweet. Topped mine with strawberry preserves, chocolate, and fresh strawberries and it looked and tasted like something you'd see in a cooking magazine. I had to hide 2 small slices for me and my husband because it was gobbled up in an hour. Thanks for a great recipe.

Wow delicious! I had never made a cheesecake before so for my first time this one came out great! I did not use a water bath so I had one small crack and my cream cheese was apparently still too cold so I had some lumpy spots. I also was not sure what one graham cracker was. I used 15 whole large rectangular crackers and I think that was too much so I added extra butter. It worked out fine since my family likes a thick graham cracker crust. I will definitely make it again!

I want to try this recipe but i don't have a springform pan. Can anyone suggest a substitute? Can a heavy glass pan properly covered with butter paper on the sides be used?

WONDERFUL cheesecake! It's so easy to tweak the recipe to suit your personal taste, too. I add a lemon meringue filling as a top layer. YUM!! I saved this recipe. Thank you!

I followed the recipe as written, using the video as a guide.  It was very easy to make.  I agree whole-heartedly with another reviewer who said this was "like cheesecake" but it was not the kind of cheesecake I expected.  The richness and density just were not there.  I topped it with freshly picked strawberries and strawberry glaze and those additions made it look beautiful.  I was expecting a dense and creamy texture with a sweeter, more buttery crust.  To me, cheesecake should be so rich that you couldn't possibly eat more than a small sliver, and this missed that benchmark.  That's just me.  I feel that if I'm going to spend the calories they should be worth it.  On to the next one!

So...My dad, who is super picky absolutely loved this and said it was better than others he had tried.  I do recommend adding a little more graham crackers for the crust, but that's a personal preference.  Now, mine did crack, but I've read that could be caused by over-whipping the mix.  Be careful with this step and you should have a beautiful, delicious cheesecake

Super tasty cheesecake. I used this as the middle layer of a cake (sandwiched between to layers of chocolate cake) and everyone loved it. I would caution people to not add the flour at the same time as vanilla, as some others have done. I'm sure it's fine without the flour as well. 

I did bake it in a water bath because... well, it's a cheesecake. I didn't let it cool for quite as long as the recipe suggested (time constraints) but it was still excellent. No cracking, delicious and rich.

Made this without the crust. Burned a little on top and when it came out of the oven it felt like a custard. But cut off the top layer, put it on top of a red velvet cake (after the crumb coating), and covered it with cream cheese frosting. Froze overnight and by the time I got to my Fathers house for Father's Day, it was thawed and delicious! My family loved it! One thing though, instead of leaving the oven closed for 6 hours for it to set, I cracked the oven and let it sit for 2 hours.

This was my first cheesecake I ever made. I was making it for my boyfriend's birthday and I was beyond nervous how it would come out. It came out wonderful. My boyfriend loved it so much. He never stopped complementing it. I already have a request to make another one. I topped the cheesecake with chocolate covered strawberries and blueberries. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe. It is quite the keeper!

The 5-6 hours in the oven didn't work. I got 1-1/2 hours in and it split very deep like you cut the top open. Taste good, but that part failed.

I made this recipe without any modifications except that I did not let it cool in the oven, as I was in a rush -- and I took it out of the fridge a little early before serving. It did not crack.

It was amazing! The texture was perfect, it was rich but not heavy. Many people had a second slice and got a lot of compliments on it. 

Not very work intensive, but really nice cake. I topped with fresh strawberries 

Highly recommend even for cheesecake novices, like myself!

I read the comments and followed all the directions including the water bath.  It was much easier that I expected and it turned out great!  The taste and texture were purfect, exactly what I was looking for.  I did get a crack but I also forgot to grease the springform ring.  I've never made a cheesecake before but I have eaten alot!!  It's my goto dessert when I go to a resturant.  I don't think I'll order it again knowing how easy and inexpensive it is to make your own!!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday as cheesecake is his favorite. I had a 9.5" pan instead of 9" so increased the recipe slightly and cooking time by 10 minutes. It could have cooked a even a little longer as the consistency in the middle wasn't as firm as it should be. Other than that, it was perfect! The taste and texture was just right, sour cream and all. Don't alter this recipe before giving it a chance. Definitely a keeper.

This DID make a good cheesecake, however, the simple recipe you get on the back of a Kraft cream cheese tub does the job equally well. I'll come back to this when I want to feel like a real baker, haha!

Holy cow.  The taste is perfect!

I did have a bit of user error... I followed directions but it cracked as it cooled... but it was still probably "user error"

This cheesecake is AWESOME! It cooked without a flaw! It tastes best if it sits in the fridge overnight. LOVED it!

I just made this recipe for the 4th time. I recently bought a store bought cheesecake that tasted completely bland considering I am accustomed to this recipe now. I follow some of the variations, a 10 in pan, a water bath, and a sprinkle of lemon juice. Make sure to let it chill overnight to really let the flavors develop it makes a huge difference!

Had to double the butter for the crust or it wasn't going to hold together, crust definitely needs some sugar, as written is very bland!!  The cheesecake part was pretty good, very creamy and thick.

I found this recipe here and I have been making it for years.  I think it is the perfect cheesecake.  It is thick and creamy and delicious and everyone raves about it.  I encourage everyone to try this recipe.  It is simple and easy to make and so lovely.

This is not the best cheesecake recipe - at all!  it is runny.  i would omit the milk.  it was hard to pour into muffin tins and made an enormous mess.  i have made cheesecake about a hundred times, and will go back to my old recipe immediately.  what a waste of money

This cheesecake is awesome! Turns out perfect every time! I like to use a blueberry sauce on top. I also have tried an Oreo crust and that is really good too! I use a water bath which really helps with cracking no matter which cheesecake recipe I use.

I followed the Chantal's New York Cheesecake recipe very carefully except I used ready made graham cracker crusts (I'm so lazy). I put two of them into a pre-heated 350 F oven and 25 minutes later, the tops were burned drak brown and the rest of the cake was not cooked enough. Perhaps my oven runs hot...?

Great recipe---I varied it last time I made it by dropping dollops of warm raspberry preserves on top, then swirling gently with a knife.  My family absolutely loved it!

Tried this recipe, unfortunately I have to agree with the negative comments. This cheesecake is more custard like. While it doesn't taste bad, it isn't cheesecake like I expected and is not close to anything I would think of for New York Cheesecake.

I've used several recipes from this site, and this is the first time I've ever actually left a review. This is the BEST cheesecake ever! The recipe was so easy to follow, and the end product was so good! I'll be making this one again....very soon.

Took me many times to perfect it, but it was worth it. EVERYONE that has had it, said that it's the best they've ever had. Better than Cheesecake factory cheesecakes! Can you believe that? Friends and family are CONSTANTLY requesting it from me without knowing that this cake isn't cheap to make! But their happiness is what matters most.

I did follow the recipe as written.  I also thought it made a lot of batter but I think it's supposed to be a high cheesecake.  It had 4 fairly deep cracks and the top was browned in spots. I had 3 homemade cheese cake toppings to serve with this cake and wanted to present it to my guests for Easter.  It did not look nice at all so I opted to pre slice and serve individual portions alongside the toppings.  Bottom line:  tastes good; did not look good.  My bad luck I suppose.

I have tried this recipe numerous times. Have it bookmarked and on every kindle. It is "the Best" cheesecake around. I like to add melted white chocolate or a raspberry preserves, I change up the crust to an Oreo crust, but it still works and tastes great. Love, Love, Love it.

When i read this recipe i was thinking to myself that it seems to make quite a bit. I should have followed my instinct, it makes WAY too much! plus the crust was awful. Definitely too much crackers to butter. the batter tastes good so hoping that my 2 cakes that are in the oven come out ok, but i am angry to have wasted so much ingredients. the batter made two cakes, plus i dumped out about 1/3 of it leftover.

Omg! This is the best cheesecake ever and so easy to make, I have tried New York cheesecake before and personally I do not like the sampler they have to sell very mushy. I have made Chantal's cheesecake going on 5 times now and all my friends and family love it thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe! Thank you. I didn't change anything for my first go at it and mine did crack BIG TIME but I have 9 kids running around and banging on the oven coming in and out of the side door leading to the garage so that could have an impact.

My wife and I have been making this recipe for a number of years now and love it to death. We did make a little change in the recipe though. We cut the sugar almost in half. The way it's laid out now is just too much sugar and it leaves a nasty, sugary after taste. We do ours measurements in metrics. I think the original recipe called for 200g of sugar and we dropped it down to about 130g. This is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that, it's fantastic!!

This is the only cheesecake recipe I've used, and I've made it twice as of last night. It's very good, but there is one issue: the middle of the filling doesn't cook properly. It cooks enough to hold its structure, but it has a very buttery/creamy texture rather than the classic tacky texture the outer filling correctly achieves. I tried cooking it 15 minutes longer or so this time, but it didn't help. Aside from that, I did follow the recipe exactly both times. I'm not pro enough to know why this happens, but I've read that a cheesecake shouldn't crack unless the internal temperature gets too high. However, this pie cracked both times for me AND the middle is undercooked. So maybe there is a fundamental problem with the ingredients here, such as too much liquid? Even so, it's a very delicious cake. I don't think anyone would dislike the creamy texture if it comes out this way for you!

If your cake does crack, I suggest topping it with a 1 c. sour cream + 1/3 c. powdered sugar topping. Tastes good and hides the crack!

Ok, I made this cheesecake again only weeks after the first attempt.  This time I used a waterbath and added strawberry swirl inside and I think it was the best thing since sliced bread.  LOL  The receipe was very easy and I was even happier than the first time.  It's a winner!

It was very good!  The crust seems to be not enough even after I up the measurement by half.  I will probably double it the next time for the crust.  My middle cracked not sure why, but I was able to cover it with some home made whipped cream and fresh strawberries and blueberries.  It looked good and tasted good, so I am happy with the result:).

This is my first time ever making cheese cake. I followed the tutorial included.  My family(extended included) is used to buying our cheese cakes from the cheese cake factory.  We all loved it.  Both my in-laws and parents want me to make it again. 
Creamy, fluffy, delicious all describe this cake.
* Made this dozens of times over the years now and I am still in love with this recipe.

Great recipe! Although mine always cracks... I just cover it up with a cherry filling or something else. Love it! :)

It was okay! I used 4 tbsp of butter instead of 2 in the crust but it really needs more flavor in the crust. Overall it was okay but I'll keep searching for a better recipe.

This is absolutely wonderful!!  Everyone wanted a piece at the Super Bowl Party. I served with fresh berries.  Left overs if any are yummy.  Suggestion_  DO NOT OVER WHIP ingrediants.  It might crack still wonderful!

I halved the recipe so I baked at 330 for an hour and let sit in the oven for 4. It still cracked but I covered it with a berry compote so that didn't matter. Tasted awesome! I did reduce the amount of egg based on previous reviews.

Made this one twice. First time over beat and overcooked (cracked and browned too much ) but still delicious. The second time following the baking instructions to the "T" and use a water bath. Added a bit of nutmeg, cinnamon etc to the crust.....Absolutely the best. This is the real deal when it comes to cheesecake recipes.

For the first cheesecake I ever made it ended up awesome! I made it mango flavor, with real mangoes, on my dad's birthday. A bit of a mistake. It cooked well in the water bath and really was all cooked after a little more than an hour, but because of the rush I left it in the oven for only three hours afterwards and in the fridge for thirty minutes. We just wanted to eat it on his birthday. Putting it in the fridge that quickly didn't cause it to crack or anything, but the middle was soft and my mom thought it was undercooked. It was fine, but for it to get that cheesecake consistency we put the leftovers in the fridge and overnight it became perfect. Great recipe, you don't need to follow the ingredients to a T, but the water bath and the time is important to get right.

I brought this to a work holiday party and everyone was raving about it. Pretty easy to make. I added more butter to my graham cracker crumbs because I thought it was too dry. Came out very tasty!

In less than two months, I made it twice. The taste was phenomennal!
Everybody loved it and everyone begged for more (that is why I made it the second time!).
Followed some suggestions:1> grease the side of the pan 2> use a water bath and 3> keep the oven door closed until the oven 100% cool (6,7, 8... hours, whatever it is requires) and 4> chill in the fridge over night. 
I am making it again for a party!
Thanks for this easy and fabulous recipe!

GOOD! i used milk + lemon juice instead of sour cream, because I was out of sour cream, and changed the crust, but besides that stuck to the recipe. I didn't leave them in the oven, either. took them out and into the fridge. no cracks. wonderful flavor. the perfect cheesecake. will use this recipe over and over again.

Amazing cake! Only problem is that whenever I make it - I can't stop eating it.
2 tips for baking a cheesecake:
1. place a bowl of water at the bottom of the oven.
2. wrap baking pan in very wet newspaper or paper towels.
It's absolutely worth the extra 2 minutes work.

This recipe was ABSOLUTLEY FANTASTIC! We've tried several others but this one is by far the best. I will have to say though, we used 1/4 cup of butter for the crust. YUUMMMM!

MY cake was a little overcooked, therefore dried and too dense. The flavor was ok, the cream cheese taste was a little too overwhelming. If I make this again I will reduce the amount of cream cheese. But I'm not sure I'll make this again.

Growing up I have always loved Cheesecake. Well now after making about a dozen. I have it down to a T. This recipe is so simple and easy. Anyone can do it. Just remember to put your cheesecake in a bath so it wont crack. Everyone loves my cheesecake and this pass Christmas I even tried a vanilla wafer crust instead of the traditional graham and it was the BOMB.COM! Thank You Chantal!

This was the first and only cheesecake recipe that I have tried and I absolutely love it. I added some fresh strawberries as a topping and everyone loved it. I have made this cheesecake twice and each time it was a hit. The only thing I need to figure out is how to keep the cake from cracking. I left it in the oven for 6 hours untouched each time and it still cracked during the baking process. I just slice it prior to serving it for appearance sake but the taste outweighs the appearance!!!!

Hands down the best cheesecake ever. Everyone loved it on Christmas Eve. I used the reduced fat cream cheese and lite sour cream and it was amazing. I will use this recipe over and over.

This was a fantastic recipe.The only comment is that be sure you blend your cream cheese very well or you may have pieces of plain cream cheese throughout.I enhanced mine by making a strained raspberry and sugar reduction and swirled it in after pouring into the pan. Turned out superb and silky.YUM!

I used this crust recipe from another reviewer...it was delicious:  1 1 /2 c. graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/4 c. finely chopped Unsalted nuts (walnuts, pecans), 1/4 c. melted butter, 1 tsp. cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg
I think I kept everything the same & added cherry pie filling.  It was perfect!!  I followed the baking temp & directions, left in the oven for 5-6 hours, and wrapped in Saran Wrap & let sit in fridge about 18 hours.  Sooo worth the wait!

I just tried this recipe for the holidays and it was a big hit! I only used 3 eggs and reduced the recipe accordingly. Also reduced the sugar as I used a blueberry sauce on top and figured it was plenty sweet!

This was so yummy!! DH really liked it too!  He went out of his way to say he liked it.  Substituted Nilla Wafers for graham crackers because of personal taste. The other thing different is I doubled the amount of vanilla (I do this in everything) and added the zest of an orange to give a little depth of flavor.  After eating this on Christmas Eve, we couldn't wait to have more on Christmas night.

I was so excited to make this after seeing how many reviews it had.  Unfortunately,  I was very disappointed after it was all done.  It tasted so good before I baked it.  But once it was done baking, I opened my oven to see a dark brown cheesecake!  This was suppose to be Christmas dessert but I'm too embarrassed to serve it!  Don't know what went wrong, so not sure I'll make it again.  :-(

This is amazing... made just as is. no water bath...not needed as some might suggest. Perfectly delicious. No cracks, lovely color and texture. People who were complaining about it being brown must have wrong oven temps or mine is wrong! Just heavenly to eat. Smooth and creamy. would give it 10 stars if I could. The only thing I did differently was add more butter to the crust. I used 15 rectangles of graham crackers and not squares.. it needed more butter to hold it together...YUMMY!

This was by far the creamiest, best cheesecake I have ever eaten. However it did crack. Followed the directions carefully and it cracked. But I covered it with chocolate ganache and no one knew. Fabulous!

I made the recipe as is, and it turned out just perfect. My oven was a little hot so the top and sides turned dark brown, I had to turn off the oven at 45 minutes. But the taste is relatively light but moist. I topped it with fresh strawberries and raspberry hello over. Everyone loved it. It yielded a huge cake but it's almost gone!

Right. I really dislike cheesecakes due to an experience I had back in primary school, that one tasted sour and nasty but I actually enjoyed this one that I made. I have no idea what graham crackers look like (seriously I don't) so I subbed with Oreos. This cheesecake recipe makes a very moist, my father called it wet, cheesecake. Tasted amazing no lie but very very moist. So if your looking for a creamy close to cakey cheesecake you will need to add more flour than just a 1/4 cup. Perhaps a 1/2 or 3/4 cup. I also added some zest from a lime to give it a kick and loaded it with essence lol. But if you do like very moist cheesecakes this is your keeper! Oh and yea all those hours you see there, that they give. You don't need em. I left mines in the oven after it baked for 3 hrs and chilled it for however long I wanted. Overall I was very happy with this recipe seeing as how it was my first time and all making one!

This was my first ever "baked" Cheesecake.  Before making this I read a lot of the reviews.  I told my husband that I wasn't sure what to do.  Water bath, no water bath; plain crust, add nuts, etc... etc..
In the end, I made the recipe exactly as written originally.  To my surprise, it was awesome!  Yes, it cracked. Hmmm, I wasn't in a contest and I used cherries to top it with, so no one knew.  Husband said it was one of the best ever Cheesecakes he's ever had.  We had it for his Birthday and our guests also loved it.  No leftovers so it looks like I'll have to make another one.  I can see how this recipe is easily adaptable to any taste.  Next one will have an oreo cookie crust....just cuz I believe oreos are one of the 5 basic food groups.  LOL Thanks for the recipe!!!  Its a keeper in my book.

Don't ever really leave reviews but this one deserves it. Best cheesecake I have ever had, hands down. Made a few changes. Lowered the graham crackers to 8, doubled the melted butter to 4 tbs. Added 1 tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the crust. Changed the milk to heavy cream. Lowered the flour to 1/8 cup. Let all the cold ingredients get to room temperature before making. Filled a cake 9x13 pan with boiling water and put it on the rack below the cheesecake. Baked the cheesecake for an hour & 15 mins at 325. Let cool in oven for 2 hours after baking. Then put the cheesecake in the fridge for another 4 hours. I did have cracking but I didn't really care because I covered it with a turtle style topping which hid the imperfections and I let it cool in the fridge for another 2 hours. It is extremely dense but that is what makes a good cheesecake. I've had cheesecake from many many many places and I would rate this the very best one with the modifications made.  Though it was extremely time consuming, I will be making it again.

I thoroughly enjoyed making this recipe and eating the product it produced after. I set out to make this cake for a co-workers birthday and was nervous to do so because this was my first cheesecake. Between the recipe and all the helpful comments, I felt confident in making this cheesecake and I'm pleased that I did. I decided to make up some salted caramel to top the cake which was a great fit. The little salt really helped cut through some the richness of the cake.

NOTES:
• My cake split but that's my fault for being to curious. You know what they say "Curiosity kills the cake!"
• Use a heavy oil or grease for the pan
• Increase the butter for the crust to 3 tbs. to help give a more moist crust.

Easy and delicious. Add whatever flavor you want for variation. Use any type of crust. I used oreo crust. Delicious. If I managed this anyone can. Do be careful not to over beat or cool too quickly. That is beyond important.

This was my first time making a cheesecake so I looked for a simple recipe.  I used cinnamon graham crackers for the crust and it was nice.  The spring form pan I purchased was not metal, it was silicone, so the baking time was a little off.  I followed the cooking times and temps and it was still undercooked.  I added on an additional 15 minutes and that did the trick.  The flavor was pretty good but I was hoping it had more cream cheese flavor.  Is this due to adding the vanilla?  If I leave out the vanilla, will it have a stronger cream cheese taste?

This is the most outstanding, lifetime best cheesecake recipe, and it can be done by a first timer!  It was just on the verge of liquid in the middle.  That's perfect for me, but you can increase baking time 5 - 10 mins if you like it a little more done.  I used about 80% of the graham crackers and double the butter.  (I like wetter crust better than dry).  Combined this with a Jelled Rasberry Topping with frozen berries and rasberry jello, lifetime best topping.  Of course, fresh whipped cream topped it.

Everyone who ate this cheesecake enjoyed it. I did a few things ddifferently though. I didn't use a springform pan because i don't have one. So I used a regular nine inch cake pan andused a spatula to help me gt out the cake with the crust intact. I poured a little water onto the ovens baking tray as I didn't have a separate tray. I used an oreo crust and added about 2 tbls of the oreocrem in the batter itself.I also forgot that I hadn't measured out the greek yougurt, whih I used instead of sourcream, so I added mybe about. 1 1/2 cups of that. Still, I didn't have any cracks. I baked it for anextra fifteen minutes, left it in the oven for about 20 minutes, them left it to cool on a rack for about 3 hours. Then i put it in the  fridge overnight. The middle was a bit soft so I put it inthe freezer and served it frozen. It was still great. Served with whipping cream and. cherries

Tastes fantastic, texture is perfect, and surprisingly easy to make! Mine still cracked on the top though, even though I left it it in the oven, as the recipe recommends.

Awesome and great with a variety of fruit toppings!  Only downfall - it tends to crack.  Still a keeper!

This was my first time making a cheesecake so I took everyone's suggestions on how to make it.  I didn't do a water bath since I've never done that before but I did leave it in the oven to cool for 6 hours.  It was PERFECT!  Thanks!

I agree with Rollin. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it still cracked. A lot. It tasted more like eggs than cream cheese and the texture just wasn't right. It's not like the cheesecake I've tasted. It still tasted good but not like cheesecake. It also burnt the edges a lot until it was brown.

Never made a homemade cheesecake before, beside the jell-o no bake cheesecake. I made almost 4 cheesecakes on this one receipe...because it was a lot and the pans I used were a little small than the normal size. This turned out great. Thank you!!!

I made this yesterday, and it was devoured today! I was a little nervous after reading all the reviews and suggestions. It seemed to become much more complicated than I needed. Anyway, I followed the original directions. I did not have a pan for the water bath so I just put a roasting pan on the shelf below filled with water.
I made the strawberry topping from this site suggested by others. 
This worked perfectly and the cheesecake was a big hit - I will make this again. Bottom Line the original directions work perfectly!

Best cheesecake recipe around. I've been making this one for 2 years now and it was perfect from the first try. I've since used it as the base for all kinds of variations like pumpkin and egg nog and every time it is amazing.

I made this recipe of cheesecake for my friends birthday party one year, and had it in the fridge to wait till I left. When I went to check on it, it was completely eaten. My brother ate the whole thing within 1 day and its a lot of cheese cake. Now that I live seperately from him, everytime I visit he demands that I make this. I have never had it turn out bad and it is always really creamy and perfect! I cannot say enough about how delicious this is. Everyone who has ever tried it had to come back for thirds(I give small portions) and say it is the best cheese cake they have ever had!

This recipe is perfection. I made it for an early Thanksgiving dinner, because not everyone likes pecan and pumpkin pies. It was a huge hit! The reviewers who suggest not over-beating and just leaving the cheesecake undisturbed, to cool in the over are correct.

Only my 2nd time making a baked cheesecake and I am so relieved that it turned out great! I used this recipe as a plain base to add other flavours. I put chunks of Snickers & Oreo's into the filling before baking it. I also replaced half the milk with Bailey's. 1 hour in the oven browned the top a little too much so I topped off the top of the cake with a thin layer of chocolate glaze just to hide that. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and it looked store bought!

Best ever! It helps to learn the techniques recommended, but even if you are a novice, this is an excellent recipe as long as you follow directions exactly. Wilderness brand pie filling is a delicious way to hide any cracks if they occur!

I followed it step by step and the finished product was amazingly heavenly!!! It's the right sweetness for me and I'm a purist so I don't like adding anything to my cheesecake. This was also a hit during a family BBQ!

Great recipe as is.. I tried to remove the flour and vary a few other things but it was not as good as the original recipe.  If you want a NOT fluffy cheesecake, this is it.  Room temp ingredients and the water bath made it perfect. NO cracking. The tip someone left of using the oven bag to wrap the pan in the water bath was genius.

Absolutely perfect.  Not too sweet, which is great if you actually want to put a somewhat sweet topping on the cheesecake. I found letting it set overnight gave the best consistency (I like it nice and dense/thick/hard) and also allowed the crust to 'crustify' better.

I tried this last night and the cake was a hit when I took out this morning for everyone to have for dessert! Everyone loved it! Now, there are only 2 slices left! Oh  but before that, I'd like to share one thing. I baked this cake using water bath method. And it turned out perfect! Thank you :D

this is an amazing recipe. it was easy to follow, and it came out wonderfully. i followed a few of the tips so it wouldn't crack and it worked. I greased the sides of the pan so it wouldn't stick and crack. I also wrapped the pan with aluminum foil and placed the pan in a water bath with really hot water. then i just topped it with cherries. it was amazing!! :)

5 stars all the way!!! I made just the way the recipe said except I used the store bought, already made graham cracker pie crusts(2 big ones plus a pack of 6 miniature graham cracker crusts). I was able to fill all of them. I didn't leave sitting in the oven after baking, I let them cool for awhile on the table and then did a quick chill for the bigger pies in the freezer for about a half an hour. They had cracked some before they were done baking anyway and didn't crack more from taking them out. I'm thinking about making these again this weekend!

This was the second new york cheesecake I have ever made. My first one, years ago was a disaster. I followed this recipe and all of the helpful device from the other reviewers.I put it in a water bath, baked it for an hour and let it sit in the oven for six hours before putting it in the fridge. I did have a few air bubbles on the surface, but that was my fault because the cream cheese wasn't exactly at room temp. I got a little impatient, but it was delicious!! Thank you for the recipe!Now I have to experiment with this and different variations like pumpkin and sweet potato.

Fantastic recipe. Not for the feint of heart as the flavor is very rich. If you love classic, strong, heavy cheesecake -- this is it! Don't forget your water baths!

Good recipe but formed a eggy layer on the top. you can leave it on or take it off it's good both ways.

Note: I didn't use an electric mixer so it didn't look nice but it still tasted good. if your making it for a birthday party you should use a electric mixer.

I thought this turned out beautifully. I used a water bath, and also left it in the oven for 6 hours/overnight. Very pretty. The only thing I did wrong was to not add some sugar to the crumb crust. Seems very plain.  Do graham crackers have more sugar than just the graham cracker crumbs you can buy at the store? Next time I'll add sugar and bake the crust a bit for it to set before adding batter.

This is my go-to cheesecake recipe. It always comes out divine. I still haven't been able to conquer the "cracked top" problem that a lot of people have with cheesecakes, but that's a technique problem on my part, not the recipe. My mother can do it, but it still eludes me.

I made this exactly as described, except for the crust: I used ~1 1/2 cups of crushed graham crackers, 4 T butter, some cinnamon & sugar.

The reviews were AWESOME!! This tasted just like the cheesecake you buy for lotsa $$. My daughter wanted a cheesecake for her birthday and this was a huge hit. We gave a couple pieces to the neighbors and they said I was the "cheesecake queen".

Wonderful recipe used as is. I may try experimenting with pumpkin, etc. in the future, just for fun.

Is there a way to add strawberries or strawberry topping to the actual cheesecake before baking or will this ruin it?  I like the strawberries on the inside and top. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!

I followed the directions except the crust. I did other people's suggestions of adding nutmeg and cinnamon and that was my favorite part. My family loved the crust. The cheesecake itself was ok. Not really special. I followed all the directions, had no cracks. It was a bit too sweet and I am a complete sweets lover.

My 1st attempt to make a cheesecake, I used this recipe. I have made this twice and haven't gotten to taste either one. But the recipients assure me it's delicious. Sadly, both have cracked. I must be beating the cream cheese too much. next time I may try no mixer, just wooden spoon.

This recipe is very well written and easy to follow. I should have done as others suggested and used a water bath - mine cracked after the first hour...so I took it out of the oven and refrigerated it. It doesn't matter much that it cracked, but the next time I make this, I will use a water bath. I will also let the cream cheese come to room temp before mixing - stuck on the sides of the bowl of my mixer and the batter was a bit lumpy. I am a graduate of culinary school, I should know better! I guess I was just in a hurry :) Thank you for the great recipe.

My first time making cheesecake, and I was blithely unaware of the resulting size -- 5 pound cheesecake?? I had bought two ready-made crappy graham-cracker crusts and, after filling them to overflowing, had plenty left over. But they set beautifully. I sprinkled nutmeg and cinnamon into the crust and they weren't too sweet. Success.

The best cheesecake I have ever had. Dense, thick and out of this would. Key I think is to let it stay in oven for the alloted amount of time other than mixing everything by hand. NO MIXER!

This recipe was great. I had to add a little extra asi had a 10 inch pan and not a 9 inch. It was my first time making a cheesecake and it was for my husband's birthday. He declared it was perfect.

Made this cheesecake today.  It was GREAT.  I ended up with cracks but who cares. It tastes great & the easiest ever.  The only torture was waiting soooo long.  We topped it with the caramel sauce from this site (the one that only has sweetened condensed milk as the ingredient - boiled) and well all I can say is that my husband & I are going to have a second piece for dinner.  If you mess this recipe up - then you just need to stay out of the kitchen.  This recipe will be hanging on my fridge as something I make on a regular basis.

amazing cheesecake!!! made it for a family gathering and ppl kept asking me where i bought it from. when i told them i made it myeslf, they cudn't believe it!! i used 3 packs of cream cheese instead of 4 and reduced 1/4 of the rest of the ingredients as i only have a 7" springform pan. i still had extra filling left so i made a smaller cake. it came out with a golden top with NO cracks!! i followed  other reviews' suggestions & left the cake in the oven for at least 3 hrs before taking it out. i also used a water bath so i guess that helped too.

I tried this recipe for the first time on the 4th of July and everyone absolutely loved it! It was so heavenly and thick. I did have to add use more graham crackers than the recipe called for, but other than that amazing recipe! I will definitely be using this in the near future.:)

I made this as the cutting cake for my friend's wedding. One recipe makes two 6" springforms, so you could half it for one. To make it gluten free I omitted the flour, and also the milk (upon another's suggestion), and instead doubled the amount of sour cream and made with 5 packs cream cheese. I made the gluten free tart crust from elanaspantry.com but forgot to pre-bake it (will do next time). The crust came out soggy but I could ignore that because the cheesecake was amazing, and the most classically tasty and rich cheesecake I have ever made.

Delicious cheesecake! Beyond my expectations. This is the first cheesecake I have ever made, and it was easy and fun to make. The top may crack or may not, mine cracked a great deal, but there are many ways to hide the cracking. I will definitely be making this recipe New York Cheesecake again- I greatly recommend!

it turned out to be a very good cheese cake, only problem was the cook time was way too long. and keeping it in the oven did not work for me. i turned the heat off 15 minutes before the time and kept it in the oven for about an hour before i looked at it and the entire outside was burnt. i also ended up with a replica of the grand canyon. but the center was good. learn from your mistakes i guess....

I have made this cheesecake more times that I want to! No lie this is the best cheesecake I have ever made, problem is all my friends want me to make them for them they even get all the ingredients when they want me to make this for them lol. The only thing I changed is I make sure i grease the side of the pan before i put the crust in, then i wrap the bottom of my springform pan with foil and then put it in a oven bag with a twist tie I don't water bath anymore. Then I put the mixture in put it in the oven. Not opening the oven is the best secret to a no crack cake...see the other reviews it's soooo true. I make these early in the morning or the day before. You won't be disappointed.

My first cheesecake ever, and following this recipe, it turned out perfectly!!  I made this for a big Father's Day gathering and everyone thought it was the best cheesecake they ever had. (Even though they were family, I don't think they were just being nice, either.) I will make this fabulous recipe many more times.

I have been cooking/baking for 30 years and this was the most disappointing recipe I have tried on allrecipes. com  The cheesecake burned and fell apart.  I think I will try Ina Garten's recipe next

I made this cheesecake and baked it with the method of placing the springform pan in a pan of hot water.  My husband said it was the best cheesecake he has ever had.  It is my now favorite recipe to use.

Amazing! My fiance loves this cheesecake so much, it is delicious. So much better than store bought. We even like it better than what the local restaurants have to offer. Mine did crack, because I probably did over beat it and didn't let it cool in the oven.

Delicious, my cheesecake cracked but I am sure it is something that I did. I was unsure about adding the milk and flour but I believe it adds to the great consistency.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is missing something; I don't know what it it.  The Cheesecake itself looks wonderful and my guests loved how it looked(after I covered the crack with cherry pie filling).  Overall, great cheesecake. Thanks for sharing.

Easy enough to make but doesn't have the "density" I was hoping for.  With the eggs it looks and tastes more like custard. The search continues...

One of the best cheesecakes I have ever had. Came out perfect each time and I used reduced fat cream cheese for 3/4 of the cheese and substituted egg beaters for one  of the eggs and used reduced fat sourcream. It still tasted decadent and creamy.

Wonderful recipe! I made it for the first time to take to a family gathering, and had actually made 2 of them. As I was leaving they surrounded me for the leftovers... First time making cheese cake & this was the easiest to follow.

This is such a great recipe, but I did a few things differently. 

First, this makes a massive amount of cheesecake filling and it make my cheesecake too thick. So I scaled the directions down to 3/4 of the amount. (You can do this by typing in 9 where the 12 is under servings, and hitting calculate) 
Next I found the crust to be a bit soggy so i added a tablespoon of eggwhite to the crust ingredients and mixed it thoroughly with my hands. I pressed this mixture into my springform pan and baked it for about 10 minutes. Then I let it cool completely before putting the cheesecake filling it.

Turns out perfect every time.

Needs more sugar.  2 C works great!!  Other than that we love it.  I've been bumping the sugar each time and we've settled on 2.

Yikes! I am not sure what went wrong here... My mother recommended this recipe to me. I have tasted the cheesecake she has made, and it is beautiful and yummy... Mine somehow didn't turn out. I made certain to follow the recipe just as it says to. I was very careful not to over beat the batter. When I poured the batter into my 9 in. spring form pan, I noticed that it looked a bit full. I didn't think much of it though since cheesecake is very dense. I didn't expect it to rise much. The batter was about once inch from the top of the pan. I put it in the oven at 350 as specified. About half an hour in, I looked through my oven window to see that it had risen about an inch above the top of my pan... I was concerned, but I know that they shrink when they cool, so again, I let it ride. When 20 minutes remained on the clock, I peeked in the window again. Now the cake was about two inches above the top of the pan and the edges looked quite burned. No cracks at all, but it wasn't very attractive at all. It is now cooling in the oven. It has been in there for about 30 minutes since turning the oven off. The situation hasn't improved much. The only thing I can think of is that my spring form pan is a dark coated pan. Perhaps the oven temp should be reduced some for this? The recipe didn't specify, so I'm not sure. Hopefully it tastes better than it looks. I know the recipe can turn out well since my mom has made it. I will check with her to see what variables may have been different.

Although I had recently gotten into baking and this was the first cheesecake I have ever made I LOVED IT and probably wont be making any other :D My family loves it as well; every get together they request it.The first time I made it I left it in the oven over night but it cracked; the following times I did as the recipe states and left it in the oven overnight again and I also baked it with a pan full of water  on the rack under to keep it moist (suggestion from a friend). It hasnt cracked since so decorating is way easier :D I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAKE TO EVERYONE!

Tips:
Check the size of your eggs, google egg conversions.
Use heavy duty aluminum foil, 1 or 2 layers around your pan.
Buy an oven thermometer!
To remove cheesecake without parchment or wax paper on bottom, simple take off the sides, heat the bottom on a burner for a few seconds, slide a big spatula underneath and move . . . helps to have to receiving dish right there or you may have a multi-part cheesecake.

My fiance and coworkers loved this recipe! They said that it was sweet, but not too sweet (which some cheesecakes are), and that it had a light and fluffy texture instead of the really thick textures that (to me) mean too much cream cheese.

Ah, to find the correct word is almost impossible. The magnificence of this recipe is practically inscrutable in mere words! I changed nothing! I agree with others to let the cheesecake cool down in the oven. In fact, one NEEDS to let it cool down. Perfect food requires time to spread and absorb. In the meantime, wallow in the atmosphere this cake exudes. I let it refrigerate over night with a chocolate ganache coating, and it is the greatest thing I have ever made! The taste is delicate, yet also invigorating! It's not an invasive taste; rather, I'd say, it's that sort of taste that can just stay with you for the night, as every single bite makes your heart jolt with delight! Magnifico!

Love it! First time I made it. I made a mistake. I thought I had turned the oven completely off. I didnt... I burnt it.  My boyfriend still ate it though. This time I made sure the oven was off except my oven does take about 30 to 40 minutes to cool down so I turned it off 20 minutes before it was done and left it In the oven to sit over night. And i was successful! It really is the perfect cheesecak!!(: thank you so much for the recipe!

I made this cake over the weekend and haven't tasted it yet. After all the aggravation I hope it tastes good There were way too many crumbs for the amount of butter and the crumbs filled the pan too much. There was enough batter for 2 cakes! I couldn't believe how much was left over. The recipe should read that it makes 2 cakes. I wish I knew that before tossing out all the extra crumbs!

Excellent, easy recipe. For some reason, I ended up with too much batter. So, next time I will pack some graham cracker crumbs into a pie plate and use the excess in there. Mine cracked, but probably bc I left it in the oven for more than 6 hours. It was still delicious and loved by all.

Just finished baking this beautiful cheesecake.  It turned out awesome. I followed the recipe to the exact letter and add a casserole dish of water.  Easiest cheese cake recipe I have ever made.  If you read the other reviews I would highly suggest that you follow.  Enjoy

Hubby loves cheesecake. Followed directions to a "T" and hubby did not care for this at all. It was dry and really had no taste to it at all.  I thought with the "Tablespoon of vanilla" it would have a great vanilla taste but it was definitely not there for us. Will use other cheesecake receips I have used in the past

This recipes was so good and creamy.  My kids loved it, too.  I did spice up the crust with some cinnamon and nutmeg like one review suggested.  I had one daughter that loved it that way, and one that preferred it plan.  It made a lot more batter than would fit in my 9" pan though.

Absolutely delicious, classic recipe. Turns out great made with half Neufchatal cream cheese. We eat it plain or topped with canned pie filling (cherry or berry) or homemade fudge sauce. Mine comes out with a huge crack even after following directions, but no matter -- I've made it twice and the flavor and texture are incredible; everyone loves it.

This cheesecake was a HUGE hit last Christmas!! I went to make it again, and when I bought the ingredients, I forgot to carry the recipe with me. DOH! Of course, I bought the wrong amount of cream cheese (I got 2 pkgs, instead of the 4) - but sometimes good things come from bad goofs, right? I did have some goat cheese in the fridge, so I used 16 oz. of cream cheese, and made up the rest of the 16 oz. with goat cheese. Not that this recipe needs any substitutes to make it any more incredible than it already is, but the final result turned out fabulous, too!

Worth every penny/effort. Update: Some say to avoid getting a crack in the cheesecake by leaving the cheesecake in the oven after turning off the oven. BE CAREFUL. This has cheese in it and should be refrigerated. Cheese should stay out no longer than 2 hours.

Really good recipe. I crushed the graham crackers by putting them into a ziplock bag and using a rolling pin. I think maybe doubling the butter in the crust would help, as the crust doesn't stick together too well, but it does already taste good so who knows. I skipped the sour cream, because I think that's gross :) Also, I put a pan of water on the bottom of the oven, to help stop cracking. The full hour was too much for mine, I got a browned top, but otherwise excellent result.

simply amazing! I was scared to try it at first because it was only my third time making a cheesecake but this recipe did not fail me! Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe! I added more butter to the crust though because I found that 2 tbsps would make it too dry and crumbly. Still turned out great!

I'm an international student and I never wrote any reviews due to my limited English ability. But I just have to say this time...This recipe is awesome!!! It was my first time to make a cheesecake. And it turned out perfect! My boyfriend couldnt believe I made it.( he works for the cheesecake factory and he is pretty picky about cheesecakes ;P ) I put a little less flour to make it creamier. I greased the side of the pan and did waterbath. No cracking at all. The only problem was the crust. I doubled the butter as some reviewers said. But the crust turned out too soft. I think it's better when it's crunchy. I will just follow the original recipe next time. The best recipe I've ever used! I love it!!

Wonderful cake - made it for the first time and everyone seemed to love it - Thumbs up.

I made a bain marie by cooking the cake on the rack and placing a pan full of water below - the cake did not crack.

My cheesecake still cracked even though I followed what other people said and did not overbeat and left it in the oven (turned off) for several hours, so I must have done something wrong, but the taste was amazing, everyone loved it. Thanks!

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times and it has been amazing each and every time. compliments galore! If your final product is not the greatest perhaps it's not the recipe that is troubled.
This recipe rocks!

My batter was lumpy and was not even. It turned out too egg-y and did not taste good. The color was also much browner than in the picture, and it was still lumpy! :(

This was amazing! the first time I made it, it was for my friend's birthday. Then i made it for another friend's wedding. I used Hy-Top brand cream cheese the first time and it was delicious but hard to smooth because it was very hard, until I put in the eggs. Then it was fine. It cracked when i baked it, but was fine, and tasted fantastic! The second time I used Philadelphia brand cream cheese and it was much easier to mix. But it bubbled on the 9 inch one that I made, and the mini 4 inch ones that I made cracked, and sunk badly after baking. Also it tasted watery and off. I will go with the Hy-Top from now on.

This recipe is very good. My whole family loved it!  My only issue was that the cake got too dark about 2 inches in from the edge. When I make this again I will reduce oven temp and possibly bake longer. Also I did exactly as instructed by just turning oven off and letting it cool in oven but I also got pretty good cracking. Next time will use a water bath. Graham cracker crust was too much...I will reduce amound of Graham crackers and possibly add a touch of sugar and more melted butter.  Overall it was excellent! So hard to wait until the next day so we had some that night and the next day...it was so much better the next day. Texture was creamier.

I am not a cook but I looked like a professional when I showed up with this cheesecake.  I tried the water bath and still mine cracked.  No worries though because when I cut it, you couldn't tell.  :)  This makes a ton of cheesecake so make sure you have a good sized group to share it with or you'll have it for awhile!

I followed this recipe exactly as written!!!  It looked just perfect at the end of the hour but then... I shut off the oven and left the door closed.  You should have seen it 5 hours later...brown, with a huge star shaped crack on top!!!

When I saw how easy everybody said this was I had to do it for my first attempt  in forever at NY Cheesecake BUT my pans had been damaged in a recent move. So I put the filling (which I had mixed before checking on the pans) in reg 9' graham cracker crust. the 3 pies they made came out GREAT! I cooked them for 45mins and let them cool for an hour before puting in fridge.  They tasted great! I prefer the smaller pies and I think my "new taste scarey family" my eat these quicker thinking they are my old no bakes.

One of the best cheesecakes I've ever tasted and I made it. What?! Every time me or my husband make this, people rave about it. The first time my husband made it, he accidentally put almond extract instead of vanilla. It was really good! We've tried both and actually prefer it with the almond. The cake has come out with a crack every time except for once but it tastes so good it doesn't even matter. Thanks for this amazing recipe!!!

Simply awesome.  Follow the recipe exactly first time, next time I cut the recipe ingredients (except the crust) in half as I am a bachelor and did not need so much. Loved that ratio of crust/pie even better! Thank you so much for sharing this party pleaser!

This recipe did not work for me. I followed recipe instructions exactly but only to have it cracked like a volcano eruption and the texture came out too light and tasted more like a diet kind of cheesecake. very disappointed.

Really wonderful basic cheesecake.  I was cooking for a small group and didn't need such a large cake, so I reduced the serving size to 9 (in order to use just 3 blocks of cheese instead of 4).  I still baked it for the full hour, and it turned out pefectly.  I was only able to let it sit in the oven for around 2 hours, and it didn't crack.

This was DELISH!  Every mouthful was a delight.  Mine didn't crack, yeah!!  BUT the top browned, so next time I think I would reduce the temp and see if that helps.  This was fabulous though!

Used graham cracker crumbs and followed recipe on box for the crust (which included a little sugar that was a plus for taste).  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  The top cracked all over within an hour of turning off the oven.  The cheesecake, however, was great!  A friend had purchased a cheesecake from a local bakery and brought it for dessert, not knowing I had made one from scratch.  We had a tasting contest and mine won!  Won't say the name of the bakery, but it is very well known in our area.  The four star rating is only because the top cracked.  I'm sure I could have covered it with a cherry filling, etc., but wanted to see how good it tasted plain.

This is the best cheesecake ever!  I have never made a cheesecake before and wanted to make one for dessert for Christmas dinner.  This was so easy to make and came out beautifully!  I had no problems with the top cracking at all and the taste far exceeded any other cheesecake I've had.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic! I enjoy a more dense, thick cheescake & this fit the bill! I followed the recipe exactly, however, I took the cheesecake out of the oven after an hour and let it cool before putting in the fridge. Yes, it cracked, but who cares! All I did was frost the top with cool whip. yum!!!

Amazing, everyone raved about it this holiday. You read these reviews and wonder if they people are really telling the truth or you wonder if the person who posted the recipe rated the recipe over and over. However Chantal. This is an amazing better then bakery bought cheesecake

I made this for Christmas this year.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect!  I made a strawberry cream sauce to top it with and everyone is still raving about it.  A few people told me it was the best cheesecake they've ever tasted.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

I made all the sweets for our family gathering for Christmas, I made this cheesecake, I did everything, no over beating, I let all the ingredients come to room temp, I followed the recipe exactly, but it still had huge cracks. I put some Christmas eatables on top to cover all the deep cracks. My family loved it, I thought it was great as well, just wish I could make a cheesecake that looked pretty.

This cheesecake is delicious.  I do add a teaspoon of dried lemon rind and would advise to NOT use a graham cracker crust because of how long it has to cook )  I use a shortbread crust and it comes out perfectly!

I TRIED THIS RECIPE IN 2008. IT WAS GREAT. SO GREAT I MADE IT OVER AND OVER FOR A WHOLE YEAR, AND ATE IT ALL BY MYSELF. A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CHEESECAKES BEFORE HAND HELPED ME, LIKE ROOM TEMP INGREDIENTS, AND WATER CONTAINER IN THE OVEN, AND MINIMUM MIXING ONCE THE EGGS ARE IN, MAKES IT PERFECT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.  I DID HAVE TO STOP MAKING IT AS I WAS GAINING TOOOOO MUCH WEIGHT

This was absolutely delicious. I made little to no changes save for the amount of flour to this recipe. I love it SO much and I will definitely keep using this recipe (and this recipe ONLY) from now on :D Oh, and I used a waterbath.

Have made this a couple times, with success.  Followed the recipe exactly the first time, but no water bath -- I left it in the oven for hours, but it still had a crack.  No big deal, it tasted fantastic.   Second time around: I ran out of sour cream (only put in about 1/2 c), again no water bath (but I put a big casserole dish of boiling water on the lower rack, for steam), only left it in the oven to cool about 3 hours, and it turned out perfect, no cracks, great consistency!

Awesome cheesecake! I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving and got great compliments. I placed a pan w/ 1 in high water in the bottom rack and placed the cheesecake on the top rack while baking (as suggested by another reviewer). I made it overnight and did not take it out until the next morning. The edges were slightly browned but no cracks! Amazing!

I've made quite a few new york styles cheesecakes. This was the best by far. Perfectly sweet! I did use the water bath and left in the oven to cool for 7 hrs. Not one crack, it was perfect. I do highly recommend allowing all ingredients to cool to room temp. I can't wait to make it again!

This Thanksgiving I am thankful for.....THIS CHEESECAKE RECIPE!!!!!! I followed the directions with a few tweeks. Some people had suggested using only 2tbs. of flour, so I did. It came out very creamy indeed. I never made cheesecake before because everyone says it's sooo hard, but not with this recipe. I did cook it for an additional 10 minutes but only because my oven is not always reliable when it comes to holding it's temp. I left the cheesecake in the oven over night with a water bath like others suggested and i still cracked BUt WHO CARES! It was delicious!

I found this recipe and after reading the review I knew it was the one. I followed the recipe word for word and it came out beautiful. I did follow some of the tips from other reviews such as not over beating the mix but no water bath for me. I simply popped it in the oven and let it sit for 3 hours and then put it in the fridge!

Just finish baking this.  Came out perfect.  DO NOT overbeat.  Bake it for 60 mins, turn off oven and leave the oven door close for at least 2 hours.  No crack and tastes great!

I have not tasted it yet but it was extremely easy to prepare and cook.  I did put a pan of water under the cake I did not put the cake in the water.  I also omitted the flour just for personal taste.  I'm sure as long as I did everything correct the cake will taste wonderful.

Amazing cheesecake recipe!!  Didn't change a thing except that i did not let it cool in the oven for 5 hours.  I took it out after about 20 minutes, chilled in the fridge for a couple hours.  It did crack, I just swirled some carmel and hot fudge sundae topping on it, sprinkled with some pecans and the crack was hidden:)    Thank You Thank You!! This was the "perfect" recipe!!

I love this recipe... however anytime I make it for others they all comment on how "strong" it is.... I am a sweet lover and love it but I guess not everyone loves sweets as much as I do.

This was the first cheesecake I have attempted in 10 years. The first one was a disaster. This one was perfect! I read all the tips I could find and read reviews for a couple of hours before I started. I used the water bath with the foil, but water got in anyway. It was no big deal though. I baked at 325 based on other research I had done. I was very careful not to overmix after I added the eggs.  The cheesecake was delicious and beautiful, no cracks at all. Perfect!

SUPER EASY TO MAKE AND ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  this was my first time making a cheesecake and it turned out to be a HIT!  i made a little raspberry sauce to drizzle on top of it and it was extraordinary  people who mentioned cracking didnt let it cool down enough!  follow the directions (4-5 hour cooldown) and itll be great :)

I made it. It cracked. Probably my own fault. Good stuff. Different than most cheesecakes. I also made a strawberry sauce to go on top.

Received rave reviews from family and friends by using this recipe.  This was my first-ever effort at making a cheesecake, and I made no alterations to the recipe.  I did let it sit overnight in the oven and while a crack wasn't apparent when the baking time was over, there was a crack down the middle as it cooled.  No big problem though, as the taste and texture were perfect, and it's so easy to make!

Unbelievably good.  I even used a store-bought 6 in graham cracker pie crust - cooked for 45 mins - and it was still wonderful. I did have some cracking, but I think the smaller pie crust may have contributed to that.  Look forward to preparing this again with the 9 in springform pan and homemade crust soon.  I served it with Desertlovers Classic Caramel Sauce from this site and it was a great combo.

This turned out very well... I don't even like cheesecake but wanted to make something fancy for a gourmet event. I topped it with sliced strawberries and chocolate swirls. Many ladies wanted the receipe so I guess its good! (didn't eat it myself though...too fattening)

I've never made a cheesecake before, but I wanted to for my boyfriend's family because his brother's girlfriend kept making them yummy treats, so I wanted to catch up (I'm a very competitive person) I searched all over the internet, reading hundreds of reviews, and then I found this one, and every review was perfect. I made it and gave it to their family and low and behold, it was a huge hit. It has been months since then, and they still bring up how good it was. I will never buy a cheesecake again, because this one is the best! (I made a homemade zesty blueberry sauce for it, instead of just water to make the sauce, I used orange juice and a teeny teeny bit of lemon juice. I could eat this sauce alone!)

Excellent!  Although I increased my sour cream to a 16oz tub, which is the equicalent of 2 cups because I like my cheesecake a little more "tangy".  Anyhoo, it was perfect!  Not one crack!

Yummy and rich!  I added caramel extract instead of vanilla and it was delish.  Next time I'll try to jazz it up more.  This recipe is even easy for an amateur baker like myself!

I had never made a cheesecake before and my daughter wanted one for her 16th birthday. I was skeptical that I could do it but this recipe looked easy enough, even for me. Well, let me tell you...it was so good I would rate it among a real NY cheesecake...and having lived in NY for over 30 years, I was shocked at how good it was. I didn't leave it in the oven after it cooked (I had to make dinner) and I did notice some cracks form but I didn't care...I knew it was going to be covered with strawberries. I didn't use a bath either because I thought the water would leak into the springform pan and make it soggy. All in all a truly wonderful and easy recipe.   My family loved it and wants me to make it again for Christmas...and I will....with pleasure!

Got a couple of big cracks (even with a water bath) but this was easy and delicious!  I do recommend adding a tablespoon of sugar to the graham cracker and butter crust. I added mini-chocolate chips to the batter and my family loved it!

Followed recipe. It taste better the next day but still lacks something. It is not a true NY cheesecake. It is to fluffy not dense like a true NY cheesecake. I'm still searching. Disappointed with this one.

This recipe is perfect for a wonderful cheesecake.  I added a can of crushed pineapple; I drained the excess juice of the pineapple and mixed it into the batter before baking.  My version did not look perfect, as I am very new at baking cheesecakes, but it tasted absolutely amazing.  The texture was perfect: creamy, rich, and smooth.  This is perfect for a base cheesecake recipe, to which you can add other flavors.  Everyone loved it, myself included!

I made this cheesecake recently for a luncheon and it was a hit!  Delicious recipe, not too sweet and so creamy.  Served it with fresh strawberries.  Told it was better than cheesecake factory.  Will definitely make again. :)

I have made this cheesecake many times now.  It is great just as it is!  I am normally one to add strawberries or chocolate to the top of my cheesecakes but the one time I decided to add strawberries to my piece, I found myself pushing the strawberries to the side and eating it plain.  I have had to adjust cooking temp and time to suit my pan and oven.  I am cooking it at 325 for 50 mins to 1 hour.  Next time I think I will try 300 and see what happens.  NOTE:  Try as i might, I am an OVERBEATER. I just can't help myself. Just before the pan goes in the oven I firmly drop the pan on the counter several times to bring the air bubbles up to the surface. I pop them with a toothpick or fork and continue with this process until I see little or no bubbles.  It takes me 10-15 mins to do this. But ever since I started doing this to my cheesecakes, I have not had a single crack!

Best Cheesecake I have ever made. I did put a pan of water on bottom rack. I cooked 30 minutes at 375, then turned down to 250 and cooked for 90 minutes. Turned off oven and let sit for one hour. Put in frig. Served next day with strawberry perserves. PERFECT

This is AWESOME! Anyone can do this! However, it will take some time to go through this process. I made this for my mom, and she just grew wild for this cake. I'm going to make this again on a special occasion. Maybe even bake this for a friend. Yes, this New York Cheesecake is still a classic!

This was my first time making a cheesecake and, it cracked and turned out overcooked. Fortunately and remarkably, it was still good. I would suggest cooking it at 300°F so it doesn't crack. For the time, test it every twenty minutes until it is still fairly wobbly in the centre but still partially cooked. Then, turn off the oven and let it slowly cool until the centre is just slightly wobbly. At this point the cake is cooked properly. Next, let it cool at room temperature for a while (until is is touchable). Finally stick it into the refrigerator with a covering to retain the moisture. This should work.

BEAUTIFUL recipe! I have never made cheesecake before (I have always been kind of intimidated to try before now) This recipe really turned out fabulous. My cheesecake DID crack- despite following all the directions exactly, but it tasted so great that it did not matter. PERFECT texture. It did brown on the top but I like it like that.  I made some strawberry topping: Slice strawberries and put them in a saucepan with sugar-around a cup of sugar for a small container of strawberries. Put more in if you like them sweeter. Also add about a teaspoon of lemon juice. Cook just till it comes to a rolling boil and drain the liquid, separate strawberries, and put liquid back into the pan. Continue to cook JUST the liquid until it is thick. Once thickened, place the strawberries back into the pan and continue to cook them until they are the desired softness. YUMMY and very pretty!

I have used this recipe twice, and it came out great! the first time i used a normal cake pan and the second time I used the springform. I've read some bad reviews, and it makes me wonder what people are doing. I just follow the recipe (though I do add Irish Creme), and it works out great for me.

This was awesome! I followed the recipe very close with the exception of adding some sugar to the crust. My DH had told me several times that this is one te best cheesecakes he has ever had, very creamy. Mine did crack even with greasing the sides of my pan but who cares when it tastes this good. This will be my go to recipe.

this is a not only a great ny cheesecake recipe, but a great cheesecake base recipe as well.. you can substitute the sour cream for various ingredients to get a diferent flavor cheesecake.. ex: i used vanilla pudding and mashed banana's instead of the sour cream and nilla wafers in place of the graham crackers to create a banana pudding cheesecake.. (i also spread cool whip on the top and topped it off with nilla wafers and banana slices)

Yep, this really is a no-fail cheesecake recipe.  Very easy to make, and it tastes fantastic.  Only problem I had was with a soggy crust.  Other than that, it didn't last long in the fridge!

I really loved this cheesecake, however even after following the baking instructions it was not that "firm" in the middle. I was happy I ended up not bringing it to a dinner. After refrigerating 2 days it did firm more, but next time I will bake it longer. I am at sea level, so that should not have influenced the outcome.

By far, the best cheesecake recipe i have ever used. every time i make this it comes out PERFECT and everyone knows it's not an easy thing to get a perfect cheesecake. I followed all of the directions carefully, and baked in a water bath and didn't overbeat the batter.  I also use this as a base recipe for other kinds of cheesecake including marble, chocolate and strawberry. SO glad I found this recipe.

Yum! I wanted it to turn out perfect so I did bake mine in a water bath and it was beautiful! It was so good. At first I was totally intimidated by baking a cheesecake, but not anymore. If you follow CHUNG_BRENDA'S wonderful hints, it will turn out just perfect. I use the Strawberry Supreme Topping on this site for the topping and it was so good. Thank you!

This was my first time making a straight up plain New York Cheesecake, and it turned out wonderfully.  Even though I did follow the instructions about leaving it in the oven, the cake did crack a little in the middle.  No worries because I had already made a topping.  Cheesecake turned out creamy, but not soupy, and is definitely a new family favorite.

Mine baked up twice as tall as my springform pan, but settled back down after cooling. Mine cracked (probably because I didn't use the water bath), but since it was just for me and my husband, presentation didn't matter. Husband loved it!

No cracks!! Pre-heated oven to 350*. Put cake in and immediately turned oven down to 300*. Had pan of water on separate rack under cake because didn't have a pan big enough to fit my springform pan. Baked for 90 minutes, turned oven off, let sit all night. This morning I put the cake in the fridge and we will have it for dessert tonight. Ok, tasted it and it is delicious! Very not-sweet, which we like, though next time I think I'll add another 1/4 cup of sugar since we aren't having a sweet fruit topping on it.

This is a divine recipe!  I made this for my husband for Father's day and he was so excited! I didn't submerge the pan in water, simply took a glass baking dish, filled 3/4 with water and placed directly underneath the cheesecake.  Came out perfect!

This was my first 'real' cheesecake, and I am thrilled! Although it did crack (and I'm sure it was my fault as I had to place a pan of water underneath since I didn't have one big enough to put my springform pan in), the taste of this cheesecake is fantastic! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I have made many cheesecakes and this one has been the most successful one yet - especially the presentation.  Folks are always awed by the flawless result - looks like any you would get from a professional bakery and taste is great.  I tried a crust from food processed Stelladoro chocolate/almond biscotti (1 cup), 1 tbsp sugar and 5 TBS melted butter, pre-baked in 350º oven for 10 min to set and it was great.  The tips here also helped, room temp ingreds, and water bath (though risky for water leaking - really have to use 2 sheets of heavy duty foil and also used a oven cooking bag).  My 3rd time using this recipe with great success.  I don't see any reason to look for any other recipe if you like NY style cheesecake..

wow! this recipe is spectacular! i've been looking for the perfect recipe and this IS IT. the filling i followed exactly which turned out wonderful but i didn't use but 10 crackers (b/c my boyfriend doesn't like a thick crust), used a 10" pan, and still had leftovers of crust. i also added about 1 t of cinnamon and 3 T of sugar to the crust for preference. my waterbath leaked :'( so i cranked up the oven to 450 and put it back in on the bottom rack for about 5 mins and that helped a little. i also did a little "taste test" at room temp and was a little weary as i tend to like warm cheesecake and didn't much care for it but after overnight refrigeration i was hooked. very creamy and decadent. if yours doesn't come out perfect, it's gotta be a mistake on your end. i may add a little lemon zest next time, though. topped w/ fresh strawberries only makes it better (if that's even possible).

My family loved this. Make sure you follow the directions exactly. Has a whipped flavor, not dense at all. 1 hour in the oven is perfect. No cracking.

This was OK.  To me cheesecake should be decadent and rich, the flavor was a bit bland, especially towards the outside.  Maybe it was a bit overdone, but I wasn't too impressed. EDIT:  After chilling overnight, it was MUCH better.  Not mind blowing good, but still very delicious!

After 1 hour the middle looked so wiggly I was sure it would turn out sunken and raw.  But I turned off the oven and waited a few hours and it was perfect.  It tastes exactly like NY Cheesecake should.  It freezes well too.    I added sugar to the crust but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I followed the directions very carefully, but for some odd reason, this cake ROSE to about twice it's original height after being in the oven.  Very strange.  It was huge!  But also very delicious, with a nice texture.

I did not like the taste of this cheesecake .  I thought it called for too much vanilla.  All other recipes only call for 1 1/2  to 2 tsp. this recipe called for 1 tablespoon.  All I tasted was the vanilla not the cream cheese.

I had a pre-made graham cracker shell, so I made 1/2 the recipe. It came out great, but in doing it this way again, I will leave out 1 yolk and add a little more sour cream. The texture was great. I left it in the oven after cooking, only 1/2 the time.

I have made this at least 6 times and it always turns out...NOTE if you are getting cracks you need to make sure you grease the sides of the pan so it will not stick.  The only time I had a crack was when I forgot to grease the sides.

Also works great as a Marble Cheesecake....take out one cup of filling and mix with 1 block of melted unsweetened chocolate.  Makes for a great switch up and still turns out amazing!

It cracked!! 60 min at 350 was too long in my oven. The crust got a little too dark and I think that's why it cracked. I followed all recommendations to avoid cracking. Ingredients were at room temp, I avoided over -mixing and I greased the pan. I didn't do a water bath but I placed a pan of water in the oven. It was delicious though and I used frozen strawberries in syrup on top with Redi-Whip. Husband raved about it and he didn't care about the cracking. Next time I will try it for 50 min at 325. Once I get the bake time and temp worked out, it will be a perfect cheesecake. When my daughter comes to visit with her family, I will be the Gramma with the best cheesecake!

WOW! I just made this and it is the best! I did as others did - hand mixed, made a foil crust, put a water bath on the second shelf and then set it and forget it! I made it thru the hour cooking and then let it set (no peeking) for 2.5 hours, then chilled it over night. No cracks, smooth as could be, not too heavy, not too light - pure perfection! Will never buy or make another one!  Oh and this was my first time making a cheesecake..and I had no problems! LOVE LOVE LOVE!

First time I ever made it and used my familly as the taste testers on Easter. Every one loved it. I used a mixer and put it in a bath with foil around the spring form pan for around 50 minutes and let it sit in the oven for 6 hrs and then onto the fridge. I made a topping with blue berries and one lemon with sugar and topped it off....apparently my familly advised me i'll be making it more often!

Based on reviews, I guess I'm an idiot because this was not good. It was too dense and tasted like egg. Couldn't even taste the cream cheese. Thank goodness I made it 2 days before Easter and had my family test it or I'd have been mortified.

ok so i baked this cheesecake and so many others and still dont understand what im doing wrong.... it still cracks. i followed a reviewrs comments on how to not over do it, just mix the cream cheese and sugar with the machine and finish everything else by hand let it cook for 1 hour and do not open oven. It doesnt matter it still cracks. all i did was turn on the oven ligh and i could see it cracking while it cooked. so sad. but it tasted good. i covered it with strawberries so no one could see the cracks. oh i even covered cheesecakes in the past with foil i was told it prevents cracking, ha ha no it doesnt. good recipe though

Love it! If you put the cheesecake in a hot water bath while cooking, and don't overmix or overcook, your cake shouldn't crack. This recipe is amazing! Dense, perfect sweetness, easy to follow. Thanks!

This is a great cheesecake recipe:), the taste was superb however, i would suggest to either make 2 cheesecakes out of this recipe, because it resulted a very thick filling. and i would also suggest using water bath method or bain marie to cook the cheesecake:). and i mean putting the spring-form pan inside a larger pan and putting hot water in the larger pan.

Perfection. I made sure the ingredients were room temp, and put the pan in a water bath. Absolute heaven. We couldn't wait to try it; I made it last night and here we are eating it for breakfast! This is my new go-to cheesecake recipe. Thank you!

Five stars for taste! i am pretty sure i overworked it, then forgot and opened the oven while it was cooking. Needless to say, it cracked. I took 1/2 cup of Simply Fruit raspberry jelly and 2/3 cup of frozen thawed drained raspberries, mixed them together and poured it on top of the cheesecake. YUMMY!!!!

Have now made this recipe twice & it has turned out PERFECT both times! I used the exact ingredients listed. Only change was that I used a 10 inch springform pan and I place a pan of water on the rack below the cake... other than that I baked it just like it said and it was absolutely wonderful! I took it to work & it was devoured. My mom asked me to make her one for a get-together she is having. I do suggest letting the ingredients sit out of the refrigerator for a while, but I didn't have time for them to get to exact room temperature. I mixed the sugar & cream cheese with my mixer, but mixed the rest of the ingredients in with a wooden spoon. Anyway, give this recipe a try... it is awesome!!

My neighbors/friends are from NY.  They requested New York Cherry Cheesecake for (her) birthday.  It was well received with lots of ooohs and aaahs.  They haven't stopped talking about how good it was and now it is (his) birthday and I will be making it again today for him.  I know they will be thrilled to have another taste or ten.  Love it.  Thanks so much.

This was my first attempt.  Everyone loved it.  I wish that I had read the reviews first though.  I will definitely try use cinnamon and sugar in the crust, it could really use a little more flavor to me.  I would like to learn to add toppings like a turtle topping. Any suggestions?

I've been making this recipe for years and it's never once not come out tasting absolutely delicious.  I use my kitchen aid to mix it, but am careful not to overmix (it's not really that hard).  I try to make sure everything is at room temp before mixing, but even when i don't it's all good.  I tap the pan on the counter before putting it in the oven to get the air bubbles to the top, and I put a large pyrex bowl of water on the rack under the cheesecake.  And honestly - if it cracks, who cares...it still tastes AMAZING!!

I am baking this cheesecake right now. I have just turned the oven off and I noticed some small cracks along the edge. Never had this happen before and have never used a water bath. However, cracks are not going to bother me any. Hopeful it will turn out well. Since I have not tasted it yet I am giving a neutral rating. ALSO- This is the same EXACT recipe word-for-word that I found on my new Nordic Ware springform pan label!!

This recipe is amazing.  Pretty much fool proof, and I would know being a fool.  It always comes out moist, creamy and never cracks.  The trick of keeping it in the oven after baking is great and always leaves my cheesecake looking picture perfect. Hey, this recipe even comes out perfect with Italian ingredients, meaning no graham crackers (so I use crumbly butter cookies) and no sour cream (so I use something similar but not quite right).  I always have to add more butter to the crust for it to stay in the pan well, but I think that has to do with my cookie substitute. Great recipe.  Italians and Americans alike love it!

Wow! The very best cheesecake recipe I have ever come across. I have used this recipe 5 times, several by request, and have come out with 5 perfect cheesecakes. I have topped it with strawberry and raspberry sauce, but it stands alone just fine. I have never made any changes, just followed the recipe and have not yet been disappointed. Thank you for the recipe! It will be in my permanent collection.

I was a bit intimidated because I am new to baking and most of my recipes dont turn out. But this one was a hit! I didnt have a springform pan so I halved the recipe and used to pie pans. It still turned out awesome!

This was the first cheesecake I ever attempted and the recipe is AMAZING! A true cheesecake, not too sweet and not too bland! I tried the bain marie and also left the cheesecake in the oven as directed but both times I made this cheesecake it cracked. I don't know what the trick is! All I know is once you taste this cake it won't matter what the top looks like! It was a major hit and Christmas last year!!!! Will definitely make again and again!

Delicious. Very good directions and notes. Forgot the bain-marie and as a result it cracked but it didn't affect the taste at all. I made sure not to over-beat, had the ingredients at room temp, cooked it the amount it said and then turned it off and left it overnight. Again, delicious.

I made this cheesecake for a potluck at work and it turned out sooo yummy!  The only change I made was adding some lemon zest to give it some more zing.  I only left it in the oven for about  3 1/2 hrs after I turned the oven on and it did not crack:)

I made this cheesecake for Christmas and everyone loved it. I did make a few alterations to the crust recipe and used the crust recipe from one of the reviewers that posted on here. I also wrapped my pan with a Reynolds Oven bag and aluminum foil (as another reviewer had recommended) and used a waterbath. Other than that... I followed the instructions to the letter. I made sure that everyone in my family knew that the over was off limits until the next morning....so the cake was not disturbed. IT was PERFECT. No cracks, creamy and delicious. This is now my "keeper" recipe for cheesecake and the only one I will ever make again.....Thank you!

I really like this recipe.  Easy and makes a wonderful tasting cheesecake.  I made it for work about a year ago and have requests for it all the time.  Over Thanksgiving I made it for one of our desserts and the kids didn't believe me when I said that I made it.  I still haven't mastered the "no cracking" techniques, but no matter, it doesn't last long enough for anyone to see the cracks.

This was my first time making the cheesecake. It was perfect. I changed the recipe a little. I added 4 tablespoons of melted butter and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of sugar. I used some tips from my cookbook and on this website about cooking cheesecakes. (:

This recipe is a keeper!   Creamy, delicious and not too sweet.   I added a can of cherry pie filling to the top and the combination was perfect..

Great cheesecake... My daughter in law and I made it for my son's birthday.  It was great almost as good as my lost recipe. It came very close.

Delicious!  My family loved it .... I baked this in the evening and timed it to just sit in the oven until morning ... this helped me not to be tempted to open the door and peek.  No cracks and a beautiful, rich cheesecake awaited us in the morning.    Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I think I've hit on a magical combination here:   The crust:  1 1/2 sleeves graham crackers, 1/4 c. melted unsalted butter and 1 tsp. sugar.  The cheesecake batter:  Instead of 3/4 c. milk I used 1/2 c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. whole milk. I added 3 TBSP lemon juice and an extra tsp of vanilla.  I used only 2 1/2 TBSP flour and that was plenty.  I kept the other ingredients the same.  I think the lemon juice is key in preventing the cheesecake from tasting bland.   As far as mixing it: I mixed the cream cheese and sugar together first, then added the milk/cream, sour cream, vanilla, lemon juice and the pinch of salt together, mixed that until smooth and then added the sour cream and mixed it again.  Then I beat the eggs lightly in a separate bowl and added them last, beating just until mixed and completely combined and I think that method really helped keep the cheesecake from cracking.  I used a roasting pan full of water on the rack below instead of a water bath. Also, I tented it with foil halfway through baking to keep it from browning too much.  Great recipe! Will make again and again!

I don't eat cheesecake but my boyfriend's parents absolutely loved this!  I baked it in a water bath and left it in the oven after it baked for an hour.  The center wasn't completely set so next time I'll probably add 10 mintues onto the baking time.   I added more butter, some sugar (mostly white but a little brown) and a pinch of salt to the crust. Topped with mini chocolate chips and sliced strawberries.

This cheesecake is ridiculous! I used the "Graham Cracker Crust I" recipe from this site, which I use for any recipe that calls for a graham cracker crust. I used the Neufchatel cheese for this that is "1/3 less fat than cream cheese" and no one could tell this slighteset difference. I did cook this as directed in a water bath, but this center did not get cooked all the way. Next time I will allow it to sit in the oven with the door closed for a longer times. I opened the door and left it in the oven for about an hour this time, and it didn't seem to work. The taste was still amazing, though, and the longer it kept in the refrigerator, the more it hardened up. This has a very creamy texture that is just wonderful! It really does need to be refrigerated overnight before serving. It was delicious with a canned strawberry glaze, but it really does not need a single thing at all! Just amazing!

This cheesecake turned out really good!  People who said they normally didn't like cheesecake loved it.  I served it with frozen raspberries that I thawed.  The only problem I had was that it wasn't done after 1 hour.  I made two and had to put one back in the over for 20 mins because the first one was still too soft.  It may just be my oven.  I used gluten free ginger snaps for the crust and it turned out really well.  I will definitely be making this again.  Oh....one thing I changed was that I used lemon extract instead of vanilla because I ran out.  People really liked the mild lemon flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

Made this recipe twice in one week and it was enjoyed by everyone. I added the juice one lemon, because I like my desserts a little tart and it gave the cheesecake a nice light feeling. Otherwise I followed the recipe as is. Will make again in the future!

This cheesecake was so easy, that I thought I did something wrong.  We made it twice in one month, and my husband did not want to share it.  It turned out great both times.  We used the foil water bath, and let it cool for 2 hours in the oven. I pureed raspberry pie filling for the first, and blueberry pie filling for the second.  We marbled the cake with this.  I do have to say that the cake was so thick that the first marbling only did the top half.  For the second, we filled half way, marbled, then repeated on top.  I was told that it was the most beautiful cheesecake someone ever saw!  Thanks, Chantal!!!

I'm a bit dissapointed - I expected a dense and creamy cheesecake. The texture of this cheesecake is a bit ...crumbly - like very very fine cottage cheese. The taste is very milky. It's not bad though, therefore I'm still rating 4 stars - however, I'll continue to look for the perfect recipe.

Great Cheesecake!  I used separated oreos and used the cookies to make the crust.  I added the filling into the cheesecake batter.  After mixing the ingredients I folded in crushed oreos. It was the best oreo cheesecake I have ever made!!  Will use this recipe from now on!

I agree with everyone - it was excellent, got so many rave reviews.  It is a LARGE cheesecake, could feed 12 easily.    I baked at 325, left in the oven for 6 hours, greased the sides of the pan, and it turned out great.

THIS IS A PERFECT CHEESECAKE!!!  Do EXACTLY as the recipe says and you will have a very moist, creamy, crack free cheesecake.  The one thing I did just to prevent the cracking as I didn't want to believe the recipe (LOL) was spray some oil on the inside of the pan.  BUT you don't need it...it would have been fine.  My brother is a big cheesecake fan and he said that this was the best one he has ever ate.  Will be my ONLY cheesecake recipe from now on.  Thanks Chantal! :)

mine ended up cracking anyway. very good taste; a little tart for my liking. i used a different crust and added a topping so i think without my additions it would have been very plain. overall, very good.

I have made this twice now with Splenda to see if it would turn out nicely low-carb for my diabetic son, for special occasions. The first time was not too successful. The top browned and it seemed overly dry and flat. I tried again, with some changes, and it turned out ABSOLUTELY GREAT!  There wasn't even any taste of the Splenda at all. Here is what I did: Mixed everything by hand as patiently & gently as I could until it was just incorporated (the first time I made this I beat in everything with my mixer and that was a mistake). Then I lowered the oven temp to 240 degs., I also lowered the oven rack to just below middle. I used a plastic roasting bag to cover the spring form pan bottom and used a water bath. I set the timer for 45 mins. and left it in oven at 240, but began to watch for doneness by jiggling. When there was just a slight jiggle in the middle, I turned the heat off. That was at about 55 mins. I then let it sit in the closed oven for 5 hrs. It did have very slight browing around the top edge.  I think I could have turned heat off at 50 mins. Everyone thought it tasted great. I finished it off with a bit of raspberry sauce lightly dribbled over the top, and whipped cream piped around the edge.  I was so pleased with the outcome.

I have made this about a dozen times now. I tried the water bath once and it was the only time it didn't turn out perfectly, it stayed slightly gooey in the center. I have tried it by using all the flour, half the flour and omitting the flour completely, and we prefer halving it. I cover with foil the entire time or it browns at the edges. I have now started swirling pureed fruits in and it is still wonderful. This is my favorite standby now.

We thought this recipe was very good; the cheesecake was nice and dense and had a good flavor. The crumbs for the crust needed extra butter. I ended up nearly doubling the butter to get it to stay together. I added a few chopped pecans and a little cinnamon for extra flavor. Next time I'll use cinnamon graham crackers. We will definitely make this one again. An easier way to do the water bath is to put it on the shelf below the one the cheesecake is on; you still get the moisture without having to worry about the water seeping into your crust. We used that method and had zero cracks. It looked beautiful!

This was one of the best recipes I have ever tasted. My husband said it was better than the local cheesecake factory that we have in our area. I did follow a few bits of advise that other people blogged. One was that I used the oven bag instead of the foil on the bottom of the spring form pan. I was worried that the crust would get wet. I omitted the flour(I admit that was an accident but it came out fine). I only left it in the oven for 1 hour after the hour bake time only because I just didn't have the time. There were no cracks in my cake and it was sooo delicious! I have come to the conclusion that it is over beating. After the cream cheese and sugar were blended I only used a spoon to stir in the ingredients.A++++++++

I have been making this recipe for quite sometime now.  The only thing I have to add is 4T of butter to the graham crackers in stead of two.  I always use chocolate graham crackers for the crust.  This is a fantastic recipe and I always get compliments everytime I make it.  I also find that when I substitute off brand products or use imitation vanilla for this it is not as good as using the real stuff.

So far I have made this twice. The first time it was lumpy and cracked. The second time I let the cream cheese set out for two hours before hand and that made it nice and smooth but I cooked it in a water bath and that made the cheesecake soggy on the bottom. I will make this a third time and try to improve my skills. Despite my lack of skills it always tastes great it just doesn't look good.

We were looking for a great cheesecake for Christmas day and thought this would be the one.  We were expecting a dense, creamy cheesecake like you'd find in New York.  This recipe is light and airy which was a little disappointing.  The flavor was good but the texture totally missed the mark.

4 stars for flavor, 2 stars for texture.  In my humble opinion NY cheesecake should be dense and cake-like & this one was not. It was light and airy.  The taste was great though, so if you like your cheesecake light, airy and more fluffy, then this recipe is for you.

Despite two layers of foil, the water from the water bath leaked in. Next time, I'm trying an oven bag. However, the slightly soggy crust didn't stop anyone from devouring the cheesecake.  Made Blueberry Sauce to go with it.

This cheesecake did not work well at all. I followed the directions to a T. The center of the cake did not set, however the sides were turning brown. I've made cheesecake before with good results. I wont be using this recipe again.

Excellent cheesecake recipe that is worth making.  Per other reviewers, I  used a different crust recipe, which included pecans and a small bit of cinnamon.  Definitely  read and follow the cheesecake article on this site.  Other than water getting through my three layers of aluminum foil, the cheesecake was better than most "professional" one's I've tasted.

I made this using gluten free grahamn crackers and Bob's Red Mill Gluten free flour (1/8 cup instead of 1/4 because GF flour tends to be a bit heavy).  I then baked it in a 325 degree oven for one hour, switched off the oven and left it in there for about 4 hours to cool.  It cracked, but I think that was my fault because I couldn't help peeking AND I forgot to run a knife around the edges before cooling.  Instead of sticking it in the fridge, I used the freezer since I needed it sooner. Everyone loved it and there wasn't a crumb left!  I thought is was just "okay", but I'm told I'm my worst critic.

I made my first cheesecake last night using this fabulous recipe!  I took the advice of other reviewers and did the following:  -Greased the sides of the springform pan with a baking spray (prevents cracking).  -Covered the bottom of the springform pan with foil to prevent water from the water bath from seeping in.  -Creamed the sugar and cream cheese using a KitchenAid standing mixer.  Using a wooden spoon, I then mixed in the milk, eggs (one at a time), sour cream, vanilla, and flour.  -After pouring the mixture in the springform pan, I placed the pan in a water bath.    I baked the cheesecake at 350 degrees for an hour.  Once the hour was up, I left the cheesecake in the oven (as directed) to do its thing for the next 5-6 hours.  DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR AT ANYTIME DURING THIS PROCESS.   This morning, I removed the cheesecake from the oven and there weren't any cracks in sight (yay!).  Aside from greasing my springform pan, the pan I used is by Analon and has a non-stick coating which my have prevented the cracking.  My experience was great with this recipe and highly recommend that first-timers give this recipe a try!

hi everybody!i baked this cake..the recipe is great,but my cake didn't become what i want,because of these reasons:first because in most reviews i read before i bake it,there was a strong feeling of obsession injected into me about overcooking and over mixing..because of the fear of overmixing,i didnt mix it as much as i had to,the time for baking on 175 C,was somehow long,and my cake burnt partially,i wanted to exactly follow the recipe,and after i turned off the oven in the first look my cake had become a great one,but after 30 minutes when i turned on the oven's light again to see it,i saw that it's center has gone down,sunken..!although the oven's door was closed all the time!

I was hoping for a really creamy dense cheese cake.  Instead It was a very whipped texture type. It tasted great... but not quite what I had aimed for.

Great and easy recipe. The cheesecake was delicious. and finally I made a cheesecake that didn't crack.  I consider myself to be a pretty advanced baker but I have never had luck with cheesecakes.  The flavor has always been there but it always cracked, and it has sadly always cracked, not with Chantal's method.  
I loosened the edges with a knife when it was kind of cooled, though I'm a really good baker, I'm impatient, and yes on occasion I did quick small peaks, by opening the oven but that was after a couple of hours of cooling so it doesn't count :) 
5 star. Taste, simplicity, and non crackingness Good Luck

I made this for Thanksgiving, and left it in the oven overnight. Did it ever crack! It looked like Grand Canyon cheesecake! However, it tasted delicious, especially after I spooned a blueberry sauce over it. Also, it's a great big cheesecake that filled my 10" springform, but that's OK too, because my entire family loves cheesecake. I subbed lo-fat cream cheese and sour cream(but I didn't tell the menfolk), and it didn't compromise the flavor at all. Perfect dessert for an after-Thanksgiving pig-out - thanks!

The taste was delicous but I followed it to the letter and it still cracked in the middle.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving.  This tasted great! It was creamy and delicious! The only thing is it cracked alot.  I did exactly what the recipe said and it cracked in several areas.  I covered it with a strawberry sauce and nobody noticed!  I will definitely make it again.  I will try it next time with my convection oven and see if it makes a difference.  My oven temperature may be off a bit. Thanks for the recipe.  It is a keeper!

Made this Thanksgiving 2009. Followed the recipe exactly. This was BY FAR the best "homemade" cheesecake my wife and I have ever had. I used a jelly roll pan with about 3/4" water in it. Buttered the sides and bottom of the springform pan. Wrapped the outside in foil. Baked @ 350 for 1 hour, turned off oven, went to bed. Did not even peek!! I must say that the top was significantly more brown than I anticipated. No worries, the taste was unreal. Cannot wait to make this again for the next gathering. Congrats to Chantal!!!

This cheesecake came out AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly. There were no cracks, and it was cooked perfectly. I made sure to mix all the ingredients on the lowest setting of my mixer. If you have a mixer that doesn't have a LOW LOW speed just use a spoon after you mix the cheese and sugar like some other reviewers have sugested. One tip, if you are worried about air bubbles after mixing, run a knife slowly through the cheese mix before putting it into the springform pan, it helps to bring the bubbles to the surface so they pop! I will be making this recipe again for Christmas!

No need to look any further for a delicious New York Cheesecake recipe. This is by far the best I've ever had. I love making this for company because I know they will enjoy it. Thanks for sharing, you should be proud!

This cheescake is out of this world, I get so many request to make this from the guys in my husbands job, I changed it a bit, I add 5 eggs and no flour to make it creamier, then put a 1/2 cup of sour cream to the top after it's done baking and has cooled off. Amazing recipe!! Thanks for sharing...

This recipe is fantastic!  I had to add a little more butter to the graham cracker crumbs, but I didn't have whole graham crackers to start with so I may have had too many crumbs...  Also I realized when i was half way thru mixing that I had grabbed a carton of cottage cheese instead of sour cream!!!  Out of desperation I ran the cottage cheese thru the food processor and used it instead, cutting the flour down to 2 tbl since the cottage cheese was thicker than sour cream.  But it still turned out FANTASTIC!!!  Everyone loved it!

Probably the best cheesecake I've ever made.  I always had a problem with overbeating it.  Read the first review and definitely put in the extra effort to mix it with a wooden spoon after creaming the sugar and cream cheese. I baked this on thanksgiving day for a post thanksgiving dinner the following day.  Put it in the oven an hour before I had to leave for dinner, turned it off and left the house with the cake in the oven so I wouldn't be tempted to open it.  Great recipe, will try it with other flavors (orange/chocolate).

This is the first cheesecake I have ever made.  I couldn't find a springform pan in any of the stores, and decided to scale down the recipe and just make mini cheesecakes. They turned out perfect!  I baked them in the oven at 350 for 25 min (wasn't sure if I needed a water bath to make the minis, so I put boiling water in a pan on the rack below the cheesecakes).  I turned off the oven and let them cool for an hour and then put them in the fridge.  I served them with a dollop of heated strawberry preserves (unseeded).

Made it according to recipe and it turned out completely brown on top (not white like the picture shows).  Covered the top with fresh raspberries.  It was a stunning cake and quite popular to eat...however no one asked for seconds and it did not have very much flavor.  Slightly disappointing for all the work...

Ok, I’ll give this recipe 5 stars for mixing and baking methods, it worked well for me, no cracks and a decent texture (didn’t use a water bath). Only 3 stars on flavor though. To me this cheesecake fell flat on flavor and it didn’t seem sweet enough. The crust ingredients didn’t look right, so I followed the ingredient list on the box of Graham cracker crumbs. After I formed the crumb crust, I greased the sides of the pan. I then blended the cream cheese and sugar with an electric mixer. In a small dish, I beat the eggs together and added them all at once, using a rubber spatula to blend in the eggs and all the remaining ingredients, didn’t want to over mix. All said, I will make this recipe again but tweak it some; maybe a bit more sugar, and some lemon juice and grated lemon rind, so the flavor is more to my liking.

Overall, I thought this turned out really well. My only complaint is the crust; I thought it was a little too crumbly and moist. I like my crust to have a little bit more of a crunch, so I will have to play around with that part, but the cheese cake was great. It was pretty easy to make, and if you follow the directions and people suggestions for not over mixing and not opening the oven after baking, then you will have an amazing cheesecake afterwards.

followed up with a mixture of 3/4 C sour cream (room temp), 1/4 C sugar, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla and cracking isn't noticed at all! Just spread it on top a couple hours before you want to serve it and refrigerate. Also cut back flour to 2 Tbs for a denser cake. Everyone loved it. Definitely the dessert hit of the night. Thank you!

Awesome recipe!  Don't forget to bake it in a water bath.  I put rasberries, blueberries, and strawberries on top.  Once, I served this plain with fresh strawberry sauce on the side.  All I did was puree fresh strawberries.  What an absolute hit at my grandmother's party!!!!!!

My boyfriend and I made this a few months ago and will be making it again for Thanksgiving Day dessert.  You have to try it!  We made a raspberry puree and swirled it on top for aesthetics, then put a little more on the plate before serving.  Raspberry puree-raspberries and sugar in a small sauce pan on low until melted.  Then press through a sieve to separate seeds.

I made this over the summer and it was a huge success. The only thing, my oldest son couldn't wait to eat it so I took it out of the sprinfoam pan too early and it cracked. The water bath worked great. I am making this for Thanksgiving.

Good recipe, but I must have overmixed it, since it cracked regardless of the fact that I didn't open the oven and let it cool in there for hours. Next time I will use room temperature cream cheese, since it took the longest time and most effort to get smooth.

My 89 and 90 year old grandparents found it delightful. My grandpa said.....you can tell this is a real homemade cheesecake none of that store bought . The crust doesnt crumble and its delicious......and my grandma (who is blind and cant walk and has alzheimers at 90, bless her heart) couldnt have been happier. She said "its very "smooth" and she wanted more. Of course my brother wanted another one, so i added mini chocolate chips into the second one and he loved it. So, all in all my family is very satisfied. The only thing I didnt like is the chocolate chip one cracked and im not sure why. I think next time instead of buttering the edges and bottom I might use parchment paper along the sides and bottom and hope this prevents it from cracking. Might have been the extra ingredient though because the first one turned out beautifully!! Just to add when I made this the first time and cut into it it was really runny. I always refrigerate it now overnight after it sits in the oven for 6 hours. I think that may have been the problem because I havent had a problem since.

I always make a recipe to the tee the first time I make it. This I thought was too hard of a cheesecake. Next time I make it I will leave the flour out to make it more smooth. Other then that it had good flavor. I think this is a good staple recipe for cheesecake.

Wonderful cheesecake. It was my first time making one and I couldn't have asked for more. I would recommend using the Footnotes provided. I ended up making a water bath by heating an inch of water in a really large shallow-ish pot which could hold my springform pan.   Anyway, it turned out perfectly.

Pretty good, but I wish I had read the tips by other reviewers first...The flavors were wonderful, but mine didn't turn out as pretty as I'd hoped. I will try again another time and hopefully have better luck!

This cheesecake was the perfect consistency... but there were some flaws that were mainly my fault. Mine ended up with a huge crack in the middle. I'm assuming because I didn't use the bath. Luckily I covered with strawberry toppings anyways so you couldn't tell. Also, the sides got pretty burnt and I had to trim that part off. But the actual taste of the cheesecake was the best I have ever made :)

This Cheesecake was ok, I followed this recipe just as written, made no changes, though if i try it again, i might change a few things based on what others said. But out of 6 people in my house, 4 of us tasted an "egg" flavor, the texture was pretty good, but the flavor was blan.

Just like the reviews said it would be!  You have to chill it, I ate it prior to it being cold, couldn't wait for the 5 hours to be up and it just wasn't the same.  Now I have to pace myself so I don't eat the entire cake in one week!

This is a superb recipe!Didn't change anything and it tasted wonderful!I had a moment of concern however,when the about three fourths of the way through the bake time it had risen about an inch and a half above the pan rim.It fell to pan height during cooling however and turned out great.

I followed this recipe and took the other reviewer's advice and baked it at 325.  Unfortunately my crust came out really dark and I had a huge crack.  The crust did not taste good.  I've baked cheesecakes before and was disappointed with this one.  Will try it one more time with a water bath and not using a mixer after the cream cheese and sugar part.

This recipe, combined with the tips that are spread throughout the reviews makes for a great, easy cheesecake.  Like many people have suggested, bake it in a water bath, add some finely chopped nuts to the crust and cinammon, let the ingredients warm to room temperature... don't overbeat... put away that electric mixer after you've mixed together then cream cheese and sugar and only hand-mix from then on.  All in all, I've made around 6-8 of these and have gotten nothing but requests for more.

interesting that my review is right after "L"s, as i was making the batter, i sensed that it was lacking something - lemon juice. so i put some in. the cake is baking in the oven right now. so i cant rate it yet. but here's what i did - for the crust i used plain biscuits and crushed them in the food processor with a half a bar of semisweet chocolate. added to the butter (added a little more like someone suggested), added cinnamon, sugar and ground nuts.  double wrapped the pan but made the water bath on a lower shelf in the oven. didnt have enough cream cheese so used more sour cream. also i changed the amounts to 10 servings and it was good i did cuz more batter would not fit into my pan. i cut back a little on the flour and now all i have to do is pray...  also i wonder if anyone tried using vanilla pudding instead of the flour. i didnt do it but a lot of my cheesecake recipes call for that.  anyways i'll be back when the cake is ready (that'll probably be tomorrow since i plan on leaving it in the oven all night) gave a 5 cuz i cant review w/o rating. i hope it'll get a 5!!

I've made this cheesecake twice, once following the recipe exactly, and then second time using some low-fat products (cream cheese, sour cream, etc.)  Both times it produced a delicious cheesecake.  The cheesecake is very rich, so make sure you have a big crowd to eat it all!

I also had problems with the lumps after adding flour and vanilla -- I will sift the flour next time. Managed to worked most of them in. Followed the advice of others:  put a pan of boiling water on a jelly roll pan under the cheesecake and it worked very well.  The graham cracker crust with the sugar and cinnamon added as suggested by other reviewers was perfect!  This cheesecake was so, so fantastic.  It is creamy and delicious, no cracks, and just a golden color on the sides.  Will make this again, and again.

This is a good standard NY cheesecake recipe. Good flavors, but nothing that exciting. It was a little too heavy for my taste, but others like a denser cheesecake. I didn't like the crumb crust recipe at all--it was less a crust than dry crushed graham crackers at the bottom of my cheesecake. Look for a more standard graham cracker crust recipe.

I came across this recipe in the Top 20 and decided to give it a shot; I've never made a cheesecake before, and in fact am not really in love with cheesecake, but my boyfriend does love it so I decided to make him one.  I was SUPER worried, because a few years ago my dad spent countless days "figuring out" how to make the perfect cheesecake, that he was baking for a wedding rehearsal dinner, so I figured I had a challenge on my hands.  I'm very happy to say that it came out great!  I followed the recipe exactly, using the tips of others, and it came out very well.  I had no cracking, although my top did brown... which I'm a little sad about, and I'm having a hard time finding the answer as to why it browns?  Is it the water bath that prevents it from browning?  I did not use the water bath as suggested because I did not have a big enough pan to put the cheesecake in; next time I'll try that and see if it makes a difference.  My batter was a little lumpy, but I believe it was the way that I added the flour & vanilla that caused it to lump.  It wasn't bad and is not noticeable in the final product.  I'm giving 5 stars for taste and simplicity!  I had great fun and am looking forward to making more cheesecakes (and perfecting them!).

This recipe did not work for me. I did exactly as the recipe called for an it cracked and looked like a volcano. Not to mention that it was mushy. Sorry but I would not make it again.

I am new to baking and this was my first attempt at a cheesecake ever. I followed the recipe and took some pointers from the reviews (baking at 325 in boiling water bath). Also, I baked it in a square 8x8 glass dish because that's what I had available and I put cookie crumbs on top. I let it cool in the oven for about 4 hours, then put it in the fridge overnight. I was so pleasantly surprised, it came out just as good as any cheesecake I've ever tried - hah probably better! OMG, so delicious. MY SO is a big cheesecake buff and I know he will devour this this in 1 sitting lol.

My first cheesecake.  I made the recipe exactly as directed, and followed all the "cheesecake tips" from this web site.  It got rave reviews to say the least.  No cracks - looked and tasted wonderful.

My husbands loves New York cheesecake. He is very picky though and he loved this recipe and even went on to say it was the best he has ever had!! I did make some modifications to it. I omitted the flour, added one egg white 1/3 cup of butter and a tablespoon of cinnamon to the crust. What a difference this made! I did not get any cracks, I baked at 325f and skipped the water bath.

I have been baking for over 30 years, but had never baked a cheesecake. I had great success using this recipe and the instructions given in this article http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Baking-Cheesecake-Step-by-Step/Detail.aspx. My only disappointment was that the top of my cake was browned. Next time I will try baking on the lowest rack in my oven, reducing the heat slightly (345 degrees) and turning the oven off after 1 hour (I baked for 1 1/2, going by the article rather than the recipe). Ultimately I think the most important things I did were to a) use a water bath, and b) let the cake cool in the oven for 4 hours.

This is a great cheesecake and I have made it a couple of times. However I think it burns on top. I now use foil over it the whole baking time to prevent this from happening. Best served with some red fruits.

Loved it. Made it a few days before i needed it for a birthday celebration and it was excellent. The hardest part was keeping my kids away from it while waiting for the party. I followed the directions to the T and the only problem I encountered was I had massive cracks in the top. I'm not sure why I got cracks but not to fear...I whipped up some heavy cream and voila...cracks covered with whipped cream. No one knew the better. Not a crumb left on the plate after that party.

The cheesecake itself was very delicious, my family enjoyed it.  While I was making the crust, I couldnt understand how you can make the crust with only 2 tbs melted butter, you will never get the crumbled grahamn crackers moist with such little butter, So I did add a bit extra.  In the end I didn't like the crust personally, I will be using my moms graham  =cracker crust which has a bit of sugar in it.  I do think the cake itself is very good, and will be making it again, this time I am going to try it with some fruit on top :)

I followed the recipe to a T, but it did not work out. It rose so big, then cracked all over. It was a very disappointing and expensive recipe. I do NOT recommend it.

AMAZING! I made this as a special treat on Father's Day for my dad and he's still talking about it months later. Mine did crack but luckily my family cares more about taste than appearance. I will be using this recipe again for sure. Thank you so much!

so so so so good!  and pretty easy to make.  next time I'll use a cup of sour cream instead of 3/4 cup (just for personal taste). And my crust came out a tad soft... not sure if that's because water seeped in from the water bath or because of the filling.  **update** I think I used too much butter with the crust last time because this time I used the amount called for in the recipe and the crust came out great. I also only put half an inch of water in the water bath. It is definitely better cold! So after it is finished baking for an hour, turn off oven and leave it in there. After an hour, run a knife around the edges and then put back in oven. Let it sit in oven for a few hours and then in the fridge for at least a couple hours before serving. Making it in the morning would be perfect.

This is the Best cheesecake I've ever had. As good or better than the "cheesecake shops". Smooth and creamy. I follow the recipe and let it sit for at least 5 hours in the oven, overnight worked just fine. I didn't bother with the water or foil and it still was great. A spoonfull of mashed  fresh raspberries will top it off perfectly.

My first cheesecake! I followed the cooking tips from the first suggestion, and had no problems with this at all! Very easy, and the taste and texture are perfect!

This was my first time making this particular cheesecake and after taking the advice of some of the reviews...I had success.  I pre-heated the oven to 225 for 3 hours and 40 min. then turned the oven off and left it in for 3 hours. I like the idea of using this as a basis and then adding your own touch to it...with chocolate, fruit and different crust variations.  It was beautiful and tasty!

I had never mad a cheesecake from scratch before and this was the first recipe I came across.  It was very easy to make and it came out great.  Very thick and dense with a great flavor.  I did get a crack in the top and the bottom was a little dark but these were problems with my cooking temp (old oven tends to overheat).  As good a cheesecake as I have ever tasted problems not withstanding.

I've had this recipe in my box for 2 years and I FINALLY made it this weekend. It is awesome! My dad said it was the best cheesecake he has ever had in his life. Mine did crack down the middle, so I will be extra careful on beating next time.

This was my first cheesecake and it turned out wonderful. The texture and flavor is awesome. I received alot of compliments. I did not do the water bath and had a few small cracks but it was nothing to freak out over. I made strawberry and blueberry sauce to go on top. Will definitley make this again and again!!

This was my first cheesecake. So easy to make. This cheesecake is not too sweet, and so moist it melts in your mouth. Baked in a water bath at 350 degrees until instant read thermometer read 159 degrees. Left in oven to cool overnight. Definitely a winner.

I was extremely disappointed with how this came out. It had major cracks by the time it was done cooling in the oven. I was expecting an amazing cheesecake, but this didn't even taste like anything special. I don't understand what all the hype for this cake was about.

This was a hit among friends. Probably due to my amateur baking skills, I had difficulty incorporating the flour at the end. I ended up with little dark brown vanilla spots because I was afraid of overmixing to properly incorporate. I will probably mix the flour into a portion of the batter next time to better integrate. Otherwise, I covered the spots with dark chocolate drizzle and fresh raspberries--delicious!

Make sure the cream cheese is nice and soft. Also buy the precrushed crackers for the crust and follow those instructions. Other then that great and will make this all the time.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Unlike others who posted below, my crust came out perfect per the recipe.  The top on mine did come out darker than the one photographed, but did not affect the taste.  My family loved it!  This one will stay in the recipe file.

I just made this cheesecake for company and I followed the recipe exactly, except I made a different crust.  It turned out perfect!  No cracks and it was so smooth and rich tasting.  I might have to make this cheesecake every week now!

Great cheesecake! Didn't have a spring form pan so used two purchased crusts...filled them both from this receipe.  Cracked, but probably because I didn't have correct pan... never the less...enjoyed by more people than I'd planned on feeding......

Great recipe!  Mine cracked despite keeping it in the closed oven for hours...I wonder if it is because I have a new oven and the oven itself cools very quickly.  Anyhow, the recipe is good, but needs fruit or chocolate as it's flavor is very plain.  Perhaps more vanilla if you like the traditional plain cheesecakes.

Made this the other day and followed the recipe exactly with poor results, came out overcooked. Next time I'll use a water bath and instead of leaving the oven door closed for the 5-6 hours, I'll open it and let it cool that way. Flavor was good and texture was smooth but there is nothing spectacular about this recipe. Crust was crumbly too, needs to be prebaked a few minutes before adding the mixture. I'll try it again but next time adding something to bump up the flavor and adjust the cooking method to something more traditional to prevent overcooking and cracking.  One more thing, I always have an oven thermometer in my oven to be sure of an accurate temp.

I made this for my family, and everyone loved it--both with blueberry topping and without.  I started and then realized I didn't have any granulated sugar, so I substituted confectioner's sugar instead.  I was also in a bit of a hurry, and may have cut some corners, which I think was the reason my cheesecake cracked.  The recipe itself is great, and I will definitely make it again!

This recipe was pretty bad. It was edible... but I ended up throwing most of it out. The texture and taste was nothing like good cheesecake should be. I think it was the sour cream. Other cheesecake recipes I've tried that have come out well did not include this ingredient.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used a sugar cookie recipe for the crust. I left it in the oven for the 5-6 hrs, did not open the oven door once, even to take a peek. It turned out perfect!

I made this and it the taste is very nice.  The only trouble i had was their was a big crack down the center when it was done.  I am going to try and cool it slower next time and i am going to cover it with a bowl while it cools in the oven.

This was my first time baking cheesecake and I was very nervous! I made it for a girls night and everyone thought it was incredible. I did the water bath but still ended up with a small crack-no biggie though. I also made sure not to beat it to much. I used a wooden spoon to gently blend in the eggs. I used low-fat everything and it was just perfect. I also let it cool in the oven for about 5 hours then refrigerated it overnight. Topped with fresh berries.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect. I baked it in a water bath and there were no cracks and it was not too brown on top.  The water bath will help with the top not getting too brown.  I used another reviewers suggestion of a sour cream topping placed on top after it has cooled approximately 10 mins.  (If you do use the sour cream topping I would suggest clear vanilla as the brown vanilla will turn the mixture an off-white color)  I spread the mixture on top and allowed it to cool in my oven for 5 1/2 hours.  I let it chill in the fridge overnight to allow it to firm and set.  I served with fresh strawberries and raspberries (toss the berries in separate bowls with a little sugar to make a syrup).  I was expecting a much sweeter cheesecake but this was still simply delicious.  Next time I may increase the sugar amount by just a tad bit but otherwise this recipe deserves a high rating.  It is definitely five star restaurant quality.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks....

When you follow the instructions exactly, you will get a cakey cheesecake because of the flour content. So, if you are a fan of silkily creamy cheesecake like me, then by all means omit the flour (and maybe the milk too, if you like a denser cake). Also, double the amount of butter in the crust, and be sure to add a pinch of cinnamon or some other seasoning, else it'll be quite bland. In addition, if you want a nice-looking cake, bake it in a water bath - it is not as hard as you think and REALLY prevents cracking and over-browning. Just wrap the bottom of the cake pan with aluminum foil (if you are using a springform pan) and put it into another pan of hot water (around 80-90 degrees C), with the water reaching half way up the side of the cake pan. Then put them into the oven, and this is how difficult a water bath can be! I baked my cheesecake at 300 degrees F for 1 hr 15 min and let it sit in the oven for 2 hrs afterward. The cake turned out with a PICTURE PERFECT top (for the 1st time in my life)! One last tip: you can warm up cream cheese by cutting it into small chunks in a bowl, and then placing the bowl into another bowl of hot water (like around 50 degrees C). Stir occasionally until the cream cheese is fully softened.

This is what I'd been looking for! I did consider some reviewer's tips and made some changes (see below).  I also found the waterbath interesting & very helpful - no cracks and perfect results.  Leaving it in the oven to cool for those 5+ hours is the trick.   My changes only came because I didn't have enough of some ingredients and it was so late when I began, I didn't want to go shopping.  For the crust I used 1.5 cups of graham crackers crumbs (from the food processor) while the crumbs were in the fp, I added 5 T. melted butter, 1 T. sugar, and a quarter teaspoon vanilla or almond.  The balance of the recipe was follow except that I only had 1 1/4 cup sugar, so I added a 1/4 cup powdered sugar (and prayed it wouldn't mess it up).  Also, I only had 1 teaspoon vanilla, so I added that.  Then, since I had almond extract I measured out a full tablespoon -less one teaspoon and added that. I suggest a longer refrigeration time - maybe 5-8 hours.  It gets good and solid. The results... award winning! I've made it twice (the second time I had all the ingredients listed!)  My coworkers are still raving!  Thanks so much for my now favorite cheesecake.

This was my first cheesecake and it turned out creamy and delicious but looked absolutely terrible.  The looking terrible part was my fault though.  I was so concerned about overmixing that I missed a swoop of sour cream - there's a bright white swirl on the top of my cake.  Also, I added the vanilla and then the flour and should have mixed the vanilla in first because there are little chunks of vanilla-y flour scattered throughout.  Now I know for next time, just a little more mixing and possibly sifting that flour so it doesn't get chunky.  Anyway, awesome recipe.  Very easy, very delicious.

Loved this cheesecake! I made it for my brother in Law's birthday. Everyone had seconds! Even my father in law loved it. He NEVER thinks anyone else's cooking measures up to his. He took a to go box home with a piece of the cheesecake in it.

Wonderful recipes.  I made this in our Vitamix blender to get the batter done, and it came out wonderful.  Instead of the graham cracker crust, I used a cup of almond meal.  I probably needed more than a cup (I'll possibly even double it next time to give it a slightly thicker crust), and I needed more than the 2 tbsp of margarine.  That needs work.  But, the cheesecake itself came out wonderful.  I left it in the oven for 5 hours after I baked it, then fridged it overnight.  It was wonderful.  Will make it again.

It turned out to be great! I didn't have graham crackers and a springform pan, so I used OREO chocolate cookies and a regular 9 inch pan  No cracks, perfect cheesecake!

Simply one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had! I had some trouble with another cheesecake recipe, so I went looking for another one.  I decided to try this one and boy I'm glad I did!  We had some friends come in from out of town, and some neighbors over for dinner.  Everyone could not say enough about it!  The only problem I had with it was it rose above my springform pan (yes I used the 9 inch springform pan) so the middle cracked because it overflowed.  Other than that it was perfect!!  I definitely recommend this recipe!!

Incredible!  Only problem was my little son (9 yrs old) found it before served and helped him self out of the middle!  AHHH, after being scolded he couldn't help him self and went back!  Cake was pretty much destroyed but we sampled edges of it.  I was sorry he got in trouble but could understand his temptation!  It was great can't wait to make it again.

I felt it tasted too "eggy".  Reminded me of Chinese Egg tarts too much so didn't seem like "New York" cheesecake to me.  Hubby felt the same way.  The kids loved it so I will make it again.  I filled three pre-made graham cracker crusts with this recipe.

This is the BEST cheesecake I have had.  It is fluffy and light.  I overmixed it and there was a big crack on the top but it was still amazing.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.  It is easy to make.  Don't let the long baking/resting time turn you away.

Only the second item I have ever baked in my life and it turned out great!  Followed recipe for most part, but only added 2 tbsp flour and baked in a water bath as others suggested. Also baked at 325 for 1 hr and only let it cool in oven for 2 hrs before removing. I did leave it in the fridge overnight, and it came out beautifully. No cracking and the sides released easily from the springform. A definite keeper! Will try flavor variations the next time.

The cheesecake was OK, but I think I should have read more reviews and lowered the heat...My sides were way too brown and the middle sunk in a bit..I would have probably added more sugar too...Im sure this recipe would have been amazing if I had done these things..

I had to look up what a spring pan was, turns out it is the wierd pan thing that opens.  Follow the recipe and it works out to taste better than the stuff you get while out.  I had some lumps of cream cheese I was worried about, but I was more worried about over handling (warning from another reviewer), so I left them alone, they must have melted or something, as I didn't notice any lumps in the finished product.  Also I only let it cool for about 3 1/2 hours in the oven before I even opened the door, and gave it the boot 30 minutes later.  I made sure it had seperated from the sides and then put it in the fridge, I'm not saying it is a good idea, but in this case it didn't hurt anything and it was ready for dinner.

This cheesecake was awesome! I did the water bath and it was so awesome. Next time I am going to put some vanilla in it. It was tedious, but it was so so so so so good. I cut the slices smaller because 534 calories is way too much. The crust is the only thing I kind of had a problem with. I will use less and add some brown sugar. No cracking here!

Perfect.  I am in England so used digestive biscuits instead but it came out great.   I have read other reviews here suggesting putting it into a bain-marie and also running a knife round the edge quickly once the ovens off etc. But I followed this exactly as Taliesen said, greased the sides and didn't over mix the ingredients and it was faultless!

First and probably only cheesecake recipe I will ever use. After reading about many failed attempts on the internet I was worried about trying a cheesecake at all. Then I read some really helpful tips about making the cake and mine turned out fabulous. Biggest helpful hints were let ingredients sit until they get to room temp. Do not over mix your ingredients and last but not least cook as directed for 1 hour and turn oven off and leave it alone for 5 to 6 (don’t even open the oven door). It was PERFECTION! Another great tip was to foil wrap the bottom of your spring form pan before putting in the water bath. This recipe is totally worth the effort and honestly not as hard as it sounds.

I made this for father's day and everyone LOVED it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used the water bath and it turned out beautiful, no cracks or sticking to the side of the pan.  I served it with a sauce made of fresh raspberries with sugar, raspberry liquor and a little fruit juice.  It was perfect.  I can't wait to make it again, since there was none left over from the party.

I've made this cheesecake on two occasions and my family loves it. I got a reminder that I have to make it for thanksgiving this year. I've gotten cracks on at least on the cakes, but really ppl its not that big of a deal. A crack won't ruin the taste lol. I find that it tastes best ice cold. MMMmm yummy.

I have made this recipe for years.  To prevent the cheesecake from cracking a friend shared a tip with me a long time ago.  Put a baking pan of water on the lower rake below the cheesecake when baking.  Also as previous posters mentioned..NEVER open the oven.  Leave in oven for at least a couple of hours after baking. You will have a beautiful cheesecake that takes wonderful too.

This cake is easy and delicious!  It is my first non-cracked cheescake.  I have a terrible track record and hubby loves cheesecake.  My only complaint- the crust.  It is too thick and it is dry. Many other reviewers suggest other crusts, pick a different one.

This is a fool-proof recipe, as rated by a first-timer on cheesecakes! Even though I made a mistake (like not having the cream cheese at room temperature and ended up having a lumpy batter), it turned out perfectly. I halved the recipe as I had bought a ready-made crust, and the batter filled right up to the top of the crust. The cake turned out a golden brown and was thoroughly done. The only thing I could add is lemon juice for those who like their cheesecake a bit more tangy.

This cheesecake was very good, even my father loved it and he is very picky about cheesecake. However, I did not like the crust, I don't know what I did wrong.  I think I will add some sugar and more butter and It would be perfect. with changes made to the crust this is the best cheesecake that I had. even better than cheesecake factory.

although my cheesecake didnt turn out, i give this a 5 on taste alone.  excellent!  after an hour in the oven (ina water bath) i turned it off and left it in there for approx. 3.5 hours.  it wasnt done.  so this recipe is not fool proof.  you still have to check the cheesecake and make sure that it is done before you shut the oven off and let it sit.  and i believe when this recipe calls for 15 graham crackers, it probably means half of a graham cracker.  i used whole graham crackers and had to add more butter.  if i did this recipe again i would just put it in a prepared graham cracker crust (2 actually cos it wouldnt fit in 1) cos it's much easier and there is nothing special about the crust in this recipe.  i will definitely try this one again...hopefully with better results! thanks!

I will never use another cheesecake recipe again after finding this one.  I have made this so many times now and always get so many compliments on it.  After making it several times, I realized that I wanted a lemon flavor to it, so I typically add some lemon zest as well as the juice.  After a day in the fridge, the lemon flavor is very noticable.  I always use a water bath and have never had my cheesecake crack.  I also use my food processor to mix this as it gives it a much creamier texture with no lumps at all.

Very delicious! I made a sour cream topping that was spread over the cheesecake after it was cooled; the top cracked and I wanted a nice presentation. I then chilled it and served!

This cheesecake is absolutely mouthwatering! I followed the directions exactly, (using light sour cream),  although I did incorporate the water bath method while baking. It stayed flat and did not crack. Baking only one hour and then letting it stay in the oven for 5 did not work well for me-it was slightly undercooked (although I think I was the only one in our family who noticed! It was still delicious). Next time I will take the advice of LAURELC43 and bake it long and slow at a lower heat. I loved this recipe. It's perfect without any toppings whatsoever!

While we have yet to consume it (we're having company tonight), I have to say that this is a BEAUTIFUL cheesecake. Mine did develop a split, but I think that would be solved by using a water bath. Can't wait to try it!

Our family loves this recipe and I've turned it low carb to satisfy my husband who is on Atkins.  He saves his carbs all day so he can spend it on this fabulous cheesecake! I make the recipe as is, but omit the crust and substitute sugar for Splenda (either 1 1/2 cups of the granulated Splenda or 36 individual packets) and I use whole milk.  I followed other's advice, making sure all my ingredients were room temperature and I make it at night so that I can leave it in the oven to cool over night and put it in the frig in the morning. The cake is rich, so one slice definitely satisfies us for a dessert!

This cheesecake is perfect and this was the first recipe I ever used to make cheesecake from scratch. I made sure to bake in a water bath and watched so that I didn't overcook. I made it for my boyfriend (who is a cheesecake fiend), so I added a few drops of cherry filling sauce around one side and ran a toothpick through to make little graduated hearts before baking. Total hit! He loved it! And so did I!

Simply Decadent! It was my first attempt of making a cheesecake and it was a TOTAL hit. Everybody loved it! I followed the recipe to an extent (and given the fact it was my first time baking this, I took a really big chance here). I didn't use the flour nor the milk and I baked it in "bain-marie" for 1:45 minutes. Not a single crack! Also, I covered the sides of my springform with baking paper, so once I unclipped the clasp at the side of the pan it came off instantly and the cheesecake had that perfect round-shaped format. Also, as you can imagine, that made the clean up part a total piece of cake!   To see if the cheesecake is done, simply pinch a fork in the middle of the cake. If it comes out SLIGHTLY wobbly, that means it's done. Turn off the oven and let it sit there until it cools down.  The cooking process will continue, so the middle will be perfect by the time the oven cools down. In my case, when it was almost completely cool I took it out of the oven to speed up the process :).  Anyway, from there it went to the refrigerator for about 3 hours and voilà, the perfect desert! I covered it with framboise (raspberry) jam and fresh strawberries. Heavenly!

I just made this and it was beautiful. No cracks, creamy, just perfect. I would say this is restaurant quality for sure. I added some fresh strawberries to the top.

This is a great cheesecake recipe. It was very simple. The only change that I made was doubling the butter for the crust and adding 1 tsp of cinnamon to the crust, this was for personal taste. I used a springform pan and no water bath. I let my cake cool in the oven for 5 1/2 hours and it did not crack. I will be keeping this recipe.

I use this recipe for every kind of cheesecake. Sometimes Ill add something to it like pumpkin or chocolate, or slit the batter and create layers. I use 2 tbsp flour like others. I make a crust using cake mix (omit one cup,add 1 egg,1 cup oil and cook 10 min on 300). You cant add too much vanilla!

This recipe was my first attempt ever at making a cheesecake and it turned out wonderful.  I followed some of the suggestions by users and baked it at 325. I also put a pan of water on the bottom rack to keep the cheesecake moist.  I am not sure if it is necessary but I didn't want to take a chance.  As far as ingredients, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Everyone loved it!

this was good, but the center didn't firm up at all. it more like cheesecake with cheesecake pudding in the middle. i had to bake it an extra 45 min. maybe overbeating??? other then that, it tastes good, although i prefer a denser cheesecake. i also put in chocolate chip cookie dough & that was pretty good.

This cheesecake was delicious! I read alot of the users reviews and only did 2 tbsp of flour and doubled the amount of crust (I like thicker crust) and added cinnamon and sugar to it for my taste! It tasted GREAT but...it did get cracks and I even minimally mixed it, greased the sides of my springform and used a dish with water below it in the oven, next time I might try the water bath. I have heard it's hard to make a cheesecake without getting cracks though. It was my first time making one and my office LOVED it!!

Absolutely Awesome!  First time baking cheesecake..turned out fabulous.  As with prior bakers, I used room temperature ingredients...the cake did not fall or crack.  Baked at 325 for two hours I accidentally fell asleep it didn't matter, it was very brown, but still great.   I also made Strawberry Supreme Topping (from this website) I couldn't have made a better cake and topping.

I followed the recipe exactly and baked with a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake - no cracks.  Not only was it beautiful (I garnished with fresh strawberries), the taste and texture were incredible.  This will be my new "go to" cheesecake recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.

My family is in the initial stages of opening a restaurant so we decided to offer cheesecake as part of desserts.   I have many recipes that I gathered from cookbooks but this-Chantel’s New York cheese cake, is by far the easiest most delicious cheesecake I tasted better than cheesecake factory.  I made small changes though, as was advised by one of the reviewers, I used 2 tablespoon flour instead of 1/4, substituted the milk with heavy whipping and baked it for 3 hours with a bubble bath.  It came out perfect, no cracks.   I concur cracking occurs due over whipping, so I used my hands, yep that’s right! I used gloves, loll. I learned this technique up from a well known chef who was featured in cooking show.  In addition, best way to get fabulous cheesecake filling is by making sure all the ingredients to be in room temperature, it really does make difference.   As I mentioned previously, I have loads of recipes that tastes really good, however, some my cheesecakes cracked or the water from the bubble bath seeped in. This time it was perfect!  Thanks Chantal for this scrumptious and creamy cheesecake recipe……

My husbands favorite dessert is cheesecake so he's a connoisseur of cheesecake and he loves this one.  It's the basics.  If you've never made cheesecake before then try this one first.  It's not too heavy and not too light.  After you make this recipie you can change it the next time you make it according to your taste and add fruit or chocolate or whatever looks good in the fridge.

2nd time to make it, hubby loves it! The first time my son said that everyone at the party was raving about it. Served with a blueberry sauce and also strawberry supreme sauce from this site. Water in a shallow pan, buttered the sides and left in the oven, no cracking and comes off clean.

I am not a baker or a cook.  Yes, my cheesecake cracked.  Yes it was probably something that I did.  This was an easy cheesecake to make and I felt like I should be baking it for the Cheesecake factory.  I will make it again.  Anyone could do this recipe and it was so good.  I bought cherry pie filling to top it.

What can I say about this cheesecake?  It was GREAT!  I did have mine crack, but for a first timer making cheesecake I wasn't very upset.  I forgot to run a knife around the edge before it started cooling.  Back to how GREAT it tasted!  I made it for the office and had many people sitting around, talking, and taking seconds.  Multiple times I had compliments from the same people! Lets just say this is a great recipe and I already have requests for a second cake soon!

My husband (who is not a cook!) made this and it was delicious.  He said it was easy too.  We did not have a springform pan, just put the pan we used in a water bath. Still turned out great.  We added chocolate chips to one side too!

Simple classic cheesecake recipe.  My only alteration: I substituted two "neufchatel" for the regular cream cheese packages.  The cheesecake still turned out creamy and delicious while saving a bit of fat and calories.

I make a walnut graham cracker crust for this that goes with it so much better. I also don't cook it at such a high heat. I took another users advice and go for the 225 for 3 hours and 40 minutes. I don't add as much flour as suggested, I use 1/8 of a cup and that seams to go perfectly. I use chocolate to decorate while it is still warm so I remove the sides of the spring form before it is totally cool so the chocolate will melt the correct way. A water bath is highly suggested, I use a roaster pan and it works very well. I guess overall I love the basis that this recipe gives me and it keeps people asking for more and more. remember don't mix it too much and make sure your cheese is at room temp.

This was the first time I made cheesecake. The first time I made it as stated. It came out with a custard like taste (which I dont like). But it had no cracks and was slightly sunk in. The 2nd time I made it I used a wooden spoon, 2 tablespoons less flour and used a water bath. It came out perfect. Nice and smooth no cracks, a lighter shade of brown, and perfectly level :) My honey loved his cheesecake :) Thanks reviewers for posting what worked best for you.

Loved this cheesecake! It is perfect as written and I would not change a thing. It is creamy and not too sweet. The big plus is, it is so easy to make! I think the flavor and creaminess was the best on day 2 so plan ahead so it can rest awhile in the refrigerator.

AWESOME!  I made this the first time and followed directions to the T.  Cake was a little too done,fluffy and had one crack.  Took advice of others and reduced heat to 320 and it was perfect.  Nice and dence, no cracks, and I even added some lemon zest and extract.  Perfect!  Thanks!

Made this for Easter (Made cheesecake for 1st time). There is no need to fear this recipe if you follow all the tips from so many reviews, which, by the way, thank you all, very helpful.  Here it goes:  1. Don't go non-fat    a. Leave the flour out, not needed. 2. Do use a bain marie (water bath) 3. Wrap pan in foil, heavy duty, or twice wrap in normal foil. 4. Do heat the oven at least half hr before and put the water to boil first. 5. Do use electric mixer for cream cheese, do not overbeat, you'll see when to stop cause you won't see any lumps. I used it for the sugar and milk, too.    a. Always beat the cream cheese alone first.    b. ingredients must be room temp. 6. Use a wooden spatula and fold, do not mix, just fold the rest of the ingredients. 7. 1 hr to bake, 2 hrs to rest, do not open oven door. 8. You will not have lumps, cracks or anything wrong with the cake.   Hope this helps.

I made this for an Easter Party I went to yesterday, and everyone absolutley loved it!! I drizzled a little bit of warmed rasberry sauce with cornstarch over the cake and I made the crust with chopped toasted pecans... it was soooooo delicious. Just follow the directions and dont over mix.. other than that, you'll have no issues. I know 5-6 hours may seem like a while, but I just left it in the oven overnight and took it out in the morning. Thanks for the recipe, I'll definatley use it again! :)

OH my goodness!! If I could give this recipe ten stars, I would! I have been afraid of cheesecakes since the first few times that I tried to make them I was unsuccessful. I followed this recipe verbatime. I left it in the oven for 5 hours, opened the door, and Voila! No cracks in my cheesecake! Thank you for helping me overcome my fear!! LOL.

Excellent recipe!  Great flavor and perfect smooth texture. I served this at a lunch and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipes almost to exactly.  I just changed the procedure for the crust a little by adding a teaspoon on cinnamon with the graham cracker crumbs and then I baked it for 10 minutes before pouring the filling on top.  Also  baked the whole thing in a bain marie.

Delicious! I topped it with choc. ganache and strawberries and brought it to Easter dinner. Everyone thought I was an amazing cook. I have to tell you though, I forgot to grease the pan and it didn't crack or stick (must have been some sort of miracle)! I also used the tip of putting the lumpy mix through a strainer, and that really helped as I mixed the whole thing by hand and it was hard to get the lumps out. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow.  Wow wow wow.  Best ever, and I made it exactly per the recipe.  Well, except the crust - I added a pinch of cinnamon and sugar to the crust.  But it's the cheesecake itself that's the winner here.  It's soo creamy and good, deli style but not the really dry kind.  I love Ely's cheesecake and Cheesecake Factory, but this tops both.  I honestly don't think I've ever had a better cheesecake.   I did cook it in a water bath, greased the springform pan, and cooled it a couple hours in the oven (2-ish).  No cracking, just awesome cheesecake that all my guests raved about.  Frankly, I didn't know I could make something this good myself.

I took all the necessary steps to prevent cracking and this cheesecake came out beautiful. I greased the sides of the pan well, baked in a water bath with the pan double wrapped in tin foil and cooled in the oven for the rcommended 6 hours. I followed the suggestion to add cinnamon and nugmeg to the crust however I wish i hadn't. I didn't care for the crust. Next time i will use thr butter cookie crust from this site. I prefer this to graham anyway. This is a fantastic tasting cheesecake and i am glad that i made it for our Easter dessert.

Awesome recipe!  I substitute Bailey's for the milk, grease the springform pan, and always use a waterbath and it has never cracked.  Top it with a can of cherry pie filling mixed with a few tablespoons of Amaretto, or a half teaspoon of almond extract.  This is easily my most requested recipe!

This was an excellent cheesecake!!  The one thing that didn't turn out well for me was the texture, which I know was my fault.  I did not have an electric mixture and had to do it all by hand.  Could not get the cream cheese and sugar smooth enough.  Other than that it was perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Turned out golden brown with now cracks!!!

this is the first cheesecake i've ever tried and it turned out great.  i just left it in the oven after turning it off and there was no cracking.  i added some sugar to the crust and also tried it with raspberry flavored cream cheese which was also delicious.

I made this cheesecake for my sister-in-laws birthday last January and ever since people have been hinting that I should make this again! I decided to leave a review now because I am making this again for Easter, everyone will be so stoked : ) Some said that it is even better than Cheesecake Factory, thanks!

My first time making cheesecake and it came out excellent. It tastes like something you would buy in a store/deli. I wrapped a springorm pan in aluminum foil and baked this in a water bath, I think that made a difference in the texture. Next time I would add a little more graham crackers to the crust because it became a little soggy after a couple of days.

Great, easy cheesecake!  I normally make a cheesecake with heavy cream and was looking for a lighter cheesecake and this is it!  It still has that wonderful "true" cheesecake texture. It's cheaper to make too!  I took the suggestions of other and cooked this in a bath of water and it turned out perfect. No cracks!  I cut up strawberries added a little sugar and heated on very low heat and let the strawberries make their own juice, cooled and served on top of the cheesecake. Everyone LOVED it! Great recipe!

Delicious!  First time making a ny cheesecake and it came out great.  I did however use 2 tablespoons less of flour...I really like a velvety smooth texture.  I also added some smuckers seedless raspberry preserves.  No cracks or sinking.  I'm looking forward to making endless variations of this classic recipe.

Well, I was not sure it was going to be as good as everyone says, Plus I messed up the crust (too much butter) I wanted to take a picture of it tonight, I put chopped apples from the can on it with strawberries in the center and the sour cream topping underneath, but I couldn't get a picture, people at the party were lined up to get a piece and by the time I tried, it was gone! AND I brought a piece to my husband and a little while later got my own slice (what was left) he took that and said "Thanks"! I told him it was mine, and he told me to go get my own, LOL....So Yes, it is an EXCELLENT recipe!

Absolutely fantastic! You don't need to change a thing; this recipe is perfect as is! Just make sure that you leave the cake in the oven the full 5 or 6 hours-really makes a difference.

I don't know what I did or didn't do but this didn't come out right at all. I have been making cheesecakes for years and am not a novice baker at all but this didn't turn at all. It first rose like 5 inchs above the pan ( I didn't use self risisng flour) then it fell so it was sunking in..then after it cooled I cut in to it and the texture wasn't smooth at all. so Iam just sticking to what I know on the chessecake front

The BEST New York Cheesecake I've ever had.  Honestly, you have to follow the directions precisely and not worry about "what if it's not done."  Bake the cheesecake, turn the oven off after an hour and don't touch that oven door for six hours.  If you don't have the time, try a different recipe.  We loved it so much we made a second one a few days later.  It really is that good.

Wow!  I used this recipe for my 1st cheesecake baking experience ever, as a very special friend requested cheesecake for his birthday.  I can honestly say that it was the most delicious cheesecake I've ever had!!  That's about all I can say, it was fabulous and I can't imagine ever using another recipe.

I made this cheesecake for my husband's birthday today, and it cracked!  Not just little cracks, but HUGE cracks.  It tasted great, but I must have over-mixed it.  I'll try again....it was delicious!

This was absolutely divine. The only thing I would change is to either decrease the amount of graham crackers you use or up the butter. I used 3 Tbsp and my crust was still crumby. I let it cool in the oven for 5 hours and it still cracked but I think the cracks give it character. :)

This cheesecake can rival ANY restaurant!  As a matter of fact it tastes better than many restaurant cheesecakes that I've had.  This recipe is nothing less than top notch!  Thank you so very much for this recipe. It feels like silk in my mouth and it tastes heavenly!

4 1/2 stars. This was my first cheesecake so I wanted something simple. After it baked, I let the cake cool in the over for an hour before I peaked...and when I took it out later, it had a crack :-( Other than that, it turned out great.

I have been using this recipe for years now and I must say, it is THEE BEST. My Mum loves sweets but always disliked cheesecake, until now. Ever since I acquired this recipe and made it at home she has told me it is the ONLY cheesecake she'll eat. My brother and I think this recipe is a definite keeper and I gotta hand it to Chantal, this is an EXCELLENT recipe that doesn't require any modification! In a word, PERFECT!!!

This cheesecake was the best I've ever had. I was so excited that I kept looking at it so It did crack but It still tasted great. I was told that if you fill the broiler pan with water and place it inside your oven while you bake your cheesecake it will keep it from cracking. I haven't had the chance to try it out though. If your looking for a cheesecake to impress, THIS IS IT!

This is a great tasting cheesecake!!  I did put a pan of water on the lower rack. I baked it at 325 for 60 min.  I put three strips of wax paper about 3in tall around the edge of the spring form pan, this makes it so simple. The cheesecake does not stick to the sides of the pan therefore cracking does not happen.  Also the first time I made this I added the vanilla then the flour and it caused it to clump.. Do not let the two come into contact. The next time I made this I added my flour to my sugar. I also only use two tablespoons of flour.

This is by far the best cheesecake I've ever had!! I decided to make this cheesecake for my boyfriend for V-day and the cake was gone by the next day. I made strawberry topping to pour over it and it was a real hit. I didn't make any changes to the recipe and the texture was perfect. It cracked a little bit around the edge but I wasn't sure exactly how long to stir it for haha. I'll do better on my next attempt!

I had never made a cheesecake before and was amazed at how easy it was and how wonderful this recipe turned out.  I had several people say that it was the best cheesecake they had ever had!  Mine did crack in the middle, but it had no effect on the wonderful taste.

Might cut down on the sugar and add more lemon juice for some freshness, but was easy and delicious! I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream since that's all I had, and topped it with fresh blueberries & strawberries. An awesome delight ;-D

Very good cheesecake!  The only changes I made were that I used cinnoman graham crackers & also halved the recipe & made in a smaller pan.  By following the directions exactly & making sure not to overmix my cheesecake came out without a single crack (and I didn't even use a water bath).  Next time the only thing I will do differently is to add more butter to the graham cracker crust so that it sets up a little sturdier.

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake, and it was AWESOME.  Here are my tips/suggestions:  I followed previous suggestions about not over whipping cheesecake mixture, also I placed the cheesecake pan in a baking sheet filled with about 1/4in of water in the oven to heat evenly. I only let mine cook for 45 min because it was getting brown on top, but it was perfect. I then let it sit in the oven for a few hours to cool before sticking it in the fridge.  For those of you who are health conscious: I made it with 1/3 less fat cream-cheese, light sour cream, and a half-half mixture of Splenda and sugar, and it was just as good as the real deal.  Served it with a simple strawberry syrup and whipped topping- will make again soon!

Not that it needs another vote, but this was amazing.  Any mistakes (a few cracks) in the outcome were due to my lack of experience with cheesecake. I swirled a raspberry ribbon into the cheesecake while baking and served it with raspberries on the side.  Delicious!  This is my go-to recipe from now on.

This is a very good recipe. I have been searching for a good cheesecake recipe for years and have not had much luck. The only thing that disappointed me was that I had it on hand already, on the back of the springpan insert that came with the pan. Identical, word for word.

This was the first cheesecake I ever baked, and everyone who ate it loved it.  I was pleased that there were no cracks, but I did use a water bath.  I had the same issue as Ali where I had some small lumps of vanilla and flour that I couldn't get rid of.  It was an appearance issue rather than a texture or taste one. Add the vanilla, then add the flour slowly.  I served it was some strawberry coulis.

WOW!!! My husband Loves this and so do I, and I am not a big cheesecake fan... Well I wasn't before this. the only thing I did was some of the suggestions on the crust. My crust came out a little soggy, so I am going to tweak it a little, and of course mine cracked, so I will lower the temp and cook longer in a water bath.  Thank you so much for this recipe it was as my Hubby said "The best cheesecake I ever had!"

This was my first time ever making a real cheesecake. It turned out beautiful and tasted better than store bought. I followed the recipe exactly. No changes. It was also very tall (2") and would have made a very stunning 10" cheesecake instead of 9". I will make this again and add chocolate chips.

I originally gave this 2 stars but the taste was good so I've updated it to 3.  Original review:  I'm giving it a 2 for the GIANT craters that developed while cooking.  I took it out of the oven after 4 hours of "cooling" time, which was way too late.  I can't imagine what it would have looked like if I'd left it another 1 to 2 hours, as the recipe had called for.  I mixed it by hand and have a hard time believing that I over mixed, which other reviewers said could be the only reason for it to crack.  Maybe it wouldn't have cracked if I'd used a water bath.  Unless the taste turns out to be really good, I doubt I'll try this recipe again.

When I put the cheesecake in the oven it looked good but then it started to go a little brown at the corners and the got a huge crack in the middle. It tastes amazing, but doesn't look that great. I had some left over and thought it would be cool to bake them in a muffin tray. Bad idea. Just don't do it. I'm going to try to make this cake again, except this time I'm taking the heat down to 300* rather than 350*.

Ok I just attempted my first ever cheesecake and I must say that is turned out great.  Was worried about the cracking or sinking in the middle but it looks wonderful.  I did use the water bath and wrapped my pan on the sides and bottom about 4 times and water still seeped in so I am thinking of another way I can do the water bath without water getting to the crust.  My oven acts crazy at times and the temp wants to just shoot up for no reason so I did have to keep peeking at the oven temp that I have in my oven to make sure it did not act crazy.  Still with me peeking at it several times throughout the baking process it turned out just fine.  I plan to add the three layers that I make my black tie mousse cake on top of this cheesecake.  Check out my profile for those pics and layers.  It is going to be rich I am sure but it is for some really big sweet lovers.  Hope that the cake turns out for the next person that attempts to make it for the first time like it turned out for me.   Oh and thanks for all the tips from the other reviews posted, they came in pretty handy.  Thanks Chantal.

When I was a kid in Morrisville, PA there was a little bakery that I would get a slice of cheesecake from whenever I had enough money. Until now I've searched/experimented for a cheesecake that was as good as one from that bakery. I've found it!! Simply the best I've had, although I substituted french vanilla flavor for the regular vanilla.

I used this recipe to make my first cheesecake ever and it came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly and used tips given by other reviewers. I used room temperature ingredients and only mixed the batter to blended, careful not to overbeat. I also used a waterbath in the oven and left the cheesecake in the oven for about 3 hours. The result was a smooth, creamy cheesecake that was not cracked, dry or mealy. I was very careful, took my time and read through the recipe completely. Everyone raved about the cheesecake and I will be making this over and over again. I must warn that this made a HUGE cheesecake! This recipe could be cut in half and use a smaller springform pan to make a more reasonable cheesecake size.

This was very creamy!   to make into mini cheesecakes (6 cupcake size) reduce to 1/4 recipe and use 1/3 cup, ~2 graham crackers, 1 tbl butter and sugar.

This is a very good recipe for a basic NY cheesecake.  I served this with Ruby Red Strawberry Sauce, which I found on this site -- made it darn near irresistible.  I placed the water bath on the rack below the cheesecake and ended up with a 3-inch crack in the middle of the cake, which was totally fine because the strawberry sauce went right on top of it.  Next time I'll put the cheesecake directly in the water bath.  And because the side of the cake was a bit burnt and dry, I'll try baking it about 8-10 minutes less.

I have to agree with the other people who have rated this cheesecake recipe.  It is the best cheesecake I have ever tasted.  It came out perfect with no cracks or bubbles.  I did have a problem with the crust.  I had to double the butter to keep it from being too crumbly.  Also, the water from the water bath seeped around the foil so it was just a tad bit soggy.  I'm making it again tomorrow so I'll try the suggestion posted here about using an oven bag instead of foil.  All in all, it is an outstanding, easy recipe.  Fantastic.  Thanks!

This cheesecake is OUTSTANDING! I have never made a cheesecake before and this was easy and delicious. I served it on Thanksgiving and again on Christmas and my family raved. I have to admit that I am to impatient to wait 4 hours to open the door so I let cool at room temperture and the result was a very minimal crack which I covered with a can of baking cherries. LOVE THIS RECIPE THANKS CHANTAL.

This was super easy to make, I just used a couple of store bought grahm cracker pie crusts to save time. I did not leave it in the oven as suggested as we needed to put a turkey breast in...but the cracking was minimal. I don't like Cheesecake but everyone else said it was fantastic!

I made this cheesecake for a dinner party.  I hadn't made a cheesecake for years and I was nervous that it would crack, or wouldn't be really good.  

I followed some of the tips left in other reivews and found them to be very helpful.  I greased the bottom and sides of the springform pan, placed a pie plate with water on the shelf below the cheesecake, and turned off the oven after 1 hour and left it in the oven overnight.

The only thing I did wrong was I added too much butter to the crust, and it was a bit soggy, didn't taste bad.

The cheesecake was a huge hit, even my 9 year old liked it!  I will definetly make this again

Very very good recipe.  I forgot to add the flour in it, oops!  so I had to bake it a tad longer, but it barely split (and it only split from over baking).  Very creamy!  Yum!  My husband is crazy about cheesecakes and he said this is his favorite so far.  Thank you!  (oh i also added a little lemon juice too)

This is the easiest and best cheesecake I have ever made.  I did take the advise of previous reviews and used a water bath while baking.  I will never buy another cheesecake again.  Plus it costs about half the money to make your own that you would pay for a cheesecake in the store, and its better.

This was super easy! I made this awhile ago and never rated it. I made it for a birthday at work and they all raved about it. I made this at night and left the cheesecake in the oven overnight. It came out perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

I baked this for my office's annual New Year's Eve luncheon (with a Bing Cherry topping) - it went FAST!  My pal, who loves cheesecake, gave me her personal "thumbs up," which means it's TERRIFIC!!!

I added a touch of lemon juice, wrapped the pan in aluminum foil, and put the bain marie on a lower rack...no cracks whatsoever.  Perfect!  I will definitely make this many times in the future.

Just what I wanted - not too sweet and excellent texture.  It cracked, but that was okay.  I'll try it again and be careful not to overbeat as suggested.  Thanks!

I've made this recipe several times now, all to rave reviews.  I changed it a little bit, 4 tbsp of butter in the crust, along with a dash or two of cinnamon, only 1/2 cup of sour cream and 3 packages cream cheese, but that's just my own personal preference.  This cheesecake is seriously better than I've had in some restaurants, and much better than any store-bought cheesecake I've ever had.  It cracked on me at first, but I started both greasing and flouring the springform pan really well before use and it seems that helped a lot.  As everyone else is saying, it's also really important not to overmix.

I've made cheesecakes for years for friends and co-workers.  This recipe received rave reviews from those who've become consummate cheesecake critics.  I use a variety of crusts and sauces, but this is my most used filling.  A real winner!

Just made it yesterday - my first cheesecake ever! It is YUMMY! Tastes exactly like the ones in NYC (a bit too sweet in my opinion but I'll just add less sugar next time).
Also I added a bit of lemon zest - works very well.

Simply the BEST and easiest cheesecake recipe to follow. I made this the night before I had guests and baked and forgot about it in the oven until the morning. I topped it with blueberry topping that I purchased ready made. Yum, yum, yum!!

I had to scale down the recipe because I only had 3 blocks of cream cheese. Also, I didn't have any sour cream, so I used yogurt instead and it still turned out perfect!

Followed recipe exactly and a huge crack developed.  Tasted great though.  I think the best way to eliminate "the crack" is to use a water bath.  Used cinnamon graham crackers - highly recommend!

I followed the directions to the T, but when I took this cake out of the oven, I was very disappointed.  The cheesecake had a MAJOR crack in the center.  I disguised the imperfection with cherry pie filling.  The flavor and texture of of the cake is what blew me away...OUTSTANDING!  I will definitely make this cake again, but next time I will include a pan of water just below the cake to add moisture...I hope.

This is by far the best-tasting cheesecake I've ever made or even tasted.  It has such a wonderful texture.  It looks, feels & tastes very professional.  Even my husband loved it & he's very picky when it comes to cheesecakes.  The only trouble I had was that it cracked-- pretty badly too.  Not sure what I did wrong.  As other reviewers suggested, I think next time, I'll try lowering the temperature.  I did have a dish of water in the oven for moisture, but that didn't seem to help.  I didn't have a compote available, so I made a mixture of cream cheese, sour cream & sugar (to taste similar to the cheesecake) and I spread that over the top like a frosting, filling in the cracks.  I then spread it evenly with a frosting knife.  No one ever knew that it had been cracked!

Forgot to grease the pan but don't think it was a problem.  Doubled the recipe and made a 10 inch, a 9 inch and a small one.  I was worried about it all fitting in the 9 in because I'm not used to doing a deep cheesecake.  My 10 in was on the top seemed a little dry, a little bit brown on top and had a huge crater (probably due to overbeating) but the smaller ones on the bottom came out nice and creamy (almost undercooked).  I didn't use a water bath for any of them.  With the help of an online video, I was able to patch up the crater to look like new with no topping!  We ate the 9 in and everyone loved it (gave away the 10 in).  Had added toffee bits but they were hard to find when all was said and done.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this yesterday for Christmas dinner.  It was the second time I had ever made a cheesecake and I was really worried I wouldn't do it right.  Well, everyone at the party LOVED it and said it was better than the stuff you get in restaurants!  My husband said it was worth $10 a slice!  It was very creamy and light and the taste was phenomenal.  The only thing I changed was that 2 tbl that you add to the graham crackers was definitely not enough butter.  It took me about a stick of butter to get the crust moist so that it would stick together.  Otherwise, wonderful!

Was excellent, first ever cheesecake I made, too. I didn't let it sit in the oven for the suggested cooling time, just an hour and then to the fridge, turned out perfect. Will definitely make again.

This is the best cheesecake we have ever had. It is the perfect flavor with a melt-in-your mouth consistancy that makes the simple act of eating it into a sensory experience. As a side note, we found out that it is very important to make sure that you get aluminum foil that is wide enough to wrap the outside of the cheesecake in a single pass. Our's did get some water in and caused the crust to get a touch soggy at a few points, luckily it didn't do much damage. Still, there is no doubt that in our house, this recipe will be used over and over for years to come.

This is a delicious cheesecake! It's very creamy without being dense or overly sweet. I was skeptical about leaving the cheesecake in the oven after 60 minutes for 6+ plus hours, but sure enough, when I removed the cheesecake, it had the smoothest top without a single crack! I made a fruit topping using a cup of red currant jelly that I heated up in a saucepan. I added a pint each of raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries and stirred to cover the fruit. I spread the topping over the cheesecake after refrigerating for 1 hour. Delicious!

By far the easiest cheesecake recipe ever!!
The great thing about this recipe is it is sooo versatile, you can make anything from a chocolate cheesecake to a cherry top cheesecake with this same basic recipe.

My first cheesecake attempt and like almost everyone else I have to give it 5 stars. I rushed through the cooling process because it smelled so good, so I got a little crack on top. But I learned my lesson as that was the only flaw in an otherwise perfect cheesecake. The texture is just right and the flavor is right up there with the best I've ever tasted. And it's surprisingly easy to do. I substituted half and half for the milk, otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter and next time I won't change a thing other than my patience in allowing it to cool properly. So far 4 different cheesecake lovers have had a slice and every one would give it 5 stars.

This was the first cheesecake I've ever made so I was really nervous about messing something up but it was surprisingly easy. I made sure to read other reveiwers thoughts and adjusted a few things. I think the water bath was probably my saving grace because my cheesecake didn't crack at all and it didn't cave in. I doubled the butter for the crust, mixed it in and then added a bit of water just to help pack it down. I'll probably add a bit of egg whites next time instead of water. I also added just a few drops of peppermint extract with the vanilla to give it a slight hint of peppermint taste. It was the perfect taste without being overpowering. 

When serving, the very center was just a little too soft and didn't hold form so next time I'll cook it for about and hour and a half instead of 1hr 15min. I also should have given it a little more time to chill in the refrigerator (will do overnight next time). 

My husband is in the army and his soldiers will try ANYTHING you bring in so they were my guinea pigs for the cheesecake. Naturally it didn't last long at all and they're already asking me to bring it in again!

This is a great recipe. I wanted to make a cheesecake that didn't taste so much like cream cheese. This was perfect, not too sweet, and extremely rich. It was great!

Ee-freakin-GADS! Awesome cheesecake! I made it for my family for Thanksgiving.  My sister's a vegan so I had to use soy products (cream cheese, sour cream). Also, I learned that you can substitute eggs with applesauce (3 tablespoons = 1 egg) and even with all the variations, it was so delicious! I can't wait to make it again - and this time, as directed! Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM!
Recently made this for thanksgiving, and it was absolutely delicious. It DID crack, and I was a little bummed, but it still tasted fabulous. I'm a new yorker, and I know my cheesecake, and this was just like real NY cheesecake! Next time I will try a water bath to prevent cracking. Enjoy!

I made it exactly as described, except as some of the reviewers suggested, I used a water bath, separated the eggs AND I cooled it immediately. I also banged the springform pan on the counter a few times before baking, and I saw bubbles come to the top and pop. No cracking, and rave reviews from my family. The crust was great, the texture was great.

I never thought I could make such a delicious cheesecake. I absolutely love cheesecake, and now I love my own, following Chantal's recipe. I dont have a hand mixer, so I softened the cream cheese in the microwave and used my hand.Messy, but it worked! Topped with thawed Straberries and whipped topping.Delicious!Made 3 of them using premade graham crackers pie shells.

I have made this recipe many times and always has turned out great.  The only thing I changed is the crust.  We aren;t fans of graham crackers so instead I use Vanilla Wafers[for the holidays I use Ginger Snaps] or Lady Fingers.  Just lay them in the pan and pour mixture over it.

A great recipe that never fails!

I made 2.5 cheesecakes out of this recipe as I wanted a thinner cheesecake, and it still came out awesome.  I used a graham crust and once it ws ready to serve, I topped it with granny apple slices and home made caramel.  It was a hit!  Added:  I used the second cheesecake for Christmas (froze AWESOMELY), topped with chocolate ganache and fresh strawberries, posted a pic).  Rave reviews again!

This recipe was WONDERFUL, I had to change it a bit because we have to watch our cholesterol... So I used only 3 pkgs of LOW FAT cream cheese, LOW fat sour cream, non fat milk & egg beaters & it turned out AWESOME.  I did add about 1/2 cup more of sour cream since I did not have the 4th pkg of cream cheese.  I would do the water bath next time.  I also had to cook it about 20 minutes more than the recipe says, but that could be because of my changes....  YOU SHOULD TRY THIS!!!

Absolutely perfect.  I will use this recipe as the base for all my future cheesecakes.  I substituted almond extract for the vanilla and it was excellent.  Served with blueberry sauce from our hand-picked blueberries.  Rave reviews for this Thanksgiving dinner!

My brother-in-law loves cheesecake, but has very high cholesterol.  So I made this "fat free."  Used fat free cream cheese, fat free milk, egg beaters, fat free sour cream.  And in the crust I used honey rather than butter.  It is a hit every time, with less guilt!

This was the first time I have made a cheesecake. Mine cracked and fell, but after reading other reviews I know what I did wrong.  Other than that the cake is awesome! 5 stars for the recipe, 1 star for my skill.  I will keep trying.

I loved this! It was some work mixing up everything, especially since I didn't soften the cream cheese first (my bad). But the finished result was awesome, even though I overbaked it a bit! I HIGHLY recommend refrigerating it overnight if you can, it was MUCH tastier the next day!

Mine cracked on both tries, but love the recipe anyway.  Not quite as heavy as "Basic Cheesecake" which is also good, but I think this might be my new fav.

I followed all the instructions and came out with a perfect cheesecake. I do recommend leaving the cheesecake in the oven for several hours before refrigerating or else the center will be runny and uncooked.

I made this as several different parties and at least one person asks me for the recipe every time.

Incredible!  Thick and moist, but lighter than most cheesecakes, not so filling.  Great flavor, the whole family loves it!  Leaving it in the oven after baking really works, too... no cracks!

Based on cooking this about 15 times:

Grease pan well (use cooking spray).
Ingredients need to be at room temperature.
Mix everything slow, and by hand.
Use "Philly" cream cheese (just a favorite).
Bake at 325 degrees (not 350).
Bake for only 60 minutes.
Do not open oven for three or four hours!

I've found that this makes a perfect, delicious, un-cracked, cheesecake!  Really the best!

I was sooo careful not to overmix, but my cake still had 2 big cracks in it :( Doesn't matter. It was divine! It was my father's first time trying cheesecake and this one was definitely the way to go! I used the "Graham Cracker Crust" for this cake (the one that only had 3 ingredients and did not require baking prior to filling) and it was a great combination! Will DEFINITELY make again. Maybe I'll turn the temperature down a little bit this time, or turn off the oven a bit sooner.

Excellent recipe with some minor changes!!!!  Just made this (have several really good cheesecake recipes but can always use one more).  Set oven to 300 (lower temps help prevent cracking.)  Bake crust for 10 min before adding the filling.  Add eggs LAST and only mix GENTLY to incorporate.  Incorporating too much air into batter is one of the things that can cause cracking.  Make sure cream cheese is at room temperature to avoid lumps.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it was still plenty for a 9 inch pan.  Picture appears to show a sour cream layer on the top which is not part of the recipe (some recipes do that, shortly before end of bake time, you add sour cream mixed with some sugar on the top).  6 hours to cool in a modern oven is totally unnecessary and really has nothing to do with preventing cracks.  I used a glass dish with hot water on the lower rack.  Even when you put foil around a springform pan, it only takes a pin hole leak to ruin the filling.  I never place springform pans in water when baking.  Certainly after 2 hours the oven will already be at room temperature.  Think about how long after an oven cleaning cycle is is back to room temperature.

This was my very first attempt at making cheesecake, it turned out perfect! Followed the recipe exactly, didn't have a pan big enough for my pie plate to fit in so I just put a pan full of hot water in the oven with the cheesecake. I was a little discouraged that my cake had become lopsided while baking but I left it in the oven to cool as directed and everything settled itself out! A perfect cheesecake!

This is the first time I've ever made a real cheesecake and it came out PERFECT!  I read all the tips from others stating not to over mix the ingredients and to cook for one hour (I cooked it at 325, and in a water bath), then turn the oven off and leave it for 6 hours. There were no cracks and no browning.  I only used 2 tbsp of flour and made sure all the ingredients were ROOM TEMPERATURE.  I greased the spring form pan as well and refrigerated it overnight.  I had cheesecake for breakfast this morning and it was the BEST I've ever had!  Very decadent, creamy and smooth. Awesome recipe and DELICIOUS!!!

This was the first time I ever made a cheesecake and it turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream.  I also added some sugar and cinnamon to the crust.  I sprayed pam on the pan before I put the crust in and I only beat the cream cheese, sugar, and milk then mixed the rest by hand.  I did set out the cream cheese for a little bit before I got started but it was still pretty cold.  I didn't have time to wait for it to come to room temperature.  I also put a pan with water in it on the rack below the cheesecake.  I was too afraid to put the cheescake in a water bath for fear of water leaking into it.  My cake didn't crack, the flavor was great, and it was nice and creamy and not too dense, just how I like it.

This cheesecake is really delicious, but there's a lot of room for error--overbeating, opening the oven, not greasing the sides, etc.  Mine was not as dense as I would've liked it be, but it was still very good.  I may be alone in saying this, but I will add more sugar next time.

I made this for family as a special occasion dessert and forgot to rate it.  This is a wonderful, creamy, rich cheesecake.  I have tried other recipes and this one is fantastic.  I did bake with a water bath and let this set up in the oven after I turned it off.  Chilled overnight in the fridge and it was fantastic.  Gave guests the choice of blueberry or cherry topping and had no leftovers.  This cheesecake was the highlight of my dinner, and I will definitely make it again.

Very nice, elegant cheesecake.  Added about 1/4 cup chopped pecans and 2 t cinnamon to crust.  Wrapped bottom of buttered springform pan with 2 sheets of aluminum foil and then placed in 10x15 glass pan filled 1/2 way up with hot water.  Cooked @ 350 degrees for 1 hour, turned oven off and left in for 6 hours.  (Mustered up my will power and didn't open the oven door to check.)  Came out absolutely perfect - not a single crack and released from pan perfectly without the need to run a knife around edge first. Served with 3 small glass bowls on the side filled with cherry, blueberry and apple pie filling for the guests' topping choice - very elegant! Creamy, light, not too sweet.  It was a hit - thank you!

Great cheesecake recipe. First time I’ve made a regular cheesecake. I made a peanut butter cheesecake once before and that came out great, but the peanut butter and cream cheese was easier to mix together. When mixing the ingredients use and electric mixture or a blender if not your mixture will clump. Please follow the cheesecake rules! Google them, if you don’t your cheesecake will crack.

I recently made this recipe for a dinner party of 10.  I got raving reviews from almost everyone.  A few even said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had.  I took the other reviewer's suggestions into account.  For the crust I used: 1 1/2 cups of graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/8 cup of sugar. I baked it at 325 for 60 minutes but still found it a bit too undercooked for my taste, next time I will keep the temp at 350.  Also...make sure you use good quality cream cheese!  I only had no name available and it was super lumpy.  I had to use the mixer throughout to try and get it nice and smooth.  I did use a water bath, but can never seem to keep the water out and I end up with a soggy crust! Even after two layers of foil. Anyway, no cracks which was nice!

What can I say to give this recipe its fair judgement? This is absolutely the BEST recipe you'll ever find for a New York Cheesecake. I became famous in my social circle for making this divine cake. It turns out AMAZING EVERY SINGLE time. The best thing is you can use different toppings (cherry, blackberry, and strawberry are great choices) but the batter's just perfect.

WOW!!!  This was so easy and wonderful!  I had a crack down the middle of mine, but I had to cut it anyway so who cares =). I tried the water bath and letting it cool in the oven after it was finished and it still cracked.  I don't see the problem with a crack, you are still going to eat it.  Try it and you will like it!  Thank you for finally getting me a recipe to us my springform pan with.

I have had a springform pan for over 18 years but never used it.  Always afraid to try a cheesecake.  I went to the LA County Fair and George Geary was there. He showed how to make a cheesecake. Came home and found your recipe and it was out of this world. My entire family raved./  I used a water bath and it did not crack. I bought George Geary's cookbook.

I have fixed many cheesecakes, but this one is absolutely the best one.  Everyone at work said this was my best effort EVER for a dessert.  The only thing I changed was I didn't put in the flour and it was extremely creamy.  VERY GOOD

This is the 2nd time I baked a cheesecake and it turned out well! Great recipe and steps are easy to follow.  I used a steam bath as well.  The cake is good to eat on its own!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  My friends are already asking for the recipe!

I have made this recipe numerous times and I always get rave reviews and many times get asked for the recipe.   Presentation is wonderful.   Twice people have thought I purchased it.  Only change I made was using graham cracker crumbs and following the recipe on the box for the crust.

This is by far the easiest and best cheesecake I have ever made.  I usually end up with a cracked and dry cake and this was unbelievably the creamiest.  I used a chocolate cookie crust and topped it with a layer of chocolate genache.  Absolutely sinful.

Very good recipe that tastes like authentic new york cheese cake.  The changes that I made were:
- added cinnamon and sugar to crust as recommended.
- baked crust for 10 minutes to set before adding filling.
- combined eggs, milk, vanilla before adding as one mixture.
- used water bath method and greased entire pan.

I think that I blended the filling too much as the cake is very light and airy on the tongue instead of that stick-to-your-mouth density.

Oh well, it was so tasty that I am sure there will be a round 2 to fix what may have gone wrong!!

After reviewing I realized that I did not add the flour!  DOAH!

We made this using chocolate grahams, and cut the sugar in half. Perfect texture, wonderful flavor, and baby, did it ever crack, even with a pan of water in the oven. I happen to believe that the cracks are a design feature.

This didn't crack at all on me, I didn't overbeat and I cooked in a water-bath. It was excellent, really creamy. I did add way more biscuit crust though, just a personal thing. But 5 stars, making it instead of a cake for my cousins birthday!

I wasn't impressed with the texture of this cheesecake and it didn't hold its shape when cut.  Tasted good but looked terrible.

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake and it came out great!  My husband said it is the best he's ever had.  I followed the directions exactly and used the advice of some other reviewers and used a water bath.  I agree with previous reviews in that it is very important to make sure your ingredients reach room temperature before you mix them.  This is the only recipe I will use to make cheesecake.  It was delicious!

Delicious and dense. I lined the pan with parchment paper and baked it in water bath. This is my first time baking cheesecake and it came out nice, no crack.

Very good.  Made a bit more of the crust.  Put a tray under the cake to cook & use less butter; it melter & covered the bottom of the oven.  Followed directions but cake cracked though.  Used spreadable cream cheese - may have been the reson.  Need better topping recipe.

I love baked cheesecake, but have always stuck to making the fridge type and buying the baked type in a coffee shop. Discovering this recipe was one of the best things! Thank you for a new winning recipe in our lives.

Made this for my fil's birthday and everyone loved it!  I did only use 2 eggs, and 2 Tbsp. of flour and it was dense, but still creamy and yummy!  Definitely a keeper in my box.

This cheesecake is fabulous!  My family said it was better than store bought or from a restaurant!!!  I made sure to have my ingredients at room temperature.  I didn't have time to leave it in the oven for as long as the recipe calls for, so after cooking I took it out of the oven after an hour and a half and let it cool completely on the counter before putting it in the fridge overnight.  Excellent!!!!

Mine did crack even though I left in the oven for 5 hours...but this gets five stars because it was so delicious it didn't even matter!  Plus I decorated it all up with strawberries and whip cream so you couldn't even see the cracks.  Great recipe!!

Absolutely incredible...I have now made this cheesecake five times according to the directions and it hs come out perfect each and every time. No changes are necessary if you follow the directions to a "T". i think the biggest mistake made is over-mixing. Stay away from that and you will be nothing but pleased. Thanks for the recipe.

omg this cheesecake was absolutely delicious. i had never made cheesecake before and was afraid to try it because it seemed like alot could go wrong. I only had a tiny crack on the top and i covered that up with the supreme strawberry topping from this website. You definently need to grease the sides very well in order for it to not crack. i would also improove the crust a little by adding 1 tbs of white sugar and a little bit more butter. Also, i would recommend using cinnamon graham crackers instead of honey graham crackers. Or if you're using honey graham crackers, then add a little bit of cinnamon. Overall this is a great cheesecake recipe and i will definently make again even though it does require alot of time.

Wow, this cake is awesomeeeee. I'm happy since even though I used lesser cream cheese/sugar by mistake, it still turned out perfect :D No cracks!!! But idk if it would matter but I reduced the eggs from 4 to 3 to reduce the cholestrole levels a little. Def. making again

The flavor of this was great in the center, but the edges got quite dry...  I did exactly as the recipe said (left in oven 6 hours) but still got huge cracks.  I think I will actually put in in a water bath instead of having a pan below and have it cook a little less time to account for the oven staying very hot even after turning it off over the 6 hour stay.  Great flavor, just not quite perfect all the way through.

It tastes really good, It really does...the only think is that mines cracked and sank and it was a little bit dry on the edges but the rest was creamy and yummy...I followed the recipe as it says...I think I would use another pan instead of the 9" springform one next time or make it on water bath. It looks like's underdone but once chilled it gets the right consistency .

I am new to cooking and found this recipe easy to make.  My only mistake was that I mixed it until it was very smooth. I beleive that is why it did cracked. However I did get rave reviews from everyone that tried it.  It is now a requirement that when I should up for picninc, graduations, etc, that I bring this cheesecake.

So yummy and creamy! I took the advice of having everything at room temperature and baked in a 1" water bath for 1 hour and then turned off the oven and let it sit in there for 5 hours before chilling. Topped it with fresh blackberries and got compliments from everyone! Will definitely make this again.

Yuck.

Followed the directions exactly and man was it gross.

It has a chunky texture, and the top has an eggy skin on the top.

I've made cheesecake before and this was not good. I wasted $8 worth of ingredients.

I did this recipe and found that the chease cake's crust was burnt and the cake was kind of dense. Later I retryed the recipe but turned the heat down 25 degrees and while i was mixing the stuff i put some fresh strawberries in the blender and then put the strawberry "juice" in the mix then made the cake, this one was alot better.

This was delicious!  I followed the suggestions for using the water bath and letting the cheesecake cool without opening the door and my cheesecake did not crack!  I served it with raspberry pie topping and everyone loved it!

AMAZING!  I've tried a few different recipes and all have failed.  I gave up on trying to bake cheesecake for 4 YEARS.  Today I tried this recipe, and I have to say, my faith in being able to make a perfect cheesecake at home has been renewed.  Very creamy, not too sweet, perfect alone or with any topping.  I made a blackberry drizzle for mine and it's to die for.  :)

Overall this is a very good recipe. However, I did not find the cheesecake to be dense enough. Like many other reviews, I too had to add more butter to the crust that stated in the recipe. This is a cheesecake that I will be making again in the future.

Just ok for me...not a real New York cheesecake, but a reasonable substitute, especially because it's so easy to throw together. The taste is a bit bland, and the texture a little to "eggy" and spongy. I would definitely try it again, maybe with egg yolks instead of whole eggs...no flour...maybe adding some lemon zest to punch it up a notch. Needs at least 24 hours in the fridge to settle and firm up. Oh, and mine cracked.

Have not made many cheesecakes in the past and I followed the directions to a tee.   It turned out perfectly, did not crack, and the texture was absolutely amazing!  I plan to make this my staple cheesecake recipe from now on.

This was my first time baking a cheesecake, and it turned out FANTASTIC! I did alter the crust recipe as others have done, but I followed the rest of the recipe and baking instructions spot on. My husband said this wasn't good, but GREAT!!! We both love The Cheesecake Factory and this cheesecake is almost just as good (plain, anyhow). Mine did not have any cracks down the center,but did crack about 1" from the edge all the way around. The consistency was perfect and pretty dense considering several people have said it is fluffy and not dense enough. All around, it's a fantastic cheesecake that I will continue to use from here on out! Next time, I will try adding melted chocolate chips to the batter!!!

The recipe for the cheesecake filling is excellent -- pretty simple to get through, and tastes amazing.  However, the crust is pretty rough -- there is not enough butter to the crust (5 tbsp melted butter is probably closer to the actual amount needed) and the number of graham crackers used needs to get cut back.

This cheesecake tastes fantastic.  Mine cracked, but I chalk that up to my inexperience.  I still give it five stars because everyone loved the flavor, and it tasted as good several days later as it did the first day we ate it.  Of course, we gained five pounds that week.  Definitely not something I can make and have around all the time.

This was my first attempt at cheesecake.  It turned out excellent.  I also did the water bath with two layers of foil around the bottom of the pan for protection.  I made a ganache and served with Fresh strawberries.. Very good!

I did not use a water bath, and my cheesecakes did not crack.  I was surprised by the large amount this recipe produced.  I ended up filling three 9-inch pie pans.  Next time, I'll use a springform pan.  But the taste and texture of the cheesecake was excellent!

This is THE cheesecake recipe.  I made sure not to over beat.  In fact I only used a mixer to cream the creamcheese and sugar together.  I did the rest by hand.  I banged it on the counter a few times and made sure to leave it alone in the over for the whole 5 hours (I had to leave just to resist).  The result was a stunning cheesecake!  Make sure you give these at least over night to sit in the fridge.  I left it for 2 days and it was absolutly fab!  My husband said it liked it better than the cheesecake factory's!

this was really good. I made it exactly. Top came out a bit brown. Mine did not crack. My husband loves plain cheesecake. I thought it could use chocolate or fruit topping as it was a bit bland. If I make it to serve plain again, I think I'll add more sugar and vanilla.

I made this recipe for my 2nd daughter's high school graduation.  I found the recipe easy to follow and bake.  The cake was gone in 15 minutes and I have had my children begging to make it again.  I made sure to wrap the bottom in foil to prevent water seepage, put it in a pan of hot water for baking and then afterwards left in the oven for 6 hours (without peeking).  I refrigerated it and served it with fresh strawberries.  It was by far the best cheesecake I have ever made and this is the recipe I will use from now on.

This was my first attempt at a "real" cheesecake and it turned out absolutely beautiful! I had graham cracker crumbs on hand already, so used 1 1/2 C. of those and 3 Tbsp of butter for the crust.  Other than that, followed the recipe to the "T", including leaving it in the oven with the door shut for 5-6 hrs, and it's beautifully smooth and uncracked.  Great recipe!!

My first cheesecake and it was easy to bake, Only thing I think that needs to be changed or upgraded was 1 or 2 more gram crackers and 1 more tbsp of butter, also a topping is a must unless you like it plain, I choped up strawberries and sprinkled sugar on them though them in the fridge to let it sit for 3 hours so it can release some of its juices, then I topped the cheesecake when it was ready with the strawberries and I sprinkled some powder sugar on top to finish it. Cooking time was spot on, mine turned out a lightly goldne brown and the middle was perfect.

5 stars! One of my top 5 favorite cheesecakes ive tasted all time!

I was much easier than I expected.  I made it for my boyfriend who knows good food.  I didnt have time to leave it in the oven for 6 hrs.  But it was good.  We put it in the fridge and the next morning it was so much better.  Next time I will be sure to run the knife around the edge after baking close the oven, turn it off leave it for the full 6 hrs then refridgerate ovenight.  Then it will be sure to be great.  After it sat in the fridge my bf said it was as good as one of the upscale restaurants he frequents.  High praise!  I look forward to making this again and again.

This is truly the easiest and best tasting cheesecake out there.  I have only tried to make a cheesecake one other time and it was a complete disaster.  Thanks to the earlier reviewers that said not to overbeat, to put it in the oven and forget it, and the water bath.  If you use these tips this is no fail.  I used 1 1/2 cups of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips added to the batter and made it a chocolate cheesecake and it was marvelous.  I have so far made this recipe four times in the last two weeks and used it as end of the year gifts for my childrens' teachers.  Thank you for great recipe.

OMG!!! This was so good. I reduced it to make 3/4 as much and baked it in an 8" springform. It was so good. I used reduced fat sour cream and cream cheese.

This cheesecake is wonderful!!  My mom-in-law makes a cheese torte every Christmas and my husband says this cheesecake may even be better.  What a HUGE compliment.  This was the first time I have made homemade cheesecake, time consuming but worth it.  The only thing I found was that you do need to add a lot more butter to the graham crackers to make the crust stick together.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is AMAZING! We had friends over to share the first one I made. They were raving over this. A friend even said it was "Better than the cheesecake factory!" My husband is from NYC and he said it's "very  close". ;) I'm saving this one and will make it again for Father's Day! I can't thank you enough for posting this. :)

The ONLY reason that I don't give this recipe the full five stars is because of the crust portion.  Two tablespoons of butter is not nearly enough for fifteen graham crackers; I had crumbs flaking off like crazy, making for a very messy dessert.  Other than that, the cheesecake is awesome!  Mine did NOT crack after following the recipe to a "t." :-)

I'm sure this is a great recipe. I am an experienced cook/baker BUT I have not made a lot of cheesecakes. Mine turned out with the crust too dark for my liking and it "cracked" and not a creamy consistency. Definetely read reviews for helpful tips. I think they are important to follow. I think I will stick to the mini cheesecake recipe on this site. They turned out GREAT!

I've never made a cheesecake before. I don't even like cheesecake that much but this one is really good. (made it for my husband's birthday)  I didn't have a springform pan, so I just bought the ready made pie crust.  1 is not enough!  I had a ton of batter leftover and had to run to the store and buy another.  I did use a pan of water under the cakes as suggested and followed the directions for the rest. Left it in the oven for about 4 hrs. after I turned it off. Both came out perfect.  Next time I will invest in a springform pan I think.

This was so delicious and easy to make!  Cooking it in a water bath definatly makes a huge difference.  The first time I made this it was good but there were big cracks in the middle and the edges were brown while the center was still white.  This time I used the water bath and left it in the oven the full five hours.  The top is an amazing golden brown and there are no cracks or imperfections at all.

This cheesecake is the best! I get rave reviews everytime I cook it. Last time I used strawberry syrup on top to give it a elegant look before I baked it. Then I garnished it with real strawberries and left over graham craker crumbs. It was wonderful!

This cheese cake tasted very good and came out looking perfect but was a bit undercooked for my liking.  Next time I will cook it a little longer and it will be perfect.

This was my first time making a "real" cheesecake.  My husband and I thought it was very, very good.  It has a semi~firm, yet smooth and creamy texture, which is what I was hoping for.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I would ever possibly alter is to occasionally serve it w/ a fruit topping when the fancy strikes me.

I was expecting something fabulous after all the reviews... but my husband and daugther did not like this (I don't eat cheesecake)and they usually love cheesecake!   Mabye there is a difference in traditional cheesecake and New York cheesecake, but my family thought this had a "wang" to it.  Sorry.

I've made this twice...both times people said it was the best cheesecake they'd ever tasted!  I wish I'd made notes to myself about the first time I made it because it seems like it came out looking more perfect, but both times it tasted great.

PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT!!! Took the advice of others and used 1 1/2 cups crumbs and 1/4 cup butter for crust. Mixed cream cheese and sugar only until smooth, baked at 350 degrees F for 60 minutes with a pyrex dish of water on bottom rack. Let it cool in the oven for 2 hours, used a knife to seperate the edges from the pan, then transferred to the fridge. No cracks, perfect texture! I used a smaller spring form pan so there was leftover batter. Next time I'll use a larger pan.

If I could give it more stars I would. I grew up on Juniors cheesecake in NYC, but since moving to the midwest I found this recipe and will say it just might beat out my childhood memories. I do make my crust different as this one is kinda blah

Well, I certainly had a time trying to make this (it was my first time)!  Make sure that you have the right sized pan, or you will have a mess on your hands.  Even with my mishap, I ended up with a great tasting cheesecake.  Will certainly be making again.

This was good.  I don't think i mixed it good enough or maybe the cream cheese was not warm enough because the texture was a bit off and lumpy.  One side got a little brown but I hid that with topping.  It did not crack and I was very pleased with that.

Great recipe. Made sure that the cream cheese was at room temperature and was careful to not over beat. Cooked it bain marie style at 350* for one hour and left it until morning to cool. It looked a bit custard-y so I baked it at 325* for another half hour and proceeded to let it cool to firm it up. No cracks. Covered it in a chocolate ganache from this site like another user, and it turned out looking professional!

Excellent!  I made it made with fat free cream cheese and lowfat sour cream...still tasted great.  I did't have a springform pan so I divided it between 2 ready made pie crusts.  Baked it for 30-40 min.

This cheesecake is fantastic! The first time I made it, it turned out kind of grainy, but I found out it might have had to do with the eggs not being at room temperature. This time I made sure the creamcheese was smooth before I started mixing other ingredients, while I put the eggs in last (I found the other ingredients have similar texture). I also started using a whisk at that point to avoid over-stirring. I then baked the cake at 325 degrees because my oven seems to heat up a little more. The only thing I didn't do too well was greasing the borders of the pan, so the cake slightly stuck to the sides and cracked a little. (lesson learned :-)). My husband says this is the best cheesecake he's ever had and loves to eat it even without topping :-) . Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This cheesecake is incredible! My brother went crazy and ate half the cake in one sitting! I followed the recipe exactly except I only left it in the oven for two hours after baking, and still no cracks! It's really simple if you follow the directions and tastes as great as any restaurant cheesecake!

I had to make this cheesecake after all the great reviews.  I didnt like the texture it was, a little too fluffy.  I guess maybe I overwhipped it.  But the taste was good, and all the party guests seemed to like it.

Excellent cheesecake. It is surprisingly light but very decadent. I followed the instructions to keep the oven closed for 5 hours and the cake didn't crack at all. I will definately make again!

Good cheescake.  I lost my tried and true recipe that my husband raved about.  
I will have lots of fun coming up with variations and toppings for this recipe!
I did get a bit impatient and took it out of the oven at 2 hours versus the recommended time, therefore it wasn't as firm as we normally like, but no cracks at ALL.  Not to mention it was perfect color-wise(No browning), and it came out of the springform with no resistance.
Definitely worth giving a shot.

Wow!  This is a super easy recipe.  This is the first time I've ever made cheesecake. It's so good, I'm making my third one right now, because so many people want some!  I followed the advice offered by allrecipes and found it most helpful.  I used a water bath and upped the cooking time a bit, and PRESTO a perfect decadent cheesecake!

Didn't crack but was very thick and solid and CHEESY.  Texture was undesirable and taste unappealing to not just me but to the guests I served..one of whom considers herself a "New York" style cheesecake aficiando.  Being from NJ myself I guess I like any style but not this one... thanks anyway.

This was a very good cheesecake.  I received many compliments on it.  I wouldn't say its the very best cheesecake I've tasted, but definately worth the five star rating. I'll make it again, maybe next time jazzing it up with oreos or peanut butter cups.

Hands down it is the best cheesecake on the site. Just stunning visually and so good. I couldn't make it as much as I would like (It is a bit costly) but when I can it gets many raves. I don't change anything about it and it didnt crack. You must be very careful and make sure not to open the oven at any time. You must be careful with a cheesecake. Baking/desserts in general are very specific and you have to make sure everything is done right. It's an art really. Anyway my husband loves this cheesecake and recently asked me to bake it again. When he asks for cheesecake this is the one I do. Far from wimpy, heavy as can be, which is not a bad thing, fluffy (the weight not the taste) and just so rich and good. 

I top my with raspberries (canned glaze and then a few fresh ones on top)

Perfection

Great cheese cake-followed other reviewers instructions to have ingrediants at room temp, not to overbeat...etc.  Put a pan of hot water under it when baking. Took out after 3hrs, came out perfect-no cracks.  We used blackberry pie filling for a topping, very good.  This is a very large(tall) cheese cake, and a small sliver was almost too much.  Next time I will 1/2 this recipe and put it  the same size pan.

A good cheesecake, just had a different texture than what I'm used to. Was a little less dense, almost a 'fluffy' texture.  Very smooth; and taste was great.

When the other reviewers say you can't mess this up- they are right. I set mine in a water bath, let it sit in the oven for 2 hours after baking, and it turned out perfect.  I've never made such a thick cheesecake that wasn't undercooked in the middle, or cracked before, but this recipe seemed to be the magic key to a great tasting, and picture perfect cheesecake.  The only change I made was to add some lemon juice to the batter.  Next time I think I might also omit the flour to get more of a creamy texture.  Will make again!

Crust didn't turn out correctly, but that's okay.  It was still tasty.  This is the real deal.  I'm thinking it would be good to make the filling, bake it, chill it, then roll it in the graham crackers so they are yummy little bites.  That would be especially delish.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic. I made this cheesecake for Easter, and it was gone in a matter of two hours. My uncle actually ran upstairs to tell me how great it was. I am definitely not a cook, but I feel like one now! I will definitely make this over and over. I did follow others reviewers advice on making the crust with added sugar and a cinnamon. A+ recipe!

I just recently made this recipe for Easter. I'm 17 and I would call myself a good cook/baker so i like to try new recipes and see how they turn out and just like the other reviews implied this cheesecake was great. It had a nice creamy texture and a very nice flavor. Its a fairly simple recipe. I tweaked it a lil and put the batter in a pre-made gramhn cracker crust because i dont have a springform pan and i let it cool for 2 hours instead of 6. It didn't have any cracks. This is my first time making a "plain" cheesecake from scratch and it was just excellent. I usually make a chocolate, tutle, or marbled cheesecake, but i will definatly make this again. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

I think this is a wonderful recipe.  This was my first time ever making a cheesecake, and I followed the recipe as exactly as I could.  My cheesecake did crack a bit, but I think it was because I couldn't help myself from opening the oven door to peek.  Anyway, the flavor and texture were heavenly.  My whole family wants this again soon!

It seems like gilding the lily to pile yet more praise on this one but I will anyway.  I made the recipe as written except for using cinnamon graham crackers for the crust and adding the grated zest of 1/2 a lemon (I like the little bit of brightness it adds).  I put a pan of water below and it turned out beautifully - no cracks, just a hint of golden brown around the outside of the top, and no sinking.  A+ work, Chantal - thanks for this one!

I have made several cheesecakes and not one of them has ever turned out as well as this recipe did.  I followed the directions exactly as written. I used the waterbath, wrapped the bottom in foil, and when it was done cooking I turned the oven off I left it in there overnight to cool. I have never heard of doing this before and it turned out to be the secret to a beautiful perfect looking cheesecake. Not one Crack!! I also substituted the Bailey's Irish Cream for the milk. The Baileys was a great idea!! It gave it an amazing bite, great flavor. ,My guests couldn't stop talking about it. This recipe is a keeper!!!

This recipe is NO JOKE !! Simply one of the best that I have made or eaten. It was beautiful, no cracks. I kept pretty true to the recipe, I added the zest of 1 lemon, and the juice from half of the lemon. I used a waterbath as per the advice of many, and it really turned out picture perfect. It was cut into before I had the chance to photograph it, but that's okay, this is the first of many cheesecakes I will make from this recipe.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  LOVE this recipe!  I try alot of recipes from this web site, and although most are very good, I don't take the time to actually rate them.  But with this one, I made sure to add my 5 stars to the growing number of rave reviews.  The taste is sooo good, but following the helpful hits written by others ensures a beautiful appearance, as well.

Delicious! Left to cool over night in the oven. Topped with the Strawberry topping from this website. Seems like a lot of work, but it is actually pretty simple.

I made this cake the night before my bday dinner party. Considering this was the first time I ever made a cheesecake it tunred out excellent. I followed the directions exactly only I also put it in a water bath in the oven for an hour then turned the oven off and left it overnight in there (I went to bed at midnight. It was perfectly baked and had a nice consitency. The top was not nicley browned however, which was ok since I spead Strawberry preserves on top. My guests loved it and so did I. This is a keeper. One tip is to really have all your ingredients at room temperature. Especially the cream cheese. I had small bits of cream cheese that did not mix well because it was too cold.

This recipe is sooooo easy! I am terrible at baking. (I am always burning this or undercooking etc.) If you follow this recipe there is NO WAY you can screw it up! I cut the recipe in half and used a 6 inch springform pan and it was awesome! I used canned raspberry pie filling and topped it ff with that.YUM!

Very good cheesecake. Family and friends loved it. This was my first cheesecake, so I'm happy it was eaten very quickly. I did have two cracks on top- but that was because I blended everything due to not re-reading the instructions saying to mix the remaining ingredients. I will continue to make it until it's perfected. I think I will try a water bath or turn off the oven sooner next time. Overall, good cheesecake.

I made this cheesecake for my party and everyone raved--it is awesome!  My cheesecake cracked but I didn't let it cool at an even pace so that was my fault--I was in a hurry to serve it.  Definitely deserves 5 stars!

Excellent Recipe. I've never made cheesecake before today and it was so easy. My cheesecake did happen to fall and crack though I didn't use any of the prevention methods. But I topped it with a strawberry topping found on the site and it looked and tasted magical.

Chantal, you have given me a gem!!!  I love this cheesecake.  The basic recipe is excellent for all of your variations and additions.  Beautiful in appearance and delicious, too.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and 'light' sour cream with this recipe and it turned out just as creamy as the full fat.  A girlfriend said, "this tastes restaurant bought".  I did use a waterbath, cooked for 1 hour and then cooled in the oven for 6hours (overnight).  I had a small crack in the center, but it gave it character.  My husband said it was ALMOST too pretty to eat.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best cheesecake recipe I've ever tried, and I won't try another one again.  It's absolutely perfect.

I make the crust with 12 graham crackers instead of 15, and with a teaspoon of cinnamon.  Also - this cheesecake will not crack if your ingredients are at room temperature when you begin, you place your springform pan (wrapped in foil) in a waterbath, and let it sit for several hours (4-6) before you take it out of the oven.  Just turn the oven off and forget about it, and then put your cheesecake in the fridge to chill.  This is perfect for company, birthdays, to bring to dinner parties, etc!  Just wonderful.

I have always considered myself a great cheesecake baker.  This recipe, however, has blown mine out of the water.  It is the best basis recipe there is.  You can use this recipe to customize and create all types of wonderful desserts.  My favorite, though, is plain. If you have a few extra dollars, invest in madagascar vanilla beans to scrape into the batter.

As others have said, it almost seems moot to put in another 5 star rating on this recipe, but it was just fantastic. I made it for a wedding shower, and it disappeared  quickly and with rave reviews. I followed the instructions exactly, and left it in the oven overnight...no cracks! The only thing that seemed to go wrong was it had some "air bubbles" in it...but I think that was from me not quite mixing enough, as I was afraid of over mixing and cracking. SO GREAT, SO EASY!

Easy, Delicious, I say absolutely wonderful!! 

I make 12-14 cheesecakes to sell at a local rodeo (By the slice) and this one is the best recipe I have EVER had!!  I was out of milk so I used half and half and OMG, this one is SO VERY CREAMY!  I used with the flavors I make (Raspberry Ribbon, Chocolate swirl, key lie etc) and it worked with everything I added to it.  Thank you Chantal!!

This is a very good, very easy recipe!  I didn't have the sour cream, so I had to subsitute.  I took lowfat Cottage Cheese and pureed it, then added it instead of the sour cream.  Worked like a charm.  A tip for perfect cheesecake... line bottom of spring form pan with aluminum foil, put pan in a bigger pan, like a roasting pan, and fill the outside of the spring form pan with hot water, so cheesecake will cook evenly.

Amazing!  Used cinnamon graham crackers for crust, which was very delicious.  My cheesecake cracked in a giant X, but I think it was my fault for overmixing.  Taste and texture were perfect.  This is my official cheesecake recipe.

My family is crazy about cheesecakes so every get together I need to make one.  I have to say that this was one of the best.  I did bake it in a water bath and added chocolate chips because my daughter requested it.  I will be using this as a base recipe and adding different flavors to it.  It's delicious.

The best New York style cheesecake we've ever had.  We actually used leftover homemade cranberry sauce once for the topping and it was awesome.

This cheesecake tastes a bit different than traditional cheesecake. It is more cake like in texture. It has a very good taste but I am not sure if it is worth the "oven time". Mine did have a deep crack in it but it wasn't noticable once it was cut.

it almost feels redundant to add yet another five star rating to this cheesecake....but it's really good! it's a bit 'lighter' than other cheesecakes (my guess would be the milk?); it's got a very soft, creamy texture rather than the typical dense, moist 'crumb' of your average cheesecake. truth be told, i don't necessarily prefer this one, but it's certainly delicious! to fill a friend's request, i made it with a chocolate crumb crust, and added caramel, chocolate chips and pecans. using a bain marie, the cake neither browned nor cracked. a recipe worth keeping. :-)

I made this receipe and it was a big hit.  However, it did crack and Im sure it was due to over beating since my daughter helped. I added chocolate chips to top before cooking.

The taste is incredible, but this is the 2nd time I've made this recipe and had huge cracks in the center and browned on the edges. 
I want it to look as good as it tastes.
I followed the recipe exactly and was careful not to over stir.
Not sure what I'm doing wrong or why so many others have had such success with no cracking. Great taste, though!

This cheesecake is easily worth 5 stars. Outrageously good!!! Nothing but rave reviews from everyone. I increased the butter to 4T for the crust, and used a water bath.  It came out perfectly.  I will most definitely make this again!

This recipe utterly and completely deserves the five stars! The only change we made was to very slightly decrease the sugar and to do an oreo crust in place of the graham cracker one. I gave our neighbor a piece, and she was surprised I had made it; she was sure it was from a high-end bakery! =)

Outstanding! I used whipped butter, which made mixing easier, even though I don't think it's meant for baking. It gave the cheesecake a very light texture. Mine cracked, but it was b/c I stuck it in the freezer to cool -- it was just for family, so didn't need to be pretty, just taste good. It was excellent with blueberry topping, but I suggest keeping it on the side for those who are blueberry purists. This is a cheesecake lover's cheesecake!

This was my second attempt at a cheesecake and my first using this recipe. It turned out great. It was so rich and creamy. I put a pan of water underneath the cheesecake while it was cooking and it only had one slight crack after it was done. I did use another recipe for the crust because I like graham cracker crusts. There was definetely a lot of filling and I was worried about it cooking over the edge, but it just baked up smooth and beautiful. We just topped this with caramel sauce and it was divine. Thanks for a great recipe. This is going into my keep pile.

Fabulous!  The only changes I made to the ingredients were:  made a graham cracker crust from the recipe off the Honey Maid box and reduced the flour to 3 Tbsp.  I sprayed the sides and bottom of 9 inch springform pan very well and the crust came off the sides without any problems.  I baked the cheesecake in a water bath after placing the springform pan in a baking bag (didn't use foil).  I preheated the oven to 350 and when I put the cheesecake in I reduced the temp to 325.  Baked it one hour and about 15 minutes and then reduced the temp to 250 and baked it about 35 min more.  Then I turned the oven off and let the cheesecake cool in the oven (without opening the door) for about 3 hours.  I was worried during this time because the cheesecake wasn't brown on top and looked undone, though it did not jiggle in the middle at all.  After 3 hours, I took it out and ran a knife around the edges (the edges were already basically pulled away from the sides of the pan) and opened the spring form pan.  Beautiful with no cracks.  Topped it with crushed Reeses mini pb cups and  a peanut butter glaze.  Refigerated it overnite and have been enjoying it all day long!  Try this recipe, I think it is the best on this site.  Will be making another one tonight to give as a gift.

I made this for Cristmas and everyone thought this was excellant except my daughter and me. We were dissappointed in it. It wasn't as creamy as I thought it would be. I didn't know whether to use 15 whole graham crackers or halves so I used 15 whole ones and it seemed to be too much for my pan. I have made much better cheese cakes than this one. I doubt if I'll be making it again even though my husband loved it.

This was my first attempt at Cheesecake and it got great reviews.  This was so much easier than I thought and it was the best tasty cheesecake I've ever had.  I followed all the "rules" I read in the reviews....used a warm water bath, left it in the oven for 4 hours, etc.  No cracks, no sinking.

WOW..what a great cheesecake! I followed the directions exactly with the exception of subbing out the van. for 1/4 t. of lemon extract and the zest of 1/2 a lemon. The flavor was out-of-this-world. My son and hubby thought it was the BEST...and they know their cheesecake:). Thank you for this recipe.

I would actually rate this recipe as a two stars one. As a first-time baker, this recipe has a highest rating and seems easy to bake. Therefore, i choose this. But when the cake was done with baking, it was too cheesy, and the cream cheese doesn't appeal to my taste. I would recommend this recipe to those who love cream cheese a lot. I use oreo as my topping as it is easier to get hold of.

I just rechecked the recipe and it calls for 4 8 ounce packages of cream cheese. I misread this and had used only one and it was still awesome. Im actually concerned of adding so much more next time I make it but I suppose the reviews are great, Ill try it.

This is my first time making this type of cheesecake. Not that hassle actually. Can't get any sour cream & graham crackers here, so I replaced them with plain yogurt & Digestive cookies & they turn out to be so delicious, much more better than our bakery here.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year.  Everyone LOVED it!!  My only complaint was that it got a little darker on top than I had hoped for.  I just added a cherry topping on it and nobody could tell.  I don't think you'll find a better cheesecake recipe than this one, DELICIOUS!!

I have never made a cheesecake before in my life! I have made this one 3 times in 2 weeks and I still have only had one peice myself! I did read the other reviews and used a water bath while baking, was perfect everytime! And to be honest I am the biggest cheesecake nut on the planet and I have not had one that tastes better than this one!

This cheesecake turned out wonderfully.  As my first shot at this recipes I didn't change a thing - just added cherry topping - everyone loved it.  Only bad part is that there were no leftovers for me!  I will definitely use this as the base for many cheesecakes to come.  P.S.  I only have an 8 inch spring form pan, which makes it pretty deep so I baked it a little longer then let cool in the oven for 5 hours and it was perfect.

Very good cheesecake.  The first time I made it, it cracked.  The second time I made it,I made the following changes: I sprayed the sides of the springform pan with Pam and only used a mixer for the cream cheese and then mixed in everything else by hand.  It came out perfect - no cracks!!

I just made my very first cheesecake ever and I used this recipe. OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!! The only thing I did differently was to bake in a water bath and was careful not to overbeat. It was perfect. Thank you for such a great recipe.

I finally found my cheesecake recipe. It was delicious and my husband loved it too. It came out PERFECT, medium brown color on top and no cracks at all. I followed the recipe exactly and baked it in a water bath. For everyone that gave this recipe a low rating, you must have done something wrong. I also used a blueberry sauce recipe from this site that was a wonderful addition. Thanks for sharing!

Yet, one more review that will say that this recipe was AWESOME! Though my cheesecake cracked a bit, it didn't make the taste any less than AWESOME!

Reading the reviews, I noted that most of the complaints were about lack of flavor so I added the zest of 1 lemon and 1/4 teaspoon lemon extract.  The flavor and texture were wonderful.

I made this using the suggested tips of having my ingredients at room temp and putting the pan in a water bath.  At 50 minutes, I ran a knife around the edge of the pan and closed the oven.  At 60 minutes I turned off the oven and left the cheesecake in for 3 hours.  When I checked on it, it was gorgeous!  I left it on the counter for another hour before refrigerating.  No cracks.

Will make this again and again.

I made this twice...the first time it cracked because I didn't have all ingredients at room temp. My husband still loved it though! The second time I had everything at room temp and it didn't crack! Great recipe and also it's easy! Thanx!

I will never need another New York Cheesecake recipe again, this one was perfect.  I was worried about using a water bath and leaving the cheesecake in the oven for so long, but it didn't crack, turned out beautifully.  Couldn't buy a better tasting cheesecake.

The perfect cheesecake. Scrumptious on its own or with a topping. I followed the recipe and didn't have any cracking.
I did lightly grease the side of the pan, as one of the reviews
suggested.  I also made sure all the ingredients were at room temperature.

This was the first cheesecake I ever made and it was so easy and so good. I left it in the oven as the recipe said for 6 hours until it completely cooled then put it in the fridge for another 5 hours until I served it. My hubby LOVED it and now I will make it again for the holidays. 
Thank you for the recipe!

i hate to be so harsh, i dont know it did not taste like anything, it was very bland, it was not a stand alone cheesecake meaning i dont need anything on top.  I added strawberries and hubby loved it, it was good just not great to me.

This cheesecake is amazing! I followed the directions to the T, and it came out perfect.  I was so skeptical to turn the oven off after 1 hr becuase it didn't look done, but after it chilled, it was PERFECT.  The flavor and consistency are dead on.  Thanks so much!

This truly is the perfect cheesecake recipe.  I subbed Bailey's for milk and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips over the crust and 1/2 cup chips on top of the cake.  I used a waterbath and would strongly recommend adding more butter to the crust.  I used a stick.  The crumbs don't hold together without all that buttery goodness.  I will never EVER trust another cheesecake recipe.  This is THE BEST.

Okay, this was my first cheesecake that didn’t come from a box that said “Jell-O No Bake”, and I did surprisingly well! I did make mistakes though... so you can sort of redeem yourself. Well I followed other suggestions and made sure everything was room temperature … I forgot about the bowl though (its metal- and it was ice cold)... and I started getting lumps almost immediately. But I figured I might as well keep going and I followed all the other suggestions regarding mixing with a wooden spoon instead of an electric mixer and the water bath suggestion. It came out beautiful, no cracks, a little browning around the edges, but great!! It tastes fantastic too, the texture isn’t totally what it should be, but it’s forgivable because it tastes great! So for the moral of my story, if you get lumps, just keep going … it will probably turn out very tasty!! Thanks for the recipe, next time it will be even better:)

Wonderful tasting cheesecake.  Mine did crack, but my ingredients were cold and I think I might have over-mixed it a bit.  Still, it had a great texture and a wonderful, pure cheesecakey taste!  My husband raved about it, too.

I don't consider myself the best of cooks, so when I recently hosted a dinner party I was worried that my Italian friend (who had grown up cooking) would upstage me. However, this Cheesecake emerged from the fridge almost like a mirage! I was utterly amazed at the result: it tasted fabulous and looked restaurant quality! I topped with jelly and fresh fruit to add a bit more flavour. Definite 5 stars!

This was better than your average store bought cheesecake, but not as great as Cheesecake Factory.  I didn't have cracks in it and followed the recipe exactly with a water bath.  It's the first time I've tried baking a cheesecake and my husband LOVED it more than Cheesecake Factory's!

This was a good recipe because I had all the ingredients... well, I guess I had to buy more cream cheese, but the sour cream was on hand.  This one didn't taste as good as the one's with the heavy cream though.  My extended family of 12 enjoyed the other one better... they said this one was too thick and more crumbly than the Supreme Cheesecake.

Family loved it - me, not so much.  I thought it tasted egg-y.  I followed the directions to not have it crack and that worked wonderfully.  The cheesecake looked beautiful.  It just seemed to lack...some kind of zip or tang.

Perfect!  I can't say too much more that the others didn't say, but I can add that I didn't have enough cream cheese and had to use the conversion tool to scale the recipe down and it worked perfectly!  When I had a finished cheesecake, I drizzled chocolate and caramel over the top.  Thank you for a very good recipe!

This is absolutely the best cheesecake EVER!  It produces a very moist and very delicious result.  I use this as my base recipe for almost every cheesecake I make.  Just adding different toppings and varying the crust allows you to make almost any variety you wish.  Hands down, this is the only cheesecake recipe you will ever need.

Maybe it's because I used whole wheat flour with this recipe ( I know, I know- I was out of a.p.)- but I did not care for this cheese cake!

I'm a cheesecake lover, although it's one thing I never attempted to make until recently. I purchased a spring form pan, reviewed recipes on this site and chose this one. I've had no trouble producing a crack free, lovely  textured cheesecake. I made a pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving using this recipe base, and it was wonderful. Lots of compliments! I did follow advice from other reviews in regards to using a water bath and cracking the oven door when done and leaving the cake alone for at least an hour. I would really listen to the advice in regards to using a DOUBLE foil lining for the water bath. I used only one last time and had a little leaking.Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

OMG!!! I just can't give you the thanks you deserve.  This was an absolute hit!!!  I read the reviews before and put a pan of hot water in the oven 20 mintues before use, let it sit 5 1/2 hours after cooking and had 1 very small (1/2 inch) crack in the cheesecake....so small, I shouldn't even mention it.  My family and friends LOVED this!!!  My husband said this was the best cheesecake he's EVER had.  It's all gone now, but I'm already being told to make it again.  My advice to everyone that is planning on making it is to follow the directions EXACT!!  This is definitely a keeper and will be my "dish" for the Christmas party.  Thanks so much--you've made me look like THE cheesecake maker!!! LOL

This recipe was the best I have ever tried.  I have always had problems with baking cheesecakes in springform pans but not in the regular pie shell pans.  I followed the suggestions of using a water bath and covering the outer pan with foil.  I used another crust recipe and added crushed pecans and cinnamon to the crust and prebaked it.  I baked it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I removed it from the oven after two hours, since I was going to bed.  I will definitely make this again.

I've had these spring form pans in my cabinet for at least 2 years and the week before thanksgiving I decided to make my first cheesecake. CAUTION: You will have everyone you know asking you to make this for them. I made 3 cheesecakes and took them to work for everyone to try. Remember this is the week before thanksgiving. After everyone had tried a piece, I had orders for making more for parties and family. By the time I was done, I had made a total of 12 cheesecakes in one week. This is a simple recipe to make but be prepared for orders to start rolling in. Charge at least $25 each. Happy Cooking.

Cream cheese is hard to find in the Czech Republic, and I only had 16oz to work with, so I halved the ingredients for the batter and it came out just fine. I followed other reviewers' advice and used a bain-marie when baking. It was easy to do and really did help prevent the cheesecake from cracking. After 45 minutes my cheesecake looked done, so I turned off the oven and let it sit for 2 hours (it was for Thanksgiving, so I needed the oven for other things and couldn't afford 5-6 hours), which was enough time. I took it out and put it in the fridge for a few more hours, then decorated by drizzling melted chocolate over the top. Everyone loved it!

This was my very first attempt at making cheese cake and it turned out thick and beautiful like the real thing!  I bought some raspberry pastry filling to dribble over it and it tasted wonderful.  I'm so impressed with myself I can't wait to make it again.  It was rich and delicious!  -Janene

Came out aswesome! I had NO cracks at all! After making sure everything is at room temperature, make sure you lightly mix everything in. Also, I did the water bath on the shelf below 20 minutes or so before putting in the cake. What I did was firmly run a stick of butter a few times all around the pan to make sure it was well greased!! I turned off the oven and didn't even take a peek until 5 hours later! Oh, if your ingredients aren't at room temperature, you can zap it in the microwave for a few seconds at a time and then mix; just enough to warm it closer to room temp. Anyway, It was gorgeous and perfect...not to mention delicious...I will be posting a pic ( in-Yang design).

This was my first try at making cheesecake and I'm pleased to say it turned out delicious!  Not only was it easy to make and looked great, but it tasted really good too.  Next time I will let my cream cheese become soft at room temp. before I mix all the ingredients as my batter was kind of lumpy...didn't effect the final product though.  I also topped my cheesecake with strawberry preserves which were nice since fresh berries are hard to find this time of year. Overall a wonderful recipe.  Thanks Chantal!

This is the best cheesecake ever.  Baking in a water bath and allowing to cool in the oven (door closed) for a couple hours keeps it looking perfect.  Turn off the oven when the middle is a little wobbly and it'll turn out perfect.

VERY good.  I didn't have all the time to let the ingredients come to room temp. and my cheesecake still turned out perfect.  No cracks and a perfect golden/cream color.  A little bit of water did leak through the foil from the water bath but it didn't make a difference.  I also only let it cool for an hour in the oven, and about another hour on the counter before we dug in.  :)  It was still slightly warm, but so so good!

This is hands down the best homemade cheesecake that I, and many of my friends and family memebers, have ever eaten.  Although, the recipe is marvelous as is, I am going to modify the crust with a little less graham crackers, more butter, sugar, and some crushed pecans.  The huge crack down the center wasn't all that beautiful either, but taste is way more important to me than appearance.  Others will agree once they take the first bite.

This was awesome!!!  Never buying cheesecake again.  I did add cinnamon and sugar to the crust.  Also followed other reviewers advice and did not bake it until set but turned off the oven after 1 hour and forgot about it.  No cracking.  Just a beautiful and delicious cheesecake.

I made this recipe for Boss's day and had cherry pie filling and blueberry pie filling on the side for toppings. It was gone. I got a sliver for my hubby and nothing left. It did not crack because I left it in the oven as suggested by one of the reviews with the water bath for 6 hours. It looked so perfect. The texture was awesome. I am trying it again with Chocolate chips and a cookie crust. Thanks for helping me impress my boss and my co-workers.

The reviews are right.  This cheesecake is to die for.  I made this for my husband's birthday because he loves cheesecake and normally it's not my favorite, so I didn't plan to eat much.  I couldn't get enough.  It was the perfect consistency and tasted delicious.  I followed the directions in the original recipe and used the tips like the waterbath and not beating it too much.  I'm a novice baker and this turned out great!

Mine cracked.  I left it in the oven as mentioned, but it cracked after about two hours in the oven.  I wonder if loosening it around the edges as someone suggested would work.  

Besides the cracking of the cheesecake (which I covered with some topping), the flavor and texture were great, and I'll be making this again.

It came out with a great taste. I combined this with a raspberry cheesecake recipe (basically for the raspberry swirl) and it came out well. I only used 3 packages of cream cheese though.

I had to update my review of this recipe!! I love this cheesecake, however, I must say there are times when I wish I had never taken it to work! I work with a group of 15 or so in an office and I am asked at least twice a month to make this and bring it in :) I have even been offered money!! I'm at it again tonight. These girls better love me! even though it is very simple to do! If you have been thinking of trying this recipe, all I can say, is you better enjoy baking and you should be able to take a compliment or 20 ;-) Excellent Cheesecake! I've made a few adjustments, but they are all from other reviews, so I'll not repeat them here.

I love cheesecake but I will admit this was the first one I attempted from "Scratch".  I followed the directions and it came out perfect.  Very thick, filling and yummy in the tummy.

So good, and I was never a cheesecake fan.  I did substitute heavy cream for the milk in the recipe.  I put it in the oven as stated and put the raised cookie sheet with some water on the lower oven shelf.  I left in oven for close to 6 hours after baking, and no cracks.  It was perfect!  Oh, I also just used a graham cracker crust recipe from the already crushed graham cracker box, and it was just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

This cheesecake is absolutely amazing.  It's the first cheesecake that I've ever made, and it turned out PERFECTLY!  I added a little sugar and cinnamon to the crust, and I baked the cake in a water bath.  I made this for my husband's birthday, and he RAVED!!!  I'll be making this again and again.

Maybe I did something wrong but mine cracked... I  won't blame that on the recipe though! I must have done something that caused it to crack. Besides that... it was delicious! I was making it for a get together today and when my parents tried it, they were like.. make sure you give them VERY SMALL pieces. Haha! To cover up the cracks, I bought the strawberry glaze and strawberries. It's great!

This is the best classic cheesecake recipe I've tried.  I followed the advice of the some other reviewers and filled the lower tray with boiling water when I first turned the oven on.  I left the cake to cool in the oven for 3 hours (that's all the time I had) and was rewarded with a beautiful crack-free cake.  I also accidentally included 2 cups of sugar rather than the 1 1/2 cups - although the cake was on the sweeter side, it still tasted great!  I made a mango puree in a blender using two fresh ripe mangos, juice of half a lemon, some orange juice and a table spoon or two of white sugar (sweetness to taste) - yum!

Very good cheesecake recipe.  This was the first "real" cheesecake recipe that I have tried.  I did have some cracks but it was only for me and my husband and it didn't bother us.

When I made this cheesecake, we had unexpected guests pop by that happened to be natives of New York.  I was nervous to be serving cheesecake to New Yorkers, but it was all that I had in the fridge at the last minute.  They absolutely raved about this cheesecake!  I'm not even a big cheesecake fan, myself (I made it for my husband), but I couldn't stop eating it.  This recipe is wonderful.

This was awesome.  My husband and I were so amazed that we had actually made this amazing cheesecake.  The only changes we made were: following the crust recipe with cinnamon and sugar from another reviewer and using 1/3 fat creamcheese.  We also baked it in a water bath, which resulted in zero cracks in the cheesecake.  We served with fresh berries and chocolate sauce.  Wonderful!

Amazing! I have never baked a cheesecake before. I followed the recipe exactly. My boyfriend loves cheesecake and was so excited to try it that he pulled it out of the fridge before I could even set my purse and keys down. He loved it. After a few bites he asked if it's possible to ship cheesecakes - to send one to his mom! I had no cracking and the center was completely level. The only small problem was that the top on the outside got more done and brown than the rest, and didn't have quite the same consistency.

Absolutely fantastic...this was the first cheesecake i've ever made and it turned out perfect.  I followed the other users suggestions about the water bath and to thoroughly grease the sides of the springform.  I cooled it in the oven for 5 hours and chilled it overnight.  The cake browned nicely and didn't crack.  I will be making this for years to come, thank you Chantal!!

My boyfriend and I are cheesecake fanatics so it was only right that I try to make one.  This was my first time making one and it came out brown on the sides.  Then I looked around for some tips and tried it with a water bath.  It came out perfect!  This is one I will definitely keep!  Thanx

Keep in mind, this could be operator error...but I followed the directions to a 'T' and ended up with a bland crust that fell apart if I even looked at it. I left it in the oven for hours, and I still got a crack the size of my aunt Edna's . Next time, water bath it shall be. I'll give you one credit, it does taste better after sitting in the fridge overnight. I still ate the whole friggin' thing.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Texture was perfect.  Tasted great.  But ended up with a huge X crack at the top even though I turned off the oven after baking 1 hour and let it sit for 4 hours inside. Will try a water bath next time.

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake, so I was prepared for failure.  I decided to make minis and adjusted the time/temp accordingly...the cheesecakes ended up cracked and completly inedible so I decided to try again and reduce the amount of time even more...the results weren't too much better. The cheesecakes still cracked and I really didn't care for the texture.  I will continue to look for another recipe.

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made.  With the tips I picked up from other reviews, it turned out both beautiful and delicious.  Preparation was simple, and I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks much!

VERY GOOD recipe!  I did cook mine for the 1 hour at the specified tempature and then left in the closed oven for 5 hours without opening.  I also made sure all my ingredients were room tempature and tried to not overmix while mixing.  I placed a 9x9 pan with water in it on the rack below the cheesecake.  I did have one crack, but it wasn't terrible. I will try again to see if I can bake it without the crack.  The edges did get a little browner than I like, so I will lower the temp by 25 degrees for my next try.  This is a really good recipe, and I got GREAT reviews from everyone who tried it.

This was by far the best cheesecake that I've ever made/tasted. The cake did crack but I didn't put it into a water bath, however, I did leave it in the oven for awhile. But appearance doesn't matter when the taste is out of thos world and it was so easy to make!

I have used many different recipes for cheesecake, but after I found this one, I tossed the others.  This is fantastic.  My brother and sisters request this from me for their birthdays and I'm happy to do it.  I bake at 325F in a water bath for 1 hour 5 minutes, and then I usually take out of oven right away and it's fine.  The longer it chills, the better it tastes!

Just wonderful! Great flavor, not overly rich but still quite rich. My cake was cooked plenty at 325. Also, I used a water bath, but it still cracked a bit. But in truth it was so good I didn't care. FYI-mine was way better after being refrigerated 24hours. The first day it was too moist.

Was my first time making cheesecake so was unsure what advice to follow from other reviews...now I know for next time - Bake at 325C - top was a little too dark for my liking - will add water bath on rack below - cake didn't crack, but extra moisture is a bonus, outside was slightly dry and will substitute cream for milk,at that point the cake has so many calories, might as well make it rich and creamy as possible! Made my own strawberry topping which was a huge hit. In the end everyone loved it, but I know from being an experienced enough cook that I can make it better. Will try again!

OMG!!! I LOVE this cheesecake recipe.  This was my first time making a true cheesecake and it was so easy.  My cheesecake came out perfect - no cracks, excellent coloring, wonderful texture and awesome taste!  I followed the recipe exactly, with a few minor modifications: I added some brown sugar and cinammon to the graham cracker crust, substituted heavy cream for the milk, and did use a water bath underneath the cheesecake when baking and through the 5 to 6 hour cooling process. I will definitely use this recipe again and again and as a base for various flavors of cheesecake.  Thanks so much for sharing this one!

I made this cheesecake for a friend's birthday. It was a last minute idea but I can say that after "trying" to make cheesecakes all these years, this one, by far, is the simplest, best tasting cheesecake I've made. It did crack but I only left it in the over for 3 hours and maybe chilled it for one. With the topping, noone noticed a thing! I decorated my cheesecake with candies and strawberry glaze. Thanks for submitting this!

AMAZING!  I love to bake but always end up overbaking every cheesecake I try.  This one turned out perfect.  I followed the directions and turned off the oven after an hour (even though the center was still very soupy) and it turned out perfect!  I did add 2 Tbsp of sugar to the crust and a tsp of lemon juice to the filling.  I also put a waterbath on the rack below the cheesecake.  It did end up cracking down the center, but I covered that up with some cherry pie filling and it was even better!  I will be making this again and again and again!  Thanks Chantal!!

GREAT!  For crust I used 1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup melted unsalted butter, 1/4 cup sugar.  I baked with a baking pan with about an inch of water on bottom rack and cheesecake on middle rack.  No cracks.  Because of other reviews I removed the water bath after baking then closed oven and let sit 2 hours which I thought would be enough.  Next time I will NOT remove the water bath because I think it let all the heat escape from the oven.  And I will let it sit for the full 5-6 hours because it was just a little softer in the center than it was on the outer edges.  Also I used Pam cooking spray, wax paper on the bottom of the pan, and it did not stick to the pan whatsoever.

This was a very good cheesecake.  Nice and smooth and creamy.  I used the water bath as recommended, and I didn't have a single crack.  I left it in the oven for about 4 hours to cool.  I also added some cinnamon and sugar and extra butter to the crust to jazz it up a bit.  I did run into a problem with the very center not setting as much as I would have liked.  I think I will bake for an extra 15 minutes or so the next time.  It is a beautiful looking cheesecake, that was very easy to make.

I cut this recipe in half and baked it in a ready-made graham cracker pie crust.  I also cut the bake time because of the smaller size.  The cake came out so well, my guests actually asked me where I bought it!

This was the first cheesecake I had ever made and I was really nervous about it.  I accidentally over-cooked it by about 10 minutes but it still tasted fabulous.  Mine did crack a little in the middle of baking around the edge, even though I used a water bath and never opened the door.  I topped it with frozen strawberries from the store (thawed out) and it got rave reviews!!! Thanks Chantal!!!

About two weeks ago I stumbled upon this recipe and made it. Since then, I have made about five more from requests. I am not an experienced baker, I had never before made a cheesecake but not one of my cheesecakes cracked. Last night I whipped up another to take over my grandfather's house today and used a food processor. This was a mistake. While I was doing it, I could not believe how easy the food processor made it (I just figured out how to use the processor yesterday..lol..it has to be lined up and locked in for it to turn on..haha) Anyway, the cheesecake went from thick and delicious to absolutely the smoothist creamiest thing I have ever tasted. It also did not puff up as much while it was in the oven as when I use the hand mixer. I didn't give this recipe five stars because I think there are better tasting cheesecakes out there..my boyfriend's mom's is one of them, but this recipe is consistent and if followed correctly can come out beautiful.

Chantal This is a wonderful cheesecake. I didn't use any fruit filling or any kind of cover-ups. I think when people use those things with a cheesecake it is to cover a multiude of sins....lol. but this cake was so easy to make. I a bit od almond, and lemon to it, also added brown sugar, and cinnamon to the  crust, that is because that is what we like, that is not because we were trying to change your PERFECT recipe. I used the bath, for it. and still left it in the oven to call for about 4 hrs, still perfect.... Girl this recipe is the  cat's meow.... Thank you so very much.

This cheesecake was amazing, and I've made quite a few good ones.  Follow other's suggestions using the water bath (I just put a pan of water on the rack below and wrapped the pan with foil). My only complaint was that it made WAY more than could fit in the pan.  My recommendation would be to cut the recipe by 1/3 to make one cake, or increase it 1/3 and make 2.  Otherwise there is a lot that goes to waste.  Good recipe!!!!

This was fabulous.  I followed the recipe, only adding a little sugar to the graham crackers for the crust.  I baked it with a pan filled with water underneath the cheesecake.  My top came out perfectly, no splits or bubbles.  Everyone loved it.  I did have a little extra batter ( I used a 9" pan) so I filled some muffin cups with a graham cracker and the batter and had "mini" cheesecakes.

I have never felt sooo flattered in my life than when I made this cheesecake. I mean EVERYONE (30+ guest) was raving that it was starting to make me shy and uncomfortable around the other guest that cooked sweets also. At least 5 women came up to me and asked for the recipe. And for all the people that wrote negative reviews, I am dumbfounded at how they could not think this was the best cheesecake ever (not just my opionion but from 30+ other guest). They must have messed up the directions, ingredients, or something. I cooked it the same as the recipe but with slight modifications for my own taste. I used Martha Stewarts recipe for the crust which is 2 cups of crushed graham crackers, 6 TB sugar, 1/3 cup butter, and 1/4 ts cinnamon. Which there is more crust to press into the bottom and sides of the springform pan. ALSO:The key directions in order for it not to get cracks is to OIL the sides and the bottom of the pan well. I don't use the water bath method because for some reason or another the water always gets in my pan even w/the aluminum foil. I cook it for 1 hour and let it sit in the over for at least 5 hours, then put in frig and it comes out to be a pretty and prefect cheesecake. Thanks so much for making me look like a better cook than I really am :)

This cheesecake is terrifc. I made it for Thankgiving and it was wonderful. It is very easy to make. My cheesecake cracked but I think the problem was that I did not crack the oven open while it cooled. I would suggest letting it cool in the oven for 5-6 hours with the oven door cracked. It is best to make the cheesecake several days in advance so it can sit and solidify. The texture was great, creamy but still somewhat firm. I put fresh berries on top. I followed the tips that were suggested, which were very helpful. This cheesecake will now be a Thanksgiving tradition.

700 reviews and still 5 stars - there's a reason for that!  This was easy and turned out perfectly. It's my new 'regular' cheesecake recipe - I was making the old one for over 30 years but this one is better!

Great cheesecake!  I had a big crack in mine after letting it sit for awhile in the oven as directed, but no biggie - I just covered the top in chocolate ganache.

Mine came out perfect with no cracks.  I did all of my mixing by hand with a wisk, and had no trouble at all.  I did not have the correct pan, so I just used a normal nine inch circular pan and used less crust materials and less filling.  I *never* opened the oven, cooked it for 50 minutes (because there were less ingredients than called for) and let it sit in the unopened oven for five hours.  It is *very* tasty, but not *quite* as good as my favorite cheesecake that comes from a candy shop downtown.

Well, I made this cake last night for a birthday dinner and it turned out quite nicely, however, I wouldn't call this a new york cheesecake.  This isn't as dense or rich as a New York cheesecake, and it has a crust.

I made the cake according to the instructions, with the exception of baking.  I used a water bath to help prevent browning and cracking and only left it in the oven for three hours, before removing and allowing to cool completely (on the counter).  I didn't have time to refridgerate before the dinner, so I threw it into the freezer for two hours and it turned out just fine.  

Everyone raved about it at dinner, including the staff at the restaurant where we went to eat.

Delicious. I did have a problem with blending the flour in without any lumps. I think I will try adding with the sugar as someone else suggested. It however did not affect the taste. SO good.

This cheesecake is absolutely to die for!  Everyone thought I bought it from a deli.  I usually don't care for what I cook, but I couldn't leave this alone (and I'm not a cheesecake fanatic)Surprisinly easy for being so good!

Perfect.  No cracks, just wonderful cheesecakey joy.  I only left it in the oven for 4 1/2 hours.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter, no water bath.  This one's going to get heavy rotation.

Mine cracked also, but it tasted great. I added some lime and it was fantastic. I'll make it again, but I'll try the water bath like others suggested.

In a word, wow.  I only used 3 T. of flour, and substituted Bailey's for the milk.  I would suggest adding the flour with the sugar, it's hard to make it smooth if you add it with the vanilla otherwise.  I topped it with caramel sauce, hot fudge and pecan halves for a turtle-type cake and it was amazing.

Thanks for the recipe. This was my first time making a cheesecake! It was so delicious. We ate it in one night. I used 2 cups of sugar instead off 1 1/2. It was great. I even had enough batter for two cakes and three mini cakes.  Thanks again!

Awesome! This is my very first time baking a cheesecake. It cameout very well and TASTY! I did bake it in a waterbath(boiling water) and only let it sit in the oven for 2hrs. Still got a crack in the middle, and that was my only issue. Should I have done anything differently? 
 Though, the taste is undeniable!

I've tried this recipe twice with the family taste test being 'awesome'. I still need to practice not getting the crack appearing in the top of the cheesecake (overcooking I assume)but it could be getting used to my oven too. I cannot use a water bath as I use a springform tin to cook....wonderful...a sure winner.

Yummy! I bought a graham cracker crust instead of making it from scratch, so it was even easier. I also softened the creamcheese by putting it in the microwave for a few seconds. Everyone loved it!

Delicious!  Mine cracked a little on top...so I just took it out of the oven and chilled it over night.  It turned out beautifully and everyone has decided I have to make this for the next holiday dinner!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I love cheesecake!  This was pretty good... I did add some sugar to the crust and used 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs.  I also added half a lemon to the cheesecake mix.  I did this all in my food processor and I think I overbeat because I got bubbles and the top browned pretty badly.  I used a water bath and all but my pan was off to the side.  Maybe that's why it browned? I also let this cool in the oven for 4 hours. This was my first time making a cheesecake so I'll continue using this recipe to perfect it. It's really smooth and creamy though!  Very filling.

This is a really great cheesecake recipe.  It was easy, delicious, and did not require too many ingredients.  I didn't make any changes to the original recipe except I didn't have a 9-inch springform pan so I resulted to a 10 3/4 inch springform pan which was actually the perfect size and made a large, thick cheesecake.  My only problem was a crack in the center although I did keep it in the oven for 4 hours after baking it.  I served the cake chilled with a warm vanilla sauce on the side and everyone seemed to really enjoy it.  There was only a few pieces and we only had 8 people!  In the end, this was an easy, fantastic cake and I will be making it again shortly!!!

After all the great reviews I had to make this for my small group.  It looked great and everyone said that it was fantastic, but I just didn't care for it.  I am not sure why.  I did get lots of compliments, but I am not sure I will make it again.  It is easy to make.

Made this for Easter and it got rave reviews.  Followed the recipe to the letter, except I added some lemon zest.  It cracked pretty badly but I threw a can of cherries on top and no one knew. 

I made it again for a party and this time it came out perfect, no cracks.

This was awesome. It was the first plain cheesecake that I have ever made and everyone loved it. I added alittle almond extract ( maybe a tsp) to the crust. The cheesecake did crack however even though I left it in the oven for three hours after cooking. This usually works out well for me, but not this time, so i cut the whole thing up the next day before my guests arrived..no one was the wiser.

Amazing recipe and amazing cheesecake! It didn't crack at all and it tastes exactly like something you would get in a restaurant. Will definitely make this again. The only change I made is using crumbled "Petit Beurre" for the crust since I can't find Graham crackers here.

I used my own recipe for the crust (I prefer a bit of sugar in mine).  I also cut the flour down to 2 tablespoons as some suggested.  Although I used a pan of water in the oven and let it cool, I still got a cracks along the edges, but a ring of blueberries covered it quite nicely.  Texture was nice - not too heavy, but not all fluff either.

First time I have ever made a cheesecake, I tried this recipe for Valentine's Day. It knocked my wife's socks off, and it is one of the best I've ever had myself. This recipe alone earned me a year of marital bliss, at least.

Fabulous! I also reduced the flour to the 2 tablespoons others recommended, and I used a water bath. I got so many raves, that I probably won't use any other recipe. Thank you so much.

Gosh... this turned out looking awful! The cake rose aout 3 inches higher than my 9" springform pan, and I am surprised it didn't overflow into our oven! HOWEVER, I am giving this recipe a -star rating because it was simply delectable. I made this with Supreme Strawberry Topping, and ooohhh was it wonderful. My boyfriend fell in love with it, and my mom and grandmother both asked for the recipe. Thank you, Chantal!

This was my first time making cheesecake and it turned out amazing.  There were no cracks at all.  I followed the suggestions and used a water bath after double foiling the bottom of the pan.  I put it directly into the refrigerator from the oven and let it cool for several hours.  I'll make it again for sure.

I served this for dessert at my uncle's birthday party. Run a knife around the edge of the cake before cooling to avoid cracking. My cake, unfortunately, cracked severely, but I mended it by dolloping lots of Cool Whip over the splits (no one was more the wiser). Served with strawberries. Rich, but not too sweet, and very creamy. Everyone loved it.

I've used this recipe over the years and ALWAYS get rave reviews. It turns out creamy and delicious every time! I do have trouble with it cracking, however. Since my family insists that I cover the entire thing with cherries, the cracks don't really bother me!

I swirl a blueberry sauce through the cheesecake. Very good. I've made a lot of cheesecakes for my family over the years, and this is the one that they repeatedly ask for!

I wouldn't call it resturant quality, more like grocery store.  Maybe I just don't like the addition of flour in my cheesecake, but it was a bit dry, not that wonderful creamyness that I was hoping for.  It was good, but I wouldn't make it again.  If you want that heavanly creamy cheesecake, find one without flour.

Simply amazing.  I've also made this by adding broken oreo cookie pieces (about 1/2 a package cut in quarters) to the batter for an oreo cookie cheesecake, and I used crushed oreo cookies for the crust instead of the graham crackers.  I serve it drizzled with fudge.

What can I say, Chantel you're a star!  My girlfriend loves cheese cake and when I offered to make her one for her birthday, I wondered what I had let myself in for.  However, your recipe saved the day....so easy and the reult was a very pleased girlfriend.  I'm in the UK, so the measurements were a little strange but hey it worked out.  We don't have Graham Crackers over here, so I substituted with Lemon Snap biscuits along with ginger nut biscuits..a crackin alternative, giving the whole cake a mellow lemo/ginger flavour.  Thanks again!

The crust?  Well, I'm still working on it.  I used 3 cups + 2 Tbsp. graham cracker crumbs, 3 Tbsp. melted butter, and 3/8 cups sugar (6 Tbsp).  I like it sweet and I like a LOT of it, but this was just TOO much crust.  The top 1/2 of the crust soaked up a little moisture from the cake making it JUST right but the bottom half was just crumbs.  NOT good!  Next time I'll try 2 cups of crumbs, 2 tbsp. of butter, and 1/4 cup sugar.  I'll report back next time I make it (which will be 7/23/05 for a birthday!)

Wish me luck!
Laurel

P.S.  No cracks and PERFECT color (no browning)

I have made this cheesecake thousand of times and it's always success!  I follow exactly the recipe calls for; just for the last 5 mins of baking, I increase the temperature to 210C so that it will give the surface a nice browning!

Just made this this weekend for a birthday party.  It was my first cheesecake and it turned out fantastic!  Tastes just the way a cheesecake should taste.

I made sure that my ingredients were pretty close to room temp. and baked it in a water bath and did let it cool in the oven for about 4 hours and it came out beautiful - no cracking at all.  (I also followed someone else's suggestion and got a Reynold's oven bag and had no problem with water leaking in.)

I can't wait to make it again!

It is testament to how great this recipe is that it still tasted great, even after my disastrous attempt at making it.  This was the first cheesecake I had ever made.  I overbeat it (through ignorance), my springform pan leaked about a quarter of the mixture into the bottom of my oven and my oven was too hot and so when it cooled it developed the Grand Canyon of cracks in it. HOWEVER, it tasted great and got rave reviews from the whole extended family.  So thanks Chantal, I'll definitely be trying it again.

oh my my!! this cheesecake was terrific! it was my first attempt at baking a cheesecake and i was intimidated! however, i got beautiful results with this recipe.  the only changes i made were to use nilla wafers instead of graham crust, and i just filled a shallow pan with water and placed it on the bottom rack of the oven( i read this tip on a review of another recipe) not one single crack! i was so impressed as was my family! this was my husbands request for his fathers day dessert, and i did not let him down! thanks!

This is a great recipe. It was my first time to ever make a cheesecake, and I read some of the reviews to get some tips on how to make it, and decided to do the water bath. Well, me being silly, I didn't put anything around the springform pan..and of course, water leaked in! But, I just cut off the crust, and it was still great. And the next day, the crust had hardened. So, even though I completely messed it up, it was still excellent. Next time I'll definetly make sure to put it in a oven bag.

Utterly delicious!  For Citrus Cheesecake, I use whipping cream (beat till stiff) instead of milk and 2 tbs of grated lime, lemon, OR orange zest - adds a terrific kick and beautifully compliments the flavour.

Made this recipe for a teacher's appreciation luncheon.  Every teacher / volunteer approached me telling me how great this cheesecake was!!!! I mixed in lemon jello to give it a lemony taste.  And by leaving it in the oven per the instructions, it did not have a single crack in it!!!This recipe was a smash!!!

i used 125g of oreo cookies (without cream) and 60g of butter for the crust. I can hardly get sour cream in my town so i substituted it with juice of 1 lemon plus enough milk to make a cup of home-made sour cream =P 
the batter was kinda watery and i was actually worrying that i might yield a soggy cheesecake. However, i followed the instructions and baked in water bath for 1 hour and another additional 10 mins... and let it stand in the oven to cool for around 2++ hours, then refrigerated it. 
The cake had a very smooth surface and it didnt crack at all!! I topped it with  a whole can of blueberry pie fillings and the cake was awesome all i can say!! my parents love it so much! i actually made this for Mother's Day =) 
Anyways, the texture was just nice and best served chilled. When i left it to room temperature it becomes too soft and the texture was not so smooth. (maybe the weather in my country is pretty hot... I'm frm Malaysia with 30C all the time) 
I definitely would use this recipe again  but i will make a little changes. I'm going to try substituting the milk with whipping cream instead, hopefully i can yield a smoother plus harder textured cake which can stand the hot weather when i am serving it out =)

I've always been under the conception that cheesecake was one of the hardest desserts to make... until this recipe came along! This was my first attempt at a cheesecake, and it turned out great even for a beginner like me! The crust was a bit messy to assemble, but the texture of the cheesecake itself was so good and creamy! It tastes exactly like the gourmet cheesecake I used to buy in new york city...

This was my first attempt at cheesecake.  It was excellent.  It tasted just like New York cheescake from the Bread Garden (a restaurant chain in here in Vancouver).  My only comments are that mine turned brown on top (did not affect the taste though) and mine cracked.  I will try a water bath next time.

I thought I would try this one due to the responses.  It was ok.  I have another recipe that I will go back to, as I did not care for the texture of this cheesecake.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. It was AMAZING. I made it for Valentine's Day and the top got sort of brown so I put fresh kiwi, strawberries and blueberries on it. Everyone who ate it said that it was the best cheesecake they had ever had. GREAT recipe!

First time I 've made a cheesecake and I gave this recipe a try since it looked delicious and it had got such great reviews. Not what I expected though. It kind of disappointed me. I don't know what was wrong with it. It didn't remind me of a true cheesecake. Maybe it needed more cream cheese or something. I am not satisfied.

I halved this. It was not horrible but it really was not great. It wasent very sweet or flavourful. I like the recipe from the Philly Cream Cheese box much better.

Delicious! I made this cheesecake for my roommate here in Japan, where ingredients are extremely expensive and not readily available. Instead of graham crackers (which I could not find for the life of me) I used coconut sable biscuits, and instead of sour cream, I used plain yogurt. Still turned out great, though. 

Question though - is it possible for the top to not turn brown without bathing it in water?

This is really the type of cheescake you would get in a deli or at Sam's Club. Mine came out pretty creamy. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and baked it at 400F for 15 min then reduced it to 225F for another 50 minutes. I find that if you bake at 350 or even 325 it would crack and the top would get really brown. I also baked it in a waterbath. I would have given it 5 stars but I like a lighter cheesecake. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making cheesecake- and I was happy with the results! I listened to most of the reviews and did the water bath and the special baking and everything- and my cheesecake still cracked- but the topping hide all of that. Everyone really enjoyed it- they couldn't believe that I actually made it from scratch. Outside of the crack in the middle it was perfect.

besides mini cheesecakes this was my first REAL attempt at a cheescake. I was suprised at how east it was. It cam out great! I didnt do the water bath, but let it cool in oven as directed. Mine did crack while cooking, but with little extra sliver cut out, made a perfect star shape, nobody knew it wasn't done on purpose. I will make this again for sure!

It was my first time baking cheesecake ever, and I can tell you that I wasn't put off by it. It turned out splendidly with a water bath. I did one batch in a springform pan (with water bath) and the remaining mixture I used to bake cheesecake muffins (without water bath). My muffins cracked at the start, and once I turned off the oven and let it stand, they began to sink in the middle, though there was no browning at all. Maybe this was coz of the absence of the water bath, and so the oven heat was harsher on the muffins, or maybe coz they were small in size, don't know. But I'm sticking to water baths from now on although it never compromised on taste - just the presentation. I like the tangy flavor of some cheesecakes, so I added 3 tbsps of fresh lemon juice and dumped in some lemon rind into the mixture. Instead of graham crackers or vanilla wafers, I used crushed Digestive cookies mixed with a little cinnamon and some fine sugar. I baked the bigger cake for an hour (as I did the muffins), it never cracked, no harsh brown spots. My family loves it!

This cheesecake is awsome!  I baked in a water bath.  I have to admit - I was a bummed when the baking time was complete.  The cheesecake looked horrible!  However, after it cooled in the oven for six hours, it was perfectly flat with no cracks!  Served it with Supreme Strawberry Topping for Easter dessert.

This is the closest thing I have found to real NY cheesecake. And considering this has been my favorite recipe as a child. I would consider myself very inept in cheesecake tasting. GREAT recipe!!! Thanks bunches.

It was an excellent recipe!  I used the water bath which prevented cracking, but on the second cheesecake I made I added a little sour cream because I prefer a creamier cheesecake.  Other than that it was great!

This cake is awesome! It tastes just the way cheesecake is supposed to taste. It did however crack, even if I followed instructions, but who cares. I only wish it didn't have so many calories....

Wow! This is the tastest birthday cheesecake I've ever made...they just loved it. The only thing I was disappointed with is that, although I followed the instructions word by word, for some reason it cracked in the centre but I was able to hide it with fresh fruit toppings.

I followed this recipe to the letter and never had a problem with cracks. My family loves it. I did find that it is too much for a 9 inch springform pan but when I put it in a 10 inch pan it was perfect. When the baking time is done I just turn off the oven and let it cool inside overnight and put it in the refrigerator in the morning.

Made this for guests yesterday and not one comment.  Yes, it was creamy and rich but not much flavor I added lemon extract along with the vanilla.  I followed the others posters' ideas with the hot water placed on the rack under the cake and that was perfect, no crack.  I also thought the crust was a bit soggy even though I baked it for 5 min.  Will try to jazz it up next time, maybe with chocolate or almond extract.

My daughter requested cheesecake for her graduation party and I'd never made it before ... but I definitely will again!  This is a fabulous basic recipe.

I followed the previously suggested crust variations of using cinnamon grahams & adding 1/4 c. ground nuts, plus a bit more sugar & butter.  For the batter, I added the juice & grated rind of one lime (for a total of 3/4 c. liquid including milk).

I did use the water bath & let it sit in the oven for a couple of hours after I turned the oven off & ran a knife around the edge--even with 2 layers of heavy duty foil, water snuck in!  Well, not really--the pan was sitting in a bit of syrup when I took it out of the oven, so I left it in one layer of foil & covered it with the other (handy!) until I unmolded it.  Water sure is sneaky stuff!  I ran the knife around the edge again before refrigerating it for a day and it did NOT crack.

Thank you, Chantal, for the recipe--and thank you, previous reviewers, for great suggestions!

Look no further!  This recipe, and the Chocolate Chip Cheesecake I (listed here) are the best cheesecakes by far.  I prefer the chocolate chip kind, but I make this one more often because it's the most requested.  I'm getting to be known as the cheesecake lady!  Open a can of canned pie filling, like cherries or blueberries, for individual slices, and it's really a hit!  I don't keep the cheesecake in the oven after it's done as long as the recipe calls for.  I find that the cake will split no matter what, but nobody knows because it's cut up anyway.  An hour or so in the oven to cool will suffice and then to the refrigerator.  I can't imagine a better cheesecake than this one!

This was good but I have to say I have had better.  I used the crust as instructed on the Honey Graham Cracker box.  Those who follow the recipe make sure you put the crust in the oven for about five minutes so you won't have soggy crust.

I cannot bake very well, but I tried this reciepe for my boyfriend who loves cheesecake. He LOVED it as did I. When my office was looking for people to participate in our bake sale, I thought that maybe lightening strikes twice and I could do it again. Well, my cheesecake slices were the first to go and the most requested after!! YAY! Now they want me to make 3 cakes next time! :(  Thanks for this FANTASTIC reciepe!!

This was one of the most successful, delicious cheesecakes that I've ever made. As I always do, after the cake was done I went around the rim with a knife, let it cool in the cooling oven for a couple of hours and then put it in the fridge overnight. Add a little hot strawberry jam poured on top and yum, yum!

This cheesecake was FANTASTIC.  I did keep a pan of water in the oven during cooking time as a "just in case", but I don't know if it was truly necessary.  The cheesecake has the perfect tangy flavor but still sweet, and mine had no cracking issues at all.  Very easy, this recipe is a KEEPER.  I added a chocolate ganache topping to really put it over the edge.

An OK recipe.  Too cream cheesy for my taste buds.  And mine didn't come out very smooth...my flour went all lumpy when I stirred it in.  But, I had NO CRACKS...and I didn't cool it as it called for.  I cooled it in shut off over for about an hour..then took it out for a bit, then put it in fridge while it was still quite hot..turned out great.  I added sugar to my crust, and it was yummy, but would bake it a bit next time..it came out kinda soggy.  A very filling cheesecake. I don't think I will make this one again, I liked the Basic Cheesecake much better(on this site).

This was the first cheesecake I'd ever made.  I had some problems with cracks. . . but the caramel sauce poured on top fixed that!  My mom was very impressed with this.  She said it was the best cheesecake she'd ever eaten.  That's quite the compliment cause she is a VERY picky person.  I'm looking forward to making this again.

Fabulous cheesecake! The first time I made it, I baked at 400 for a few minutes and then at 200 for several hours (suggestion made in the reviews.) That did NOT work for me. The cheesecake tasted great, but did not get done in the middle. The second time, I made it per the original recipe and it turned out perfect!

while the flavor was o.k. my cheesecake came out very dry and full of cracks.  I've never left a cheesecake in the oven for that long of time, but decided to follow the recipe to the letter.  The cracks don't bother me because I alway use a sour cream topping to hide any flaws plus I like the flavor, but the dry crumbly texture was disapointing to me.  Also, there was too much batter for my springform pan so I put the extra in a pre-made Oreo cust with some mini chocolate chips and baked for 1/2 hour it came out creamy and perfect.  I will try this recipe again but will not leave it in the turned off oven for 6 hours.

Awesome cheesecake! I topped it off with a few fresh strawberries and whipped cream. It was my first cheesecake to ever make and it was so simple and SO delicious. I will make this recipe all the time.

I've never made cheesecake before, but this turned out wonderfully. The one thing that I didn't like was that the crust was a little soggy, and maybe too thin. Next time I'll try a little thicker crust and see how that turns out.

Excellent excellent excellent. Thank you Chantal. And thanks to Allrecipes for the great tips and to other reviewers help, I had a perfectly done cheesecake with no cracks. I made a glaze that another reviewer suggested but I used blueberries instead of raspberries. This isn't hard to make, it just takes patience.

Received rave reviews for this cheesecake; however, it was a little too dark in my opinion.  I would, as others have suggested, cover the cheesecake with aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning...I must say that the cake did not crack, which was my biggest fear.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

I followed the recipe to the letter, and the cake came out perfect!  It was so smooth and creamy and delicious, I couldn't believe I'd made it.  Neither could my husband, but that didn't stop him from devouring most of it over the following week!  I also made a simple strawberry sauce with frozen strawberries and a couple tablespoons of granulated sugar, mixed well and reduced in a little saucepan, then refrigerated.  Great.

KILLER CHEESECAKE!!!!!!!!! Probably the best cheesecake I have ever made.  Used the crust recipe on the gramham box, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Left it in the oven, but it still cracked in the middle a little, otherwise KILLER!

This is a wonderful recipe. I made this for Thanksgiving and added 1/2 can of pumpkin, some cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg and it made a wonderful pumpkin cheesecake. If you do not have time to cool in the oven you may need to increase the baking time. I think that it took mine one hour and 25 minutes to get fully set. This made a nice tall, dense, browned cheesecake. It looked like I bought it at the deli. YUM :)

Fabulous! I will stick with this recipe. It is wonderful and everyone loved it. I followed the directions, cooking it an hour, then cooling 6 hours in the oven, door closed, oven off. It still cracked. I was trying to be really careful not to overmix the eggs and flour when I put them in, maybe I still mixed it too much. I didn't do the water bath, maybe I'll try that next time. I don't care if it cracks, it was wonderful! Thanks!

This is the first cheesecake recipe I tried to make myself.  Easier than I thought it would be. It tasted fabulous!  Very rich and creamy.  Mine still cracked a little although I left in oven to cool.  I used the Supreme Strawberry Topping on this site to serve with it.

Great recipe!  I wanted to make a smaller version of this recipe since only I was going to eat.  So I made 3 servings instead of 12.  However I still cooked it in a 9 inch pan, so each slice was really thin.  It was still so yummy and the portions were much more doable.  I only cooked it for 45 minutes at 350 and I used low fat cream cheese.  Oh, and I didn't use a water bath and I had no cracks..  Thanks for the recipe Chantal!

This cheesecake is just luxurious! I loved the velvety texture. I converted my husband into a pineapple-lover by adding 2 tbsp pineapple juice to the filling and placing sugar-sprinkled chunks of fresh cut pineapple on top. Thanks!

Update!  After doing a bit of research, I found that when a cheescake recipe includes flour, it should be baked in a water bath.  What a difference it has made!  I have been making this recipe for four years and it is still the BEST EVER!  Thanks Chantal!Although time-consuming, this is an excellent recipe!  I make it once a month!

I am not a cook, but decided to try my husband's favorite cheesecake for his birthday.  He loved it!  I am so proud.  The other reviews really helped.  I was afraid of the water bath so I put a 9x13 pan of boiling water on the rack below and no cracks!  Also after the first hour of baking, I shut the oven off and DID NOT OPEN the door for 5 hours.  Now I am confident to make this essentially very easy recipe again and again.  Thanks Chantal and everyone else.

I loved the taste.  Good, thick, creamy texture.  Classic cheesecake.  I didn't leave mine in the oven for six hours like the recipe asked.  After an hour of cooking, I turned off the oven and an hour later I checked and the middle was runny.  I didn't want to take the chance that it wouldn't be cooked through so I cooked for an additional 30 minutes at 350.  It still tastes great and looked wonderful!

This was excellent.  Very easy to prepare.  I used chocolate crumbs instead of graham crumbs and I don't think I would do that again.  I served it with a raspberry coulis and was delicious.  Instead of baking in a water bath I just put a pan of water on the rack below and my cake came out crackless.  Definitely a keeper.  I think I agree with another reviewer though, I think I would decrease the vanilla next time and maybe have a little more tanginess of the cream cheese coming through.

This recipe is absolutely the BEST! It's flavor is far superior than anything you could possibly buy. This is a classic that will stay in my family for years to come! I definitely recommend it to everyone. The only thing I see that needs changed is the temperature, if you have a dark pan it needs lowered or it will crack, 350 degrees is too high (try 330-340 degrees). Delicious with blueberry topping. Also, don't use 'lite' cream cheese, save calories elsewhere and not on this!

This was my first time baking a cheescake, and it turned out perfectly! This recipee is so simple, you really can't go wrong. Tastes like I bought it at the store, and not one crack. 
I used an 8 inch springform pan, because I did not have a 9 inch. . .I shut the oven off five minutes early. Used a water bath.

First time I've tried a 'from scratch' cheesecake and this is great.  Easy.  Even when I had it in the oven for a minute and found I'd left out the sour cream and flour, took it right out poured back in the bowl,  mixed and put back in the oven it worked!  I put a pan of boiling water on the shelf below, no cracks at all.

Everyone loved this cheesecake. I am now cinsidered to be the best baker among my friends. It was very simple to make, and turned out really nice... however, it was a little too sweet for my taste. I'll try it next time with a little less sugar.

This baked up wonderfully! My only mistake was following some of the review advice and using 5 eggs instead of 4, it took forever to bake and even then was on the soft side. I did change the crust and that was fine, on the whole it tasted wonderful and the texture was smooth and beautiful.

I never bake a cake before not even a cheesecake, so this one is my first. I am totally ecstatic that it comes out perfect (I did cartwheels). I made them using Braun blender, add 5 eggs instead of 4, and put them all in room temperature. I don't gave my cheesecake a bath but I put a pot of boiling water underneath a rack. My cheesecake never crack, good texture and above all good taste. I made them while I'm sick with a cranky baby who was also sick and later admitted in the hospital the next morning. But Chantal's cheesecake really boost my energy. I shared with my family members and in laws (each had one sliced) and they love it although my diabetic mom said it's too sweet, it's not actually. Thanks Chantal for sharing the great recipe, it's going to be a keeper.

Excellent! The Cheese cake was a hit in the family. Hint for foreigners (especially Germans...): If you can't get Graham crackers, you can use smashed up butter keks for the bottom. But you have to be careful pooring the cream cheese filling on top of it so that you don't stirr up the crumbs.

i'm a fanatic of cheesecake and when i read that it tasted just like a real new york deli cheesecake i had to make it, since i've never been to NYC and wanted to sample the king of all cheesecakes. The cake was good, cakelike it wasn't smooth like i aniticpated. and the crust got soggy even though i wrapped in it tinfoil. i might make this again in the future

My mom requested a cheesecake as her mother's day present this year.  This recipe is absolutely fabulous and so easy to make!!  I used "lite" sour cream and 24 oz cream cheese & 8 oz 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  I baked it at 325 degrees for 50 mins (w/ no water bath), and it turned out brown on the top...but it didn't crack!  It's creamy and delicious; my mom loves it!

This cheesecake is the best I've ever tasted!  I used a 8 1/2" pan which added height to the pieces.  A raspberry sauce and fresh berries on top created a perfect dessert.

This cheesecake was tasty, however I was disappointed that the top cracked.

This was the easiest cheesecake that I have ever made(except for the no bake quick ones).  I usually make one that takes 4 recipe cards and hours of preparation.  This was judged a winner by friends at a News Years Party and women at a meeting where I served it.  I did use more graham crackers and tried the cinnimon kind with a little added sugar for the crust. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this along with the Irish Creme Bundt cake and both were loved! Everyone said this cheesecake tasted different than a regualr cheesecake and wanted to know the secret.
I would definitely make this recipe again!!
Thanks so much for sharing it!

This is very easy and tastes fabulous!  Leaving it in the oven to slowly cool did not prevent cracks, but oh well it was easy and nobody complained about the look, it went down to fast to notice!

This is the best cheesecake I've had yet.  Topped it with blueberry pie filling, brought it to a Christmas party, and everyone was pleased (especially the ladies).

I tried this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I did get a crack down the middle so I am going to work on this.  I am making it again today, per my families request for Christmas.  Thank you Chantal for a delicious and easy cheesecake.

I have been searching for a holiday dessert and decided to try this cheesecake for our family gathering.  I must admit I was disappointed, as I prefer a dense, rich cheesecake to this light and fluffy one.  I also followed the recipe to a "T" and it still cracked like a crater in the middle.  Sorry, but I won't be making this one again.. not my favorite.

Well, when Leighana, my daughter of seven summers, told me, "Wow, Daddy! This tastes like 'real' cheesecake, I knew I had a hit. This rivals the tastiest cheesecakes I've made, yet it's simpler. And,...what an absolute beauty it is. Wanna impress 'em? Try this one.

Great Cheesecake recipe!  We decided to make it a holiday cheesecake.  We took 1 spoon of batter and combined it with red coloring and we took another spoon of batter and combined it with green coloring.  We put spoonfuls of each color on the cheesecake and used a knife to make a swirl.  It looked great!

Excellent cheescake. I used a store bought crust and had enough for two cheescakes after I was done mixing the ingredients. I will also try lowering the cooking temp to 300 next time as the top turned out a little brown. Still the best cheesecake I ever made! Thanks Chantal!

OH MY GOSH! This is THE best! I made it for my husband’s birthday and he was beside himself. It looked like a bakery's (no cracks) and the taste was out of this world. I think I used too many graham crackers though. I used 15 of the big rectangle ones and the crust was pretty thick. I would also suggest making it WELL ahead of time. I made it in the morning and by early evening, it hadn't chilled enough. The next day, it was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe Chantal!

Let's just say that I couldn't leave it alone all by itself in the lonely oven.  It was calling my name to just taste a bite, and so I gave in.  My husband and I are both cheesecake connoisseurs, and so we really know our cheesecake.  Apparently, you do as well, Chantal.  From now on, we will be skipping desert at our favourite Italian restaurant and baking our own cheesecake that we can eat for days--if it lasts that long!  Thanks a bunch for this recipe.  I will definitely be passing it along.

Chantal, this is a great cheesecake!  And so versitile!  I have stirred in choc chips and put a choc swirl on top, served it with fruit (blueberry pie topping, as well as a homemade fruit salsa), and even swirled in maple syrup.  It has always turned out great!!  (Except for the time I made it at mom's house and used salt instead of sugar, but you can hardly fault the recipe for that!!  LOL)  Thanks a bunch!

The first time I made this it came out soupy.

I made it again the next day, put it in a water bath.  Baked it at 350 for an hour, lowered it to 250 baked another half hour and it came out perfect!! (I usually need to bake things longer in my oven).  Did not leave it in there for 6 hours.  I also used a different recipe for the crust.

GREAT NY style cheesecake! My friend oooh and ahhhed over it.

Really yummy!!!!  I think I would cook it at 300 for a longer time next time as the top got brown and the center was a little soft yet.  Everyone loved it!!!

The recipe was really easy to follow and for my first cheesecake- it turned out really yummy.  Though I prefer my cheesecake to be a little chunkier and less eggy.  Overall, this is some finger lickin' cheesecake!  Gotta try it.

I used this recipe for my husbands birthday last week and it was a real hit.  I added mini chocolate chips and made the crust thicker (I love graham cracker crust).  Only, problem I did everything called for in the recipe and the cake still cracked (quite a large three way crack right in the middle)but no one cared because the cheese cake was sooooooo good!

My second ever cheesecake and it turned out very very well.  was creamy and very deli style 
there was a lot of cracking though so i might try making it in a water bath next time. did not care much for crust's taste. would add some sugar. 
really loved the cheesecake and everyone that tried it thought it was absolutely awesome.  

thanks chantal
