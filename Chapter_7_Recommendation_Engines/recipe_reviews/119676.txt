So very simple for someone who not only hasn't really made a "real" cheesecake and isn't the best at pie crusts. (I own the two-step cheesecakes, made from Cool Whip and cream cheese. I can make the heck out of those, lemme tell you.) I used the Butter Flaky Crust from this site, which I made the night before and let set in the fridge. I followed the directions exact, only using strawberries because that was what I had. No issues with it not coming out right, perfection. And you can't even tell that there's cottage cheese in it. For me, even though it did come out well, I just don't think I like the cream cheese filling with a pie crust. I think I'd like to make this filling with a graham cracker crust. I think it would be really great then. Don't skip the homemade whipped cream on the top, it really makes the pie extra yummy.

I agree with a previous poster that I will try this again only in a graham cracker crust and spring form pan because I just loved the filling but the pie crust was just ok.   Did fine in a pinch when I had a craving for cheesecake but no graham on hand. The cottage cheese adds to this well. :)

SO good! I served it as a cheesecake, with whipped cream on the side. Very good, pretty easy and you don't need a springform pan.

one word... WONDERFUL! Super super easy recipe, tastes great AND one of my friends doesn't like raspberried and said it was DELICIOUS! I made a homemade graham cracker crust instead of using a pie crust. Other then that I added a little lemon juice and vanilla, just for flavor!

This was the very first time making cheesecake and I think the only thing I might change is putting the whipped cream on right before serving and serve it with a raspberry sauce. It was so light!!!

I work in a professional kitchen and we needed a cheesecake stat! I used the Ingredients tool on allrecipes and found this.  It turned out very yummy, and smoother than I thought that it would be.  I folded in frozen blueberries (didnt use the raspberries) and topped each slice with whiped cream.  I think that the pie was missing a sauce.  Next time I will drizzle a bit of blueberry sauce over each slice.  Our residents/customers thought this was a nice twist on a traditional cheesecake.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday instead of a cake. He's not big on sweets but loves berries, and he went crazy over this! He even ate it with a fork for breakfast the next day, right out of the pan. :)

I did use a graham cracker crust, like the commenters suggested. Came out great!
