This was good, to make on hand when needed. It's missing something that I can't put my finger on. I cut back the salt and changed it  to kosher salt, as that's what other testers did as well. I also added 1/4 tsp. of ground red pepper, which gave it a bit of a kick. Using buttermilk is key when making this. I might keep experimenting. I plan on adding dill weed next time. EDITED 06/11/08: I added dill weed. That's what's missing. Much better with it.

This stuff is wonderful.  I don't use buttermilk, but I use milk and vineger as a substitue.  Tastes just like restaurant style ranch.  Yumo!

I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5, because per previous reviews, I halved the amount of salt, and I think that was the right decision. 
Instead of the 1 tsp of seasoned salt, I put in 1/4 tsp of seasoned salt, and 1/4 tsp of regular salt.   That seemed to be just the right amount. 
I made this into a dip with 1/4 cup buttermilk, an 8 oz container of fat-free plain yogurt, and about 1/2 cup of light mayonnaise.   It was very good!

Amazing!  I used 1 tbls of powdered buttermilk mix (much easier to have on hand than buttermilk) & just added water until the desired consistency. I never buy ranch anymore.  Thanks a mil!!

This recipe makes a wonderful ranch dressing!! (use the mayo and buttermilk) I made a chicken tortellini salad, and I wanted a buttermilk ranch to use warm over the salad. This recipe was so fast to make and was delicious! I recommend it highly!

I don't think pepper is really needed, or the amount called for is way too much. Try adding pepper to taste. For better taste allow it to mellow in the fridge for about an hour or longer, if possible.  I used 1/2 fat mayo and 1% Buttermilk.  Also, when using the amounts stated, you get a thick dressing.  It looked like more of a dip to me, so I added an extra cup of buttermilk to thin it out and a tad more spice to compensate for the additional buttermilk.  I REALLY couldn't tell this was a low-fat dressing. My finished dressing was very tasty and turned out to be about 28 calories a tbsp. Next time I want to try fat-free or 95% fat free mayo and see how that tastes.  Thanks for the great recipe that has become a keeper for me!

A great mix to keep on hand- with no unpronouncable ingredients. I scale the recipe for 30 servings and store the rest in a jar. I also like the dressing made w/ more buttermilk than mayo- it tastes more tart and fresh like the bottled stuff

This was a good recipe, next time I think I will use plain salt instead of the seasoning salt, as that seemed to come through strongly.  I only used half the amount of mayo and the full amount of buttermilk for a salad dressing.  My family liked it.

I used this today for the "ranch oyster crackers" from here. It worked great. Only changes I made were that I did not use pepper and I used regular sea salt instead of season salt. I will definitely use this again!

I had already started making a different recipe that called for a packet of ranch...then I realized I was out of packets of ranch dressing mix! I did a quick search and found this recipe. It was much easier than I thought and I had all the ingredients on had. We couldn't even tell the difference between this recipe and the store bought ranch dressing mix! Will definitely be using in the future. It's less expensive than purchasing the packets plus added bonus: no preservatives!

I thought the idea of adding dill was excellent.  If you make up a big batch of this and store in a container, you will need to use one tablespoon of the mix per cup of mayo/sour cream for your dressing or dip. I am living in China for the time being and it's difficult to find seasoning packets and buttermilk, so I love that I can make something homemade to replace the things that are available in the states.

This is so good with lite sour cream. I added sour cream to a bowl and added the mix until  it tasted right. Plus no preservatives or msg. I think next time I'll add some chopped jalapenos to give it a little kick!

i LOVE this quick and easy recipe. I usually shake it with skimmed milk, a glop of mayo and a tsp of cider vinegar... making it the absolutely perfect Ranch Dressing after an hour in the fridge! I've used this recipe a million times- and plan to a million times again!

What a fabulous recipe!  I was looking for a ranch seasoning recipe ever since I read the ingredients on the commercially produced ranch mix - it is full of MSG and soybean oil (if you don't know the dangers of soybean, research it on the web). The only modifications I made to this recipe is that I cut the salt and added 1/8 tsp. dill weed.  Thanks BEC!

This dip was awesome, but I had to make a few changes. If I had made it exactly as written, I don't know that it would've been as tasty. Here's what I did: 1) decreased pepper to 2-3 grinds of fresh pepper, 2) used regular salt & decreased to 3/4 tsp--next time I'll only use 1/2 tsp, 3) added 1/8 tsp of dried dill weed, 4) mixed with plain sour cream and a little plain yogurt to give it a more "tangy" flavor. With these changes, it was fantastic! I'll definitely make this again and again.

I truly enjoyed this seasoning mix. I added it to 4 diced potatoes, onions & bacon. Baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. The perfect side dish for breakfast or dinner.

This is great and inexpensive. Mixed up a larger batch for future uses. Will never buy the store bought expensive mix again! I did do some minor changes - added dill, less peper, less salt (used kosher). Mixed in some with a little plain yogurt for a sandwich spread. Yum!

pretty good...definitely better when you add some dill, but if you don't have any it is okay without it. Thanks for sharing!

Outstanding.  I will never buy bottled dressing again.  This has such a complex flavor.  I used plain Greek yogurt instead of buttermilk, and mayonnaise to make dressing.  I didn't think it was too thick.  I also added some grated cucumber.  I use an old spice jar to keep the mix, and add a teaspoon to 1/4 cup mayonnaise and 1/4 cup yogurt to make dressing for two.

Thanks so much for this recipe. This is the only ranch I use now, and I make it regularly. It is good, and easy to prepare. I like that I can now make this fresh for my family and avoid processed ranch, I thought I would have to give it up. I do add the dill as recommended by so many.

I really enjoy this seasoning blend.  I use it for The World's Best Potato Salad on this site in place of the 1/2 cup of ranch dressing.  I also make sure to make a couple extra batches to use as a seasoning for grilled or roasted vegetables.

THANKS!!!

I prepared these buffalo chicken burger.
I was mixing the blue cheese dressing for it. And it tasted awful...i checked for alternative blue cheese recipes, but they were all the same...
I was looking for something to cut the hot flavor for the burger...then i thought! Ranch dressing!!
I tried your recipe and added half sour cream half mayonnaise and it turned out amazing!!!
i'm so relieved!! Your recipe was totally a life saver!! After marinating my chicken breast, i was so desperate to find a dressing to fit with the burgers!! thanks again! A HUGE thanks!! 
And i'll do this recipe for dipping veggies and also for salad dressing instead of buying it!!!

I found a recipe using cream cheese as alfredo sauce, it called for the dry ranch seasoning. I go to buy that is has MSG! NO THANKS! So I found this recipe for the dry mix. I mixed this with 4 oz of cream cheese heated on stove with a little broth, poured over chicken and pasta. Alfredo! This was the best alfredo sauce ever! And I've been trying recipes forever!

Pretty darned good!  I made it exactly as posted then tossed chicken pieces in the mix and baked them.  My swarm of teenagers thought it was yummy.  Next time I'm going to reduce the black pepper, switch to sea salt, and add dill.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great zesty mix that is good as either the dip or dressing.  We adjust fat content by using low or no fat mayo or sour cream and low fat buttermilk.  We make it it bulk so we always have the mix on hand.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Excellent seasoning. I am so pleased to have found this recipe as I use a fair bit of ranch seasoning packages. The only thing I would change is to cut the salt in half. It is very salty and I added 1/2 tsp dill. All in all a great recipe and very handy.

I made both the dip and salad dressing for this recipe. I tested both after letting them sitting overnight and they were pretty good, but they needed a little more flavour. I added a little more of the garlic and onion powder and also a little fresh dill as suggested by others. Turned out delicious.

A little too much pepper--and I LOVE pepper. Also, agree with the prior reviewer who said it was missing dill. I also added chives. Mixed half sour cream, half greek yogurt. Delicious dip!

Had to double all seasoning used Creole season salt.  Added dill, not bad.  Best if flavors are left to meld together.

Very tasty. I read the reviews and cut the pepper to 1/4 tsp and added 1/2 tsp dill. I was out of thyme but I did not miss it. Very easy and much more inexpensive than store packets.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I LOVE ranch dip with carrots(pregnant) and whip this deliciousness up with some cool sour cream at least once a week. Works great to season meat also.

Yummy, very fresh tasting Ranch. I altered just a little: 1/2 cup of buttermilk and 1/2 cup of 2% milk added to the cup of mayo. Used plain kosher salt instead of seasoned salt. Made it in the blender. Leave it in the fridge overnight before using. BEST EVER!!

I added celery flakes also- about 1 Tb. - Also instead of seasoned salt- didnt have any- added 3/4 salt and paprika, onion salt and adobo seasoning for the other quarter. Made 15 x this recipe- and keep it in the cabinet labeled Ranch 1 tb. to container sour cream. Hubby loves it!

I have now used this recipe 3 different ways.  First, I made a buttery ranch parmesan rub for wings.  2nd, I used the seasoning to coat diced potatoes to grill or oven roast. Third, I mixed the seasoning with sour cream and mayo (1 cup of each) to make dip!  Overall, my favorite use has been to make ranch potatoes.  It's nice to have another option.  Pairs great with a protein and a vegetable for dinner.  I make this along with Emeril's Essence and keep it in a jar in my pantry.  Winner!

As directed, WAY too salty - seriously (at least when combined with regular mayo and made into salad dressing).  Also, if making as directed into salad dressing, way too much liquid - was too runny. Having said that, solid 5 stars a) without salt and b) cutting liquid down by half.  Solid 5 stars again when used as seasoning over veggies (drizzle with olive oil, season, then roast).

Lacking some flavour but not too bad; I combined some of these ingredients with the Ranch dressing ll dressing from this site (just the dry ingredients), and it's a nice combination.  I find dried minced onion brings out more flavour than onion powder, and make sure to let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before serving.

I am so happy that I found this recipe.  I greatly appreciate you sharing this with us.  It saves a lot of money$$$ (Now take that Hidden Valley Ranch & Kraft)  I no longer have to buy ranch dip or the seasoning packs.  I really impressed myself and my husband with this one.  Now when recipes call for a packet of ranch I can turn this. I did take the advise of the other helpful reviewers and added an 1/8 tsp. of dill. Thanks A BUNCH $$$

Like other reviewers, I used 1/2 the amount of seasoned salt and used 1/2 kosher salt.  Next time I'll use all kosher salt, so there is no MSG.  I also added 1/8 tsp. dill.  So glad to know how to make this from scratch!

This was by far my favorite dry ranch recipe!  I followed others' advice and only used 1/4 salt and 1/4 seasoned salt- I didn't have thyme, so I didn't use it.. It tasted GREAT!!

This was excellent!  I made salad dressing with it.  Followed recipe exactly except it needed more buttermilk as it was too thick.  I usually make my own dressing with tends to be a savory vinegar and oil or a sweet vinegar, oil and honey variations. But I LOVE ranch dressing and was a little nervous about making it.  I won't buy the bottled again.  I'll just have to keep some buttermilk in my fridge at all times!  I made mine 2 days ahead of time.  I think this definitely helps marry the flavors.

Make a big batch and keep it in your cupboard for seasoning various things.  I just add it by taste to equal parts mayo and sourcream for the dip version.

I tried this last night for use as a salad dressing because I was out of the packaged stuff. Only thing I did different was to add dill as other reviewers suggested. I was only able to let it sit for about 20 minutes and it was GREAT! Little too heavy on the garlic powder for hubby's taste but other than that, it was AWESOME. Will not be buying the packages again.

Nearly the same as what comes from the package. I left out the buttermilk to make the dip and it still tasted right.

Top Notch! I actually live overseas and can't find any dressing packets (let alone Ranch!) so when I found this recipe I was so excited. I made it into a dip for a party last night and it was devoured. I guess everyone was as excited as I was to have Ranch! :) I know it sounds silly - but thank you for posting this recipe! :)

Great Recipe!  I noticed that after leaving the dressing in the fridge for a week or so, the flavors really kicked in.  I´m living in ecuador and i was looking for an inexpensive ranch dressing.  This is it!

I did not care for this recipe. I thought the amt of garlic powder and seasoning salt was too much. I had to add mayo and sour cream to the buttermilk in order to dilute the garlic/salty taste. Just not what I was looking for...I will stick with the store-bought ranch mix.

I made this following some other reviews and used sea salt instead of seasoning salt and added dillweed.  I wish I had followed other reviews and left the salt out completely.  It is way to salty!!  It had a great ranch flavor, but the salt was overwhelming.  I think adding the dillweed made a big difference in enhancing the flavor.    I added it to a 16oz tub of sour cream making a dip.  I will make it again leaving out the salt.

A good base, yet the ratio of mix : liquid makes it very bland and tasteless... double the ingredients and you will be good to go.  add bleu cheese if u want bleu cheese dressing/dip

We loved this mix! Used low fat sour cream and buttermilk to get the right consistency.  I ended up adding dill and tastes just like hv ranch homemade.  Will sub in some plain yogurt next time just to try.

This was very good and I preferred it over the dry mix.  I mixed it into a blend of 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 plain greek yogurt for a tasty dip.  It didn't taste exactly like the dry ranch dip but it was very good!

This is really good, and nice to make instead of worrying about having the Ranch Dressing packet on hand.  I made this to go with a seasoned crackers recipe and it worked out great.  I did add a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes just for a little heat.  I was very happy to have found this recipe and will use it again.

I was looking for a homemade ranch seasoning to add to plain greek yogurt to make a healthy ranch dip for veggies without all of the preservatives and stuff that come in the store packages, and this is just what I was looking for! I adjusted some of the seasonings based on personal taste (a little less salt, a little more onion powder) and it tastes just like a Hidden Valley Ranch Dip Mix!!

This was perfect!  Just the right taste and thickness for a dressing. And soooo easy too.  I used 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp seasoned salt and added 1/4 tsp dill.  Also I reduced the pepper to 1/4 tsp and used white pepper.  I might experiment with more pepper next time.

This was a good basic recipe for dry Ranch and I did like it but using the herbs in the measured amount was a very bland dip so I gave it 3 stars. I just kept adding the herbs until it was right and I had to triple the amount called for to get it right. 
I am still glad I had this for the basic idea though!
I used plain yogurt not mayo so this may have made a differance. It was a good dressing/dip in the ebd though.

Thank you for this recipe!!!  Its good to know that this equals one packet of dry mix.  I used it on a spicy pretzel recipe because I didn't have the dry mix and it turned out just great!  Tasted the same as with the packet.  A keeper!

I decided to make my own ranch and was pleased to come across this recipe. I took some of the recommendations from others into consideration. I did 1/2 teaspoon of regular salt instead of 1 seasoned salt, 3/4 cup of mayo (maybe slightly bit more I eyeballed it), and added somewhere between 1/2 tsp-1 tsp of a dill seasoning I have (pampered chef). It is delcious. Way better than anything in a bottle and easier then running to the store to buy a packet (cheaper too lol). Thank you!

This is great - the only thing missing is dill, but I tasted it before serving and added 1/2 tsp dried dill weed so all set!  I made it as a dip, didn't have buttermilk but substituted mayo instead.  My husband the ranch lover said it was the best, that's good enough for me!~

I typically do not like ranch dressing or flavor, even though I love everything that goes into it. My garden was bursting with herbs, and the man adores it, so I gave in. I was shocked, at how much I actually liked it! I did use fresh parsley, and thyme, and the man said he missed the dill flavor, so I added some fresh dill too, and paprika for color. Overall, I will make this again, using fresh herbs from my garden!

Thank you so much for posting this. I was looking all over the internet for an alternative to the envelope seasoning mixes, esp. as many of them add extra additives and often, MSG. The only addition I made to this recipe was I added 1/4 tsp of Hungarian Paprika, as I think it balances the flavors perfectly.
Awesome recipe and thanks again! :-)

This was good, but great the longer it sits around. I decreased the salt, and I think it's a bit heavy on the pepper for a ranch dressing/dip, so I will probably decrease that next time.

This is good! I made this as dip using one cup each olive oil mayo and light sour cream. I too used kosher salt (only 1/4 tsp) and added 1/4 tsp cayenne to give it just a tiny kick. It came out nice and thick so it didn't drip off the veggies. My mom, who normally hates ranch, really liked this! She said it was "so nice and herb-y instead of mayonnaise-y."

I need to eat gluten free so it is nice that it has NO MSG.  I added a little more parsley and garlic/salt grinder.  Next time I may take someone elses advice and add some dill and cut back on the seasoned salt.  I will make this again.

I took the advice and added dill weed, but shouldn't have added so much thyme. I think next time I'll leave out the thyme and just add a pinch if needed. Otherwise, this was great to whip up. I also added a few drops of Cholula. Very good.

Wow. This was gross. At first I cut back on the pepper and seasoned salt as many suggested - and it was gross. Then I added the rest of the salt and pepper - still yucky. Don't make this unless your taste buds are all dead.

This was fantastic!  I think when I was grinding the black pepper into it, it was a little larger pieces.  We kept on getting bites of black pepper, so I recommend using a finer black pepper.  Other then that, it tasted just liket he real thing!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really good, I added dill as someone else had suggested, I will use this instead of buying packages now. I made this as a dip for veggies, would be good as a dressing as well.****update 02/12/10, I make this all the time now, no need to buy dressing mixes, last time I even mixed in blue cheese so good, try it!!!

This recipe was a great find to whip up at the last minute. I added the above ingredients to about 3/4 Cup each light sour cream and light mayo and it tasted awesome. Almost just like store-bought. I also added a dash of cayenne for some zip.

WAAAAY too much pepper. I might try to make it again, but will use MUCH less (if any) pepper. Seemed like it could have potential if it wasn't killed by the pepper.

This was very good.  I tasted it after putting it together and added a little dill weed for some extra flavor.  I also added a little extra seasoned salt.  I made this as a dip and added 1 3/4 cup sour cream (which was basically a larger container of sour cream) and then a little bit of milk (using the vinegar substitute for buttermilk) but less than the called for amount.  We thought it was very good and it definitely saved some money.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good...tastes like ranch even with reduced fat sour cream and mayo!  Gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I think the salt content might be too high. I read reviews first and so reduced the salt. I used 1/2 tsp (which is almost too salty in itself) with 1 cup buttermilk; abt 1/4 cup sour cream (this was all I had) and abt 1/4 or more mayo. I didn't have parsley. But it tastes like ranch to me.   I also cut down pepper based on previous reviews. My recommendation is to add salt and pepper to taste. Oh, and yes I added dry dill weed based on the other reviews.

I give this 4 stars beause after adjusting the salt and pepper down per other reviews, the buttermilk taste was a little too strong.  Very good otherwise.  The next time I will try reducing the buttermilk a little and adding the dill weed to see how it comes out.  I served it with a vegetable plate for Xmas Eve open house and there wasn't much leftover for the next morning!  Thanks for sharing.  I will make it again.

I followed other recommendations and skipped the pepper.  Also used 1/4 tsp seasoned salt + 1/4 tsp regular salt.  I did not have buttermilk on hand, so I incorporated 1 TBSP powdered buttermilk with the dry ingredients before adding 2 cups sour cream.  Delicious as a veggie dip!

I made this recipe because I found out my Ranch mix was expired, and it had a lot of calories. It was good, but I used regular salt as per EARLANDVALERIE's suggestion, and because I didn't have seasoning salt. I also added some white pepper to give it a  bit of a zing. All in all it's a great and inexpensive substitute for ranch mix.

I like salt a lot!  But this was too much.  I would make again, good flavor but I will add season salt last and add to taste- I am thinking 1/4 would suffice.  I used McCormicks Season Salt, and Califoria Blends on Onion and Garlic powder.  Would work great for wings and as a dip but for salad dressing the salt was overpowering.  I even let my kiddos pass on their veggies tonight.

Delicious! We used milk and mayonnaise because we didn't have buttermilk so it was super thin but still perfect for dipping pizza, especially over Hidden Valley! Can't wait to try it with actual buttermilk or sour cream.

This was just what I needed for the tortilla rollups IV recipe that called for dry ranch. Didn't even have the onion powder it called for and it wasn't missed. Also made a perfect dip for hot wings.

Very good - nice to have a substitute when I forget to buy the premade stuff.
But I have to say I think the 4 hour cook time is way too long!

I thought this was a much better option than using the chemical and salt laden stuff sold in stores.  I completely omitted the salt and increased the other seasonings to taste.  I also looked up a recipe for seasoned salt (from this site) and added paprika and tumeric.  Sounds odd but it worked for us!

I really like this.  Like others I added dill (1/8tsp), reduced pepper (3/8 tsp), and reduced salt (1/4 tsp).  I am on a low sodium diet and I think I could have cut back on salt a little more.  With the changes I made the recipe made a little over 2 tsp.  I added the whole amount to 2/3 cup sour cream for a nice low sodium veggie dip.

I mixed this with cream cheese to make a spread for lavish roll-ups. Everyone loved them. Also, it makes a lovely dip mixed with sour cream. I sprinkled it on zucchini with Parmesan to make oven fries. Each recipe benefits from the addition.

This recipe is missing a boat load of dill. I added 2 tsp and besides that i made it just as written and it was pretty good. I used the powdered ranch nix to make Beer Dip 1 i got in my inbox today from allrecipes. Dip needs to sit for 3 hours so tomorrow I'll see how it tastes

Used this in a recipe that called for the dry mix. Didn't have any but had all these ingredients on hand. It added the perfect flavor to the dish. Just enough zing and I could easily control the amount of salt. It's a keeper.

Only made this in a recipe for Breaded Parmesan Ranch Chicken and the pepper was a bit too much. I had increased the recipe to 18 servings (3 tbsp), in which case I would try to reduce the pepper fro 2-1/4 tsp to 1-1/2 tsp next time.

There was way too much salt and pepper; only 1/2 the amounts called for are needed, at most. Otherwise it's OK, but as others have said, it seems to be missing something.

Excellent! I substitute plain yogurt for half the mayo to squeeze a little more goodness into our diet (1/2 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup mayo, 1 cup milk plus the seasoning mix).  It's really good.

I use this recipe all the time. Sometimes I use sour cream and some cream cheese. Tonight I used sour cream and goat cheese. Whatever I have on hand is just fine. The seasoning mix tastes great every time!

I tried out this recipe, and I don't know why it didn't work well for me. I was really hoping that it would work but oh well. I guess I will have to stick with the ranch packets.

Love it! I made it as is because my family loves black pepper and plenty of flavor. When I made it into a dip, I used Mayo and lactose free/gluten free cream cheese as my family has to follow both diets. My son was so thrilled to be able to eat ranch dip/dressing again! Thank you!

i was looking for a seasoning blend to put on my croutons before baking them in the oven and used this for a starting point.. used 1/2 t for both pepper and seasoned salt, didn't change the amt's for the garlic and onion powder, didn't have dried parsley and i don't care much for thyme, so i added 1/2 t each of basil and dill weed.. used half of the mixture on the croutons and the other half i mixed with some greek yogurt to make a dip for some veggies.. ty for the recipe ~~UPDATE: this was absolutely amazing on pork chops!  i used this on 1 lb boneless chops that we cooked on the george foreman.. i followed the recipe more this time Only using Sarah Jo's suggestions of adding 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes and dill (i used 1/4 tsp).. i used my mortar and pestle to try to blend everything together as much as possible.. SO good.. i'm sure we'll be using this more in the future.. ty for the recipe

My family really likes this.  It's not much different from the packaged ranch mix.  From now on I will use this mix instead of the expensive package mix.
Very good recipe for flavor and savings.  And as others have said it is versatile. I only use 1/2 tea of pepper and 1/8 tea of dill.

I used table salt and added it to sour cream.  It was amazing.  I would like to try using the buttermilk version, watering down a bit for a salad dressing.

I don't ever buy ranch dressing or dip because they generally have ingredients that I don't want to serve to my family (MSG, too much salt). This recipe, then was a really good starting point for creating a ranch dip that my family could all enjoy. 

I didn't have seasoned salt (I prefer to mix my own when I need it), so I replaced that about 50/50 with Kosher salt and celery salt. I added the mix to sour cream and buttermilk to achieve the consistency I liked, and I got rave reviews from the friends and family who had it and couldn't believe it was that simple to mix from scratch.

I used 1/2 tsp pepper and it was way too much, all you could taste was pepper.  I'd go with 1/4 tsp if your pepper is finely ground (like mine is).  I also agree to cut back on the seasoned salt.  Overall a good recipe in a pinch if you need ranch dressing and have no mix on hand.

Excellent. I as well used this mix for dip, and was just great for hot wings and carrot sticks. And good to have it handy, because it ran out like that, so it was good I can make as much as I need as far as I have milk, vinegar and sour cream available.  And, just to try, I added a  little mayo, it tasted like the bottled kind!!

This recipe was a life saver for me...  I was making an Antipasto pasta salad for a dinner party and could not find the packet version in my pantry (sure I have a secret pantry thief, as over this last week I had a move around and now, can't find a thing!!!).  The only thing I will say is that I halved the amount of salt, and found it a little on the salty side.  Would have liked to have added dill weed, but didn't have any.  In future I will be making this, rather than paying $1.50 from the grocery store!

I made this to use as a dry seasoning in another recipe because I didn't have any store bought ones on hand. It was kinda gross, all I could taste was the thyme. Didn't taste like ranch at all! Maybe it was because I didn't add the mayo & buttermilk to turn it into a dressing....but it just didn't do it for me at all, sorry :(

I had fallen out of love with "Store bought" Ranch.  It didn't taste good to me anymore and has so many preservatives.  However I love to get house ranch when were at a nice restaurant.  Until this one all other recipes that I tried have not been good. I LOVE THIS RECIPE and my whole family does too.  Even my husband loves it : ) !

Not quite ranch, but good nonetheless. Next time I'm going to use kosher instead of seasoned salt, and I'm going to try adding dill weed, as someone suggested.

Have made this twice now.  Added the dill as others had suggested.  And used only sour cream as I had no buttermilk.  Was a big hit as a dip with veggies and with pita chips.

I am trying to eat healthier but I love the ranch in the stores so that is sort of what I am going for. This was missing a flavor I have not yet pin-pointed, maybe just the preservatives; sadly however, it just didn't do it for me.

Very good recipe! I just added an entire pint of low fat sour cream,I took other suggestions and added some dill weed, made the dip taste outstanding!  Now I just have to find recipes to use up the rest of the buttermilk!

This has to be the yummiest homemade ranch dressing that I've made from this site.  It's sooo much better after it's been in the fridge for at least a day.  Next I'll try this as a dip.  Thanks.

This worked perfectly!  I didn't have thyme, but didn't miss it.  This was a lifesaver!!
