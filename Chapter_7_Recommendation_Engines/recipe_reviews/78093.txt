My family loved this!  I couldn't find cranberries so I used rasberries.  I think if I do that in the future, I may wait until 1/2 the baking time is over to add them in.  We did add a tsp. of vanilla and sprinkled cinnamon on top, but this was definately a winner.  I cannot wait until cranberries are in season to try it with that!

These were so easy to make and absolutely delicious! My family has asked me to make these again soon!  The only addition I made was to sprinkle cinnamon to the tops before baking.  Wonderful!!

GREAT RECIPE THE ONLY ADDITION I MADE WAS TO ADD APPLE JUICE INSTEAD OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM AND TO SPRINKLE WITH CINNAMON!

We loved these. I had read another review that suggested using apple juice instead of the water. I didn't have any apple juice, but I did have more than enough orange juice so I used that. They turned out so delicious! Mine fell apart during the last 15 minutes. I read others saying that they "exploded". A friend of mine said it would be normal for them to collapse like they did for me, but suggested if I wanted to them to sit up pretty (like in the pictures) to maybe take them out after 45 minutes. Regardless, these were absolutely yummolicious, and will definitely be made again!

I don't know if I'm just too dumb for this recipe or what...

I read somewhere that if you plan to reheat baked apples you shouldn't cook them the full time or they'll be disgustingly mushy. SO I cooked these for about 45-50 mins. They looked great. I heated one up in the microwave and it was wierd... The skin refused to come off or be cut and I ended up stabbing the thing with a grapefruit spoon and biting it like that. The taste was great, but it was really messy and dumb looking the way we had to eat it. It's probably my fault, but I don't know what the dea was...

This isa great recipe!  I used rasberries instead of cranberries (they are more easily available) and they came out great! I also added some cinammon as recommended by other reviews, and that was a great touch.  Will definately make again!

I am not sure if I did something wrong, but my apples blew up in the oven (!) leaving me with very unattractive piles of applesauce. I used Cortland apples instead of green (none at the store) and re-hydrated dried cranberries (fresh were not at the store either.) I re-hydrated them by boiling the dried cranberries in lemon juice and just a touch of orange juice and spiced rum before stuffing them in the cored apples. I didn't peel the top third of the apples (because the picture didn't show that, but I realize now the photo was submitted by someone else.) I just wasn't happy with the end flavor (besides the blowing up part), just too sweet, but perhaps it just lacked the tartness of the fresh cranberries. I don't plan to try this one again, but it could be due to my unfortunately necessary alterations (I was making this for a specific holiday dish or else I would have just made something else.)

This was fantastic and it DID make my kitchen smell amazing! I made some changes: instead of brown sugar, I used more honey. Also, I didn't have fresh cranberries, so I used dried ones, soaked in hot water, and also some raisins treated the same way. I spiced it up with a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg. It was PERFECT and my neighbor who never speaks to me asked if he could have one of the apples (I live in a dorm so we share the kitchen) :D

They took so long to core without a corer and all the basting, what a waste of time. Seven adults and 3 kids and not one person cared much for them. The texture of the apples were spongey and the cranberries were to tart. No one ate more then 2 bites. No wonder you need 6 scoops of ice cream. Something is needed spruce these up.

These were absolutely DELISH!  The cranberries really made a difference in this recipe.  You must use cranberries to have the tart and sweet mixture...divine dessert after a scrumtious steak dinner with friends.  I too followed other's recommendation and sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking the apples.

Very nice in taste and appearance -- I prepared exactly as recommended.  Because of the basting required, my apples probably could have used another 15 minutes for easier cutting through with just a fork or spoon. Beautiful dessert.

This was an excellent dessert.  I used some of the suggestions other reviewers made such as using apple juice instead of water and adding some cinnamon.  The apples I used were Granny Smith apples and I did add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to serve.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious! I made this for me and my roommate and it was a huge success. I used cinnamon and a few drops of vanilla as suggested before baking and just a little bit of vanilla ice cream. The mingling of the flavors was extraordinary, I'll definitely make it again.

The cranberrys were tart, not sweet at all. The brown sugar, honey and water combo did not add much flavor or sweetness at all.

Simple and delicious. A couple tips - remove more than just the core, make something more like a 3/4" hole so you have more room for stuffing them with cranberries! Also, don't skip the step for removing the top third of the peel, I forgot it and my apples sort of exploded out of their skins. They looked funny but tasted great!

I was making this after a long day of baking other things and it was getting late, so I did the sauce up in the microwave. It turned into a thin caramelly liquid, which I doubt would have happened if I had followed the dirrections. We didn't have apples, so I used pear halves and put them face down in the juices and bastes their backs with the juices. I didn't have cranberries or raspberries either, so I left them plain and served with vanilla ice cream with cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top. Nothing like the original recipe, but it was really yummy!

Very good, but I did do a few modifications.  First of all I mixed raspberries and cranberries, I also added a bit of clove and cinnamon, and last just a little chopped walnuts.  Was great.

This was really tastey and easy to make!  We didn't have much selection for a filler, so I tried Strawberries.  I learned they don't bake well and loose all their color.  I'm sure cranberries would be better, but either way it was still really yummy and everyone enjoyed it.

This is the only cinnamon-free baked apples recipe I could find (one of my friends has an allergy) and I am so glad I used it! I followed the recipe exactly, except I did add a dash of vanilla to the water as previously suggested. Soooo good!

Really fantastic! I reduced the recipe for 1 apple without any trouble. I added a few dashes of cinnamon to the honey mixture and melted the honey and brown sugar in the microwave for 1 minute at 60% power. Since I was in a rush I baked at 400 for 45 minutes and the apple and cranberries were cooked through and the syrup was nice and caramelized.

I made these baked apples last week and was extremely pleased. I did make a couple of changes by using real maple syrup instead of the honey. I also added a few soaked golden raisins in with the cranberries.  I also used a suggestion I read on another review. I used apple juice in place of the water. 

I loved the addition of cranberries. It added a nice tangy flavor to offset the sweet of the apples. I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic.  Nice, sweet after-dinner dessert.  The only thing I would change would be to put in less water than the recipe calls for.  I didn't have an apple coring tool.  I didn't trust my skills with a knife, so I altered your recipe by slicing the apples instead and cooking it together.  I provided a picture.

These tasted really nice. I could not find fresh or frozen cranberries since it is off-season for the berries so ended up using Craisins instead. Since Craisins are already sweet I reduced the sugar just a little. The amount of water seemed too much to me so next time I make I will reduce the water a little also. I think covering with some foil about half way through baking would be a good idea since I found the tops of my apples were getting overcooked and causing the flesh of the apple to boil out through cracks in th skin resulting in a very wrinkly looking end product.

Very good! I topped it with "Fruit Crisp Topping Mix" from this site! It definitely had the "wow" factor!

I added blackberries instead b/c I had no cranberries.  I also did not have ice cream so added a smear of cream cheese on top.  AMAZING! I love how easily adjustable this recipe is....make 1 or many!

First, I don't have an apple corer so that part was extremely difficult.  If you don't have one, get one before attempting this!!  Don't skimp on your cranberries, either... the ones I bought weren't very good.  The apples, however, were VERY good and with the right utensils, this would have been incredibly easy.  My family loved it as dessert for Thanksgiving!
