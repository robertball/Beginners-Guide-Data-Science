Because I love mangos, apples and cashews this makes a not bad side salad.  Next time I might just use lime juice instead of vinegar.  The vinegar makes the cashews lose their crunch after sitting for awhile.

Really Good. Next time, I would cut the mango cubes as small as the apples, and instead of balsamic viniger, I would use sugar and water. It gets really good when you let it sit so the cinnomin softens

Unique and delicious! The balsamic vinegar accentuates the natural sweetness of the fruit and keeps this salad from being too artificially sweet. It tastes like you are eating a slice of pie without the crust! I made it for a party and both the adults and kids raved about it.

An absolute hit -- great mix of fruity and crunchy. I used one tablespoon of orange champagne vinegar and one tablespoon of sugar water (2 t. sugar melted in 1 T. water).  I served it at a party and everyone loved it. Love the combination of sweet mango with sour apple.

This had good texture but the flavors didn't quite meld.  It also was a little tart for my taste.  A little too much cinnamon.  The recipe was interesting but didn't quite hit the mark.

This is a fantastic salad!  I used one medium sized ripe mango, 1 medium gala apple, unsalted cashews (already toasted) and the rest of the ingredients as listed.  Mixed it all up using a tupperware container (it's really convenient to just close the lid and shake!) and refrigerated for 1 hour to let the flavours combine together.  My bf and I loved it and will definitely be making it many more times.

Make sure to use a good balsamic vinegar, as it can make or break this recipe (5% acidity is a good rule of thumb).  Very quick to make and tastes good, if weird.  My bf liked it.  I threw the mixture, minus the cashews, into a Tupperware container (like another reviewer), shook it thoroughly, and stuck it in the fridge for 15 minutes.  Add the cashews right before serving so as to keep their crunch.  I also cut the mango into the same square shape as the applies.  Cut the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp, which was a good idea.

This was great! I was skeptical at first, but it really works. I used a nice balsamic vinegar "Fini" and it turned out perfect. Served with white rice and Asian Lettuce Wraps. I'll make this again.

OK, I hate to review something as five stars when I modified it, but the basics of this is great! I think that the apples, mangos, and balsamic vinegar alone is amazing! Then what you choose to add after that is up to you. I used a pinch of kosher salt and that was it--no cinnamon or ginger--and it was absolutely perfect! I substituted walnuts for the cashews, and after toasting, I added them to each serving rather than the salad so they wouldn't get mushy. Yum yum!

This is so good. An usual combo that works well. I add some cran-raisins for extra color and taste! Made it for many events and lots of compliments.

This was very good. It's one of those dishes that's hard tp\o stop eating.  I did wishthere was a little less cinnamon as it seemed to over power the dish. Other than that, super tasty. Oh i did put mine in the frdge for an hour before eating.

I HAD to make this because the ingredients seemed so weird. Wow, what a surprise - this was really good! I made it with a slightly underripe mango and white balsamic vinegar. Next time, I'll cut back on the ginger and cinnamon. Thanks!

What a strange little salad! I used 2 mangoes and 1 apple. I liked the textures in this salad, but I'm not so sure its a great combination of flavors. I doubt I'll be making it again, but it was fun to try. Thanks!

This was awesome! The flavors were really great together - I wanted a side to go with potstickers and found this recipe. I let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes (much better than eating right after making). **TIP** Don't mix in the cashews until you serve it...just sprinkle on top. Then they won't get soggy. Very unique flavors that actually go quite well together!

This is an absolute keeper! If your mangos are not quite ripe yet, try adding a splash of maple sirup! It works wonderfully with the cinnamon! I also added some olive oil.Cottage cheese makes a nice addition as well. Thanks a lot for this fabulous recipe!

Really wonderful and easy! Refreshing and different. I make this often. I use jarred mango in the produce section to cut down on the time.

Very different, but good.  Gotta say the it could look "prettier," the Baslamic Vin. gave it all a brownish color, (atleast you couldn't tell the apples were starting to brown).  Unfortatily my mangos were pretty tart, so I had to add A LOT of sugar to sweeten it up.  I made it up the night before (which allowed for a nice melding of flavors) but added the cashews right before serving to keep them crunchy.  The cashews definitely make the salad. Definity will make this one again, once my mangos are ripe and sweet.

While very yummy indeed, make no mistake - this is dessert!!  Everyone loved it, but I feel it didn't belong WITH dinner.
