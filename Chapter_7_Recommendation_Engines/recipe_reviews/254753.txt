I live here in Brazil and these are a quick way to use LEFTOVER rice, and since rice here almost always has garlic, onions and other spices, they always turn out great.  So those who think the cakes are too bland it's simply because the instructions are incomplete.

These were awesome! I used gluten free flour, which threw off my liquids. After adding an extra egg, I finally added a bit of milk to help out. So, if using gf flour, only use 1/2 cup of gf all purpose flour. I also added some cayenne pepper to the mix. I served them with sriracha/sour cream mixed together. Thank you for the recipe.

I have to say, I was not overly impressed with these Fried Rice Cakes.  I made them as directed and got about 20 ping-pong-sized balls.  I found the taste very bland and they really could have used more seasoning (some garlic for sure).  Because hubby was away the night I made them, I ended up with a bunch of leftovers that no one ended up eating.

Really good concept, but needs adjustments. Skip the parsley because you wonâ€™t taste it. Add chopped mushrooms because yum. Reduce the amount of rice to other ingredients ratio. And dip it in honey mustard mixed with soy sauce and lemon. Fun tho, very filling. Feeds two people comfortably.

Very thick and dense. Dipping sauce necessary. Next time, I would try to make it fluffier and add some kind of meat. Sausage would go nice in this.

These turned out very bland and not much taste at all. We will try them again, however, I think we will spice them up a little.

We made these for my daughter's economic summit project. They are delicious. We added a little garlic and onion for more flavor and it came out great. I'm definitely going to try this again sometime. :)

These are pretty good.  I happened to have some cooked rice in the fridge that had some other ingredients in it but I went ahead following the recipe exactly.  These rice cakes would make a nice appetizer for dinner.  Certainly easy and quick.  I made half the recipe and got 6 rice cakes.  Had them with a ketchup and horseradish dipping sauce.
