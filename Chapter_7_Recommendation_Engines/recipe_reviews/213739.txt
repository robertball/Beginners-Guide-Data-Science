My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a few changes - As pork loin can be a little too lean - I brined the pork. I don't usually buy Stovetop stuffing but I did have a bag of Mrs. Cubison's Cubed Stuffing.  I made the whole bag of the stuffing - used some in the pork roast and served the rest on the side.  I sauted the apples, dried cranberries & pecans as well as adding 2 stalks of celery and half a chopped onion with 1/2 a stick of butter.  Used about 1 1/2 cups chicken broth to make up the stuffing.  My pork loin was really thick - rather than trying to pound it thin I laid it on it's side as directed and sliced to within a 1/2 inch of the other side, laid it open like a book and then from the center of the roast sliced it both to the right and again to the left - folding back the meat.  I ended up with a nice thin rectangle of pork.  Spread the stuffing on the pork and rolled it up like a jelly roll.  I didn't need to tie mine with kitchen twine.  I notice that most recipes for pork roast call for cooking to 160 degrees....which can lead to dried out meat.  I cooked mine to 140 - 145.  Let rest while I made gravy out of the pan drippings (which were beautiful).  Final internal temp. was about 150.  Served with baked potatoes, green beans and Cranberry, Apple Apricot sauce.  Delish!  Thanks for an inspiring recipe.

We loved this roast and have decided it will be our Chrismas Holiday meat dish. I followed the recipe with the following tweaks: Brined pork overnight. Did NOT trim fat from loin. Increased water to 3/4 cup. Added 1/4 cup applebutter to apple, cranberry, pecan mixture. Increased chopped onion to 1/3 cup. Sauteed chopped onions along with 1/3 cup diced celery in 1 tablespoon butter to add to stuffing mixture. Stirred stuffing mixture into apple/cranberry/pecan mixture. After spreading the stuffing on the loin and tying in a roll, I quickly browned in 2 tablespoons olive oil; and placed in roasting pan to bake. I removed the roast when the internal temp reached 145 degrees. Covered with tin foil while I made the gravy from the pan drippings. This was probably the best pork loin roast I've ever eaten . It was so moist and had great flavor. It tasted like the best comfort food you could have. I served with sliced oven roasted sweet potatoes, applesauce and sour dough rolls.

Tried this last night-was excited as we love the taste of apple and pork but this was just so-so. Found the recipe to be on the dry side, and if I make it again, I will not use the chicken stuffing mix but perhaps only bread cubes-the chicken flavoring gave the stuffing an odd flavor which we did not care for.

I have never made a stuffed pork loin before the directions were very easy to follow. I made my own stuffing using rye bread sauteed onions and carrots to which I added the dried cranberry, apple and chopped pecans; I only had spiced glazed pecans but they worked. Instead of water I used apple cider from a local cidery to deglaze the pan. I added this finely diced rye bread and seasoned with thyme, savory, salt and pepper. I made extra stuffing following hints from other reviewers. Rolled and tied I seard the pork loin on the stove top then cooked in a 375 degree oven... This was a big hit with the whole family and I'm pretty sure I will have to make it again, and willingly the recipe is very easy to follow and can be adapted easily to personal tastes.

This was very good, but I did make my own stuffing as I just couldn't wrap my head around chicken stuffing with pork.  I did include the cranberries, pecans and apple in the stuffing.  I also did not trim my fat for cooking.  I used a bit of applejuice to moisten my stuffing and glad I did, I think it would have dry.  I served it with a sweet potatoe mash and green beans

Excellent recipe!! My family loved it, and they are very picky when it comes to pork.  I did do a bit of tweaking but not much.  I brined the meat overnight for a juicier roast.  I used pork flavored stuffing mix and 2 different apple types (Granny Smith and Gala).  I also cooked a tube of ground breakfast sausage and added it to the stuffing (a stuffing tradition in our house).  The roast turned out extremely moist and tender.  This dish will be repeated many times.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this today using a seasoned cube stuffing mix prepared with onions and celery sauteed in a stick of margarine - I added the diced apple and some chicken stock and then poured all over the stuffing cubes.  I added the dried cranberries which I had plumped up in a little hot water and then mixed all together.  I spread some of the stuffing on the pork roast which I had prepared according to the directions and then seasoned with salt and pepper.  I then rolled up the roast and browned it in a little canola oil on all sides and then roasted to an internal temp of about 145Â°.  I covered the roast with foil and made a gravy out of the pan juices.  The remaining stuffing mix that didn't go into the roast was put in a casserole dish and baked during the last 20 minutes of roasting the pork.   I've become a huge fan of cranberries in the stuffing.  This is definitely a company worthy main course which I will be making again.  Hubs isn't the biggest fan of pork but he does eat it.  He loves stuffing so that helps.

We enjoyed this! I followed the recipe for the most part but used Peppridge Farm Herb Seasoned Cubed Stuffing (made as directed, cooled) and added a 1/4 cup chopped celery in addition to the other ingredients (For other stuffings I would sautee but don't with a chop recipe I have so thought I would follow the recipe on this). I tied it up every 3 inches, then basted with a Maple/Dijon baste of 2 heaping tablespoons Dijon mustard to 1 cup real maple syrup and did so every 15 minutes. I have a convection oven so I backed off the temp to 300 after the first 15 as I was concerned it was cooking too fast and would be dry. Removed from oven about 150 temp and let rest. My husband said it had a nice flavor and enjoyed it.

This was good, made a great Christmas dinner.  One hour was a little long.  My pork was a bit over cooked but good none-the-less.  Will make again!

A very good and impressive dish.  I made a whole package of seasoned cubed stuffing, but the extra in a baking dish and served it as a side dish.  I added some sage to the stuffing and lightly dusted the outside of the loin with it as well.  I baked the loin in an elevated roasting dish and made gravy out of the drippings.  Added some onion powder and garlic powder to the gravy to make it a bit more robust.  I plan on making this again but will experiment a bit.  Will cook up some wild rice/brown rice mushroom stuffing  and try that.  Something just a bit more earthy and less sweet.

I loved this stuffing!  I should have taken Baking Nana's advice and prepared the whole bag!  This made a beautiful presentation, and I may do it for a dinner party soon.  Along with the apple, I used equal amounts of cranberries, pecans, onions, and added 2 stalks of chopped celery.  I also brined the pork overnight.  Since I had no apple juice on hand,  I used water as the liquid in the stuffing.  It had plenty of flavor!  Thanks for the idea!  I served it with fresh steamed broccoli, tossed salad, and potato rolls.

This was great. Made it for Christmas Eve dinner. Our friends loved it.  Make more of the stuffing to serve extra. There was no leftovers.

I only gave this 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly (I added a cranberry glaze, also found on this site).  The stuffing was excellent though, and I'll definitely do this again.

Absolutely fabulous!   The flavors worked so well together and the slow cooking made for a tender, juicy inside with a flavorful crisp top layer.  I took a suggestion from Baking Nana and sauteed the onions, apples, & cranberries in a little light butter.  I also added some celery for additional flavor and used low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  Definitely will be making this again!

Pretty good.  Left out the nuts because I didn't have any and used crasins (cherry) because I had just enough left in a bag and that's what I had on hand.  The apple and cranberries were ok in the stuffing but it would have been just as good with just the prepared stuffing.

I make a very similar recipe using apple and sausage  enhanced cornbread stuffing. The process of butterflying the pork loin roast is very nicely explained. Well done!

Everyone RAVED about this dish Christmas Eve. Mods I made are:  used pork tenderloin, and rather than use a packaged stuffing mix, I used Essential Bakery gluten free bread, fresh thyme, dried marjoram, Better Than Bouillon - Chicken added to the water, along with the called for ingredients in the recipe. I also roasted it with the Cranberry Burgundy Glaze (also on this site), and had some on the table for guests to pour on top. Accompanied the meal with roasted squash, Breaded Brussels Sprouts, Green Salad with Cranberry Vinaigrette (the latter two on this site as well), and a Zinfandel. I'd read 4# for 8 guests (bought 6# for left overs), but only went through 2 1/2# with the other dishes, so I'd probably only get 3 pounds next time.

I had some rye bread that was getting stale, so I used that as the basis for homemade stuffing to which I added sauted onion, apple, celery and a link of hot Italian sausage.  I used apple juice and butter to moisten the stuffing.  I baked half the stuffing as a side dish.  I basted the whole roast with apple juice 3 or 4 times while baking (about an hour)  I served this with roasted cauliflower, string beans and mashed potato. Somehow, I never remembered to buy cranberries, so they weren't used.

this was good, I left the apples and cranberries as a side condiment and stuffed the pork with homemade stuffing. Roasted for 1 hr and the juices ran clear so I took it out and let it sit covered for 10 minutes. Tasty, cook times will vary with the thickness of the pork loin. So glad we 911ed this recipe.

I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible. There are only the two of us and I had several pork tenderloins that needed to be used so I went with that. I removed all visible fat and cut the pork length wise and pounded it to 1/4 inch thick. I had no stuffing mix, never buy it, so I used two cups of cubed ciabatta bread. I soaked the cranberries in hot water to plump them up, recommended by another reviewer.  I sauted the apple, onion, pecans and cranberries as well as two ribs of celery. I stuffed the the roast and rolled it, tucking in the edges and tied it with butchers string. I seared the roast in one tbs of oil and finished it off in the oven for approx. 30 mins to a temp of 140. Tented it for 10 minutes. There was far more stuffing than needed, my error, so I buttered an ovenproof dish and baked it. The stuffing adds a whole lot of flavour to the pork and the presentations is so very pretty. I will be making this one again, thanks.

I made this for Christmas dinner. Replaced pecans with roasted pumpkin seeds. Also made extra dressing to serve along with roast. It was excellent.
However, I found it had a better flavor (fuller and richer) when left-overs were reheated the next day...and the day after. The next time I make it I will cook it a day in advance then reheat it wrapped tightly with foil.

I used thick pork chops instead and sliced them in half so the stuffing could cook inside.  Then I garnished the top with whole berry cranberry sauce and chopped walnuts.  It was a HUGE hit!

I tried this recipe tonight! I didn't have pecans so I used almonds, and used scallions since I was out of onion. It came out wonderfully w/ the sweet potato mash side I made. I'll be having this for lunch at work on Monday.

Very easy and very delicious!  Will definitely make this one again.  I left out the pecans (because I forgot to buy them), and it was still great.  Everyone (even my picky daughter) enjoyed this meal.

Thank you Allrecipes.com!

Loved this dish!! The only thing I did differently was searing the pork loin before roasting. I like the color. I also basted the loin with a cranberry/apple/butter sauce while roasting. My family loved it. This was quite a large loin so I had to use bakers twine to keep it together. It was too large to fit on the roasting pan lengthwise, so I curved and tied it, to fit. It was easy and elegant. I will definitely do it again.!!!

This was a different way for me to fix pork and I and my family enjoyed it.  I would probably not toast the the pecans next time or leave them out entirely.  I just didn't care for the toasted flavor w/ the pork.

This was tasty...  I left out pecans because my kids are not fans of nuts.. *shrug*.  I would recommend softening up the apple and onion before mixing it with the stuffing.  I had crunchy apple and onion, which wasn't awesome.  It would also be real nice with a gravy of some sort... Chicken gravy would even be good...  I was thinking of an apple cider reduction...  Something.

I think the stuffing need more moisture. I would have liked to have coated the outside with something to give it more flavor.

I pretty much followed the recipe, except I added some extra water because I was afraid the stuffing would be dry. It was absolutely delicious!  Tried it later with some pork gravy, but actually preferred it without any.   Yum Yum

This was SUPER easy to make and made the whole house smell amazing!
I paired it with roasted baby gold potatoes, chopped onions and apples and cranberries and chopped walnuts. 
There were no leftovers!

This has become my go to for a dinner party! Delicious, hard to mess up and beautiful presentation! I use reduced fat craisins. I also deglaze the pan and make a pork gravy on the side which really adds to it.

We loved it. It's simple to make the stuffing and to assemble. Our loin was already in two parts so I had to tie it together more, but that didn't hurt anything.

It was easy to make once I got the meat trimmed and used the mallet to get it ready. The stuffing was easy and I liked all the ingredients. I would make it again.

the only change that I made was using seasoned glutinfree breadcrumbs. The roast was wonderful but I think that I over cooked it as it was a bit dry. I purchased my roast at Publix where I work and the butcher cut it for me and pounded it to 2 inches. Saved me a lot of time. They will do that for anyone.
Just loved the stuffing.  I need to ask a question regarding ribs made in a slow cooker maybe someone can help me. When they are cooked in slow cooker they do not come out browned like in your pictures. What am I doing wrong?

I had to cut the thick loin as described and then make a second cut to get it thin enough to get fully cooked in the time allowed. I did not use string, just propped the loin against a second one and had minimum loss of stuffing. Fed 7 adults who raved about the flavor and tenderness.

I added celery, and used the whole 12 oz package of Pepperidge Farm  stuffing, herb flavored; added more of everything to make extra stuffing mix. Also made a pan gravy from the drippings with flour, water, splash of gravy master, and a healthy splash of white wine, salt, and pepper. reduce by half. Convection roasted to 150 degrees. Seared the meat at 400 degrees for 10 min. reduced temp down to 325 for remainder of cooking. Got a nice golden color around the meat while maintaining a nice moist interior. Not bad for a Wednesday night meal. Wish I had a crowd to please with this winner, but the family most certainly enjoyed this treat!!

This is a beautiful recipe!  I used this as the base idea for my Christmas dinner with the family...  the only difference is I used fresh cranberries for the stuffing (I boiled them in orange juice until they "popped" [approx. 15 minutes - and drain the OJ!]), and instead of using twine and putting the pork in the oven, I wrapped the tenderloins in bacon and grilled them at 350 until the bacon appeared done (approx. 30 to 45 minutes - check with a meat thermometer prior to serving!).  This is admittedly a hybrid of 2 recipes I saw (the other was on "Flip my Food with Chef Jeff"), but the preparation of the pork and the stuffing recipe listed here is spot on!

Be sure to treat outside with oil or something, and test cut before resting. Ours cooked for 1.5 hrs, temp 162, still very pink. Outside was starting to dry out.

I did change a few things. I used cornbread stove top added water and melted butter. I also dotted the stuffing with butter before rolling up. I also used wood skewers instead of twine to hold together. I also cooked it to 145 took 2 1/2 hours for 6 lb roast! My husband loved it!

Although this recipe was good, my family & I are more into seasonings & spices rather than a sweet taste. But if that's a taste you like I would definitely recommend this. It is very juicy & moist. Very tender & the cranberries compliment it nicely.

I am new to the cooking world, and i have to say this recipe was easy and fun to prepare, my husband loves it, so i will be making it more often. Next time i will have cooking twine, i used toothpicks this time (it worked).

We had this for dinner tonight. It was easy to make, few ingredients needed. I used 2 pieces of tenderloin and pieced it together with long tooth picks. I might add a gravy/sauce to it next time, but it was tasty as it was.
