WONDERFUL! Here are the changes I made which really improved the flavor:
1 1/4 cups sugar instead of 1 cup
2/3 cup or coco powder instead of 1/2
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

On the directions I changed it to 3-4 heaping teaspoons per cup.  DELICIOUS - makes wonderful gifts when you put it in jars and add a ribbon.

This is an awesome recipe! I doubled it and mixed it 2 cups at a time in the blender, to make a finer mix. Perfect proportions of all ingredients. I'm going to do gifts of this, a cocoa mix and a chai tea mix. Thanks!

This was a good alternative to just regular hot chocolate and a nice change from the regular coffee rotation.  I would make this again around the holidays.  Thanks Rebecca.

I am so happy to have found this recipe. I hade one very similar and lost it when we moved. I am delighted to have found it again. This mix makes a wonderful gift and an easiy way to add some flavor is by using the flavored creamer mixes. I love the hazelnut and irish cream flavors. Placed in a mason jar and toped with a swatch of festive fabric and twine will be one of my holiday gifts. I also serve this 1/4 cup mix for every 8oz of hot water.

Delicious and easy to make.  I did double the amount of instant coffee as it had very little coffee flavor.  Also, I used dutch processed cocoa for it's mild taste.  This would be great as a gift for a teacher, etc.  Just fill a cellophane bag and put it in a cute Christmas mug.

Coffee flavor was a bit too strong for this mix but ended up having to use 4-5 Tablespoons, not teaspoons, to get any mocha flavor.  Not sure I'd do this again.

Excellent recipe, not too sweet and would be good with water or milk mixed in. I did replace the sugar with the wildly popular "made from sugar" substitute and it is yummy!! Thanks!

I made just 6 servings to try. It wasn't quite sweet enough so I added 1T &1t of powdered sugar. And mixed with skim milk.One reviewer above added more sugar and cocoa powder so I upped it a little. Very good my 7 year old tried some and even liked it.

I think this is great. I used Splenda for baking instead of the sugar and it was very good but not quite sweet enough. The first time around I made the mistake of using cocoa I had in my pantry for awhile and it did not taste very good. But, I tried again with fresh cocoa, added a little extra coffee and splenda and it tasted great. Much cheaper than my General Foods Mocha!

This time I made these changes:  1/2 C coffee and 1/3 C cocoa.

Tasty but not very coffee-y. I added a bit more after tasting a cup. 2 1/2 T made a good tasting mug for me.

YUM! I am not a coffee drinker, so I used my neighbors as "guinea pigs" to test this out. They both LOVED this and said it tasted like an expensive specialty / mocha drink from Starbucks!!! They convinced me to try a sip and I also loved it! Admittedly, the coffee flavor was a *tad* strong for my liking, but then again, I am not a coffee drinker. Unlike other reviewers, I did not find this lacking in sweetness at all (it was spot on for me). I left all ingredient proportions as is. My only change was to add a teaspoon each of ground cinnamon (per submitter's recommendation) AND vanilla powder because I love both. :) Since I am giving this as gifts, I added a c. of mix to holiday themed cellophane bags. I then dipped jumbo marshmallows in melted Andes mint chips and dusted them with peppermint snow. After they "set," I inserted a skewer thru each one and packaged 4 of them in another cellophane bag (turned upside down). I wrapped everything with a festive ribbon, two candy canes and a gift tag (with instructions printed on the backside). Because I prefer a creamy, chocolatey mocha, my instructions were to add 1/4 c. mix to 1 c. warm milk and top with a marshmallow! I can't WAIT to try this (with a minty marshmallow) myself!!! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Rebecca! This is an easy, economical gift with a big WOW factor that I will turn to time and time again. :-)

I printed it as 2 serving sizes and had to triple that to get 1 mug of milk to be flavored enough! I think real mocha's have much more chocolate and coffee flavored! I guess it's fine for an quick easy fix. It was kind of lame compared to a fresher mocha . I think I'll give it another chance tho.

2nd try: Alright, this is a lil tasty. Definitely not very coffee flavored! 2 TBS of the mix into a hot mug of milk flavored it enough.

I love this recipe!  I think that any recipe with chocolate benefits from a pinch of salt.  It brings a great "depth" of flavor.  Also, I prepare mine with milk instead of water.  I think this is fantastic!

This hot cocoa is easy to make and yummy! We stopped buying the packaged stuff at the store once we found this recipe. You can customized your hot cocoa mix by adding in crushed peppermints or other flavors!

I did a half-batch using ½ cup sugar, ½ cup dry milk, ½ cup creamer, 1/4 cup cocoa, and I used 3 TBS instant coffee instead of 2 TBS. I heat a large mug (around 12 ounces) of half-water, half-milk in the microwave for 80 seconds and mix in 4 slightly-heaping teaspoons, and it is fabulous! It gets sort of frothy after stirring... Nice for a cold, rainy day! Thanks for sharing, Rebecca!

I thought this tasted pretty good. The powdered creamer can definitely be tasted, but I find that with all of these mixes. Maybe, a flavored one would be better? I used the calculate button and changed it to 11 servings. It ended up strangely making enough for 3 servings though, at 3 leveled Tblsp. per drink. So, the full recipe would actually make about 18 drinks. I made the small amount just to try it first. The good part, was that I could use instant decaf instead of regular. On road trips, it is hard to find the flavored coffee/cocoa drinks that are caffeine free. This tastes a lot like those drinks that come out of those machines near the regular coffee. It also, more likely, has much less sugar. I figured the 3 servings, I made, came out out to be about 2 tsp. of sugar each. I am certain, the same ones I am talking about have at least 3 times that much sugar.

If you're looking for a mix that tastes great with just water, this isn't the one for you.  Tried 3 tsp mixed with 5 1/2 oz hot water - way too weak.  Tried 2 T mixed with 8oz hot milk and it was good. But it was more of a chocolatey flavored milk drink then.  Not bad in a pinch, just not what I was looking for.  TY so much for recipe.

Let me start off by saying, this was good.  Now, I didn't give it 5 stars because although I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers (I added 1/2 c more sugar, increased the coffee by 1/8 c & added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon), I still felt like it needed a little something.  I also measured out the sugar a day before & added 2 tsp. of vanilla and let it sit out until it dried.  I think this added a nice touch but I still think it was missing something.

This was delish, but I used 2 cups of powdered goats milk in place of the 1 cup of powdered milk & 1 cup of powdered creamer to make it more natural with no trans fats and no preservatives, this made it nice a creamy

I added more coffee and sugar as suggested by other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  We also added 1 tbsp. of raspberry syrup and that was even more delicious!  We might try almond or peppermint syrup next time.  We'll definitely be making this again!

This mix is really good.  The only thing I would change is I will add a little more sugar next time.  A little more sweetness would have been nice. Another thing I did was when the mix was stirred I used my coffee grinder to make the mix well mixed and very fine and powdery.  It worked great!

I did add more coffee to my drink but I love it. So much better than the premade mixes.

I add pumpkin pie spice (you can find how to make it here on AR) and add cayenne pepper for a good hot chocolate that is truly hot

I changed this recipe a bit to make it more like a European hot chocolate which isn't as sweet as we're used to in the US.  Instead of the granulated sugar, I used Ghiradelli Sweet Ground Chocolate and Beverage Mix (available from Amazon).  I didn't use the powdered milk.  So, equal portions of the sweet chocolate and unsweetened cocoa.  The kids may not like it as much, but I love the fact it isn't as sweet as any of the ready-made hot chocolate powdered mixes we can buy here.

Not quite what I was looking for.  I will try adjusting the recipe and see what happens.  I like the idea of cinnamon.

I'm sure it would have been good as-is, as it was a good base, which is why I'm giving it four stars. I did follow some suggestions in the review section and I increased the sugar by 1/4 cup,  the coffee to 1/3 cup and the cocoa to 2/3 cup. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I have to say that hint of cinnamon really pushed it to a five-star level -- I was skeptical at first but wow, it was good. Also, as others noted, you have to use about a 1/4 cup of mix to get a good flavor. I made these for gifts; next time I will be sure to save  more for myself.

I used powdered sugar and put everything through a sifter, made the mix very homogeneous. Try flavors of powdered creamer.

My changes were 
250g white sugar
86g cocoa powder
120g milk powder
70g non dairy creamer
10g instant coffee granules 
  1) combine together and blend till fine powder in a blender. Stir 1/4 cup unpacked mixture into 250ml heated milk and stir. 
 
  Recipe taste good with milk. But with hot water, it taste absolutely terrible! I had to dump the hot chocolate water cup away! Later, I microwaved 250ml milk in the microwaved and stirred in 1/4 cup (unpacked) chocolate mixture in. Tasted so much better! Plus do not double the coffee flavor especially if you're making these for children. The coffee taste was definitely too strong which put even me, a coffee lover, off! Also, please do not feel greedy and make yourself more than one cup as it is extremely chocolaty and will taste terrible if you overdose the drink. :)

Oh so good! Thanks for the recipe Rebecca.
I don't drink coffee, so I really like having something else besides tea and hot cocoa. Followed recipe like stated with the exception of increasing the coffee slightly.
