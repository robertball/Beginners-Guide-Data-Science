It was very simple and easy to make.  The sweetness and the onion flavor threw the taste off. Overall, it was decent, but I won't really make this again.

This is an easy and fun recipe. It's a quick recipe that you can make for yourself in your free time. Also, the salsa tasted really good.

Good but kind of bland. I added a small can of diced green chiles to make it more savory and add a little zip. Also some canned cord for color and texture.

I wasnt too sure about a cooked salsa, but this was great! I used up some tomatoes and peaches from the garden that were gonna go bad, so this was perfect summer time treat! took to a nieghborhood potluck which everyone loved!

Turned out very good, but I added a little diced green pepper (as the picture showed either jalapeno or green pepper, I thought) and a little red pepper flakes. I will make this again, especially because it only calls for honey rather than cups of sugar like some recipes.

6.27.18  Added just a little chopped jalape√±o to kick it up a notch.  Delicious served over grilled Alaskan cod.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
