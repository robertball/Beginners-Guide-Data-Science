The whole family liked this salad so much we had seconds! Since I made it for lunch it served 4 not 8.  I made one change. We didn't have kidney beans so I used garbanzo beans instead. I only gave it four stars because of this. The vinaigrette with the olive oil seemed strange to me, but I was glad I followed the recipe because it was great! Simple and easy to make for a quick lunch since I had leftover cooked lentils. Definitely making this again!!

An interesting flavour and texture mixing kidney beans, corn and lentils. I cooked the lentils in a pressure cooker for 10 minutes instead of in a saucepan as directed. I don't know what balsamic vinaigrette is, so I just used balsamic vinegar. I will leave out the sugar the next time. Make sure the lentils are al dente to achieve a nice balance of texture as well as flavour. I used French Green Puy lentils but imagine that brown lentils would work just as well here, making it even cheaper lentil salad. :-)Thank you kelly for your recipe.
