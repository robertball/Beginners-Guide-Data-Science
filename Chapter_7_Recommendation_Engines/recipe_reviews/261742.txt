While I prefer fresh herbs, I used dried as mentioned in the footnotes because that is all I had. With that being said, I think using fresh would be perfect as written but if using dry, I think it needs more than the recipe calls for. The vegan mayo seemed to overpower with the dry. Still a good recipe and one I plan on making again using fresh herbs. If nothing else, fresh parsley.

Made the recipe as stated except that I only had dried dill.  It was fine but fresh would have been better.  I used Best Foods vegan mayo which I think is really good.  I really liked this ranch dressing.  It has a lot of flavor.
