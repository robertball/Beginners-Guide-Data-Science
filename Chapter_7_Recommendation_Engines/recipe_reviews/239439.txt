A definite keeper!  Serve this at your next brunch instead of a quiche and you'll have a crowd pleaser that just happens to be gluten free.   The flavour of the egg and quinoa go well together as does the texture of the two.  Quinoa has that nutty crunch to it that makes this a dazzler in your mouth; like eating a sparkler on the 4th of July.  Seeing that the submitter wrote to add any vegetable and cheese I wanted, I did.  I used tri-color quinoa.  I then added 3/4 cup mix of grated zucchini, red bell pepper, shallot and carrot.  I had to sub a soft cheese (robiola)  because it's all I had.  Mine came out a bit bland and can see where a more robust cheese like feta would be the right type.  I also used 5 cocottes each having a 1 cup capacity and filled them only half way as instructed.  These yielded 2.5 cups of "batter".  Seeing that I used more veggies than required I can see where 6 normal muffin moulds would hold the original recipe batter.  As you can see in my picture, they didn't fill up completely upon cooking.  Cooking time took about 22 minutes and the veggies were cooked completely as was the egg.  They served nicely with a beet and spinach salad.  You gotta try these!  Thanks for sharing.  UPDATE:  Left them in the fridge overnight.  Next day I made a sandwich out of one (on a ciabatta roll), tossed it in the briefcase and it's delicious at room temp as a panino.

I mixed this up by adding fresh thyme, spinach, cherry tomatoes, vintage cheddar cheese, an extra egg and sun dried tomato paste.  Took 35 minutes cook.  Yummy.  Makes 17 in muffin cases.

Turned out great! I used one cup of vegetables, including green and red bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, and broccoli. I also used cheddar cheese. Spices added include salt, ground black pepper, garlic powder and cayenne pepper powder. We have a powerful oven, so between two trays, one set for 23 minutes and the other at 20 minutes; the latter prevented the egg from drying out. While I was at it, I added chia seeds, because why not! I love how versatile this recipe is and can be. I would recommend it in a heartbeat. Thanks for sharing!

This is a swell idea. I subbed sharp cheddar for the feta and omitted the thyme (thought my toddler would take to it better). I also added garlic powder. Seemed like a good one to double, and it was a good call, original recipe doesn't make a ton, and you definitely want your muffin tins more like 2/3 full. Great after 23 mins (high altitude). Best at room temp, just like with quiche. Thanks!

I have made this twice now and both times the muffins turned out delicious! The first time  I added 2 chicken apple sausages.  The second time I added 2 italian chicken sausages.  Both times I used fresh thyme and tripled the veggies.  I used shredded carrots, spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, bell pepper, and onion.  I substituted egg whites from a  carton for 5 of the eggs and used 2 whole eggs.  I stirred in red pepper flakes and didn't use any salt due to the sausage. I also substituted 1/4 cup shredded fresh romano and parmesan blend for the feta. This is a great recipe to customize with different veggies and cheese combinations based on your preference.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks for putting it in the magazine or else I probably would not have seen/tried it.

These quinoa muffins came out amazing!! I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup chopped cherry tomatoes, 1/2 cup shredded zucchini, 1/3ish cup chopped spinach, 1/2 of a yellow bell pepper, and 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. I also added parsley and basil to taste. This combo gave me an amazing Italian quinoa muffin. Definitely will be adding extra salt and pepper next time because I did not put in enough, apparently a lot goes a little way in this situation! Loved this recipe, thanks so much for posting it! :)

I made these with two cups of finely chopped vegetables: red peppers, broccoli, red onion, zucchini, cherry tomatoes; and two cups of cooked quinoa, and seven eggs.  I seasoned it with chopped fresh basil, parsley, and thyme, one large clove of garlic, and salt.  I used regular muffin cups sprayed with olive oil, but they still stuck. Next time I will use foil. I cooked it for 23 minutes.  They were great!

Great idea. I doubled it with red onion, monetary jack cheese and some mashed avocado. I would like to maybe try some lowfat cottage cheese added too. Very good with avacado tomato or ketchup as a quick snack, work well in mini cups or big ones baked for 15 minutes.

These turned out awesome! I added orange bell pepper and some cooked bacon bits on top.  I also added some red pepper flakes to spice it up. Great for work, very filling.

Just saw it and made! This was very delicious. The dish did remind me of a quiche, as mentioned in the previous review. Very flavorful, going to share with my family. Could be poured more that half in the muffin container (3/4 filled)  There was some left over after filling 6 pans half way and the pans had a lot more space.

Love the versatility of this recipe!  FIrst time I made the recipe as is, 2nd time used a hot curry powder , 3rd time a Asian/ginger spices, endless possibilities.  I also used a mini muffin pan and cut cook time to 10 minutes or so, it made so much more crispy edges to eat that way!.  I also used a variety of cheeses,  the combinations are endless.  These are  yummy, filling and holds hunger at bay.  Cannot wait to finish eating what is stored in the freezer so I can make them again with different vegetables.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

I thought these were pretty good.  Cubed cheddar cheese was used in place of the feta.  Garlic powder and liquid smoke flavoring gave the flavor I look for in a breakfast muffin (BACON!).  Let them cool before removing from the tin.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used cheddar cheese instead of the feta but was disappointed because the thyme totally overwhelmed the dish. I made them to grab something quick on my way to my deer stand at 5:00 AM and one of these will hold me to 10:30 AM when we get back in for brunch. Am making them again today without the thyme because I can see the potential for a filling low-calorie breakfast to help with my diet.

Incredible flavors and so easy to make, my new favorite side dish.  I followed the directions as written and was amazed with the results.  I like to make my quinoa in a cast iron skillet starting with a little olive oil, then brown 1 table spoon curry powder, 1 tsp. of coriander, 1/2 tsp. cumin then add vegetable stock, 1 tbsp. honey then the quinoa.  This adds such delightful flavor to my basic recipe.  I can't wait to make this again and will be experimenting with more vegetables.

I've made these twice now. By changing the cheese and sautering the onions and mushrooms adding some ginger and fresh parsley the flavor is completely changed and it's the same delicious nutritious breakfast or snack in food

I made it based on my own tastes as I find that with more veggie and cheese variety these are more savory.  Mine had aged cheddar and vegan mozzarella in them, I also used mixed spices. Really enjoined the result and my 18 months old loved them too - so kid approved for sure! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Almost had the right ingredients, but subst. some garlic pow, 21 salute seasoning and dried chopped onions and added extra mushrooms, so my muffin cups were filled to the brim. But, they barely rose, so it ended up being perfect. Very tasty, and easy to make :)

First, let me call out that these can be prepared and done in about 35 minutes if you happen to have cooked quinoa sitting in your fridge when you start.  If you are like 98% of households who don’t keep cooked quinoa at your fingertips, it may take another half-hour to cook and cool it.  (Small detail.)
That being said; if you DO keep cooked quinoa at your fingertips these come together REALLY quickly.  I followed the recipe as directed, though admittedly I thought spinach was one of the ingredients and had added a ¼ cup before I realized that it is nowhere in the list of ingredients – no harm no foul.  There was no “half full” with the cups.  I did use liners and they were full to the top (I don’t think a ¼ cup of spinach made THAT much difference.)  I baked them for about 24 minutes.  I was worried that the onion wouldn’t soften while in the oven but that was not a problem.
They smelled like heaven as they were baking and could barely wait to let them cool a bit before digging in. The recipe recommends greasing the cups (versus using paper cups) – I would encourage following that guidance.  These are not traditional muffins so it doesn’t pull away easily from the paper.  For those unfamiliar with feta it is salty, so you don’t need a lot of salt in addition in my opinion.  I will probably keep the spinach and add red pepper or shaved carrots to add some color in the future.

I made this recipe last week.  Any breakfast muffin recipe that eliminates all or most empty carbs (wheat, rice or potato flours)  catches my attention.  I cook with quinoa routinely, but just saw this recipe for the first time last week.  For me, it needs work.  They filled us up well enough, but I was disappointed that they did not have enough overall flavor.   I will keep trying new additions to this recipe in hopes that I come across a keeper that we look forward to eating for breakfasts now and then.

Very good. I have to be honest - I had to make a lot of substitutions due to using only what I had on hand. If anything, though, it proved to me how tasty and versatile this recipe is. I had to sub in couscous for the quinoa (has slightly less protein as a result), used pepper-jack cheese, added diced ham, onion, and broccoli. It all turned out wonderfully and the pepper-jack gave it nice kick. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it came out a tad bit dry/spongy. I'm at an elevation of 7200 feet, so I think the dryness is just me needing to figure out the proper baking time.

Substituted basil for thyme, as I'm not a huge fan of thyme.  These were delicious.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

Surprisingly delicious. You can change this recipe in so many ways. I cooked the mushrooms and onions in butter first and used cheddar and parmesan because I didn't have feta. Turned out great! The second time I made them I cooked up bits of bacon, mushrooms, garlic and red onion. I used 1.5 cups quinoa and 5 eggs. Even better!

While these turned out beautiful, I wish the recipe would have asked for more spices. It is a bit plain. I would add some mustard powder, more thyme and definitely more salt to the recipe for next time.

I made these muffins and added green peppers and garlic.  Was very good and tasty however the thyme was a little overwhelming.  Won't use time next time

I tripled the recipe & got 24 muffins. Boiled the quinoa with a  bouillon cube for some extra flavor. Also sauteed onions and mushrooms in butter, as still waiting for quinoa to cook. Tasty and easy. Word of warning: Unless you REALLY know your pan, get these out of the cups pretty fast. The first pan didn't stick. The second one had issues.

It was a little bland for my taste, next time I would add additional seasoning like Italian or dill. I added red pepper and zucchini and used sharp cheddar instead. Would probably increase the cheese too for my personal taste.

There are many things to like about this recipe. It was relatively quick and easy to put together. The flavors of the ingredients worked well together. The concept allows for different accent ingredients to be freely substituted.
That being said, there was simply not enough egg in the mix to hold it together and give it the rich egg flavor it deserves. If I were to make it again, it would have at least 5 eggs per cup of quinoa.

I used goat cheese in place of Feta as i find feta to salty for me.
I forgot to put the thyme in but they were still very tasty.
I used red quinoa. I like the fact that these are grab and go  when you are busy and don't have time to sit. 
Thank you for the recipe..

I made these with frozen chopped Swiss chard as that was the only veggie I had on hand that day and added bacon. Didn't have any thyme, so omitted that. They were DELICIOUS!!! The two leftover ones went in the fridge and I ate them for breakfast the next day. This time I'm making them without the bacon and adding the Thyme for a friend who doesn't eat bacon. They're in the oven now... hopefully the thyme is not too overwhelming as one of the other reviews had mentioned. Update: the ones with 1/2 TSP Thyme were overwhelming, so the next batch I dialed the Thyme back to only 1/4 tsp. Much better. I do prefer it without, but I did add a dash of mustard powder and horseradish powder for a little zip and those were good too.

Loved the fact that it is so easy to make. I used spinach, chopped up sundried tomatoes and added a tablespoon chia seeds to the mix instead of the mushrooms and onions.

These turned out really nice. Great use of quinoa. I just made 1/2 cup dry quinoa which yielded 1.5 cups cooked. Used herb and garlic goat cheese instead of feta. Will definitely double the recipe next time. Great recipe for mixing up your own flavours too...will play around with it a bit next time!

A bit bland.  My toddler and preschooler loved them, I will be trying again and adding bacon or garlic to the recipe for some more flavor.  Great idea though!

Very good stuff - my first batch I used shredded carrots and zucchini instead of shrooms and onions. Some comments indicated a lack of flavor so I added about 1 tsp of fennel pwdr, dash of salt and pepper.  In preparing the quinoa, I added about 1/4 cup of chia mix and 3/4 cup quinoa to 2 cups water and by mistake used the whole portion in my muffins - it made 12 muffins AND and I chose to not add the cheese, no reason, just cuz! NOTE, remember to allow your quinoa to cool so you don't cook the eggs upon adding the quinoa to mixture.  Flavor was really yummie - in part due to the chia, added a nice texture, and the fennel - thanks!!

I found this recipe by accident and decided to try.  I thought it was great.  I added an extra egg only because I wasn't measuring the veggies and sort of went overboard.  It also made 12 muffins for me and I am very glad.  I just had some for bfast and they are so good.  I had made these a couple of days ago and was craving them this morning.  I also made a sweet version with apples and cinnamon.  Also good but this is my fav!  I will be making these again!!  Thank you ehagan!
