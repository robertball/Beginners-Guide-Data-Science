We love lace cookies, and so I made these for family members who need gluten-free desserts using King Arthur's Measure for Measure flour and Quaker Oats Gluten-free oatmeal.  I used a small cookie scoop which is a little larger than the teaspoon that is listed in the recipe.  I think the teaspoon would be better.  As it was, I got 30 cookies, and I baked eight to a sheet of parchment on my 18x12 cookie sheets.  I wish I had cooked them for just a touch longer, but it doesn't matter because they were gone by the time everyone left the house.  Thanks, Dustin, for your grandmother's recipe!

Use parchment paper instead of foil.  And use a very sparingly amount of dough, because they spread out considerably.  Very easy to make and delish.

I made these for a pot luck and they must have been good. They were all gone. I followed the recipe but doubled it. Parchment paper liner is the only way to make these. Also use only 1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon of dough and leave lots of room for the dough to spread.

I made these cookies, they taste great, BUT the directions say to bake them on foil.  It didn’t say to spray Pam first.  
My cookies stuck to the foil and broke into a million pieces.
Next time I’ll either use parchment paper or spray the foil

I made no changes. The recipe works great. These wafers are delicious! Two items of note.  1.  They don't keep well. Plan to serve them the same day as made. They wilt and get sticky.
2.  That teaspoon of batter you dropped on a cooking sheet will spread out 3-4 inches. If you don't want to cut them apart, leave plenty of room. However, they are pretty easy to cut 
and separate before they cool.
Definitely use parchment paper!!

These were simple and so delish!  I did have one problem and would like to know if anyone else had the same. I can only bake two trays (of 6) at a time. The batter waiting to be baked thickened up and the cookies didn’t spread and become as lacy. With the last batch I tried adding a bit of water but that didn’t really help. Anyone?

I could not stop eating these cookies.  Everybody loved them.  I think parchment paper works better than foil.  I use air bake pans which take longer.  I had to bake them for 13 minutes.  I made a couple test cookies.  Did not bake them long enough and they stuck like crazy.  Make sure they are quite brown, especially on the edges.  Use a small teaspoon and keep them far apart.  They are going to spread out A LOT.  But that is the charm of this cookie. If too close, you will get the big blob that somebody else commented on.  But you can still eat it!!!

Easy batter and tasty but a bit tricky to bake and get off the cookie sheet in one piece. DON’T use aluminum foil-the cookies stick but you can let them cool, then peel them off...but not very ideal. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT try to spray a cookie sheet and then bake them.....you will never get the cookies off the pan. It sounds like others have recommended parchment paper which I will try next time.

These were delicious. Hubby gobbled them all up. They did spread out quite a bit but no problem. We just tore pieces off.

Delicious! A similar - and similarly crisp - cookie with the wonderful flavor of toasted sesame seeds is the Benne Wafer. Mixes up in just a few minutes all at once in one bowl. allrecipes even has a recipe for them. The link is: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11215/benne-wafers/

They're delicate and luxurious.

I followed the recipe exactly and as many other reviewes stated the aluminum foil does not work. after the first pan full I used parchment paper which worked well.  We didn't care for the taste, it was bland. I added some cinnamon and that helped some but it is not something  I will make again.

I made several changes, after running a "test" batch in my oven of course.  The first batch was Very runny.  So, I added 1/2 cup more oatmeal and then before baking I gently pressed each cookie with a sugar coated glass bottom so that they cooked evenly.  then they came out very nicely.

These are delicious and incredibly easy to make. I found that I had to bake them for about 12 minutes and I did find that parchment paper worked well and the cookies stuck less to that than when I used the foil.

Not the greatest cookie in the world. To buttery and sugary. Most likely will not be making this again.

I made this twice.  The first time I had the same problem as some others (should have read the reviews first). The batter spread out and after cooling (as directed) they would not come off the aluminum foil.  Thanks to another reviewer these crumbs will be ice cream topping.  I lost at least half of the cookies.
I made it again, putting only 6 cookies on a cookie sheet and lining the cookie sheet with parchment paper.  This time they released okay but I had to bake them much longer than suggested and several burned around the edges before the cookie got to the desired golden amber color.  I will not be making these again.

Flavor was wonderful but the cookies spread out all over the cookie sheet pan and became a giant blob. Followed directions precisely but still a mess. Would have liked them to a least be partly round. Just broke them up and used them in ice cream.

Absolutely delicious! Just like the lace cookies I made many yrs ago, but lost the recipe.  I added × vanilla & some extra oats.  Next time I'm going to add lemon extract. I've done this before & they taste great & refreshing for summer.

To me it was a bit too thin but my husband absolutely loved it.  If I make this again I would add less butter or more oats so they do not spread out so much.

One of my favorite cookies.  Sometimes I add a cup of chopped pecans.
