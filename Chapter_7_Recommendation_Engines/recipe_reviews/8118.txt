This was super easy.  I could not find cranberry applesauce in the store so I mixed canned cranberries with applesauce. I am sure the use of the applesauce instead of oil makes the cake slightly lower in fat.  I anticipated the frosting being overly soft...but it wasn't.  I used it to frost the entire cake....and it held up fine.  I used the jellied cranberry sauce for the frosting not the kind with the whole berries....maybe this made the difference.

Excellent recipe! Everyone loved it-I decided to use 1/2 whole cranberry sauce and 1/2 jellied and I had no problems at all with the consistency of the frosting..It was so good in fact we used the leftover frosting on some other things.

This recipe was easy, but the presentation was a huge disappointment.  The frosting was much too soft to support the cake and went all over the place.

I used a regular yellow cake mix and followed the directions on the box.  I used a 9x13 pan.  I also added another 8oz box of cream cheese.  I did not increase the sugar.  The frosting was nice and firm and would work great for a layered cake.  I got rave reviews.  It makes a lot of frosting, so I cut up apples and served them around a bowl of the extra frosting.  My cake wasn't as calorie friendly as this one, but it was very good!

Really loved this cake, as did the rest of my family.  I added 1/2 cup of Craisins to the batter because I wanted more cranberry flavor and it turned out great.  The frosting is very soft but all I did was leave the cake in the fridge until I was ready to serve and the icing firmed up just fine.

Recipe is incomplete, no mention of water until directions. Frosting is soup, not "creamy or soft"

I thought the cake was very good and so did others I served it too.  I also felt the "frosting" was not very thick even though I did use the whole cranberry sauce, but I carefully spooned it on the first layer so it partially ran down the sides and did the same on top.  I did not use it all, so put the rest in a container and people could use more if they liked.  I'm wondering, since it calls for 1/4 c. sugar, maybe use 1/4 c. powdered sugar, if that would firm it up a little.  Might try that the next time.  A very pretty cake for the holiays.

This is a delicious recipe, great for Christmas or Thanksgiving.  One thing I found, the amount of water wasn't listed in ingredaints, si I started off with 1/4 c. water,and increased it little by little until it was the correct consistancy of cake batter-which eneded up being about 1c. total of water.

Here's a tip: add some fresh orange zest to the icing to add a hint of flavor that totally boosts the cake and lessens the weird cream cheese taste.

The icing was delicious. I had no problems with it running and frosted the whole cake. I couldn't find cranberry apple sauce so I used strawberry applesauce to give it that pink color. The icing has enough cranberry flavor to overpower the strawberry. However, I did have a problem with the cake not rising much. So it was a pretty small cake.
