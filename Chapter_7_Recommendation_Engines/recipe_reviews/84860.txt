This recipe takes me home to the beach, with a kalua plate lunch.  This recipe tastes best when allowed to sit in the fridge for a few hours to allow the flavors to merry.  Onolicious, broke da mouth!!

GREAT! I added a few capers, couple drops of lemon and lime juice as well. I then served them in cucumber cups. I just took a couple cucumbers and cut them into 1 1\2 in sections. Then with small spoon or mellon baller scoop out a hollow middle so it looks like a mini bowl, fill with salmon mixture and you have bite size apps! (Great recipe even without adding the capers, and lemon and lime)

This was by far my favorite food from Hawaii.  For those like me who have trouble estimating quantities in the grocery store, 2 cups diced salmon is about 12 oz (3 of the 4 oz packages was perfect).  I also did not have to add any salt because the salmon was plenty salty for me.  I eat this with tortilla chips, with pretzel or pita crackers, or on top of baked polenta.  It's a great snack alone with some good cheese and bread as well!

I'm used to the raw, minced salmon fillet so often used in Hawaii, cooked by the salsa. This one is also quite nice, and even more 'ono' with the addition of about 1/2 tsp of minced cilantro!

Yum, and healthy too! I used two small smoked salmons, and was surprised how much this recipe made. I made this a day ahead to let the flavors mix, and it turned out delicious. I served with Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker as well as Spam Musubi. Delicious hawaiian feast!

This was good. My family never had lomi lomi before but I've had it when I went to Hawaii or when  our tahitian dance troupe would have a luau. Real easy to make except I added cilantro.

This was a big hit as an appetizer at a recent dinner party. Very quick and easy to make. I served it with sesame and rice crackers. Also, it was really good the next day on top of a bagel and cream cheese. Great as a brunch dish too.

This recipe was good, but having learned to prepare this while living in Hawaii, the salmon needs to be raw (if you want to do it by Hawaiian tradition). I learned that there are variations of the ingredients to add or subtract. I prefer it with small diced cucumbers in addition to the mild, sweet white onion, diced green onion, and diced tomatoes.  You can experiment with the ingredients to your own liking. You can serve this with any kind of roasted pork. If you could get poi, I would recommend it (however, if you have never had it, don't buy it, because it takes getting used to.  Good cooking and MaHolo.

I never heard of cayenne pepper in this dish. Goes well with lau lau, kalua pig, and poi. You can also make a slider--taro roll, Kalua pig, and Lomi salmon. So good!!

This was great. I made two different versions of this (one with just salmon and another with a mix of salmon and crab meat), both of them were awesome. This was a great appetizer served with thin party crackers and tortilla chips at a recent luau party. Some guests added a bit of tabasco to the salad to give it an extra zing. Yummy! Even the kids loved it.

This was delicious!  The recipe doesn't say if the salmon is cooked or not so since uncooked doesn't sound very appealing to me I cooked it (20 min at 275F, salted w/ some butter pads on top). Then I flaked it and combined it with the rest of the ingredients.  I would use about 1/3 cup finely diced purple onion next time instead of the whole white onion.  Great way to use up salmon and want something new and different (if you happen to be like our family and have A LOT in the freezer).

This was a hit at our Luau dinner and made for conversation as most had never heard of Lomi Lomi before!  I used smoked salmon (and believe me it was plenty salty!) so it worked fine and probably added to the flavor.  Left out the sea salt but added rest of the ingredients as listed.  Served this as an appetizer with crackers and Tuscan kale leaves cut in 2-3" portions so the Lomi could be eaten rolled up.  The kale was the most popular and I felt personally really added to the tastiness of the dish.  Thank you Saxony for such a unique recipe.  Fun and simple to make.

This is a lovely and simple recipe. I just squeezed one lemon and a tablespoon of vinagre de Jerez, it come out so tasty. We loved it.
