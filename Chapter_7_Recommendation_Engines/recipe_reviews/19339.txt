Tasty little treats.  Something different compared to potato chips.  We sent some to our neighbors but got mixed reactions.  The kids loved them though.

These were just okay, seemed a little bizarre to me to have pasta as chips, especially with all that seasoning in there. Wasn't impressed with them at all.

made this for my kids and it definately didn't come out right, I tripled the seasoning...which is a must, and cooked it in batches of handfuls, either it came out sticking to each other or burnt.. won't make this again

These were actually really good! They were a bit time consuming, but nothing to deter me from making these again. However, I found it near impossible to get the seasoning to stick to the pasta. I had to omit the dry mustard since I didn't have any on hand, but I substituted a few other seasonings and it was delicious. I think I'll try to   experiment with different pasta shapes, and try to find a way to get the seasonings to stick. Thanks.

I must have fried them for too long. they had a wierd chewy, tough consistency. They were hard to eat. If fried right they would still not be fabulous- not enough flavor.

I made these over the weekend, using some leftover rotini from another meal.  We seasoned half of the pasta using the recipe above and half using just seasoned salt.  I seasoned it right after removing the pasta from the skillet.  We liked the seasoning salt better and it stuck better to the pasta.    It made a nice crunchy snack, although it is time-consuming.  I think it would make a nice addition to a party snack mix using a variety of ingredients including nuts.

I liked them, but they certainly aren't the sort of thing that everyone will love. It's a lot like trying a new flavor of Doritos. I used shells, which were great for eating but a bit difficult to fry. I also used grated Parmesan which had trouble sticking, but the shells did a great job of catching the flavor. But the really important change was I dipped them in marinara sauce. That was fantastic! And this is a great thing to do with the large amount of pasta-based meals I find myself living off of. (Haha college student off the meal plan.)

Wonderful!  I couldn't put them down.  I made them myself, though I used asiago instead of parmesan and shells because, well, I didn't check to see if we had farfalle and then got bent on making them.  They turned out really well, though the frying was a bit uneven, that was almost definitely my fault.  Aside from just not liking the flavor, I really don't get the fuss in the other reviews.

Dust the pasta with cinnamon sugar after frying.  Taco Bell makes these using dry rotini pasta.

It was great. I recommend using  a small pot of oil instead of the 4 tablespoons listed that way many can be fried at a time. I used vegan parmesan it was wonderful.
