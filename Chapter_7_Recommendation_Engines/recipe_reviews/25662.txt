This soup is amazing!!!  I made a few changes... I sauteed some oinions, garlic, and celery in butter forst before adding mushrooms.  I used shitake, portobellas and baby bellas. I pureed about 1/3 of the mixture at that point.  This really helped distribute the flavor throughout the soup.  I also substitued fat free half and half for the heavy cream.  It was so delicious!

This is a fantastic recipe, Colleen - thanks so much for posting it. The soup had a rich flavour thanks to the sherry and cream while the mushrooms had a buttery texture. Perfect as a meal when served with crusty bread. I made this for the first time tonight and just added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the melted butter before sauteeing the mushrooms.  I used low fat thickened cream and this created the perfect degree of richness for me. The soup only need a little cracked black pepper on serving.  I'm definitely going to be making this soup throughout the winter.

I am the only one who likes mushrooms in my family so I halved the recipe automatically.  I followed the recipe (also adding a little green onion for flavor) up to the chicken broth and then added only one can (14 oz.) of chicken broth.  I added the 1 cube beef bouillon as you would for the whole recipe.  I didn't have any sherry so omitted it and just stirred in the (1/2 c.) cream, cooking just until heated through.  Man, was it delicious!  It tasted just like what you would get in a fine restaurant!  Of course, making it this way cuts down on the number of servings so I have to say this would probably serve 2 to 3 very nicely.  To tell you the truth, "I ate the whole thing" all by myself!

I would give this recipe an all over 5 star rating except kids are usually not fond of mushrooms.  I liked it best with cutting the mushrooms into chuncks, or sliced.

Simply delicious . . . I used fat free half and half to replace heavy cream, and it was great.  Also sprinkled a little nutmeg on top when I served it.

Awesome recipe!  A few things I changed:  I like a thicker soup, so I doubled the flour.  Also, I have a hard time making anything savory without onion, garlic, and an herb of some sort. So, I added 1 finely chopped shallot, 2 minced garlic cloves, and about 1 1/2 tsp rosemary or thyme (I've made it both ways and love each herb in this).  This is one that my picky husband requests OFTEN!

This was a simple, great recipe.  I live very close to Kennet Square, Pa., and this recipe rivals their own!  added an onion and elephant garlic (sweeter) and used fat free evaporated milk mixed with Cornstarch instead to heavy cream!  Saved tons of calories without giving up taste.  Thanks Sadie!

This was O.K. but, it tasted more like cream of chicken stock soup than cream of mushroom.  It was easy, however; there is a reason you add aromatics.  I will stick to my old receipe from "The Joy of Cooking".    Will not make again.

This is a great recipe for a special luncheon. It looks like it took a lot of work, but it is a breeze to make. Best of all, my kids both loved it and my husband couldn't get enough. I also used the fat free half and half for part of the cream called for, and it was delicious.

I made this soup twice this weekend it is so delicious and easy. The only changes I made were to use half and half rather than cream and add some thyme and black pepper. On the second go-round I used only half the amount of cream (half&half) called for (trying to reduce my fat intake) and it was still delicious. I can't wait to try this with some of the more exotic kinds of mushrooms. (I used pre-sliced white button.) Thanks, Sadie!

This recipe was yummy and super easy to make.  It was easily adaptable according to what I had in the fridge and threw in some fresh spinach just to avoid throwing it away.

This turned out pretty bland and not very creamy in consistency.  I ended up adding some xanthan gum to thicken it up at the end, using an immersion blender for a moment to break up some of the mushrooms to release more flavor, and adding a bunch of salt and pepper before serving.  If I try this recipe again I will probably modify it even more by adding an onion with the mushrooms, adding salt earlier in the process, and letting it simmer for much longer to let the flavors meld.

Loved this!!!  Served to 25 ladies for a shower on a cozy October day and it was perfect.  I could eat this soup all day!!  I have frozen it and thawed/eaten twice and it is still amazing.  I used extra mushrooms and used dried onion flakes for ease and quickness.  Used both portabello and regular mush, could have used dried as well.  Will use and serve over and over!

This was very good; I did omit the bouillon cube so I added a little paprika, thyme and a dash of cayenne to jazz it up a bit; I also used a small package of dried porcini mushroom which I soaked and then pureed until fine.  I added them in when the mushrooms were almost done browning in the butter.  :)

I really loved this recipe, but my family didn't and they usually rave about everything I prepare. I think it was the sherry. I may make it again with Marsala wine, which has a nuttier favor. Perhaps, not so much wine either. Overall it is a good recipe.

Ok, I almost hate to give this only 3 stars because the flavor, as written, was wonderfu, but it was waaayyy too thin. Ended up making a roux to add to it to make it "creamy". So I tried it again, doubled the amount of flour to 1/2 cup, and YEA, perfect. Also needed to add some salt and pepper, but that's personal preference. I made it a third time, using the 1/2 cup flour, but used my home canned mushroom broth instead of the chix broth.....OMG, that was the bomb! I would definitely recommend this, but use 1/2 cup flour instead of 1/4 cup.

This was an easy recipe to make, although the time to cook it was a bit longer, given the ease of making it.  It tasted great, but as others have said, there was too much sauce and it was too thick.  Still, a good meal.

This is the second time I’ve made this soup. Since my daughter is vegan, I swapped out the chicken broth and used vegetable broth. I also add mushroom stock bullion. It really adds big flavor to the soup. Yum!

This is the 3rd time making this soup. I did follow someone else's suggestion by using 3 different kinds of mushrooms. Also added some pepper and salt. In addition I used organic chicken stock instead of broth.  Very easy to make and super good.

Very good!  I added 1/2 minced onion and 3 cloves minced garlic to the butter.  Once it was fragrant, I added the mushrooms.
I like it thick, so I made additional roux and thickened it at the end and simmered it a little to cut the starchy flavor and added about 1 tsp marjoram.
I also didn’t have sherry, so I used 2 tbsp brandy.

This was an amazing cream of mushroom soup.   I did add a couple of organic garlic cloves (they are more flavourful than regular garlic).  I also added a bit of dried tarragon.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.   Very delicious !

I used 2 large containers of mushrooms, browned in butter, soy sauce, sherry, white wine & salt.  Pureed all with 1 boiled potato.  Heated through with extra water, 1 scoop chicken bullion, 1 scoop beef bullion, and 1 block reduced fat cream cheese.   Added crunchy topping of crushed parmesan crisps, plain panko, italian panko, and bacon bits crisped in a teaspoon of butter.  Wow!  So good!

Sauté some oinions, garlic, and celery in butter forst before adding mushrooms. Shiitake, cremini, portos and baby bellas. I pureed about 1/3 of the mixture at that poinThis really helps distribute the flavor throughout the soup.

I needed cream of mushroom for Green Bean Casserole recipe. I found this recipe!

This was surprisingly easy compared to other recipes!! Simplicity didn't compromise the taste!! I'll never buy store bought cream of mushroom for my recipes when I can do it myself! 

I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted Plain Greek Yogurt & Almond Milk; Sherry with White Cooking Wine and I didn't use any cube bouillon or beef broth. I used  Superior Touch - Better Than Bullion - Vegetable Base.

I found this recipe to ask for too much sherry. Also adding flour into the mushrooms and then stirring in the broth was quite challenging (maybe it was the sauce pan I used), but I had to separate my mushrooms from the liquid to do it successfully. I would also use more mushrooms that just 1 pound next time, but I think I'll try a different recipe.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  Perhaps the issue was that I used low sodium chicken broth, so I needed to add worchester sauce and low sodium soy to spice it up.  I used no fat half and half.  The soup was too thin for my liking.  I had hoped for a thicker mushroom soup.  I'll keep looking for mushroom soup recipes.

i tried this recipe, using 1 1/2 lbs mushrooms, less broth and a bit more cream. the flavor was good, but very thin for a cream soup. i usually make COM soup from another old recipe from a cookbook i have, and i think i will stick with that recipe.

Wonderful soup! Easy to make. I didn't have sherry so I used a dab of cooking wine. Also didn't have nutmeg, but it still turned out fabulous! Even my daughter who claims she does not like mushrooms enjoyed it. Will definitely make again. We were given lots of mushrooms, so we made a huge batch and we're going to try to freeze some of the soup.

love this soup! thank you for sharing. I usually make just one thing different, and that is I cook the mushrooms as directed with a few ounces of white wine, Marsala wine is a good addition too, if ya don't have the sherry.

It was alright... It was very liquidy, so i added more cream and roux to thicken it up. I would probably say add more mushroom to 'take up more space'. It was very liquidy for the amount of mushrooms. Taste wise it was bland, but maybe that was because I added more creme. I ended up seasoning it onion and garlic powder, and adding a bouillon cube. I also sauteed onions and added them in which were delicious. The soup ended up ok, but my boyfriend only ate a couple spoons.
