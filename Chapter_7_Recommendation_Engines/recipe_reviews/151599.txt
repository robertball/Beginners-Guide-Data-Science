This is a good starter recipe.  I added about 2 tbs of soy sauce and ginger to the sauce and added carrots.  I also chopped the chicken into bite sized pieces.  I would have added snap peas if I had them to really give this dish an Asian flair.  Perfect to put over rice.

This was pretty good. It didn't have the exact flavor that I thought it would. I wasn't sure what kind of vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar. Maybe white would have been better? Anyway, it's a good recipe to have on hand, and it was easy and quick, but I'll play with the spices a bit next time.

Pretty good - my kids gobbled this up, always a good thing! I seasoned the chicken first with coriander, cumin, garlic, pepper and a bit of salt. I also used tomato sauce instead of soup (I never have tomato soup), and it came out quite nice. The sauce also goes over sauteed peppers quite well too. Thanks for a recipe I will use again.

This is a great recipe. I did not make rice. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted red pepper. I also added minced onion to the sauce (1/2 onion.) :)

Unique and very easy. I made the recipe exactly as it stands other than sprinkling a bit of cayenne to spice it up. We enjoyed it.

I absolutely loved how easy this is to make. I live in a house of men who want there food now! It really only took about 30 mins to make. I added a little more brown sugar than it called for cause I wanted it more sweet. It wen't really well with the rice. Everyone loved it.

We liked this recipe...very different from what we're used to. It could use a bit more flavor though, and after reading the other reviews, I agree adding some seasoning to the chicken would perhaps warrant a 5 star rating! Will definitely make again.

Very good. For over 40 years, I've been using the same amount of soup, vinegar and worchestershire to ground beef, onions and green peppers 
(cooked and drained) for quick sloppy joes. I never thought to try it with chicken. Nice, quick meal.

Too much vinegar! My husband hated the flavor. I thought it was ok. And my 3yr old daughter who loves chicken no matter what you do to it loved it! she ate most of it! She thought it was chicken with runny funny ketchup! And she loves ketchup! so one star is straight from my daughter! Maybe my husband and I just have too high of flavor palats!

Okay so I was searching for a way to use, leftover diced tomatoes, thawed boneless skinless chicken thighs and leftover cooked rice. I read all the reviews and started by saute'ed steaming carrots green peppers and onions, in the olive oil. Then I added garlic and ginger and the diced tomatoes. After 10 minutes I poured that mixture in a bowl and saute'ed the chicken- mixed it all together when the chicken wasn't pink. Doubled the sauce ingredients and added 1 T soy sauce and 4 T "stir fry " sauce cause it was there. A couple of dashes Franks red hot and served over hot rice with a side of steamed green beans. Thanks for the starting point it was delish!
