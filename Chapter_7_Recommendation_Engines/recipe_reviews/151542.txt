I made this recipe exactly according to directions only adding a teaspoon of vanilla to the cake part (I subtracted a teaspoon of water from the recipe so it wouldn't affect the outcome). I didn't have candy coated chocolate pieces for the top but I did have peanuts so I just went with the peanuts. Very pretty looking bar cookie and quite simple to make. My husband and kids thought this bar recipe was great. Very peanut butter-y. I think the chunky peanut butter and the peanuts on top made this recipe.
