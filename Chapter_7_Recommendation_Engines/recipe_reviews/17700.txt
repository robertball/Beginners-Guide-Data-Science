I LOVE this recipe.  I'm not so sure that my husband and son like the actual figs (though I do!), but the sauce and the tart lemon and beautiful glaze are winners.  I made a few changes from the quantities given.  First, I used a whole free range chicken, cut into 8 pieces.  The package of dried figs that I had was only 6 ounces, quite a difference from the 1 1/2 lbs listed in the recipe, but I sliced them into thirds and I had plenty of pieces to lay on the bottom of my pan.  I think any more would have been too much.  I used a large lemon, peeled, and cut into thin slices.  For the liquid, I used another very large lemon's worth of juice, and then, because apparently I can't retain an ingredient list from the time I walk from my computer to the time I get to the kitchen, I misremembered the amount and types of sugar and put in not only a quarter cup of brown sugar, but a quarter cup of white sugar as well.  Yeah, very sweet.  However, since my lemon was huge I just added another 1/8 cup water to compensate.  It was very good.  I used cider vinegar instead of white.  My chicken took about an hour to get to the color I wanted, and I did spoon juices over it, as well as spin the pieces up and over with tongs to re-cover with sauce, several times during the cooking. I served it with brown rice and collard greens.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a nice change, easy and healthy (except maybe for the extra sugar I put in!)

I tried this recipe twice, with very different results!  The first time I used chicken breasts, and our friends were late so I left the chicken in the oven for an extra twenty minutes or so... I turned the temperature down and covered it.  The chicken was dried out, of course, but the sauce was fabulous!  It had thickened into a sweet-sour glaze and the lemons were practically candied.  
The next time I cut the time short and covered the chicken to keep it moist, only to find the sauce had not properly cooked!  It was vinegary and runny, although the chicken was moist.
The first sauce is now legendary in our family, so I will try again, probably with chicken thighs this time, leaving the skins on, and cooking it for the full length of time.

I used 8 fresh mission figs instead of 1.5 lbs dried figs and they turned out great, if a little too sweet. I also used breasts instead of thighs, it turned out nice and juicy.

Maybe I was clueless, but I cut the lemon into slices, leaving the peel on, since the recipe did not say to peel the lemon first.  I think the sauce would have been very good, but the peel gave the sauce and chicken a very bitter taste.  Make sure that you peel the lemon first before putting it into the pan!  I did not have enough figs, so I used prunes as well, which I think would have been really good.  I may try the recipe again sometime, with that major change.

I followed this recipe as closely as I could.  I bought a 9 ounce package of dried figs and that was plenty. 1 1/2 pounds would have been way too much.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because that was what I had in the freezer.  My only complaint was that the sauce took a pretty long time to reduce to the right consistancy.  My husband and I really liked this.  A bite of chicken and a piece of fig on the same fork was wonderful.  I will definately make this again.

This chicken is just great!! I doubled the glaze mixture and came out perfect, I had to cover it with aluminium foil at the end of the cooking as it was getting too brown. 
I am Spanish and I cooked it for Spanish people who are quite reticent to "non-Mediterranean" food, they absolutely loved it. We served it with baked apples as a side-dish.

This is a really good combination of flavours.  I have made it a few times now; it also works with pork, and is really good sprinkled with goat cheese before serving

I really liked this. The flavor was great and so easy to make. The only think I would change is to use less dried figs. There were more figs than chicken! Really good though.

This was delicious! I was looking for a new chicken recipe that I could eat during Passover (alas, no bread... or bread crumbs), and I found one! I did double the sauce before cooking, which was nice because it covered the chicken almost entirely in my smaller container, leaving just the top skin to brown a little. I also cut the rind off of the lemon and only used 5 chicken thighs. In my haste, I forgot to top it with salt and parsley before cooking, but it didn't need it! A scrumptious sauce with nice and tender chicken (50 minutes is just perfect). Will definitely make again.

We thought this was great.  I did make a few changes...I used balsamic vinegar instead of white, fresh figs and thyme instead of parsley.  I also used a whole chicken cut into pieces.    Tonight, I'll probably add some cippollinas, because  I have a bunch.  I think sage would work well,too.  The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking. We garnished with crumbled a local goat cheese.  I served this with a Pinot noir.

This recipe was great and very easy!  I used legs and wings instead of thighs and it was very good.  I think the number of figs was a little on the high side and if I were to make it again I would probably use half of what this recipe calls for.  Further, I will cut them in half so that they lend more flavor to the sauce and chicken.

Good recipe for the sauce...  I did something different with the chicken.. I used boneless cutlets and stuffed them with goat cheese and fig, wrapped in prosciutto.  Once the dish was done, I drizzled it with honey.  It was spectacular!

I really liked this recipe.  After reading reviews, I made a couple of modifications: 1) I only used one 9 oz. bag of figs and that was ample, believe me - if you used all the figs the recipe calls for you would have more of a fig dish than a chicken dish. 2) I increased the lemon just a touch.  3) I used all fresh parsley, no dried parsley.  This came out quite tasty.  I'm glad I added a bit more lemon because the figs add quite a sweet flavor to the final product.  But I don't cook with figs often and I like to mix it up a bit so this was good.

I followed this recipe exactly.  It calls for WAY too many figs!  You have to LOVE figs to like this dish.  I think it would have been better with half the figs & chicken breast rather than thighs.  The sauce was very tasty.  I felt more like I was eating a fig dessert rather than a dinner.  The figs did cook very nicely, but it simply was too much.  My husband didn't care for this dish.  It was easy to make.  Expensive using all those figs! We buy all organic....

This is fantastic.  I followed the recipe closely except I used three packets of splenda and a few drops of molasses instead of brown sugar.  I will make this often- thanks for a great recipe!

I made some changes to this recipe, I doubled the sauce and used chicken breast instead of thighs.  I also reduced the temp to 375 for 50 minutes.  My husband did not like the combination of fig and lemon together.  The chicken was very juicy and tender.  I think next time I will use oranges instead of lemons.

Really good. I used fresh figs because that is what I had. Could use more salt. Once the chicken was cooked through, I poured the sauce into a saucepan and boiled it down to make thicker. I did not peel the lemons as some people suggested, and it was great. I served the chicken and sauce over rice. Will definitely make again since  I have a tree covered in figs!

This was very easy to make and good.  Depending on size of thighs, you need to double the glaze.  I did remove skin prior to cooking to minimize fat.

I did a couple of alterations to this splendid recipe. i added 1 spoon of flour to the sauce (otherwise it would have been too watery) and i added cinnamon and thym! And the master touch, i added a bit of a Fig jam in the sauce I loved it and i would be doing it more often!

This was tart and sweet, very good.  However, I made this with fresh figs and one large chicken breast.  There was barely enough sauce for this portion, so I strongly advise doubling or tripling the sauce if you want to put it on rice or couscous as well.

This was pretty good!  Subs: we used fresh figs from our backyard tree, apple cider vinegar, and chicken breasts.  Omitted the parsley, only because I forgot it!  The lemons and figs balanced nicely and the chicken was flavorful.

This was very tasty, a nice contrast of sweet and tangy. I used dates instead of figs in error and it was still good. I also used chicken breasts instead of thighs

With a few slight changes and one addition, I really enjoyed this recipe.  I live alone, so I only added four boneless thighs.  I'm a saucy-kind-a-gal, and I knew the extra sauce for this dish would be just fine.  I only used about eight California Mission dark figs, sliced length-wise into three, used only two small lemons, squeezed, and opted NOT to lay in lemons with the rind.  And then for a twist, when the sauce was a bit cooler, I added two heaping teaspoons of sour cream, shook it up in a dressing jar, popped it in the microwave for maybe a minute and poured over the chicken which was laying on a bed of rice.  Oh ya.  Totally yummy.

This was delicious, love the sweet and sour contrast.  I used skinless/boneless chicken thighs but plan to try this with pork as well.  I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch - just a pinch.  I agree that this recipe calls for a lot of figs - I used about 12 dried figs and sliced them lengthwise. Served with wild rice and asparagus. Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent! I didn't have lemon so I used a fresh lime, and added a splash of apple cider vinegar and some hot sauce. I also omitted the parsley. Everything worked beautifully together. I think lemon would be better but it was still fantastic.

I'll give it at least a Four.  I made it as written, except that I used fresh figs.  We have a gargantuan fig bush/tree in the back yard, and I needed to find something to do with all that fruit!  I just covered the bottom of the baking dish with figs and assembled everything else on top.  It was quite yummy, and the leftovers were even better!  We will definitely do this again while the figs are coming.  Thanks Kimber :-)

My entire family loved this recipe (3 kids & their dad). I used the ingredients for 12 servings of sauce for 8 chicken thighs and I used fresh figs instead of dried. I also substituted balsamic vinegar for white and skipped the parsley. After the chicken was done, I pureed the defatted sauce and served sauce in a gravy boat. This is great with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. My husband had the sauce over some leftover roast turkey breast the next day and loved it! Definitely a keeper.

I was not impressed by this recipie.  I love sweet and sour style dishes as well as chicken.  This recipie had a very unpleasant taste to it.  Also, the sauce was too runy to really eat with rice or noodles.  My father said it best, "it's ok for something different, but I wouldn't get it again."

This was delicious.  A great combination of flovours.  I had to bake it longer then recommended in order to get a nice golden skin, but that might just be my oven.  This is a wonderful change from an ordinary chicken dinner.

Very creative recipe and quite easy. My family really liked it. Figs are very nutritious and high in fiber so I was eager to try it. I halved the recipe. Next time I may make a little more sauce.

Mine was WAY too lemon-y.  I either used massive lemons which resulted in too much juice, or used extremely potent lemons!  Next time I would use less lemon and add lots of honey to the sauce!

My husband's reaction to this was "This is excellent - great flavors".  I didn't have dried figs and used fresh figs instead. I did have dried cherries and dried mango and added those along with the fresh figs. I also used chicken breast cut into strips. I will definitely be making this recipe again.  It is very easy and something that would be great to make for a dinner party.

Fantastic. We used bone-in thighs with the skin. We didn't have any parsley so we substituted the dried parsley for dried Italian spice blend. The sauce, with its figs and lemons, was fantastic. My husband, who claims to not like figs, enjoyed this immensely. We removed the chicken from the roasting dish and then returned the sauce, figs and lemons to the oven to reduce. Don't peel the lemon if you do this, as the entire lemon is delicious and edible. This is something that we will definitely make again, probably for dinner guests. Simply wonderful.

I just made this for my husband, the lemon lover and he flipped.  I do agree that 1.5 lbs of figs is a bit much and for us there wasn't enough sauce.  So next go around, I'll eliminate the vinegar and replace with more lemon, double the sauce and reduce number of figs. 

This still gets a 5 star in my book.  My tweaks are just for my family.  The recipe is AWESOME as is.

Having never eaten a fig before (and not knowing their flavor) I used only about 10 dried-then-halved figs. Also, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand. Fabulous flavor!  After the chicken was cooked I removed the juice from the baking dish and poured it into a saucepan, added 1T brown sugar and reduced the sauce to thicken it. When I make this again, I'll double the amount of sauce because it was THAT good :)

The delicate sweet/sour-fig/lemon flavor would have been great but the recipe called for too many figs and the sauce and thus, the chicken, ended up being too sweet for my taste. The sauce was also pretty runny. Has potential but not sure I'll make it again.

Okay.  My chicken turned out a little tough, but I porbably overcooked it.  The sauce was a little tart?  I also left the peels on the lemons and agree with another reviewer-- I think they'd have been better without the peel.  Even though I really like lemon peel.

Served this with couscous.  I didn't not like it, I thought it was good, but it wasn't the best dish I've made from here.

This simple recipe packs a lot of  flavor punch!  I thought I had a package of dried figs in my pantry but when it came time to cook, couldn't find them ... so I used dried apricot halves and it was delicious.  Double the sauce recipe as it's terrific served over rice!

It was delicious and my husband loved it. He said it was a perfect company dish!! 
I wasn't  prepared to make this recipe; however, i had just purchased chicken thighs and had to cook them this  evening.  I did not have lemons in the house, so i used RealLemon juice. I was only preparing just over one pound of chicken.  I used a 7 x 11 Pyrex pan.  I cut into thirds & halves enough dried figs to cover the bottom of the pan.  I also didn't have  Parsely.  But the results were very tasty. When i will make it for company, i will use chicken breasts, as well as freshly sliced lemons and parsely.

I would rate it a 5, except I modified the recipe.  I love figs, but the quanity of figs to chicken was too much, so I used 1/2 amount prescribed.  I doubled the sauce as others suggested and forgot the sugar and with all the figs releasing their sweetness into the sauce and so that's how I make this now. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white, and I think citrus vinegar (like from Trader Joe's) or balsamic would work just as well.

Added seasoning -- I added fennel powder and seeds. The fennel melded perfectly, for my tastebuds, with the lemon and fig.  

Calories -- for those interested - Without the sugar and the way I made it -- and I may be wrong, but I calculate the calories to be about 238 per thigh including a portion of the figs.  The lemon and all the fiber of the figs -- make this a really healthy dish with healthy natural sugars.

Great flavors and light way to bake chicken, plus very juicy! I did change a little because I only cook for 2 - used 2 skinless breasts, but same amount vinegar mixture and lemon slices.  i quartered 6 fresh figs and placed it all in glass loaf dish, 30mins @ ~375.  Loved the rosy color the figs gave off and tart/sweet combo. thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Sooo good. I used bone-in, skin on thighs and basted the chicken every 5-7 minutes. It came out perfectly juicy and flavorful. The figs and lemons were delightful.  I paired the dish with whole wheat couscous and fresh asparagus. My husband and guests were really impressed. I liked that I could make such a great tasting and looking dish without having to prep for hours.

For reasons unknown even to myself, I had a bag of dried figs in my pantry.  This recipe sounded tasty, so I tried it out.  I substituted honey for the brown sugar, used apple cider vinegar, and boneless skinless chicken breasts rather than thighs.  I'm very happy with how it turned out.

This recipe is pretty decent fresh when you first make it, however, leftovers leave a lot to be desired.  The chicken has excellent flavor, but the figs and lemon are overpowering for our family.

My husband told me that this recipe was the best chicken I have ever made. If that's not a glowing review, I don't know what is. The chicken thighs stay so moist. I took other reviewers suggestions to heart and lessened the amount of figs. The fig flavor was really not pronounced at all. Next time, I plan to make the recipe as written to see if I like a more intense fig flavor. Definitely a keeper!!

This was really good for dinner but, it did not hold up that well for lunch the next day. Rating only on dinner, I would give 5 stars. But, for lunch the following day it was difficult to eat. I would make it again without planning to take leftovers!

This had a unique taste to it, using thighs instead of breasts definately made this worth-while to make but, for my family, it wasn't saucey enough... the next day I ended up pureeing 3/4th of the figs in a blender with salt to taste & chicken broth and then spreading it onto the leftovers (of which, unfortunately, there were plenty of).

I did not care for this recipe. I believe the pith from the sliced lemons caused the sauce to become bitter.

I made this with boneless, skinless chicken breast and only 6-7 dried figs.  I tried reducing the juices on the stove before pouring it over the chicken and baking but it burned in the oven instead of forming a glaze.  Husband said that the chicken was ok but that the lemon/fig combo made the house stink while it cooked...

This turned out really tender and juicy and very tasty. I used only about a cup of figs (its what I had on-hand) and I tripled the juice because we like lots of it. I will use this recipe again for sure.

This was good- I used fig puree instead of dried figs, which simmered nicely under the chicken.  Could have more of a lemon flavor or something though- maybe something to offset the sweetness of the figs more.  Served with couscous and spinach for a nice dinner.

This dish is a cinch and it looks GORGEOUS when nicely browned and sizzling hot.  The only thing I would do different next time is to cut the rinds off of the whole lemons that I add.  It was a bit bitter b/c of them.  I did follow the advice to cut the number of figs in half.

This is a great recipe! I had a problem finding dried figs in a store, so I got a jar of La Cholita figs in syrup. I took the figs out and arranged them on the bottom of the baking dish together with lemon and lime slices. Now I did not waste syrup, so I decided to use it instead of brown sugar + water mix. In the same jar I added vinegar and lemon juice & poured over the chicken (boneless, skinless thigh cutlets). It came out really good! I had to adjust temperature (400 F was a bit too high, 375-350 F is better) and rotate thighs in baking dish 2-3 times during cooking time. Figs retained their shape and juiciness, and chicken formed a really nice dark red glaze on all sides. 
Lemon and lime slices can be taken out after chicken is done, if you are not a fan of lemon zest.

The flavors seemed to be fighting in this dish. The sweetness of the figs just didn't jive with the sour/bitter of the lemons and peels. I followed the recipe closely using boneless, skinless chicken thighs, but doubling the sauce as indicated. Being somewhat new to cooking with figs, wasn't sure about Mission vs. Calymira, so used half of each and reduced to about a pound. The chicken was moist and flavorful, the figs were tender, but had that strange taste combination and the 'glaze' was just a runny liquid that I poured over the rice I made to accompany. -May- try again with just lemon juice instead of sliced lemons and see if that gets rid of the strange bitter flavor. Will also try reducing the leftover liquid in a saucepan on the stove to see if I can get the rave results I see posted by others.

Yum!  This was super easy to make and it came out beautifully!  I used some leftover figs that I had on hand which was less than what it called for so I cut them in half and there was plenty for our taste.  I used chicken thighs with bone-in and skin on and it was really tender.

Heavenly! The BF couldn't stop eating it! I cut the recipe to accommodate 3 boneless, skinless thighs because, again, just cooking for the carnivores. I used fresh figs because we have a bumper crop this year, and I did cut the cook time down because of the amount of chicken in the casserole dish. I was so happy to find this recipe ( I'd swear I made it several years ago for my mother after we had picked some figs). Will totally do this again!!!

It was tasty and different.  The meat came out very tender and moist.  It wasn't the greatest chicken I have ever eaten but it was pleasant and provided a nice change up from chicken recipes I normally use.  I might try it again but with orange juice rather than the lemon.

I printed off this recipe years ago and finally got around to making it.  I wish I had made it sooner.  I served it to company and it was a hit.  I did double the sauce, as suggested and found this the right thing to do.  I used about 350 grams of figs (not even a pound) and that worked perfectly.  The sliced lemons were a hit.  I did add a bit more brown sugar mid-cooking as I found the sauce a bit too tart for my liking.  If I had packed the brown sugar in the measuring cup a bit more, it probably would have been sufficient; but, do suggest tasting mid point and adjusting if necessary.  I will definitely make this again.

This came out awesome, everyone loved it. I could only find small black mission figs, I used apple cider vinegar in place of the white vinegar. And used all fresh parsley and some orange thyme from my garden. I think I'll try bone in chicken thighs next time, as the boneless dried out a little in the thinner parts. It came out sweet and sour, and not overly lemony. I was a little unsure because I'm not really fond of lemon but this was good.

Loved this dish. Would definitely make it again but might cut the pith off the lemon as it makes it rather bitter. In fact would make it with juiced lemon and lemon zest next time and leave out the slices.  Served with green beans and rice.  Yummy.

This was good. I liked the sweet and sour combination. I used half the amount of figs the recipe called for because so many comments said to use less. It has a strong lemon flavor with two lemons. I'll juice half and slice the other half of just one next time. Five out of six people liked it in our family. They said less lemon next time though.

There was more than enough figs to go round. Next time I would halve the amount of figs as Im only making it for two people. Other than that a great tasting recipe. I used chicken thigh fillets.

This was great! My family loved it. I could not find dried figs, so I substituted a package of dried dates and it was great!

The chicken turned out nice and juicy. But, it didn't turn out to be as sweet as I thought and was hoping it would be. I may be too used to glazes and thicker sauces. I definitely could taste the lemon well. It was an easy, good dish to make.

I'm not a big chicken fan so I found myself surprised by how much I liked this dish. The chicken was very tender - I cooked both breasts and thighs because that was what I had on hand. I just took the breasts out earlier than the thighs, and it worked out fine. The whole family enjoyed it.
