Very simple and yet very delicious.  It smelled great while it was cooking; this recipe is definitely a keeper.  One gripe though: the zuccini got mushy, so next time, I'll throw mine in closer to the end of cooking time.  Otherwise, it would have gotten 5 stars instead of 4.

Good simple dish. I used baby portabellos instead of crimini but otherwise followed the recipe. Also didn't add the zucchini until the end (a couple minutes) to keep it from overcooking. Very nice combination of flavors.

I added more zucchini and used some diced hash browns from the freezer since I had no raw potatoes. I liked the oregano in this.. really good. I bet this would be awesome with some feta on top too

This is a new staple in the house.  It's easy to alter based on whatever you have on hand too.  It's really helped our family eat more veggies!

This was good, but the zucchini and mushrooms were a bit overcooked for our taste. Next time I will cook the potatoes about half way, then add the other veggies. I plan on adding some chopped red onion also.

Loved the combination of spices.  I added more veggies including green pepper, cucumber and yellow baby squash.

This is a good recipe. I don't like cooking potatoes forever in the oven as I don't usually have time. I liked that the potatoes cooked so nicely with the lid over the pan. My vegetables turned out good and were not burned (which is the problem I have sometimes when cooking potatoes on the stove. The only thing I would do is double the spices and maybe cut down a little on the oil.

I thought there was too much oil.  Everything else was great.  I would cut the oil in half next time.

I made the recipe exactly as it stated and it was under-seasoned, the potatoes were mushy, the zucchini fell apart into nothingness, and the mushrooms had no flavor.  Overall, it was a waste of my time and money to make this.

The family didn't like it. It was the first time we've ever tried crimini mushrooms. If I make it again I will stick with the white button mushrooms.
