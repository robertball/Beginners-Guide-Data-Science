I didn't know that my recipe was published! It has a few mistakes in it, such as "to taste" after the main ingredient, which is the pumpkins... I have no idea what this means. Likewise, I have no idea why the cooks notes refer to gluten free tumari. I don't even know what tumari is, let alone suggesting its use.
