These were wonderful tasting rolls.  They need to be baked in a deep muffin pan as they spill over. Make sure to place a cookie sheet under pan while baking. I used sliced toasted almonds instead of chopped - they were very good.

These almond rolls are fantastic!  I took them to a neighborhood coffee, and they were a huge hit.  I didn't use the butter, nuts and almond extract as a filling, instead I spread Solo brand almond filling on each rectangle, and then rolled them up.  Also, I sliced each rectangle into 6 rolls. (for a total of 24 rolls made)  I would think slicing them into only 3 per roll would make them too big for me.  I prefer a smaller roll since they are quite rich.  Watch the baking time.  By making them smaller, they took less time to bake.  Make sure to turn the pans over RIGHT AWAY when taking them out of the oven.  The brown sugar mixture hardens quickly if you don't and it will be difficult to get out them out of the pan.  After they were baked, I sprinkled the sliced toasted almond on top of the glaze.  They looked really pretty, and were so tasty!  You will love them.

I took these rolls to a ladies' brunch with 12 women in attendance.  I didn't take any leftovers home with me! Even the aerobics instructor indulged after she heard the comments everyone was making. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Yum!

These tasted absolutely delicious.  Do agree with Karen in CA - put a cookie sheet under the pan while cooking, also used sliced toasted almonds.
Thanks!

It must have been too early for me to do this properly, but turned out great!  Instead of placing the butter/brown sugar mixture into the muffin pan, I spread over the crescent rectangles and rolled up as directed.  I realized my mistake at that point, but had to keep going, so cooked them that way.  They did not cook over and were really tasty.  I mixed the powdered sugar/butter mix and brushed over the cooked tops. Would have thought I'd done it right, they were so good.  I used vanilla extract instead of almond, added cinnamon to the brown sugar mix and did not put nuts in, as the kids won't eat cooked nuts.  Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious special breakfast.

I have made these dozens of times for family, friends, bruches, showers...you name it!  They have always been a HUGE hit.  I still follow the recipe exactly (which is rare for me!) They are wonderful warm and fresh.  However, I often make them the night before for a brunch (if I have lots of other things to prepare) and keep them in the fridge.  They are just as amazing served chilled. Rave reviews all around!

This was a really easy recipe. They leave a bit to be desired when they first come out of the oven. I actually melted a little more butter with brown sugar and brushed it on the tops then sprinkled almonds on the top then drizzled with confectioners' glaze. Everyone in the house loved them and wanted to eat them all right then.

I learned you must flip them out immediately, I waited like 1 minute and they were sticking to the pan.  An easy recipe but I don't think I'll make again.

THIS IS SUCH A WONDERFUL, QUICK AND EASY RECIPE!!!  Great "no fail" recipe for children!  I substituted uncooked apples (just one regular ole' deliscious for six buns) with a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg for the nuts on some buns and on the other buns I inserted milk chocolate chips.  All three types are perfect! DEFINATELY USE A DRIP PAN! Great to take to brunches or for gifting!

This recipe was a hit! I doubled the recipe and only put nuts in half of the buns. I also used butter flavored crescent rolls and vanilla extract instead of almond extract (I didn't have any on hand). They turned out beautifully!

Excellent - even the day after. I made these up ahead of time and wrapped them tightly in plastic wrap. I then sliced them and baked them in the morning.  Everyone loved!! Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe!

These are definitely good, but a little on the excessively buttery side.  Just make sure you bake them until very dark golden brown so they aren't a gooey undercooked mess!

These are very rich and awesome! I actually messed up and put the mixture that's supposed to go in the muffin cups inside the buns instead. So they got a double dose of good stuff, which made them extremely moist and buttery. I inverted them after 15 min in the oven, because they were brown, but they weren't quite done; so I transferred them to a large pie plate and stuck them back in the oven for 5 more minutes. I wonder if they could be done in a pie plate to begin with, or if they would spread too much - maybe a 9 x 13 pan would be easier?

These turned out great!  I did not have any almond extract or almonds on hand so I used lemon extract and pecans. I would definately make these again.  The whole family loved them.

I have made these so many times for breakfast buffets for baptisms, confirmations, etc.  I have to make a double or triple batch & they are always the first things to disappear.  Truly yummy little breakfast treats.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Never never ever use margarine I'd you want a quality product!  Margarine has a high water content.  Use butter!  Improved texture and taste.  With this modification, we thought they were worth having once in awhile.

Surprisingly easy and good.  Of course they're best when eaten warm from the oven (i.e., toss the leftovers if you have any).

I thought these were excellent.  Definately place a cookie sheet under muffin tin to avoid a messy oven.  I made some of these smaller and used a mini muffin pan by having eight rectangles of dough and slicing them into three pieces.  Next time, I'd try slicing them into four pieces.  They were a little big for the mini pan.

Well, that was easy and they turned out really well!  I think canned crescent rolls are my new favorite thing.
