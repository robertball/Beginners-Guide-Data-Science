M'kay....I honestly didn't know what to expect and since it is national s'mores day I thought I would give it a try. These turned out fabulous! The buttery, brown sugary, and vanilla mixture is very rich and really makes this recipe rock out. If you are looking for a s'more, I would recommend using milk chocolate chips like I did instead of semi-sweet. I broiled mine in the oven for 3 minutes and then placed in the freezer to cool them. Excellent recipe!

The taste was REALLY good.  I think I may have added a bit too much butter?  Too much of that. My graham crackers had seen better days-a few of them were broken, so I just broke everything all of them up into bit size pieces.  It was still pretty good and did hold up well enough. I will definitely make again and make sure to get the right amount of butter.

It was rather sweet for my taste and I love sweets. Maybe less brown sugar next time.  I used a little more then called for milk chocolate chips also I only had large marshmallows so I used those. Good enough for the family, not for company.

Really liked them. I bet I could have used Hersey chocolate bars instead of the chips. I did sub in normal-sized marshmallows, as that is what I had in the pantry. Just sliced each in half. Worked well.

It was entirely too sweet (and I like sweet!). It is an attractive dessert - especially with the toasted marshmallows on top. Another bonus was that it was really quick and simple to make.

Hubby and I had a cookie craving and I didn't feel like making cookies and it is -10 outside so don't really feel like running to the store either. So I found this really quick recipe. It is great for a quick cookie fix. While diving into the first round hubby and I look at each other and say ohhhhhh this on ice cream!!!!!!!
