AMAZING! My husband says it's his new favorite meal. I made this recipe without the basil, used a whole onion and whole red bell pepper, 16 oz great value Italian sausage, and I ripped my spinach in half instead of chopped. I wouldn't mind having more spinach personally but it was enough. Also it was my first time using my instapot!

I will definitely make it again.  The grocery store had no chicken sausage so I used turkey sausage and loved it!

Made as written and this was great except for it was too heavy on the herbs. Most recipes I make are the opposite and they need more but this was potent to the point it was overbearing. This was super simple and I will make again but I will decrease the Italian seasoning to a teaspoon or either just leave out the basil altogether. With that being said, this is a great recipe! Italian sausage is full of herbs and seasonings so let it do the work for you!
