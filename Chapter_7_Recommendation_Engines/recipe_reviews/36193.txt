The flavor of the pork was wonderful. I served it over white rice and had steamed brocolli as the side dish. I used dried parsley instead of cilantro (since I hate cilantro... I know I'm crazy). I also used Vermouth instead or Port Wine. The steamed white rice didn't go very well with this dish as the marinade / sauce was very strong.  Next time I will add the marinade / sauce to the pork while it is cooking and simmer it down.  This should thicken the marinade / sauce considerably and give the pork even more flavor.  I will also serve the pork inside of pita bread with tzatziki sauce. As the brocolli didn't fit well either, next time I will use red potatoes as the side dish.

This is very similar to Thai Pork (on this site).  I did like this recipe, although I did change a thing or two.  I cut the pork in thin pieces instead of bite-sized. I also forgot to add the cayenne (didn't matter much) and it tasted really great.  I love the red wine vinegar flavor.  It is just the right amount.  I did add some mushrooms and a bit of  green onion to color it up a bit.  I will definately be making this one again.  Thanks for posting.

I give it a four because although the sauce is a very nice blend of flavor, I had to make some changes to intensify the taste of it in the pork.

First, I cooked the pork with the garlic and cilantro until it's half done.  Then, after taking the pork out of the skillet, I poured in the sauce, and reduced it until thick.  I then tossed the pork in the sauce and cooked it through.

We ate the pork wrapped in lettuce leaves and the texture complimented each other well.  It's a five after the modifications.

So simple and delicious!  Didn't change a thing except I poured out the little remaining oil in the pan and added just a little of the oil, red vinegar and port to the hot pan to deglaze it and poured it over the pork - couldn't let the taste of the browning go to waste!  Then added the remainder of the whisked ingrediants to the pork.  The minced garlic over the meat is a must.  I didn't have fresh cilantro, so used a tsp. of dried, crushed it in the palm of my hand and sprinkled it on.  We had it today, a hot 90 degree day.  I served it with Adrienne's Cucumber Salad (on site) using the first batch of fresh cucumbers from the back yard and sliced tomatoes.  The rest of the Port wine was declicious over ice at the end of the meal with sliced apples, pears and cheese.  Felt like I was on the Riviera - again a very simple, elegant meal - Oh yes, definitely have the french bread to sop up the juice!!!  Thanks Marlies - looking forward to serving this to company!!

Very good.  I used stir fry pork instead.  As well I used burgundy cooking wine instead of vinegar and port.  I left the browned pork in the pan and sprinkled with cilantro and garlic and then sauteed the liquid until half of it was dissolved.  Awesome over a bed of rice with some drippings from the pan!

Best served with rice and french bread.  Added green onions per previous review.  The sauce is good on the french bread.

This was extremely easy and quick to prepare, and the end result was soooo tasty! My boyfriend even said to make it again soon! After browning the pork, I added a bit more sherry(didn't have port wine) to the skillet to deglaze it and then added that in with the olive oil/vinegar that I tossed with the pork pieces. Didn't have fresh cilantro, so used dried, and still tasted wonderful! So quick and easy, thanks Marlies!

This turned out pretty good.  After sautating the pork in EVOO, we then scraped the bits of pork up and glazed with about 1/3 cup of white wine, added some onion and garlic and cooked for about another three to five minutes.  Added remaining ingredients.  Yummy.  Thanks for the post.

Very tasty. My husband said he'd be happy to have pork prepared this way every time we have it.  If you like spicier food, add another pinch or so of cayenne.

This was really god, but I'm not sure we would have liked it as much if we hadn't gone with the idea of serving it with pita bread and tzatziki sauce. It was a nice change though.

Yum.  This was delicious.  Nice and light, and the writer was right, perfect with french bread and a salad.  I already reccomended it to all my family!  I wouldn't change a thing.

I liked the flavor of this meal, used Sherry instead of port. Meat was a little tough and not as tender and juicy as I'd hoped.

Nice flavor, especially due to the cilantro, but too much oil in the dressing.  Next time, I'll reduce the oil by 1/2, maybe a little less vinegar, but use the same amount of port.   I also fried garlic for last minute of pork cook time.

This was good, but not the best. It was a bit bland for my tastes. To make it a complete meal I added one each of a red, green and yellow bell pepper, and served it over macaroni pasta. I tripled the sauce, though doubling probably would have worked. I would maybe make this again, but only if I really had nothing else to make.

Okay, but a little bland. I'd probably use less oil in the sauce and more garlic/cayenne.

Just made recipe and it turned out great. I used chianti (the only thing I had) instead of port. Served it over lightly buttered noodles. Will definately make again and may play a bit w/the ingredients. The kids even liked it.

Super fast, super easy, super delicious.   I have a hard time keeping pork moist, and this was the moistest!!  This will go *very* nicely with authentic pitas & tzaziki sauce.  I imagine it'd be refreshing as a summer meal, but I prepared it in the fall and it was still great!

I've been spoiled by marinades that you can whip up, dump in the meat and throw on the grill.  This is not one of those marinades.  I was hoping for more flavor from the port wine.  The vinegar seemed to negate the port.  Disappointing.  I won't use again until grilling season is over.

Very good. I cut up some onions, set them aside, prepared the marinade (I used marsala instead of port (didn't have any), then cut up the pork & browned it with the garlic & cilantro. I would only use 1 T olive oil to cook the pork in, its juices will come out. After I cooked the pork, I put it in a bowl then put 1/3 C white wine in the pan to deglaze it then cooked the onions in it for a few mins. Added the pork to warm it back up then dumped it all back in the bowl & topped with the marinade. Served with french bread & cucumber salad. Very good. I recommend. Make sure you get the tenderloin on sale, it is very expensive. This is a great adult meal but I don't think children would enjoy this, besides who would serve an expensive cut of meat like this to a child?

This recipe was good. Although it probably would had been better if I had actually had fresh cilantro. Didn’t have cilantro so substituted fresh rosemary instead. I also scraped up bits of pork & used Marsala instead of port because I didn’t have any.

While it came together quickly, the meat was tough and dry. I liked this better before putting the marinade over the cooked pork. Won't be making again.

This was really good for how simple it was. The only things I changed were instead of port (didn't have) I used Marsala and I didn't have cilantro so I used dried parsley. The only reason I give it a 4 is because the meat wasn't tender. I think it might be the cut of meat I used - it was a pork loin roast cut into cubes intstead of the cutlets. I will definitely try this again though with all the right ingredients and I'm sure it will be a 5 then.

using suggestions from this site -- cooked til near done and made the sauce a reduction with which I then tossed the pork til it was finished. 
As my husband despises cilantro I instead put half the amount in the reduction to cook down, and sprinkled the pork at midpoint with the garlic, 3/4 tsp fresh ground coriander, and a tsp of parsley.  He ate it all, and I still got the cilantro that I love....
served it with cous cous flavored with olive oil infused with lime.

This was delicious.  I, being a garlic & cilantro fan did add more than suggested of each.  Both my boyfriend and I thought it was awesome.  Not a morsel was left.  I served it over white rice.  This will be a pork staple in my household, easy, quick & delicious!

This was very good.  I probably doubled the garlic and even more of the cilantro.  It was great over rice.  I may try the sauce for other things.  I think it would be good with steamed carrots and things like that.  Healthier than butter or margarine, too.
