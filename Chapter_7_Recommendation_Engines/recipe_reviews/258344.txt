This was a wonderful idea! i was in a pinch for dinner one night, not only was this easy but my 4 year old actually had seconds! Kids liked it, hubby was fine with it...I'm not sure how often I would make it, but it was a wonderful spin on my "easy dinner night" which is just regular chicken patty sandwiches. I deep fried my patties to make them extra crispy and instead  of garlic butter I used plain butter and sprinkled garlic salt lightly on the bread. Served with a side of raw veggies and dip and that was a dinner that I was actually very satisfied with. Thank you for this idea/recipe, from my family to yours!
