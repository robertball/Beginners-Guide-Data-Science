Wonderful cocktail!  I didn't have an orange wedge so I rimmed the glass with orange juice. Will be making this again, thanks mayita!

I hate to rate my own recipe, but I couldn't figure out another way to add a comment!  After experimenting some more, I've decided I prefer using only plain vodka, and adding a drop (1/4 tsp. for this recipe) of pure vanilla extract. Yum!
