A great recipe which I've made since I was a kid (40+ years ago!) Some tips - just let the sugar/corn syrup mixture come to a light boil and get it off the heat.  Also, don't press it tightly into the pan because it will be too hard to bite and too hard to cut into squares.  I always cut mine in the pan immediately after putting the melted chips on top; otherwise it is more difficult after it is set.  I hope you enjoy these as much as my family and I have!

These are a family favorite. I make these every year at Christmas. In fact, I make several batches. For the people that say they are hard as a brick, you are cooking the sugar/corn syrup mixture too long. All you are supposed to be doing is bringing it to a boil and then get it off of the heat. Also, don't pack them hard into the pan, just lightly press and smooth them out. These are in no way hard as a rock. They are chewy and yummy!!

I've made this recipe for the past 25 years....and called it Special K Bars...as they used to be made with Special K cereal when the flakes used to be smaller!  Now I use rice krispies.  I heat the syrup and sugar in a big tupperware bowl in the microwave for about 90 seconds, add the peanut butter, and stir in the krispies.  I use a much larger pan---12x17 sheet pan--as my daycare kids like them MUCH thinner--and they are easier to cut into 1x1 squares!  After frosting with the melted chips, I decorate each square w/ an M&M of the current season--red and green for X-mas, etc!  Always a hit...and so easy to have all the ingredients on hand for a quick & easy treat to mix up!

I read about these bars on the recipe exchange... wow, they're delicious! My son says he likes them better than marshmallow rice crispy treats and those were always his favorite. I would just suggest cutting them while still warm because they're difficult to cut when cool.

I have been eating this since I was a little girl, and they are so good!  I always make sure I keep some at home before taking them to a potluck or picnic because there are never any leftovers!  It's important to cook the sugar and syrup just until a boil to make sure they stay nice and soft.  I also sometimes add about a teaspoon or two of butter or shortening to the chocolate/butterscotch topping to make it creamier.

these are awsome....I must say through trial and error they are now perfect.  I always let the sugars boil and they would turn out rock hard.  The key is to heat the syrup and sugar on medium low heat and watch it for a good 7 minutes until the sugar starts to dissolve.  I dont even let it come to a boil....almost though.  Take it off the heat and add peanut butter and krispies.  I then layer with chocolate chips and throw under a hot broil for about 1 minute and spread the melted chips over top.  turned out perfect.

These are very good.  A great snack to take to coworkers at Christmas...A hint for expert cook Mickey.  You always melt chocolate either in the microwave by zapping for 1 min on med and stir and repeat until smooth or in another pan over a pot of simmered water, stirring until smooth.  Chocolate burns and clumps very easy.

Rich and very sweet, but so tasty. Easy to make. I am only giving 4 stars because I think next time I might omit the butterscotch chips and double the choco chips.....I know these are "scotcheroos" not "choco-roos", but I think I just like the whole peanut butter/chocolate combo better. Will make again and maybe change it up a bit. Thanks!

I have always made this recipe using Special K cereal instead of the rice krispies.  These bars are a hit whenever I make them.  Everyone loves them!  They're easy and quick to make and great to make in the summer because you don't have to turn the oven on.

this recipe is absolutely awesome, it doesnt take long, the items to make are easy to come by, and its delicious! I did however have to add half and half to the chocolate while it was in the saucepan in order for it to become smooth.

If you find these too sweet, you can omit the corn syrp and sugar altogether. You can simply microwave the PB and butterscotch chips together, stirring until smooth. Then do the same with the choc chips (I suggest semi-sweet) and top them. I used to do it this way to make them on my lunch break at work. I like to eat them warm with a spoon :)

I thought that the coating was a little thin compared to the photo. maybe 2 cups of chocolate chips and 2 cups of butterscotch chips...not just one cup of each. other than that i thought they were delicious. But let them sit a while before taking them out of the pan (20 minutes is good enough) or else it will be too crumbly to eat and it will break into pieces. if you don't have enough corn syrup , substitute it with honey! it works the same! they sure are yummy and bake free--so they're quick! YUM!!Also... it's way quicker to melt the chocolate and butterscotch chips in the microwave instead of the stove! 30 mins,stir,30 mins, stir! ( 1 minute total) for kids they also taste good with a few sprinkles or miniature marshmallows! ,marshmallow spread mixed with melted Peanut butter is good for a topping aswell! makes about 18 squares , but i guess it all depens on how you cut it! haha! ENJOY!

Oh my, Oh my, Oh Scotcheroos!  I made these and can not stop eating them.  I used cocoa Krispies and added almost a TBSP of shortening to the chocolate & butterscotch chips to make it more spreadable.  These are better then the stardard marshmallow Krispie squares.

In my family, these are known as "rice krispy treats," the one and only (none of that marshmallow stuff for us, thank you very much!). They're to die for, I'd probably eat a whole pan by myself if there was no one around to stop me. A couple of tips, though-melt the chocolate and butterscotch chips in a glass measuring cup in the microwave, in 1 minute intervals, stirring in between. Once you pour that over the top, let them chill in the fridge for an hour or so, then set them out at room temperature for about half an hour. That way the chocolate's set (although it gets a little soft at room temp), but they're easier to cut, as the rice krispy mixture gets softer. Also, as other reviews have said, don't push them down too hard into the pan, or they'll be too dense to cut and bite. They (without the chocolate) should come about halfway up the side of the pan.

LOVE these! I love taking them to functions because so many people have never heard of them!  I use about 3/4 bag of chocolate chips and 1/2 a bag of butterscotch.  Also, as soon as you see a bubble along the side, remove the corn syrup and sugar from the heat.  Then they will be nice and soft!

These are our favorite candy bars, by far!!!!  I have been making these for years.  They are very addicting!  I use natural unsweetened peanut butter.  Also have used milk chocolate chips in place of semi-sweet with the butterscotch chips, but prefer the semi-sweet.  If I used the milk chocolate again, I would leave out the butterscotch as it makes it too sweet.

Many variations can be done to this recipe.  I wanted to use this for a 'How-To' for using corn syrup.  They came out chewer than marshmellow versions (just do NOT over boil the corn syrup).

This is a classic and my personal favorite. If yours are hard in the least you are cooking the syrup and sugar too long. Perhaps the term "boil" needs to be definied. "Boil" is different from "rolling boil". Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently, and as soon as the mixture has little bubbles popping up throughout most of the pan, you're done. The mixture shouldn't be boiled to the point you would say, boil water for pasta. Also worth noting is that I multiply the recipe by 1.5 and use a cookie sheet intead of a 9x13.

Very good but after making it I remember now why I hate working with peanut butter.   The three tastes go well together.

I should have realized when I read "scotch"eroos that the butterscotch would be the dominant flavour. I'm not a fan of butterscotch so I substituted half the butterscotch chips for Reece's peanut butter ones. It didn't help though, I think I would prefer standard krispie squares with a chocolate/peanut butter topping.  My kids didn't care for them either so I likely won't make them again. However, if you like butterscotch you will probably really enjoy these. Thanks anyway!

I took the cue from a friend who used a jelly roll pan. Mine is approx 11"X17". And for the topping, I used one handful of butterscotch chips and one handful of chocolate chips. I threw them on the warm cereal/peanut butter mixture I had spread out in the pan and it gives just a hint of chocolate butterscotch flavor. No more breaking off teeth to eat these bad johnsons...

SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. I usually hate rice krispie treats because most are made mainly with marshmallows and I hate marshmallows. These were such a nice surprise!! I basically followed the recipe exactly. Left out a little bit of sugar (I put a little more than 3/4 of a cup in). It was absolutely delicious!! I made it for a group of my closest friends that I have not seen in a few months as I am away at college and I had to force myself to not eat the whole batch before I saw them. I highly recommend this recipe!

these are great and easy, I didnt have butterscotch chip on hand, so I DBL the chocolate chips and when melting the chocolate chips I added about 3/4 of a stick to a stick...makes it easy to work with and give it a nice shine to it. I also added 2 TBL butter to the sugar and peanutbutter,keep it from getting hard. I use unsalted butter.

These are very addicting my husband and I have to make ourselves stop eating these so we don't get sick. (although I could probably sit down and eat the whole pan hehe) I did mine alittle different on the chocolate and butterscotch I used 1 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate 1 1/4 cup butterscotch and 1 cup of milk chocolate. The combination makes such a good bar! We keep ours in the fridge which when you take them out they are very hard but if you leave them on the counter for like 10 mins before you eat them they are fine. This is my FAVORITE FAVORITE dessert. If I could give it more stars I would make these you will not be sorry!!

These were a hit at a holiday get-together with several friends. If you make the topping, I recommend doubling it in order to make sure it covers the entire top. Beware, these are incredibly rich. They'd probably be good without the topping as well.

My husband would have given these 10 stars. They were too sweet for me, but people loved them. If you love peanut butter, this is a great treat for you.

Chocolate, Peanut Butter and Butterscotch in a cereal -a true rich and SWEET snack bar this is but so worth making! This went as fast as it took for to put together. I heated the syrup and sugar on medium low heat towards a light boil, then when I saw little bubbles starting to surface, I took the pot off the burner immediately. Mixed in the peanut butter, which melted nicely, the 6 cups of cereal, then spread it lightly in a pan sprayed with PAM. I did not pack the cereal mixture into the pan, just lightly spread it evenly around. Next, I melted the chocolate and butterscotch chips together in a saucepan over low heat.  I was almost tempted to add in a little butter to help smooth it out and make for a creamier texture but I didn't. When spread over the cereal, the chocolate/butterscotch mixture ends up being a "thin" layer just enough to cover the entire cereal. When it slightly cooled, I got a knife and cut into bars. I think next time I may try to melt the butterscotch chips first, layer it over the cereal, then melt the chocolate chips as the last layer over the top pf the butterscotch. I would most likely add a little more chocolate and butterscotch chips being that it was a thin layer and a little butter. This is a sweet, chewy, rich snack. What I liked best about this was I did NOT have to turn on the oven in order to make this recipe!

I replaced the corn syrup with golden syrup, and reduced the amount of the syrup to 3/4c. Also reduced sugar to 2/3c and used soft brown instead of white. I added a splash of water. To compensate I used 1 1/4c of PB, and did a dark choc drizzle. it was YUM.

Way too sweet for my liking, I think they would be good even without the chocolate topping, maybe with some chocolate chips thrown in with the cereal instead.

They were good, but I probably wouldn't make them again.  It took hours before the chocolate/ butterscotch mixture got cool enough to cut into bars and the rice crispy had a somewhat stale feeling to them.  Nothing like the original Rice Krispy treat.

These are my 24-yr.-old son's favorite. To keep them from being too dry or too hard, be sure not to cook the sugar very long. Only bring it to a boil and let it cook VERY BRIEFLY, just until the sugar starts to dissolve. Enjoy!!

These really are delicious. I use just over 5 cups of cereal. It makes them more "gooey" and keeps them from drying out. I also go ahead and use the entire 12 oz bag of chocolate chips (extra 4 ounces) for a thicker frosting layer. YUMMY!

Yum yum yum! I loved these. The only thing I would change would be to maybe make more of the topping, because it was spread pretty thinly over the bars and didn't quite reach all the edges. Very very yummy though. Will definitely make these again!

These were really great - a nice change from regular Rice Krispie treats.  I had a bit of trouble getting the butterscotch and chocolate chips to melt, so I added a few tablespoons of cream.

Great recipe! My family has made a similar dessert for years. Our recipe calls for the butterscotch chips to be melted into the peanut butter mixture. (This maybe too rich for some.) Also, instead of a chocolate coating on the top, we have a layer of melted chocolate in between two layers of the rice krispies. Either way, it's a great treat !

Easy and good all in the same pot.  How can one go wrong??  The only thing I did differently is add peanut butter instead of the butterscotch chips because we don't like them.  So my topping was a chocolate peanut butter instead and mmmm.  I have also found it easier to cut while cool instead of from the fridge. Not quite as pretty since the chocolate smears instead of cutting straight though.  Hint: fridge too full?  Cover and cool outside in the winter!

I didn't use butterscotch chips, I just melt chocolate and spread it over top.  I recommend cutting before you chill as well.  I have made this now twice, and it has been a hit both times.  The first time I used vanilla flavoured Rice Krispies

My mom made these while I was growing up and still makes them a lot. I've never met anyone who didn't like them! If they come out hard as a rock, you boiled the pb and corn syrup too long. If you like a softer bar, add a bit more pb.

My husband's family staple. I thought I should try making them. I Read the recipe and it sounded easy.  And...it is. But it took me a couple of tries and was feeling "what is my problem!!"  Each time the bars came out rock hard as I let it boil. Which is a no no!  Finally I let the sugar dissolve and bring it just before it starts to boil.  Take off the heat....So with that said.  I give these bars a 5.  Super Sweet.

These were so easy to make and so good!  Definitely do not let the corn syrup, sugar mixture get to a boil.  These came out just perfect.  I had no trouble cutting them or biting into them.  Fabulous!!!

This is a great easy recipe!! I omitted the butterscotch just cuz my family doesn't eat it.  You can also make this recipe and use 6 cups cornflakes and drop by spoon onto foil and omit the topping and they are just as great been making those for years now!!

I made this recipe for a bake sale, and everyone loved them. I felt there was too much butterscotch in the recipe, but not being a fan of it normally, it was probably my own personal preference. I would recommend splitting this in to two pans as it makes quite thick bars even in a 10x13.

this threw my diet out the window.....i could eat the whole pan! I topped with ganache.  one small carton of whipping cream and bring to a boil. take off stove and pour over a bags worth of choc chips.  once it was well blended i put the ganache in the fridge to stiffen it up. then i poured over the dessert. SO FANTASTIC. i took to a football party and didn't bring any home!

These are really good! The bars will stay nice and soft if you shut the heat off as soon as the sugar and corn syrup come to a simmer. Boiling makes them get hard. I melt the chips in the microwave. Put them in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave 2 minutes stopping and stirring after one minute.

This is the best recipe ever!  I went through and made sure it was posted!  I always do a little more butterscotch in the topping to make them more "scotchy."

Everything worked out until I got to the chocolate part. The chips didn't melt very well, so I had to redo them in the double boiler. But they turned out very good.

Two things that make this easier: Keep the mixture on the burner at medium while mixing in the rice crispies.  Then when you press it into the pan you can just sprinkle the choc chips on and they will melt on their own.  To make cutting easier, put in the fridge for about 30 minutes and then take it out to cut into squares.  If you wait until chocolate is cooled, it is hard to cut them without breaking the chocolate topping.

I love these bars!  The ultimate for chocolate-peanut butter lovers.  I made them in an 11x7 inch pan, so they were thicker.  I also increased the frosting.  I used 1 1/2 cups each of the chocolate and butterscotch chips.  Mmmmmm....

Addicting. Very, very addicting. My mom always made these with Special K, but my coworker who requested them for his birthday treat knew them to be made with Rice Krispies...they are great using either. I followed the recipe exactly (how do you not??) and they were wonderful. I had to use a bigger bowl to mix everything in...otherwise I would've ended up with cereal all over the place. :) YUMMMMMMMMMMM!   **This is really tasty with Corn Flakes too!

These are EXCELLENT. I was looking for this recipe, very similar to a rice krispie treat a local place used to make called an "O'Henry Bar". I make this exactly as the recipe calls for, and I think it's quite tasty. To those who omit the butterscotch chips, I would definitely recommend trying it. It doesn't have a butterscotch-taste (if that's what you object to), just a richer, chocolate taste. I think the butterscotch chips help bring the flavor out of the bars. Also, I found I REALLY need to stir these well to coat the cereal mixture, or the bottom of the bars ends up a little sticky from extra karo-syrup mixture.

These are the best crisy treats I've made. I took them to work and they were consumed faster than anything I've taken in the past. WORD OF CAUTION: I heated/dissolced the sugar and corn syrup mixture in the microwave because I didn't want to dirty an pan and I waited too long before I mixed it with the cereal. The mixture started to harden quickly which made it difficult to mix. Next time I will use a pot that is large enough to add the cereal to the sweetened peanut butter mixture. I cut these in small 1" squares and even at that small size they were rich and very fulfilling. Delish!!!

These were delicious! I doubled the chocolate butterscotch topping, but think I will go with the recommended amount next time.  It made it even richer. Definitely a keeper though. Can't wait to make it for work.

This was just what I was looking for! However, I just omitted the butterscotch chips because I was really wanted just chocolate and peanut butter (my faves!). For the topping, I did 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chips and 1/2 cup peanut butter. Everyone loved them!

These were delicious.  I coated my pan with cooking spray and they popped right out after chilling them in the fridge making them easier to cut.  I didn't have butterscotch chips so I used a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips, and they were delicious.  Who doesn't love chocolate and peanut butter?

This is a great recipe.  These were always my favorite holiday treat as a kid and now I know how to make them.  I made 4 batches for a charity Thanksgiving dinner that our local church holds every year.  They were a little complicated for me but they turned out perfectly.  I had a hard time melting the chocolate and then cutting the bars after everything was cool but I managed.  Overall, a great recipe!!

This was a great recipe! I have never made these before-- but everyone RAVED about them last night- saying they were the best ones they've ever had! Not many people there and the whole pan was gone! My husband is having me make them again tonight! I only had a little of the semi-sweet chocolate, so I just dumped about 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and they were fine! Great recipe!

I add the butterscotch chips to the mix before putting it in the buttered pan.

I used 1 of the other reviews, I left out the butterscotch, doubled the chocolate chips and put the dish in a hot oven to melt the  chocolate chips, came out perfect.  A hit at the pot luck.

I remember making something similar when I was a kid and I've been searching for the recipe.  I didn't remember any butterscotch so I didn't use any.  I also remembered using brown sugar and I just couldn't shake that memory so I used 1/4 brown sugar and 3/4 cup regular sugar.  I know that this isn't really a review based on all these changes but I'm posting just in case someone else is looking for the same old recipe I'm looking for.  Also I remember having a pretty thick chocolate frosting on these but I used 2 cups of chocolate chips and it barely covered them.  I could swear that the recipe I remember making had something mixed into the melted chips, maybe it was shortening or maybe more likely a tbs or two of peanut butter.  I took other people's suggestions and barely let the corn syrup boil and didn't push it hard down into the pan so they are softer.  I'm still trying to figure out what I'm looking for, this was pretty close but I'm still searching.

Very tasty and easy to make. I thought a cup of corn syrup plus a cup of sugar would be too sweet so I just used a cup of corn syrup, heated it to a boil, then added the peanut butter. I also used Reece's peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch chips in the topping.

I have made these for years. My fave! I can't find my recipe...so I plugged in the ingredients on Allrecipes and bingo...my recipe. The only difference is, I always cooked the corn syrup mixture in the microwave. I'll be making them today. I'm a happy camper.  Thx for the recipe.

This pregnant lady's dream come true!  Oh my, these things are absolute heaven to me!  I followed other's advice and just as soon as syrup comes to a boil, I start mixing and haven't had any issues of the krispies getting too hard.  I do reduce the amount of chocolate and butterscotch chips on top aas it seemed too much with the full amount.  Per other's suggestions I also add butter to the chips to make it more spreadable, which it definitely needs.  I am also going to try mixing the chips into the krispies, as the chocolate/butterscotch coating really hardens after awhile and starts to break off.

This is a great recipe. I changed it a bit. Instead of sugar I added Splenda and used extra sugar free chocolate chips because didn't want to add the butterscotch chips. I also added peanut butter to the chocolate for the top and 1 tablespoon of shortening to make it set up. I also doubled the recipe because of the 5 people in my house Love it so much!! Enjoy =^)

If you line your pan with aluminum foil, they are easier to cut.  Just lift out, and cut with a long knife or a pizza cutter.  These are one of my favorite bars!!!!

These are so awesome!  You truly do take them off the heat as soon as you see a bubble.  It's always hard to for me too because I think I should wait but if you do take them off the heat they will be chewy. :)

This recipe is very good. I have never had any scotcheroos turn out until now. My husband was very impressed and really liked em. I ate three of them after supper. Great...... I will have to save my husband some will be hard to do when he is gone all week. Guess I can make another pan so he has some when he gets home. Love em. Thanks.......

My mom has been making these sweet treats for as long as I remember. I couldn't wait for thanksgiving, family picnics and other gatherings because I knew I would get to enjoy these chewy bars. I have carried this tradition on and now when my boys are home for a visit they always request moms scotcheroos. They are quick to make and will impress any guest.

Love the taste, but for some reason my turned out dry.  They only taste chewy if I warm them up in the microwave for 10 seconds first.  Followed the recipe exactly so I'm not sure why they are so dry.

Wow that was SWEET. I'm not sure how to "tone that down" but perhaps using natural peanutbutter would help (those main brands have a lot of sugar in em)... and cutting out some of that sugar... and using peanutbutter chips in place of butterscotch?? Just a thought. My husband and I liked them... but they were REALLY RICH and super sweet. Would be a child's delight. :)

I grew up eating these and was so happy to find a recipe! These are delicious. It is true they freeze well and I followed another reviewers tip to mix in the Rice Krispies while the corn syrup surgar and peanut butter are on low. It makes it much eaiser to stir together. I usually double the butterschotch and chocolate chips topping. Yummy!

My mom use to make these when I was little. They were a huge hit with everyone. When I was a late teenager my roommate surprised us all with them. I am so excited to find them on here! They are very rich (which I happen to love) and very flavorful. I will be making these soon! Thanks for posting!

I loved the cereal part. I used Special K cereal and added the butterscotch chips directly to the peanut butter mixture. I will definitely make this again, but without the chocolate.

Since so many comments said they were very sweet I made them with 1/2 cup of sugar. I also used natural peanut butter (no sugar added) and they turned out perfectly.   The only change I'll make next time is to make half the topping (1/2 cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips). I just felt there was a quite a lot on top.

Big hit!  This bar stays soft for a few days, unlike regular rice krispie treats that usually only last a day or two before going hard.

Was good but my husband did not like the butterscotch flavor. I may use this again & use peanut butter chips instead. Is still a very good recipe.

Although very delicious and rich, I found these to get very hard when cooled. I even dented the bottom of my baking pan trying to cut them with a butter knife. I would recommend trying to cut them while still warm.

I originally gave this recipe two stars because it was SO rich and heavy after I made it. I could not even eat one square. Well, I let them sit over night and tried them the next day and they were delicious! I just suggest giving them several hours to set so they won't be so rich.

This is THE recipe my grandma makes every time we go to visit her. I have adopted it and it's a favorite treat in the family- especially in the summer. It's also good using Special K. Grandma has used Raisin Bran in the past (sounds weird, but there's really no difference- just raisins). She also likes to add butter into the frosting- I don't recommend as it adds five zillion calories and nothing special flavor-wise.

These are the best, I am not a fan of butterscotch chips so I used Reese' Peanut butter chips and they are delicious.  I melt my chocolate chips, and I do use Milk Chocolate chips in the microwave and it comes out really smooth and each to poor over the Rice Krispie mixture.  This is a keeper, but I can only make them once in a great while or give some aways cause you could eat them all in couple of days!!!!!

I saw these and had to have a taste! I like all of the flavor combinations - chocolate, PB, butterscotch - and I LOVE rice krispy treats.  All went well until I had to melt the chocolate and butterscotch chips. I did so over low heat (as directed) and ended up with a glob of unmelted chips. I tried a second time, with what I though were milk choc. chips (I do not like semi-sweet hence the milk choc. variety), but they were mint chips! The mint was terrible!!! My fault! My gripe is that it seems as if there should have been directions to add milk or shortening to aid in the melting process. I may try this some other time (now that I know to add milk to my chips in order for them to melt properly), but not anytime soon.

This was one of my grandma's standards.  Now that she's gone I'm the baker and this is one of the most requested cookies.  Very easy to make and delicious.  I sometimes double the chocolate and butterscotch chips for a thicker chocolate top depending on who I'm making them for.

These are definitely a sweet treat and my favorite!  I use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and I melt them in the microwave with the butterscotch chips for about a minute plus, stir them up and they are smooth and easy to pour over the top of the treat.  I've gotten raving reviews from co-workers and friends alike.

Very fun, kicked up version of a rice crispie treat.  I don't think they were to sweet as many others have said.  Peanut butter taste was very mild and not overpowering.  Will definately make these again!!!

I have been making these for many years.  Every time I share them I am asked for the recipe. I now make them every Christmas season and include them with my cookie trays.  They are easy and pretty fast to make (lot less labor intensive than cookies). Not a lot of ingredients are needed either.  The hardest part is melting the chocolate and butterscotch chips to top it with. The first time I made them I did manage to burn my chocolate a little. I now use a double boiler and have not had problems since.

i followed the directions which were easy to follow & smelled wonderful while putting together, but the end result was a rock hard and had to be hit hard to break any pieces off to try.  the bit i did taste test was too sweet, and you couldn't tell there was any butterscotch chips added, because the chocolate was too strong.  i obviously cooked the corn syrup too long, which would explain why it came out the way it did, but perhaps people could reduce a little bit of the chocolate chip...otherwise they might just want to go with chocolate krispies instead.

Our family loves these treats!  The first time I ate these I fell in love.  I found that it is easier to spread the icing if you pour it on as soon as you take it off the stove.

So delicious! Remind me of the peanut butter rice krispie treats you can buy at the store. I did omit the butterscotch chips, personal preference...me nor my boyfriend are fond of them, and used nearly   3.5 cups of semisweet chips for topping. Another user suggested double the topping and i second that. I just covered the tops of them with 3.5 cups.

These are absolutely delicious. The nice thing is that you can use any flavor of chips that you want and they come out great each and every time.

I absolutely love this version of a Rice Krispy treat!!  The only thing I didnt like, which is a key ingredient is the butterscotch.  I used pure good old fashioned peanut butter and I think that made a world of difference!  I'll be making these again but be leaving off the whole topping, these are FAB!!

Delicious, but hard as rocks. I don't know if that was my fault or the recipe. Either way they were eaten up.

This has always been one of our favorites.   I always get great compliments on them. We like them best with more chocolate/butterscotch then the cereal, but hey we are a chocolate family!!!

I've been making these for who knows how long. My Grandma always makes me a special batch, cause she knows how much I love them. They do taste better with chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

I have made these treats for years and everyone loves them - I call them "peanut butter krispies".  Enjoy :)
