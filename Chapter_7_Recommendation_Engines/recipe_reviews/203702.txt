I thought the taste was pretty good.  Can def note the apple cider vinegar.  Most people who tried it said it was "very minty" ... which I think is good but not everyone agreed.  I liked it so much I'm making another batch right now!  Also, this recipe makes only 3 1/2 jelly jars, not 9.

I love making jams & jellies.  This is an easy and delicious mint jelly....wonderful w/rack of lamb.  Beautiful color too. The correction should be the size of the canning jars used....small 4 oz jars as shown in recipe photo; not half pint jars

Following the recipe exactly as I usually do, I get only (and presisely) 3 jars of jelly with this recipe. Would it be possible that 3 cups of water are required?

I made this today, exactly as written, but left out the food colouring. It's addictively delicious, and so much better than what you can buy.
