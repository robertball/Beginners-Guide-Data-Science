New favorite snack! They were a tad bland after cooking but still so good. I topped with a bit of extra salt and fresh cilantro. I used organic Yukon gold potatoes but they really small and there was no way I was going to peel them so I cooked them skin on and a put them in the blender with the pepper, garlic, ginger mix. I was a bit scared because blender mashed potatoes =ewww however I didn't want any of the skins to clog my ricer. It was a total success. After I had a smooth mixture I transferred to a bowl and added the flour. They came out so well and it makes a lot. I love that they are gluten free and vegan. Hubs and I snacked on them like popcorn while watching tv.

I love the ingredients and taste!  I just can't have salt or fried food, so I cooked this like you'd cook American noodles, by boiling!  This was surprisingly easy to make!  I used regular vegetable oil this time, next time I need to find mustard oil for a spicier flavor!

Halved the recipe.  The noodles were a little bland after cooking.  I dusted them with salt and hot chilli powder  and it was much better.  Next time I will squeeze a bit of lemon juice over the noodles.  It will be amazing.
