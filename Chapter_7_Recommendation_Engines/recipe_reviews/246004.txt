I was so looking forward to eating this and I was terribly disappointed.  It was very easy to make but, the flavors just did not go together for me.  On the other hand, I do believe White Chocolate would be a better fit for me.  I will try again with that.

Simple idea that tasted good. It wasn't very sweet, even with the extra peanut butter chips I sprinkled on top, but it was sweet enough. I went ahead and stirred the chips in while it was still in the pan. (It might be fun for kids to stir them into their own bowls.) I thought 3 minutes was too long to let the cereal sit before stirring them in. At 2 minutes  I put them in--the cereal was already starting to set too much, and I didn't want it to get too lumpy for my picture. Next time I will stir in right away. Thanks for the idea. I hadn't had farina in a while, and I think I'll try this with some cinnamon chips I have.
