The dressing softens the tomatoes, but the cauliflower stays crunchy. Good idea to try to get the tomatoes and the cauliflower florets about the same size.  I didn't chop the cauliflower, just trimmed the floret stems a little and broke them apart which I think makes for a nice presentation.   Just a really nice salad/side dish with a tasty dressing.

Made the basic salad with a few changes:

I blanched the cauliflower for 2 minutes in lightly salted water and then into an ice bath.

Added 1/2 of a red bell pepper, diced, for color and sweetness

Added about 1/4 cup  of feta crumbles, as this was doubling as my side dish, and I needed to add tasty calories

Used a mix of heritage small tomatoes that were in a pint box together at Sprouts....used about 2/3rd of the pint

Used Penzey's Italian Dressing mix made with red wine vinegar (Pompeii) and extra virgin olive oil  (Bertoilli)

Husband declared it delicious!  Next time I will cut the cauliflower into smaller pieces...I didn't think of that tonight 

Served with a small steak for a great, quick, low carb supper

This salad is very good. Something different to do with cauliflower. Next time I make it I will just use Italian dressing on it. i made the dressing called for and it was very bland. I add some Italian dressing and it was delicious. Will mke again for sure.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I added some black olives for an additional flavor. Next time I might blanch the cauliflower for a few minutes to soften the veggie. Great summer picnic dish.

This is a tasty and colorful way to replace a dinner salad.   I found it could marinate for up to 48 hours in the fridge.   Great winter salad side.

I made this without garlic and parsley but it was very very good.  Will add garlic and parsley to the leftovers along with our homemade pickled green beans.

This is delicious!  I did have to make a few substitutions based on what I had on hand and the need to make for just us two: added one finely chopped leaf of kale in place of the parsley, one green onion that needed to be used (!), 1/2 shallot, and grape tomatoes, halved. Whizzed the 1/2 shallot in my ninja chopper with the dressing ingredients, used red wine vinegar. The salad smelled so good as I was putting it into the fridge, I couldn't resist and took a few bites. Yum! I'll do this again for sure.

This is a delicious salad. The only thing I changed was I roasted the cauliflower with no oil to bring out a nutty flavor to the whole thing. Not necessary but worth the extra bit of time.

With the exception of using green onions rather than the red as instructed, this recipe was great! Even better the next day. I will make again!

I will make it again but blanch the cauliflower next time as suggested. Like the idea of some peppers for more color.

Super simple, great salad. I halved it and it was more than enough for four. I also used Roma tomatoes, but will try cherry next as I think they would be better.  I used 2 tbs lemon juice and 2 tbs rice wine vinegar (personal pref, I really like lemon juice).  Tossed in some shredded parm just before serving. WONDERFUL! Thanks for a great new way to use cauliflower!

I added a bit more cilantro because I love it& some lime juice to taste after putting the amount of lemon juice called for.  It was terrific! Refreshing.
