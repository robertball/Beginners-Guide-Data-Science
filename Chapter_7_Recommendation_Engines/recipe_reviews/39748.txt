Delicious, but needed enhancements. I added 1/2 cup finely chopped red bell pepper, 10 shakes of Worcesteshire, more garlic, seasoning salt, splash of light soy, dried parsley, a whole egg not just the white. (For those that say your patties fall apart..I have a trick...You add the yolk of the egg as it helps to hold the mix together even when you have them flat as possible. Also put a light coating of flour on the patties just before you cook them ensuring that you shake off the excess flour. The flour helps form a light, crusty exterior and holds the patty and makes it easier to flip.) The egg yolk and extra bell pepper meant I had to add more breadcrumbs and for those who say their mix is sticky, you should probably add more crumbs anyway. How well they hold together in you hand is how well they hold on the pan. Juicy and very tasty.

I grilled these on my George Foreman grill, however, I was concerned that the grill would cook the burgers too fast (no heat control).  So what I did was put the burgers on the cold grill, then plug it in.  15 mins later, the burgers were perfect! I cooked three and froze the rest...can't wait to see how they turn out!

I am on a low cholesterol diet.  I am also a carnivore.  I love meat, but have been trying to cut down on fats & load up on fruit, veggies and the occasional red meat.  I found this recipe to be really good with the following additions: 1)  added a few drops of hickory seasoning liquid smoke  2)  add a few drops of Worcestershire sauce, 3) add a small, plastic package of soy sauce, leftover from a Chinese restaurant. This will guarantee that these babies will taste like beef.  I tried this on my equally carnivorous roomie, who proclaimed that due to my dilgent efforts, some can be fooled into thinking they're eating a Quarter Pounder, no cheese, extra onion.  Speaking of onion, shred fine with a shredder.  I used parsley from my garden.  Good going, Trudi!

These burgers were scrumptious! I'd take them any day over regular hamburgers! (The husband, who's a big turkey fan, adored them too). When I made them, I substituted onion powder for chopped onion, left out the garlic, and added a few tablespoons of soy sauce, a couple teaspoons of worchestershire, and a few shakes of hot sauce. I also used Lawry's seasoning salt instead of regular salt. And I used italian-style bread crumbs. I put these on the grill, and sprinkled a little garlic powder and a little more worchestershire sauce on them as they cooked. I served them topped with lettuce, red onion, ketchup, and mustard, and they were so flavorful and juicy! Some other users said they added mushrooms to keep the burgers from being dry, but i found that the worchestershire will do the job just fine, and adds better flavor!

I tried this recipe three times...the first time I followed the directions exactly as written and thought that the burgers came out pretty good. The second time (after taking the advice of other users) I added a splash of liquid smoke, a splash of worcestershire sauce, and a splash of soy sauce. This recipe was a little tastier. The third time was definitely the best....instead of 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, I used 3/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs. I used one whole egg instead of two egg whites. I omitted the teaspoon of salt and added 2 Tablespoons of soy sauce instead. I added the splash of liquid smoke and worcestershire. Instead of trying to peel and mince the clove of garlic, I added 1 teaspoon of minced garlic out of the jar. The rest of the recipe (onion, parsley, pepper) I kept the same. Finally...I tried to pan fry the first two times, but grilled them on the BBQ the third time....10X better flavor! The one thing I learned is that you MUST spray the hell out of the grill with Pam to keep the patties from sticking.

Delicious! I used fresh bread crumbs (this helps with the dryness problem others complained of) and seasoned it with a little bit of Italian seasoning.  They were really juicy. 

I was also careful to shape them gently (with a slight indentation in the center so that it would not "puff") and not press down on them during cooking, so they retained more juices.

I have now made this recipe twice, and it was delicious both times.  The first time I had enough left over to make a meatloaf as well.  I combined some tomato sauce, brown sugar, salt and worcestshire sauce and poured it over the loaf in the pan before baking it.  It was great.  I would highly recommend this recipe to someone who may have tried turkey for burgers, but were turned off by the bland texture and taste.  This recipe overcomes all those issues, and is lowfat and healthful, too.  Thanks for the recipe.

I add a generous sprinkle of McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning on top of the patties, and they are perfect.  Works well for turkey or beef.  Also, I used Egg Beaters, and could not tell the difference.

There are delicious. You won't miss the beef I promise. These burgers are moist, juicy and packed with flavor. I used the ground turkey that includes dark meat. In the past using the ground turkey breast has no been as successful.

These are actually good.  Mind you, I can eat a hamburger every day and not tire of it (the main reason that I decided to try this).  I did add a little liquid smoke & subbed onion powder for the onions.  I ate this on a bun with honey mustard & lettuce, yum!  Thanks Trudi!

If you are thinking about making these on the grill, DON'T!!! I grilled them and about half of them "melted" through the grates.

This recipe is fabulous!  Only added about a tbsp of Worcestshire sauce.  Also note, these burgers do not shrink like beef burgers do so make the patties the exact size that you want to eat them at.

Oh my goodness! This recipe is worth more than 5 stars! I made these burgers this evening...they were flavorful and moist! I did make some changes, I halved the recipe as the package of turkey was only a pound and a half. In addition, I used 2 cloves of garlic and 1/4 c of chopped onion as I love those flavors. I used a handful of parsley which I did not measure and one whole egg. I also used panko breadcrumbs 6TBS. In stead of salt and pepper, I used Montreal Steak seasoning within the mix and sprinkled lightly on each side when I put them on my outdoor propane grill. Thank you for this fantastic Turkey Burger recipe! This one is truely a keeper!

I gave this 5 stars using this as a base for the recipe I ended up making.  I basically used all the ingredients listed but had to adjust for 1 lb of turkey to make 4 burgers for 2 ppl.  I sauteed my onion and garlic in a little Smart Balance spread first before adding to the meat and added about a tsp of rubbed sage also.  Used Slap Ya Mama seasoning instead of salt and pepper (if you can't find that, Tony's would also work).  Make sure to use a good bit of seasoning as turkey can be pretty tasteless otherwise.  I used one whole egg as well. And added a little worchestershire sauce.  Yea they're pretty darn soft and hard to handle at first, but if you get them formed and in the pan, fry  on medium to med low heat and start flipping occasionally when they're firm enough to flip, two at a time depending on your pan size.  They turned out so super juicy!  Best turkey burgers I've made yet!  Highly recommended :)

These are fantastic!  I scaled down the recipe and added a splash of worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke and a healthy dose of steak seasoning.  I also used oatmeal (pulverized in the food processor) in place of the bread crumbs.  Will definitely make this one over and over and over again!

My husband and I have been relying on this recipe for several years now and I thought I should give it the rating and review it deserves! Some comments about my experience with this recipe:
1) If I am making the recipe for a small crowd I still use the full sized recipe and easily have frozen uncooked burger patties to throw on the grill another time.  They grill up just fine popping them on there frozen.
2) As someone who loves to cook flavorful meals-I have struggled with a lot of dietary restrictions, allergies, etc and have a toddler to whom I am determined to give the benefit of healthy food.  These burgers are healthy to begin with, but they are also easy to make EVEN HEALTHIER.  For example, many times I have substituted the bread crumbs for uncooked old fashioned oats and have tossed other things like a little flax meal or wheat germ in them too.  
3) These burgers are great on a bun piled high with veggies and condiments, split in half and eaten rolled up in a tortilla, or open faced/without the bun altogether.  
As a parting comment-we always find these burgers juicy and flavorful.  In other words, they do not disappoint! 
Whether you use any of my two-cents-worth here or not, I hope you give these a shot!

These are fantastic! To my frustration, when I was in the middle of making these, I realised that I ran out of eggs! I added some milk instead and crossed my fingers  for the best. With some gentle handling, they actually ended up holding nicley.  The only additions I made were to add a dash of hot pepper sauce, worcestershire sauce, some tyme and a pinch of cumin.  Served them up greek style with melted feta, home made tzatziki, chopped kalmata olives, sundried tomatoes, red onions, spinach leaves and fresh tomatoes.  So good! Thanks for posting this great healthy alternative! :)

This was a good recipe. I did add minced garlic and chives to the turkey and once I made the patties, I rubbed olive oil on them so they wouldn't stick to the grill or get dry. Yum - Thanks!

I have been making turkey burgers for a number of years. Nice of you to send this in, Trudi.  But I always add finely chopped mushrooms to the mixture which gives the burgers added moisture, which turkey needs, and flavor. With the mushrooms added I would give this 5 stars.

OK, I only had 1lb. of ground turkey, but decided to try this anyway.  So glad I did.  Seasoned w/ 2 tbls. seasoned breadcrumbs, 1 whole egg, about 2 tbls. onion, 1 whole clove garlic, 1/2 tsp. salt, pepper, worchestersire sauce and light soy sauce as suggested by another reader.  WOW, moist and tasty.  A keeper.  Ate one right away and was able to freeze 5 small ones.

I have never made or eaten a turkey burger in my life and neither has my husband, but these were "actually delicious".  We had no clue what to do, but I could see from the recipe and the reviews that this did need a little tweaking.  I had 1 pound of ground turkey, so I used 1/2 an egg yolk and a few tablespoons of italian style bread crumbs.  Instead of diced onion I used 1 tsp. of dried minced onion, 1 tsp. of dried parsley, 1/4 tsp. of salt, 1 clove of minced garlic, a dash of black pepper, and added 1 Tbsp. of worcesterchire and 2 tsp. of liquid smoke.  They were a little on the dry side, maybe because we cooked them too long (first timers) or because that's the consistency of turkey meat (dryer than beef).  Whatever the case they're good for you and we'd be up for trying them again.

It's a good idea and easy to expand on. Much better than eating them plain.

Good recipe. This recipe, I left the salt out and used Mrs. Dash herbs and spices and everyone loved them. There are alot of spices out in the market place that do not have salt,which in my opinion is worse than fat.

Oh My!!! I have been condemned to a low fat, low cholestral diet.  I am a true meat eater.  I am a burger expert.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and steak rub seasoning.  I layered it tomato, romaine, lite mayo, ketchup and onion.  It was pretty dam good. It was moist and flavorful.  I was expecting something like meatloaf flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Can anyone find a substitute for Delmonico steaks?

4.21.11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/39748/actually-delicious-turkey-burgers/ ... These were actually good!  :D  Of course, all the turkey burgers I've tried here I've liked.  Just some more than others.  Anyway, these did taste more like beef than the others.  Let me explain a little more that statement.  They didn't taste like great hamburgers, but burgers.  Unseasoned, kinda plain burgers; but still like beefy burgers.  I didn't try to fool anyone.  Next time, for kicks, I might.  :D  What I did:  1#ground mixed turkey; 2T plain bread crumbs; 1/8t onion powder (tried cooking onion inside before & they didn't cook, just heated); 1/8t each salt, pepper, garlic powder, liquid smoke, worcestershire, soy; 1T dried parsley. I meant to add 2T mayo for the egg whites, as suggested for moistness; but I forgot.  It seems adding mayo would've only made them oily since they were already moist.  One thing I always do with burgers of any type (including fish), is put them in the freezer a while - twenty or more minutes - before cooking.  It helps keep their shape & retain moistness. Note4Me:  Per most helpful review, sub mayo for egg whites.  Read more.10.12 After review w recipe: Added 1/4t liquid smoke & worcestershire, & although the others were good, I think more of these ingredients made it better.  Still didn't add mayo or egg at all. 3/13 1 1/2# mixed turkey; 1/4c plain breadcrumbs; 1/4t liquid smoke, salt, onion powder, garlic powder; 2T worcestershire; 1/2t fresh black

I always get frustrated at reviews which don't rate the recipe and instead rate the recipe according to the modifications that they have made to it... I can't lie.. I don't know how the recipe is without the modifications of worchestershire, soy sauce, hicory smoke, seasoned salt, extra garlic and extra onion.  The modified recipe I can give 5 stars to.  I am not a fan of turkey burgers, but I think without the mods it would have been a 4 star which is worthy, but why not modify it to make it rave-worthy?  I love the modified recipe.

I make these several times a month, and they are delicious.  If you're worried about them sticking to the grill, try spraying with floured Pam (the baking spray).  It works like a charm!

These are the best burgers EVER. However, I did add in some of my own concoctions. I did add cilantro and milk, more garlic until they were really moist. I also put them on a BBQ flat grill over the regular BBQ grill and they turned out so amazing!

I've made this so many times as the recipe is written over the years and everyone loves them.  They freeze well too.  When my 81 year old father comes to visit, he can't eat anything green due to the Vitamin K interacting with his blood thinner medication.  So when he comes I substitute celery leaves for the parsley leaves (yes I realize they are both green and thus have vitamin K in them, but his doctor says the celery is not as bad as the parsley).  Either way they are good.

These are a delicious alternative to beef burgers! I make them all the time. I use 1 whole egg, I've tried both dried parsley and fresh, I add red or green diced bell pepper, & canned chilies. I've served it a bunch of different ways: plain with provolone cheese and mayonnaise, with sauteed garlic mushrooms, on an onion bagel, etc. and it's delicious either way!

These were GREAT! YUM!  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception- I followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer- I used a whole egg instead of a white (i halved the recipe)  Also- I coated the burgers with a light coating of flour.  I know it sounds strange- but it worked PERFECTLY!  What a great suggestion! I always had problems with turkey burgers in the past! That is why I rarely make them- but this time it worked like a charm!  I also coated the grill grates with pan spray and- Hey- Did I mention that that these were PERFECT?  Thanks! YUM.

These turned out great - moist and flavorful.  Cut recipe to 4 burgers. Used wheat bread crumbs and added a Tbsp. of bbq sauce since they weren't seasoned, and season salt instead of regular.  Even my husband likes them and this is his first turkey burger.  I used to work at a restaurant that served turkey burgers with grilled zucchini, onions, and mushrooms (which I omit) under melted cheese, thousand island dressing, and a slice of tomato - try it, it's yummy!

A great recipe for otherwise dry but very healthy ground turkey. I used Shady Brook extra lean ground turkey; added more fiber and healthy fats by replacing the bread crumbs with flaxseed meal; and  to compensate for omitting *seasoned* bread crumbs, added 1 teaspoon of fresh crushed rosemary. I finished them by melting 1oz each of Monterey Jack cheese over each. While not on a diet but enjoying the benefits of my new healthy cooking, my husband thought they were unexpectedly flavorful and juicy. Thank you Trudy for the standard in turkey burgers!

These turkey burgers were actually delicious.  When my husband and I were almost finished eating dinner, I asked him what he thought about the turkey burgers.  He said, "They're turkey?!"  Enough said. =] I used 2 lbs of turkey, 2 handfuls of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 small onion, a whole egg in lieu of 2 egg whites, dried parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.  I formed 8 patties, and let them chill in the fridge for about an hour or so.  Then they were grilled on a preheated Foreman for grill 3 minutes, turned over, and grilled for 2 more minutes.  Juicy burger perfection.  Thanks so much!!

Not bad, but I felt it need some help in the flavor department. Also, when grilling be sure not to flip them too often and move them around as little as possible because I find it dries them out.

These are just what they claim to be - actually delicious turkey burgers! They have replaced beef burgers in our home (which were not often served) and we eat these twice a month. Even our three oldest (7,5,3) love them!  I now add an entire egg and two dashes of soy sauce with two dashes of worcestershire sauce - PERFECT EVERY TIME and NO falling apart.

These were so, so good!  Very moist and flavor filled.  I took the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and added a tbsp each of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce, and that made them taste really beefy.  My family had no idea they were eating turkey!  Great recipe, will definetly make these again and again.

Incredible!  I absolutely stayed away from turkey burgers because they were too dry for me to choke down.  I don't eat much turkey at all, for that reason.  These were awesome!  I served them to my extended, health conscious family to rave reviews.  They even made the wheat buns taste better.  I served them with red potatoes which I sliced, put in a plastic bag with some olive oil and onion salt.  Baked them at 375 for about 40 minutes.  A nice green salad and it made a pretty healthy meal.

My new fave turkey recipe! Nice and juicy, they're every bit as yummy as a hamburger!

I have made these burgers several times and have been impressed. As written, they are pretty good, but if you add a couple splashes of Worcestershire and a couple of soy sauce, I'd call them excellent. I grew up on a beef farm, so eating a turkey burger is a stretch for me. But I've tried several and these are the only ones worth making twice.

Made these exactly as written except omited the parsley because I nerver have any.  Thought I had some Montreal Steak Seasonning but couldn't find it;  will add some next time as suggested by other reviewers.  Can't comment on the blandness becuse we had some wonderfully ripe tomatoes and dill pickles on them.  Will be making them again.  Oh...They weren't dry at all.  I cooked them quickly on my George Foreman grill set at high.

I have tried many recipes for turkey burgers and never been very satisfied with any of them.  This is the best one I've tried yet.  I increased the garlic, used seasoned salt instead of plain, added a splash each of soy sauce and Worcestershire, and crushed up some homemade croutons for the seasoned breadcrumbs.  Did these on the grill outside and they held together perfectly.  We will make these again with the above changes.  Thank you!

These were very good! I've never had a turkey burger I liked, but I'm sold on these. Even my VERY picky 3 yr old ate it! It was so nice to sit at the dinner table w/ my 5 children and hubby and not hear one complaint! That's worth more than 5 stars in my book! I only had 1/2 the turkey, and I actually forgot about this while I was making them and ended up adding the same amount of ingredients to it. oops! I also ran out of bread crumbs (grrr!) so I seasoned some panko crumbs and used those instead. Then I coated the outside of the formed burgers in the seasoned panko crumbs. Delicious!! A keeper for sure. My hubby said he enjoyed these just as much, if not more, than regular burgers! Oh yeah...I took the advice of others and added a few dashes of low sodium soy sauce and worcestershire sauce. :)

These are GREAT! Don't listen to the negative comments. I cut all the ingredients in half to make 6 burgers instead of 12. My deviations from the recipe; I used 1 whole egg, italian seasoned bread crumbs and added some dashes of worcestershire. Grilled them on the bbq and they were perfect!

Made these for the first time last night and they were a HUGE hit!  

I followed some of the other reviewers and used a whole egg; added a splash of worcestershire sauce and a splash of soy; I also added approx. 1 tbsp of Dijon mustard and upped the amount of breadcrumbs slightly.  

My husband (who is a big meat eater) LOVED these and said he'd rather have them over beef burgers everytime.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe :0)

These are great, and turkey is so much healthier than beef. We make these all the time, add a little Lawry's seasoning salt and put a slice of mozzarella on top a few minutes before it's done and viola! Amazing.

"You know, I don't even miss red meat anymore." That's what my husband said a couple of bites into his turkey burger. We try to eat mostly fish and poultry and limit our red meat intake, so I was really happy to hear him say that! I made 1/3 recipe for 4 burgers. We grilled them and they were fabulous.

Good turkey burger. Not as dry as many others. I did add worcestershire and diced jalapenos and I think they were a great addition to the final flavor.

I make these at least once a week. I add a splash of Worcesteshire (?), use crumbled toast, and use the whole eggs--everyone loves them. I don't think they taste like beef, but that's fine, because turkey is delicious.

Excellent!  Made them pretty much as called for and my husband and I really liked them.  Grilled 8 on the stove in a cast iron griddle and froze the rest.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

These were so delicious!  I will make regularly.  It so makes ground turkey taste so good.  I think I will add a little bit of fresh jalapeno next time to give it a little kick!  Also put cheese on them....yum!

Loved this recipe.  I only had a pound of ground turkey so I modified a bit (by eye, no measurements) and I also used a George Foreman grill for the first time.  They turned out really good.  Toasted the bun as well.  I will be making this again for sure :)

These were a little lacking in flavor but I think that is common with turkey burgers. Next time I will try to add more herbs into the mixture to see if that helps. Would make again!

My husband is a HUGE burger fan, so I wasn't sure how he'd like these. He LOVED them. I reduced the recipe for 1 pound of ground turkey and didn't add parsley since I didn't have any. PERFECT! I pan-cooked them, but they weren't getting hot enough in the center, so I finished them in the oven. I served them on some pan-grilled garlic toast and a little Dijon.  My husband is already asking for them again!

These are awesome!  I make them as written and even my picky burger purist loves them.  I've done them both as sliders and "regular" sized burgers.  Great with provolone cheese and a really nice bun (try Belles Hamburger Buns from this site), thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe quite closely, with the exception of the parsley.  I used (Italian bread crumbs) which consisted of some dried parsley, so I didn't add any fresh parsley. (I highly doubt that had anything to due with how these turned out).  I cut the recipe in half and used a whole egg instead of whites as suggested by many of the reviews.  Unfortunately these were borderline inedible.  These lacked flavor, a lot of flavor, and the texture was something that I couldn't get past. This recipe needs a lot of tweaking, to say the least.  I see now why the majority of people added different flavor enhancing ingredients, but I wanted to try this without customizing it.  Big mistake.  With that in mind, the title of this recipe may need some rethinking.  If duplicated exactly, "delicious" definitely doesn't come to my mind.

I've had this recipe in my box for a while now...Husband and I have been trying to eat healthier and I've been substituting turkey for ground beef in most of my recipes, but I was just very hesitant about a turkey burger...I finally decided today that I would give it a try...And we were both very pleasantly surprised! He could NOT believe it when I told him it was a turkey burger! He even said that he'd love to have another one...That's a HUGE compliment!  The recipe as is I give 4 stars (maybe even 3). I think though that it needs a little bit of love to be 5 stars. I read through reviews and followed some advice and the outcome was great! I scaled the recipe to serve 4 because there's just 2 of us...I used a whole egg instead of just the white, and I used 3 times as much breadcrumbs as the recipe called for...I used seasoned salt instead of just salt and used a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. So good...  The only thing was that I thought they needed a little more breadcrumb...They had a hard time sticking together. I saw in a few reviews to dip the patties in flour before frying...I tried that on one of the patties, didn't think it helped it hold together...and the ones without flour actually browned like a normal hamburger...the one with flour just had a weird texture to me...So I'd add more breadcrumb and skip the flour.   Thanks so much for the recipe...These are actually delicious!

Great turkey burgers! Not too oily, probably because of the lean meat. I used scallions because it was all I had, and it worked wonderfully. We put em' out on the grill. Make the full batch and stick the extras in the fridge for lunch the next day!

This a fabulous base recipe. You can really throw in some personal touches here. I added more garlic and some good old Worchestershire sauce (what's a burger without that?!). Served them on toasted whole wheat buns with with diced jalepenos, a splash of A1 steak sauce, and swiss cheese. Terrific! (And my family- who hates ground turkey- loved these burgers!)Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicous! I scaled the recipe down to 1 lb of ground turkey to make 4 burgers since there's only 2 of us in our house. Didn't have a garlic clove so I used a tsp of garlic powder which was just as good I thought. I used a Tupperware hamburger press to make 4 perfectly shaped 1/4 lb burgers and then grilled for 6 minutes per side on the gas grill at medium/high heat. They were delicious!

Really good.  My husband won't even let me buy our usual brand of frozen turkey burgers anymore.  These were very moist (using low fat turkey, not the 99% fat free kind, which may make it a little drier).  I used dried parsley (reduced the amount by a third), and added Worcestershire sauce to the patties while they were cooking (didn't measure just dumped some on top of the patties, I always add worcestershire and sherry when cooking with ground turkey to give it more of a beef taste.) I also followed another review of chilling after making the meat mixture so that the flavors blend better.

I cut back on the bread crumbs a bit because I like a burger to taste like meat, not meatloaf.   Served with a chipotle chili tartar sauce that I found in Bon Appetit, these were very tasty.

I've made many turkey burgers and this one is absolutely wonderful! I used Italian bread crumbs, used dried minced onions, I didn't have any parsley fresh or dried so I omitted the parsley, used garlic powder out of laziness, lol! And these burgers are amazing.

These were awesome. I must say the nice thing about this recipe is that it truly is a basic recipe. For someone who isn't familiar with making homemade burgers, but is an experienced cook, I found this to be very helpful. I followed the main components of this recipe (the ratio between the turkey:bread crumbs:egg), but altered the rest of the recipe slightly. Number one, I was oddly out of onion, so I used dried onion flakes. I used dried parsley (also do to the lack of it in my kitchen), and added dried basil, lemon pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes. I also used the salt, keeping it to a very small amount because the seasoned bread crumbs should have that covered. I served this on a whole wheat bun, and with perhaps one of the best burger toppers- grilled pineapple- amazing! (To grill it, I just used the pan I made the burgers in for about 1 minute on each side). All I can say is wow.

This was a great starter recipe. I've made this many times now, though, and have definitely changed it quite a bit. A big flavor changer is adding a few dashes of soy and Worcestershire sauce.

These burgers are delicious! I fried turkey bacon ahead of time and added strips of that to the burgers before serving, and along with pepper jack cheese slices, you have a great burger!

After reading an article about how disgusting ground beef is, I have stuck with pork burgers (go good with Hyvee's pork seasoning!) but wanted to try something else. This was a hit right off the bat. I followed some other commenters' suggestions... added a few drops of worcestershire sauce, few shakes of McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning and whole egg instead of just whites. The patties held together beautifully, stayed juicy. Will absolutely add this to the rotation! Thanks Trudi!

Soo good.  I added teriyaki sauce and also followed the advice of other reviewers and added seasoning salt, the whole egg, extra bread crumbs, and more garlic, and a dash of soy sauce.  My husband loved them so much that after he ate his with the bun he went and ate 2 patties by themselves.

This is a nice, simple recipe - and one that's easy to personalize.
I've been making (and enjoying) a similar burger for years.  I use one pound each of ground turkey and ground chicken.  Add 1/4 cup Southwestern flavored Eggbeaters, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, one small finely chopped onion, 1/4 teaspoon cajun seasoning, 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper finely chopped fresh parsley and fresh oregano (about 1/8 cup combined). Mix in 8 ounces of Mexican or Taco seasoned shredded cheese and 1/4 cup of chopped hot pepper rings (from a jar). Form into 8 patties.
We never make beef burgers anymore.

A good healthy burger. Giving 4 stars because they need a lot of extras - I used oregano, creole seasoning, roasted garlic, worcestershire, liquid smoke, and frank's red hot sauce. Also used 2 whole eggs instead of whites to get a better consistency - still healthy. Makes 12 good-sized burgers.

Great recipe for turkey burgers. Made a batch for a beach BBQ and was complimented on how flavorful and moist these were. We topped them with American cheese and served them on whole-wheat buns with all the fixins.

I had a few issues with this recipe. I scaled it down to serve 4 as I wasn't about to take a gamble with 3 pounds of turkey, before testing the results out. Turns out this is one of those recipes that doesn't scale down successfully. Now calling for 5/8th of an egg white, I just put one whole egg in. The rest wasn't too hard to deal with, but I just found the result was dry and rather flavorless burgers. I see that many rave reviewers added a variety of enhancements. Not sure just what this needs, but I wouldn't make it again as written.

This burger is good, but try this....Since the Turkey Burger is such a dry burger, I always replace the egg, with 1 1/2 table spoone of olive oil mayo or just plain mayo. The oil and egg base bind and add moisture. Try it!!!!!!!Also, decrease your salt with adding Mayo:) Much healther....One more thing, I replace the parley with Tarragon. It's a much better flavoring for poultry meat.

The best turkey burgers I've ever made and I've tried many.  I scaled the recipe down to 1 lb gr turke (4 burgers).  The only change I made was cooking them to 170° rather than 180°.  Then let them rest 10 minutes.  Perfect!

Delicious! I just made these burgers for dinner, huge hit! Even my 2 year old, who refuses to eat hamburgers gobbled this up! Very moist burgers-unlike some of the reviewers I did not have a problem with the bread crumbs drying out the burgers, these were very juicy. I did make some changes to mine though. I cut the recipe in half because I only have a family of 3...this made 5 patties which was plenty. I added in some red pepper flakes, ground mustard, 10 shakes of Worchestershire, used seasoning salt instead of regular, and used a whole egg instead of just the white. I also grilled the burgers, which I think sealed in the juices really nicely! Topped with some american cheese and served with homemade french fries-delicious quick meal! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Our family loved this recipe.  I tweaked it some:  I adjusted the recipe for 2 lbs. of ground turkey, added two shallots instead of the onion, added approx. 2 tsp. of honey, 1 1/2 tsp. of mustard. 2 tsp. of brown sugar, a few shakes of worcest. sauce, ground cumin, sea salt, approx. 2 shakes of cayenne pepper.  I made sure my oil was nice and hot to give the burgers a nice browning, I browned each side then turned the flame down to medium low.    I also forgot to put the egg in until the "second batch" I didn't notice a difference.  These burgers were juicy and delicious. I served on whole wheat hamburger rolls with chipolte mayo. So delish!! Our whole family enjoyed.

Great starting point! It is very hard for me to get my boys to embrace ground turkey as a substitute for beef in anything, but I love them enough to keep pushing! Scaled the recipe to four servings and read alot of reviews which resluted in loving what I ended up with! Added finely chopped red pepper, chopped fresh cilantro (instead of parsley), (1) whole egg, a few shakes of worcestershire & light soy sauce, Mc Cormick Montreal Cix seasoning, I added the bread crumbs at my own discretion. The light layer of flour added to cover the patties I thought was key. My whole family loved this including my (10) yr. old son & his friend! I did put the patties into the fridge to firm up and made sure my oil was nice and hot before adding to the skillet. Thank you Trudi, I will make this recipe again!

I loved this recipe! My sister, who's an extreme food critic, loved it too! I substituted the onion and garlic with onion and garlic powder, because my younger siblings usually don't like onion and garlic... I used LAWRY'S Seasoned salt instead of regular salt and I added dried parsley instead of fresh parsley. This ended up tasting SO good, I would recommend this to a lot of people!

I made this twice. Once as the recipe states and the other using the suggestions from others. As the recipe is, it's a bit bland and dry and only worthy of a 3 star rating. Preparing this with a complete egg and adding Worcester sauce made it wonderful.  Additionally, turkey does NOT need to be cooked to 180 degrees. It's overcooked and thus dry. Cooking until the internal temperature is 165 will yield the best results.

FANTASTIC!! I halved the recipe-worked great. Omitted onions & substituted onion powder, added 1 tsp. worc. sauce & 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes & 1/8 tsp. cumin for smoky flavor & spice. After combining, I put mixture in fridge for 1/2 hr. to get flavors going. Also makes it easier to form the burgers. TIP: Coat spatula w/olive oil for easier transfer to the grill.Put on a gas grill over medium heat for 6 min. per side. Melted provolone cheese just before taking off the grill.Topped with fresh avocado slices (YUM!)sliced sweet onion & Heinz chili sauce. This recipe got my 15 yr old daughter to try avocado for the first time, her comment- THIS ROCKS!!

These are good, but make them even better by adding a couple Tbs of apple jelly.  Try it, you'll like it!!  Nobody can ever guess what that slight sweetness is.

Wow!  Just cooked this for the family.  Everyone loved it!  My oldest (seven) said it tasted like a "McDonalds" hamburger.  Mine tasted like a White Castle hamburger.  After the meal I revealed they were in fact turkey burgers.  I did add a little more garlic but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.

This recipe is perfectly named.  The only bread crumbs I had were "roasted garlic and spice," and I had to add quite a bit of extra to make the patties stay together.  Delicious.

A big YUM! I added a little grated parmesan to this recipe as well as more garlic (and we always sprinkle Montreal steak seasoning on any burger). To keep them nice and juicy I browned them well in my skillet, then added just a little water at the end of cooking, put the lid on and let them steam for about 5 min. OMG they were delish!

I halved the recipe and used ground turkey breast.  I was a bit worried about them being dry so I added about a quarter cup of finely chopped red bell pepper.  I also added some worcestershire like other reviewers.  They were moist and tasty.  I will probably make 'em again!  Thanks Trudi!

My first attempt at turkey burgers too!  They were great!  I made the patties, put them in the fridge for about 1.5 hours and they grilled up really nicely!  We'll be making these again for sure!

Having never tried a turkey burger, I must say that these were different.  The texture was much different from beef, and the burger seemed to be more filling than the normal hamburger.  The flavor was good, especially with pepper jack cheese and horseradish mustard!

Actually delicious is correct. I made this with some modifications, taking whatever I had in the house. I used dried parsley instead of fresh. Used a red onion, dash of basil, and a splash of soy and a couple teaspoons of A-1. Italian breadcrumbs too. I covered the skillet, which kept the flavors juicy. Quite tasty, thanks!

I read all the reviews and still had doubt it would pass the husband test, but he said he was very suprised and he ate it all (which is unusual (he's a light eatter).  This was the first time I ever made turkey burgers and am very glad I found this recipe!!

This is quick and easy and has become a weekly staple for our family.  I sometimes shred zucchini and broccoli and hide them in there so my toddler gets some extra veggies in her diet.  Thanks for a recipe for moist and delish burgers!

Great burgers!!  I did what some people suggested.  I cut the recipe down to 4 servings.  Added 1 whole egg, shakes of worcestershire sauce, splash of light soy sauce, & 3-4 drops of Hot sauce.  I will be making these a regular on our dinner table & sharing this recipe with everyone I know!!!  Thanks!!!

I have made this now twice. Very good. I like the grilled flavor, so I brown each side on the stove and then finish on the grill. I once put them straight on the grill and they stuck.

These are SO good! Even my red meat-eating husband loves them! I scaled it down to 1lb of ground turkey since there are just 2 of us and it still made 4 thick, juicy burgers. These are better than any store bought version!

I was pleasantly surprised with the great results of this easy recipe. I have made concoctions of my own in the past but they lacked the savory appeal and texture of this recipe. If your family has resisted turkey substitutes in the past, try the all white meat ground-it is wonderful and worth the cost just for the sake of variety.

This was really simple and tasty, instead of the regular hamburger buns, I put them between bagguettes for a different texture, just make sure that the bread isn't too tough or it will be hard to bite through considering that there is a piece of patty between them.

I did cut this recipe down to 4 servings and used the proportional amount of ingredients.  The burgers needed more flavor. I only modified two things: 1. I added a few shakes of Worcestershire 2. I used the whole egg not just the white. The burgers came out very juicy but were lacking flavor. Also I formed my patties and put them in the freezer for about 30 minutes. They held together perfectly when I put them on the grill. I will definitely make this recipe again, but will add some seasoning salt, more Worcestershire sauce, and some onion and garlic powder. Overall good base recipe.

Amazing for turkey burgers! Followed the recipe exactly, but decreased everything for just 1 pound of meat. The only other change was using one whole egg instead of 5/8 of an egg white (to hard to measure!). These came out very moist and delicious. It certainly had something to do with the ingredients, but also pan frying (never did that before with turkey burgers) may have helped keep some of the moisture (maybe some fat?!?). Regardless we really like them. This is a keeper!

the first time I added the bread crumbs and eggs, it did not taste good and, they were dry. the second time I left out the eggs and bread crumbs and they were better. I guess if you use the bread crumbs it may be better if they were soaked in milk first.

Great burgers. I had some mushrooms that needed to be used so I sauteed them - about 2 cups raw - with some onion and pureed the mix in the blender and added it to the burgers. Made them taste "meatier" in a way.

Great recipe.  I've made these about 50 times and always slightly "tweak" the recipe.  Like other reviewers have suggested, I always use a whole egg instead of the two whites.  I also add about a teaspoon of worcheshire sauce and about a teaspoon of soy sauce.  Finally, to keep the patties from sticking to the grill, I pour flour in a shallow bowl and coat the patties before grilling.  This keeps the burgers from sticking.  We prefer these burgers to beef burgers - they're that good.

These really were good! I added an additional egg as directed, and made my own bread crumbs in the food processor. I also dusted them with flour to help develop a crust and hold them together. My family prefers ground beef burgers, but these are a great change of pace. I'd like to try them on the grill, but I can see where they might fall apart. I liked them with the usual burger toppings.

The amount and size of diced  onion is critical.  If too much or especially-- too large, the patties crumble. should be diced on a scale similar to the ground meat. Up to 2 Tbl-spoons per pound meat works; which is a bit more than the recipe calls for. I'm also adding a cap full of liquid smoke per pound.
I'm grinding boneless/skinless chicken breast for less fat. looking online what commercial meat producers add to compensate for low fat meat in burgers and sausage,  I settled on adding 1/2 ounce (dry weight) textured soy protein per pound. I mix all my dry and vegetable components in a small bowl, (including bread crumbs and DRY parsley) add water a bit at a time till everything is nicely hydrated. with just barely a bit of standing water at the bottom of the bowl. Add egg white, mix and add this mixture to the meat as I'm grinding it. This minimizes excess kneading of the mix after it's ground.

This recipe is a favorite among my family of meat eating men! We have served this to guests and always get rave reviews! These turkey burgers will surprise and satisfy even the most traditional beef-burger-lover in your life!
This recipe is delicious as-is, but each time I make them I try to add a little personalized twist to make them a little different. Some of my favorite additions include: 1-1.5 cups of chopped baby bella mushrooms, 1 cup feta cheese, handful of pitted and chopped kalamata olives, dash of worchestershire sauce, dash of cayenne, dash of powdered mustard. The mushroom addition is my favorite trick to use when trying to stretch the recipe into more patties in order to feed more hungry mouths! Always a hit! The fresh parsley and onion are non-negotiable in my opinion! Sometimes I do sub fresh garlic for garlic powder, however. The breadcrumbs I add only as-needed to get the patties to the correct consistency.

I made these exactly as directed, and they turned out great! I was looking for a more bland turkey burger, since most other recipies go over the top with ingredients and seem to overpower. I recently had the BEST turkey burger I've ever had and is only 550 calories at a local chain restaurant. I wanted to attempt to duplicate it. These were comparable! I served on a whole wheat bun with grainy stone ground mustard, tomato, lettuce, pickle slices and red onion. The family ate them up!

Huge success!  I used ground chicken instead of turkey and added a little salt.  They turned out great!  I put them in a pita with some spinach leaves, alfalfa sprouts, mozzarella, and sliced cherry tomatoes.  My husband (who is a very picky eater) gobbled them up!  Will definitely make this again!

I made these today with extra lean all white ground turkey. I added a teaspoon of smoke flavoring and some minced onions to the ground turkey. I cooked them on an indoor grill, and topped them with a dijon mustard/mayo combo, extra sharp cheddar, and lettuce/tomato/red onion. These were great, I could eat these everyday if all turkey burgers tasted like this! Served them with a side salad and baked sweet potato fries. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow! Turkey burgers were great.  Now, I did as others suggested and added some liquid smoke and a little Worcestershire sauce.  I also sauteed my onions, garlic and some red peppers first before adding them to my turkey.  Burgers were very moist and tasty.  Served them on onion rolls.  Didn't feel as guilty about eating them like I do when I eat beef burgers.

Wow, this was soooooo good!! I used 1lb of turkey, 1 egg white and eye balled the rest and threw in the ingredients listed. I did add red pepper flakes and just a bit of soy sauce. We grilled it, added Swiss, onion roll, avacado, tomato, mayo & dijon. Highly recommend!! This will need to go into the rotation.

This was really good! Turkey has always been really hard for me to season  enough to taste, but this had great taste and texture! I used ground turkey over ground turkey breast and also just used a pound. By doing 1/3 of the recommend ingredients we had a easy and quick 4 burgers!

Very good. Added a splash of soy & worcestershire for more flavor. Turned out nicely on my grill pan. Made 9 patties and the rest I rolled into meatballs and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. They were great!

These burgers were great!  As per the suggestions of others, I reduced the recipe to 1 lb of ground turkey, used 3 good shakes of worchestershire sauce, a whole egg, and dusted the patties with flour.  Very very tasty.  Thanks!

Love these turkey burgers! My favorite way to serve these is with barbecue sauce on sandwich thins. 

However, I do not care for the mix used as meatloaf.

I love turkey burgers and never thought I would.  I would modify this recipe as follows:

I only make 6 and cover them in plastic wrap and then put in a freezer bag for later use.

Mine is simple - use plenty of diced onions (almost a whole small onion) - they keep the burger moist - and half of a small green pepper chopped fine.  I add about 2 tbs. of Worchestershire sauce; a few drops of Texas Pete; a few drops of olive oil; sprinkle of Montreal Steak Seasoning; and salt. 

I then form them into FLAT patties w/a hole punched in the middle so they will cook evenly.  They freeze beautifully and defrost quickly.  Moist and delicious as a "faux" burger.

These were quite good.  The  only change I made was I used 2 chopped green onions instead of the diced onion called for, they were moist and very tasty..This would also make a great meatloaf.  Thanks for sharing!

I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used 1/2c. bread crumbs, 1 whole egg, 2T soy sauce instead of salt, and 2tsp of Worcestershire sauce.  We cooked them on the grill and the family gobbled them up.  My husband ate 3 and said he liked them more than regular burgers.  My kids both ate 2.  I would have gone back for seconds but I was full.  These were excellent!  4 stars because we altered the recipe.

Added Italian bread crumbs, onion powder, 2 egg whites and 1 yolk, some dried parsley, garlic powder, seasoning salt, worsch and soy sauce.  made huge patties (6 big and 2 small) and broiled them about 10 min each side.  Tasted like a meatloaf on a bun.  I think I went too light on seasoning--I guestimated amts.  Would add more next time.

This is an awesome recipe, and is "actually" delicious.
I've been counting calories, and the 99% lean ground turkey is a great source of low fat protein...but it definitely needs a flavor boost.  I had 1.25 lbs on hand, and scaled the recipe accordintly.  I did use a medium sized shallot in place of the onion, and a whole garlic clove.  I also added a T of basil paste along with a pinch of rosemary.  Cooked it on the grill (next to my husband's beef burger), and it was the first time I didn't have burger envy.  Juicy and delicious--cooked to 170 degrees (white meat turkey).  Thank you for contributing this recipe!

While they did have more flavor than the usual turkey burger recipe, I really think that they needed a lot more flavor and seasoning to really pop.  I think this recipe is a good basis for adding some extra spices.  On the other hand, if you find yourself disappointed with the flavor, a little dijon mustard gave this just the zip it needed in a pinch!

I used lean ground chicken instead. They were fantastic!I grilled them on the bbq.I was very happy how well they stayed together and how easy they were to flip.Don't ruin these with any kind of bbq sauce,the spices made them perfect.

Based on other reviews I added one whole egg instead of the two egg whites, doubled the bread crumbs, used Lawry's instead of the salt and added 10 drops Worcestershire Sause, one shake regular soy sauce and about 3 drops of liquid smoke.  Laid burgers in some more bread crumbs on either side and dimpled the middle before placing in pan. Certainly cannot tell it is turkey!  Picky beef loving husband (and when I mean beef, we are used to fresh raised beef from the farm) approved.  It certainly isn't the same as beef, but it is a nice break from the usual burger. Will make again.

The name doesn't lie; these burgers rival beef burgers, and that's saying something coming from a big fan of red meat. I made most of the recommended changes of the 'most helpful' review (adding more garlic, using the yolk as well as the egg white, worcestershire, and a tad of soy sauce). Like the second 'most helpful' review, I grilled them on a George Foreman, and they came out just fine!

Delicious! Will be making these and these only from now on instead of beef burgers. Excellent flavor! I use 1 pkg of 20oz jenny O ground turkey, double the onions and use about 3 tbsp bread crumbs and 2 garlic cloves minced. Use on stove top grill pan on med heat (about 3-4 on turn knob) for 14 min. 7 each side.

Definitely need to use 1 whole egg instead of 2 whites.  It's the yolk that holds the meat together.  I kicked up the garlic a bit and added diced red pepper.  Yum!

These turned out sooooooooooo good!! I waited until my family started eating the burgers to tell them they were eating turkey. I was amazed at how my 4yr old son and 13y/o nephew ate them so quickly!! Not a single complaint and the picky eater (my son) asked for seconds.

We've had already prepared turkey burgers and were not big fans.  We thought we'd try these, since we made them ourselves.  They were really good!  I will make them again!  Next time on the grill!  Thank you for a good recipe!

These were delicious.  I took other reviewers’ advice and added Worcestershire, an entire egg, and shredded cheese for moisture. I also grilled them on the grill.  They were juicy and full of flavor.  These were the best turkey burgers I’ve had yet.

The title of this recipe is an understatement.  These burgers were OFF THE CHAIN!  Just made a couple of changes.  I used whole wheat seasoned bread crumbs and I used dried parsley--didn't have fressh parsley on hand.  Will make again and again and again.  Thank you, Trudi, for sharing this delicious recipe!!!

Everyone loved them better than the beef patties.  I followed the advice of others by adding reduced sodium soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, seasoning salt, more garlic, egg yolk, red bell pepper, and a light coating of flour.  I served them with lettuce, mayo, mustard, bacon (optional), and orowheat sandwich thins.  They were a hit.  I will make these again.

i can't believe i haven't rated this recipe until now - i've been making it forever and it is without a doubt my standby burger recipe.  i usually halve it but otherwise stay true to how it is written and it is really no-fail.  juicy, flavorful burgers that are sooo good.  kids love them, hubby enjoys them too even though they aren't beef, and i feel better about serving a lower-fat alternative to cheeseburgers!  i tend to cut mine up, toss in BBQ and serve over a spinach salad, which imho is delish!!  thanks!!

This is a good, versatile turkey burger recipe.  These burgers break the mold from the bland floppy patties I usually associate with turkey burgers.  I had success both with pan frying and with using the Foreman grill.  I will make again and I recomend.

Love these. They work well on the WW diet. I make them (about four servings not the 12 it originally makes) and then cover them with a TB of hummus and some sprouts or lettuce and eat it for lunch! SO good and keeps me soooooooo full for so long! They are really healthy! I use organic free range turkey and homegrown parsley! LOVE IT!

Excellent. Make sure not to make the patties too thick. They puff up to about 1.5x the original thickness. I'm still trying to get that right but otherwise very juicy and taste great.

Great flavor! I took advice from the other reviewers and added Wors. sauce, hot sauce, soy sauce, steak seasoning, and seasoning salt. Turned out great!

These are good burgers but I wouldn't call them delicious. Made these twice and I can't get them to taste like anything other than meatloaf. I have other turkey burger recipes so I don't think I'll be using this one again, except for maybe meatloaf.

These are AWESOME!  Not dry like many other turkey burgers, adding the Worchestershire and Soy sauce rounds out the recipe.  I did need a little more bread crumbs than called for to hold the patties together but the crumbs gave the exterior a yummy crunch.  This is going to be a go to recipe for grilling!!

These were quite good.  I used plain bread crumbs but added some chopped red bell pepper, some dried parsley since I was low on fresh, a dash or two of Worcestershirer and used a whole egg.  You have to modify the bread crumbs for the consistency you like.  I also dusted with flour before pan frying which added a nice browning to it.  Husband and kids all liked them.

I made half the recipe and it made 8 big thick burgers. Use the whole egg for perfect moisture. Double the onion and garlic. Add 1 tsp worchestershire and 1/4 tsp liquid smoke to boost the burger flavor. Very good!

If I could give a negative rating I would. These are terrible. No flavor, no substance, no texture, no color, won't hold together on a bun let alone while cooking. If you were starving in a gulag somewhere you might be able to choke one down. Otherwise, move on to the next recipe. Quickly.

I LOVED this version of a burger...and the best part is, my kids thought they were wonderful too!  I will put the leftover burgers in the fridge for tomorrow's lunch (and maybe even dinner...hehe).  I will definitely be making this recipe again...and again...and again!

Ok I cut this recipe down to a third and used a whole egg instead of just the egg white, and I used 2 cloves of Garlic instead of one and didn't have any fresh parsley.  I have tried lots of Turkey burger recipes that end up dry or won't hold together.  This was juicy, tasty and overall fantastic.  Made it with some sweet potato fries.  YUMMY

I used a pound of turkey and just eyeballed all the rest of the ingredient amounts....they turned out fabulous!  I did use one whole egg and subbed onion powder for the minced onion and I added worchestershire.  I lightly floured both sides of the burger which helped it form into a patty a little better, making it much less sticky.

These stayed so moist and perfect, even when grilled. The flavor was mild, but very good. (I did forget the pepper completely.) I already want another one. So good, and so simple! Thank you! - Went very well with Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls.

These were really great, and surprisingly super moist!  When I cut into one to check for pink, juice poured out.  I basically followed the recipe, except that I used the whole egg, and I added a good amount of feta cheese.  Delicious!

I've tried a few turkey burger recipes  and thought this one had a chance.  But, this settles it -- the good Lord meant for burgers to be made of beef.

These were very good. I added Worcestershire sauce and a little soy sauce, but other than that I left the recipe as-is. I was pleasantly surprised, as my turkey burgers tend to turn out a little dry and not at all comparable to their beef counterparts, and are generally drowned in condiments to compensate. I topped these with sauteed mushrooms and onions and garlic mayo (olive oil mayo + garlic powder). Will definitely be making these again.

Our family made a New Year's Resolution to eat healthier so for the past few months we have avoided the fast food scene. However, this past weekend we were all craving a thick juicy burger.  I was about to give in when I found this recipe. The only change I made was to sauté the onions and garlic together first. I put them on the grill and they turned out great, even to a family of junk food junkies! Ha! Thanks for helping us stay on track. I would definitely make these again.

These were very good!  I wouldnt say they were "better" than a burger - because they are very different than a burger, but are great. I made several changes after reading a lot of reviews.  Used whole egg rather than egg white, added Worchestershire sauce and soy sauce.  Added red pepper flakes, used Lawry seasoning salt for my salt, and doubled the bread crumbs. Also did coat in flour before pan frying. Topped with pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, ketchup and mustard.

I left out the onions b/c of personal preference.  I did add alot more spices...chili powder, garlic, worstechire sauce, a little A1, etc.  I think they can use the extra kick but are very delicious!

Nothing will ever replace a good hamburger, ever.  But WOW!! Turkey burgers with flavor and substance!! i was very surprised!  I did use one whole egg and splashed in some soy sauce and red pepper flakes to give it some zip. I will definately be making this again.

I made these with ground turkey. To keep it as a "low-carb" meal, the hamburgers were mixed with low glycimic level oatmeal instead of bread crumbs, and shaped into rectangles to fit into a low-carb rectangular wrap! DELICIOUS!!!

This was a very good recipe.  It gets just the four stars because it really does need the extra flavoring of the Worcestershire and soy sauce.  I tried it twice.  The first time with the extra sauces and my family loved it.  The second time I tried it as the recipes states exactly without anything extra and they were just alright.  So, pretty much if you're going to try this recipe I suggest going the route everyone else is going and add the Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.  I don't know about the liquid smoke though.  I didn't try it.

FABULOUS!  I do not make hamburgers (never been successful).  But now this is all we eat in place of hamburgers!  I added the soy sauce, worchestshire, and liquid smoke as others suggested.  It was wonderful!

This recipe was great!  My family (husband, parents and my sister) all loved the burgers.  I made a few changes: I used 1-1/3 lbs lean ground turkey and 1 lb lean ground beef, 1 whole egg, 2 cloves garlic (we LOVE garlic), oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs, and Worcestershire sauce.  It was yummy!!!

These were very good.  I did change a few things according to other reviews. I added liquid smoke, soy sauce, and worcestershire sauce.  I didn't measure it just added a little at a time till it smelled good.  I did add a little more than 1/4 cup bread crumbs to help with the stickiness (it was still pretty sticky though). Did not use fresh onions but added some dried minced onions into the mix.  Used two cloves of garlic and a little garlic powder.  Also used egg beaters for the egg and seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  I did a slight coating of flour and Montreal Steak Seasoning (McCormick) to the formed patties.  I cooked them on my George Foreman (wanted to grill them outside but was afraid they would fall apart).  Served these with sauteed mushrooms.  Everyone ate them up.  Teenagers ate two of them, which makes them a hit at my house.  Will definitely make these again and again.

This is similar to the recipe I use except I use crumbed Frenchs Fried Onions instead of bread crumbs or onions, with a dash of onion powder. My daughter enjoys them and husband likes them with cheddar cheese, bacon, bbq sauce...  Still working on him to be more healthy.

I used minced onion and dried parsley instead of the fresh versions of both, and this still came out well.  The burgers were juicy and perfectly flavored without being too salty.  This will be my staple turkey burger recipe from now on.

My husband LOVES these burgers and he's not one to order a turkey burger at a restaurant.  I've made them several times and sometimes I add a thing or two but I always keep the basic recipe.  I've added fresh basil, hot sauce, and I usually add Worcestershire sauce.  The burgers have always turned out great. I'll probably be making them every week for awhile.

These were so good! I didnt have the bread crumbs and I think the parsely wasnt really neccessary, but they were still amazing. I cut the recipe by a third and still got five patties out of it. It makes so much. Unless you make giant burgers, this will probably get you more like 15 patties. I cooked them all up and frozen them to have later, they were still perfect and juicy.

I usually buy the turkey burgers that are sold as patties but this night I just had a pound of ground turkey and was clueless.  This is the burger recipe to try you will LOVE them.  I will never go back to the pre formed burgers again.  So easy and everything was already in my kitchen.

Yummy!  This is our staple turkey burger meal that we make at least once a month.  It is perfect for a healthy meal.  I add alvacado slices with some diced green chilies as a topping.

Very tasty and moister than I expected.  I added a little Worcestershire sauce as some other reviewers suggested.  We grilled them and they came out great…they didn’t stick to the grill at all.  I served them on a whole-wheat bun with lite mayo, tomato and avocado.

These came out very moist and tasty.  I used 1.3 lbs of turkey, so it made 5 nice-sized burgers.  I added a few splashes of worcestershire and a few splashes of soy sauce (as other reviewers advised).  I used one egg white and probably about 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs.  I cooked them on my grill pan sprayed with Pam on medium for 5 - 10 minutes each side.  My husband agreed, they were tasty burgers.. thanks for the recipe!

These burgers were wonderful.  I added about 7 shakes of worcestershire sauce, a TB of frank's red hot sauce, an entire egg, some grated parm cheese and I doubled the bread crumb amount.  I'm making these again tonight!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I folded up a piece of super sharp cheddar in the middle of the patties.  It gave a nice flavor and surprise in the bites.  This is the first Turkey burger that has not been bland and dry.  This is a definite make again recipe.  AND it is SO easy...

My whole family loved these!  I did add about 7-10 shakes of worcestshire (sp??) sauce, and I also cooked them on the grill....I think next time if I want the grilled flavor, I'll do them in my gas oven on broil.  Since there was so little fat in the meat, I had a problem with the meat sticking to the grill....they were still wonderful!  Had one for lunch today, too, and it was still tasty...

New Year, new changes. Substituted this recipe for our usual hamburgers. I did use 10 shakes of Worchestershire Sauce and pureed the onion to hide it. Used fresh homemade whole wheat bread crumbs and didn't add any additional seasonings to compinsate for the seasoned bread crumbs it called for. It WORKED! The burgers were very moist and tasted very good. Topped some with reduced-fat cheese. We had the leftovers for lunch the next day.

I was very impressed with how these burgers didn't dry out when reheated the next day. This is a really tasty alternative to hamburgers. I made up the mixture and then froze half and grilled half. Thanks for sharing!

This really is a good recipe.  We only had plain bread crumbs, so 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning were added.  The recommendation of adding Worcestershire Sauce was a good one. Instead of frying, they were cooked on the grill.  They were served on buns, but they are also great without the bun - very nice flavor.  Next time, I'll add a bit of red peppers to spice it up a bit.

Edited one year later to add:  just the mention of turkey burgers makes my children very happy.  They really enjoy this recipe.  It's great.

Pretty good! I used finely chopped green onion and grilled on the George Foreman grill, basting both sides with Worcestershire sauce to keep moist.  Hubby ate his with pepper jack cheese and mustard, and said they were even better as leftovers the second day!  Thanks!

Yummy!  I've actually only eaten turkey burgers at Red Robin's, and they were really, really good, so I was looking forward to making my own.  They tasted great!  I only made two and didn't bother scaling the recipe for two, I just mixed the meat with however much dried parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, bread crumbs (almost a whole slice's worth), salt and pepper as looked good.  And I used a whole egg white.  I thought they were better than normal hamburgers!  The only thing is next time I'll add more seasonings and although they are good on a bun with ketchup and mustard, the condiments cover up the flavor of the burger so I recommend just eating them with lettuce, tomato and maybe make them into turkey cheeseburgers.  Oh and I used my George Foreman grill and formed the patties on the grill.

THANK YOU for this delicious recipe AS IS. Here’s a thought for those of you who feel the need to comment with 467 changes to it. Feel free to write your own recipe, instead of trying to steal a recipe author’s thunder. This is the first review I’ve EVER written on this site. I joined just now because “the most helpful comment” was so pompous and disrespectful of the author. She needs to write her own recipe and not just try to ride the coattails of a VERY popular recipe. That’s just flat out pathetic. Grow up.

These were really good turkey burgers. The only thing is, there is no need to cook ground turkey to 180. 165 is the minimum safe cooking time. Cooking to 180 (or higher, which is always an easy mistake to make) could have contributed to the dryness some complained of. Also, if the burger seems to wet, just add more panko. I've made these four times on my gas grill. The two times I didn't grease the grates, the burgers stuck. The times I did grease, they came off without sticking.

This is a sure winner.  When using the lowest fat ground turkey white meat breasts work in about 1 tbs. butter or healthy spread.  Juicer result with a higher fat ground turkey though  Top with grilled onions, mushrooms and/or avocado and arugula.  SeNsAtIoNaL!!

I never used to buy ground turkey because it never tasted good to me and it always was "tough" next to just plain chicken.  Then I tried this recipe.  I love it.  It makes so many burgers and they are so moist.  I cook them all up and then bring them to work for lunch.  They reheat in the microwave beautifully and with a little mayo, lettuce, whatever, they are as good as when first made.  I have these more than I have regular burgers.  I never would have thought that that would happen.  I use Costco's pre-packaged turkey, and sometimes I add more breadcrumbs because the recipe is so moist.  I also just add a whole egg, rather than two whites.  It is a very forgiving and flexible recipe and one that friends have asked for.

I can tell just by reading, this recipe its a good one and I'm def going to try it. I wanted to add that anyone wanting to AVOID GLUTEN that all they have to do is substitute instant oats (measure for measure)vs the bread crumbs. I do it all the time, works perfect! Only confusion is the picture.. is that the right one? it looks like tuna salad, not a turkey burger, lol.

Love this recipe.  My kids aren't crazy about turkey burgers but loved these.  Rather than cooking all the way through on the stove, I charred each side for about 3 minutes on the stove in a grill pan then transferred to the oven for 7 - 10 minutes.  Moist and super flavorful!

These were absolutely the best turkey burgers ever!  I did add a tablespoon of Winchester sauce and substituted regular breadcrumbs with whole wheat. I added sautéed mushrooms under a thin slice of Swiss cheese!  Yum!!

Excellent recipe - kid and grownup approved.  I made the mistake of trying to grill these outdoors - they are a little delicate for that, next time will make as directed.  So good!  Will eventually try with cottage cheese, but the ricotta for a double dose of protein, but the ricotta is yummy.  I couldn't bring myself to add more cheese to the burger and it was great without.

made the recipe exactly as written except for 1 lb. ground turkey (94% lean btw) I threw in the whole egg.  pan-fried in non-stick over medium heat with a little olive oil and chicken broth.  Really moist and terrific.  Hard to please hubby just ate one and pronounced it 'good'.  psyched to have a good basic turkey burger recipe!  We ate them with frank's, so I do think they need some accompaniment.  This would work well for meatballs too I think.  Thank you Trudi!!

This became an instant family favorite. My 5 year old even asks for seconds and sometimes more! I had tried to cook with ground turkey before I found this recipe and had such bad results that I had sworn off ever buying it again. After reading these reviews though, I decided to give it one last try. It's a good thing I did! The title says it all.

Family loved them! The baby was even able to eat them. This is what I used:
1 lb ground turkey,
1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs,
2 egg whites, lightly beaten,
1/8 cup chopped fresh cliantro, 1/2 tsp of minced garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt (optional), 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper. They were light, and healthy, and delicious.

The whole family enjoyed these.  Little tweaks I made: I grated the onion and garlic, I added a splash of worchestershire, and a handful of rolled oats.  I used 2 lbs ground turkey, but didn't reduce the other ingredients. Really good!

Can't say that I followed this exactly, but modified my own family's meatball recipe a bit to make turkey burgers.  Similar to this, but includes Lucatelle or Romano cheeses.  Instead of the typical toppings of ketchup, American cheese, lettuce & tomato I used fresh mozzarella, tomato and a little mayo.  Delicious!  Thanks for the idea!

Very very delicious burgers. I make these all the time. I'll make up the 3 punds worth and freeze them to eat whenever I want. The only change I made to them was the seasoned bread crumbs. I use 1/8 cup because the seasoning in the breadcrumbs would overpower the over all taste of the burgers and make it too strong. By using have the amount, it made a ton of difference. Excellent recipe.

I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. These burgers are amazing! I don't even buy beef to make burgers anymore. After trying this recipe, turkey burgers are the only type of burger I want. This recipe is a definite keeper!

So I like others modified it a bit! I added the Worcestershire sauce, some soy sauce, more garlic, seasoned salt, and I just did one whole egg. They turned out really good!!! Also DONT GREASE YOUR GRILL! Rub the patties themselves with a little olive oil before and they don't stick one bit!! :) wish I could include a picture!

My 11 yr old son loved these and didn't even realize they weren't beef. But 6yr old took one bite and wrinkled her face up. I liked them a lot and will make again. I did follow the tips from AUSSIEMUM1 minus the red pepper. =)

These are so good.  I didn't think turkey could taste this good.  They reminded me of a lovely delicious meatball.  I can't believe how juicy they are!  I grated onion and garlic to keep it fine for the people who are still afraid of them:)  I also used more breadcrumbs because my mixture was very wet probably bc I had the turkey meat in the freezer and drained it as well as I could but it was wet.  Well, they were amazing and I did not add salt as the seasoned breadcrumbs have salt in them and we are a low salt family afraid of heart disease

made these last night for dinner, they were very good will do again for sure. I did as someone suggested and added a  generous sprinkle of McCormicks Montreal Steak Seasoning on top of patties. Since it takes some time to mix I made several and froze some for another time. Now  when I want to do again I just take from freezer and cook. I did cook in skillet as suggested to 185 temperature.

I don't think I've ever eaten a turkey burger in my life, but these were so easy to make and delicious!  The only thing I did differently was to add a splash of soy sauce, a splash of Worcestershire, and  sprinkle both sides with Montreal Steak seasoning before cooking.  I used a Tupperware hamburger press to shape the burgers and mine held together just fine.  I also covered the pan after flipping the burgers so they wouldn't dry out.  The burgers stayed very moist and juicy. De-lish! Thank you!

One simple change...to add a little flavour and moisture...saute the onion in a generous amount of butter first...saute until its very soft and golden...cool the onion and then add it in (butter and all)....delicious!!  I like more spices too...try thyme, paprika, or curry etc.  Great simple dish...the whole family loves them, with or without a bun!

THE BEST BURGER! I absolutely loved this burger!! It was so moist,juicy,and flavorful. I too made a few changes: I only had 1 pound of ground turkey, so i used 2 heaping Tbls of seasoned bread crumbs, 2 tbls spoon of minced onion and green pepper, (i saute it first with cooking spray until soft and let it cool)used 1 egg white, a tbls of dried parsley cause thats all i had, 2 tbls chopped fresh cilantro (try this it really added a freshness to the meat!) 1 clove fresh garlic, 1 teas garlic powder, a dash of seasoning salt instead of salt and pepper. the other thing i added that no one else i saw added was 2 tablespoons of zesty italian salad dressing! SO DELICIOUS AND JUICY!! also, when you form the patties, press a little indent with your thumb in the middle of the patty, it helps it not puff up so much. i cooked mine for two min on each side in a med heat skillet, then finished it in a 350 degree oven for 5 min. (added cheese to melt the last 3 min) came out juicy and perfectly cooked! MUST TRY

These were ok; if I make them again, I'll need to season them more.  However, for those who say that they fall apart, I took the advice of another reviewer and used a whole egg instead of two egg whites and they didn't fall apart at all.

So delicious!   added a bit of worcestershire sauce and a few dashes of season all but other than that, no alteration.  I served with turkey bacon as turkey cheeseburger wraps along with avocado, tomato, lettuce and cheese.  All three kids ate it happily.  Yum!

These were very good but next time I will use plain bread crumbs not the seasoned and just use a few spices to ramp up the flavor.  I was surprised at how juicy these were, most turkey burgers get dry when cooked on the grill.  The kids couldn't get enough of these and have asked to have them again.  Not something I hear enough in our house so these will be on rotation.

I was surprised that I liked this recipe.   Not typically a big turkey burger fan, but I did doctor up the flavors a little like other reviewers suggested (added a little soy for example).   Despite extra bread crumbs and full eggs with yolks, I could barely form burgers with this mixture.   It was fairly mushy, but I managed to get a flattened something to the pan and it did cook up and make a strong patty....so in the end....it all worked out.   Very moist and healthy alternative to beef burgers.

I had a housewarming recently and use this recipe to grill turkey burgers. THEY WERE A HIT! Everyone kept asking me where did I buy them and loved how moist & flavorful they were. I will definitely keep this recipe in my armory! :) Also, I was able to get 16 patties from this recipe!

Loved these burgers.  I made some changes.  I used one whole egg instead of egg whites.  I omitted the garlic but added 1/2 cup shredded garlic flavored cheese.  I also added some soy sauce and worcestershire sauce and about 1/3 cup minced red pepper.  Added mustard to the buns.  YUM YUM

This rating needs 10 stars....It was really that good.  After cutting the recipe back to feed only 4, the only thing different that I did was to use one whole egg and add Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce as others have suggested.  I can't wait to have them again!  The title says it all:  actually delicious!

took the suggestions and added worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, lawrys seasoning and it turned out great. Used a George Foreman grill and paired it with sweet potato fries.
**Edit** Cooked this again and was better than the first time! added liquid smoke and this time cooked it on the stove. Nice and juicy. Great paired with baked sweet potato fries and a fruit salad for dessert makes for a healthy meal.

Very good. I use this recipe as a base for meatloaf. It's so yummy. I use brown rice breadcrumbs and add Worcestershire, seasoned salt, garlic salt, a bit of onion/mushroom soup packet and a bit more salt and pepper. I have a nose like a wolf so I just sniff the raw meat until it smells delicious and then I pop it into a little dish and bake at 365 for approximately 1 hr or until my meat thermometer measures 180 degrees. Mmm. Thanks for this recipe! I use it often.

This recipe works quite well. I used 2.5 lbs instead of 3 to make use of 1.25 lb. Jenny O turkey packs, and I Formanized the meat instead of cooking the patties on a medium skillet. Result: juicy burgers without most of the fat. Thanks!

This is a pretty decent recipe. It was also my first time I have ever eaten turkey that wasn't on a sandwhich. Needlss to say turkey isn't my thing. The burgers tasted pretty good, a little too much parsley, but pretty good never the less.

Delicious turkey burgers. They come out juicy and you can eat them guilt free. We ran out of propane for our grill so I just cooked mine in a frying pan. They were great even that way.

Great base recipe. Of course we all personalize our recipes to our tastes.
The one thing I always use with ground turkey to help it with the dryness factor is the addition of grated/shredded carrot. It also adds a little flavor.
Thanks for the recipe!

This was okay, and I will do more to tweak it next time. Left out salt and parsley, and added a Laughing Cow Light Swiss Cheese wedge in each burger. I used 1.25 lbs ground turkey breast, and cut the rest of the ingredients in half. Cooked the onions in 1 T. olive oil before adding to retain moisture. Needs more flavor, so think I will try it with some cayenne or hot sauce next time. Nice and moist.

Awesome recipe! Husband had me make him up another after he devoured the first. :-) I halved this recipe and used 1.2 lbs of meat and got 4 good sized patties and the aprox calories in one that size is 200 (according to myfitnesspal) with 8.2 grams of fat, 80 mg cholesterol, 167 sodium, 13.5 potassium, 3.6 carbs, 22.7 protein, 4.8 calcium, 7.3 iron

They were okay for turkey burgers. I added some of the zippy things others recommended and still found them just so so, but they were fine for a halfway healthy burger.

Woooow! I was pleasantly surprised with just how delicious these really were! I took the suggestion of others and added an egg yolk to the turkey mixture, along with some Worcestershire sauce and soy! My boyfriend and I were both blown away by the texture, moistness and flavor!! Best turkey burgers I have ever had! Thank you for this recipe!

I LOVE these turkey burgers. I normally find turkey burgers really boring but these completely changed my mind. They always come out juicy and flavorful and meaty.

Delicious!  Made these last night and I'll definitely be making these again.  Hubbie also gave them a thumbs up.  Added all the "stuff" that Aussiemum did, except I used roasted red bell peppers from a jar.

Not sure why I never thought to add an egg before, but...thanks for the recipe! Thought this was really good and moist even with using very lean turkey. I did add some Worstershire and a bit of Soy Sauce and a whole egg, but the recipe was great!

I usually don't like turkey burgers, but these were quite good!  I followed some others' advice and used some freshly ground Italian spices, about 1/2 tsp, used a whole egg instead of the eggwhites, & added both soy sauce and worcestershire sauce. Since I didn't have any seasoned breadcrumbs, I used panko bread crumbs instead, increasing the amount to about 3/4 cup as well.  The red pepper from the Italian spices gave these a nice bite.  The recipe made 9 good-sized burgers; I cooked 4 and froze the rest.  Thanks for the recipe and tips everyone!

LOVE LOVE LOVE Turkey burgers!  The only burger we eat (except portobello mushroom burgers).  I add chopped red onion, bread crumbs, eggm garlic, & pepper and a good amount of feta cheese! Make the patties nice and fat to retain moisture- toss on the BBQ! Add tomato and lettuce & it's dinner time!

We've been using grnd turkey for our hamburgers for years, and now beef burgers have an undesirable  taste.  Turkey burgers dont have to be embelished; just prepare them as you would your old beef burger.

These tasted great.  My only issue is that there is a pocket of air in every burger.  When you try to squeeze it down, a lot of juices escape.

This was excellent!  I was short on time, so I used 1 lb ground turkey and eyeballed approximately 1/3 of the other ingredients.  I also used dried onion, parsley and garlic to save on time, used 1 egg white, and added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke.  I added a little more bread crumbs as well.  My DH (who had a beef hamburger), took a bite of mine and said that if he didn't know better, he would almost think it were a "real" hamburger.  I will make these again often!

These were very good and moist. What I like about this recipe is that it gives a lot of room to add ingredients to suit your tastes and make it your own. Will be making many variations of this recipe in the future.

Absolutely MAGNIFICENT!!! This recipe is without a doubt the BEST burger recipe HANDS DOWN!!! My wife isn't a big onion fan, so I changed it up a little, but she has already asked for me to make this again! This is a perfect Friday night treat that keeps you from spending $40 on 2 burgers at the neighborhood chain sit-down burger joint. A little leaf lettuce & roma tomato on wheat rolls with oven-baked sweet potato fries on the side was a perfect 'healthy' cheat meal!!! Thanks for sharing!

These were very tasty! I did have a little bit of trouble with the patties staying together so added the yolk as mentioned. I also grilled mine and was worried about them falling apart and sticking to the grill. I used cooking spray on the grill and about 30 mins before grilling I placed the patties on some wax paper on a cookie sheet and placed them in the freezer. This helped with handling them on the grill!

I'm generally not a turkey burger eater, but I tried these because I want to reduce my family's fat intake and use leaner meats.  These had so much flavor and were very moist.  My family loved them.  This one is definitely a keeper.  I did make a little modification by adding Mrs. Dash Onion & Herb Seasoning Blend to them.  I try to limit our salt intake so this was an excellent substitution.

As written, this recipe would probably only get 3 stars from me. I did what many suggested and added worchestershire and soy sauce, and increased the breadcrumbs a little. I also used the whole egg, not just the whites. I put a little flour on my patties and cooked them on the george foreman grill. served with potato wedges from the oven. Yummy!

These taste like they were seasoned with taco seasoning. Give this some consideration when selecting toppings for your burgers.

DELICIOUS!!!  I have never made turkey burgers before.  This was so good.  I liked it much better than regular hamburgers.  I used 2 T. mayo instead of egg whites.  I didn't use bread crumbs or parsley.  I added some worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.  Will make again and again.

Just as it says--actually delicious! I also added in a finely chopped apple to give it a little extra zing and texture. Excellent and easy.

Made these for the second time tonight. Had a break in the OR rain and felt the need to BBQ. These were great just like the first time. I took the first reviewers advice and added Worcestershire and an entire egg. They were juicy and full of flavor. Even my steak and potato loving father enjoyed them.

I am stunned I've never reviewed this - it has been a family favorite since I made it (as written) the first time.  In fact, I was making it when I signed onto AR for a different recipe!!  I often use 7# of turkey, (increasing other ingredients also), cook it all up, then freeze leftovers individually wrapped in plastic wrap and then in freezer bags.  Makes awesome quick dinners!  Can also crumble a defrosted burger into spaghetti sauce for a quick dinner!

I thought they were a little tasteless.  Overall they are very healthy but they need a little doctoring up.

Surprisingly moist for turkey burger.  I cooked mine on the George Forman grill.  I'll make this recipe again with a little added Cayenne pepper for more zip.

My husband's favorite food is a beef burger. He immediately seemed concerned when I said Turkey burgers were on the menu for the this week. But he loved them!! The texture was awesome, the flavors were delicious (we used dried basil instead of parsley) and he said I can make them again! Yay for another success story!!  (89)

Me and my family could not even eat this - either something went terribly wrong, or this recipe is not worth having on the site.  I adjusted the servings to make 4 patties, so maybe I got one or more of the amounts wrong. IDK, but I will not be making this again. : (

I have made these a few times and my family was quite pleased.  Teenagers and all!  I just did realize that I have only used about 1 1/2 pounds of turkey but kept all the other ingredients close to the same. Actually, I probably bumped up the other because who really measures chopped onion?  More garlic and parsley only enhance this recipe. I think the texture is great, I like this better than beef.  Add some avacado to your burger as a garnish and you will really love it!

Excellent recipe!  Unlike a lot of turkey burger recipes, this one was not dry at all!  I've played with the spices, mixing and matching from different reviews.  I think my favorite thus far has been adding the garlic, onion, and then some Montreal Steak Seasoning... YUM!  We've also mixed 1/2 ground turkey breast and 1/2 lean ground beef... also just as good!  This one is a keeper!

These were a huge hit.  I did make a couple changes though.  I used plain bread crumbs and a little cajun seasoning instead of seasoned bread crumbs.  I also left out the onions, because the two other dishes I made with it both had onions.  I don't think I'll ever use them in this recipe, because everyone loved them as they were.  Lastly, I made sliders instead of full size patties.  They were awesome.

Just finished grilling my delicious version of these turkey burgers on the grill. I followed the basic recipe but added a dash of Worchestershire sauce, Seasoning Salt instead of regular salt, more bread crumbs and crumbled feta cheese. I also sprinkled the patties with Cavender's seasoning blend just before and during cooking. Topped off with more feta after grilling - superb!

Great and easy recipe to follow!  I liked the addition of soy sauce and worcestshire sauce that other reviewers suggested to give some tang to the meat.  I used one egg with egg yolk and lots of panko bread crumbs to bring it all together.  I also used dry parsley and it still came out great.  I suggest putting some finely grated ginger in as well to give it that extra special touch.  This has become a staple recipe for the family this summer!

I was a bit nervous to make these as I have never cooked with ground turkey before, but they turned out fabulous! We really enjoyed them and they were a nice healthy alternative to regular beef hamburgers. I liked the flavor and texture of the turkey more than beef! So will definitely be making them again. Thanks.

Although I added some of my own ingredients, I give this 5 stars cuz I am thankful for Trudi for submitting this wonderful recipe and allowing people the chance to tweak it according to their own taste.  I read some reviews and did my own tweaking...added diced red pepper, whole egg, montreal steak seasoning, soy sauce and instead of parsley, I used cilantro.  I really enjoyed it...very juicy.  Remember not to press on the patties when they are cooking cuz. all the juice will seep out!

How yummy this was. My whole family absolutely devoured it with following changes, hence 4 stars!  I did use whole eggs and not just whites, tripled garlic, more onions, few dashes of soy sauce, NO salt and many splashes of Worcesteshire sauce.

My children (who notoriously DON'T eat) actually request these burgers and... wait for it... eat them all and ask for more!!  The first time I made them I only used a lb of turkey (woops) and they came out super seasoned and intensely delicious.  We can't get enough of these!!  I use powdered garlic and onions to fool the afore mentioned picky children and they turn out just fine.  What a treat to find something that Mom, Dad, and three children will all eat and enjoy!

Yes, they're actually delicious.  Even the BF, who likes greasy unhealthy stuff, asked if I would make them again.  I'm knocking it a star because they really stick to the pan so get the cooking spray ready!  I used dried onion and dried parsley because I didn't have fresh.  I also halved the receipe for the two of us, made 8 smaller burgers and had sliders.  Delish and lower in calories!

Love these!   I order turkey burgers in restaurants a lot, but have never tried making my own ... well, not counting a box of frozen ones that were awful!   These were wonderful ... I halved the recipe and used one whole egg, but left everything else the same.  Cooked them on the grill, and they came out great ... moist, stayed together well, and had good flavor ... can't wait to make them again!

These burgers are amazing - even my fiance, who was skeptical of the "turkey" burger LOVED them! One small change - we used saltine crackers rather than breadcrumbs. Delicious!

These were great!  Tasted wonderful.  The only note to anyone making these is that if you grill them, they fall apart and stick to the grill much more easily than regular hamburgers so put them on tinfoil and you'll have better luck!  Thanks for the recipe!

With some changes, these were excellent!  I added some dried cranberries, and used cilantro instead of parsley.  I used two whole eggs, and had to add some extra bread crumbs, and as another reviewer suggested, i coated the burgers with flour.  And we cooked these on the grill rather than on the stove.  We melted good quality blue cheese over the top, dressed the burger with cranberry sauce and caramelized mushrooms & onions.  The blue cheese and cranberry sauce complemented each other perfectly, it was delicious!

These really are AMAZING!!  My husband and kids both like them.  I make them at least every other month with no variation to the recipe at all.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!

In an attempt to eat healthier, I made these for my family tonight. They were delicious! I did what another poster said and put flour on them and it helped hold them together a bit and added some lea and perrins to spice them up. My picky kids didn't even know they were turkey! I will certainly make them again.

I cook with turkey a majority of the time but I must say that these burgers are one of my favorites! Even my husband who is quite the burger lover enjoys these. I've made them several times as written and also added more or less spices depending on my mood, it is a very forgiving recipe.

I made these "Slider style" for my son's birthday and they were a hit! Tender juicy and flavorful. I just threw all of the ingredients into my Mixer and let it do most of the work.  The kids didn't even know they were turkey they were so good.  I added a coupld of tablespoons of olive oil  to add some fat to the turkey and make the burgers extra juicy.

Okay, seriously, turkey burgers?  Yuck, right?  Not so fast...this is Actually Delicious!  I made almost exactly as written, but I used unseasoned bread crumbs, onion POWDER and added a tablespoon of Worchestershire sauce to the 1 pound of turkey (scaled back from the recipes 3 pounds).  My hubby added just a dash of seasoning salt at the grill.  I was annoyed that he was messing with them, but it was awesome!  So juicy, tender and great flavor.  No bun or condiments necessary.  Kids gobbled them up, too!

These were easy to make and my family loved them. Used onion powder instead of chopped onion in order to avoid the crunchy onion inside the burger issue. Other than that, made as per the recipe. Turkey tends to shrink a lot on the barbecue, so be sure to make your patties large diameter. Thanks!

These burgers are great...I think better than beef burgers!  The parsley adds great flavor.  For 1lb or turkey meat,I increase the onion, garlic, and bread crumbs by a bit. 2/3 or 1 egg white (lightly whipped, very important) is fine. I also add Worcestershire sauce (about 2 teaspoons) for more of a beef flavor.   GREAT RECIPE!!  enjoy!

These were good, but I also "enhanced" them for some flavor. I added some beef bouillon and a splash of soy sauce. I also upped the garlic and onion. I served with spinach, feta, tomato and avocado. They were tasty but I wouldn't go as far as to say they would replace regular burgers in my house, especially because they took FOREVER to cook.

this was a great base for a turkey burger...I kick it up a notch by adding some finely chopped mushrooms and I omit the eggs since I find it too runny and doesnt stick together as well as doing it without. I usually add a bit of my favorite sauce to it instead (red chillie sauce or a korean bbq sauce all taste really good in it.) I make these all the time and have even used it to make meatballs and they are a hit every time!!! Dont forget to top your burger with fried onions and mushrooms!

This is a great turkey burger.  The only thing I did differently was put the whole 2 eggs in and it was great.  I didn't want to use the yolks for something else.  This burger almost tasted like beef.

I love this recipe.  When I want a Turkey Burger, this is the recipe I grab.  I have made this recipe many times now.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I do not like raw onions in foods like this, so I sautéed them before adding it to the turkey.  I also added a few splashes of Worcestershire  Sauce.  I added extra bread crumbs until I liked the consistency.  I sprinkled both sides of the patties with more bread crumbs to help keep them from sticking.  I cooked the burgers on a George Forman Grill and they turned out wonderfully moist. Delicious on whole wheat buns.

This was ok. I'd rather have Costco turkey burgers and add a few seasoning. I just didn't see what all the fuss was about, and it wasn't worth the effort.

I've never had turkey burgers before, but these were really good!  I used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg whites .  Instead of the salt and pepper I added some seasoned salt and a little bit of Worcestershire sauce... soooo good!  The only thing I would do differently next time is use onion powder instead of chopped onions.  I normally like them in burgers, but just didn't care for them in this particular recipe.  These burgers go great with "Baked French Fries I" which is also on this site.  Yummy!

These are actually delicious turkey burgers. I had never really used ground turkey before, but I think I will switch it up sometimes. The burgers came out very juicy and quite tasty - I followed the recipe exactly. With the leftover meat I made turkey meatballs to use in a different recipe.

I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised at how tasty and moist these turned out. I used only 1 1/3 lbs. turkey (1 pkg.) for 2 of us, but left the measurements for the seasonings almost the same as listed b/c I was afraid they'd turn out bland.  I did add Worcestershire, per a recommendation and I used 1 whole egg instead of egg white.  The key is to cook them on med. slowly so they don't dry out.  I will make these again!

I usually don't do turkey burgers because they turn out mushy, but these were great! I modified the recipe for 1 lb but kept the bread crumbs at 1/4 cup and they turned out perfect. Also add a dash of the Laury's seasoning. Will make again!!!

This recipe was a total winner with my family.  I didn't have an onion on hand, but it didn't suffer as a result.  I used stuffing bread crumbs, since I had them on hand, and they added flavor.  I'll be making these often, as I can get max pak turkey for less than beef, and it is healthier too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was hesitant at first because I have never liked turkey burgers---but this was delicious.  I used dried parsley in place of fresh and added seasoning salt and some soy sauce.  Had some difficulty patting out burgers, so I just plopped some of the mixture into a pan with oil.  Turned out wonderful--although I feel like I countered the healthiness of using turkey by pan frying it the way I did.  Still tasty!!

My husband said these were out of the park! We scaled back the recipe to serve 5 (since we had a 1.25 pounds of ground turkey). Added liquid smoke, as suggested by other reviewers. Instead of eating on a bun, we served them on a leaf of green lettuce, topped with feta and sliced roma tomatoes.  No other condiments were needed (in fact mustard overpowered the delicious flavor of the burger). This is a keeper!!

These actually ARE delicious!  I've never attempted to serve my family a burger that was white - they all looked at me as if I had two heads but they had a willingness to give it a try... and they were pleased!  This is a delish way to cut fat, calories, and cholesterol.  I used the recipe as written except using a torn up piece of whole wheat bread and a tsp of Italian seasoning in place of the breadcrumbs because I didn't have any.  We really liked it and will definitely make again!

Never made or even had a turkey burger before I tried this recipe.  I used 1 whole egg instead of whites and added a bit more bread crumbs.  Also added a few splashes Worcestershire sauce.  These held up well on my George Foreman grill.  Will make again!

I made this for my family tonight and am going to include this in the weekly line up.  Not only is it healthier than ground beef, it was very tasty.  Normally I really dislike turkey burgers but these were good.  Even the kids and husband liked it and wanted seconds.  I sort of improvised because I only had a pound of ground turkey.  I also used Worcestershire pepper and some soy sauce, like another reviewer suggested.  I was out of parsley so I used tarragon, but I doubt it really made a differenceat all.  Also, because I have high cholesterol, I used egg beaters instead of the egg.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these burgers for the second time tonight and they are still the best turkey burgers.  The first time I had just a quarter of a red bell pepper left over and decided to add it.  I put the bell pepper, onion, parsley and garlic in a little food processor and processed it really fine.  Awesome!  The second time I left out the bell pepper then realized I didn't have garlic so I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  Still really awesome.  Both times I cooked them on the grill and didn't have any problems with them falling apart.  You just have to make sure that they are completely done on one side before you decide to flip them.  Hope this helps.  Happy Cooking! :)

Wow, it stands up to its name!  These really are "actually delicious turkey burgers"!  I hadn't made turkey burgers in years, but was in the mood for burgers and our store had a ground turkey 2 for 1 sale, so I decided I would give it one more try.  Glad I did because these were delicious!!  Half the ingredients and prep of my old recipe, and MUCH tastier!  I did leave out the parsley and onion (didn't have any), and had no egg (which I was a bit worried about), but they still held together great and had flavor.  I broiled mine on a wire rack over a baking sheet to cut down on fat, and they turned out perfect!  Pretty much fool-proof, I'd say.  Thanks for this recipe - its easy and delicious!

We really enjoyed these turkey burgers. Followed the recipe exactly. They were very tasty. My 13 year old son was skeptical about trying them out but ending up eating two and said we needed to eat more turkey vs ham-burgers! wow!

I love these turkey burgers.  I made extra so that I could freeze the patties.  Easy to pull out of the freezer and pop right onto the grill.

These were amazing. My hubby is a red meat freak and he is leary of "turkey" anything. But he ate these up and asked when we could have them again. We added soy sauce and lots of worcestershire and some montreal steak seasoning. We will definitely make these again.

We have been eating turkey burgers at our house for a while...this recipe is a welcome addition!  I really enjoyed these (my husband's only complaint was I didn't chop the onions fine enough) and they stretched a pound of ground turkey enough to feed our whole family!  I did as others suggested: added a whole egg instead of the 2 whites, added worcestershire sauce and a little Lawry's. They grilled up very well and stayed together.  This will be how we make our turkey burgers from now on!

I was not sure what to expect with these, this being my first attempt at Turkey Burgers.  They didn't remind me of a beef burger at all.  HOWEVER, they were excellent! This will become a new regular dinner as I can imagine it will taste great with a variety of sides.  I rated four stars instead of five because I made a few changes based on reading other reviews.  I added the whole egg,  added in some chopped green pepper (because I wanted to use it up, and it gave the burgers a little crunch), I made my own bread crumbs because I don't like the store bought ones (put a cubed up slice of bread in the oven then put it in the blender with spices) and I coated the pattys with flour before cooking.  Very Delicious!!

This recipe has become one of the staples in our home. We love it, the kids love it, and we feel it's a healthy recipe that also has a fabulous taste!  We modify it per the other suggestions: I omit the salt and black pepper, and add 2T of soy sauce, (a generous) 2t of Worcestire sauce, and (a generous) 1t of hickory smoke flavor.  We cook it in a 450 degree oven: 12 minutes on the first side then flip them, then cook it until the internal temperature reaches 165 degress (only another 6 minutes or so).  We've served it a lot for guests, and everyone raves!

Scrumptious! I had ground turkey for dinner and I was getting tired of the same old stuff. Hubby suggested burgers, so off to Allrecipes I went. I had to make a couple of changes due to what was in my pantry. I used Italian Seasoning with the bread crumbs because I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, and I exchanged green onions for white (I hate onions except for green). I melted cheese over the top and oh were they delicious! I can't wait till my hubby comes home to try them!

I was very iffy about trying a turkey version of anything, but they were actually good.  I liked them as much as a regular burger.  Even my 1 year liked them.  I forgot to buy garlic and had to use just garlic powder, but they were still good.

This actually WAS a delicious turkey burger! I pretty much followed the recipes exactly with a few slight changes.

I didn't have fresh parsley, so I just used dried (used a little less than half the amount for the fresh parsley would have been). I also added some fresh baby portabello mushrooms (chopped up). I added a little bit of A1 Steak Sauce to give it a smokey flavor and a dash of soy sauce. (Maybe next time I'll use more of these sauces to add more zest to the dish.) Instead of pan frying it-- I just stuck the burgers in a broiler and watched to see when it was ready. (Topped the burger off with lettuce and ketchup, and served with sweet potato fries.) Yum yum yum! Oh yeah-- for the last minute of broiling, I topped the burgers off with a mixed variety of shredded cheese that I had. I will definitely be making this healthy alternative to a cheeseburger again!

Great with some extras - worcestershire sauce, all of the egg does keep them from crumbling. 

Also sauteed lots of onions and mushrooms and topped burger with the and low-fat mozzerella. 

Very, very good.

These had good taste. Also, I thought the meat mixture was way too wet, making patty formation difficult. That may have been because I used cheap frozen turkey. I would double the bread crumbs and halve the egg whites or use a whole egg with more binding ability. I did these  in a skillet, I'd be afreaid to do them on the grill because I don't think they'd hold together well.

Really really good!  They were even better than I expected them to be.  I did make a few minor changes, though.  I used two whole eggs and a lot more bread crumbs. (maybe 1/2 c.) I also added 1 tsp. seasoning salt, 2 Tbs. Worcestershire sauce, and 1 Tbs. soy sauce.  (I followed another person's recommendations)  My husband and kids raved about them!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a little liquid smoke, worcestershire and soy sauce. Served with melted cheese and all the standard burger fixings along with lettuce, tomato, mayo and pickles.  The whole family loved these.  They cooked supper quick on the grill 4 minutes on each side over medium heat. Super quick, easy, healthy and flavorful meal!

I make these every time I get a craving for a big ol' burger.  These taste best on the BBQ but are great and FAST on the Foreman grill, too.  TRIPLE bonus: this same recipe makes awesome burgers, meatballs, AND meatloaf.  Amazing.

We really liked these burgers.  I think they could use a bit more seasoning (even with a bit of worcestersire, soy and smoke added), so a bit more salt.  A great, healthier change from the norm.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

These were actually quite good!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a little liquid smoke, worcestershire and soy sauce.  I served it on a Ciabatta bun, and topped it with Swiss cheese and Sun-dried tomato pesto.  Excellent!

wow, we really enjoyed these burkey turgers (what my boyfriend calls them). i cut the recipe back to 4 servings & didn't make any other changes aside from substituting a little dried parsley for the fresh variety. our turgers needed to grill about 12 minutes on each side. thanks trudi!

What an awesome recipe.  My husband said "This is quite excellent!"  and he was right on.  (and he is a beef eater)  We will be adding this to our recipe collection.
Thank you so much for the healthy and tasty recipe.

I must admit, I was a little scared to try these. However, a friend said she loves turkey burgers so I thought I would give them a try. These were absolutely delicious! Moist and full of flavor! I grilled these and then just ate it like a beef burger - with ketchup. I will be hard pressed to eat a beef burger again!

Delish!  I made these on the George Foreman grill and not ONE drop of fat came out of that grill!  Amazing!  I felt like such a good mommy feeding my family something so low fat.  I was afraid for a moment when I saw how sticky and wet the mixture was, but they cooked up perfectly.  My 18 and 19 year old sons almost wouldn't try them, but they did and the picky one liked them more than the other one!  I was amazed.  Next time I might add fresh spinach leaves into the patties.  Oh, I also put a bunch more garlic in and didn't have breadcrumbs so I put a piece of bread in the toaster, then grated it with a cheese grater.

Texture is different compared to a beef patty, but mine turned out to be very flavorful.  I added Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce and they were great.

These were very good, even though I forgot to add the onion and I had to substitute dried parsley for the fresh.  We were in the middle of a terrible winter storm, so grilling was not an option, so we just cooked them on the stovetop and they turned out great.  I can't wait for better weather to try them out on the grill.  All 3 children devoured them without hesitation.

I used chives instead of onions and granulated garlic.  I also added seasoning salt and a little worchestershire.  These burgers are great- very juicy! They are delicious topped with a little spicy BBQ sauce- it gives the burger an entirely new flavor.

Loved these! i only used 1.5lbs ground turkey though, added 1/4 chopped mushrooms, seasoning salt, worchestshire,soy suace, cayenne, and used panko bread crubs.

THESE are so juicy!
we made these into mini burgers which we ate with Hawaiian rolls, cheddar, and little chopped onions. yummy superbowl snacks.

this would make an EXCELLENT turkey meatball for spaghettit. thanks for this great recipe and to everyone who made the little mods to better it

I have had these before and they are sooo good. Did the recipe up just as written. I also try not to over cook them so they don't dry out. Going to try and cook them in the oven as I have seven in my family. Thanks for the recipe.

You are right, these are actually delicious.  And most important not dry.  I even used turkey breast so they were lower in fat, but they still turned out juicy.

I added a grated onion, 3cloves of minced garlic, Spice Island Steak Seasoning,Worchestershire sauce,quite a bit of Liquid Smoke (by accident---LOL),green Tabasco sauce(milder than red),& a whole egg. Turned out soooo good! Couldn't tell it was turkey! I froze half the mixture for a later time. Thank you other reviewers!

Added steak sauce and a dash of Red Hot.  Made this on a cast iron grill pan...brush burgers with a bit of olive oil or they will stick!  Great taste.  Skeptical beef eating boyfriend loved them!

Really easy to make.  They were pretty good.  We grilled them on our electric grill.  Might have been better cooked in a pan.

These were fantastic!!  I halved the entire recipe, and added 1 Tbl. Worchestershire sauce.  Be sure and flatten them well, because unlike beef, they don't have a lot of fat that drains off and makes them smaller.  Thanks for the recipe!

Maybe I had to high of expectations after reading the reviews.  To me they we just okay.  My roommate liked them allot.  I throw mine on the grill.  You have to make sure the one side is pretty much done before you try to flip them.  I had one almost fall apart cause it wasn't quit done on the one side and one flip nicely.  Cause it was done.  I would make them again but won't go out of my way.

OK I have never had Turkey Burgers before so I have no referance.  But, these are very good I really liked them. I have some important advice, I tried to grill the burgers on the grill and it was a disaster I just did my best to take them off and finished them in a fry pan.  They fell apart and stuck to the grill.  I suggest you use a clean grill rack and pam spray.  Then you should be alright.  I will make these again they were very good.

Yum!  Okay, so I made quite a few changes (as per other reviewers, and some of my own...).   I cut the recipe to 5 servings, first of all, because I only had 1.3lbs turkey (how it's packaged here). Added a splash of soy and a splash of worcestershire to the mix, as well as a bit of tomato based chili sauce (like catsup, a couple of tablespoons).  This made the mixture a little too wet so I also added a bit of quick oats (about 1/4-1/3 cup).  With the extra stuff, this made 7 decent sized burgers.  Cooked these on the grill - delicious!  I will DEFINITELY make these again - once it's warm enough, they will likely become a weekly staple :)  Would have been equally good without my additions, probably.  Served on whole wheat buns with a little barbeque sauce.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I have made this with both ground turkey and ground chicken and had equally good results either way. These were excellent on the grill and make good leftovers. (reheat in microwave)... You can substitute egg beaters for egg whites with the same results.

Everyone loved this recipe!!!!  I used Olive Oil instead of the egg whites, red onion and added Lawry's Season Salt.  I made a couple on the George Foreman grill and they came out juicy and delicious.  The next batch was made on the outdoor grill.  I melted provolone on some and pepper jack on the others.  I will make this again and share with others.

They are delicious! This is a great alternative to beef burgers. We also added red pepper flakes for a bit of heat.

I scaled this down to 1.25 pounds of turkey. I did this the super quick way and used dried onions and parsely as well as garlic powder. As suggested in other reviews, I added some worchestershire sauce and used seasoning salt instead of regular salt, but I only used 1/3 tsp. I also added a bit of white pepper and used an entire egg instead of just the white. I made two gigantic burgers and broiled them for 13 minutes on each side. Very big, and very tasty.

Delicious, I messed with the recipe a bit an used onion powder instead of fresh cut onions, minced garlic and parsley flakes instead of fresh ingredients and light tasting olive oil in place of egg whites along with garlic salt.  I used the base amount of seasoning requested but added more garlic and black pepper and others till it smelled the way I liked.  Loved It, great recipe!!!!

Simply amazing!  I made two minor changes - used one whole egg instead of two egg whites, and added a couple of dashes of worchestire sauce (adds zing to any burger).  BBQ'd the burgers and topped them with garlic herbed mayo, avocado slices, red onion, lettuce & tomatoes.  I served it with homemade coleslaw and baked spicy potato wedges.  My guests loved it, and so did I!  I will be making this quite often!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are just wonderful!  My sister has made them twice for me & other family members & they are always a huge hit!  So flavorful & moist...she does add worcestshire & reduces the salt, too.  I cannot wait to make some for myself to freeze.  I'll probably use oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs, though, because I prefer it.

My family was extremely skeptical of these at first, but then had to admit that they were extremely good. I added some fresh grated Parmesan cheese, a few splashes of soy sauce and hot sauce, and used 1 Tbsp dried parsley instead of fresh. Excellent on a toasted bun with pepperjack cheese. Oh, and be sure to not use just ground turkey breast; get the ground turkey with dark and white meat.

Wonderful! I had some ground turkey that I didn't know what to do with and found this recipe. We didn't want traditional burgers with buns, so browned the patties in a pan and after that simmered them in a mixture of soy sauce, wistershire sauce & water. They were great! I did add italian seasoning to the mixture. Thanks!

Alright so I didn't use ground turkey, but this seasoning was perfect for ground beef too.  Picky kids might be thrown off by the bits of onion in there but mine still ate 'em up.  I put it all together and let the meat sit for an hour or so before putting them on the grill - yummy!

REALLY good.  Better than beef burgers.  I fudged this a little bit, keeping all the reviews in mind.  I started with the 1-lb package of regular 'ground turkey' (not breast) from Aldi.  Affordable and more moist than white meat alone.  From there, I had to play with amounts because it's only 1/3 of the amount of meat called for.  It made just the right amount for a family of four - we ended up with 5 good size burgers and my husband ate two.  Here's what I did:

Approx. 3 Tbsp. Panko crumbs.  
A few dashes of Worchesteshire. 
A few dashes of Soy Sauce.  
1 Jumbo Egg white.  
about 2 heaping Tbsp. Shredded Onions (used medium cheese grater, less than 1/4 of an onion).  
1 medium clove garlic, minced.  
A few dashes of our favorite Rib Rub seasoning.  
A slightly heaping 1/4 tsp. of Kosher Salt.  

 Fried on med-low on skillet then transferred to 350 degree oven to finish while I prepped burger fixings.  

The result was an amazing, delicate, light, flavorful, moist burger!  This will go down in our recipe book for repeated uses.

I prepared these to go over rice for a Japanese style curry rice dinner. 

Adjustments to original recipe:

4lbs ground turkey (16 1/4lb patties)
Panko bread crumbs subbed for seasoned bread crumbs
Whole eggs subbed for egg whites
2 cloves garlic
1 1/2 tsp curry seasoning

This is my go to recipe for burgers and meatballs.  I am very picky about my burgers and haven't found any that taste better than these (even in restaurants).  I do add a packet of sodium free beef seasoning (Herbox) for about 1/3 of the recipe.  If making meatballs, I may add some Parmesan cheese.   I haven't found a better recipe than this one!i. I like these better grilled.

These were super good.  I didn't want to make 12 patties, so I used 2 lbs of turkey and adjusted the ingredients to approximates.  In place of the egg white, I used 1 whole egg.  Per some other reviews, I also added some soy, liquid smoke and worcestershire.  I will make these again and again.  

I'm not sure why the recipe calls for cooking to an IT of 185.  Poultry is safe at 165.  Even the ground turkey wrapper says to cook to 165.

Thanks for the great recipe. For a family of 4 I downsize this recipe:  I use 1 pound of ground turkey, 1 egg, 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, 1 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp of liquid smoke,  and 1 clove garlic. I cook them on my griddle.

I made half the recipe for dinner tonight not really expecting much, tbh.  Ground turkey is kinda meh to me.  Boy was I wrong!  I subbed garlic powder and onion powder, left out the milk, and added a cup of chopped baby Bella mushrooms for moisture.  They were surprisingly flavorful and paired well with peas and mashed potatoes.

I made this recipe and used AUSSIEMUM1’s admendments: 1 red pepper, Worcesteshire, double garlic, double panko breadcrumbs,two whole eggs instead of just whites, and lightly floured prior to cooking. We really enjoyed the patties, and the stayed together and cooked up moist. They held together so well that I even maid turkeyballs. The only thing I plan on doing different next time is to add some red pepper flakes.

Love this and with two minor changes these are our game night burgers (Turris Turkey Burgers) as burgers happen to be a thing for the Ottawa Senators so I only shredded the onion as my son claims to hate onions and I use dried herbs instead of fresh - amazing recipe thank you ~ cheers

I have used this recipe as is and then tweeted it a bit to my personal taste. I add a teaspoon or more of olive oil, a teaspoon of garlic powder and crumbled blue cheese or feta depending on what I am in the mood for. Sometimes a half cup of minced baby spinach as well. Yum!

I loved it, I used a mix of turkey and ground chicken.    I will remember to make sure the  buns are big enough as they shrink very little .  Excellent.  Perfect to add extra seasoning to suit your tastes.

I've made this several times. with no changes.  Absolutely delicious. I always do on the grill and have no problem with them "melting" as another.  Its not a beef burger and doesn't try to be, but still delicious in its own right.

These were great with a few additions from readers.  Added the chopped red pepper and Worcestershire and coated in flour to frym used the whole egg, not just the whites. Family loved them.  Definitely far above your normal bland turkey burger!

Very good.  When I made them a second time I used dried parsley and added a sprinkle of olive oil and worchester.  Waited to salt them until after cooked just before throwing on some pepper jack cheese.  Yum!
Also good with havarti, bbq, whole wheat bun, and avocado

For a healthier option I used rolled oats instead of breadcrumbs and seasoned with Italian spice. Also baked the patties. Added Worcestershire sauce and bit more garlic as suggested by others for more flavor. These turkey burgers were so delicious. Will be making again for sure.

I made this recipe for Memorial Day cookout for my family as no one wanted beef. They were flavorful and moist. I did add Worcestershire as recommended by other reviewers. It's a keeper recipe for sure!

This recipe is fine as is but I do prefer adding these modifications (many were also suggested by AUSSIEMUM1): 

crunched up seasoned croutons in place of breadcrumbs
2-4 shakes of Worcestershire (A-1 steaksauce also works)
a bit more garlic
1-2 Tbsp fresh chopped parsley
some of the egg yolk

These burgers are amazing! Very juicy and flavorful. After reading a few reviews I decided to add a little red pepper and a little more seasoning. Lightly basted each burger with some liquid smoke and cooked them on the stove top. I will make these again and again for sure. This is a keeper!

I made these double the thickness in a cast iron pan, for a more 'tavern' style burger. I highly recommend this to get a beautiful char on the outside. Then turn the heat down lower to get the inside cooked through, since we're talking turkey not beef, you don't want medium rare turkey. The parsley adds great fresh flavor and the egg white keeps them fluffier than using whole eggs. Also a tip for any recipe calling for a meat mixture, mix everything except the meat first, and then mix it into the meat. It mixes in a lot more evenly and easily that way.

Awesome! These turned out juicy, moist and full of flavor. Instead of mincing the garlic, parsley and onion, I pulsed it to a paste/puree form in my magic bullet blender instead. This helped to breakdown each ingredient without messy chopping and allowed the meat to really absorb the flavor. I did add extra bread crumbs to offset the added moisture so we could grill them rather than cook them on the stovetop. They did not fall apart on the grill at all and were cooked for 4 minutes on each side over medium/high heat. 

Here were the changes/additions I made for 16 OZ OF TURKEY BURGERS ON THE GRILL:
Above ingredients plus
1 packet or 1 teaspoon of soy sauce
1 teaspoon of worchestershire sauce
1 whole egg
Puree the onion, parsley and garlic together before adding to the meat
1/4 cup Italian breadcrumbs
Combine all ingredients well, divide meat into 4 parts, roll into 4 patties, indent the center slightly, cover and put back in fridge for up to 3 hours before grilling.

I have made Turkey Burgers for years.  As I am a dump method person, I don't have an exact measure, but enjoy making them different every time.  The consistency should be a burger that you can put together into patties with your hands.  I use the whole egg and Italian bread crumbs to start and then add spices - such as Mrs. Dash's assortment but the Garlic one in particular.  I sometimes add extra basil or Italian seasonings.  I also will add either Parmesan cheese or some type of shredded cheese and stir that all together and then form them into patties.  I have found if I wet my hands together before forming the patties that they form up better. My family loves these and request them often.  I do them either inside or on the grill.  If they fall through the grates, then the mixture is too wet and you need to add more bread crumbs.  I use a turkey package from Aldi's - which is over a pound, so I usually use 1-2 eggs (and sometimes 1 whole egg and 1 egg white).  These are often requested at our family reunion get togethers. These can be made into gluten free burgers by using gluten free bread ground up and have fun experimenting with flavors.

This is our go-to turkey burger recipe. The flavor is amazing and on the stove top, they are so easy to make. I opt out the bread crumbs since I'm yeast free but I add Italian seasoning and use the whole egg. I typically make these with parmesan roasted potatoes. Yum! We've made them on the grill before with tin foil and when they are pretty firm, add the directly on the grill for the marks.

I have made these 4-5 times in the last 2 months and my entire family loves them.  I use 1/4 cup of dried onion,  1 1/2 Tbsp of Garlic Powder, 2 whole eggs and  2 Tbsp of dried parsley.  Served on grilled Brioche Rolls with Cranberry sauce between burger and bottom roll.  FABULOUS!!

Incredible. I took aussiemum's idea just because my wife and I love red peppers and worcesteshire sauce. We make burgers but we also use it for meatballs. And breakfast sandwiches. And ground up to make fajitas. And on and on.

Good turkey burger. Just beware of what toppings you put on it. I LOVE mustard and pickles, but they weren't good on this burger. Most everything else should be good, just use your judgement.

The best turkey burgers ever, tweaked to my taste, instead of salt used season salt, ground garlic powder, ground onion powder, couple dashes of Worcestershire and Liquid Smoke, slice of honey wheat bread crust removed instead of the crumbs...I know purists . Delish my picky son and husband like them. Forman Grill 7min the come out perfect.

The only change I made to this recipe was instead of using parsley I used cilantro.  Delicious!  I grilled on foil and after both sides were cooked enough where they would not fall apart I removed the foil to get s slight grill flavor.

My husband and I are trying to eat healthier and thought we'd try this recipe. He doesn't really like turkey but, since they're low cal, I thought we'd try it. WOW! These are excellent! They are honestly, actually, and fabulously delicious.

These burgers have replaced beef burgers at my house. I actually enjoy them more than beef and my husband also loves them.

Juicy, cooked to 160 degrees F.; I stuck an instant read thermometer in from the side of a burger. I just realized that I altered the recipe by using a whole egg to only 1 1/2 lbs. of turkey, and totally omitted the salt, garlic and crumbs. Sorry...hurried dinner tonight, but it was perfect that way for adults and children here. That made eight burgers for us, with hubby eating two. My 12-month old granddaughter gobbled down half a burger that her mom cut up for her...tender enough for only 4 little teeth. It seemed to have more color to it than the photos with the egg white only.

Like it says. Simple & delicious! It gets a five b/c you can add ingredients and it just gets better or keep it as is. I've added ketchup, worcester, & A1 sauce for BBQ and people loved them. Next time I'll place allum foil on grill b/c they cook fast and stick to grill otherwise. For me, baking on a pan yielded best results. No dryness b/c I used less breadcrumbs. I use two circular soup lids two shape my burgers to perfect consistency (wife's idea). I place freezer paper between two patties & freeze. They thaw out in 20 minutes when removed! Bravo to it's creator & thanks for sharing recipe!

Amazing! Even my teenage daughter liked them and she's very picky. This is definitely going in the rotation at my house and I'm going to try freezing some next time. I did make a few changes: basil instead of parsley because that's what I had, doubled the breadcrumbs (I used Panko), and I used the whole egg. Next time I'm trying a dash a worcestershire. My daughter put Montreal steak seasoning on hers and loved it. I LOVE to find healthy alternatives to our favorite foods!!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Because we're trying to cut out red meat in our diet, I tried this recipe. My adult children and their spouses and boyfriend were over and when I took the burgers out of the frig to put them on the grill my daughter made a face when I told her they were turkey burgers. She asked if I made real burgers. I told everyone the reviews were good and one woman's husband swore off beef burgers when tasting them. With all the food I made including my ribs, the turkey burgers were the hit! Some even chose to get seconds on burgers and "save" the rest of their food. YOU'VE GOT TO TRY THEM. They'll be YOUR new favorite. They are moist and flavorful with so few ingredients.

Excellent! Great flavor! Added worcestshire as suggested by others. Cut the recipe by 1/3 since I had slightly over a pound of ground turkey. used 1 small clove garlic, 1/4 cup onion, 2T panko breadcrumbs, 2 T parsley and 2T allwhites. Did them on the grill with the fish insert  so they would not fall thru. Big hit! Will make again.

These burgers were great - they passed the picky kid test with flying flavors!  Great as a burger in solitude, or even better accompanied with sautéed baby Bella mushrooms, crisp red onions, fresh spinach, and Roma tomatoes.

Hate the name... Love the burger! Three teenagers ate these burgers as if it were that last meal ever. I did however add bacon on top to those who wanted it.  It made them all that much better. Fabulous.

We all enjoyed this recipe, hubby and (picky) kids included. I used asiago flavored croutons (pulsed in a food processor) for the bread crumbs to add extra flavor. They turned out moist and delicious.

This was our first turkey burger and we had a difficult time not expecting beef as we ate it.  It's not bad really, just different.  I won't make it again.  I did use onion powder and garlic powder, but forgot to add worcestershire and such that reviewers suggested.

My kids really like these!  I skip the fresh parsley (cost reduction) and add a splash of worcestershire and seasoned salt replacing salt.  I also used a regular egg and pan fry them.  Kids loved them and my picky son ate 2!

I made this recipe tonight as is except  1) I didn't have any fresh parsley (will add next time) and 2) I cut the recipe in half using 1 1/2 lbs. ground turkey...It was delicious!  Also, I cooked the six patties on my George Foreman for about 7 mins.- perfect! Easily the best turkey burger recipe I have tried and it was easy to prepare! Thanks, Trudi!

This was a really good burger! I like a little heat so I just added a few slivers of a fresh jalapeno and topped with avocado, tomato and onion. Delicious and will become a staple. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Added a bit of Extra virgin olive oil and they were the best! I've also used beef instead of turkey and still added the olive oil and they came out even better! This is a wonderful base recipe to add things too like a cheese (like feta - drop half the salt though) or if you want something spicy, a bit of crushed red pepper or finely chop any kind of spicy pepper (depending on how spicy you like - but still add the pepper because salt and pepper are the yin&yang of spices)

Delicious, and so fast and easy!  I did make a few changes - added some Worcestershire, additional Italian seasoned bread crumbs, tripled the garlic, and used whole eggs.  I was out of fresh parsley and onion so I used dried, and after mixing let it sit 15 minutes so the onion would absorb some moisture.  I pan fried them and added a slice of cheese on top during the last minute or so of cooking. They were moist and very flavorful.  My husband commented on how delicious they were and asked to have them again the next night.  They will now be a regular on my list of dinner recipes!  Thanks Trudi!

I finally made this today and they definitely are delicious. However I thought they needed just a little tweaking. I made up 1/2 of the meat , 1 egg white and 1/2 t of salt but all the other ingredients I left alone. I also added 4 glugs of worchesershire and a glug of soy sauce. These were very juicy and wonderful and thank you for this receipe. Will be making again.

I just made these..and they are amaazing! I added 10+ dashes of Worcestershire sauce, a good squirt of Siracha, 3 cloves of grated garlic, and I left one egg yolk and one eggwhite. I substituted cilantro for parsley because I just like the flavor better. These are delicious!

I had a pound of ground chicken that needed to be used and I thought it turned out great. It was a bit tricky trying to scale down the ingredients. The only thing I'll do differently next time is halve that garlic.

I made these as directed but with whole wheat fresh bread crumbs. THEN, I put them into a warm whole wheat pita with fresh sliced tomatoes and Tzatziki sauce. Oh.My.Gosh! This was one of our best suppers ever! Definitely to-do again. Thanks for the recipe. I can't wait to try a meatloaf next!

I had recently grilled turkey burgers that I bought fresh from the store already formed into patties.  I am trying to get my husband to eat some healthier foods - he just could not even finish that turkey burger, hated it.  I found this recipe and thought I would try again, told him there was lots of good stuff it in.  We put them on wheat buns with some romaine and a little bit of light mayo and we both thought they were delicious.  I am stoked now to have this recipe, I will read through the reviews to see if anyone had good luck with any changes or additions, but I fixed exactly per recipe and grilled them on gas grill and thought it was delicious.

WOW!These burgers were fantastic! My husband and extremely picky 7 year old loved them. Followed directions as listed, but did add the montreal steak seasoning (as another reviewer suggested) when we put them on the grill. ALSO, my husband did cook these on the BBQ, however, he did cook them on a layer of tin foil and they held up perfectly. Will definitely be cooking these up again..and again...

I just love these turkey burgers! I added a little more breadcrumbs than stated because I found the mix was still too wet. A few tricks I could offer are; if you find your turkey mix is too mushy, once mixed, try putting it in the freezer for about half an hour to an hour to firm it up a little. Also, if you want to grill these but are afraid they won't hold up on the BBQ, try popping them on the frying pan for a couple minutes each side, they will bond together and be all set for the BBQ! Even my 4 year old son ate this up in no time flat and was pleased to have leftovers for lunch the next day!

These were fantastic!  I've had such a hard time finding a turkey burger that doesn't end up dry and tasteless.  This one hit the mark, we didn't even add cheese or condiments. Excellent burger!!!

These are very tasty. I did pan fry them in a tiny bit of olive oil because they felt too soft to put on the grill, even after refrigerating the patties for a few hours. Will make again!

OMG I will never use another recipe for turkey burgers again!  I am such a food snob and my daughter doesn't fall far from the tree and we are both in love with this recipe.  We added fresh mozzarella to the top along with a little mayo and stuffed it all inside a roll we had just bought at the Italian market.  OH MY GOODNESS was this heaven.  Thank you SO much for this recipe!!!!
Oh, I do have to say that we didn't have any "seasoned bread crumbs" so I just used plain with maybe a tsp of Italian seasoning.  Also I used dried parsley and it was still incredible.  Ugh, thanks again!

The best turkey burgers I've tried!  I cooked them in a George Foreman grill, they kept their shape and were perfect.  Very tasty!  There is no fat in the turkey so make them bun size, they will not shrink.  I made 4 patties and froze 2.  Later I cooked the frozen patties and they were just as good as the fresh and very convenient to just pull out of the freezer and grill.

Delicious! I used whole eggs. 5 stars only because I needed more flavour, but with some added spices these were great and held up well to the BBQ. I'll definitely make these again.

Wow, these were so good. I have tried quite a few turkey burgers and due to using 93% lean or higher white meat turkey, they are typically on the dry side. I only had 1 lb of ground turkey, so I made 1/3 of a recipe. I was able to get 5 good sized burgers using a mashed potato scoop to portion them. I cooked them on the stove top as suggested. put the burner on about 7 and greased the pan with around 1 Tblsp of canola oil. I liked that they all fit. Only other change I made was mixing up my own store bought type seasoned bread crumbs to taste with basil, Italian seasoning, garlic salt and powder, onion powder, salt and pepper. I always do this as the flavor to me is just better. I served them on toasted GF whole grain buns. I will definitely make these again.

Finally a turkey burger recipe my whole family liked!  I followed the recipe except I added a few more bread crumbs and an egg yolk to help keep it together.  One thing that made it successful for me was that I used a food processor to blend the parsley, onion and garlic.  This kept my son from noticing that there were actual onions in it.

I used garlic powder instead of clove garlic, and minced onion instead of chopped. It's sooo good. :) It's wonderful to find something healthy and delicious. Will make again and again! Even my hubby who is a beef fan loved it.

I just made this today to serve at a buffet and everyone loved it! I personally didn't try any due to the fact that I am a vegitarian, but it was really easy to make, super filling to those who ate it and a really healthy alternative to other meats. We couldn't get our hands on parsley in time to add it, but we used some poultry seasoning and it was just as good. Great recipe, simple to make and really good!

I followed advice from others and added a splash of Worchestershire sauce. I nearly forgot to add the garlic (a sin at our house), so I added garlic powder. I topped each burger with a slice of swiss cheese and a slice of american cheese. My husband was extreemly surprised to find he really liked them because his initial thought was that these were "sissy burgers". I will make these again, possibly wrapping each patty with bacon as well!

We made these last night, and I was a bit skeptical at first, having tried "turkey burgers" before and actually throwing them out.  This time, we totally LOVED them.  I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed up vegetable crackers, which I think added a bit to the taste, and I followed the recommendations AussieMum1 shared and they were GREAT.  :)  Will definitely make again - hubby loved them too!

Fantastic - my boyfriends always said he didn't really like turkey - now he's totally converted, he won't eat any other burger (beef included!).

I just tried this recipe & tested it on my son, who is picky about burgers. I modified it slightly, sauteing the onion & garlic before adding it to the mix.  Also, I topped it off with a slice of Provolone. He loved it.  Once, I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs, so used unseasoned & mixed in a touch of Bell's Seasoning. It was tasty!!

I had better chefs than myself cook up turkey burgers I liked less than this one. Its a very quick and easy recipe, so much so that I can almost entirely place my boyfriend in charge of this one. I used 2.25lb of turkey instead of 3, but kept all the ingredients the same, I feel this allows it to be more flavorful while producing a few less patties. I think the turkey tastes great and makes for a much healthier option. I like to prepare this meal with non-traditional burger sides such as coconut rice in order to give the meal a different, more healthy feel. I've seen a few reviews mention issues with the patties sticking together, I had no issues whatsoever with this, perhaps because I used less meat, but I couldn't say for sure.

These are great!  Add a dash of cayenne, worcestershire, and a half teaspoon of pimenton (smoked paprika) to really throw it over the top!  I agree with using the fresh breadcrumbs too.

Once you add bread crumbs and eggs to ANY ground meat it then becomes a MEATLOAF. Why would you add bread crumbs and then put it on bread! yuck!

Loved it! My father and children loved it! I used all of the suggested modifications. I added liquid smoke, soy sauce packet, splash of worcestershire, and used flour to create the crust. I served them with Gouda cheese, sautéed mushrooms and on top of a piece of Texas toast. We had baked French fries and steamed artichokes (used the allrecipe for this) too. Wonderful dinner!!!!

Very good!  I added oregano instead of parsley (since that was what I had).  I wish I had gone with the advise of previous reviewers and shredded my onions - I think that would have helped.  Very juicy!  I added the whole egg, and it came out great!

I cut the recipe down for fewer portions and it called for 5/8 of an egg white.  I just dumped a whole egg in without separating.  The patties were a little mushy but firmed up nicely when cooked.  Unlike other turkey burgers I have made, these stayed nice and moist.  I made sliders with this.  Also added about a tsp of liquid smoke.  Nice flavor.

They were delicious! I made 6 burgers. I used all the same ingredients. I gave it four stars because I used 3 table spoons of italian bread crumbs, 3T of onions, one whole egg, 2 garlic cloves and 3T of chopped parsley. I grilled them 3 min on each side. I served them with pinto beans, cilantro green onions and jalapenos and sliced pan cooked potatoes. Thank you!!

These were great.  They had nice flavor, but not too overpowering and were not dry at all.  I used onion powder in place of onion.  I grilled these instead of cooking in a skillet, which I would definitely do again, weather permitting.  I had scaled down this recipe for 1 lb of meat, but next time will probably make the full amount and freeze the extra.  We ate these with cheese, lettuce,and ketchup.

Super easy and SO delicious!! I did add a tad bit more garlic and onion, only as a personal preference. I froze half of the uncooked patties and saved them to cook later and they were just as delicious a week later.

I love these! So easy to make and turned out great, I took the advice of another reviewer and added a little flour to hold them together, I put in the parsley, garlic,salt and pepper and it gave the perfect amount of seasoning. I will definitely be making these again!

These were a hit with the whole family, including my pickiest eater: a child with sensory processing disorder and Autism. I love this recipe because it was simple, quick, flavorful, versatile, and lactose-free. As another reviewer suggested I used freshly made breadcrumbs and didn't notice any moisture problems at all.  In fact the burgers were overflowing with juices.  Thank you for a fabulous recipe that my husband AND all 3 of my daughters have requested to keep in our regular rotation.

These were very bland, even with the addition of soy sauce, a little adobo seasoning, and topping burgers with pepperjack cheese.  I would highly recommend the spicy chipotle turkey burgers on this site instead.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I only had 1 lb of turkey and so scaled it back a little.  However, I used the 2 eggs, about 1/2 cup bread crumbs and about 1/2 of a package of Lipton's dry onion soup mix.  The burgers turned out pretty good.  Instead of making them into patties, (the mixture was quite gloppy), I spooned globs into a little olive oil in a fry-pan and flattened and rounded them out to burger shapes.  That worked well.  Will probably make them again, as it's a good way to use ground turkey, which we like to have every now and then.

This is a really good turkey burger recipe just the way it is.  When the internal temp gets to 170 I take it off, add cheese and cover with foil to rest.  Amazing.  I did add more garlic, some fresh basil, and red pepper flakes for some heat.  Definitely recommend this recipe.

Pretty yummy! I did add a little bit more spice and onion plus I added jalapenos, Worcestershire, and a little soy sauce..  Next time I'm going to even use more onion, garlic, and jalapenos.  Yummy base recipe to do with what you'd like.

Rather than using eggs as a binder, I prefer using salsa sauce. Not only is it a great binder but it is also packed with flavour. For one pound I use about 2 tablespoons. (If the meat was previously frozen, it may take slightly less).  The trick is to balance the moisture and the bread crumbs.  If you can form the burgers without falling apart then they  will be fine for grilling.

Very good!  I added Worcestershire as others reviewers suggested.  The only problem I had was that they didn't hold together very well.  I even added extra bread crumbs as others suggested, but it didn't really work for me.  Otherwise, they were delicious!

I didn't expect too much from a "healthy" recipe, but all the great reviews convinced me to try these. I grilled the turkey burgers and regular beef burgers for the rest of the family side by side, and served with all the normal burger fixings.  My husband and son actually liked the turkey burger better!  I added soy sauce and worchestershire to the mix as others recommended. I will definately be making these often!  Thanks for the recipe!

Super tasty.  If you are using the recipe>>>shopping list feature, be sure to add buns, tomatoes, and lettuce to the list because for some reason the recipe is just for the patties...

I really like these.. I added some diced apple for juice, soy sauce and worchester sauce plus some spinach and foreman grilled them. My Husband thought they were okay too.I  he thought the spinach might of been overboard but I enjoyed it.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  A flavorful turkey burger that can be tasty on it's own, or jazzed up with different condiments and sauces.

I halved the recipe and used seasoning salt instead of regular salt plus the addition of worcester sauce.  Topped burger with ketchup, mustard, avocado, onions and lettuce.  Delicious!  The boyfriend inhaled it.  Will definitely be making these again!

Great flavor.  Didn't have parsley, but that would have been amazing.  I also added chopped onion and carrot I had leftover from another recipe.  It was great!

This is the best Turkey Burger recipe that I have "EVER" had.  My family loves Turkey Burgers and I thought I would change it up a little and try this recipe...LOVE IT!!!!  The only thing I did differently is I added 1 Tbs of Worcestershire sauce to it.  That made it taste just like a ground beef burger.  Thanks!!!

I really liked these! As suggested, I added worcestshire sauce and some extra season salt. Also, I used slightly less than one real egg beaten (I only used 1 lb of ground turkey). Used dried parsley instead of fresh and added italian seasoning since my bread crumbs were plain. I cooked mine in a grill pan on the stovetop. The burgers were super juicy and moist and had great flavor. My 3yr old and I both ate them with nothing at all! I can tell it would be good as a meatloaf too. Planning to freeze some and hoping they turn out well.

My fiancé and I decided that turkey burgers are just not for us.  The recipe, however, made it much more palatable.

I made fresh bread crumbs and seasoned them with dry herbs and spices.  We used all of the egg instead of only the whites.  I substituted garlic salt in place of regular salt and a dash of seasoning salt.

Overall, the flavors were good.. For being a turkey burger.

Love these burgers! I used dried parsley so didn't quite use 1/4 cup also added some dried basil, worcestershire sauce and cayen for a little kick. Also added an extra egg white to ensure it all stays together. We topped the burgers with guacamole, the result was so good my husband is practically ready to swear off beef!!!

Excellent recipe...Mom, Dad, and 7 year old daughter loved it...I seared them in the pan for 2-3 minutes per side, cut them in half(still raw in the middle) and added 1/4 cup of HOT water and covered, 2 minutes. The water reduces to nothing and frees the browned turkey, making a nice sauce.

Made this for my family using fresh basil instead of parsley from the garden.   My boys that don't like anything with "little green things in them," loved them!  Making them again with basil and will grill them instead of stove top....

I must have done something wrong or gotten the "wrong kind" of ground turkey. I included all of these ingredients, with the exception of bread crumbs, to my patties. I also added some soy sauce for extra flavor. Believe me when I say that I really enjoy turkey and I'm always looking for healthier options; still, the burgers were completely unremarkable and not particularly good. They were a little dry and not terribly flavorful despite all the spices. Filling, but not at all satisfying. I don't know what went so wrong here! I don't think the bread crumbs could have helped these.

These were fabulous! Topped mine with some avocado, hot sauce, lettuce and a bit of (light!) mayo... yummy! They were not dry or bland (as some turkey burgers can get) AT ALL!!!
This recipe also makes quite a bit. I ended up with 15 patties, and since there were just 3 of us, I froze the rest. So convenient for impromptu summer cookouts!

The name says it all...these are actually delicious!  My first time making turkey burgers and my sister's first time eating one and we devoured them, kids included.  I added steak seasoning, soy and worcestershire per some other reviews.  Omitted parsley as I didn't have any.  Will definitely make again!

This is the first time I have made a homemade burger so I was really scared.... It turned out absolutley fantastic! I did mince one jalapeno pepper (I made 4 servings- 1LB turkey burger). Topped it off with turkey bacon, avacado, cucumbers, pepper jack, onion (not sauteed) and lettuce.

My boyfriend is a hardcore red meat only kind of guy and he loved these! The ingredients are simple and the burgers tasted great.

This recipe was awesome. Went ahead and added some of the first enhancements from the first review..which def. helped

Add a little garlic pepper. Throw some cheese on it when it's cooling down on the grill. Awesome.

Made these many times and loved them. But it took my husband making them for my husband and teenage son to say they were "awesome". They didn't even remember me making them before.  No matter they are really darn good. Wouldn't change a thing.

My son Ryan, made these burgers for us and they were the best Turkey Burgers I ever had.  Mine usually turn out dry, these were moist with plenty of flavor.

I have never used ground turkey for anything. My wife and kids are not overly found of turkey either, but thought I'd try this out. I pretty much followed the recipe except using italian breadcrumbs and a dash worchestershire. My kids had seconds (and thirds for my son), and both me and my wife loved them. I'm definately switching to turkey burgers from now on.

I used the whole egg and it worked fine. I served it on a whole wheat bun with melted mozza cheese and tomatoes - it was a hit.

Absolutely delicious! One of the tastiest turkey burgers I've ever had. The only changes I made were: used green onions, made bigger/fewer patties, and cooked them on the grill rather than in the pan. Even my kids loved these so we'll definitely be having them again!

I tried this recipe for the first time and was very pleased! I made some adjustments as suggested by others...I added some mayo and a bit of soy sauce. Tried them out on the neighbors and got requests to make them again!

Alex and I kind of liked these.  Jenny (who doesn't care for turkey burgers), ate hers but that's about it.  Jack was in PA so didn't sample.  Probably wouldn't make again but if I did for some reason, I'd add more salt and cook on the grill for a shorter period.

Absolutely Loved It.  Even Chloe's Grandpa ate it and Grandma gave her two thumbs up.  Wouldn't change the recipe and it wasn't that hard to do.  Cook them and then sit back and enjoy them.  Good job, Trudi!

I was so pleased with this.  I also added some liquid smoke, Worchestershire, and soy like other reviewers.  And a tip is to add a bit of milk to your breadcrumbs before adding them (same with meatballs).  Adds great density and moisture.  Thanks!

I just made these for dinner and one word... YUMMY!  I have always been afraid of turkey burgers, but I will take these over beef burgers anytime.  As the title states... these are actually delicious.  These will definitely make it into the regular rotation.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I add finely chopped green onions instead of regular chopped onions, less parsley and more garlic... It was a hit! Also they taste 100x better on a grill vs in a skillet :)

I did everything as instructed, and it was a little dry. I might have cooked it too long (I made it on the George Foreman)... but I'll probably make it again with more spices and more egg and see how that goes :)

Really delicious turkey burgers! I ended up adding about 2 more tablespoons of the bread crumbs to help shape the burgers. I pan fried with a little olive oil, and they turned out perfect!

These are really good and nothing to them. I never use bread crumbs in my meat mixtures...instead I use Ritz crackers (whole wheat). If you want to spice them up you can add red pepper flakes. These are so good and easy. Yum!

Best Burger ever..I grated the onion and the garlic froze the burgers. BBQ'd 16minutes turning once. Very moist and delicious, not to mention how very easy.  Thanks for a great recipe Trudi

This was absolutely the best Turkey burger I have ever had.   I made them for my family and they LOVED them also.  Used the recipe exact with only one addition.  I had a little Worchester sauce.  I will be added this to my family cook book.

Excellent. I used AUSSIEMUM1's variation with red pepper, Worcheschershire sauce, soy sauce, seasoning salt and egg yolk. Very tasty. I could take or leave the red pepper, but my husband loved the red pepper.

Made tonight with no altercation to the recipe and hands down the family indicated that this could potentially replace the traditional beef burger.  This is so moist and flavorful it a no brainer...

Pretty tasty burgers!  The only things I changed was dry parsley instead of fresh, and I added extra garlic.  My mom, who never finishes any kind of hamburger, devoured the whole thing.  I was tempted to add W-sauce or soy sauce as some others recommened, but I didn't.  Too many people in our family watching our salt intake.  Maybe next time I'll add just a splash to see if it's worth the sodium.

I made these for my boyfriend and me, since I don't eat beef. He's a big meat-eater and was quite skeptical. They were fantastic and I love it when I'm right!

Good, but basic and in need of more bread crumbs than it calls for.  Nothing spectacular, but still tasty.

Love this burger!  It has such amazing flavor and really holds in the juices, making it a tender burger.  I had my doubts, with how simple the recipe was, but it turned out sooo good!  It will be my go-to recipe for turkey burgers...and maybe even for normal burgers.  We don't even miss the beef, with this burger now.  We halved the recipe and it turned out great.

They actually were delicious!  My husband (who was VERY skeptical) thought they were great as well.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt and added a few shakes of White Worcestershire Sauce.  Topped with lettuce, tomato, onion and bacon.  YUM!  My 17 month old loved hers, too!

These were actually delicious! I used only 1 pound of meat, and 1 whole egg. I eyeballed the bread crumbs and onion (I used red onion bc that's what I had). We cooked them on the grill and served with lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I think we will make these for our next cookout with guests. Thanks!

Amazing turkey burgers!  I took the advice of others before us and added the whole egg, a few shakes of Worcester Sauce, and a little bit of paprika.  Because I didn't have any seasoned bread crumbs, I added plain bread crumbs and then added oregano and thyme.  Definitely will make again.

I cut this down to four servings and because I'm cutting back on unnecessary carbs and bread, I used grated parmesan cheese instead of bread crumbs and I needed a little more because my ground turkey was a little wetter, I guess. I kept the parsley but added a half batch of Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning (minus most of the salt) for extra flavor. This went over pretty well, not bad for three boys who balked at eating turkey burgers. I made actual burgers for the boys but I had my burger as is, with a side of my Fully Loaded Cauliflower Salad and Balsamic Mushrooms. NOM. I'll make this again for sure. EDITED: I forgot that I added 1/4 tsp. of Liquid Smoke, too at the last minute.

Not sure why I haven't reviewed this recipe til now. I've made these burgers no less than 8 times since I found this recipe. It's really a go-to recipe for me. The texture and flavor of the burgers is very good. Be sure not to use a crazy ultra-lean ground turkey. I like that there is just enough flavor in these -- not trying to be anything other than a burger. Sometimes I up the garlic, but that's about it. Highly recommend. Definitely make a full batch. The three pounds of turkey typically makes only 8-9 burgers for me instead of the 12 in the recipe. These freeze beautifully as well. Make extra.

This burger definitely lives up to its name.  I didn't have a problem with dryness as some people have had, and I made two separate batches.  I used egg beater instead of egg whites, and cilantro instead of parsley because I had it on hand.  They turned out great!

I have made turkey burgers before, but they always tasted dry and bland.  These were DELICIOUS!!!  My changes included:  1)  couple of swirts of BBQ sauce, 2)  lots of cumin, 3)  extra onion, 4)  sprinkled paprika on top while cooking.  They came out really really good, with lots of leftovers to freeze.  Thanks!!

These are amazing tasting burgers!  When I first bought ground turkey I made hamburgers straight out of the package.  They were gross.  So I went on the hunt for some flavor and found it here.  Taste great as meatballs too.

Just made these tonight. Really good burgers! Turned my beef-loving husband into a turkey believer! I made these modifications: 1 pound of meat, 1/4 cup of goat cheese, 1 egg, 1/8 cup onion, 1 clove garlic and then kept the salt, pepper, breadcrumbs and parsley as-is. Enjoy, they are fantastic!

I changed this recipe up a little, due to others recommendations.  I also grilled them on our charcoal grill. They came out delicious!  I actually like this recipe better than regular burgers.

I've never seen my kids tear up a turkey burger the way they did these.  Everyone loved them!  Even my picky husband.  I caramelized the onions first and added a little Worcestershire sauce to the tops as I was cooking them.  They turned out great!  Thanks!

I made this recipe as-is with the exception of using a whole egg instead of just using the egg whites. I did not have any problems with the patties falling apart. Even though they did not taste like beef was beside the point, because turkey shouldn't taste like beef to begin with. They had a unique and good flavor of their own, and I would definitely make them again. I have made these 3 times as of this review, and again I have to say the overall flavor of these are great. These are officially a part of my recipe portfolio now.

I guess people have different tastes, but I was very disappointed by this recipe. It was so bland. Even covered with cheese, ketchup, lettuce, onion and pickle, it was just barely edible.

These are excellent!  I have had turkey burgers before and they were very dry but this recipe is great.  I followed other advice and added the whole egg, I also added a teaspoon of Worcestershire and two cloves of garlic instead of one.  We cooked them on a gas grill for about 20 minutes because I like thick burgers.  Thanks for sharing!  I like these better than beef burgers.

Super easy and really good!  I made a few changes because I did not have all of the ingredients.  I left out the onion and substituted a teaspoon of garlic powder, and put in dried parsley instead of fresh.  I also used the whole egg, including the yoke.  As recommended, I also added Worchester sauce.  Served it with cheddar, avocado and tomato. Was fantastic!

I have made these several times now and they certainly live up to their name.  I add a couple of splashes of worchestershire sauce and sub out the parsley with whatever I have on hand.  Thank you for sharing this absolutely delicious recipe.

Ok, these are not better than beef but they are definitely the best ground turkey concoction I have ever had.  I don't usually care for ground turkey at all but these are a keeper.  If you have trouble with the burgers falling apart your onions might just be too big.  They need to be diced pretty small.  Or even grated in.  I served these on Arnold Sandwich Thins (100 calories for the whole roll!) and topped with lettuce, tomato, raw onion, and buffalo chicken marinade.  My husband gobbled them up.  Definitely a keeper!

The burgers were great.  I used approx. 1 lb. 95% lean ground beef and 1 lb. extra lean turkey (that is all i had in the freezer).  I used 1 whole egg instead of egg whites, fresh onion, dried parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to taste. Then I sauteed some fresh mushrooms and topped the burgers off with fresh mushrooms.  My husband had no clue they were made with turkey and commented how great the burgers tasted.

I loves me a big beef burger - but it's refreshing not to see all the fat streaming out of my Foreman Grill when I have ground turkey on the grill plate... These definitely hit the spot!

I blew my beef hamburger-loving family away with these! They are a bit more time and labor intensive but they turned out fantastic!! Way better than any packaged turkey burgers you buy at the store. Can't wait to make them again!

These were great! I used whole eggs as opposed to just egg whites, as others suggested, so they would firm up. They turned out perfect. I added worcestershire sauce and used dried minced onion. They were less heavy than regular burgers and very tasty. I ate the leftovers for breakfast on toast. A keeper!

A really great basic recipe that allows one to tinker with it to suit their own tastes. I did use the whole egg and added in Frank's hot sauce for a bit of zing. plopped them right on my plug in foreman grill, waited 10 minutes, and perfect.

Love it! Hubby didn't even know it was turkey. Only a few changes: I used regular bread crumbs (didn't have italian bread crumbs on hand) added a dash of liquid smoke and a dash of Worcestershire. Cooked in the broiler and they tasted fabulous!

Yummmm! We made this last night and loved it! The only thing we changed was we added a little flour (wheat flour would work just as well) to the outside of the patties so that everything held together better. Try putting pickles on your burger, the flavor blends together really well.

These were great. We did them on the grill and they taste like regular hamburgers. Nice texture when cooked (I halfed the recipe and they were very hard to handle when raw).  I am going to try as meatloaf next time.  Thanks for a great recipe. We ate them with sweet potato fries and pepper jack cheese on wheat buns.

Per another reviewer, added a little Worcestershire and soy sauce along with a dash of hickory smoke flavoring. Left out the onions. Not the best, but if I'm in need to a simple burger, would consider this one.

For turkey burgers these are pretty good. They were juicy and didn't dry out the way turkey burgers usually do. My family still prefers beef for hamburgers but said these would be okay sometime :-)

I hate to be the one giving a bad review, but these burgers are 'actually' not that great. Made 4 burgers earlier this week and scaled all ingredients accordingly. My burgers were bland and very, very dry. Perhaps it was my fault.... My bf grilled ours (which may have caused them to be more dry than normal). Regardless, the recipe sumbitter indicated that any cooking method would work (hmmm...). Not even mustard (mayo for the bf), lettuce, tomato and red onion could jazz these up (believe me, I tried). I could only eat half of my burger which is too bad because I was HUNGRY! Maybe these will float your boat, but they definitely didn't ours. Thanks anyways!

I'm a burger lover; it took me a while to take the turkey leap. My husband and I were not disappointed! I will not be cooking beef burgers this summer. For a variation, try using chopped spinach, paremesan cheese and fresh basil in the patties. Also, I browned mine in a skillet with garlic butter.

My sister and I made these for dinner tonight, and they were really good. We left out the onion, added about 2 tbsp. worcestershire sauce, ketchup, mustard, and a few red pepper flakes. Before cooking, we added a light dusting of flour. They turned out really moist, but were quite thick. Next time we'll be using more red pepper flakes and make them thinner. A quick tasty meal, and much better than ground beef.

Very Delicious. Instead of egg whites, I used the whole egg didn't want to waste an egg yolk, maybe next time when i'm feeling a bit heathly I'll just use egg whites. I added some Soy Sauce to the mix and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. It was delicious, definately this recipe is a keeper.

YUM! Who needs beef now? Based on the reviews I read, I made a few tweaks to the recipe. I used a whole egg instead of just an egg white. I used Italian style bread crumbs (which has dried parseley in it) and also added a dash of soy sauce in it. And I did not mix the garlic directly into the mix. Instead, I pan fried the meat and sauteed the minced garlic before putting the meat in. I also put a lid over while cooking the meat so the steam would help. Put it at medium heat and the patties cooked in about 5-7 minutes. Also did a slight experiment with my 2nd half of the meat and mixed a little bit of feta cheese in it. It turned out very flavorful. I served it with whole wheat buns and it was great!

I made the spicy turkey burgers the other day and I would say these are just as delicious. Boyfried liked these better. The only thing I did differenlty was added seasoning salt to the mix, and before hand sauteed the onions, garlic, and added green chiles. I used whole wheat bread instead of buns, fabulous. They are even better as leftovers, ran out of bread so I ate it plain, and it was even very tasty without bread. Thanks for the recipe!!

I cut this in half and embellished it a bit with the worcestshire sauce and soy sauce splashes.  I also used seasoned salt instead of regular.  These were wonderful.  Didn't want to waste the egg so I used the whole thing.  I added them to a cold grill pan and they did not fall apart nor were they dry.

These were wonderful. They even got past my picky boyfriend. He had 2 after he frowned his nose at the idea of turkey burgers. He ATE his words!! I did add the soy and Worch. sauce. I only used 1.4 lbs but kept the ingredient amount the same - well I eye-balled it. Cooked it on the George F for 8 minutes. Still moist today for leftover lunch.

As a person who loves a hamburger, I've slowly grown to love turkey burgers. I find all kinds of seasonings to add to them. I prefer Goya because it's full of flavor and you don't have to use a lot of it. Sometimes I'll just use S&P, onion & garlic powder. Turkey burgers are great because they don't have to be cooked as long as beef.

This recipe is great! I used only 1 lb of turkey and ended up with 8 normal sized hamburgers. I added some worcestershire and some soy sauce. I used fresh bread crumbs and a whole egg. I broiled 4 inches from broiler for 6 minutes on each side. They came out perfect! Served with sauted mushrooms and guacamole.

When I told my kids I was making turkey burgers, they said "eeewww." But when they had these, they loved them & wanted seconds.  I added worcestershire sauce, as others suggested, but I think they would've been great without it. My husband made them a second time & added soy sauce, which he thought made them better. I will definitely make these instead of regular hamburgers from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic and all the posted tips were helpful as well. Both husband and son loved these as much as a regular burger. I've found that the tip on using a whole egg, versus whites only, did help keep things together and I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs as well as the onions, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder for flavoring. A nice versatile recipe that you could probably add more of your favorites to as suggested in the other tips.

These were really good, I got tired of making turkey burgers that were too hard and kept "recurring" through the night. This recipe was wonderful. The burgers were light , flavorful, and they 'stayed down". Awesome recipe.

These are yummy! I used my Foreman Grill, but if I hadn't I'm sure they would have melted through the grill, like half of the mix stuck to my hand. I coated the patties with bread crumbs to make a nice crispy outside and I cooked it on my preheated grill for 10 minutes. I could probably have done it for 9 and it would still have been good.

I think these turkey burgers deserve a 5 star rating but my hubby thought they were a high 3 (3.8 to be exact) so I decided to give a 4. He thought they were a bit bland. Next time I will take the advice of some of the other reviewers and add Worchestire sauce and some other spices.

We made this recipe exactly as it calls and LOVED it!  My husband said, "I hate turkey burger!" and I encouraged him to give it a shot.  By the middle of the burger he said, "This is actually good!"  I served it on a reduced fat whole wheat bun with ketchup, mustard, pickle and grilled onions - my husband also put pepper jack cheese on his!  We will definitely make this again...not sure what went wrong for the people with bad reviews...

My husband, who is a straight up carnivore and is all about the beef, loves these burgers. He vouches for me when I tell people that turkey burgers can be delicious. I'm so glad I found this recipe.

I loved this.  I also added a little liquid smoke and some Worcester sauce.  I made a double batch and froze them individually so I could cook a few at a time.

I made this recipe last night. It's really delicious!!! I added worcestershire sauce too. Instead of just egg white I added the egg yolk too. It's really yummy. My son doesn't eat turkey but last night was an exception. He loved the turkey burgers that I made. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I actually don't like turkey burgers, so I was pleasantly surprised by these burgers. My daughter REALLY dislikes turkey burgers, and had these one night when that was all there was, and she actually finished her whole burger! The only change was instead of a garlic clove and 1/2 tsp of salt, I used 1 tsp garlic salt and I think that might of made a difference. Anyway- thank you for a yummy healthy recipe:)

Best recipe I have used and extremely easy because of the on hand ingredients.  I substitued Parsley with a "Fines Herbes" (Tarragon, Chervil, Parsley, etc Mix), and added a splash of Worcestershire Sauce after I flipped the burger once....turned out great.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  I am not a burger guy at all and these were awesome enough for a repeat!

GREAT recipe! I've tried to turkey burgers several times and have never been able to get them moist. I used the entire egg instead of the whites to give it that added moisture. DELICIOUS! It's hard to go from a very most, fatty burger to this. The texture just feels weird to you at first but it was well worth it! Easy recipe with a lot of things you're already have in the house.

I made these for dinner tonight and we loved them. They were moist and flavorful. I did add a little worchestshire sauce to them but other than that I followed the recipe. I'm sure I'll make these over and over again.

I made these burgers for my fiance this summer and we absolutely loved them:)  The first time I used italian seasoned ground turkey since it was all the supermarket had and it was so fantastic I'm not incline to ever try it with plain turkey.  Now we have them at least twice a month and not once have they disappointed us or our guests.  Highly recommended!

My husband and sons loved these.  My husband said they are better than beef burgers.  I did everything as is only added lightly more breadcrumbs and omitted onion because I don't like them.  I think next time I will try the worsterchire sauce as others recommended.  I grilled them on an indoor grill.

These are great! We made our own breadcrumbs by pulling a piece of bread into smaller bits and putting into an oven at 225. Only need 1 slice for 1/4 c. We had to use dry parsley, but they still turned out great. With fresh parsley I'm sure it has lots more flavor. We also added some cayenne pepper for a little more kick. We also didn't have eggs, so we used 1 T. milled flaxseed with 3 T. water and let sit 1-2 mins. They were still awesome. We're waiting for the rest of our patties to freeze right now!

I thought these were pretty good!   I was out of bread crumbs so I used cracker crumbs.  I cooked them on the grill and gave them a shot of worchestershire while they were cooking.

These are great! We normally only eat beef burgers but gave these a try for health reasons. My husband and I both enjoyed them.

Yes, I agree.  This was actually delicious!
I did add some worcestershire sauce and Johnny's Seasoning Salt and my family enjoyed them. My husband said it tasted like sausage and was happy to get great flavor and less artery clogging.

I love hamburgers and have been missing them so much since we gave up beef at our house. What a delight to find these were actually a good replacement for beef burgers. Three of us enjoyed them and will eat them again with pleasure.

My husband HATES turkey burgers and he said he liked these. I added worcheste sauce and hamburger seasoning as suggested by some. I also topped it with pepper jack cheese.

This was my first attempt at Turkey Burgers and we loved them!  I could give up beef burgers in a heartbeat after this recipe.  We added just a bit more bread crumbs to hold this all together and then stuck the burgers in the freezer for 15 minutes to help hold them together as well.  Terrific recipe and very healthy!

These were SOOO good!!  I used a little soy sauce, some worceshire sauce, and a splash of liquid smoke since that seems to be a popular addition to the recipe. i also used 1 whole beaten egg instead of two egg whites and I topped them with provolone cheese.  The result was an incredibly moist and delicious burger!!  We'll definitely be making this one again!!!

After reading several reviews, I added worchester sauce, soy sauce and seasoning salt to the recipe and they turned out great! Also another secret is to use the whole egg, not just the whites, because the yolk is what holds the burgers together. Definitely plan on making these again, it is hands down the best turkey burger recipe I have found.

These are very good.  They are moist and flavorful, and a great substitute for hamburgers.  My dedicated beef eater husband says that these were really good, although he'd always prefer beef.  But that is saying alot.  I will definitely make again.  Oh, I added soy sauce and extra garlic.  Great recipe!

These were really good turkey burgers - my bf loved them.  We cut down on the salt slightly and increased the black pepper (just personal taste), and the bead crumbs I chose were also garlic and herb flavored.  We cooked these on the grill, so I added a little more bread crumbs to make sure they would stick together (probably would have without them).  We added a slice of provolone and condiments to taste, and served on whole wheat buns.  Delicious!  I think the suggestions in other reviews to use seasoning salt and/or Worcestershire sauce would bump these up to a 5-star rating for sure.

I made these exactly like the receipe called for with no changes and they were a big hit at a family cookout. There were 2 guys there that would never consider eating a Turkey burger and they even said these were "actually pretty good".  That's saying a lot coming from these two!  This will definitely become my staple Turkey burger recipe!

As others suggested,  I added a few drops of liquid smoke and a few drops of worcestershire sauce.  I also threw in some Caribbean jerk seasoning (per another recipe on this site) and increased the garlic to 1 clove per pound.

My 35 year old husband recently had a heart attack, and I've had to cut red meat out of our diet. We LOVE burgers, so it's been especially hard. These were awesome with the modifications suggested by some other reviewers (worcestershire, soy sauce, and liquid smoke). I also added seasoned salt, but it didn't need it. Delicious! Thanks!

This was just OK. I used the suggestions of others and added more breadcrumbs but I think it made it to grainy. I will try this one more time with some other alterations.

Trying to get healthy and tried these out - very very good and will be making these again. Followed the recipe exactly and added the suggestions of worsteschire, soy sauce, and lightly floured the patties. Even hubby, who was extremely skeptical, liked them. Served them with spicy sweet potato fries.  Update: I had frozen leftover patties and defrosted them in the microwave for dinner last night. They were soggy and would not hold their shape. I put far too much flour on them and it helped only a little.  I finally had to put them back in the freezer for a short time to firm up so they wouldn't fall thru the grate on the grill.  They came out fine, but definitely took extra time.  Just a heads up to you! :)

These are good.   Just stepped up the seasonings a bit.  Only made with 1 lb. of ground turkey, 1 whole egg, additional Italian style bread crumbs because the mixture was too liquidy.  Added more garlic (can never have too much!!) and dried parsley.  Let set a few hours in frig before making patties.  Served with a bit of mayo on a bun topped with avacodo and tomato slices.

These are so good!  I took the advice of another person and added a good 16 shakes for worcestershire sauce and a packet's worth of soy sauce.  Also, if you mix everything together and let it sit in the fridge overnight, it's even better!  They're also great for making the patties and freezing for later.

We no longer make beef burgers in my house because of this recipe! With 3 kids under 3  this is a real crowd pleaser. The texture of the turkey is nicer too... no grisle bits just nice and smooth. Love it.

If it were up to me, I'd rather have a beef burger any day of the week.  That being said, my wife likes to eat healthy and wanted turkey, so voila.  As far as turkey burgers go, one of the best I've had.  Added a little liquid smoke to the recipe, used a very large onion, diced the 1/4 c, sliced and carmelized the rest.  Add the carmelized onions on top with a wheat bun, Fantastic!!!  BTW, the burgers stay together nicely.

I stopped eating hamburgers six years ago, so the only kind of burger I eat now is turkey.  I am always willing to mix up the turkey. I found this recipe to be good, but also added a few suggested additions made by other reviewers.  I changed the servings to 4 and froze the patties since I am just cooking for one.  I used a whole egg instead of just the white, added liquid smoke, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and a few tsp of sweet relish into the mix (not on top).

Very tasty! Added some Worcestershire Sauce and Texas Pete, but not much. Kept all else as-is.  Very juicy and full of flavor.  Put in freezer for 15 min before placing on grill, and these held together perfectly!!! Will make again!!!

Turkey burgers are a staple at our house, and the flavor in this recipe was really good. I used all-white ground turkey, and made some in a frying pan and some on the grill. Those cooked in the pan were wonderful, but the grill dried them out. This was undoubtedly due to the low-fat meat and not the recipe.

These are fantastic! Another variation that I've tried - turn them into meatballs by adding 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the original recipe and a bit more breadcrumbs. Roll into meatballs,  brown them in olive oil in skillet, and then simmer in spaghetti sauce. Really, really good!

I made these last night- Mike is a picky eater and he liked them- he didn't even want the cheese on it, just a bit ketchup, placed in a bun and that's all.

Thanks so much Trudy

This recipe is so good!  My family loves this recipe!  I am watching my calories and my DH is diabetic, so this was PERFECT for us!  
I added a little soy sauce, worcestershire sauce & then to get in some more veggies I added green onion, yellow onion & spinach, all finely chopped. (I didn't have any parsley).  I forgot to add the bread crumbs the first time I made these and they still held together & did not fall apart.  The second time I made these with the bread crumbs and I honestly couldn't tell the difference.  They were delicious both ways!  It tastes like beef...only better I think!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wow.  I have always thought the idea of turkey burgers sounded disgusting, since I eat for pleasure rather than nutrition, but this were GREAT!  My boyfriend loved them too.  I, too, added the whole egg, extra garlic, and season salt.

I love these(so does the picky boyfriend) I've never added anything extra, have used dried parsley and fresh, they are good both ways but I think the fresh stuff helps with moisture.  I've also substituted ground chicken with great results as well.  I make these and freeze them all the time.

While I enjoyed these burgers my husband did not. He actually made me promise that I wouldn't make them again. I did try the same idea but with beef and he seemed to like that better so it was probably just a matter of taste. I would say great if you like and are use to eating ground turkey.

These burgers were the best. First time I have ever use ground turkey. Kept waiting for the right recipe to try it, and this was it. I used a whole egg instead of the egg whites. The patties held together great, and they were juicy and so good. Now I am thinking of other ways to use ground turkey. Thank you Trudy.

We make these often in our house, and they are delicious!  Definitely a keeper.  If you are looking for a lean dinner, make sure that you get the lean turkey meat.  There is some out there that is high in fat, so be sure to get the lean package.  THE BEST!

Very yummy turkey burgers -- will definitely make again!  Texture and taste was great.  I also followed the advice of other reviewers and added a few shakes each of Worchestshire sauce, soy sauce and liquid smoke.

My DH and I made these burgers for dinner tonight and the end result was pretty darn good, but we did make a few changes.  First, we scaled the recipe to 4 servings.  We also used minced shallot instead of onion and I sauteed the shallot with the garlic for a few minutes before adding to the turkey.  Lastly, following the advice of another reviewer, we added 1/2 tsp seasoning salt, 1 Tbsp worcestershire, 1 Tbsp of soy sauce, 1 whole egg and about 1/4-1/3 cup bread crumbs to the turkey mixture; we also grilled the burgers instead of frying.  The burgers ended up being very good and really moist but as my husband said...while they are good, they still would not replace his regular grilled burger.  EDIT:  I made these again and they turned out significantly better.  This time I used ground chicken, about 1Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 small grated onion, 3 cloves garlic, 1 egg white and about 2 1/2 Tbsp of seasoned bread crumbs.  We did grill them again - and they were definitely 5 stars!

Excellent- not dry at all and good flavor.  I added about a teaspoon (for 2 burgers) of Dijon mustard and served with Kim's macaroni salad (from this site).

These were far better than expected.  I used 1/4 of the recipe (1lb of turkey), and i added a dash of dijon mustard, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and I used a whole egg.  Also, since turkey tends to get really mushy, i added additional bread crumbs until it got to a consistency that I liked.

We made these tonight and they were great. Looked at some of the other reviews for ideas and here is what worked for us. Follow the recipe then add 1/2 teaspoon kitchen bouquet, shaved the onion on a grater, 1/2 teaspoon soy and worcestire sauce, used seasoning salt, then put them in the fridge for about an hour to help them "firm" up for the grill. Awesome with all the regular burger fixins!

These were fantastic!  I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used crushed saltines. I also added a few teaspoons of worcestershire. Also, I cooked them on our gas grill for about 5 minutes on each side over low to medium heat.  I will be making these again soon!

This is a really good recipe that produces a very tender and flavorful burger.  I found it helpful to form the patties on a freezer or waxed paper lined cookie sheet and chilling them well before cooking in order to make handling them easier and to help them stay together and maintain their shape better.  Just as the title implies, these are actually delicious turkey burgers and the kids, ages 8, 10, 12, and 15, say they actually like them better than traditional beef burgers.  I am really pleased as these are so much healthier and fit the bill too!

These were so good!  It was my first attempt at turkey burgers and they came out delicious. You could cut down on the salt a little, maybe by half to cut the sodium as they were plenty salty.Don't grill these though, I don't think they'd hold up to grilling at all.

Personally, I thought these were a little bland, but with the right amount of bbq sauce, they turned out pretty good.

These were really great.  I used the 99% fat-free turkey and they were perfect.  I think the trick is to cook them slow on a low flame if you're using the really low fat.  The fresh parsley is great and definitely would not have the same taste if you substitute dried.  Also added garlic salt to taste. Thanks for sharing; I will definitely make again.

Better than hamburgers.  Moist, full of flavor, and easy to make.  I've tried a few other Turkey Burger recipes from this site and this by far is the best. Thank you!

These were really good. I've never made turkey burgers before and didn't know what to expect, but this was a really simple recepie. I had to add extra bread crumbs because the turkey was so soft and sticky and they were a little dry, but it might have been because I used 99% fat free ground turkey breast.

Wow, I'm impressed!  As you can see from earlier reviews, this is a really flexible recipe.  I also used what I had on hand - Italian breadcrumbs, basil in place of the parsley, and I doubled the garlic.  Served on cracked wheat buns with a slice of Tillamook Colby Jack Cheddar.  Delicious!!!

I thought these were a five but my boyfriend only gave them a three (he will always prefer red-meat hamburgers).  We followed the recipe but added a little Worcestershire sauce and A-1.  They were moist but stayed together, and they were very flavorful - however I added a little extra onion and a lot of extra garlic. (I divided the recipe in thirds but accidentally added two full cloves of garlic when the recipe only called for 1/3 clove - !)  I would make these again as I am trying to find delicious ways to cut calories - but my boyfriend's opinion of them was just "They were edible."

I don't consider myself a turkey fan, but this sure was good. I did add a TB soy sauce and worcestershire, as well as a few dashes of liquid smoke. Good stuff.

These were great. I made 6 large patties which held together great. Versatile enough that the whole family could dress them to their taste. I topped mine with green salsa, hubby topped his with Heinz 57 & pepper jack cheese, kids used ketchup. I used 1/2 reg grd turkey & 1/2 grd white turkey, 1 whole egg & substituted seasoned Panko for the bread crumbs as that is all I had. Will definately make these again.

These are fantastic!  Very juicy and tender, not dry and crumbly like you normally envision turkey burgers to be.  Even my husband who had previously refused to eat turkey burgers loves them.  Add some chopped up jalapenos for some kick.

I liked this recipe except even with the soy sauce and worchestire sauce it seemed bland, BUT I liked that the meat stayed together well and had the texture of a beef hamburger! Although, it's not as heavy as a regular burger, which I like! I didn't read about using liquid smoke until after I had made them, so I will try adding that also next time!  Overall, I couldn't give the recipe 5 stars just because it seemed a little bland, but it was still pretty good!

I love making this burger because it's so low fat and delicious!  I use more onions and I added green onions to the mix.  Plus I make it a really thin patty, yummy!

Fine, no-frills turkey burgers.  Perfectly functional, but nothing special.

My husband was very skeptical about trying these but admitted that "they were better than expected."  I followed the recipe exactly but next time I will add a little more spice and some W sauce.  You do need to be careful of them falling apart on the grill.  They don't hold together very well until they are cooked a bit so wait a little bit longer to turn these then you would beef hambergers.

Fanastic flavor. I will never make another kind of patty again! My meat eating friends said they'd prefer it over a beef burger. I serve it with a little monterey on top, tomato, fresh spinach leaves and sandwiched betwen an onion roll.

This is my first time making turkey burgers and I can't believe I've waited so long to make them!  This recipe was absolutely delicious...as the title states!  Even my 4 year old asked for another one and she is fairly picky.  My husband said these tasted "really good" and I thought they were wonderful.  DEFINITELY a repeat recipe in our house.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing!  I did cook them on an indoor grill (like the George Foreman one) and that added that outdoor taste.  I just can't say enough about how good these are.  Thanks for sharing!

Sensational recipe! I needed a breakfast sausage, and used this recipe with traditional Thanksgiving herbs - it was moist and flavorful! (Unfortunately I cook for folks who don't eat onion, so I had to modify the flavors.) Just what I needed! It really held up on the brunch buffet, and was even more flavorful the next day! Thank you!!

The grocery store ran out of ground turkey so I made these with lean ground beef. Added a few splashes of W. sauce. Not bursting with flavor, but good. I bet the flavor comes out more when you make it with turkey.

These were excellent. I made them and didn't tell my husband they were turkey-he hates turkey. He had no idea. When I finally told him, he said they did taste funny. Yeah right! Thet're really delicious and you can't tell they're not beef. Plus, they're healthy. I will make these again.

Awesome! Moist, low-fat! I added worchershire sauce and a little cayenne pepper and cooked them on the George Forman grill. They did not take long to cook this method-about 7 minutes. We'll definitely make them again.

This recipe was a lifesaver for me I do not eat meat and haven't since I started cooking for myself. My husband has recently decided to start eating it again and I'm clueless. Well this was easy to make and my husband said it was delicious much moister than others he's tried..... Now if I could just stop breaking them to pieces checking to see if their done! :)

These were delicious. They were very juicy and flavorful. I used dried parsley, added fresh basil, and as suggested I added a splash of worcestershire. I also topped these with monterey jack cheese. Yummm... I will definately make these again.

Family enjoyed encluding kids.  I cut recipe in half and used shallots instead of onions.  If grilling outdoors, watch cooking time not to dry out burgers.  I will definately do again and will try it with some italian fried long hot peppers on top (not the kids).

Also served with garlic & tyme oven roasted red potatoes and a tossed salad.

Very good.  Cooked better on George Foreman Grille, burned on the skillet on low heat.  Tasted like turkey meat loaf.  My fiancee really liked them too!  We put them on a whole wheat hamburger bun with mayo & ketchup, and melted some cheese on them!

These were a great alternative to the beef burgers.  Usually when using Turkey, they don't come out as moist for me, however, this recipe was perfect!

Very good for a turkey burger.  Usually I find them dry, but this was very moist and tasty.  Used dried parsley cuz i didn't have fresh, and it tasted fine.  These came out tasting more like a meatloaf or meatball though because of the spices.  However, I did add a little bit of cajun powder, paprika and seasoned salt, so that may have been why.  Even my boyfriend, who previously was king of the turkey burgers said that he liked them.

These are easy and delicious burgers!  I had a package of 1.2 lbs. ground lean turkey breast so I had to adjust the ingredients.  I used powdered garlic, a whole egg, and I grated my onion. Made 4 large burgers.  Next time, I will add a little smoke flavoring and chill the meat mixture to marry flavors and to make it easier to shape the patties. We prefer not to eat a lot of beef so this fits into our diet perfectly.  Thanks, Trudi, for sharing this delicious recipe.

The recipe name is quite fitting -- these are delicious and moist turkey burgers.  3 lbs of turkey is a lot so I mixed up a batch, made patties and put some in the freezer for later use.  They have been wonderful - even my toddler likes these.

Very good recipe. Both my husband (who is a fairly picky eater) and I thought these were delish. Didn't use onion and did add the Worcheshire sauce. This one is a keeper! Thanks!

Yum! These were tasty. I enjoy a good, juicy burger and this is healthy to boot! I added Worcestershire sauce as others suggested. Makes a lot so I froze half the mixture for another meal.

This is very good!  I did add some basil and oregano, since I used fresh bread crumbs rather than seasoned.

Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely yummy!  I added some Worcestershire sauce and it just enhanced it even further.  A definite addition to our barbecue menu!

These were pretty good!  Nice and juicy!  I added the worchestershire sauce as most recommended, but I would have done it anyway because I add it to just about everything I make, even cole slaw dressing!  My husband said this one was a keeper, and even my kids ate it, which is pretty darned imprressive!

This recipe was excellent!  However I followed all the advice from the other reviews.  I put in 2 spashes of worchestire sauce, garlic powder instead of garlic, 1 whole egg and then cooked.  Ours came out a little dry, next time I will definetly be broiling this. It would be awsome with carmalized onions on top. It was so good.  I am now a big fan of turkey burgers.

My boyfriend Al, who is very critical about his food, loved these burgers! I followed the recipe but scaled it down to 4 servings. I also added a few splashes of worstershire and instaed of salt I used seasoned salt. I grilled these and they turned out juicy and delicious. The whole meal cost me about $5.00! We will be making these a regular on our menu. Thanks, Trudi.

This was just okay, not a favorite though.  My husband wasn't very fond of them either.  I just felt like they were missing something.  Next time, I'll try to spice it up a little.

I thought these were great.  I added a little diced green pepper and then topped them with fat free sour cream mixed with a greek spice.  I put them on whole wheat buns.  Yummy.  I do think next time I will add a piece of lettuce for crunch as my meat adoring hubby thought they were still a little too "soft" in texture.

Lots of great flavor, but the finished product seemed pretty close to meatloaf.  Don't get me wrong, they were great and I couldn't wait to eat the leaftovers, but I still like plain turkey burgers seasoned with Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up Salt the best.

Very yummy! Used only a pound of turkey, but kept the other ingredients almost the same.

One time I had some feta cheese on the fridge, so I threw that in with some oregano and a dash of lemon juice for yummy greek-flavoured patties.

I love turkey burgers, but compared to how I normally cook them, mine are totally lame. These were fantastic. With the elimination of the salt, and the addition of more seasonings, I was a happy camper. I'll have to tell my mom about this recipe; her name is Trudi too!! Thanks a heap!

This is the same way I make turkey burgers but I add 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and 1/4 cup 2% milk which makes them moister.  I also use the mixed light and dark turkey meat which is also moister.  They tend to be very dry with only breast meat.

This recipe is great.  Hard to tell the difference in flavour from a regular ground beef burger.  Made a big batch and formed into patties for the freezer.

Omigosh!  My husband and I couldn't believe how good these were when we tried them for the first time last night.  These rival good beef burgers, and we'll probably forego the beef burgers for these from now on.  What a great way to eat healthier.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this recipe according to the directions but we thought it was just "ok."  Too dry, too flavorless.  Maybe it was because I used 99% fatfree turkey.

Absolutely wonderful!  Thank you Trudi!
These are packed full of flavor - you eat them not only because they are "healthier" than ground beef, but because they are soooo good - it has the perfect mix of garlic, onion, parsley.  It is a different flavor than regular hamgurger, but extremely tasty.  This is a divine recipe!

So good!! They came out delicious and juicy. I made mine on the grill and they were amazing! I added some Worcestershire sauce to it and a little bit of diced jalapeños to give it a little kick

These were awesome! I added extra seasonings and onion to the mix, topped with sriracha mayo, and zucchini fries on the side. A yummy substitute for a regular burger and fries. Super easy and froze well.

Flavor was perfect, however, I did have to  add more bread crumbs (Panko) to make the meat firmer. I fried one patty and baked the rest :)

I love this recipe.  We've eaten these four nights in a row! I use homemade bread crumbs so most of my flavoring comes from that.  But these are the perfect consistency and all!

This is the best tasting turkey burger ever.  Often, turkey is bland, but the ingredients in this recipe compliment each other resulting in a tasty, moist burger.  Yummy!

These really are delicious! There is no need for the egg whites when making them.  I added half of a jalapeno to the mix and we grilled them... yes, yes, yes. The secret is to grilling these is to freeze them and put them on the grill right from the freezer.

I used everything included but with a 2lb organic Turkey meat instead of 3lb and it turned out phenomenal!! Diced the onions really really finely as I don't like them that much but honestly it was really good. Went well w everything burger toppings and side of baked beans

I have been making these for quite awhile now and they are great.  Use dark meat turkey, my own plain bread crumbs with a little basil, thyme and oregano from my spice cabinet, and a few fresh sage leaves.  I usually use about 2 1/2 pounds of ground turkey.  They turn out great on the stove or the grill.  If grilling, I spray with oil on both sides prior to cooking.  Family favorite.

These were delicious, but as a novice cook I will say that the recipe needs to be a little more specific. It didn’t say to cook the burgers in oil, which is necessary so they don’t stick to the pan. I added a tablespoon of oil to the pan for 4 patties. Also- cooking time is about 5 minutes per side. So good!

So I’m normally one that says make it as is and then adjust to your taste. However I think this is a basic enough recipe that you will find yourself playing with it. Turkey burgers have become a mid-week staple but I usually just buy fresh ready patties from the meat section (so $$$$!). Tonight I decided to try making them completely from scratch. My mixture made 11 patties with perfect thickness.  I used panko (had them already), 2 whole eggs, parsley, garlic powder, minced onion, Worchestershire,  garlic pepper and salt. I also added some leftover riced cauliflower that I wanted to use up. I wish I had spinach to add as well. But I mixed the ingredients well, formed patties, and let them sit in the fridge while I prepped the rest of dinner.  I pan fried them and they were so delicious!! Got rave reviews. Served with corn and green beans. So filling and soooo easy. I want to try Cajun style with diced peppers next. So yeah use this recipe as a base but for sure make to your family’s taste!

Not bad, although I think next time I'm going to go with more garlic (I love garlic, so this probably not necessary for most people making these).  I had to substitute dry parsley flakes as I didn't have any fresh parsley available, so I'm pretty sure if I had the fresh parsley they would have come out better.

I have used this recipe multiple times using the dried parsley. Today I made it with fresh parsley and I won’t do it again. I feel like it left the patties very moist, to the point I was concerned they weren’t done. The other times the burgers came out perfect with the dried parsley.

These turned out really nice. I followed the recipe as it was,  cutting it down to only 4 servings. They cooked up well (pan fried them), and didn't dry out at all. Next time, I will try adding other ingredients to the meat (ie. Worcestershire sauce, red bell pepper, etc as per other reviews). A nice (and healthier) alternative to beef burgers! I served it with a slice of Swiss cheese and spread homemade garlic aioli on the buns :) YUMMM!

These were excellent. My first time using ground turkey and I couldn't be more pleased with how they turned out. Used 1pound turkey, big spoonful of breadcrumbs, 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1 whole egg, chopped Parsley, 1 clove garlic minced, a few twists each of salt and pepper, and I added like 6 shakes of Worcestershire. Made 5 patties which was perfect. They tasted great fresh and reheated very well the next day. I will definitely be making these again and checking more recipes for ground turkey.

My family and I loved this! I kinda warped the recipe a bit though. Instead of bread I used crushed stuffing, I added grated onion and carrot, I added Worcestershire sauce like one person recommend in the comments, and added spices like onion powder, garlic salt, garlic pepper, Italian spice, and hot sauce. Oh and instead of making burgers I made Salisbury steak! I used the turkey fat/ drippings along with a chicken cube (instead of broth), flour, butter, and black pepper for gravy. Made mash potatoes and a little carrot onion salad with raisins. It was good!

I'm confused... the recipe calls for the burgers to be cooked in a skillet yet the picture clearly shows grill marks??  I guess they don't look as good if they're made per the recipe?

These turned out great! I had some leftover sauteed peppers and onions that I diced and added in place of the raw onion. Used 1 whole egg instead of egg whites. Grilled them, added provolone cheese, and served on onion buns with avocado, lettuce and mayo.

I've shied away from turkey burgers in the past because I was concerned they would be dry and flavorless.   This recipe was a game changer!  I added some minced red bell pepper for an extra pop and had the juiciest, most delicious burgers ever!

Like other reviewers, I added fun flavorings (Worchestershire, soy, a little chili seasoning mix!)  Sprinkled each patty with grated Parmesan cheese.  Delicious and quick.  Oh, and a whole egg...

I loved this recipe!  The only change I made was adding red pepper flakes to the meat mixture- without it, the burger was a bit bland.

This is an excellent turkey burger. I generally use the 1 lb turkey trays so I adjust my quantities to 1 heaped tablespoon of breadcrumbs and 1 egg. Also I often don't have fresh parsley so I sub with dried basil and it works great. I like my onions so I chop them real fine and keep more or less the same amount in there. One thing I tried today, was adding crushed red peppers into one half of my turkey mix for my husband and me, while my kids got the very flavorful version minus the spicy kick.

I was looking for a recipe to tone down about 1/3 lb. of  very spicy ground deer sausage that was given to us by a "dear" friend.  I also had about 1/3 lb. for  ground pork that I wanted to use.  I had about 1 1/3 lbs of ground turkey.  I adjusted the proportions in the recipe down accommodate my 2 lbs of ground meat.  Also, I used 1 whole egg rather than just egg whites.  I apologize for rating a recipe that I changed so much, but it really turned out to be very good so I wanted to share!

Great idea! You can also form the patty and press them into bread crumbs on the outside so the form the light crust and don’t stick as much!! Add some jalapeño as a garnish and kick it up a notch :) happy cooking!

This beef lover did NOT find these delicious, at all. Perhaps because I used extra lean turkey. It  just completely lacked flavour. I even applied tips here (whole egg, Worchestershire and soya sauces). Might as well have been sawdust. Two stars in case it was because of the low fat turkey, but what I ate deserved a single star (for nutrients and not poisoning me). In the past, I’ve not minded turkey burger/meatloaf recipes with when combined with pork, so I’ll look for those.

These are very tasty and moist. I made as written using a whole egg instead of 2 whites just to not have any egg left over.  I had Italian breadcrumbs so used those. I have a cast iron griddle so put that on my grill to cook them, and have pan fried them on the stove also. I love them. They have a nice flavor, and I put all kinds of different toppings on them- avocado; mayonnaise; lettuce; mustard; tomato; cranberry; add a little soy sauce; a little liquid smoke, whatever I want- not all these at once! Thanks for a good recipe.

I made these burgers and added all the ingredients, plus  a little Lowerys seasoning salt.   I so added the entire egg instead of just tbe egg white.  I used the Hawaiian hamburger buns and added some American cheese to it, along with mayo, ketchup, lettuce, tomato and onions.  This burger was absolutely delicious.   I can honestly say, that I will never eat a hamburger ever again.  This is my new favorite burgers

I never review anything, but I had to this time. I added a whole egg, plus soy sauce, ginger, grated onion, seas salt, oregano, cracker crumbs since I had no bread crumbs (which ended up to be about a quarter cup), cumin and Worcestershire sauce. These were amazing, even my husband who says I can’t cook turkey burgers said they were yummy and didn’t taste like turkey. I also put them in seasoned flour like a previous review suggested, stated together and got a nice crust. Well done!!

These were really good. I made a few changes as suggested by others. Seasoned salt instead of regular salt, added one tbsp of worchire sauce, used one whole egg instead of egg whites and used italian bread crumbs.

my family loved these, including my 2,5&6yo boys. My mother was talking 10 shades of smack that I made a Turkey burger and once she ate it, she asked for them again. My husband who is known for his burgers, prefers these now. we are trying to eat healthier and its awesome when it actually tastes awesome! thank you for this recipe

Came out well, but next time I may experiment with extra spices and seasoning. Also need to figure out how to make them a little drier -- they kept falling apart while cooking!

Really good for meatballs. I am a beginner cook, and it was difficult for me to tell when they were cooked all the way through without cutting them in half. Most of the time when I make these, I end up chopping them all in half in the skillet. Next time I will probably make smaller meatballs.

We love these! I use 1 package of meat and full amount of everything else. Super flavorful! Also, because we like fries, I cook the burger on a rack with the fries. 425 degrees for 25 minutes. As the cheese then broil all. Perfect!

It was a nice change to the normal beef burger.. My family liked it. Turkey is very mild so I feel the amount of onion was not enough. I think next time I will either add carmelized onion to the mixture or serve on top.

I usually would prefer a hamburger over a turkey burger, but this recipe was really easy & tasted great.   I was able to make it during my lunch break; however, I cheated or substituted fresh onions & garlic with freeze-dried.

These were great! As per other people’s reviews I used one whole egg instead of two whites, half a cup of panko as I had no bread crumbs, and added some soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. I made 8 burgers and sautéed them in a little oil after sprinkling both sides with flour. They were juicy and delicious. I used 85% lean ground turkey. I think that the super lean ground turket

Made these twice, first time with 2 lbs of turkey. They were perfect. Second time didn’t realize the recipe called for 3 lbs, so I followed that ugh too turkey-ish. First time was so much better! Added a splash of olive oil, and brushed patties with olive oil before putting on grill because they really stick! Made slider sized ones that were awesome! Nice and browned on the outside.

We make these all the time: they are so good! The first time I inadvertently left out the eggs, but the meat stayed together just fine. I would highly recommend spraying or basting the tops and bottoms of the patties with oil before grilling. It helps to keep them from sticking. The recipe is versatile, so one can use whatever seasonings are on hand.

I've tried several turkey burger recipes and this one is our new favorite.  It's easy to prepare and tasty.  I followed the advice of a couple of other reviewers:  used 2 whole eggs rather than egg whites, doubled the bread crumbs and put the patties in the freezer for a couple of hours to keep them from falling apart.  I also added a little bit of fried chopped bacon.

Oops!  I didn't pay attention to the amount of turkey!  It called for 3 pounds and I had one pound.  I had already mixed the egg whites and spices.  So I used 1/3 of the mixture and it came out a bit dry.  But it was tasty and my hubby and 17-year-old son ate it and said they would eat it again.
Also, I didn't have breadcrumbs but improvised by crushing 3 Melba Toasts with my own added seasonings. Maybe that made it dryer? I'm no expert cook!
So I think I need to cut the whole recipe by 1/3 for my 1 pound of  turkey meat next time.

Made these - but like everyone else- with changes.  I used an 85/15 turkey mix.  I used one egg with the yolk, 2 TBS of soy instead of salt, and a TBS of worstershire.  Because of these liquids, I used a cup of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and they still were juicy.  I also used  a half TBS  of garlic powder instead of chopped.  I then patted the patties with flour on each side.  Delicious!

This is a great simple recipe and the burgers taste delicious. I only use 2 lbs of meat though. So if used 3 Ib I would up the seasonings by 1/3. II also used minced onions because they are delicious and much quicker than cutting up an onion. I made skillet sweet potatoes with grilled Parmesan garlic pineapple slices.

We didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, so my review is a combination of what others have suggested and using what we had. I only had two pounds of turkey. I used onion powder instead of regular onion, plus one whole egg instead of egg whites. I used minced garlic from a jar and added dashes of soy and worcestershire sauce to keep the meat from drying out.  Because of the added liquid from the sauces, I also increased the bread crumbs to 3/4 cup. We decided to use our grill and the taste was FANTASTIC!  So easy and not too dry at all. Will definitely make again!

Made these for the first time tonight. My wife and I have been dieting and I’ve been dreading every single meal every night...this one included. Surprisingly we were both super impressed with these burgers. I even told her I’d eat these any day of the week. 5 stars for sure.

These turkey burgers were absolutely amazing! I did make a few alterations; I substituted bread crumbs for crushed Ritz crackers, added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce and a squeeze of my favorite BBQ sauce into the mix, and added a few more seasonings.  But they were so juicy and tasted amazing on the grill. Just make sure to lay down some foil to give them a proper base!

Best turkey burgers ever; added the yolks (why waste?) and the Montreal steak seasoning tip put them over the top!  Thanks for sharing

These turkey burgers have quickly become a family favorite! We use 96% lean ground turkey (the 99% lean was a bit too dry on the grill for our liking). The only minor modifications we made were adding a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the mixture and using 2 whole eggs rather than using just the egg whites. 

To grill:

Oil the grill grates, sear for 2-3 minutes per side then finish on the cooler side of the grill using indirect heat until your thermometer reads 165F - juicy and delicious every time!

Very good. I put cranberry sauce on it because hey, it’s turkey. Kids loved it and joked I should have put stuffing on top too. Maybe next time!

I made this for the first time and it was so good. My daughter who is a picky eater loved them. I will be cooking these burgers over regular beef burgers. Also used leftover for meatloaf.

First time making or eating turkey burgers. Followed exactly but I did have to add extra bread crumbs to get it to hold together and they were great! Even my hubs liked them.

We have never had turkey burgers before, but my family is always open to trying something new. I had two pounds of ground turkey in the freezer, and decided to try these burgers. I did add 1 tsp dry mustard, 2 tbsp. of soy sauce instead of salt, 2 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce, and a little extra garlic as suggested by other reviewers. I used a burger press, and got 7 burgers from the mix. The  mix was very liquidy, and didn't hole together very well, so I cooked them on Reynolds wrap in my Nuwave oven at 375 degrees for 5 minutes per side. The burgers got more solid as they cooked. We all very much enjoyed these burgers. My husband said he was surprised that they were as tasty and moist as they were.  I don't think we will give up our bison burgers, but this is a great change of pace.

Made the recipe as instructed with the exception of adding whole eggs (like one reviewer suggested). The patties did not fall apart as some mention, maybe because after forming the patties I placed them in the fridge to rest (few hours) and soak up the seasonings. Cooked these burgers when family members came home from work and school. Burgers were delicious; this recipe is definitely a keeper in my household.

Very tasty, especially if cooked in a cast iron skillet.
We almost never eat ground turkey because ... well, it's boring ... and why eat a turkey burger when you can have a REAL burger?  So the other day I saw a RR recipe for a "turkey club with a twist" (a club sandwich with a turkey burger instead of sliced turkey) that I wanted to try but knew I needed to put a lot more flavor into the turkey itself and found this recipe.  I wasn't sure about the raw onion ... or the parsley, but I followed the recipe exactly and I am so glad that I did.
In the end I put together toasted white bread, mayo, lettuce, thick slices of tomato, crisp bacon, this turkey burger with melted cheddar and pepper jack ... it was SO GOOD!  (btw if you try this RR puts fresh guacamole on hers ... yuck)
I will absolutely make these again.

I'm going to make some people mad because I changed the recipe.  Sorry...  Thank you to those who post their modifications.  I could tell by the original recipe that it could be improved upon based on my families likes & dislikes, so here goes:   I added Kinder's Organic Buttery Steak Seasoning-- I've discovered this recently & use it on practically all meat.  Also, a few shakes of tabasco, worchestirshire sauce.  Also, 1/4c yellow bell pepper & 1/4 c diced onion.  I absorbed the moisture from bell pepper & onions w/a paper towel to ensure the patties wouldn't fall apart.  I took the the advice of another reviewer & used a whole egg & dusted the patties w/flour to ensure the patties would form--great advice, this worked well!  This one is a keeper.

My picky eater of a man enjoyed this one! (I can't believe it). I adjusted the recipe for one pound of turkey as I am only cooking for two. I added extra bread crumbs, used the whole egg instead of just the whites, a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce, and some flour to both sides of the patties before cooking as someone else mentioned.  I didn't add the onion with the meat though, instead I sautéed them with some mushrooms and garlic and added those on top of the patties once done.  I greased up my BBQ and they held up just fine. They were better than I thought they would be.

My family usually has turkey burgers that my mom makes. Today I really wanted to make dinner for my family today, and my mom thought of turkey sliders. I found that these turkey sliders where delicious!! But my mom and I did tweak somethings in our convince. I used a tablespoon and a half dried parsley, instead of fresh parsley because that was all we had. Then to season the bread crumbs, we added about a tablespoon of Spice Island Organic Garlic & Herb Seasoning. We also used our Griddle Gourmet thing to cook our sliders (which is kind of like a large panini presser, but I'm sure you know what that was anyway), instead of a skillet. Your burgers where so yummy and juicy. Every time we had turkey burgers again, we would use this recipe. My whole family agreed on it. I hope you take my suggestions. It's okay if you don't...... they'll still be delicious. :) Mallory

I made it, and it was great! 
I didn't have all the ingredients, so I substituted some things.
I used a packet of turkey gravy mix to help with seasoning and juiciness.
Also, instead of making patties, I sprayed a large cookie sheet with cooking spray, spread out the turkey burger mix and then covered it with strips of bacon and baked it for the recommended cooking time.
I then cut it into squares to fit on bread (didn't have burger buns lol)
It was a very flavorful, juicy treat that me and my husband both thoroughly enjoyed!

Soooo yummy! I didn’t have a few ingredients so I used garlic powder and onion powder to substitute. Also I made one batch with the egg whites and another (second round) batch without the egg and the second batch was still awesome. I’ve never eaten turkey burger before but now that I have.....I am fully converted. I’ve had issues with ground beef being so fatty and those little gristle pieces in it. By the the end of the meal I have usually picked out all the meat. From this point on I will be buying turkey meat. So delicious and moist. Will be making again soon. Thanks for the recipe!!

Rating it four stars since I added some ingredients. I used Pink Himalayan Salt, Worcestershire and soy sauce, (just a few drops), and a whole egg. I only made enough for four servings. Served them on a whole wheat bun with sweet onion, Romaine lettuce, pickle, mayo and mustard. The BEST Turkey burger I have ever had!

I've made these a few times, but I like to leave the eggs out and add garlic salt & Italian & Cajun spices.  I also substituted The Parsley leaves with celery leaves that I had in my garden. Lastly I cook it over a wood fire pit. Very good!

I added other seasonings because we don't like chopped onions. Hint: use ground turkey with a 93% lean blend...not dry at all!

I've been making turkey burgers since my husband had a heart attack in 2004. This is a good recipe just as it is. I didn't make any changes.

These burgers lived up to their name. They really are "actually delicious." I would have given 5 stars but in the end, they're still just turkey burgers. 4-1/2 would be more accurate. Tasty and best of all, not dried out and falling apart. Juicy and delicious.

I added Worcesteshire, soy sauce , green pepper, whole egg, to the original recipe. I also floured the burgers before I grilled them, and topped them with slice of american cheese, onion,tomato and lettuce with light mayo and some ketchup, didn't miss the beef burgers at all. Delicious

These were good. I added fresh parsley from my garden to them. We broiled them and they stayed together, but I could see where they would fall apart on the grill. A lettuce and tomato slice with the burger on the bun and these were a good, quick Saturday night dinner.

The flavor is good, and they're definitely better than most turkey burgers.  The texture still doesn't have the same "chew" we appreciate from beef, though.  That's to be expected, but it still keeps this from being a 5-star recipe.

I'm not sure what happened with the critical review highlighted above. I've made this recipe dozens of times over the past several years and never had them 'melt' through grill grates. I can only assume they started fussing with the patties before the meat had cooked enough to release and be turned over. Or there was some ill-conceived alteration... you for sure need the binders, the egg and bread crumbs. This is a delicious recipe as written. I'm sure the many suggestions are great. I often season it with dried basil and occasionally with Stacy's hamburger seasoning from this site. I'll grill them or use our indoor/grill griddler. Three pounds of meat makes a lot of patties. If you don't eat them all right away, they freeze and reheat very easily for a nearly instant meal later. Microwave a frozen pattie for, what, a minute or two and it's ready to go on a bun. I've made a lot of AR recipes and this one is easily in my top 10, maybe top 5.

My only changes were that I only used two pounds of turkey, I used the whole eggs and I doubled the garlic (always!). These were the juiciest, tastiest turkey burgers ever. My daughters and I only eat turkey and chicken so believe me when I tell you I've searched for recipes forever.  I got six fatties out of the recipe.

I modified this one as well using 3 tbs. of Worcestershire sauce, the whole eggs and swapped the parsley for basil.  Turned out delicious.  This one's a keeper.

Here's a tip I learned from Martha, pour a quarter cup of oil into a finger bowl to lube your patty making hands as this is a very sticky mixture.

These were very tasty.  I grated the garlic and onion into the mix and cooked them on the stove in a little bit of grapeseed oil.  I made a garlic aioli and served them on a toasted brioche bun.  Will make again.

I have tried eating healthier but WOW I had to work hard to (choke) eat these.   If your expecting something as good as a real beef then don't look at these. Its just bland Turkey loaf on a bun.  I even gave it a good honest try.  The wife wanted ground turkey breast and that was around $8.00 per pound!  So I bought the regular and that was $6.00 and my best Burger beef is chuck 80/20 and makes the best ones.  All they need is salt pepper and an onion on top with melted cheese and what other condiments you might want.  I guess if you like this kind of stuff, more power to you.  The wife didn't even like them and I followed the recipe to the letter.  Oh well. She even claims to like groind Turkey.

This recipe is fantastic.  Like other reiewers, I addeda couple of extras my family likes.  Did the chopped pepper, hot sauce, worchester and soy. I also had a bit of leftover spinach and fresh rosemary from another recipe I was doing so I threw that in too. Spinache made no difference but the rosemary certainly did!!i  Best tip was giving them a very slight coating of flour.  They held together beautifully. . Will make these over and over again. One thing to note as another reviewer pointed out, turkey is bland so don't be afraid to season liberally. Thanks for the keeper!

I'm sorry but turkey will never taste like beef no matter what you do to it. Believe me I've tried. If it's beef it's a burger, any other type of meat or veggie patty and it's a patty.

Yummy!  I added more garlic & also pepper for some kick.  I always like to add diced fresh mushrooms to turkey burgers because they add moisture.  Since ground turkey is so lean,  and they have to be grilled until well done, they can get dry.  For this reason,  ground turkey breast does not do well on the grill for me, so I stick to lean ground turkey, which includes some of the dark meat in the grinding, but is still very low in fat compared to beef burgers.

Made these turkey burgers tonight for my family of five. Thought my kids were not going to like them; however they loved the burgers! My husband also thought they were tasty! This is definitely a good and easy recipe!

Great tasty burger! I try to substitute turkey for hamburger a lot but most of the time it's never as good as the "real" thing. These, however, I enjoyed eating and they didn't make me miss beef. Success! I used dried parsley instead of fresh and added a little garlic and onion powder (in addition to actual onion and garlic). I think it has a good base flavor that could easily go with any sort of toppings. Didn't read the reviews until after I made it. I didn't have any problems with it being dry or bland. I find ground turkey to be very wet. It may depend on the fat content of your ground turkey. I just buy the cheap stuff, not the lean.

Good base recipe. I added green onions, garlic powder, splash of soy sauce and a couple tsp. Worcestshire. Also used a whole egg and dusted with flour to prevent sticking.  Will make again. Thanks!

Really great starter recipe for a turkey burger. There are so many substitutions that can be made or flavors added but this is a wonderful stepping stone to a good meal. I enjoyed it a lot.

These Turkey burgers were delicious.  They were very moist and very flavorful.  I made a few changes similar to what others previously mentioned.  I used a little bit of Worcester, Soy, a whole egg, and a little bit more bread crumbs.  I also floured them before putting them in the pan.  I will definitely be making these again!

Husband who always wants beef loved them. Too goopy to put on grill so I had to use aluminum foil. Next time I will freeze patties first.

Great I've made this multiple times and it's great. I normally only do 4 parties instead of 12 but still great every time. Doing it on the drill can get a little tricky with the patties not being very firm.

Delish!  Having read some reviews I had hubby put them on heavy-duty foil on the grill with some small holes poked in it.  Kept the burger from falling apart, while letting in some of the "grilled" flavor.  I served them with fresh tomatoes, fresh basil and fresh mozzarella with a balsamic reduction glaze.  I'll never grill a beef burger again.

I made this last night to enjoy for the week.  It was a really good choice with first time sautéing cabbage w/ carrots and a loaded "baked" potato on the side.  I used the whole egg so it wasn't wasted.  Moist but delicious and I baked them for about 45 mins covered with foil.

Love these turkey burgers as do my husband and 4 year old twins!  I never deviate too far from the recipe although I freehand the amounts and find the recipe pretty forgiving.  I can't wait to try some of the other suggestions like Liquid Smoke and worcestershire  sauce.  I will add they they freeze really well if you layer between pieces of parchment paper.

I added more garlic and some freshly shaved parmesan cheese. They came out amazing. 

Tip: i rubbed some olive oil on both sides of the patties to prevent any sticking and burning

Yum! I put these on whole wheat flat bread rounds with tahini dressing and smoked gouda and romaine lettuce. I added diced green peppers to the turkey because I had some that I needed to use up. These are quick and easy to make! I will be making them again for sure! I'm tired of beef burgers because they make me feel weighed down.  These are healthier but still delicious!

Grilled the burgers!  Awesome!  Added more garlic, salt and pepper.  Secret for grilling is to coat  the burgers and grill with a little olive oil.  Preheat the grill to medium.  Put the burgers on and DON'T touch them for 5 minutes, cap it, THEN flip them for another 3 minutes.  ALSO don't work the meat  too much.

Good recipe.  I added a little Worcestershire sauce to give it a little more flavor.  Make the burgers thick and cook them slow on the grill — it makes for a juicier burger.

My husband and son (both beef lovers) really liked these.  I did take some suggestions and added Worcestershire sauce, add the whole egg  and dredged them in flour before cooking.  They did not fall apart on the grill.

I planned on making this as written for lunch, but when I got to the store they were out of ground turkey so I got ground beef instead. I decided to add some Parmesan, Worcestershire sauce and Italian seasoning as I was using beef. These were really tasty, though now I had made quite a different patty to the original recipe. I love turkey so I am sure the original recipe is just as tasty and plan on making it the next time the store has ground turkey in stock again.

Yum! I didn't have breadcrumbs or eggs this morning when I was making.  So, for the binding, I mixed together 2t of ground flax seed with 2T of water, poured about half in.  Next time, I may try to mix in almond flour in place of the breadcrumbs, but I didn't think of that until too late.  :)

Also, I was blown away by the sugar content of the grocery store hamburger buns, so we made our own.  I was surprised by how easy this was (and how delicious they tasted)!  And, I was so grateful to not be giving my family unnecessary extra sugar. If you have some time, perhaps consider some reading about what the scientists have begun to learn about sugar and the way our bodies process it. Oh my.

Thank you so much for the recipe!

I made zero changes and used dried parsley. My red meat loving husband couldn't believe how much he loved them! We put guac on top and ate without a bun. So good.

Used a Foreman grill for this recipe and it turned out super delish!! Added a little extra for flavor enhancement based on other reviews. A few kicks of Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, brown mustard, extra minced garlic and seasoning salt. Also, used two WHOLE eggs for good binding. 
Everyone, even picky kids, loved them. Went back for seconds. Thanks!!

These were delicious!  I will make them again.  I sprinkled some "less sodium" Old Bay to these burgers.  My husband loved them and thought it taste like a good old fashion hamburger.

I didn't have real eggs on hand, so I used a little less than the equivalent to two eggs of liquid egg substitute. I chopped three green onions instead of a yellow or white onion. Finally, I cracked fresh white peppercorns (my family doesn't like ground black pepper). The result was a winner with my family asking me to make it this way from now on!

This is a really good, basic turkey burger recipe.  I make it "as is" and my family loves them!  In fact, I think they prefer them to beef burgers, which is great because they're less fatty.   I usually cook them on the grill and they come out terrific.

I used 2.5lbs of ground  turkey with all the seasonings measurements the same. I used a heaping tbsp of dry parsley in place of fresh and then added tsp red pepper flakes and tbsp of worcestershire. Cooked on the grill, searing first. They were moist and excellent!! Family  loved them. .Don't over cook. They're done before you know it

This is our go to turkey burger recipe.  It is delicious!  The only change I make is omitting parsley (simply because I didn't have it on hand the first time).

Made it on a grill pan.  Had no fresh parsley, but did add a splash of low sodium soy.  All else as written.  The soy must have been what caused the dark glaze, but they did not taste burnt and were the juiciest I've ever made.  I guess it was the egg whites which was the only new thing I added.  Thanks! (I am wondering why my burgers didn't look as white as in the pic. I used Jennie-O ground turkey. Just curious...)

Trying to cut back on red meat so I thought I would try these turkey burgers. Used a whole egg and added a few drops of low sodium soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Pan fried them but they stayed moist and tender. Used all white, breast meat. They were good on a bun with lettuce and tomato and on top of a salad the next day.  Will make again.

Way to keep us from missing beef! So moist and yummy.

Minimal Changes:
Only made two 1/4 pound burgers
Added 1/2t soy sauce & 1/2t Worcestershire 
Subbed green onion for regular 
Subbed scrunched croutons for bread crumbs
Used most of both yolk and white of one egg
Crumbled some Havarti into the concoction

Baked up some fries and had a fantastic supper.

Loved these!!! Followed the recipe exactly minus using half the meat.... Turned out great. I also lightly flowered the outside of the burgers so they stayed together when flipped (per someone's suggestion). Also added a but of red pepper flakes for spice and lemon zest. These were delicious!

The only change I made was doubling the garlic, but this recipe is the best one I've used. Thank you!

These burgers turned out fantastic. Moist and delicious. My wife was truly impressed and my culinary skills aren't all that. I substituted a tablespoon of cilantro paste in lieu of parsley which gave the burgers a nice brightness to them too.

These made the best turkey burgers we've eaten.  I love that it made a lot.  I froze the extras for another day.  I did adopt some other commenters' suggestions and a couple of my own.  I used 2 Tbs. soy sauce (instead of the salt), 4 tsp. dried parsley (instead of fresh), dried garlic (instead of minced), and added Worcestershire sauce, an extra egg, and bumped up the Italian seasoned dry breadcrumbs to 3/4 cups.  Seriously delicious!

I now have this recipe memorized, as I've made it 3 times in the last 3 weeks, as requested by my husband.  This and sweet potato fries, and we don't have to feel so guilty about burger night.

I loved the flavour of these -- I added more garlic, and also some sriracha and soy sauce. I would've given it a 5 except that when I went to form patties I tried putting them between parchment paper and then they wouldn't come off!! So I had to reform them into patties after scraping them off. My advice is to make the patties right before you plan to cook them. They were so tasty they didn't even need cheese on them--just mayo, bbq sauce, lettuce and tomato! Yum!

Forget the onion; the parsley and fresh garlic makes them, so don't skimp.  Add a few dashes of salt.  It's okay to make less: 1.2 lbs of turkey made 4 burgers.  Skillet was the way to go!!  Next time I will substitute ground, dried mushrooms for the bread crumbs to make it lower carb ;)

I've made this recipe several times.  It far improves any of the other turkey burger recipes I had tried.  It is excellent as it is but after the first few times, I modified it with extra onion (about double, finely minced) and used cayenne pepper instead of black pepper.  Once I used Lowry's seasoned salt in place of the regular salt.  It is delicious as written and even better IMHO with the modifications. Mix it in the morning and cook for dinner.  The burgers fall apart easily if not made hours ahead of time.  Same flavor, just easier to flip as a whole burger.

Delicious. Took the advice from other reviews. Added some bell pepper and soy sauce. The bell pepper really helped with keeping the patty nice and moist. 
Will be making these again. Maybe use Worcestershire sauce too.

I made this recipe with a slight adjustment. I sautéed the onion plus some minced mushrooms (which adds some moisture). I used the egg white without the yoke & did not find that the burgers fell apart. They were fine & very moist. Usually ground turkey tends to be on the dry side. These were great. It will be my go-to recipe!

Amazing!! I followed the first reviewers tips by adding Worcesteshire  sauce, seasoning salt, and soy sauce. Then, we fixed ours on the grill and wrapped it with lettuce instead of buns.. I put American cheese, ketchup, mustard, and mayo on mine and it was AMAZING! So much flavor. I will definitely make this again.

They tasted really good, but I needed to use a lot more breadcrumbs to get the meat to hold together. I don't know if it was just that the ground turkey was extra soft or what, though.

Yes it is very good but I added a packet of sodium free beef granular, more garlic, made my own breadcrumbs with a organic whole grain bread with Italian seasoning. I also added some Weber Chicago steak seasoning. Fresh ground black pepper.

I made this and adjusted it just a bit.  I only used 2 pounds and added liquid smoke, Worcester shire,  soy sauce and red peppers and only used 1 full egg.  It turned out great. to keep it healthy I used guacamole as a condiment and my kids loved it.  I'll definitely make this one again

Pretty good.  I mixed the breadcrumbs with milk before adding it to the turkey to keep it moist.  Grilled it like I would a beef burger.  Delish!

These were delicious!  I added a little Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce like another reviewer had suggested.  I cooked them in a skillet, and topped them with cheddar cheese.  Very good! Even my picky eaters liked them.  I recommend this recipe!

I made this recipe last night for my boyfriend and myself and it turned out great! Because my boyfriend is allergic to beef I have to find alternatives to many classic recipes and this has been one of my favorites. I used cilantro instead of the parsley and it worked perfectly!

Boring, needs flavor. Turkey burgers are bland so they need some flavor added. I tried this recipe but am going back to my favorite which includes Greek seasoning and feta cheese mixed with the burgers before forming the patty.

I have used ground turkey as a substitute for beef in so many of my recipes, as my fiancé cannot have red meats very much due to his high blood pressure. I have even made turkey meatloaf a few times with praise from my fiance. However, turkey burgers seem to get a bad rep for not being as good as beef burgers.  Given the rating on this recipe, I decided to give it a try.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and I have to say the turkey burger's bad rep still stands.  Even though I used the seasonings in the recipe, it didn't have a very good flavor, and wasn't as juicy as a beef burger is.  I guess if you are expecting it to taste as good as a beef burger, that is where the flaw is, because it tastes nothing like it.

This recipe was very easy especially for myself who rarely cooks. This was my first endeavor making turkey burgers and it went amazingly well. I added 8 oz of plain applesauce (2 4oz snack cups) to keep the burgers moist. They do not taste sweet if you're concerned about that. I know the recipe says it makes 12 burgers but I got 15 decent sized burgers out of this recipe. Definitely will be a go to from now on.

Totally bland. If you don't overcook they are not dry. I cooked on grill about 7 minutes per side. I did not add the parsley so maybe that would have helped slightly improve the flavor. Next time I might try some Lawry's Seasoned salt or cajun seasoning. These definately need a little help. Still on my quest for a tasty turkey burger. My mother has high cholesteral and blood pressure and so she tries not to eat red meat burgers at our BBQ.

Flavor ok but needed more!  I read the reviews too late.  I should have added worteschire sauce and soy sauce and a whole egg instead of just whites.  They need more bread crumbs for sure.  I grilled them on non stick foil and they still stuck like crazy.

Very tasty! Best one yet. I halved the recipe for 2 with leftovers.
Like others, I added a several shakes of Worcestershire sauce, and a couple shakes of soy sauce. Superb!

I added some gorgonzola cheese to the mixture and actually used only 1 lb of ground turkey to the other ingredients here and they were very tasty.  I think 3 lbs of turkey with the same add ins would be bland.

I loved this recipe, I used ground chicken instead of ground turkey and it tasted delicious! I also used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1, I think it really helped with the flavor (next time I will use 3 cloves). I fried them in a pan, the burgers were moist and held together.

I followed the recipe as written and honestly, I simply did not find that these burgers had much taste... it was even hard to taste the turkey itself.  It was just very bland.

Tried this recipe today and it was delicious. I prefer turkey over beef but my family doesn't but they really liked this. After I cooked the burger I put some cranberry chutney and spinach into the bun and it was really good. Definitely a new favourite!

Another way to combat dryness is to add a little water (until only half of the patty is out of the water). This keeps them moist throughout. Very good recipe!

Really good recipe. If you decide to grill them though, make sure to spray the grill with pam. Turkey burgers are very tender and tend to fall apart easily.

Great burger! Try using herb stuffing for bread crumbs. Also made different toppings such as pesto mayonaise to customise burgers. Enjoy

Love it!
Over time I have tweaked it to my own liking. 
Ie. removing salt adding seasoning instead, 
Removing egg white and adding 2 extra cloves of garlic
And finally adding diced mushrooms for moisture

These were great! I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so i looked up a recipe to substitute. It made lots so i made some burgers for supper and baked the rest in a loaf for baby food. The Baby also loves it :)

OMG! These are/were so good that when I ate the leftovers I pretty much ate them by themselves! I am really impressed with these. The flavor is great and the texture is such that it is actually hard to tell from real hamburger compared to these (at least for me it's hard to tell). Definitely going to make these again!

Wow. Kinda tasted just like a hamburger when i had all the toppings on it. I added a bit of oats because i thought they were too sloppy, and i added Worcesters sauce on top just before throwing on a pan because i think it makes it more burger-like and burger color!

Great recipe....with a slight mod. I added green and red peppers, as well as a cream cheese and raspberry mixture on the bun. The sweetness of the raspberry heightened the burgers' flavor. So good!

I followed this recipe, and tried to grill the burgers. The patties were so flimsy that they broke apart on the grill. Much of the meat sagged between the grates of my grill, so I won't be doing that again. My family loved the burgers though. ;-)

So yummy! I used 1 pound of turkey and did my best to use a third of everything. I still used two egg whites and then added some extra bread crumbs to hold them together. I also used dry minced onion instead.

Yay! I gave this recipe 4 stars because it turned out delicious even though I had to make several tweaks (lack of ingredients) and eyeball the ingredients because I only wanted to make one burger. 

As suggested by the the other reviewers, I also added a couple shakes of Worchestershire and soy sauce, used garlic powder instead of garlic. I wouldn't mistake it for a beef burger, but it was good for what it was!

These are great!  We are trying to cut down on eating so much beef.  I made these turkey burgers as my husband loves turkey.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, but other than that followed the recipe.  They do freeze well as I made some and froze them for later meals and they came out fine.

Really good!  Made on George Foreman grill with added red pepper.  Could do with a bit more kick for spice.  Liked that the onions retained a bit of crunch.

This recipe was passed on to me by my friend from work with the following changes.  Add 1 TBSP Worcestershire and 1 1/2 tsp liquid smoke plus added an extra garlic clove.  Let sit for 1 hr before forming patties. Grilled on George Foreman grill for 3 minutes.  For buns I sprayed "I can't believe it's not butter" spay onto 1 side of each piece of sliced sourdough bread and sprinkled with garlic salt.  Grilled buttered side on a flat non-stick pan. It's like a eating a burger from a restaurant.  My teenage sons and hubby say this is a keeper and asked me to make it again soon!

good flavor with the addition of dijon with white wine mustard, soy, worcestershire, seasoning salt instead of reg salt, hickory liquid smoke, leaving out the garlic, and using goldfish cheddar crackers as sub for bread crumbs.

I made this tonight for dinner, and I think they were delicious! Even my husband (that is not fan of anything with turkey), love it! Very easy, fast and no fancy ingredients that you don't have on hand. As every burger, you get to pick your toppings and we used pepper jack cheese and slice avocado and tomatoes. Definetely will be adding this to our regular menu. Thank you so much for sharing.

I cut this recipe to a third of the original amount, followed it to a T, and my husband and I agree that the result was the best turkey burgers we ever had eaten.  They were so moist!  A keeper!

This was really good. I added Cavender's seasoning to the meat mixture and sprinkled a light coating of the Montreal Steak Seasoning to the tops of the burgers as they cooked. To preserve the tenderness of the burgers and maintain juiciness, as they came out of the skillet, I loosely covered them in foil and put them in the oven. Mine was already hot from roasting sweet potatoes/onions but I turned it down to 325 and they stayed nice and juicy for the 10-15 min or so before serving them. I would definitely make them again.

This was my first time cooking ground turkey for my husband and he wasn't feeling good about it! He loves beef burgers and figured turkey would be bland but not these patties! Full of flavour and he actually asked if I would make them again.

I liked this recipe a lot but I gave it four stars instead of five because I made some modifications.
I'm trying to eat as healthy and and flavorful as I possibly can so here's what I did.
3lbs turkey
1/2 diced red pepper
1 clove garlic
1/4 cup parsley
1/4 cup onion
1/8 cup thyme
1/8 cup sage
I sautéed the pepper and onion for a couple of minutes in a little EVOO then added the garlic(don't cook the garlic for more than a minute or it will burn)
I mixed all that in the ground turkey with one whole brown egg along with the parsley, safe, and thyme.
I hand mixed it all up and formed (8) 1/2 inch thick, 5 inch wide patties and cooked them on my griddle until beautiful, brown grill marks formed.
I served these on lettuce instead of buns with homemade Greek yogurt ranch dressing and tomatoes. 
As a side I baked sweet potato "fries" and steamed broccoli.

The 180 degree temperature is too high.  For turkey, 165 degrees is recommended.

These are the best turkey burgers I've ever had! This is the first time I've ever eaten one and not missed and not missed eating a real one. If you want them to be even better, throw them on the grill like I did!

This is by far the BEST turkey burger I have ever had! I have made it twice....first time was as recommended but added Worcestershire Sauce and sautéed onions, and the second time I replaced the fresh parsley with dried cilantro and again added Worcestershire Sauce).  Both were juicy and flavorful! Oh and some fresh baby spinach leaves instead of lettuce....BANG! Kudos to the chef(s).

Love them! But added basil instead of parsley. And i agree with the previous post, too wet to grill.
My adut kids sais they were the best i have ever made! I also used 85 percent ground beef instead of turkey.
I also used a hamburger patty maker to make them. They hold together better. $5. On Amazon.

I make turkey burgers all the time and they're delicious!  All you need to add to the turkey is a shredded zucchini and if you want, you can add a bit of shredded onion.  The zucchini makes all the difference in whether it's dry or not.

The actual recipe is generous with the salt but skimpy on the onion and garlic.  If you add both eggs it would add more moisture.

I first tried this about eight years ago. So glad i did. This is the only burger recipe we use. Hubby didn't even know it was turkey. Not everyone will convert to turkey only, but just try this.

Made these last night.. delicious and easy! Even my picky son who eats NOTHING ate 2 of these burgers. I did add a splash of both worcheshire (sp?) and soy sauce. Also instead of minced garlic and onion I used powdered versions since my son isn't a fan of "chunks". Also used dried parsley instead of fresh. Before pan frying, I lightly coated each burger with some additional bread crumb just to help hold together as well as for a bit of texture. Used a whole egg also rather than just egg white. They were super easy to make, juicy and delicious. Didn't even really need any condiments, they were that good. Will definitely make again.

Wow! These were really delicious! I used this recipe to teach me how to make turkey burgers but added a few more ingredients: Greek yogurt, and a dash of turmeric in addition to being too lazy to separate the yolk from the whites. I also baked these at 375 degrees for 30 mins (Turning halfway through)instead of pan frying. These were extremely moist and ended up being a huge hit. I suggest serving them over mixed greens with some tomato, avocado, cashews and your favorite dressing. Thanks for the wonderful starter recipe!

Amazing!! Never thought I would eat a turkey burger over a beef burger, but these are very flavorful. Made the recipe as listed, but did add a dab of low sodium soy sauce and worcestershire sauce for extra flavor.  Also as other reviewers stated, I dipped my burgers in flour to help hold them together while frying and crisp.  Will and have made again and again.

I've made these a few times now and we absolutely love them. It's a good alternative to beef burgers. Even my husband that has never liked turkey burgers loves them. I like to put different types of cheeses to change up the flavors!

These were really good. A little oniony for my taste, but they were a hit at my Superbowl party. I made them into little sliders. Everyone compared them to Crystal or WhiteCastle burgers. I would make again for another gathering.

I followed the recipe just as it is, with minor changes: used 2 tbsp dried parsley instead of fresh, added one finely diced red bell pepper, 2 cloves of garlic, and topped with mozzarella cheese. They were DELICIOUS!! My boys, who are 11 and 6 years old, LOVED them!!

I have never been a fan of turkey burgers, always finding them dry and flavorless.  This recipe surprised me.  I sauteed the onion and green pepper first, then added to the mix.  I also used some seasoning salt, and Worchestershire sauce.  Ate them on a kaiser roll with melted cheese, tomato, and lettuce.  Very good!  I would make again.  Hubby even liked them.

This was amazing! The family loved 'em too. What a hit. Tried many turkey burgers before and they always came out dry or unflavorful. These were just the opposite. Personally, I don't like parsley so I substituted italian seasoning and the bread crumbs were italian flavored as well. Delicious!

These were flavorful and moist. This was my first turkey burger and I kept expecting the consistency of a hamburger, but then got used to its unique taste. They were a little on the soft side but not mushy. I would try these again.

Very good. I left out the onion and garlic, and instead seasoned with soy sauce, worcestershire, Tapatio hot sauce, thyme, rosemary and pepper. I used fresh breadcrumbs that I seasoned with Italian seasoning. Fryed them on the stove about 4-5 minutes each side. They were juicy and flavorful.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  I made a few changes, myself - I fried the burgers in extra light Olive Oil, and I put two blocks of cheddar cheese in the middle.  Once you see the cheese oozing out, look out, Mama!!

'Actually' Delicious Turkey Burgers... strange name but they are 'actually' delicious, as it implies. Although, it also implies you wouldn't expect them to be. But cast all your doubts aside. These are delicious and the only changes I made were using shallots instead of onions, since that's what I had on hand.

ty so much aussiemum1 for your input.. almost used your cheat to the T.. here's what we did diff.. still was able to get away with just the egg whites.. but used the george foreman grill so that's probably why we didn't have any problems .. had to substitute cilantro for parsley.. quadrupled the pepper.. but felt it could have used some more.. bf suggested that maybe chopping some jalapeno into it could have helped.. also shook the tapatio sauce a couple of times over it.. i'm not one for salt.. but i used the full amount and felt it needed just a bit more.. loved the starting point either way

Absolutely delicious!! I added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, and used a whole egg instead of just the white, and they were AWESOME! I added a slice of cheese on a few of them also. The burgers held together well, despite what others were saying.

I found this recipe and have been making it for years.  I can always count on the burgers turning out moist and flavorful.  Recipe also works for meatballs, which I bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  Thanks for sharing!

I am not a fan of turkey burgers, but these converted me. My 9 year-old liked them and said he'd eat them again, so I will definitely make again. I added some Worcesteshire and a little more garlic and was glad I did. I used 2 whole medium eggs and had no problem with them falling apart on the George Foreman grill.  I'm going to try this again as meatballs and add some grated zucchini or carrot.

Good and simple recipe! I substitute in some oatmeals instead of breadcrumbs, and put in many dried herbes including thymes so the patties stick. I serve them to my mother in a healthy protein style using lettuce to wrap them instead of buns and she loves it!

The first time I made these, they needed a bit more spice, although juicy.  The second time I made these I added 1 Tbs of A1 and 1 Tbs of steak sauce and a bit of gouda cheese.  Much better after the add ons.  Thanks for a great starter recipe!

So good! I waited until my husband had heated the grill & was ready to put food on it before telling him they were turkey burgers. He loved them! I used wheat germ because I had no bread crumbs. Used dried parsley also because that was all I had. The only addition I made was adding a small can of fire roasted diced green chiles to the mix. I also very lightly brushed uncooked patties with oil so they didn't stick to grill.

I gave it three stars because my kids liked them.  I do not know what I did but they all just fell apart.  I did not alter recipe as others had, maybe I should have.  I started on the grill and lost much of it to the bottom.  My husband could not finish his burger, my daughter ate it.  I had to choke mine down.  This is the first recipe I will be deleting in my recipe box.

Never thought a turkey burger would taste so good and actually not fall apart on the grill..... They were delicious!!!! I added a little Worcestershire sauce and oregano for extra flavor. So much flavor, especially adding fresh veggies, you couldn't even tell the difference. LOVED IT!! :)

OMG! So good. But I took the advice of some other reviewers. Added about 1/2 cup of red bell pepper, some soya sauce, some liquid smoke, 10 pulls off the Worcestershire, extra garlic, seasoning salt, extra parsley (not fresh),...and I took the advice of one reviewer that said to dip the patties in flour and then beat off the excess. I had never heard of this. I tried it! WOW! Doing this with all burgers. Got nice and crispy on the outside and didn't stick to the grill without any oil/pam! AMAZING. I made some authentic guacamole to put on the burgers, with havarti and tomatoes and lettuce. So good. Definitely a keeper. We keep making turkey burgers and every time they're better. Can't see them getting any better than this! I win the battle with my husband! ;) Oh yeah, i should mention I used garden flavour breton crackers instead of breadcrumbs! maybe that is the secret!

Great recipe!  I don't like turkey burgers, so I was worried about the flavour, while trying to eat healthy.  So, I added a few shakes of sage, thyme, cayenne pepper, and Montreal Steak Spice, followed by a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  It did the trick.  I served the burger with guacamole(taken from Bob Cody's Guacamole recipe on this site) and some basic yellow mustard.  I loved it!  The kids liked the burger,but because they don't like avocado, I skipped avocado on their burgers.  No complaints, though.

I tricked my husband with these burgers.  He thought they were beef at first.  I had to laugh at that one.  But, seriously, these are delicious and I will make them again and again.  I do not like ground beef, my husband loves burgers and this is the perfect way to make us both happy.  Thanks for sharing.

Oh my God, sooooooo good! I took advice from others to add  a few drops of hickory seasoning liquid smoke, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and add a small, plastic package of soy sauce, leftover from a Chinese restaurant. I cant believe how good they turned out, this one is a keeper, thanks so much :)

pretty good! We added mushrooms, red onions, italian seasoning, 2 whole eggs, 2-3 tablespoons of soy sauce in addition to the ingredients.   Needs some salt actually to give it a little flavor.  Overall yummy, healthy and lean! Next time we'll make meatballs and burgers.

My husband loved these. He almost passed out after he ate the first one. I used Italian seasoning because I didn't have fresh parsley and garlic croutons. Also he put in a whole egg when he got home and said it didn't taste "yolky." He also added his favorite seaoning, Adobo on the 2nd batch we made. Delicious, will definitely make again!

Best Turkey Burger ever! I've already made this several times. It really hits the spot if you're in the mood for a good burger, and as an added bonus, much healthier than the typical beef burger!
Yummy!!

These are *really* good. I cut down on the salt by about half (just what I do in almost everything) and I omit the onions (one son hates them and it's easy enough for everyone else to add). I think using them as called for would be even better. But the burgers are very flavorful and very moist - even when cooked on my George Foreman grill. I use only a few of turkey burger recipes all of which I have had to adjust to make perfect...except this one - it's good just as it is. Thank you!

Yummy, first time making a burger.   Since I didn't have breadcrumbs, I used Wheat Germ instead.  I also left out the eggs.   Eggs and I just don't get along.  Given that, the patties did not fall apart.  I used a light coat of flour as insurance and then plopped it in an oiled grill pan.  The burger did poof up a bit, I should have used an iron press to make  it flatter, but once it was in my tummy, it was all good.   It almost tasted like a beef burger.  :)

This is a very good recipe using an alternative to beef.  I only had ground chicken and used a small amount of onion soup mix instead of chopped onions.  Very tastey and much healthier than a yraditional burger.

This recipe is rated a 1 because when I tried forming the pattie it fell apart.  The only thing I didn't add was the onion, but that has nothing to do with the pattie staying together.

These were amazing!  So much flavor.  The only changes I made was to use shallots in place of onion and added 1 1/2 eggs with yolk.  So easy and tasty.

I signed up just to rate this recipe. It really is "actually delicious!" I use about half of Lawry's Seasoned Salt instead of regular table salt. I also throw in some cayenne. Overall this recipe makes one of the best burgers I've ever had and it is turkey.

This was surprisingly delicious. I have never had a turkey burger before but I loved it. I substituted sauted green scallions instead of regular onion and sprinkled the burgers the cajun spice. I put blue cheese crumbles and sauted mushroom on top of home made rolls. I will make them again. Thanks

FABULOUS!!! Although, I've only ever used the recipe with ground lamb to make lamb burgers. Insanely amazing. I'd say I'm a little more generous in serving size with almost all the ingredients... Try it with lamb people! It's amazing!!!!

add thyme, marjoram and a little Montreal steak seasoning - came out fantastic!  I don't typically make turkey burgers, but it was juicy and flavorful, and really easy!

Surprisingly good. I made exactly as is with the exception of adding shredded cheddar cheese before taking off the grill. Served with corn and edamame.

These are my favorite turkey burgers. I've tried a few recipe's but either the mixture was pure mush or they had no flavor. The mixture is soft and I did have problems with it sticking to the pan, so gentle scraping and flipping is needed. The flavor made up for that hassle!

Can't say I followed the recipe perfectly cause I didn't measure, dumped everything in the food processor and got everything mixed together.  Put them on the grill and they turned out wonderful moist and delicious.

This burger was so delicious!  I only had 1-1/4 lb. of ground turkey breast so I cut the recipe in 1/2.  The only difference I made was to add 1 TBS. worsteshire.   I cooked the patties with Pam in a frypan and topped each with a slice of reduced fat cheddar.  Easy, fast and so yummy!

Very good turkey burgers!  I added a little of McCormicks Montreal Chicken Seasoning and grilled them on the BBQ.  The family loved it.

It is actually delicious! I have made these burgers 4 times since I first read this recipe 3 months ago. Everyone in my family really likes them. I go with what the first reviewer "AUSSIEMUM1" suggests, but I cut my recipe in half. I serve them with burger buns or english muffins, but usually I put mine on a bed of lettuce with some thinly sliced onions, sliced grape or cherry tomatoes and a little Good Seasons Italian dressing, trying to cut out some carbs.

These were very good!  Surprisingly moist.  I will definitely make them again!  I didn't have parsley so I omitted it.  I also used plain breadcrumbs.  I usually make beef burgers so I was surprised at how little these shrunk in comparison.  Great recipe!

Superb! I quartered the recipe for me and my husband, and it was perfect. I did add a few splashes of Worchester Sauce and Soy Sauce, and a little extra bread crumbs. OH YEAH, and grating the onion was a fantastic idea... highly recommend it.

YES!!!  They actually are good turkey burgers.  I made these for a family get together and they were a big hit.  Everyone loved them.  I quadrupled the recipe and didn't have enough garlic so added a little pinch of garlic powder.  I didn't have fresh parsley so used half the called for amount of dried parsley and added some ginger root (about 1 tsp for a single recipe).  And just used 2 whole eggs for the quadrupled batch. So yummy.

These were really good. The only change I made was I left out the parsely only because I was out and didn't want to make a trip to the store for it.

These are very good!!! The only changes I made were becasue I found that 3 lbs. of meat was alot for our family. I did 1.25 lbs of turkey while still adding the same amounts of the other ingredients on the exeception of only using 1 egg. They were GREAT!!! I added this to my own recipie box here at home and will use it again and again. Thanks!!!

I recently made this and loved it! Only thing i did differently was add 2 tbsp of soy sauce and Sriracha hot chili sauce. They were super moist and very flavorful.  I cooked them on the grill which i lined with aluminum foil to keep them from sticking and falling apart, it worked wonderfully. Served on wheat buns with light potato salad and delicious!

Seriously, the best turkey burgers I've ever made or had, YUM. I followed the recipe exactly except for used regular breadcrumbs and dried parsley as that was what we had on hand. My husband out liquid smoke on his and was very happy as well.

Good basic recipe.  Now that fresh herbs are in the garden add a handful of your favorites (I like oregano, thyme, and parsley). Adds flavor and moisture. Also I agree with others that some worcestershire helps.

I made these to recipe substiting "egg beaters southwestern style" for the egg whites, added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper and it was fabulous. The only thing I had a problem with was getting the temp up to 180F w/o burning them.. I had the heat up very high and it was all I could do to hit 160. I think maybe I had them too thick:) but I love them like that:).. Thanks,

A good burger. Next time I will grate the onion instead of dicing it to get it smaller- I tried chopping it finely but the pieces were too large and crunchy. I also subbed cilantro for the parsley because I prefer it, and added a little Worcestershire and hot sauce to the mix. Served with cheddar cheese on top and BBQ sauce.

very good. I realized I was out of onions, so used onion powder - also didn't have fresh parsley so I was afraid that they would be super dry without those fresh ingredients, but they were not. Very squishy when making them and fell apart a bit on the grill, but not really a problem.

These were ok. I only made 4(1lb of turkey) and it was a little bland, needed a tad more salt for my taste. I didn't have seasoned breadcrums, just regular so added about half a teaspoon of mrs.dash to the mix, and i'm also trying to cut down on the fat so used fake eggs(what i call them, but they're really just egg whites i think) instead of the whole egg. I also didn't have fresh parsley so used about a teaspoon of dried, same goes for garlic, used 1/4ts. It was pretty good, but again a little bland for my taste. It wasn't dried out, yet not super moist either. I cooked in my George Foreman grill on low-med(i can adjust the temp) for about 8mins.

Well, I thought it tasted like a pretty standard turkey burger. That is to say that it was nothing overly terrible, but at the same time, it wasn't to good either.

This is the second time I've tried making turkey burgers and this recipe is so much better than the very first recipe I tried years ago.  When I thought the patties were done, I realized that they still needed a couple of more minutes, so I threw the lid on the skillet (for fear of drying them out) and they turned out moist.  I think this recipe is a great base to start out with.  I plan to play around with it by adding a few other ingredients to make this perfect for us!

I tried the Italian seasoned ground turkey from Jennie-O with this recipe and added green chili, low-fat pepper jack cheese and a low fat mayo and chipotle peppers in adobe as a sauce. Serve on the Oro-Wheat 100 calorie thin sandwich buns. It is delicious!

I was a bit leery about these burgers as the ingredients are deceptively basic and plain. I was amazed however at the amount of flavor these burgers held!  I would (and have been) recommending these burgers for anyone who want a healthier alternative to beef. An A+ recipe. I can't wait to try them on the grill this summer!

These make really good turkey burgers. They are very moist and have great flavor. I just add a half teaspoon of Adobo Seasoning to give a little more flavor. YUM-O

These were actually really good! I accidentley bought some ground turkey & didn't know what to do with it so I gave this a try. I only had a pound & a half of meat so I used the same ingredients but I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it. I also added a few splashes of soy sauce & worschisier sauce (however you spell it) & then the tiniest drop of hickory flavored liquid smoke & a few shakes of steak seasoning as some other reviewers had mentioned. I also added 2 cloves of garlic rather than 1 cause I love it! I formed my burgers then put them in the fridge until dinner time to help hold them together. I grilled these on my george forman grill & served with american cheese, red onion & lettace. My turkey hating hubby was so not looking forward to trying these, but once we tried them they were actually pretty darn good! He said if I didn't tell him it was turkey he wouldn't have even known!! Now I can make turkey burgers on occasion as a healthier alternative to beef! Next time I think I'm going to chop up some fresh mushrooms & mix that in & serve with swiss cheese that sounds delish! Thanks for the surprisingly great recipe, we really enjoyed it :)

Excellent recipe. Simple but yummy. I also use this recipe for turkey meatloaf and meatballs. I think I'll add a packet of Goya Sazon next time for a bit of a change and to add a little zip.

I didn't have bread crumbs, but 1/4 cup of old fashioned oats processed to a fine crumb worked beautifully.  I baked these in the oven at 325 degrees until a light golden brown. These are actually delicious indeed!  You will have good luck with this recipe - especially if you remember to use the regular ground turkey, not turkey breast.

These were actually really good (coming from someone who's not a huge ground turkey fan). Made 2 batches and used one for meatballs. Served them in cream of chicken soup over mashed potatoes. Yum!

Tried this one tonight and they were very moist even got my husband to try them and he ate 2.  I would use this one again and again.  Next time will be stepping it up a little with other spices.  I used panko bread crumbs and they worked great.

Very versatile recipe. I made 1/3 of the recipe using 1 whole egg and about 1/4 cup breadcrumbs. Couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce, some dry 'onion soup' mix, lots of fresh garlic and parsley ... We had ourselves a wonder dinner, one that we'll have quite often in this house!

Amazing great recipe!  However, instead of the original print mine!  Its is 10,000 times better.  Instead of ground turkey I used filet and skipped the bun.  I used the parsley as a garnish and salted the mashed potatoes i made with it.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used some fresh rolls as an appetizer.  Made a hollandaise from scratch for the filet.  Add some fresh asparagus.  Place filet on asparagus and potatoes, drizzle with hollandaise and it makes for a fantastic turkey burger!  Enjoy!!!

Very good recipe for Turkey burgers.  The last ones I tried fell apart while cooking them, but the egg and bread crumbs held them together very nicely.  I had a poblano pepper left over, so I chopped that up and mixed it in with the onion and parsley.  Delicious!

This is our family's turkey burger of choice.  I have made it several times and it always turns out perfect.  First time, I follwed directions to the "T".  I have also done them with chopped green pepers and chopped fresh or even canned mushrooms in the 'mix'.  I never separate my egg.  I use egg white and yolk.  It's yummy!  Can't remember the last time I have made a real beef burger.

Great recipe.  We didn't find the burgers dry at all.  I coated the patties in a little bit of flour to help keep them from sticking to the grill.  Could try adding some enhancements but this is a great basic burger recipe.

Very tasty and moist!  I followed other reviewers as well - used only 1 egg, 1/2 tsp smoke flavor, 1/2 tsp worcestire, 1/2 tsp tamari... made on the Foreman and turned out 10 very delicious patties.  Definitely a keeper!

I thought this recipe was great.  I followed what it said, plus some additions that people mentioned in the ratings, such as more onions.  I also chopped up half an apple and put it in (a tip from my roommate), and it was delicious!  The only complaint is that after being in the freezer for awhile they don't taste too great anymore, which disappointed me because I like making things in bulk and freezing them for later. Other than that, great!

These were amazing!I used onion powder because I didnt have an onion, used a whole agg and added some worchestershire sauce for flavor as per other reviews and added flax mill for a healthy kick of omega 3's. Served with a side salad and alexa brand rosemary and olive oil potato fries and my family had a healthy, fillnig, delicious dinner!

This is the only turkey burger recipe I use anymore. It's so easy and it turns out every time. I even had to substitute panko bread crumbs for regular in a pinch and they were still great. When I grill them I usually add more bread crumbs so they don't fall through the grates and hold together better during grilling. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were okay. Not the best turkey burgers I have ever had by a long shot but okay. Tasted more like a meatloaf to us then a burger.

LOVE this recipe!  I made it for two (used 1/2 lb meat) and used a shake of garlic powder instead of fresh.  I also didn't have parsley so just left it out.  Delicious.  Very juicy and held together too. I had mine with cheese and ketchup, no need for mustard on this one.  I can't wait to have it again!

I am not a hamburger fan, and I can never finish my burger. These were GREAT. They weren't too heavy and I finished one and a half. I made these on the BBQ for a grilled flavor and am now hooked on Turkey burgers. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a fantastic basic turkey burger recipe. I did make a few adjustments for my liking... Instead of using bread crumbs I use rolled oats (a healthy alternative) I also add a few splashes of Worcestehire Sauce..and for a nice little kick I add about a 1 tsp of Jerk Seasoning. I prefer the paste type seasoning. Very Tasty!!!

Made these for family and friends..they loved the burgers!! My BF wanted them two nights in a row, and he definitely wasn't a turkey burger fan before. I added a little bit more of the ingredients and added some garlic salt. Then pounded the patties til they were thin. Had my burger with cheese, turkey bacon, portabello mushrooms and avocadoe...delicious!! Now I'm going to use this recipe for turkey meatballs

These were great. They didn't taste like hamburger but that is hard to get one meat to taste like another. For a healthier choice they were fabulous. I didn't miss not having the red meat.

These turned out really great on the grill.  We had to freeze half the recipe (too much for 2 people...), but I did add Worcestershire sauce, more bread crumbs and some Williams Sonoma Hamburger Seasoning, so not quite 5 stars on its own, but still very good!

Great recipe. I didn't use parsley, and subbed the bread crumbs for an equal amount of crushed original flavor Sun Chips. Very tasty!  Everyone liked them, including the kids and the husband! I ate mine on a bun with light mayo and a slice of swiss. Will use again for sure.  Thanks!

This is pretty good, nice and healthy, changed a few things, served on Onion buns, used whole egg, added red pepper flakes, cheese, sauteed some thinly sliced onions for the top and was yummy! Grilled on stove in grill pan w/ PAM olive oil spray, 8 mins per side, little thick. Next time I might change it a little, maybe some green chilis for some kick. Overall, good!

For 1 lb of ground turkey, making 4 burgers:  ~3 Tbsp onion, handful of parsley, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 2 garlic cloves (this may have been too much), salt, pepper, seasoning salt, some worcestershire sauce.  I did lightly flour the patties before frying, 6 mins/side.  Served with lettuce, tomato, mayo on wheat rolls.  Yum!

These are amazing.. Some modification I made:  - brown the oinion first and let them cool a little bit - tripple the garlic, salt, pepper and parsley qty  Do NOT over-cook or it will get dry..  I served them on brown buns with some tomato and that's it. They where good enough to eat as-is

Tasty! Quite soft though and I don't think they would hold up on the BBQ.  I used the George Forman to grill them.

My family LOVES this recipe, even my 2 year old and picky husband! I love that it's so adaptable to what I have in the pantry for spices. I've found Ground Turkey to be quite bland, but this recipe turned my world around! I've used it as a meatloaf recipe too.

Really good, tastes alot like a meatloaf, very flavorful. I followed others' advice and addes Worchester and soy sauce, and I also used eggbeaters instead of the eggwhite. I used light/dark turkey meat, I would think they might be a little dry if you use ground turkey breast but they would be healthier, perhaps I'll try it with the breast and report back ( :

AMAZING!! I omitted the parsley as I did not have it on hand. I also added 1/2 a cup of chopped red bell pepper and with the recommendations of other reviewers, added a couple of splashed of Worcestershire Sauce and low sodium soy sauce. I used a whole egg instead of just egg whites and added a little more bread crumbs. I grilled these on my George Foreman and served with mini sliders! These were delicious, so juicy, and as I grilled them it filled my kitchen with delicious smells that made my mouth water!   My mother cannot eat beef and these were a great substitution! Will definitely make again!

I make these all the time, usually on the foreman, they are fantastic. Nice flavor and doesn't leave you wishing you had a beef burger.

I modified this to create mini burgers, and baked them in an oven on 350 for 40min.  At the end I put different cheeses on them (brie, swiss, etc.).  They turned out great and our guests loved them.

Of course I upped the garlic and onion in this recipe, and it came out GREAT!  I'd make turkey meatballs using the same recipe.

These were really good!  This was my first time experimenting with ground turkey instead of beef.  I scaled down to 1 lb. of turkey and still got 5 nice size burgers out of this.  They didn't shrink up like the beef ones do.  I only had dried parsley, and I just added one whole egg instead of egg whites.  I also tossed in chopped red peppers and a little bit of leftover reduced fat feta cheese, which was delicious in these -- melted down beautifully and no need to add any extra cheese to your burger!  We grilled these on the George Foreman and it worked great!

I used 1/2 cup onion, and also added 1/4 finely diced serranno peppers, and used the whole egg. I served them with avocado, tomato, lettuce, and monterey jack cheese. Delicious!

Really simple, juicy and flavorful! Kids gave it two thumbs up, next I won't make the patties so large, took a long time to cook and we had to microwave it after a while on the grill cause we were in a hurry. Still juicy!

I made these for the 2nd time tonight and they were delicious!  I had only plain breadcrumbs so I added some dried oregano and basil.  Also used dried parsley as I didn't have any fresh.  Also added a dash of Red Hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce as others suggested.  Grilled up beautifully!  Thank you!

My husband and I made these burgers for friends of ours, but we didn't tell them they were made out of turkey and they had no clue! They just kept saying how good they were and they even asked for the recipe! haha.

These were very good. I did add some Worcestershire Sauce, a green pepper, and McCormiks Hamburger seasoning. I cooked the patties on a griddle so that I would get done with them faster. My family loved these so much. Thanks!

These were fantastic. I never would have put fresh parsley in a burger before this but wow it gave it such wonderful flavor. I'm sure some of the bad reviews were from those who used dried in place of fresh. My suggestion is don't it really gives it a taste all of its own. I used red onion because I had a half of a red from another recipe I was making that I need to use. I originally intended to grill these but oops out of gas, but they work out great on the stove.

I don't really know where I went wrong but these just would not let go of the grill and eventually just fell through. They were very..wet and my dad thought the texture was exremely soft.. like mushy. I even added more bread crumbs but being my first time making from scratch burgers, or turkey-burgs, so I just went with it. O well..thanks!!

Excellent turkey burger.  I followed the directions except I used old bay seasoned bread crumbs and seasoned salt in place of regular salt.  The fresh ingredients really made a difference in my opinion.  I made 10 burgers out of this batch and cooked them on my George Foreman grill on medium for 15 min.  Served the burgers on wheat hamburger rolls with sauteed onions, shredded lettuce and sliced tomatoes.  We had sauteed spinich with garlic on the side.  My family loved these burgers.

This is a good recipe with the following additions... add 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 2 drops liquid smoke, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon season-all, 1 tablespoon Montreal steak seasoning, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 tablespoon sweet basil in place of parsley a-n-d if you want a lil extra kick, add some spicy brown mustard to the meat mixture. Use the whole egg and grind saltines into crumbs and add 1 teaspoon italian seasoning or try chicken flavored stuffing mix ground into crumbs. Serve with finely sliced baby spinach (like shredded lettuce) petite diced or thinly sliced tomatoes and some feta cheese.  For those having an issue with the burgers being dry, try one of the follow...  Grilling: add a couple tablespoons of very finely crushed iced right into the meat mixture.  Frying: place in a frying pan and add 1/2 cup water, cover with a lid and simmer until your desired doneness is reached. (You could even use turkey or chicken broth)

Very tasty.  Per suggestions from other users, I added a splash of worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.  Left out the parsley because I wanted my kids to give it a fair try and anything green would turn them off. My 7 year old loved them.

These burgers were SO GOOD! I used ground turkey breast so I was a bit nervous they would be dry. That wasn't the case at all.   I made a couple of small changes. I didn't have any parsley so I used about a 1/4 cup of finely diced green pepper. I also put in a splash of Worcestershire sauce. I think I'm going to put in a splash of liquid smoke next time to "beef" it up a little bit.  My husband said we should have a weekly burger night with these! My four and six year old gobbled them up too. Oh, I made our burgers with sauteed (in 1 tsp of olive oil) mushrooms and onions and a slice of Jarlsberg lite cheese.

I really liked these burgers.  I added a little soy sauce as previously suggested and grated the onion in the mix.  It was really moist and delicious.  I will definitely make these again!

I had never tried making a turkey burger before. This recipe ended up better than I thought... but I still feel there is room for improvement.

I liked the ease of preparing this recipe.   I used Italian parsley for added zest.   Also because my husband is not found of turkey I added onion soup mix.  This way he loved it and didn't miss the Beef burger, which is unhealthy for him.

Pretty good.  I found a little bland though, we like a lot of flavor.  Smell delicious too.  Will probally make again with some moderations with the spices.

These were just okay.  I followed other's advice and increased the garlic, added worcestershire and montreal chicken seasoning.  I liked them, but they were nothing special.  My husband really didn't care for them.

These burgers were great! My husband put extra bread crumbs and some chopped green bell pepper. Right before we fried them we patted some flour on them. My neighbors son had never had turkey burgers. He came over last night and went through 2 burgers! It was a hit!

These are awesome! I am on a very strict diet, and must limit my red meat intake. These are a godsend! I did add Worcestershire sauce as others recommended. I pan fry in olive oil until outside is set, then transfer to the grill coated with olive oil. I also melt provolone cheese on top while still on the grill. I have made these a couple of times now, and they are just great! Thanks!

I added a step of pan frying the burgers first, then grilling them on our bbq (with lots of pam) to prevent them from breaking apart.  It worked.  I added a splash of worstershire, soy sauce, ketchup and mustard, and skipped the parsley.  They were awesome!

These were really good.  I didn't have any onions on hand, but I had chives-so that is what I used for onion.  I also had to use dried parsely.  Really good basic recipe.

This is possibly one of the most bland turkey burgers I've ever had.  I hope I did something wrong but I've been cooking for over 25 years and this is the first time I've had to apologize for my cooking in a long while.

Thanks anyways.

I cut the recipe back to 4 servings since I am not fond of ground turkey and didn't want a lot of leftovers if it wasn't as good as everybody said.  These are great - very flavorful, a little crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside. I cooked mine on a Foreman grill and they turned out wonderful.  This one will be added to my low-fat recipe book.  Thanks for sharing it with all us calorie counters, this is a great burger.

I scaled the recipe down to 8, added worcestershire sauce and used a whole egg. We topped the burgers with cheese and cooked them on the grill. The burgers had a lot of flavor and were a nice change from beef.

Excellent but added worcestershire, dash soy sauce, minced jalapeno, one whole egg.  Cooked on the grill.  Very juicy and will definitely make again.

This was my first try at making turkey burgers.  I'm so glad they turned out, otherwise I'd never be able to get my beef loving husband to try them again!  They were pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but think next time I'll try adding some of the things other reviewers suggested.  They were very good, but not outstanding.  I think with a couple additions they could be worthy of 5 stars.

These were very good.  I am giving it 4 stars because I made two changes.  Instead of the egg I used flax seed mixed with water and because of that I added about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs because the mixture was very moist.  I also sprinkled a little bit of garlic powder in there.  There were really moist and since we are trying to lower our carbs we ate them without buns and a little bar b que sauce.  I will make these again! Thanks for the recipe.

I've made these before exactly as the recipe said, and they were pretty good. But this time, I added some jerk seasoning, worcestershire, a wee bit of liquid smoke and a little bit of soy sauce, and they were terrific. I also substituted panko for the seasoned bread crumbs.

These were okay.  I think for our palate, they need to be spiced up a bit.  Still, a nice change from our normal fare.

Delish...I will only use this recipe for turkey burgers from this day forth!!  I did omit the onions and used a splash of soy sauce and wostershire sauce.  I also used a gourmet burger seasoning right on top of the burgers before grilling them for about 12 min total.  So good!!

this recipe was great!!  I used suggestions from other users: wortchesire sauce-sp?, lawry's seasoning salt, some extra pepper.  I didn't have the minced garlic but it was great anyway.  I was very suprised by how much parsley to use but it was wonderful.  Then I mashed up half an avacado with a teaspoon of mayo and salt & pepper and used it as a spread.  One word YUMMY!!!
p.s. I used 1 pd of turkey and I made 4 patties on my griddle.  If you can't get the inside done put something over it to capture the steam.

This is a very good alternative to a hamburger.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added what they recommended. I did add a small cube of feta cheese inside each burger and it tasted great! I did cut the recipe in half, however, I wouldn't have needed to since my family like them.  My husband and daughters asked if I had made more.  This recipe will replace my summertime burger recipe.

We just started a lowfat diet in my home to lose weight. After trying Jenny-O turkey burgers i was doomed to a ife of being fat. Then i seen this recipe and altered it a bit. IT IS SOOOOOO GOOD. Everyone devoured it, and it is much better than any pre made turkey burger out there. I added worchestire sauce and a little more brad crumb as well as a whole egg (mine was shrunk to w4 servings) AWESOME

Really Great Turkey Burgers!! The whole family liked them. I used fresh garlic, onion, red bell pepper, worcestershire sauce, and some black beans. They turned out so good. We put cheddar cheese on top! Yummy!

Not bad, but I will definitely add a little bit more onion, and a lot more garlic and Worcestershire sauce next time. As one reviewer recommended, I covered these with flour right before cooking, plus added a little olive oil to the pan.  Next time I will add olives and maybe some ground nuts for texture.

These burgers were really delicious, even my husband enjoyed them!  I made a few changes (scaled down for 1 lb. of meat)...added a small handful more breadcrumbs, used seasoned salt instead of reg. salt, put about 5 or 7 shakes each of lite soy sauce and Worcestershire, and I left my onion a little larger than a fine dice (to add a little texture).  I also put them in the freezer for about 15 mins. before grilling, really helped them stay together.  They were great, this one is a keeper for me!

Actually FABULOUS Turkey Burgers!! Kickin' up the YUM Factor a Zillion times.  Added Worcestershire (A splash & a half) and a splash of soy sauce.  Used the whole egg - not just the whites.  Thanks, POOJER!!!

If you want burgers without the unhealthy price tag, this is the recipe for you.  I omitted the parsley because I did not have any on hand.  I added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce as a few others did.  And a great way to make it a little more "meatier," saute sliced mushrooms and shallots with a little butter for a fancier, delicious mushroom burger.

These turkey burgers and pretty good and full of flavor, however in my opinion this recipe calls for WAY to much parsley, the flavor of the parsley was overpowering! The next time I make these I will only add about 2 tbs. of parsley. Other than that the turkey burgers were great!

Much better than the turkey patties you buy in the store.
I bought 3 packages of "Honeysuckle White" ground turkey (about 3 1/2 lbs.)
I used 1/3 cup regular breadcrumbs instead of 1/4 cup.
Everything else according to recipe except added a few drops of liquid smoke, a few drops of soy sauce, and a few drops of worcestershire sauce.
Don't cook in a skillet - much better on the grill - scrape the grill clean then pour some olive oil on a paper towel and wipe the grates with it.
Oh yeah, keep your hands wet (water) when making 12 patties. Make the patties the day before and put between wax paper.
These burgers are awesome!

Like most people, I altered the recipe a little, since I didn't have all the ingredients, plus I seasoned to taste.  
The basic recipe is great to build on.  I didn't expect it to taste like beef; I wasn't quite sure what I was expecting.  The idea of turkey burgers never appealed to me, however, I thought I'd give it a try, since I want to eat healthier.  The burgers were great!  I ate them bunless, with only a little barbeque sauce, some of which I added to the meat before cooking.  I thought they were great, even though I didn't cover them up with a bun, and tons of condiments.

These are great with the recommendations suggested.  I added the worchestershire, some Country Bobs Sauce, Lawry's garlic salt and the whole egg.  When we make broiled tiny little patties my kids eat them as chicken nuggets-much healthier though :)

I made a few alterations so if it hadn't turned out I wouldn't have reviewed, but they were delicious so here goes:  I didn't have bread crumbs so I added a little more wheat germ than was called for in the recipe, added about a TBS of worchestire sauce, used dried parsley, and the whole egg as suggested.  These were wonderful!  I usually buy the prepared ones, but these were tender and juicy with great flavor.  One note, they seem very soft and I had to shape them right on the pan but they kept together perfectly and didn't crumble at all.  My two year old ate an entire one!

This is as good as everyone says!  Even my retired-butcher husband, who is a BIG fan of beef, loves it.  We read the reviews and added a whole egg, some worcestershire, lite soy, and seasoned salt.  Even my 4 year old picky eater likes these burgers!  We served them with baked potato wedges and pickled beets....mmmmmmm!!!!

Great recipe!  Do not expect them to taste like beef burgers; but they stand well on their own.  Some additions to suit my taste: additional onion, Worcestershire sauce, chopped sun-dried tomatoes.  I serve on toasted English Muffin with mustard on one half, ketchup on the other and top with kosher pickle slices.  Yummy!

Delicious! I took others advice and added worcestershire sauce and Season All, because my bread crumbs were plain. I served on whole wheat bread w/LT & light mayo and my husband and I loved it.

My whole family really enjoyed these burgers.  This says a lot being that everyone is male and love meat!!  I used lipton onion soup mix instead of chopped onions for ease, put the blue cheese right in the mixture and went heavy on the worsechire sauce.  I didn't have any soy sauce so I just used my favorite pantry spices in it.  I threw them on the George Foreman and they were wonderful on a toasted bun with all the usual burger toppings.  Yum!

I have to laugh over the "actually" delicious as though turkey can't be delicious.  I make things like turkey burgers, white chili, etc. all the time.  (And I'm supposed to be the picky eater.)  It really helps if you can just take turkey for what it is: turkey, and stop seeing it as a beef substitute.  I made these as is.  They were good, but (despite being "actually" delicious), I've had better.  Turkey requires extra moisture and extra flavor since it's bland.  I think this was missing just a little something on the "extra flavor" side.

Not enough flavor so I played with the ingredients, added/removed and found a great recipe that I think all will love.  I make mine with frozen chopped spinach defrosted and drained, sun dried tomatoes in oil (in the mini chopper) add shredded provolone, garlic powder.  As for a topping, I use Franks RED Hot sauce (not to spicy, just the perfect kick).

These are preety good - they are actually juicy. I used crushed up baquette herb crackers for the crumb, which added a nice flavour. I only used 1lb of ground turkey, used 1 whole egg beaten, and added some worcestershire. I cooked them the day before on the BBQ and had one last night for dinner. Was a nice healthy alternative to ground beef and had a nice flavour. I will definitely make these again.

These were pretty good turkey burgers.  They had a nice flavor and a good texture.  Next time I will add more breadcrumbs as my turkey was runny when I placed it on aluminum foil on the grill.  I had to use the foil to keep it from pouring straight through.

SO GOOD! I had some extra from the recipe "broccoli with roasted red peppers" so I chopped that up really fine and added that to the mixture along with some worcestershire sauce and a little hot sauce...they were SO good and moist, I will definitely make these again!

Just one thing that makes a huge difference, the first time I made them I followed the recipe, pretty good.  I made them again and added about 10 chopped up button mushrooms and 2 green onions white and green part and omitted read crumbs.  The mushrooms retain a lot of moisture and made them so much moister.  Oh yeah, I also added a heaping tablespoon of good quality dijon mustard to the mix.  They were great on a toasted wheat bun with some lettuce, fresh salsa and avocado on top. My husband topped his with swiss cheese and barbeque sauce.  Men!
Also, they are a little "soft" for the outdoor grill, better inside on a grill pan lightly sprayed.

This was incredible! Be sure not to overcook on the grill. They were so moist and with swiss cheese, a spoon of horseradish, and all the typical burger fixins - it made for a great great party meal.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I was going to only give these 2 stars until i read how other people were serving them. I think elizabeth B. has the best idea. I served mine just as a simple burger but it needs something else to make them special.

This was better than any other turkey burger recipe I've made...even my own.  I was skeptical, but tried it anyways.  I made the recipe "as-is" with no other modifications and I couldn't beleive how juicy the burgers were.  Was it the egg whites?  Because turkey can be very dry, we grilled the burgers slowly and took them off before I normally would.  They were perfect!

This was an excellent recipe.  I will definitely be using it again. My husband said it was the best burger he'd ever had and my finicky toddler gobbled up his burger. 
I love experimenting with recipes so here's how I gave my burgers their extra umph: 1) I used some ground steak spice (You can use a magic bullet or coffee grinder) 2) I used seasoning salt instead of the salt and pepper. 3) I took on reviewers suggestions and added worcheshire sauce and hot sauce.
4) I served the burgers with avacado, tomato, lettuce and sauted mushrooms and onions (saute with a 1/2 tsp. of hickory flavoured sauce, a dash of salt and pepper), I used mayo, dijon mustard, and cranberry sauce as well.  Awesome!!

G8T recipe! I used crushed cheese crackers for bread crumbs and the whole egg. Dusted the patty with flour like someone else recommended - turned out fabulous. I finally found a way to enjoy burgers without beef.

I pretty much use this same recipe in my turkey burgers, except I use seasoned salt and add basil. I love the flavor the basil gives!! I no longer use ground bef for burgers and even my kids prefer it this way!!

These were good, not great. I will definitely make them again. I used ground chicken (all I had) and added a little worcestershire (per others) as well as 1 tsp oregano and thyme. I made half as meatballs and the other half as burgers.

Made the added suggestions, but we ran out of eggs so I omitted them. They stayed together just fine on the grill. On a personal note, next time I'll be sure to chop the onions a little finer. Thanks for sharing.

These are exactly what the title suggests - suprisingly good turkey burgers!  I halved the recipe and made 6 and cooked them on the stove.  I liked them - hubby did not.  I will try again on the outdoor grill and see if he likes them better.  I thought they had great flavor and was a healthy alternative to beef burgers.

These were very good.  I grated the onion instead of chopping it.  I think it really added a lot of moisture.  I think it needs something, but I haven't figured out what that something is!  I would make them again.

I've never made Turkey burgers before, but we had some friends over that don't eat any red meat, so I thought I would try this recipe.  The only changes we made only because we use this for our beef burgers was to add some worshershire, omitted the salt and garlic and added garlic powder along with ground pepper and mixed in some ice cold water to make a juicy burger.  They loved them and so did I.  We will make these a lot more often for a healthier burger.  Thanks so much for the post.

Great recipe! Used 1/2 the amount of ground turkey & doubled the garlic. Added a little worchestershire sauce. Delicious on the grill! Definitely a family favorite.

I was definitely expecting a mouthwatering, yummy dinner, but I was seriously not impressed.  Dry and lacking flavor.  Definitely easy and I'm sure it can be fine-tuned, but I'll keep searching.

I made these for my family (I didn't eat any because I'm a vegetarian), but everyone else had at least two apiece.  I used extra-lean ground turkey and added some cayenne pepper for heat.  I was told they were excellent!

The name says it all.  At first I was skeptical because I thought that the turkey would taste funny, but actually they were really moist and seasoned perfectly.  Even my 6 year old loves them, and he is a very picky eater.

I thought this recipe was AWESOME!  I think it should be renamed to AWESOMELY Delicious Turkey Burgers.  It was PERFECT!  I will definitely make these again.  My 11 year old daughter loved them as well.  As a matter of fact, she just came in my room and said she is going to fix her another one to eat!

I LOVED these turkey burgers. I used one pound of ground turkey to make four burgers.  My husband said, "I feel like I've cheated on my diet!"  I made a couple of changes:  I used dried diced onion and I chopped up about 1/3 cup of jalopena peppers (the kind you use on nachos)    Very flavorful! Cooked them on my George Foreman.  Served them on whole wheat buns alongside of sweet potato fries (fried in canola oil).

This recipe was my first attempt at turkey burgers, and I have to say it was delicious!  I am hooked.  I will say that I thought the recipe needed a little more spice to it.  I think next time I might add some grill seasoning and see if that gives it a little kick.

This was pretty good, much better & moister than any other Turkey Burger that we tried.  I made it as directed and then added some chives.  My husband and i did enjoy this, but in was a little bland.  If i hadn't added the chives, it most likely would not have tasted like much.

I use this recipe alot. We only use ground turkey and this is my favorite way to make turkey burgers. I don't add onions though, per my choice. I like to add a couple splashes of Allegro marinade to the mix of eggs and seasoned bread crumbs. I like to sprinkle some seasonings on top as they burgers cook also..such a crushed peppercorn. These burgers are so varsatile and tasty you can really have fun with this recipe.

Tried this recipe this week.  It was delicious, even though I forgot to put the eggs in.  I added a little more seasoning salt to taste.  Husband loved them.

They are "actually delicious"!  Nice and juicy as long as you don't over cook them.  I added Worcestershire Sauce, 2 whole eggs, plain bread crumbs (instead of seasoned), paprika and a little extra garlic.  I also added bbq sauce to a few while they cooked for extra flavour.  Melted some med. cheddar cheese on the top; a bit high in calories but oh so good!

Like the title said, actually good!  Even my little guys (7 and 9) ate them up.  For the adults, I put on some jalapeno jack cheese which gave it a little kick.  I also added the worstershire sauce, I think about 2 tsp for 2 1/4 lbs of ground turkey breast.  I served them on whole wheat buns with fresh fruit and some pasta.  A definite keeper!

This is one easy and tasty way to serve ground turkey.  I also added a little worstershire sauce, used minced dried onions, and used the entire egg.  They turned out great.  I could see where this WOULD also be good as a meatloaf or meatballs.  Not a ton of flavor, but mild enough for kids and flavorful enough for mom and dad.

These were very tasty.  I scaled it down, so the consistency wasn't quite right (but that's totally my fault - it's hard to get 7/8 of an egg).  But all the ladies I had over for cards loved them!!

These burgers were easy to make, and they tasted great.  However, they lacked the extra "oomph" that I was hoping for in order to give them 5 stars.

I wasn't a big fan of these. I think that the seasonings were to strong and it tasted like meatloaf BIG time. I dont think I will be making these again. My family thought they were ok and thats why I am giving it 3 stars but i personally would maybe give it two. I think if the bread crumbs and eggs were omitted it might have been better...but not alot.

Excellent. I melted some fresh mozarella on top and it was perfect.  I used dried parsley and followed others in adding a splash of worcestershire sauce and used seasoned salt.  I look forward to a leftover one for dinner tomorrow.

I'd been worndering what to do with the ground turkey in my freezer.  Thank goodness I found this recipe.  I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce and substituted seasoned salt for the regular variety.  Yesterday while the rest of the family was grilling chicken breasts & steak, I put some of these burgers on the bbq.  I loved them!  I even had a leftover one for dinner tonight too.  This will be a new healthy addition to my personal menu.

These burgers were fabulous! I am so glad that I found this recipe, I am sure that they will be my staple this summer. I took the suggestion of adding a couple of splashes of wosterchire & I substituted season salt for regular salt. Husband and daughter both enojoyed.  Thanks Trudi!

Good recipe, and very easy.  I cooked the onion and garlic in a skillet before adding to the mixture, served on buns with a slice of provolone on top, delicious!  I will be making this again.

These really were actually delicious being my first time trying turkey burgers.  I did everything as directed in the recipe but used a whole egg, not just the whites, and added some worcestershire sauce.  My family loved them, and I think that if I hadn't made them myself, I wouldn't have even realized they weren't actually real hamburgers.

yes these are actually delicious!!!  My bf really liked them -he commented, "these are actually good!" I only made up one burger with this recipe (I made up 2 burgers using the Feta Cheese turkey burgers recipe on this site; these are much better). As a result of only making up 1 burger, I kind of just guessed on how much ingredients to use. I did use the bread crumbs, parsley and garlic. I also added some Montreal steak seasoning to the patty. I left out the onion and egg. I served with home-made steak fries (seasoned with montreal steak seasoning, thyme and oregano), baked beans and broccoli salad. Very good meal.

I have issues with ground turkey dont like the smell and texture but,I gave this a try and was extremely surprised!  I actually ate the whole burger. My hubby ate three! Only thing different was I didnt have bread crumbs so crushed seasoned croutons.  Will definately make again.

These were much better than either I or my fiance would have thought. We also cut the recipe in half. They didn't have the same consistency as ground beef but were still just as good, just without all the extra fat. A very good substitute for beef. After trying this recipe, we have tried more recipes using turkey instead of beef.

I like these better than beef hamburgers.  I used half 15% and half 98% fat free turkey.  These were juicy and tasty but lean.  I cooked them in my cast iron skillet.  Hubby couldn't believe they were turkey, and hamburgers are one of his favorite foods.

Great recipe! Very moist burger, did not miss a beef patty at all. And I love beef burgers!) I added Worcestershire sauce, Creole seasoned salt and I used one whole egg. I was really impressed that turkey burger was no different than a beef burger. My husband thoroughly enjoyed them.

I didn't really enjoy this recipe. The burgers were dry and tasted like meat loaf. They were a slight improvement over a "plain" turkey burger, but not by much. I wouldn't cook this again.

I've made this 4 times now and I really like it. For some reason, I usually end up just eating the patties dipped in a small amt. of ketchup and thinking of it as a turkey meatloaf patty. It's yummy either way, though!

These were really great!  I'm doing the weight watchers diet and trying to eliminate high fat ground beef so I decided to try this recipe; I was not disappointed.  Instead of salt I added a teaspoon of Goya Sazon seasoning.  Even my 5 year old loved these.  Thanks for a great recipe!

What's weird about this recipe is that 3 lbs. of turkey is a lot in comparison to the amounts of the other ingredients. Seems like it would go better with 1 lb. Anyway, I did only use 1 lb. & 1/3 of the other ingredients except I forgot & put in 1 egg. I thought they were OK- my family liked.

A very good seasoned turkey burger.  I took out the onions since I don't like them, so the garlic flavoring was the strongest, but it was great.  Nice and juicy too.

Very good.  I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of the regular ones and put barbecue sauce on top.  Delicious!

This was really tasty for a turkey burger!  Actually, the best turkey burger I've had.  I will be making it often.  Low calorie and carb!

I am giving this a 4 because my husband really liked them.  I on the other hand was not quite as sure....there was just something about them that I am not sure about.  I am going to make again and see if I change my mind.

I thought these burgers were ok.  I did enjoy that they are much lower in fat than traditional beef burgers.  I am not sure if I will make again though.

Pretty good.  I made these to go camping with and I liked them.  I will make them again.
