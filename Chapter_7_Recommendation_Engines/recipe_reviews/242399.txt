Update 8 Nov 2016. For those of you having trouble with the farinata sticking to your pan: put the oiled pan inside the oven while it preheats. This is a trick that breadmakers in Italy use to keep the mixture from sticking! :-) My original teview: This is just like I had in Portofino from the street side bakeries. "La farinata" as it is called in Italy is a fast and easy alternative to cornbread and wheat bread. This recipe is perfect leaving you with a flavourful, sponge-like focaccia to enjoy with salads, soup or on its own. The method is right on. I let it sit for 4 hours uncovered but was told by the submitter of this recipe it is best covered. Mine tasted just fine nonetheless. It cooks up quickly and takes only minutes to put together. It is also nice the next day reheated on the grill similar to polenta, crisping it to be used for appetisers and even as a base for gluten free pizza! Thank you sueb for sharing this recipe.

I also used chicken or bone broth instead of water for additional flavor, so many ideas can be made with this recipe.

This is an excellent recipe , thanks for sharing!  I've made for a pizza crust too.

Thanks - this was terrific! I didn't see any need to skim the foam - and I thought the foam might give it some lift, so I folded it in. I wonder if the person who found it dry and grainy missed the instruction to mix and let it sit for hours.  Anyhow - thanks, I can see lots of room for lots of variations here!

This was nicely spiced to accent the mild, slightly nutty, flavour of the hydrated bean flour and olive oil. However, it stuck all over the pan (even though I greased the pan) and seemed under done to me despite cooking it the allotted amount of time and waiting for it to brown on the edges. I plan on trying this again, but I will take the advice of other recipes for the same thing and use a cast iron skillet, heat the pan up until the oil just starts to smoke, pour the batter into the centre of the pan, and then bake in the oven until it browns at a bit more than just at the very edges. Heating the pan before adding the batter is supposed to prevent sticking.

The recipe was a success.  I took Buckwheat Queen's note about heating the pan first and my bread didn't stick.  I added some garlic powder to the batter and Parmesan cheese on top which definitely brought more flavor to the finished recipe.  I"ll definitely make this again and crisp up the individual pieces in a pan for more texture.

Not bad :) I baked mine longer, because I like it more dry. I think  next time I'll add some onions & mushrooms! :)

Turned out beautiful, I made it a few times, in my modified version that I loved I used half cup rice flour and that makes the batter more digestible and lighter. I even tried it once as a pizza with finely chopped inside salami (gluten free) and olives and  basil. It' even better toasted the next day. If you want to prevent sticking you could use baking paper like I did. That's one of my favorite recipes now and regularly present in my gluten free diet.

i made this and had no problem with sticking because I used a spray giving my pan a thick coating. Sometimes greasing a pan does not work as well as a spray. The flavor is good and I am fond of chickpeas. Other spices could be used to give it a mid eastern flavor such as paprika and corriander.

I substituted vegetable broth for water and ghee for the oil.    Fresh herbs.  My opinion is that as a bread, it is too dry.    A better use would be (after a little more baking) as a healthy pizza crust.

This seemed too easy. To make, memorize, and eat. I used it as a pizza crust and it was legit. Pretty dry on its own, but great with toppings and/or dipping stuff.

I pureed a can of chickpeas in the blender and used it in place of the chickpea flour/water mix.  It turned out great!  I wasn't exactly sure what the consistency was supposed to be.  After about 15 minutes, it was like polenta, just like sueb said.  I wanted it a little harder, so I put it in for another 15-20 minutes and it became a little more like the consistency of a pie crust.  It tastes really good, and it's a good substitute for pasta or rice

So easy to make and delicious. I did not have Italian seasoning or rosemary. Instead I used some garlic powder, basil and lemon pepper. SO many variations could be used here. So delicious and versatile. I greased my pan with olive oil and had no problems.

Excellent. Used 10" Skillet. One minor substitution; I used ghee for the 'cooking spray' since the flavor is better and the smoke is less and it's better for you than artificial flavorings.
Wife competed for the last piece....she loved it too.

I loved the idea of this bread, so I made it. I felt like the dough wouldn't thicken properly, so I added a pinch of xantam gum and it worked much better than without it. Oh, and I use it as a pizza crust!

I ground chick peas into flour and made recipe as written.  Lots of flavour but too much for my taste - that can always be adjusted for future.  However, the reason for low rating was due to the dryness of the end product - very dry and crumbly.  Perhaps I overlooked a step.  I was so excited to try this.

I followed the recipe and doubled the measurements to accommodate a bigger pan. I greased the pan well with grape seed oil and it came out perfectly! It did not stick at all.

Like others have mentioned, I too didn't have the best success making this. I missed a key step whuch was allow oil to get hot in pan first. My bread was gummy like and although I tried to cook it past the required time, it still didn't come out right. I will definitely try this recipe again and take the recommendation of others about pre-heating the skillet first with oil. Keeping my fingers crossed.

Followed directions. Texture nothing like polenta. Stuck to the pan. Significant other thought it was gummy; I thought it was dry.

Made this recipe as indicated in directions. Came out very dry and granular, and unappetizing. Will not try again.

I loved this recipe.!  I substituted the chickpea flour for Bob Red Mill's Garbanzo and Fava bean flour.  I did not use much oil, but lined the pan with parchment paper.  The recipe was perfect.  I will be preparing this again.
