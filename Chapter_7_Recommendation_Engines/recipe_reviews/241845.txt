This is not too similar to what Lebanese rice I've had but it is tasty nonetheless. I added a lot more nuts--2 or 3 times the stated amount--and a bit of golden raisins. Thanks for a good, versatile recipe.

I like rice. And, I really like Lebanese food. But, I was hoping for more with this one. I guess the photos led me to believe this rice dish was going to be much more flavourful than it is. It’s a good rice dish, but not great. It’s just kind of “meh”. The rice cooked as is, for sure, is fluffy and moist, but it’s just rice. I’m not sure if it’s worth the extra effort compared to just a nice pot of rice cooked in stock with a few add-ins thrown in at the end.

My family and the groups I have made it for loved this recipe.  Our local Lebanese restaurant puts carrots in theirs, so I dice up some carrots and put them in about halfway through with the rice cooking.  Love the addition of some color and if I don't overcook the carrots just the slightest crunch people seem to like as well!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  A keeper for sure!  :)

I made this rice to pair with shish tawook for a Lebanese dinner with friends. The rice turned out delicious, but looked nothing like the picture. It was nowhere near that yellow. I added about three times as many almonds as the recipe called for, and I still think it could have used more. Next time I will probably add more salt too. It was a little bland for my taste (but I'm a salt-aholic). My husband and guests were very complimentary. I will definitely make this again.
