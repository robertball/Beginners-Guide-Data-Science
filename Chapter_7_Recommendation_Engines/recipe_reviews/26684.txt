This was a wonderful New Year's dinner for my husband and I.  My husband really loved the potatoes.

Very good flavor...enjoyed very much with some good margaritas!  Only thing I will change next time is to add some more veggies, as the peppers shrink during cooking the 'veggie' part is minimal.  I would definitely recommend!

I didn't think that this recipe would be all that good, but I tried it and it really suprised me. My whole family loved it, even my 2 year old!

I've made this recipe twice.  It is so easy and turns out really well.  The meat was very tender.  I served it over rice.  You could probably use any combination of vegetables.  My husband who hates "packaged" foods (ie. made from mixes) even raved about it!

Good change of pace from the run-of-the-mill pork recipe.  Take care though - potatoes will turn out underdone if instructions are followed.  We fixed this the second time by microwaving the potatoes to half-cooked.

I have used pork chop everytime with this recipe and hands down it makes for the juiciest chop ever! Very good.

This recipe was so easy to do.  We accompanied the pork with sour cream and salsa and the combination was great.  The kids ate the pork plain and they enjoyed it also.  The meat was tender and flavorfull.  jpire
