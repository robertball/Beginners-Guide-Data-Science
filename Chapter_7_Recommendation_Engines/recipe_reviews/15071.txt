I used this recipe to enter a Banana Bake-Off at my fair.  I received 1st place then won Grand Champion over all the catergories.  Since Banana Cream pies aren't acceptable this was the perfect recipe for the competition.  I added some tapioca to thicken the pie up a bit.  The first time I made it it was really watery.  The second time it set up beautifully.

This is a very tasty pie. I would recommend not trying to serve it warm-- too runny. I wouldn't even cut it until it has chilled in the fridge for 24 hours. The 2nd day it had really gelled and was awesome.

man, how I was hoping and praying how awesome this pie was going to be...boy I was so wrong. I followed it to a T, and the pie was looking pretty, smelling pretty, even golden just beautifully. I sliced it up for my whole family and as I was taking photos of the piece I had, I hear several yucks and that's nasty coming from my family. I tasted it and WOW, the flavor really was really out there and it's something I have never tasted before nor want to again.....Sorry I don't know how or why but it totally was not very tasteful or pleasing to our taste buds. It just didn't taste right at all. The bananas in pineapple juice with sugar and cinnamon tasted great "BUT" that was before I baked it. Soo Soo sorry, it won't be made again in my kitchen.

A good one. Next time, I'll use riper bananas and a best brand for pineapple juice (I took the cheapest in the supermarket, and I couldn't taste bananas had marinated in it for about 1 hour). So: riper bananas and better pineapple juice = tastier pie (I guess, at least).

This pie was rich and sweet.  It tasted great warm and even better cold.  Simple, easy, and tasty.

Very yummy pie!

I was skeptical of this, because it seemed too easy, but it turned out great! I accidentally bought graham cracker crusts instead of regular pie crusts, but it worked really well. 

I do agree with the other reviewer who said that it doesn't LOOK very appealing, however I covered it with cool whip and it got gobbled right up at my luau-themed party :)

This was actually quite good, but must have looked unappetizing because hardly anyone tried it.  This would be better at a dinner where you are the sole provider of desserts, rather than at a potluck.  If it's the only option, people will try it and like it.  If not, it may get skipped over.  Oh well, more for me to take home and eat!

Excellent.  I served this at a cottage party...Hawaiian theme...and received rave reviews.  I baked it for an additional 5 minutes as it seemed quite runny.  We had a bumpy road to take to the party.  Next time I will try to let it cool with the suggested time.  Yummmm.
