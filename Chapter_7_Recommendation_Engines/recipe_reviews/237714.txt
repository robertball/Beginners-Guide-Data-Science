Is there anything on earth that isn't made better by bacon? I don't think so.
I love grilled cabbage and this recipe does not disappoint. Simple and just really good. I only made a very small change and used olive oil in place of the butter, just my personal preference. 
This slices up beautifully after cooking, and the crumbled bacon on top is delish!

Ok so I didn't have a grill, which I think would have made it even more awesome. I baked it and only used 1/2 lb of bacon. I baked at 400 for 60 mins then pulled the bacon out and cooked the cabbage another 10 mins uncovered it to make sure the cabbage got to 165 F internally. I did this because the bacon looked raw in some places. Don't want to poison anyone. I fried the bacon up and crumbled it on top. It was delicious! Thank you for an awesome idea!

Had to make it in the oven...grill was buried. Quartered it, cored it, covered it in bacon and roasted at 400 degrees for 50 minutes.Soooo good!

This was absolutely delicious and so easy to make. I used roasted red pepper and garlic seasoning instead of the garlic (I was in a hurry) and it turned out so well I made it again 2 days later for company.
