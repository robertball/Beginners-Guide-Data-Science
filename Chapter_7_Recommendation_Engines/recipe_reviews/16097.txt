Easy to make and yummy. I will however add 1/2 pkg more cheese next time. As well, I used a traditional 9" store bought crust to save time and money. And just a hint... If you lightly whip the filling before adding the spices, the filling becomes ultra fluffy and the recipe will yield 3 pies...All the more to eat my dear!

hello humans.

this is one of my favorite recipes from this site.  i don't like cheesecake very much and i love this recipe.  i've made this for people that aren't crazy about pumpkin pie and they love it.

it's good enough that it really doesn't need the whipped cream on top.

other than that, you can't go wrong with this recipe.  the only downside to it so far have been the whole humans with their "when are you making that again?" in their annoying human voices.

end transmission.

This is a good recipe.  However, next time I will add a little more cream cheese and a little less pumpkin.

I made two changes--I used evaporated milk in the cheesecake instead of whipping cream and two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices. Here's the thing. The flavor of this is great BUT there is way too much filling for so little crust. I mixed up the cheesecake part in my Kitchen Aid and I could just tell it was going to be too much for one 8 or 9 inch pie pan. I pressed the crumbs into a 8x8 glass baking pan, baked the crust at 350* for 8 minutes, then just followed the rest of the recipe. I really liked this recipe but it really should be double the crust ingredients and make two pies out of it.

This is a great recipe! Some advice: This actually made TWO pumpkin pie cheesecakes. (I used two 9in. pie tins). The pumpkin is subtle, and the cheesecake is not overly sweet. Everyone loved it, especially the pumpkin pie lovers! 100% recommended.

My family doesn't care for pumpkin pie but loved this smooth, creamy version of it.  I made a gingersnap crumb crust rather than the crust in the recipe, and added another half package of cream cheese to the filling.  I may try using two full packages the next time I make it.  Unlike a cheesecake, you don't really taste the cream cheese, but I'm sure that's what makes this pie a cut above the traditional pumpkin pie.  It was absolutely delicious, and everyone was disappointed when it was gone.  I found it took a few extra minutes to bake.  The center was still a bit wobbly when I removed the pie from the oven, but firmed up after it had cooled.

I wanted a more traditional pie for Thanksgiving, but one with a twist. So I used this recipe and changed a few things. I used store bought crust for the bottom, BUT I still mixed up walnuts (cheaper), sugar and ginger in the KitchenAid and set aside. I mixed up the filling as directed, but whipped it well after the spices went in so it fluffed up. Although it didn't "look" fluffy, it was. I also got two pies that fit nicely into the tins you get from Marie Calendars. After filling half way, I spread the nut/sugar/ginger mixture over both pies. I sprinkled it on and then kind of lightly packed it in/on. I filled up the remaining mixture on top and then decorated the top with pecans before baking. I also cut the crusts and made a pie edge. Still baking, so we'll see how it goes.

I made a triple batch of this recipe! Believe me, it hasn't lasted very long!! I think the next time I make these pies I will double the amount of cream cheese. Pie is of good texture but needs some height to it, sorta like a traditional cheesecake has. 
I will agree that you will not want to go back to a regular pumpkin pie again!

LOVE this recipe!!!!  I made a couple of small changes, however. I topped the pie with chopped pecans before baking and served it warm as a side dish.  That may sound strange, but this pie is not as sweet as regular pies.  I would not use this as a cold, whipped cream topped kind of thing, but as a warm dish, it was AMAZING! Lots have asked for the recipe.  Thanks!

This is very good.  While I agree it is not a traditional cheesecake, it is a nice twist on pumpkin pie.  I made it in a 8x8 glass cake pan and it turned out good.  Baked it for about 50 minutes.  It is very light and creamy.  I might try it with more cream cheese next time, just to see what happens. Update: I made this again for Thanksgiving 2010 and really loved it. I did not add the extra cream cheese, but I added a few more pecans to the crust and still cooked it for 50 minutes. Excellent! A keeper. Another update: made this for Thanksgiving 2011 and didnt have heavy cream, so I used half-n-half and it worked fine. Very creamy!

The recipe above only deserves 4 stars max BUT if you add at least 4 ounces more cream cheese and take away maybe 2-3 tablespoons of the pumpkin puree this recipe has 5 stars written all over it.  With the above additions it's light, airy, flavorful, tasty.  Be VERY careful not to over use the ginger in the crust mixture.  Also don't be lazy, the crust mixture takes all of 5 minutes to make, it's much better than store bought.  If you are going to go and follow a recipe, skipping out because you are lazy just takes away from the recipe and pride from the meal.

I made this for a girl's get-together and everyone loved it.  Had a bit of a disaster as in Tokyo brown sugar had clumps in them (sometimes the size of a dime) and since I was making it at night, I didn't have time to declump the sugar with a rolling pin.  As a result, my pie came out a little lumpy (as you can see from the photo).  But it hardly affected the taste and everyone raved about the crust.  

I did find the filling to be too much for a 9" pie plate so maybe next time I will make it in a 10" tart pan.  (I made the extra filling into crustless pies in mini souffle pans).

Pretty good recipe, although I used 2 packages of cream cheese and added 1/2c of white sugar because I like my cheesecakes sweet and not tangy. I could still taste the pumpkin, but it was a light, sweet taste and not the overwhelming bland pumpkin taste I've had using other recipes. I used the pre-made graham crusts and it made 2 pies. Everyone who tried it said it was delicious so I would definitely use this recipe again.

This has been my family's favorite pumpkin pie recipe for about 10 years now. The cream cheese adds richness without making it seem like a cheesecake. Make sure your cream cheese and sugar are very smooth before adding the other ingredients. If it looks lumpy, your cream cheese was too cool and you should wait a little while, then remix. I like to add a quarter teaspoon of cardamom and about 1.5 tsps cinnamon, and I omit the nuts in the crust and add a half cup extra cookie crumbs instead, since my daughter is allergic to nuts. This pie is usually the favorite one on our Thanksgiving table! It tastes great with homemade maple syrup flavored whipped cream.

As a 20 year old, no one really had any hope that this would turn out good for our thanksgiving dinner and my aunt even had store bought pumpkin pie as a standby but every one was pleasantly suprised. It was delicious and very easy to make. Perfect compromise for cheesecake and pumpkin pie lovers. The only change I made was I used ginger snap cookies for the crust and used 2 packages of cream cheese. I baked it for about an hour and then chilled it. Then I added a bit of cream frosting on top and garnished it with pumpkin shaped creme candies. Everyone asked for the recipe and wants me to make it again!

I made this for my family and it was a hit.  I used a ready made graham cracker crust.  The next time I will add some extra cream cheese for more of a cheesecake flavor.  All in all, a very good recipe.

I made the recipe as is. I followed the recipe to a T, and it did not turn out. The texture was great, but the flavor was like bland pumpkin. That's it. Spices need tweaking. I think it needs to be more sugary as well. I would use white sugar, but I don't want to try this recipe again.

Oh my, this was delicious! Definitely is more of a pie then a cheesecake. I used a store bought graham cracker crust, just because I had one. I also used fresh pumpkin. This was easy and made a beautifully set pie. Thanks!

Fantastic!!  It did require a bit more cooking time than the original recipe stated.  Give it plenty of time to chill in refrigerator. Also, I just used pumpkin pie spice (2 teaspoons total) in place of the spices listed.  At first my husband was disappointed that he was not going to get his traditional pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, however his mood dramatically changed when he had a slice of this pie :)

I did my "dry-run" pie this weekend. This pie came out great.  It tasted great.  I added an extra 2oz. of cream cheese because per some other reviewers that makes it more cheesecake-like. I brought into the office and everyone loved it.  I will be making another for thanksgiving this week.

Mmmmm... I could tell that this pie was going to be delicious after I taste-tested the batter. I brought the pie to a pre-Thanksgiving potluck and it was a huge hit with everyone, especially compared to the straight-up pumpkin pies with their overwhelming pumpkin spice flavors.  Fresh whipped cream garnish is a must!

I absolutely loved this pie.  It was my first time making a pumpking pie and it came out delicious and fluffy.  My best friend tried it and asked for the recipe.  She said it was the best pumpkin pie she had ever had.  I used a store bought crust so, it was real easy.  Thanks Carolyn!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and pumpkin lovers liked it.  The piecrust is great---different and tasty.  I added 3 extra tbsp of cream cheese because I love the taste and ended up baking the pie for 45 minutes.  A nice alternative to the traditional pumpkin pie.

I taste tested a similar pie at Costco, and was excited to find this one!  My kids and I have made it several times.  We have used the low-fat cream cheese and ready-made crust when in a hurry.
Thanks for the recipe, very yummy!!  Happy baking!

I decided to try this because I definitely do NOT like pumpkin pie, but my husband does. I do like cheesecake, so i thought this might be a good compromise. Am I ever glad I tried it! It was a definite hit, and a recipe to make over and over again! I followed the tips of others and used a little extra cream cheese, a little less pumpkin pie filling, and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the various spices. I also used silken tofu instead of eggs, as I have a child with a severe egg allergy, and this was a perfect substitution!
I used one pre-made store bought crust and one homemade crust as per the directions, and the filling recipe was enough to fill both. It was very wet, so I kept it in the oven an extra 10 mins and that helped. It also firmed up more with time and chilling in the fridge. I must say, the homemade crust was MUCH better than the store-bought. Store bought is fine in a pinch but no true replacement for the real deal. I gave one pie to my parents, who also loved and devoured it. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

First off let me say it is an understatement to say I love Pumpkin.  Its even a bigger understatement to say I love cheesecake.   To put both of these into one recipe leaves me speechless!   Only modification I made was to add an additional 4 oz of cream cheese.

I used this recipe in 2 crust miniature pies, along with a homemade crust, not graham cracker though. The recipe worked perfect, this is both a delicious pumpkin pie, and cheesecake. Try this out if you haven't yet.

This is a hit at Thanksgiving and Christmas. I have made it three times already and have been asked for the recipe by all my friends. The only thing that was a issue was my stove is older and it needed two hours to cook.

This was very easy and the best pumpkin cheesecake I've tasted.  It is great.  It does make more than a 9" pie.  Make extra crust and make two 8" pies.  We loved it as is.  We won't be changing this recipe at all.

I made this pie for a friend who has Celiac Disease and is gluten intolerant.  I made the crust with ground arrowroot cookies instead of flour.  It made it more like a graham cracker crust, but was really good anyway.  We were all really pleased with how this pie tasted.  Other than the crust, I didn't change a thing.

I have made this pumpkin filling several times and it always comes out super. I can't find graham crackers in Tokyo so I use butter-based pie crust recipe. For the filling, I reduce the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and lessen the salt accordingly. I double the cinnamon because I like this spicy. No, this is not a cheesecake recipe. But I think the cheese tastes more than a hint and complements the pumpkin and the spices wonderfully.

My boyfriend and I finished off this pie in about 2 days.  He prefers regular ol' pumpkin pie, but I like this version better.  The crust was great (I had whole pecans and crumbled them with a rolling pin, so there were little whole pits of pecan in the crust, which made it extra tasty).  You don't really taste the cream cheese in the filling, but it is a lighter, creamier filling than traditional pumpkin pie and I liked the spices in it.  Top it with whipped cream and it's a great pie!

For my first time making a pie, I think it turned out well! I used a store bought graham cracker crust and it turned out nicely. I found that I needed the full 45 minutes for baking. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, and used a 9-inch pie pan.  It was just enough for one pie with a little leftover that I baked in a ramekin.  Very delicious!  I will definitely make this one again.

This was so delicious. Mine didn't set quite as stiff as I would have liked but it might be because I used half and half instead of cream. The flavor is pumpkiney and wonderful!

The spices were spot on however I agree with other reviewers  that it could use more cream cheese and I had to let it bake an additional 15 minutes, shut the oven off and leave the door propped open a little for another 30 to 45 minutes more for it to set properly. It was very tasty and I will make it again. Thank you.

I’ve made this several times over the past few years and it has become a my signature Thanksgiving dessert. It’s perfect for people who don’t like pumpkin pie but enjoy other pumpkin dishes (pumpkin bread, pumpkin cookies, etc). I use 12 graham crackers when making the crust and serve it with homemade whipped cream. I make a star shaped pattern with a few whole pecans in the center of the pie. And for me it always needs an extra 15-20 minutes in the oven.

I made some changes based on other reviews as well and it was amazing. I doubled the crust and used a big springform (extend baking time) and added another half a package of cream cheese. Waiting for a bit then going for seconds.

This was absolutely delicious, but as others say, it is more like a pumpkin pie with a hint of cheesecake, I will definitely add more cream cheese next time, but as is, it may replace the pumpkin pie on my Thanksgiving table next year. I used my traditional crust as well. It is close enough to the traditional pumpkin pie that I could definitely do that! And we all always take a sliver of each and vote on the best, this kicked the traditional pumpkin pie's butt this year!!! (It's the top left, someday I may share my spiced apple pie recipe!)

It turned out more as a mousse than a cheesecake, and it was very pumpkin and non cream-cheesey. I made the following adjustments to suit my taste; I added a tablespoon of molasses, I added an extra half brick of cream cheese, and - because of my elevation (just under 6,000 feet) - I let it sit in the oven for increments of five minutes until about fifteen extra minutes had elapsed.

Great alternative to the plain jane pumpkin pie.  I made it with a gluten free crust and it turned out great! The pecans are a nice addition and add a bit of texture. Yummy!

Yum! This cheesecake pie was definitely a great combo of pumpkin and cheesecake, the best of both worlds! I especially liked that extra note of nuttiness from the nuts in the crust. I'm a big fan of cheesecake, so I doubled the cream cheese in the recipe and halved the pumpkin in the recipe with no compromise! A great fall dessert worth sharing with friends and family!

I Love, love this recipe.  I made 1 1/2 times the crust as my pie plate is quite deep but the filling amount was perfect.  I would not change a thing to this recipe other then the cooking time mine took nearly an hour longer!!! but I think that was mostly due to the deep pie dish.

This is a great recipe but i did make a few changes, i used 2 boxes of cream cheese (i wanted more of a cheesecake flavor) and used 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice.  You can of course use more or less to taste, it still had  a great pumpkin taste to it and everyone loved it.

This pie is delicious! I added about 1/3 cup of powdered sugar to the mixture to sweeten it up a bit (I had read some reviews that it wasn't as sweet as some other pies, and my husband and I like sugar!) It's true that it's cheesecake flavor is subtle. If you want a stronger cheesecake taste, you could add more cream cheese. I however, think the balance of pumpkin and cheesecake is perfect! Next time I will try baking it in one of those fantastic refrigerated roll-out pie crusts. You will enjoy this recipe!

I gave it a 4 because it was good but it wasnt quite cheesecake. It tasted more like a regular pumpkin pie with a slight difference. There was enough for 2 pies so I made one with nuts and one without. My husband finished the entire pie without nuts.

I was a bit disappointed, it didn't taste "pumpkinish" enough nor was it sweet enough and it definitely could use more spices. 
On the positive, it made more than one pie.

We have this cake every week almost ^_^
I still have not gotten tired of it, but I recommend using less pumpkin and more cream cheese.
Thanks for the recipe! I also recommend putting it in little tarts. Its fun for kids too!

Made this and loved it! And so did everyone else which is always a plus! I found that the center of the pie cracked after it was done cooking. I hear it's a common problem, but of course that doesn't affect the taste and that was my own error and nothing to do with this recipe. This is a must try recipe and people who hate regular pumpkin pie will still love this.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and I was impressed!  I haven't got any experience with pies or cheesecake and this was delightful to make and eat.  The nuts in the crust really add a unique flavor and texture.  Needless to say, I will be making this again!

This has become one of my favorite recipes for pies.  It's easy & quick to make.  I've already made it for 3 different occasions and everyone always ask for more.  I use 1 1/2 packages of Neufchatel cheese which makes the filling creamier.  Instead of using of all the spices on the list, I use pumpkin spice mix with some more cinnamon.  Also, I have to make 2 pie crusts b/c the filling is very airy.

I love traditional pumpkin pie, but this was a very delicious change--it was creamy, not tangy, and had a delicate pumpkin flavor. I used cardamom instead of ginger, and I used the new gingerbread flavored graham crackers for the crust and didn't add any nuts to the crust. Per other reviewers' suggestion, I added another 4 oz of cream cheese--I thought the texture and taste was just perfect. I am delighted to add this recipe to my favorites!

I didn't use the heavy cream, instead I used milk and powdered guar gum. I thought this was supposed to be a pumpkin cheesecake and I was surprised when I discovered it was more a pie (which isn't a bad thing!). I misunderstood what it said, but my parents still liked it. I will probably continue to search for a definete recipe that suits my taste, but it was very good for my first attempt! :)

I had never made a pumpkin pie until I made this one, and it is the only one I'll ever make!  It is a light, creamy pie, and you can really taste that it is homemade!  Everyone gobbles it up, and there is no messy springform pan to deal with like other cheesecakes!  YUMMY!

The flavor is excellent, but it takes forever to cook!  I don't know if it's my oven or what (it usually runs a bit hot, as a matter of fact), but it took a lot longer than the 45 minutes specified for the pie filling to set.

I normally am pretty apethetic to pumpkin pie, but this one is a pumpkin pie I could look forward to!  :)
