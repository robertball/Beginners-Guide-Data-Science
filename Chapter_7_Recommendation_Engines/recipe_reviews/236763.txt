I tried the recipe liked it, nice n crunchy. Second time I did some variation - replaced olive oil -used coconut oil. And added some sunflower seeds. Tasted much better and nuttier. This recipe will be part of my favorite recipe collection since my family also liked it.

I absolutely love this simple recipe. I saw a similar recipe from Elana's Pantry Almond flour cookbook that used dried rosemary as well. So I combined some of the ingredients from both recipes and created the tastiest cheddar cheese almond flour crackers; using fresh grated sharp cheddar cheese. The cheese also acts as another binder.  I love the idea of using flax seed in the crackers. That enhanced the nutty flavor as well. This is a great snack food by itself or with tuna or salmon salad. The pizza cutter worked very well for precise cutting. Thanks for sharing!

These are so good you can eat them just by themselves! Nice nutty flavor, though even better with cream cheese, smoked salmon, guacamole, you name it. Totally non-gluten and made for those with ketogenic or paleo diets in mind.

So good! I love the nutty flavor and they're so easy to make. I followed the recipe but added 1 TSP of dried rosemary to the dough. (I love the taste of rosemary.) The only downside is that almond flour is expensive. But the crackers are great.

I mixed everything in food processor, nuts first.  If you place dough on a silicone mat and only use parchment paper on top, it will be easier to roll out.  Not slipping around on the cookie sheet.  Delicious.  Great with hummus or cheese or alone!

I used ranch flavored sunflower seeds in place of walnuts and whole flax seeds instead of meal - put all the ingredients in a mini food processor, rolled with wooden skewers as a guide for perfect thickness. Excellent! Thanks Poppa

Didn't change a thing. These were terrific. I rolled some a little thinner than suggested. Those came out more like chips than crackers. I have had them with dip, cheese, and today I plan to top some crackers with smoked oysters in olive oil. Great tasting simple and easy recipe.

I can't get enough of these! I even made a version with some sugar, oat flour and cinnamon for a sweeter cracker. So yummy!

Loved it! Did make a few changes, used Psyllium instead of flax seed. No nuts, added rosemary and an 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper . Sprinkled sea salt on top prior to baking. Next round I'll do 1 tbs water and 1 tsb of another liquid, maybe lime/lemon juice. The possibilities are endless with this fabulous recipe.

So glad I found this!  It is an excellent way to use the almond meal left from making almond milk.  Super quick & easy.  I've added other spices & seeds (chia, rice protein powder, cayenne) and found it very versatile.  I prefer less salt than the recipe. They're delicious exactly according to the recipe as well as with these modifications.

Just love these, second time round I cut down on the salt for my personal taste, also followed someone else's bright idea and used a tortilla press, you do get some odd shapes :)

I love this cracker recipe! My toddler even ate them! It's like I'm eating the naughty crackers you get out of a store! They are so nutty and go great with guacamole! I did sub the flax for chia the walnuts for peanuts and the olive oil for coconut b/c that's what I had on hand. I also more than halfed the salt. I can't wait to try other variations!

I made these in my vitamix.  Just threw it all in and blended. They were great! I think next time I am going to substitute cashews and chia seeds and add some garlic powder and turmeric!

These crackers are great for low-carb dieters! I make a new batch about every two weeks, and usually double or even triple the recipe.  Love them with cream cheese, nut butters, brie, or just plain.  They are also good with cottage cheese or yogurt. I leave them in the oven a bit longer, about 18 minutes or so, to get them nice and brown and crispy. I also add sesame seeds and sometimes rosemary, Italian seasoning or basil.  Yummy!

Really easy and surprisingly good! You need to roll them out nice and thin to get a good crunch. I used garlic olive oil to make garlic-flavored crackers. So good!

Love these crackers!  My husband loves them as well.  I want to experiment with some spices and using infused oil.  I will definitely double the batch next time.  They go too quickly!  Make sure you roll them very thin.  I actually cooked mine longer than 15 minutes (about 20) to make sure they were all getting a little brown.  My cookie sheet is air insulated so that may be why they took a little longer.

Don't post often but this is so good I decided to share - husband is on the low carb kick & I'm a carb/bread/cracker lover  - added handful of crushed whole pumpkin seeds, spoonful of chia seeds, didn't have the recipe nuts so threw in sprinkling of pecans (crushed) - key is the rolling & browning on the edges  - next I will add some variants like shredded cheese, another batch with wasabi powder with woohoo! & seaweed/red pepper/sesame  sprinkles I can't wait - busy weekend ahead! Keeper in the recipe box thank you!!!!

Very yummy! I was wanting a cracker to eat with chocolate and fruit, so I substituted the olive oil for coconut oil and added some shredded coconut.

Perfect!!!!
My Papa Bear made these thrice because they were so good!
He added rosemary to the last batch.  
These are indeed  addictive and will definitely be a continued hit in our home.
Thanks  for sharing this recipe ;-)

Recipe works great and the flavor is ok. I add garlic powder, onion powder, Cajun seasoning, and paprika to the top of mine once rolled out and it’s fantastic. I’ve made this recipe about 7 times now. Husband loves them with his cheese.

Tastes really good, love the nutty flavor. Followed the directions except I ran out of walnuts so I used almonds instead. The crackers didn't turn out crispy, or maybe they're not meant to. Either way I still love it.

Esses biscoitos são realmente maravilhosos, com um sabor surpreendente, e essa receita ensina muito bem como faze-lo.
Adorei os produtos que foram utilizados, principalmente a farinha de amendoas, porque posso encontra-los com facilidade na loja Ingredientes Online..

The crackers are delicious.  The nutrition info posted cannot possibly be correct.  It says one serving is 36 calories and there are 5 servings in the recipe -- meaning a total of 180 calories in the recipe.  The 1 cup of almond flour in the recipe contains 640 calories.  The carbs are similarly incorrect.  I suspect the nutrition info posted is per cracker, but it would be nice if this were corrected.

I love...love...love these crackers. I used the 1/3cup pumpkin seeds and 2/3 cup almond flour along with the flaxseed flour that was called for and used my food processor. I also added 1 tablespoon of chia seeds.  These are great and so hard to not eat the whole batch! Thank you ever so much...

These are great little crackers! And easy to make. The flavor is so good all by themselves. I am going to eat them with tuna salad for my lunch; can’t wait!

These are so much better than the crackers that require an egg! There is nothing funky or strange about these crackers so that automatically wins it five stars. They are actually incredibly good and my husband declared that it’s one of the best things I’ve ever made (and he cannot tell a lie!). I added pumpkin seeds for a little extra crunch and used coconut oil. Mine were done at about 10 minutes so watch your oven. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very nice taste and texture but next time I will omit the salt.  I normally don't add salt nor sugar to my food so that may be why it was slightly  salty for my taste.  Definitely a keeper

I have made these several times and out of all of the Keto, low carb crackers these are by far my favorite. I have added flavorings such as taco and it always comes out awesome!!!

These crackers were absolutely delicious. Crunchy and “short”. I added rosemary and made no other changes. I cut 2 sheets of parchment paper the size of my baking sheet to use as a guide and rolled out the dough between them. If it gets too thin at the edges just lift the top sheet and use the bottom sheet to fold the dough back over itself, then reroll. This is also handy for squaring up the sides. Thanks for a great recipe!

I don’t eat grains, so these crackers are the best way to enjoy crackers without grains. Yum with avocado dip. I used 1/3 cup ground pumpkin seeds and 2/3 cup almond flour. Super easy to make.

So delicious! And it's keto/low carb. I'll probably be making these every few days. It's easy to switch out the nuts and seeds for different flavors. You can also mix in spices of your choice--garlic powder and Parmesan is my favorite.

These low carb crackers are outstanding! I made them exactly according to the recipe but baked them 5 minutes longer. I also made a second batch substituting 2 T of the almond flour for nutritional yeast, smoked salt for the salt and added about a 1/2 T fresh rosemary. They were good also, the possibilities are unlimited using herbs, chilies, etc. also really appreciated an earlier reviewers tip to use bamboo skewers as guides in rolling out a thin cracker. This worked perfectly.

Started a low carb diet but love my crackers.  So I tried this recipe and loved it.  Made it just as specified and they taste great.  Will read the other reviews and try some variations they suggest in the near future.  This is a keeper and I will be making them often.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I made the recipe as written. I agree with some that they were a little salty. I would reduce the salt next time. Also, I think I will omit the walnuts and add garlic powder and dried rosemary to change them up. Will definitely make them again!

Very tasty cracker. Followed the recipe exactly. I may have judged 1/16 inch too thin. My crackers seemed quite fragile, but didn't break apart when I ate them and melted in my mouth. I liked them a lot with hummus and guacamole.

So far these are my fav crackers to make. They never last long! I am not 100% in love with the taste so I want to play around with the ingredients a bit to see if I can get them either nuttier or or add cheddar cheese as one person mentioned. I always feel so accomplished when they come out as beautiful squares!

Boy I had my doubts, but this turned out just like the picture and gave me something to eat that is actually good for you but not so filling. I'm going to try it with different seeds and nuts to see how it turns out. Healthy good eating!!

Loved this recipe!  Got a 2 lb bag of almond flour for $13 at Sam's Club, so I was looking for almond flour recipes.  Tried this one.  I used black walnuts and loved the outcome.  After reading several reviews, I did reduce the salt a little.  The recipe does not call for Kosher Salt, it just says salt.  Since some salt (Kosher) has larger crystals, a teaspoon o that does not equal a teaspoon of table salt.  I used Kosher and made it a "light teaspoon" (not filled to the top) and it was fine.  Smallish recipe, I will probably double it next time to make more!!

Great cracker alternative!  I made them exactly as the recipe directed and they are delicious.  I'm diabetic and am always looking for a natural, low-carb "crunch" option.  These fit the bill.  I ate them plain right out of the oven, but imagine they'd be delicious topped with guacamole, smoked salmon/cream, or ricotta and diced fruit.   Thanks for an awesome recipe :)

Subtracting a star for the salt content (would recommend halving.)

Otherwise GREAT!  Super simple to make!

These were a hit! I used unsalted sunflower seeds instead of walnuts, and I added some crushed dried rosemary.  Everything else was as listed. I cooked 2 minutes longer, just because I like things extra crispy. I will definitely make these often!

Love that it's easy to make, low carb and gluten free. Good with cheese but bland by its self. I'll definitely make them again while I'm low carbing.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because it's too salty.

I used 1/3 pumpkin meal like the author suggested.  To flavor I used garlic salt and basil about a half teaspoon of each.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Very easy to make.   I plan on making this all the time.

Utterly divine! I lightly sprinkled the dough with Himalayan salt for a little punch. I will keep this as a staple.
