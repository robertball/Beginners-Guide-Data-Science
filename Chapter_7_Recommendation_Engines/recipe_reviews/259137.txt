This was so good! I halved the recipe and used a 8x8 glass dish and this took about 40 minutes too cook.  Super simple to throw together. I made it the morning of, not the night before, but it'd be such a time saver to prep and have it ready for the morning! Full of flavor for few ingredients. I used a little bet less cheese than called for and drained some of the excess grease that had pooled on the top.  For the non-keto eaters, I served it with fruit and toast, but for myself, the generous serving was more than enough!

I made this for our weekend guests. I used mild Italian sausage instead of breakfast sausage. It turned out awesome. So flavorful. You do not need any spices when using Italian sausage. It’s a keeper here.

I halfed the recipe using 8x8 pan for 40 min as another reviewer stated, as my house is just me.    I was really skeptical about the pound of cheese... but  made as stated.  This was very easy peasy, and yummy!   Nine servings so perfect for having around for those I am starving moments.   Will be making again, want to try with sage sausage or Herbes de Provence sprinkled on the sausage.  Thank you!

I absolutely love this recipe,  the only thing I added was finely chopped green pepper and onions to the sausage,  while frying.  It gave it a bit more flavor.

I used the basic recipe, but cut it in half and added a few things.  For a little extra flavor, I added diced red pepper, green pepper, and onion.  I added those AFTER the layer of egg and then continued laying the sausage, cheese, and cream as written.  I let it sit overnight, but wondered if putting a cold glass pan in a hot oven would explode.  So I just put the dish in the oven while it was preheating.  It still took the full 40 minutes to cook (AFTER reaching 350 degrees), even though it was in there during the preheating.  It turned out great.  Not runny at all with the added veggies.  After I plated it, I drizzled it with sriracha sauce.  It was very good!  I can see how this would be a great dish for tailgate parties or keto diets.  I didn't have that many people to feed, so cutting the recipe in half was definitely a good move.  We'll be making it again.

I made it at night for breakfast in the morning.  I cut the ingredients in half, I cooked turkey sausage, and used Colby Jack and mild cheddar cheeses.  I also cracked the eggs and scrambled in a bowl with a little pepper and salt before pouring it over.  It was done in 40 minutes.

Pretty darn good, only thing was it was a bit runny at the bottom of the pan, maybe cooking for an additional 15 minutes would rectify the problem. I’d make it again though. Good for my keto

Fantastic! I also only made half a pan and cooked it for 40 mins. I did lightly salt the eggs and used half hot/half not sausage. So easy and yummy!

We are a keto diet family and this is a staple. I have served it to company without saying it is keto friendly and get lots of unsolicited likes. I have made it as is many times but have also added sliced mushrooms and/or  green chilies to the meat mixture and it is also good.

Excellent Christmas morning breakfast! Everyone loved this.  I added the seasonings for the Breakfast Sausage recipe from this site to my sausage because I knew the sausage I bought didn't have a lot of flavor. I didn't use all the cheese and it was plenty cheesy.

This is a great, simple recipe. I made it exactly as written the first time and everyone loved it. I have since tried it with 1lb sausage, 1 lb bacon; still great! made with 1 lb sausage, 1 lb diced ham; still great! made with sausage and added sweet bell peppers; still great! Just understand that the quality of this dish depends on using good quality breakfast sausage.

I tried this with a twist that my family loved. I doubled the recipe and in place of one of the pounds of sausage used bacon. Absolute winner!

Made 2 of these for a church breakfast potluck.  

GONE!  In like record time!  I used a little more cream than called for, and on 1 I had added in some rotel.

Left it wrapped while cooking, 1 hour was almost enough with the modifications.  Unwrapped and baked for 15 minutes more for color!

Huge hit, will make again and again!

This is really yummy!! I made as instructed but cut it half like a couple of previous reviewers and baked for 40 minutes. My husband and our neighbor loved it. Will definitely be making it again! Next time I may try it with adding mushrooms, green onions, or roasted red peppers. It's really simple.

I followed the recipe to a T. It’s absolutely delicious. I baked it covered for 1 hour then 10 mins uncovered. I also drained the sausage in a colander to get rid of the moisture. Thank you

I made this just as written.  I didn’t care for the taste.  I even added sausage the next day.  Really did not have much flavor:(  I am thinking I might try this again but add veggies and some type of seasoning.

CHECK YOUR NUTRITION INFO!

I threw this together for an impromptu Keto breakfast and did not wait the 8 hours. The only change I made was to scramble up the eggs and cream and pour over the sausage. It was absolutely delicous!

Also, check your nutrition info... it may be vastly different than what is listed. I entered the actualy sausage, eggs and other ingredients that I bought on My Fitness Pal's Recipe guide and calories for a serving were 311 and fat was 26.6 g... much lowered than what is listed here!

Made this for a keto breakfast for myself. The whole family loved it. Only thing I changed was I used a variety of cheeses, Colby, cheddar, mozzarella. It was easy and delicious. It won’t last long.

Yes, I will definitely make again.  I made this for our MOPS moms (Mothers of Pre-Schoolers), and they loved it!  Most who had diet restrictions could also eat it.  The only changes that I made were to wisp the eggs a bit, and add the cream to the eggs (mix all together).  Also, I sautéed 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms in butter, drained and added a layer of the mushrooms.  This is not low fat, but it is very good.

I threw this together for an impromptu post-Thanksgiving breakfast for some family members. I didn’t have time to wait 8 hours and couldn’t imagine what would change if I made right away. Glad I don’t wait! In short - everyone loved it. Raved about it. I was the hero of the morning. I did throw in some mushrooms for flavor. As my sister said, it’s a good basic recipe that can be doctored up however you wish. It’s easy, quick, delicious - and crazy rich tasting. Plus, easy cleanup because there are so few pots and pans required to make it. I cut and wrapped the portions that were left over and will enjoy this for breakfast all week!

First review here.  Best recipe!  Like the addition of hot sausage by another reviewer.  This is a keeper!

This was very good!  I wasn't sure how much 2 lbs of cheese was so I used 2 cups of white cheddar.  Also instead of whipping cream I used half 'n half.  Everyone enjoyed it.

I reduced the recipe by half, while the sausage was browning I added 1/2 a small onion and 1:3 a green pepper. Everyone loved this egg bake, we served it for dinner with grated cheese, and salsa, fresh fruit and toast on the side.
This is a keeper!

I've now served this twice and it was a hit both times. The eggs are whole, which is very different. I used spicy sausage which gives the dish a little bit of a kick. Good for anyone on keto.
