I've been making this pie for my dad forever and he LOVES it! It rarely lasts the day, so I only make them on special occassions! The kids (9 and 6) say it's easy to make, and they have begun helping me make it! Thank You!!

I've never had a homemade raisin pie before, but I (and my company) found it overpoweringly sweet. I had a small piece and could hardly finish it. I also thought it should have solidified a little more. Next time I'll try a different recipe. Thanks anyway!

I traded some work for a pie.  When I asked what pie he wanted, he said Raisin Pie!  Oh, no...I had never even heard of Raisin Pie!  I found this recipe and tried it.  I substituted Splenda for sugar because he is diabetic.  It was easy and he loved it; said it was almost as good as his mother's.  I don't like raisins so didn't try it.

Great basic recipe!  I tweaked it a bit going off of other reviews...I decreased the water to 1 3/4 cups and increased the flour to 3 Tbsp. (make sure to whisk the ingredients in the saucepan to avoid lumps) Brought it to a bubble, let it simmer for 5 minutes, and then cooled it for 20 minutes stirring occasionally.  I decreased the oven temp to 400 degrees for the first 15 of baking and turned it down to 325 for an additional 20 minutes watching the edge of the crust for over browning and then let it cool for 45 minutes. Turned out awesome!  The filling was a perfect consistency and had a great flavor!  Will make this again!

I made this pie as written & my partner loved it! The next time I made it I changed it up a bit: instead of flour I used cornstarch1/3 cup sugar. I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. cloves & 1/8 tsp nutmeg. I have made a lot of these to sell at the Farmer's Market & it doesn't matter which version they fly off the table! I have also made this using stevia or splenda & it sells out every time

Haven’t had a raisin pie since I was a child...not as good as Grammie’s was but it was good...no complaints from the peanut gallery, yet and only one piece left...lolI used an “oat crumble” topping instead of the second crust...I had some left over this morning from an apple crumble :)

Can't go wrong with this classic. My father loves raisin pie. Good luck finding raisin pie anywhere. Sure, raisin creme can be found (sometimes) but that just isn't the same. So I make this incredibly simple pie at all of the holidays specifically for my father.  Unbeknownst to him, I do use Splenda baking blend instead of regular sugar and he never notices. I have also experimented with different crust that use nut flours with varying degrees of success.

I’ve made this several times. It’s the best as far as setting up and sweetness. My dad also LOVES raisin pie. I add a sprinkle of Allspice and cloves and a tiny bit of cinnamon and nutmeg. I also add a splash of rum making a Spiced Rum Raisin Pie. It’s amazing. Yummy for sure.

Fabulous...just like my mother used to make.  I took one of the 'reviewers' complaints to heart - pie being a bit runny - I just added 1-2 more tablespoons of flour and it was just as we liked it.

My boyfriend said it was fantastic!  This was my first attempt (had never even heard of raisin pie) and it came out great!  I did not put a top crust on mine as his Mom said she doesn't do that.
