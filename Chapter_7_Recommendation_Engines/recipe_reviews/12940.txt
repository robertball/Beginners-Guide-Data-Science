not too bad, but two items of thought.  Traditional Louisiana Gumbo does not contain tomato sauce and it does contain a roux.  The dark grey chocolate-esque look of traditional gumbo and the deep flavor of a roux cannot be duplicated with tomato sauce :)  Keep the file in it, but use a roux as a deep thickeningagent instead of the tomato sauce.  Also add okra :)  NOTE:  DO not add the File powder until the gumbo is done cooking and right before serving. File becomes distasteful when cooked and also doesn't keep well.  Only add it into individual servings right before going to the table.

The stock this recipe uses is great, but this recipe isn't as good.  Real gumbo uses a roux as dark as a beer bottle, not tomato sauce.

This recipes takes a while to make, but it is sure worth it!!  I've gotten rave reviews from many people who usually don't enjoy seafood.  I put shimp, clams, crab, mussels, and oysters in my version and it is wonderful!!!!

Excellent gumbo recipe.  I'd also like to mention in reply to LASTMANG0 above, this is a traditional 'Creole' gumbo, which do usually contain tomato, and don't use a roux at all.  Cajun gumbo uses a roux (usually a very dark one).

Great recipe! To the couple of people who said that gumbo "must have roux" or "doesn't have tomato sauce"... I have lived in Louisiana and I have Cajun and French relatives and those statements are not true. There is a "red gumbo" and a "brown gumbo".

I made this gumbo for a large group that I was cooking dinner for and it received rave reviews from EVERYONE!  It does take a long time to make but it is well worth the effort.  My version had crawfish, shrimp and crabmeat.  I did have a lot of difficulty finding the file powder, so make sure you find it before taking on this recipe.

I added some squid and 1 pound of turkey sausage. I also substituted black pepper for the white pepper powder (a little carton of white pepper cost 4 bucks, while black pepper costs 69 cents. See my point?). I also served long grain white rice on top of this. It was great.

Very yummy tasting, my hubby would've liked more texture to his vegatables. I chopped them on the finer side (my fault). We used a mixed seafood bag that had squid, mussels, shirmp etc. Few leftovers. Thanks

This was wonderful! Time got away from me and I had to use organic veg. broth. I added a couple of pinches of cloves to the broth after seeing that the Seafood Gumbo Stock recipe by Sara used it. We added 1/2 tsp file powder to the bowls of soup. File powder can become stringy if boiled. I am looking forward to making this again with Sara's stock recipe.

This is easily a 5 star recipe.  I couldn't find file powder anywhere at my grocery store, so I made a four roux instead, and it worked fine, I also subbed chicken stock for fish stock, since I couldn't find that either.  I also added sliced smoked sausage, and omitted the white pepper. I followed the rest of the recipe to a "T" and wouldn't change a thing. It was delicious, and didn't make it to the leftover phase.  A real crowd pleaser.

This is so good, and I was worried about the amount of grease but after you add the shrimp, crabmeat and rice, you really don't taste it. I didn't used white pepper and I didn't crush the bay leaf. I left out celery ( personal taste ) and I used 1/4 green bell pepper and a whole red bell pepper, I used seafood broth, no oysters but I used crab meat and that overpowered the shrimp a bit. I made brown rice to serve over it. It's really more of a effutae than a gumbo but it still makes a good meal.

I made this recipe for my christmas gathering.  It was a hit!!! I have never attempted to make gumbo before, and now I feel confident in saying that I can.  My guests loved it.  I didn't add the file, but had it out for anyone who wanted to add it to their own dishes.  I loved it.

Good recipe except for one thing. Add the file' to INDIVIDUAL bowls of gumbo. NEVER EVER cook file' as it will make the file' tough and destroy its delicate flavor.

Great Recipe.  I do not do much Cajun cooking myself, nor does my family eat it very often, so I don’t have anything to compare this to, but all I can say for sure is that everyone loved it (except my son, who thought it was too spicy).  I did tweak the recipe a bit to accommodate what I had on hand: first, I omitted the oil altogether and added salt to the veggies so they would sweat a bit and not burn, second, I used chicken stock instead of fish stock, third, I used scallops instead of shrimp, and fourth, I didn’t have oysters, but I did have light smoked sausage, so I added that in its place.  I know this sounds like a lot of changes, and it was…but for me not knowing how to make gumbo, this served as a great starting point.  So, thank you Sara for the recipe and the inspiration!

Excellent!  This thickened up so nicely, so it was great over rice as well as *soup* as leftovers.  I'll certainly be making this again.

We substituted coconut oil and chicken broth for fish stock, along with some Pontchartrain blue crabs. This recipe is amazing!!! We didn't know what to expect, but WOW, this is well worth trying. The tomato sauce and spices makes that very dark color gravy like working for hours to make roux. Now I've had both. This is great. Many thanks for this recipe.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone enjoyed this gumbo. Born and raised in New Orleans, so I have a hard crowd to.please.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  This is a Creole gumbo since it uses tomato. Cajun gumbo uses a rue.  It is a recipe, use what you like and take out what you don't.  Used whole cleaned crabs and claws in this one with the shrimp and oysters. Will make this again and again.

I love it, my family loved it! I have to be honest I needed to add more "flavor" because it just wasn't spicy enough for my family. I will definitely make it again adding more spices & herbs. Great base to start with.

This is a really good recipe. I'm a firm believer in using a roux, so I made one for this (nice and dark!). I also let my gumbo simmer on LOW for about 45 minutes after adding the seafood. This is what allows the flavors to really mingle (as long as it's done on low you shouldn't have to worry about overcooked seafood). Other than those changes, I followed the recipe as given. This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe... if you substitute some creole traditions.  Take the time to make a roux instead of using the oil and tomato paste.  A roux only takes an extra fifteen to twenty minutes to make and will add a depth of flavor lacking in this recipe's instructions.  

And I agree to add the file on the dish after it's been served.  It should be used to taste--in the gumbo it creates an odd flavor that's not that appetizing.  I couldn't find oysters, so I made mine with shrimp, scallops and crab claw meat.  The spice ratio is great, and the cooking time is also more or less spot-on.  Aside from the modifications, this is a very good gumbo.

Loved it as a base used loads of shrimp crab meat and clustered crabs didn't use file powder used a spice mixture and instead of hot pepper sauce used tiger sauce best gumbo ever!

Great recipe!  I added 2# shrimp and a package of Andouille sausage.  I will added about a cup of green onions at the end too.

This is a good gumbo recipe. The only thing I added and it made a huge taste difference was cajun link sausage.  I didn't have a drop leftover.

This gumbo was very flavorful but the 3/4 cup of oil was way too much, and next time I make it, I won't use canned crab--it kind of disappeared in the mix!

I added 3 cans of sauce and 2 cans of sliced stewed tomatoes...with a lot more onion, celery and bell pepper.  It is always a hit.

I made this gumbo for a tailgate party this past fall, and it was a huge hit.  I made the base, then added the seafood right before serving.  I couldn't find file powder, so I made a roux instead.  I also added frozen okra.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe may or may not be good... shrimp, oysters, tomato sauce? (I used diced), fish stock are not on the ingredient list. I guessed at the amounts and it came out fair.

I started with a nut brown roux and used chicken instead of crab.  I also substituted Rotel for tomato sauce.   Great flavor and the roux added a thicker texture.  I will make it again.

I made this as my first time making gumbo. So good I don't think I'm even going to try and make another recipe. I added fresh grown cut up tomatoes, went heavy on hot sauce and white pepper. I like it spicy and then added okra and way more seafood because I like seafood too. I ate all most of it myself froze the rest. Was ok reheated, I ate 4 reheated bowls...

It was great. May be too much hot sauce or ceyanne pepper. I will add less next time. I used half of everything for just two people. Also added a tilapia filet. I definitely plan on making it again.

I spent 2 hours and 3 different grocery stores to find this so called "Gumbo File Powder" and it was the bitter taste from this powder, alongside with the extreme spice made this dish a NO GO. I am a huge fan of allrecipes, and all my recipes come from here. This is my first and only bad recipe from here....and it was really bad. It was made worse by the fact that I spent $50 on various seafood.

Never saw a gumbo made without a roux.  Good just not gumbo. I used pablano peppers instead of bells, because we light to added spice.

I made this by the recipe except I had no file or fish stock. So I use organic beef stock and it turned out nice. I have Cajun friends and they say you can use a roux or tomato sauce which ever is tyo your liking. I used a bit of both.

I only have it 2 stars because my dad liked it.  he was the only one who liked it.  it was way too soupy (too much liquid) I followed recipe exactly, and even though it had many ingredients,  it was very bland.  the pictures look yummy,  but it was very dissapointing.

I made this gumbo twice. My family loved it. I couldn’t find file power locally so I use fresh okra instead. Outside of that I followed the recipe. I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana and yes this does not start with a Roux. But it's easy and good.

Yum! File powder is not readily available in the stores by me, so I added approximately 1/3 cup brown rice flower before adding the liquid, and that helped to thicken it up! I add uncooked shrimp and bay scallops when it is done and cover for 5 minutes, then serve it over brown rice.

I made this last night with a few adjustments (not because I'm fancy, I'm just not great at cooking). I couldn't find file power so none of that. I used scallops instead of oysters, along with the strimp and crab. I also added 1 cup of white rice. It came out great! I'm super proud of myself :)

Delicious!! Because I have young kids, I toned down the hot spices a bit, but this is a rich, delicious stew that freezes well. Obviously, the types of seafood you put in are also amenable to modification.
