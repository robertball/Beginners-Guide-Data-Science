Bars, to me, have a crust on the bottom.  I would call this pumpkin cake because they do not (which I unfortunately found out too late.).  Also please include regular baking time. Stating in the comments that you used a convection oven leaves the rest of us having to experiment ,which is not what I wanted to do the day before Thanksgiving, LOL.

This was great! I had the necessary flours and baked it in a conventional oven for 45 minutes. Nobody knows itâ€™s gluten free, except for those who need to know!
