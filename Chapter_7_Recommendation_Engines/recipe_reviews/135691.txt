Used a meat tenderizer to poke holes in the meat and then marinated for about 4 hours.  While the meat cooked on the grill, I cooked down the marinade and added a cornstarch slurry to make a nice sauce.  Totally full of flavor and pretty darn healthy for you, too.  We enjoyed this and will be making again.

This marinade was fantastic and had great flavour!  I think the key to the flavour not being lost is to slice the tenderlion into 1 inch medallions before putting it in the marinade.  I only used 1/2 the recipe and there was plenty of marinade to coat all the meat in a large bag.  If you slice your pork (or chicken would be great to)o, I would only marinade for 3-5 hours since the lime and orange slightly cooks the meat.  Cook the medallions on medium heat 3-4 minutes per side or until the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F and let it rest for 5 minutes to reach a final 160 degrees F.  I did a rough chop of the meat and served in corn tortillas for a mexican dinner.

A lot of the flavor goes away through the high-heat grilling. I could taste a little of the marinade on the outer edges, but it's a little too toasty. I think the marinade is a good collection of ingredients, but should probably be slowly grilled while wrapped in aluminum foil tightly, so the moisture's locked in with the meat and cooks throughout.

Family favorite. Following the recipe as is makes an amazing dinner! I've also made other variations of this with chicken or slightly different ingredients based on what we have. It is ALWAYS great!

I used this marinade in a grill-off with my dad and it gave me the win! I added a little bit extra of everything and soaked a whole pork loin overnight. I grilled the pork loin over indirect heat for a nice and slow cook. I also basted the pork loin with some extra marinade while it cooked. It was delicious and added great flavor. It also browned beautifully over the meat.

Great for pork fajitas. I marinated pork loin after cutting into fajita-size pieces. Only had time to marinate for an hour, then saut√©ed stovetop with a little olive oil. I didn't have cilantro, but the flavors were great anyway.

Made for guests and we all really enjoyed. I did forget to buy cilantro which would have been a good addition.  Used fresh parsley instead as a garnish. Otherwise I made it exactly as the recipe with the overnight marinating.  Served with broccoli rice and a green salad.

I took a large pork loin and split it into two halves and cut them each in half. I also doubled the marinade and marinated the meat 4 hours, then cooked down the marinade to thicken it. On a charcoal grille, I got the coals good and hot and sprinkled apple wood chips over the top, then quickly added the meat and closed the lid and vents. That creates a heavy smoke. After twenty minutes, l opened the lid and turned the meat. Using the grille lid and vents, I kept the temp at around 275 and cooked the meat for an hour, turning it often and basting it with the cooked down marinade. It was a hit.

It was a very good marinade. I don't have a grill so I used in in the crock pot after marinading for 24 hours. The only negative was that it called for too much chili powder. It over-powered the finished product.

I agree with a previous post, cut the tenderloin in 1 inch pieces to have the marinade flavor more intensely! Yummy!

It might be that the pork loins were too small in circumference, but one of them was a bit dry. Also, it wasn't very spicy, so in future I'd use more than two serrano peppers.

This recipe was great, perfect for 1lb pork tenderloins, two of them that is. Only marinated them for 8 hours but basted the tenderloins with the marinade over a charcoal grill. Great flavor

i didn't have tequila and kept it rather mild, but my goodness was this good!  It was also middle of winter so I seared it on both sides and then cooked it in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes, or until it was 160 degrees.

I made this pork tenderloin as shown in the recipe. Unfortunately life got in the way and it wound up sitting in the marinade for over 18 hours before I had a chance to get it on the grill. The result was a perfectly cooked pork loin with an unbelievably strong lime taste. Next time I make it I will make sure it marinates no more then 8 hour.

This recipe is a keeper. However I plan to reduce the amount of chili powder next time I make it as it was a bit overbearing.  The pork was moist and tender.

Really disappointing. I poked holes in my tenderloins and marinated for over a day, and the flavor still just wasn't there. It wasn't bad, but it didn't taste like lime or tequila, and I can think of a few better things to make with those.

This is a great recipe, it‚Äôs good with tenderloin, but try doubling the orange juice, and then having ham steaks marinade in it.  We did this for Christmas, and it was incredible.  Then we took the marinade, boiled it down on the stove and made a sauce for the ham.  It was delicious.  A favorite already!!

Our family liked it. I would recommend turning down the heat on the grill. As for the marinade I thought it was a great blend of flavors, however when ate it it tasted more like lime with a hint  of chili powder. If I make it again I would tone down the amount of lime juice used.

Instead of grilling, I cubed the pork and after browning it, simmered in skillet with marinade until it was done and the marinade absorbed.  Very flavorful.

Very flavorful marinade and the pork turned out juicy and tender.  We roasted in the oven at 400 for about 20-25 minutes.  The kids  wanted seconds!
