Thought I'd try it since my husband's has diabetes, and the cinnamon is good for that. It came out really good.

Delicious!  Made as is.  It sure made the house smell good too.  My husband has rheumatoid arthritis and cinnamon is a natural anti inflammatory.  He said not only did it taste great but helped him feel better too.  Win/win.

Instead of making it in the oven I grilled the chicken. 4 1/2 minutes a side. This allowed for a nice bbq sauce like flavor that popped.
I served it with steamed veggies coated with ranch dressing mix.

I planned to make the Buttery Quinoa dish that called for “grilled chicken” but no instructions for flavoring. Since the quinoa dish required fresh lemon juice, I looked for a rub that used it as well. I used fresh lemon juice instead of lemon pepper, fresh chopped thyme instead of dry, and grilled instead of baked. Delicious! The cinnamon made the chicken stand out from the tastes in the quinoa.
