The recipe, as shown, calls for 32 oz. of beef stock.  This makes it much too soupy.  I used about 10 oz. and added a small can of tomato paste toward the end to make it more like a sauce.
Poured it over small shells pasta.
Tastes terrific!  Highly recommended.

Great flavor, but the artichokes (which I doubled) got so mushy; they had absolutely no texture or flavor. The olives managed to hold their texture, but they also lost their flavor. Next time, I'll add more herbs, and I won't add the artichokes and olives till the last hour.

Loved. Made as is but did add artichokes and olives an hour before being done. It is very soupy the way it's listed to be made. I ate it as soup. Use much less liquid if you want to use it over pasta. Very good.

This is absolutely delicious, but I gave it only 3 stars because the amount of liquid called for is about three times too much. There's no way you achieved what's in the photo with that much liquid. Next time I'll use a 10 oz can of beef broth and an 8 oz can of tomato paste. You can always add a bit of water if it begins to look dry near the end of the cooking time. I also agree with others that you need to add the artichokes and olives an hour before it's done. If you use less liquid, adjust the spices accordingly to about half what is called for. I'll make this again, my way.

Yum! This is a delicious dinner. I used fresh artichokes (including the stems) and fresh herbs. I sautéed the onion with the beef while it was browning.  I cooked everything on high for three hours. The meat was so tender and the sauce this recipe creates is fantastic.  Leftovers made an excellent sauce for pasta. Thank you for the recipe.

This turned out great but after reading some of the reviews, I did make a few modifications. I decided to use half the beef broth as almost all of the reviews I read, said there was way too much broth. A few reviews also said that the olives and artichokes had little or no flavor. So I decided to test it myself. I split the olives and artichokes in half and put 1 half in the beginning on top of the meat as the recipes directs to and the remanding half about 15 minutes before it was done. The olives and artichokes that I put it n onto the meat or n the beginning did have no taste but the ones I put in at the end did. This dish is amazing and thank you for it!!

I was waffling between this and another recipe to use a huge beef chuck roast I found on sale. Made very few adjustments to this that were ideas I picked up from the other recipe. Coated the roast in kosher salt, pepper, then flour before browning in olive oil. Then cut up into pretty large chunks and put in crock pot. Topped with onion and garlic as directed, but added extra artichokes and kalamata olives. Sauce, tomatoes, and spices all same, except skipped the beef broth and added just a can (about 1-1/2 cups) of Cabernet. Meant to cook on low for five hours but accidentally left it on high! Still turned out fine. Just fished out the meat to the surface and shredded with two forks. This is NOT too much liquid once meat is shredded and all mixed up with extra helpings of artichokes and olives. Served over pipe rigate pasta (short curved tubes are good for holding the sauce). Amazing flavor with wine and olives. Making this again and again!

Wayyyyy too much liquid. Waters down the spices. Would consider half the beef stock, and maybe some lentils to thicken it.

Good taste, but way too soupy. I cooked pasta to put the stew over, but it was not thick as I had hoped. Should be named 'soup', not 'stew'. Otherwise, tasted very good.

Used olive oil, quartered artichokes, and 3/4 of the beef stock.  I did thicken sauce at end with cornstarch and served with mashed potatoes.  My husband and I loved the flavor and will make again and again.  Oh also I cut a chuck roast up instead of stew beef.   Thanks for the recipe JennaBee

Would never had made this if I’d known it was ‘soup’?  Not as pictured for sure. Certainly could not serve over pasta.  Don’t make it!

Very tasty. I also reduced the amount of beef stock to about half the recipe called for. Still a bit wet. Served with Mediterranean cauliflower. If I make it again, I'd reduce the stock a bit more and increase the artichokes and olives. Still, very good!

I’m new to cooking. My husband cooked in order to facilitate my career and now, post-retirement, I’m on kitchen duty. Goal is to find 5 really good dinners and this one made the cut. Very tasty!  I followed several recommendations and cut back on the broth. I used capers instead of olives (I detest olives), and added a second can of artichokes at the end. Served it with roasted red potatoes. The meal was a five star. Thanks AR.

Being that I made this on a Sunday morning, there may or my not have been a slight hangover and a Bloody Mary consumed during preparation. Browning the meat made my kitchen smell so good I decided to pour the oil and pan scrapings over the onions before going to the next step. A must. Cheers!

Good.  Thanks yen, Steve VB, and Buckwheat Queen for your suggestions; brown beef with onions, use 10oz of beef broth and add small can tomato paste and artichokes and olives 30+ minutes at the end. Needs pepper! Hubs would prefer penne or rice over shells.

Made this last night slow cooked it in a skillet about 2 hrs. Used 3 tsp Italian seasoning, no sauce just added diced tomatoes instead. By simmering that long most of the liquid evaporated  Didn't add artichokes until end of cooking. Also didn't add olives at all. Was very tasty. Will make again

We gave this a 4 because of the excellent flavor.   I've served this twice and had trouble with getting the consistency right.  The first time I followed the recipe and ended up with soup that I served in bowls.  The second time I used 1 cup less liquid. It still was soupy. I  thickened it with mashed potatoe flakes, but we could taste the texture of the flakes. I served it over whole wheat wide pasta noodles. The taste was excellent with the noodles. The next time I   make it, I plan to cut the liquid by half.

Excellent flavor, I added crushed red pepper flakes, cinnamon and ground coriander. Instead of stew meat I had a roast and cut it up after slow cooking.

Used chuck roast on sale and cut into a few pieces.  Delicious flavor .  I did not use the beef broth after reading the reviews and it was perfect.  Leftovers are even better.  Added olives and artichokes an hour or so before eating. Very easy.

Used chuck roast on sale and cut into a few pieces.  Delicious flavor .  I did not use the beef broth after reading the reviews and it was perfect.  Leftovers are even better.  Added olives and artichokes an hour or so before eating. Very easy.

I added a can of tomato paste. Only used 1.2 lbs beef, 3/4 of the carton of beef broth. I did this in the instant pot instead of slow cooker. Sauté function on instant pot, heat oil and brown meat. Turn off sauté. Add all ingredients except artichoke and olives. Press meat setting on instant pot, close lock and dial to 15 minutes. Let it naturally release for 10 minutes, then manually release. Add drained artichokes and olives. Lock pot again, set on 5 minutes. 10 minute natural release.

Delicious! Added less broth and put artichokes and olives toward the end. Added extra cumin. 
Over rice... fantastical!

I took advice from the reviews. Did not add the artichokes and olives until the last hour. I also took the drained juice from the artichokes & olives and added beef broth to use to make rice. Also added 10 oz can of Tomato Paste instead of sauce. It was very delicious.

This beef stew is so easy and so delicious. I only used 16floz of beef stock and it was still a soup, but an amazing, slurpable, delicious soup. I added the artichoke and olives after 6 hours as others suggested and it turned out fabulous. I also use beef chuck roast cut into 2x2in chunks in any recipe that calls for stew meat.

Thanks to reading many other reviews, I cut the amount of beef broth down to 8 oz, and even drained the canned tomatoes a little bit to cut down on the amount of liquid. It turned out great, very flavorful, and my family loved it.

In my review I forgot to say that I did not add any beef broth, just 2 cans of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce (I increased all ingredients by 50%), and the it was perfect over rotini pasta..

My wife loved it! happy wife happy life they say. I used on 10 oz of beef broth and could have even used less. Also I added artichokes and olives at the end. Do not cut up the artichokes  to small. 

Served it over home made pasta. It was delicious!

I made this after reading a lot of the reviews.  I only put in about 10 oz of beef broth and that was enough.  Other than that I made it according to the recipe and it turned out great.  Everyone liked it and we'll be making it again.

I added fresh mushrooms and I doubled the olives and artichokes.  Also, I felt that it needed a punch, so I added cayenne pepper,   Since I'm on Keto, I aso put in a few servings of Shirataki spaghetti, which soaked up the deliciousness of the sauce.  As advised by others that have tried this recipe, I halved the broth.   Some fresh basil on top added a nice touch.  I bought a 7 quart crockpot yesterday and  started cooking in it before noon.  Although I ate some around 8pm, it really wasn't ready until this morning!  Next time I will make it with a better cut of meat.

Awesome!  Agree with the reviews on the amount of liquid.  I came up with a solution: make the rice with broth from the slow cooker.  I was able to cook about 2 1/2 cups of rice in the rice cooker.  I just added the amount of rice I was able to and added beef broth to "round up"... I did this when I added the artichokes and the olives 1 hour prior to being done...

I give this 3 stars and will piggy back in everyone else’s reviews regarding the amount of liquid. I put 10oz beef broth and was shocked at how soupy/watery it came out. I can’t imagine what it would look like with the recommended 32oz. You could even get away with 8oz and be fine

I made this with my husband today and it was great!  I was a little concerned with some of the comments, so I substituted a can of tomato paste for the tomato sauce and only added 2 cups of the beef broth. We served it over bow ties.   I think we may try it as a one pot meal and add the pasta using the full amount of broth next time.

To feed more, doubled the recipe, except single-recipe amount of broth/stock. Still a bit soupy, so added cornstarch at end, to thicken. To account for picky/texture eaters, prepared veggies separately, using sauce as base & added a can of sliced mushrooms. Served over rice & offered shredded cheese as option. Next time, I will reduce the liquid more & possibly add fresh zucchini to the veggie mix. (& I will remember to take pics.)

I made this and agree with the one reviewer that there’s way to much liquid. The taste is so-so, don’t think it will be a do over for me. If so I’d change the amount of liquid and add a tomato paste instead of a sauce. I’ll thicken this with corn starch and serve it over rice. Not a winner for me!!

There was a lot of broth. So I took half a box of rigatoni and added them the last thirty minutes to the crockpot which absorbed the juice. A little parmesan cheese and I had a nice pasta dinner

I  really want to give this 3.5 stars.  It was just fine.  I prepared it  as described, noting others' comments to add artichokes and olives later so that they don't  get mushy. The sauce was delicous and rich, but  the dish itself needed something.  Maybe red wine?  I also think it would be improved by adding  some  carrots or mushrooms.

Instead of artichokes and olives, this is great with eggplant and red or green peppers and 1/2 the beef broth and a small can of tomato paste.  Really delicious!

I made this once for my husband and me (We both work but love nice food so this worked out well) and another time for my parents. Both times it was excellent. The second time, it was a double recipe and I only used the broth for one normal recipe, and I liked that better, as it helped make it more like a stew and less like soup.

Not enough flavor for me. Tasted kinda bland. Maybe double the spices?

I didn't know that the artichokes have to be peeled out before cook :( 
Beside that the recipe is good.

This one tasted very good, but unfortunately left us both with extremely dry mouths overnight.  Thinking about it, so many ingredients are out of cans ... which, of course, really makes the recipe with high sodium content.  Add on to that the artichokes which had been in brine (even though drained) ... we would not have this again due to very high sodium.

Excellent flavors, easy to assemble, and very eye-pleasing.  I will make this again, and serve to a crowd.   I made the recipe exactly as indicated.  Next time I might add even more Mediterranean flavor with an anchovies or two.
