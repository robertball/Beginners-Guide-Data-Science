I wanted to love it, but I found the ratios to not work well. It would have helped to know how many cups of pulp should have come from the pineapple/carrots. I used currants instead of raisins (since they're smaller, my family likes them better in baked goods). Ultimately by the time I combined the wet and dry ingredients it seemed too wet and too pulpy, but I decided to give it a go. The first dozen muffins were way too wet and didn't rise at all. I added a full additional cup of flour and a half tsp of baking powder to the batter after the first dozen. The second ones rose a little better and were less wet, but I ended up with a total of 29 regular sized muffins from this recipe. Since it says it makes 16 large muffins, based on that alone, I'd say somewhere along the line I ended up with nearly double the pulp and would have fared better with more flour. The muffins are barely sweet and packed with nutrition, but ultimately they're a little too pulpy and too dense to pass the family test. I'll try something like this again, but I did not fare well with the ratios in this particular recipe. I've eaten a few of the muffins and they're okay, but I don't think anyone else likes them well enough to eat them. Try another recipe.
