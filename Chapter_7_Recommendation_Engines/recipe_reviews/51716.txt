i have made this dish many many times. my grandmother brought it home from philipines when my grandfather was in the war. but instead i only use ground beef, green peppers and onions, and i bake them in the oven at 325 for about 10 mins helps reduce the amount of oil. i never have leftovers when i make this.

Try adding a tablesoon of flour to the mixture before you rool it up. It will help hold the veggie mix together while rolling and during cooking.

Try to add shrimp for more better flavor instead beef.You had ground pork already so change the beef to shrimp for more good flavor.

I only give this a 3 because I find that if you cook the meat prior to frying the lumpia it makes the meat more dry than if you just roll it raw.  I prefer to mix all my ingredients and then use about a heaping tablespoon (spoon, not measuring device) to put onto my lumpia wrapper, roll it, then freeze or fry it.

We have made these several times. Easy once you get the hang of it, and baking them turned out just as well.

Yummy! I feel like there's a LOT of meat in the lumpia, and the recipe makes way more than 40, but otherwise they are yummy!
