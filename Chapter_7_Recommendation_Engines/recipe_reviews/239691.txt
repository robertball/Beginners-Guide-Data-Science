Easy to make and very good. I added rosemary because I couldn't resist. I didn't have the Dijon so I used the honey mustard, but still added more honey.

This was very bland. I thought the soup mix would be more flavorful but it was just ok. We actually sprinkled some brown sugar on top to give it some sweetness. Made it better but still ok. I followed the recipe exactly except for the cooking method - I put everything in the slow cooker.

Followed the recipe, except for the onion soup (didnâ€™t have any in stock). I used a cop of low sodium beef stock I had on hand, which came out fairly well.

Because my husband does not like mustard, I left that out and I served the pork dinner with boiled potatoes instead of the mashed potatoes that was suggested.  The pork was delicious.
