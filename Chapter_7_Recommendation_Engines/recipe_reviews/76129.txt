Oh my, but this was good.  I did make a few changes (of course).  My husband expects MEAT on his dinner plate, so I squeezed the innards out of a couple of large-ish hot Italian sausages and browned it up in a tiny bit of EVOO.  Then I added some sliced fresh crimini mushrooms that needed to be used up.  My canned tomatoes were the plain, common garden variety, so I threw in some chopped onion and minced garlic.  Deglazed the pan with some white wine and used more spinach than called for.  An entire bunch, actually.  The DH has placed a moritorium on me buying anything new to stuff into my over-burdened freezer, so I had to use a bag of frozen three-cheese ravioli instead of the tortellini.  But hey, it's the same thing, only flat, right?  Also I didn't have any whole milk, so I had to use non-fat, but it didn't seem to hurt anything.  This was fantastic!  The sausage and mushrooms gave the sauce a nice beigey color.  I'm sure it would have been prettier with the tortellini, but I had to make do.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for company last night and it was a huge success!  I added diced chicken breasts sauteed with garlic, basil, and rosemary in olive oil.  For the sauce, I sauteed sliced baby portabella mushrooms with onion and garlic which I added to the tomato mixture.  I also added 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, instead of just 1/4 to the sauce - because really, you can never have enough cheese! It could use more spinach than the recipe calls for, so next time I'll make that change - but this was very wonderful and easy and I will definitely be making it again!

I thought this was very good.  I did not use heavy cream, I used FF milk and used a bit of cornstarch to it so the sauce would thicken slightly.  I also used fresh basil.  I think that gives the dish a nice bright taste.  I will make this again.

Lovely!  Nice light flavor, although I did make some minor adjustments.  I used a plain can of diced tomatoes, and doubled the minced garlic.  I left out the onion.  I think I would have been safe with even a little more garlic (but I really like garlic).  Also, I used milk instead of heavy cream, which should help on the fat and calorie side.  I prefer corn starch as a thickening agent (just be sure to cut the amount by half - you'd need twice as much flour to do the same job).  I was impressed with the flavor of the sauce, and didn't notice too much of a pink tinge that turned off one reviewer.  However, next time, I'll use fresh tomatoes, because I was kinda turned off by the flavor of the canned tomatoes.  In all other respects a wonderful and simple dish that looks and tastes like it took forever!  Will definitely make again!

Altho I think this needed a lot more cheese, which I did add, we thought this recipe was delish! I also sauteed portabello mushrooms to add to the dish.
Because we don't like soggy fresh spinach, I did not cook it in with the sauce, but tossed it in with the pasta at the very end jusy to wilt it. Enjoyed by my whole family Lela and thank you!

This was delicious!! I followed the recipe almost exactly- the only difference was I used italian diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano because I didnt have the one specified.  Also I used 5 cloves of fresh garlic and minced it up. I think it could have used even more than that. Otherwise I followed everything and it turned out wonderful, My hubby loved it and my 1 year old ate a good amount of it too! It was a good way to sneak a veggie into him.  I recommend this to everyone to try and will definatly make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really nice, easy recipe that looks beautiful and tastes better than I've gotten in some restaurants. I basically followed the recipe, but had no fresh spinach, so used half a box of frozen. Everyone loved it!

My family and I loved this dish...my one year old kept asking for more!  It was so simple, and it is delicious.  I actually didn't have any cream on hand, but I had everything else, so I just used evaporated milk in place of the cream and it turned out great.  I'll definitely make this one again!

I have never received so many compliments on a meal before! It was a little runny, but I seemed to be the only one who thought so. I think next time I might try adding some shrimp to this, everyone said it tasted as though it already had it in it anyway. Great recipe, thanks!

I used this sauce recipe over bowties as I'm not a fan of tortellini and it was awesome!!  My sauce was a little thin, but I used skim milk and light cream to help with calories/fat.  Next time I would add more spinach and and a tiny bit more garlic.****update - it goes great with gnoochi!!

This was a great dish. Unfortunately I ate too much of it!! One plate full just wasn't enough. I followed the recipe exactly and everyone at my dinner party thought it was amazing. Look for frozen Tortellini if you want to save some money. It's much cheaper then the fresh stuff-

Def. a sound recipe! The color did turn out to be a bit pink, however that didn't bother my boyfriend or myself. I would suggest adding more spinach than called for, it seems to get lost in the pasta otherwise. ((used one bunch myself, and it still seemed a tad little)) I did a combination of cheese stuffed ravioli and farfalle which turned out to be a winner. ((Im in china right now and I swear there is no tortellini here!!)) I also chopped up some fresh tomatoes to throw in! Made the flavor more intense.  I also used fresh basil which made the dish come alive, used two tablespoons however. ((love basil)). More garlic could have been used as well ((used 5 cloves)) :) Overall it was a great and easy dish!

This is a delicious recipe!  I followed it more or less exactly...  and it turned out perfect!  I did end up using a whole 20oz pkg of cheese tortellini, and then made the sauce as the recipe called, and it was still plenty of sauce for the extra 4oz of tortellini.  This is definitely going to become one of my kitchen standard recipes!  :)

I came upon this recipe after my original plan for dinner fell through.  I was really hopeful, but unfortunately for me, it tasted extremely bland.

This is a pretty good dish.  I didn't have fresh spinach do I had to use frozen.  Next time, I'll make it with fresh.  I added mushrooms and fresh tomatoes along with canned.  I didn't have cream so I used half and half and thickened it with cornstarch.  This is a pretty versatile recipe and would probably be good with penne or by adding chicken or shrimp.  Thanks!

This was excellent!  Quick and easy to prepare on a busy night, and a great way to get the fam to eat spinach!!  My Husband and kids gave it "two arms up!" (our voting system, to decide if Mama should fix something again)

I doubled the recipe so that we would have left overs.  I only had one can of diced tomatoes, so I used a can of stewed tomatoes for the other.  I just cut them up like diced, and it worked great.  

Will definitely make again!!

I think I noticed too late that a lot of ppl that gave this really high reviews added something, meat or more cheese or something.  And that is what it was lacking - something.  Following the recipe exactly, it was pretty bland.  I think some hot italian sausage would probably really improve it or try to follow one of the other reviewer's suggestions.

I love this recipe. It is one of my Christmas Eve buffet dishes. I double the recipe and add fresh basil instead of dried. Frozen spinach works just as well as the fresh. I prepare the cream sauce the night before. Since I have a large crowd, I find either penne pasta or ziti is more cost effective. I use 2 to 3 pounds of pasta and the doubled recipe is enough sauce in my opinion. This will be the 3rd year in a row on the menu and it's always a crowd pleaser! Thanks for the recipe.

We absolutely loved this recipe! Tastes like something you'd enjoy at an Italian restaurant. It was so simple and so tasty! I added thinly sliced mushrooms and fresh garlic and "italian style" diced tomatoes b/c that's what I had. Excellent! Will keep this at top of my list for guests and special dinners.

I loved this recipe! It tasted like something you would order at a really good Italian restaurant. Although I usually make the recipe as it is written, but I doubled the amount of spinach, and increased the garlic (4 cloves), and used a 20 oz package of refrigerated tortellini (I couldn't find a 16 oz).  So delicious and sooo easy! Yummy! :)

This was fantastic.  I had some organic cherry tomatoes and mushrooms to use up so I started those first with a diced up chicken breast in some EVOO.  I used double the spinach & cheese.  Followed the rest of this as directed with the exception of the heavy cream (I only had whole milk).  It was fantastic, and really very easy.

Very easy and quick... although I cheated a bit and used leftover jarred alfredo sauce.  The proportion of veggies is just right.

This was really yummy. I did change it up because I didn't have everything on hand.  I used a jarred Alfredo sauce in place of the flour, milk and heavy cream. Definitely a keeper.

The only difference on mine was I could only get a 20 oz. package of tortellini.  Other than that, I followed it exactly.  It was so yummy and easy!

If I were to make this again, I'd skip the flour & milk addition, and just use 3/4 c. cream, which will get thick enough on its own.  I could taste the flour in the final dish and that's what I think gives it the 'bland' taste a lot of reviewers mentioned.  However, my son (6) loved this (though 2 daughters didn't).

This recipe was really simple and delicious! I made this for my fiancee and mother in law and they absolutely loved it! I added probably 4-5 cups of spinach, a whole bag! and I added a whole fresh chopped tomato and 3 garlic cloves as well. I added mushrooms and a itty bit of chicken bouillon. I didnt use any heavy cream, instead I use milk and added cornstarch. ooh and..I added some spice of course, cayene pepper and crushed red pepper.

I really liked this recipe a lot!!  It was quick, easy, and tasted great!!  I did add a little more cheese(1/2 cup total} and used 1 1/2 cups of half and half(total) cause that's all I had.  It turned out great!  As a variation I may add some diced chicken for a man meal!  Thanks Lela!

Very good and easy recipe. I only used 1/4 cup of heavy cream and subbed 2% for the remainder liquids to cut some calories and it still tasted great. I had some spinach and cheese raviolis on hand so I used them, perfect combo.

This is a fantastic recipe! I wanted to stretch it a bit so I added 2 turkey sausages and a load of mushrooms. I also replaced the heavy cream with 10% cream to cut the calories some. It tasted delicious, but I could have done with more spinach (personal preference), so I'll probably triple it next time.

**Followed the recipe to a T as normal, I hate when people change things. This was pretty darn good and I think I will make it again with a few changes. The spinach didn't do much for me, I think I'll leave it out next time. I will also add another can of tomatoes and lots more garlic!!!!! Thanks

CAN I GIVE IT 10 STARS!!!!  I love trying out any tomato cream recipes and this is def the BEST ever!  I used fresh chopped up basil instead of dried, freshly grated parmesan cheese(it really makes a difference in taste to use fresh), and half and half instead of milk(ran out of milk) and I also added in 2 tsp cornstarch as well for I like a thicker sauce and I through it over angel hair spaghetti...YYUUMMYY!!
Can't wait to add chicken, or shrimp, or mushrooms, or sun dried tomatoes..the options are endless with this sauce..ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!

A very easy and yummy dish.  I didn't use the heavy cream either but increased the milk to 1 cup and I too use cornstarch as a thickener.  I also used 1 package of fresh spinach and cooked it down with fresh garlic before I added the diced tomato.  I will be serving this again!!!  :)

This was very good. I used small cheese ravioli but that doesn't really matter. I also added some Italian sausage and some more fennel seeds and red pepper flakes. And thickened it was a little cornstarch mixed with some milk.

This can be changed so many ways and still be wonderful! Make it lighter w/ no cream or be Italian and go for the gusto! Vegie like this is great, or chicken is awesome as well. Summer time use fresh tomatoes and basil.
You will love it!

This wasn't bad, it just didn't "wow" me at all. I used extra garlic, white pepper, added mozzarella, and reduced the tomatoes in white wine with a chicken bouillon cube for extra flavor. I'm sure this hits the spot for home cooking for some, unfortunately it didn't for me.

Nummy! Schwan's makes a good 6-cheese tortellini and I'm always looking for a new way to make it. This recipe is just the right combination of rich and fresh! I can't wait until my garden is going and I will have fresh basil to add; the dried basil just doesn't do as much for this dish. I did have some fresh parsley this time around, and it added a nice punch. Thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE: Got a chance to make this again, with fresh basil. Yum! This time I doubled the spinach and used half and half instead of the milk and cream.

Awesome!  I used 1 1/2 Tbl. fresh basil instead of dried, doubled the amount of fresh spinach, and used fat-free half-and-half instead of the heavy cream.  I also decreased the pepper to 1/8 tsp., and was glad I did.  The second time I made this, I used dried basil instead of fresh, doubled the garlic, and added a little wine (maybe 1/4 cup), then let the tomatoes simmer for about 7 minutes to let the flavors meld.  I then added the milk-based ingredients and let it thicken.  Next, I added almost an entire bag of fresh chopped spinach (I like it barely wilted), let it cook a couple of minutes, then threw in the tortellini. Will be doing it this way from now on!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this twice now.  I didn't have the tomatoes w/garlic, so I sauteed onions and garlic in a bit of olive oil before throwing in the spinach.  I also added a 1/2 C white wine with the tomatoes.  The second time I made this, I made more sauce and it was perfect!  Thanks for such a yummy and quick recipe!!

This recipe is great as written but has the added bonus of being very adaptable to other additions or substitutions. You can add hot or sweet loose sausage. You can substitute half and half, evap milk or regular milk, add some cornstarch if needed. Regular canned or fresh peeled tomatoes work, just add fresh onion and garlic. You can change the tortellini to bite sized ravioli etc. Use as much spinach as you like and oh yes you can add mushrooms too. Thank you for this excellent base recipe.

Loved this! I didn't have tomatoes with onion and garlic. Just with garlic basil and oregano. I sauteed some chopped onion in the pan first. I also added about a pound of hot sausage removed casings and crumbled them in the pan with the onion. I also added more than double of garlic it called for. And didn't add the spinach until about two minutes before I added the tortellini. Also added almost another can of tomatoes. I used 20 oz bag of tortellini. And used more cheese. And increased the milk and cream just a little bit. Great flavor!

I've made this a few times now, as written except using half and half instead of heavy cream. My family loves the taste but the sauce is pretty thin. Maybe it is because I didn't use cream or maybe because I didn't drain the tomatoes? Anyway it makes a ton of sauce for 16 oz. of pasta and I always forget that. I usually end up cooking more pasta to use up the leftover sauce. Tonight I added mushrooms. Mmmm

I made this last night and it is really good - only thing I did differently was that I tossed in frozen chopped spinach because I had it in freezer and used fat free half and half - great recipe!

We really liked this and it was easy. I scaled the recipe up for my family. Some may prefer a little more parmesan or spinach. I really recommend this for a beginning cook. It's so easy and it looks like it was more work; close to "restaurant quality" too

I thought this was excellent! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand - sauted mushrooms with onions, garlic, and basil, added stewed tomatoes and frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed), then added the cream sauce (made with 1/2 and 1/2). I thought the sauce needed just a bit more flavor, so next time I will play around with some spices and try to figure it out.

This was very good and very easy.  I used light cream, a bag of fresh spinach.  I did not have diced tomatoes with garlic and onions, so I just sauteed 1/2 cup of onion and minced garlic in EVOO.

Heavy and bland and the spinach disappears.  I really don't understand what all the rave reviews are about.  There are much lighter tastier recipes.

This was awesome!  I was skeptical at first with the spinach-my 13 year old won't touch it.  I used 1/2 box frozen spinach since I didn't have any fresh.  No other changes!  You must try it. Creamy, tomatoey, cheezy!  Yum!

WOW! What a delish dish. This could easily be restaurant fare. I followed the recipe exactly, can't imagine the sauce being as tasty without the cream so I wouldn't skip it. My 15 month old gobbled this up too!

Delicious! This made a wonderful dinner! I chose to make this recipe because it looked so simple, and my husband loves tortellini. I followed all the directions, except that I replaced the tomatoes with a can of Italian tomatos, and instead of dried basil used fresh. I also added some chicken as other reviewers suggested, it added a good extra texture to the meal. Personally I think I would only make this with some cheese tortellini... the cheese seems to help make the dish. But I may try with a different noodle and add some additional cheeses... At any rate I'll be making this a lot!

This was great. I couldn't find canned tomatoes with garlic and onions, so I used tomatoes with Italian seasoning and then finely chopped a small onion and added some extra minced garlic which I sauteed for a few minutes before adding the tomatoes and spinach. I also used half and half rather than milk and cream. The only thing that I will change the next time I make this is to use more spinach, 1 cup was not enough in my opinion. It came togather alot faster than I thought it would, so that was a pleasant suprise.

Sooo good, and EASY!  The only variations on the recipe I did were minor-- I used 2 average sized cloves of garlic, which I pressed into about a tablespoon of butter in the skillet first and let it saute for a few minutes; I then added some frozen chopped spinach to that (don't know how much, just broke some off of a large bag of frozen chopped spinach I had) and let it saute until it was thawed, then I added the rest of the ingredients (left out the pepper-- I don't like it) and followed the recipe as written.  My hubby wanted to help and even he said what a super-easy recipe this was-- you can easily have this on the table within 30 minutes!  Not only that, it was delicious and my entire family enjoyed it... was really good with Bread Machine Focaccia from this site.  I think we'll be having this regularly-- a definite keeper!

I love this recipe--I use regular pasta instead of tortellini, add a pound of crumbled sweet sausage, use two can of tomatoes (drained) and add a little crushed red pepper.

5 star just the way it is.  Variences to this recipe should be tried to custom make it to your family's preferences.  I made it this time by sautéing Italian sausages removed from casings with onion and garlic.  No need for salt/pepper depending on your meat choice.  I then added a 28 oz can of San Marano whole tomatoes which I broke up in the pan.  (I was told by an Italian chef to never use canned diced tomatoes because exposing the tomatoes to a blade before canning reduces the quality and taste). I brought this to a boil.  When the tortellini was almost done, I added 3/4 cup heavy cream ( no need to thicken) plus a whole bunch of kale chopped and 12 large fresh basil leaves chopped from my garden as well as the Parmesan cheese.  Spinach is just as good but I ran out of it. When the kale and basil were just wilted, I used a slotted spoon to put the tortellini right into the sauce.  I took It off the burner, covered it for 5 minutes to let it all blend.  Healthy, delicious, and definitely restaurant quality.

I'm not a good cook at all but this recipe was super easy! It was low cost even with the hot and mild italian sausage I put in it. I brough it to a party and everyone loved it! Definatly will be making it again.

This tortellini turned out excellent! However, I modified the recipe quite a bit based on my preferences and what I had in the fridge. For starters, I avoid canned foods when at all possible, and I had fresh veggies on hand, so I added halved grape tomatoes, additional fresh garlic, and diced vidalia onion instead of the canned diced tomatoes. I also added a cubed portobello mushroom cap for some additional flavor. Additionally, even though I had spinach on hand, I opted for arugula because it tends to add a nice peppery flavor. I didn't have dried basil, so I added a dried Italian herb blend instead. Furthermore, I only had 2% milk, so I used 1.5 cups of milk instead of the half milk/half heavy cream concoction - better for the waistline, yet it thickened up nicely! As far as I can tell, substituting all milk didn't compromise the flavor or the thickness of the sauce one bit, perhaps because I used shredded parm instead of grated parm. Despite several changes, I absolutely loved this dish and will definitely be making it again!

Okay, on it's own, too bland. So here are my 2nd-time-around alterations, which rated 5stars by the fam. Saute'd leftover rotisserie chicken breast, cubed, with olive oil and minced garlic, then scraped the pan with 1/2 cup of water, and added Classico Fire Roasted Tomato sauce (THE best), added Herbox ckn bouillon, 10oz frozen spinach, 1/2cup more water, salt, 2tsp minced garlic. Let it simmer until spinach hot, removed from stove and added 4T+ of lebni (yogurt cheese). (I add lebni to red sauce to make it creamier, and it's a VERY healthy alternative to cream sauce.)Combined sauce with cooked tortellini, served with fresh parmesan and french bread. YUM

Super easy to make! I pretty much doubled the recipe and also added about 2 Tbsp of cornstarch diluted in cold water. I also added Baby portabella mushrooms and a chopped red bell pepper to the tomato mixture. The whole family loved it.

Excellent recipe!  Didn't have tomatoes with garlic and onion so I just sauteed some chopped onion and minced garlic and added a can of plain diced tomatoes.  Also used fresh basil rather than dried and skim milk rather than cream - to cut down down on some of the fat and calories.  Definitely a keeper!!

A little too cheesy (too much dairy) for my taste, but really good if you like rich food.

Delicious and quick!!!  I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes so I made my own (1 8oz can tomato sauce, fresh diced tomatoes, fresh minced onion, 1 tsp garlic salt).  A nice break from throwing jarred sauce on top of tortellini as a side.

Thanks for the great recipe. It was so quick to make and really yummy. I subsituted a 12 oz can of evaporated skim milk in place of the cream and milk because I had it on hand, and I'm watching calories.  I calculated the caleries and divided into 4 servings came to 333 calories per serving the way I made it.

I made this dish tonight.  My husband pretty much summed it up.  After having several bites he said, "Well sweetheart, I'd order this dish again"!  We both enjoyed it and I followed the recipe to the T.  Thanks Lela.

This is quite good, and lovely to look at!  I thought it was a little odd to just boil the garlic in the tomato juice without sauteeing it, but tried it as written.  I used fat-free evaporated milk -- just that, no cream or half and half -- as an experiment, but I doubled the cheese and then some.  Worked out well; the sauce was thick and creamy, if not as rich as it could have been.  Added fresh basil at the end.  A hint:  when mixing the milk and flour, add the milk a bit at a time at first, until the mixture is fairly liquid.  This will keep lumps out of your sauce and might solve some of the problems some reviewers have been having with thin sauce.  Also, I used baby spinach and frozen minced garlic, and it was on the table in the time it took to cook the tortellini.  Four stars because I still think the cooking method is a bit strange, but good and fast nonetheless!

Even though it may seem this is difficult .. It was super easy to make.  I did as others mentioned below and doubled cheese and garlic -- as that's the kinda folks we are here!  I also added Shrimp to this. Waited to add shrimp and TONS of fresh baby spinach (as it cooks down so very much) until AFTER it had thickened up.  SO definitely going into dinner rotation and looking forward to trying with chicken and maybe even steak! 

My son and I thank you so very much for a wonderful recipe Lela!!!

I made this for a company dinner when I had very little time after work, and we all loved it.  As others have said, it is very easy and also delicious.  I did add more Parmesan cheese to the sauce, which was delicious.  I baked sweet Italian sausage with garlic, green peppers and onions at 400 degrees for about 30 minutes and served it on the side with the Tortellini.  Perfect!!

Made this tonight for dinner exactly as written except for adding a generous pinch of red pepper flakes to the sauce and using a whole bag of baby spinach.  I really liked it although I think I cooked the pasta a bit too long.  Hubby on the other hand said it was pretty much tasteless and didn't care if I ever made it again. Maybe he missed the meat, I did not and I will make this again once he's had a chance to forget he's had it before. ;-)  Update: Feb/18 - made again tonight with a couple of adjustments - added hot italian sausage about 3/4 lb - used an entire bag of baby spinach - and used half & half in place of milk. Delicious! And hubby agreed. He kept saying we've had this before and I kept denying it.  Because we hadn't ever had this version before. ;-)

Loved this easy recipe, as did everyone else that ate it. I doubled the recipe and it came out great. I think shrimp would go really well mixed into this pasta and I think I'll try that next time.

This was so good! I sauted some onion and a chopped portabello mushroom then added the tomato and continued from there. I also used half and half to still have it creamy, but at least not as fatty as heavy cream. It was cooked in no time! And eaten in no time too! I see myself making this very, very often. Oh! I also added the spinach after to get it just wilted.

Made this last night, and it was awesome!  Used half-and-half and 1% milk in place of the heavy cream and regular milk, and I used diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano instead of the tomatoes with garlic and onion.  Everyone loved it!  I doubled the whole recipe, and there wasn't much left!  Thanks for sharing...will definitely make again!

Very Yummy. After reading the reviews, I decided toI double the cheese, garlic and spinach. I also added one diced medium size fresh tomato. I wanted some protien so I sprinkled about 6-8 chicken tenderloins with some italian spices, garlic, and s&p and cooked them in a pan while I was cooking everything else. They were a nice addition on top of this dish. My boyfriend liked this dinner, even though he isnt the biggest fan of spinach. I have left over ingredients so I think I will try making a creamy mushroom sauce tonight!

Loved it! Easy to make and inexpensive. Made it for my boyfriend and his parents... I cook with a lot of garlic so I used extra garlic and used the garlic cream and half of regular cream next time I am thinking of adding some clams and or scallops

This is fantastic! We used sausage ravioli instead of cheese (hubby's tummy and all) and it was absolutely fab!! The sauce is great- don't change a thing!! We did put our spinach in at the last moment just because we don't like it so wilty but it did not change the flavor, I'm sure.

I feel like this is one of those recipes that tasted better the second day.  Its very rich in flavor and I agree with the other comments to add a little more cheese and to perhaps, scale back on the milk a bit.

I LOVED this recipe!! I had everything I needed other than the Tortellini (it's great when you have almost all of the ingredients on hand).  It took less than 10 minutes to cook, I didn't have to chop anything...just threw it all in the pan. SO easy, not to mention delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

This was delicious!  i modified the recipe a bit, just because it sounded really good, but i didnt have all the ingredients on hand, otherwise, im sure its perfect as is too :)  i used evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream, and i used linguini instead of tortellini.
i sauteed some mushrooms and onions (i didnt have the diced tomatoes with onions, so i added them this way instead).  i used fire roasted diced tomatoes, and added fresh spinach and pre cooked shrimp in the last 5 minutes so they wouldnt be overcooked.  This was delicious and definitely will be added to my regular menu!  thank you for the recipe Lela :)

Excellent.  Followed recipe exactly, but did use stick blender to break up the diced tomatoes (personal preference.)  I did serve it with homemade meatballs.  I mean, what's pasta without meatballs?  This recipe makes a LOT of sauce.  I'm going to freeze the extra sauce to make a quick lunch for the grandkids.

I've made this a few times because it's simple and fast and can be made with frozen and canned foods (easier on the budget).  It's a very rich sauce so I would recommend pairing the sauce with a less rich tortellini or a chicken or vegetable ravioli.  It's also quite sweet tasting and I can only guess that is from the dried (sweet) basil so fresh basil might cut down on sweetness.

Delicious! My boyfriend loves pasta and usually, he would always add salt and cheese to it. This time, he didn't add anything. It was perfect for him. I added some tomato sauce because there wasn't enough liquid at the beginning to cook the spinach properly. I also added oregano. I added an onion (I love onions!) as well. I didn't have any parmesan cheese on hand, so I just use the packaged cheddar/mozzarella shredded cheese I had. I was also tempted to add black olives. I didn't do it, but I definitely will next time. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was delicious and could not have been easier.  I used a can and a half of tomatoes and some extra spinach to beef up the sauce.

Delicious!  I think next time I'll add some red pepper to give it a little extra flavor.  It would be amazing with chicken, shrimp, or scallops in it.

I found this recipe using the "ingredients"option at the top of the page because I had random things in my pantry. This was awesome! I served it with fish and steamed carrots and my boyfriend ate more of this then anything else. The serving size was perfect for just me and him, and we had enough for lunch the next day. I used frozen spinach that I thawed and squeezed the water out of. It was pretty rich so next time I will use less cream and more milk but it was DELICIOUS!

SO GOOD! I used 20 oz (all of it) Buitoni mixed cheese tortellini (white and green) from the fridge section, Walmart brand Italian diced tomatoes, a couple good handfulls of chopped fresh spinach, and a couple good handfulls of the parm cheese. Totally yummy, like another reviewer said...something you'd get at a good Italian restaurant. Will make this for guests!

This was simple to make and tasted great! Lots of leftovers too. I did substitute some things, i used 1 can aylmer accents garlic and olive oil diced tomatoes. I used frozen spinach which worked and tasted good. And i used half and half cream instead of heavy cream. Will definately make this again

Olive Garden, you have nothing that can compare with this recipe!  So delicious!  I would double the amount of spinach but otherwise this was a perfect pasta dish!  I will keep making this one for many years to come.  SO EASY!  My husband loved it!  I will make for company and double the recipe.

This was really delicious and a breeze to make after a long day at work.  No changes, just simply delish!  I loved it, though my 13 month old did not.  But, I'm beginning to think she's not a ravioli or tortellini fan at all!  Make only what you need for a nights dinner, as this dish does not re-heat well!  Tortellini becomes too mushy.

You may want to consider doubling the entire recipe, depending on the size of your brood, as they will eat a lot of this. This is a very good basic sauce recipe, too. I would like to try the sauce with penne and Italian sausage.

My family really loved this dish.  I used fresh tomatoes, 1/2 small onion and extra garlic sauteed in olive oil, rather than using a can of tomatoes.  I also added some Italian Sausage, which I highly recommend.  Delicious!

The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I made some changes.  I purchased a case of roma tomatoes to make homemade spaghetti sauce and freeze for the winter.  Since I had so much sauce I used it as the base and added the spinach, milk, etc.  Also I used filled ravioli instead of tortellini.  The result was FABULOUS!

Yum!! This was so delicious. I did make a few changes because I love tomatoes roasted. I roasted fresh tomatoes at 350 for 1 hour with olive oil and Italian seasonings. The only other thing was I used fresh basil instead of dried, so I doubled the amount. Everything else I followed exactly. I found that if I use canned tomatoes, I need to drain them first.

I put more spinach, fresh basil, & more cheese.  With more cheese in there, I should have used less flour, it the sauce got a little too thick.

This was delicious! I loved it. We ate it with the Feta Chicken, also from this site and it was an excellent side. I don't eat tortellini a lot because I usually just throw some parmesan cheese on it, or something simple like that. It's kind of a forgettable taste and texture. This, though, was great.  It was the first time I ever made a homemade cream sauce for the tortellini, and now, I don't think I'll ever go back to simple.

This was good but needed more flavor. Used mushroom ravioli, fresh basil, frozen spinach (from a bag, not a box- its more fresh-like), and a can of evaporated milk in place of the milk & cream. It was a very quick, easy dinner with ingredients that are always on hand in our house. I'll probably make it again, but play around with adding more flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I had been looking at it for days and finally decided to try it.  I basically followed the recipe except I used a box of frozen spinach cause that is what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again....

We grilled Chicken Breast and served with this for an awesome dinner! The recipe calls for a can of Diced Tomatoes with Garlic and Onion. We improvised and added our own chopped garlic and onions, and used a lot more spinach. What a yummy recipe though!

Tasty! I did cut the tortellini down to 12 oz. (1 package of fresh) and followed another reviewer's advice about adding lots more spinach, we like spinach a lot. I also just used 3/4 cup of half and half and found that to be plenty creamy. High fat, but good for an occasional treat!

Even my picky 5-year-old loves this.  I made this for a bridal shower at my job and it was a huge hit!

Thank you for this awesome recipe.  It made me look good.

This did not do it for me. I hate to use the description of "bland" since I think some reviewers on this site throw that word around too liberally, but . . .
The ingrediants in this recipe comprise some of my favorite foods, but it didn't have much "oomph" when put together. Perhaps all the milk/cream served to reduce the flavors of tomato, basil, and spinah. If I were to make this again, I would try to reduce the amount of milk and/or supplement with some concentrated tomato sauce - and also add a lot more spinach.

Incredible!!! I only made a few changes....I added another chopped garlic clove to the diced tomatoes and garlic, used fresh basil, fresh spinach and a couple splashes of white wine.  I let this simmer for about 30 mins then added the flour,milk and cream. I was out of shredded parm. so I used regular.  Again, I let this simmer while I cooked the tortellini and added a bit of salt and pepper. GREAT flavor! The sauce almost didn't make it to the pasta, since I kept tasting it! Defiantly a keeper!!! Thanks

This is the easiest and best tasting pasta I have ever made!! I couldn't believe how easy it was to prepare.  I didn't have tortellini on hand, so I just used some ziti.  I also threw in some fresh mushrooms and cubed chicken breast from a previous meal into the sauce, before adding the cream.  Yummy!!

Good flavorful pasta dish.  I only used 9 oz of spinach/cheese tortellini.  I also added more fresh garlic and more spinach.  Quick and easy. SECOND REVIEW:  Used 18 oz of tortellini, still added extra garlic and spinach but added red pepper flakes which I will continue to do in the future

Fabulous recipe - super fast and easy!  I changed the ratio of cream to milk (I decreased the amount of cream to lower the fat content and added a bit more milk and flour to compensate) and I used fresh basil instead of dried.  I also used beef tortellini instead of cheese.

This was wonderful, and super easy!  I didn't have much time before my husband came home, and it turned out perfectly!  I did substitute half and half for the heavy whipping cream (used just a little bit of whipping cream to try to make it lower fat) and I think next time I will use even less half and half, no cream, and more milk to make it even more healthy.  I added some fresh chopped mushrooms as well to the sauce, along with some chicken.  I also used frozen tortellini, and it was ready in even less time. My husband devoured it. :)  We had garlic bread as well, and it was yummy to dip in the sauce.  Thanks!!

Really good!!  I just made this for dinner and we both loved it!  My only comments for personal taste...I would 1/2 the tortellini-way too much and not near enough sauce.  There was only enough to merely coat the tortellini, no extra at all.  I would also add a little less spinich and quite a bit more garlic.  Even so, it was great as is!  Definitely making this again!

I always make lots of this recipe when I am haivng my girlfriends over for the weekend (one of them is a vegitarian)- let me tell you it tastes amazing and its even better after a night out ;)
The recipe is so fast and easy to make, the ingredients are relatively inexpensive and I typically have most of them on hand-

I usually use a whole 6 oz bag of pre-washed spinach (anything extra would just get thrown away because I dont really like spincach), petite diced tomatoes and a few cloves of fresh garlic... I also like to add freshly grated parm. it's much better than the stuff in the plastic containers.

I've also thrown in steamed shrimp at the last minute for my carnivore friends- its a tasty addition but i'm sure chicken would be great as well!
try it! its worth it! :)

I would like to have given this 3 1/2 stars...but alas, it is not an option.  I thought this was "good".  It didn't knock my socks off, and I probably wouldn't break it out for company, but I will probably make it again for myself.  I only used 8 oz tortellini (I like alot of sauce! :), added an additional 1/2 teaspoon of garlic, used evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream, used close to 1/3 cup Parmesan, and added 2 Italian sausage links (casing removed, cooked).  I definitley recommend adding the Italian sausage, I'm glad that I did!!

This was good although I did make some changes.  I didn't have any diced tomatoes so I used tomato puree.  I substituted low fat milk for the cream to save on some fat and used only about 1/2 cup or less.  I didn't add the fresh spinach until the very end, cooking it down just a bit before adding the tortellini.  Otherwise it would be way too withered.

This was really a nice treat when you are in the mood for a creamy pasta. I followed the recipe but added my own garlic and onions. I added like 3 cups of Spinach, used light cream instead of heavy cream, and added some white wine. Very good! I will definately make again. Next time I might add some Shrimp and Scallops, Crab or Grilled Chicken.

This recipe is great! It's quick, easy and delicious! If you like spinach, definitely add at least 2-3 cups. Taking advice from other reviews I added an extra clove of garlic to add more kick. If you're not a garlic lover, add something else you like because it does need it. I had my Mom over for dinner, her exact quote was, "I could DRINK this sauce!!" :)

I used all heavy cream, and doubled the recipe., making it for Christmas Eve dinner.  I will most definitely make this again.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought the dish came from one of my favorite Italian restaurants.  Rich, delicious and relatively easy to put together.  It stands very  well on its own, but could also be paired with chicken parmesan, lemone, romano, sausage or meatballs. This is a show stopper dish.

Bomb pasta! I made mine with mini meatballs to add a protein element, and I used half & half rather than the milk and cream mixture. So good!

I have made this recipe twice and both times followed the recipe as written.  It is DIVINE!  The cream sauce is so yummy...not too thick, not too thin.  It is a total favorite in our house and will be a part of our regular rotation.  DELICIOUS!

Made this on a whim. Really easy and quick dinner! I followed the recipe pretty closely except for substituting garlic salt for minced garlic since I didn't have fresh on hand. I also had to use a handful of mozzarella and feta since I was out of Parmesan. I used a fresh three cheese tortellini for this recipe and the flavors melded together very nicely. Everyone in the family enjoyed, even my 19 month old who couldn't get enough of the "num num noodles".

So easy to prepare and so delicious!! I added extra parmesan cheese and basil to give it more flavor. The sauce was so tasty that I made a side of garlic bread not to waste it!

I put a bit of cooked chicken into it because the boys want meat for dinner.  I used cream with fat free milk.  I didn't want to add more fat.  It was rich enough with just that combination.   I doubled everything except had 2-12oz packs of tortellini.  Make sure you season it correctly if you double it. Taste it before you finish cooking.  Yum!

I am loving this sauce.  It is fun and easy to make and tastes delicious!  I have made variations using roma tomatoes, canned tomatoes, and garden fresh yellow grape tomatoes.  All turned out well, but the fresher the tomatoes, the happier I have been with the sauce.

Very yummy. I read a lot of reviews and I really only made 2 small changes. Spinach cooks down to nothing so I used the entire bag of fresh spinach. And I did add more parmesan. Plus a good pinch of freshly grated provolone. The real stuff, not the soft soft you get in a deli. Even if I didn't make these changes it still would have gotten 5 stars.

This was awesome. I only did a minor change of adding chopped onion and garlic. 

The only danger with this recipe is of eating too much of it, e.g., Yesterday I had it for dinner, a snack, and then breakfast this morning. : )

This is so delicious and easy and quick! The original recipe is amazing itself, but I've also sauteed about 5 premium thick cut bacon slices, peas, and mushrooms and it was great too, just to mix it up a bit. Saute the bacon with no oil, remove and drain. Add the mushrooms and a little butter to the bacon grease then add garlic, spinach, etc and follow recipe as usual. I just added frozen peas at the end to warm. Enjoy!

I used whole wheat tortellini and mixed 1/2 cup milk with 1 cup half n half (and the flour) since that is all I had. I also used rosemary instead of basil. It was quite good and I will make again but I will probably use less of the cream mixture. Oh - I also salted my pasta water and poured a little bit of the starchy water in the sauce - a little trick from Rachel Ray recommended for all pasta sauces!

Very yum recipe. Had to add a bit meat but otherwise it was really easy and yum. 
We got few fussy eaters so this was a good combo and all loved it.

It was super easy and really flavorful! I really enjoyed making it and the best part was eating it! I can't wait to make this for my husband! :D The only thing I'd add is some shredded parmesan cheese for after its cooked. Also they didn't have the Garlic and Onion Tomatoes so I used Garlic tomato and added a little minced onion. Other than that I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfectly!

This is incredible! Our family LOVES this recipe, so it is now in our monthly rotation.  I'm not normally a fan of cheese tortellini so I wasn't sure I would like this. But when I went to buy it, I found some cheese and garlic ones and oh are they delish.  I serve this with a nice big loaf of crusty bread, a spinach salad and a nice glass of white wine. Perfect. Thanks so very much Lela!!

I made this last night, and it was a hit! I had a 20 ounce package of tortellini, but the amount of sauce was still plenty. I didn't have basil, garlic or heavy cream, so I used 1 tsp sage, 1 tsp garlic salt and 1 1/4 cups reduced fat milk. I also increased the parmesan to 1/2 cup. To give it some heat, I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapeno peppers...just right!

I was really disappointed with this. Not only was it bland (despite adding extra garlic), but it also had a strange after-taste to it that I found unpleasant. Also, the mixture of the canned tomatoes with the milk and cream gave it a strange pink/salmon color, which was a bit off-putting. The color didn't bother me too much, but because of it, it's not something that I would serve for company even if it did taste good.

Delicious!  I didn't have the diced tomatoes with onions and garlic on hand, so I used a plain can of diced tomatoes and added in 1/8 teaspoon onion powder and used 4 cloves of garlic.  Next time I would use 5 or more cloves.  I followed the recipe exactly for the remaining ingredients - a very satisfying meal that tasted like I spent a lot more time in the kitchen cooking it than I actually did!  It is definitely a quick and easy meal.  This would also be great if you changed up the pasta - my kids are not huge fans of tortellini so next time I might try penne pasta.

Very good recipe.  I used Italian sausage stuffed tortellini and I would definitely add more garlic.  It was a little bland compared to what I expected but still very good.

I added more spinach, chopped onions and mushrooms too.  I really enjoyed the result and think it is "company worthy."  Could probably make the sauce first and then have everything ready before the tortellini cooks.

Kids loved it; I loved it!  I did alter it some.  We live in Thailand and diced tomatoes are expensive and hard to find "with garlic and onion."  So, I finely chopped a small onion and garlic together, sauteed in olive oil, added some Spanish ham, and used a Chardonnay to deglaze the pan.  Then I added the flour & cooked it briefly before adding the tomatoes and spinach.  In the end, no milk, just the cream.  Kids requested adding mushrooms next time.  Oh, and I started with one package three-cheese tortellini and one package spinach and cheese tortellini.  Yummy!

OMG was the words my missus used.   Out of necessity I used frozen spinach and had to add in onions and garlic to the diced tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe.   This will be one of our go-to recipes from here on forward.   Thanks for sharing.

Searched allrecipes for a recipe including tortellini. We were all out of groceries, yet I happened to have everything this recipe called for. I even added some cooked italian sausage (I had in the freezer). My picky two year old even ate it and asked for seconds! This is a keeper!

Quick, fancy-looking, and delicious!  For once, I avoided mods (due to repeated teasing from DBF).  First time: I could only find plain diced tomatoes, so I used three medium cloves of garlic total and minced a little less than 1/4 of an onion.  I used shredded parm cheese, as we don't keep grated.  This was a great way to use the end of a bag of spinach.  (I don't know if it matters, but I used dried tortellini instead of refrigerated.  Also, we only had whole milk.)
7.8.14: We have had this many more times with the same mods (except using cream, when available), but tonight I started cooking, only to realize that besides no cream, the spinach was gone!  So I used 1/2 lb. frozen corn instead.  I prefer the spinach version, but it wasn't bad.

Anytime I rate and write about a recipe, I make it according to the recipe that has been provided by the cook who posted the recipe. I see no point in rating a recipe that has been modified, and is no longer the original recipe. If, after making the recipe in its original form, I feel that it could use modifications, then I do so, when I make it another time. ~So, with that said, I rate this recipe 4 stars. It was a very good and light meal. I was able to find the can Diced Tomatoes with Garlic and Onion, in my local grocery store. The sauce was flavorful and light, yet clung to the pasta. For days that I want a more hearty meal, I will add crumbled cooked sausage. I will make this again. I will also share this original recipe with my sister, who is a vegetarian.

This was delicious!!! This is what I did. I used 1 package of cheese and garlic tortellini, 1-14.5oz can plain diced tomatoes, 1/2 chopped red onion, 6-7 small cloves of chopped garlic, salt, pepper, dried basil, 2 cups fresh chopped spinach, 2 tbsp flour, 1-1/2 cups half n half, 1/2 cup shaved parmesan cheese, and 2 cooked chopped chicken breasts.

Tortellini was set to boil in lightly salted water with about a tbsp olive oil. Meanwhile, I sauteed the onion and garlic together in oil until tender, then added diced tomatoes, salt, pepper, and dried basil. Once bubbling, I added spinach, and mixed together. When everything combined, I added the whisked together flour and half and half. I added parmesan cheese at this point. Let sauce thicken while I chopped chicken, and threw this in as well. The sauce thickened and became a light pink. I drained the tortellini, combined with sauce in a bowl.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe except for upping the spinach and passing on the cream. It was very good, but a little polite. The second time, I added some sautéed sliced mushrooms, chopped onion and chopped pepperoni, and used 1/2 & 1/2 and fresh basil (added just before serving). Sensational!! Creamy, a little spicy, and cheesy all at the same time.

Very good. I also have a meat eater who would whine all night long if he didn't get any, so I decided to add the italian sausage suggested by others. It was really good. Hubby had three helpings. However, after giving it much thought with each bite, he decided that it would be better with shrimp.

First time, made the recipe as written and really liked it.  I just made it the second time and made several changes, and holy-moly!  Here are the changes I made: I sauteed a portabella mushroom, three cloves of garlic, one red pepper, and two large shallots.  I then added the tomato sauce and the remainder of the ingredients except for FRESH basil and parsley and Fat Free cream.  IT WAS KILLER!!!

Delicious and easy! I've added this recipe to my favourites. I tweaked here and there because I used two packages of tortellini, but for the most part stayed true to the recipe. I love spinach, so I included the bunch. I sautéed a whole clove of garlic with half a large onion. Used half diced, half crushed tomato sauce. Instead of full cream, I used light cream, a little more basil, salt and pepper to taste. Definitely want to try again with sliced veggie Italian sausages and sautéed mushrooms. Terrific recipe. Thanks Lela.

This is a start, I guess, but really just too bland.  Needs a lot of tweaking to be flavorful.

I made this last night and the whole family really liked it. I pretty much followed the recipe except I bought 2 bunches of spinach and used almost all of the 2 bunches.  I also punded out a couple chix breasts, dipped in flour, egg then italian bread crumbs and fried them up in some olive oil, cut into pieces and kept warm in oven till I finished the pasta dish so I can add them in.  Since I was adding in the chicken and a 20oz. bag of tortillini vs. the 16 in recipe I ended up doubling the sauce.  I could not find diced tomatoes w/garlic AND onion, but I found a can of diced tomatoes with just garlic and one with just onion...so since I was doubling the sauce i just bought one of each.  Good think I doubled sauce...it was the perfect amount for the extra tortilli and chicken I added...will be making this again!

..as is, it is a bit bland...I doubled the spinach because one cup is next nothing once it wilts..the sauce needs more spice and flavor, I added a low fat pesto sausage and that helped a bit, but for a Meatless Monday recipe, I thinking adding fresh basil, more garlic, and more Parmesan cheese might help..it really needs a bit of jazzing up.

This was sooo amazing. I felt so spoiled while eating this, as my mind felt like I was indulging in an expensive Olive Garden entree... ^^ A must-make if you love Italian food! This will be one of my regular "special occasion"  main dishes for years to come!

This was great with my changes. I added 3 links of hot italian turkey sausage, sundried tomatoes, and an onion plus garlic powder. I also used 3x the amount on spinach and used FF milk in place of the heavy cream. I made up some of the flavor lost by not using heavy cream, I added a spoonfull of light sour cream. At the end I sprinkled some italian seasoning in. Was fantastic!

This was actually the first meal I have ever made and it was pretty easy to make and it was delicious! It was a little runny, it was a lot like soup, but it was very tasty just as good as a dish you would get at olive garden. :)

This is a great dish! Everytime I make it I feel like I'm at a restaurant. I have made it as written and it is delicious, but I usually end up adding sauted chicken or shrimp and mushrooms which make it even better! During the summer when my garden is booming I use chopped fresh tomatoes and it tastes great. Very versatile recipe.

SO delicious! My husband said he felt like he should be eating it at a restaurant.
I didn't make any changes and it was very easy to make and quick. This recipe is a definite keeper and I will for sure be making this again! We both loved it.

Amazingly good!  Reminds me of something I once had a Olive Garden.   I used 20 oz of rainbow tortellin i and a box of frozen spinach.   My husband had about 3-4 helpings.

i was really excited for this dish, but it was just so-so for us.  i think the spinach needs to be quadrupled, which sounds ridiculous but when it's simmered as long as the recipe states it wilts away to nothing.  i also thought the garlic-onion flavored tomatoes were overpowering...you couldn't taste the basil or oregano that was added.  i think using italian-seasoned tomatoes would have been a better choice.  i don't think i'll try this recipe again, but thanks for posting.  it certainly seems many other reviewres really enjoyed it!

This is excellent! My grandma is a vegetarian so this worked great for our weekly lunches. The only modification I made was that I didn't include the heavy cream. I put extra milk and a little extra flour.

i LOVED this!!! Im sry but I had to change this based on what I had....first off I didnt have spinach so I left it out.I didnt have cream, so I used milk. I added mushrooms to make up for the spinach.

This is what I did...I sauteed onions and garlic in olive oil, then I cooked the sliced mushrooms, and then added the diced tomatoes and then milk. I added some italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Then I cooked it on high heat to thicken it.

I added the frozen kind of cheese tortellini (one 14 oz bag) and it was the perfect amount for the sauce. I also added grated parm cheese. Perfect, and not too heavy since its made with milK!

Really good and simple.  I never have heavy cream so I just up'd the milk and added a bit of cream cheese! Itt was really good, oh also had shredded parm and that was good as well, a little extra cheesy factor!

Really enjoyed this dish!  I didn't use any heavy cream, just more milk and it turned out good.  Easy and fast meal for myself!

This recipe was great. I didn't make any changes. My boyfriend expects meat in everything, but I convinced him to try a veggie night and he loved it. I don't know if the sauce was a little runny or if I didn't let it thicken enough. Either way, I will be making this again.

This was pretty bland, kind of a waste of expensive torellini.  Maybe someone else knows how to expand on it.  Good base.

I added an extra cup of fresh spinach and used 2 cloves of minced roasted garlic.  I used 12oz of frozen ravioli because that was all they had at the supermarket, so I had extra sauce.  Tastes great.

Great starter- I rated 4 starts because I definitely needed to add more garlic and I also added portabello mushrooms (which was a great choice!).  I will definitely make again with those differences.

My family raved over this recipe saying it was "the best pasta they've ever eaten," also describing it as restaurant quality.  I did saute my own tomatoes, onion, and garlic instead of using canned, and (feeling ambitious) made my own basil ricotta ravioli, but I'm sure the flavors of the sauce did not deviate much from the original recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I added some salsicca sausage, crumbled, and also some fresh mushrooms.  Cook the salsicca with some fresh onions and the mushrooms, drain off fat, and then go to step 2. Yummy.  Family loved.

"I don't usually like vegetarian stuff, but this is really good." Leave it to a guy to doubt a meatless meal. This was SO delicious. As most people suggested, I doubled the spinach. I also doubled the parm but that's just me. :)

Update: This reheats very well, so if you're serving more than 1, I highly recommend doubling the recipe and saving some leftovers for lunch the next day!

Loved it!  The college kids want it when they come back from school..I doubled the recipe and used one of the cans of tomotoes and a second one that was "zesty" tomotoes.  Gave it a little kick.

This was quite good-hubby didn't even complain that there was no meat. Minor changes- fresh tomatos, more parm cheese, skim milk with light cream (1/2 c each with 1T flour was perfect amount of liquid). I would maybe add in some sauteed onion and chicken sausage maybe.

This is a restaurant quality recipe.

I made this and my daughter said to me, this tastes just like what I ordered at Olive Garden last week!

My husband does not like anything with spinach in it but really enjoyed the meal.

I have also made this with chicken mozzarella ravioli and lobster ravioli and the meal was fantastic. I buy the different types of ravioli pre-made at Costco.

Nice dish for summer.  Did take suggestions to use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Fresh is much better & more appealing.  A personal preference is using sun dried tomato vineagrette for all my Italian dressing recipes.  Will make this again as a main or side dish.

A great pasta dish which has become a favorite in our house. Easy and very delicious, definitely restaurant quality. However, I do add way more than a cup of spinach.

Followed the recipe exactly with two minor changes.  I used a box of frozen spinach, thawed.  Also, used a 20 oz. bag of frozen cheese tortellini.  It turned out delicious and the kids even enjoyed it, in spite of the spinach.  Served it with garlic bread and a salad.  Nothing fancy, but it is fast and filling.

This was really tasty!  spinach and tomato are always a winning combination.  I used n/f half and half and 2% milk to cut down on fat, but it was still really flavorful.  I'll be making this again!

New family favorite!  I did add extra salt and more baby spinach.  I had to use cheese ravioli as our small town store didn't have tortellini but it was an easy substitute.  I let the spinach wilt a little while cooking in the tomatoes so that I could use more.  

My kids, ages 3 and 6, thought it was super.  Easy enough that my culinary-challenged husband could whip it up in a flash.

Italian is my favorite kind of food, and i eat it often, so i was excited about this recipe. It tasted good, but it wasn't fabulous. I made it almost exactly according to the recipe. I probably won't make this again because there's many things i like more.

I did like the others and added more cheese (about 1/2 cup) and more garlic and italian sausage.  This is a really good basic recipe.  My kids said that it was better than Jonny Carinos (we had just eaten there)!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and it was fabulous.  I didn't expect it to have such good flavor, but the combination of ingredients really makes it quite tasty and flavorful.  The only thing I will do differently when I make it next time (which will be soon) is double or even triple up on the spinach, and try a little more garlic since we all love the flavor.  This will definitely become a regular.  My 4 yr old and 7 yr old (who are normally picky) made faces when they saw it, but they sure had no problem eating it and one even asked for seconds!

This was amazing!!  I used A LOT more spinach than called for. I also added some hot sausage at the advice of another user, as well as green onion and more garlic.  Instead of the milk and cream I used about 2 cups of Classico Mushroom Alfredo.  It was delicious! I will for sure make this again. :) Enjoy!

I used frozen spinach, frozen cheese tortellini and everything still turned out great.  I used garlic salt instead of garlic, because that's what I had, and omited the cream.  Tasted fantastic and so simple.  I will make again and again and again.

Excellent.  My only addition to give it some more health, was to serve it (VERY hot) over a thin layer of fresh baby spinich.  My men (45 and 16) ate it up!!

This was really very good.  I agree with the "more spinach" suggested and added a bag of spinach and also doubled the parm. cheese amount.

I tried this recipe, but with a different twist. I usely cook from scratch. However, I was invited to a girlfriend's get-together and I didn't feel like preparing anything from scratch. I also didn't know what I was going to cook. So I checked my e-mail messages to see what "allrecipes. com had to offer. For time sake and being on a tight budget. I substituted the package of tortellini for a box of rotini shells, added two jars of Alfredo sauce instead of the milk and cream. Followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out great! It was a hit at the get-together. I give this recipe 5 stars.

This was a hit and simple to prepare. I thought the sauce could have been a little thicker, but overall very good. Will try with shrimp or chicken and some mushrooms. Made exactly as directed and actually doubled it.

This has to be one of the best meals I have had. I made this twice now. The first time I substituted the can of tomatoes with fresh tomatoes because that was all I had and it was by far better than using the can. I felt the can of tomatoes and the juice was just too much. I will def make this again but using only fresh tomatoes! Thanks for sharing.

Was sort of bland. Based on the recipe I gave it 3 stars, once I added some tomato paste and a little extra seasoning it was delicious.

This was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted like something you'd get at a restaurant. My kids turned their noses up when they saw me chopping the spinach, but they all loved it. I will definitely make this again, and I think next time I will add shrimp.

very good!  This was quick and easy and my kids liked it!  It could use a little more flavor, but I like a lot of garlic.  I added twice the minced garlic that it called for and a little garlic salt.  I also used frozen spinach and petite diced tomatoes.  Will probably make again.

What can I say, this was decadent. 

This is what I did: I browned some spicy italian sausage and then added a bunch of garlic and red pepper flakes, along with chili powder (i like spice). I then added the stewed tomatoes, basil, salt, pepper, spinach and mushrooms (crimini). I mixed that all together than added half a tub of cream cheese, non fat milk and a little bit of flower. I let that simmer for a while and put it on 8 oz of cheese tortellini. OMG this was the best thing i've had in a while!

I have made this dish three times now, the first time I made it exactly as the recipe says, and I liked it alot. The 2nd time I changed it a bit by adding cubed ham, and it was even better, The third time I added chicken, and it was okay. I recommend trying it with a  bit of cubed ham, Just cook the ham a little but, and add it to the dish. Its great

This is a family favorite!  I add the spinach at the very end because I do not like the texture of cooked spinach (slimy).  I also use half the cream noted and use skim milk added slowly to get the right consistency (this lowers the fat and calories a little).   This is a keeper!

Such a great, easy recipe! I followed other users' advice and used a bit more spinach (maybe 1.5 cups chopped fresh spinach). I didn't really measure the garlic - I just diced up a large-ish clove. I also used whatever milk I had on-hand (about 1 cup 2%, 1/2 cup skim) and added 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It was fabulous! I will definitely make this dish again.

This is a great recipe. It only took me 30 minutes from start to the table - awesome. The flavors are great. Like others, I didn't use the heavy whipping cream - just regular 2% milk and an extra teaspoon of flour. It thickened up great, just with fewer calories!

Very yummy and easy to prep. I had followed other reviewer suggestions and used milk with cornstarch (was still soupy, so may need to adjust the amounts). I also sauteed garlic and onion first, then added a mixture of kale, spinach and real tomatoes (instead of canned). Thanks for the recipe!

One of the best vegetarian dishes I have ever found.  Really easy, but very satisfying.  I make this all the time and even my picky kids like it.

I loved this one - the sauce is fabulous.  I diced fresh tomatoes, onion and garlic instead of canned.  Next time I'll put some fresh basil in as well.  I added extra spinach and parmesan.  YUM!  This is going to be a regular at our house.

This was fantastic! I used fresh tomato onion and garlic.  I also added sauteed mushrooms and doubled the spinach.  I substituted the flour for about 5 Tbls bread crumbs or so.  The bread crumbs thickened the sauce very nicely and added alot of flavour! I will be making this again!

Very good dish!  I thought there was too much pepper in it first time making it as I'm not a fan of TOO much pepper, but next time, I'll 1/2 or 1/4 the amount and it should be great.  Love it and I'll be making this again!

This was EXCELLENT and very easy make.  I used DiGornoi Cheese stuffed tortellinis and followed the recipe spot on. For the spinach I used a bag of spinach salad and it toworked perfectly.  My boyfriend LOVED it as well.  This one will be a favorite in my house!!

Hubby, me & 12 yo daughter loved it, my 5yo son was a little less than thrilled. Modifications included using diced Italian tomatoes (couldn't find with garlic only), so I omitted the added dried basil, tossed in a Tbsp of chopped fresh sweet basil, minced 1 lg & 1 sm clove of garlic, and used 1 c. of whole milk & 1/2 c. of fat free half and half. Also used preshredded Italian cheese blend (parmesan, asiago, romano, and fontina) and increased the amt to about 1/2 c. based on other's recommendations. The finished product tasted rather sweet to me, so I increased the salt to about 1 1/2 tsp total to counter the sweetness. The end product was a deliciously creamy sauce (altho a bit pink as others mentioned) with good flavor. I just wish I had added more spinach to the mixture! Thanks for the recipe Lela!

A very nice change from opening the usual jar of pasta sauce. One kid didn't like the green-look of the sauce, but my husband and other kid really liked it.  I'm packing up the leftovers for a school lunch.

This is really good Lela.  Easy to make.  My son usually doesn't like creamy sauce on pasta and liked it.  Husband also enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe except I used half & half... (what I had on hand).  I could eat it often, but I know my family would get tire of it.  I could probably get away with making it once a month.  =)

Followed the exact directions.  The dish is great and be prepared in little time.  I made this dish ahead of a dinner party I'm planning and gave a container of this to my next door neighbors for their opinion.  They loved it! With leftovers, I did compliment it with grilled chicken.  I will definitely pass this recipe to others!

I made this last night for dinner, and I really enjoyed it! Because my partner and I like some extra punch for the taste buds, I pretty much doubled the spinach, parmesan and minced garlic amounts. The sauce had a nice consistency and was very flavorful, but not too much (at least for us!). I plan to make this again soon with the addition of Italian sausage for a tad more substantial option.  An additional plus was the time involved, making this a no-brainer for an excellent meal during the work week.  Thanks for posting, Lela!

WOW!!!! A wonderful dish! Sooo YUMMY and easy to make! I was able to make this on my lunch hour for my family and we loved it! I did grill some chicken breasts to have to pour this on top of! I did substitute my fresh garden salsa that I make with onions and garlic for the canned tomatoes, only because I wanted an excuse to use it! With the grilled chicken the only thing missing was garlic toast and it would have been perfect! I am definately making this many times again, only next time it will be with a house full of company. It is too good not to share!

This was delicious! I did use skim milk and added a little extra flour to thicken it to cut back on the fat, and I also added heaps more spinach and added it right at the end so that it wasn't soggy.  Other than that I thought the recipe was perfect. I loved the combination of tomatoes and the creaminess. Might try some mushrooms in it as well next time too

If I could give this 6 stars I would! This was a wonderfully easy and tasty recipe that I plan on making over and over. I made this exactly as stated without any changes or additions however, next time I might add some grilled chicken or shrimp and maybe a little red pepper flakes for a bit of kick - the options are endless. YUM!

This was sooo good! I did substitute fat free half & half for the cream and milk to cut back on fat/calories, but it still tasted wonderful! I also added a bit of pesto as another reviewer suggested and it was a nice addition. I also think using shredded parmesan instead of grated makes it better....and also tastes great sprinkled on top when serving! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!!! Definitely a keeper!

So delicious and so fast!  This is definitely a keeper...the sauce would be great on ravioli, or any pasta really!!  The only difference in my version was I diced my own onions and added minced garlic since I bought the plain diced tomatoes to avoid added salt.  Hubby and I LOVED this..thanks!

This dish was so easy to prepare and so delicious.  My husband says he wants me to make this again.  I used the tortellini stuffed with pesto from Trader Joe's.  There were a few minor changes I made: instead of making the cream sauce, I used Butioni Light Alfredo Sauce (because I already had this on hand).  It made the dish so creamy and I think the fat content a little lower then using heavy cream.  I also doubled the spinach and the basil (I used fresh basil as well).  Loved it!

So Simple to make and it came out delicious.  I did use Corn starch instead of flour (didn't have any) and it came out a perfect consistancy.  I also used more spinach than called for (love spinach).  Lastly I paired this recipe with the Philly Pesto Crostini's, Great combination.  My husband said he felt like he was at a restaurant.

This was a fast, tasty, and cheap meal. The only thing that makes this recipe better is fresh ingredients... and maybe something to balance out the sweetness of the tomatoes in cream. I changed: all fresh ingredients except the tortellini, 3x spinach (cut chiffonade), 3x garlic, added a half onion (finely diced and sauteed). Overall, good dish. I still think it's missing one last thing... find it and this would be 5 stars. ***edit: I was looking through the reviews, and someone suggested pesto to freshen up the dish... I think it would work!

This was a very easy sauce to make and definitely beats buying a pre-made version.  I used one 12 oz. can of evaporated milk instead of milk and heavy cream.  I added sliced crimini mushrooms and chicken (marinated in Italian seasonings, grilled, then cubed).  I threw the spinach in at the end, rather than incorporating it into the sauce from the beginning.  While it was cooking, I tasted it and it was missing something.  I threw in more parmesan cheese (ended up using 1/2 cup total)...still not quite there.  More basil...closer.  Finally, I threw in a bit of pesto sauce that I had on hand and voila, the sauce was perfect!  I will make this again, maybe next time with some lobster instead of chicken and a different pasta.

Just wonderful dish! Pretty and flavorful. I added mushrooms and as many reviewers who could not find sauce with onions and garlic  I added about 1/4 of an onion and and extra clove of garlic. My teenager asked me to make it again!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. We decided not to use spinach tortellini and instead use bow-tie pasta but the dish came out spectacular.  The only alterations we made were as follows: Used fat free milk Used one brick of frozen spinach-cooked as per package directions, strained Used extra garlic--we're garlic lovers! Used can of tomatoes and garlic, but couldn't get one with onions so we chopped up onions and put them in at the same time.  We'll be making this recipe again. Maybe substituting something for the heavy cream so as to lighten up the dish calorie-wise.

I have made this once.  Followed recipe almost exactly.  I added a little extra cheese and spinach.  My husband and I love this!  This is quick and easy to make after a long day at work.  I've already bought the stuff to make it again.  Thanks!

Yummers.  Funny story:  I was looking on allrecipes for a dish to use up a bag of Barilla tortellini I had in the pantry, and found this one.  I later realized I had saved it to my recipe box over 2 years ago.  Shame on me for not making it until now. I added 4 hot Italian sausages, casings removed and crumbled, used Italian seasoning blend instead of the basil and a whole bunch of spinach, chopped.  I'll be making this again for sure.

This is so good.  I use frozen tortellini and all half and half instead of the milk/cream combo (isn't that what half and half is?).  Creamy, cheesy and delish.

YUMMM - simple and super easy! Had all the ingredients at home except fresh spinach, had frozen so I substituted that. I also had some bacon in the fridge which I added and used fresh basil instead of dried - it was really delicious.

Another great find! I used all fresh ingredients, added some sautéed with onion and garlic lean turkey meat, substituted heavy cream with light sour cream diluted with fat free milk, added a few tablespoons of white wine, and a small jar of artichoke hearts. Didn’t have tortellini on hand, so I cooked jumbo shells instead. Since the shells were very jumbo empty inside, I loaded each shell with the above mentioned mixture. Poured sauce on top…and it was heavenly!

I give this a 4 star ONLY because I listened to some reviews that said it was a little runny. I used only 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup cream cheese (4 ounces). Plus in my country they dont sell tomatoes with onion and garlic so i sauteed 1/4 cup onions and 2 garlic cloves
this came out great and the cream cheese gives it a special texture

Super easy and delicious!  Made it for company and they freaked out.  The spinach is so minimal, don't let that scare you, if you're not a spinach fan.  Don't overcook the tortellini, it gets mushy real quick.  I will make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly for rating purposes.  I did, however, brown some Italian sausage to add to the pasta after it was done.  I only did this because I was serving this as a main dish and wanted to make it a little more filling.  I used fresh spinach and I don't think using frozen spinach would compare to using fresh spinach.

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  It was really good.  I sauteed some chopped red onion, added more garlic, and a little bit of cream cheese to make it creamier.  I didnt have fresh spinach so I used 1/2 cup of frozen and it turned out great.  Will make again, thanks!

Fantastic!  Perfect to use up the overabundance of tomatoes & fresh basil from the garden.  I used 4-5 tomatoes, fresh basil, a lot more spinach, a quarter of a diced onion, extra garlic.  The sauce amounts I kept the same.

This is pretty darn good. We used skim milk only, no cream or half and half. Much healthier this way and you can simply add more flour and/or cornstarch to thicken it up. This sauce would be great on any pasta - definitely one to add to the recipe book.

I wanted to try this recipe for a change instead of pasta, it turned out pretty good! My husband and I are not fond of tortellini but we liked it. It's a nice change to my cooking and it's very easy to make.

I made this for guest, it was very easy and quick.  They really enjoyed it, especially the sauce, which I several with homemade bread. I sauted a bunch of chopped green onions and garlic in olive oil before adding zesty diced tomatoes and frozen spinach. I will make it again and use penne and diced chicken.

Good, not great.  I added shredded chicken from a freshly roasted chicken I cooked in my rotisserie oven.  I used a pesto filled tortellini, maybe cheese would have been better.

I loved this one! It is very rich, and was a little too much for my boyfriend, what with the creamy sauce and cheese tortellini, so I've also just done the sauce with shells or penne, and it tastes great as well!

Mild but good flavors. I used 10 oz of frozen chopped spinach and added about 1/4 cup of water to it and the tomatoes initially because it seemed a little dry. Baked fresh bread to wipe up what remaining sauce there was. Delicious and easy. Definitely going to make this again.

STUPENDOUS!  This sauce was wonderful and thickened up to just the right consistency.    I used half-n-half, fresh basil and double the amount of spinach for a delicious lunch I will definitely make again.  GREAT!

If you have not made this you must. Please be sure to add this recipe to your rotation. Very good. My alterations included using a can of tomatoes and green chiles that was hot (good flavor), I also doubled my garlic and spinach amount. I served this with some warm french bread to help soak up the sauce. Yummy. I have plenty of left overs, I may add some shrimp to this tommorow.

I love this recipe! I have already made this numerous times and each time I receive the best compliments. 
This is perfect when you don't feel so good with a little french bread, it'll cheer you up real fast.

OOOOH yum!  Very good, I too added italian sausage and used just normal canned tomatoes.  I did add some more garlic.  It is such a pretty dish too.

This was probably the best meal that I've ever made!!  EVER!  It was super easy with simple ingredients.  I will probably make a few changes next time in an effort to make it a bit more healthy.  I'll use the entire bag of prewashed spinach, reduce the amount of salt, use fresh basil, and possibly use less of the heavy cream.  I will definitely be adding this dish to the rotation.  YUM!!

My entire family loved this meal. They are picky eaters and Im always trying to find recipes that "hide" veggies and taste good, this was perfect for the spinach.  I added grilled chicken and used fresh garlic, parm cheese, and onion. 
**Update 11-07-07** I needed a fast recipe so I made this again, but didn't have spinach and I used barilli 3 cheese tortellini.  It was still very good and tasty.  It did lose a little something without the spinach but still good.  Last time I used regular pasta and I think a cheese tortellini was much better.

This recipe was very easy and quick to put together.  It had a lot of flavour and taste.  I put it in the oven with parm cheese on top for 10 minutes just for an extra touch.  Very good.

This is DELICIOUS!!  The sauce is what makes the dish.  I only used half the flour and I seasoned everything with garlic salt while it was simmering.  It's Grrrreat!!!  When I make it next week (yes this is going to be a regular) I'm going to double the sauce, add shrimp, real crab meat and scallops.  I can't wait!

I really liked this.  I was in a panic of what to make for dinner and this made my husband very happy.  I added hot turkey sausage (browned first in pan) then i took them out and added sliced mushrooms..then added the other ingredients.  I also added tomato paste (a squirt from the tube).  I let that cook and added the milk mixture.  This was really good...i think next time i might add more spinach and more mushrooms and omit the sausage (my husband liked the meat in there). I might also add different types of mushrooms.

I prepared this as written, and we thought it was a solid 4 star recipe.  In a side pan I sauteed 2 links of spicy italian sausage (drained the fat), 8+oz of fresh mushrooms and more baby spinach.  We mixed that in the the original recipe, and YUM!  5 stars with the additions.  As is, I think it is more of a side dish.

Delicious.  I added 1/2 cup of parmesan instead of just 1/4 cup.  I used 20 oz of tortellini instead of 16 oz and there was plenty of sauce for it all.  I used 10 ounces of frozen spinach instead of the fresh and fat free half and half instead of the milk and heavy cream.  Very delicious and quick and easy to make.

REALLY good! Used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, used 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the milk & heavy cream and then put in about 3 cups of fresh whole spinach. I didn't have to use flour either and it was nice and thick. I also sauteed 2 chicken breast and diced it up for this recipe which was nice. This was so ENJOYABLE!  Served with a nice salad and french basil/cheese bread. It will become a regular instead of store bought spaghetti sauce.

Very good base sauce.  I did alter it (sigh =).  Used penne instead of tortellini, half and half instead of cream, and added cooked Italian sausage for my meat-loving husband.  It was a hit, and the leftovers were even tastier.

Rated 3 stars because I thought that was nothing special. I have to admit I did substitute 1/2 and 1/2 for the cream which could have made the difference. If I were to make again, I would increase the garlic to 2 cloves, add 2 tsp cornstarch (I used 1 tsp)diluted in water and would add mushrooms.

Absolutely delicious! I made this last night and got rave reviews. This was very simple to make and did not require very many ingredients.  The only changes that I made was that I added some fresh tomatoes and some fresh basil. MMM very yummy. Thanks for this great recipe!

Wow!  Good.  I did make a few changes:
* Added 1 T Tomato Paste - I knew we would want more flavor
* Omitted Cream - for health reasons
* Used 1 1/2 C LF milk with 2 T flour and 1/2 T cornstarch - thickened up really nicely.

I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today.
* Added another t of garlic

This was so incredible! I read from some of the reviews that the recipe was too bland, and I had accidentally minced too much garlic...I think I ended up adding 2 teaspoons instead onf just one. But my family loved it!

the sauce was pretty good. however, the cheese tortellini we bought was really bad tasting and that threw us off a bit.
the sauce could do with more spices and maybe some mushrooms.
i'd make this again if i could find some good tortellini.

ALL TIME BEST RECIPE EVER!!!!!

With a couple minor variations.  I used penne pasta instead of tortellini, and added 1/2 cup of diced sun-dried tomatoes (from a jar, in olive oil/herbs).  I also finely chopped up the spinach to "disguise" it.  Rave reviews..... I can't speak highly enough of this recipe.  Viola!

Very good, reliable comfort food.
Ingredients of fresh cheee tortellini and parmesan cheese wedge are expensive at $5-6 ea.  I added/changed:
used whole bag baby spinach roughly torn
pinches of cayenne, mustard powder
dash of port wine
minced fresh and sauteed 1 shallot, 3 garlic cloves, 2 ripe romas (added tomato sauce to this). 
Tangy!

Very yummy!  Tastes like something I would order in a restaurant.  I added mushrooms and used fresh tomatoes (adding garlic and onion), but it was good! Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful!!  Tastes just like my favorite dish at my favorite italian restaurant.  The only thing they do different is add a little sliced ham.  I might try that next time.  Our bachelor neighbor happened to be over and ate with my fiance and myself and he just raved over it.  Fiance raved and raved as well.  I had this made in 15 minutes.  Adding to the recipes that are quick and amazing!  Thanks!

OH MY GOODNESS THIS WAY YUMMY! I made only some very minor changes.  I added 1/2 cup white wine, added more fresh spinach - kept adding as the spinach cooked down until it looked right, added some oregano, some red pepper flakes (enough to give a bit of a bite) added more parmesan cheese and it turned out perfect!  Next time I'm adding shrimp or some kind of seafood as it would be perfect with it and making it with some fettucini - I've already sent out the recipe to all my friends!  It was amazing!  Thanks Lela you made me look like the cook of the century in front of my boyfriend and roommate!  Also it was super easy!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It tastes like it's from a restaurant.  I read many of the comments prior to making this and used some of the suggested changes.  I increased the garlic, used fat-free evaporated milk, and added italian sausage.  It was wonderful.  We will definitely make this again.  I'm going to pass it on to family as well.

This recipe is a keeper. I used fresh, diced tomatoes in place of the canned, and substituted evaporated milk for the heavy cream, to cut down on the fat. After mixing it all together, I served it OVER a bit of red sauce. The white and red sauce together was wonderful.

Thanks for a great recipe, will make again and again.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe!  I like a lot of flavor so I doubled the spices. I use plain diced tomatoes and add 3-4 cloves of fresh minced garlic and onion. I've made this a couple of times now - thanks for the wonderful recipe! p.s. I cooked chopped chicken (2 half breasts)in the skillet then added it to the sauce.

I thought this was ok but nothing really outstanding. It probably didn't help that I had some fantastic cheese tortellini at our favorite restaurant last week. They were so much more cheesy and flavorsome. Thanks anyway.

this tasted great! everyone loved it! i didn't use garlic and it was still great. i used more spinach- everything else being according to recipe- and would have been even happier using even more- you can use as much spinach as you want. you might have to take out 3 pots and make a bit of a mess, but it is well worth it!

This is a great recipe. The only change I made was adding extra garlic. The color of the spinach and tomatoes gives the finished product a pleasing presentation.

I doubled the amount of spinach and will probably use even more next time. Didn't have heavy cream so I used half and half. Used porchini tortellini. This was really good. I'll definitely make again and maybe try something to give it a "kick." It's quick and very tasty. Bf even liked it.

Very yummy!  I used a smaller package of tortellini instead of the 16 oz package and I liked the amount of sauce, there wasn't too much.  It was very quick and easy to make.  My husband even liked it.  He's not a big fan of "cheesy pasta" as he calls it!  I will definitely make again.  Thanks!

This was so quick and simple and came out amazing. I used chicken stuffed tortellini cause that’s what I had on hand, and a jar of cheesy Alfredo sauce instead of whisking my own (the cream and parm at the end of the ingredients list). Will definitely be making this again / more often !

This was a very good dish. I did not have canned tomatoes with onion and garlic in it so I minced my own. I added chicken. Next time I think I would use shallots instead of onions and add mushrooms.

So tasty! Per other reviews, I also added extra cheese (why not?!). I’m a big tomato fan and in the future will use an additional can of tomatoes.

Followed the recipe as is, and wasn’t disappointed.  We found every single bite to be rich in flavor! I don’t really “cook” all that often, so I’m no expert... and I found the recipe easy enough to follow and accomplish. I will definitely be making this dish again in the future for my hubby.

Excellent!! I used kale instead of spinach because that’s what I had. VERY good. Would be good topped with shrimp as well. Definitely a do-over!

Wonderful flavor!  I took reviewer advice & sautéed some chopped garlic in OO first. I subbed the canned tomatoes for those with basil & oregano, a fave of mine. I used half & half rather than the milk and cream, and 1 T cornstarch instead of 2 T flour, another reviewer tip. Absolutely loved it, and was impressed at how quick & easy it was. Next time, I’m adding shrimp. Thanks for this great ‘keeper’!

Delicious!  I added Italian sausage and a little bit more cream and milk (didn't want leftover cream).  It was very good, and sat heavy in the stomach, so I would recommend small portions.

It was ok, I doubled it and just used regular milk and a little cornstarch to thicken it up. I also added some onion and garlic, just felt it was kinda missing something.  maybe some fresh basil would have helped. who knows maybe it was because I didn't use the heavy cream.

I made this with fresh tomatoes from our garden. It is delicious. Both my BF and I enjoyed this dish. It comes together easily and we happily ate it with simply a nice chunk of garlic bread. Yum!  I made a double batch so I could freeze some in smaller aluminum lasagna pans. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This recipe is easy and tastes very good. Next time though I will probably use a different kind of tortellini since the sauce is already very creamy.

I made this at the firehouse so my guys expected it a tad spicy.  I substituted sausage tortellini for cheese tortellini and added bay leaves and red pepper flake to the recipe....and doubled it.  The fellas thoroughly enjoyed!!  Great recipe that I’ve added to our book!

I followed this almost exactly. I added 2 cups of baby spinach. I had too much cream sauce for my taste, so next time I’ll only do about 2/3 of that and I would add even more spinach. The taste was excellent though and I can’t wait to make it again!

I made this on a whim one night. I used fusilli pasta instead of tortellini and it was excellent. So good and so easy. One pan meal that’s done in about a half an hour. My family loves it. I make this all the time now.

This is a keeper.  I used fresh spinach & fresh basil.  Didn't measure anything. Threw in 2 hand fulls of spinach, a hand full of basil. Two hand fulls of fresh grated parmigiana cheese.   Next time I'll try putting in chicken or sausage.

Pretty good, even my picky boys liked it. I chopped up some prosciutto, fried it in some butter and garlic, and added into the sauce. Nice addition for those who want something with some meat.

I will make this again.  I added cremini mushrooms and doubled the garlic.  I had some leftover bacon crumbles and added them for a little bit of flavor but really didn't notice in the dish.  Hubby loved it.  I would add more spinach next time and maybe a protein instead of the mushrooms.

This is one of our favorite sauces. I add fresh mushrooms, green peppers or whatever I have available. I pour it over angel hair pasta, fresh mushroom ravioli, or bow ties. I cook sausage sometimes or meatballs for some meat. It is super easy to make and basically can’t ruin it. It tastes wonderful on anything. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!! I have made this so many times and each time, I forget just HOW good it is until I take that divine first bite!!! We are hardcore carnivores, so I brown a pound of ground breakfast sausage while the tortellini is boiling, and then just add the rest of the ingredients to the sausage. Definitely a staple!!!

Very quick and simple recipe. I used a can of Hunts Basil, Garlic and Oregano diced tomatoes instead of the Onion and Garlic because my wife cannot eat onion and it still turned out fantastic! Great meal for a night when time is short but you still want something tasty.

I only give it 4 stars because I used double, sometimes triple the seasoning that it suggests. This is my kids favorite meal. I throw in the spinach in the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, because I like it only slightly wilted. I also add about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese into the sauce while it's cooking. I've made this with every meat you can think of. My husband loves this with ground Italian sausage, I love it with lobster ravioli (strongly recommend!!), my kids love it with cheese tortellini or ravioli. I tend to make this when I feed a big group of people because it's easy to make a lot.

We loved this!  It will definitely go in the dinner rotation. I used half & half instead of the separate milk and cream. I also added browned spicy sausage to it. It was delicious. Super easy to make. It would be a dish you could make to impress a guest.

Absolutely love this recipe. It is so quick and easy, as well as delicious. I added chopped onions, mushrooms, and chicken, and used garlic powder instead of garlic (because I didn't have any) and it turned out great.

I used a 24-oz. bag of frozen tortellini and a 10-oz. box of thawed spinach (squeezed out liquid).   Increased to 2 cans of tomatoes , so I also increased the rest of the ingredients by an extra half.  Very easy and tasty no-meat Monday meal for us.  My husband thought it was excellent as well.  Will definitely make again.

This is a fantastic recipe. I made this exactly as stated and it was perfect. I have no complaints. I served it with garlic bread. I think next time I would like to add Italian sausage just to see how it would taste.

INCREDIBLE! Easy, this will be made twice a month in my house. Delicious. I like to do recipes as is ... but... The only thing I added was chopped onion and used Italian seasonings because I didn’t have basil.

I omitted the basil but added some mushrooms for it to be more filling. I think it could have added a tiny bit of heat so I used an itty bit of cayenne, just so it had “something.”  It was an easy recipe that I can eat through the week

Wow!  Made this tonight and it's definitely a keeper. Had to make some subs for what I had (tomatoes with basil and oregano), so I added more garlic to make up for it, and used Italian seasoning instead of basil.  I did add more cheese for our taste preference.  Honestly, a really great, fast meal!! Thanks for sharing ??

This was a good weeknight dinner.  I used fresh basil and also added some leftover marinara sauce (say 1/2 cup) to stretch the sauce a little more for the pasta I had.  Even my spinach-hating teenager scarfed it up.   (shhhh! Don't tell him it was in there!)

Loved this recipe! What a hit! After cooking this, my husband said I should open a restaurant. I decided to make this on a whim, so I didn’t have all the ingredients therefore I improvised and it turned out lovely! Instead of the canned tomato and onion, I cut up a little bit of an onion and a bunch of cherry tomatoes. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream. Turned out amazing! So fresh and tasty, creamy but still light. Will be making this recipe again!

I bought the wrong size tortellini but mixed in ziti and it worked nicely. Next time we make this, and we will make this again, we plan to add some chicken and increase the spinach.

This is good.  We made a couple adaptations. We used Italian sausage, added mushrooms, and deglazed the pan with a little wine. We used a pressure cooker, and I learned that the pressure cooker does a great job with this recipe, But - I would not add the roux till the end! When added before pressure cooking I just kept getting a burn notice, so I had to finally just simmer it till it was cooked through.

So in the end our process would be - sauté the onion and mushrooms until translucent. Add garlic and sauté another minute or two. Add Italian sausage and cook until pink. Then deglaze the pan with a couple tablespoons wine. Now add everything except the milk, cream, and cheese and the flour. Pressure cook on high for 4 minutes. Once that has reached temperature put the milk and flour in a small saucepan and whisk together on medium heat until the roux forms. When the pressure cooker is done add the roux, cream, and cheese. The residual heat will incorporate the dairy as you stir.

This was delish! A crowd pleaser, even my 3 year old ate it. I think next time I might try fresh basil for a little more freshness but overall great choice, and much quicker than the recipe said!

This was easy and really good. I added a can of sliced black olives (liquid drained) and chopped fresh parsley into the sauce and once plated I put some chopped sundried tomatoes (packed in oil) on top with some parsley to garnish. Also sprinkled some Parmesan on top. I froze the leftover pasta with sauce for easy meals. I will definitely make again.

Yummy! I cooked Italian sausage while the tortellini boiled and then transferred to a bowl and added the can of tomatoes, & seasonings, 3 cloves of minced garlic, and added the spinach at the end so it was just wilted instead of soggy. So good!!

This was pretty tasty, with a couple of modifications. My husband loved it. I added garlic powder in addition to the minced garlic. I also used tri-color tortellini. I think it would be great with chicken and/or artichoke hearts as well.

Very easy to make, tastes great. It also feels fairly healthy, the sauce is not super thick yet tastes just as good. I put in more spinach than the recipe asks for. I've also tried this with seafood.

This was absolutely delicious!  Some changes I made: 
I browned sweet Italian sausage first with a little olive oil, then added baby bella mushrooms, 5 cloves of garlic minced.  Let them simmer for about 5 mins.  Then added all the other ingredients.  I did not have heavy cream so I used  2% milk and 1 Tbsp of cornstarch and added 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan.  Husband went back for seconds!

I made a few changes to this recipe; to cut down on salt content I used grape tomatoes instead of a can of tomatoes. The salt called for in the recipe was sufficient. I’d be worried about how much salt there would be if I’d used canned tomatoes.  In addition I used milk and a little half-n-half to cut down on fat content. 

We don’t like soggy or overcooked spinach - so the spinach went in after the milk and flour mixture and turned out great. Also I used tortellini that cook in 4 minutes not 10.

This has been a good dinner the few times I have made it. I always add extra garlic and fresh basil, lots as well. I normally use a whole bag of baby spinach because we like it like that! and just wilt it at the end of cooking. Tonight I added sliced squashes and mushrooms. For the white sauce I used whatever white cheese was in the fridge same for the milk.....one cheese had jalapeno which was cool. thank you for sharing

This came out very good though I didn’t have the spinach because I made the meal sooner than I had planned. I also didn’t use heavy cream which I saw someone else say they used corn starch with milk. It still turned out very good though I may use less garlic; since the tomatoes were already garlic and onion. Overall it was easy, quick and yummy!

My wife and I really enjoyed this dish. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I did add mushrooms to it. First time, I’ve ever eaten tortellini. It’s pretty versatile since you can change the sauce to it!

It was ok.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor.  I pureed my tomatoes because the kids don't like chunks of tomatoes.  I also used minced garlic from the jar and I think that messed up the flavor.

This was really good. It is not a thick creamy heavy sauce like I pictured. Very light and very filling. I personally ended up adding more grated cheese for flavor, as well as blending the tomato so it wasn't so chunky. Personal preferences which didn't influence the authentic rating. Thank you!

Easy week day meal. I added pan seared chicken, mushrooms, onions, and crushed red pepper. Makes a tasty base to play with. Will be making again!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was way too saucy. Fresh basil and garlic would have made it better too. If I make this again I will omit the milk and flour, I might even cut back on the cream.

First time not as much flavor as we like, so we made it again with a mixture of sausage and cheese tortellini and hit it with some red pepper flakes.  Delicious.  This is a go-to for us now.  We make it at least once a month.

I too had to add some additional seasonings but this is a great base for a recipe, I used a lot more spinach as well! Kids loved it too.

It was wonderful, I’ve been learning how to cook and this is my first recipe trying from here. Only substitutions I made I used a little slice of velveeta cheese with the Parmesan and I added “slap ya mama” seasoning in as well. Instead of using garlic and onions I just used the powder for both since I hate smelling both.

I started the recipe a little differently. I cooked up 1/2 onion chopped, 3 minced garlic cloves, and olive oil, then added 5 chopped crimini mushrooms. I let all of this get soft, then added the tomato, double the spinach, and other ingredients as described in the recipe. I made this with sausage + cheese tortellini, and had a simple salad on the side. It was AWESOME. I’m adding this to a regular recipe rotation— DELICIOUS!

This was pretty good!  I added a can of mushrooms just because I like them and used half-and-half because I never have heavy cream.  I thought at first it was a little basil heavy but it blends well after the first couple bites.  I think I woud add a second can of diced tomatoes next time.  I would make this again!

I’ve made this many times since finding this two years ago. We add sausage for a bit more flavor.  Also use fresh tomatoes chopped up. Whole family loves it!

Amazing! I of course made changes: 1 lbs (one roll) of Jimmy Dean sausage, sautéed with a chopped small onion and four cloves of garlic, garlic salt and pepper to taste. Brown. Chopped bunch of fresh spinach, one can of tomatoes with garlic and basil (chopped) AND two cups of heavy cream simmer and add 1 cup of graded parm. No need for flour, unless you want it thicker. Add cooked tortellini and toss.

It was fantastic! Left my hubby happy and full. I used fresh tomatoes that i diced instead of canned, and then added 1 whole onion and 4 cloves of garlic to the sautee mixture. I also ended up adding more dried basil than it called for, as well as some thyme. 
It was really good! I had leftover spaghetti noodles in the fridge that i needed to get rid of so i served it with that, and I added some shrimp near the end! It was peeerfect.
If anyone is feeling lazy they can also omit the home-made alfredo sauce and use a jar which you just mix in after you sautee all the veggies, then let it bubble and mix in the pan for around 10 min to let everything come together.

Added more spinach than called for, about 4 cups fresh. Used fresh basil and was delicious!!  Also added some chicken which I wish I hadn’t done. Was still a great meal but the chicken wasn’t necessary.

Ok here’s the lowdown! The base recipe is amazing, however I used at least twice the amount Parmesan cheese, I minced 6 cloves of garlic because the tomatoes I bought were plain. I used 1/4 cup fresh cut basil which I put on in each individual bowl as a ‘topping’. I thinly sliced about a cup and a half of mushrooms which I put in at the beginning along with thin slices of fully cooked Italian sausage, I did like the previous review and put the spinach in after the sauce was done. Seemed perfect! This is going to be a keeper and used often around here. Good luck, thank you for posting and happy eating

Great recipe. I thought it could be a little bland, so I spiced it up. I made tomato sauce from tomatoes outta the garden. I added Italian seasonings, onion, mushrooms, extra garlic, and extra spinach. I used half & half instead of mixing cream & milk. It came out delicious, even for my picky eater.

This is a good dish.  I added more cheese.  1/4 cup just didn't do it.  I couldn't even taste the cheese flavor.  I just added until I liked it, so I really don't know exactly how much, but I'd say at least 2 tablespoons.  Otherwise, I followed exactly.  We will definitely be making again.

I made this as a college student and it was fantastic! Super easy to make and I made garlic bread on the side. I added more garlic because it was a little bland to me, and I added chopped onion. Would recommend to anyone!

It was good! The one thing I changed was I blended some of the tomatoes and spinach in the sauce to make it smoother. my husband does not like vegetables, so blending it into the sauce made was really good.

This was so good. Since I couldn't find tomatoes with onions, I cut up a shallot instead. Otherwise I followed the recipe as instructed. This will be a good winter comfort recipe with a nice salad

Don't read if you don't like changes....

Had no cream, so subbed in extra milk and extra flour, and it still thickened up nicely.  I also sauteed shrimp in garlic and olive oil for a couple of minutes first, removed from pan and then made the sauce.  Used frozen tortellini that cooks in 3 minutes, and frozen spinach as well since it was all I had on hand (unusual).  Threw the shrimp back in at the end just to heat through.  Annie liked it - surprise!

Absolutely delicious, but not filling enough in my opinion to make a whole meal on its own. Works great as a side or heated up for lunch, but in and of itself, its delicious taste isn't enough for a whole dinner.

The  dish was a good starting point but needed more Parmesan cheese and salt. The cheese provided the extra salt needed.

This recipe is great! Easy and delicious, keeps well in the fridge. I made barely any changes, all I did was add mushrooms and extended the ingredients since I used two 10 oz packages of tortellini.  I've made without mushrooms before and it's just great as is, too. Not sure how this could be bland. Make sure you season well, taste your sauce! And use some good, refrigerated (NOT frozen) tortellini! Also, just throw that whole wonderful bag of spinach in there :)

Delicious!  I made it the day before and put it on a pyrex.  Baked it for 30 minutes at 350.  I used 1 cup of whole milk and 1 cup of half and half, instead of 3/4 cup of each for extra moisture  and it was a hit!

Delicious! This is a requested meal when my boys come home on break from college. I follow the recipe except for the following; 1 pound spicy Italian sausage and more Parmesan cheese (to taste). My boys are hearty eaters and want meat with every meal Mom makes! I don 't mind - I'm just happy they're home for a little while.   :)

great and easy dish! I followed some of the other recommendations and added more cheese (1/2 cup), spinach (2 cups), and also italian pork sausage. Not as saucy but could have been that I had a bigger bag of cheese tortellini and added the sausage. Regardless its an awesome dish!

Really good! I used regular cream instead of heavy and I felt the sauce was a little watery. Will need to try it again. Excellent and easy recipe!

I didn't like using the canned tomatoes, I made my own tomato sauce base from ripe tomatoes, onions and fresh garlic- seasoned to taste with oregano, sage and fresh basi. My dish didn't come out as reddish, pink tone like the picture it was nice and creamy bc I doubled on the white sauce sinceI felt like the first time I made it, it wasnt enough. I've made this recipe like 5x already. My husband loves it and it goes well with baked chicken.

This was absolutely delicious!!  I should've made more...

I stuck to the recipe for the most part. I sauteed a small yellow onion in some olive oil with garlic as the base for the sauce. I used 2 cups of spinach and I added a package of quartered, white, button mushrooms. I also used a handful of fresh basil and half the amount of suggested dried basil. 

I made some balsamic bruschetta to go with it, and it was a hit!

This was really good and pretty easy to make.  Next time I would suggest adding some sort of meat to the dish. At first I thought it was going to be way too watery, but everything boiled down nicely and the sauce was thick and creamy.  Easy to make, easy to prep, and easy to clean up!  Thanks for the great recipe!

The cream sauce isn't too heavy.  I added some sausage to give it a little spice and some protein.

I’ve made this a few times and vary it a little sometimes. I’ve added chicken or turkey kielbasa to add a protein element. I’ve used half and half as well instead of heavy cream and it turns out fine. It’s a wonderful dish.

Chopped and used all the fresh spinach in a bunch, as someone suggested, rather than 1 cup, and added extra seasoning at the end. Excellent!

Extremely bland! I made it exactly as it called for.. only thing I did differently was used fresh tomatoes, onions, and garlic instead of canned. The sauce literally had no flavor at all. So I doubled the cheese, garlic, and salt. It had a little flavor but not much. Nobody in my family liked it. My hubby didn't eat it at all and my daughters and I had to drown it in parmesean cheese just to stomach it. Will not be making again.

Good but could be much more flavorful. I plan on sautéing minced onion and garlic together then add the tomatoes, spinach and spices before the cream sauce. I am interested to see how it will turn out. As for following this recipe, it is good and my 12 year old son loved it.

Delicious! The entire family loved it. I did add 2 tablespoons of pesto and subbed fresh basil. I think I forgot the flour and it was fine without it. I also only used 1/4 cup whipping cream and the rest FF milk to cut the fat and calories. I added a tsp of cornstarch to thicken. Will definitely make again.

So good and easy to make. The only change I made was I cooked sausage and added it. Serve with a baguette so sop up the sauce.

Tasty, fast and simple to fix.  Next time I will add fresh basil, garlic cloves, some onions and chicken or shrimp.

This was OK...nothing amazing. I thought the sauce was a bit bland. If I make it again I'll definitely add some extra seasoning.

I added seasoned chicken to dish and used fresh basil. I agree that it needs more cheese. Was really, really good! Family gave it a thumbs up.

Very good - I had a bunch of spinach to use up. Changes: I first sautéed 5 cloves of crushed garlic and one small onion. Then added at least 3 large handfuls of spinach, 1 can of tomatoes plus 3 frozen ones (I freeze them if they are starting to peak and I can't use them - then I throw them in pasta sauces like this) along with everything else. Used all milk, no cream. Used at least 3/4 park cheese. Yummy!

I made a few changes based on the feedback that it was a bit bland.  I had several ingredients that needed to be used up.  I sauted a bit of bacon and and used chopped fresh roma tomatoes with the garlic.  Then I added fresh mushrooms with the spinach.  I added  bit of pesto with the basil salt and pepper.  I used half and half  milk instead of heavy cream along with the milk.  I added all the cheese, but feel this could be cut back.  It made a lot of sauce so I only used half of it and froze the other half for next time.  I used 500grams of garlic chicken tortellini.  All in all it was tasty, filling and satisfying with the modifications and additions I made.

This has been a favorite in our home for several years now! We've served it to guests with favorable results as well. I like to use fresh tomatoes instead of canned, try it, you won't regret it!

This received rave reviews from my family. I followed the recipe exactly as written and added sausage and mushrooms to make a full 'one pot meal. My 2 huge teenaged boys and husband loved it and said this needs to be in our regular rotation. My 16 year old even said it could use more spinach! Very very good

Love this! I make changes but it's great as is, too. People ask me to make it all the time.  My only change is to add more spinach and a bit more cheese.

SO GOOD!!! Reading reviews, I decided to add Italian Sausage and that made it amazing. I believe that the recipe would have been very bland otherwise but with that Italian Sausage, it made it PERFECT!

The family loved it. I did add four Oktoberfest Sausages which I cut into medallions and precooked. I added them in after the cream mixture to warm before combing with the tortellini.

Made this tonight. It was so good. Kids loved it, so I will definitely make it again. It was meant to be a side dish, but I went ahead and added mushrooms and chicken breast to the recipe to make it the main entree. I got Giovanni Rana's Cheese Lovers Tortelloni free with a Fry's Friday free download coupon. I would purchase again. First I cut up the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces, seasoned, and sauteed. Then followed the recipe. Will use chicken thighs next time. Added Shiitake mushrooms, since I got them for $.99 on manager's special for quick sale, but will use Baby Portabellas next time. I was pretty heavy handed with all the ingredients. Recipe called for 1/4 Parmesan, used 1/3. 3/4 cup heavy cream, used 1 cup since it came in a half pint package. No need to save the rest. Served with bread sticks and salad. I gave it 5 stars because all three of us liked it and that's not easy when trying new recipes. Lol.

This is my new favorite Italian meal recipe!  My husband loved it, too, which was obvious by the three helpings he had!  I sliced and browned up some Italian sausage to add to it; otherwise I followed the original recipe, and it couldn't have been better!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! Next time, I'll add mushrooms, a little crushed red pepper (we did while we were eating it), and maybe some extra spinach and a little more salt. But overall, it was super tasty! Will make again. :)

Really yummy & filling!  A little heavy.  Not difficult to make.  I think next time I'll add some sliced Italian sausage so it feels more like a main course and throw a salad on the side.  Shoulda doubled it right off the bat so we could enjoy leftovers because it was gooood!

My daughter and I enjoyed this.  We added chicken and it was good.  However, if you are going to add meat, I think that sausage would give it better flavor.

I have made this a few times just as written and it was great. Sliced up and fried some smoked sausage this time and added it to the mix and I think it's perfect. Wife and kids love it too.

I have made many recipes from this site. And I have to say, this is one of the top 5 for me!! I consider cooking a hobby, so I play with recipes and make them to my liking. I really hate when people change a recipe and then rate it. But even though I changed this one a bit, I can't keep the love to myself. I browned about a pound of ground Italian sweet sausage and then added some baby sliced up baby portobellos and a large handful of frozen shrimp thawed. I used half and half and increased the amount because of the extra meat and shrimp. So increased the flour and cheese as well. The result was a great restaurant quality meal. I can't wait to make it for family and friends and hear the rave reviews!!

Very versatile recipe - I only had a big can of tomatoes, so increased everything else. Added  some broth to make is a bit more like soup, and extra garlic.  Everyone liked it - thanks!

This was delicious but I did make changes. I added some chopped cooked bacon and sliced smoked sausage. Fried those up first then added in the tomatoes, spinach etc. I also went heavier on the garlic and spices to our taste. It's a keeper.

I've made this twice now and it was delicious both times.  The first time I made I followed the recipe to a T.  Because it makes quite a bit, I froze individual servings and thawed for my son when he came home, he thoroughly enjoyed it as well as I did.  The second time I used half and half rather than heavy cream and crisped up 3 slices of thick bacon and mixed it in when the dish was done. Excellent!  A very easy and tasty dish.

I LOVE this recipe! I make it for my family  and they just gobbled it up!! (used a meat tortellini)The canned tomatoes and spinach makes it taste so fresh!! The creamy sauce is just perfect, not too heavy.
Will be making again tonight! Highly recommend this recipe!

The only one that did not like it much was my daughter and that is only cause she hates onions. I loved it. Will be making again just without the onions, I will use onion powder instead.

Any recipe that's quick, easy, and delicious is always a win in my household.  I had to make dinner last minute, and I decided to give this recipe a try.  I made very little changes.  Honestly, I just wanted more of the sauce, so I used a little extra of everything.  I had dinner completed in less than an hour, and it was a very good recipe!  I will be using this over and over again whenever I'm in a rush to get dinner on the table!

Pretty good, but a bit bland, even with double the garlic. Added a corn starch slurry to thicken the sauce up a bit. I'd make it again.

I made this dish and it is delicious to me.  I like the diced tomatoes with the tortellini and the soup quenches my hunger.  I used  petite diced tomatoes because I already had them but the next time I will by regular garlic diced tomatoes because I need more sauce or buy an additional can of diced tomatoes.

Made it twice, first time by the recipe. The second time I threw chicken in with fettuccine noodles instead of tortillini. This sauce is so good an simple to make. It takes no time at all.

My family LOVED it!!  My husband thinks a meal without meat is odd, so I added ground Italian sausage and also substituted 1/2 a jar of sun-dried tomatoes for the plain ol diced tomatoes...it was heaven!!  the next time I made it, I added mushrooms!!

This is my new favorite dinner of all time. I added  two heaping spoonfuls of sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil (about 1/3 of the jar), and I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes because its what I had on hand. Also, this made enough sauce for 1.5 bags of tortellini.  A dash of dried red pepper gives it just enough bite and a heaping handful of "Italian blend" cheese was thrown on top because it was cheaper than parmesan.

Amazing. I've made it twice this month already, and plan on making it many more times!

I have made this twice now - normal size  for my family and a double portion for our Bible study - and both times it was a smash.  Very simple and quick.   Frozen tortellini, frozen spinach, canned tomatoes. A few spices and creamer for the sauce.  My favorite type of recipe. Easy and delicious!

4 stars because of some alterations. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to use 1/4 c cream and 1/2 c milk, and I also drained the tomatoes. The sauce came together in no time and coated the tortellini beautifully.

Good, simple tasting recipe (as is.) I used dried tortellini which was a big mistake. I did not like it, the stuffing to me was very dry. Next time I will use fresh tortellini. I'm thinking the next time I make it that I will add Italian sausage and mushrooms to it.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe as written except I doubled the cheese and spinach, added fresh shrimp, and seasoned it to our tastes. Tortellini from the freezer section worked well. Even the picky 5 year old asked for seconds.

This recipe will definitely be in regular rotation at my house! I took the advice of another reviewer and added some Italian sausage and red pepper flakes, deglazed the pan with Pinot Grigio. And proceeded with the recipe as written. Delicious!

Delicious.  I used sweet Italian sausage tortellini which added more flavor, fresh basil and fresh tomatoes, garlic and onions.  Very flexible recipe and I did not measure out the tomato mix.  Very quick and easy for a weeknight dinner.  It benefits from more pepper as the original recipe was a tad bland.  Would make again.

Better with tortellini.  Also tried using an increased amount of spinach as other reviewers suggested - I won't do this again because I think it dampened some of the other flavors.  I used mushrooms - yummy.  1.5 cup of milk instead of milk and heavy cream - have used skim and 2% without seeing any problem or loss of texture.  As much as I'd like to keep this veggie, I think my husband would would be happier with meat - will take someone's suggestion of browning some chorizo or something before adding the tomatoes, etc.

Here is my adaptation: 3 bags of frozen tortellini,  1 box frozen chopped spinach,  1 LG can diced tomatoes? 1 qt half-and-half,  basil,  garlic, 4 Oz of cream cheese.  Throw it all in the crock pot for 3  hours, stir every half hour or so.  Yummy!

Great easy weeknight meal! I added 1 whole bag of baby spinach to the fresh tortellini, and when I tasted it, I felt like although it was good, it was maybe missing something. I read some reviews while in the kitchen and added crushed red pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules, and 5 cloves minced garlic; next time I will try and add fresh basil and perhaps (garlic seasoned & stir fried) shrimp at the end for a little more of a complete meal. But this is definitely a great staple as I always have these ingredients in the home. I do strongly recommend trying it first as is...and if you feel like you're missing something, you can always Doctor it up a bit to your liking.

I  am now making this for the third time.  I love spinach so I doubled the amount to two cups.  I also like the sauce thicker so I added an extra tablespoon of flour.  I love Parmesan cheese so I doubled the amount to 1/2 cup.  

I have shared this recipe with all three of personal care attendants and they love it too  --  so much so that I've had to print out the recipe for all of them!

This is good and not that hard to make. I followed the recipe to a tee. I didn't have any heavy cream so I googled a substitution which was 3/4 of milk and 1/3 of butter. Melt the 1/3c butter  in a small pan on stove then add the 3/4c milk ,whisk together, add 2 tablespoons flour,  mix together. Let it cook you will see the sauce thickening in about 2 minutes.   This worked great and is cheaper than heavy cream.

I doubled the amount of spinach and added a cup of fresh sliced mushrooms, and some vegetarian sausage. I also made a traditional roux. Instead of trying to whisk flour into milk.  Using 2T. butter, 1/3c. AP flour and 2c. of whole milk.  Thank you for a easy, quick and hearty one pot dinner.

The recipe is great with some additions needed in my opinion. I added mushrooms, diced onion, fresh garlic and ground mild italian sausage. I used fresh basil instead of dried. Tastes great! Thanks for the recipe.

I loved it. For the diced tomatoes, had diced with garlic, basil and oregano. Worked well in this dish.  Upped to 1/3 c. Parmesan cause I loved the stuff. Recipe comes together in under 30 min. Directions on my tortellini were to cook for 3-4 min. So observe your package directions. Next time I think I'd increase amount of spinach.  Really tasty!

totally comforting and delish. A really simple recipe to follow. I used Barilla dry Cheese and Spinach Tortellini (4-12oz bags...on purpose) but I have a hug family so I tripled the batch specially for week night leftovers for my busy house. I wouldn't change a simple thing about this at all. LOVED IT!

This was very good! I used 19oz. of tortellini, added an extra can of tomatoes, doubled the garlic, doubled the parmesan, and I also added a pound of shrimp. The flavor was very good. There was only enough left for my husband to take to work the next day because we ate a ton of it, and it fed 4 of us. I would definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy and delicious!!  I've made this quite a few times. I always double the cheese.  If you want a bit of a kick, add some red pepper flakes.

This recipe was okay. I used used fresh basil & added cooked pancetta. I do feel like it was missing something. Maybe more garlic next time & a bit of salt.

3 stars for recipe as is- it needs some work. Trust me- double the cheese, triple the spinach and garlic. Great sauce, and the meal if you throw in some chicken or some sliced sausage

I only give this 4 stars because I felt that the sauce was too bland on its own. I touched it up with 1 tsp cayenne, 2 tsp oregano, an extra tsp of pepper and a little garlic salt. Then it was perfect!

This is one of my family's favorite! It's easy and quick to make  so when I know I don't have much of time after work to make dinner this gets put into the menu. 

The only thing I've added  to  this recipe is sometimes I throw in some meat in it - like grilled chicken or Italian sausage.

I think I'll make it the same way as I made it the second time from now on.
. The first time I made it, I followed the directions pretty much as given except I added the spinach into the sauce and pasta at the very end.  The sauce was pretty  thin and looked pinkish because of the canned diced tomatoes.  I had leftovers and they went bad pretty fast.

2. The second time I made it, it was much more successful and I give it 4 - 4.5 stars.  I used 9 oz tortellini,  1 fresh diced tomato, 1 Tbsp cornstarch instead of  2 Tbsp flour,  and half and half instead of heavy cream.
     I mixed the cornstarch, half and half, and milk together in a small bowl before adding it to a large skillet.  I then added all the other ingredients, except for the tortellini and spinach, into the skillet.  I heated the mixture until just boiling, turned the heat down to low and let it simmer, stirring occasionally.   I stored the spinach separate from the pasta and sauce and added spinach after I reheated leftovers.
   The sauce was much thicker and had the correct coloring, the leftovers lasted longer, and it tasted better.  
    With the changes I made the second time the dish was only 3 - 4 servings.

This was absolutely delicious!  My son chose this for his meal to make this week and it was simple enough for him to follow along and the results were wonderful.  We didn't have any of the canned tomatoes with onions and garlic, so we just added plain canned tomatoes and a whole onion diced small and a bit of garlic. To be honest... the sauce alone (and a brief visit with a stick blender) and this could be called 'Cream of Tomato Bisque'!  Very flavorful!

This recipe  was very easy and delicious. The only change I made was that I only had diced tomatoes so I added garlic and onion. I am always searching for vegetarian meals. I did get a mmmmmmm from the hubby. Although he did mention a little pancetta would have been tasty.

Wonderful! Like some of the other reviewers,  I used a cup and a half of milk (Lactaid, actually) thickened with flour. I added a liberal amount of basil and oregano.  Without it would have been bland.  I added about 5 or 6 cups of spinach to get my veggies in.  I also added chicken sausage. Quick and delicious!

I have made these several times and it is always good.  This time around I made a few changes to make it slightly healthier.  I added some sautéed vegetables, along with the spinach.  When it came to the liquid, I used 3/4 can of fat-free evaporated milk.  The dish was very good, just not quite as good as with the cream!

This was tasty.  I added about double the spinach and a little more parmesan, salt and pepper.  I think red chili flakes would be great in this recipe but I didn't have any on hand. Super easy to put together and not too many ingredients.   Great, quick recipe!

I thought it was okay...but my family loved it!  This is just not my favorite type of dish but I thought it seemed like something my wife and girls would like and I was right.  It really has a good homemade Italian flavor and is very easy to make.

I used half and half in place of the milk and cream because it's what I had on hand.  As others have noted, mushrooms and some chicken would probably be a great addition.

This recipe was great and I made per recipe.  Excellent side dish with beef or chicken.  Great as leftovers too!

My husband made this and he skipped the cream because we didn't have any so it turned out like a pasta instead of soup. Tasted fine but it would have been better with the cream or a substitute like sour cream. I think I'd prefer it to have twice the vegetables it calls for, too.

This was very good and surprisingly quick to make. I used diced tomatoes with green chiles for a little heat. Can't say much bad about this one. Just good!

Made with frozen tortellini.  Followed recipe pretty closely except I did use a whole cup of heavy cream (1/2 pint) instead of 1/2 cup and topped off with skim milk.  Didn't measure anything.  This was a very easy meal and enjoyed by all including the 3-year-old, who admittedly picked around the spinach.

Surprisingly good, given that it's fairly simple to make. I will add oregano and hot pepper flakes when I want to jazz it up, but it's very good as written. And it is completed in the time frame stated - 40 minutes.

This was amazing!!! I did my own spin on this...I know that can irritate a few people, however I followed it for the most part..along with some suggestions from other reviews. I doubled the recipe. I sauteed onion,baby ports, garlic,s&p and some store bought pesto..then added 1lb of ground Italian sausage. Added 2 cans plain diced tomatoes and 5 cups of baby spinach...I let this mixture rest for a few minutes, then added 4oz cream cheese. In another sauce pan I melted 1/4 c. butter, then mixed in about 3T of flour,garlic powder, onion powder and lots of fresh ground pepper..oh, and a hit of ground nutmeg..then added Half n Half and shredded parm. Then once my white sauce was complete, then I poured it into the Italian sausage mixture.  I didn't mix the tortellini in with the sausage mix......that way everyone was able to put how much they wanted on their tortellini. My whole family LOVED THIS !!!!!!!!! I think adding pesto was the key to this. Make this, you won't be sorry.

Delish!!!! Added chicken, asparagus, and only used half of the tomatoes because my daughter doesn't care for them. Even had to chop them up into smaller pieces. Used two handfuls of a bag of spinach. This is my new favorite dish! Thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe! The only changes I made was using frozen spinach instead of fresh, and I added extra garlic and cheese. I also felt it was a little bland and added additional salt and pepper and a little Italian seasoning instead of just basil. It was delicious and a big hit with my family.

This turned out pretty good. I did double the diced tomato but everything else as written. It did seem to be a little flat in flavor and seemed to need something, pepper flakes perhaps, I am not certain. Good, simple to prepare, and a good way to have fresh spinach.

Ed likes it better than the similar bow tie version plus this is easier! Try to let it simmer longer so the sauce thickens rather than immediately serving.

My fiance is a 'tortilla, meat, rice' kind of guy - not much use for pastas. I made this dish and he spent the next hour raving about it and making sure that I would make it for him again. Super fast, delicious, and easy. I even forgot the Parmesan cheese - we didn't miss it at all. Love this!

Pretty good! Added lots more garlic and used frozen spinach, squeezing out as much water. I used freshly grated parm cheese, but I think it could have used more, along with more basil. Otherwise, everyone else in the family enjoyed it, and we will see it again on our table!
EDIT: I have now made this again, with the following changes (which I am putting here so I can remember for next time because WOW IT WAS A WINNER!) Added 1/2 pound turkey bacon, onions, 2TBSP butter, small palmful of the frozen spinach with water squeezed out, 4 cloves garlic -1/2 of which sauteeed when I added the spinach, the other 1/2 added towards the end, the same parm, fresh basil, and used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup cream and reserved some tortellini water. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. Delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly as given except in place of Heavy Cream I used Half & Half. This is delicious and the spices are just right. This was served in place of a salad and then I followed it with Chicken Parmesan served with Penne Pasta and Marinara Sauce and Steamed Brocccoli. Made a great dinner for guests.
I could have this with Crusty toasted Sourdough Bread and a glass of red wine for dinner by itself. Would hit the spot on a cold rainy day. Pure comfort food.

This was delicious!!!  I chopped some spinach, then decided it wasn't necessary and just  added whole leaves!  Served with a dinner salad.  I'm definitely going to make this one of our staple meals!!

This meal is simple and delicious. I made the sauce with fresh tomatoes and onion instead of the can. I added a little water to the pan and two table spoons tomato paste. I also didn't have heavy cream so I used 2/3 cup more milk and it was plenty thick. The sauce mixture was so delicious. I will definitely make this again and probably try it on a different type of pasta.

Excellent recipe. The only suggestion that I would make is to add the spinach a little later that is said. It seemed to have wilted too much. But otherwise excellent favor AND QUICK.

This was fabulous! We love Italian food, and this was something a little different than what I usually make. I had some homemade cheese ravioli on hand, so I used that instead of the tortellini. Also, I didn't have heavy cream, so I used 1/2 cup of fat free milk and 1 cup of half and half! It was a big hit!

This was absolutely delicious.  Today I took it to a senior potluck at church.  Usually, I can't get them to eat anything with vegetables in it, but they did enjoy this.  The next time I make it I will try subbing Fat Free Half and Half for the cream to cut some fat and calories.

This was really good and my boys ate it up!  In fact they were all calling dibs on the leftovers after dinner for the next day...  Of course the oldest (22) won!  I used Hunt's fire roasted diced tomatoes.  They have a garlis one but I just had the regular and it turned out great.  I snuck in some chopped kale, mushrooms and red bell pepper.  I don't typically measure cheese as one reviewer said you can never have too much cheese.  Fresh basil would be great in this but couldn't find any at the store and didn't have any dried so I used Italian seasoning.  Overall I think this is well worth it and a great way to sneak in some veggies. : )

We thought this was great. Very simple and quick. Used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream. Other than that, followed as directed.

This was fantastic.  I used beef tortellini as that's all I could find.  I tripled the spinach, put 5 cloves of garlic and doubled the cheese.  It made a lot of sauce.  It was a big hit with the men folks - I'll definitely make again!

I loved this dish, I used regular canned diced tomatoes because that's all I had.
So I sautéed onion and garlic together then put in all the other ingredients.  It was delicious 
This recipe is a keeper

Wow, this is amazing! I made fresh tortellini for the dish and I cut up and added some brats, but the sauce alone definitely gets 5+ stars! I'll be making this again for sure! One thing I would recommend is to double or even triple the recipe! My family couldn't stop eating it!

Update: I think the key to making the regular recipe great to even greater, is to let it sit on a low simmer for a good 30 minutes before eating it. It allows the cheese to melt a little more and the flavors to come out a little stronger.

All 6 of us loved it! I sautéed garlic, (added) mushrooms and spinach before adding to sauce (doubled spinach... next time triple!) I'll also use 2 cans of the tomatoes next time. Thanks for an awesome dish!

This was just ok...we found it to be quite bland, when reheating the following day we added creole seasoning and it was much better even good. Not a favorite... if we make again will definitely doctor up, good base to start with though.

I've made this twice and the first time I used the butternut squash tortellini and it was delicious. I almost think next time, because this sauce is so good, I will pour it over them at the end before serving instead of mixing, as the butternut tort seemed a bit more delicate. The second time I used cheese tortellini but substituted shredded parmesan since I was out of the grated which was still yummy but didn't blend as well and the sauce turned out  stringy. So always use the grated!! Without the spinach, which I love, this would be just another tasty but dairy and starch laden dish.  This recipe is still a keeper  tho and I will make it again and again.

Very Good and pleasing to a "hard to please" husband.
I prefer a slightly thicker sauce - I would add alittle more flour and certainly more spinach (another personal preference)

Doubled spinach and tomatoes (used a quart jar of my home-canned crushed tomatoes).   Left the remainder of the ingredients the same.   Used a few more Italian spices (oregano, parsley, etc).   Excellent and quick.   Oh, and if using refrigerated tortellini, only cook for a couple of minutes and not the 10 minutes as specified, which I assume was for dried tortellini.

This was excellent.  I used meat tortellini, and added fresh mushrooms, artichokes, a tablespoon of olive oil, and a small amount of Bloody Mary mix to the sauce.  I didn't bother with the heavy cream, but rather used skim milk in my sauce.

Quick and Easy!  1-2-3 punch for a weeknight dinner!  This was a huge hit at the family dinner table.  I added sundried tomatoes, fresh chopped onions and doubled the amount of spinach.  LOVELY!  Will definitely add this to the family dinner menu.

I loved this recipe!  As some others recommended, I added ground Italian Sausage to the sauce and we poured it over the tortellini.  My family devoured it,.... I didn't even have any leftovers.

Absolutely delicious just the way the recipe reads. We've made this several times, one of the few ways my wife will eat cooked spinach. My sister came and visited us and we got her hooked as well. It's a very rich dish and one we consider our "indulgence" every few months. Bravo and thank you for the recipe

This was a great recipe. Instead of using tortellini I used lobster raviolis and turned out great.

I really loved this menu!  I used refrigerated tortellini rather than frozen and I added Purdue cooked chicken strips to the dish to make it a full meal. It made a lot (way more than 6 servings)!  Everyone loved it and it tasted like restaurant quality.

Didn't have cream and was still wonderful, just used milk.  Had leftover noodles from a previous meal, so cut down on the prep time even more.

I made the recipe pretty much exactly as written and it was a very good dish!  I found this recipe while trying to break away from the traditional American-Italian meals (lasagna, spaghetti, chicken alfredo, chicken parmigiana) and was very pleased with how it tasted and looked.

I think the overall flavor has a lot to do with the kind of tomatoes you use. I chose fire roasted tomatoes with garlic. I also added browned pork sausage and chopped onion.  Definitely a family favorite.

This was so good! I had frozen spinach so I used that and doubled the amount, added a little extra of the seasonings (except the salt), added zucchini because I needed to get rid of it. This was great. I accidentally got the 9oz of the tortellini but it didn't even matter, this was perfect.

Delicious! I have made this two times now and the second time I added chicken to it because my fiancé likes to have meat in things. It was good both ways, with chicken and w/o chicken. Also instead of canned tomatoes, I chopped up fresh tomatoes. How many tomatoes you chop and add depends on size and preference. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Really delicious with cream, but it can also be made with regular milk and a few TBSPs butter instead. Chicken or sausage are also a nice addition to the sauce.

FANTASTIC RECIPE!!!! Total prep and cook time 40 mins and was an easy no-brainer. I did increase the cheese to 1 cup, doubled the garlic, used LOTS of fresh basil and added 3 mild Italian sausage browned without the casing. Definitely a must try!!! :)

I made this last night and this recipe is a keeper! I usually don't review recipes but this one deserves a review. I made some changes: I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and mixed them with sauteed onions and garlic. I also doubled the parmesan cheese. I usually season every part of the dish with salt to taste so it was not bland for us at all. I also added more garlic because we love garlic. Awesome recipe, making again this week, this time I will try adding some shrimp.

Delicious! Comes together quickly. I've made it multiples times as directed...only thing I do differently is add sautéed shrimp or I slice turkey kielbasa into medallions, brown them and add them to the pasta. Super easy recipe.

The dish when made by the recipe is a little bland.  It needs more basil, garlic, and some salt.  After those changes, it will be a winner.

It was good, but I like a little spice in my dishes. So, I added some crushed red pepper. I also added extra cheese!

Very good overall!

This was incredible!  We have a large family so I changed the serving size to 24 without changing anything.  I actually made it the night before, put in casserole pan in the fridge over night.  Heated in oven at 325 for 45 min uncovered, then topped with mozzarella cheese for 15 additional!  Will do this often!

I have made this recipe twice and both times the sauce was to thick (gloopy is the best word) and  not good. I doubt I will try it again, but if I did I would be very careful to add only a little of the flour mixture, not the full amount the recipe calls form..

If my boyfriend and I could give this recipe 10 stars we would. I did tweak the recipe just like everyone else; fried up mild Italian sausage (took it out of the casing and broke it up into chunks) and baby bella mushrooms. I did have a can of the diced tomatoes with basil and garlic and you couldn't tell it wasn't fresh. This is definitely a do-over and I'll tell my friends about it.

This was so delicious! My boyfriend absolutely hates spinach with a passion thinking he wouldn't like it at all I had a back up dinner planned for him and he actually loved it! Even after he noticed the spinach he continued to devour it. Authentic Italian cooking made in my home. Will definitely become a staple.

My family loved this.  Made as directed (did use Italian diced tomatoes instead of plain and still added the listed spices) with added hot Italian sausage.  Also offered some sautéed mushrooms on the side for those that like mushrooms.  It was super easy to put together and I will be making this one again.

This was delicious!!  Per other reviews, the only change I made was adding sauted onions and mushrooms, and adding about 6 cups of spinach. It cooks way down, and I love spinach!  Saute the mushrooms and onions first in a bit of oil, then add the ingredients in the order listed.

Outstanding!! had some extra tortellini and spinach and wanted something different. this was quick and easy. I used 2 cups frozen spinach and double the garlic plus fresh basil out of the garden. had to have some meat and just happened to have left over diced ham from pizza night. The ham added just the right amount of flavor with a little extra texture and color. I will definitely make again

Love this recipe.  So easy with minimal dishes.  I usually add in some browned italian sausage, ground beef, or chicken - whatever I have around.  I also use evaporated skim milk in place of the heavy cream so I feel better about myself when I eat half the dish.

This was good, authentic Italian. I went to Italy this year and this dish reminded me of the food  I ate there, not heavy or over done, just simple. I used all milk (I didn't have heavy cream and looked up substitutes ) and flour. I cut up 2 tomatoes and a medium onion and used fresh garlic .  Also, I used tri-colored refrigerated tortellini. Delish! Will make again.

This recipe was so delicious and so easy.  My grocer did not have tortellini so I used tortoloni.  Tortoloni is basically the same but little larger and more dumpling shaped.   I served it with a small steak pinwheel.  The  next time I make this recipe I will add more spinach.

This is an easy recipe if you are short on time but want something warm and filling. I sautéed 1.5 C of baby Bella mushrooms before starting the sauce. Everything came together quickly but was bland. I served it with fresh baked bread. This isn't going in my dinner rotation but I can see using it in a pinch.

Great dinner dish, my boys loved it, added extra spinach!!
Update: Doubled the recipe this time, sauteed the garlic and spices in a pound of extra lean ground beef.  Added that to the sauce and added a little more seasoning.

I followed the recipe as best as I could.  I couldn't find diced tomatoes with garlic and onion; so I bought diced tomatoes with garlic, then chopped 1 cup of onion and sauteed it in a bit of butter until transparent.  For some reason, I thought it had ginger in it, so I added minced fresh ginger.  It's not necessary, but if you like ginger it's a nice optional ingredient.  This is pure comfort food.  Yummy on a cold winter night!  This is excellent without meat; but if I had to have meat I would add a few shrimp.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

This dish was AMAZING! Some reviews stated it was a bit to runny for their liking, all you must do is add a little extra flour to thicken the sauce to your liking :-)

Wow, this is company worthy!  Add a salad and some bread... Perfect!  I used frozen spinach (thawed) and just a little more Parmesan - but less than 1/ 2 cup.  My family loves cheese but I definitely didn't think it needed more.  It probably would've been just as perfect with the 1/4 cup.  I am passing this recipe on to friends.  Thanks so much!

Loved this recipe! I switched out the tortellini and replaced it with grilled shrimp and penne pasta, which was just awesome. You could really add any kind of meat or pasta you want because the sauce is very flavorful. I also added more garlic and instead of dried basil, I added fresh. Enjoy :)

Really enjoyed this dish on a cooler fall evening. I'll add a few different spices next time, as it seemed a little bland, but easily improved.

I LOVE this recipe.  I made it as written the first time, fantastic.  Today, to cut some of the fat, I used evaporated milk in place of the cream.  STILL fantastic!  This is a keeper for me, easy and delicious.

My 15 year old vegetarian daughter loved this, and she is very picky!! I made it, as is. It was wonderful, even my husband who "needs" to have meat with a meal, liked this. It was so easy to make too.  This will be an easy weeknight meal.

Added three cups of spinach ... otherwise per the recipe posted.  Loved it.  Children ... (well, they have no taste.)  Great dish.  I will definitely make it again and continue to push it on the kids until they develop good taste.

I added a table spoon of fresh tarragon finely chopped and a sprig of fresh chopped rosemary and then a pinch of cayenne for a hint of bite. I also sautéed the onions, garlic, and chopped celery and then added the diced tomatoes.
It was a big hit.

I added 1 container of fresh sliced mushrooms to the spinach/tomatoe mixture. I cubed and cooked chicken in a separate pan in olive oil and added chicken to spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes then added the cream sauce.  I also used 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup of grated cheese.  Came out thick and delicious.

This was delicious though I did make some alterations.  Instead of canned tomatoes, I sauteed two garlic cloves and half an onion in olive oil until soft.  I then chopped fresh tomatoes equivalent to the canned amount.  I also added dried oregano. Overall I thought  this was a great recipe!

Tried this recipe for the first time tonight. Outstanding! I added chicken, by cooking two chicken breasts then chopping it up and adding it to the tomato pan. 
My husband and I like a lot of sauce so next time I would probably double the sauce, without doubling the pepper though.
Delicious!

I made this over the weekend and it was great. Followed the recipe exactly, except I forgot to add my spinach. I had it thawed in the microwave but didn't remember. I doubled the recipe and used fresh basil. This is a keeper!!!!

I was so pleased with this dish that I had to write a review to thank the author and chef of this creation. I made mine with leftover chicken, bacon, and ham. I fried 2 slices of thick bacon on a skillet and left the bacon and grease to continue to fry the onions and garlic (I used fresh onions, garlic and tomato, not canned because I didn't have any). Added half a hollowed out jalapeño to the tomato mixture for a little kick. I used fresh herbs (oregano, cilantro) with the tomato mixture as well as a topping when plated. I also added white cooking wine and cooking marsala, then added the cut-up ham right before the cream mixture was added. For the cream mixture, I used only 1 1/4c of whole milk and omitted the heavy cream altogether. Everything turned out flawless, amazing--packed with flavor and aroma that filled my home. My husband is picky about his pasta and he said it was good enough to be served at a fine restaurant. Thank you Lela, and your old boyfriend's mother who used to make this for you all the time.

This was excellent!  Loved the recipe, and you could probably add whatever meat you like (it's fine on its own).  I added sage sausage and a few spices, and it was perfect.

Used Hunts plain tomatoes and added more garlic and onion powder and fresh basil.Used Rana cheese ravioli (not frozen) and cooks in 3 minutes.I used a whole bag of baby spinach,rinse and drain well and per another review didn't add the spinach until just before the ravioli.Great recipe!
2nd time making and subbed 1/2n1/2 for milk and cream and served over fettuccini pasta. So good!

Pretty good.  It went very quickly at our house.  Only thing I changed was that I used sausage instead of shrimp.

Delicious and very easy to make. My husband loved it. I used kale instead of spinach and used half a can of the diced tomatoes and added a fresh medium tomato. I also used about 5 cloves of fresh garlic and added sliced mushrooms for more veggies. I added fresh basil at the end and more cheese (1cup)  because who doesn't like more cheese?! It tasted and looked familiar to our favorite dish from Brio- pasta a la vodka. We are fans!

My teenage daughter and I loved this. I used half and half instead of cream and petite diced tomatoes, so added onion and garlic powder. It was delicious, simple, but flavorful. Great as a meal or side dish.

I prepared this dish tonight and it turned out GREAT.  I usually follow any recipe as is the first time then make a change the second time if I think it needs it.  The reason I changed this recipe is because I did not have canned diced tomatoes or heavy cream. So for direction #2    I quartered cherry tomatoes and added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth and all the other ingredients called for.   I cooked this a little longer until the tomatoes were soft. For direction #3  I used half and half.  Thank you for this recipe.  I  will be making it again.

I made this for my family and they really enjoyed it. I followed some of the suggestions in other  reviews and made a couple of modifications. I doubled the Parmesan cheese, add  sautéed shrimp, and added mushrooms.  I also  used baby spinach and doubled the amount indicated in the recipe. I added the spinach  later on because I didn't want it to be too soggy.   Lastly, I also deglaze the pan with white wine.

My first experiment with tortellini and this recipe is the best! Easy for a first timer but very tasty and wholesome. I am about to cook it for the second time and next time will experiment.

2 big mistakes by me here: not completely mixing the flour and milk and subbing in cornstarch and extra milk instead of cream. Rookie mistake, I should have known better. Make sure flour completely dissolves! And I should have gone full-fat with cream, or at least added tiny bits of cornstarch at a time while cooking. Done right, this could be a yummy dish. Oh, and I added sausage and subbed rigatoni. (Any pasta will do).

This was great and not to mention super easy to make! I only made minor changes.. I used a cup and a half of chopped spinach. Next time I'll use 2 cups for sure . I also added the additional seasonings of garlic salt & Italian season. Next time I'll add onions to the tomatoe mixture.. Chopped fresh mushrooms would taste good here too!

I made this recipe as written except I used half cheese tort & half sweet sausage tort. The sauce was excellent when prepared per the recipe, rich and creamy.  I'm looking forward to trying some variations to the sauce, adding meat or more spinach like some other reviewers have suggested.

I was in the store about to buy both milk and cream and thought, half and half, so that's what I bought.  And a reviewer said she added Italian sausage, and I had a half a pound in the freezer I needed to use up so I browned that and put it in too.  Also I had only seen one kind of frozen tortellini in my favorite store, but was disappointed in them, so I went to another store and got the tri-color cheese tortellini and they were excellent.

Everyone in my family liked this (even my daughter who does not like "sauce") and I liked how easy it was to make.  Also, it is a complete meal in one pot.  I added a sliced up zuccini to the sauce + a lot more spinach.  Didn't have any cream, so used all 2% milk and it was fine.  I used a 28 oz can diced tomatoes and 22oz bag of ravioli and it was great.

This was delicious and amazingly fast to make.  I was shocked that I was done as quickly as I was.  great meal for the workweek; left plenty for dinner and lunch the next day.  This was my first time trying a cream sauce and I was pleasantly surprised at the ease.  Definitely recommend trying this one!

Yummy comfort food! Used all cashew milk in place of dairy, little bit extra flour. Added some peas & mushrooms, and used tomato basil jar sauce and added fresh diced tomatoes in place of canned tomatoes. Used both cheese tortellini and butternut squash ravioli. 
Served with warm crusty baguette. Not an in your face flavor profile, just yummy!

Instead of canned chopped tomatoes with onion and garlic I used plain chopped tomatoes and added my own fresh onion and garlic, used fresh basil also. I also added a tblsp of tomatoe paste.   It was delish!  I was sceptical about the flour into the milk mixture but it worked perfectly. I will now use the flour and cream technique in other dishes.

This was so good. My boyfriend absolutely refuses to eat store bought tomato sauces so this was a welcomed addition. When I initially dumped the can of diced tomato, it didn't look like enough so I added a half can of Rotel, it added a nice little kick. Will totally be adding this to my rotation of recipes.

I made this for a group of friends and it was a HUGE hit!  I used cornstarch instead of flour to make the sauce gluten free and then made two separate bowls of pasta--one with the cheese tortellini as suggested in the recipe, and one with Barilla gluten free Rotini for my GF friends.   I added a LOT more spinach and some fresh garden tomatoes.  Everyone raved!  I'll make it again for sure!!

This was delicious!  The sauce was a little heavy, so next time I'd lighten it up a little & do more milk & less cream.  I added fresh garlic, onions & tomatoes instead of canned.  I also added feta cheese. My kids gobbled it up!

I made this last night for my fiance. We were blown away by how great it turned out. I followed the recipe exactly, and cooked up some ground pork sausage to add at the end. We'll definitely be making this again soon. Next time though I want to add some mushrooms and maybe stew up some fresh tomatoes instead of using the canned, and I think it would be phenomenal with some sort of slow cooked beef!

I used fresh garlic (2 cloves, minced) and fresh basil from my herb garden and this was delicious!! To lighten it up a bit (just personal preference) I skipped the heavy cream and used all Almond Milk and oh yes, this is a definite keeper!

Was super easy and quick! Found it slightly bland so some added some extra salt.  It also made a lot of sauce..... Extra tortellini would be helpful or slightly less cream and milk.   I'll definitely make this again!

This was a fantastic recipe full of flavor.  I added a few diced fresh cherry tomatoes and will try with half and half next time to lower the fat.  It is also delicious the next day. This one is definitely going into permanent rotation at my house!

My family loved the cream-based spinach sauce (I used to make it with cream cheese). I did use frozen spinach and added ground sausage. Rave reviews!

Oh, this was AWESOME!!  Used what I had but stuck to the recipe.  Couldn't find diced toms with garlic AND onion so just chopped up some chunks of onion (about 1/4 of a cup).  Used 19 oz. bag of frozen tortellini, one large pod of FRESH garlic crushed, and used 2% milk instead of the heavy cream!!!  And used one 6 oz. container of fresh baby spinach!!  If I had just had some garlic toast it would have been perfect!  Thank you Lela!  What a great, new, quick pasta recipe!! recipe!

This is a fast and easy meal!  I usually use fresh onions (1 medium sweet) , garlic (2 cloves), & tomatoes (4-5 medium, ripe) instead of canned.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe. Always a big hit with my boys.

This was excellent!  I subbed cheese ravioli since it was on sale, and used 1 C. Heavy cream with 1/2 C. Milk for a creamier sauce, also used fresh basil from the garden and doubled the garlic per others' reviews.  I think it could use more spinach, but otherwise was very happy with the small amount of time it took to create a delicious, filling, and meatless meal.

We all liked this.  I added some cooked shrimp at the end.  I used skim milk and cornstarch, but as expected, it did not thicken up as much as intended.  Nothing a little garlic bread soaker-upper couldn't fix, but next time I will either use FF half and half, or just use less than 1.5 cups milk

I added oregano, because when I kept tasting the "sauce" mixture I found it to be flat, though it was still quite bland. Very easy, and a lovely concept, though it seems to desperately be missing something.

Loved it! I had skim milk and fresh basil on hand, but they were the only substitutions I made. I did cook and dice some shrimp, and added a little extra spinach. While cooking I realized mushrooms would be a perfect addition. I will make this often, with multiple proteins! It is a great base, and could be a complete meal if necessary, but it sounds like any meat would be delicious in this recipe!

This recipe has easily become a family favorite it's so good. The recipe is really easy and quick to make. I followed the directions except I added more spinach than what it calls for and I added some freshly chopped mushrooms, and it came out perfectly. By far one of my favorites.

I'm not much of a cook, but I made this for my roommate & boyfriend & they both enjoyed it!! & it was super easy! I used frozen tortellini & it worked fine. I also added more Parmesan because I LOVE cheese & a little more spinach. I also added the diced chicken that another user suggested. Overall delicious!

SOOOO good! I was a little leery of using canned tomatoes, so I roasted And crushed my own. I also omitted the milk in place of more cream, and added 3tbs of butter. I'm definitely going to make this again :D

This is my second making of this dish. Absolutely love it. Added more spinach the second time and that's been the only change. Fiancé can't get enough, I can't get enough ... delicious.

I couldn't really give this 5 stars only because I deviated from the recipe quite a bit.. but the end result was delcious. I omitted the spinach because hubs doesn't like anything green (hahaha) I added some chunks of cooked chicken breast and added ricotta cheese... this was a last min decision as I had some in the fridge that needed used. Here's how I did it... i cut and cooked my chicken breasts with Fresh chopped onion, and garlic, salt/pepper. I drained the bit of juice the chicken made then added the tomatoes and garlic ect. I simmered the tomato mixture and added the ricotta cheese at the last minute. I only added a couple tbsp of cream because truly the ricotta worked well to thicken it up on its own.  After that I drained the tortellini and coated in the sauce. It was great! If you like spinach I'd add that too because I think that would send it over the top but it was still great.

Just made this tonight and I really enjoyed it.  I did make some changes to make it a bit more healthy, though.  I added boneless chicken breast, mushrooms, used 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk to replace the whole milk and heavy cream (1 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken) and deglazed the pan with Marsala wine for additional flavor. Very good.

This was absolutely the best, I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose because I didn't have any on hand, but that didn't make a difference. It was great!

I made this recipe tonight for my mom and I and it is AMAZING! The sauce smells like something you'd get at an expensive Italian restaurant. I used tri-color tortellini in ours and it only took maybe ten minutes. Only five to cook the tortellini and maybe another five at most for the sauce. The only thing I did different from the recipe is turn up the heat before allowing it to simmer. I turned it up until it boiled and then turned it back down. Anyways! This is super good and I can't wait to fix this for my husband when he gets home from work.

This was SO good! I've made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe, but with lower-fat options (skim milk, etc). The second time I got creative! I swapped fresh tomatoes for the canned, diced Brussels Sprouts for the spinach, added a teensy bit of pesto to the sauce, then I threw it all in a baking dish, topped with mozzarella and baked it till brown. It. Was. Amazing. I added a picture of the baked version :) This will now be a staple at my house!!

I love this recipe and so does my family. I add sun dried tomatoes and bell peppers to it. And nothing beats a little fresh basil to enhance the flavor. Love it each time! Enjoy

The original recipe was good. But I added mushrooms as well as spicy Italian sausage and a little bit of extra flour to thicken it up. This was a complete success! One of the best meals I've ever cooked and fairly simple! Spicy Italian sausage definitely gave it that extra flavor. YUM!

I was looking to change it up a little bit for dinner and this did the trick! It was very filling. I used meat tortellini to get some protein out of the meal and used more than double the amount of spinach the recipe called for. While it was good, it was also bland. Some cayenne pepper and a little more salt did the trick. Served it with heated up Italian bread for dipping in the extra sauce I made. Will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly (except for adding some mozzerella to the sauce and a bit more spinach) and it turned out amazing! So good and creamy. I'm a beginner and this took no time at all. Great recipe I can't wait to make again and again! :)

My family loves this meal and it is so easy to make.  It reminds me of something we would get at a Italian restaurant and pay lots to eat.  I do dice and add chicken.  It makes it even more delicious.

This recipe is not only super duper easy but it's absolutely delicious. I crumbled up some sweet Italian chicken sausage and more than doubled the spinach, but those were the only changes. It was a big hit with the family. We all ate until we hurt ourselves and then the mister squirreled some away for lunch later in the week. I have a feeling I'll be making this one many times to come.

I really like this recipe, but after making it the first time, I did change it slightly. I like to add at least three chicken, spinach and garlic sausage links, double the spinach (to two cups) and add another can of petite diced tomatoes that I drained. I find that frozen spinach works just fine-- I just thaw it in the microwave and use paper towels to take out the extra moisture.

Used mild rotel and frozen spinach cooked to thaw. Substituted 1 cup half and half and 1/2 cup milk. If you like a little heat give it a try. Best dish I've made in awhile.

Made this for dinner tonight. Was wonderful. Husband finished everything. Served with a side of french bread. Made a few changes as others have done. Used 2 cups Spinach and doubled the amount of garlic and cheese. Added mushrooms as well. Used just plain diced tomatoes as I didn't have any other. Tasted just like what we have ordered at Italian restaurants. Will be making again.

This is just great and has become a bi-weekly meal in our home. I have made this with the tortellini and it's delicious but I once made it with five cheese ravioli and it's even better! I only use ravioli now. I also omit the heavy cream. I've actually never used it since I started making this recipe and I really like it so I'm just the heavy cream just adds more delicious calories. But hey, can't miss what you've never had right? This is a must make recipe!

My husband did notice the lack of meat at dinner, but it didn't seem to hinder his enjoyment of this meal. I doubled the spinach, and that didn't seem to bother him either. Double score! Used 1 1/2 cups whole milk instead of milk/cream combo. Although the recipe has tomatoes from a can, the sauce tasted very fresh. 5 stars for sure.

This recipe gets 5 stars for taste as well as ease. The only deviation that I made from what was given here was that I used plain fire roasted organic tomatoes and simply added more minced garlic and some powdered onion. This recipe is very simple and was a hit among my picky eaters! Try this, you wont be disappointed!

Delicious. I used 1.5 c. milk and left out the heavy cream and it still tasted great. I also added crushed red pepper flakes which gave it an excellent kick. You could definitely use the sauce with any kind of pasta and it would be great if you don't have tortellini on hand.

This is awesome! I hate to change a recipe the first time I make it, but I had to work with what I had on hand. I'm sick and needed something quick and easy to make for the kids for dinner, something that didn't need any kind of meat, and this was perfect! I didn't have spinach or parmesan, and only regular plain diced tomatoes. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I put some dried minced onion and some refrigerated fresh minced garlic in the sauce to make up for the tomatoes. Instead of parmesan, I put shredded mozzarella in the sauce. I served it with another sprinkle of different shredded cheeses I had in the fridge. It looked beautiful and tasted restaurant worthy! It was very creamy with a gorgeous color, and since I only had an 8oz bag of tortellini there was plenty of sauce. The sauce had the perfect thickness. This looked and tasted like something I slaved over all day, yet it was all done in about 20 minutes, start to finish. The kids gobbled it up, and they are picky. I will make this again, but this time I'm going to follow the recipe to a T, I'm sure it will be delicious with spinach.

I've made this several times now with slight variations.  Once I used evaporated milk and 1%.  Didn't like it.  I've also used whip cream and 1%. Delish but very rich.  Next time I'll use lighter cream and see how that goes.

Update: have made many times now but the best was last night. Fried onions &garlic, added sliced farmer sausage and fried, added 2c chopped snow peas and fried, added spinach and wilted. Now added tomatoes, 1% milk, coffee cream, fresh pepper, basil (lots) and oregano. Melted parmesan into sauce.

Just made this recipe tonight and it is Fantastic!!  I used a spinach and ricotta tortellini, browned up some Italian sausage for the meat lovers in the family (none for me thanks)and followed the recipe (except for the sausage, which was added on top, not mixed in with the rest of the dish).  This is something that I would order in a restaurant, it was so good.  I will be making this again.

Followed it pretty closely, and the results were very good.  Had to add just a pinch more flour to thicken it up, but that may be more about how much liquid was not reduced on the tomatoes.  Added sweet italian sausage links (sliced), black olives and a little bit of diced onion just to jazz it up.

I made this recipe many times and it always comes out wonderfully! This recipe is thick and filling, it is a great recipe that will keep you fed for hours after you have eaten it. I've gotten great reviews from my husband and the rest of the family on this recipe.

I have made this like 5 times already & it's a hit!! Super rich and creamy. Only thing I changed was by adding chicken and omitting the parmesan cheese. Just so anyone who really doesn't like too much of a cheese flavor could their own amount. But over all one of the best recipes I've ever decided to make.

Added some onion powder and a bit of cayenne pepper for some kick, but I fancy spicy foods. Definitely on my list to make again!

Made this recently and really liked it.  Didn't have diced tomatoes with garlic and onion so just sautéed some onion and garlic before adding the tomatoes.  Next time I may use less milk/cream mixture and will use fresh basil, but it was great and saved well too.  A very elegant looking dish.

Pretty good for a quick weekday meal. My diced tomatoes didn't have the garlic and onion, so I sautéed them in olive oil before adding the tomatoes. Next time I'll try it with the right tomatoes to see if I can save a step. I used regular milk and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken. The kids liked it and it was an easy way to sneak in some veggies.

Great recipe, easy to make and tasty. Think about adding olive oil or butter, otherwise is a little dry. Preferentially the first step, and then add the tomatoes and stir fry for a couple of minutes.

This was delish. I used a can of petite cut tomatoes, fresh basil, and also baked I baked one large boneless skinless chicken breast rubbed with salt, pepper and cayenne then added pieces of that to the pasta. Spiced it up a bit. I would say, make more sauce though if you're adding additional things to this dish. Otherwise, I followed this exactly and was very happy with the results.

Yum... I made this for a big pasta potluck dinner at the high school.  I accidentally got the wrong type of tomatoes, I ended up using stewed with the seasonings versus the diced.  It was quite good.  I tripled the recipe and ended up having so much sauce that I used a fourth bag of tortellini and kept a bowl at home in the fridge.

Didn't use heavy cream and used frozen spinach. Great taste; think next time I'll add some italian sausage.  Served this with Pioneer Woman's "The Bread" recipe (highly recommended)

I've made this exactly as directed, and I've made it with alterations (fresh tomatoes, fresh garlic, etc.). It's fabulous either way, so feel free to put your own twist on it. I will say that I use probably 3-4 times the amount of spinach it calls for. My whole family enjoys this recipe, and I feel like we're having a special treat without much work.

I'm rating it high even though I basically combined this and Creamy Spinach Tortellini by Jennifer Van77. I originally read her recipe so had it in my mind to use cream cheese and mushrooms, which I added to this recipe. I used only 8 oz. tortellini since not many were home to eat it, and 1/2 package of frozen spinach. I also added 1 tsp. salt, more garlic, minced onion, and more freshly grated Parmesan. I'm sorry for not rating the recipe as written, but anyway, this was delicious!

Thought it was great. The tomato and spinach sauce really makes it in my opinion. I used frozen spinach and fat free milk because that's all I had  and it still came out well.

Really good! I used more tortellini than the recipe called for. I also used 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes & Half & Half instead of milk & heavy cream. I used a whole bag of baby spinach because my family are spinach lovers & because it cooks down so much. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I love love LOVE this recipe!!!! It was a great starting point and the sauce comes out perfect. My husband is a major carnivore so I added hot Italian sausage, red bell peppers and onions but other than added a few extras I do everything to the T. I have to say AGAIN that I love this!!!!!!

This was soo good, it's a keeper!  I did add more garlic, 3 cloves, a bit more basil and used straight 2% milk.  You need to add the parmesan cheese, the good stuff!  I wouldn't change a think in this recipe, great as is.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked it, although a bit more spice - maybe a small bit of red chili flakes - would help.  The tomatoes are a bit large and "canned" tasting, so I will next use petite-cut tomatoes or crushed tomatoes or use fresh.

I've just put the sauce together and wanted to say how good it is so far. My can of tomatoes had garlic and basil in it, so I didn't add extra basil, but did add some sauteed onions and mushrooms and left it simmer for quite a while to reduce the liquid before introducing the flour/milk mixture (fat free half and half was used instead of heavy cream). A whole bag of spinach was used which looks like a good amount and I did add a couple wedges of Laughing Cow cream cheese for more cheesy flavor. Oh, and the pink color didn't bother me one bit! Thanks for the recipe - we'll definitely do this again.

This recipe was delicious and super easy! I added a pound of spicy italian sausage and 3 shallots but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did add extra parm cheese in the end but that is simply a matter of preference. Again, delicious - quick and easy! Thank you!

Great recipe. I used Kale instead of spinach. I like to serve this with a Zuppa Tuscano soup that uses Kale. It compliments this meal very well.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it was just ok.  The sauce was pretty boring.  My kids and husband agree.

This was absolutely fabulous.  Made as directed except for using frozen spinach that I steamed beforehand.  My exceptionally picky eater gave it a thumbs up.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I used my immersion blender on the tomatoes because my picky husband doesn't like chunks. Also used all heavy cream and no flour, I reduced it a bit. Fresh grated romano, asiago, and reggiano. Loved it and will add more spinach next time. Thank you!

Our family enjoyed this soup tremendously.  I purchased the frozen (store brand) cheese tortellinis.  I added to the recipe a pound of sweet italian loose sausage and one chopped onion.  Sauteed both until browned and drained off fat.  I then added a quart of canned tomatoes I canned myself instead of amount of diced tomatoes indicated in the recipe, and 2/3 of a bag of refrigerated spinach located with other salad kits.  I used a cup a heavy cream and 1/2 cup of 2% milk.  That was because I did not want to waste what was left in the heavy cream container.  It turned out wonderful.  I am anxious to make this again and have it in the fridge to eat during the week :)

This came out delicious! My husband and guests loved it so much they gave me a round of applause! The only changes I made were I used ravioli instead of tortilini and I added sweet Italian sausage. Can't wait to make it again. Soooooo good. Thank you so much!

Used 1.25 c. milk and .25 c. cream. Think you could do without the cream all together. Only had regular diced tomatoes so added half a chopped onion and a dollop of minced garlic. Made with frozen ravioli - very good!

A delicious, cheap, and simple meal. It was a huge hit with my roomies! I made some changes to use up what I had at home. I sauteed half a diced onion and a few more cloves of garlic to add to the sauce. I also used jarred pasta sauce, a pint of half and half, and a 10oz box of frozen chopped spinach defrosted and water squeezed out. The leftovers also reheat beautifully in the microwave for lunch. This is a keeper -- it really did taste like something you would order at an Italian restaurant!

I agree with many of the other reviews that you should double the amount of spinach.  I would also add another can of the diced tomatoes but I would drain the second can.  Otherwise this was very easy to make and had a lot of flavor.

Turned out great, my family loved it. I agree with whoever said the color was a little unappetizing, it was kind of pink, but it tasted really good. I sauteed some sliced mushrooms and sweet peppers in olive oil before adding the tomatoes, etc. Also I didn't have cream so I just used 1 cup of skim milk with the four. Maybe a little thinner without the cream, but it was really good.

This was good. I don't think it really needs the flour. The cream thickens the sauce enough.  I also steamed the spinach above the pot of sauce and tossed it in at the end because I like it wilted better than very cooked down and I added more than what the recipe calls for. I wound up adding more because it just didn't look like enough.  I topped it with fresh basil and chicken sautéed with garlic and Italian seasonings for my husband.

I actually give this recipe about a 4.5 just because hubby thought the sauce could've been a little thicker...lol, but that could've been my fault because I added a lot more spinach which created more water. In any event we will definitely cook this again!! Thank you :-)

Very good- didn't have heavy cream so I used 3/4 cup 2  percent milk and 3/4 cup half and half.

great sauce!  i used dried tortellini but I think next time I'll use the kind in the refrigerated section as those were partially stale.  The recipe is a winner though.

I made this for dinner tonight exactly as the recipe specified. It was delicious, very filling and easy to make. Also, it only cost around $10 for the entire dish (and around $1.66 per serving). I will not need to modify this dish and will add it to our regular rotation. I love cheese tortellini, but the tomatoes and creamy sauce really made this dish something special. I will use this recipe for my next big family dinner.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because the sauce was a little bland.  It needs another spice, but I can't think of which one(s). The next time that I make this dish, I am going to add Italian sausage, it definitely needs some type of meat :)

Wow! This was delicious! I think it was even better the next day too. I doubled the recipe since I am feeding 6 people it was still super easy. I didn't add all the garlic the recipe called for and it was maybe about 1/2.  But that's only because that's how I like it!

Delicious, fast and easy! Very similar to vodka penne found on this site.  I followed the recipe except I did not add milk and substituted cornstarch for the flour. I would make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this twice, and both times it was delicious. My boyfriend is a chef, and he asks for this dish regularly! We add mild italian sausage to it to give it some "oomph" and it definitely gives it some! If you are looking for a quick, easy, delicious dish then this is it!!!

My husband loves this dish!  It's a great base to build off of.  When I first made it without any changes I thought it was a bit bland, however, after I added - fresh garlic, onion, italian sausage & more spinach - I thought it was great.  I also got rid of the cream and just used FF milk with cornstarch.  This recipe is so easy!  Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner!  Thanks!

This recipe was Great.. I am going to make it again and the only changes I made was that I did not have the Tomatoes with onions so I sauteed some onions to go in it and I also added sauteed shrimp.. My husband thinks that there should be Meat with every meal so Shrimp seemed perfect.. It was great :)

This recipe was delicious. I did alter it because I had fresh tomatoes from a farm. I used a little olive oil in the saucepan, fresh tomatoes and chopped them in the food processor with fresh garlic and onion..in replacement of canned diced tomatoes. It came out so fresh tasting!

loved this - always wanted to find a recipe for a sauce like this.  Couldn't find diced tomatoes with garlic and onion, so just used roasted canned diced tomatoes and added onion and garlic. found a similar recipe later on this site but doesn't have the parmesan cheese, but also adds sugar.  Will have to try.

Very rich and tasty.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, and enjoyed it.  The second time, my husband requested some chicken, so I added that, more spinach (just to use the whole bag), and some mushrooms that I wanted to get rid of before the spoiled.

I was really looking forward to this since it got so many great reviews but I was pretty disappointed. It looked wonderful, it smelled wonderful, but it had absolutely NO FLAVOUR! Very, very bland. I did follow the recipe closely, the only changes I made were adding more basil and salt to try to bring it around (didn't help). I am not sure what to add to it to improve it, but I still have 5 servings left I had planned on freezing.

This was delicious!  I would wait to start the tortellini until the other mixture is cooking though, because mine was finished cooking well before the sauce was bubbling.  It may depend on your tortellini, though (mine had a 5 minute cook time).

I made this recipe as is with only the addition of ground beef and extra spinach, a significant amount of extra spinach actually. I found this to be pretty good however next time I think I will add a little more seasoning.

This recipe was amazing, my 3 young girls LOVED it and so did I. I will be making this recipe again, maybe even adding some grilled chicken to it too. But it was a nice change for a veggie dish. I LOVED it and so did my very picky husband that doesn't care for spinach and cooked tomatoes much...I will make this THIS WEEK AGAIN!!!!!!

When i first tried it I was disappointed, but loved it the following day once the flavors had a chance to blend/set. I added some frozen California mix veg and more garlic. I only had low fat cream so I added a couple spoon fulls of sour cream.

I wanted a pasta dish and so tried this one.  We LOVED it!  My husband and I thought as an option, you could add chicken to it but I really enjoyed it just the way it was.  I did add more spinach and didn't have diced tomatoes with onions and didn't add onions but was still delicious.  Next time, I'll add onions but they aren't necessary.

This recipe is phenominal however i do have some picky eaters in this household, so like many others i've made some changes. penne instead of tortellini. doubled flour instead of heavy cream. added corn starch. added chicken( first cut up chicken breast into long strips than sauteed in onion, salt pepper, lemon juice, rosemary and a tiny bit of cayanne pepper) added shrimp( sauteed for 2 min on each side in miced garlic. salt pepper. ) added all together once all recipe parts were done . O  M G  DELICIOUS. my mom who's a cook by profession was beyond impressed . Props to this recipe's original owner and the person who shared with us . Keep them coming ladies and gents.

I enjoyed this recipe but is was not a big hit with 2 other folks.  It seemed to lack more flavor in the seasonings.  Either adding seasoning as you plate the dish or add more seasoning to the pan.

This was pretty good. I liked the flavors, but it could have used something more...can't decide what. Maybe more garlic? I thought at first it was going to be too strong, but then you add so much milk and cream and it drowned it out a bit. If I make it again, I might decrease the amount of milk/cream-it was just a bit too creamy for us (not so good on the stomach). But again, the flavors were great.

I made this recipe twice this week - once as a practice run and the second time for my bookclub.  The type of pasta makes a difference - it was much better the first time when I used the tortillini out of a box.  The second time, boxed pasta was not available, so I used the frozen kind.  Much tastier the first time.  I too doubled the parmesean cheese and used fresh basil - because that is what I had on hand. There are a number of vegetarians in my bookclub so this made a perfect dish for a cold and rainy night.  Served with a salad, bread and offered a few Italian Sausages on the side.  If I made it again, I would add a few more spices - and definitely only use the boxed pasta (not sure how the fresh packaged pasta would be - maybe even better - but it wasn't available around here). Otherwise, very good.  Will make again.

This was a great recipe.  I couldn't find the diced tomatoes with the garlic and onion so I bought the plain one and sauteed an onion in a bit of olive oil before adding the tomatoes and spinach.  I only had frozen spinach so I used a 10oz package that I defrosted and squeezed out the excess moisture.  Instead of the milk and heavy cream, I used 1.5 cups of half and half.  I also omitted the flour and used a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce. And, I didn't have tortellini so I used this over bow ties and it was wonderful.

My husband and kids really likes this recipe and it was extremely easy and fast to make which is a big plus when I don't feel like doing a huge dinner.  I personally felt it was rather bland but really, what's not to like about a cream sauce?  It tasted fine, just not interesting in my opinion.  Next time I make it I will use fresh basil and onion and more tomatoes and see if that helps. It might also taste good with some artichokes. It is a good base recipe but it lacks depth.

Great recipe - very easy and quick to make. It was also pretty tasty. I did rate as 4 stars because I did feel it was missing something. As much as tortellini is pasta - it doesn't seem to fill me up the same way. Next time I'll definitely add shrimp, scallops, or something similar. Thank you for the recipe!

This was good. I'd make it again. Some of the changes I made were to saute some onion and garlic in olive oil before adding the can of tomatoes. To this I added a 1/2 cup of wine, which I will likely omit next time. To this I added a full 5oz container of fresh spinach. Next time I will probably cook the spinach seperately and I will likely just use the heavy cream and no milk. Not sure why the receipe has you use both because we would have liked the sauce to be thicker.

This was a little too salty for me, probably the brand of tortellini or cheese I used, but I would cut the salt in half next time. Thanks for sharing!

I make this all the time and always receive rave reviews! I saute crimini mushrooms, garlic, and onions, then saute some boneless chicken breasts (the men in my family insist on meat!). I also use FF 1/2 n 1/2, instead of cream and milk. I add 1/4 cup freshly shredded parm when I add the tomatoes (i use the garlic, onion, and oregano version). I also double the spinach (love the stuff!), saute it in garlic and add it just before serving. HMMM!!

I used 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  This was a great base recipe.  My husband said it wasn't a complete meal since there was no meat, but this could be easily added.  Next time I will add more spinach and I think mushrooms would be a great addition.

I made this recipe for my family and they LOVED IT! I made a few changes as I went along- I like to experiment. I doubled the recipe due to my large family, then added 1.5 times the spinach, tripled the garlic and the parmasan, and added diced oven-roasted chicken breasts that had been seasoned with basil and garlic. I'll probably add more spinach again next time. My family said it was better than anything they'd ever eaten at Olive Garden! Definately be making this one again soon!

Delicious! I only made a couple adjustments: I used plain diced can tomatoes and added fresh chopped yellow onion and fresh sliced mushrooms. I did use more than a cup of spinach and added 2 browned boneless skinless chicken breasts- definitely will be making again, it was a big hit in my house!

This is just ok. Maybe if it marinated overnight it would taste better. The tortellini just didn't have much flavor. The sauce itself was pretty good though.

Terrific!  In lieu of tomato sauce and spices, I used 2/3 jar of spaghetti sauce - what I had on hand, and was a handy shortcut!  The sauce was so delicious.  I could see using this sauce with other variations vs. spinach - chicken, sausage, shrimp.  Yum!  And you can soak up the remaining sauce with a nice piece of french bread or garlic bread and have very, very happy plates!

This recipe is fantastic as is. Plus it's super quick. I made my own revisions (add real onion, garlic, and mushrooms, double the sauce) and blogged about it here: http://thefoodcharlatan.wordpress.com/2012/06/11/spinach-mushroom-tortellini/

Absolutely fantastic. I made it with italian tomatoes and had to use frozen spinach, which I heated up in the microwave before adding to the sauce. My whole family loved it, even my 1 yr old daughter and super picky 7 yr old son!

This is always a go to recipe for me. I usually have a can of tomatoes on hand, frozen spinach (works just as well) and follow the rest as best I can. I have used just fat free half and half for the milk and cream part, as I mentioned frozen spinach, and tonight I even added a couple of diced can artichoke hearts. My fiancé are always happy to still have leftovers! Easy and ingredients most people have off hand!

This was good but it could have been great!  It's a little on the bland side.  Next time we'll add more garlic and basil and maybe a splash of dry white wine!  We also added crimini mushrooms.  We will definitely make it again because it's easy.

So I made this the exact way that I read. The only reason I didn't gave it the entire 5 star is because my kids 5 and 3 had a bit of difficulties eating it. I also added some shrimp to the meal. I could have eaten the entire thing...not sure if hubby will like it or not!!!

This was very simple to make and oh so yummy.  I used 1% milk instead of the cream and it still thickened up.  Definitely add more spinach - I will probably double the spinach next time.

I just made this dish for the first time, and I love it! I didn't change much, except that my fresh spinach was from a bag.. and that my basil was actually an herb combo, with basil in it.  And I bought 2 13oz bags of tortellini, which was not too much! Either way, delish!! Go on, try it!

5 stars with a few changes; probably only 4 as written.  I had to add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce as it was somewhat runny - cornstarch solved the problem.  I added some extra garlic, and torn fresh basil at the end.  I substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream to make it a little healthier.  My dinner guests were impressed and I definitely plan to make this again!

This recipe was a great jumping off point for a quick dinner.  I sauteed garlic and onion and then added frozen spinach and a jar of alfredo sauce until heated through.  I stirred in fresh chopped tomatoes just before adding the totellini.  Nice fresh flavors and super easy with the pantry items I had on hand.

The first time I followed the recipe to a T. and it was okay but tasted like it was lacking something. The second time aroud I twiked it a little by using a can of diced tomato with garlic, onion and oregano (pureed in the blender). I even added 1/4 cup masala wine, 1/4 cup low fat evarporated milk, 1/4 cup heavy cream, crab meat and followed the rest of the recipe as written It was Soooo....... Yummy!

This was very delicious and easy to make. My entire family loved it. I have made this twice and it was better the second time, I used the basil,oregano, & garlic diced tomatoes & used a regular metal instead of nonstick saute pan which I believe made the difference.

A nice recipe that I will make again.But...it's lacking something.Olives?Mushrooms?Probably good to use as a base menu then experiment by adding other ingredients.Definitely worth trying and it's so easy.

This has become one of my "go-to" easy recipes.  So simple to prepare, and the leftovers are great.  Just for fun, I use tri-colored cheese tortellini.  I also use all half and half only (instead of the cream/milk)

The other thing I change:  more spinach!

This was so good that between my husband and myself there were no leftovers - oink! I made this despite the fact that I didn't have any spinach on hand. I used fresh tomatoes and tossed in some Kalamata olives for extra flavor. I made a roux and used half and half instead of milk and cream. I can't wait to make this again with spinach and some fresh basil.

This recipe was awesome.  It was simple, easy and delicious. I did not change any of the ingredients, however I did add shrimp to the mix just because I like shrimp with my pasta.  I rate this excellent.

I've been cooking for a very long time and enjoy finding new and different recipes. This is one of the best dishes I have ever made. It's quick and easy but tastes like I've been slaving in the kitchen. I used a can of plain tomatoes, doubled the garlic and cheese to suit our taste but I have no doubt that if you follow this recipe exactly it will be just as scrumptious. If I didn't know I cooked it myself I'd swear that a top Italian chef at the finest restaurant 
prepared this, it's THAT AMAZING! You HAVE to try this!!!

This is a great weeknight recipe!  Instead of using heavy cream and milk,  I used Cheesy Ragu Light Parmesan Alfredo Sauce. In the end I saved a few calories, but I think it took away from the taste.

Sauted garlic first, then followed the rest of the directions exactly.  I have also used Penne Pasta instead and added chicken or shrimp. So good.

So good!!  This recipe was so easy and yet it was restaurant quality food.  This will now be my go to meal for when we have company.  I did not have basil but added a little Italian seasoning.  It was great!

This was such and easy dish to make and very delicious!  I'm definitely going to make it again!  I actually used fresh tomatoes and reduced the amount since my husband is not a fan.  Still, it was great!  Served it with some garlic bread.

Yummy base recipe but I like many other reviewers changed it up a bit. Used a 25 oz bag of cheese ravioli, 3 mild sausages, 9 oz box of frozen chopped spinach & all milk. Really enjoyed & I'll be making it again. :)

Super easy to make, but tastes too processed for my liking. Maybe adding Italian sausage or bacon would help.

I made this last night with ONLY one change....I sauteed some shrimp (peeled, and deveined) with the garlic and onion before following the rest of the steps as stated. Served with garlic bread and a salad. Simple and quick meal. This is a keeper!

Can't stop eating!! I mixed a 9 oz package of cheese tortellini and a 9 oz package of spinach tortellini for more color. I also doubled the amount of spinach and used only 1/2 cup of cream. I might try to decrease that even further next time to make it a tad bit healthier! Other than the calorie count, it is fast to make and tastes awesome!!!

Easy, fast and delicious.  I did not mix the two sauces together, but rather mixed the tortellini and hot cheese sauce and then spooned the red sauce over the top.  It was beautiful and delicious.  Served it with crisp toast points and a fresh green salad and served with a great red wine!

This is a wonderful meal.  I added some sauted chicken pieces and it was great.  Very tasty.  My sons love tortellini so I am always looking for great recipes with tortellini.  Thinking about using shrimp for a family beach trip meal.

Couldn't find tomatoes with onions and garlic so I used the ones with basil, oregano and garlic and that worked just as well. Also added a bit more garlic and more spinach. Turned out really good!

i made unintentional changes due to what i had on hand, and wow, even though it sounded good before, it was great this way too. so flavorful. instead of canned or fresh tomatoes, i simmered sun dried with the other ingredients. when i added the cream/cheese mixture, i ended up with a sun dried tomato alfredo. soooo good. served topped with grilled chicken breast. yumm.

This recipe is a winner! I used 3 Roma tomatoes, 3 finely chopped garlic cloves and half a medium sized white onion.  Husband and toddler kept asking for more! Will definitely include it on the menu rotation. Thank you Lela!!!

Cooked this for the crew at the firehouse. Easy and very tasty. Needed to double everything in the recipe (2 lbs of tortellini, etc.) to feed six (recipe says 1 lb of tortellini will feed 6 - NO WAY!). I also used corn starch instead of flour (halve the corn starch amount if you are using it to substitute flour), and doubled the garlic.  Increased the parmesan cheese by 50%.  Went in my recipe box and will definitely make it again.

My family and myself loved it. I did get creative as others did, by adding fresh chopped tomatoes, garlic, more spinach and some shrimp that was sauteed in a bit of butter, spices and olive oil. All to our taste but the recipe was quite inspiring. Thanks Lela!

I loved it. So Easy. I followed the directions with the exception of using tow handfuls of spinch (I love spinach). Awesome dish. I would like to try this with pasta and shrimp... I bet it would be awesome. Give it a try.

This was pretty good. I did not have the tomato with garlic and onion so I sauteed some fresh minced garlic and chopped onion in EVOO ad then added a regular can of diced tomatoes. That and slightly less salt were my only changes. I often try new recipes when the hubby is gone for work and if I like it I'll make it again. I look forward to making this again and for him to try it. We are looking for more meatless recipes to enjoy.

I love it and we fix this regularly. But I dont use garlic, and I use plain tomatoes diced--sometimes I use it with added basil so I dont have to add that but there isnt much difference. This is a great recipe and goes well with a lot of things and its good for leftovers.

First time I made this I followed directions to a T but only had plain canned tomatoes so added a little xtra garlic and some minced onion.  I loved it.  This time, because of a huge crop of cherry tomatoes, I quartered enough of  them to resemble a can, added the xtra garlic and minced onion, and added a little olive oil to step 2.  Still good, but better the first time.  Needs a little more "juice" w/fresh tomatos.

Great, added butter, a little red onion and white wine to tomatoes, doubled the parmesan and topped with tomato basil feta cheese. It was fantastic- one of the best on allrecipes! :-)

this is a great tortellini dish! it is a bit heavy, but still worth the occasional splurge. The only reason I am giving this four stars is that I felt it was a bit bland.  Next time I'll add a bit more garlic and it will be a five star dish :)

I liked this sauce.  I used fresh tomatoes and garlic with some tomato/chicken bullion in lieu of the canned tomatoes since I didn't have any on hand.  I simmered the sauce a little longer.  The sauce was a little runny, but thickened up after cooling down a little.  I love the taste of fresh tomatoes and cream with this sauce though!

Delicious! My husband even liked it even though it didn't have meat in it. I added a little more cheese and spinach than called for, but other than that didn't change a thing. I will definitely be making this again.

ETA: This is really good with cooked salad shrimp, I just toss them in the sauce at the end to warm them up

This was delicious!  It tasted very much like something I recently had at Olive Garden.  The only changes I made were I used cheese ravioli and frozen spinach because I didn't notice it said fresh.  I threw the frozen spinach in with my pasta--yummmy- thank you!

This is really good just as written.  I added sliced boneless, skinless chicken breast that I sauteed in garlic and italian seasoning.  The first time I made this I used heavy cream, successive times half and half, and both are great.  I also stirred in about 3/4 cup of 2% Mozzarella cheese, and used an entire 10 oz. bag of spinach.  I've also added sauteed zucchini/squash, mushrooms & onions to up the nutritional value of this great dish.

This was very good.  I did change it just a little, but mostly to suit our taste more than anything.  I skipped the cream and used 1 1/2 cups of milk plus 1 tbsp of cornstarch to make it thicker.  Also, I added some italian turkey sausage since my husband requires meat for main dishes.  I also added about 4 cups of fresh spinach.  It really cooks down.  I will definitely be making this again.

Wow this was great-and so simple. I used more spinach, cheese, and tomatoes. I also added in more spices, garlic, and parsley to my taste. This recipe is great because you can easily adjust it to your liking. I used fresh angel hair pasta and also some pan fried chicken breast. I high recommend this to anyone who is looking for a surefire delicious, quick meal.

awesome recipe! replaced the tortellini with gnocchi, and cooked it with a few changes (saved about a third of the spinach to toss in afterwards -- adds a nice crispiness, threw in extra spices, and shredded fresh cheese on it at the end). turned out FANTASTIC. definitely a saucy pasta, but finger-licking good down to the last bite.

*****++++ DELICIOUS!!! I will make this often! I didn't change a thing about it! My husband isn't crazy about tomatoes but he loved it and went back for more! Said it's his favorite recipe I've gotten off the site so far.

Absolutely fantastic. I would highly recommend this to anyone. I substiuted light cream for the heavy cream. The taste of the sauce is phenominal.

I made this for my elderly mother for dinner and she enjoyed it.  I thought it was just so-so.  I used frozen chopped spinach, instead of fresh, and added a small can of sliced mushrooms.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of half-and-half, instead of adding plain milk to heavy cream (seemed like the same thing to me!)    Although this tasted pretty good, it wasn't exactly attractive -- guess I just wasn't expecting a "rosy" sauce.  Next time, I might try to drain a little of the juice from the can of diced tomatoes (although that's where the flavor is!)

So good.  I've only ever gotten positive feedback when I make this.  Sometimes I toss in a few shrimp seasoned with lemon pepper or italian herbs.

Delicious!!  Changes I made:  removed casing from italian sausage & browned.  Added to the tomato & spinach mixture.  Didn't have heavy cream, so I used milk & butter as a substitute.  Added 2-3 cups of fresh spinach.  My family loved it!  Next time I prepare this, I will use heavy cream to compare.

We all liked this rich, satisfying dish.  I used evaporated milk and sauteed onion and garlic with the spinach before adding the other ingredients.  Will make again.  Also, added diced kielbasa to the mix.  Wouldn't make it without some kind of meat added.

This dish came out decently, though I was a little underwhelmed by the taste. I followed the recipe as written, though I did add a little extra spinach and used fresh chopped onions (and garlic) since my canned tomatoes were of the plain variety. The final result looked and smelled fantastic, but I felt that the taste was a little bland. However, my boyfriend loved it and had second and THIRD helpings. I think if I add some more garlic, pepper, and some Italian seasoning next time, it could be a 5-star dish. Overall, this recipe is definitely worth trying, but you might need to play with spices if you like something with a bit more of a punch.

I've never actually made this recipe with the tortellini, but the sauce is EXCELLENT. Everyone goes wild for it! I've used frozen spinach rather than fresh, and I always use all milk in place of the heavy cream, and it still turns out great. Thanks for a great recipe!

YUMMY!  THIS WAS REALLY GOOD!!  I PUT MORE SPINACH AND GARLIC THAN CALLED FOR.  I WAS GOING TO PUT SOME LEFT OVER GRILLED CHICKEN IN TOO BUT MY HUBBY ATE IT BEFORE I MADE THIS RECIPE.  BOTH MY KIDS AND HUBBY LOVED THIS ONE.  IT WAS SO EASY AND I HAD EVERYTHING ON HAND.  I DID USE 2% MILK AND 1/2 AND 1/2 INSTEAD OF HEAVY CREAM.  NEXT TIME I WILL ADD ITALIAN SAUSAGE..THIS IS FOR SURE A KEEPER....GREAT FOR THOSE NIGHTS YOU ASK " WHAT AM I GOING TO MAKE FOR DINNER TONIGHT".***I MADE THIS WITH RAVIOLI LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS REALLY GOOD AS WELL**

We loved this recipe!  As for tweeking, I used the whole bag (2 lbs.) of tortellini from Schwan's, layered 1/2 in a casserole covered it with 1/2 the sauce and repeated the sequence then covered it with cheese and baked it for 30 minutes at 350.  Will definitely make this again.

Wow!  Quick, tasty, beautiful presentation, I will make this again soon.  The only thing I added was a dash or two of red pepper flakes for a little heat.  Next time I will add chicken to boost it up a little and add more garlic.  This recipe is a winner - which of course is why over 15,000 have saved it.

This was sooo good! I only made some small changes. Since some reviews said it could use more spinach, i used one full bunch, and took out the basil since i can't stand the stuff. I used a can of roasted tomatoes and garlic, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and sauteed some onions with the spinach and garlic before adding the canned tomatoes. Delish! Will definately make again.

I made this almost exactly as written (I added a bit more garlic and used milk and half&half instead of milk and cream), but this was disappointing because it was so bland. Neither my husband nor I thought the flavor was anything special when it was done, so I added a few shakes of cayenne to give it some pizazz and to cut the richness a bit, and that did make it somewhat better. I might try this again with the addition of some hot turkey Italian sausage to increase the flavor, but I would not make again as written. (EDITED 2/2011: Made this again tonight, only this time added the Italian sausage. Both my husband and I still think this is boring and bland, even with the addition of extra cheese and extra garlic. After trying this twice and not enjoying it either time I won't bother making this again, sorry.)

Great recipe! My husband and I loved it, this one will definitely be going in my recipe book. I made it just as the recipe stated, I only added more parmesan. It was flavorful and yummy! It tasted very similar to the gnocchi with the vodka cream sauce that Maggiano’s serves. It was also very quick to make. Thank you for the great recipe!

I made this the other night, and it was really delicious!  I love tortellini anyway, but this is a really yummy and elegant way to serve it.  The only thing I would change next time is I would put the tomatoes and spinach in the food processor just into chopped only because my 2 and 5 year old boys didn't care for the chunks of tomato and spinach in it.  If I didn't have young children though, I would leave it just the way it is.  Definitely going to be a keeper around here!  Thanks for sharing!

Good - but not great.   Used all half and half instead of the milk and cream.  Doubled the garlic. Drained the tomatoes.  Used a whole bag of baby spinach.   It tastes good, but a bit bland. Could maybe use some red pepper or something. I think a second can of tomatoes would "zip" it up some.

My husband made this the other day, followed the directions exactly. While he loved it, the rest of us didn't care for it much. But that's not the fault of the recipe, I just didn't like the sauce. He vowed to make it again and again though, so he definitely liked it.

I thought it was good but a little bland.  Next time I will add hot sausage or chicken to add a little more flavor.  I did add more spinach to the mix only because we love spinach! Also added more cheese sprinkled on top.

This is a delicious and easy meal to make.  I've added ground Italian sausage to the sauce and it has been good.  Chicken would also be a good protein to add.

Very easy and very good.  I had to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had--I was out of canned regular tomatoes so I used a can of rotel which did not state mild, medium or hot on it.. I guess I assumed it would be mild.  It was actually pretty spicy.  I still liked it as did my 12 year old stepdaughter but we both agreed next time to make sure and use regular diced tomatoes. Other than that, it's better than some restaurat variations.

YUMMY!!! I made this for dinner the other night & it was delicious :)The only changes I made was that I used cheese raviolli instead of tortalini's because that was what I had in the freezer & also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream again that was what I had on hand. Then I added 5 cloves of fresh garlic because I just love garlic!!! It was amazing!! This was a nice change from my usual ravioli's with pasta sauce. It was quick & easy too, I will definatley be making this one again! Thanks for the great recipe :)

My boyfriend and I loved this!!  Had to substitute a few things I didn't have. I used fat freek milk and added a little cornstarch in the pan to help the sauce thicken.  I always love extra garlic, and frozen spinach worked well since I forgot to buy fresh!  I also added chicken sauteed in a pan with some spices.  A great meal!

The hubby loved it. I put in three cups of spinach and cut down the pasta by about a quarter, used some Italian seasoning, more garlic, no salt, and double the amount of cheese. Fantastic recipe thank you!

My entire family LOVED this and decided it's a "do again"!  It was filling and nobody noticed we didn't have meat, which is incredible as we tend to have meat at dinner.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly; however, I used shredded Parmesan (not grated), as that was what I had.  Delicious!!  Thanks!

This was delicious.  Like others suggested, I added more garlic, mushrooms and a splash of white wine.  Used half and half instead of cream/milk.  Came out great!  My 16year old wanted sausage in it (maybe next time)but I figured a meatless meal wouldn't hurt anyone.  This will be great when the weather gets colder.  A real hearty meal.

Made one small change and added a bag of prewashed spinach.  I forgot to chop it but was fine.  This is a great recipe and will certainly use it as a base.  Sauteing some mushrooms for the sauce or adding peppers or otehr veggies.  Also try to use milk as I usually don't have cream in the fridge.  Only one kid didn't love it, but he is not a fan of tomato cream sauces, but he ate it as in this house its "eat what the cook makes or go hungry".

Really yummy.  I will make this again.  We added a little chicken but it would have been good without as well.  Very filling.  I used frozen spinach instead of fresh and more milk instead of heavy cream.  Turned out great.

Really quick to make and really yummy!  Only 1 change. Rather than using diced tomatoes with onion and garlic, I used plain diced tomatoes and added 3 small cloves of garlic, pressed.  My husband, 11 and 6 year olds loved it!

This was a very simple and easy dish to make.  It took me 20-25 minutes flat!  My husband said that the sauce was too runny, but that the taste was great.  Still have some sauce left over so I'm excited to see how it comes out tomorrow.

I am a meat lover so I thought this was lacking something because of the pasta being filled with just cheese.  Maybe I'll try this sauce with frozen beef ravioli.  The tomatoes in the sauce is what I really liked about it except I couldn't find the kind specified.  I used one can of plain diced tomatoes and one of Fire roasted with garlic. Nice simple recipe!

This dish is wonderful. With husband on deployment I like to test out new recipes. I know he will love this one. The kids thought it was great too. The only change I made was to add chicken breast seasoned to taste and cooked a little olive oil. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was excellent! The sauce was just perfect and easy to make. The entire dish took about a half hour. I know I will make this again, and again. I made it exactly as is and wouldn't change a thing. I love the previous reviewer's idea of adding some red pepper flakes, I'll try that next time.

This was good.  Certainly easy enough. I am not sure about the quality of the frozen tortellinis I bought.  Didn't really love them but that isn't at the fault of the recipe.  The sauce was good.  We all enjoyed it.

Quick and easy. Next time, heat milk and cream mixture in the microwave until hot to speed cooking time and add cheese just before serving.

I can't believe the good reviews given. To me it tasted like you might as well dump some Campbell's Cream of Tomato Soup over the tortellini. This definitely gets deleted from my recipe box!  Sorry!

this was excellent! i didnt give it 5stars simply because i modified it very slightly by leaving out the heavy cream and making my own bechamel(white)sauce using milk, butter and cornstarch. this was a quick and easy vegetarian meal for my family and will make very often.

I loved this recipe and so did my whole family. It's hard to please a family of 7 but this one did it!  I didn't have canned diced tomatoes though.  I used the tomatoes from my garden,I did add garlic and onion to them though to imitate the recipe. I will used the canned next time to see the difference in taste though.

Will definately try this again.  I used tomatoes with peppers unfortunately though and it was really, really spicy.  I will definately use regulary tomatoes next time.

Great recipe!  This is the first recipe I've made in a long time that was excellent as written without any tweaks.  The only change that I did make was to throw the spinach in at the very end so that it only cooked for 30 seconds and still had a little chewiness to it.  The sauce had a wonderful flavor and complimented the tortellini very nicely.  Thanks for a simple yet elegant dish!

This is SO GOOD!  The creamy sauce was great but still had tons of flavor and it blended perfectly with the cheese tortellini.  We didn't use the spinach since we didn't have any on hand, but it was decilious anyway.  I would highly recommend this dish!:)

Excellent and easy!  I added half an onion and ground italian sausage before adding the tomatoes and spinach. I used one box of frozen spinach, thawed, rinsed, and squeezed dry.  It was perfect!  Served w/garlic bread.

This was very good.  I up'd the spinach and used canned tomatoes.  I also doubled the recipe, which was good, because the 6 of us nearly finished it all off!  Also, cooked up some chicken separately (cubed, lightly tossed in flour, cooked over Med-high with olive oil) for the meat-eaters to add.  It went over very well.  I would put in more herbs next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Paired well with salad greens and garlic bread.

this was pretty good, but needed something. i'm thinking sun dried tomatoes.

edit- added the sundried tomatoes....much better. also used fat free 1/2&1/2 to cut down the artery clogging, and added some chicken sausage.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I too don't like wilted spinach so I did everything but add the spinach until the very end after I added the tortellini.  We also added fresh basil since I had it on hand.  Nummy!!!

The picture doesn't do this recipe justice.  This is a WONDERFUL meal.  The sauce is creamy with a tomato base.  Fantastic if you are looking for a simple recipe with a new flair.

I loved this dish & can't wait to make this for company. It is very quick & easy to make.I used light cereal cream instead of the heavy cream. It was still delicous & creamy. Will add a little more garlic next time.

This was outstanding. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used more spices than it called for. I added way more parma cheese and a little bit of red pepper flakes because we love those. I may try tossing this with shrimp next time. It was awesome!

Loved this recipe! I did make a few minor changes due to what I had on hand.I used fresh chicken tortellini that I had bought and needed to use up. I sauteed fresh onion and garlic in evoo and used about 1 T fresh chopped basil. I also used a can of fat free evap. milk in place of heavy cream. I also did not add the spinach until last minute~ Personal preference,  I just like it slightly warmed and wilted. Excellent, quick dish. This will definitely be on our menu again!!

This was great!  I didn't have much whipping cream so I mostly used milk.  Used cornstarch instead of flour. Next time I will definitely try the whipping cream and will try fresh basil and fresh tomatoes.

Great quick meal!  This recipe is a great recipe starter.  I changed/added as follows:  instead of using canned tomatoes with garlic and onion, I used canned diced tomatoes and fresh onion and garlic.  Sauteed 1/2 onion diced in olive oil until tender, added 8 oz. of mushrooms sliced (cook until tender), added twice the chopped spinach and 3 minced cloves of garlic, salt, pepper, basil, and oregano.  Increased whole milk to 1 cup and decreased cream to 1/2 cup.  Increased parmesan cheese to 1/3 cup.  I also used two 16 oz. bags of tortellini.  I find that this makes more sauce than you need for just one bag.

Very delicious!  I am always looking to make recipes healthier, so I substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream.  Couldn't tell the difference, and I didn't feel guilty for eating a "cream sauce"

Good recipe.  Will make again.  Used canned spinach because it's always on hand and doesn't go bad in my fridge.  Probably will make again.

This was excellent! I have a very busy life and appreciate any recipe that is quick and easy.I cannot wait to make this for friends. I will say that I probably won't use the heavy cream next time, and just substitute it with milk. It was a little bit too rich.

This recipe was very easy to make. I didn't have any spinach so I sub'd mushrooms and added some sherry to the tomato mixture. I also added more cheese. My boyfriend and son loved it. Thanks.

I used fresh basil,added sliced sauted baby portebellos,I also used cornstarch instead of flour and skim milk instead of heavy cream and whole milk.I figured that would help cut down on the fat....howeverI used about twice as much cheese, so I bumped the fat content back up.It was excellent, i served it with a tossed salad and fresh brushetta!!

Wow, this sauce is amazing. I served it atop homemade Parmesan pork caramelle, and it was perfect! I didn't have diced tomatoes, so I used whole tomatoes that I chopped up, and I also did not have cream, so I just used milk. It got rave reviews from my husband too, so I will definitely be making this again!

this was delicious! a few changes i made - i used 3 cheese ravioli instead of tortellini, substituted sauteed mushrooms for the tomatoes, substituted half & half for cream, added more cheese, and added the spinach after the sauce had been cooked. next time, i'm going to try it with red pepper flakes instead of the basil, i like a little spice in my dishes. great dish!

I LOVED THIS! I only gave it 4 stars for one reason and it could totally be me... there was a "sweet" flavor that I did not enjoy. The only thing I did different was use frozen spinach (didn't have fresh). Maybe it was the type of tomatoes I used. I actually had my food production class make it and they loved it too!

It's a good recipe.  It's quite bland on it's own though and definately needs a kick of some sort.  Next time I think I'll add oregano or some Italian Seasoning.  I don't see a reason for the cream either.  I skipped the flour and just thickened with cornstarch and water so I think I'll use all milk next time to keep the fat content down a little bit.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was really good, but for my family's taste it needed more spice. I think next time i'll add some roasted red peppers and maybe a Tbsp tomato paste to give the sauce a little bit richer color. Very good recipe.

YUMMERS!
This was easy, cheesy and good! Here are the changes I made: Used 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup cream, 12 ounces of fresh spinach (might use even more next time) added 8 ox sliced mushrooms, about 1/2 cup chopped cooked chicken breast and used 1/2 cup parm cheese. Fantastic for a cold fall evening.

Yum-Yum!  I mostly followed the recipe...I used a can of Italian style diced tomatoes (simmered a while & then drained) and sauted 4-5 cloves of garlic in olive oil then added more(3 C.)fresh spinach.  This is a great simple recipe!

This was AMAZING!  The creamy sauce was thick... not too runny like most homemade cream sauces.  My husband and I absolutely loved it.  The whole meal we kept saying over and over how good it was!

Yummy! Added rotisserie chicken to it...would add more spinach next time, probably mushrooms, and I lightened it by using 1% milk and light cream, it didn't seem to matter.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great.  My husband said it tasted as good as Italian food we get at a restaurant and requested that I make it again soon.  Made it per the recipe except that I used skim milk since that's all we use.  Didn't have an issue with the sauce being runny.

Great week night meal if your arteries can take it.  It came together super quickly for me, which is nice when I get home at 6:20.  I added more spinach for nutrition and because it wilts down to next to nothing.  Next time, I would saute the garlic for a minute before adding any other incredients to the pan.  I think that would have developed the flavor better.

I hate it when people review recipes that they've made alterations to....but I'm going to do it anyway!!  I used regular canned tomatoes and added 1/3 of a diced onion and 2 cloves of garlic that I sauteed  first with sliced mushrooms.  Other than that, I followed the recipe!  It's really great!!

This was fast,easy to make and yummy. 
The only 2 changes I made was to use half and half instead of cream and add whole spinach leaves to the sauce at the end, to keep their bright green  color.
My husband said that the sauce reminds him of another one made with some voldka. Well, I'm glad this one doesn't have any alcohol, I wouldn't have made or eaten it.
We liked this dish a lot and we thank you for sharing it.

This was so good! As with other reviewers, I changed a few things, but not many. It's nice to have a solid recipe where you can alter a few things and it's still great.The canned tomatoes had olive oil and garlic, so I sauteed shallots, then added fresh basil, salt and pepper, and then the tomatoes.The spinach was frozen, so I microwaved it and squeezed it dry before using. I had light ricotta, so used that along with fat free milk.Very flavorful for such a short amount of cooking time.

Fiance and I make this ALL THE TIME. We follow another user's suggestion and brown 1/2 to 1 lb sweet italian sausage in EVOO and stir in to the pasta mix to make it meaty. We use the green and white three cheese buitoni tortellinis and it's delicious!

This is so good and so easy to make! I could not find diced tomatoes with garlic and onions, so I sauteed half an onion with some garlic and then proceeded to add in the diced tomatoes etc. I did double the amount of parmesan cheese. Also, I think I would use a little bit more spinach next time.
Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

This was great!  I fixed this with 3 cups chopped fresh spinach instead of one, added 1/4 cup more Parmesan, and threw in a cup of sliced fresh mushrooms.  Next time I will add a cup more mushrooms. Used a 19oz. bag of frozen cheese tortellini.  My husband didn't care for the cheese kind (which I liked) and requested meat filled ones for next time.  I may do half meat and half cheese.  Overall it was very good. Very easy to make too!

This was really, really good. I used all fresh ingredients, two large tomatoes (will use 3 next time), 4 cups of fresh chopped spinach (and I am not a cooked spinach fan), 1 onion, lots of garlic, skim milk and fat free half and half.  Whole wheat tortellini and grilled some chicken breasts to go with it.  My "meat eater" husband thought the chicken was good, but the pasta was GREAT!  Definitely a keeper!

Really good. I used 1.5 cups of 2% milk instead of using heavy cream and I forgot to buy parmesean cheese so I substituted a few small Gouda wheels torn up and melted into the sauce.  My family all loved it!  Will make again and try parmesean cheese next time.

Looks great, tastes great and was super easy to make! What more can you ask for?? I did add sweet Italian sausage as others suggested and added about 2 cups of spinach, and just half and half. Oh and extra garlic! Yum Yum!!

I made this a few weeks ago and added chicken breasts, it was a huge hit.  Had company tonight, grilled some rib-eyes and had this for the side dish.  Another huge hit and a nice change from potatoes.  The only thing I do differently is add about 3 cups of spinach instead of one.  This is very easy and quick when short on time.

Nice recipe.  I added mushrooms, because I love mushrooms, and we added cayenne pepper, because my wife is addicted to spicy food; but even without those additions it was very good.

My boyfriend is a vegetarian and I'm not.  I'm always trying to find things that he can eat and I love.  This was one of them.  I used plain tomatoes and chopped an onion in for a fresher taste.  I also put in extra basil from my garden.  They were so good that I made them a few days later....yum

This was so delicious!  I followed the recipe as is.  I added 2 grilled chicken breasts to the pasta to make it a main course for dinner.  I found tri-color cheese stuffed tortellini at Costco so the dish came out so bright and colorful.  I received so many compliments at work the next day when I heated the leftovers.  Everyone thought I dined out the night before!

Very good. I've cooked this for my family several times and my 4 year old and 3 year old love it. We add Shrimp and sausage. It's not bad with grilled chicken but is much better with the sausage.

This was really good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The sauce would be good over regular pasta too.  The only thing I will do different next time is add in some grilled chicken as others have suggested.  Easy and excellent!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was good, but still a little bland. The next day when I warmed up the leftovers, I added a little marinara sauce, and I felt that gave it that little bit of extra flavor it was needing.

I'd consider this average but filling.  It needed tweeking just like other readers suggested.  I added lots of garlic, twice the spinach (since it wilts down to practically nothing), and no-salt added diced tomatoes. I added more parmesan and used half & half instead of a mixture of heavy cream with milk. It was still creamy but mild flavored.  It was a simple dish. Don't make this if you are looking for your mouth to go "pop".  It was a great and easy meal for a fill-in night.

I added more garlic b/c I like a lot of flavor in my food.  Also I did not use any milk, which made the flour unnecesary.

This recipe is sooo good!  It is a constant in my house.  I cook it when company comes over or when I am staying with family.  The only things I do a little different are add about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, more garlic, and 1 cup of cheese.  Love this recipe!  Thanks!

This was good.  I changed a couple things.  I used a can of tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano.  I used 1/2 a box of frozen spinach.  I also didn't add as much milk and cream.  I had skim milk and 1/2 and 1/2 on hand.  I mixed the flour and some milk in a bowl, mixed that into the tomato mixture, then added 1/2 and 1/2 until I liked the consistency.  I also used a package of dried cheese and spinach tortellini, so I was only making enough sauce for 4 people.  Family loved it so I'll make it again.

This was a very good recipe, but I felt that it needed a little something more to make 5 stars - perhaps adding italian sausage as suggested. The sauce was plenty creamy enough with half and half, I will try all milk next time, and maybe throw in some more veggies - artichokes?

My three favorite things, Tortellini pasta, Spinach and CHEESE! I did the original recipe adding more cheese of course because I love it. The only thing I really changed was that I minced the garlic and chopped the onions fresh instead of getting a mixed can of diced tomatoes, onions and garlic. It was REALLY good! Everyone enjoyed it, therefore I am satisfied.

I thought this was okay, but no wow factor for me.  I think it may be better over bow tie pasta...I may try it again.

We used a whole "brick" of frozen spinach.  I just threw it in with the tomatoes and let it defrost while the tomatoes came up to temp.  My kids ate the spinach with very little comment which is great!  All-in-all it was a good dish and quick which means we'll likely make it again.  It is a simple dish with very mild flavoring - don't be afraid to experiment to jazz it up a bit.

I love this recipe!! I have already made it two times.  First time I made it with tortellini and the 2nd time I made it with linguine and shrimp.  This is a keeper.

I thought it was great - added a few spices that were mentioned and used some shrimp up that I had from Christmas.  Next time I'll put in some chicken chunks - we just need a bit of meat to make it a dinner!? The diced tomatoes are soo good in it - I think I could put in two cans,
Thanks!

This was quite good, and I enjoyed this one.  Use canned italian tomatoes if you can find them, because they can them fresh, so there is way more flavour and the tomatoes are much sweeter.  I also splurged and added Parmigiano Reggiano.  So worth it.  I added light cream instead of the full fat, and it thickened up nicely.  Without the italian tomatoes and good quality cheese it probably would have been quite bland.  Thanks for the recipe, and I'll make this again.

This was really good. The kids love it, and it was really easy to make. My only adjustment was to use half a box of frozen spinach instead of the fresh. I cooked it first, then squeezed the water out of it.

Very good, quick, and easy to make. This is a great recipe for those nights that you don't have much time to cook. It only took about 20 minutes to make. I doubled the recipe for my family. The only things I did different is I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used garlic powder. I also didn't have fresh spinach so I used frozen. The whole family liked it. Will make this again.

This was really good.  The only I changed was I used fat free half and half instead of the heavy cream.  I also used about 1/4 more parm cheese.  I had no problem with the sauce being runny.  yummy!!

Very easy and I imagine it would be tastier if I added the salt and pepper. Since I was also making this for my 1yr old (she loved it BTW and danced after every bite) I left the S&P out. I also used half and half instead of milk & cream. I found it a bit thicker than I would have liked. I will probably not add as much flour next time and more spinach and Parmesan. The recipe also made a lot of sauce. Probably enough for twice the amount of tortellini Otherwise, delicious meatless meal.

Delish. Didn't change anything ... well put a bit less milk as per someone's suggestion so it would be creamier, and it was. Have shared the recipe with a few friends who have already made it and thanked me later. My whole fam eats this up, and fights over the leftovers!

LOVE THIS RECIPE! One of my new favorites. It's super fast and delicious. I recommend adding diced sauteed chicken breasts and sliced baby portabellas. I also used 1 cup half & half instead of the heavy cream and milk to save myself a few calories.

Not bad, not great.  I probably won't make it again-I'd just prefer a simple cream sauce with the torts.

Excellent taste and easy dish to make. It makes quite a lot, but reheats perfectly (with a little bit of water). The only change I make is to use canned garlic so it is more mild.

Outstanding!  So easy and quick, yet so good!  I followed the directions exactly and it came out great.  I like my sauce a little bit thicker, so I think I may only use 1/2 cup milk next time.  Thanks so much for this post!!

Yum!  We loved this.  You could probably just use 1 tablespoon of flour.  I added a small can of tomato paste and lots of fresh basil.  Also, adding some ground cayenne pepper is key... gives it a little kick.  I served over a bed of spinach.  Very easy and quick and tasty.

OH MY GOODNESS...this was SO good.  It might have been the best thing I have ever made and I love to cook!  Easy too, doesn't take long to make.  The only changes I made was I didn't add garlic (b/c we don't like) just added garlic salt and powder, and I added a little sugar to the tomato mixture.  I also used cheese ravioli b/c the store was out of tortellini.  We added some grilled chicken too.  My new favorite meal!

This was really good. I did wind up using frozen spinach that I thawed and drained due to the spinach recall.  I did have to season a bit more than called for as it was a bit bland, but it was really good. My picky kids loved it. Thanks!

This was great, and easy to make. Yummy with salad and toasted garlic bread. I loved the recipe as is, but you could easily change it up by adding meat, more veggies, or using the sauce on another kind of pasta. I doubled the recipe so I'd have leftovers for lunch during the week and I was glad I did.

Great use of spinach.  The variations are endless, the sauce divine.  Used half and half.  Didn't have basil so added sauteed onions and freshly grated nutmeg for flavor.  I think vegetarians would love this recipe as is.  For the rest of us, I can imagine that bacon, pancetta or ham would send this dish over the top.  Thanks to the submitter.

I don't know, my family really enjoyed this recipe, but I didn't think it tasted like anything. The flavour was very bland, maybe I did something wrong. Maybe it needed more salt? Or some sundried tomatoes, or more onions are garlic. I don't know

This was a great dish. And a exciting change of dinner for my family. I plan on making this recipe exactly as posted. But I did have to make some changes when I made this the other night because of ing. on hand. I used skim milk and 1/2 and 1/2. And I only had a 9 ounce pack of tortellini. It stilled turned out yummy. Thanks!

Delicious pasta recipe, and very easy to prepare. I added extra garlic and parmesan cheese, yummy! Also used fresh herbs for added flavor. Will make again adding shrimp or chicken.

Very VERY yummy!  This was a big hit with my family, even my 3 year old.  I think the next time I'll add a little chopped prosciutto, and/or maybe a little crushed red pepper...deelish!

I have made this recipe twice this week because it was so good.  The second time I made it I followed some suggestions by other members and added mushrooms and used fresh basil and grilled chicken.  The first time, I followed the recipe as is.  Both times the recipe turned out fantastic.  Thank you for the wonderful, simple, and quick recipe.

Delicious! I've tried quite a few recipes from this Web site with this type of sauce and this is the best one.  I used a 13 0z. package of tortellini and regular diced tomatoes. I also used skim milk to make the dish a little lighter.

Not bad.  Definitely not great.  I doubled the sauce (and I can only imagine how dry & pasty this would have been otherwise), and I used Italian seasoning instead of Basil.  My family didn't get too excited over this one, so I don't think I'll be making it again.

The sauce was savory and delicious.  I did not change a thing.  Very yummy.  My whole family enjoyed it very much and it was very simple to make.  The only thing I didn't like was the tortellini themselves.  Maybe add salt to the water next time.

Excellent, but I reccomend a spinach/cheese tortellini as cheese alone was too thick for me and expanded in the stomach.  As for changes, I reduced the pepper (just a pinch), used diced tomatoes (w/o garlic or onion), 2 1/2 tsp basil, 2 cloves garlic, 4 tbsp flour, 1/2 c milk, 1/2 c evaporated milk, 1 oz cheese, and 1/2 c white wine.  I added thyme / italian seasoning / rosemary / oregano to taste.  We had some chicken left over so I shredded some and added it to the sauce.  I reccomend doubling the recipie and storing the exess to use later.  When refridgerated, the sauce thickens, the wine and cream are less noticable, and the spices are sharper, but it still tastes excellent.

This was absolutely fabulous! I used an 8.8 oz package of garlic cheese tricolor tortellini with the normal amount of sauce and it was perfect. Just enough sauce for dipping the garlic bread (it is great with garlic bread)! I also added 1/2 teaspoon more garlic to the sauce.

This is absolutely delicious. I used spinach and ricotta tortellini, regular diced tomatoes, and was out of basil so used an Italian herb mix. I also added sliced baby portobellos. Also, I didn't have heavy cream so used half and half. This was great and my changes were very minor. True comfort food.

Delicious! I ended up using 2c of spinach & a bit more garlic, but kept everything else the same. I'll definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  However, since I didn't have either heavy cream or milk on hand, I used half & half.  Came out nicely.

WOWIE! This is amazing! I added chicken because of my meat-loving family, but honestly, it didn't need it at all! And there are very few recipes I can say that about!

This recipe is delicious! I use more pepper and add cubed cooked chicken breast. Everyone who's tried it says it tastes like something from Olive Garden!

This was pretty good.  Easy to make, kinda bland.  Next time I'll add more garlic and maybe more spinach.  My husband thought it was terrific, though.

It was ok.  Solid, quick dinner.  I thought it was bland, so I added chopped ham, thyme, red pepper flakes, and italian herb mix.  If I make it again, I would add more fresh garlic and onion. I would also use some wine.

Good Stuff!  I halved the Tortellini (all I had was a 7 oz. box), doubled the spinach, used evaporated milk instead of cream, regular diced tomatoes (unflavored with no salt added) and it was VERY TASTY!

Delicious!  LOVED IT!  I don't think I did anything different than the recipe specified.  Definitely a very easy after-work meal to cook.  Served with broccoli and salad.

Thought that this was just allright, but nothing special.  The color (light pink) of the sauce made it not look that appetizing, although it tasted fine.

I used fresh tomatoes and added mushrooms and onions.  I wasn't really in the mood for a lot of sauce, so I just added enough cream to coat and make a bit of extra sauce.  I used baby spinach and just tore it a bit, and added 1/2 cup of cheese.  YUM.  Hard to go wrong w/this recipe.  I'm eating the leftovers cold right now!  :)

Was very quick and tasty. I substituted the Heavy Cream with Onion flavoured Sour Cream and added more flour to help the sauce congeal. And it came out magnificent. Thanks for the recipe

Recipe was nice, but not great like all the rave reviews . . . definitely not a restaurant quality recipe. I thought it a bit bland. In my opinion, this isn't a "must make again" recipe.

This is yummy!  I would recommend using some crumbled panchetta - it adds much to the flavor of the dish.  This is definately a keeper!  Thanks Lela!
