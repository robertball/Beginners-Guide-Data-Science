Fantastic! As pork producers, we always have a freezer full of pork and I'm always looking for new ways to cook it. This recipe was the best! I did make a couple of minor changes. I cooked a cured ham coated in brown sugar in the oven for the first twenty minutes, then I transferred it to the slow cooker. I used a merlot I had on hand instead of the sangria and added all the liquid to the slowcooker at once, basting the ham every hour or so. When the ham was cooked, I transferred it back to the roaster and strained the remaining liquid into a saucepan. I thickened the liquid on the stovetop with a little cornstarch. This made a lovely burgundy sauce which I used to glaze the ham before I placed it under the broiler for five minutes to make the top shiny and just a little crisp. I served the remaining sauce with the ham.

This is delicious!!  I've made all kinds of glazes and sauces for ham for 30 years + and this is the best. My search is over.  I used a honey baked spiral sliced ham.  I put the ham (without cloves), juice and sangria in the crockpot then packed the brown sugar on the ham. Then I went out to the pool. I turned the ham over and basted a couple of times.  It was cooked in 4 hours but the longer the better.  So easy and tasty! Serve with Pineapple Stuffing and Stewed Tomatoes.

This was excellent! I couldn't find a ham that wasn't pre-cooked, so I used a spiral sliced ham and adjusted the baking time and temperature per the instructions that came with the ham. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Received many raves and will definitely make again!

this was my first attempt at a bone in ham, and this recipe made it so easy.  We had no Sangria, so I substituted with orange and apple (1 cup each)juice.  It turned out great and it smelled so good while it was cooking. I will definately be keeping this recipe!

This was the first Easter that I needed to cook a ham.  Usually my husband's mother does the ham.  I was looking for something a little different.  I found this recipe and it sounded good.  I made it and it was delicious!  Someone told me that it was the best ham they had ever had!  It's not difficult to make and the results are fantastic!  Thank you Mary Glenn and BRAVO!

I added 5 tbsp of honey to the brown sugar and created a thick paste which i smeared over the top of the ham. This helped to get more of the flavor into the ham.

I didn't use a whole ham, and I will try a pre-cut spiral ham next time.  Everyone loved the ham, it was a big hit, also our first ham we've ever cooked.!  Thanks!

We used our slow cooker to create this delicious dish! While the slow cooker is simple and easy, you dont get that sweet crunchy outside coating of glaze. However we took the leftover liquid and boiled it down, added some cornstarch and served as sauce. So good!

Wow! I made this for my family's Christmas Dinner and it was amazingly good.  Great rich flavor without being too sweet and the glaze really balanced the saltiness of the ham just right.  I used Chianti for the wine and recommend it.  Chianti is the tradition wine for Sangria and has a very fruity flavor itself.  I used the pineapple juice and added some grated ginger and orange zest (although I'm not sure the addition of the ginger and zest changed the outcome much.)  I did the 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then turned down the oven to 325 for another two hours.  I brought the ham interior temp to 140 degrees per the cooking instructions on the ham and it was perfect (it was a fully cooked Martha Stewart bone-in ham from Costco.  Almost half the price of the one at the grocery store and I loved it.  I would recommend this ham, nothing tasted bargain about it.)  I did tent it for the last 45 minutes.  When it came out of the oven it looked right out of a magazine, I was very proud to serve this ham to my family. Also, as other reviewers I took the juices from the roasting pan and reduced and served as a sauce.  Only thing I would have done different is to skim the reduction before serving.  Enjoy!

I did not make it home from the store with my jar of whole cloves, so I just sprinkled a little ground cloves over the brown sugar.  I used equal amounts of soft rose red wine and pineapple juice then I topped the ham with pineapple and cherries.  My ham was a 4.5 pound cooked ham, so I halved the recipe and reduced the cooking time.  Everyone loved this.  I plan to use this recipe for the Holidays.  Thanks for sharing !

Everyone in my extended family loved this!  It was my first time cooking a ham,and it was equally simple and delicious.  I followed other reviewers and baked it in the oven for 20-30 minutes with the brown sugar packed on. Then I put it in my crockpot on low for 6 hours. I used an 8 lb pre-cooked spiral ham and I had doubled the juice and wine, as I like a lot of sauce.  It turns out that even though the liquid covered 80% of the ham, it was moist, but seemed a bit overcooked.  I will definitely do this again, but if you are going to use a precooked ham I STRONGLY suggest that you cook it for less time so it doesn't dry out.  Also, I used a cornstarch slurry to thicken up the juice into sauce and it was raved over.  THANKS for the only ham recipe I'll ever need!

First off, this was the first ham I have ever cooked and I thought it was the most delicious ham I have ever tasted!  Not to mention the fact that everyone at the table Christmas day cheered and applauded!  I will definately be cooking it again, probably sooner than expected since my fiance who didn't like ham before I made this one is ready for me to cook another one.

I made this and thought it was wonderful, but I turned the heat down to 325 degrees after the first 2 hours, and then down to 250 for the last hour and the temperature was right on. I kept the lid on the roaster after the first 20 minutes, and I used cab/shiraz wine. I also allowed it to rest for 1/2 hour before we ate.

My first bone in ham. On average I'm not a huge fan of ham but decided to make this for Xmas for my husband. I've never eaten so much ham in my life. I absolutely loved the tasted and how moist it was! My husband raved on about it as well. With the leftovers I made ham sandwichs in kaiser rolls to take to church and they loved it they complimented the ham in it! This recipe has made me a ham lover now. Guess I'll just have to sacrifice to eat these delicious calories! Thanks for the recipe!

I took the recommendation of using 1/2 c apple juice and 1/2 c orange juice- I also decreased the brown sugar because it seemed like too much- I probably used about 1/2 a cup- just rubbing it on the outside and then I poured the liquids over it- made it for a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipes.  Thanks!

A very good ham! A lot of work, though- be prepared to poke a couple hundred cloves into the ham. The smell is intoxicating.

I have been making a similar version of this for years....  I put it in for an hour first to allow the fat to melt so that I can peel it off.  Then I add the brown sugar to the liquid with a 1/4 cup of spicy mustard, mix it up and bast the ham with it.  Great recipe!!!!!

Made this for Easter dinner for 28 people, and it was a huge hit.  The ham turned out great.  I used a 10 lbs pre-cooked honey spiral sliced ham and started off at 350 degrees to melt the sugar and then lowered the temp down to 325 for the remaining 2 hours.  Thickened the drippings afterwards for a delicious glaze. Will definately make again!!

This really gave it good flavor.  I didn't tent it with foil- it makes it easier to baste it.  Thanks for the recipe I could see how this could easily be changed with other flavors.  I really enjoyed the pineapple juice flavor though.

I have made this recipe a couple of times, and my family and friends have loved it. I do make a few modifications though. I do not like cloves, so I do not use them. Also, I cook it all day in the crockpot so that we have a wonderful meal with little fuss when we get home. I have tried a couple of different red wines and they have all turned out wonderfully! This recipe is a keeper!

So moist and juicy when it comes out of the oven!  We used about twice the liquid called for, as our first attempt left us with a burned ham.  :(  Our roasting pan is rather large, so we increased the liquid on our second attempt and the result was amazing - even my picky 5 year old ate every last bite and is looking forward to leftovers!  Thanks for the great recipe, this is our new favorite way to cook ham!

Spectacular!  I did need to tent it lightly. Used a bottle of TJ 3 buck chuck instead of sangria, with the pineapple juice, very tasty.

The best ham I have ever cooked and I been cookin em for 30 years. I will for ever use this recipe. I use an injector like for a deep fried turkey. I make a double recipe  and I inject half or so and let it sit over night in a clean trash bag in the fridge and then the next day start the roasting process and then start the basting. Rave reviews from family,friends,functions! You are a genius!

Super YUM!!  I omit the cloves, noone in our family likes them.  Sometimes add orange marmalade instead of pineapple juice.  Always a hit!

I made this w/ a 15 lb partially cooked ham.  Since I had a larger ham I had to cook it for 5 hours and the top ended up pretty much black.  Next time I would wait to add the brown sugar until the last hour.  I would glaze w/ the wine mixture but the sugar will burn if your ham takes over 2 or 3 hours.  My guests said it was picture perfect but I think they were just being nice.  It looked burned. Once you cut into it, it was perfectly cooked and tasted pretty good.  I will try other recipes before I try this one again.

Fantastic! I used Red Rose wine, and a fully cooked ham. The Ham basted in the sugar and juices until it was fully heated and it was delicious. Everyone raved about this ham. Thank you. It was a delicous part of our Christmas dinner.

This was wonderful!!!  I had NEVER cooked a ham before and thought I had gotten myself info a pickle by committing to cook this past Thanksgiving.  It turned out fabulous!  The recipe was easy to follow, the meat was tender and the taste was fantastic!  I highly recommend trying this recipe....your guests will love it!

I made this with half a ham, as kind of a test drive; studded it with cloves, and in addition to the pineapple juice in the glaze, used sliced pineapple and cherries the way my mom always did. Flavor is great, and the ham was very juicy and tender. 
The only faule I find with the recipe is that it calls for a "fresh ham", which in my area is the same cut of pork as a smoked ham, but it's more or less a pork roast. Might be misleading to some people, I'd have specified a smoked ham in the recipe.

This was Great, I made it last year for easter, and the whole family loved it... i would be careful with the cloves though, my family doesn't care for them(though i love 'em) so i put very few on. i definitely suggest this recipe, juicy and sweet!

This was my first ever attempt at making a ham and my family LOVED this!!  I didn't have sangria, so I just used a red wine we had left over from the night before. Turned out fabulously, just as written.  My only note:  My ham instructions said to cook at 325 and I'm glad I did.  400 would have certainly dried it out.

We smoked a 13 pound ham using this basting. I didn't use as much brown sugar as the recipe calls for, I really wonder how you are supposed to get a whole pound of sugar to stick to a ham, I just pressed on the best I could. I added the juice of a fresh orange to the Sangria and pineapple. This was a very nice change from the super sweet coating of the normal honey glaze. The ham was moist and juicy. We had lots of wine left and didn't need the full 2 cups for smoking a ham.

I made this for Easter dinner and it was a hit!  My mother even took a copy of the recipe so she can start baking ham this way.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results.  Not too sweet, but very moist with good flavor.

I made this today for Pascha (Easter). I used a 6 1/2 lb. ready-to-cook smoked half ham, shank end, and Boone's Farm Sangria. I changed the recipe slightly: I only used about a half pound of brown sugar, which covered the ham just fine. Also, I put the lid on the roasting pan after I added the first cup of wine & juice. After the next 20 minutes, I basted with all the rest of the liquid and re-covered the pan. I lowered the temperature to 325 at the end of the first hour, and continued basting each 20 minutes for a second hour, which brought it up to an internal temperature of 170, so it didn't need to cook longer. This ham was very moist and flavorful, with a smoky sweetness. I generally prefer a honey-baked ham, but this was almost as good. I also enjoyed how simple it was for such a good result.

I made this with turkey ham and red wine instead of sangria and the results were excellent. I brought left overs to work next day and people couldn't believe it was turkey and how good it tasted.  I will definetively prapare this recipe this Thanksgiving.

It was delicious.  I did not use a Fresh, Ham but rather your basic Ham (partially cooked).  It was wonderful and a big hit at the dinner table. I adjusted the times accordingly.  It took about 2 1/2 hours to cook.  Yum!

This ham was absolutely delicious! The only point that I had trouble with was when most of the basting juices evaporated & there wasn't much left towards the end.

This is not the most delcious ham I have ever made.  It was good but not worth the effort.  I had to take it off heat 3 hours into the cooking process because it was black and smoking - even after tenting it.  Once I removed the charred outer layer the ham was ok.  Not moist but not really dry either.  The cleanup is difficult - it will be days before I can get all the baked on sugar cleaned from my roaster.  I will not be making this ham again.

Simply amazing ham! To make it healthier, I replace the unsweetened pineapple juice with pineapple chunks pureed in a blender until it liquifies. This eliminates a lot of sugar and preservatives from the canned juice. I also cut down on the amount of brown sugar and replace some of it with apple sauce which has natural sweetening ability. I make my own sangria; that way I can control the ingredients in the sangria by adding or taking out anything I want. I also added some minced Vidalia onion to the brown sugar and it was excellent.

I made this ham for Christmas and it was a huge hit!!  The only thing I did differently is I put some pineapple in my food processor and poured it over the ham and I reduced the liquid afterwards for a great optional glaze at the table.  I will be making this every year.

I made this for Christmas with a 10lb fully cooked ham. I left out the cloves because my husband doesn't care for them and used Burgandy Merlot since I couldn't find Sangria wine. I lowered the temp after the first hour to 325 and cooked for a total of 3.5 hours. It came out TERRIFIC!! Very Moist and much better than a Honey Baked Ham. This will be my ham recipie from now on! Thanks!!

I've found that this recipe is even better if you substitute 1 cup of mild molasses & 1 cup of granulated sugar for every 1 cup of brown sugar.

I make this ham every year for Thanksgiving and have done so for about 6 years now.  It is a HUGE hit in this house and every person I have given the recipe to says they will never go back to your basic ham.  The meat is so tender and so sweet...it literally melts in your mouth!

This was interesting to cook. It gets very black & carmelizes. Lots of smoke started coming out of my oven so I pulled it out about an hour early. I highly recomend tenting it with foil. It did taste good and was enjoyed by all.

I loved how this came out, not a traditional clove studded ham to be sure. I only made one slight difference, I turned the turkey down to 325 after the first hour was over. It still was done a little earlier. The sauce thickens as it stands, so I skimmed the fat and saved it to serve over the leftovers. YUUUMMMY!

Made this for the first time for Thanksgiving today and it was a HUGE hit. Absolutely a GREAT ham recipe. I only tweaked the recipe slightly. Instead of straight pineapple juice, I pureed a can of crushed pineapple and used a cup of that. I went just slightly light on the quantity of brown sugar and added a 1/2 cup of pure maple syrup (the good stuff, don't cheep out) to the sangria/pineapple puree mix. I used a 7lb pre-cooked store-bought ham and followed the baking instructions supplied with the ham I bought which cut the oven time down to 2 hours at 325 degrees. After the first 30 minutes, I ladled the juices over the top every 15 minutes for the duration of time. As other reviews suggested I then reduced the drippings, added a little corn starch to thicken and served on the side. Everybody loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

What a waste of a ham.  I used an 18 lb fresh ham for Christmas dinner & almost burned my house down.  The oven was a huge mess & all the ham tasted like was cloves.  I would suggest a pre-cooked ham and omit the cloves.  I will not be making it again.

I made this for a family dinner, and nobody ate it after sneaking a first taste off of the platter.  I did as others and placed it in the crock pot to simmer.  It turned brown, and once out of the pot it began to dry out quickly.  By dinner time, it looked like beef jerky and it tasted like a clove.

I have boiled and baked alot hams (we love ham) and this will be the all time favorite.  I gave it 5 stars even though it was kinda black looking, it didn't affect the taste, and just figured it was something I did, will adjust something next time, to try to make it look a little less burnt, but, if it is blackened, oh well, I know it will still taste great.  Thanks for sharing.  I am updating my review one year later, I made this again this Easter, I have come to the conclusion that, you cannot make this (with or without tenting with foil) without it turning quite black, but, guess what?  I don't care, it is delicious, I've never had so few leftovers, and only had 5 for dinner!!!!

It was snowing so I couldn't go out to get the pineapple juice and sangria as called for - so I used apple juice (my kids!) and white wine I had in the fridge instead.  It was delish.  I cooked it in the slow cooker on medium for about 3 hours - yum.

This was my first ham attempt, which I served at Easter.  Traditionally, the ham in my family is just boiled and served with a side of mustard, but I was in the mood for a glazed ham!  Decided on this recipe, because I thought some of the other ones (with orange juice, honey, etc.) might be too sweet (or different) for some people.  The ham came out great.  The taste of wine or pineapple juice was not noticeable in the cooked ham, so everyone enjoyed it! I made a 10 lb ham (partially cooked), and the only changes to the times was that I basted after 50 min, tented the ham at that point, and also dropped the temp. to 325 then.  Will probably try some of the other glazed recipes for comparison, though.  But this is definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe with a spiral sliced ham (lik many others that's all I could find). I started at 400 for 15 min then cooked according to package directions (275 for 2-ish hours). The ham was delicious! Also made gravy with cornstarch and drippings as others suggested. Perfect holiday ham! (As an added bonus I mixed leftover sangria with leftover pineapples and some champagne for a perfect paired cocktail with dinner!)

Made this for Easter dinner using pre cooked ham.  So I adjusted the temperature to the directions on the package.  I used Dailey's red sangria mix with Chardonnay wine since that was what I had on hand.  I left out the pineapple juice cause I did not have any .   The ham turned out moist and flavorful.  My family liked it since it still tasted like ham.

Phenomenal! This is now our Christmas Ham - it smelled heavenly! My only caution is that you tent the ham. All that sugar concentrate basting caused the fatty tips to be a bit charred.

Tomorrow will be my third time making this ham. I would say the prep time is a bit longer than 20 minutes because the cloves take FOREVER to put all over the ham; however, it is a simple recipe and is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!

Made this for the first christmas dinner with my family and his family and it was a big hit! Everyone loved it, made it in the crock pot and made sure to baste it every 30 minutes. Came out moist and flavorful.

AMAZING!!! Used a whole boneless hickory smoked pit ham -13.5 lbs.   I added the wine mixture to the pan within about 10 minutes when the brown sugar smelled like it was melting.  I also turned the oven down to 325 after the first 20 minutes so that it wouldn’t burn. Doubled the juice/wine mixture.  It thickened without cooking on stovetop. The glaze is deep, rich and delicious!  Best ham ever!!!

First time making holiday ham and it turned out great! Instead of using the whole box of brown sugar, I used light brown sugar and I used about 1/3 of the box. I’m trying to eat healthier. I placed pineapples on the outside of the ham (as shown in the photo) for the last hour. Also I cooked mine in a Dutch over so the presentation of the ham was that of an over cooked appearance but the flavor was still great!

I put in the oven for 20 mins, and transferred it to my crock pot, with disappointing results. My ham was pre cooked. It was my fault I overcooked the ham, but brown sugar and sangria did nothing to enhance the ham. Sorry.

Absolutely phenomenal recipe! I made this for my husbands work luncheon and it was gone in minutes. I omitted the cloves but followed the other recipe ingredients exactly. We did used a precooked ham because that was provided to us. Baked at 400 for 20 ish minutes until all the brown sugar was melting and then reduced down to 275 for 1.5 hours per the packaging recommendations. Made a reduction with the juice in the pan by adding some corn starch and boiling until thickened. I can't recommend this one enough, you won't be disappointed.

This recipe is a keeper for our family. It is quite sweet, but fabulous, in a classy bourbon chicken kind of way. My family was impressed with the crust, and didn't realize it was brown sugar. I used almost as many cloves as called for, and would not want less. I used a yummy sangria from Trader Joes, and followed the recipe closely. Served for Easter dinner with scalloped potatoes, broccoli salad & asparagus, it fit the bill.

Remember to follow your knowing when cooking this. Our second time we basted more often than the first. But always succulent and juicy. Thank you for this one!

My favorite ham recipe BY FAR. I usually prefer ham at holiday feasts (over turkey or prime rib) and this one was especially delicious. I can't wait to make it again. To the reviewer who didn't like the amount of calories and fat - you're right, it's not healthy. But it's a delicious way to splurge on a holiday meal!
