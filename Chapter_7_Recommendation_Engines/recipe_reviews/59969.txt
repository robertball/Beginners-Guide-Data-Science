This is a wonderful, very easy recipe!  Make it easier by using a ready made crust.  And don't bother with the boxed whipped topping, the ready made works just fine.  This is a great summer dessert, and it's light enough to have after any meal.  Good for any pot luck/church dinner.  It didn't last long enough for me to take a picture!  This pie is definitely going in the family recipe book!

We've served this pie in my family for years.  It's WONDERFUL and people who think they don't like blueberries always end up loving this pie.  Only thing, is I omit the dry whipped topping, beat the 12 oz thawed whipped topping into the cream cheese/sugar mixture and let the blueberry pie filling be the TOP of my pie...makes a beautiful presentation like that.  YUM!  It's sure to please.
