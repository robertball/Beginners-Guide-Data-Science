Dry cookie; also the dough was hard to work with. I made recipe as written and in hindsight, wish I'd added a second egg, plus, wish I had utilized the add honey suggestion because sweetness was needed.

I made these for my 2 year old son. We didnâ€™t use the whole wheat flour, and omitted raisins and walnuts, but they came out great! He loves them. I just had to cook them around 14 minutes because I think I made them on the larger side, around 16 cookies. Thanks!

Yummy, and fun. 
I used white sugar and added a bit of honey to make them extra chewy

Be sure to flatten it a little so the middle cooks.  They don't spread out.  Yummy healthy tasting cookie.  I added wheat germ too and no walnuts (didn't have any).
