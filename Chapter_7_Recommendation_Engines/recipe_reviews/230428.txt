Very good.  A little messy and they fall apart fairly easily, but tasty.

Love these bars!  Just made them again for our quilting group of ladies.  Forget the parchment paper, I just used Pam and it worked fine.  Love the taste the craisins add:)

These bars are amazing! I did make a few small changes. I used 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs instead of 1 1/2 cups. I used about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips and might even use less next time. I’m really glad I used unsweetened coconut because I do think they would have been way too sweet if I used sweetened. I also doubled the  pecans. I will definitely make them again! In fact I need to have a few left over for cookie plates for neighbors and so I will probably be making more tomorrow Update: I made it again the very next night and they didn’t turn out quite as good but they were still delicious!  I think I used too much of the condensed milk on the bottom layer so the crust was too wet. Also probably didn’t bake quite long enough. I do think they are better with a tablespoon or so less of the condensed milk ( the first time I made them I had some leftover because I was afraid of getting them too gooey).  These issues  would probably answer the complaint from other reviewers  of them being too gooey.

Very sweet and "gooey".   Not enough crackers crumbs to fill bottom of pan.
