We loved this. I didn't have any cherry preserves so I just used frozen mixed berries and boiled them down til they were thick, added sweetener and used that instead of preserves.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used a little over 5 lbs of tenderloin, and there was plenty of marinade to coat.  I did think the consistency of the marinade was quite thick, so I added about 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar to thin.  We prepared the tenderloin on the grill, sliced, and plated for the guests with a drizzle of the sauce.  To die for!  The spicy bite of the pork and the sweetness of the cherry sauce works so well, and makes a very pretty plate.  I passed the reserved sauce, but do let your guests know it's super sweet.  I used Kroger brand cherry preserves, which had some nice, whole cherries in it.  Very pretty. I made the sauce a day ahead, and whisked in the chilled butter after re-heating.  Lovely dish, would be great for the holidays!

Rather than using Smucker's Cherry Preserves, I use a jar of sour cherries, a tablespoon of sugar, and corn starch to thicken.  It makes the compote have a zestier flavour.

This is the first review I have ever done on this site, but I felt compelled because this recipe is SOOO GOOOOD!!  The changes I made were out of necessity because of what was in the cupboard, not because I felt like the recipe needed them.  I used pork chops, not tenderloin.  In the marinade, I used olive oil (sorry Crisco) and didn't have any thyme so I just omitted it.  When it was time to grill, our grill wouldn't start so I threw a drizzle of liquid smoke into the marinade.  Then miraculously the grill started so mine were extra smoky but sooo good!  In the compote  I didn't have mushrooms so I left those out,  I used  black cherry preserves in the fridge (only about 9oz) and again no thyme.  I decided to throw in a little fresh basil from the garden.  This was  FANTASTIC and so forgiving.  Even with all my little changes it was great!

Grilled the pork and it was delicious, even without the cherry compote.  The compote complimented the flavors of the pork and it was a hit!  I definitely will be making this again.

Very tasty.  Didn't have the mushrooms, nor do I care for them, so left them out.  Husband wouldn't eat the cherry compote, but I thought it was very good.  Maybe could have gone with a little less thyme (maybe 1 tsp) Quick and easy, too.  I think you could easily half the compote and still have plenty.

**DELICIOUS** My one peice of advice...start the cherry sauce way before you start the pork...I used porkchops. The sauce takes forever to reduce. I also added only 1 teaspoon of thyme to the cherry sauce thanks to the suggestion of another users review. Thanks user WENDY

Fantastic! The smokey flavor from the grill really added to the dish. Didn't have cherry preserves, so I used frozen cherries, sugar, and corn starch.

This was very good and an interesting change from steaks on the grill. For some reason the pork seemed a little salty even though half teaspoon doesn't seem like that much (maybe it's because I marinated it for 24 hours??). It took us almost 40 minutes to grill the pork so plan the sauce accordingly. I thought the pork would be done sooner per the recipe so I ended up overcooking it. The flavor was still pretty good but the consistency became goopy, sticky and congeeled (more like a chutney/relish than a sauce). We will definately make again!

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I followed it to a t and it turned out great!  The sweetness of the compote with the savory of the pork was the best thing I've made in a really long time.  I broiled my 1/2" chops for 4 mins on each side and served it with cranberry stove top stuffing...yum.  Will definitely make again.

I just used the mustard marinade, did not use the cherry compote, and loved the flavor!  I will use this again and try to marinate for 24 hours.  Great flavor!

Very good! Hint: serve this over mashed sweet potatoes. I used the frozen ones you can buy in a bag in the freezer section. Delicious.

Great recipe! I will try habanero with the pork marinade next time. The sweetness and heat might be a nice variation. I've added this one to my cook book. Thanks!
