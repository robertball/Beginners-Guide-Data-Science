I needed a cake for about 10 people so I added servings, but otherwise followed the recipe. This cake was made as a thank you gift for the nurses and doctors who helped me when I was homeless. I love it. Never fails.

The secret is in the footnote.  Weigh—-weigh.  The other thing is that 7 » tins are impossible to find so I used the 9 » ones and doubled the recipe....seemed to work.
Delicious and is what a Victoria sponge should be.
