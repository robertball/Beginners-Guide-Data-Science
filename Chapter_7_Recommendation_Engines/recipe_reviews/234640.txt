Awesome salad! Used olive oil instead of canola is a much better alternative

Absolutely delicious! Thanks for a great side dish. I had some dressing left over that I will dress a green salad with.

I made this according to recipe except with red wine vinegar and blackberry jam since that's what I had on hand.  Everyone raved about this!   Will definitely keep as a regular.

My wife is not a fan of the blue cheeses, so I used crumbled goat cheese with cranberries. Great!

This is really good but I have a wheat berry source and a lot of people don't. My husband loves it!

Made this today, and made it with no changes. At first I was leery of adding the mustard to the vinaigrette, especially since that was fantastic on its own, but was very pleased at the depth of flavor it added! I cant wait to make it again, I am sure this will be a regular staple in my menus!
