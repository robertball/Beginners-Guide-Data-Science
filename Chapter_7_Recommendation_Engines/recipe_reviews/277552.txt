I had a bag of large frozen shrimp in the freezer and it was a great way to use them. The recipe was very different and interesting, certainly a break from the routine. Made a baked potato on the side and my husband loved it.

We loved this! Added more garlic and red pepper flakes as we like garlic and a little more heat!
