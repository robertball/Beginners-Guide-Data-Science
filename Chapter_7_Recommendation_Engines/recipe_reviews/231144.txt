Great recipe! I added a little more seasoning when cooking the chicken and in the dish itself but all in all it was delicious! Light and very tasty and filling. Definitely recommend.

Great weekday meal...easy to bake. Add the rosemary/thyme directly to chicken marinade as well as some garlic powder for a tastier chicken. Don't forget the cheese.

It was pretty good after adding a lot more seasoning both on the chicken and again on the veggies.

Even my husband- who doesn't eat many vegetables- went for seconds!
I used our first crop of veggies from our garden this year- and our cast iron dutch oven to cook in.
I followed the recommendations of many of the cooks & added a good wallop of seasonings. I ground my favs in my mortar with 1 chicken bouillon cube. 
I cooked off the seasoned chicken breast tenderloins in the butter I sauteed my garlic & onions in- then tossed all the chopped veggies in the pan and remembered to pull the chicken off the bottom up to the top at the last minute. The chicken was nearly done at this point- I then put the dutch oven in the heated oven & cooked for 20 minutes, stirred- added the cheese & returned it to the oven til the cheese was melted & looked right.
I let this rest for 5 minutes before serving.
I Do Suggest serving with a loaf of crusty bread to sop all the wonderful broth you will have. I tried to serve sour dough- but the flavors clashed.

This recipe was a hit with my family! The only reason for four stars rather than five was that the recipe was not complete and I had to watch the video to do it correctly. It is clear in the video that either herbs or pepper are added to the chicken when it is browned and that herbs are also sprinkled over the cheese at the end. I also made the following changes to it: I only had chicken leg quarters so I braised them with the herbs and mushrooms first (figured it would take too long to bake!) and then removed the meat from the bones, chopped the meat and mixed it in to the other ingredients. I only did this because it had to work for my 3 year old who isn't into chicken by itself. I cooked fresh tomatoes  with the vegetables instead of using canned and used half a jar of spaghetti sauce since that was what I had. I only had to bake it for 5-6 minutes because all the ingredients were still warm and I just needed to melt the cheese. It was a great base recipe and I hope those that submitted it will correct the mistakes so more can enjoy it! As for me, I'm looking forward to using this recipe many times over when our summer garden vegetables are here!

This is a great recipe, but I omit the processed cheese.  Any organic product that does not use toxic additives (and anything but Kraft).  It  is delicious and full of all the things we love.

Dish was too watery; chicken comes out rather plain from being cooked separately then placed on top.

This came out really good. I transferred the ratatouille into a baking dish, placed the chicken on top, and covered with foil before transferring to the oven. The liquid in the vegetables kept the chicken breasts moist. Seasoned the chicken with Italian seasonings before skillet cooking. Added fresh basil, parsley & rosemary to vegetables.  I make ratatouille a lot but I really like the idea of cooking it with the chicken since it gives my son something to like in the dish, otherwise just picks at the vegetables.

Tried this last night. Was a big hit! I added some shredded carrots I had and a yellow squash. I used chicken tenders, all I had and also added a can of crushed tomatoes. It was delicious and easy to make.

I added my own twist to the recipe when I made this dish!
I cubed the chicken & cooked it in olive oil, seasoned with what I had in my cabinet. 
Used red onions, zucchini, mushrooms & garlic seasoned w/sea salt & pepper. 
Plated dish over rice. 
Quick easy prep, came out great!

Easy one pot meal! I seasoned the chicken before cooking and left out the rosemary, because I didn't have any. I also used a four cheese Italian blend, and it was delicious.  This would be great for a crowd. Will make again!

Great meal for a lazy weekend. After I browned the chicken I used the slow cooker  and added grated Gouda cheese instead of Mozzerella for a heartier taste at the end.

Tasted wonderful! I would recommend a little salt and pepper. Also, be wary of the amount of juices end up in the pan, it can be a bit much. The next time I make this, I will do something different with the chicken, as I felt it was a little bland.

Made it without the chicken or the mozzerella. Used penne and regiano to serve and cooked it on the stove top. I guess I only used it for the veggies and the portions. I didn't see another recipe with directions using fresh herbs. Turned out great. Also, i doubled everything to make leftovers to take for lunch. Will make it again.

Very disappointing! Bland and the chicken was rubbery.
