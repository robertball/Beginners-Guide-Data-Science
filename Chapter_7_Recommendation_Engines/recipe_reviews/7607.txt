Very gooey.  I only used 1 cup of sugar which made the icing sweet enough for me.  Also I used marshmallows instead of cream.

I made this recipe tonight and it came out really nice. I took the advice of one of the other members and only used 1 cup of sugar. I also got tired of waiting for the sugar and evaporated milk to thicken, so after about 10-20 mins of waiting I added the other ingredients. I put it in the kitchen aid mixer while it cooled off.  It has a fantastic flavor and it's not very thick. It drizzled down the side of my cake and I have a feeling that the icing will still be soft tomorrow. Great recipe! Thank you

Sorry but this is nothing but a sugar bomb.  mallow fluff is all sugar itself then adding regular cane sugar on top of it made this grossly sweet and over powers cupcakes or a cake.  I threw it all in the trash and made regular choc frosting.  Too much work boiling, temperature checking, melting, stirring etc.. for a terrible result. A full waste of ingredients.

No one in my family is a big cake lover.  However, when I made this icing , the cake was gone in one day.  I made one for my co-morkers also, and they keep begging me to make it again.
It is excellent!

I have made this for my son for the last few years on his birthday cookie cake.  I love it too.  The only problem I have is if it cools off to quickly.  Try spreading the icing on before it cools too much.  Very good.

While this was a good recipe and easy to follow it was very sweet and not very thick. Even after it cooled it was still runny and left a puddle of chocolate at the bottom of the plate. Otherwise a good recipe and would use it again just less sugar.

This was really sticky sweet and a huge huge mess to work with, but it tasted and looked a lot like marshmallow fluff you get in a jar. I frosted s'mores cupcakes with this icing and put the leftovers in a container to use as a sub for mallow fluff if I ever need it.

this recipe was good, but instead of using regular chocolate chips, I used white chocolate chips, so that the frosting could be colored. Instead of using regular cane sugar, I skiped that because otherwise it would be way too sweet. Otherwise, this was very good and I would use it again.

This is a great icing.  Follow the recipe just as it shows. No need to change a thing. It is almost like making fudge. While the frosting was slightly warm I poured it over a 9x13 inch cake and it firmed up and was beautifully smooth. You could also drizzle it over cakes, cupcakes or harshly desserts. Will be messy if you try and frost with it.
