To be fair, I usually make recipes twice before I rate them as I seriously dislike reviewers who change, then rate the recipe vs making it as written first.  Good as written so I am rating this 4 stars for ease, time and ingredients usually on hand.  But for my family's preference I made the following modifications.  Used spiral noodles in place of egg noodles as they capture more sauce.  1/2 ground beef and 1/2 hot italian sausage which gave the casserole more complexity.  Used small pre-sliced pepperoni to save time.  Most importantly, this is a great casserole for making ahead ~ as with many pasta dishes, the flavor gets better the longer it sits.  Overall this is a great base recipe to build on.  Thank you Melissa for sharing!

I love this recipe! My husband loved it and ALL 6 of my kids loved it too! I think it's the first time everyone in the family actually all really liked a casserole I made! It was fun to make too. I didn't change anything about the recipe other than I used pre-sliced pepperoni and cut them into quarters. I will definately be making this recipe again and adding it to my family favorites. Next time, though, I think I will add a layer of mozzarella cheese in the middle and on the top since our family really loves cheese. Thanks so much for a GREAT new recipe!

Your basic recipe is good, but I use Kraft Mac and Cheese, make according to directions. Saute extra-lean ground beef with onion, green bell pepper, garlic.  Add two jars Ragu Pizza Quik, and two pkgs sliced Hormel Pepperoni, then bake as directed 350 for about 45 minutes. Yum. Is the most requested recipe by family, and at work. Delicious and easy for kids of all ages. Alison

This was a total HIT at my house! I used penne pasta, chopped up turkey pepperoni, lean ground beef & about 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese. I used an 11 X 7 dish & mixed all the ingredients in the dish instead of the skillet-much easier that way! So easy, so wonderful & will be made over & over again. Thanks so much!

OMG!!!!  My daughter (17yo) wanted to make a deepdish pizza so I looked up a recipe off All Recipes.  Well, I wouldn't exactly call it 'deepdish pizza' but I would call it fantastic!!  The family loved it and it was really hard to save some for my step-son after he gets off work.  We added more shredded cheese (we're cheese freaks) and more pepperoni and left off the peppers and onions and had the best pasta/pizza dish ever!!!

I really really liked this recipe.  I honestly wasn't expecting much because it looked so simple, but it had a surprisingly complex flavor.  I really recommend using the egg noodles, they add a certain something.  Also, the pizza sauce is a very critical element, so I would recommend going with a good brand.  I used Pastorelli Pizza Sauce and it was very good.

This is very much like crockpot pizza. Same concept as the casserole you just layer the ingredients in a crockpot and place on low for 4 hours or until cheese is melted. I prefer sprial noodles instead of egg noodles for the crockpot they hold better.

This was very yummy.  I didn't have egg noodles, so I substituted penne pasta.  I also added a can of sliced mushrooms, since we like them on our pizza.  My family gave it a big thumbs up.  Thanks!

This was so easy to make!  I added the pepperoni in with the hamburg, just to get off a little grease, added a whole jar of mushrooms and left out the onion (personal preferance) I prepared everything the night before and then my daughter threw it in the oven for dinner.  Thanks for the yummy and easy post!

Very good!  I made a few small changes - whole wheat penne pasta & pizza ingreients we like - pepperoni, hamburger (1 lb.), green pepper, small can of diced olives, 4 oz. of pineapple tidbits.  I used pizza cheese blend for the top.  Great tasting!

Sorry but I found this recipe very bland. It calls for no salt or seasonings of any sort which I thought odd while making it but I left it alone thinking that perhaps the pepperoni and sauce would add the flavor but not at all. I made it exactly per recipe the first time and was very disappointed after all the good ratings. However, I saw the potential so I made it a second time and sauted veggies separately in olive oil and then added salt, pepper, garlic powder to meat mixture, more sauce and cheese. Included cheddar along with mozzarella and it tasted ALOT better but rating the original recipe.

I really didn't have a whole lot of expectations for this dish, but actually loved it and so did the everyone else. I did read the many reviews about being dry and added a can of plain tomato sauce to the 15oz. pizza sauce, plus some fresh oregano and basil. I followed everything else except...I also added fresh mushrooms and black olives to meat mixture when cooking on the stove top. I used 16oz. mozzarella, and it filled a 10x15 perfectly. I did put half the meat/pasta/sauce mix in the bottom of casserole dish and then covered with a layer of cheese, reserving just a small amount for the top, and finished with the other half of pasta mix, cooked for 20 min as directed and then topped with the rest of moz. and some more pepperoni for looks and cooked for the additional ten min. I did top with some fresh cilantro & blk olives while steaming hot when I took it out of the oven...waited about ten min and cut so perfect. I will make again. Thanks. Everyone ate too much of this one.

We all loved this recipe, I have to admit I did use italian sausage instead of ground beef and also added some Italian seasoning and a little parm. But I think this would have probably been good as is but I don't eat beef so had to make the change. Great recipe Melissa

I always make a dish the way it is stated the first time and then usually make it again before I rate it. The first time this one was just barely above average for us, although we enjoyed it as a casual dinner.
The second time we agreed this was a 4 star with the the following changes: Reduced the ground beef to 1/4 lb, added 1/4 lb ground Italian sausage, and used a whole pack of pepperoni (7 oz) which is probably not quite two cups by volume. The pizza sauce we used was in a 14oz jar. Unlike other reviewers we thought that 14oz. was perfect. I have a feeling that most of those that want to use more sauce are probably using way more than 2 cups of "uncooked" noodles. We mixed 1/2 of the pepperoni in the mix and saved half for the top, then put the cheese on top of that. We thought this way was really good (for us) and will def. make it again.

This was great! I mixed some of the pepperoni into the meat/sauce mixture, but then I also layered them on top of the cheese like a regular pizza. It made the casserole very pretty and tasty at the same time. I used rotini pasta and Classico tomato basil spaghetti sauce because that's what I had on hand.

First I want to say, it cracks me up when people review a recipe after they have completely changed it.  I didn't change anything here and this recipe is awesome!  The next time I make it though, I will be adding olives and mushrooms.  And probably nixing the pepperoni.  Also, I will use half of a red bell pepper and half of a green one.  Awesome recipe!  Thanks for sharing it with us!

I made this for a group of my Girl Scouts who came for supper...I used Italian pork sausage instead of burger, added a bit of crushed red pepper, olives and mushrooms(canned)more pepperoni, Italian seasoning to change it up a bit. The recipe did not taste like pizza but was very good and the kids enjoyed it for the most part. Oh and I also used rotini noodles instead of egg noodles.

WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I upped the ground beef to 1 lb (liked it much better!) and did not use green pepper.  Added some more sauce and mozzarella as well, and used Pampered Chef Garlic Garlic..  as well as 2 cloves of minced.  Also replaced half and half for the milk.... Everyone loved, it, even better heated up the next day!

Good casserole!  I doubled everything except the green pepper and onion and baked it in a 9x13.  I mixed in half the cheese instead of putting it all on top.

As a college student without a lot of money (and lack of cooking skills) this is perfect. We were like 7 students who got together 6 weeks ago and made larger portion of this and we were amazed by how easy, fast and cheap this was. After the first time making this we made a deal to make this once a week. The result is that now 6 weeks later we are 25 students who get together once a week for this. I got a lot of new friends because of this recipe

i gave this 5 stars with a few changes. i used corkscrew pasta and added olives and mushrooms in addition to what the recipe calls for. i also used 3 14oz jars of pizza sauce. i think without these changes it would have only been a 3 or 4 star recipe. hubby really liked it. his only complaint was he could have used a buttered roll with it. This was even better the next day for lunch!!!

This was really good and really easy.  I don't like giving 5 stars when I modify a recipe, but I have to in this case.  I only changed quantities to suit my family.  I used 1/2 an onion and 1/2 a green pepper.  Both chopped very fine to hide from the kiddies:) I used approx. 21 oz of pizza sauce; a jar and a half.  My grocery store only had 14 oz. jars.  And I doubled the cheese.  You can't have too much cheese.  Definitely a keeper!

Awesome recipe! I changed it a bit based on previous reviews, and it turned out really good. All of my siblings and my parents really really liked it- it was also quite filling. Below is how I revised it (with 14 instead of 7 servings).

Instead of using egg noodles, I used spiral. Also, instead of using 4 cloves of garlic, I did a tsp. per clove of storebought minced garlic. I didn't use quite a whole onion. Instead of pepperoni, I chopped up some Summer Sausage that we had. I also added some fried pre-cooked bacon that I chopped into tidbits. Instead of using pizza sauce, I used Marinara sauce and added oregano. For the cheese, I added some cheddar and accidently stirred in the cheese along with everything else, but it turned out great.

Later on, I also discovered the dish tasted really good with sour cream, it doesn't make it quite so non-moist. Overall, love it!

My husband loved this, but I felt like the pepperoni was a bit rubbery. Next time I'm either going to saute it or layer it on top so it can get crispy.

I'm sorry, but this recipe didn't do it for us.  It was extremely bland.  I even added extra garlic and fresh parsely and fresh basil.  I didn't have egg noodles, so I used baby penne.  I don't think that mattered.  The recipe just doesn't have enough flavor.  It's not much different than eating regular old pasta and meat sauce.  It's not pizza flavored at all.  Even the pizza sauce and pepperoni didn't make much difference.

Good basic recipe. Used rotini and bow tie noodles. Mixed sauce with noodles after they were drained and whatever spices I wanted. Only used pepperoni (because it was a last minute meal). Kind of layered the noodles, cheese, pepperoni. Was really good and my family enjoyed. Will be making again.

OK - here's what I did - I used a box of wheat rotini pasta, 2 jars of pizza sauce, 1 lb hamburger meat browned with one chopped onion and garlic, 1 pack of turkey pepperoni (i took it out of the pack and quartered the whole pack).  pizza blend cheese and mozzarella cheese on top.  Used my big baking dish and threw it in the oven covered until it was bubbly- about 25 minutes- then uncovered and baked for about 5 more minutes.  YUMMO!!!!!  hubby and kiddos loved it!! served with french garlic bread.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

This was such an easy recipe with most of the ingredients on hand. I like that you can customize it to your liking with no difficulty- it will still turn out delicious! I did the same as several of the others- added extra layer of mozzarella in the middle) I also added extra pepperonis on top with the cheese for the last ten minutes of baking. The best part is that everyone loves it from the kids, to my boyfriend, even my picky coworkers! Thanks for the recipe I'll definitely be using again

I loved this! My daughter gave it a gold star, my son wasn't thrilled but I'm pretty sure its because I didn't chop the veggies quite small enough to hide them! I used whole wheat rotini noodles, orange pepper and added mushrooms and italian seasoning. One thing I did different though was I did the meat and veggies separate, I sauted the veggies and pepperoni together in the hamburger juices... I think it makes the pepperoni flavour stand out nice!

It didn't taste exactly like pizza to me, but it was yummy none-the-less.  I was really surprised at how much my husband love it!  I used an entire pound of ground beef, turkey pepperoni, and increased the pasta to 3 cups dry (I used whole wheat spiral pasta).  When assembling the dish, I placed a layer of cheese in the middle of the mixture and topped the whole thing off with more cheese.  Yes, I used more cheese and garlic than the receipe called for, but that's the great thing about being a cook - suiting your own taste.  This dish is easy and delicious; give it a try.

I am MUCH better with computers than I am with cooking, & even I couldn't mess this up!!  One suggestion: do the final mixing in the casserole dish - I had trouble keeping all the ingredients in the skillet.  My ingredients: mild sausage instead of beef, & sliced pepperoni instead of pepperoni sausage.  Mmmm, mmmm!

This recipe is delcious. You get a lot of bang for your buck for the number of calories per serving. I added oregano, red pepper flakes, and dried basil. Next time I would add another can of tomato sauce.

This was recipe was pretty good, but, nothing special for us.  I would rate it about 3-1/2 stars. I made exactly as the recipe states except I made with penne pasta. Although the flavor was good - it seemed to be lacking something for us.  I'll try it again and doctor it up a little bit next time to our taste. Definitely came together quick though and I think would be very family friendly.

My kids and husband loved this and gave me 5 stars.  I added sausage and onion and used more garlic than the recipe asked for.  I will try variation of this in the future.  I will try olives and maybe artichoke and feta.  Basically, you can put anything in this that you love on your pizza.

The egg noddles are really good in this recipe. If you haven't tried them, please do. It makes it a little different than using penne, rotini, etc.
I use my own homemade sauce, and use more than what's listed.  I've made it with hamburger, but my family prefers it with hot italian sausage for more flavor. Other than that, it's great as written.

This was really yummy.  My family didn't prefer the egg noodles so the second time I made this I purchased a can of refrigerator pizza crust (you could use refrigerator biscuits that you flatten also).  After cooking the mixture in the skillet as directed, I turned down the heat to simmer, placed the pizza crust on top of the mixture, then sprinkled on the cheese.  I covered everything and simmered for about 20 minutes (until the pizza crust was cooked).

My husband loved this, but I thought it was more like a fancy hamburger helper. I added mushrooms and used double the hamburg. Our favorite pizza to order is hamburg, pepperoni and mushroom - so we definitely like the flavor combination. With increasing the ingredients, I will use 2 jars of pizza sauce next time (I used one and a can of tomato sauce this time). Also, I will be sure to buy the largest noodle next time to try to make it "doughier" or even try a different type of noodle as others have done. My daughter (7 y.o.) also liked it a lot - she had the leftovers for lunch the next day.

Made this last night for my family. My 4 year old liked most of it except the pepperoni but she can be picky. My 13 year old said it was ok but he would eat it again. It's a good quick casserole.

Oh my goodness: sooo tasty! I added 1/3 lb of hot italian sausage, a few shakes of pizza seasoning to the skillet (beef/sausage/peppers/onions) mix, and layered it: skillet mix, pepperoni, cheese, skillet mix, cheese, pepperoni. I think the secret is the sauce: Used Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this website (doubled). Oo la la! Everything else stayed the same. So good. I can't wait to have the leftovers. :)

This was pretty good as is. Will definitely make again, but like others, will probably add olives and other veggies. Great with salad and wine. This will be a good one to have on hand for when my nieces & nephews come over (without the wine).

Easy to make and a different kind of taste.  Doubled the ground beef and added some bacon and olives to the mixture.  Didn't measure out the cheese, but am sure it was at least a cup and a half, maybe two.  Would make again, but maybe add a cheese layer in between some of the mixture so that it wasn't all on top.

I used elbow macaroni, ground turkey, turkey pepperoni, red bell pepper (my family dosen't care for green peppers) and I made my own marinara sauce from scratch (The Best Marinara Sauce, which is also from this site). I added my own pizza seasoning mix to the marinara sauce. This is a good meal to serve three hungry boys, but I do think it's made better using a homemade sauce and added seasoning. This was quick to make, which I appreciated today.

Hubby loved this!  I doubled the recipe and it fit fine in a 9x13 dish.  Also added some cheese in w/ the noodles and added mushrooms. :)

This was a fun casserole that was a hit with my kids. I used one of the AR pizza sauce recipes in place of canned. I also added some black olives. Thanks for the recipe.

Great pasta!  I used sliced pepperoni chopped into small pieces, cooked with 1 lb. of grain-fed hamburger meat and a few garlic cloves.  I did use a little pizza sauce but didn't care for the flavor and instead used Newman's Own marinara, canned Dei Fratelli chopped italian tomatoes, herbs & olive oil, and a can of tomato paste.  I took others' recommendations and used egg noodles, which were fantastic!  Mixed in shredded mozzarella and topped with provolone, shredded farmer's cheese, and bits of mild cheddar.  Chose to use onion powder in place of actual onions and omitted the green peppers.  Turned out really good!  I would make this again.  :)

This was just ok. We ate it, but most likely won't make again. I used rotini pasta and italian sausage in place of the ground beef which was fine,but I didn't care for the pizza sauce with the pasta or the pepperoni in it at all. I'll just stick to my own baked rotini with marinara. We like that much better. Thanks for sharing, but this one just didn't fly with hubby or myself, sorry.

I made this recipe 3x in a row in one week for different families.  ALL of the families raved about the casserole and are begging for the recipe.  My own family really liked this casserole, as well.

I did make some changes to the recipe based on other reviewers. 

Since I had to double the recipe to ensure lots of leftovers (and I used those very large foil baking pans for buffets) I tripled the noodles to 6 cups uncooked.  I doubled the lean ground beef to 1 lb. I still only used one onion and 1 bell pepper (did not double). I used 2 cups of sliced TURKEY pepperoni sausage (to keep it slightly leaner). I used 24 oz. of pizza sauce (jar and a half). Kept the amount of milk the same (1/4 cup).  And I tripled the amount of cheese to 3 cups.

I followed the recipe as is except I layered cheese in the middle (hence the need to triple the cheese amount to have enough for the middle layer and top layer).  Additionally I put in Italian Seasoning to the sauce to give it some spice.  I just eyeballed it.

That would be the only modification I would change.  I think the pizza sauce is bland without spices. I would try spagetti sauce instead to see if it adds more flavor.  

Because I doubled it I had to increase the cooking time to 40 minutes. 

This was a perfect dish for families who just had a baby.  It didn't have anything too spicy in it that would pose a problem to breastfeeding moms.  And the siblings loved it too!  It's a good comfort food and if you use lean meat, turkey pepp

We all loved this dish.  Lightened it up with 1 cup (2 oz) noodles (lightly crushed), part-skim mozzarella, and used 4 oz sweet Italian turkey sausage in place of the pepperoni.  Added 1 cup frozen (thawed) chopped spinach and 1 cup sliced mushrooms.  Baked, covered, at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then uncovered and added cheese; cooked uncovered for the final 5 minutes.  A new favorite.  Thanks, Melissa.

This a great recipe that can be personalized by every family!  Re the reviewer who said: "I thought the texture of the noodles was a little weird - maybe because they were added dry."  Obviously, that reviewer did not read the recipe directions when she made the casserole!

This recipe was fast and easy. Made a good quantity. But it lacked taste. Neither of my 3YO twins really ate it. And they are noodle eaters and love Italian. I would not make it again. I ended up throwing most of this out because no one in my house would eat it.

My husband doesn't like it when I try any new recipe because he is such a picky eater so when I said I was going to make this he was less than thriled BUT he ended up eating 3 helpings of it and is eating the left overs. Great recipe and very easy to make! Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy and very easy to make.  I made a few changes, but as written, it would be 4 stars. 
I used bowtie pasta, because that's what I had on hand.  I added basil, white pepper, and salt to the sauce mixture.  I also doubled the cheese.  
Instead of mixing the pepperoni in with everything else, I layered it.  I poured half the mixture into my casserole dish, layered pepperoni and cheese, and then poured the rest of the mixture in, and layered more pepperoni and cheese on top.  It turned out fantastic, and I'll definitely be making this again.

This was good. Family loved it. I did just like recipe said and next time I will do things different. Add more seasoning for one and more sauce and a bunch other things my family likes. I'm rating the idea. This is a good recipe to build on. I will say this does not say "pizza" to me. More like spaghetti or lasagna. And I will make this before I make those.

Only comment is that it doesn't make a lot.  If you have more than 4 people in your family, I suggest doubling it.   People will want second helpings!

Absolutely loved this! I wasn't too sure about it at first, but was Interested enough to try it. 
I didn't have green pepper on hand so I used red & yellow peppers instead. I also chopped up some yellow cherry tomatoes from the garden and added a little bit of salt. This was so yummy. 
It's simple and I will definitely be making it again. An easy week night meal!

Really good. I did not use green pepper, just because I'm not a big fan. I added canned mushrooms, garlic salt and some dried italian herbs. My husband & I really liked it, and easy to make. Will make again...

LOVED this.  Ended up making a double batch (minus the noodles)... froze the second batch 'mixture' in a zip lock bag.  Plan to just boil the noodles, mix together and bake for a quick dinner on another night.  

Also - I did not include the milk as I didn't think it was necessary.  When I baked, I alternated layers of mixture and cheese.  Also did not 'add' the cheese for last 10 minutes, I just added it before I put it in the oven and did 1 cooking time (like a lasagna).  Served with a side salad and garlic bread.

This is a great base recipe. Next time I will add some seasoning to the sauce - chili flakes, cumin. I might try this with pork or italian sausage, instead of hamburg, just for more flavour. Definate win with my husband!

I served this to a team full of teenage boys and they didn't like it very much.  I didn't either, even though I adore pizza.  Now I am stuck with a whole pan leftover and no one in my house wants to eat it.

This is really great. I used penne instead of egg noodles and pasta sauce instead of pizza. I think this would be a great recipe for kids to change it up and overall it was rather cheap!

Love this family-friendly recipe! I followed the recipe exactly initially, and enjoyed it well enough to make it again. The second time I made it, I made a couple of changes. I used rotini, an entire jar of pasta sauce, 1 TB Tastefully Simple Onion Onion in place of the gr pepper, onion, and garlic, and doubled the shredded mozzarella cheese. I cooked the casserole for a total of 25 minutes.

A tasty and easy dish to prepare.  I'd use sausage rather than ground beef next time.  Also, I layered my ingredients rather than mix them together.  Came out with a better presentation.

This was good. The family all raved about it, doubled the recipe for us and 4 kids, it worked out well. Next time will add mushrooms and olives and omit the green pepper per family preference but it was eaten up quickly! Thank you for sharing.

Great dish, and very easy to make! The only thing I would change for next time would be to add more sauce, other than that is was delicious. I used turkey pepperoni and added a couple dashes of Italian seasoning. Yum!

Very good.  I didn't know whether or not to cook the pasta before so I did.  I added more sauce and used mini pepperonis...  I liked it very much and so did my picky hubby.  I also added the extra cheese mixed in.  I will do this one again.

Thank you! This is really great! My super picky daughter, seriously, I don't know how she survives with how little she will eat, told me to put this on our list to make for the future! I withheld the green pepper and substituted regular pepperoni for the pepperoni sausage. I used pizza sauce from this site, Easy Pizza Sauce III. Someone said this freezes well. I'm going to give that a shot. Thanks again!

This casserole turned out delicious with just a few changes. First, I wanted a larger casserole, so I used more sauce and pasta. I omitted the hamburger and pepperoni (no one likes pepperoni). Instead I browned a pound of sweet Italian sausage with the onion and green pepper. I added 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms (sliced) and added that to the meat mixture toward the end of browning, then followed the rest of the recipe. I placed half of the mixture in the dish, put a layer of cheese, then the remainder of the pasta. Last 10 minutes of baking, I added a cup of cheese to the top and returned for baking until melted. It was very good.

Very Good!! I didn't use green pepper or pepperoni only because I didn't have any, but I will try next time. I used extra garlic, Italian sausage and Italin seasoning along with the ground beef and onion. I also added black olives and used a some spaghetti sauce only because I didn't have enough pizza sauce. Also used elbow noodles because I didn't have egg noodles. I too added some cheese to the mixture and then topped with more cheese the final 10 minutes of baking. Whole family loved it, will be making again soon!!

This is a good basic recipe.  I used sausage instead of pepperoni as that is what my family prefers.  It went over well.  The leftovers were much better for lunch the next day after the pasta has absorbed more of the sauce and sausage flavor.

Hard to go wrong with Pizza.  This is a delicious dish.  I had to hide the fact that it was a Casserole since my family hate any type of casserole.  One of the kids went back for 2nds.  I used Penne instead of egg noodle since I was out.

Made this for dinner Sat night.  Only changes I made was I used 4 cups dried egg noodles and didn't use the milk.  I divided it into two casseroles, (one for later) and used the whole cup of mozarella cheese on the half I used.  My hubby loved it and when I told my son what we had for dinner he was asking why I hadn't invited him.    PS the leftovers heated up well in the oven too.

This was a quick and easy dinner to make.  I added sliced olives to the sauce and saved the green peppers to add after the noodles were in the baking dish as my children don't like them.  I left one side "plain" and put the peppers, onion, and mushrooms on the other side.  My kids raved about it.  They all had ideas of what to add next time-italian sausage or ham and pineapple.  I will definately add this to my favorite recipe list.

this is a great quick and easy recipe! my kids and husband enjoyed it very much!!! I did add an extra jar of pizza sauce, one jar didnt seem like enough. The only thing about this one is that if you have leftovers you might want to reheat it in the oven...I tried to microwave it and the peperoni was very mushy!!!!!

I added extra noodles, extra sauce, one cup of shredded mozzarella to the mix with little oregano and basil. Don't cover to cook covered with foil for first 20 minutes and then remove and add cheese, otherwise it may dry out.  Will use again!

This combined eveything my family loves together and it did taste just like pizza only without the crust!  Even my picky 6 year old loved it!  And just like pizza, this is great the next day as left overs!  Thanks for the recipe.  We will definetly serve this again.

Great "standby"!  I found that you coud pretty much add any ingredient to this.  The pepperoni and use of milk give this recipe a great flavor. Everyone loved it!

A very easy and quick to prepare recipe. I used rotini pasta instead and cheddar cheese on top as a variation. A complete meal with a salad.  This will be a family favourite.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I used fusilli instead of what the recipe called for.  I added black olives, some oregano, both pepperoni and some chorizzo sausage and put loads of cheese on top before popping it into the oven.  I for sure will be making this again!

This was good but I think it could be GREAT if there was a little less pepperoni, Italian sausage instead of hamburger, an extra cup of cheese and either black or green olives thrown in the mix that bakes for 20 min.. I will be modifying next time to my families tastes!!

My wife and daughter LOVED this dish, I thought it was decent, but not in love with it.  But then, I am not a huge fan of pizza to begin with.  It was a nice change of pace and an interesting twist on regular pizza.  Someone mentioned it was akin to a deep dish pizza, and it certainly is.  One thing I discovered, you can NOT have too much cheese in this dish.

Made this recipe last nights. The kids loved it. My husband and I thought it wasn't too bad but it was a bit bland for us. I will make it again, but next time will add some spices to give it more flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Following the recipe as is leaves it a little bland and boring, thus the three stars, but it is VERY good if you add salt, extra sauce, more cheese to the middle and anything else you like to eat on a pizza (mushrooms, olives, etc).  I also tried it with Alfredo sauce once because our guest was allergic to red sauces, and it was very good too.

This recipe was good as is. As with any recipe you should tweek things according to your taste preference. I used a cup and a half more cheese. I wish I would have used more meat and sauce whichwould have made this great. Thanks for posting this recipe. I imagine I can be very experimental with this.

So, I am one of those annoying people who made this not exactly as directed, so my rating is based on the version I made. I didn't have egg noodles, ground beef or bell pepper, so I just omitted the beef and bell pepper and used fusili instead of egg noodles. I also added in some mushrooms. It was very good! My kids all ate it without complaint and even said they liked it (which is saying something!). I think next time I will double the sauce because it was a little dry for my taste, but overall it was a success. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good!  Made it with yolk free noodles to save on fat and it was still great!  Next time I'll pile on even more mozzarella!

Very good casserole. Great pizza taste. Easy to put together.  Also stores well and can be frozen. I followed the recipe exactly. Aluson19 I would love to know how you can rate this recipe when you used boxed Mac and cheese ??? I found the recipe as is was perfect.

I prefer to make my pizza pasta with Italian Sausage or Johnsonville's new 3 cheese Italian Chicken sausage rather than ground beef.  It adds so much more flavor and who has plain ground beef on a pizza?  I've been making this for years as a potluck staple.  I never put green pepper in mine as I am allergic and some people don't like it.  I also add sliced black olives and mushrooms. If making for at home I will saute zucchini and add as well.  So start with this basic recipe (using rotini or penne pasta, not egg noodles) and tweak according to the tastes your family likes.  Also adding  a little Italian seasoning goes a long way.

This was a very easy recipe, and taste a amazing. My roommates and I made this together and still have plenty of left over. I do recommend using a full pound of ground beef and more cheese though while leaving the rest of the recipe the same, it worked well for us.

4+ stars!  This recipe is a huge hit at my house!  We make enough to have leftovers.  Following other reviews, I used Italian sausage instead of hamburger, miniature pepperoni slices, and a layer of cheese in the middle.  Also added a bit of Parmesan cheese on the top (that's my Wisconsin roots coming out)!  
    Next time, I'm going to try adding more veggies, including zucchini--but it's great as written.  Thanks for sharing, Melissa.

My husband and I are pizza lovers so I thought I'd try this out since it seemed creative and delicious and it was. We both really liked it, I made some alterations though. Neither of us like green pepper so I didn't add those and I only used half an onion since a whole one seemed like it would be too much and I was right, there was plenty of onion when I made it with only half. I also put Garlic salt on the meat,onion, and minced garlic mixture while cooking. It was good that first time but it wasn't cheesy enough for my hubby and I since we are cheese lovers so the second time I made it I added a cup of cheddar cheese into the mixture of sauce, noodles, etc before putting it into the oven. I think next time I will double the batch since this is only enough for an 8x8 casserole dish. Next time I'll use a 9x13 casserole dish, that way there are leftovers because I wanted more both times lol. Overall this will be a great addition to the list of recipes I make for us because it's great!

OK....so we liked it, but we didn't love it, I did follow other reviews as to fry the  pepperoni first, I can see how if you don't, it would be a greasy mess.  This was a nice recipe, but I would not add it to the rotation, it would be added as a once a year recipe. The ease would be more apt to a real pizza, but this was a great recipe to try for something different.

A HIT at my house! For all five family members to like something is monumental!!! I only changed a few things, I used the Rotelle (spiral looking noodles)and cut the pepperoni into 1/4 pieces and no bell pepper since no one likes them. Aside from that I followed the recipe. This will go into the rotation! Thanks

It wasn't bad but it wasn't phenomenal either... It was also fairly easy to make. It tasted more like lasagna without the ricotta then it did a pizza in my humble opinion. Overall, the family liked it and I will add it to my recipe box incase we ever decide to make it again.

We were  not overly thrilled with this.  Our 12 year old daughter said it was a nice switch from tuna casserole but she liked tuna casserole better.  Our 11 year old daughter did not care for it that much.  My husband thought it wasn't that bad.  I felt a little less then that about it.   I wonder if the pizza sauce would make a difference.  We used Classico brand.   I appreciate though a site where we can leave feedback.

My 8 and 5 year old ate it up.  Husband liked it too.  I found it a tad bland, even though I loaded it up with loads of extra oregano, basil, onion and garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  The best part is that I made 2 8x8 dishes and froze one.  The best meal is the one I don't have to make on a busy week night.  I enjoyed it but I wouldn't say it it just FULL of flavor...and I like LOTS of flavor.  I will make again, however, as the entire family liked it.

Made this even quicker as a skillet meal! Just browned the beef, onion, and green pepper in a skillet, added the pepperoni, sauce and cooked pasta and covered with cheese. Kept the heat on low while the cheese melted, and a few minutes later - done! Super fast, super yummy, and it was wonderful!

Really really good! Didn't have quite 16 oz of pizza sauce, and still turned out great! Great easy recipe to make with low cost. Will definitely make it again. Served it with homemade garlic bread.

I'm giving this 4 stars as is, and 5 with the change I made.  My husband and I enjoyed it but we both thought there was something off about it with the pepperoni.  So the second time I made it I left the pepperoni right out and added half a pound of cooked bacon cut into bite sized peices and this is now one of my husbands favorite dinners and I love it too...

For what this is it's pretty good!  I did add black olives and left out the green pepper since the kids won't eat it. Next time I make this I will add a little pizza seasoning to it since its a little bland.

Wow!  This was fantastic.  I had to make a few changes because of what I had on hand.  I used penne pasta and a parmesan/colby jack shredded blend.  Also before I put it in the oven I topped the dish with Italian seasoning and some red pepper flakes.  This was like eating a pasta casserole that tasted just like a pizza!  My girlfriend was heading for seconds even before I was!  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Double the noodles, meat, sauce, and cheese, for the perfect big-pan size portion!  It was a hit!

This casserole is great.  I did add a few things just based on what my hubby and I like on pizza.  I added extra onion and green pepper and a can of mushrooms.  I also used turkey pepperoni just for less calories though.  I had bow-tie noodles in the cabinet so that is what I used and it turned out perfect.  A few reviewers were talking about it being dry so I added a can of diced tomatos and it was perfect.  Will be making this again!!  Thanks for the receipe.

We loved this recipe.  I don't make a one dish supper often because the family usually objects.  I prepared it ahead, undercooking the noodles a bit and cooling them with cold water before tossing with the other ingredients. I baked when we got home from a basketball tournament. I added 4-5 cloves of extra garlic for our taste. YUMMY.

Good quick-fix, one-dish meal.  Lots you can do to change it to suit your taste preference if needed.  Family enjoyed it.. I enjoyed it.  Thanks :)

This is super yummy and easy!! The only changes I made were ground chicken instead of beef, whole wheat rotini pasta and a jar of tomato basil spaghetti sauce. I also added chopped black olives to the mix. Grated some parmesan and sprinkled a little italian seasoning on top of the mozzarella . Yummo!! I am sure you could add any veggies to it that you would normally eat on a pizza. Thanks for a hearty and easy recipe!

This was a HUGE hit at our house for everyone.  It tastes even better than it looks.  We have small children and so I arranged pepperonis on top of the cheese to make a smilie face. :)  I'm glad I doubled this recipe or we wouldn't have had enough.  There were 2 aduts eating and 4 children, ages 8 and under.

Super easy and a hit with the kids.  This recipe is easy to vary depending on taste preferences or what ingredients you have on hand.  We used mushrooms, bacon bits and pepperoni.

This meal has been a family favorite since I found it here three years ago! I started with egg noodles, but now I'll throw any noodles we have on hand, which is usually macaroni shells, and every pasta has been great in it.  It's super easy to customize depending on our 'food mood'.  I make it for every family at church I give meals to. Great for freezing for later.

This recipe was very good. I ve got to say that i live in Egypt and we dont have much choice here for the sauce cans except standart Heinz sauce, but even using it pasta was amazing. Everyone have to try it. But i do advise to use much more spicies :)

Delicious and easy comfort food! Adding some Italian seasonings to the meat while browning adds a nice flavor, as does adding some Italian hot sausage to the ground beef. You can play with the original recipe to suit your tastes. Thanks so much for posting...it's a family favorite!

Made yesterday...Maybe I expected to much from this recipe, but it really just didn't have much flavor...although it did taste a lot like pizza.  I also added black olives and it still just really wasn't that great to me

We served this to 2 adults and 4 kids under 7, it was a hit.  I prepared it exactly as written.  It was given 4 stars because I felt it was lacking in the flavor department a bit, possibly olives or some red pepper flakes would have been perfect.

Awesome!  Perfect receipe to sneak in veggies for kids.  I use 2 peppers, 1 red, 1 green and add  finely diced zucchini and/or shredded carrots.  I also substitute Italian sausage for pepperoni.

This was a hit and pretty easy to make. I also made a version with Alfredo sauce instead of the pasta sauce as one of my friends isn't able to tolerate tomatoes and he loved it! I will definitely make this again.

Tasted a lot like lasagna and not enough like pizza. I couldn't really taste the pepperoni. The green pepper dominated the casserole. Next time I will use less green pepper and try a different brand of  pizza sauce. I will make this again with some changes. Thanks for the recipe.

Quick, easy, kid-friendly, and a good pot-luck attraction. I only gave it 4 stars because it seemed quite dry. I used rotini as had been suggested --maybe the original egg noodles work better. I will make this again, but will mix an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce with the pizza sauce and see if that helps.

I made this the day before and when I reheated it the next day it came out very dry even though I added tomato cocktail juice before reheating.  The pasta just soaked up all the marinara.  If I try it again, I'll pre-cook pasta then heat, mix, & bake day of.

Very good basic recipe. Definitely beats out a box type dinner, if you make those. I added a can of mushrooms and a little cheese in with the mixture as well as the amount on top. I'd suggest adding some additional seasoning such as Marjoram or Basil and maybe some fennel seed. I used turkey pepperoni to save calories and reduce any additional grease and no one even noticed. I also added 1/4lb Italian sausage into the hamburger mixture which gave some additional flavor (be sure to drain off grease!). Made the night before, so I increased the time in the oven before adding the cheese as it needed it in order to heat through after being refrigerated. All in all, an easy Sunday night dinner.

Mmmm...who doesn't love pizza casserole?! I follow this recipe pretty closely except I always add more cheese. You can never have too much cheese! :) Sometimes I add mushrooms or black olives or whatever else I have on hand that sounds good at the time. I also like to use ground sausage instead of ground beef.

Made as written the first time. Added mushrooms and olives per request of my husband. He loved it both ways. He's always asking me to whip this up!

That's amore-- okay, maybe not quite-- but this pizza casserole is pretty good. It was easy to make and didn't require any fancy, expensive ingredients. I, personally, would have preferred a lasagna or a pizza but the combo deal we've got going on here is tasty and different. I told my gent I felt like it was a fancy hamburger helper meal minus all the sodium and fillers.

My husband and I are trying to eat healthier so we mostly have chicken/fish. But we were craving something different and this did the trick. Made with lean ground beef, wheat egg noodles and reduced fat cheese. Awesome. It totally hit the spot.

Delicous! I followed the recipe just about exact - I got a stick of pepperoni and diced it up instead of using slices. I know from other recipes that sliced pepperoni sometimes gets "lost" in a meal so we like the small chunks of it better. Yum! Will make again!!

Surprisingly my husband and my daughter both liked it. I was out of egg noodles so I broke up some lasagna noodles. I was also out of jar pizza/tomato sauce so I improvised and made my own. Very good.

This was a good way to use up some fusilli and jarred sauce that I got for free. I added fresh sliced mushrooms and used a mixture of red, green and yellow peppers.  I placed half the pasta mixture into the dish, added a layer of cheese and the remaining pasta. After baking for 10 mins. I topped it with the rest of  cheese. Great use of ingredients that I had on hand.

I thought this would be a hit with my three year old since pizza is his favorite thing in the world to eat, but for some reason it wasn't. My husband and I thought it was okay, but nothing really memorable. The casserole is very cheesy, which I liked about it. I will probably make this again in a couple of months and see if my son likes it any better. Thanks for the recipe, Melissa!

I made this for my family tonight. I like to cook meals that will reheat nicely so I can have a quick easy lunch for a few days. This would have been great for that IF there had been any leftovers. This was a huge hit with my family. Only person that did not like it was my younger brother who is going through a phase where he doesn't want anything unfamiliar. He thought I was making regular pizza, so he was disappointed. But everyone else loved it. My 1 year old sister was lurching towards her bowl. We couldn't keep the bites coming fast enough.

I used a little more cheese than it called for. Maybe around a cup and a half. I also added some mushrooms and used mini pepperoni instead of the full sized pepperoni. This was a quick easy meal and it's absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this one again!!

I am a picky eater, but I licked the plate on this one.  My husband made it with a few changes.  I couldn't figure out how to post a custom recipe, and making changes and reviewing it is a pet pieve of mine.  He used a whole package of noodles, 1 lb of ground beef, 1/2 lb of mild Italian sausage, 32 oz of spagetti sauce, 1 package of pepperoni slices on top, and a 16 oz package of mozzarella cheese.  So you see, except for the addition of the Italian sausage, all the ingredients were the same, just a bit more.  Boy, did it turn out good!!

This was very good! I think I'm going to add two cans of pizza sauce next time, but it was good like this. My mom was here to eat it with us, and when I offered her seconds, she said, "I really shouldn't, but it's so good! Yes!" I wound up giving her the copy I printed so she could have the recipe, too.

This was so good even though I left out the bell peppers and forgot the milk! So easy, would be a good meal to make ahead a day ahead. Next time I'll remember the milk and add Italian sausage to give this dish more flavor.

I really enjoyed this.  To be more healthy, I used whole wheat rotinin instead of the noodles.  Other small changes I made were to season ground beef with garlic powder and salt, added oregano to sauce, used spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce, didn't use the milk, and added some shredded Italian Cheese after baking.  Easy, filling, and delicious.  Makes a Saturday lunch or dinner.

This was decent.  Seemed to be lacking something.  We ate it all but don't know that I would make it again.  Also, used whole wheat noodles to make it a bit healthier.

I was looking for something to do with my Pizza night leftovers because I ended up buying too much pizza sauce and had leftover toppings like black olives, mushrooms and pepperonis. 
Due to making this as a leftover-user, I made the following changes:
-I used pre-sliced pepperonis and cut them into fours
-I used no-yolk egg noodles
-I added more mushrooms and black olives (I see others did this as well)
-I used spicy chicken sausage in lieu of ground beef (I have a no-beef family member)
-I lastly topped with BOTH mozzarella and parmesan because I had it
Basically this turned out delicious. I only gave it 4 stars because it is so high in grease and fat that after eating TWO large servings, I got a stomach ache! But I guess that isn't the recipes fault!!!

This is a good basic recipe, that you can make lots of alterations to suit your taste. We used sausage instead of the beef/pepperoni and it was great. I don't understand the need for the oven, we just mixed the cooked noodles with the rest of the ingredients in a skillet and let simmer with a lid for 15 minutes, and perfect. No need for the extra baking time.

I added a few shakes of dried basil, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. I also added sliced black olives, and next time I think I will add some chopped up mushrooms too! I baked it in the oven for 13 minutes, and then added cheese and baked it an additional 7 minutes.

This was pretty good. I used more than 2 cups of pasta though, because 2 cups didn't seem like nearly enough. I used more like 3 1/2 cups. I think it was better this way.

We love this! I usually double up on the meat, adding some italian sausage in there for flavor and a heartier meal. I suggest using a FLAVOR PACKED sauce, or adjusting it yourself, as this is a basic recipe that needs some personal touch-ups. 

MAKE IT LOTS!

very good! I added a little extra pizza sauce to keep it from being dry, but otherwise everything else was the same. A big hit at the carry-in!

I love this recipe. My 1.5 year old son does, too. I've made it twice now, and he has gobbled it down every single time. I use penne noodles and only add sausage, pepperoni, cheese, and sauce, because my husband doesn't like veggies in his pizza. This is a quick and easy recipe, great for nights when you need a quick meal! Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe--but I don't know who thought this could be 6-8 servings. I was very disappointed, as I was making this for my family of five and there was barely enough for four. Maybe for 7 children, but not 5 adults. I guess I should've looked harder at the recipe instead of assuming the amount of servings was correct.

This casserole was not only easy, it was really good.  I used turkey pepperoni to make it healthier and surprisingly it tasted very good!  I also added a bit more sauce because I like it a little saucier.  Thanks for the easy family meal.  :)

Excellent! The egg noodles let the flavors meld perfectly. Add any pizza toppings you like, and you have a delicious meal! I used crimini mushrooms, yellow onion, bell peppers, 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 pound italian sausage, and 1/2 cup pepperoni.
For a classy texture, cut the pepperoni slices in strips the width of the noodles.
I accidentally left out the milk and put the cheese on top at beginning. I only baked it for 25 minutes total, and it came out great!

I made this casserole the other night.  I thought the recipe was easy to follow.  However, my family was not a big fan of it.  It needed more flavor.

Loved the flavors, it really tastes like supreme pizza but with pasta. Only thing I did notice is that it makes too much for my casserole dish so some ended up getting tossed instead of baked. Otherwise it is definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  It has 2 things that I just adore in a recipe, it's easy and tastes really good!  You just have to use egg noodles, it just changes the taste of other pizza pastas I have had, it makes the dish in my opinion!  I have shared this with girlfriends, my sister, and a few teacher friends.  Busy moms and dads will appreciate this one!  Thanks for the recipe, the options are endless!

This was really excellent.  The kids and my husband realy loved it.  I used rotiini instead of the egg noodles.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  I am planning on making a batch for the freezer as it got eaten up too quickly last time.

The family loved this!  Made a few small adjustments because my family likes their food spicy.  I generously seasoned the ground beef with salt and pepper.  Added extra garlic, diced jalapenos, olives and red pepper flakes.  I added a layer of mozarella and parmesan as others suggested in the middle. This turned out great and they went for seconds even my picky husband.

Loved this recipe.  Did make some minor adjustments.  Did not add green pepper as my son doesn't like them and we added more cheese.   Added some to the mixture and the rest on top.  But other than that....it is a very good satisfying recipe.  I make-up my own pizza sauce by using Newman's Own Marinara Sauce and some tomato paste.  I also add fresh oregino and basil to the sauce in season.  THANK YOU for sharing a great recipe!

we use cheddar because of the lactose intolerant in the family -- also very lean beef or turkey and turkey pepperoni.

THIS WAS AWESOME! Sooo yummy! It just needs more - pizza looks. =) Add all your favorite pizza toppings in the casserole (olives, banana peppers, other veggies, raw onions?). OH AND, it looks JUST like a pizza casserole when you put the mozzarella cheese on top and then top it with more toppings (or only pepperoni, if you like) and gosh, that's one darn good pizza.. I mean, casserole. ;)   P.S. for all you cheese lovers like me, pour half of the casserole in the dish.. top with LOTS of cheese, then put the remaining pasta, and MORE CHEESE!!!

Very good, but I would add more sauce. My hubby  and father-in-law raved about it, they loved that it had pepperoni in it. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Pretty good pasta.  I added extra cheese, which I think was a good choice.  My husband liked it pretty well.  I made this with the intention of freezing part of it so I don't have to cook right after my baby is born.

Very good and very easy.  I added more cheese like some of the other reviewers.  The meal was great the last night for dinner, but even better this afternoon as leftovers.   Definitely a keeper.

My daughter summed it up best when she said "This isn't good...it's AWESOME!!" Everyone loved it, and it was so easy to make!  I was feeding 8 people, so I did 6 cups of egg noodles and double everything else. We love mushrooms and bacon on pizza, so I included that too. (In my opinion the bacon was a key ingredient!)  When I looked at the pictures, I thought it would taste more like lasagna, but it didn't at all! It tasted like pizza and exceeded all of our expectations!  I can't say enough about this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing!

This was much better than I expected. I baked it in a deep casserole dish, which helped it stay moist. I added another layer of cheese in the middle of it, and topped it with sliced black olives. I will definitely make this again.

doubled the recipe used 1lb. ground beef, 1 lb. of Italian sausage 1 onion, 4 cloves of garlic left out green pepper, 1 c. pepperoni 2-26oz cans spaghetti sauce and 3 cups  mozz. cheese. Mixed some parm cheese with pasta and sauce. Out of five kids they all liked it very much and said I couldl make it again which is kinda hard with five kids to please them all. :)

Loved this!   I usually try to make the recipe as submitted the first time, but I just couldn't see noodles in this, so used rotini, and used Italian sausage instead of hamburger for more "pizza" flavor.  All the flavors blended really well, and was a big improvement over a plain rotini/spaghetti sauce/mozzarella casserole.

Excellent! Use the egg noodles, penne, rotini, and rigatoni are just not the same.  This recipe can easily be doubled and baked in a lasagne pan, go easy on the onion.  The beauty of this recipe is that you can use any of your favorite pizza toppings.  You can brown up to two pounds of loose hot or sweet sausage with some good baked ham. Pepper rings, black olives, thick sliced pepperoni (halved), mushrooms, if you like that sort of thing. I used 4 cups of Italian cheese blend.  Saved some ingredients for a topping, threw on top after 40 minutes, baked an additional 5-10.  Thanks Melissa!  Again, use the egg noodles, you're not making baked ziti.

tasty and easy.  I skipped the bell peppers, since I never was a fan, and put in crushed red pepper instead.  I also added a few shakes of oregano and basil, used only a quarter of a sweet onion and used hot Italian sausage instead of ground meat.    Then I plated it up for a photo and proceeded to dump the whole plate into my toaster...

My family loves this recipe, even the tough critics.  You can make your own sauce and substitute cheeses, it's great and versatile! Don't be afraid to try it even though it sounds different.

Just made this recipe for dinner tonite...so much easier than actual homemade pizza!  And, I already had all the ingredients on hand, which was a plus also.  I fixed one pan "supreme style" - this one was 13x9 pan with rotini noodles, pizza sauce, hamburger, sausage, pepperoni, onions, mushrooms and black olives. The smaller pan was "pepperoni only" which left out everything except the pepperoni, hamburger, sausage and cheese for my picky daughter, who said her version was"the bomb".  The rest of us also loved the fully-loaded version....I forgot to add the garlic - probably would've made it even better....and I didn't add the milk.  I used 3 jars of pizza quick sauce, 1 lb hamburger, 1 lb pork sausage, 1 pkg pepperoni, 4 cups shredded mozzarella which I layered between the pasta in the pans. I also used a large can of mushrooms, 1 large onion, and 1 can chopped black olives with 1 box rotini noodles. It made a full 13x9 pan, plus a small brownie pan of the pasta.  We all loved it, and it was a quick and filling meal.  Next time I will remember to add the garlic, and dice up a small amount of the green pepper (it was the only thing I didn't already have).   I have added this recipe to my "keeper" book.  Thanks so much for sharing it!!

I made a few adjustments and WOW - so good!!! 1)I used rigatoni pasta. 2)I spiced up the hamburger with "Italian Style Sausage" AR's 3)I made my own pizza sauce with "Easy Pizza Sauce II" AR's and 4)I doubled the cheese, I layered casserole, 1 C. cheese, casserole, 1 C. cheese. Man oh man, what a flavorful dish!! This will be added to the rotation!

In what is an absolute first for Allrecipes.com users, I actually made this recipe as it is written - no substitutions, lol. It was very good. It actually tastes better the second day. I will make this again - everyone liked it. Served it with a salad and dinner was done.

Yummy recipe.  I have tried other pizza casserole recipes from this site and this is the best so far.  I did add red pepper flakes and some garlic salt to give it a little more flavor.

Great recipe!  I used whole wheat pasta instead of egg noodles and marinara (spaghetti) sauce instead of pizza sauce...and didn't use milk.  I also topped it off with more pepperonis on top of the cheese, and it was wonderful.  I actually thought it was better re-heated, so it may end up being one of those dishes that I prepare and freeze for a quick heat-up-and-eat meal.

I added in sliced olives and italian sausage browned instead of beef.  Made it more like pizza.  Very good meal and my 7 year old and 39 year old loved it!!

This was so easy and soooo tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used a stick of pepperoni that I cut up into small bite-sized pieces.

We just love this dish! So delicious, easy, full of flavour. I use ground Italian sausage in place of the ground beef, and sometimes add sliced fresh mushrooms, but all else is exactly as written, right down to the egg noodles. We have had this three times in the past month. A keeper for sure.

This was just as delicious as all the reviews said it was. I used ground turkey and I forgot the pepperoni but it still was a hit at my house. I also only had spaghetti sauce, so I just used that and the recipee turned out great. This casserole multiplies really well and easily can fill a lot of people. Only one thing left to say...delicious!

I followed the basic recipe instructions except that I increased the cheese, as had others. I also added garlic and oregano.  In my opinion it didn't taste anything like pizza but my husband loved it, has commented on it a couple of times since - usually a good sign!  I enjoyed it also but not enough to rave about it.  However, it is a good recipe and I may make it again.

This is a great recipe for families. As usual I made a few variations.  Instead of putting in all the pepperoni I only added half to the mix and saved half to add to the top, like a pizza. Then I added the cheese over the pepperoni.  It was a nice touch.  It came out great!  We all loved it and I will make this again.

I followed some of the other suggestions and used more sauce and cheese.  I mixed in some of the cheese and also added some for the last 5-10 minutes as suggested in the recipe.  I used veggie jalapeno cheddar sausage and that worked well.  I'll make this again, but next time probably add more veggies: olives, mushrooms,...

A great recipe!  I too used turkey pepperoni and omitted any other meat.  Sauted the veggies in a little bacon fat (calm down, it was only a tablespoon).  Put cheese as recipe instructs but will probably mix in next time.  Only fed 3 in our house.  You can add ingredients the same way you select toppings for your regular pizza.  Used jar spagetti sauce and was fine.

This was great. You can get really creative with this recipe. Definitely add more cheese to your casserole if you are a cheese fan. This is going to be added to our dinner rotation. Make the recipe healthier with some ground turkey and different whole wheat pastas.

My wife made a version of this last night.  Instead of the egg noodles she used spaghetti and substituted Italian sausage for the ground beef.  I know this is not the same as the original but the original was a great starting point.  Great meal!

My family loved this!!  Even the picky 3 yr. old.  The only thing I did different was use mild italian sausage instead of ground beef.  It worked out great.  I will probably sneak in more veggies next time.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

My hubby and I thought this was pretty good. I did make a couple changes though. I added mushrooms and I also sprinkled it with Parmesan cheese before I put it in the oven. I also think next time I will try a different kind of noodle and dice the pepperonis.

yummy! I didn't have bell pepper, so I subbed in red pepepr flakes. Spicy, but that's how we like it anyways! I also forgot to cook the noodles 1st, oops! But it didn't matter it came out fine. I heated for awhile longer in the skillet, so that must have helped. 

Also- I minced my onion, and alot of it, and it came out great. I used a frozen premade burger patty that was exactly 1/2 lb for the ground beef. I highly recommend!!!

Made it almost exactly as recipe stated, except I added fresh mushrooms and used 2 cans of pizza sauce and some herbs.  Even then, I didn't really like it.  I still thought it was bland and the egg noodles didn't fit at all.  Husband ate it but said he didn't want it in the dinner rotation.  Kids refused to touch it at all and my 3 yr old is normally anything but picky.

This is such a great recipe!  I added pineapples to it, because my husband and I love pineapples on our pizza!  It made way too much for the two of us, so we split it out and put it in the fridge for leftovers!  I made it healthier by using ground turkey and turkey pepperoni.  We also added pizza seasoning and crushed red peppers for some extra kick!  Yum!

I used this recipe on Fri. the 3. I made this for my parents and sister for dinner. I substituted spaghetti sauce for the pizza sauce and a package of pepperonni that was already sliced for the pepperonni sausage. I am only fifteen and this is the first dinner recipe that I have ever used and it turned out great. There was none left over.

This was pretty good, I used 1/2lb italian turkey sausage and 1/2lb of ground beef.  I added black olives and used turkey pepperoni instead of regular. Used 2 cans of pizza sauce to make sure it was not too dry. Also added a layer of cheese in the middle.

Simple to make but tasty, tasty! I made the Easy Pizza Sauce III for this recipe.  Good!  I also added 1 can of olives, sliced (yeah, we LOVE olives!) and a can of mushrooms. I have to have mushrooms on my pizza! I also liked this because it reheats so nicely in the microwave. This will surely be made again. Thanks!

This was delish!  I didn't quite have enough sauce and it was still wonderful.  I also added more spices to the meat while it was cooking.  It was even great the next day for lunch.  Thank you for the recipe!

OK, so...to preface this...I can't eat gluten (wheat) and I'm allergic to dairy...so I didn't make this recipe exactly as written. I used rice milk instead of regular milk, I used brown rice pasta instead of egg noodles, and I omitted the cheese. It was still pretty decent. I baked it covered with aluminum foil so that it would stay moist since I didn't have cheese. It could definitely use more sauce - I think it would need more sauce even if I had the cheese. I saw that some people said that it was just like spaghetti. I guess does kind of have that type of flavor, but I associate pizza sauce with pizza, so anything with pizza sauce tastes pizza-y to me. Use real "pizza sauce" if you want it to taste like pizza, not just tomato sauce. Also, you could add some extra uncooked pizza sauce at the end..pizza sauce loses a little bit of the pizza-ness when it gets cooked into the noodles.

This is a good basic recipe but I agree that it is a bit bland.  I did cut the pepperoni slices into fourths.  If I make it again I will add some Italian seasoning and some pepper.  The kids love it!

This is between a 3 and a 4. I used more noodles, part skim cheese, no green pepper, and whole milk. The meat needed more seasoning so we added so seasoning salt and garlic powder and pepper. We thought it was a tad bland. Though on leftover review it is a little better. I think I'm still looking for a "pizza" casserole. This wasn't much better than my BF's improved version of Hambuger helper. Oh and I used turkey pepperoni. I cut the slices up smaller (good idea)

Would have been easier to open a box of Hamburger Helper and melt some cheese on it after it cooked.  This was ok, but not worth the effort.  I'd say fair, at best.

This recipe was good, but I don't understand why it's called pizza casserole? It was more like baked mostacolli, but with egg noodles. My family enjoyed this well enough regardless. I was just expecting something more true to the recipe title.

I made this last night and it was a huge hit - even with my younger son who is very picky!  I used 3 cups of rotini instead of 2 cups of egg noodles, and I added sauteed mushrooms.  Very delicious and kids have already said "you must make this again".

We really liked this recipe.  Left out peppers but added black olives and extra cheese.  Also used bite size pieces of pepperoni instead of slices.  Will make it again.

This was a great meal! I used canadian bacon instead of pepperoni and cooked it with the green pepper and onion first, to soften their texture, then mixed in w/beef. My husband said he rather have this dish instead of pizza! Oh, and I also used only 1/2 onion and 1/2 green pepper - because of the size, so you may want to keep in mind if you purchased large produce. Enjoy!

I made this for a potluck dinner this weekend and it was all eaten up.  I was hoping for leftovers.  I added both green peppers and mushrooms (canned). It was very easy to make and I also used spaghetti sauce instead if pizza sauce since that is what I had on hand and I used about a jar and a half because I didn't want it dry like I had read some peole said it had turned out and it was just wonderful.  I plan to use this often for when I have to serve a dinner to a group of people since it is just my husband and I at home anymore.  I highly recommend this recipe!!!!!!  I got many compliments on it.

Very good dish, simple and quick. Reminds me of mock lasagna but, just a few different things here or there or left out. Very good though and would be a good lunch dish but, not a good dinner dish something would have to be changed. ? In our opinion.

Substituted venison Italian Sweet Sausage and red peppers.  Red peppers are sweeter. Topped with mild cheddar, mozzarella, and Italian shredded cheese (Parmesan and Asaigo). Delish!

No changes. I am fed up with  reviewers modifying a recipe  to an extreme where It's no longer recognizable. Why do these people even bother with the recipe? Write your own cookbook if you think you have better ideas. I make the recipe "as is" at least once before reviewing  then privately make adjustments to suit my family.

This is the only dish my 3 yo has ever asked for again!  The whole family loves it.  I tried to make it healthier by switching to whole grain rotini pasta (egg allergy) and added spinach.  I did add more cheese to the mix and then on top as well, though.  Cheese is healthy, right?

I made this today, pretty much as it is written. As some reviewers suggested, I sauteed the pepperoni with the veggies and drained everything in a colander to cut down on the fat. I also added half of the noodle mixture,  put in a layer of cheese, then added the rest of the mixture. I took the casserole to a family dinner. Everyone loved it, especially my teenage niece who ate 3 helpings. Several people asked for the recipe. I will make it again, although I will probably add mushrooms and maybe make other alterations as I like lots of topping on my pizza.

I had some egg noodles and hamburger and wanted a recipe that was different, and my family would love it!  This recipe was perfect for it!  Who doesn't love pizza, and this was very easy!  This recipe works for even the picky eaters!  My family loved it!  I did too!  You could actually add anything you like on pizza and it would work,  I actually added some Italian seasoning, kosher salt, pepper and some fresh basil to the dish,  I think it would be sort of bland without it.  Next time I might add mushrooms and Italian sausage.  Thanks Melissa, this is a winner!  I will definitely make this again!

I always try to make a recipe without too many alterations but having dietary restrictions, sometimes it's impossible.  I had to use gluten free rotini instead of egg noodles and I had to omit the onion and garlic completely (yay for IBS!).  I also mixed in one cup of cheese into all of the ingredients cause there's no such thing as too much cheese in my book.  It turned out pretty good!

Used spinach noodles for a nice color change and orange pepper in place of green- just a preference. We loved it. The directions for 7 servings (the default) will actually serve 4-5. Next time, we’ll do 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage. But really like this recipe as written!

We loved this recipe!  I made a few changes. Used Italian sausage instead of hamburger and then used rotini instead of egg noodles. I basically doubled the recipe with most ingredients. So I did layer some cheese in the middle. Will definitely make this again.

One of the best resipies I've made! 
Kind of confused about the milk, made it with out it. And with regular plain spaghetti sauce we also added sausage, mushrooms and green olives.
Every one ate it and my 5 year old didn't even notice the mushrooms. 
Great dish for big crowds!

I more than doubled the receipt, I used 1 lb lean ground beef and 1 lb Italian sausage. I cut up the pepperoni sausage into quarters ( bite size) 
I did everything as you would if you had doubled the receipt. 
I cooked it for 30 mins since there was more of it. and put it back in the oven after the cheese for 5 mins.  I will make this over and over.  Warms up great in the microwave.

Used a full package of hot sausage because I needed to use it up. Also swapped egg noodles for rotini and added extra cheese. I was worried it would be dry so I covered it during the first 20 minutes of  baking. It was great!

I doubled this and added a can of diced tomatoes and extra Italian shredded cheese. I also combined and cooked everything in one large pan on the stove, omitting the milk. Just cooked as directed but covered on the stove. I've found this seems to give more flavor than putting in the oven.

Delicious!  Made almost as directed: green peppers don't agree with us, so I substituted some mushrooms.  Also had no pizza sauce on hand, so used spaghetti sauce.  It was a huge hit!  It has already been requested again.

Like a couple of other review I've read...This recipe is very bland if followed as directed. I didn't make any changes and the flavor pay off was alright. I would make this again but with a lot of changes, i.e. adding some spices to the ground beef. This recipe has a lot of potential.

With 1372 reviews it may not need my 2 cents worth but this is in my top 5 favorite menus. I do sub Italian sausage for the ground beef, I prefer rotini to egg noodles and on the onions I use green onions cut and mixed with the cheese as a topping. The only other mention is you forgot the mushrooms, got to have the mushrooms!

Tried this out and it turned out great!.. I did add my own seasonings to the hamburger (Italian Seasoning, pepper, garlic). My boyfriend doesn't like Pepperoni, So on 1 half I put pepperoni and on the other half ham.. instead of just mozzarella cheese I used pizza blend cheese (mozzarella and American)... it turned out great!!.. loved it!

FANTASTIC Recipe!  Made it early in the morning yesterday and baked for dinner.  Here are my changes if anyone is interested.  Used 1lb. of hot Italian sausage, turkey pepperoni and low fat Italian cheese blend, otherwise followed the recipe step by step.

This recipe is so awesome that it can be served to the guests with a side of salad and crusty Italian bread, oh and a few glasses of Chianti.

Melissa, thank you so much for sharing your love of cooking with us all.

I made this recipe for my family cuz they love meats and red sauce. Me myself I'm not a fan of either but I was surprised on how good this was. I would reconmen making enough for left overs. Stuff like this  taste better reheated. The only subs I made was italian sauage, spiral noodles, two layers of cheese all after reading reviews. I also added parm sprinkle cheese over the cheese layer cuz I love it. I would make it again its a happy medium for me and my family.

Made this several times and we all enjoyed it.  A quick and easy recipe.  The pizza sauce really makes it so don't substitute for pasta sauce. VDries out quickly so I wouldn't save it for another day unless you were putting more sauce in it.

Used  organic  hot Italian sausage, red peppers, onions, garlic and sauce. Drained any grease. Doubled the veggies and garlic and sauce. Used turkey pepperoni.Subbed the egg noodles w/organic Riccioli pasta and topped w/organic fresh mozzarella and asiago, parm and fontina cheese. Threw the whole thing in from the start with cheese on top. AMAZING !!!

Pretty good.  I used the spiral noodles, way more pizza sause than called for (maybe twice as much), half ground beef, half italian sausage.  Added my own spices of course.  I thought the splash of milk was a strange addition but it worked.  This is a good recipe for when you want a lot of food for a relatively low cost, and minimal preparation.  I'll make this again but it wasn't just over the top great for us!

This was really good. Made it with all ground Italian sausage and penne as it's all I had. I think the sausage makes it taste more like pizza (at least the kind I eat!). I mixed the cheese throughout and added a mixture of Colby Jack and mozzarella at the end. Also added some red pepper for a tiny kick. My daughter said it tastes like the pizza topping that falls off. Yummy.

This has been one of my favorite recipes from the site, which shocked me because my expectations were low. It was just totally delicious and satisfying. It really did taste like pizza. I did the half ground beef/half hot Italian sausage and used rotini instead of egg noodles, but otherwise made as directed. When serving I added a little drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some freshly grated parm. When I make this again I may add a small can of Italian-style crushed tomatoes.

I read the reviews saying it was bland so I tweaked this recipe a little. First, I used rotini, like in the picture, instead of egg noodles. While cooking the meat I added garlic powder, pepper, seasoning salt, Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper. I also added a this layer of cheese to the bottom of the dish before I put the mixture in. I also put extra cheese on top and layered some pepperoni on top, like one of the other reviewers suggested. Less to say it was absolutely delicious and we will be making this again.

Very good. I added mushrooms and some pepper flakes to make it more like a pizza. However, this needs just a bit more sauce. I'll probably add a jar and a half next time because this was fairly dry. I also might try mixing cheese into the casserole to make it moister. Otherwise, this will be made again for sure!

I made a very similar version of this recipe for freezer dinners and  it was a huge success with the whole family.  You can add or subtract what meats/veggies you like or don't like. In my instance, I cooked the meat and veggies beforehand and cooled before assembling. Just remember to take it out of the freezer and place in the refrigerator the night before and you have a great go to meal.  Beats fast food any time.

Love Love LOVE IT! I made it tonight and I'm typing this as I'm trying to savor my serving. I could eat the whole pan. I tweaked it a teeny bit. I added mild italian sausage and didn't use any milk, I didn't see any need for the milk. I layered the cheese and pepperoni on top like a regular pizza. I think the brand of pizza sauce makes all the difference for the people that said it was bland. I used Classico Traditional Pizza Sauce which was delicious on it's own and seasoned my meat before adding it in with everything else. The kids gobbled it up like it was their last meal which is amazing because they don't normally eat pepperoni pizza but they were licking their bowls by the end of it lol. Two thumbs up, 10 stars, so many possibilities!

The kids love it!  I have to admit that I cheated and made it easier due to my laziness.  I added minced garlic to the noodles as they boiled, which were rigotoni.  I used the prepackaged hormel sausage and hamburger pizza topping. Put both bags in.  I also mixed a cup of mozerella in with the pasta, and put another cup on top.  Skipped the bell peppers as the kids don't care for them.
So I basically skipped the skillet step and mixed everything together in the casserole dish.  I also added about a teaspoon of pizza seasoning.

Great recipe thanks for sharing....

this truly was a magical dish that my whole family enjoyed! the bell peppers add a nice sweetness and some crunch. and the onions add a salty seasoned taste. overall a really great dish that I'm probably going to make again! the only comment I have is; I added pepper and salt to the sauce and I sautéed the veggies in olive oil. also I made mine vegitarian and it's still wonderful.

Followed the recipe as written with the exception of using pre-packaged miniature pepperoni. Everyone loved it and my boyfriend asks for it weekly. We do prefer a bit more cheese, though.

Amazing! I didn't think we'd like this, me especially because of the green bell peppers. But this was wonderful and we both loved it. I can't wait to try it again. My husband wants to change the pepperoni sausage to just pepperoni pieces and the beef to pizza sausage as an experiment. Either way, this was amazing.

Quick and easy to make. I don't care much for pepperoni but it was good in this dish.  This would be good to bring to a "pot luck" dinner.

I'm 17 years old and love to try new recipes for my parents and brother to try. Considering my little brother is VERY picky, I decides to try something that involves something he loves...pizza. I made this for lunch today and it tastes AMAZING. I actually made an account just to rate it. I did end up using a pound of ground beef instead of half and leaving out the green pepper though. I also made garlic bread to go along with it. I would definitely recommend this and I will be making it again.

My mother used to make this all the time growing up and we loved it! The differences are I use Rotini noodles instead of egg noodles as egg noodles have to soft and soggy of a texture for my taste in this sort of recipe. I also add a half jar of spaghetti sauce, whatever flavor I feel at the time because it seemed too dry without it. I also omit the peppers because my hubby doesn't like them. And I add cheese to the casserole mix with all the other ingredients before baking it. Goes great with a side of garlic bread or toast!

I'm always skeptical of pizza-flavored pasta, but this was the best one. Everyone loved it, and it was easy! I deviated slightly from the recipe: I used some leftover ground venison that had taco seasoning in it, I used a whole jar of marinara sauce, pre-sliced pepperoni (easy) and I grated some cheddar cheese in addition to the mozzarella. Yum!

I don't normally deviate from recipes, particularly not ones that are this popular.  I made this as written.....until right before I baked it. I took a cue from Chef John's mac & cheese. The part of that dish I received the most compliments on was the bread crumb topping, so I added one to this dish.  I melted butter and added Italian style bread crumbs, then sprinkled them on top over the shredded cheese.  Now it has a pizza crust!  I know I will make this recipe again and again!

Yummy and tasty. I used Fontina because I didn't realize I was out of mozzarella. I also added a sprinkling of Parmesan.

This was very easy and very tasty.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used spiral noodles because I don't like egg noodles.  I also added mushrooms since we love them on our pizza.  I also didn't put in the milk.  Didn't have it on hand and didn't see why I needed it.  Even the leftovers were very good, maybe even better since the flavors had time to meld together.  Definitely will make it again.

Thank you Melissa, a wonderful recipe. Yes, the pizza sauce makes a difference. Got mine from Whole Foods, their own sauce that they make, and cheese, cheese, cheese. Will make again, thanks again! :O)

Good base recipe that can be added to based on preference. Mixed in grated parmasan and mozarella cheese along with black olives. Topped with turkey pepperoni in addition to cheese. Also used half ground beef and half spicy italian turkey sausage instead of just ground beef. Must have missed the 16 oz pizza sauce when reading the recipe and used a 24 oz jar of pasta sauce instead. It was perfect and not dry as mentioned in a few reviews.

I love this recipe!  It's a touch more labour-intensive than one might initially think, but it makes for a great "I have no idea what to make" Sunday evening dinner.

***Update*** I have been making this recipe regularly for some time now, and to be honest I have no idea why I initially thought it was labour-intensive.  It's actually super easy!  I use a stove-to-oven dish, which makes this basically a one-pot meal (except for cooking the noodles).  A favorite for me and my husband!

We made this last week and my kids and mother loved it. I accidentally bought different noodles (wide egg noodles) but didn't affect it at all. Will definitely make it again.

Used Italian Sausage instead of beef and also used the bite size pepperoni the dish was amazing. Didn't have to bake it, I kept it warm on the stove dished it up and sprinkled the cheese on top that was a little prettier presentation. Over all good recipe.

I tried this recipe and it was fabulous!  My son fell in love with it so I will definetely be cooking it again.  I added feta along with the mozzarella and just added some pepper.  YUMMY!  Also, the recipe says egg noodles but the pic has the rigotini noodles which makes this recipe so good.

I used mini pepperoni instead of the larger sliced pepperoni. I also mixed in 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of heavy cream (in place of 4 tablespoons of milk). Last I topped casserole with 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese. It turned out wonderfully! It was very delicious!

Good, easy recipe for a quick week-night dinner. I added extra seasoning to the ground beef (garlic powder, oregano etc.) Otherwise, I followed the recipe - egg noodles are surprisingly good with this dish. A simple, easy family pleaser. I served with garlic bread.

I found that this recipe was bland.  I followed the recipe with the exception that I added ham instead of ground beef.  I also added more sauce because it was way to dry.  Maybe adding spices to the pizza sauce like others have suggested would've made a difference.

Very good! My family thought this was different and good. I did use rotini pasta as a peference, and used turkey perpperoni. Next time, I plan on using ground italian sausage instead of ground beef. The beef didn't give it a "pizza" flavor, but I think with ground italian sausage, this will most definitely be 5 stars.

This is definitely edible.  It just doesn't taste at all like pizza and wasn't real impressive.  I like most the things I cook to Wow my husband or whoever I cook for.  This was just...ehh.

I also saw that this was going to be bland so I added spices. However when I opened this up and baked it, it was extremely dry. It needs way more sauce.

Whole family loved it. Didn't have mozzarella, so I used cheddar (put an extra layer of cheese in the middle). Didn't have pizza sauce so I used a jar of Classico Four Cheese pasta sauce. Didn't have egg noodles, used rotini. Instead of pepperoni, I used calabrese salami. After frying up the ground beef, onions, garlic and peppers, added a bit of water and a beef boullion cube for extra favour, let it simmer for a while. Also added some black pepper. Really good!

Just made this..substituted with ground turkey and turkey pepperoni and added mushrooms..I expect it may be a little bland because of that but it'll be a little healthier and hopefully a favorite. Only gave it three stars 'till I'm sure it's good. :)

Delicious but made a few changes. Don't like peppers on pizza so added fresh mushrooms and a full pound of hamburg. After mixing the noodles and sauce together I added some mozzarella in and put the rest on top.  Everyone are more than they usually do. Great recipe.

I liked this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and added ground pork.  I used Turkey Pepperoni to cut down on the fat since I added the pork.  I followed anothers review and put a layer of cheese between two layers of the sauce/noodles along with the mozzarella on top.  I shared one of the casseroles with family.  I think this would be a good potluck dish.

I just cooked this tonight and my husband loved it! I always read the reviews first before cooking. I made a few changes also, I added 1/2lb of ground beef and 1/2 pound of jimmy dean ground sausage. I then used the spiral noodles. Then I used pizza sauce and 1/2 cup of marianara sauce. I also added a chesse mixture of colby,chedder on the top and more pepperoni on top. I used pre-slice pepperoni too. It was very good!

I liked it but I think I will make a few changes before I try it again.  It was good, but I don't think I used enough sauce so I'll add more when I try it again. It was quick and easy so that's a plus.

Great easy recipe. Made it 3 times. Sorry I never follow directions exactly but I really never strayed far on this one. I just dont always measure exactly. Very very good.

Easy and yummy weeknight dinner!  Followed exactly as written (even with egg noodles b/c I happened to have them on hand) and I don't think it needed anything else except maybe a little extra cheese next time.  I used a "good quality" organic pizza sauce and maybe that helped the flavor compared to some other reviewers who found it bland.  Just as good reheated for leftovers.  Not exactly a dinner party meal, but 5 stars for a solid family dinner!

I made this exactly as directed except left out the green peppers for my kids.  Prior to making I had thought about subbing the pizza sauce for pasta sauce.  Im glad I didn't.  I will definatly make this again.

I make this using mild Italian sausage instead of unseasoned ground beef. As it is, it's a good recipe if you have little ones to feed. If you're feeding an older crowd, try using the sausage because it adds some much needed flavor. Since our favorite pizza is topped with just sausage and mushrooms, I sometimes use mushrooms instead of pepperoni. That works well, too.

I made but used Chef John's homemade pizza sauce recipe only because I'm trying to avoid processed foods /preservatives as much as possible.  I know, I know,  egg noodles, etc.   and his recipe calls for more spices.
Additionally, I put the veggies in the blender with the tomato sauce before mixing with the hamburger.  I also cut into pieces the pepperoni.

I followed the recipe for the most part except I used ground sausage. I loved the egg noodles as the base for it because they don't get in the way of the flavor as thick pastas sometimes do. I used half the cheese to put a layer in the middle. Very easy to make...definitely a keeper!

We love this recipe!  If you make this, you should definitely love pepperoni as it adds a very nice kick. I break the pepperoni into small pieces.  But you could certainly substitute sausage or leave out as desired.  I didn't change one thing and made it exactly as written (which is rare for me).  This has been added to our family menu!

I doubled this recipe and used a 9x13 pan. I used penne and turkey sausage because it was on hand and added black and green olives and a can of mushrooms to make it what I like on pizza. My husband and I both loved this and I'll definitely make it again.

Not much flavor to this dish. I found it very bland. Almost tasted like baked spaghetti. It would make a good kid friendly meal. I'm not sure I understand the overall high rating, but this one was way off.

I made this pretty much as is, but I didnt have any green bell pepper :(  It was good, husband had 2 servings and 3 yr old ate his.  It's definitely a keeper,however, i think I will make this with spaghetti sauce instead of Pizza, and I will probably leave out the pepperoni , lol... thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

This is the best replacement for frozen pizzas that I have found yet. It's quick, easy, cheap, and everyone in my family absolutely loves it! It doesn't hurt that the veggies are snuck in, so no one even notices they're eating bell peppers. ^.~

Really good! We added Pepperoni, Ground Beef (in place of sausage) and sliced Green Bell Pepper- the toppings we normally order on pizza. This is a very versatile recipe and can be suited to any taste preference.   Thanks for posting! Very very good!

Rediculously good!!!  I changed everything to turkey (cause I dont eat beef or pork) and used an entired pack of ground turkey (1 1/4 lbs).. I was worried I would need more sauce, but nope! It was fantastic!!  I also used regular spiral noodles, just cause I had them.  My husband wouldn't shut up about how good this was!!!!!!!!

This was a good on hand cupboard recipes. I felt like it was a little to plain with hamburger, so I added venson sausage for a lower fat meal. and it added more of an Itailan taste!I also added more seasons, such as more Garlic, mushrooms, and some fresh (from my garden) basil.. My kids 2 yr and 6yrs old love it. thanks for an easy weeknight and plenty of leftovers dinner.

Delicious!  My family loved this recipe.  I added some Parmesan cheese to the mixture before baking it, but I think it would have been good without it, too.  (Our local pizza place adds Parmesan to their pizza sauce, so I thought I would try it for this casserole.)

I don't usually like pasta dishes but my family seemed to like this well enough. It seemed a little overwhelming with the vegetables and sauce so I think you could use less of those.

I made a few changes.  I used rotini instead of egg noodles and added sausage.  Honestly, I was underwhelmed.  It reminded me of my dear mothers cooking, which is why I have taken the time to actually learn how to cook.

I love this dish. It's easy to make,tastes great and if there's any left over its just as good. I used rotini pasta instead of noodles. Besides the ground beef I add Italian sausage and fennel seeds.

Very good. I added some cheese to the mixture and then topped it at the end of baking with more cheese. Will be making this one again!

This dish delicious!  My husband, who is generally not a fan of pizza at all, raved over it.  I noticed while I was making it that the photo shows black olives, but the recipe doesn't have them listed.  I had some on hand, so in they went.  Additionally, I didn't have any fresh bell peppers on hand so I threw in some frozen ones and it turned out great.  Besides that, I followed the recipe as written and served it with a green salad for a complete meal.  I'm definitely adding this to my arsenal of go-to dishes.  Next time, I will add some sliced mushrooms as well.  Thank you for a fabulous tasting, quick, easy, recipe. (0=

Good, but added extra sauce and still kind of dry.  DH liked it.  We did not use pepperoni and made our own pizza sauce.  thanks for sharing. Update: made this time with1 pound ground beef, no pepperoni, additional 8 oz tomato sauce with the 14.5 oz pizza sauce, Italian seasonings, and sprinkled taco seasoning over all. Also added can of ranch beans and used penne pasta. Covered to bake. Yummy, and 5 star with these changes

It wasn't very good.  It was very bland.  I usually like Pepperoni on a pizza, just not in this dish.  It didn't mesh well.  It was soft and not crispy like I like.  My husband and two out of three kids did not care for this dish.  I won't be making it again.

It was ok, nothing out of this world.  If I make this again I may use a can of diced tomatoes and toss in some veggies to jazz it up a bit.  I also like the suggestion add some Italian sausage.

This was surprisingly delicious! I chose to skip the pepperoni and went with sausage bits, and mushrooms instead. I also layered mine by putting half the pasta mix on the bottom, then a layer of cheese, then the rest of the pasta. Baked for the required time, added a top layer of cheese for the rest of the cooking time. My family and I loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!!

A delicious recipe, but it needed a little tweaking for my family's taste.  I use a shell-like noodle because they scoop the sauce nicely.  In addition to the beef and pepperoni, I use hot italian sausage to give it some kick.  I also use two jars of sauce and double the cheese.  Finally I use half and half instead of the milk to make it a little creamier.  My husband loves it!!!  The leftovers never go to waste, they just taste better after a day or two!

I doubled the ingredients except for peppers and onions, used Italian mild sausage for the meat, and used 2 cups of shredded Italian cheese blend. My family loved it and so did I. I think this is a keeper!

This was really good as a base recipe.  To make it a little healthier, I swapped ground beef for turkey sausage links that I crumbled up and added fennel seeds and Italian seasoning to that. I also swapped turkey pepperoni for reg pepperoni and added fresh basil to the sauce.  I kept everything else the same.  Delish!

This is a great casserole for a weeknight dinner! Five stars for simplicity and the fact you can adjust ingredients to what you have on hand. I didn't have pizza sauce so i used 2 small cans of tomato paste, 8 oz of tomato sauce and 1 tbsp of sugar to sweeten the sauce. I also doubled the  recipe for my family of 7, and there were no leftovers!

This was delicious! I love pizza and if that's the taste you love, then this is a good casserole. You can add whatever toppings you prefer. My husband did point out that it would have been easier to make a pizza, but I thought it was fun to switch it up.

I used all sausage instead of ground beef in this recipe. I thought it was ok. It is a very easy weeknight meal, but nothing memorable. My husband LOVED it so ill definatly be making it again, but personally I thought it was a little generic.

We loved this recipe.  We did make some changes though, just because we have picky kids.  I had them help me make this so they knew what was all in it.  YUM!  Will make again!!!!
I did 1 box of rotini noodles.  
1 pound of ground beef. 
1 bag of mini pepperoni. 
2 cloves of garlic. 
2 cans of pizza sauce (i think 15oz)
2 cuos of shredded mozzarella

Really good!  A few things I did differntly..*first I had to double the recipe (3 pre-teens, 1-5 year old and 2 adults) I used 4 cans of the sauce (and I used a good one) because I added extra peppers and some mushrooms. It ended up being a great amount..I did put cheese in the center as others advised and added the pepperoni at the end of the meat cooking to cook some grease out.  I also added about a cup more of noodles than in the original recipe and used a total of about 5 cups of cheese.  All in all, the kids said I should make it again all the time.  Hubby loved it too.  I also used "mini" pepperoni and won't next time..I'll use regular size and cut them in half so you can taste them better! Yummy!

Not bad as is.  My hubby says more cheese please (he cannever get enough).  I think when I customize to what my family likes, it is going to be great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought it was pretty good, nice change from spag. I also did some changes. I added mushrooms and going to add olives next time. I only used a half green pepper and half onion because of acid reflex. I couldn't find a large container or pizza sauce so I used spag. instead. I'm going to try the pizza sauce this time. Also very simple to make. I was able to bowl the noddles and mix together and put in the oven and work outwhile it was in the oven.

Very good!  I used ziti pasta, added mushrooms because we all love them in our pizza.  This recipe can be so versatile like your choice of pizza topping.

Made this with a few changes and it was amazing.  Instead of using the egg noodles, I used lasagna noodles, layered the meat mix and cheese and baked it as a pizza lasagna.  I also was able to add mushrooms and black olives to only half to support picky eaters.  Great recipe that i'll be making again.

This was very easy and delicious to make.  It is great as it is, but I did add a dash of Italian Seasoning and Crushed Red Pepper over the top of the cheese and also made it with some sliced baby Portobella mushrooms.  This is like eating pizza but healthier!

I thought this was really good.  I thought my husband who LOVES pizza and could eat it every day would just love it too, but he didn't really... He just thought it was weird when it looked like a regular "spaghetti sauce pasta dish" but tasted different.  He wasn't digging it.  My kids and I loved it though!

This was really tasty. My husband even thought it was delicious. I did change a few things though. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and turkey pepperoni instead of regular pepperoni. We will definitely be making this again!

Great...easy, versatile and super quick to throw together!  I cut this recipe in half, using ground turkey instead of ground beef, along with turkey pepperoni and red bell pepper (no green in the fridge).  I also used elbow macaroni as I had some cooked already.  Boys gobbled this up, love that you can mix and match pretty much any add ins to customize!  Thanks for sharing this one!

I loved this casserole!!! I added a whole can of pasta cause because my family loves pasta sauce!!! I didn't have any pizza sauce so I added a tomatoes and herb pasta sauce and it turned out really good! I also used turkey pepperoni instead of regular pepperoni and whole wheat egg noodles with soy milk to cut some of the calories!!! I will be making this again :)

This was really good!  I didn't have pizza sauce so I just used spaghetti sauce and left out the milk.  I also did what others' suggested and put a layer of cheese between two layers and cheese on top.  I also added mushrooms.  Put the whole thing in a 9x13 pan and baked in the oven for 25 minutes.  Very good comfort food!

A fun casserole.  I used whole grain penne, left out the ground beef and added black olives, mushrooms and extra mozzarella.  As suggested by others, red pepper flakes would be tasty, too.

Made a couple of changes just b/c I used what I had on hand.

Pasta sauce instead of pizza sauce, Rotini instead of egg noodles, and mushrooms instead of green pepper.  It was very good.

Also, this dish freezes very well.

I should rate this since I make it all the time. Everyone in the house loves it, and it's so easy to make.  I usually add mushrooms too, but you can add anything you like and it's still tasty.

Great casserole recipe - I had almost no leftovers!  I added in mushrooms, olives and crushed red pepper flakes because we love spice.  I also baked it for twice as long, stirring it half way, to get rid of some of the excess moisture due to the extra veggies I added in.  It was very yummy - will definitely make this again!!

Added a little garlic powder to the meat while it cooked for a little more flavor. And my boyfriend LOVES pepperoni so I added more. It was very good and he LOVED it!

This is great!!! I used turkey pepperoni and ground turkey instead of lean meat. I also added some hot Italian sausage ground up. Next time I will leave out the ground turkey add extra ground hot italian sausage. I had to use spaghetti sauce because I didn't have pizza sauce. I used a full jar of sauce but that is just personal preference. Very additive, everyone loved it and we all over ate.

Excellent! Followed recipe exactly, and added a small jar of sliced mushrooms with a little extra cheese. Very good flavor, from the combination of ingredients! Thanks!

Yummy and forgiving...you can really play around with your "toppings" to fit your families tastes and what you have on hand.  Everyone, including my picky preschooler enjoyed it. :)

I love how quick and easy this is. I left out the beef and pepperoni b/c I'm vegetarian and just used more veggies (including some mushrooms). Everything else I kept the same.  It's a great casserole that you can change up to suit different tastes.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent, but I think it would be better with the addition of a little Italian seasoning, a little extra sauce, some fresh mushrooms and olives.

This was a delicious, quick casserole!  Followed directions as written, but did cover lightly during first bake so as not to dry out the dish.  I'll be making this often!

I liked this as written, and also love how easily customized it is! I DID find the pepperoni to be a bit much at 1c, it's overpowering for me. (If you are one to snack on it plain b/c you LOVE IT, keep it at 1c.) I used a little more onion and 3 cloves fresh garlic. Next time I'm going to use 3 c egg noodles so the ingredients will go farther as far as multiple servings; the flavors in this dish are so strong I don't think it will hurt a bit!.

Instant favorite!  I love this dish.  Add whatever pizza toppings you like and follow the directions and you will end up with a dish everyone will enjoy.  My favorite additions to this recipe are double cheese and a can of black olives!  I try to use healthy substitute items wherever I can since it is so good and I want to make it often and guilt free.  Definitely satisfies any craving for pizza!

This was so yummy!!! The only things I did differently was place a layer a mozzarella cheese in the middle and I used elbow noodles instead of egg noodles. I also covered the dish in aluminum foil then took it off for the last 10 minutes so the cheese could get bubbly and melt. Will definitely be making this many more times!!

Great base to make a delicious dinner from! Used the Exquisite Pizza sauce recipe from this site and added a little jarred just to use it up--thought about all of my favorite pizza toppings and went with a Super-Supreme-added finely diced and sauteed (to eliminate grease), fresh mushrooms, black olives, and green pepper. Sauteed the onions and garlic with the veggies and just added pizza seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder to the hamburger as it browned. Tossed in a little Parmesan and baked. Really, really good dinner!

Delicious! I made this recipe last night for my 2 teenage boys and husband. I used extra noodles and the entire dish was GONE!  It took little time to prepare, just toss together and throw in the oven. This is a great weeknight dinner.

Omg!! This is so worthy of five stars. So yummmyy. The fam loved it. There was no leftovers. I didn't change a thing except I threw in garlic powder instead of the cloves, and added a little more pepperoni. Soo good. Simple too. Can't wait to make it again!!!

The kids really like this.  I add mushrooms, black olives, a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes (drained) and use 1/4 lb. italian sausage and 1/4 lb. gr. beef.  Turns out pretty well.

Yum Yum! This recipe is great! I layered 1 cup of cheese halfway through the casserole and topped it with another cup. I also added 1 can of drained, sliced mushrooms. Even our picky eater ate it, all but the green pepper.

This was tasty!  I know I have a winner recipe on my hands when my toddler can't have enough!  My husband went back for seconds, so that's another compliment.  I swapped a few things to my liking and with what I had on hand.  I used elbow macaroni and I had almost exactly 1 cup of Mexican blend cheese left that I needed to use up.  Delish.  I decided to skip on the ground beef because we don't like it on pizzas and it doesn't add much flavor unseasoned anyway.  We prefer sweet italian sausage on our pizza, so next time I get my hands on those I may put those in instead.  Also, I got a great idea from my husband because I told him I had a problem with the pepperoni sticking together as I mixed everything and he said layer it like a lasagna.  I will definitely try that next time!  Last thing, I got carried away having fun doing this and I added the cheese before baking it, lol, but no worries.  If you have this problem, just put some aluminum foil over the pasta, cook the 20 minutes, uncover then cook for the 5 minutes extra and it's just fine.  Thanks for the recipe Melissa!

Didn't like it. Made it exactly as stated but added a small can of mushrooms and red bell pepper instead of green. I added an extra layer of cheese in the middle.

I think I would prefer this with regular rotini to the egg noodles but it was good and the kids ate it up. We did make it with the egg noodles and everything else as directions but next time I think we will change it up a bit. Thanks for the recipe.

Before my family finished their first serving of this, they were asking me to make it again! Next time however, I will skip the ground beef and use Italian sausage instead, add more cheese to the center of the dish as others have suggested, and make my own pizza sauce (store bought is too expensive for me). I will also add some of our favorite toppings and change the egg noodles to rotini. Great family meal, will be using again and again.

These were a crowd pleaser! You can't complain with this recipe because everyone loves the taste of pizza. I liked the fact that it can be prepped ahead of time when you're going to be in a rush mode. Just throw it in the oven later or the next day. I had used 9x13 baking pan and doubled the recipe except the sauce (daughter liked a thinner coating), pepperoni (cut in quarters), and onions; did not have bell peppers but it's still tasted wonderful without them.

The casserole is pretty good.  I added some mushrooms which we loved.  I also put in more meat and used pre sliced pepperoni.  I needed to add some kick after tasting it so added some crushed red pepper.  I will season the meat more next time.

I make this all the time! In order to make it healthier, I use lean ground turkey instead of beef and turkey pepperonis.  I also season with pizza seasoning, oregano, basil, and garlic powder. The ingredients are interchangeable-just use your fave pizza toppings! Chicken, mushrooms, and artichokes also work well.

AMAZING DISH!!! i made this for my boyfriend and he loved it!! I just altered the recipe a little bit. I used rotini noodles instead (i highly recommend!), 1 pound of italian sausage instead of beef, no onion or green peppers, 1 can of sliced mushrooms, garlic, milk, quartered turkey pepperoni (its much healthier!),  28oz of Ragu Pizza Quick Sauce (sounds like a lot, but my boyfriend and I thought it was necessary), and 4 cups of shredded cheese with one layer in the middle and one on top. But thats just my alteration! Take what you want from it!

This is absolutely delicious. My husband LOVES it and he is a fairly picky eater. I use 1-lb of lean (93/7) ground beef because he likes it meaty. I also put one layer of the pizza mix in a 9X13 dish, put a layer of mozzarella on top, then another layer of the pizza mix and bake it that way. Before it's done, I add some more mozzarella cheese to the top and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes. You can also add red pepper flakes to it if you like a little spice!

This was enjoyed by my whole family.  I used rotini, like the picture shows, instead of egg noodles.  My only suggestion is to cover it with foil to avoid getting crusty noodles on the top.

My family raved about this dish. The egg noodles add crust-like flavor. I added more cheese than it calls for and used not only mozzarella but cheddar as well.  I also added olives and mushrooms. That's what's so great about this recipe, you can add nearly whatever you would put on a pizza...to your liking! Fantastic recipe submission Melissa!

I modify this recipe by using pasta sauce instead of pizza sauce, and using regular pasta, either penne or spiral, and cooking it about 3/4 of the way.  This is an easy great recipe and makes great leftovers.

I didn't tell my husband  this was called pizza pasta, I just told the family we were having pasta for dinner.  Well after tasting it my husband said this tastes just like that deep dish pizza we get!  The family loved it and I will definitely be making this again.  I served it with bread sticks that the kids joked were "crust".

4.5 stars as written, 5 stars with my own modifications.  I used 1/2 lb. Italian sausage instead of hamburger and added in lots of dried basil (wishing I'd had fresh!).  I also subbed ziti for egg noodles, since it holds up better to heavy dishes.  I used 1 lb. ziti pasta.  Next time, I will add mushrooms and black olives, too!

a favorite for my kids.  I am asked to make it every week and any leftovers are gone in a day or two.  I have put some black olives in and cut down on the green pepper as it disturbs my tummy.  Whatever you put on a pizza would probably work in this dish

We added some canned mushrooms and olives to the hamburger mix as a substitute for peppers and onions. Also added a few spices to the pan, italian seasoning, onion salt, etc.

Love this one! Tried it for the first time cuz I wanted something different and it was great. My husband was skeptical at first but he likes it more than I do. Very good recipe and easy to follow.

This is a big hit at my house. There are never any leftovers! I was surprised to see that it only requires 2 cups of noodles, but it is really all that is needed. I followed the recipe to a T and everything turned out wonderful. Thanks for a great, fast, family meal!

It was okay, not a big winner at our house.  A little bland and too much pepperoni.  If I make again, I will just adjust a little bit.  I try to make all the recipes as written the first time.

My husband loved this casserole, and he usually hates casseroles!  I made only a couple minor changes: I used only a half onion instead of a whole one, and didn't use sausage.  Great recipe!

Overall, we liked the dish. The edges seemed a bit bland but it might just be that it needs more pizza sauce than the recipe calls for. I used an Italian 6-cheese blend (mozzarella, parmesan, asiago, romano, fontina, provolone) instead of just mozzarella and also used more because we like cheese a lot. I mixed a big helping of cheese in with the pasta and put the rest on top of the dish. Also quartered some of the pepperoni and browned it together with the ground beef and 3 gloves of garlic. I used Italian seasoning. Will definitely make it again, only next time use more sauce.

I made this for my boyfriend's work lunches.  He LOVED it.  I doubled everything and tripled the cheese and noodles.  I added half the cheese to the mixture and topped it with the rest during the second baking step.  I added two small cans of mushrooms and a small can of sliced black olives.  I skipped the milk because I didn't see the purpose.  I used the diced pre-cooked pepperoni in a bag and baked everything in a 9x13 glass pan.

I was looking for a good 'base' recipe for pizza casserole, and this is it!! I followed the recipe as written, but added sausage, mushrooms, extra pepperoni, extra sauce, and olives per my families taste. PERFECT and easy recipe that made great leftovers and packed an awesome lunch!

This was pretty good! Here's what I did: I browned 1 lb. ground beef in the skillet, along with pepperoni slices that I quartered. Once nice & brown, drained the skillet,put the meat back in,  added in 1 tsp. olive oil and chopped onion, 1 tbsp. dried oregano,1 tbsp. red pepper flakes, kosher salt to taste, 1 tsp. ground black pepper,  and 4 cloves of chopped garlic. Let that sautee a few minutes. Then, I stirred in 16 oz. of jarred Ragu Pizza Quik. Mixed well and let it simmer while I cooked the pasta. Once pasta was done, I drained it and added it to the skillet with the pizza mixture. Added in 4 tbsp. of milk and stirred again. In my baking dish, I put half the pasta/meat mixture, a generous helping of Kraft pizza style shredded cheese, and then added the rest of the pasta/meat mixture. I topped with another generous helping of mozaarella, and then topped it with whole pepperoni slices. Finally, I took a block of romano and lightly grated it over the pepperoni. Baked for 30 minutes til bubbly and brown and it was very tasty.

Great recipe and super easy to to add new things =)!! Instead of egg noodles I used whole wheat corckscrew pasta and tossed in a little bit of e.v.o.o. Then instead of hamburger meat i used johnsville italian sausage ready for recipes (its without the casings like hamburger meat but its the italain sausage). Garlic, Onion and some diced tomatoes sauteed with the meat then i added the pepperoni and some cooked bacon pieces =) delicious!!! Also, instead of pizza pizza sauce i used margherita sauce. Before baking I mixed in parm cheese and some crushed red pepper and topped with mozz. montery jack, and some more parm. Came out so great!! Def will make again and can add whatever else =)Thanks so so much!!

I didn't have pepporoni in the house, and for sausage I used sausage links cut up, as that is all I had on hand. I used wheat noodles, and was a little nervous about them cooking properly, but they turned out well done, after like 45 minutes. I added green pepper, onion, and cherry tomatoes cut in half.  It was pretty good, but I think next time I would decrease the pepper and onion and maybe use ground beef rather than the sausage, as it was a bit heartburn-producing.

A very fun and great casserole. I used low fat turkey pepperoni sausage instead of regular. Also substituted ground turkey for beef. Turned out fantastic and a little healthier. It's a favorite, esp. for my husband who could eat pizza everyday if possible :)

Loved it! Didn't bake it, just assembled all the ingredients over the stove top, topped with cheese and ate! Delicious!  I used turkey instead of hamburger, and added a Tablespoon each of Italian Seasoning and olive oil when cooking the turkey. I also added an additional jar of spagetti sauce (it didn't seem to have enough sauce otherwise).

This is tasty, a big hit with the kids, I added fresh basil and roma tomatoes. I also added a LOT more spices and doubled the cheese, I added a layer of mozzarella in the center.. I will make this again, feeds all 3 of my boys and my husband with left overs.. that is unheard of in my house.

Yummy! What an easy and amazing recipe to make! I love the flavour the pepporoni added to this. I added mushrooms and sliced green olives as those are my favourite ingredients on a pizza. A+++ I can't wait to get home tonight to eat my leftovers.

This is a good recipe as written.  I adapted it by changing from pepperoni to Italian sausage, red onion, and kept the green pepper.  I cooked these up in a skillet and added some garlic and some oregano and crushed red pepper.  I used a 1lb can of spaghetti sauce and rotini pasta.  Finally I took a package of Italian cheeses and mixed half the bag in the casserole and baked for 30 minutes.  Then remove from the oven and stir, otherwise the pasta on top has a tendency to not cook and be crunchy.  Cook for another 30 minutes.  Top with remaining cheese and cook until cheese is melted about 10 minutes.

I don't know why, but I was so shocked at how awesome this recipe is. It was soo yummy. I also put mushrooms in mine which gave it even more pizza flavor. I also substituted turkey pepperoni and Italian turkey sausage for a more low cal. So totally de-lish!

Really did not care for this recipe.  It was very heavy and it seemed like it needed alot of tweaking to give it more flavor.  Doesn't seem worth even messing with again.

This is a great recipe if you need something delicious and quick. I had everything on hand. It tastes great the next day, and is very filling.  I used chunky mushroom ragu sauce instead. It was pretty good but it probably could have used a bit of a kick to the sauce. Overall, it was good and I will be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing.

I followed this recipe exactly except I used Gemelli pasta instead of egg noodles and I made my own pizza sauce, but I'm sure the flavor was still the same.  My boyfriend wolfed it down and my friend asked me to email her the recipe.  Thanks Melissa!  We loved it!

I found it to be a little bit bland. Next time I will add more sauce with more spices.

This was a very good recipe! I, like another reviewer, thought it looked too simple, but it's really very good!   I am watching what I eat so I changed it up to make it lower fat: I used extra lean ground beef, and turkey pepperoni, skim instead of regular milk, and low fat cheese.  I also had a jar of 14 oz pizza sauce so I added an undrained can of italian diced tomatoes I had on hand.   I think this would also be very good if the lean beef was substituted with an italian turkey sausage, crumbled up. But it's very good as is.

This recipe was Great.  I did add a little to it.  I used 1 pound lean ground beef, 1 jimmy dean sage flavor sausage. I used 2 green peppers, 1 large onion, I also added Italian Seasoning, 2 cloves minced garlic and pepper.  I browned all together, then drained.  For Pasta I used a mixture of Rotini and Piccolini (mini wheels)for my little guy. I also added 3 jars 14 ounce each of pizza sauce, 1 whole bag of pepperoni, and 8 tablespoons of milk.  After mixing all ingredients together, I put it into a 13x9 pan.  I sprayed with pam, for easy cleanup.  I put into oven for 25-30 minutes, then added 3 cups of pizza cheese and parmesan cheese.  I kept it in until the cheese was a little brown.  I removed from oven and let set for 10 minutes. I had mushrooms, black olives, and extra fixins on the side so my family could add what they liked. My hubby and toddler loved it.  I made enough for tomorrows dinner.  This is a great dish to do that with, especially with a busy day ahead.

This was good--I'd make it again.  A good week night meal for the family.  I did add a can of mushrooms and used rotini noodles instead of egg noodles.  Also mixed about a cup of cheese in the casserole and then added another cup on top during the last ten minutes of baking.

This was a great crowd pleasing recipe!  I only made a few alterations for myself.  I added 1 1/2 14oz jars of pizza sauce and covered the top with more than just 1 cup of cheese. I also used 4 T of minced garlic instead of chopping it on my own (to save on prep time) and I cut whole pepperonis(great addition to the recipe) into 4ths instead of using the sausage. KIDS AND HUSBANDS WILL LOVE THIS DISH!

Very good, very good flavor. I used only half the onion & green pepper but I couldve used it all. I'll do more egg noodles next time & maybe some italian sausage. Some parmesan cheese. Very good, easy recipe.

This is a really good recipe.  I also cut up pepperoni slices some other reviewers did and I added extra cheese.  Very delicious.  My 5 year old daughter and 7 year old niece loved it.  This will become a staple at my house.  Could easily make ahead of time and refrigerate until ready to cook.

My tip:  Use TURKEY PEPPERONI to cut down on the fat and grease but not the flavor. Easy, tasty casserole that heats well.

Good casserole.I made this in the morning before work. I used elbow macaroni.[had on hand] But I used three cups of noodles [wanted left overs for my husbands lunch] and a 26 oz. jar of spagetti sauce. Plus 1 laddle of pasta water. If I don't add a little more water to my noodle dishes that sit a little while, and then bake, they aren't very saucey when I take them out of the oven. This seems to work for me. I might try one reveiwers idea next time with using Italian sausage. Also cooked the pepperoni a little bit before adding it to the mixture; just to get some of the grease out of it.

I made the recipe exactly as directed and it came out wonderful!  I sent the recipe to my brother and he not only made it and loved it but made it look delectable.  I am making it again tonight and am going to add some Italian sausage as that's one of my favorites on pizza.  This recipe is DEFINITELY going to be a repeat performance!

Better than expected.  Big hit with my 2-year old who asked for more!  Follow recipe as written but used ground chicken instead of beef because that is all I had. Used only half the amount of pasta.

Really good!  I have two picky eating children and they loved it.  It's simple to make and you can throw in whatever normal 'pizza' toppings you have handy.  I definitely agree  with a previous review.. a GOOD quality pizza sauce is a must have!

This recipe is good AS IS. I can't stand it when people review recipes with the changes they made. It's quick, easy and delicious. Me and my hubby both loved it.  It's a great family recipe. Just remember the recipe call for measured uncooked pasta. I'll be making this again.

Only ok, although it probably would have been better with a different pizza sauce.  I did follow the recipe exactly.

This was delicious!  I started to leave out the onions & green pepper because my husband & son don't like them, but I included them anyway. (And they did not say a word.) I did not put as much as the recipe required, but it still was good.  Because my husband loves "meat lovers pizza", I used  a pound of ground turkey instead of 1/2lbs.  I seasoned the turkey with a little seasoning salt, pepper & Italian spices.  I also, as other reviews did, used spiral noodles and added much more cheese!  I am looking forward to eating this again.

Great taste and quick to make.  Tried it in a crockpot, it came out great.  I did not add enough fluid so it came out a little dry.  Will try again and add more sauce to make it a little bit more gooey like a hot cheesey pizza.  I can't wait!

This was good. I like how versatile it can be. If you have individual sized baking dishes, everyone can have their own favorite pizza casserole. I will be making this again with different 'toppings' for fun.

This is my first time rating a recipe.  Wow, this recipe was great.  I made it for a church potluck.  It was easy, tasty and a big hit. On the way home my husband asked me if I would make another pan for his co-workers.  I followed the recipe exactly just substituted the eggs noodles with spiral noodles and cut the pepperoni slices into quarters.  Definitely a keeper.

My family of six loved it.  I didn't think my kids would eat it with bell pepper but they did.  I think next time I will add a little more sauce and mix some cheese throughout.  The kids all said MORE CHEESE!

We found this average for a casserole.  The kids loved the pepperoni and wanted lots more of that, but weren't so fond of the rest of it.

This is one of the best recipes I've made.  It was really, really good!  I added tons of cheese and placed more pepperoni on the very top so it looked like a real pizza. My husband and son LOVED it! We also used ground turkey and it was still great!

Very good. We only used our favorite pizza toppings and I think it worked well. We're picky eaters, but we loved this and didn't even have any left overs! Will make this again soon.

I used penne noodles instead of egg noodles and a combination of canadian bacon and pepperoni.  My husband doesn't like peppers and onions, so I used onion powder, and omitted the peppers altogether.  It was very, very good!

This was very good. I used rotini noodles. For extra creaminess and flavor complexity I added 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup. To make enough sauce for 1 box of noodles I doubled the sauce and cheese but kept the same amount of meat ingredients. Thank you!

Great recipe for a busy night.  Modified slightly by using 1 lb. Cavetelli shaped pasta, 1 lb italian sweet sausage in place of the ground beef, 1 1/2 jars pizza sauce and topped with a blend of mozzeralla, parmesan, provolone and asiago cheese. To reduce the number of dishes to wash, cook your pasta in a dutch oven, and mix and bake in same pot.    Looking forward to trying again and making more modifications. Like pizza, great to adapt to your favorite ingredients.

Yum!  I doubled the cheese and garlic because my husband and I love both... I used pepperoni slices and quartered them but I think next time I will use Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Great recipe, add your favorite toppings and you'll love it too!

Very tasty -but pretty expensive to make, in my opinion. I doubled the amount of pizza sauce and used one pound of italian sausage.  I probably won't make it again - just because of the cost and my kids didn't eat it.

made this with macaroni instead and it came out pretty good.  There's not enough flavor in the pizza sauce that comes in a jar so if you're going to try this recipe I suggest you add more italian spices.

I made this tonite and it was really good.  Kind of a shortcut lasagna, in a way.  I used nearly 4 cups (dry measure) egg noodles-I used the twisty shaped ones.  I also added some more sauce, and it was a zesty/spicy variety.  In addition, I doubled the cheese and mixed half of it within the pasta/sauce/meat mix and put the other half on top.  I sliced up 7 brown mushrooms and sauteed them before adding to the mix.  I put everything in a 9X13 glass pan and baked.  Very good.  I can see how some people thought it was bland, but thanks to the zesty spicy tomato sauce I used, mine was quite flavorful.  I might add green peppers next time, but otherwise, it was plenty meaty with the ground beef and pepperoni slices.  Perfect for a cold nite!

Not so crazy about it.  I ended up having to add twice the pizza sauce and twice the cheese to make it work.  Kind of bland, but that's just my personal taste.  Was quick and easy though!

This was a super huge hit with my family.  My husband even raved about this dish to his mother. I did use Penne pasta instead of the egg noodles.  Loved it!!!

This came out good but I felt something missing.  I might omit the green bellpepper next time and add more cheese.  My husband added franks hot sauce and it was really tasty.  Overall good recipe.  Thanks.

We made this for dinner tonight, and it was a big hit! Since we are watching our carb intake, we used the low-carb pasta. Also, we decided to use sausage in place of the ground beef and we added finely-chopped mushrooms and sliced black olives. I'm sure that this won't be the last time we use this recipe! Thanks!

This was so easy and to my surprise tasted amazing!! The only thing I did different was add 1/2 cup parmesean to the mix and I used a mexican blend shredded cheese, since I had that on hand. Next time I will try adding mushroom and black olives to make it like a supreme but this is great just as is, will definately make again when crunched on time.

Great Dish! I swapped the ground beef for shredded chicken, as I already had that thawed when I came across this recipe. I made my own sauce, and added basil & oregano. I diced the pepperoni before adding to the mix. Next time I plan to make with a ground beef/sausage mixture. My kids gave this 5 stars! Thanks for sharing.

Pretty darn good stuff!  I did make some changes to what I had at home.  I used macaroni rather than egg noodles and boiled them first, sausage rather than ground beef, no bell pepper and cheddar cheese.  I also added parmisan cheese to the mix.  Turned out great!  I made this again last night.  I added mushrooms, chopped fresh banana pepper and chunks of fresh tomatoes.  Wonderful!!

I subbed black olives for the green pepper because that is what my finicky child likes on her pizza.  This was quick, easy, and a big hit on the teen front!  I am a bit ashamed to say that I made a healthier meal option on the same night for my husband and me, and I couldn't stop eating this.

This was really good!  My only suggestion is to cut the pepperoni into quarters - I think the flavor would be spread out a little better.  This recipe is going on my rotation list!  Thank You

This is definitely a favorite of my family!  It is so easy and really delicious!  I increase the ground beef(or use ground turkey) to 1lb and add more pizza sauce and noodles to stretch it out.  I also top the cheese with pepperoni so it even looks like a pizza!

Pretty tasty for a basic family meal. Admittedly, after reading the reviews saying it was a little bland, I did "spice it up" a little by adding in a dash of oregano, thyme, and garlic powder, and emptied in 1/4 of a bottle of leftover spag. suace with basil in it. Also I like mushrooms on my pizza, so I threw some in as well. For a simple casserole, this is a keeper and I will make it again. Might even top it with black olives next time, my daughter's favorite(:

It is a wonderfully easy and delicious dish. I added cheese to the mix instead of the milk. I also added an additional cup of noodles to make it stretch a little farther. Will definitely make again!

Pretty good!  I made a few changes that I think really helped the casserole.  Instead of canned pizza sauce I used the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe on this site.  I added fresh mushrooms, extra garlic, canned tomatoes with basil and oregano and topped it with some fresh basil.  We really liked it!

Great recipe.... I'd give it 3 stars cause I'm not a casserole person, but my hubby and kids love it so much that I have to give it 4. It could use some more spice, maybe some chili pepper flakes. It was also good with some parmesan and olives.

My family loved this recipie, great for gatherings involving any kids! I omitted the peppers, added some cut up mushrooms (small so kids couldn't tell they were eating them). I added cut up pepperoni and Turkey sausage. It was all gone in one sitting from the four of us!

This was pretty good and really easy to make.  The nice thing about this recipe is you can change it to fit the family.  I added Candian Bacon and mushrooms to the ingredients as well as more sauce.  This is one recipe that you don't have to follow to a tee.  Clean up was a breeze and everyone had seconds.  I'll make it again.

My family loved this dish, and we have a picky pre-teen.  Like others I used mushrooms instead of peppers due to personal preference.  I also increased the amount of sauce and used a lot more cheese.  We will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This was pretty tasty, but I think next time I'll use a firmer pasta like penne. Maybe it will stand up to this casserole a little better. The egg noodles became quite soft and mushy, and I even undercooked them by a minute. I really don't care for mushy pasta. This is definitely a dish that can be tweaked to mimic any type of pizza. I added sliced mushrooms to the pan when I sauteed the meat and onions. I could also see using ham instead of pepperoni, maybe a layer of fresh tomatoes added after baking. Lots of possibilities...

Very good, and easy!  I left out the green peppers and added mushrooms. As other reviewers mentioned it does need more sauce.  I will definately make this one again, thanks!

This is really good.  My grandson was visiting when I first made it and he devoured it.  You can customize it with whatever you like on your pizza.  Will definitely use this quite a bit as a pot luck dish also.  I'll just double it for that.

Yum!  I left out the onion and added mushrooms, as that's what I like on my pizza.  Really good, both husband and toddler son liked it.

I doubled this..feeding a family of 6 with 2 man - sized boys!  We liked it but need to add more sauce next time.  I think I will add more "toppings" too.  A very easy - quick and versatile recipe!

The kids loved it! It is very filling.  I thought it wouldn't feed my whole family but it did.  I like to make the sauce a day ahead with some other pasta and then use the tomato sauce for pizza casserole.  I prefer the homemade style tomato sauce vs. the store bought.

We really liked this and it was very easy.  I had to improvise a little.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 baking pan.  I also only had sliced pepperoni and spaghetti sauce.  But that's the beauty of a casserole, use what you have.

My boyfriend loved this recipe!  As I made it I thought it tasted slightly bland (we like things with lots of flavor and spice), so I added crushed red pepper and Italian seasoning to taste.  Easy and good!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Very, very good.  I would only suggest an entire pound of ground beef, or bulk Italian sausage, and about twice the amount of grated cheese.  My husband and I, and our two small dogs, really liked this.  Also, this dish is quick and easy to prepare for a workday evening.  Thank you.

This was very good, and is a great idea for leftover spaghetti and sauce.  I chopped up some leftover grilled ribeye instead of hamburger and also had enough leftover marinara sauce with red and green peppers, onions, mushrooms, and sliced black olives.  Also happened to have some left over sliced pepperoni in the fridge that we needed to use.  I used perciatelli pasta (snapped in thirds) instead of egg noodles because I thought egg noodles would get too soggy.  It was perfect.

I made this recipe with ground chicken instead of hamburger and pepperoni, I used extra sauce also, and I used Jalapeno cheese instead of mozz to give it an extra kick, everyone loved it.  Oh yeah we can't get egg noodles here, so I used small thin bow tie pasta.

This recipe was good, simple, quick, and easy. I would make it again, but nothing I will likely add to my regular repetoire of dishes. It was a useful way to use up some leftover pizza toppings and veggies in a tasty dish.

Slightly better than the Beef & Noodle Bake on this site only because of onion, garlic & capsicum/pepper; although both are easily adaptable to suit personal taste(s). This time, I omitted the milk since I was mixing in some bechamel (white) sauce also; added sauteed sliced mushrooms and grated carrots; mixed in some parmesan & cheedar cheese too, almost like lasagna, mmm.

This was pretty good. I did leave out the green peppers and I added a can of mushrooms. I also used a can of tomato sauce instead of the pizza sauce, I think the pizza sauce would have made it too salty.

This is a very versatile and relatively easy recipe. I used the Pizza Sauce II recipe for the pizza sauce (halved that recipe).  My husband is a pizza lover, so he loved this.  I like pizza occassionally and this wasn't bad, but it was a bit strong for me.  I'll probably modify it so that it isn't quite so strong-tasting.

Wow,  just plain easy, simple & delicious. I did swap out the egg noodles for corkscrew pasta which I thought was a smart reviewer's tip. I also cooked up the diced onions & peppers in just a splash of olive oil before adding the ground beef & garlic  just to make sure that they are cooked through. I did quarter the pepperoni slices & doubled the cheese on top.

This is a great recipe that all 3 of my kids love to eat.  We make this exactly as is.  It's easy to put together in advance, preset your oven and cook it just as you are all arriving home for dinner to have it done, it's a wonderful, hearty, weekday meal.  If you have a larger family, I suggest doubling the recipe.  It reheats well if taking portions to work on subsequent days.

I had to give this recipe 4 stars because my husband thought that it would be better if it was on a pizza crust.
I made it just as it is written. I used curly noodles because that was what I had in the pantry. I added more cheese and sliced black olives. I thought it was wonderful. We ate it for 2 nights.
It made a large 9x13 pan, and would have fed several more people than a large regular pizza.

Loved this, so easy. Made with a few modifications, used 1 lb. of mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Also instead of mixing the pepperoni in with the rest of the ingredients, l made a laver of them over the mixture placed into a casserole dish, covered that with a thin layer of pizza sauce (I used 2 jars), and covered with 1 package of cheese and baked for 20 minutes. I then added a second bag of mozzarella and heated in the oven till melted. Next time I’ll add some fresh mushrooms.

I used a full pound of ground beef and some extra milk, but it is really good!  Also added fresh basil, marjoram and oregano from the garden along with some home made salsa. Some of the egg noodles got a little crusty which just added to the texture of it.  I'll do it again.

I made this for a gathering   and doubled the recipe!  Turned out great!  Just added  some black olives and some Italian  seasoning. Also added 1/2 lb. Italian sausage to the 1 lb. of ground beef.  Because it was doubled,  I also sauted the Onions, Green Pepper and Garlic  separately and added to meat after draining it.

This was decent, just a little plain in my opinion. I did add 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning and a pinch of seasoned salt and black pepper on the beef. I did not have a pepper and pepperoni, so I’m sure it would be better with that, but it had an overall lack of seasoning taste to me. I also added 1/4 tsp dried basil and a pinch of red pepper flakes to the cheese that I put on top, which was 1/2 C mozz and 1/2 C parm. I ended up doubling this recipe, and put 1 C mozz in the middle. Added some canned mushrooms, too. Update: Just reheated some of the leftovers on the same night and it tastes better than it did at dinner time. Reviewers who said “better the next day” are right.

This was good. I’ve made it before from a recipe I found in my mom’s book and its almost the same. Only different was 1lb lean ground beef and 3 jars of sauce. All other ingredients are the same

We made this last night and it came out pretty good. I put salt and pepper on the table because a review said it was bland, but neither of us reached for them. I think it had plenty of flavor, but I wouldn't say it tasted like pizza either. The final verdict was that we would make this again.

Oh. My. God. I just made this and the guys are doing backflips. I added salt, pepper and basil. I also used spaghetti noodles because that’s why DH remembers his mom using. I doubled the sauce and tripled the cheese because we really like sauce and cheese. And I did it in layers ending with the cheese. Excellent recipe!!!

So, first of all I think ratings should be based on a recipe's uniqueness and idea. Potentially there are millions of people who will try this recipe in time and as many people who try this recipe there will potentially be that many different individual tastes. For example, I added more ingredients than the recipe called for and the picture looked like it added more ingredients, i.e., sliced black olives (which I love) and basil as a topper (which my wife really loves!). I also read other reviewers' comments and incorporated some of their ideas. Oh and the person who suggested shrooms; great idea, but I used fresh. I wanted to keep it simple but maybe next time I'll make my own marinara sauce (Apparently I don't like commercially prepared sauces). Lastly, I urge anyone who cooks with mozzarella cheese to use a high quality cheese. It's best to buy fully hydrated mozzarella but that is a lengthy process to remove the water; therefore buy the market prepackaged block mozzarella and shred it yourself (much better outcome).

Final thoughts: The way I made it didn't taste much like pizza even though I added Deli-style pepperoni but it was a great 
meat marinara pasta on steroids.

Thanks for the idea!

Cooked up whole pound of burger with pepper and onion and then set half aside. Think it would have been too much vegetable. Added crushed red pepper flakes. Darn good.

It was pretty good, but for the amount of work, I’d rather make a baked ziti or a lasagna. If I did make it again I might use sausage instead of hamburger to add flavor. I added extra garlic and extra cheese but it still was still pretty mild.

Easy to put together, I substituted the green peppers with bacon. It was so cheesey and delicious. Goes great with garlic bread. My son passed the recipe on to me. I'm glad he did.

I made two changes. I used rotini noodles and used turkey sausage crumbles instead of the ground beef and pepperoni. (I don’t like pepperoni.) I tossed on extra cheese to make it look more like the photo. Otherwise I followed the recipe. It was just an ok recipe that had looked fantastic in the photo. When I reheated leftovers, I jazzed it up a bit—more cheese and sausage, splashed on some Texas Pete hot sauce. Now it was a four. Maybe mushrooms and black olives would help, too. Not a bad recipe and easy to tweak.

Who doesn’t like pizza? Loved this easy to make casserole. I followed the receipt and added mushrooms, black olives and chopped prosciutto. The only thing I would recommend is to bake it in the same fry pan you assemble it in. Not only saves dishes but the shallow fry pan allows more of the ingredients to be covered with cheese. Delicious.

Made it as written first time. Now i use lb of egg noodles, lb italian sausage (makes all the difference), 4tsp garlic, 2 14oz jars pizza sauce, skip onion, and put pepperoni and olives on top of half of it (not everybody likes them). Great for large group or leftovers, i make it close to once a month.

I followed this recipe but didn’t think that it was amazing. I am willing to try it again and use Italian sausage instead of ground beef. I’m thinking it will taste more like pizza to me!

I love pizza so any variation on that is something I'm willing to try. I used spiral pasta to hold more sauce per bite. I used 1/4lb hot Italian sausage and 1/4lb lean ground beef. I did not use onion or green pepper. I used 1 small can portabella pieces that I added before I baked. I put a layer of mozzerella in the middle before I baked and the required mozzerella on top for the last 10 minutes. For sauce I used Hunt's basil, garlic, oregano tomato sauce. I also left out the garlic as there was garlic in my sauce. This dish was a hit at Thanksgiving

My kids liked this recipe a lot.  My husband and I thought it was good.  It's kind of like a dry (not a lot of sauce) baked ziti.  It was quick and easy, and it's always nice to have a few of those recipes around to rely on.  I will make it again.

Very good. It was enough for the three of us in my family but if you have more than three in your family you may want to double the recipe. You could use any pasta with this but I like the egg noodles because they're not as heavy as most pasta.

My husband and children liked it better than I did but it was just "ok."  To me, it needed more sauce and I added more but it still didn't seem like enough.  The next day, it was even dryer than before.  I used spiral noodles like another review suggested and it seemed to hold the sauce better than a flat noodle would.  Also, I added green olives to mine and seasoned the meat with Italian seasoning and garlic salt.  The dish definitely had a pizza taste but it just didn't have the sauciness I was looking for.  I may try it again with at least double the sauce and a shorter baking time since really all of the ingredients are cooked before baking anyway.

Delicious recipe for my pizza loving husband! I did make a few changes such as using cheese tortellini for the pasta, omitting the milk, and using Tastefully Simple's "Onion Onion" seasoning in place of actual onions since he doesn't like those. Overall it came out wonderful and he really enjoyed it. We will definitely be making this one again!

Overall, this was good with some modifications. I used rotini pasta because I didn't have egg noodles and I think a beefier noodle is better. I also used a spicier pepperoni, cut into small chunks. I didn't have to spice it up too much more than that. The only other change I would make is to stir cheese into it along with adding some on top.

This is a kid-friendly meal that our picky 6-year-old loved (finally, something she will eat!!!). Husband would prefer Italian sausage instead of hamburger (but then it would be two spicy for the kiddo). We had to saute the onions and peppers separately and only those who wanted them added them on top on their plates, but it still came out tasting great!

This was so good!! Made recipe as is. Used frozen onions and green peppers for short cut. I wouldn't change a thing except double it next time in order to have more. 
One thing I did was layer some cheese in the middle prior to cooking. Loved this!!

My family and I thought this was a little bland. I almost always follow recipes exactly, but if I make this again, I will need to add more salt, pepper, and even garlic powder...something to really bring out the pizza flavor.

This tastes great and worked well with gluten-free noodles (brown rice & quinoa). It gives us the taste of pizza on a GF diet. :)

Additions: mushrooms, used turkey pepperoni and sausage instead. Also, I only use one jar (8 oz) of marinara sauce - 16 oz was way too much and it ended up soup-like.

My kids love this recipe.  I don't add the pepper, onions or milk and replace garlic with garlic salt.  Also I use mini pepperoni, 14oz jar of pizza sauce, and  3 cups any type of uncooked pasta (I have actually never used egg noodles) and it works great!

Was pretty good, would add less green pepper and try to cook the green pepper longer. It was still kind of crunchy after baking it.

This is a great easy one. I tried to half the recipe and it ended up a little dry, but that was all on me. I read someone did a variation with mac n cheese prepped instead of egg noodles. Gonna try that next time!

Loved it! I did add a whole pound of ground beef and 1/2 cup more egg noodles and left it all in a large cast iron skillet. Just moved the skillet to the oven, easier than transferring dishes.

I followed it almost as it was.  only thing  I did was omit green peppers (i can't eat those).  After reading reviews I decided to use half hamburger and half italian sausage.  Spiced it up nicely.  
This recipe you can  modify to individual pizza likes.  Will definitely be making again.

This dish was ok. It was a little dry, so I added some jar spaghetti sauce over the top before I put the cheese on top. I would recommend having an extra jar of pizza sauce on hand because I think it would have tasted better than adding spaghetti sauce. I will make it again, it's just not a 5 star recipe.

This is a fun twist on a warm casserole meal for the colder months in fall and winter.  I made it using thick pepperoni slices, and browned "pepperoni pizza sausage" that my local grocery store makes (rather than using plain hamburger)....  but I like that you can very easily adapt this to your family's mood and tastes.  All of my picky children ate and enjoyed!

This recipe was really good! I made it for dinner and there was enough for me to take to work for the week, but I don't eat a whole lot, so it may not be enough like that for everyone. I used crumbled sausage instead of ground beef because I prefer that on pizza. I think I will cut down on the pepperoni next time because it seemed like a lot. But overall this was easy and tasted great!

This was delicious.  I use 14 oz. jar of pizza sauce and  pepperoni minis.  I might try adding more noodles next time but this was very good as is.

This recipe was great. I think what makes or breaks it is the pizza sauce you buy. I used "Contadina Pizza Squeeze". I also used olives instead of bell pepper since my boyfriend doesn't like them. It came out delicious and was super easy.

Made this on the weekend for 2 kids that LOVE pizza, and my wife and I (who also enjoy Pizza).  Well received by all, followed recipe for the base of the dish.  Only customized to my kids likings by adding mushrooms and black olives.  It was a hit, and even better the next day, after everything had a chance to sit and blend... even my wife (my toughest critic) enjoyed it!
Will be a regular "comfort" dish in the future, I am sure.
The only suggestion my wife had was to use a heartier noodle, as opposed to egg noodles, as I see some have used Rotini, Penne, etc...

Excellent recipe. I went with a hearty version and used a full pound of ground beef and 2 & 1/2 cups of dry noodles. It barely fit in the casserole dish but it made a perfect amount for my wife, my daughter and myself to eat over the course of two meals. We're definitely making this meal again!

We all loved this. I didn't change much- less onion and pepper just bc we don't care for them. Also, I didn't have any ground beef defrosted, so I used precooked, frozen meatballs. Covered the top with a layer of pepperoni. It was so amazing. My oldest son asked for it again a couple of nights later. Also- it makes food leftovers for lunch the next day.

This was a hit. My husband said if I had added mushrooms and black olives, it would have been a five star. So, I added it on to the recipe print out. I did cut up a lot of roma tomatoes and added them to this dish since I love tomatoes and I had them on hand. I also added some Italian seasoning. By the way, I used a three quart casserole dish and not a two quart because I was afraid it would not all fit. I used veggie spiral noodles for this dish. I will definitely make it again.

Lacked a little flavour and texture. But hey, cheese, sauce, pork etc. No major complaints. Simple, relatively quick and pretty standard, reliable ingredients.

I used pasta we had that needed to get used. My son doesn't like ground hamburger I skipped it - plus I'm a single mom...meat is expensive...I did run to store and get the pepperonis because he wanted them.   I broiled for a couple of minutes before pulling out of the oven. I used Classico traditional pizza sauce and added more milk than called for because it seemed a bit dry otherwise.

Excellent. Actually really tastes like pizza. If you are health conscious, pick a pizza sauce with low sodium content. Add pepper and it is a great dish quite enjoyable. I could easily see mushrooms in there for mushroom lovers (which I am not).

Didn't have the flavor I was expecting. The green pepper took over and dominated the dish. Needs more depth of flavors and that requires adding herbs/spices that aren't in it.

My son has made this twice and I've made it once. We both think this is a pretty good recipe. When he first made it, he added a red bell pepper to it as well, he used ground beef and I used ground Italian sausage.  When I made it, I did add some additional seasoning and mixed some cheese in the mixture and he still liked. Of course he said his tasted better than mine. No bother, we like it and will make again.

I substituted ground turkey.  My family of picky eaters all asked for seconds and devoured the leftovers.  When I don't have to throw away leftovers I.know I'm onto something good.

How easy was this!  Baking it for the 10 minutes put a nice crunch to this casserole.  I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, and I did add basil at the end for our personal taste, but the pepperoni and sausage had lots of flavor for us.

Favorite for all! I will often add broccoli, mushrooms, or other veggies suitable for pizza.  I add 1 tsp Italian herbs and when in the mood for a little heat I add crushed red pepper.  Easy to make it your own with these directions as the foundation. It's filling and tasty and great to make ahead for a crowd. We often feed it to 20 at a time and it is enjoyed by all.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a quick and EASY dish, and it gets an enthusiastic TWO THUMBS UP from Hubby, who is the cook in the house. You can make this recipe as-is and it will be fine, so my 5-stars is based on the original recipe not my personal preferences in tweaking this recipe. :::::::  I knew my Hubby is a serious meat/cheese fanatic, so I added the entire pack of pepperoni (that I cut up) and doubled the cheese. For me it was a bit much as far as the add'l pepperoni, but Hubby went crazy over it. I cooked the pepperoni along with the ground beef.  I apparently didn't read the recipe close enough and went ahead and stirred my 8-oz pk of cheese in with the pizza sauce mixture. (Turned out fine.) I put the meat mixture into the casserole dish in two portions so that I could sandwich the add'l 8-oz pk of mozzarella layered in between. The good news is you can tweak this quick and easy recipe to suit your particular desire.

This recipe is a kid pleaser! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef (healthier, less greasy), and I sautéed the pepperoni first. This is a great one to let the kids help with because each can do a specific job then it all comes together to bake. I would definitely make this again!

I did make changes but, this is a great base recipe. If you like something on a pizza--try adding it to this casserole, I don't think you could go wrong. I used whole wheat macaroni and added bacon and pineapple tidbits--I think I will use crushed pineapple next time. Also added  mushrooms. My family (and my neighbors) loved this recipe.

Good base recipe, could use some added seasoning. I added salt and Italian seasoning to the meat but still needed more. I used pre sliced pepperoni which wasn't a great choice. Would have worked well with the mini pepperoni. Or next time I'll put half noodles down and layer the pepperoni then top with rest of noodles.

Was amazing but yes did make changes as we all have different taste when it comes to Pizza, removed peppers, added sliced hot dogs, bacon, chicken and used passata instead of Pizza sauce as I couldn't find any. Fed 7 of us with 2 having extra bowls and everyone loved it.

I have to admit I made a few changes. I added diced mushrooms. I used spaghetti sauce and more of it, I added Romano, Parmesan and mozarella to mixture and changed pasta to penne. I'm was very impressed with how it turned out. Definitely a family favorite!

It was good but I think I should have covered it (before I added the cheese) when I baked it.  It dried out a little.

Made this with Arribata sauce instead of pizza sauce.  The spicy is a nice touch.  I will add 1/2 # italian sausage next time along with some more spices (oregano, red pepper and fennel).

The only thing I changed was I added seasoning to the meat, added bacon and didn't add the veggies. The sauce is the problem. It gets all soaked up in the noodles and the next day looses all flavor. I may try regular pasta sauce next time. Not sure.

It tastes scrumptious!!! I used 1 lb. of ground chuck, a 1/2 lb. of sausage and a 6 oz. pkg. of pepperoni. I also used 4 cups of mozzarella cheese.  I used only 1 1/2 lb. of egg noodles. a 14 oz. jar of pizza sauce. We love garlic so 4 cloves went into mine, kosher salt & cracked pepper to taste.  I didn't make it the way it states because looking at the recipe I know I wouldn't like it as written.

I actually really love this recipe. I only add more cheese and skip the milk (mostly because I forget). But it's easy easy to make, my husband, my son,  and myself love it. It's definitely one of the best recipes I've ever made and the fact that it's so easy makes it even better.

I cooked this for my family and they loved it. Made a few changes though; used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, and added more cheese.

Overall good recipe. Only used 1/2 of an onion to balance out with the rest of the dish. Included larger chunks of fresh mozzarella, in addition to some other shredded cheeses. Prior to putting into the oven I sliced bacon into small pieces, cooked, and then stirred in with the pepperoni. Great dish for kids!

This was easy and tasted great.  The pepperoni makes it.  I didn't have pizza sauce so I just used spaghetti sauce and added a little italian seasoning. kids liked it a lot.

I used a mild sausage instead of the hamburger and slightly cooked the pepperoni to remove the grease from it. Will definitely make again. Oh I omitted the green pepper because my kids don't like. Even the 4 yr old liked it

Bomb-diggity. I changed the recipe just a tiny bit. Italian sausage instead of ground beef, 1 package mini pepperoni, tri-color rotini and way more cheese. Also, I left out the milk.

Used 1 pound of Italian sausage instead of the ground beef. Sautéed some red pepper flakes in the mix. Also used rotini instead of egg noodles. Tasted great with black olives added in.

This is one of my family's favorites.  I use rotini noodles instead and double up on the pizza sauce.  Sometimes when time is tight, instead of cooking it in the oven I just keep it in the skillet and melt the mozzarella cheese throughout.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan. I also used ritoni pasta instead of eggnoodles because that's what  I prefer and added fresh garlic to the burger/veggie mix. It was delicious and family approved including my 4 and 2 year olds! This will stay on our meal plan possibilities.

This was fantastic (and EASY)!!! I'll admit I had low expectations but it was really yummy, AS WRITTEN! I didn't change a thing except that I used pre-sliced turkey pepperoni because that is what my husband grabbed at the store. I   thought the green bell pepper made it taste like a supreme pizza. My picky 9 year old liked it but ate around the pepper, as I expected. My 1-year old loved it. I'd say it's like a grown-up pizza casserole, and I don't like mushrooms but I imagine they'd be a good addition if you like them on your pizza. Two thumbs up for taste and ease of preparation!

My family wasn't a fan of the recipe. If I make it in the future I will add one cup shredded mozzarella and one cup shredded cheddar, double the sauce, either uses those tiny pepperonis or dice up the pepperoni really well, take out the bell pepper, 1/2 the garlic, and use 1/3 the onion.

In terms of cook time, this recipe is spot on. However, I found it rather bland on its own. I added salt, basil, half a cup of pepperoni, and twice as much garlic. I also needed to add more cheese since my husband and I are both cheese lovers.

Everytime I cook this my husband loves it and says he could eat it anytime.  Tonight I added about two links of mild Italian sausage when I browned the ground beef with onion, garlic and pepper.  When I added the pepperoni, I added sliced mushrooms and was even better.  Great, tasty and easy!!!

We make this pizza casserole at least twice a month. It is cheap, easy, and our family loves it. My only suggestion is to buy a higher quality pizza sauce (which usually come in around 14 or 15 oz versus the 16 oz in the recipe). We sometimes add whatever we have on hand, like mushrooms.

Super delicious and easy. You can add pretty much whatever you like from mushrooms to black olives. Thanks for the recipe.

Did 1/2 pound beef and full sausage seasoned and it was probably too much meat. Baked in square glass dish. No pepper.

The entire family loved the taste of this recipe.  Easy and quick to make.  Easy to change up for those picky kids... one of my kids don't like pepperoni so I quartered off a section and left it out of that portion.  It was perfect - no taste of pepperoni at all on that side of the baking tray.  My kids asked me to make it AGAIN the following night! Definitely a keeper!

Made it twice.  Kids loved it.  It's like a combination pizza in a casserole pan.  I followed advice of others and used 1/2 beef 1/2 Italian sausage and I added olives.  I used whatever pasta I had on hand.  In fact after making it the first time, I had 1/2 lb each of beef, sausage, and mozzarella left over, so I tossed it all in the freezer with a note to myself and a copy of the recipe for a "no-brainer" dinner a couple weeks later.

Tasty, fast, easy, inexpensive.  I made this dish because I had everything on hand and not much else available to make dinner at the last minute!  I used angel hair pasta and it worked fine, also intentionally mixed the cheese into the sauce/pasta mix and topped with crumbled mini saltines...I pushed the crackers into the sauce before cooking so they wd soak it in a little and become more cohesive with the rest of the dish.  Got two thumbs up from the tasters.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was AMAZING!!!! I substituted all meats with turkey, added 2 cups of mozzarella cheese and sprinkled the top with some Parmesan cheese. Also, once done in the oven, I broiled the top for about 2 mins for some crispness...

This is Awesome! We love pizza and pasta so this is a perfect combo. Doubled it off the bat and glad I did. The flavors meld together and it tastes like pizza! Only thing I did differently was to add more cheese in in layers in the casserole. Thanks for this!????

This was really good. I didn't use a whole cup of pepperoni, I just took about 4 slices and I diced them up so it would be easier to eat. I should note I didn't put this in the oven. I just added the noodles to the meat and pizza sauce in the skillet, stirred it all up and it was great. I didn't miss the cheese at all.  I served with a salad and garlic bread.

I made this yesterday with some adjustments. I used whole wheat penne pasta. Instead of beef, I used extra lean ground turkey which I seasoned with onion powder, pepper, oregano, minced garlic, and about 1 or 2 tsp of ground Chile de Arbol. Once ready to be mixed together, I used half turkey pepperoni and half regular pepperoni. Also, I sprinkled about 1/2-3/4 cup of cheese in the mixture and added less cheese on top, but still enough to taste the cheese. Sliced tomatoes were placed on the top. On my boyfriend's half I added black olives, mushrooms, and jalepenos, plus a sprinkle of Chile de Arbol on the top. It was delicious. My boyfriend especially loved it. He ate basically his hole half (3 bowls full) to the point he said his stomach hurt. :P It was definitely a hit.

I Loved this!  My 2 year olds didn't seem too impressed but I think because the pepperoni I used was too spicy.  Like others I sautéed my onions and added ground sausage. Yummy!

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe as written, but the jar of pizza sauce was 2 oz short of what I needed.  I definitely think it would have benefitted from more sauce.  Other than that, the only thing I changed was that I added additional cheese because our family likes cheese.  Will definitely make again.

Love this!!! My family loves pizza so I decided to try this without the peppers. I made a meat lovers pizza casserole with sausage, Canadian bacon, ground beef, and pepperoni. I've got a super picky family so I used onion and garlic powder instead of the chopped onions and garlic. I also added Parmesan. It came out tasting so good. Everyone loved it.

I gave this a five star because it's a great basic recipe for starter like me. I double the recipe and didn't use too much onion plus didn't use any bell pepper. It taste pretty good but i feel like just the beef alone it doesn't add much flavor so i will be using half beef and half Italian sausage along with more of the cheddar/mozzarella cheese.

I added green olives, used seasoned pork sausage instead of ground beef, and added a little bit of seasoning. I layered it in a 9x13 pan with the noodles at the bottom, meat & veggie mixture in the middle, then sauce and topped with cheese. Awesome!

What makes this better than actual pizza is you don't get the crash from the carbs.

Good base, but needed a few changes to be great. We added a can of sliced black olives, 2 tbsp of Italian seasoning, a jalapeno (next time would add 2) and increased the amounts to fill a 3qt casserole dish since we like leftovers for work lunches. 
To increase amount to fill 3qt casserole, use 1 full lb beef, 3 cups pasta, 2 tins of pizza sauce and 2 cups of freshly sliced pepperoni. Next time I would add sliced mushrooms as well!

Made this tonight for dinner and it turned out really great! Only subbed penne for the egg noodles and garlic powder for the garlic cloves. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is great and everyone loved it! It's only as good as the sauce you use, though, so don't go skimpy. Use name brand. I've expiremented with store brand first and got an "eh" reaction, then used a few name brands and it went from "eh" to "WHOO HOO THIS IS GOOD! What did you do different?" The better quality the sauce, the better the result. ;) Bazinga

Made this as the recipe called for, but with a few minor changes because of what I had on hand. I used prosciutto instead of pepperoni, ground turkey instead of beef (for a healthier version), and my husband can't stand cooked bell peppers so I left those out too. Delicious basic recipe, and made for wonderful lunch leftovers!

6 out 6 family members loved this recipe. That is unheard of in my household. The kids range in age from 12 to 19. The only issue I have is how dry it is. It could be the brand of pizza sauce (Contadina) or the recipe doesn't call for enough sauce. I added water to it the second time and it seemed to help. Even with the water it had plenty of taste. Definitely a keeper.

Tried this with the following amendments:  used canned mushrooms in place of the green peppers (son doesn't care for them), left out the ground beef (just gets lost among all the mushrooms).  Very tasty!  I would suggest waiting to add the cheese at one's plate, as the "sheet" on top of the casserole slides easily when cut and some pieces get left out of the cheesy goodness.

Kids loved it. I wasn't crazy about it but it was easy to make and did freeze well. Maybe adding some spicy italian sausage next time might help.

I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used ground turkey instead of beef and turkey pepperoni instead of regular (I used those both times). The kids gobbled it up and asked for seconds, and then asked for more the next day for lunch. I however, thought it was bland and very processed tasting (think: tv dinner). The second time I made my own pizza sauce, added sliced black olives and some ricotta cheese and it was a lot better (to me) than the first round. The kids gobbled it down once again, and really enjoyed the addition of sliced black olives (that's the only difference they noted!). Either way, it's a great recipe and a big hit with the kids!

I made this this past weekend and it was great!  I added 1 can of diced tomatoes to it as well and it made a different!  I'm not sure if I'd use egg noodles again, I think I'd use the Rotini/Spiral pasta instead.  I froze several servings of it and it should be good when I go to use and reheat!

Left out the onion and green bell peppers (bf and i do not like) Instead of garlic i just used garlic powder. For the pepperoni, i bought them in slices and cut them in halves... Turned out great and tasty! Will be making more often.

I doubled this recipe (because it was easier that way) and used 1/2 beef and 1/2 sausage, and it turned out okay. I thought that it was a little dry, and would maybe suggest using half sauce half crushed tomatoes with extra seasoning instead of just pizza sauce. I will try this one again, because I think it has a lot of potential for a dish that can be used to feed a large number of people that is very simple.

Made this recipe as is aside from two things: I added 1 cup of fresh mushrooms for personal preference and due to limited time I prepared this the night before and refridgerated it until it was time to cook. Turned out great although 30 minutes in the oven wasn't quite enough to warm it up, it need about an extra 10-15. Definitely will be making this again!

It was good - pretty basic.  Easy and similar to other recipes I've made.  I used a box of tri-colored rotini, 2 jars of pizza sauce (they are now 14oz), green pepper, onion, garlic, mushrooms, and black olives (stuff I like on a pizza).  I followed someone elses suggestion and used half beef/ half sausage.  Probably will not make again but keep looking for other recipes.  I was trying to use up a package of pepperoni and this worked for that purpose.

Really liked this recipe.  I added 4 cloves of garlic though, really like garlic.  Also doubled the amount of cheese, 1 cup in between layers and one on top.  Used pre-sliced pepperoni and cut into quarters,also used mushrooms and hot Italian sausage, which I cooked in with the hamburger.  Had another couple over and this was a big hit.  I will make this one again, but add some hot peppers also next time.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE. I only had pene noodles but im sure egg would be great. I cooked the pene noodles before adding them to the mixture and that seemed to work out really well I added mixed veggies and bread crumbs on top. Nothing like adding your own spin but even if you follow to the T it is perfect! I thought about adding cream of mushroom soup but I am glad i didnt!!!

I just made this recipe with the serving size cut down for 2 people (me and my boyfriend). It could have done with a few more noodles and I cut the time down to 15mins total because the size is so much smaller. Turned out very good :) I will make it again!

LOVE!  Thank you so much for such a great, easy recipe.  My picky 6-year old absolutely loved this dish.  I modified it for a gluten-free/dairy-free diet by using Tinkyada spiral shells (I've tried other GF brands and Tinkyada is by far the best), omitting the 4 T of milk and using a dairy-free cheese, such as the Daiya mozzarella shreds- came out fantastic!  I read where a previous reviewer expressed their doubts whether a 14 oz. jar of pizza sauce would be enough or not- I thought the same thing but sure enough, the 14 oz. is just the right amount!  Not dry or swamped with too much sauce.  I also used Italian ground sausage instead of beef.  The best thing about this recipe is that you can customize it the way you want, much like ordering a regular pizza.  Thanks again for sharing!

Good recipe.  I used ground sausage instead and next time I will use a pound of it instead of 1/2 pound.  Also mixed 1 cup of cheese in with it in addition to the cheese on top.

Was easy to cook and ok but its kinda like hamburger helper. I could not get over having the pizza sausage in it mixed in with the hamburger. Will not make this again.

From a family of 5....with three small kids, we thoroughly enjoyed it.   I didn't have garlic or green peppers when I made it, and it still was very tasty. (Although, sometime I'll try it with the garlic and peppers.) This recipe fed my family with no leftovers.

Very good!  I used italian sausage instead of beef (because I read it wrong) and added a can of diced tomatoes to boost the veggie factor.  I also used up the second half of a red pepper.  My roommates and I loved this dish!

This was really good!  I used a 'spicy sicilian pizza sauce' and loaded on some crushed red pepper flake.  I think next time I will omit the ground beef and instead use a spicy sausage.  I forgot to cook the onions & peppers with the beef, but I think I like it better the way I did it.  I like the crunch of the peppers & onions for texture.  Great stuff!

I made this with rotini noodles instead of egg noodles.  It was very good but next time I will add more sauce and more cheese, maybe parmesan as well as mozzarella.  Great, semi quick meal!

Great quick recipe. Just added mushrooms, it's a Canadian thing. Only because I didnt have mozzarella cheese I used sharp chedder with monteray jack. Also because I was paying more attention to the kids than what I was doing I opened tomato paste. I added chunky mushroom spaghetti sauce to get more flavour. Will make it again!

I never know how to rate a recipe since I ALWAYS make changes. With my changes this was definitely a five star dish. I used rotini instead of egg noodles, ground sausage instead of turkey, no onion (No one here likes them), added black olives and mushrooms and a bit more pizza sauce so it wouldn't be too dry. Fabulous dish. Everyone LOVED it!

Turned this recipe vegetarian by substituting fake ground beef crumbles and fake pepperoni.  Still great, though can even be made vegan by substituting egg noodles for regular pasta and mozz cheese for some Daiya

My 7 yr old son had to help make a meal for a Cub Scout requirement so we made this. Very simple. In the end, my 2 extremely picky kids did not like it (onions and peppers in it). I thought it was good.  I would add more noodles and make them a little undercooked since they cook longer in the oven.

Really like the flavor, but had a hard time getting noodles done.  I substitued elbow because that is what I had, and used more liquid in the casserole.  I used a package spaghetti sauce and added past, water, and 2 can of tomatoes to the mix, oh an more cheese.  Really turned out good!

I gave it 5 stars because it is a good base recipe. I added italian seasoning and also mixed mozzarella cheese throughout.  Also I added fresh tomatoes and mushrooms. I was wary about adding the milk but it did add a welcome creamy consistency.

It wasn't bad, and it did taste like pizza. It was just very heavy and more like a pasta casserole.

This was fantastic! I had my doubts, and I am glad I went for it.  The only change I made was to add mushrooms, add a bit less sauce, and more noodles. I left out the garlic because I bought garlic pizza sauce by mistake. The basic recipe is the exact same of course. This is like a homemade pizza, but better! My sister LOVES pizza, and hates crust. This was a dream come true for her, not to mention there was squabbling over the leftovers.

I knew this was a hit when my husband hugged me and told me that I should save this recipe. :-) It's so easy to make and can be modified with any "toppings" you like. I used Hot Italian chicken sausage in place of the ground beef and turkey pepperoni. I also added a 4 oz. can of sliced black olives and doubled the cheese with 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 Colby Jack. We'll be making this one again for sure!

I didn't think this was bad. But I felt like it was missing something and was lack luster. What I thought was going to taste really great - didn't. I followed the recipe exactly so maybe with some changes it would be better.

This recipe is an excellent base recipe. I added additional seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic powder, chilli flakes)...otherwise I think it would have been a little too bland. Also used ground turkey sausage instead of ground beef. Delicious, simple and fast meal!!

after reading reviews...and seeing the noodles and other ingred. in pan, I knew I needed more sauce so I added  an additional 3/4 cup. I skipped the bell pepper. I put half on bottom of pan than the cheese...than the rest....last 10 minutes of cook time I threw on more cheese. I also added some ital. seasoning to the mix to just to ensure enough flavor! Oh wait....one more thing.... i used rig. noodles instead of egg noodles!

Usually I like a lot of sauce, but I actually had to double the amount of egg noodles for this!  2 cups of egg noodles is only 2 servings.  There was more sauce than there was noodles.  Other than the noodle issue, I thought this was fine.  Nothing special really but a decent way to use up ingredients leftover from making pizza this weekend!  Next time I'll just make Cheesy Spaghetti Bake from this website with the ingredients because we love that recipe, I just sub pizza sauce for the tomato soup in the recipe and add normal pizza toppings to it.

I found this a little boring and bland.  I would spice it up a little with some chili flakes and definitly add more cheese.  An okay weekday recipe and family friendly for sure!

Wow!  Love, love, love this recipe!  I'm not a huge onion fan..so I just put some minced onion in with my hamburger and leave out the chopped onion.  I also leave out the green pepper...again, not a fan.  However, I add mushrooms and olives to my casserole.  We love pepperoni's, olives and mushrooms on our pizza and this tastes just like it!  Highly recommend making this if you are a pizza fan.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

Excellent dish. I added celery just cause I like the extra crunch and threw in some spinach for the health factor, was AWESOME. Used rotini pasta and  a bit of crushed red peppers as recommended by others and left out the pepperoni (personal preference). Forgot to add the milk and used lots of mozzarella cheese atop the casserole. Was fantastic. Bf loved it, will make again!

This was very easy to make and pretty tasty too!  My only suggestion is to add some salt and pepper to the dish.  This could be added either when you are mixing all the ingredients together or when you are browning the beef.  Perhaps the brand of pizza sauce I used was low in sodium, but this dish got much tastier once I added some salt to the finished product.

It tasted better the second day than it did the first but I generally am not a fan. It had a little too much pepperoni.

Oh. my. gosh.  Talk about sooooooo easy but also soooooooo yummy!!  Everyone LOVED this dish and we had no leftovers!  I didn't use processed cheese but used 2 cups of shredded Colby & Mozzarella (1 cup. when mixing together all ingredients & 1 cup on top of casserole).  This will be a staple for my household.

Thought this recipe was great! I accidently mixed in the cup of cheese so I added another cup on top about 20 minutes into baking. That worked well for me because I love cheese! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It was so good! I didn't have pizza sauce so I used Prego sauce w/can of tomato paste along with black olives,extra garlic cloves,oregano,garlic salt to taste,basil,extra pepparoni slices cut in half(Hormel sell these pepparoni slices and are 70% less fat) Everyone enjoyed this meal so much. My husband said he thinks this dish should be made at our local pizza parlor. I will definately make this dish again and again.=)

I made this exactly like the recipe.  This was horribly greasy and had no flavor.  We will not try this recipe again.

I'd use a heartier noodle than egg noodles if I made this again. The casserole was just ok & had too much of a bite for my teenagers.

This recipe is so simple to adapt to your tastes. I use rotini pasta, ground beef, italian sausage, garlic, green bell pepper, green olives, pepperoni, and lots of cheese...just the way I love my pizza

My son said "Mommy, this is the best thing you've ever cooked." I've waited 12 years to hear that. He cleaned his plate AND it had onions and peppers (two things that usually find their way to the side of the plate to be scraped off later). Thank you for an quick and easy recipe that my family enjoyed.

I have made this several times and my entire family (even my 5 yr old daughter and 2 year old daughter) loves it! I have made it for company and it always gets rave reviews. I leave out the green bell pepper and add more cheese. It is fantastic. Thanks for a great recipe!

My bf and I really enjoyed this dish but it didn't taste like pizza. It was another flavorful pasta dish. You have to add more sauce it can get a bit dry.

i was so happy just making this, let alone eating it! :) i mixed in a full cup of mozz cheese, and stirred the whole dish after about 20 minutes in the oven, sprinkled more cheese on top, and popped it back in the oven until it browned a little. if this wasn't so heavy i'd make it every night and be a happy girl!

This was great! I did tweak it a little.  I used a food processor on the onion (1/2), green pepper and garlic.  Chopped them REALLY small.  I then added it to the ground beef that was cooking (about 3/4 lb).  This way my picky husband didn't notice the chunks of onion and peppers :)  I mixed the mozzarella in the entire mixture, then at the end sprinkled about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese on top.  I am eating the left-overs right now :)

I am giving this three stars because it wasn't horrible but it wasn't that great. My husband and I both thought it was going to be better than it actually was. I even added mushrooms and olives. Will not be making again.

I decided to make this recipe as a quick way to feed our "family" of 4 with hopes of having leftovers to store in the freezer. My roommates liked it so much that "serves 7" really wasn't an accurate estimate for me.   For me though, I would have preferred something a little less protein-&-carb-packed and something with more vegetables. Next time (b/c I think there will be a next time, judging by the approval of my roommates) I will reduce the amount of pepperoni and ground beef and add more vegetables (like mushrooms).

This was great.  I used just some garlic powder (didn't have the cloves) and used just 1/2 cup each of onion/peppers.  Used 2 cups of mozz cheese on top.  Everything else I done like it said and it was perfect!

I usually do not change recipes the first time I make it because I hate when I read a 5 star review when everythings been altered and it's a whole new recipe! :O Call me a hypocrite because that's what I did with this recipe upon reading some of the not so good reviews....... I used rotini pasta, added mushrooms, used canadian bacon instead of pepperoni (my preference), added parmesan and mozzarela in a middle layer before baking (still added the mozzarela on top). I also added fresh basil. It was SO yummy and easy. I will be making this again!

I would probably give this a 4, but my two kids absolutely LOVED this recipe and my son said "this goes into rotation" so I'm giving it 5 stars.  Nothing fancy here.  Easy to do with staples in your pantry.  Thanks for sharing.

I can only give a fair rating.  The amount of pepperoni in the recipe made this entirely too rich for anyone in the family to really enjoy.  I would recommend cutting the pepperoni by half so that it doesn't overpower the rest of the casserole which - by itself - is tasty.

Very good! As far as "toppings," I added pepperoni cut into quarters, fresh white mushrooms that I sliced, pickeled banana peppers and jalapenos that i had and sliced onion. This was not good as leftovers the next day, however! Because I only feed one mouth, I think I will half it next time!

Very yummy, quick and easy.  Made two...one pretty much as the recipe said and another with whole wheat rigatoni noodles, mushrooms and spinach...no ground beef.  Added some Italian seasoning to the top of both and broiled for about 5 minutes so the cheese was lightly browned.  So very good!

This is fabulous!  My boyfriend, who doesn't care too much for tomato-based dishes, gives this a four-star review-he says he would make it cheesier.  Me-I couldn't stop eating it!  I give this 4-1/2 stars and I think I'm going to experiment next time with alfredo sauce-for my boyfriend, of course!

wasn't a big fan.I don't know why but it reminded me of a hamburger helper type dish.Matter of fact I had used a banquet boxed pizza casserole and it was pretty similar in taste.

My whole family loved this recipe. We exchanged the ground beef for ground sausage and layered the ingredients instead of mixing them. My husband also insisted on coloring the noodles red but other than that we thought with was a great recipe. Definitely will make it again!

Very good recipe! So simply, yet delicious! I even used ground turkey and it was still good! :) Will make again, next time I'll add black olives and mushrooms!

My friends really did like that Pizza Casserole. I made an adjustments and added oregano and basil within the mixture before baking. I thought it would be more Pizza like. I used sliced peperoni instead of peperoni sausage. I would also recommend adding more sauce. Most of the sauce got sucked up during the baking process. Overall, good recipe.

Very kid friendly recipe. My 8 yr. old loved this. We made a few changes that made it perfect. 1st we quartered the pepperonis then we added a layer of mozzerella cheese in the middle of the casserole.  Yumm

good, everyone liked.  to lower fat content I used turkey instead of beef and turkey pepporoni but overall could use more sauce - a little dry.

Could use a little bit more kick after the healthy alterations, but still quite good. Changes: more garlic, 1 6oz package turkey pepperoni, use very lean ground beef, low fat cheese & skim milk.

I think a lot has to do with the brand ingredients that are used, as pizza sauces, noodles, etc vary greatly. I used a brand sauce we love for homemade pizza. I did use egg noodles, as others have stated is a must. Still we thought over all the dish lacked flavor and it was rather mushy. I cooked the noodles following the package directions exactly. I even added turkey pepperoni, browned Italian sausage and extra cheese to this dish which should have given it even more flavor. I don't know why it turned out so poorly but it is not one I will make again.

The egg noodles definitely make the dish. It gives it a consistency that separates it from a regular pasta casserole.  The only changes I made were to substituted an orange pepper and add shredded carrot just to sneak it in.  Next time I would use chunks of pepperoni instead of sliced.  I mixed the cheese in with meat/noodles and put a little extra on top too.  One odd thing, 2 c of noodles didn't seem like enough.  I used 3/4 of a 375 g bag and it was still saucy.

Awesome recipe!!  I'm generally not the cook in our house (eventhough I like to try) and even I couldn't mess this one up.  I think you can pretty much add your own favourite pizza toppings and adjust the amount of cheese to your own liking and it will still turn out great!

Everyone loved it.   Used the recipe as is.  But,  I combined equal parts of sweet sausage and beef, then added about 20 small slices of thick pepperoni.  Then added an extra 4 oz. of spicy tomato paste to the pizza sauce.   Also added a small can of sliced olives.   I don't think that you can make this poorly, just add your favorites.

KIDS LOVED IT!!!.. I did add a fresh whole mild italian sausuge. I scrambled the sausage and the ground beef together. Then I halfed the pepperonis and cooked all the meat together. Drained the grease, and added everything else. Absolutely great combination of flavores. Next time Ill post a picture...I used Ragu Margherita Sauce... great flavor combination... Really set out the pizza taste....

I loved this recipe just as it is, it is very easy to make and tastes great. Instead of regular sized pepperoni, I found mini sized ones at our grocery store and they were perfect for this dish. I made this for my husband and I and there were hardly any left overs! If you're making this for a larger group or just want some left over for another meal, I would suggest doubling this recipe as I'm going to next time. Definitely a keeper!

This was great! I made a few healthy changes. I used whole what pasta, ground turkey, turkey pepperoni and reduced fat mozzarella. I will definitely make again.

This was tasty and easy! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used turkey pepperoni. Next time I will add a little crushed red pepper and maybe some mushrooms.

Loved this recipe! Thanks for sharing. The only thing I would do different next time would be to add sausage instead of ground beef, add a little more pizza sauce and a little more cheese. (These are a personal preference though.) Fantastic as is!

Just eh.  I was really disappointed with this recipe, after reading all of the reviews.  I followed the directions to a T, and this tastes nothing like pizza - (the opinions of me, my husband, and my son).  It is certainly edible, but don't get your hopes up.

This is a great go-to recipe, one that everybody likes, and is very easy to throw together.  I use rotini instead of egg noodles, because I find that they stand up to stirring better and hold more flavor than the recommended egg noodles.  I also quartered the pepperoni, as I found the slices tend to "spoon" together and end up stuck together in stacks in various places about the casserole.  Like most other casseroles, this can be assembled whenever you have time and stored in the fridge until ready to bake - just add on about 5-10 minutes to the baking time.  Thanks for the recipe, Melissa!

I loved this recipe! I used my pizza sauce that I canned this summer (tastes like fresh tomatoes). I also threw in some fresh parsley. I love the ingredients tab on Allrecipes. I just put in pepperoni and ground beef and got this wonderful recipe. Thanks for posting.

We enjoyed this recipe. I did substitute sausage for hamburger. I also added sliced olives and pepper flakes to spice it up. We will make again and again. My 6 yr old said it was his most favorite dinner ever....!

Added a couple extra toppings and used ground turkey and turkey pepperoni instead. If I make it again I think I will skip the ground meat, but liked it overall.

This was really good. I added sun-dried tomatoes, oregano and chili pepper flakes on the top (before the cheese). I baked it an extra 10 minutes because it was a little it runny.

I love throwing this dish together. It's another of those recipes where you can make do with what you have: diced tomatoes work with added oregano and basil, I'd like to try it with egg noodles but I never have them around :) This time I sauteed onions and red peppers with oregano, basil and salt and a little water to soften them up. Added in the pepperoni and leftover meat sauce, the milk and threw it all together. Lovely dinner!

I didn't have egg noodles - so I used spiral pasta (as shown in the featured picture).    It really didn't taste like pizza to me.  In fact - it tasted like my version of spaghetti because I usually add onion/garlic/bell pepper and sometimes pepperoni to my spaghetti sauce.    I guess I was expecting something different, and if I wanted pizza I should have made a pizza :)  My husband liked it because he enjoys any kind of pasta with a red sauce.

I like this well enough, but my daughter HATED it!  She cried when I was telling her to clean her plate and then said I'm not allowed to ever make it again.  Ehhh.... it's good heated up for lunch.  I'll make it when she's at her dad's.

We liked this, but I followed the recipe as is and thought it was kind of bland. I also thought it could have benefited from a full pound of ground beef rather than the half. Next time I attempt this one I'll spice it up a bit.

Very good recipe. My family liked it alot. Next time I will make sure to drain any extra grease off......I usually get 97% lean, not alot to drain, but the pepperoni adds ALOT of oil to the recipe. I will partially cook the pepperoni next time and drain the grease. I also used extra cheese. Other wise is delicious.

I thought this was a very good family dish.  Although it wasn't spectacular it is economical and has a good pizza flavor.  I omitted the onion but added mushrooms, extra cheese and pepperoni (as I would on a pizza - just my personal preference). I cooked the ground beef and noodles, and then assembled everything but milk and chesse in advance so I could just bake when desired later that day. I mixed the milk just before putting in the oven and added the cheese per the recipe.  That worked out well.

High 5 from the family.....used ziti instead of egg noodles. I did use the whole box of pasta and upped the amount of sauce. A very hearty and filling casserole with a ton of goodies in it. Served with garlic bread. This would be great for a crowd. Thanks!

This was very tasty and quick. I made it just like written the first time and the second time with half onion, half red bell pepper, turkey pepperoni and ground turkey and it turned out even better than the first time.  Next time just doubling this since I everyone finishes it up before I could get to it.

Pretty good.  Whole family liked it.  I ended up cooking more noodles, adding more cheese, and more sauce.  Not going to make my regular menu, but will make occasionally.

Love this casserole!  I've made different variations of this recipe since I found it - sometimes add diced tomatoes, chopped olives, mushrooms - whichever we feel like having on our "pizza" that night.  Great quick casserole.  Also, easy to prepare ahead of time, refrigerate or freeze, and then pop in later!

I thought this recipe was just okay. Not bad, just okay. The best thing about it is the convenience of making it. I used Rotini instead of egg noodles and added more cheese. Even though I used pizza sauce, I didn't think it tasted like pizza. I think everyone else (parents and boyfriend) liked it more than I did.

Everyone in my family of five loves this, which is a huge feat.  Next time I'll mix all the cheese in, instead of having it on top.  Otherwise it is great as written.

We LOVED this recipe. Every time I make it, it's different! Sometimes I even add sausage to suit my hubby's tastes. He loves it, he asks for it at least once a week. I use any kind of pasta I have on hand. I like rotini the best!

My husband said it needed more spice and my daughter said she was only eating it because she was really hungry. Not a ringing endorsement, but I'm still giving it 4 because it may have just been bad judgement on my part in choosing to make this recipe.

I've never given a bad review so this is my first. I followed recipe step for step and it just wasn't good for us. My 2 year old wouldn't touch it and my husband and I didn't get the Wow the other people did. I'm sure it was just a personal prefrence though.

We love this recipe.  Tastes sooo good.  I omit the onions and add onion powder just because the hubby and I dont like biting into onions.  Add sausage and use presliced pepperoni which I cut into quarters.  We love cheese, so I layer slices of mozz in and we add more to the top.  Its become a weekly staple in our house.

Tasted really good but lacked a little something extra. Maybe a 1/4 tsp of oregano or something. I did add a dash of ranch dressing to the sauce before cooking. My wife and kids really liked it.

Simple, hearty, and definetly a hit with the kids. Hubby loved it too, even though at first he said 'PIZZA casserole??' I will definetly make this again, I used rotini pasta instead of egg noodles, and added mushrooms. Great quick casserole!

This is so quick, easy and good! DH and grandsons loved it! Used rotinin and I didn't have pizza sauce so I sub'd spaghetti sauce. Didn't have onion or garlic so used dried onion flakes and garlic powder. Added a bit of Italian seasoning. Forgot to add the milk but it didn't seem to be an issue.

Great recipe!  I used the Easy Pizza Sauce recipe from this site, I didn't have egg noodles so I used rotini and all I had was sliced pepperoni, and colby jack cheddar cheese blend.  We all thought this recipe was fantastic!  My family asked me to add this to the weekly recipe list.  Thank you Melissa for a family fun and friendly dish!

I scaled it down by 1/2, used rotini pasta and added some mozzarella between 2 layers of the meat and pasta mix as recommended by other reviers. I used about 2 1/2 cups of mozzarrella total. It was totally excellent! Thank you!

This was quick and easy and tasted pretty good. I used meat mixture left over from stromboli's and added the rest of the pizza sauce from them as well. Mixed with pasta and cheese and baked. Will probably make again. Thanks

This was really good! I added mushrooms to the meat while I was browning it and then addded olives and cheese to the pasta mixture right before I placed it in the baking dish.  Next time I am going to add some Jalapeno to make it a little spicy.  My boyfriend loved it, he said its a dish he definately wants me to make again!

Pretty good stuff.  Kids loved it.  I mixed it all up with some cheese and put it in a deep dish pizza pan to cook it; then added more cheese the last ten minutes. Thanks for a keeper, Melissa!

I was not a fan of this recipe!  With all the ingredients I thought it would have more flavor.  Could just be me but I was disappointed.  I tried it and probably won't make again.  Different strokes for different folks I guess!

As is, this wasn't our favorite, but I appreciate the possibilities with this recipe. I think if I had omitted the pepperoni, we would have enjoyed it much more. I'll try it again to see if we like it better with other pizza toppings.

This was absolutely yummy.  If I were going to make any changes, the only change I might make would be to substitute sausage instead of the beef just to give it a little more Pizza flavor.  Will be making this again and again.

This recipe was awesome!!!!  I used ground italian sausage instead of ground beef.  Made it that much better!  And I also cut back the green pepper to about 1/4 of the pepper.

This was fabulous, the only change I made was I added 1 can (14.5 oz) of diced tomatoes so that the casserole would not be too dry.  It is wonderful reheated and a breeze to make!  I will definitely be making this again!

I will definitely make this again.  The only change I made was using turkey pepperoni, which I sliced into quarters.  Next time I may add a few more egg noodles and sauce.  Very good!

My son loved this. I made it with what we normally put on pizza, Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives. It is a nice casserole to have in the fridge for when he gets done with track practice or after school

Excellent!!  We used chorizo instead of ground meat and whole wheat spiral pasta instead of egg noodles.  We also used a pepperoni stick and cut it up into pieces instead of pre-cut slices.

Very good with a few minor changes.  Placed a layer of mozzarella, romano, and parmasean cheese in middle of casserole.  Placed same combination on top during last 5 minutes of cooking.  Also did not use pepperoni (not a fan) and used a little more lean ground beef.

If you are a cheese lover: without a doubt, double the cheese!  Either put it all on top or layer it.  Mine came out quite spicy...I'm not sure why!  Maybe it was the pre-cooked and sliced pepperonis.  I'm not a big fan of peppers, but I like the flavor they give so I just picked them out.  The best thing about this recipe is how versatile it is....you could do a million things with it!  But I pretty much followed it like it is (except double the cheese) and it's amazing.  Thanks!

To make this a bit healthier, I made a few changes to the recipe:  I substituted ground turkey (85/15) for the ground beef and turkey pepperoni for the regular pepperoni.  I used red pepper instead of green (just personal preference). I also made my own pizza sauce (can of tomato, 2 chopped roma tomatoes, garlic, oregano, basil and parsley.) This came out very well!  My husband and I both enjoyed it. I will probably make again.  thanks :)

Simple but wonderful recipe. My 3 pizza fanatics loved this dish and were asking for more. I used 1 lb sage pork sausage, 1 lb ground chuck and a entire package of pepperoni slices (personal preference). I added the garlic, onions and sliced mushrooms to the meat mixture. I also used 1 jar of marinara sauce and 1 jar of pizza sauce. I also used 3/4 of a package of no egg yolk noodles. Covered dish with pizza blend cheese.My goal was to make enough for a 9x13 dish.

My roommate really liked it, but I found the green peppers too overpowering (although I like my food fairly plain).  We also cut down the onion to about 1/2 an onion.

Loved this recipe.  I used 12oz Lowfat Jimmy Dean Sausage instead of ground beef.  Hubby won't eat peppers so omitted that.  My picky 3 year old gobbled it up!

Good recipe.  I made it as written and it turned out exactly what I expected it to.  It's not a fancy meal but good for a midweek meal.  If you are going to be eating this straight after making this there is no need to put it in the oven, just mix in the cheese.  Saves dirtying another dish and saves a bit of time.

Easy to make and so good!  You can definitely add more veggies that you would normally put on a pizza if you wanted to.  I think next time I'd use more ground beef and pepperoni, throw in some mushrooms as well.  Serve with some garlic bread... amazing!  Thank you for the recipe :)

It was really good, but needs some changes. I'll make it again but add more meat. A lot less sauce, and more noodles.

It was good. My kids loved it. We added black olives and mushrooms. I didn't have onion and bell pepper but I will add them next time. We also added extra cheese. Thanks!

This is a great recipe!!  Something the whole family loves.  I have made it several different ways.  You can pretty much add any pizza topping and it just adds to the flavor.  I have made it with beef and ground turkey.  It is good both ways!!!

This was a very tasty, easy recipe to make.  However, I did make a few adjustments to "rev." up the flavor a bit to our liking and preferences:  I used rotini noodles in lieu of the egg noodles (they clump less); I used 1/2 pound hot Italian sausage in lieu of the ground beef; I used four cloves of garlic; I omitted the bell pepper (we don't get it on our pizzas); I sliced the pepperoni pieces in half for better blending in the casserole and used Turkey pepperoni to cut the fat;  I used almost 3/4 of a 32 ounce jar of pizza sauce (I don't like my pasta casseroles dry); and probably closer to 6 oz. of shredded Italian cheese blend in lieu of mozzarella.  It was yummy!  Will definitely make again!

delish! versitile and pretty quick & easy. I used whole grain rotini and turkey pepperoni. I also added some italian seasoning & garlic salt to the ground beef and I added sliced black olives when we topped with mozz. This is one of the best casserole ideas and recipe, that I have found. will definately make again! Thanks!

Very easy recipe, and quite good.  It really did taste like pizza!  We love any kind of pasta and casserole in our family, and this was a great mixture of the two!  I would certainly make it again!

I am so glad I tried this out.  Not really expecting much, and neither was the family, this was all devoured in record time.  I put mushrooms, pepperoni, onions, mozzarella and colby cheese in this.  I also used elbow macaroni, as it was all I had.  FABULOUS

This is an easy and tasty recipe provided you use a good pizza sauce. I layered the casserole with cheese and it turned out great. I would make this again, but I am still searching for a good pizza sauce to use.

Exceptional, and so easy!  My husband took one bite and said this one's a keeper.  I added a jar of sliced mushrooms (drained) and omitted the green pepper due to personal preference. I also followed other's suggestion and stirred in a cup of shredded mozzarella into the mixture, then topped with more mozzarella at the end.  Really delicious!  Will definitely be making this one regularly.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was a hit with the whole family.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because I think it would be better if you mixed some cheese with the casserole instead of putting it all on the top.

My family loved this one.  I was told to add this to the regular rotation.  I doubled the recipe the second time I made it. Even the baby (18mo picky eater) had seconds.  I was told to put this in the regular rotation.  Pretty much the only thing I did differently was to add some seasonings: garlic, oregano, etc we like a little more cheese than stated. But this is very good as written.

Everyone loved it.  I added black olives and didn't measure cheese so I know I put more in it than it called for.  Well be making this again.

This really is a great recipe!  I made it last night for myself, my husband and 22 month old daughter.  I cut everything up a bit smaller for her but it was a big hit with my family.  I did add a little bit of extra cheese that I mixed in and then topped it off with.  I also used spiral noodles instead of egg.  Next time I think I'll add olives.  Yummy!

All in all this is a very good recipe with lots of room to make changes to suit your personal taste at the time. Just like when you order or make pizza.   Tonight spicy sausage with onion, tomorrow ground beef witrh red pepper.   Enjoy and have fun!!

This was really great, but it tasted like it was missing something. That's when we realized I forgot to add the pepperoni! I will make this again and I will remember to add all the ingredients along with extra cheese.

This is a very simple and fun dish to prepare.  I followed the recipe to the letter except I added 1 lb of hamburg instead of 1/2 lb.  I also added some extra sauce because I was afraid it would dry out.  Great kid friendly recipe.

Very good! I'll make this again. I served it with a green salad and garlic bread, and my family really liked it. I would say this makes 4-6 servings. The only change I made was to add more cheese. Mixed some in with the casserole, and then put some more on top.

I made this for my family and they LOVED it!!!  I used the penne pasta, with ground beef, hot ground sausage and pepperoni, added one can of diced italian tomatoes and 28 oz. of pizza sauce, italian and mozzerella cheese, a little cajun seasoning to give it a kick and 1 tablespoon of sugar.  I made a huge pyrex dish and it was 3/4th gone in one sitting.

I am giving this four stars, because to make it five stars I had to adjust the recipe.  I added black olives, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese, fresh grated parmesan cheese, and sharp cheddar cheese, and Chef Paul Prudhomme's Herbal Pizza & Pasta Magic seasoning blend.   I did use 1/2 lb ground beef, approx. 4 oz of pepperoni slices quartered, 4 3/4 cups cooked elbow macaroni, 26 oz. can of Classico Italian sausage pasta sauce, 1/2 can of diced tomatoes (that I processed till smooth) and approx 1/3 cup milk.  I kinda eyeballed the liquids ( I make casseroles often and can kinda know when they have enough liquid).  I followed the directions and then mixed everything together in a big bowl.  I seasoned extra well Herbal seasoning and salt, onion powder, and garlic powder as well.  I mixed in one cup of mozzarella, 3/4 cup cheddar, and 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese as well as most of the olives and mushrooms.  I baked in 2 1/2 qt casserole and a 1 1/2 qt casserole dish ( yes, it made a ton of casserole)for 50 minutes until it was bubbling in the middle.  I added 1 cup of mozzarella and 1/2 cup of cheddar mixed together on the top.  Then I sprinkled with some onion, bellpepper, olives, mushrooms and whole pepperoni slices I set aside for the top of the casserole. Put in over for about 7 minutes until cheese was melted.  I swear this was the best casserole I have made yet.  My husband kept saying "Will you please move this pot so I won't get anymore!!!!"  I am pregnant and have

Really great! A great and innovative way to change up a casserole. I used more sauce and like another commentor I added an extra layer of cheese in the middle because my family is full of cheese lovers. Definitally a keeper!

When listing ingredients that are normally packaged by weight - noodles, don't use volume measurements i.e. 2 cups.  In this case, if you assumed the 1 cup = 8 oz conversion and used 16oz noodles, there were entirely too many noodles.  The 8oz pepperoni was close to the 1 cup the recipe called for.

It's not pizza but it is a great casserole!  I did use sausage instead of gr meat and radiatore pasta instead of egg noodles.  It was a hit with my family.

YUM!  Recipe turned out VERY dry.  I used 1.5 jars of pizza sauce.  I will either add more pizza sauce or cover for part of the baking time next time I make this one.  I will probably try italian sausage instead of pepperoni next time too.

I made this last night for dinner.  I kinda used this as a clean out the cupboards meal... used my leftover pepperoni (not nearly as much as called for), leftover ground turkey, leftover onion, leftover egg noodles and leftover cheese (more than called for).  It was quite good and very easy to make. I also only used a 14 oz container pizza sauce because that was what I found in the store.  This fed two adults for 1 meal and we have probably just enough leftovers for tonight for both of us (with adding some more items).  We ate more than I expected.

Delicious recipe. To make the dish less fattening, I used turkey sausage,turkey pepperoni, and low-fat pizza cheese instead of ground beef and regular pepperoni/cheese. I also added some black and green olives, Parmesan cheese, and crushed red pepper. I will definitely make this again for my family of five.

Trying new things, family seems bored with same dinners (me too!!).  They ALL loved it, usually someone does not; but not with this.  Was sceptical of using egg noodles, but came out fine.  Will definetly make again.

I just used more beef and more pasta, but it turned out great!  My husband enjoyed it so much he was groaning from fullness, my son...well once the pepperoni and cheese was gone, he was done.  I thought it was ok, nothing to write home about.  I will make it again.

This was very good and easy to make the only things I added was 5 oz mushrooms because we love mushrooms and mixed a handful of cheese to the mix before baking, everyone loved it including my 3 yr old

The only thing that I changed was I doubled the sauce and the amount of the cheese.  I took it to a potluck and received alot of compliments.

GREAT recipe...made 2x in 2 weeks per request. Used italian sausage instead of beef and can use marinara sauce or spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce. It turned out fine. Also cooked peppers, onions and pepperoni before mixing... read others review. Great one dish meal.

Very good and easy to assemble - will definately make again!  I used rigatoni pasta instead of noodles - I think a dish with an Italian theme needs pasta instead of noodles.

Swany and I liked but Andy didn't.  Katie didn't try and Tim was gone.  Serving size 7 would probably feed 3-4 if boys are hungry!  Quartered the pepperoni and no green pepper.

My family loved this. I mis-read the .5 lb meat as 1.5 so it had lots. I used italian sausage and some ground beef. I added sliced olives and a couple handfuls mozzarella to the mix. plus sprinkled some on top. little less onion and extra garlic. we are a family of 6 and it was not enough even with the extra meat. will add more pasta next time. thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was very good and really simple. I added black olives and mushrooms and used a mix of mozzerella and provolone cheese. The only problem was that it said 7 servings but only made about 4 in our house!

This recipe was a bit dry.  It had mediocre flavor.  I used onion, mushrooms, green pepper, pepperoni, mozarella and even ground beef.  I think it needed more pizza sauce.  It was just ok, not sure I'd bother making it again.

Very easy and delicious!!  I used meatless crumbles instead of ground beef, dropped the pepperoni and added sundried tomatoes.  (that's what we had in the house at the time - we're not vegetarians, we just shop that way!!)This casserole lasted mere minutes.  My husband and 2 year old LOVED it.

I had to leave out the pepperoni because I didn't have any. I halved the onion, left out the green pepper and doubled the ground beef to compensate for no pepperoni. Didn't turn out as well as I hoped (probably because the pepperoni is the main flavoring). Need to add some salt to it to bring out a little more flavor. Probably needs more cheese as well. My kids liked it though and that's hard to do sometimes.

Excellent dish.Super easy.Could be a 5 star cuz you could even make it better.I added hot pizza sausage,a can of black olives,mushrooms,and also used mini penne pasta which i think is perfect.I see no need to even put this dish in the oven.It dried it out a little.Its great as a skillet dish.I will make this again,but even better.

This was very good .... but I didn't get the "pizza" connection while eating it. With noodles (regardless of type) baked in a casserole dish it's a CASSEROLE !!! I followed the recipe exactly in terms of preparation; added the recommended red pepper flakes, mushrooms, and garlic and really thought it was good -PASTA. I'd make it again, just like it's written, but wouldn't promote it's pizza-like flavor to anyone.

Excellent, easy, tasty recipe.  This is not your usual pasta casserole.  The pepperoni gives it a little tang and a very usual taste.  I fixed this for a group and they loved it.

This recipe is sooo easy, versatile, and tastes great! Definitely a keeper. I kept everything the same but used low fat motz shredded cheese and turkey pepperoni. I added some italian seasonings while the beef was cooking. I also quartered the pepperoni before adding them. Delish!

This recipe is tasty, but I don't see any advantage to cooking it in a crock pot. Baking it in a casserole dish in the oven would be better. I didn't pre-cook the pasta and cooked all the ingredients mixed up for 5 hours, which was plenty of time. The slow-cooker advantage of leaving it all day is lost because if you cook it any longer than 5 hours it will turn into burned mush.

This was great and easy, too!  The family loved it with thumbs up to add it to our dinner rotation.  I doubled the recipe, subbed sausage for the ground beef, omitted the bell peppers and mixed in half of the shredded mozz, then baked in a 9x13 dish. I served it with a salad and the meal was very filling. It was great to see the all 3 kids' plates clean!  There are 5 of us and we only ate 1/3 of the dish and froze the rest.  The kids have already asked when we're going to have it again!

This recipe was very fast and easy! I made only a few slight changes, just for preference, I added mushrooms and a can of diced tomatoes, drained. I also mixed in some of the cheese and used penne pasta in place of the egg noodles. I think any short cut pasta will taste fine. My husband loved this recipe. The second time I made it, I doubled the amount. After making this a few times, I used a similar technique and mixed pasta, cheese, pizza sauce, ham and pineapple for a Hawaiian casserole. YUM! Thanks for the great and fun recipe!

This was a great recipe.  My family loved it and even my two year old very picky eater asked for more.  I put 2 cups of mozz and two cans of mushrooms.  I also mixed all together in the casserol dish instead of the skillet.  Alot easier that way.  i also used the corkscrew noodles instead of egg noodles.  This is definately going to become a regular in our house.

Fantastic.  I use homemade marinara sauce rather than pizza sauce and ground turkey rather than beef (you would never know the difference).  While I was making this, I kept thinking that it wasn't going to be enough pasta and way too much of the other ingredients, but the proportions were actually quite nice.  I also use 2 cups of cheese.  I layer half the mixture in the dish, then sprinkle with 1 cup cheese, then add the other half of the mixture, then bake as directed.  I add the other cup of cheese after 20 minutes, bake for 5 minutes, then broil for a few minutes to give it that nice crunchy, browned top.

This was a great, simple recipe. I made only a couple of changes so I could use ingredients I had on hand. Instead of pepperoni I browned half a pound of sausage with the hamburger, onion, and peppers. I used about 50% more cheese, and followed another reviewers idea of putting part of the cheese in the middle. Since I was pressed for time I microwaved at 80 power for 6 minutes. I'm sure it would have browned nicely in the oven, but didn't want to wait. Good stuff!

Very tasty pasta dish! I followed the directions except leaving out the pepperoni and using 1 lb of veggie meat for the ground beef. I was also thinking while making it that it would be easy to cut down on the number of dishes by putting the pasta and other ingredients back into the pasta pan after the hot water is drained. It would not get a crisp cheese crust but it would save a dish.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It's great because you can add your own favorite pizza toppings. We used pepperoni, hamburger, bacon, sausage, onion, and jalapeno.

after a few modifications this was very tasty!  As writted it didn't have a lot of flavour.  I used hot and spicy pizza sauce, olives, mushrooms, oregano, basil, salt & pepper.  Pretty much anything you would put on pizza will go well in this dish!

Great base recipe. Easy to adapt to our favorite pizza toppings.  I used four cheese pasta sauce for pizza sauce (what I had)-worked well. Omitted the green peppers. Like others I put half  of the filling in the casserole and topped with cheese then the rest of the filling and continued as the recipe directs. Next time I plan on adding  mushrooms and olives,& use penne for the noodles. Thanks for the  tasty recipe, perfect pot luck option too!

I liked the overall flavor of this meal.  I used rigatoni and added canned sliced mushrooms.  Next time I would skip the green pepper and add sliced black olives, more pizza sauce (I thought it was too dry) and more cheese.

I wasn't sure about the measurements so I changed those up a bit. I used penne pasta and sweet italian sausage instead of the pepperoni. I also used cilantro with the onions, garlic and green pepper to. My family loved this recipe. I will be making this again!

This recipe was alright but it didn't really taste like pizza, and the flavor wasn't anything awesome. I didn't have pepperoni so I added mushrooms. I also added oregano, basil, and parsley. I used egg noodles as specified, but I think someone else recommended rotini and I agree. If I make this again, I'll alternate layers of the beef noodle mixture, a flavorful cheese blend (maybe mozzarella, feta, and parmesan), and Italian bread crumbs.

This was good and even better the second day.  My husband is diabetic so I changed it up, some, plus I can't leave a recipe alone.  I used whole wheat pasta, turkey pepperoni (1/2 pkg), added mushrooms and black olives and fat-free mozarella with a few slices of provolone on top. My husband said he would eat it again.

Excellent after these changes.  1/4 lb. hamburger meat 2 sweet italian sausage links 1/2 cup turkey pepperoni   Sweet italian sausage is often confused with the italian sausage on your pizza, but couldn't be more different excellent addition to any italian dish.  To cook slit open the casing and sautee the sausage after removing the casing.  I used a regular pizza sauce but found it too sweet and lacking any depth of flavor so I added 3 or 4 tbsp of a good pesto and some crushed red pepper.  Invest in a good cheese and sprinkled a little  parmesan to top it off.  Wonderful aroma delicious dish!

This was actually better than I was expecting it to be!  I used penne instead of egg noodles because I think that I probably the worst part of the recipe.  I imagine that the egg noodles would get mushy and kind of "get lost" in this.  Penne worked very well, though.  I also used sausage instead of burger because that's how we like our pizza!  It took more sauce to make this the consistency that I wanted.  I think it would have been too dry with only 1 jar.  I also added extra cheese because we are cheese freaks.  While it won't go in regular rotation, I will certainly keep this one around!

Big hit with my family.  I used whole wheat penne and made my own pizza sauce.  Used turkey pepperoni cut up.  Next time I might try it with bacon and/or sausage, and I'll definitely up the amount of cheese.  Thanks for the good recipe!

This was really good! I didn't measure anything, I roughed chopped my onion and green peppers, I added tomatoes and mushrooms. I didn't use pepperoni because my family doesn't like it so I used 1/2 pound of italian sausage. For extra flavor I added a tablespoon of italian seasoning. Topped with both mozzarella and pizza cheese and served with garlic bread. Awesome!

This was pretty good. I doubled the amount of sauce and it was still a little dry.  Kinda tasted like a boxed meal.  That's not always a bad thing!  But I'd like to experiment with this recipe quite a bit next time.  Fantastic idea, great base recipe that I'll use and build on to suit our tastes.  Thanks!

A delicious, hearty, wonderful comfort food! I used pasta sauce instead of pizza sauce (can't find it where I'm at), sprinkled some herbs de provence on the top, rigatoni noodles rather than egg noodles, and a bit more cheese. SO GOOD! I'll be making many times since my husband has requested it twice in the past 2 weeks. It doesn't last long in our house! Thanks for the recipe!

I think this is one of those recipes that appeal to some and not others.

I absolutely hated it and everyone else liked it.

I would not make it again.

Very good was even good for left overs. My noodles got a little mushy but that was my fault so next time i'm going to watch them a little closer.

Very very good!  My husband and two year old wolfed it down!  I cooked it exactly following the recipe.  Except: I always get confused about 2 c noodles - is that 16 oz? or two dry cups? so I measured 2 cups, and then didn't think that looked like enough, so I added 2 more cups.  When I added the sauce and milk, I thought it looked a bit dry, so I added 1 cup more sauce and 2T more milk.  It was wonderful!  The flavors were even stronger the next day as leftovers.  My hubby hates leftovers, but he was excited to be eating this again!  Yay!

I have made this on many occasions now and my family just raves each time!  I originally made this step by step and they loved it but since then I have made some changes.  I have to cut up the pepperoni because of my little one and I add at least one can of mushrooms.  I also use spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce and I also use pizza cheese instead of just the mozzarella.  The family loves it and even my picky dh has requested that I keep this recipe!

I'm giving it 5 stars because my husband raved about it!  I changed it marginally just because we like leftovers.  I doubled the amount of noodles, cheese. and ground beef and didn't use the green pepper.  I didn't double the sauce and I thought it was plenty saucy.  I did add a little black pepper.  All in all it was a pretty good versatile recipe that you can tweak to your own taste quite easily.

This was a great recipe! I used penne in place of the egg noodles (personal preference) and added in sauteed mushrooms as well. I also used turkey pepperoni - what a great substitute with much less fat. Overall a delicious casserole, thanks for sharing the recipe!

I wouldn't say this tasted like pizza exactly, but it was very good.  I used 1/2 lb. of sweet italian turkey sausage in place of the ground beef.  Also, I added about 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning.  Next time, I will add more cheese (probably a layer in the middle) and a can of sliced mushrooms.

I used rigatoni and ground venison instead of egg noodles & beef. Turned out great! I added sliced black olives and a little more sauce & green pepper than called for. Will be making again! Great thing about it is you can add anything you want. Next time: sliced mushrooms & green olives.

Easy to assemble and tasted good!  I used macaroni noodles (didn't have egg noodles), pre-sliced pepperoni and marinara sauce instead of pizza sauce.  My husband liked it and that's always important! :)

I used this recipe last night and it was amazing. Everyone from 2 to 70 thought it was absolutely delicious. I am usually a pinch of this, dash of that type person when I actually do cook but for the most part I followed this recipe exactly adding only a little extra sauce and cheese to use what I had leftover. I would highly recommend this recipe and will be using it again. Thank you.

The thing I love about recipes like this is that you can add anything you want to it! I skipped the meat and added some squash, whole tomatoes, extra peppers and onions and some extra cheese. It was so easy and very good. thank you!

Really liked this recipe!  My 20 year old son who can be particular loved it!  

I did have to make a few changes just due to what I had in the house at the time and personal preferences.

Eg. No peppers, spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce, garlic powder instead of cloves and added some mozarella and cheddar in the dish as well as on top to make it cheesier!

Way to go Melissa!  Good recipe.

This was very veryy tasty although I did make a few modifications. First, my boyfriend is a huge sauce fan and I am a cheese lover so my modifications make it extra cheesy and saucy and delicious. i did about 24oz of pizza sauce and it was the perfect amount. Also, I did about a cup and a half of cheese mixing half a cup in with the the rest of the mix and bake as directed, using the other cup of cheese for the top. I also use Krafts four cheese pizza mix. Also, other good additions are mushrooms and diced olives. enjoy!

Delicious!!  I made some changes -- I'm allergic to tomotoes, so I used NoMato sauce.  I used 2 cups of whole wheat rotini, 1 lb. ground beef, 1/2 green pepper, 1/2 red pepper, 1/4 lb hard salami and half and half instead of milk.  These changes were just based on what I had in the fridge.  I also had a can of olives so I added that.  It was amazing and will be added to our rotation!!!

My kids loved this dish.  I omitted the bell pepper and instead of using store bought pizza sauce I made my own using 1 - 15 ounce can tomato sauce, 1 - 6 ounce can of tomato paste, 1 tablespoon oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1 teaspoon paprika.  Mix all these ingredients in a bowl and taste for salt and pepper.

Yum! This was easy and delicious. I didn't use the green pepper (personal preference), and I used a small stick of pepperoni that I diced (I think it gets less greasy than the slices). I mixed in 1/2 of the cheese before putting in the oven. Then I topped it with the remaining cheese for the last 5 minutes.

This has been my husband's favorite dish so far. While I was browning the meat I added garlic. Once I drained the meat I added some cayenne pepper and a little bit of minced onion (my kids don't really like onion so I wanted to add a hint of onion). Also, instead of mixing the cheese, meat, noodles, pepperoni and sauce all together. I put the a little of the sauce on the bottom, a layer of cheese, noodles, meat, cheese, sauce, meat, noodles, pepperoni and the rest of the cheese and then baked for 25 minutes at 350. My hsuband said this is the best thing he has ever tasted. Will make again VERY soon :)

This just wasn't good.  I think it's because the pizza sauce is so bland.  Perhaps with a jazzed up pasta sauce, it would be better.  Won't be making again.

This was a tad bland, but I'll try it again sometime. My boyfriend suggested using italian sausage next time instead of the beef. I used ziti pasta and 1 lb of ground beef, also threw in a can of mushrooms. I browned the meat with garlic powder, black pepper, and italian seasoning. I'd suggest putting a layer of cheese in between layers of the pasta/meat mixture to help hold it all together. Put a solid layer of mozzerella on top with pepperonies scattered on top of that. It looked really cute when it came out of the oven. EDIT: This was actually really good warmed up the next day!

This was pretty tasty. I had to double the hamburger (I use mine by the pound) and it was ok. I also cut the green pepper by half and added sliced olives.

Great recipe, with ingredients that I usually have on hand, which is great for last minute meals! I really liked the flavor, but would probably use some red pepper flakes in the future to up the spice.

I made this for my boyfriend and his seven year old last night, subsitituting mushrooms for for most of the green pepper and onion (I added a little of both and did not tell them). It turned out really well and they both ate it, although I thought it could've used a little something; more green pepper and onion perhaps? :)
I would make it again, particularly since they are both such picky eaters.

This was a great recipe! My husband and I loved it. Easy to make and tasty. I used a few extra peppers and added some red pepper flakes for a little heat, just the way we like our pizza. Very versitile. I'll be making it again.

Very good.  I made it with a bit less pepperoni than the recipe called for.  Next time I will try using grd turkey, sweet italian chicken sausage and put crushed red pepper flakes on the table.  The pepperoni was a bit spicy for a 2 1/2 year old but the rest of us loved it.  Also, want to try adding cannelini beans.  Was a nice alternative to baked ziti for using up leftover pasta sauce.  Very easy, fast clean up.

This was a good casserole.  I used 1 pound of ground turkey instead of beef.  I also mixed in 1/2 cup of cheese with the casserole and then also topped it with a cup.  It was simple and fast to put together.

It was pretty good.  Next time I'll use less green pepper, it was a little overpowering.  I didn't really care for the pepperoni, either.  I guess take those things out, and you have a whole different recipe!

I made this last night for husband and I.  It was so good!  There is a lot there for 2 people...so maybe next time I will cut it in half...but something I will for sure make again...its was so good.  I think next time I will add the cheese in to the mix of stuff...and let it melt from the inside.  I also just added slices of pepperoni to it...it gave it more of a pizza taste.  Very good!!!!

ok.  a family pleaser, i guess.  my husband thought it tasted like pizza, though i didn't think it was all that flavorful.  my preschooler and toddler each ate some of it, which is a success around here.

We didn't think it had much of a pizza taste but it was a different casserole with using pepperoni.

This was okay, added my family's favorite pizza toppings mushrooms, onions, etc.  My suggestion is to use more sauce than the recipe calls for because it tends to be on the dry side.

This is really good! My husband is not a fan of anything that entails pasta, but throw pizza ingredients in there and I had a happy man!! Didn't put in the peppers or onions, as we are not huge fans, but it was really good anyways. Will make again!!

I really liked this one! I used my own recipe for homemade spaghetti sauce and rigatoni instead of rotini with more mozzarella than called for. Husband loved it...even better reheated for lunch the day after!

I substituted the green peppers with mushrooms and added a can of diced tomatoes because it seemed a little dry. I also used whole wheat noodles and mixed half the cheese in and put the other half on top. It was good, but I'd rather have regular pizza.

I can tell when a recipe is a keeper when it's quiet at the table and there's no leftovers.  Am going to take others suggestion and add mushrooms next time to add more flavor -- Italian Sausage might work as well.

Nothing spectacular here.  The taste was OK, and it's not like we didn't eat it (heck, I even brought in the leftovers so as not to waste them), but it just didn't "wow" me.  My neighbor stopped by to borrow something as we were sitting down to eat and she thought it was Hamburger Helper.  if you have smaller children, they would probably think it was GREAT!  Thanks anyway.

This was just alright.  Nothing Great.  I thought the texture of the noodles was a little weird - maybe because they were added dry.  Probably won't make again.

WE LOVED THIS! I could have easily doubled this to have leftovers for lunch the next day. I substituted a can of mushrooms for the green pepper. This will be a family standard for us.

Yummy... all of us loved it, even my 2 year old that lately seems to not eat any dinner at all.  I think next time I will add a can of mushrooms to it just for fun.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe for when you're wanting pizza but don't want to order from the same old places for whatever reason.  Instead of egg noodles, I use some form of regular pasta (shells, rigatoni, etc).  You can easily add any other "topping" to this, from sausage to mushrooms, and it will turn out great.

This recipe was great!  I used ground chicken instead of beef, and added mushrooms to make it a true combination style pizza casserole.  I had more meat than the recipe called for so I scaled up the noodles, the sauce and the milk.  The mushrooms made up for not scaling up the green pepper and the amount of pepperoni the recipe called for was perfect, even for the larger casserole.  I also used more cheese because my husband and I are cheese lovers.  Definitely a keeper and leftovers can be frozen for lunches.  Thanks Melissa.
