I did not have pina colada yogurt, I used equal amounts vanilla greek yogurt. The kids and I thought this was really tasty. The coconut, pineapple, raisins and yogurt give it just enough sweetness without going overboard.

I didn't have the pina colada yogurt, so I used plain nonfat greek yogurt and added a bit of honey.  I also used golden raisins (personal preference) and reduced fat mayo.  I made a carrot cake today, and this was the perfect recipe to use up the leftover shredded carrots and pineapple!

I did manage to find the Pina Colada Greek Yogurt. If you can't find it, there are several tropical blends that should fit the bill. I used golden raisins. We had it for Easter and it was a hit!

I loved this salad!  I must admit, though, that I took it to a party and brought a significant amount home.  Though no one said anything, I don't think the other guests loved it as much as I did.  This recipe reminds me of the salad from Chick Filet.  I followed the directions with one exception.  I could not find pina colada flavored yogurt, so I substituted toasted coconut instead.  I also bought pineapple yogurt and will try that when I make this again.

I didnâ€™t have pina colada yogurt, so used vanilla.   It was still delicious!   I also used fresh pineapple, which I think is better.   I will definitely make this again.
