Not bad. I used this as a basic guideline. I used red instead of green pepper, added mushrooms, and omitted the garlic. I used a vegetable seasoning blend instead of the salt & pepper. I also just eyeballed all the veggies & ham instead of measuring it (as I do for most recipes). I made fried potatoes and onions to go with this and some toast. A nice light dinner!

Yum! Although I made a few changes it was still fantastic. I used red onion and didn't put any ham in it. I thought it probably needed something more, so I added some chinese five spice. It seemed a little weird at first but it really gave it what it needed! Amazing!

Really good.  We liked the flavor of the parmesan with it.  My 10 yo said he loved it, then said it would be even better with tomatoes.  Next time I'll dice some and throw them in.

Pretty good....doubled recipe and used leftover ham from Easter that was frozen and thawed. Also used a container of egg substitute.  Added some chopped tomatoes and fresh basil. Thanks!
