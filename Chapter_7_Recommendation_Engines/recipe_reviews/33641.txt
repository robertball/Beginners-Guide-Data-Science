If you're looking for a light textured, slightly sweet cornbread......This is for you.  My husband doesn't even like sugar in his cornbread and we finished off the whole batch of them last night with our Gumbo!!  As he is stuffing his face he's reminding me "I don't like sugar in my cornbread!"  Guess that isn't true anymore.  It only took 20 minutes to bake.  30 would have been too long. Also, didn't have buttermilk---substituted 1 TBsp. vinegar in 1 c. milk (let it sit for 5 minutes first).  I'll be making this again for sure!! EDIT: Just made this again so I could submit a photo of it.I used yellow cornmeal. I had maybe 2 tsp. of baking powder left (much less than called for) and my cornbread came out great again! Second EDIT: I realized that I left out the fact that when making cornbread I always place my greased pan IN the preheated oven til it gets hot...that way, when you pour your cornbread batter in, it forms a really nice 'crust' on the bottom of the cornbread.

I made this to go with dinner at bible study and it was a hit!  Will certainly be making this again!  The only change I made was to use yellow corn meal, as that was what I had on hand, and to use soured milk (1c. milk with 1-2Tbsp. vinegar)and veggie oil, not corn.  Awesome recipe!

Simply wonderful, no changes need. (Well I did sub yellow cornmeal since I don't have white, but I'm sure white would have been just as fabulous!) Serve warm with a drizzle of honey for the best dadgummed cornbread you've ever had.

This is a great cornbread recipe.  It came out fluffy and it was not sweet. I love it. I did not have buttermilk so I just used the milk I had on hand.  Thanks for the recipe.

I only made one change and that was using melted butter instead of corn oil. I baked this in my cast iron skillet--I just added a couple tablespoons of butter to my cast iron skillet and let it melt in the skillet while the oven preheated before I added the batter. 350* for just about 30 minutes. This reminds me of MY grandmother's johnnycake which is such a wonderful feeling as I miss her terribly. I'll make this again.

Just what I was looking for.  Changes made:  whole wheat flour, yellow corn meal, and milk soured with lemon juice since I had no buttermilk, cooked in iron skillet.  Great texture and good flavor.  Thanks.

My husband is a diabetic & with my diabetic friendly changes he said it's one of the best cornbreads I've made. I used skim milk/vinegar for the buttermilk. Less baking powder - about 3 t, whole wheat flour & splenda instead of sugar. Poured a bit of oil in my square pan & heated it up with the oven. 30 minutes would have been way too long. I took mine out at 20.

This cornbread is absolutely amazing!  I used a larger rectangular pan so it was probably a little bit flatter than normal, but it only took 15 mins. in the oven and tastes great.  It was eaten up in one night.  I will definitely be making this often!

I was all excited to try this out and then at the last minute saw that my cornmeal was expired so i couldn't follow it exactly. Then i discovered i had a packet of Martha White Sweet Yellow Cornbread Mix (7 oz. size). To the mix i added 1 cup Buttermilk, 1 Egg, and 1/4 C. Veg Oil and mixed it together and spread it in an oiled loaf pan. I baked it at 400 degrees for about 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted came out clean. This was the BEST TASTING CORNBREAD i have ever eaten in my life. So, if you don't have plain cornmeal on hand, and you have a packet .. just make it the way i did. I can't wait to try this recipe again. Thanks!!!!  Yummo!!!!!!!!!!

I was looking for a recipe that isn't too sweet since i had a pot of chili on the stove cooking and my favorite cornbread recipe was missing (we just moved). This looked fairly similar and the recipe was followed to the letter but it was awful. Perhaps the 4 tsp of baking powder? It was slightly bitter and salty to me and I'm a salt lover! I would not recomend. We threw most of it away. Disapointing since it had recieved good reviews.  LT

FIrst of all, I love a great story with a recipe.  That is what first captured my attention. Secondly, this is the best cornbread recipe ever. My husband told me absolutely not to lose this recipe. I did not change a thing. Thanks so much for sharing!

When making true southern cornbread, using a  pre-heated, oiled (two tbs.) cast iron skillet makes a big difference.  When you pour the batter in, it sizzles and forms a nice crust as it bakes. Yum.

This turned out soft and crumbly, with a great cornmeal crunch.  We do drizzle the bread with honey for a treat.  There's nothing like warm cornbread and honey!

I have been looking for a good cornbread recipe for a while and I found it today. I did add about a half cup of brown sugar, I like sweet cornbread. I preheated my cast iron skillett in the oven, and then added 1 tablespoon of butter before I added the mixture,  the result a moist, sweet and perfect cornbread.  Thank so much to you and your great grandmother.

I used yellow corn meal as that's what I had and this still turned out GREAT!  Very easy.  Delicious.  Check it around 20 min as mine didn't need a full 30.  Thanks!

This was good.  I made it as directed except used yellow corn meal and vegetable oil.  It was superb.  I preheated my glass baking dish while the oven was warming up and this made a nice crust as others suggested.  This was not too sweet (I don't like cake-like cornbread).  Perfect, I'll make this again and again!

I substituted brown rice flour for the regular flour to make this recipe gluten free!  It took about 25 minutes to cook.  I will definitely make again!

This is exactly the type of cornbread I want to have when sitting in front of a large bowl of beans & ham.  Wonderful!   I too made in preheated cast iron skillet - had 2T of butter melted in same and then used 1/8 cup corn oil in mix.  I only use freshly milled coarse cornmeal and it gave a wonderfully rustic texture to bread.  Just a hint of sweetness, so if you're in the mood for an ooegy-goooey sweet cornbread, this isn't the one - this is the lovely crumbly perch on the side of my bowl of soup, stew, or beans and enjoy type bread.  Mine was perfectly cooked in 23 minutes.

Outstanding! This is the recipe I've been searching for...the perfect corn bread. I did use 1/2 whole wheat flour and the texture was still perfect. Thanks to other reviewers for the tip on heating the pan first for a crispy crust. Super delicious. Thank you!

This is excellent.  My only concern is that 4 teaspoons of baking powder is a lot of sodium in addition to the baking soda and salt.  I used 3 teaspoons and it cam out perfect.  Next time I will try 2 and 1/2.  I also used yellow cornmeal because I like the color.  I like my cornbread with a rich corn flavor so I might play around with adding some pureed corn next time.  As written, this recipe only took about 20 minutes to bake.

This is an exceptional recipe. I only use yellow cornmeal but the rest of the recipe I followed. Cooked in a preheated cast iron skillet. Delicious!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and I wasn't impressed with the results. It was fine, just not really good. I will look for a new recipe next time I make cornbread.

I thought the recipe was very easy but it seemed a little bland. Everyones tastebuds are different and sometimes you just have to adjust things to what you like. I will try it again though maybe I missed something.

A little too crumbly, but that's great when you're crumbling it into chili or southern gumbo.

Nice light texture. I cooked this in a cast iron skillet in the oven for 20 minutes. I used milk/lemon juice instead of buttermilk. Not too sweet for us. This made a decent cornbread, a little grainy but not too much, overall a good solid recipe, but not my favorite one from here. Thanks Charles Kemp for giving us Great Grandmother's cornbread, this was perfect with our chili dinner tonight.

This is an easy recipe that results in really great cornbread.  Like others, I used yellow cornmeal, vegetable oil, and regular milk mixed with 1 T of lemon juice.  I also had to use a metal pan, and found it was done in about 20 minutes.  Thanks!

I have made this cornbread half a dozen times  and make two changes:  first, no sugar...I cannot abide sweet cornbread.  Secondly, I substitute half a stick of melted butter for the vegetable oil.   People assure me it's good, and even though the butter seems to violate the Depression era primitiveness of original Johnnycakes, it makes a big difference.  I like to think the Joad family would like it.

My family loves this recipe and I have made it several times.  In my experience, you cannot substitute yellow cornmeal for the white cornmeal. It does not turn out the same.

Flour to cornmeal should be a 1 to 1 ratio.  Also, for more traditional looking cornbread, yellow cornmeal should be used.  White cornbread is not very appealing to the eye. This recipe is good, but just change the 1/2 c. white cornmeal to 1 cup yellow cornmeal.  Also, I use 1 tsp salt, not 1/2.  I use the rest of the ingredients as stated and it comes out wonderful.

We enjoyed this, after making a few changes in accordance with the opinions of other reviewers. Used yellow corn meal, reduced baking powder to 2 tsp., used slightly less sugar.  It was easy to prepare, and quick to cook - done in about 22-23 min. I was attracted to the recipe because of the story, and the feeling of connection to the early pioneers. Does anyone else remember the old marching jingle, which goes Left, left/ I left my wife and 49 kids/ on the verge of starvation/ without any johnnycake?

Great middle of the road cornbread. Not too sweet. Not too plain. My wife and I were raised on old fashioned, non-sweet bread. For her I would leave out the sugar completely. Some of my family like the real sweet "Jiffy" type. For them I would increase the sugar. To feed a group where the taste may vary, this is an excellent recipe. Just slightly sweet. Great with chicken and dumplins. Great in a glass of cold milk. This is my go-to from now on.

Just okay.  I prefer a denser corn bread. This was very crumbly. Iused yellow cornmeal.  I have used a similar recipe that does not use baking soda so maybe next time I will omit, also may add a bit more sugar.

Phenomenal.  Best cornbread ever.  I used safflower oil, yellow cornmeal, and half the sugar - baked in a hot cast iron skillet.  The "buttermilk" I must use is just 1 cup lactose-free milk + 1 Tbs white vinegar.  I also added about a cup of corn kernels.  It went really fast.

Loved this - used yellow cornmeal and powdered buttermilk and water. Four stars instead of five because the baking time is way off; others seem to have had the same problem! Mine was a breath away from being overdone at not quite twenty minutes. Next time I'd start with 15, or lower the baking temp. Fabulous flavor, though, and just sweet enough! Thanks!

I like this recipe better than I do my own. I used 2 egg whites in place of the egg, replaced 1/4 cup of flour with whole wheat flour and used 3 T of applesauce and 1 T of oil. Even with the changes this came out soft and tasty.

This is the very best cornbread recipe I've ever tried!  25 minutes was all that was required for baking, but I used a glass dish.  It is sweet, light, and wonderful!  My compliments to Great Grandmother Steinbeck!

absolutely the best cornbread i've ever had. iused self-rising corn meal so i added only about 3 tsp of baking powder. i also used wheat flour in place of white, olive oil instead of corn oil, and milk with 1 Tbsp lemon juice instead of buttermilk. delicious!

if i could rate this cornbread with 20 stars i would. after a long search for a really good cornbread recipe i found this one. this is the best cornbread i have ever eaten.  i used bacon grease instead of the corn oil and greased my skillet with it also. i didnt realize i had used self rising cornmeal instead of regular i don't know if adding the extra baking powder and soda made it better or not. i had always used nora mill's recipe (a wonderful grainery in helen georgia) but this was even better. 
thanks granny steinbeck.

YUM! I decreased the sugar to 3 T because I don't like my cornbread really sweet. This was so fluffy and moist; we all loved it!
