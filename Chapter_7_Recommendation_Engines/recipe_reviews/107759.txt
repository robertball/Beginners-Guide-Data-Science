This recipe got a lot of compliments. Including a request for the recipe. Very tasty. I didn't know what a jicama was but it didn't seem to matter. Also once I made it with black eyed beans instead of black beans and that was fine. Delicious!

I used key limes and it was too bitter so I added a spoonful of sugar.  Tasted great.  This is a great fix and leave in the fridge to munch on all week recipe.  Oh and if your like me and you don't like it to be too spicy de-seed your jalapeno before mincing.  That's where most of the spice is.  I did this and it came out just right.  Oh and a Jimica is a round root thingy that has the taste/texture of a cross between an apple and a potato.  Get a small one or it'll take over the salad.  Mine was waay to big and it suffered for it.

This was fabulous! Got many compliments on this dish! I left out both the bell and jalp. peppers b/c my husband hates peppers. Turned out I didn't miss them at all. The jicima however was essential! It gave the salad a nice crisp, crunch. Totally unexpected but very refreshing. Also, you could easily reduce the cheese and oil for a lighter version.

This recipe was a hit at a barbeque. I used a lot less oil (about 1/2 cup). Next time I might add another jalapeno pepper. But It was good as is and very colourful. Thanks for this recipe.

I don't see how anyone can eat this with a full cup of olive oil.  I used half, as others suggested and it was still too much dressing.  I recommend using 1/2 cup olive oil, then add the dressing a little at a time, and check according to your taste.  I did love the combination of flavors of the salad!

We made this tonight for a quick vegetarian dinner and it was delicious. Substituted daikon for jimica since we happened to have one in the fridge and skipped the jalapeno but otherwise we stayed true to the recipe and really enjoyed it. Will definitely make it again.

Because I omitted the jicama, I think I should have used less olive oil.  I only used about 3 oz. of feta and that seemed to be plenty for me.  This was good - very light yet filling for a great summer lunch.  We'll be having this again - thanks!

I made this for a potluck, super easy and tasty! The jicama is necessary for the perfect blend of textures and crunch. I used the following variations: frozen corn, cherry tomatoes quartered, red and yellow bell peppers to equal 1 whole, about 4 oz feta cheese (more would be overpowering), and about 3/4 bunch green onions. I found these proportions to be perfect. 

Tips: pick a small jicama, about the size of a fist. If using frozen corn, let thaw separately and drain the water. Use fresh lime juice - the one in the plastic lime does not have the right flavors and you won't be able to taste lime in the dressing. 

The reason for the 1 star deduction: I don't see how anyone could use an entire cup of oil for this dressing without it being a soupy, oily mess. I'm so glad I used 1/4 cup oil, which was plenty. But if I hadn't read the other reviews, I would have wasted so much oil and the salad would have been inedible. Use 1/4 cup oil, trust me on this. I adjusted the other ingredients accordingly - about 1/2 tsp mustard, 1/2 tsp minced garlic or less. Lime juice, pepper and salt stayed the same.

I served this salad at a Memorial Day party and it was a hit, I had several people ask for the recipe.  I made it exactly the way the recipe is written except I cut the oil in half.  Will definitely make it again!  Oh, and as for the Jicama, I had never heard of it but am now a fan, although you really do only need a small one for this recipe.  Thanks!

Excellent!  Reduced the amount of olive oil to a couple tbsp. and increased the lime juice to 1/2 cup.  Also added lime zest to the salad.  I had to substitute a chayote for the jicama.

This was good although I wasn't amazed by it or anything.  I wish it was a tad spicier so I'll prob add an extra jalape√±o if I make it again.  This is just the type of dish that would be great to take to a pot luck or a cook out.

Big hit at the Memorial Day BBQ.  Used only a half cup oil and added a little extra lime juice. I was hesitant about using the whole jalepeno, but it was just fine (omitted the seeds).  I've loved jicama for a long time, but never thought of shredding it for salad until I had it that way at a fancy restaurant last week.  Works great.

My husband and I thought this salad was awesome! I  love Jicama, of course, so I knew I'd like it, but I wasn't sure if he would.  He raved about it.  We both could have kept eating it to the point of making ourselves miserable--instead we saved the leftovers for lunch.  :-)     I didn't have any green onion so I substituted about 1/3 of a sweet onion, and I had to use cherry tomatoes sliced in half.  It was still great!

Great summer dish.  I couldn't find a ripe, non-rotten  jicama so at the last minute I through some quinoa in  and became a great cook-out side dish.  Definitely will make again!

I hate doing this,  especially since so many others enjoyed this recipe. I could not eat it and my family wouldn't even try it.  I only used 3/4 c. oil and it was just way too oily.  For some reason the flavors just did not mesh to me.  I like everything individually so I figured I'd love this.  It just was not even a little bit good to me. SORRY!!

This was a fabulous, fresh tasting salad!  I did not add feta cheese since my husband is not fond of it, but, one could easily sprinkle it on.  I did add red and orange peppers because I had them on hand and figured "why not"?  Thank you for a great summer salad!

I loved this and followed it to a T until tasting the dressing.  It was so incredibly acidic and potent that I had to add about a tablespoon and a half of sugar.  Also found that the dressing sits at the bottom of the bowl (no matter how much stirring or shaking one did!), and there was quite a lot of it...so I'll make this again, but probably halve the dressing.  Stayed crunchy for days and was great on it's own or inside of a tortilla.  Thanks!

This was enjoyed by my guests. It is a nice combination of ingredients that mix well. I cut the dressing ingredients in half as I don't like my salads swimming in oil. It was perfect. I agree with others that the jicama is a nice touch. Something different which adds a nice crunch.

I tried this recipe but bought a Yucca not knowing the difference from a jicama but put it in mini food processor and minced it.  Was it good, the raves were amazing.  Some of my friends said they would use instead of salsa for a dip.  Others have issues with green  pepper so the next time I will use only red, yellow or orange and it should be just as good.  Thanks for the recipe, it is great.

I don't really care for beans or corn, but thought this looked interesting, so tried it. Someone said that they did not find it "amazing", but I totally did! It is truly great. I made my dressing as described, except only used 3/4 cup of oil. Next time I will make it 1/2 cup of oil, and half the lime as well as it is a tad overpowering and a bit oily tasting. Even with those flaws. It is still great. Other changes would be to add a bit more salt, as I think it needs it, and again 1/2 the required dressing.

This was fantastic!  I cut the oil by half and could still cut it down to 1/3 cp.  I also used reduced fat feta cheese to help cut calories.  I did leave out the jicama.

First time using jicama in a recipe. My husband and I both like this recipe. I halved the dressing and also added some cilantro I already had on hand.

Great blend of cool, flavorful, fresh, crispness.  I only used 4 oz of Feta and 1/2 C olive oil with good results.  Also added salt and pepper to taste.

I love this recipe and find it easy to adjust to people who like it more spicy, more tart, more...  and easy to change with what happens to be in your pantry on a given day.

This is a great recipe!  I used frozen corn and toasted it in the oven under the broiler.  That adds a nice toasty crunch.  Delicious!

This was really fantastic! I stayed true to the recipe except I used a can of whole kernel corn as I didn't have corn on the cob. Just the right amount of spiciness, plus I love the flavor from the feta cheese. Very, very good, and I will definitely make again and again. Thank you SO much for the great recipe!

I skipped the jicama and black beans (only because I didn't buy any), upped the corn & tomato amounts and it was awesome still. The dressing is superb. Love the hint of dijon, which I was skeptical about at first. I serve it both with and without the feta cheese too.

Lovely for a summer it's too hot meal!! I reduced oil to 1/4 c. and added fresh mint to dressing, oops I forgot the mustard. I will make this over & over, so many ways to change it up. I think it would be great with salmon! I will take this to our family reunion.

I made the salad part as written, pretty much the same with the dressing, but I added alittle more stuff to it. I added about a 1/4 of a cup of balsamic vinager, about a TBSP. of brown sugar, 1/4 tsp. of cumin. I'll make this again. I diffently think this is a great topping for tacos.

This is one awesome recipe. I like many others didn't know what a jicama was but luckily found a couple at the local grocery store next to the ginger root. Flavor wise I don't know how much it really adds to this dish, but it is essentially a bland apple with water chestnut crunch.  Texture wise, it is terrific with all the other ingredients.

I was at a small barbecue with about 6 of us and everyone was wanting to know what it was, I of course said "I'm not real sure, but the recipe sounded pretty interesting" Needless to say, I was hoping for leftovers and the only way I'm getting those is to make myself another batch!!  Not a bad problem to have.

This was good and easy.  I love things I can make a day or several days ahead.  Book club ladies liked it. Like most I used half the oil and half the feta. Also added a large avocado that I sprinkled with lime juice. Next time I would add all of the feta, more garlic and another jalape√±o.

This is the best and one of my favorites to take to pot lucks or to friends. Everyone asks for the recipe! I have to omit the green pepper but substitute with red or yellow. Depending on the guests I may also omit the jalapeno but great either way!

We don't eat corn, so I subsituted an apple for the sweet flavor. I didn't have a green pepper, but didn't miss it. I cut the oil down to 1/2 cup, as recommended. My husband took one bite and said, "add this to your recipe box, it's a keeper". I'm sure I will make again.

This was fabulous!  I did add some radishes, celery and cucumber, but it would have been just as good without them.  I also added more mustard to the dressing - just a personal preference, and used 1/2 c olive oil, based on some other comments.  Later in the week I made fish tacos and put some of the salad in them.  Yummy!

Yummy! The only thing I changed was only using a half cup of olive oil instead of an entire cup. It was still a little soupy but the dressing is BOMB! Definitely making this again! + fresh avocado slices :P

This is absolutely amazing!  The little market close to my house didn't have jicama, but I did have some regular old radishes, so I used those.  Added a nice color, plus got 'em out of the fridge.  Next time I can hunt down jicama, however, totally going for that!  The only other change I made was using less oil and I used green and yellow bell peppers.  Took it to a BBQ and got "I think this was my favorite dish out of all!" from one guest.  Definitely looking forward to the leftovers all week.  Yum.  Just...yum.

I made exactly as directed, except I used frozen corn, cherry tomatoes, and I only used about 4 ounces of Feta cheese. It came out very good. It had a nice kick from the jalapeno pepper. I had never used jicama before, and I really liked the taste and texture.

I really liked this and got a lot of compliments when I made it.  But the first time I made it it was inedible, 1 cup of oil is way, way too much- I left out the jicama and maybe that was why?  The next time I cut it back to 1/4 cup of oil and used 1/2 a red onion and shredded havarti instead of feta- everyone liked it that time.  Oh, and I used 1 cup of frozen corn.  But overall I really do like this recipe and like I said, lots of compliments at office and church potlucks.

Oh my goodness!  SO GOOD!!  I didn't have all the ingredients so I just used the beans, tomatoes, canned sweet corn.  I added cilantro.  In the sauce I found that 1/4 cup of oil was PLENTY!  YUMMY!

YUM!  I did cut WAY back on the oil...probably to 1/4 cup or so.  Added a little honey to sweeten up the dressing a bit.  I used fat free feta.  I left the jalapeno to be added on the side for individual tastes, and added cilantro as an option (that MADE the salad, as far as I'm concerned!)  Definitely a keeper!

I diced all the ingredients small, and we used it as a dip for tortilla chips. Great flavor, complimented well by the refreshing crunchiness of the jicama. Next time I will mince the jalapeno in my small food processor to avoid the stinging eyes and fingers!

I've made this twice in a week because everyone loves it. I did use a little less dressing the second time I made it and liked it a little better that way. I took a double batch on a four-day trip and it never got soggy. Excellent summer recipe!

Delicious mix of textures and flavors.  I think the ratio of ingredients in the dressing are just fine. I tried it with less oil and the lime was too bitter.  Make the dressing as is and just dress it slowly and instead of "less oil" you might just need less dressing.  I used about half the dressing amount and served the remainder on the side.

Very refreshing, lots of flavor and none of the ingredients are too overpowering. The dressing goes surprisingly well with the salad (although I'd like to try adding some vinegar next time to see how it turns out).  I used a 15oz can of black beans and 3 small-medium ears of corn. Also I couldn't find a jicama. It turned out great anyway so I can't complain. I'd definitely recommend this recipe!

I liked it, but I did get a lot of "I don't like jicama" comments - so be warned that this is a controversial ingredient! I used 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of a full cup and I also used monterey jack cheese instead of feta. I also sped things up a bit by getting canned corn and canned diced tomatos. It was a nice crunchy and fresh salad. It would go great with fish tacos as others have said.

This is very tasty , like others I used 1/2 the oil, it would be drowning in oil if you use the whole amount. I didn‚Äôt have any jicama but it was still tasty.

Followed the recipe loosly ( didn't measure  ). I used about half the oil as others suggested and had goat cheese instead of feta.  I had green tomatoes instead of red ( they just weren't ripe from the garden yet  were perfect in this recipe) and an orange bell pepper. It looked so fresh and pleasing.  Other than having to add salt due to the cheese swap out  it was delicious.

I took some liberties with the recipe because I didn't want to go to the grocery store. This salad was delicious! I used an orange pepper instead of a green pepper; yellow onion instead of scallions; fresh basil instead of cilantro; a lemon instead of a lime. Additionally, I added crumbled blue cheese. I would make it again this way. I also added some Tajin. Suggest using less oil than the recipe calls for.  A great summer recipe!

I halved this recipe to serve 4, added a bit more Dijon & lime to the vinaigrette to boost flavor along with grilling the corn and jalapeno. Never tried jicama until now and man, have I been missing out!! lol definitely will make again.

Very good!  I only used 1/2 cup of oil & added 1 Tablespoon of sugar, based on what other reviewers had posted. I used the larger size can of black beans and 1/2 cup of oil was perfect. Will certainly be making this again!

My husband and 2 year old really loved this. We never had jicama before but glad we found it and used it. I would make it again, but it definitely takes a lot of time with all the chopping.

I made this for the first, but not the last, time today. I didn't have any jicama so just left out that ingredient but, otherwise, made it exactly as the recipe stated. I can't see how the jicama would make this salad any tastier so I won't even be looking for it in future. This will definitely be a regular salad around our barbecues from now on and I can bet it's going to be a huge winner at our upcoming reunions too!

Excellent summer salad. I omitted jicama since I didn't have any on hand, but plan to use it next time. I also left out the mustard to make a more limey tasting dressing. Everyone in our family loved the combination of flavors!

I would rename this to Jicama Salad ~much easier to remember!  The salad itself was terrific!  Loved all the ingredients.  I probably will put fewer beans in it next time and have chopped avocado on the side to mix in. It does last well in the refrigerator. We used it in fish tacos the first day and then snacked on it with tortilla chips the next day. Enjoy ??

More flavor than your mouth can handle but YOU MUST LET IT CURE IN THE FRIDGE FOR AT LEAST 12 HOURS OR THE TASTES WILL NOT BLEND.

This recipe is awesome and healthy.  I was a little hesitant to try the jicama, but so glad that I did. I found it next to the fresh ginger in the produce department.  It really adds a unique texture and light flavor to this recipe.  I only used a quarter cup of olive oil (same amount as lime juice) and this was a perfect balance.  Other than that I followed the recipe just as written. This could easily be used as a vegetarian main dish or as a side salad.  One last note, be sure to let it marinate overnight in the fridge, as it brings out the flavors.

I liked this recipe a lot although I agree with those who remarked that 1 cup oil would be too much.  I made it as written with the exception that I reduced the oil to between 1/2 and 3/4 cup.   I like the kick that the jalapeno adds so much that I might do as another mentioned next time and make it two jalapenos. My hint would be to be sure and remove the pepper seeds and dice the peppers pretty finely.  That way you get the good Tex/Mex kick but not an overly hot raw jalapeno bite. I also agree that it is a perfect fix early and refrigerate for later recipe.  Thank you.

I've made this salad several times now and I think it's great! Not everyone in my family agrees, though. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The next time I was out of fresh corn so used home frozen. Out of fresh garlic so used garlic powder. First time I mixed the dressing in the food processor and it worked great, but the next time I hand whisked it and the oil never got completely incorporated. Second time was still good but not as good. This time after reading many reviews, I only added 3/4 cup oil, and since it was still great, next time I will try 1/2 cup. I didn't have jicama any of the times I've made it (store never seems to have it) but will try harder to find some since so many of you thought it added so much.

I made this for a BBQ we are hosting tomorrow night.  I am loving it!  The jicama adds a wonderful crunch.  I omitted the jalapeno only because we have small children coming.  I can only imagine that the flavors will develop as it chills overnight.  Thank you!

Absolutely delicious. The jicama makes it. I doubled the recipe it for a BBQ and people loved it. I reduced the amount of olive oil in the recipe and added some fresh coriander but other than that, left the recipe as is. Just a great (and healthy recipe!). Two thumbs up.

This was really awesome!  Next time I will not add so much oil...it was really unnecessary.

Easy to make, and a surprising great flavor.  It has a great freshness and makes a pretty side.  Next time I will add more jalepenos--it needed a little more kick.

This is so good! I substituted chopped zucchini for the jicama and added chopped olives as well. Also cut the olive oil way down, prob about 1/8 c. It still tastes amazing!

This is a great recipe! I served it with tortilla chips that had a hint of lime, and guacamole chips which was fabulous!  Can't go wrong on a hot day! Goes great with white wine and beer also! I bet it would be fantastic with grilled cedar plank salmon!

I loved it except I would next time not put as much feta it was a little to much. Plus a little to much olive oil. I loved it other than that.  I think a little cilantro might be good too.

This was delicious along side Jay's Jerk Chicken.  I could not find jicama in my market so subsituted 1 japanese cucumber diced.  Instead of using fresh corn, sweet frozen corn was much less work.  Like others, I reduced the oil in the dressing to about 1/4  cup and added a few splashes of blood orange balsamic vinegar.  It tasted great right away, but even better marinated overnight as instructed.  This is a great side to any grilled meat dish!

I left out the jalapenos & put in orange bell peppers instead of green bell peppers. This is a delicious salad. Great on a hot summer evening

This is a good combination of flavors with a nice, zippy dressing. I used half the lime juice and oil, and subbed roasted Hatch green chiles for the jalapeno. The feta is a great touch, and I like that the beans aren't the main feature.
