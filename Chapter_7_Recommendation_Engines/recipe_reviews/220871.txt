Oh WOW. WOW. This was amazing. The sweet/spicy combo was perfect. I made this exactly as written, except in the slow cooker. (Haven't used my pressure cooker yet!) Everything turned out wonderful. This is a keeper for sure. "Best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had." I'll be using the left overs to put on a pizza crust later! YUM YUM YUM!

Really good!  I made the pork and used it for Pork tacos and then next night pulled pork sandwiches.  Perfect blend of sweet and spicy!  Thanks!

This is an excellent bbq! I had only a slight adjustment when I believed the sauce to be too acidic. I added three tbs of commercial bbq sauce and all was well! I have no problem recommending this recipe to any bbq aficionado. Thank you, Valerio!

Just looking at the ingredients in this one made my mouth water in anticipation. We aren't real spice lovers in this house but I do love flavor so I cut the black pepper, red pepper flakes and salt in 1/2 and there was plenty of spice for us. Even though it was 3 T shy of rub there was still plenty for my 3-1/2 # roast. I didn't have any hot sauce but I did have a jar of Herdez Traditonal Chipotle Mexican Cooking Sauce in the house that I used in it's place. I also didn't have beef broth and had chicken broth to use up. My maple syrup was bad so I skipped that step knowing with the honey and molasses there would be plenty sweetness. There was plenty (maybe too much) liquid for the amount of meat and I really think you could getaway with 1/2-3/4 the amount of liquid (at least for the electric pressure cooker). For the coleslaw mix I cut up my own cabbage and carrots. I used an electric pressure cooker that had presets that only allowed pressure cooking up to 40 minutes and I have no idea if that was a low pressure or not. I ran my cycle twice for a total of 80 minutes under pressure. It could have used about 20 - 30 more minutes but it was tender and shreddable as is. I think there was a good balance of sweet and spicy. This is the first time we've ever had coleslaw on pulled pork sandwich and I really enjoyed. Even though I made a few alterations to the recipe we enjoyed it. Thank you for the keeper Valerio!

This is the first meal I prepared in my pressure cooker and it was a huge hit!  The sauce is well balanced and the slaw adds just the right amount of crunch to the hearty pork. YUM!

We really like this recipe.  I find that 1 Tbsp. of each of the dry rub ingredients is plenty.  Also, I only pressure cook the meat for about 1 hour.  We usually don't make the bbq sauce because we have some excellent sauce on hand, but we make the cole slaw  using 1/2 the mayo and dressing ingredients, and also bake home-made kaiser rolls.  I do have a question, however.  I was wondering if I am correct in assuming that the pork does NOT get returned to the cooking liquid?  I noticed that some recipes have the shredded pork stay warm in the liquid.

This is a fantastic recipe.  The one change I made was only use a few drops of hot sauce a 1/2 cup of my hot sauce would have been over whelming.

Doing this for the second time in just a few weeks!  This will be a family favorite!  I use a slow cooker, just combine all ing. turn on and enjoy later!  I have used both commercial BBQ sauces as well as this (I did add liquid smoke).  This is most definately worth trying!

The different elements of this recipe are amazing!  The rub and the cooking liquid for the pork is fantastic and the BBQ sauce was incredible.  Lots of flavour!  One thing I will do next time is combine the pork and BBQ sauce and let it sit in the pot for a few minutes before serving it.  We tried it separately but our personal preference would be to mix them together.
I will definitely be making this again!!!

Heaven, absolute heaven!   The pork and BBQ sauce were phenomenal.  I substituted the KFC clone recipe for the cole slaw.  THANK YOU, VALERIO!

Amazing!!!  Made it, shared it with a friend.  Friend loved it so much that she told my co-workers.  Co-workers talked me into making some and bringing it to work.  Everyone loved it and I've made it for them several times.  Tomorrow I'm trying it out on my parents.  it's been a huge hit every time I make it.

Amazing! Used a slow cooker—8-10 hours on low. I made cornbread as one of the sides (see recipe below), and this is also really good if you skip the roll and pile everything on top of cornbread! Cornbread: 2 boxes Jiffy corn muffin mix; 1 cup sour cream; 3 eggs, beaten; 1/2 cup melted butter or margarine; 1 tsp. salt; 16oz. can creamed corn. Mix all ingredients together and pour into greased 9x13 baking dish.Bake at 375 degrees for 35 minutes or until lightly brown.)

Made this as a last minute meal so I didn't have adequate time for the dry rub to sit. Didn't make a difference. I just rubbed it in the dry rub and threw it in the pressure cooker. An hour later I poked it with a fork and it fell apart. It is by far the best pulled pork I've ever made (and I've tried a lot of recipes) and even though I have been eating it's left overs for 2 days now I still look forward to the next time I get to make it. Absolutely incredible flavor. 
Of note: I didn't make the Slaw or the BBQ sauce, I am not a Slaw kind of guy and I found it didn't need the BBQ sauce masking the mind blowing flavor it already had.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated & must say that the pork was cooked well at about 2 1/2 hours and the BBQ sauce was a bit acidic. Next time if I make this I will less cider vinegar.

Great flavours- but a bit spicy for kids. Definitely not a sweet sauce. Everyone liked it except for next time I would use less hot sauce!

The rub = 5, the cooking liquid = 5 (could use a little more sweetness), and bbq = 5 (it's great on the pork..but not so good alone).  It's the cole slaw dressing that I really didn't like.  Everything else was excellent!  Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic!  I started making and then realized that the recipe calls for a pressure cooker, which I don't own.  So... I put it in a slow cooker for 5 hours and it was perfect!  Recipe wise, I didn't change anything and chose not to add salt or pepper to the BBQ sauce.  The sauce is sweet and spicy deliciousness.  I'm going to make a lot of this for an upcoming tailgate.  I'll be able to make a couple of days ahead and reheat on site.  Perfect.

Wow!!!! I made this and another pulled pork recipe for a large family gathering.  This tastes FANTASTIC without BBQ sauce added.  In fact, when I make it the next time it will be for tacos.  Great flavor between the sweet and hot.  Everyone said that this was clearly the winner between the 2 recipes I tried.

Would cut down on hot sauce.  Very spicy and I love hot.  Other than that it was great.

I used 2 lbs of leftover pork butt that I put into the crockpot with salt, pepper and garlic. Cut the wet ingredients in half and I had no molasses. But the coleslaw really makes this pulled pork sandwich sing! (Used a regular hamburg bun too)

The rub and cooking liquid was great. The cole slaw and BBQ sauce had way too much salt and vinegar. I followed the recipes exactly! I will make the meat again but I will find a cole slaw and bbq sauce that I like better!
