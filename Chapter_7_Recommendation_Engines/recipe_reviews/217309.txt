This was wonderful!  I used collards instead of the Seven Lettuces, and added a Bay leaf, but otherwise kept it the same.  We served it over brown and wild rice in a bowl.  Except for my daughter who doesn't like spicy things, this was a family hit.  Will definately make again soon.

I added scallops and rice to this recipe, but left the seasoning the same. It was delicious and very easy to make!

This was tasty and quick! A couple things I did: I could not find the salad mix in the recipe, so I used baby kale-baby spinach mix. (I felt that would also hold up better to being reheated the next day.) I reduced the clam juice to 1 cup, and made up the difference in the liquid with water and Herb-Ox no sodium chicken boullion. Since my shrimp was raw, I added it to the pot earlier so it would get cooked. All in all, a nice easy dinner for a chilly work night. I served it with a crusty loaf of bread.
