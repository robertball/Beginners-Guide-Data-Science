This had a great starting point, but in reading the recipe I thought it needed a little tinkering. First, the recipe calls for way too much Worcestershire in my view, so I reduced it to 1 T. I substituted fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder, and for a boost of flavor used a full envelope of packaged, dry Italian salad dressing mix rather than the bottled, adding some olive oil to compensate. I didn't bother with the honey marinade as it wasn't necessary, and just brushed some melted butter on the shrimp before serving. This had a mellow but perfectly adequate flavor, that did not overpower the shrimp.  I served this on a bed of Rice with Summmer Squash, also from this site.

Very good recipe. The worcestshire seemed like a little too much for our liking so we used 1/2 cup worcestshire and 1/2 cup Pineapple Juice to give it a tropical flare. Served with terikayi chicken, grilled pineapple slices and jasmine rice, it was excellent!!!

This was very good.  We don't have a grill so I sauteed the shrimp in the honey-butter sauce.  Will definitely make again!

Delicious and easy.  We found it works better if you put the vegetables and shrimp on separate skewers... the shrimp cooks very quickly.

this was the best.  Didn't make any changes, except to triple the recipe!!  (Glad I did!)  I did take a previous reviewer's advice to put the veggies on seperate skewers as they took longer than the shrimp to cook.  Absolutely awesome.

Wonderful!  I used fresh mushrooms, and green and red peppers with the shrimp. If you par-boil the peppers for 3 minutes before cutting in chunks, you can thread the shrimp and vegetables together at grilling time-makes a very presentable and delicious meal- serve with yellow rice-YUM!

Great recipe.  I used them as an appetizer with steaks on the grill.  To make it even faster and easier, I used frozen precooked shrimp.  Just thawed them in cold water, then put them in the marinade.  Also, I only used 1/2 c. of worcestershire in the marinade as I didn't have enough.  It was still really good.

What wonderful way to grill shrimp!  I am used to sauteeing(sp?) shrimp in butter, so I have never tried marinating them grilling.  We had guests over for Memorial Day and they absolutely went crazy over these.  Will definitely use again!! Thank you!!  and Happy 4th to you!!

Made this for my 6 year old daughter and my husband.  My 6 year old is a shrimp lover.  She ate it up and started eyeing her father's plate!  My hubby did state that it had a strong Worchestire taste so I think I will do as mentioned and reduce the W sauce a bit to make it a little less over powering.  Will make again though.

This is an incredibly delicious recipe! I don't think I've ever enjoyed shrimp as much as I did prepared this way...everything about it was perfect. The only change I made to the recipe was to reduce the amount of worcestershire sauce in the marinade. I also cut the amount of basting sauce in half (using 2 tbs of butter, 2 tbs of honey, and 1 tbs of worcestershire sauce) and it was plenty. This came out so beautifully...the presentation was lovely, and the taste was out of this world! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...I'll definitely be making this again!!!!

I made this recipe as an appetizer for my husband and myself.  I only used 1/2 of the 1/3 cup of w. sauce then added water to make 1/3 cup (to cut down on the sodium).  Followed everything else to a T.  My husband thought these were restaraunt quality without the price! :)  Would have submitted a photo but all that was left were the tails.

I was looking for something different to do w/shrimp (other than garlic butter/scampi style) and stumbled upon this.  It looked interesting so i decided to give it a whirl.  I followed the recipe (minus black pepper) & I subbed lemon juice for the wine.  I only used a couple tblsp of butter for the basting sauce.  These were a nice change of pace & I will make them again.

This was a WONDERFUL dish! The whole family loved it I hope to make it again soon. Great recipe, but if you're not into a super-zesty flavor you might want to leave out Worcestershire in the butter-honey basting sauce. I did and couldn't have been more thrilled with the final product! Thanks for sharing such a delicious recipe!

Very good and quick and easy to do.  I used  a defrosted bag of frozen ready to eat shrimp (what I had on hand) and grilled it just long enough to heat them up and blacken a bit.  Yummy!

This was delicious.  Made it as stated except took one reviewers advice and only made a half recipe of the sauce used to baste the shrimp.  We enjoyed this very much and will definitely make again!!  Thanks for sharing!

wasnt blown away by this recipe by any means, but i would make it again.  mostly had a worchestire flavor - didnt tast much of the honey flavor that was in the basting sauce.  i did decrease the worchestire marinade to 1/4 cup and only added 1 tbsp. to the basting sauce.  next time i think i'll just skip the worchestire in the basting sauce completely.  also, it was pretty greasy probably due to the butter in the basting sauce.  so next time i may just try half the butter with more honey.  marinaded the shrimp for approx. 7 hrs.  served with brown rice and grilled vegetables.  also, i used pre-cooked shrimp, which i wont do again - was only on the grilled a short short time, but still was rubbery and chewey.  stick with the uncooked shrimp!

Very good.  I'll make this again and again.  I didn't need nearly all of the basting sauce. The basting sauce tastes good on steelhead also.

This was awesome I loved the sweetness of this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to sub red wine vinegar for the dry white wine. Still worked out very well.

The worcestershire sauce is overpowering. Reduce and make sure not to over cook on the grill. Do not use the honey/butter glaze as a marinade, but rather a mop. Pretty decent though.

I, too, did not have a grill. I sauteed the shrimp in the skillet. We chose to eat it on top of a salad. Fantastic! Definately, a keeper, we will totally make this again.

I've made this recipe on several occasions and this needs no tinkering.  When looking at the recipe, it does seem like a lot of Worcestershire sauce, but, this is just for the marinade which the shrimp will only sit in for one hour.  This is just enough time to get the appropriate flavor this recipe is going for and then, the marinade is discarded.  The lovely basting sauce applied during grilling is also a must!  Try following this recipe "as is" before deviating from it.  It is a wonderful recipe the way it is! :)

Very good. I made half the recipe and had it marinating most of the day. I also marinated pieces of green pepper, onion, grape tomatoes and whole mushrooms. When it came time for dinner, the vegetables were skewered separately from the shrimp. I put these in the oven first while I put the shrimp on their own skewers. (This gave the veggies about 15 minutes more time to cook). Then I basted the shrimp and put them in the oven at 350 for 3 minutes, turned them over and basted them on the other side. I did soak my wooden skewers so they wouldn't burn but I forget to spray them with Pam so the food would slide off easier. Also next time I would remove the shrimp tails and also serve with rice.

Not quite as good as I expected it to be, but I will make it again. Seemed to have less flavor than I expected. My husband and I enjoyed it though.

This is a great recipe for shrimp. I use the wood skewers and marinate it a little longer, and they come out good. I don't like real fishy things and this masks the scent and flavor very well.

I had no Worcester sauce, but they turned out great without it. I will eventually try it as written, but if your halfway through dinner and don't want to stop, make it without it.. still wonderful.

These are fantasitc.  I was able to buy shrimp already on skewers, so the amount of work was cut in half.  These are sweet and tangy all in one, so they are very satisfying.  I will definately make these again.

I made this recipe with only minor changes:  I used fresh garlic, and I used dry sherry since I had no white wine. I also marinated them about 4 hours. I liked the shrimp, but I found the  flavor of the worchestershire sauce overpowered all the other flavors.  My husband did not care for it at all.  I would have preferred less worchesterchire and a greater variety of ingredients for a more complex flavor.  Perhaps I marinated them too long, and that was the problem.

It was a smash hit at my BBQ.  All but one who is allergic to sea food.  I used freshly grated garlic instead of powder and it was delish.  I've never had so many compliments.  I will use again.

Upon first bite, the Worcestershire sauce completely overpowered the other flavors in this marinade.  My advice would be to use 1/2 of which the recipe called for a more subtle taste.  Threading the veggies separate from the shrimp also helped the cooking times of each skewer.  Will try, try again.  Thank you Kendra.

Good stuff. The marinade is kinda sour and then the glaze is obviously sweet. I increased recipe from standar amount to 20  and the proportions got all jacked up. I had to wing it. Ended up a-okay and got lots of kudos.

If I could I would give more than 5 stars on this dish. It was fantastic! I was concerned with all the amount of worcestershire sauce, but it turned out really good. The only thing I changed was to add half of the amount of butter in order to cut on fat.

I was looking through my recipe box for a good grilled shrimp recipe for guests this weekend and was delighted to stumble upon this one.  I made this last summer for a group and everyone raved.  I foolishly had forgotten about it until today...what a mistake!  I plan on using our local lowcountry shrimp and serving this all summer long!

My family enjoyed this dish very much. I had already cooked the shrimp before I went looking for a recipe so I marinated the shrimp cooked, not as much flavor. Next time I will marinate first, the honey butter sauce was yummy too. Thanks for the great post!

Thought this was very good. I doubled the marinade ingrediants but left the worcestershire sauce the same. Also substitued sherry for white wine. Added a dash of pepper to the honey/butter combination but otherwise followed recipe. Shrimp were very flavorful. I cut up fresh pineapple and put chunks on a separate skewer. Grilled a little longer than the shrimp and basted with the honey/butter basting sauce. Was fabulous. Served with steak and grilled veggies. Thanks for the recipe.

What a wonderful grilled shrimp recipe!  So full of flavor.  I loved the basting sauce, honey and shrimp are a perfect combo.  I made the marinade and basting sauce exactly as written with a small exception, just added a drizzle of sesame oil to the marinade.  Hubs grilled these to perfection.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it's a for sure do-over!

Nicely different from the usual grilleed shrimp.  Use half the basting sauce for dipping when shrimp are done.

This recipe was wonderful!  It was easy and quick to make.  I marinated the shrimp while I prepared veggies and potatoes to also go on the grill.  I used chicken Worcestershire sauce which worked really well.  Try it, you'll like it!

Oh my gosh! This was absolutely the BEST shrimp I've EVER had and I didn't change a thing from the original recipe. I didn't actually get to marinate the shrimp for the full hour, because I was running late for work, but it was fantastic anyway! I added veggies (peppers, mushrooms and onions to my skewers) and basted them with the honey glaze while they were grilling and even they tasted fantastic, too! I called my parents after we finished eating and told them we would be making this recipe again this week and they would be invited over!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!

This was just ok.  The flavor wasn't as strong as I had hoped.  Maybe because I used precooked shrimp?

I tried this recipe last year while trying to impress my family with my cooking skills and everyone loved it. I have made it several times and I have not changed anything about it. Now that spring is back this will be on our cooking list every week. It is fun and easy to do! I would recommend it to anyone.

Truly incredible! My friends couldn't stop talking about the shrimp even the next day! I didn't change a thing. Good with baked potato or rice. I also honey glazed the veggies along with shrimp as they cooked.

A nice alternative with grilling shrimp.  I wanted more of a kick so next time, I may add red pepper flakes to the marinade. Although I  marinaded for the full hour, I would increase that next time and hope for more bang.  It is not, by any means, awful as is... just depends on personal preference.  The shrimp were extra tasty once the basting sauce became caramelized - mmm.... I served mine over basmati rice since I had just made some earlier today.  Will make again.  Thank you!

Didn't like this as much as I would have liked to.  Like another reader said, it had a little unexpected kick and I only used half the pepper the recipe called for.  My husband enjoyed them more than me though so I didn't feel like it was a total waste since I didn't care for them.

I marinated 1lb of pre-cooked shrimp then grilled, basting with the honey sauce.  Better than average but we prefer other grilled shrimp recipes.

Big hit with the husband.  I don't like seafood so this review is from him.  Great flavor and he liked that I made some more of the honey/worchestershire sauce for him to dip the shrimp onto.  I made this for him as his main dish, but he commented that he would rather have had these as a side - perhaps with steak.  We try not to repeat meals alot, but he can't wait for me to make this for him again!

So simple and very delicious. The shrimp have a nice sweet barbecue flavor with just a tiny bite to them. I will definitely make these again. I served them with rice pilaf and sugar snap peas.

Like another reviewer, I was in a hurry and didn't have time to use the marinade, so I just combined the 3 sauce ingredients, pan saute'd the shrimp and basted once on each side with the sauce.  Super!  Took no time and was really tasty.

didnt really feel like firing up the grill so i put the shrimp in the skillet and then poured in the honey mixture when the shrimp was cooked all the way through, cooked on high until the honey had almost completely boiled off. it was very sweet and very good. maybe next time add dried coconut?

This was AWESOME.  The only change I made was omitting Worcestershire sauce completely.  We don't care for it, and this recipe called for a TON of it.  Other than that, it was fab and it accompanied veggie skewers and other BBQ fare perfectly!

My family loved it! I doubled the recipe and tweeked it a bit for personal taste. Instead of black pepper, 1/4 tsp. of cayanne pepper, halved the worchestershire sauce and added pineapple juice to balance the liquids, instead of Italian dressing- Ken's Lite Asian Sesame with Ginger & Soy, mushrooms on skewered by themselves- but marinade together and marinaded for a few hours. I also used deveined unpeeled shrimp to keep the moisture in on the grill. Served with almond rice pilaf, simply the best.

This was great, my only change was less Worchestershire sauce.  This is a keeper.  We'd give it 5 stars with about 1/2 of the Worchestershire sauce.

Very tasty.  We really enjoyed this dish. I put orange bell peppers, red onions, mushrooms, and green onions on separate skewers and brushed them with italian dressing rather than use the same marinade as the shrimp.  Since the worcestershire sauce plays a dominant role in the recipe, I recommend using a good brand like Lea & Perrins.  I served the kabobs with steamed rice.

I love this recipe! I changed a little bit of stuff for instance I used a little less worchestishire sause and added about 3 Tbl. of orange juice just to give a nice citrus flavor. Everyone loved this recipe and I'll definately use this again.

I made this for all the Dad's on Fathers Day and it was a big hit!!Fresh jumbo shrimp worked very well. left out wine/honey and butter at the end, just personal preference. We may make this a new Fathers Day tradition!

This was great!  It was fast, easy and yummy.  I was able to make it even easier by cooking it in our grilling basket instead of skewers.  I cut up onion and red pepper and cooked it an little before I added the shrimp.  It was awesome!!

Just tried this great recipe!! Don't have a grill and used pre-cooked shrimp, but they turned out great!!! I did add Old Bay and used packaged Italian dressing and some olive oil (as recommended by other reviews). This is a keeper...will use raw shrimp and a grill next time for the full effect!!!

I made this recipe and it turned out to be really really good. The only changes I made was that I didn't add the Italian dressing and I made it in my inside grill and I didn't put them on a swker. It came out really really good. If you like salty and sweet taste this is the recipe for you.

Delicious!  It was too cold to grill outside, so I put these under the broiler for about 3 minutes per side while basting with the honey butter and they were awesome!

This was absolutely delicious.  I didn't feel like lighting the grill, so I used the honey mixture in a saute pan and added the shrimp.  This was served over brown rice, with sauce poured over rice, Mmmm so delicious. Highly recommended

I made this for father's day to go with steaks, and it was superb. I followed the recipe to a tee, and the flavors were great. It wasn't too overpowering -- maybe next time I would use fresh garlic instead of the powder, but I think this recipe is great as is and will definitely be making this again this summer!

This is an awesome recipe.  I have never grilled shrimp before.  But, we bought a new Weber Q grill and I wanted to try it out before going camping.  
I followed the recipe exactly but didn't use the wine.  I marinated the shrimp most of the day.  Put them on skewers, brushed them with honey mix for 2 1/2 minutes.  Flipped them and brushed with honey mixture for 2 1/2 more minutes.  They were perfect. 
I also marinated/skewered mushrooms, onions, peppers.  They were a little hard, but still great.  Needed more time on the grill, I guess. 
Served red beans and rice as another side. 
My family loved it.  This is a keeper!
Thanks.

Excellent!  This was my first time grilling shrimp, and I am so glad I used this recipe.  The honey butter sauce is the best part, so definitely don't skip that.  I tried grilling the shrimp with some veggies on the same skewer, but the shrimp got done faster, so I would recommend putting the veggies on a separate skewer.  I followed the recipe as written, and the shrimp came out perfect- very tasty!  I highly recommend.

Hubby greatly overcooked these, getting acquainted w/ his new gas grill, but the sauce was so good that they were still mighty tasty. I only had a couple of tbp of worcestershire & I wanted to use it in the sauce so I watered down A1 steak sauce until it looked right. Even though we  cooked them on a cooking sheet over the grill grate (just like the one in Cindy Lu Who's pic) there were still so many flame-ups from the sauce that we used it as a dip instead of as a baste. We both loved thse & will have them over & over again...thansk for a wonderful recipe Kendra!

Yummy!  This was really delicious.  As I was making the recipe, I found that I was running out of Worcestershire sauce, so I was unable to add that to the honey butter sauce.  I still basted the shrimp with the honey butter, though.  I also reserved a little bit to dip into indulgently during dinner.  Very easy and really tasty results!

Good flavor.  The shrimp I used were too small, so I wound up over-cooking them.  Will make this again with larger shrimp.

I don't eat shrimp, but I wanted to treat my husband and his friends.  I tried this recepie and they just loved it.  I've never seen three men gobble up a pound of shrimp so fast.  I put the marinade (I had all the ingredients already in my house--very convenient) and shrimp into a ziplock bag in the morning, then grilled them at about 8pm.  It was pretty easy.

This was a little more involved than most shrimp recipies I use (I like them quick and easy), but it was definately worth it; the honey was great!  I almost always tweek a recipie to make it to my liking, but I don't think I'll do anything to this one.

This recipe was awesome.  The basting sauce was incredible.  NOTE: Make sure you have your grill really hot-- the shrimp need to cook FAST-- because otherwise they dry out and can over cook.  A fabulous one to try with your friends.

Fantastic Flavor. I used pre-cooked shrimp (mistake) so it turned out a little rubbery. I also pan fried because I did not have skewers. It would have been perfect if I had used raw shrimp. The kids loved the extra sweet "drippings" on their mashed potatoes.

Outstanding!  I am a big shrimp lover, and this recipe is right up there with the best.  I used less worcestershire sauce and used real garlic.  I also doubled the honey glaze sauce so I could baste not only the shrimp, but the veggies, too.  I would will make this again!

This had a very good flavor.  I didn't have the issue that some other reviewers had of the worcestershire sauce being too overpowering.  I did have t make a slight change suggested by another reviewer, though, as we were rained out of our cookout.  I tried to saute the shrimp in the honey butter sauce, and while it was very flavorfull, and a touch to sweet for my taste, I'm sure it will stick a little better and have a better flavor when used as a glaze on the grill.  Definitely going to give it another shot.

I was looking for some sort of glaze with ingredients I had on hand and this fit the bill.  I didn't have many of the ingredients for the marinade so I didn't do it and just mixed up the glaze to brush on the shrimp and veggies while they cooked.  I used an indoor electric grill and this came out great.  It didn't cover up or overpower the shrimp flavor and was just the right amount of sweet and tang.  Served on a bed of steamed jasmine rice and a small garden salad.  Absolutely great!

I was very surprised at how great these turned out. I used about 1/4 c of Worcestershire sauce and mistakenly put the honey in with the marinade. I think it added depth to the flavor that was fantastic. Because of my honey mistake, I basted the shrimp with a little garlic butter and grilled with veggie skewers and served over rice. Wonderful meal that everyone enjoyed and I will definitely be making this again (probably with the honey in the marinade).

We enjoyed this marinade because it enhances the flavor of the shrimp by added great flavor without overpowering it.  I wouldn’t change a thing.

Excellent grilling main course dish -- quick and easy to prepare in your marinator. My large shrimp still had the shells on them, but I thawed them out before marinating and the shells peeled off amazingly easy. Five large shrimp on a skewer, served two skewers per person. With one pound large shrimp and a side of Zataran's Carribean rice, I was able to serve four adults an excellent, filling meal. I also marinated a steak in a bit of the marinade (on its own) and it held excellent flavor blending well into the meal.

Followed recipe as is with the exception of the honey basting sauce.  I only used 1 T. of Worcestershire instead of 2 T.  I used red and green pepper and large pieces of onion on the skewers. Will definately make again.

very good and definitely a sweeter taste, but not too sweet.  at first when i made the marinade i thought it would be too much wors. sauce, but once it hit the grill the flavors all combined and were a great meal.  served with roasted asparagus and whole grain rice.  will make again.

My husband and I loved this recipe! He is very hard to please, so I was happy to find something that he liked. I did not have any white wine, so I used a touch a lemon juice instead. Turned out great! I definitely recommend this recipe!

Tried the first time and we all loved it. We forgot to soak the skewers but it still worked out. Did it just like they said.  We marinated the mushrooms and some onion and put those on the skewers too.  We used vermouth for the whit wine which always works out fine and is always on hand.

So easy to make and came out fantastic. I only did the shrimp this time but can't wait to try putting veggies into the marinade as well. I think for the first time ever I finished my plate beforemy husband. We will definitely be making this again!!

This is a really tasty recipe.  I read the reviews and followed some of the suggestions and added a bit of my own flare.  Fresh garlic, less Worcestershire sauce, add pineapple juice, traded oil for italian dressing.    Grilled with pineapple, mushrooms, and peppers.  Now here is the best part.  Reduce the leftover marinade at a boil to make a killer sauce to drizzle over the shrimp and vegetables.  served over a bed of jasmine rice(as per recommended by an earlier review.

Easy to make and tasty too! The reason it only gets 4 stars is because the honey flavor is overwhelmed by the Worcestershire sauce.

This was fantastic! I loved the flavor and taste. I was just looking for a quick marinade to throw together while I finished up some yard work before making dinner, and this was perfect. I used "grill cuts" shrimp, so they were very jumbo, and butterflied, but still had the shells and tails on. They were frozen and raw, so I thawed them under water for a few minutes and threw them in the bag. They cooked for about 8 minutes total and were perfectly done. For the marinade: I didn't use white wine, so I compensated with a tad more oil and a little bit of water. The taste was great!

Delicious! Next time I would skip the additional "basting" sauce at the end, or at least scale it down a bit. I hardly used any since the shrimp cook so quickly, and it was a waste of almost a whole cube of butter and honey. Otherwise, excellent recipe!

I adored this recipe. So different from the regular shrimp taste. But the honey can be messy, so one has to be careful while broiling. The salad dressing made all the difference!

This recipe was very good. The taste was fantastic. I did think there was too much marinade. I will use less honey next time and watch the time on the BBQ. I couldn't tell if they were done so I over cooked them. :( They were still very good!

The shrimp had good flavor. It wasn't too sweet. Better than average recipe.

This was really good!  I did make a few modifications though.  For the marinade I used only 2 tbsp. of Worcestershire and I added a 1/4 tsp. of Old Bay.  I did let them marinate as the recipe says. I then sauteed the shrimp in honey butter (no worchestershire) instead of grilling and saved a little of the honey butter to drizzle over them and dip them in after cooking.  This worked out really well.  My bf usually doesn't like shrimp and he loved these.  Definitely a keeper! Btw, bacon-cheddar mashed potatoes make a great side with this!

Great shrimp recipe! Even my 2-year old ate it and he didn't like shrimp the last time we had it.

I have used this marinade on chicken as well when cooking for non-shrimp lovers, and it was delicious that way, too!

I marinated the shrimp for almost two hours, and it turned out just right. I didn't make the honey butter mixture at the end though. Very good...will use again

My husband and I both LOVED this!! It had wonderful flavor, I made sure to keep basting it on the grill, every 15 seconds or so. I also reserved a small cup of the basting sauce for dipping, it was fantastic!

Made this last night for supper.When I told my husband what we were having,he got worried b/c he doesn't like recipes that overwhelm the flavor of the shrimp. Well, he didn't even miss the cocktail sauce! This is nice and light, something different. Thanks Kendra

Our first recipe used from this site. A great choice! Made the shrimp without the vegetables, as shrimp was all we had. Tossed the grilled shrimp in rice, added some broccoli, and we had a tasty, easy meal. Thank you !

Loved this! The shrimp took mere minutes to cook on the grill! Caution: don't overcook! The marinade and sauce were GREAT and would probably be good on all sorts of things like pork, for example. I have to admit I absolutely hated peeling/deveining the shrimp and putting them onto the skewers. Speaking of skewers, I had both metal and wood ones (that I soaked), and the metal were much easier to use.

YUM!  I used tiger prawns -- maybe a little too big, since the marinade didn't quite penetrate (even after 3 1/2 hrs.!!), but it was delicious nonetheless.  Will marinate overnight next time.  Added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne (will add more next time) and 1 large minced clove of garlic to the marinade.  Didn't have white wine, so I used vermouth.  Served over plain rice.

I skipped the white wine because I didn't have any on hand, and just grilled the shrimp on skewers without any onions, peppers, etc. Outstanding!! My family loved it and my mom had to have a copy of the recipe.

I will make again for tacos!
Great just the way Kendra laid it out.

Loved it! Followed recipe ingredients as directed and came out delicious! Also added some peppers + onions (didn’t marinade) to a few skewers and pre-grilled them so they would cook evenly with the shrimp. Had plenty left-over honey butter glaze since I put it on “occasionally” as the recipe suggested. A few pieces of shrimp tasted like they needed the glaze (this is where I might agree with less Worcestershire - since the sugary honey totally cuts that strong tangy flavor) but all in all delicious!

I didn't use the grill I cooked it on the stove. I used the sauce made for basting to cook the shrimp in. in the sauce I added minced garlic and scallions. it was very delicious.

Made this for cookout at my son's new house with wife and in-laws.  Did take advice from previous posts and half the worcestershire and used jarred garlic smashed.  Used only 24-30/# shrimps just to get flavor.  Doubled recipe and got 20 skewers with 10 shrimps each.  Delish!  Will definitely  use larger shrimps next time, think about main dish with veggies!

Made this twice.  Took the advise of several of the reviewers and reduced the amount of Worcestershire , mainly because my wife is salt-sensitive.  Came out beautifully both times.  Served with marinated and grilled vegetables the second time, and that worked great as well.  Will definitely be adding this to the favorites list.

If you don't have a grill, you can broil them in the oven and they're just as good

I’m always looking for new grilled shrimp recipes and this is one of my favorites.  I followed the recipe to the letter., except I marinated it all day. I marinated vegetables in Italian Dressing to go with the shrimp. I put them on separate skewers and cooked them longer than the shrimp. I served it all with rice and got rave reviews. I’ll definitely make this again.

I did it on the grill. Next time  I will use the broiler. Had a very good flavor. I would not use the green peppers next time cause they were too hard.

We loved the shrimp! Why not 5 stars? The introduction suggests alternating vegetables with the shrimp but the shrimp will be done long before onions or bell peppers - only halved cherry tomatoes will be ready with the shrimp. 
I'd suggest skewering the onions, bell peppers, and any other hard vegetables separately  and start them earlier than the shrimp.

As visiting grandfather I was cooking for persnickety grandchildren. This recipe was easy. And they and the entire family "wolfed it down!" Wasn't a shrimp left! And I had planned for leftovers! So popular we bought more shrimp and are doing it again this weekend.

These were excellent and even impressed my guests who own multiple restaurants. The only change I would make is the cut the butter in the baste by a lot. And maybe add garlic in the marinade. I always double the garlic!!

SO good! I winged it a little as I went, reducing the worchestershire and eyeballing most of the other ingredients. I skipped the white wine, but this still came out delicious and will definitely make it again.

Delicious. It is imperative that you brush the glaze on as your cooking. That is where the flavor is.

This is a mild shrimp coating but it would suit the kids and those less adventurous.  We loved the sweetness in combination with the seafood flavor.

This has to be the best shrimp that I have made in recent years. I discovered when I made this recipe Lea and Perrins worcestershire sauce which I think is my new favorite. I had never bought it because it is more expensive. It made this recipe. I was afraid that the amount of worcesershire in the recipe would overpower the shrimp but there was the perfect balance of all flavors.

This was very good!!.  We live in Alaska and have shrimp on a fairly regular basis so I was looking for something different from our regular boiled or sauced up shrimp that we normally have.  I did cut back on the Worcestershire like others had mentioned.  I didn't have quite enough honey on hand, but that didn't seem to make a difference.  I also added a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper to the marinade.  Will definitely make this one again...thank you

I made this exactly as written and I thought the flavors went well together. Several other reviews said to cut back on the Worcestershire sauce but I didn't find that it was too much. I served these with white rice and pineapple for a tasty lunch.

Delicious! Quick and easy! Exactly what I was looking for when unexpected guest came over on Labor Day.  At first I was a bit hesitant about the amount of Worcestershire sauce used but it seemed to work. I did cut the amount of butter and honey in half, still yummy, adults and all 6 kids under 4 gobbled it up.

I followed the recipe exactly and found the shrimp to be quite tasty. Keep basting on the grill and try to get some carmalization on the shrimp for superb flavor.  Be careful not to over grill and dry them out though.

the glaze was very good - i didnt use the skewers, i sauteed the shrimp in the sauce - i used pre cooked shrimp, but kinda forgot about them and they got kinda rubbery so if using precooked, only warm them up in the sauce - sauce was not as flavorful as i was expecting, was expecting more of a punch,might marinate them longer next time

This was such a great recipe.  We marinated some red and orange peppers, onions, and asparagus in the same dressing and grilled also.  We just ate it as is, but next time I may throw it over some rice or couscous.

This was delicious and very easy to prepare. I only used a half pound of shrimp and added onoins, peppers, and cherry tomatoes to the marinade. I then served this over rice pilaf. My husband and I both loved it! Definitely a repeat in our house.

Very good recipe!  I'm not usually a shrimp fan, but these were great.  I did make a couple of modifications; I didn't have wine, so I used an extra 2 T. of Italian dressing, and I skipped the honey butter altogether (in a rush) and also used medium shrimp without tails. We'll be making these again, and maybe I'll even try the honey butter!

Very good!! Loved the sweet flavor of the basting sauce. I used sherry instead of white wine...my salad dressing had a balsamic base and I used worcestershire sauce for fish/chicken...(lighter in color and flavor). Even with these changes..I will make this again. This is a tasty new way have grilled shrimp.Thanks!
