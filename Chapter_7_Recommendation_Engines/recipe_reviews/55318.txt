These came out nice fluffy and flavorful! I did add a some fresh minced chives and sprinkled some french fried onions on top and these were a great accompaniment to our fish. Basic mashed potatoes that go great with traditional dishes! Thanks MN MOM!!

Very good! I can finally make mashed potatoes - I've had disaters before! I also used a masher on the potatoes then whipped them & the other ingredients with my mixer because I like my mashed potatoes creamy! I used evaporated milk in place of the half-&-half (a little more than 1/4 cup) about 1/4 t black pepper and between 1-2 t salt. I also added about 2 t butter extract so they were more buttery flavored without the added fat/calories. Next time I'm going to try fat free evaporated milk to make them even healthier!

These were okay. I think the recipe would be better using smaller red potatoes. They needed to be cooked longer than it says and they turned out dry. If you are using Yukon gold potatoes I would suggest cutting them into eight pieces instead of four.

the lemon juisce gives it the right hit of flavor and my hubby loves it. It's flavorful and uplifting not weighed down by butter taste.

Very good. I will admit that the lemon was a bit overpowering...I don't think that I will add next time. But still very good. Thanks for the post.

These are incredibly yummy by far the best basic mashed potato recipe I've found so far. Be careful not to get overzealous with the lemon juice - if you put too much in it definitely overpowers and ruins the dish. But it does add a nice touch so I advise that you not omit it completely. Otherwise it's open to variation...i've done it with or without the half and half with roasted garlic green onions etc. All quite yum.

Great recipe! My first time to make mashed potatoes and they turned out awesome! I used more half and half than called for but I think I had more potatoes. Awesome mashed potatoes!

My wife prepared these mashed potatoes and they were good. They were a little dry with only a 1/2 cup of half-and-half but nonetheless I thought that this was a good all-around hearty batch of mashed tators. It's a winner!

We enjoyed this recipe. I did omit the lemon and left the peel on the potatoes. Thanks for sharing.

If I had not of put the lemon an egg white in myself I would not have known that it was in the potatoes. I didn't think it made any difference at all.

These potatoes were very good. I didn't see the point of the lemon except to maybe keep the potatoes from browning but then if they are in water they won't brown anyway. I did use the egg white but again did not see the point. I think that the difference in these potatoes for me was using the half and half. I think that this made the potatoes more creamy. Thanks for posting your recipe.

Like some other reviewers I was a little concerned about using uncooked egg white but I did it anyway making sure I added it quickly while potatoes were very very hot during the beginning of the mashing process. These potatoes were absolutely wonderful. They had a great flavor and were light and fluffy. No more making them the way I used to. This recipe is to be used from now on - at least on regular mashed potatoes. THANKS!!!

My mashed potatoes weren't what they could be until I tried the lemon juice. I've always got a lot of half and half left over from other dishes with nothing to do with it so this was PERFECT. I added a little garlic salt. Normally I put in the dry ranch and/or italian seasoning but this made me draw back when I reached for the cabinet. Will ALWAYS do.

I wasn't a fan. Sour and potato don't really belong in the same sentence. Sorry thanks for the recipe though.

I was very pleased with this recipe. I wish I understood what the lemon juice a egg white did but why question what works? I made about a triple batch of this but used only 1/2 cup half and half not only because that is all I had on hand but I like stiff mashed potatoes. Thanks Minnesotamom!

This is the way mashed potatoes are supposed to taste. Rich creamy and wonderful. So there's a million calories in each bite. It's so worth it. I served these delicious mashed potatoes with chicken fried steak and gravy. There's nothing I can think of that would have made this any better. Excellent!

Made these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them! Like everyone else I don't know what the egg whites do. I was a little leery of adding them at the end...I hope the heat of the potatoes cooked them? A good no frills recipe!
