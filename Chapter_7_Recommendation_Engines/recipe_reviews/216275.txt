For all you out there who think this recipe looks complicated and decide against making it, well your loss! I will let you guys know that I'm always looking for difficult recipes to test my skills, but this recipe was surprisingly easy.Also it turned out beautiful! But instead of 8 tbsp. of sugar i used 8tbsp. of homemade vanilla sugar.And instead of putting walnuts in first i left then out, carmelized them, and then sprinkled on top. Goes great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or cool whip. Definantly will do recipe again soon! Real crowd pleaser.

Just finished burning this beyond recognition!  Either baking for 40 minutes is not accurate or it was the fact that I used a cast iron skillet?  The puff pastry was golden at about 7 minutes so that is not a good indication of when it is done.  I wanted to follow the recipe even though it smelled like it was burning at about 20 minutes.  The nuts coated in the butter really got the worst of it, the pastry was not burnt.  Too bad, I was really looking forward to my first attempt at a pear dessert!

I made this for a dinner with friends who consider themselves to be "foodies".  It was easy to prepare and they loved it!  I actually prepared the pears and sugar at home and then transported the skillet with the puff pastry stored separately to my friends home.  I was able to add the puff pastry top and bake it while we ate dinner so we had a freshly baked dessert.  It was easy, delicious and a great holiday treat!
