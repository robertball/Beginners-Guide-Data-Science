I didn't make this in the bread bowl, just in a casserole dish. Some of the guests were afraid of it...it just didn't look too pretty! (I guess that's the advantage of the bread bowl LOL) There was one guy who totally demolished the dip and said it was great and wanted the recipe, so...I guess I could try it again. :)

This is a pretty good recipe.  I left out the tomatoes at the end.  I highly recommend finely chopping the artichokes before you add them.  It makes the dip a lot easier to eat and makes the dish more appealing to look at.

I tried to take even more of the 'sin' out of this by using fat free cream cheese and reduced fat Cheddar.  I will NOT do that again.  The dip turned out very watery, and the fat free cream cheese sort of has the consistency of clay.  Also, I'm not sure I would put in the Worcestershire next time--it doesn't seem to go with the other ingredients very well.

I made this recipe twice because I thought I messed up the first time....it was even worse the second time.  It tasted like creamy white enchilada sauce with out the enchilada.

You people are crazy! This has great texture and flavors, and although the worchestershire sauce is a bit odd sounding, the end result is fantastic! I always add more garlic than a recipe calls for as well, I like it practically burning my mouth! this is a great recipe, and it tastes great in a sourdough loaf.  (i don't even like sourdough except with this recipe) You definitely need to chop or even slightly blend the artichoke hearts, or just use an artichoke tapenade from the store which has the perfect consistency for this.  You must not skip the tomatoes, i use Roma because they have the best flavor and i mix it in to the rest after it is cooked.  I serve it with corn tortilla chips or french bread and it is gone in a matter of minutes! don't be afraid of texture and appearance people, and definitely don't skimp on the ingredients, this is NOT the kind of recipe you substitute soy cheese for! Just enjoy once every couple of months and it wont be a big deal, live once in a while for goodness sake!

I made mine "sinful" since my family doesn't like the taste of the fat-free cheeses. It was delicious and was gone within minutes of being served!! Also, I substituted one can of "Rotel" brand tomatoes with chiles in place of the green chiles and tomatoes.

This is a quick easy dip that is sure to be a hit, at least in my case it was a hit! I could not find white cheddar cheese so i used monterey jack cheese which worked out perfectly. I could not keep anyone away from it. Had several people ask for the recipe. Even after it cooled down and was cold, it was still a hit. My friend said she liked it cold better. Serve it hot or cold and it will be a homerun!

This was pretty good.  I think I will make it again with more cheese.  I didn't trust the part about the whole bunch of green onions because mine were so thick but I should have.  I used a 12 oz jar of marinated artichoke hearts and could have used more.  The party bunch, though, loved it!

I have made this recipe a few times now for parties and it is always a hit! I love that you bake it in the bread bowl itself, and served warm, it is delicious! A really nice change from the usual Spinach dips. 
But I have to admit, I use regular ingredients so I don't make it "sinless". Shame on me I guess! :-)

I made this for my book club and it was a big hit! It took much longer to cook than recommended but was well worth the wait. We used a bread bowl and tortilla chips to dip in it. Both were delicious!

Wow! This was a huge hit at a party I took this to! Everyone kept raving and all wanted the recipe. There was over 30 people there! I used regular sour cream. Didn't have the marinated artichokes but I did have artichoke bruschetta that had some capers in it and I added that. I added a little extra garlic. Omitted the onions. Along with the chili's I added a can of jalepenos for a bit more heat. Awe man all I can say is everyone was ooooing and aweing and saying it was the best!! I served it with baggette bread and skipped the bread bowl. Thanks for posting this recipe it's a new favorite for us!

Quick and easy to prepare and not horrible for your figure either.   Try this with Rye Bread as well.  Nice flavor added in with the bread.

White cheddar non-existant here in the cheese state, so I used sharp instead. I also added some spinach, and like all spinach dips I thought it was ho-hum when it was hot but LOVED it after it sat in the fridge!!!

It was a bit bland. Perhaps more chili peppers and/or a sharper cheese would work well.

I love this recipe! I've made it for both family and friends, and given out the recipe to many. Try different cheeses, veggies and herbs -- a truely "convertible" dip. (Which can even be heated up in the microwave and is good hot or cold!)

Suggest adding a little spice or herbs to make it more interesting - fresh dill and chives would be lovely

This was the first time I had ever made something in a bread bowl, so it may have been "cook's error", but I had difficulty getting the dip hot enough.    In the future, I will bake it in a dish as opposed to the bread bowl.  I baked for the recommended 40 minutes, but found that the dip was only lukewarm.  I continued baking for 20 minutes more, but it still was not piping hot. We went ahead and ate it so as not to delay the meal, and it was delicious. But I know it would have been even better if it had been hot.

This recipe just didn't have any oomph.  we could hardly taste the chili, or anything really. Just no flavor. I don't think I will be making this again.

Delicious! I only had 1 cup of sour cream, so I just went with that, but followed everything else exactly, otherwise. This was a huge hit, and one of the first dips to go at the party...A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
