***update 7/21/09, pitting cherries is easy, take out the stem and then shove a chopstick in the indention that the stem makes and out comes the pit - original review 7/18/09, so yummy (note to self: pitting cherries is a little messy buy a pitting thingy).  I didn't like the way it looked in the glass after I poured the cherry-pineapple over the ice, so I poured the whole thing, ice and all, back in the blender and whirred it more.  I thought (before I made it) that I'd need to add more liquid but I was wrong.  Already drank it all, and I didn't share :)

You may use frozen cherries in this, we did since fresh cherries are not always available. I also added plain yogurt and a little bit of chopped ice and pineapple juice from canned rings. My extra ingredients made a regular smoothie instead of pouring over ice. DELISH !!!

Yummy! I had some cherries that needed to be used up. This was the perfect way. I also blended in some vanilla ice cream, and sprayed some whipped topping on top. Delicious.

Kids loved it but I thought the flavor was okay. I didn''t use the ice. Next time, I would use chilled pineapples.

I've been trying to find more drinks with cherry - they're not common.  Good flavor.  I could taste plenty of the pineapple.  The problem with anything with pineapple, though, is that it's stringy, even running through the blender.  I included the juice from the can to make it easier to mix, and just mixed the heck out of it, but there was still a bit of the stringy stuff left.  (Since the pineapple is plenty liquidy I may see how well this strains before adding the cherry.)  I used frozen cherries, so also only used a couple of ice cubes.

I did not care for the texture and the taste was unremarkable.
