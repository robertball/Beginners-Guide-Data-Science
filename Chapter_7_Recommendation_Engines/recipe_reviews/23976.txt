Fantastic recipe-everyone loved it and I wouldn't change a thing. By the way, is this "Jackie's" Donna from Chester, NJ?

This is the best Scampi I have ever had!! Can't even taste the capers. This is better than any restuarant scampi I've ever had!! I omitted the clams once for just a plain Srimp scampi, but the clams were so good.

This recipe is a keeper. I no longer have to search for the right seafood Scampi Linguine. Everything right down to the capers was delicious. 
Yes, I will make this again possibly for Christmas Eve dinner.

This was such a great recipe!  It was easy and delicious, too.  I used the already cooked and peeled shrimp and added them just before serving.  Also, I used olive oil instead of butter and it tasted great.  Other than that, I followd the reciped exactly as written.  I'll will definitly be making this again and again!

So tasty.  I followed the directions with a few changes - i left out the clams and used a lawrys bell pepper and pepper seasoning i had to flavor the zucchini.  I did use the oven and oh the taste of the zucchini and dish was so delicious.  I also added about 4 teaspoons of caper juice.  Slightly salty taste, but it added a true depth to the dish that I will want to recreate many times over.    oh if i had a suggestion it would be to double the amount of zucchini and use 1/4 inch thickness when slicing.

This recipe was AMAZING!  Just wonderful.  I made it tonight for the entire family and it was a hit!  Every ingredient was perfect.  I would not change a thing!  I followed it exactly.  I have been looking for a seafood pasta recipe with a light sauce, nothing creamy and heavy.  This did the trick and I will be making this regularly from now on.  We just can't get enough!

I followed this recipe with the exception of the capers, capers and my family just don't get along so I added a little Sherry wine and this turned out so well.  It made nice hearty servings filling my wide rimmed pasta bowls beautifully.  Certainly will make again!

This recipe turned out wonderfully. Other than substituting extra shrimp instead of the clams I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results. I made it for my mom's birthday and everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good. It's not too heavy and not really buttery. It was easy to prepare and cook. The best scampi I've ever had.

Good with scallops and shrimp - but would be just as good with shrimp only to save $$$.  

Used 1/2 the butter, 2 red bell peppers.

Would be good with red pepper flakes

I don't know what to say about this except that we did not like this at all!  We love shrimp and clams, but this dish just did not work for us.  Thank you, anyway.

Excellent.  I altered just a little using yellow squash instead of zucchini and mussels instead of clams.  Squirted lemon at the end too. MMMMmmm.

Easy to make and very tasty--a light veg. sauce that is a nice change from heavier tomato or cream sauces. I thought the garlic amount looked excessive, so I used half as much and probably could have used more. I also used only three-fourths as much pasta, which was plenty. My husband loved this. Would be great with crusty bread to soak up the excess sauce.

The meal was good! My hubby didn't care for the capers in the dish, but I liked them.I thought it was too oily (that may be for the fact that I cut the seafood in half, but forgot to cut the sauce in half!).

Love this recipe! So easy to make! This is my 2nd time making it. I steamed my mussels in a white wine... and added a garlic butter sauce to the pasta. Also was a little more generous on the salt for the veggie sauté and the when boiling the pasta because otherwise, it’s a little bland (i.e. my first experience when I made it)

Since the picture of this recipe showed mussels, and not clams, I used mussels as the main ingredient in the meal.  I did include some cherrystone clams, but that was the only change I made.  It was simple to prepare, and the result was delicious.  I will definitely make this again, and may try to add a few red pepper flakes!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Amazing!!! I used zucchini, yellow squash and added scallops with the shrimp.
