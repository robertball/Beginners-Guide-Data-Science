Don't make this recipe and expect it to taste good immediately.  It's flavors really intensify over days and it keeps well for about 7-10 days, so do yourself a favor and make this recipe way in advance when you have some spare time.  The recipe creates alot of liquidmarinade, and the liquid seems to increase over the days.   Either expect to drain off alot or cut the liquid in half so that you won't have to drain any off.  I've tried the recipe both ways and have not found any reduction in flavor by initially cutting the liquid in half.  Also, know that if you use purple cabbage, it will soon color the other veggies even though the flavor will remain very nice.  I prefer to use very little purple cabbage and alot of white cabbage, because doing so creates a multi-colored salad, instead of a totally purple one.

Absolutely Awesome! I used one 16 oz Tri Blend of Cole Slaw. I halved the sugar, vinegar, mustard, oil and salt. After boiling the dressing I allowed it to cool before I poured onto the vegetable mixture. This was just the right amount of dressing. We absolutely LOVE this and my husband said that this is the best coleslaw that he has had in ages. We served this with baby back ribs and it was yummy and a great compliment. I highly recommend that you try this recipe. I am not a coleslaw fan and I can't stop eating this!

This was a very good marinated coleslaw.  I halved the recipe and used a 1 lb. bag of coleslaw mix.  It wasn't enough cabbage mixture.  I would suggest using 2-1 lb. bags for 1/2 of the recipe.  The cabbage wilts a great deal when the hot dressing is poured over it. It remained cruncy and delicious but greatly reduced in volume.  I added the additional onion but skipped the celery because I didn't have any.  I'm going to add poppyseeds to this recipe the next time I made it.  A keeper recipe!
(addendum - the second time I made this recipe I added purple cabbage for color.  Big mistake, it colored all the cabbage purple.  I had a very big bowl of purple slaw.)

This was REALLY good.  I did, however, make a number of modifications.  I used less onion (about 2/3 med. onion).  I used rice vinager.  I like my coleslaw a tad creamy so I used about 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup veg oil (this actually reduces cals/ fat from original recipe).  Also, I only used about 1/4 cup of sugar.

I changed the vinegar to half regular vinegar and half apple cider vinegar.  It took some of the "edge" off, and made it seem sweeter.
It was definitely a "10" with my guests, even the finicky kids liked it. And these kids are NOT Mikey. â˜º

This coleslaw is fabulous! It's really easy and fast to make and it tastes great.  I made this recipe yesterday.  I was looking for a dressing that didn't use mayo.  It's a definate keeper.  Thanks....

Excellent side dish.  This is very similar to a recipe my father-in-law has been making for years.  His recipe omits the carrots and dry mustard, and instead he uses a white onion and a large green pepper, diced.  To make this even easier, he doesn't heat the sugar, oil and vinegar, just mixes in a bowl and pours on top of the cabbage.  The extra juice can be used as a salad dressing (add some celery seed), or pour over cherry tomatoes.

Absolutely wonderful.  Made it for a family cookout and everybody loved it.  I took the easy way out and used coleslaw mix (2-16 oz bags) that already had the carrots in it.  Update: this time I shredded everything myself and it was even better.  I thought it was a piece of cake using my food processor.  I also added a little bit of mustard seed to the vinegar mixture as I was a little short on the dry mustard.  This will be my go to recipe when I need a slaw recipe.

I hate coleslaw but my hubby loves it, I saw this recipe and thought this would be easy to make and boy was it. Not only that it was tasted great. I was the kid in school that told a teacher I couldn't eat it because I was "alergic" and now I can't seem to get enough of this stuff. It lasts forever and has great flavor and is so simple to make! Thanks Dot this was a lifesaver, now we can have coleslaw that we both enjoy!

Yummy!  I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and it was still wonderful.  I grated the head of cabbage but next time I'll probably purchase one of the pre-shredded bags of slaw mix.  Even doing it with the food processor took a long time and made a big mess.  Even my husband, who doesn't go for slaw big time like I do commented that he liked it very much and went back for more!

Can I say "St-Hubert". Wow, I am from Quebec Canada and I LOVE the St-Hubert vinaigrette coleslaw. Finally, I can make it in my Cali home. It is awesome. And for hot summers, you don't want creamy coleslaw. You want cold delicious vinaigrette coleslaw. Thumbs up!!!!

My mother-in-law recommended this recipe, and I'm so glad she did. I used Splenda instead of table sugar and purple cabbage instead of green; I also used less sweetener and dressing overall, reducing both by 1/4 and then topped it with 2 tablespoons more of the vinegar, just to up the ratio of tang to sweet a little. We've had it with dinner every night this week! (Since my first review, I've made this several times. It's always good with one exception: I used olive oil in a pinch...and it solidified into nasty little chunks in the fridge. It softens back up when it comes to room temperature, but the texture suffers overall. I don't know if it was just my brand of oil or what, but to be safe, I won't do this with olive oil again.)

I made this for the 4th of July.  GREAT SALAD!!  I made it three days ahead, and it was perfect.  Keep in mind, though, that after it's been marinading for a couple of days, it is less bulky...if you are having a pary, you may want to double the recipe.

Very good recipe.  For 1.5 bags of coleslaw mix, I used 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp oil.  I added a little onion powder, garlic powder, dash of paprika, and celery seed.  I simplified the process by dissolving superfine sugar and the spices in the vinegar, then adding the oil.  No need to heat this mixture before tossing with the salad.

Absolutely the best coleslaw I have ever tasted.  It received rave reviews all around, even from my 15 year old daughter, who wouldn't touch cabbage if it were the last thing on earth.  Here are some small changes I made: I used a sweet white onion instead of the red; instead of chopping the onion, celery, and carrot, I ran them all through the shredder attachment of my Kitchenaid, along with the cabbage, of course.  I used apple cider vinegar, as that is all I had on hand, and, most importantly, I used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar.  What a super coleslaw--so much better than the mayonnaise based version.

This is great!! Although I made a few alterations, it turned out excellent. Didn't have carrots, so left out. Used almost a tablespoon of celery seed instead of celery and used a vidalia oinion (all I had) instead of red. I thought I had messed up because I heated the sugar with the vinegar and oil but didn't make a difference. Don't know how it would be in a few days because there wasn't any left!!! Even my "regular" cole slaw boyfriend loved it! This is my new cole slaw recipe. Thanks Angie's Dad....

First time making coleslaw: This was very easy to do with my cuisanart to grate up all the ingredients. It tastes like a very standard coleslaw if that is what you are going for. It does taste better with time so I recommend making a few days before serving.

Love this recipe. It's just so nice to make ahead & still have a crisp coleslaw.  I did reduce the oil by half, so not too oily. I also do a variation substituting rice vinegar & a teaspoon of sesame oil added.  My husband is diabetic, so I use splenda with very good results too.

I made this to go along with the honey mustard beer brauts(from this site) and the cole slaw stole the show.  Fixed it 2 days ahead and the flavors were great when I served it.  I used a 16 oz bag of shreded cabbage and carrot cole slaw mix with the half the amount of dressing.  AFter several days the purple cabbage in the mix started to turn it all purple, so next time I'll use the bag of green cabbage only.  Great side dish for lots dishes and occasions!

Excellent NO MAYO coleslaw.  Used all ingredients as written with the exception of adding about 1/4 cup of chopped red pepper.  However, I did not follow the instructions regarding heating the vinegar, oil, salt, dry mustard, and pepper - I just mixed them and poured directly over the top and tossed.  There will be plenty of marinade by the next day too as the cabbage will naturally loose water when combined with salt.   I love easy recipes that require ingredients that I have on hand!  Thanks for sharing!

Unbelievably easy to make and very tasty. I took the advice of others and cut the dressing part in half. Still had lots of liquid though. Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe in a large quantity to serve 150 at a church banquet-everyone wanted to know "who made the coleslaw?" it was the best ever. I used the amount calculator provided on this site, it made shopping for the right amount of ingredients and converting to a large quantity easy!

Super duper this is the best coleslaw in the world. Very easy to make, and it is healthier then regular coleslaw. It has a very light fresh, and hearty taste to it. Goes great with BBQ. All my friends request this at my BBQ's.

Tastes somewhat like what I remember KFC's coleslaw tasting like. I resized this to use a 1lb bag of coleslaw mix and then used this topping. Instead of white vinegar I used rice vinegar. It was great! Definitely plan on letting it sit. Twenty-four hours is necessary, but 48 would probably be even better. I'm planning on making it and leaving it in the fridge to munch on through the week. Thanks!

Very easy to make - I cut the recipe in half and used about 3/4 head cabbage, replaced the vegetable oil with extra virgin olive oil, and halved the amount of oil and sugar as suggested. A half recipe yields about 5-6 servings. We ate it the same day and it tasted superb! Thanks Dot

Made this with the leftover cabbage from cabbage rolls.
Halfed the oil and the sugar.
Everyone including kids loved it!
Next time will try with healthier oils such as Olive  mixed with flax oil.  And add some red cabbage for extra colour.

Tried it & it is not nearly as good as my tangy coleslaw.  My recipe is about 1/2 c white vinegar & same amount of vegetable oil, 1 to 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp dry mustard, l tblsp of sugar, 1 heaping tblsp of garlic powder & 1/4 tsp black pepper.  To the shredded cabbage I add 2 or 3 chopped green onions & a little celery and about 1/3 cup of shredded carrot.  Add the dressing & let set on the counter at least 2 hours before serving.
Have to adjust the exact amount of oil to vinegar ratio to allow for whether it is new or old cabbage etc.
Does not work as well on pre shredded packaged cabbage  Keeps well in fridge for about 5 days.

Loved this coleslaw!!! It goes perfect on a spicy North Carolina  pulled pork BBQ sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper!!!!  Oh one thing, I didn't have a red onion so I used a yellow....it works just fine but next time I'll use a red!

This really is the best coleslaw.  I didn't see the point in boiling the dressing before hand, especially because I marinated everything for a few days before eating it.  Awesome recipe.  Personally, I would probably add less sugar next time because I like the tart vinegar taste.  But otherwise the taste is fantastic.

One of the best things about this recipe is you can make it in advance of a gathering, but make sure you drain it really well. I decreased the amount of oil and vinegar by 1/2, but kept the other ingredients the same. It is definelty not a traditional cole slaw, but a great change and went over well at our party. It reminded me of an oriental salad, without the ramen noodles or sunflower seeds. I will make this again.

THANK YOU Dotmaytrx! Great dairy free slaw. Raw food have so many good enzymes and I detested raw cabbage & celery. This was just DELICIOUS! 
My biggest issue was eating raw spinach and I added some and boy! I do not taste the spinach. I bow to you specially since we just turned vegan! 
I had read somewhere that the raw taste of cabbage is hidden and also to help it let out excess water the chopped  cabbage needs to be soaked in salt water for an hour or so. So I did try that and no raw taste! Hurray! Then I followed the recipe by reducing the oil and used olive oil, reducing sugar and used brown sugar and reducing the vinegar and swapping it with rice & apple cider vinegar. Thank you again. Can't wait to taste it after its been marinating for days.

Absolutely delicious coleslaw. I reduced the oil by half. Next time I will let the dressing cool before tossing it with the cabbage, though. It seems a little limp. But still delicious, best coleslaw I've tried so far!

5 stars all the way.  It's been less than 24 hours since I made it up, but I can already tell it is just what I was hoping for.  I have never cared for creamy coleslaw and have had a hard time finding a good vinegar dressing.  This is it!  I did cut back on the salt to about 1/2 tbsp. and I used celery seeds instead of fresh celery as I didn't have the fresh celery in the house.  Other than that, followed the recipe and I couldn't be happier.

Okay, I did change it up a bit to save calories because I love cabbage.  i omitted the sugar and the oil completely and used cider vinegar instead. WOW !!!!!!  Couldnt be any better than this  and virtually calorie free.

This was really good.  I agree that it's best after sitting for at least a day.  I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and cut the sugar in half.  Will make this again.

I have made this several times and have gotten to the point of totally leaving out the mustard and it tastes much better without it.  I do add red pepper for taste and presentation.

Delicious, but especially after sitting for longer. My boyfriend and I made this to compliment our BBQ and it turned out delicously. We used pre-packaged slaw greens and followed the recipe exactly. I would say that using apple cider vinegar may impart for flavor for next time.

I've been making this for a couple of years now, and everyone loves it. We put it on top of pork burgers. I usually use 2 bags of packaged shredded cabbage and 3/4 cup sugar.

We have made this frequently.  It is great, but I do cut the sugar in half as we don't care for really sweet coleslaw. Other than that, it is fabulous!

This slaw is awesome.Personally, I like it the same day or next day. A word of caution if you use the tri-colored pre- packaged slaw. It will turn a very unappealing  color from the purple cabbage the longer it sits. I also like to add crushed peanuts or cashews on top.

Perfect! I used white wine vinegar (it was all that I had on hand) and less oil to reduce the fat.  I haven't let it sit for a day yet and this recipe is so good.  I can't wait to try it tomorrow!  Here's an easy way to shred cabbage/ lettuce.  Cut the head in half, through the root.  Place the flat side down on the cutting board and cut once again, through the root, so that the cabbage is cut into quarters.  Finely slice each quarter, beginning at the top and working toward the root- the thin strands will fall away.  Quick and simple. Thanks Angie's   dad!

This coleslaw was certainly one of the best I've tasted, and I've already put it into my recipe box. The only problem I found was that there was way too much dressing, the coleslaw was swimming in it. Just half would have been plenty.

This is just the sweet tangey taste of coleslaw I enjoy...I did change the White Vinegar to "Apple Cider Vinegar" for a much more healthier slaw.  I also cooled the marinade a bit before adding it to the slaw.

Too sweet, need to cut back a lot on the sugar.  This will make it even healthier for you.  Great substitute for the mayo/buttermilk recipes I normally use.

YUM!! Don't waste time shredding- buy the bagged coleslaw mix of cabbage & carrots, and just add the chopped onion & dressing. I used Vidalia onions, and it was delicious.

I have to confess, that I love very creamy cole slaw (with pineapple, no less).  This is totally different--but also very yummy!  Tart, tangy and a great side dish to almost anything barbequed.

DELICIOUS! everyone loved it, even me, and I have a deep-seated aversion to coleslaw. this recipe makes a huge bowl of the stuff, and we left it in the fridge and snacked on it; it really did get better each day. there was a good amount of liquid at the bottom of the bowl, but we just used a slotted spoon for serving. I didn't make any modifications to this recipe; it's perfect as is.

Delicious!  Tastes just like what you'd get in a good restaurant.  I cheated and used 2 bags of cole slaw mix, and I ran out of vegetable oil, so I used half vegetable and half olive oil.  Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe.  I let it sit three days before eating and drained it before serving.

This recipe was a life saver! I made it 1 week before our party & it was excellent. Don't know how anyone could call it "bland" -it's delicious. I kept tasting it throughout the week & it really does keep getting better the longer it sits. Definitely a keeper! Thanks Dot!

WOW! My first time making cole slaw and it is impressive!! I can't believe I made it!!! I'm getting ready to take some to my parents for bragging rights! I used one packet of mustard since I didn't have any dry mustard. I added poppy seeds and used one tablespoon of oil.I also scaled this recipe down for six servings. Oh, a side note, I forgot to add onion and it still was class A quality! I will add it next time! This is a definite keeper, and I thank you, Dot, for sharing!

Very good.  I just used cabbage and carrots because I didn't have onion and celery at the time. I also let the dressing cool before adding it to the salad and it did not turn everything purple.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  Tastes just like from the store.  I thought this was great - however, there's wayyyy too much liquid so next time I'm going to cut it by half.  I can't wait to see how it will improve just by sitting in the fridge.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome coleslaw.  We have it at Thanksgiving every year, it's a very good palate cleanser.  The vinegar isn't overwhelming at all, so don't be afraid of that.  I use pre-made coleslaw mix (in the bagged salad section of the grocery store.  This is even better the next day or two.

I loved this recipe, and I love the fact that it keeps for a while too. I changed the ratio to make it for 6 instead of 20. I used a bag of cole claw mix, and added a shreadded carrot, onion, and celery. It was light and tangy. Thank you for the recipe!!!

So yummy but I did make a few changes for a healthier version and no sacrifice to flavor: First, I used Splenda instead of sugar and cut it down to 1/2 cup. Used cider vinegar and cut it down to 1/2 cup. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and cut it down to 1/4 cup. Cut mustard and salt to 1/2 tablespoon each. The taste was just super even with the healthier changes. Great way to get the family to eat raw cabbage and carrots. Much healthier than the creamy mayonnaise version of coleslaw. You can give it an Asian flair by adding chopped peanuts, cilantro and mint (and use a dash of sesame oil and a tablespoon of peanut butter). Thanks!

This is a terrific coleslaw recipe and wonderful alternative to using mayonnaise based dressings. I used two 1-lb pkgs of cabbage/slaw from the grocery store which includes carrots just to speed up the process. This is a great potluck salad.

Awesome!  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and it still turned out great.  One thing, next time I'll be using a little less onion and making sure it's chopped up fine...it was a tad overpowering.  It does get better the longer you leave it in the fridge!

Excellent!! Even the grandchildren loved it.  They said it tasted the same as the St Hubert BBQ coleslaw.  I guess that was a compliment.

Good tangy coleslaw.  I prefer to use the packaged coleslaw shreds because the cabbage is thinner than I can cut it at home.  I used 1 package but think I had enough dressing for 2 packages of cabbage.

I didn't add the red onion, carrots or celery becuase I didn't have.  Made the dressing as written.  It was okay, but definitely not as good as my dad's.   It seems oily and quite bland. Probably won't make again.

This is the best coleslawever, and DOES get better as it "ages!" I used to buy coleslaw from a barbeque place that made their own, but when it went to $7.50 a pint, I started looking for alternatives. This recipe is terrific --way better than the pricey stuff. I now make it a week before I want to use it, and every day I stir it and drain out some of the liquid, or else it gets too watery.

This coleslaw is a bit oily. The red onion is a must, however it leaves quite a strong onion aftertaste. I would recommend using a food processor or buying the packaged coleslaw mix. I have made this several times over the years for large gatherings, but I am dropping it out of my repertoire because there is always so much left over.

After reading all the reviews, and being in a hurry (sigh), I did the short cut version of this recipe.  I used 2 16 oz bags of ready made slaw, which contained cabbage and carrots only. I did not have a bowl big enough to mix this so I used a large cooking pot, but rest assured it will decrease in volume.  I did not add any onion or celery, though I'm sure that would be good too.  Then as previously suggested I halved the amounts for the sugar, vinegar, oil (I used canola), salt & dry mustard.  I learned that half a tablespoon is equal to a teaspoon and a half.  I just sprinkled the amount of pepper I wanted.  Wow did this taste delicious!  I also give this recipe more "Wows" for being quick & easy to make and for having to make it ahead of time.  Thanks Dot for sharing.

"Angie's Dad's Best Cabbage Coleslaw" has a strangely addictive "sweet and sour" taste. I replaced the sugar with half the amount of honey and added a little cayenne. It was perfect for us like that. Thank you DOTMAYTRX for sharing your recipe.

This slaw is delicious, healthy, feeds a crowd, and keeps really well. I usually cut the sugar to about 1/2 a cup and add a bell pepper. The slaw is amazing after 24 hours and gets even better after 48.

Something was wrong.  After making I tasted.   Very runny and metallic tasting.   I'm a very experienced cook and grew up in the south and this is not an acceptable cole slaw.

This is a great basic recipe. I like adding dill seed into the vinegar oil mixture , gives the slaw a distinct flavour.You can also try variants of vinegar to sweeten it up a bit.

Made this as written except I scaled way back on the sugar due to personal preference. Loved the addition of mustard powder and this is by far tastier than the creamy types of slaw. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is excellent - I made it for a July 4th bbq and it was a big hit.  I am not a mayo fan so I was happy to find a vinegar-based slaw.  I used 1/2 the sugar and found it definitely sweet enough.

I had to deviate from the recipe just a little because I didn't have enough white vinegar on hand but I added apple cider vinegar to the mixture and it worked out great.  I had tons of veggies left over from my juice fast that I did the previous week, so I added broccoli and radishes to the mixture also.  The dressing is more than enough and made Alot!  Very good....definitely going to make this for my next church's pot luck! :)

Next time I make it I'm going to use 1/2 the sugar, and probably half the liquid too.  It tastes amazing!  I saved the liquid and will make more slaw this week.  I added Bragg's amino acids and a little mayo.  YUM!!

We preferred this to the last recipe we tried on this site (Colorful Coleslaw with a Kick.... or something like that), probably thanks to the vinegar. We halved the sugar but next time I would only use 1/4 C. As some have mentioned there is more sauce than you really need but I don't mind letting it soak in the fridge. We didn't have carrots so replaced it with half shredded zucchini (which my husband really enjoyed though I didn't notice it) and half shredded broccoli stalk, which I didn't notice outright but probably helped combat some of that sugar! Would try again just sans some of the sweetness.

My husband absolutely loathes coleslaw and under some family ribbing, was forced to try this one.  He loved it!  Now it is the only one I will make.  I only did the dressing, and halved it as I also used one of those 16 ounce tri-mix bags.  The dressing is the perfect blend of tart and sweet, veering more towards the tart.  I have made it several times since then (and will be my only coleslaw recipe from now on), and sometime in the future when I'm feeling energetic, I will add the onion, carrots and celery.  Thank you so much for converting my husband!

I skipped the red onion because none on hand.  Did not really measure anything but followed directions methods.  I know I used less then 1 cup of sugar as it sounded like too much...maybe 3/4 cup.  Added celery seed slaw and mustard seed to hot mixture.  Turned out pretty good.  I'll make it again with some red cabbage and onion.  Hot mixture is nice, it pre-wilts the greens nicely so no need to wait to eat.

I have been making this slaw for years now, and I love it.  If you like traditional creamy coleslaw you may not like it, but I find it fresh, crunchy, and bright, and great shredded finely on a bbq sandwich.

If you want to be the center of attention at any lunch- make this recipe. I would change absolutely nothing! sometimes I add glops of different types of ready made mustard (wholegrain, deli, dijon) and it always comes out perfect. I do put a little less salt- to keep it healthier for particular guests!

After reading the reviews, I reduced the oil to 1/2 c. and added a chopped red pepper for color.  I also used a yellow onion, and it was delicious.  Juicy, but just drain and it's fine.  I will make this again.

very good! I made this to get rid of some cabbage and take to a family event...I am not a fan of coleslaw at all and I would even eat it! Definitely a sweet and sour type of flavor.  I cut down on the sugar and oil a bit, attempting to make it just a bit more healthy.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe and I did not have the over abundance of extra juice, so I would not necessarily recommend cutting down on the amounts of liquid.

Tastes great! As other reviews have mentioned, I halved the vinegar and oil. I did not have white vinegar on hand and used rice instead. I also reduced the sugar to 2 T  and substituted dijon mustard!

I substituted Splenda for the sugar without any problem. I also decreased the oil a little bit this time to save some calories. Everyone in my family loves this recipe, even though they hate mayonnaise based coleslaw.

Very good coleslaw recipe! I usually prefer the creamy type. I was leary about the amount of sugar and also adding hot dressing to the cabbage as we like coleslaw crunchy but it was really good! The only thing I added was 1/4 tsp celery seed.

Very good recipe! It didn't get five stars because I had to make a couple of modifications - primarily, it has way too much sugar for my taste. I used about 1/3 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup white vinegar plus 1/2 cup red wine vinegar. It's still quite sweet (the red wine vinegar lends a bit of sweetness), and I would consider this the perfect cole slaw - tastes JUST like my grandmother's! Definitely gets better with age - make it at least 3-4 days ahead for maximum flavor.

Fantastic alternative to a heavy coleslaw! I used a bag of coleslaw (grated cabbage and carrots) and 1/2 a bag of grated purple cabbage to add color. I used 1/2 the dressing and from that - only 1/2 the amount of oil (i used olive oil).  The salad needs to marinate for a number of hours for the cabbage to wilt and soften up a bit! Wonderful recipe!

This recipe was just too tart and tangy.  Even after letting it sit in the fridge for a few days, it still tasted bad.  For a real good slaw recipe, try the one from "Cooking for Real" on the Food Network - that recipe is the perfect mix of tangy with a little sweet and spice.

This is the best coleslaw I've ever had.  It's a nice change from the mayo kind - I think it's even better.  As others suggested, I halved the sauce mix and sugar.  I didn't have any celery and added 1 tsp celery seed instead.  I sampled some right after I made it and couldn't stop nibbling.  I made it to go with the pulled bbq pork sandwich for dinner the next night.  I'm sure I won't have any left over to test the "melding" theory.  Thanks!

Took this to a dinner and everyone loved it!  I wasn't sure it would work because I made it only and hour before serving it but it turned out great!  And better the next day!  I also used a cabbage mix, added some extra shredded carrot (bagged as well). It was super easy. Thanks!

WOOOW!!  So easy, cheap and healthy.  I couldn't believe it when I tried it, I wasnt't expecting it to be sooo good.
I used less dressing too, to cut down on sugar and oil and make it healthier.

I was skeptical that this would taste right. I love coleslaw, and tend to like the moderately creamy kind. However, not having the supplies for a creamy slaw and with a 3/4 of a cabbage in the fridge, I tried this recipe out. I am SO impressed with how tasty it is. I followed the directions from other reviewers, and cut down on some of the ingredients- I used 3/4 c of organic cane sugar, 1/4 cup of olive oil, 3/4 cup of CIDER vinegar, and still used 1 tblsp of both salt and crushed mustard seeds (I sort of had to wing it. A rolling pin & a ziplock allowed me to crush it up for the most part!). I also opted to add about a 1 tsp of black pepper. 
I also only used carrots and cabbage, but goodness me- I will gladly be eating this for lunch all week...it makes a huge batch!

Delish! I'll make again often!!

I love it- it reminds me of the slaw at Chic-fil-a. My husband said it was the best he has ever had. I did cut the sugar, oil, vinegar, and mustard by half and used a 16 oz bag of tri slaw- and it was perfect. I thought it was actually better the first day- personal preference- I liked it better crunchy... and it gets sweeter over time. If you are like me and don't like mayo- this is the perfect coleslaw recipe.

This recipe is excellent. Its unique because the resulting product is a coleslaw  with a wonderful flavor that is similar to coleslaw but more pleasant. the longer it sits in the fridge the better it tastes.

I cannot tell you how many times I have made this recipe, and every time I get rave reviews.  I just made it again last weekend and people who don't even like coleslaw asked me for the recipe! Thank you so much, Dot, for making this part of my recipe box!  I love this coleslaw.  

BTW, I also tend to make the coleslaw the night before and then let it sit all night in my refrigerator.  I swear, it is SO much better the 2nd day!!!!

Great change of pace from the creamy coleslaw. I have been making this for awhile now and I often add chopped red pepper and/or chopped cucumber.

Very good cole slaw recipe!  I used a little less sugar, and added some celery seed; otherwise prepared as directed.  Delicious.

This was very good.  I used Splenda to cut the calories, and halved the vinaigrette because others said it was too oily.  Also added a touch of apple cider vinegar for a little more zing.

Excellent, and does get better with some age.  I substituted fake sugar, white pepper, and canola oil, and it worked well. One of the best I have had, and my thanks and congrats to Angie's Dad.

Since it is only the two of us, I scaled this recipe down to 5 servings instead of 20. I omitted the celery, and cut back the sugar a little, from 4 tbls, to 3. I used a small head of cabbage, about the size of two fists butted together and then Refrigerated it overnight, 12+ hours. This coleslaw was amazing! My husband and I loved it. We ate all of it in one day! Next time I will only halve the recipe. Thanks Dot

Yummy and easy!  My significant other cannot stand mayonnaise.  Finding a salad for an already finicky eater can be difficult.  Luckily he and others LOVED this recipe.

This was not what I was expecting after all the rave reviews.  I guess the oil base is just not for us.  I will stick with my mayonnaise base adding garlic powder, onion powder, and celery seed.

Fantastic recipe. A real hit at Easter. Some of the best coleslaw I've personally ever eaten. Made it on Wednesday for Sunday. Added purple cabbage on Saturday to add some color without turning the whole thing purple.

This recipe is fabulous. Quick and Easy-It was good the same day.  I ate some the next day was even better.  I took it with me to the cottage and everyone loved it. Even the people who don't normally like cole slaw. Everyone asks for the recipe.  This is a definate keeper. Thanks for the recipe Dot.

I've made a version of this for years, although, I used apple cider vinegar, the sugar, and oil in a pan just heated and whisked it to dissolve the sugar, and simply pour it over the slaw mixture..I also added celery seed  and chpped green pepper when handy. It was actually a recipe called to keep in fridge for up to 6 weeks..of course, we ate it up too fast!

As written, with an entire cup of sugar (!), this recipe is more of a dessert than a salad. Even when I halved the sugar I found the result cloyingly sweet. The amount of vinegar and oil suggested is likewise too much, for my tastes at least, and a lot of it ends up wasted in a large puddle at the bottom of the bowl. 

Still, by tweaking the ingredients, a five-star slaw can be had. I use a quarter cup of sugar--just enough to offset the bitterness of the cabbage. I include about a tablespoon of dijon mustard because I don't have the dried stuff in my pantry; it works great. I use roughly a half cup of rice wine vinegar plus a splash of apple cider vinegar, which is more acidic and delivers an extra hit of tartness, and somewhat less than a half cup sesame oil; hard to say, I don't really measure it, but be advised that the 3/4 cup suggested will result in a too-oily salad. I leave out the shredded carrots and celery entirely but do include maybe a tablespoon of caraway seeds. I use a half head each of green and purple cabbage, the latter of which is loaded with healthful anthocyanin compounds. The result? A beautiful, delicious five-star slaw that does indeed improve with age. Top each portion with a palmful of chopped roasted almonds and a drizzle of quality balsamic vinegar and it will blow your mind.

MAKE THIS and grandmas will come up to you and ask for the recipe.  I made it for the first time a couple weeks back and am now in charge of the coleslaw for our Easter meal. As a side for a group of about 25, I used 3 bags of coleslaw (14oz with minimal red cabbage), 3 stalks of celery, 1 red onion, and the measurements for the sauce as listed. (I think the mustard is the secret ingredient.)  Tried following one reviewer's lead by using a little apple cider vinegar...don't do it! I ended up adding extra white vinegar to make up for the loss of "zing".  I made it 3 days ahead of time.  Thank you for this recipe from me, my grandma, and my sister-in-law's grandma!

Great recipe! You definitely have to let it set for a day or two for the flavors to meld together, so make this a few days before you need to serve it.  You may also have to drain the liquid as it sits as it can accumulate quite a bit. As others have said, the heat of the dressing will make the cabbage wilt a bit.  It is still crunchy, but it decreases the volume. If you are using precut coleslaw mix, I would use 2-3 bags. 
If you want more tangy flavor, use a full cup of white vinegar.  I used 1/2 white vinegar, 1/2 red.  (One time I used plain rice vinegar instead of red because I ran out and it still turned out fine!) I definitely did not use a full cup of sugar--especially if you are doing 1/2 white 1/2 red vinegar.  My family is SUPER picky, so I had to omit the fresh celery and onion, but instead I used dried celery seed and onion powder. Otherwise, this is a wonderful,refreshing coleslaw recipe!

I used two 14 oz bags of ready made coleslaw one small vidalia onion and halved the recipe of sugar and sauce. For the vinegar I used half apple cider and half regular vinegars. I added about 1 tbsp of celery seed. This is the best make ahead coleslaw recipe I have made. I am serving it tomorrow but it was good enough to eat right after I made it

I made this for a picnic because I didn't want a mayo based slaw for an outdoor event, and I had all the ingredients.  I made half the dressing, as suggested, and when I first tasted it, I was very disappointed.  It was too sweet, and it seemed mostly flavorless.  Then I had leftovers after the slaw had spent the night in the fridge, and it was a different dish all together.  I was worried at the lack of seasoning, but the mustard came through after marinating.  The sugar and the vinegar also seemed to mix and pickle everything.  Even the flavor of the onion came through better.  I will make this again.  I am going to attempt it with slightly less sugar next time, and then I will update.  But in all I really like this recipe and suggest absolutely letting it sit in the fridge at least overnight.

Hands down, the best coleslaw I've ever had. I reduce the sugar by half, but otherwise I make exactly as written. I get compliments every time I bring this to a potluck.

I just love this recipe so much! It it so easy to prepare :) Sometimes I will use balsamic vinegar instead of the normal ones to give it a boost :) Thank you so much for the recipe :)

I made 5 GALLONS this 2 yrs ago for a wedding/BBQ.  I'm still getting requests for the recipe.  I must say I added lots of colored peppers, parsley and garlic.  Thanks Dad (and was so much better after a few days).

I have been making this coleslaw for a couple of years now and absolutely love it.  The longer it sits the better it is.  Made it for a luau (80+ people) last year and everyone raved about it.

I have used this recipe for a couple of yrs now.  I may change it up a bit now and again, but a HOT dressing is the bestest way to make slaw.  I drain the slaw after an over-nite and then mix in some mayo, I like creamy slaw.  Also, if anyone cares the real secret to great slaw is finely shredded cabbage, NOT chopped, or made with a knife, but shredded as with a mandolin or a slicing machine. Chopped cabbage is just nasty!!

This was my first time EVER making coleslaw from scratch. Used a cheese grater for the cabbage and other ingredients. Also way too much onion; half or even a fourth. Had to add mayo for kids and spouses taste and allowed liquids to cool a little before pouring on top. Better next day after its cold. But a great recipe. We're going to try the other recipes as well.

This is our favorite coleslaw recipe. I have a copy printed from 2009 (it is Jan 2015 now) and am reprinting because it is quite faded. I often use a bag of coleslaw mix and then half the other ingredients, plus I'll add 1/2 cup red onion sliced thin. Excellent recipe. You can sub extra light olive oil if you don't want to use vegetable oil. I've done it both ways and it is great either way. Thanks for a keeper!

My family is not a big fan of the mayonnaise based slaw.  This slaw was AWESOME!  We loved this recipe.  We find ourselves making slaw more often, as a side dish, in the summer months.

I make this recipe all the time, it is called Amish Cole Slaw, the recipe is from allrecipe.com data base.  If no one commented you had not let it sit and marinate long enough.  I never take it anywhere that I do not get asked for the recipe.  I refer them to allrecipes.com

Made this for Hubby's office picnic several months ago and it was a hit!! No leftovers! I thought a cup of sugar was a little agressive so I cut back to 1/2 cup. It still tasted great. Nice to have a coleslaw variation where you don't have to worry about the mayo spoiling in the heat.

This coleslaw is a nice change from the creamy type.  We enjoyed the sweet and sour taste.  I did not cook the dressing, but mixed it together and added to the cabbage mixture right away as other reviewer's suggested.  I also took the suggestion of adding some poppy seeds and celery seed.  A good summer recipe...I will make it again.  Update: I found it best to make 1/2 of the dressing recipe, otherwise it's swimming in fluid.

I love this coleslaw!! Was looking for something like this (no mayo) and decided to try. So glad I did, I can see this being a hit at large gatherings. Thanks for the recipe. (i didn't change anything). Oh and by the way as another reviewer said, don't expect to be good right after making. I made this last night and did not even taste until 24 hrs later. Bet its even going to be better tomorrow.

Great recipe!  I am allergic to eggs - so coleslaw with mayo is out.  I was happy to find this and happier yet with the final product.  I did add fresh chopped cilantro and celery seed.

I absolutely LOVE this coleslaw. I've made it dozens of times, for family gatherings, potlucks, parties, etc... and each and every time I get asked for the recipe. The only thing that I do differently is use Splenda instead of sugar (since I'm diabetic) and I only use a small amount as I like mine really tart. Great work Angie's Dad!

I'm not a fan of creamy coleslaw, so this was a great alternative. The liquid ingredients gave it just the right amount of tartness. The alterations I made were as follows, just for personal preference: I omitted onions and celery and replaced them with red cabbage and zucchini, as well as adding just a pinch of garlic powder and some slivered almonds for a nice crunch. Will definitely make again!

Absolutely the Best Coleslaw ever.  My Ricky loves it and he has never liked coleslaw before.  
I lost my recipe and was so happy to find the original as I have tried a few others which received poor reviews from you know who. 
Love it, love it, love it!

Great coleslaw recipe that doesn't have mayonnaise.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It definitely tastes better the second day onwards.

my 20 something son said "I could eat this all day!" I lik the ease of prep and simple ingredients. Next time I will use more cabbage and /or less dressing. The red onion color makes it look great.. could use yellow or white if needed

OMG (is actually what I said when I first tasted this tangy and delicious coleslaw). I used a bag of pre-cut coleslaw mix, omitted the onions and celery, and cut the recipe in half (I probably could have cut it down to 1/3 actually), and it turned out beyond my expectations. I made it 3 days ago and only opened it up today (it was pink from the purple cabbage), and honestly loved it! I am one of those people who hates creamy coleslaw, so this recipe was perfect for me - simple and delicious. I WILL be making this again without a doubt! THANKS!!

This is the best coleslaw, crunchy and very flavorful.  I don't like the creamy kinds and this one is the perfect substitute.

SOOO delicious! I usually make a coleslaw with a creamy dressing with mayonnaise, however my room mate doesn't like mayonnaise, so I decided to try this one. It wasn't a disappointment. This is definitely the one I will make from now on. No changes were made to the recipe.

This was great.  Easy to make and a nice alternative to the traditional Mayonnaise-laden cole slaw.  Will probably cut back on the vinegar aas there was plenty of liquid after sitting all night. Thanks for sharing!!

I tried this more than a year ago and it was really great. I even used purple cabbage one time and it was great. You just have to get used to the purple color. It definitely is best when you let it sit in the fridge for at least two weeks.  It gets even better.

This is German Coleslaw plus dry mustard and with the red onion instead of a yellow or "sweet" onion.  Again, very very good.  I grew up with this kind of coleslaw.  The sugar, vinegar & oil mixture does not have to be heated together.  If bringing to a pot-luck or picnic, you can keep the dressing in a separate (sealed) container and then put it on the coleslaw soon before serving.  It makes traveling easier that way.  Fantastic Always!

If anyone liks coleslaw, they love this!  It's a hit wherever I take it.  I do add more coleslaw though, since the oil/vinegar seems to 'cook down' the cabbage.

I made this two days ago (to let the flavors meld together) for a BBQ that I had last night and everyone loved it.  I used broccoli slaw and mixed it with some shredded cabbage.  I also cut back a tad on the oil but you wouldn't even miss it since the cabbage kind of pickles in the dressing if you make it a couple days in advance.

I was looking for a lower fat alternative to mayo based coleslaw and came across this one.  My family doesn't want any other now! This is fantastic. I did let the dressing cool as I was concerned about wilting...maybe needlessly.  There is alot of water and even that did not make the salad mushy. This cole slaw stayed crisp for days! (4)  until we finished it.

Thank you for a wonderful recipe, it was just what I was looking for!  I made it as is the first time, then adjusted for my own preferences the second time; I slightly reduced the amount of oil and added about 1/2 cup of diced green pepper.  It does get even better the longer it sits!

Excellent. The quantities of the ingredients is definitely made for more coleslaw than the recipe calls for. I used two 16 oz. precut coleslaw, plus two more bags of julienned carrots. If you use less slaw, than I'd reduce the amount of dressing by half. I also added 3-4 tablespoons of poppy seeds - which adds great color and texture. I ate slaw with poppy seeds in a restaurant once and have been using it at home ever since.  Amazingly, this slaw stay nice and crispy after a night in the fridge.  Great for potlucks. I will definitely make this again and never use a creamy dressing again.

This is a great salad for big parties - you can make it ahead of time and it's just as good (or better) than day-of. It is quite tangy though - I cut back on the vinegar and subbed apple cider for white, and it was still a little tart for my tastes. But everyone else loved it!

I made this with half the dressing and worked out perfectly.  Used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  It made a good amount which I nibbled on for a week.

I'm always searching for healthy recipes and needed a slaw for my pulled pork.  EVERYONE LOVED this recipe and a few stated it was the best they had ever had.  I've already put this one in MY recipe book for keeps.  Really enjoyed this.  Two changes I made were 1) used raw sugar, and 2) used cider vinegar..Really excellent and still tasted great days later

This is a great coleslaw recipe if you are not a fan of the creamy style.  My family and I do prefer the creamy style.  This would be a great slaw to take to a picnic or other outdoor activity.  Very tangy and fresh.

I followed other reviewers recommendations, and cut back on the sugar and the oil, using 2/3rds of the sugar and 1/2 the oil.  This was fantastic.  I really like creamy coleslaw but never eat it because of the mayo and the calories.  This one is a great alternative, and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing!!

OMG!! This was GREAT! My husband doesn't really care much for slaw but he loves this recipe. I wanted to make a small amount just for hot dogs but I think I'm going to have to make another batch just to eat throughout the week. Once I start eating it, I can't stop! :-) Thanks for the recipe!

I don't really like creamy cole slaws so I was very excited to try this. I made it a day ahead of time to let it sit as was recommended by other reviewers. I actually liked it better right after I made it then 2 days later. I prefer the slaw to be a little crisp and letting it sit only made it soggy. I added the sugar when I boiled the other ingredients to ensure that it dissolved. I also used two 1 lb bags of cole slaw from the grocery to make things a little easier. I will be making this again!

This recipe is great but I have come to the conclussion to only use half a cabbage and not a full one.  It makes lots and I have found out that not too many people like coleslaw and 2 people can only eat so much of it before turning into a cabbage.  This is the second time making this recipe and have enjoyed it both times...will make again.

WOW - even my kids love this, and it was very easy.  Nothing like any coleslaw I have ever had before!  I used half green and half red cabbage for visual interest.

This was very tasty. It was very easy to make, but it did take me about 1 hour, start to finish, even though I had the food processor do much of the work. As another reviewer pointed out, the cabbage does wilt when you put the dressing on but it still stays crisp. I did the recipe size that used 1 head of cabbage. My big mixing bowl wasn't big enough, so I mixed the ingredients in one of my large cooking pans. After I added the dressing, the slaw fit nicely in a couple of plastic refrigerator containers. I will do this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I figured out that the only reason I don't like cole slaw is because of the strange consistancy of the runny mayo! I added a thinly sliced serrano pepper(with seeds)for some heat. Turned out great. I used 1 pre packaged cole slaw mix for the sugar and hot liquid...waited 30 minutes and then added the second bag to keep it crunchy. A keeper!

Very refreshing...I like it without all the mayo. I keep frozen crinkle cut carrots in the freezer & chopped them up to add in recipes like this when I don't have fresh carrots on hand.

This is a terrific recipe.  I have made it about a dozen times in the past two years.  I do reduce the amount of liquid and sub Splenda for the sugar.  I buy the coleslaw mix (shredded slaw) and it really makes the recipe easy to toss together.  Love the red onion in this!  It does seem to get better and better with age.  We have never had a 10 day old batch...it's that good!  I never thought I'd like a coleslaw recipe made without mayo.  This is the best!

Terrific - I had a bag of coleslaw mix (cabbage, carrots, etc.) that was going to expire so I used that.  I followed everything else in the recipe.  My guests loved it and they asked me if I would bring it to their next BBQ.  This was made in no time using the mix! Thanks sumbitter.

Yes, this was very good I don't think I will ever make the mayo kind again.  Next time I am going to use Splenda instead of sugar.  I am very glad I found this recipe.

Delicious!  Easy to make with pre-shredded cabbage, and I got tons of compliments.  I had it for a bbq for my brother and his college friends....they LOVED it, and even the non-coleslaw lovers (myself and my husband included) totally loved it.  i'll be making this a lot in the summertime!!  thanks a lot!  :)

This was good, but I thought it was too sweet and too watery (Even tho I made it a day ahead of time). Next time I'll cut the sugar in half and all the dressing ingredients in half. Then it just might be perfect!

Very very good!  I substituted the sugar with sweet n low (for a lower carb version.)  This is much like my mum-in-law's recipe but you do not boil the mixture for hers.  In my opinion, boiling it helps the cabbage take on the taste of the dressing.

This recipe tasted pretty good, It was easy and it went well with bagged coleslaw mix.  I also omitted red cabbage because I didn't want to chop it and the whole dish tasted great.  Definitely let it sit though, I only let mine sit a few hours and it would've been better if I had made it a day ahead.

I love this slaw.  It was oh, so good and keeps for a decent period of time.  I brought my harshest critic, my son, a small sample when I finished making the slaw.  He went back 3 times for more.
I  used home grown cabbage, and next time I think I'll throw in some shredded kohlrabi and maybe even a little chopped bell pepper.  
I reduced the sugar to 3/4 of cup and I may go to 1/2 a cup next time depending upon how much chopped/shredded veg I have.

This is truly the best coleslaw Iâ€™ve ever had.  It gets better as the week goes on.  I cut back on the sugar as I donâ€™t like it too sweet.

I used raw organic cane sugar and a bit of honey instead of white sugar; didn't have any carrots. Added a tsp of carraway seeds. Making it again VERY soon!

Love this coleslaw.   Only change I make is to reduce sugar.  
Made it many many times and I have not made any coleslaw with mayo ever after I made this one.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Came out as just a veggie salad with sugar. The vinegar, veggie oil, and mustard seasonings added almost no flavor to the mix. It was a decent veggie mix... with sugar... but it tasted nothing like any cole slaw.

This was great but (for me personally) the amount of onion needs cut way down. I love onions but it was powerful. The recipe will be great with that modification. It is definitely a keeper.

The best coleslaw recipe ever.  I have made it for years and always get asked for the recipe.  I add the sugar to the oil, vinegar, etc. in a small saucepan and heat up until the sugar is dissolved.  Makes it much easier to pour on the veggies.  Make it at least a day ahead to allow the flavors to develop!

Perfect slaw. Great for large or small BBQâ€™s. Weâ€™ve made it dozens of times, and passed the recipe along to lots of folks. Fun to add additional veggies like bell peppers too. Stick to the recipe for best results!  Thank you for sharing!

Use 2 bags of slaw and 1/2 the dressing ingredients.  Be sure to marinate 8 hrs or more.

I wanted a good slaw for carnitas. I omitted the celery and used a sweet white onion that I already had, and used cider vinegar in lieu of white. It worked perfectly. I got lots of compliments.

I make this often. Great recipe as is! 

Sometimes I also change the amount of oil, or substitute different vinegar, vegetables or seasoning. Last night, I used 2 large shredded jicama, 1/2 head shredded red cabbage, one thin sliced onion, one shredded carrot, 1 teaspoon fresh minced ginger, substituted equal parts apple cider vinegar and water, omitted the oil, added the juice of 2 limes, reduced the sugar (2T honey + 2T light brown sugar), and used Ball brand pickling spices wrapped in cheese cloth in the boiling liquid. (Fresh cilantro is a nice addition, but it doesn't last long when soaked in pickling juice. So I recommend adding it only when you're ready to serve.)

Made half recipe and way too much liquid.  The sweet and savory flavors did not mix so one bite is sweet and next is tart, even though thoroughly mixed several times before serving.  Same after sitting for day or so.
Do not plan to make again

I didn't have dry mustard so I used a grainy wet one. It's very good. I let it sit for a while but it needed draining a couple of time since I didn't use as much cabbage, I will definitely make it again.

Pretty amazing coleslaw. The recipe makes a lot but it is versatile. So far we've had it with bbq, burgers, chicken and fish tacos. It's easy to tweak with veggies you have around but great as is. Thanks for sharing!

If this just tastes average to you and it does not make you say WOW, then you ate it to soon.  As many have said it's best after a few days, it with produce a lot of liquid but that's what makes it good.  We use a slotted spoon to get what we want, let the rest soak and eat off it for a week.  Healthy snack.  Try adding other veggies, we like green peppers.

Did this recipe but wanted to do a slight twist by adding poppy seed and mayo for a little creamer taste. We ate more of it then the main entrÃ©e with our baked fish. Great recipe and we really enjoyed it.

I'm not a huge fan of slaws but this was by far the best cole slaw I have ever eaten. I made it for a party and the guests were raving about it.  I was lazy so I bought a bag of premade slaw and all I needed to do was add the celery and onion. Otherwise didn't change a thing and it was amazing!  Made it 3 days in advance to let it all marinade. As a side note, I noticed people were scooping it with tostitos and so I tried it.  It was even better with that crunch. I recommend serving it with some tostisos, ramen noodles.....something with crunch on the side to top the slaw with.

Loved the flavor!  You should definitely make this and adjust the sweetness to your taste.   I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and it was too sweet for me.  I did get  compliments on how good this was but a few comments on how it was a tad bit sweet.  I'm going to make it again this weekend and just use 1/2 cup sugar this time.  I might even add more dry mustard since I like tangy.  My advice would be to start with less sugar then try it after it sits for a few hours then add more to your liking.  Thank you Dotmaytrx for sharing such and easy, tasty recipe!

Great tast! I don't care for store bought mayo so opted to try this recipe....and glad I did! Took other reviewers feedback and cut the "dressing recipe" to 1/4 and although it was good would be better if there was a little more. Next time just 1/2 the dressing will be good. Didn't cook the dressing but made sure the sugar dissolved before pouring. Used organic cider vinegar and vegetable oil....no olive oil as another reviewer reported. Will definitely make this one again.

A very good slaw recipe for those of us who aren't fond of the creamy stuff.  My family loved it too.  Next time, I'll add some finely chopped fresh jalapeÃ±os for a little kick.  Seeds removed of course...

What are the red bits in the salad? It's not red onion, the only red onion that I have ever seen is more toward purple.  The pieces kind of look like tomato  or red pepper. But these are not listed in the ingredients. It also looks like there are green pepper strips in it also.

Made this slaw to put on pulled pork I smoked. All of it together on Texas toast with tangy Carolina  style sauce it was the perfect addition.

Love this coleslaw!   I've always like vinegar and oil dressing more than mayonnaise dressing.  The awesome tangy flavor is just right.

Loved that this coleslaw lasts a long time so you can nibble on it for days.  Didnt have white vinegar so I used rice vinegar.  Next time I'll cut back on the sugar as it was a bit sweet.

This is really good and keeps well, great for outdoor food parties. I've actually been making this for over 30 years, the exact same recipe my mother in law gave me, only she called it 10 day coleslaw. Delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I read a lot of the reviews but the only change I made was to use both apple cider vinegar and  white vinegar. I am confident I didn't forget to put anything in. I made it ahead to the flavors could intensify. Nobody at the table cared for it.

Good stuff! I only gave 4 stars because I took another reviewer's suggestion to use 1/2 apple cider vinger & 1/2 white vinegar; also 1/2 celery salt & 1/2 table salt; and I didn't heat it up, just mixed the dressing in a separate bowl first. I also took the easy way out & used pre-packaged slaw. I did add red onion but I think it would be fine without. I made it a few hours in advance which was enough time for deliciousness to happen. I cooked chicken breasts in crockpot, shredded, mixed in Stubb's spicy bbq. Ate it on potato rolls with the slaw & it was so dang good!

I have used this recipie for years now and made it last night, got a craving, but I'm getting ahead of myself here, so as I was saying, made it "as is" for years.  A couple of years ago a friend gave a BBQ and he likes a tomato based sauce, heavy, sweet and with some heat so I got the idea to hold back some of the sugar, the vinegar bite cuts through the sauce & smoke nicely that way, I use the givin recipie for fried chicken, grilled meats, that sort of thing.  I have a cabin in SE Alaska and returning to my place I found the cupboard somewhat lacking, I have all of the veggies with me but let's see...vinegar, check...sugar, check...just some peanut oil, ok, but horror of horrors, no Colemans dry mustard but I did find some Atomic wasabi powder and not quite a TBLspoon of sea salt, oh well, threw it all together and it still worked!  This recipie is bullet proof and if there was a "recipie hall of fame" I would nominate it for entry

I love this recipe. I used celery seeds instead and omitted the mustard due to food allergies.  So nice to have a coleslaw recipe that doesn't have a mayo(egg) base. Thank you

This really does last a long time.  I made it for a church potluck, only to find it wasn't until the following week.  I left the coleslaw in the fridge and it was fine.  Quite tasty, a nice slaw.

This is my go to recipe when in need of cole slaw. From a picnic salad to a topping for pulled pork slider or as dinner side dish option; this is the one to use. I've even shared this with recipe (& site) to many friends.

I have never been a big fan of cole slaw, and neither is my family.   But that all changed the first time I made this recipe.  My whole family LOVES this recipe.  I am now the "cole slaw person" for every family gathering now!   Great recipe... thank you so much for posting it!  This tangy and bright recipe now graces every summer gathering we attend.

No mayo on hand, and cabbage was shredded.  I searched for "no mayo coleslaw" and found this.  I thought, what the heck, I'll try it.  I had all the ingredients.  I really like it, and even though I am anti-sugar, it didn't really taste overly sweet to me; however, knowing in my head how much sugar I dumped on it deters me from eating it.    It gets a "win" for convenience and taste; and a "lose" for sugar content.  As for the texture, having boiling dressing poured on it cooked it a tad, and it's a bit different, but still pretty good.  All in all, I prefer something with less sugar, and a tad more crunch, but hey, that's just me.  If you have no qualms with sugar, this stuff rocks.

Way to sweet for me. Good otherwise. I would recommend using 1/2 cup sugar.

This is the best Vinegar Based Coleslaw Recipe I have ever found.  I do like all kinds of Coleslaw.  For topping Pulled Pork or just to eat on it's own, you can't beat it.  I especially like it for the times when I'm avoiding certain Slaws that are full of fattening ingredients.

This was my first attempt at making coleslaw and it was so much easier than I expected. The only change I made was to use two bags of slaw mix (green cabbage, bit of red cabbage and carrot) to make my life easier. At day two it turned out really yummy but maybe a bit on the sweet side for my taste. Next time I think I'll half the sugar as others have and see how that turns out for me. All around a great coleslaw recipe.

This is a really good coleslaw, I followed the recipe for the marinde pretty closely, except that I substituted stevia in the raw packets for sugar. I mixed it with 1 16oz bag of  traditional cabbage coleslaw and 1 16oz bag of rainbow coleslaw, so it made alot.. It lasted until I finshed it, I didn't even have to throw any of it away!

I followed the recipe as listed with the exception of using rice vinegar and about 2/3 of the sugar and 1/2 the salt.  For me, it was just too sweet.  I will make this again and might add additional veggies, but would reduce the sugar even further.  I don't eat much sugar, except that in fruits, so perhaps my sensitivity is greater for the sugar.

EXCELLENT!  I didn't change a thing, and have wow'd several folks with this one. It's a keeper!  Yes, it leaves a lot of juice behind, but we just sliced up more cabbage, carrots etc and pickled another batch.  LOVE THIS!  

*ADDING NEW COMMENT 4-22-15*.  Now I grate up about 1 - 1 1/2 teaspoons of fresh ginger,  sprinkle in a little dehydrated onion flakes and 1 drained can of pineapple tidbits (or chunks). Just before serving I toss in some coarse chopped cashews.   WOWOW!  It's fantastic on day #2. The ginger brings in a fresh pop that has now made this our GO TO favorite slaw!  I've also put in fish tacos... *gasp*.. divine!!

#3 ADDITION!  I accidentally discovered that if you swap out purple cabbage for 1/3 of the green cabbage called for in the recipe  in about 7 days the whole 'slaw turned into a great "Halloween-ish" purple color !  The pineapple tidbits I add had gotten so dark purple they looked black!   It was the perfect potluck salad for a Halloween potluck. The flavor was just fine  BUT... it looked Ghoulishly purple and PERFECT!   Tooo too funny and discovered this totally by accident.

This is a great tangy recipe! I followed the recipe exactly except for the dry mustard. I used 3tablespoon of prepared mustard instead. I made this the night before our potluck dinner but it was even better for lunch following our dinner (36hrs in the fridge). I discarded some of the liquid but even if I didnt the cabbage still would've been crunchy. I made this to accompany my crockpot pulled pork and it was a hit! Im glad I made this tangy version instead of a mayo based version.

I really like the dressing used 1 Tablespoon of white Stevia instead of a cup of sugar.  Works just as well.  Really has a great flavor if made up 4hrs before you eat.  Everyone ate it and said it was great cold Slaw.

Haven't tried this version but I have a very similar recipe. For those who can't do sugar, a lesser volume of Splenda can be substituted. My recipe calls for boiling the oil and sugar along with the dry ingredients then adding this to the vegetables. This wilts the cabbage and makes the flavors good from the start. The vegetables I use are sweet onion along with diced bell and diced red peppers .... hence the name for mine 'Stop and Go Coleslaw.

I've been making this coleslaw every summer for the past few years. My family really loves it. We're not usually fans of mayo-based coleslaws so, this one was perfect. The sweet tangy taste is a great compliment to grilled meats/bbq or even in sandwiches. I've used splenda in place of the sugar before due to some diabetics in the family. It's just as good that way as well. I've also used half red cabbage before for added color but, after it sits for awhile, it turns the whole salad pink. Lol. I also followed other reviewers tips about halving the sauce ingredients. I think it's the perfect amount this way. Delicious. Thanks!

I made this using 1/2 apple cider vinegar and 1/2 white.  I also reduced the sugar greatly since we don't like salads too sweet.  It was very good and held up in the fridge for a few days.  A great change from the Mayo salads.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I couldn't give this a five because I think the recipe calls for way too much liquid.  I wish I had taken others' advice and cut it in half.  I used a yellow onion instead of red and white wine vinegar instead of regular because that's what I had on hand.  The flavors were great but I wish I didn't have to drain, therefore waste, lots of good vinegar.

This was hands-down the best coleslaw recipe I have ever had. My family requested it 2 days in a row. This is now in my favorite queue! I actually added more than the recommended amount of cabbage, but there was plenty of dressing for it!

Based on other reviews, I only used 1/2 cup of sugar to start.  After tasting it, I ended up heating the other 1/2 cup of sugar with some water to add to the slaw.  This was the perfect accompaniment to pulled pork. Thank you for the recipe!

This was a huge hit at our granddaughters high school graduation party.  I placed the salad in a stainless steel bowl nestled into an ice-bowl.  It stayed cold for the entire party and everyone asked for the recipe.  I especially thought it was great because there is no mayonnaise in the recipe making it safer to serve at outside parties. We served it alongside home made pulled-pork.  Delicious combination for a wonderful sandwich.

This was easy and good. After making once as directed, I made the following changes: 1/2 cider vinegar and 1/2 white, 3 (16 oz) bags of prepackaged slaw (to create the right proportions of dressing to cabbage for our tastes), and a few dashes of celery seed.

I made this recipe (X2) for my daughter's bridal shower and it is the best coleslaw I've ever tried and we loved it.  I did however omit the celery.  It only gets better the longer it marinates.  Definitely recommend this one.

This is good stuff. I'm on day two and it is getting better! Yummy! I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could. I did change a couple of things. I only used one celery stock and it has plenty of celery taste for me. I sub'd 1/2 a cup of the sugar for raw honey which I added to the liquid mixture. I also sub'd 1/2 the vinegar for apple cider vinegar. Delish!

made this for a 4th of July gathering and it was a hit!  I used a 16oz package of coleslaw, 12oz of broccoli slaw, and combo of white and apple cider vinegar.  I didn't have dry mustard so used Dijon instead(1 Tablespoon of prepared = 1 teaspoon of dry).  Will definitely be making this again.

This was surprisingly good! I made it as written (yesterday) and just gave it a try this morning. Nice combination on the dressing. I will be keeping this one around as a regular. I also want to read the reviews for some alterations to try. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am only giving this four stars because I altered the recipe a bit...

The flavor is amazing.  It is so light and fresh and crisp.

What I did differently:

I used two 1-lb bags of cabbage mix especially for slaw. (I ended up only using 1.5 bags actually... I compenstated for the wilting of the cabbage)
I halved the sugar content, and I would use even less next time perhaps 1/4C.  I added juice from one lime
I threw some crushed red pepper in with the boil.
I also cut down on the red onion... only 1/2 a large red onion.
I halved the vinegar amount and mixed white and apple cider. (1/4c of each)
I left out the celery, added celery salt instead.

Other than my changes, the base for this slaw is fantastic.  I will use this again.  I think you would need three to four lbs of shredded cabbage for the amounts listed in this recipe... and that is my opinion because I don't like my slaw as sweet as this recipe would be.

Very yummy - my husband said it was the best coleslaw he's had.  I probably could have cut back on the dressing - I only used about 1/2-2/3 of what I made.  Definitely tastes better with time!

This recipe really took me by surprise! I thought the end product would be a mushy but was so tired of mayo based coleslaw, I was willing to take the risk. Totally crunchy and flavorful! I was worried about the flavor at first, but this really does need to marinate at least 24 hours. It's also a bonus it can be made ahead and lasts such a long time! It is a personal thing, but I will back off a bit on the dry mustard. Thank you! I will be make this again soon!

Used a bag of slaw mix and halved everything else.  Used 1 TB olive oil in place of the veg oil.  It was good but not outstanding.  Might try apple cider vinegar next time.

Light, refreshing summer salad. I would let the mixture sit for a day, as it was a little crispier than I'd have liked. excellent alternative to a heavy mayo-based slaw. Used a lot less sugar and subbed olive oil. Forgot all about the mustard but didn't need it!

This is an excellent recipe.  Everyone in my family loved it, and there are some hard to please people in my family.  The only thing that I will change the next time I make it is cut back a little on the oil...it seemed to be just a tiny bit too oily for me, but other than that, it was great!!!

This cole slaw was awesome.  I was told by my husband's neice that it was the best coleslaw she ever had and my mother in law thought the dressing was amazing.  Only changes I made were used a 1/2 cup of sugar and added green peppers.  We ate it right away because we like crunchy coleslaw.

This recipe has been in my arsenal for about 6 years now. It is definately hands down the best coleslaw I have ever had. I would reccomend making it at least 3 days ahead of the day you intend on eating it. It does make alot, but hey it keeps for 2 weeks in the fridge! Be sure to add enough pepper for the correct bite. In my mind it puts all vinegar coleslaws to shame. Forget about mayo based. This is the best.

I cut back on the sweetness by tossing the veggies in a quarter cup of sugar instead of a full cup.  Then, I added a can of crushed pineapple to the vegetables and added the juice to the vinegar, mustard, and salt.  Allow the mixture to cook down a little for a nice, thick sauce without too much added sugar!

I made this for a large family reunion and everyone loved it. The recipe has been shared many times over and some of my relatives have added some dill. Either way delicious! We're all originally from Montreal and I was looking for a coleslaw that could compete with Montreal's style coleslaw that you get on steamies & toasties. Doesn't taste exactly the same but everyone agreed that it was even better!! : ) Thanks Angie's Dad & Angie for sharing!

I wish I could give it 6 stars! I cook for 12 people every night at a whitewater rafting outpost, so cheap and easy is what I look for. I've made it 6 hours before serving and 15 minutes before serving. Both tasted great! The guys ask for it EVERY week. This will be week 5...I use 1 package of shredded cabbage and 1 package of shredded carrots. See, I told you it was all about quick! Thanks for the recipe!!!

This coleslaw was a hit at our 4th of July party. My husband loved it so much that he actually ate the left overs and he never does that. It was also super easy to make and tastes healthier than the mayo version of coleslaw. A fresh addition to a summer meal.

Absolutely delicious.  If you are going to be eating this over the period of a few days, I would add the dressing as you go to keep the cabbage nice and crunchy.

Great recipe.... I hate the creamy coleslaw so this was a hit with my family.  It was much better the 2 days after I made it so plan aheah and make in advance and drain the excess water before serving.  I will definetely be making this again.

This is a great recipe.  I just made a batch and am questioning my decision to share it at a BBQ this afternoon - really, it is that good.

You do have to play around with the quantities of slaw to dressing if you buy a prepackaged mix.  But really, awesome recipe!

I used a bag coleslaw mix, skipped the red onions and it was really good. Next time I might half the dressing if I use a bagged coleslaw mix b/c I had a lot liquid. It just kept getting better the longer it chilled in the fridge. Perfect recipe for a mayo hater like me.

I have always preferred creamy coleslaw, but I have made this one twice. It is so refreshing! For my personal taste, I backed off on the onions and the little I used was plenty for us. Otherwise, the recipe is very good as it is, but using apple cider vinegar and a little less sugar works well, too.

It had no flavor! It took a LOT of black pepper, more dry mustard, and cayenne to make this up to par, and even then I still wasn't totally satisfied. It did get better after a few days, and I made sure to stir it frequently.

Great slaw! Used a little less sugar and subed mayo for 1/2 of the oil (used olive oil) Because I like slaw creamy style.

This was a good recipe for coleslaw.  Nice and tangy.  I only used half a cabbage because I'm the only one to eat leftovers and thats alot of cabbage for one woman.  I also used a regular onion because that's all I had.  I think it made the onion flavour a little stronger but we liked that.  I've never put onion in my coleslaw before but I probably will from now on. I'll might make again when I want something I know is good.  Other wise, I'll just keep trying new ones to find one better than my own but with less fat and/or sugar

AMAZING!  The first thing my husband said was, "are you sure you made this?"  He thought I purchased it from a famous chicken restuarant...hint, hint.  This coleslaw is so good, and it truly is better the next day!  Yummy!!

WOW! I must admit that I am in love with this 'slaw. I too cut back a little on the sugar to 3/4c and oil to 2/3c. I still had at least 1/4c of dressing that I didn't use. There is more than enough.  I did use Bragg's apple cider vinegar in place of white. This will be my staple coleslaw from here on out.  Thank you!!

So delicious!!  So glad to find a coleslaw recipe that didn't call for mayo.  I didn't have dry mustard so used regular prepared yellow mustard.  Definitely tastes more wonderful if prepared atleast 1 day ahead.  LOVE IT!!!

This is a very good recipe.  I took the advice of others and bought a 16 ounce bag of shredded slaw.  The bag was skimpy on the carrots so I bought shredded carrots to add to it.  I also added the sugar to the dressing instead of mixing it with the other ingredients.  I should have halved the vinegar, oil, and sugar as some have suggested however it still came out great because I poured the extra dressing out after I mixed it all together.  This is 5 stars because I do not like coleslaw but I love this one.  I made it for my 3 year old son who loves coleslaw with his fish and I ended up taking a small container to work to put on my hotdogs. I will be making this one again.

I have made this twice now, trying a second time because I didn't like it too much the first time and thought maybe I would give it another try. Based on the reviews. And I still think it's way too much sugar and way too much dressing. I personally don't know what all the rave is about. I guess I am partial to my mom and gramma's coleslaw, which is the kind they serve on pulled pork in their home town of NC. I won't try this one again, sorry.

I absolutely HATE mayo, so this coleslaw was perfect for me! I used a 16 ounce bag of coleslaw mix, and halved everything for the dressing. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and it turned out wonderfully! I actually did add about 2 tablespoons more of vinegar though, I love vinegar! Next time I'm going to make it with sesame oil and rice wine vinegar and brown sugar. We shall see....!

Yum! I made this twice, once as is, but reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup and adding a splash of red wine vinager. And again by substituting cider vinager for the white vinager and reducing to 1/3 cup sugar. Definatly, do not reduce more then to 1/2 cup sugar, I ended up adding more later cause it was too tart.  This is a keeper and tastes good even after days in the fridge.

Chose this version for the first time making cole slaw and turned out great, even making several substitutes and subtractions... 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. oil, 1/2 c. redwine vinegar instead of white vinegar, and the only veggie added was one large chopped leek.

Very yummy.  I made it along with some ribs, sweet potato fries, and cornbread.  It was very tasty.  The only additions to the recipe I made were 1 bag of coleslaw from the supermarket and 1 red pepper.  There wasn't that much liquid at the bottom.  I made it 2 days ahead (I mixed it a couple times to allow the liquid to touch all the cabbage), it turned out perfect.

I liked this and I usually don't like coleslaw - maybe I just didn't like the creamy kind.  I agree with others - I used the pre-packaged slaw, no celery, and 1/2 the recipe of the dressing.   I also used splenda instead of sugar.

This recipe brings back memories from my childhood. As children, we loved the slaw at VFW fish fries. . I left out the slaw and 1/2 white onion. I like the idea from the other slaw recipe and next time will add the sugar to the dressing while cooking and let it simmer for 25 minutes.

I used this recipe for father's day with a few changes.  I did a fine dice of all the veggies and I added cumin and cayenne pepper to the dressing.  This turned out great and was a lot like the coleslaw in a very good BBQ restaurant in NC.

This was very tasty and a nice change from the usual mayo based version. I made half a recipe in case it didn't go over well, but it disappeared in 2 days!  I will definitely make this one again soon.

This was really good and a nice change from creamy coleslaw.  I used 1 bag pre-shredded cabbage, omitted the celery, and halved the 'sauce' ingredients.  I didn't care for it after 4 or 5 days, but thought it was best on day 2.  Thanks!

I'll have to wait until my next batch to see if it tastes better when it sits for awhile.  I used packages of shredded cabbage and carrot, and made the dressing as is - my husband said I could keep a bowl of this in the fridge all the time!  I made it an hour before dinner and by the next day it was gone.  I can't wait to try it with celery!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was an excellent coleslaw and very easy to prepare. Also a plus for this recipe is it will keep for several days/weeks and only get better. For a little color, I add a little purple cabbage. Note: not much, as it will "dye" the green cabbage!

This was SOOO good! Even my boyfriend who hates vinegar LOVED it. I made very few moderations. I used sesame oil instead of veggie, and used 6 stalks of celery instead of 2. It was excellent!!

I wasn't impressed.  The coleslaw turned out too oily.  It might be better if I halved the amount of dressing, but I won't make it again.

It was okay, not great.  I guess with all the rave reviews I was expecting it to be spectacular.  It was fine, though.

My family adored this recipe!  It even gets better with age.
