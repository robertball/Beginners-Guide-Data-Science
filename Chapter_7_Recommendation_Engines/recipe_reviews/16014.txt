This dish was absolutely fabulous!  I did alter the recipe somewhat to include scallops and shrimp as well, and added one minced shallot to the garlic and olive oil.   I will definitely make this one again!

Good stuff. I make it a little hotter by adding hot sauce and crushed red pepper. When the store is out of mussels, I have substituted little neck clams.

I didn't think this recipe was exceptional, but it had a good flavor. If I make it again, I will include more garlic and red pepper flakes.

Oh so yummy! We like heat, so I added more than a pinch of red pepper flakes and used red wine instead of the white. Perfect Friday nite dinner. Serve with some nice crusty bread to sop up the wonderful sauce. Thanks Donna!

I dont like mussels I'm just not a seafood lover. I made this dish for my husband's birthday and he loved it. This was also my first attempt at cooking seafood. I followed the recipe exactly and now when there is a special occasion my husband asks if I'll make this so I know it must be wonderful. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This was absolutely WONDERFUL!  I must admit that I was skeptical, but it turned out fantastic.  The only change I made was to add a shallot with the garlic.  This will be the only way I make mussels at home!

Excellent!!!!.  The only thing that I added was a little bit of salt.  This is the original italian recipe, adding other ingredients like tomato paste, ketchup or sausage would be a sin.

It's not really far for me to give this more or less stars. I didn't try it but made it for my husband who likes mussels only problem is we are not able to get fresh mussels up where we live so I used frozen and they came out chewy. So I dont think the problem was the dish but the mussels, he did like the sauce with it, although it was a little light for his taste.

Wonderful! Doubled recipe for 1 1/2 lbs of mussels.  Used the dried herbs while cooking the sauce along with lots of extra garlic and a diced shallot. But also added fresh basil and oregano with the mussels which added a freshness to the taste. Used petite diced instead of crushed tomatoes.  This was easy and delicious with just some garlic bread on the side. Would definitely make again!

I did not even like mussels.  I had tried some years ago in a restaurant, they were plain and steamed and did not care for them at all.  So I got the nerve to try and cook my own. This was VERY good!  The only things I changed were I added salt, used Italian seasoning, had some leftover shallots, added those.  Used 4 cloves of garlic.  Forgot to add the red pepper flakes so I used a bit of Franks Red Hot Lime and Chili on the side.  It was delicious!  Will definately make again!

This recipe is fast, simple, and very tasty! Reduce the sauce and add to *very* al dente pasta so the flavors can meld and the broth absorb. We frequently skip the pasta and enjoy the mussels alone. Lots of garlic, 5-10 cloves and a dash of kosher salt light this up. Ground chipotle brings a little smokiness and a hint of heat. The left-over broth is great as a soup, or a base for more dishes.
2-1/2 pounds of mussels, without pasta, feeds 2 people in our house. We are looking forward to adding other shellfish to this recipe!

This recipe is great and I had never made mussels before in my life.  I used canned pasta sauce instead but my husband LOVED the mussels!  Said that they tasted like I've lived in Atlantic Canada my whole life!!

This was delicious! It was my first time cooking muscles, and I had just bought what I thought would go with them, then found the recipe. So my tomatoes were diced. I also made closer to 12 oz pasta. Delish and much easier than I had thought! I will be making this again.

I added extra fresh diced tomatoes, onions, & bell peppers and used fresh basil instead of dried. I also made it without adding the red pepper flakes to make it less spicy for others I was serving. Next time, I would add the red pepper flakes for more flavor.  I found the sauce a little watery. I might add some tomato paste next time.

My parents are from Italy and used to make this all the time when I was little. I couldn't get in touch with them to confirm how to make this, so I used this recipe and it was AWESOME, perfect mostly because the spicing instructions were perfect, and advised just enough 'heat' with the red pepper to make it tasty. We added shrimp and scallops and it was delicious. A definite keeper!!!

I followed the recipe to the "T" except I added a can of chopped clams.  I thought the flavor was absolutely amazing but the consistancy of the sauce was very watered down.  Next time I make this I will definately use a little flour to thicken it up.  But overall my family loved it!!  Thank you!!

I sauteed some onion in the oil until tender.  I also added more red pepper than the recipe called for along with a little salt.  Very, very good.

Loved it.  I added shrimp and scallops the "Spicy Grilled Shrimp" method.  I added more garlic, finly sliced green onions and less tomatoes.

This is a great recipe and has a lot of room for your personal touch.  I sauteed diced onions and green pepper with the garlic and oil in the beginning. I then added a can of diced tomatoes drained and a can of pre-seasoned marinara sauce. I used 2 lbs of mussels and a 1/2 of medium shrimp (the extra tomato sauce allowed for extra sea food).  Add a dash of red pepper and hop on the bus to tasty town! My variation makes around 6 healthy servings.

I eat mussels quite a bit. They are a favorite of mine. This recipe is bland, I am disappointed. I prefer a coconut curry sauce to this. I would not waste muscles on this recipe again. Even as a spaghetti sauce this was disappointing.

This is a very good recipe and easy to make.  I haven't made mussels since Mamma Rizzo sauce went out of business and this is a great replacement for the sauce, although not as spicy.
As another user mentioned it did need salt.  I also added garlic salt to get the flavor of additional salt and garlic.
I served it over angel hair pasta.
I'll definitely make this again.

This was a great way to serve mussels. I used diced tomatoes that already had garlic and basil. Started by sautéing onion and pepper to the skillet.  Also added a seafood mix of crab, shrimp, octopus, etc.

Excellent recipe.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Should've taken a picture.... the two available do NOT do the dish justice!

this was quick and easy and AMAZING!  i'd never cooked muscles before, so i was kind of scared about how it would turn out, but it was delicious!  a little on the salty side, which might have had something to do with the muscles i used and not the actual recipe.  either way i would definitely recommend this recipe!

It was very good, but lacked salt... I also needed to add sugar due to the tanginess of the tomatoes, and added a shallot at the suggestion of other reviews

This recipe is fantastic!  I sauteed onions with my garlic and increased the red pepper flakes by a bit.  I will definitely be making this again soon.  I am pretty much afraid of the kitchen but this recipe was a confidence booster!

It was good but needs to be kicked up a notch. Next time I will use cayenne pepper, black pepper and more garlic.

Made it but there just seemed to be something missing. Sprinkled Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning on it. Hubby and I both agreed that THAT was the kick it needed.

I really enjoyed this. I cooked the garlic until fragrant, about one minute then added all of the other ingredients except the parsley. The wine really needs to be added at the beginning so most of the alcohol cooks off, I used Merlot.  I also let the sauce simmer for longer, about 30 mins., so the flavours would meld. I like my mussels on the firmer side so I cooked them for about eight minutes but that's personal preference.  The lemon was a nice touch as it brightened the dish.  I served the mussels with home made fettuccine. I'll probably make this again but I would add more garlic and an onion or shallot. Thanks for sharing.

Its a good recipe but it always annoys me when you don't mention salt and peeper. Could make a great dish subpar.. Also can over salt if your going to post a recipe estimate how much salt you use just saying...

I made this the other night and loved it. My son hated the mussels but ate the pasta. I didn't have any linguini but used penne and it  still turned out delicious. I'll definately make this for a date night.

This was excellent, and my very picky husband said "this is a keeper!"  I didn't change any ingredients, but did add another garlic clove (we like garlic.)
