I've tried to make this cake twice and both times the cake fell despite the fact that I followed the directions exactly. It sounds so good but when I tasted it it was very heavy and greasy. I think one of the recipes that starts with a boxed mix would turn out better.

Good taste--kind of carmel-ly. Made this for my mom's birthday and she loved it! It did run over the side of my bundt pan and sank in the middle so I wasn't very pleased with how it looked. I probably won't make it again.

I also made this cake twice. The first time I used the bundt cake ban greased and floured to within 1 inch of the top and it still ran over the sides and fell. The second time I used a larger tube can pan and the cake fell. Something must be missing from the recipe.
