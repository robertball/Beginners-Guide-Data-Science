I could not add the salt--just couldn't--so I rimmed the glass with sugar.  This was a fairly tasty drink--pretty as all get out!  I think it needs something, though--maybe a little triple sec.

Made this and used fresh strawberries. Not sure exactly how much rum. I made this after the margarita mix ran out. It wasn't that good, salt wasn't necessary, but we didnâ€™t care. :)

I thought this would be a quick one person recipe but it is too salty.  I couldn't even finish it and I added about 3 times the sugar that it called for.

Not worth the effort. Too salty and too much ice. I had to add some juice to it just to get the ice crushed.
