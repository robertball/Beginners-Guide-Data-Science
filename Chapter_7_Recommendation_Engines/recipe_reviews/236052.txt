I used this recipe as a jumping off point.  I used 3 fresh chicken boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into chunks and seasoned with chili powder, salt and pepper. I browned this in oil in an oven safe pan.  I removed the chicken and set it aside.  I added the chicken broth and tomatoes and brought this to a boil.  then I added in the chicken and 2 cloves of garlic, chopped.  after 2 or three minutes in the stove I added 1 cup of lima beans and put this into the oven.  I followed the rest of the recipe as usual.  my husband said it was good, but needed some depth of flavor so he added a little bottled raspberry chipole sauce.  it must have been good as he went back for seconds.

I didn't have Southwestern Chicken Breast strips so I added a package of taco seasoning and used leftover chicken breast pieces.  Next time I will also add a can of corn to the recipe.  I loved the orzo in it.  It reminded me of enchiladas without the flour tortilla.  I will make it again.

I used chicken breast that my husband had grilled. Added salt and pepper to the orzo mixture and used both cheddar and mozzarella cheese. Turned out well and family liked it!

My whole family loved it. Made it as specified. We thought it tasted a little like chicken noodle soup, interestingly enough.

I put a cup of cheese in and cooked it. The more cheese the better. That’s the only alteration I made. Super easy! Super good!

I added seasonings per other reviews but it still didn’t have a lot of flavor. It’s pretty good though.

Everyone in my family loved this dish.  I really loved that it was simple and didn't create a mess. I read previous reviews before  making the dish and was concerned it wouldn't have enough flavor.  So I added some dried onion and minced garlic along with salt and pepper. I also used chicken breast instead of the Tyson chicken.  The sour cream and green onion are a nice addition to have.  I also had diced green chile available for my family to add as they wished.  

I will definitely be making it again.

used 1/2 cooked shredded chicken  instead of frozen chicken.  Used Mexican cheese instead of cheddar (what I had).  Put garlic powder & red pepper flakes in mixture.
Came out good.  Husband doesn't care for 'spicy' - using regular chicken was fine.  
Doubled recipe - all liked, had 2 lunches also.

Mine was delicious! Instead of canned I used two fresh tomatoes (from my dad's garden) and two fresh Serrano chiles. I added a can of corn as someone suggested and used shredded roasted chicken. I will definitely be making this again!
