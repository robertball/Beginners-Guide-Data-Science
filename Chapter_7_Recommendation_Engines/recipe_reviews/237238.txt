The day that I made these, I didn't have any shredded cheese on hand, but I made them anyway. This was one of the easiest recipes, it was quick & the croutons were DELICIOUS. They had just the right amount of everything to make them good, and my kids liked them so much they ate the leftovers without any salad. Good job Chef John!

The other half has started watching Chef John videos recreationally. He has no interest in learning how to boil water, but flags them for me to make. Last night's dinner was a Caesar Salad featuring these croutons, and shrimp blackened with the seasoning used in Chef John's Shrimp Etouffee.  Homemade dressing. It was pretty darn good.

Added these crotons to a Caesar salad which made the salad the hit off the party. The only thing I did different was doubled the seasonings. I will be making them again, but next time I will double the recipe.  Great as a snack too, because it was hard to keep everyone from eating them before they made it to the salad.

Delicious croutons. A little kick of heat, with my BIG pinch of cayenne. Only changes were-oil and garlic infused less than 3 hours, but added yummy garlic juices from my jar of minced garlic. Also skipped last step of adding the additional 1/4 cup parm. Lastly jacked the heat up to 325 for the last 15 min.

Quick and easy.   Have made these about 6 times now.   The amount of  you get at the store within the delicious croutons it outrageous but this here is a no brainer.   I've also done rosemary oil to make these (you have to use a touch less), but so good.   A healthy delicious alternative.

What an easy & delicious recipe.  I followed just as the recipe stated.  I thought they were very very good.  Mine may have been a little overdone (my oven is just hot) so I may reduce cooking time by 10 minutes or so.  Will make again...definitely.

These came out wonderful! I had a loaf of stale Einkorn bread, it was very dense and I questioned if the croutons would be good, but they were amazing! I'm guessing you can use any type of bread, I did have to cook about 5 min extra. I'm never buying the stuff out of the box again!

I was concerned that that much oil would make the croutons greasy.  You can make them with no cheese.  One-inch cuts also produce great croutons, and the bread certainly need not be stale/day-old to get great results!

I didn't think these were going to come out right as I was making them but they were delicious and the perfect crunchy texture.
 I followed the recipe exactly as written.
 I will make these many more times.

I made these just as the recipe stated.  I might have baked them a bit too long as they were a bit more crunchy then we would have liked.  They still tasted wonderful on our ceaser salad.  Will check better while baking the next time.  Real yummy!

Followed ingredients the only step I change I made was in the steps. I coated the cubes with the seasoning before pouring the oil. They came out delicious and a great orange color. I could not think of throwing the garlic away so I whipped up some brushetta for lunch too.

For $3.49 you can get a large 2.2 lb. bag of pre-cut dried bread cut into longer " sticks" as it were therefore I just skipped the 1st drying out session and then added the garlic infused oil, the seasonings and the cheese (ah, yes, Chef John, just the stuff that comes in the green container I am afraid! as per video where you told us NOT to use this) and baked 20-25 more min. Delicious! My family loved this and I couldn't stop snacking on them even before they were done! Store-bought never again!

First, we eat whole grain breads, so I save the heels and broken slices for making croutons. Second, I'm pretty loose about proportions and have had no problems even though I mixed up spices and herbs (rosemary yeah!). Third, darker bread does cook at different rates so you need to hang around the oven. Forth, I use real extra virgin olive oil -- the cheap stuff just makes insipid crunchy bits. Fifth, I solemnly swear I will never buy store croutons for as long as I can hold a knife and work on oven.

I had 1/2 loaf of rye bread that was too stale for Ruebens, which made it perfect for croutons.  This recipe was perfect for it. Homemade croutons are, by far, so much better than boxed or bagged at the store.

Five stars here!  I followed the recipe exactly the first batch and for the second one I used half melted butter and half oil.  The oil ones are perfect for a Caesar salad!  Yum!  Rave reviews!  Thanks once again, Chef!

Didn't change a thing.  After all it is Chef John's recipe!!!  I followed directions exactly as written, and I had a nice tray full of croutons.  After four of us had our crouton topped salad, (well my husband did snack on quite a few before dinner), my daughter took a small Baggie with remaining croutons for a salad at work.  Next time,  the change to be made is more bread for more croutons.  Store bought does not compare.

These are just outstanding.  I used jarred chopped garlic and added some of the liquid.   Everyone loved them.....Next time I'll double the recipe...Great for snacking....If you have any left overs, freeze them.   They'll stay crunchy and they thaw almost immediately.

If I could give these croutons 100 stars, I would!  Most delicious, flavorful, perfect degree of crispness croutons I've ever enjoyed!  It was my first time to try making these at home.  The high cost & poor quality of store-bought croutons urged me to try it.  I used stale french bread instead of baguettes & they turned out great!  Crisp without being as hard as wood.  Just the right amount of red pepper flakes.  Great for snacking too!

The best way I've found to do it is to whip it by hand instead and putting the oil a little at a time. You have more control and your mayonnaise will always emulsify as long as you don't go too quick with pouring the oil

Loved your receipt. Easy without too many ingredients. Used Good Seasons Italian Seasoning in packages and it proved excellent choice. Will make many  times over. Thanks!

OMG these were so delish!!!  Thank you for this recipe. It was easy to do. My 13 y/o son did all the work but I did the cutting. When they came out the oven, me, my mom, and son couldn't stop eating!!!  I will be going back to the store to pick up another baguette to make more. I'm eating the last of them as a late night snack!!! I will NEVER buy store brought croutons again!!!

Very good. Did not use spices and cayenne. Used fresh basil and parsley.  For softer center croutons, do not bake 45 min, cut down to 30 min.

I made these following the exact recipe and they were fantastic!!  My family loves them. Now when I make them I have to make enough for my neighbor as well. She can't boil an egg let alone make homemade croutons! Her words not mine. ??

Absolutely the best croutons ever!  I’ve made these several times and will NEVER buy store bought again.  Also, they’re my favorite after supper snack, by the handful!

Used a day old loaf of Jimmy John's bread.  These were great.  Maybe try without parmasian next time?

I'm giving this recipe a 4 but I'm sure it's 5 star.  I goofed and tried to do shortcuts.  Trying to save a step, I stirred in all my spices into the garlic and oil mixture.  When I went to strain, all my spices stayed in my fine mesh strainer.  I used 10 pieces of 3 different kinds of bread plus 1 hot dog bun.  Well, that was just too much bread.  Next time I will only use 8 pieces.  Because of so much bread, my mixture seemed a little dry after adding the garlic/oil mix so I added 1 more Tbs. of olive oil.  Oh yeah, I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil.  Flavor was good but was missing some spice so when they came out of the oven I sprinkled with garlic salt.  I will definitely make again, but with less bread and shortcuts.  LOL!  Still good.  Cooked on foil-lined tray sprayed with Pam.  Only had Parmasan cheese.  Can't afford the other stuff.
