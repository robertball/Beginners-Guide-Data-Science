I used this recipe last time I steamed artichokes and came back here to find it again. It's very good and those I shared it with thought so too. Only modification I made is that I roasted the garlic in olive oil before making the sauce instead of adding it raw.

This is a good aioli recipe. Normally we're not much into cayenne but adding just a pinch gave this a nice zip.

Delicious! Made as written and would not change a thing. Be sure to allow this to sit in the fridge for a few hours to allow the flavors to blend. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I needed some aioli NOW, so I tossed the minced garlic w/ a little bit of olive oil and microwaved it for 30 or 40 seconds, to mellow the flavor and release the flavor into the oil. Then I stirred it together with the other ingredients (skipped the cayenne), and stuck it in the fridge while the burgers cooked. Spread it on a just-grilled burger and topped with sliced avocado. OM-.... SO good! I will definitely make this again and again.

I just need a little of this so I only made 1/3 of the recipe.  I added a couple of pinches of white and cayenne pepper, and a pinch of salt.  I also added a heaping teaspoon of chopped fresh chives.  I liked this one because it called for less lemon juice than some others.  Hubs really liked it, so I know Iâ€™ll be making it again.  Served with crab cakes.

Very nice and oh so easy.  I scaled this down but made it as directed.  No changes needed.  I used this with steamed artichokes but I can't wait to try to with some grilled rosemary chicken.

I wanted to make a chicken hasselback caprese recipe that called for Kraft Garlic Aioli but I couldn't find it in the store, so I used this recipe and it was WONDERFUL!  I actually used three cloves of garlic in half a recipe because we love garlic so much.  

Since I only needed 2 TB for the recipe and didn't want any to go to waste,  we just used some more to make tuna salad and it was PERFECT!  We plan on using the rest with some shredded turkey for turkey salad.  I have a feeling that I'm going to be making full recipes on a regular basis.

I substituted key limes in the place of lemons and the flavor is out of this world.

This is ok as a garlic mayonnaise.  But lets call this what it is...garlic mayonnaise.  This is NOT aioli. For those that are a bit confused, mayo and aioli are not the same thing, not even close and not the same ingredients.

Super easy and definitely garlicky! I used 5 cloves and refrigerated it for 10 hours; it ended up being a little too strong, so next time I'll use 3 large cloves and see how that works.

This was the first time I made Aioli and it was perfect ! I couldn't believe how easy and tasty it was.  I used it for a crab cake recipe from this site.  Thank you for this recipe.

I added 3 teaspoons of guacamole to it. My husband loves it on his nachos, like at Fuzzy's Tacos.
