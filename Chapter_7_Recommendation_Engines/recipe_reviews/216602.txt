I have a time saving idea for this recipe- instead of making your own mashed potatos, just grab a tub of the ready made mashed potatos at the market!  They have plain or garlic mashed & they are quite good.  Not fake tasting like the box.  I used the plain mashed in the tub & then followed the recipe, adding the cheese's & garlic. Heated them together in a pan on low & was done in no time & my dinner came out fantastic!

I loved this recipe but, it took me 2 hours to make it (it might just be that I'm slow).
My mom is signed in and I'm only 10. I love to cook I made it all by myself but, my only suggestion is change the name "easy"
but, again I'm only 10 so that's how I feel. :)
Thanks again! :D

I made this for my family and my husband loved it. He has been trying to cut back at dinner time but had 2 servings of this dish. Healthy and cheesy.

Very easy and delicious! My husband loved this. The only thing I would do is add a little of the potato water to the potatoes when you're mashing them... I thought the mashed potatoes were a little dry. Other than that I will be using this recipe again.

i have made this recipe several times. this time i had leftover pot roast it was even better. i hade a big roast so i added extra carrots and potatoes to it. i am sure i will make it again with the ground beef because it is rare to have leftovers from pot roast at this house.

Easy & delicious. When I got groceries I just picked up a couple cups of mashed potatoes and beef gravy at the deli so it made it even easier for this Mom of two little ones who are always extra demanding right around the time I need to make dinner! We all thought it was yummy - but my "New England" husband said it did not taste like (his mom's) shepherd's pie. He still had 3 servings and is taking some for lunch tomorrow!

This was really good--I think the gravy seals the deal! I used fresh tomatoes and frozen peas/corn--added some salt and onion to the meat and BAM, my husband (who hates shepherd's pie) loved it.

I made this last night and it was a hit! I used instant mashed potatoes instead of making my own to save time and they worked very well! Next time I'm adding a little more spice to it and it was just a bit bland, but overall I love this recipe!

I thought this was good, but instead of ground beef I used 1 in. cubed flat iron steak. I also added Cabernet wine to my gravy for a little extra flavor.

Tried this tonight. It's not very flavorful as is. I will have to adjust the seasonings next time. The potatoes were bland in my opinion. I think more garlic, salt,black pepper maybe some chives and more cream cheese (or sour cream which is what I usually use) will help. Th meat filling was fine. I added diced onions,salt and pepper to taste as it was cooking but once everything was combined and baked together I thought that it TOO needed more seasoning. All in all a good start but needs adjustments FOR SURE.

Not impressed with the BBQ version.  It just didn't taste right.  I will try next time with the beef gravy.

This turned out good, not great. The time for prep is off. You have to cook the potatoes and mash them if you don't have 2 cups of leftover mashed potatoes in your fridge. Even then the prep time is worng, give it at least 30 min prep time. Don't know if I will make it again but it was fun to try and boyfriend liked it.

Perfect!  I even forgot the cream cheese at the store, so I just added a little sour cream to the mashed potatoes to make sure they were creamy enough - and my 5 year old son couldn't get enough!  Can't wait to make it again!

After his third helping, my husband said, "that was really good" (ya think?) and my extremely picky son had his mouth full and could only give me a thumbs up while shaking his head. Only put corn in, used "four cheese" instant potatoes, but still added the garlic and cream cheese, very good.

I made this recipe a couple weeks ago and I could not believe how easy AND tasty it is!  To make it even easier, I opted to use a whole package of Bob Evans refrigerated mashed potatoes heated up in the microwave and one whole jar of gravy.  I had the whole thing whipped up and in the oven within about 15 minutes.  A GREAT one-dish meal for those busy weeknights.

Made this last night, used ground turkey instead of beef (since it was all I had on hand) and just corn for the veg. It was delicious. Kids loved it and one child wanted it in his thermos for lunch today! Gourmet it is not; however if you are looking for a solid, easy recipe that will go over well, this is it.

It didn't hold together as much as I'd expect a shepherd's pie to... But it was delicious. Quick comfort food is always a winner!

So easy and very tasty.  This is a great recipe to be creative with and add what you like.  We don't care for mixed veggies so I used corn, green beans, fresh mushrooms and broccoli. May try adding a half can of cream whatever soup next time.

My pregnant daughter raved about this recipe (everyone else loved it too)!  We like more gravy with almost everything so I ended up doubling the gravy to 2 cups.  Of course, I had some sour cream in the fridge so I added a nice sized dollop to the mashed potatoes as well as the cream cheese. I'll definitely fix this again.

I love this recipe.  I exchanged the cream cheese for sour cream.  It was a hit with my family.  I layered the cheese over the beef & veggies, layered again over the mashed potatoes. Baked at 375 for 20 minutes.  Yummy!

Did not use cream cheese or gravy. Sautéed onions and mushrooms to add. Did not use meat, but black beans. Added carrots with potatoes.

The only thing I changed was to use more mashed potatoes and mozzarella cheese instead of the mixed cheese. I have to make one big suggestion. Make sure to really cook your frozen vegetables in with your meat. I did not and even after it cooked in the oven for 20 minutes, some of the veggies were cold in the middle of the dish. I look forward to seeing how the leftovers are. Also, make sure you use a lower rack in the oven. My cheese got really dark on top!

Awesome recipe. I cooked as described for 5 minutes but then added from another recipe by unrolling a can of crescent rolls over the top and sprinkling with garlic salt. Cook for an additional 10-12 minutes or until light golden brown (I followed the minutes labeled on the can). It was a delicious add-on!

I tried this recipe today and it turned out delicious! I'm always improvising so instead of frozen vegetables, I used 2 cans and I didn't use any cream cheese. next time ill use a flavor potato instead of plain and I used garlic salt when I mixed it together in place of minced kind. My husband is a happy camper to say the least! This was his first shepherd pie and he thoroughly enjoyed it! and lastly, it was so quick and easy to make! I was done in 30 minutes! ill definitely be using this recipe in the future!

My children really loved this and I thought it was quite good for an "easy" recipe.  We used a full jar of Heinz Beef Gravy (1 1/2 cups) and a full container of Bob Evans Original Mashed Potatoes (> 2 cups), just so we wouldn't have leftovers of those items, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

Absolutely Love it!!!  Made instant garlic mashed potatoes. Didn't have garlic cloves so used minced in olive oil.  Made brown gravy from a packet - it wasn't quite 1 cup so I added a little cream of mushroom soup too. Used 1 can of mixed vegetables and 1 can of green beans. Left the shredded cheddar out of the potatoes and instead piled on about 2 cups on top of the potatoes when there was 10 minutes cooking time left and let it brown just a touch. Scrumptious. Perfect comfort food!

I usually make the BBQ version of this Shepherd's Pie, with 1/2 Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and 1/2 SBR Sweet Vidalia Onion sauce, opting to use canned corn instead of frozen veggies and omitting the cream cheese (or only using a tbsp)... it's always a hit. This time, however, I followed the directions to a T. The mashed potatoes were amazing, my boyfriend said the gravy gave it a nice "homestyle Sunday dinner" feel (exactly what i was hoping for). The one thing I will change for next time is to use CANNED veggies rather than frozen. I had thawed the veggies, as directed, but they still watered down the gravy quite a bit. Since I was hoping for the super creamy beef gravy taste, I'll try the canned veggies next time. Even still, the dish was great.

Great recipe for a quick and easy meal. I used instant mashed potatoes, and I stirred in the cream cheese and shredded cheese while it was still hot. The result was incredibly creamy potatoes. Very yummy.

This is the only recipe that I have used for Shepherd's Pie. However, I leave out the cream chs and probably almost double the beef gravy. It is the easiest and tastes great!

How exactly did mashed potatoes get done in 10 mins - were they instant potatoes or were they cooked? I boiled small red potatoes, kept the skins on - nutrients. I added mushrooms, used fresh carrots and boiled them a bit so they wouldn't be dente. Honestly, once it was all done, took over an hr and 15 mins. it was a fabulous meal. We will make again.

My nephew's favorite!  I never have cream cheese so I just skip that part and use a can of corn and green beans instead of frozen veggies, I also use 2 cups of gravy and make the mashed potatoes from scratch  (I hate the box kind). I make this fairly often now.

I made it and it was excellent.  Even my Indian family, who usually don't like anything that doesn't spontaneously combust, loved it.  The only changes I made were to give the mixture a generous shot of Worchestershire Sauce and used Kraft's TexMex cheese blend.

Wanted something different for dinner tonight and it had to be quick and easy. This was perfect! I used boxed mashed potatoes and just added some shredded cheddar cheese. Even the doubters in the house went back for seconds. This one is a keeper.

Such a great quick weeknight dinner meat potatoes and veggies all in one!  I use ground lamb because to me that's what gives it's true shepherds pie taste and leave the gravy out on the side so everyone can add just what they want.  I will make again.

So yummy! And kids love it too. I used corn and peas instead of all veggies. Also found has enough flavor that I uses store brand ingredients including microwaveable potatoes. Great dinner for those on a budget like me.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The garlic added that extra bit of flavor that really made it a delicious dish.  I did use the home style butter mashed potatoes & frozen vegetables which made it easier.  Can't wait to make this again!

Did very well! My friends and i enjoyed it very much! As we say in Québec, Très fantastique!! I didn't have a square pan, but I did have a rectangular pan. I just doubled the amount of mashed potatoes, crème cheese and garlic and it was fine! 

Merci beaucoup!

I love that a ten year old tried this ... you go girl!!   
If you like taco seasoning, it works to add this to the ground beef and then add whatever veggies you like as well (my family likes corn)- and it tastes very good.    I also agree with the comments about instant mashed potatoes .... we find Idaho brand to be really good.

Super simple and super delicious! This was my first attempt at shepherd's pie, and it was a hit all the way around.

So easy and everyone loved it. Sautéed an onion before I browned ground beef.  Added salt and pepper to beef and mashed potatoes.  Used home made mashed potatoes.  Heated 35 minutes.  Will repeat.

This was really good! I did use ground turkey and Turkey gravy though, which gave it a different texture/taste than I'm used to fit Sheppard pie. Good nonetheless though. Oh and I was out of cream cheese so i just used sour cream and heavy whipping cream for the potatoes(Awesome)

Yum!  Great comfort food!  I used ground bison for a healthier, leaner meat, adding garlic & other favorite spices. I mixed about half of the cheese in with the potatoes (and used some goat cheese in that, too) , then added the rest just a few minutes before done, to prevent it from over-browning.  My hubby & I loved this!  Have made it twice in about 3 weeks, & could have it again today!

My son wanted chicken gravy (10 oz. can)in lieu of the beef gravy.  We used a 10 oz pkg of frozen mixed vegetables.  My husband loved it, but said he thought it needed more hamburger.  I would not want to use more vegetables, and will definitely try it with the beef gravy next time.  It was just a bit runny with the amount of gravy that we used.  Potatoes needed more seasoning than garlic.  We added some Zatarans Creole.  We also tried the box of the Velveeta's Shepherd's Pie on the same day to compare.  It was very hard to debate which was better.  So, if you don't want to round up all the ingredients, then use the Velveeta.

This was an excellent base recipe.  I used bob Evans mashed potatoes, 2 oz cream cheese and a little more cheese.  For the gravy, I used a lawrys packet and prepared it in the pan after browning ground beef, onions and garlic.  I added a dash of red pepper.  Very good

I normally use tomato soup, but will try it with the beef gravy.

THis was a great way to use up left over pot roast. I modified it a bit by adding a can of tomato sauce to the meat/veggie mix. It turned out great and the family loved it!

Loved this recipe!! I used leftover hamburger patties and mashed potatoes, I did add the gravy separate on top of veggies, other than that I followed exactly. I have had Shepherd's Pie from someone that came from England and this is almost exact!!! Thank you!!

Highly requested. I have made this several times following the recipe and ended up using only use the cheese on the top for our taste.
