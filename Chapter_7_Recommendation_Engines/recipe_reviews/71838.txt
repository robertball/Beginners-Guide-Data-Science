Elegant, simple & easy! I loved both the flavor & the presentation of these. I am out of pistachios so I used chopped cashews & I also stole Susan G's idea of using coconut on some....thansk for the idea Susan! My father is going to enjoy these...I know I did & I'm not that big a fan of apricots. LOL

Very easy and tasty.  I used special dark chocolate chips melted in a double boiler.  I dipped some in nuts like the recipes says to and some in sweetened coconut.  Very pretty
