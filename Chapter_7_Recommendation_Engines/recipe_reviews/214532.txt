I made these in the oven broiler instead of a grill because of all the snow outside.  I also pureed the sauce in a blender after cooking it.  Other than that I made the recipe as directed.  This turned out well and we enjoyed it.

The dipping sauce is delicious and is a good way to get the flavor of the roasted red peppers.  This is a favorite in my house!
