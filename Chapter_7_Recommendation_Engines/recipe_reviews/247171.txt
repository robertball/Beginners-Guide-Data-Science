My son in law, who is a chef makes this although he combines the cheese and everything into the sauce, so that is what I did. It is delicious. My husband and boys love it on corn, but since I am unable to eat corn for health reasons I use it on baked potatoes in place of butter or sour cream.  I have also put it on grilled asparagus.  One word: WONDERFUL!!!!!

Easy and delicious make a winning combination! I didn't grill the corn as called for, (brought a pot of salted water to the boil, put in the shucked ears, turned off the heat and let them sit 10 minutes) but this recipe made them a surprising hit! Can't wait to try with grilled corn. I served the hot sauce (and Tajin to sprinkle on top) on the side, so family could adjust  to taste  and chopped some cilantro I had on hand. We'll be enjoying this on corn on the cob as part of the regular rotation from now on!

Rave reviews from my guests. No need to change a thing in the recipe. As others have pointed out, use ancho chili as directed if you donâ€™t like your food spicy. Of course you can always heat it up with a pinch of cayenne, paprika, etc if you want to add a little heat.
