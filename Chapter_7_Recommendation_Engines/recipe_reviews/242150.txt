Omg thank you so much for sharing this recipe. My heart dropped when I got home from the store and realized that I didn't buy BBQ sauce for the sliced brisket I got.  I was out! You saved the day. I was almost out of ketchup so I only made half of a batch. I didn't have the privilege of waiting 8 hours so I simmered it for a couple min to blend flavors. It was delicious.

This is a great base. I would give it five, but as is there is WAY too much sugar. I reduced to a 1/4 cup and it was still pretty sweet. I am glad that I didn't put the whole amount and trusted my gut to start small. I also tried it again with about a TB Dijon mustard and a clove or two (1 tsp granulated) of crushed garlic.

Awesome sauce! I use this recipe all the time but the best version I’ve made has 1/4 cup of Hickory Smoked Maple Syrup (real) instead of the 3/4 cup of brown sugar. Also, if I use the sugar I cut it in half. I use Heinz ketchup which is already pretty sweet.

Cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and add a tablespoon of Dijon mustard. This is better than any store bbq sauce you can buy.

I don’t normally enjoy barbecue sauces that are sweet, but I found this one to be a really solid and versatile base. I took others’ recommendations about cutting the sugar back. I also had to improvise a bit on the Asian notes, using soy sauce instead of teriyaki because that’s what I had on hand. (Probably a good move, to further cut the sugar content for me.) I also added some garlic and smoked paprika. It is spicy and delicious.

All things good in life!  I had different flavored ketchups and combined them into the amount of ketchup required.  Absolutely delicious.  Took leftovers, added currant jelly and cooked lil smokies for football snacks. Winner!

3.2.16  I cut the brown sugar back to 1/4 cup (personal taste preference) and didn't use the liquid smoke (flavor we don't care for).  For the hot sauce, I split it between Sriracha® and Frank's, which was just about spot on for us.  I like the little bit of the Asian flavor from the teriyaki sauce and that little kick you get from the hot sauce.  Used this as a basting sauce on some grilled boneless/skinless thighs, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Joyce, thanks for sharing, this sauce has a lot of possibilities.
