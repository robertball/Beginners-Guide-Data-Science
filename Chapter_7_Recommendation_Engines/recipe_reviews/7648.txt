This is a great old fashioned kind of cake you don't see much anymore.  Some of the other people who did reviews said it was too dry and wasn't sweet enough.  I liked that it wasn't too sweet, and I found the texture to be so much better than those squishy box mix cakes.  It doesn't need a frosting, I found it was fantastic with a dusting of powdered sugar and a little cinnamon on top.  I'm going to let this sit overnight and have a piece or two tomorrow.  It'll be perfect with a cup of tea.

This cake is a wonderful cake, it is very simple I have made it now as it stands about 4 and I still have people, that ask me to make it for them... just because they love it, it have never been too dry not one of the times that I made it.

It is a very simple cake, but good, it can maybe be a morning cake with some coffee or tea. I would think, also I made it with a homemade cream cheese frosting... just wonderful...

I made this cakea coupleweeks ago and everyone loved it. My husband's friends said that it was a "perfect cake". No frosting is required. It tastes good without. If you were to use a frosting I would probably suggest a creamcheese or sourcream frosting.

very good, spices are just right. i did add 2 eggs instead of 1, and put a box of vanilla pudding in the mix.  It was nice and moist. I used cream cheese icing on it.  The family loved it. The cake was gone in one day.

This is my favorite cake on this site so far! I love it!  It is such a wonderful cake to serve with coffee. I followed the recipe exactly and I don't think it needs any changes at all. I also never have a problem with it coming out too dry. Mine is nice and moist.  A few times when I wanted something extra, I added some cream cheese frosting on top. That was absolutely delicious as well! I make this cake at least once a week in my house. Everyone loves it. Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

The texture of this cake was really nice and it came out moist.  I'm not sure but I think it was the coffee flavor that my family didn't like very much.

I have to change my review on this.  I reviewed this immediately after baking and it was very good.  However, an hour later my cake was as hard as advanced calculus!  I'm not sure what went wrong but I had to throw out my whole cake.  I will not be making this again.

Excellent flavor...just what I was looking for.  I did think it was a bit dry, but not too bad though.  I don't like coffee, so I just used orange juice instead.

I was very meticulous in the preparation of this recipe yet this cake was dry and tasted terrible.  My husband's favorite is spice cake, and he told me to throw the cake away as he would not eat any more of it.  It lacked the proper combination of spice flavors and had an odd aftertaste.

Moist and easy to make. I doubled the spices - and next time I may use espresso instead of regular coffee for more flavor.

The spices worked well together.  This is good for coffee, but I added an egg, didn't overbeat, and it was still on the dry side.  Next time (if there is a next time) I may add a half cup of applesauce or even mayonnaise.  When it had cooled, I poured a caramel sauce (from Caramel frosting VI on AR) over the top of it which combatted the dryness of the cake a bit.

This is a great cake! After reading the reviews I was a bit concerned about the "dryness" and "hard" but I added 1/4 of a stick of butter to the mix and it made the cake perfect. Not too dry at all.

This cake had a nice flavor but came out dry and very dense. I would make it again if I could figure out how to make it more moist and with a lighter texture.

This cake was on the dry side, and it seemed to be missing some other spice.
It wasn't real bad but I don't think I will be adding it to my recipe box.

A very easy cake to make but  my family wanted more spice and flavor.  The next time I made it, I doubled the cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves and everybody loved the result.  I think a warm vanilla or lemon sauce over the top would add a lot of flavor.

This cake is very flavorful. Since I'm not much of a fan of nutmeg, I made two versions of this--one with nutmeg and one without. Without it, the taste of cloves is strong. Actually, I prefer the nutmeg. It tasted better the next day, after the spices really settled in. A comforting, little cake. Some reviewers said their cakes were dry and hard; store it in a plastic container with a lid and your cake will be moist and soft.

My son used this recipe for his 4-H foods project.  He needed to make an unfrosted cake for his project, so I was looking for a cake that had lots of flavor and moisture.  What would be great to fill this bill?  Spice Cake!! 
 We did as some of the other reviewers suggested and added 1/2 c. of applesauce to the recipe.  We omitted the cloves because we just don't like the taste of cloves (and I didn't have them on hand).  We baked the recipe according to time and temperature directions of the recipe.  We ended up with a big crack in top of our cake!
So, round two, we lowered the baking temperature to 325 degrees and extended the time to 50 minutes.  TURNED OUT PERFECT!!  As a matter of fact, the judge said that this was an almost perfect cake!!  He got a blue ribbon and is taking his cake to state fair!!
I gave the recipe only 4 stars because I did have to alter the original recipe twice (the applesauce and the time).  Otherwise this is an excellent cake!!

My family and I absolutely LOVE this cake!!  I make this all the time now and my 5 kids fight my husband and I for the last piece.
