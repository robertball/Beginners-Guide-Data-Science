I found this recipe intriguing and made it as written.  Found there was far too little liquid for soup and added three more cups of chicken stock. I tripled the helpings of herbs and next time, and there will be a next time. will use fresh garlic, at least two cloves. With the green pepper flavor, might add cumin. 

Recipe said to peel squash which was impossible due to hard shell.  Split and put in microwave until just able to spoon out and then cut meat in 3" pieces.  Took 8 to 10 minutes in microwave.  It was unbelievably good and my husband loved it.  And incredibly easy.  Gave a four as I had to add a lot.

Great recipe!  I used half a spaghetti squash, and yes, you do need to cook it a little first or you'll never get it out of the shell.  I  cut mine in half and put it in the microwave for 8 minutes and then was able to easily scoop it out.  I just put the chicken in first (whole breasts, not diced), put the squash on top and then poured everything over it.  I used a full can of chicken broth but did not add any extra liquid beyond that.  I used generous amounts of all the seasonings.  When we were ready to serve I shredded the chicken breasts.  Topped with Parmesan cheese.  Very good.

I liked this recipe as a starting point, but I think needs tweaking to personal preference.  I agree with the comments about not enough liquid - but then again what is 12 oz of spaghetti squash? The average squash is 2-3# so was the intent 1/4 of a squash? I used a whole medium squash, 2 large chicken breasts and 4c chicken stock.  Plus a bay leaf for extra seasoning.  Next time I'll start with onion, celery and carrot like all good soups have.  Not bad though, and definitely healthy!

this was so good, I did dice the chicken and baked my squash so it was easier to scoop out. I did add chopped onion and carrot with fresh garlic and I added some tomato/ chicken  bouillon.  the crockpot was full and there is none left. very tasty!!

My husband and I grew at least 30 spaghetti squashes this summer, so I'm looking for recipes to use the ones I didn't give away... This recipe is great! We didn't add more liquid, like others recommended, as we like our soups "meaty." We did substitute garlic for any of the salt, as we don't use salt. Great recipe.

I substituted andouille sausage for chicken, and added rinsed black beans and cumin. It did thicken up a little as it cooked,  I added some more broth.  We topped it with sour cream and shredded cheese. Delicious!

Great recipe - added more chicken stock as others had written and more herbs. Added some bloody mary mix in to give it a kick.

I loved this recipe. I agree with KJHONS about the liquid. I ended up using 4 cups of chicken broth and it made enough soup for 4-5 servings. I had two left over chicken leg quarters, so I used them instead of chicken breast. I didn't use onion powder due to allergies and I was out of basil but otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. I will definitely be making this dish again.
