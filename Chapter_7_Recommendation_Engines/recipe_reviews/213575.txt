This recipe is OUTSTANDING! Husband says he would give it 6 stars if possible. I did alter the recipe a bit... I'm sure fresh peppers/onions/celery would be better, but I used frozen seasoning mix to save time. I also used Tony Chachere's® Creole Seasoning in place of the salt/pepper for more Cajun flavor. One tasty addition that I would recommend: I added about a half cup of corn, which provided a bit of sweetness and a little crunch. I also placed a top crust on the pie, but then again, I like a lot of crust. Two forks up from us!

I omitted the celery and replaced it with a can of cream of celery.  I also omitted the water and flour.  And I used about 2 pounds of crawfish, and some creole seasoning.  It was easily the best seafood dish I have ever had anywhere.

I cooked this for the first time this weekend. We had a crawfish boil the day before and had crawfish tails that needed to be used. I doubled my recipe as I was cooking for a pretty large group. I used the store bought pie crust. First sauted onions, bell peppers, celery in butter. Then added some chopped garlic. Then added diced tomatoes, cream of mushroom soup, evaporated milk, and Tony Chachere's seasoning along with garlic powder (and cajun seasoning will do). I let this all come to a medium boil and then added cornstarch to thicken. Placed all of the filling into  the buttered pie crusts and baked. It was amazing. Will be making this again. Next time I will add green onions to the filling.

Great recipe! I suggest tasting the filling before you take it off of the heat. Ours tasted a little bland so we added some Tony Chachere's seasoning to taste. I'm sure you could substitute your favorite salty cajun seasoning.

This was awesome! I took advice from another reviewer & added cream of mushroom & diced tomatoes, actually Rotel. Oh and instead of corn starch to thicken it, I accidentally used corn meal, so it was still a little runny! lol! I mixed a little shredded cheese with mayo and spread it on top to give a different topping. Next time I'm going to add a top crust & maybe a little chicken. Oh yea, I'll omit the corn meal next time too!

Great recipe!! So easy and the flavor was wonderful. I would recommend this to any one. I did cover it with a store bought pie crust. It will remain on my favorite list!! I could have used two 12 ounce packs of crawfish meat, especially since I covered the filling.

Great recipe. Wish I could have gave more stars. Like others have done, I also added Tony Chacheries, a can of mushroom soup and a third can of rotel tomatoes per pie. Before I added the soup I added one tbsp. of Kary's Roux, for that Cajun taste, and a small amount of ketchup to the mixture. Black pepper and garlic to taste. As some other people have done, I also covered the mixture with another pie shell. Too thicken, I added a little water and a tablespoon of cornstach. If it thickens too much just add a tad more water. This pie was the best crawfish pie that I have ever tasted, bar none. Just wish I would have had fresh crawfish from a crawfish boil, instead of frozen from China. Thanks for the recipe!

While the recipe turned out a very tasty, satisfying dish, three areas need considering, spicing, liquid and technique:
1) The amount of cayenne pepper may be overpowering unless your guests like it really spicy.
2) The amount of liquid the recipe suggests (1 cup water) is too much and will produce a watery, soupy outcome. I found a scant 2/3 cup sufficient liquid and substituted Chardonnay for the water.
3) You cannot mix 2 Tbsp flour in 1 cup liquid without getting lumps and lots of them. The proper way is to add the flour to the sauté-ed veggies, mix it in thoroughly and continue to sauté for about 60 to 90 seconds. This thickens the small amount of liquid in the pan and cooks the starchy taste out of the flour. Following that, add the larger amount of liquid a little at a time, allow to thicken, add more and so on until you have the thickness desired.

I did pre-bake the bottom crust for about 15 minutes to prevent the liquid from soaking in. I also did not use a top crust. If you do, apply an egg yolk wash to the top about 10 minutes before done to create a nicely browned top.

Delicious!  I altered the recipe by adding some yellow squash that I had on hand.  I didn't use any water at all - just added the flour right into the veggie/crawfish mix.  It thickened right up.  I also added a crust on top of the pie.  And I used 2 Tablespoons of Creole Seasoning (we like our spicy!).

This was very good.  I added garlic and used Rotel tomatoes.  Also, I used shrimp stock in the place of water.  We loved it!

Yummy!  I had leftovers from a big crawfish boil in our subdivision and made this the next day.  Didn't change a thing.  Hubby and I are finishing it up tonight - can't wait!

This was wonderful. We had tons of crawfish left over and used the tails to make a few of these pies. Made it exactly as the recipe, except we made our own crust. Good stuff. Will be using this recipe every year from here on out during crawfish season.

This is delicious!! I added mushrooms and instead of butter I used a lighter version. Next time I'm going to try less water bc it was a little runny but still absolutely delicious!! It takes some time to make but well worth it :)

Finally found a recipe that makes a firm pie.  I'll cut the salt and cayenne in half next time.  Too much of each.  used about 1/4 cup water, not a full cup.  I think the trick to thickening it is letting it cool for 20 minutes prior to putting it in the shell. Excellent idea!

The strong five star review is well deserved. Makes a very enjoyable and tasty meal. Easy to make, and affords lots of time to do other things while it's resting and baking.

Used 2 pounds of crawfish tail meat. Substituted 1 can cream of celery soup for water. Seasoned as written plus added Slap Ya Mama cajun seasoning. It was a little runny after stirring in the diced tomatoes and crawfish tails, and drained off most of the excess liquid. Next time, I'll drain the tomatoes before adding to skillet. Nice recipe, Randy!

Awesome!  Tried a few variations.  If you add corn it takes some of the heat out.

This recipe is so good! I placed my own twist in it with seasoning. It tastes like a gumbo pie.
