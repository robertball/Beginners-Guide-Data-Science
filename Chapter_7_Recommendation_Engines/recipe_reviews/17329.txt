These cookies need 1 tsp vanilla extract to bring out the full flavor of the pecans.

I baked these cookies because I had lots of pecans in the cupboard.  I don't bake very often, but thought they needed something... not sure what.  My husband liked them but I thought it was just an average cookie.

These are absolutely amazing. I won't even try another recipe! I didn't get the full 5 dozen out of them, but they are so easy to make, doing another batch is just fine!

These had a wonderful buttery flavor.  I used salted butter and toasted the finely chopped pecans for extra flavor.  They had a nice crisp texture which we prefer.
