Smooth, creamy and delicious - plus it's oh so chocolatey! If you find yourself having a chocolate craving this will give you your "fix"! The only other thing I added was some additional chocolate syrup drizzled on top - YUM!

I just made this for a mid-day snack---wow! It is very chocolate-y! I used Whoopers candies. Reminded me of the Frosties we used to get at Wendy's. Could easily be varied by whatever chocolate candy you use. Genius idea to add chocolate candy to the traditional milkshake! Thanks Austin!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and was in a quandry whether the first 1/2 cup of whipped cream should have just been the liquid heavy whipping cream.  Well I made the whipped cream and when blending all the ingredients as shown, my blender's motor started to burn out.  I needed to add some liquid which I did 1/8c of milk and then it blended but by this time the blender was ruined.

Just made this for my kids. They loved it. I did mix some vanilla with the chocolate ice cream and added milk to thin it out.

Thought this was a surefire, but the bits of chocolate didn't completely blend which resulted in a lot of chewing and a not smooth texture.

What a great milkshake, it looks delicious! I actually have all the ingredients to make this. It would be a great way to use up left over Easter candy that is sitting in our freezer. 1) Ice cream 2) candy 3) whipped cream! Iâ€™d love for you to link up to my sweet treats party this weekend!
