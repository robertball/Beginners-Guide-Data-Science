I made these for Christmas gifts a few days in advance.  On Christmas Eve I noticed that they no longer were smooth, but rough and spotty looking.  I made up a quick new batch with a tad of shortening and they still look beautiful.

These are really great!  The're fast, easy, inexpensive, and look impressive, too! They sell for $1.79 each at our specialty store. I made them for less than 20 cents. I did drizzle mine with white chocolate. I also used small candy bags to put them in and attached them to the handle of a coffee mug that had the cappuccino mix from the site in it. Add a bow and it makes a nice gift!

Works perfectly.  I wrapped mine in a square of cello wrap and tied with a bit of ribbon. Note that if you put them in the fridge right away you may get a sugar bloom (as I did).  You may want to let the chocolate cool to room temperature before putting in the fridge - this should avoid the problem.

Wonderfully delicious little spoon! To my Christmas gift cups, I attached the spoon to the handle, and inside the cup put a small bag of hot choc. mix enclosed in a plastic bag inside a  little fabric print bag with small bow on it, and a small plastic bag holding two heart shaped home-made marshmallows. The marshmallow recipe is found in Martha Stewart's recipes on the Oprah site. Judy

I added a little shortening as suggested by another viewer.  I also added crushed peppermint candies to a few and marshmallows and chopped nuts to others with drizzles of dark chocolate.  They turned out great.  I made them for a craft fair to sell along side our hot chocolate.  They were a big hit!!

Yummy :)  I make these using spoon molds (I'm not sure where you get them; my mother-in-law gave them to me) and a special kind of chocolate that is used for the molds (higher amount of parafin so that the chocolate hardens and keeps its shape).  One note - when making this recipe, make sure you use a high quality (i.e. name brand) of chocolate chips; the store brand doesn't seem to harden back up enough and you end up with a bit of a gooey mess :)

I am writing this review with the most delicious cup of chocolate caramel coffee at my side.  I crushed Werther's Originals and sprinkled them on the chocolate covered spoons I had made.  OUTSTANDING!  I thought it would be easy to cover the spoons but found that first I had to covered the back with chocolate, let that harden; then, fill the spoon with chocolate and let that harden.  For some reason I thought I would be able to "dip and go".  Once I filled the front with chocolate, I sprinkled on the Werther's Originals.  (I crushed them till they were almost powder like so they melt nice in the coffee).  To let them "dry", I happened to have a box sitting on the table so I slid the handle of the spoon under the flap of the box.  This way the chocolate didn't get smashed.  They looked very nice.

Loved this recipe!  I added raspberry flavoring and drizzled white chocolate on top.  My two daughters & I made 90+ for favors at my 40th birthday celebration. (They didn't all make it to the party!)What a neat treat:)

These turned out very nicely. They look great! I did change things, but this is a great idea. I used white and chocolate almond bark instead of the chips and skipped the refrigeration step. It doesn't seem necessary, and air drying will take care of any sugar blooms that people complain of. I waited for the first layer to harden, then drizzled the white chocolate over top. I used plastic spoons, but in retrospect, I should have gone to the dollar store for some cheap-o silverware. That would have looked nicer; I will be sure to do that next time I make these. Thank you :)

These turned out great. I made these along with Irish Cream and Cappuccino Mix from this site. I gave them to my mother-in-law for Mother's Day along with a nice coffee cup. She really enjoyed the thoughtfulness of a homemade gift. Try it. All the recipes are quick and easy.

I made this once for fun with some leftover chocolate. Most microwaves at 2-3 minutes will burn chocolate. 1 minute in the microwave and stirring after 30 seconds, should be sufficient. To make the drizzling chocolate easier, once melted add some vegetable oil 1 tsp. at a time to thin it out. A bag is not needed then, because it will drizzle great with a fork or spoon held above and moved back and forth around the chocolate spoons. Try some white chocolate to for a nice contrasting color! With that being said I always wondered what people did with these? It is kind of hard eating hardened chocolate off of a spoon. I am guessing for hot drinks? They have an elegant appeal to them anyway.

Excellent idea! I used all milk chocolate. I found it easy to dip by holding a large spoon of chocolate and dipping the spoon into that to cover the bottom and then I spoon the rest of the chocolate over the top.

I made these for Christmas gift baskets, they were a smash hit. After dipping in the chocolate, I used white chocolate chips and dipped half the spoon in. This gave them a great look. Everyone loved them and are asking for more.

I held a holiday food craft party for a group of friends and these easy-to-make spoons were the hit of the party!  So easy, and so rewarding - I highly reccommend.  One tip: we lined the spoons on a baking pan layered with wax paper and after the first coat of chocolate, we put the pan in the freezer for 10 mintues.  This allowed the chocolate to become firm before adding another layer and gave our spoons a really nice look.

Thought this was a great idea, but when I made them, I put them in the fridge for 30 seconds, and I ended up with lots and lots of little tiny bubbles in them. They did not look good for gifts. I was very disappointed. But on a more possitive note, the kids loved them!

i used baking chocolate, because i feel that chocolate-chips don't melt well. i am now in middle of making them but i find that the back of the spoon looks a bit messed up. maybe i'll try what someone said here and do the back first... but they look nice in their cellophane wrapper!

These were so quick and easy! I made them for Valentine's Day and used white chocolate for the drizzle and made a heart shape on the spoon using a plastic baggie and #2 tip. I used clear plastic spoons. I did not refrigerate and they came out beautifully and hardened pretty quickly. I also added a little shortening to the chocolate when melting and only microwaved 30 seconds stirred and then 1 minute in the microwave. The chocolate wasn't completely melted but soft and I just stirred until smooth. I think 3 mins would burn the chocolate unless you have a very low wattage microwave. Excellent recipe and I loved the other reviews decorating tips for different holidays or occasions.

advice for young Mums (like an idiot I forgot this) keep the spoons out of reach of toddlers heh heh.. also clingflim on a chopping board, to let them set, and shoving them in the fridge or freezer for 5 minutes will quicken the setting time

I'm giving these with cocoa mix in a jar this Christmas, but I'm using real spoons. I picked some up at a thrift store for 20 cents each. Real spoons make a big difference!

I dipped my spoons in white and dark chocolate, then sprinkled with crushed Werther's to add a caramel flavor to the chocolate. So pretty, and such a nice hostess gift. A yummy little stir in for coffee or hot chocolate.

Used this for Valentine's teacher gifts!  We bought pink spoons from the party store & put them in heart print cello bags.  Was a big hit.

This worked out great. I rolled these in crushed candy canes right after dipping and they'd almost set. I had no issues with this recipe at all.

i always have bad luck microwaving things, so i opted for the double-boiling with this recipe.  i added a tablespoon of shortening for every cup of morsels i melted, like someone suggested, and the finish look was glossy.  however, after the fourth day, the chocolate "spots" started showing up.  so i suggest not making this days in advance like i did.  overall, i had a great time, but took almost forever (about 3.5 hours) to finish only 15 spoons.

This is a great recipe to get creative with.  For Christmas, I colored white chocolate with food coloring and added a couple of drops of peppermint flavoring.
Dipped some in the colored mint, then drizzled with melted chocolate and sprinkled with candy sprinkles.  With some, I dipped in chocolate, stuck miniature marshamallows on while still wet, then drizzed the marshmallows with the colored chocolate.  Wrapped in little cello bags and tied with curling ribbon, they are an impressive addition to gift baskets with a mug, some coffee, and homemade treats.

I like to dip chocolates at Christmas time.  I make chocolate spoons out of the leftover chocolate instead of letting it go to waste.

These are great to make for hostess gifts or to include in a gift basket for any occasion. I actually usually use a candy-making chocolate for these because it'll stay more glossy and you don't have to worry about it getting spotty or 'weird' looking, as I sometimes have that problem just using chocolate chips, but that's just my preference. Also, that way I can choose the quality of chocolate that I want to use. Same concept though, and a great idea! Also, like to either drizzle them w/ white chocolate or decorate them with sprinkles or small molded sugar decorations, just for a little more of a gourmet look. :)

I made these as Xmas gifts (the kids had painted mugs as their gifts), put them in purchased gift bags from the craft store--they were very well recieved.  I actually made them Xmas Eve and chilled them over night, then wrapped and ribboned them Xmas morning!  Recipe was perfect.

I use almond bark when making this; I dislike the way melted chips don't really drizzle unless put in a frosting bag or the baggie you made...and almond bark can be drizzled easily. Although, if you want to make specific designs, like shapes, on the spoon, that I would use the white chips for. It is a cute idea to gift in a mug with candy or cocoa mix.

These are so easy. I made them along with the cranberry hootycreek jar recipie and the cappucino mix. I crushed some mint candy canes and sprinkled the on top before the chocolate set. Very pretty and a nice gift! Thanks!

My grandson & I made these yesterday, we used ghirardelli double chocolate dipping chocolate to coat the spoons in & drizzled ghirardelli white chocolate on after the chocolate set up. I melted my chocolate (I too added a bit of shortening...about a tbp) in a double boiler because I have had chocolate seize up in the microwave & there's no need to hurry using a double boiler. We sprinkled some w/ colored sprinkles for the grands to use as lollipops. These spoons added a nice touch to our coffee this morning....thanks!

My 7 & 9 year old grandgirls made these for a tea party they gave for neighborhood children. It was easy to make and a great hit. We used mint chocolate to drip on the semi sweet. I also melt the chips slowly, microwaving for 30 seconds,stiring, & microwaving again until melted. I find otherwise I risk burning the chocolate.

I love the idea! I made these for our Mothers Day get together tomorrow with our family. I made these in my silicone candy molds so each one would stand up by itself. Wrapped them in individual candy bags. Love it.

These were so fun to make! I did what others suggested and let them dry at room temperature which only took about an hour. I made 3 kinds: crushed caramel, marshmallow, and white chocolate then wrapped them in plastic wrap, secured with a small rubber band and tied ribbon around them for looks.

These are great last minute, little nothing stocking stuffers!  I suggest you get everything measured, laid out, each layer of drizzle such as butterscotch, white, milk chocolate, crushed candy cane, ready to use before starting.  Dark chocolate needed a tiny bit of butter to smooth it out.  Microwave in 1 min then short bursts so it doesn't scorch.  Super easy!  Zip lock baggies make great piping/drizzle bags.

These make a great gift and are fun to keep on hand around the house! I made a few additions. I added some crushed up candy cane pieces and miniature marshmallows before setting in a fridge. I also drizzled some others with melted white chocolate.

Simple and a beautiful gift idea.  I used crushed Werther's, mini marshmallows, crushed peppermints, and Andes chips on my spoons.  Based on other reviews, I did not immediately refrigerate, but allowed the spoons to cool first.  This is also a great idea for a child to make...my 6-year-old help me both with dipping and sprinkling.

This was a great idea that i modified by making ginger spoon shaped biscuits and dipping them in chocolate. I use the original recipe when making some with the kids on the school break- FANTASTIC way to keep them occupied.
