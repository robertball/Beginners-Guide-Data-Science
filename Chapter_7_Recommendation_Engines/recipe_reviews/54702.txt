I debated on how to rate this recipe since it turned out delicious but if I had actually followed the recipe the results would not have been as appealing. I had 1 1/4 lbs of salmon and doubled the sauce recipe. It ended up being the perfect amount of sauce for two people. Can't imagine having 2 lbs and following the sauce recipe as written. I also added 1 tsp of fresh ginger since I can't image an Asian dish without that. Also the baking time really seemed off to me. 30 minutes is a long time to cook salmon- even a thicker filet. I checked mine after 15 minutes and they were done (and they were average sized filets). I did taste it at this point and it was good but not great and the fish was not very appetizing in appearance. So I followed the advice of another reviewer and removed the filets from the marinade and stuck them under the broiler on low for about 7 minutes. THey carmelized beautifully. I also condensed the sauce on the stovetop a little. Did do the dill rice(make sure to cover the rice when you lower to simmer temp) and served it on a platter with the salmon on top and a little sauce drizzled over it. Garnished with a fresh dill sprig. Looked and tasted wonderful. The broiling is a must! I think Grilled Salmon by Tina is still my favorite but we will definitely make this one again.

I am now CONVERTED!!!  I hate salmon - it's almost always dry and incredibly fishy... but for it's health benefits I'm trying to start eating it at least once a month.  After a long recipe search and much deliberation, I made this recipe last night. WOW WOW WOW - it is finger-licking good.  The sauce was amazing – so smooth and silky, gentle and flavorful. I doubled the sauce as many have suggested and I wish I tripled it; I also added about a tablespoon of fresh ginger and didn't add any olive oil; maybe next time I'll add a little cilantro as well. I marinated the fish for about an hour, but the marinade hasn’t had enough time to fully permeate the fish, next time I’ll try marinating for a longer period.  I baked the fish for about 30 minutes and it turned out moist and juicy and oh so delicious.  Can’t wait to entertain with it this weekend.  Thank you soooo very much LYNSEEY for converting me to a salmon eater. (I really wish I could give more then 5 stars - this recipe towers above all others.)

I wish i had looked at the previous reviews notes before makeing this, should have cut the oil in half and doubled the marinade. Had the potential to be great! smelled wonderful, but not much flavor. I will try again with the changes.

I made this recipe last night for my husband and in-laws. It was absolutely delicious. I followed the advice of several others. For starters, I doubled the marinade which is a "must" and added a dash of cornstarch to thicken the marinade at the end for pour back over salmon! I added ginger to the marinade- delicious. I baked for 15 minutes skinside down, then broiled skin side up for 5 or so minutes. It was perfect!  30 minutes is way too long to bake. I served the salmon over Whole Grain Brown Rice by Lundberg Jubilee(from Whole Foods). I also cooked a quick/delicious mixed vegetable dish (Fire Roasted Vegetables from Trader Joes) and placed the veggies on top of the rice and on sides of the salmon. I also decorated each plate with spinach leaves drizzled with olive oil and rice vinegar. The overall presentation looked quite tasty and the mixture of rice, veggies and salmon indeed tasted wonderful.  If you are cooking for four, I strongly recommend atleast 1 1/4 lb of salmon. I look forward to making this delicious dish again and it was a huge hit with the family. Enjoy!

this was a really good, quick and healthful marinade for salmon, would work great on swordfish.  Doubled the amounts for the marinade and cut the amount of oil in half, and used 1 1/2 lbs of salmon.  very good, will make again

All I can say is AWESOME!  My 8 year old daughter HATES (well let me say hated) salmon.  The evening I made this, she refused to try it.  We made her sit at the table until she had one bite.  She sat there for about an hour and a half.  FINALLY, she took a bite.  She loved it!  And it was cold!  She ate the whole filet.  I was shocked.  She told everyone the next day that here favorite food was salmon now.

THE BEST SALMON EVER! I loved this salmon so much I ate it a-top of jasmine rice w/ soy sauce for 5 days in a row!!! I was not much of a salmon girl before, but with a little revision of this recipe, my outlook on salmon has changed. I have a cute little blue notebook I keep all my recipes & I have decided to name this recipe: "The Salmon EVERYONE Liked". This title came about because I made this recipe for MYSELF, but my whole family came begging for a bite because it smelled so yummy, and they all liked it so much, that none of them made any  annoying suggestions for the next time I make it(which was a change, for once). This recipe is good for 12 ounces of salmon(2 servings)

Okay here's my revised recipe:
1 T EVOO
2 T Rice Vinegar
2 T LOW sodium SOY SAUCE
1/2 t sesame oil or toasted sesame oil(which I use)
1 T & 1 t brown sugar
2-3 cloves garlic
2 T white onion
1 T chopped green onions/chives
some grated ginger
pepper

I mix all the ingredients then pour over the salmon (keeping all the bits on top of the salmon). Refridgerate for about an hour. I cook in 350 oven about 10-15 minutes then pop in the broiler for about 5 minutes (If you like the charred/crispy taist leave in for 7).
I serves on top of a bowl of Trader Joe's Jasmine Rice. Then drizzle everything with soy sauce. YUM-O
I have made this for myself more than about 7 times in the past 2 weeks, so I think you can tell I like it A LOT! LOL

I followed this exactly...except for the fact that the salmon fillet we had didn't have skin on it.  Hubby loved it.  I thought it was really good too.  I will definately make again, but will probably let it cook under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to get the good carmelization that another reviewer suggested.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe is SO incredibly good and extremely easy to make!! An incredible gem, gives you a healthy meal you can make in minutes after a long day of work!! One twist that my mom put on this recipe which enhances the flavor a lot is she baked the salmon for about 15 minutes, then put it in the broiler for another 5-7 minutes. The sugar in the sauce caramelizes a bit and the onions get tons of flavor. YUMMY!!

Great recipe!  I substituted 1 and 1/2 packets of Splenda to keep it low carb.  Also instead of the rice, I served the Salmon on a bed of the oriental cabbage salad featured in the South Beach Diet.  The sauce was great over the cabbage. **Also don't over marinate I did that once and the Salmon absorbed all the sodium from the soy sauce and was salty.

I made this for Rob tonight and he LOVED it! I let the  fillet I had marinate for several hours and instead of cooking it in the oven, I heated up my cast iron grill pan and gave the salmon a good sear for four minutes on either side.  I brought the sauce to a boil in a separate pan and drizzled it over the fish once on the plate. I'm not a salmon person but I'll definitely be using this recipe the next time I buy myself some cod. Thank you Lynseey!!

Excellent recipe.  With three young children, I am always leery of something with too strong of an ethnic flavor, but they all LOVED this one.  My husband and myself loved it too.  We will definitely be making this again.

I've made this a couple of times now, and it is very tasty and super easy! I add ginger and make 1.5 times the sauce of the recipe. I made the rice the first time, and it was nothing special. The second time I served the salmon over Curried Quinoa from this site and it was wonderful. Definitely a keeper!

This was very good.  The only thing I changed was the ratio of the olive oil and sesame oil.  I put 2 tablespoons sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to enhance the flavor.  When I baked the salmon, I also added a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetable mix around the salmon.  It was a well balanced delicious and nutritious one-dish meal!

We loved this recipe!  Even my husband who doesn't like salmon ate every bit!  I halved the recipe, substituted white wine vinegar for rice wine vinegar and served it with brown rice tossed with sauteed onions.  I served lemon wedges on the side too.  This is a keeper!

Very good!  I reduced the cooking time to half and still found it a little too well done(but I also let the dish and salmon sit out for 10mins so prevent temperature shock on my dish!).  Salmon is best medium to medium rare- tender and moist!  Great flavour!

This is a good recipe.  We only had a few hours to marinade it.  If we had left it overnight, it would have been amazing.  I could get the flavor from the thinner pieces of salmon.  So note to self, let it marinade overnight or make the pieces thinner.  The marinade smells just like Hawaii!  This will make a great marinade for the Shoyu Chicken.

Love it. I agree with all the other reviews though: half the EVOO and double everything else. 

I cooked almost 2.5 lbs. of salmon and used 2.5 times as much on the marinade ingredients and it was barely enough. I also cooked the salmon for 20 minutes, drained the marinade and then broiled the salmon until ready. I am definitely making this again.

Rice: Brought the rice to a boil with butter, then added lemon juice and dill, shut off the heat and covered for 20 minutes. Delicious.

Very easy.  Very good.  Even my offspring who doesn't care for salmon very much, ate it without complaint.  Only sub I made was shallots for onions, as that's what I had.

very good after minor adjustments, omit olive oil, double sauce, extra garlic, add ginger and then it's perfect!!  You could even add a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce so that it would stay on the salmon better.

This is the best recipe I've found so far.  I did like the other reviews recommended, I used 1/2 the recommended oil, and I also quadrupled the entire marinade so I'd have plenty to let it soak in and still some left over to pour over when it was done.  I served it with wild rice and steamed zuccini, a wonderful combination!!

I prefer to do this dish with a tad more brown sugar. I wondered about the olive oil and sesame oil and thought it an odd mix, but the flavors really blended well in this dish. I always loved the combination of soy sauce and garlic, anyway.

This our family's favorite way to have salmon. It is so good. We do increase the soy sauce a bit by a tablespoon for our personal taste but it is just as good exactly by the recipe.

Made this yesterday. Can only give 4 stars due to changes. Cut down to two filets due to only two of us. Took other reviewers suggestion of one TBSP. EVOO and two TBSPS. Sesame oil. Also used brown rice but added two tsps. dried dill. Rest of recipe amounts used as listed. Came out great, but will have to cut down on the rice next time.

This was well worth going to the store to get all the ingredients.  My husband and I try to have fish every Friday and this was a new taste that we both think is a keeper.  Make twice the sauce.

I made the salmon only!  I only marinaded the fish for about a half hour & it was still delicious! Make sure the garlic pieces aren't resting on the salmon when it goes into the oven.  I bit into a piece of garlic after it was cooked and it ruined the flavor. Can't wait to make this again. Next time, I plan to add some mongolian fire oil for a kick!

This is an excellent, amazingly easy recipe! It took me only about 5 minutes to whip up the marinade, which I prepared as per the instructions but used just two salmon fillets (about 9 oz. total). I did reduce the olive oil to one tablespoon, though, based on other people's suggestions. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a simple yet delicious way to prepare salmon.

This is one of the best salmon recipes I have had! My whole family, which includes 2 small children, cleaned their plates. The only sub I made was using one minced shallot in place of the onion. It is what I had on hand. This was quick, easy and SO delicious! Thanks for sharing, Lynseey!

Excellent way to prepare salmon and really nice for having company over.  I made no changes and all 8 people raved about flavor and moistness of the filet.  Do not overcook salmon. 20 min-30 minutes at most, depending on thickness of filet and your oven.  These can be grilled as well.  Recommend you baste the fresh filet with EVOO then lightly salt and pepper.  Flip them onto grill with seasoned side down.  Season the other side.  Flip again and baste done side with marinade.  I like this marinated then baked so well, that I wouldn't go to the extra work to grill them losing the benefit of the pre-cooking marinade time.

I marinated for 2 hours with exact ingredients.  There was way too much oil, I wish I would have listened to the other reviewers.  I also think there needed to be some cornstarch in here to thicken it up.  It was done at 15 mins.  I put it in my broiler and it almost started to burn at 3 mins....it didn't seem to carmalize at all.  This has potential.

This one didn't dazzle me.  The flavors were fine, but it didn't have much of an Asian flavor to me. The overall taste was just... sweet, not much else.  I followed the directions but used a bit less olive oil, as per the suggestion of others.  I much preferred the recipe for Maple Salmon over this one, though perhaps I could alter this one for more of an actual Asian flavor (maybe add lots of ginger and sesame oil?).  Not bad, but not as good as I expected.

Excellent recipe, one of the better tasting Asian style salmon dishes on this site. I doubled the marinade but kept the oil measurements the same. I added ginger and I might reduce the vinegar just a touch next time. I baked my fish for 10 min at 350 deg, flipped and cooked for 5 min and broiled for 5 min. I then poured the remaining sauce from the pan into a skillet, added some cornstarch on high heat, 30 seconds letter i had a beautiful sauce to pour back on top of my salmon. yummmmmmmmy! served with just plain sushi rice since the flavors are so strong.

This was FANTASTIC - I was cooking for two so used just over 1lb of Salmon but used the prescribed amount of sauce ingredients at the suggestion of other reviewers.  Was hoping for a some leftovers but DH made them disappear.   Didn't have dill so served with basimati rice & steamed veges.

I followed the recipe, but reduced the cooking time to 15 minutes (and upped the temp in the oven to 400). It worked well with brown sweet rice (I added the dill weed as well). Thanks!

I've made this several times and followed the marinade recipe exactly as written.  The salmon is delicious, whether grilled or baked.  I've served it with rice, cous cous, or mashed potatoes and it goes well with all of them.

This is an excellent dish. I did add some fresh grated ginger and the juice of 1 lemon. The thick filets I had were perfectly cooked in 25 minutes. I made the dill rice, but it wasn't anything too special. I will use fresh dill next time. Add a fresh green vegie on the side and you have a quick and healthy meal. Will definitely make this again.

Just ok.  The only change I made was cutting the oil in half and I did marinade the salmon for 4 hours.  The flavor was good but nothing to write home about.  Delicious Salmon from this site was much better and not as fattening from all the oil.

I just made the salmon without the rice. I made a few changes. I left out the sesame oil bc I didn't have any and used garlic powder instead of minced garlic. I marinated it for about 30 minutes and then seared it in a cast iron grill-skillet and finished it in a 450 degree oven (about 10 minutes). It was very juicy and had an awesome flavor! Will definitely be making again!

good flavor. A little too oily. I would 1/2 the olive oil. I baked for only 15min. and broiled for only 2 minutes. Cooked to perfection! I might add a little bit of fresh grated ginger for a little more flavor.

This was amazing!!!  I had salmon long time ago that probably wasnt cooked right and i hated it.  I had not had it again  until now.  It was moist and not fishy at all and my  my 7 year old had 2 helpings.  The changes I made was I added a little more brown sugar and some extra garlic.  This recipe has made me a salmon lover

Best salmon i've ever made! I also added fresh ginger to the marinade, and subbed shallot for the onion. I used a spicy ginger teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. Next time I will double the sauce but cut the oil in half. I served this with basmati rice with saffron and napa slaw made with napa cabbage, rice wine vinegar heated with a little sugar, jalapenos, and ginger. I also added toasted sesame seeds on top of it all. So delicious, i will definitely make this again soon!

Restaurant quality.  Followed ingredients perfectly. Broiling at the end is a must.  Very, very delicious!  The longer it marinades, the better it tastes.  I baked it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes per inch thickness, but check every now and then to see if it's done.

I have made this many times and it never fails. My boyfriend loves this recipe, and the salmon turns out to be delicious every time. I don't usually marinade for 1-2 hours, I think that is too long for fish. I marinade for about 20 minutes, and broil at 350 F for 15 minutes in the middle of the oven, and for about 3-4 minutes right up on the very top of the oven in order to have some caramelizing happening. It's delicious! I really recommend.

This was very good, much better than I was expecting. After reading a few  reviews, I only used 1 lb of salmon, but kept the marinade the same (did cut the olive oil in half). Perfect amount of marinade and sauce for us. I really liked the rice with it's subtle notes of dill and my fiance raved about the salmon and sauce. Thanks, I'll make this again :)

I would have loved this, but it was overcooked. I did 15 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees and then broiled for 3-4 minutes to caramelize. I can't imagine doing to full 30 minutes in the oven. If I make this again, I'll probably do more like 5 minutes in the oven, 5 in the broiler. Also, I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the recipe while keeping the oil at a single portion level, added a bunch of grated fresh ginger (Tip: To make the ginger grate easier, freeze it. It will stay fresh that way, too.), and added a tiny bit more soy sauce and rice vinegar when I realized the sesame oil was still too strong a flavor for me.

Delicious. You can easily cut down on the olive oil though, as the sesame oil provides enough 'oiliness'. Also, try it with a simple side dish of leeks sauteed with ginger and - towards the end - sprinkled with orange peel and some OJ. If you liked this recipe, try also Grilled Salmon with Ginger-Orange Glaze.

This recipe was awesome!  Very Easy to make.  Sauce was excellent.  The salmon was so moist it just melted in your mouth.  Next time I am going to double maybe even triple the sauce as others have suggested.  I will have to make more salmon next time....everybody wanted more. It just disappeared down to the last grain of rice!  Recommend you definitley try this one.

Let me first state that my husband and I do not like salmon. We really detest it HOWEVER in an interest to be healthy etc. and the high rating this recipe received, I decided to prepare it. My husband wasn't too thrilled with my dinner choice BUT when this was said and done, it was FABULOUS! I used Minute Rice and added additional dried dill. Also, I doubled the sauce and it still didn't make enough to spoon over more than two pieces of salmon. The marinade masked all of that salmon taste that we cannot handle. He ended up scraping his plate. Served with a sugar snap pea recipe from this site. Excellent meal. I wouldn't hesitate to serve this once again.

Marinade gave salmon a very good flavor throughout. I used 1/2 the amount of oil called for, and it worked fine. This recipe is on the "sweeter" side of asian, as opposed to a spicy or rich flavor. Works well with orange sesame bok choy on the side.

I really liked this and you can adjust the brown sugar to taste ... made exactly as recipe listed except didn't allow to marinade, Whipped it up and straight into the oven and served with the "yummy Bok choy salad" from this site with a little bit of left over rice.

I made this recipe pretty much as is. Except I seared the salmon on both sides in a pan then transferred to a baking dish. This was soo good, I've already shared the recipe with family.

I didn't have onions, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  After the marinade was all mixed It did seem a little bland so as other users suggested I added 1 Tbsp fresh grated ginger.  I also took the advice of others and baked for 15 min. and then broiled for 5 min.  I marinated my salmon for 1 hour and with the above changes it was almost the best salmon I've ever had!  I gave this 4 stars because of what it would be without the changes, with the changes its definatly 5 stars!  I will be making this again and again :) PS: I made "Sesame noodles" from this site to go with the salmon and it was matched perfectly!

Really liked this & have continued to use the recipe. Nice & light flavor. Sometimes my mouth ends up too dry after eating asian food, but not with this meal. Goes very nicely with a vegetable saute. I keep this recipe in mind when I'm trying to have a healthy dinner. Thank for putting this out there!

Wow! Like others who have reviewed this recipe, I too was not a salmon fan. I had a filet left in my freezer from an eariler attempt at making myself enjoy salmon, so I figured I'd give this recipe a shot. WOW! Fantastic! As other reviewers suggested, I cut the cooking time down to 15 minutes, and broiled it for a couple minutes. I only made one salmon filet (for my self), but made the marinade for 4 servings because I wanted to mask the fishy salmon flavor as much as I could. The marinade actually made me like the flavor of the salmon! It complimented it PERFECTLY! I did make a few changes that I would definitely suggest - I followed the marinade recipe to a T, but added 1/2 tsp garlic chili sauce for some heat (wonderful!), and 1/4 tsp ginger. I also added about 1/2 tsp extra brown sugar, and even sprinkled a bit extra brown sugar over the salmon right before I broiled it...It carmelized perfectly!

Also, instead of using rice I used a quinoa blend from Trader Joe's, cooked it with chicken stock and a smashed clove of garlic (which I removed before eating) instead of the water/bullion. I can't wait to get some more salmon to make this again!!

Very good!  My daughter hates salmon and she rated it edible.  haha  That's a rave review.  I really, really liked it, though, and so did my husband.  I found that the onions were a little more raw than I would have liked when I served it so next time I will saute them in just a touch of oil before adding them to the marinade.  I think that's the only change I would make!

I doubled the marinade amount and reduceed what was left as a sauce to pour over the salmon. Also put under the broiler for about 5 minutes to get brown.  Very good and easy to throw together.

Excellent Recipe.  I have made this numerous times and my husband always loves it!  I make it with plain or jasmine rice rather than dill and I double the marinade/sauce to fish ratio.  Otherwise exactly as called for!

I thought this was ok. I expected more flavor from marinating it for a couple of hours. I would make this again if it was a last minute thing because the ingredients are things I usually have on hand.

Very good! I can really only give it 4 stars because I tweaked  it a bit- doubled the sauce except for the sesame oil, which I left as is, and the olive oil which I omitted entirely. Fish is already oily and I dislike the feel and taste of oily foods. I also added ground ginger. Yummy! Didn't have dill weed so I made it with wild rice and asparagus. My friends loved it! Next time I might add some cornstarch for a thicker sauce.

Ok. so as I prepared it, WOW!  My husband hates salmon and he couldn't get enough.  Did make some changes however so can't rate a 5 star.  Just got back from a 3 night business trip in Madison, prepped the fish with the marinade (had to sub onion powder for onions) and proceeded to the couch with a cocktail.  Realized that I was so tired from my trip, I wasn't up to cooking so I let it marinade over 24 hrs due to sheer exhaustion!  Figured I probably ruined it, but wth, threw it on the grille the next evening...the best salmon I've ever had!!!  I will always marinade this over night.  It was so good I couldn't wait to use the leftovers for sushi, problem was, I couldn't stop nibbling the rest of the evening.  No sushi this time :(

I really wanted to like this.  It smelled great when I was mixing up the marinade and even better when it was cooking, but it tasted like oily vinegar.  At first, I couldn't decide if I liked it or not.  I really, really wanted to but in the end both DH and I had to set it aside and I whipped up some beans and cheese.  Maybe if you were to cut back on the rice vinegar?  I'm not entirely sure.  Also, I cooked it at 400 for 10 min and that was perfect.

I halved the recipe because I had 16 ounces of frozen salmon fillets (pre-packaged, vacuum sealed).   This turned out great!  I didn't marinate at all.  I just took the frozen fillets out of their packaging and then poured the sauce on top (I left out the sesame oil - saving a few calories).   I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes covered with foil and then 15 minutes uncovered - they were perfect.   Served with Spicy Bok Choy in Garlic Sauce from this site.  It turned into a great meal.  Thanks for helping me make a quick and delicious dinner with what I had on hand.

I love this recipe. It is easy to prepare and so delicious. I substituted the 2 tbsp of onion for green onions instead and added some fresh grated ginger to the marinade I also cut back on the oil. Definitely double the sauce though. Great recipe!

Oh my goodness!!  This was phenomenal.  My son had told me that he didn't like salmon and he was going to have a frozen pot pie instead.  Then, as he watched me putting the marinade together he became intrigued since he loves Asian food.  He loved it and ended up literally licking the plate.  The whole family loved this and I have put it in my "favorites" category so I won't forget about it.  I did follow the suggestions about doubling the marinade and baking for 20 minutes and then broiling to finish it off for about 5 minutes.  I made the dill rice using brown rice "Texmati" brand Basmati rice.  I also purchased a nice sized piece of wild salmon from Costco that worked beautifully. Thank you SO much for this wonderful recipe.

YUM!!! I served this for a little get-together last night and it was a HUGE hit. The flavor is mouth-watering but not overpowering and the marinade keeps the fish so moist. I did double the marinade recipe and wish I had tripled it - You really would need to triple it to have enough to really flavor-ize the rice. I also added ginger, per others' suggestion, and increased the amouont of garlic. Instead of long grain rice I used baby basmati rice which was sooooo delicate and tender and tasted awesome. Lastly, I ended up having more people over than I expected and didn't have enough salmon. So I put a bunch of glaze over tilapia filets and served the two fishes side by side. They were both AWESOME.

I'm trying to eat more salmon and this recipe has been a highlight of the many I've recently tried. I used a wild B.C. Sockey salmon, which tends to be very flavourful. I'm not a big fan of fish in general and only eat it because it's healthy, but this recipe made the salmon extremely tasty without masking the salmon's tastse altogether. I served it with rice mixed with a few splashes of sesame oil and some freshly-toasted sesames, and with ponzu sauce served on the side to dip the salmon in. (I could just drink ponzu sauce on its own, I love it that much! It's a Japanese, "citrus seasoned soy sauce & dressing," according to the Kikkoman bottle. A great mix of salty, tangy and sweet -- really nice with everything.) Oh, and I added a tablespoon of prepared mashed ginger.

I have made this 3 times already and it's the *only* way I'll make salmon now - at my husband's request!  We like to  individually wrap them in foil, it comes out more moist that way (with doubled the sauce, of course).  AND adding fresh minced ginger gives it that full asian flavor!  So delicious!

This was wonderful. I got a huge 2 lb. slab of salmon and cut it into 4 parts. Next time I am going to triple the sauce and not use the dill (just my preference).  I'm definitely making this again!

This was a very good dish.  I cooked the salmon on a George Foreman grilling machine for about 7 minutes and prepared the rice in a rice cooker with added olive oil and butter.  The flavor was light and delicate.

This was quite good, and only made a couple of changes: added about 1/4 cup of orange juice (contributed a nice citrusy note) and used onion powder inst. of onions in deference to my onion-chunk hating kids! Made the marinade in a gallon zip-lock bag and was only able to marinate about an hour -- extra time would have really let the excellent marinade soak in. Put in an oval baking dish lined w/non-stick foil to make clean-up easier. I wish I would have taken the trouble of taking the skin off the other side of my salmon fillet -- would have reduced the "yuck" factor when serving. Also, next time will cook in a larger dish to allow the marinade to cook down a bit, thickening it and intensifying the flavor. Didn't need to double the recipe, since I used about half the amount of fish called for. Also, used just plain steamed rice, inst. of the dilled rice. Baked salmon for exactly 30 mins and was perfect for my medium thickness fillet. All in all, this was a great marinade -- the kids had seconds (they LOVE salmon in any preparation!) and my husband kept commenting on how moist the salmon was.

OH MY GOD! This Asian Salmon was incredible! My husband does not like salmon at all but loves asian flavors. Soooo, I thought, if I make this, maybe I can get him to like Salmon which is so healthy. Well, after making it tonight, he devoured it and begged me to make it again in the future!

I used 1 pound of Atlantic Farmed Salmon instead of 2 pounds (it's just us two), but used the full marinade/sauce recipe for it. I marinated it for 2 hours. After baking it, it made barely enough sauce for us, but then we don't like too much sauce anyways.

I made jasmine rice (1 cup raw rice with 1 tsp. dried dill, 1 Tbsp. butter and 2 cups water, not following the recipe ... that's double the amount of dill specified). At first, hubby was NOT happy about the dilled rice, but then confessed how good it was with the salmon, and how it complimented it! I also served it with steamed asparagus. Definitely a keeper for us!

Awesome recipe.  I marinated my salmon all day and the flavors throughly penetrated the fish.  Love it when my salmon doesn't come out too fishy tasting and this was a terrific marinade.  Served this with rice and green beans.  Very good!

This was an excellent marinade/sauce for salmon!  I cooked only one pound salmon but used the full recipe for the marinade and it was perfect (so I do reccomend doubling if using 2lbs of salmon).  The leftover marinade was sooooooo delicious spooned over rice!  I will be making this one again, and again, and again...

This was delicious!  I only had time to marinade for 30 mins.  I followed the recipe (which is very unusual for me) except for doubling the sauce. Also, I broiled the salmon for the last 5 mins to give it a nice golden color.

I really like this way of preparing salmon.  The sauce is excellent and it goes great with rice.  I omitted the dill because I made extra rice for other purposes, but it wasn't missed.  My only complaint is that the suggested portion is huge.  I ate half a portion and my partner only ate one, he usually has seconds or thirds.  I might suggest serving half servings and having seconds if you're not full.

THIS IS TRULY A GOURMET RECIPE THAT IS QUICK AND
EAZY. I DID FOLLOW THE ADVISE OF OTHERS AND MADE DOUBLE THE SAUCE, NEXT TIME I WILL TRIPLE IT. I SERVED WITH WILD RICE AND A BROCCOLI CASSEROLE. MY
HUSBAND LOVED IT AND I WILL MAKE THIS FOR COMPANY.
I WOULD EXPECT TO FIND A RECIPE LIKE THIS ONE IN
EXCLUSIVE DINING ESTABLISHMENTS. WONDERFUL. THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE.

This salmon was so delicious and easy, that I'll probably make it a couple of times a month! My husband even raved about it, and he is not a fish fan. It is a good idea to double the sauce, though because it is so good, you will want more! This recipe is a winner!!!

I used a whole 21/2 pound salmon. Salmon came out very tasty. I was a little disappointed in the rice however. I expected more dill flavour. If you are going to spoon the sauce on the salmon when you serve it, then double the recipe for the marinade.

Delicious, with recipe modifications.  The marinade deserves 5 stars for sure, but must be doubled and fresh or ground ginger added is great.  The instructions for cooking are way off!  30 minutes is far too long in the oven.  My fillets were cooked for 14 minutes then broiled for 2 minutes.  That's it, and they were done, almost slightly over done at that.  I also recommend a longer marinating time.

The cooking time has got to be wrong. My salmon as way over cooked. I followed one recommendation of baking for 15 min and broiling for 7 and still over cooked :(.

Very delicious! I do agree with others that the sauce should be doubled and baking time shortened. I will definitely be making this one again and again! Also goes great with jasmine coconut rice.

This was delicious and super easy. I doubled the sauce and it was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was one of the best salmon recipes I've ever tried.  I implemented a few of the changes other reviewers recommended.  I doubled the sauce, and next time I'll triple it.  also, i baked for about 17 minutes and then broiled for five.  I also served it over whole wheat orzo, because that's what i had on hand.  I know that sounds like a lot of changes to still give a recipe 5 stars, but the bones of the recipe remain the same.  the marinade is awesome and the salmon comes out moist and flavorful.

This Salmon is excellent...I have been making it for years.  I do substitute onion powder for the minced onion.  I also make 1 and 1/2 of the amount of sauce...we need extra for spooning over the rice!!  Sauce could easily be doubled.

This is probably one of the best salmon recipes I have tried. I only made a couple of modifications but it was still delicious. I left out the onions, as I didn't have any, and sprinkled cayenne pepper on top for a little more spice. I did not serve it over the rice but it fine by itself.

Added shallot instead of the onion and left out the dill.  I didn't bother with the olive oil since salmon naturally renders out a lot of fat.  The recipe was AWESOOOOOME!  My boyfriend doesn't like salmon and he ate this up!  I served it along side some brown rice and steamed edamame. It was even better the next day.  Great recipe.

I made the recipe with no variation but next time I will reduce the brown sugar to 1 1/2 tsp. as I thought it was too sweet.  I will also use less oil.  Otherwise the ingredients were perfect for my 1 1/2 lb. salmon filet.  The salmon was marinated for 2 1/2 hrs. and baked for 20 minutes.  I thought it came out of the oven looking beautifully, nice and golden, the marinating sauce glaze was golden and bubbly.  I was very moist and flavorful.  Since, I have shared the recipe with several friends and they love it.  All of us think it is a keeper.

Cooked this yesterday, and it really was amazing. Changes to my version: Doubled the ingredients except the onion. did not put olive oil, since salmon is a very oily fish and any oil usually makes it distasteful. Added same amount of fresh ginger as garlic. Cooked for 20, broiled for 10 min in the sauce. Broiling gave off a burnt smell due to the finely chopped onion and i was worried it would burn but it didnt. Maybe next time I will leave chunks of onion in the marinade and remove them during cooking the sauce was not thick bot we dipped bread in it and just licked our fingers!

Excellent Salmon!!  I didn't realize untill I was making it that we were out of sesame oil and it still tasted great!   I did double the sauce and half the oil like many others recommended and it was awesome!  Thanks!

I made it on a 3 pound skinless fillet and it was fantastic. I followed the other reviews in terms of being generous with the amount of the marinade. My other changes were based on what was available in the cupboard: apple vinegar for rice vinegar, no sesame oil, add cumin and cinnamon.

I also halved the amount of salmon in this recipe, but kept the sauce amount the same.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and broiled the fish for the last few minutes.  The end result was quite good - my husband liked it better than I did though.  The rice was nothing fantastic - although we may need to replace our dill.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but I was disappointed! It was very plain to me - I've had better sauces on it that include ginger. It did not cover the fishy taste well and I marinaded it for an hour. Granted, I did not have the rice vinegar - I used other vinegar instead. I would have used fresh dill instead, added some lemon perhaps or lime and ginger. I would probably only used the Sesame oil.  I will have to search for another good salmon recipe - I love the salmon cakes with the potato - yummy.

We really enjoyed this, it turned out perfectly. I used wild sockeye salmon, previously frozen and thawed overnight in the fridge from Trader Joe's. Their wild fish never fails to please. Next time I think I will try omitting the olive oil and doubling the or leaving the sesame oil just to cut back on calories some. I also used an unrefined Muscovado sugar from Whole Foods. We had this over http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Wasabi-Mashed-Potatoes/Detail.aspx instead of the rice and the side veg. I chose was steamed radishes with steamed onions. The marinade from the fish made a great "sauce" for everything.

Absolutely great if you're shorthanded on spices. This fit the bill, but I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor. Rather than a marinade, I threw a teaspoon of garlic over each piece of salmon and baked it in the sauce. Absolutely wonderful.

Made a side of salmon taste like hot dogs.  We didn't like it at all.  In the future, I won't waste perfectly good salmon by covering it with so much stuff that it tastes like something else.

Good, but nothing special. The flavor was a bit bland...I think the proportion of marinade to salmon needs to be increased.  Also, I think the flavor needs a little adjustment.

Wonderful!  I make a lot of different salmon recipes and I think this one is definitely in my top five!  Like other reviewers suggested, I doubled the sauce and added a Tbsp. of fresh grated ginger.  I also used brown rice, which I steamed in the oven with the dill weed.  I love the rice, such a delicate flavor which complitments the salmon beautifully.  Highly recommend!

Very tasty.  I made the marinade as written except only made 1 pound of salmon (skinless) & I added 1 T fresh grated ginger.  I baked it for 15 min & then broiled it for 5 min, flipped it & broiled another 3-4 min. It was wonderful!

This recipe just wasn't for me.  I used Sockeye Salmon, and would have preferred to stick to my old standby.  I have tried many versions of Asian Salmon, and just don't like the flavor.

However, I cam giving this recipe four stars because it does turn out quite well.

I didn't add ginger but would next time.  I also broiled the fish towards the end and boiled down the marinade to thicken slightly.

For those that feel the fish doesn't soak up enough flavor, marinade it flesh down - not skin down, so the marinade permeates the flesh.  Then flip it before cooking.

This salmon is fantastic!! The dill weed added extra flair to the rice. I will definitely make this dish again. A note to first time cookers: I would make some extra marinade and heat it up in a pot before serving to drizzle over the fish & rice. The marinade tends to thin out in the dish while cooking. So if you want a little extra, make a little extra! ;)

I've made this recipe several times, always successfully. Two tweaks: I use Tamari soy sauce, on the recommendation of a good friend, and it adds a deeper soy flavor. Also, I substitute minced ginger for the onion. I usually bake it, but sometimes grill it, with equally good results. This is a great, easy recipe!

In all honesty, I never cared for salmon at all, it always came out bland when it was cooked for me. My wife loves salmon.I decided to go ahead and put my tastes aside and make her a salmon dish. This was fantastic !! I didn't change the recipe at all except for sprinkling the dill weed on top of the fish before placeing in the oven instead of afterwards. I have changed my mind about this fish after tasteing the asian recipe. I cook all the dinner meals at home since I am disabled. This definately goes in my recipe binder.

Excellent! My husband loved it as well. I only used one pound of salmon but followed the measurements for the rest and it came out perfect. Also, I substituted apple cider vinnegar because I was out of rice vinnegar. For the rice, I added dill to my usual rice recipe which includes a quarter tsp of soy sauce, olive oil, and a tsp of cinnamon. I really enjoyed this. It's definately going in my recipe box, I'll definately make it again.

This was very good, but I am beginning to wonder whether marinating salmon is the best way to prepare it.  It seems that no matter how long it sits in the marinade, it does not absorb the flavors the way other meats do. At any rate, this cooked perfectly in the prescribed time, but I would recommend cutting the olive oil in half as the marinade seemed a touch oily.

The flavor of the sauce was good but the amount stated in the recipe is not enough. I used a little over a pound of salmon but kept the sauce measurements the same. It was just barely enough sauce to "pour" over my rice. It was more like a "drizzle". I didn't have any rice vinegar so I used rice wine instead and it worked out fine. At the advice of another reviewer, I only used half the amount of olive oil called for. My sister thought that the sauce was a little too sweet so maybe next time I'll reduce the brown sugar a bit. I really liked the simplicity of this recipe. I served this with white rice and carrots.

My boyfriend RAVED about this dish!  I'm a vegetarian, so I was a bit nervous making something I couldn't sample, but he loved it.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the marinade, added ginger and took it out early to put under the broiler for a bit.  He liked it so much he wants me to make it for his family.

Made it for a non-salmon eater who loved it!  I wasn't as impressed with the sauce as most people seem to have been, but it was mostly my personal preferences I believe.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My boyfriend and I love salmon and we loved this recipe. I added a tablespoon of minced ginger, and though I only used a pound of salmon, I made the whole amount of sauce, which seemed like just the right amount.  It was fantastic.

I absolutely love it.  It's so simple. I used fresh onion instead of dried.  I liked it for the texture. I wish I did make extra sauce.  Overall I think it made for a light flavor that doesn't overpower the salmon.  I made it for a potluck meeting and it disappeared fast.  I think the small left over portion was courtesy as being the host.

I haven't ordered salmon in a restaurant since I discovered this marinade! I think I would be disappointed since I can make something so good (and so easily) at home. I half the amount of salmon but leave the amount of marinade alone. We pour the marinade over top of the rice after cooking. It does not make great leftovers, but is delicious the night of. I have passed this recipe on to several people.

Thumbs up from my non-fish eating husband!  I took others advice and cut the oil in half.  I also added ground ginger and sesame seeds that I had on hand and it added a nice punch.  Next time, I will double the marinade - the best part.

This was easy, heart-healthy, and fantastic.  I only baked the salmon for 10 minutes per inch, though, instead of the 20 minutes stated and didn't make the rice.  My kids loved it!

Wonderful flavor...I wrapped the salmon along with the marinade in a foil packet before baking and it came out nice and moist.  I left the dill out of the rice and served it over plain rice with the sauce.  I also added a little fresh ginger to the marinade.

It was excellent!  My boyfriend and I loved it.  We changed the recipe slightly though....We replaced brown sugar with Splenda, and we didn't have dill weed nor rice vinegar at the time, so we used thyme and red wine vinegar instead. Plus we added 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon, ground aniseed, ground ginger. But it still turned out wonderfully.  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

I have made this several times, as it is one of our favorite meals now.  I always double the marinade, except for the oils, and use extra to pour over steamed chinese veggies and rice.  Even made this with chicken once when we didn't have salmon, and it was just as delicious.

Excellent!!  I have made this salmon over 5 times and it is perfect each time.  The aroma from the marinade makes your mouth water!  I buy the big slabs of salmon from Costco and marintate it in a ziplock bag over night so the marinade is soaked in good!  I also double or triple the marinade based on how much salmon I have.

Enjoy!

12.23.03 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/54702/asian-salmon/ ... EXCELLENT!  As the other reviews said, double the marinade ingredients except for the olive oil.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect! Note4Me: Correct (less oil) version for 1# salmon:
1T each: olive oil, brown sugar, sesame oil;
2T each: rice vinegar, soy sauce, minced onion;
2 cloves minced garlic, pinch black pepper.
I didn't like the rice. Not Asian, but can't open salmon folder to add: http://www.grouprecipes.com/141104/salmon-with-avocado-lime-salsa.html ... DIZ liked.

This recipe was so good, but I suggest marinating it a little longer.  Also - to add more flavor, I melted some orange marmalade (jelly) on the stove until it was a clear, syrupy consistency. Half-way through baking the salmon I poured the jelly over the salmon (it formed a glaze).  IT WAS DELICIOUS and my 11 year old loved it also!!

Wow! ...Did I mention Wow? This is a wonderfully tasty way to prepare this wonderful fish. Like others, I prepared it with 2X the sauce and used the xtra sauce as dressing for bagged coleslaw the next day. Served with the asparagus and cashew rice recipe instead to get all the food groups involved. Again, wow! :o)

This was easy and delicious.  I doubled the marinade and added fresh ginger and a couple tablespoons of peanut oil.  I also used honey instead of brown sugar.  I marinated overnight, and before I stuck it in the oven I quartered some mushrooms and added them alongside the salmon, making sure that they got coated with the marinade.  The mushrooms made a great side dish in one easy step!

I just finished making this recipe, and it tastes just as good as it smells...wonderful.  It actually looks like something you would order from an expensive restaurant....my husband can't thank me enough.  (he's a salmon lover!)  I actually don't like salmon at all, but this recipe had a distinctive Asian flavor, and was not at all "fishy" tasting.  I served it Lipton Thai sesame noodles (and used sesame oil in that as well.  I will be making this one again!!!!!

What a tasty recipe!  My boyfriend kept asking me what smelled so good while the salmon was cooking.  I marinated the salmon for a little over one hour - -  next time I might try longer just to make the flavor more intense.  I baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes and the fish turned out perfect.  (Tip: line your pan with foil to make clean-up easier!)

This recipe definitely rated a 5-star in our house.  The sauce compliments the fish without being overpowering.  The dill rice is a nice touch as well.  I always make my rice using chicken broth with a touch of dry sherry.  I also served with steamed sugar snap peas - great weeknight dinner.

I love salmon, so I usually prepare it quite simply. I haven't liked any recipes that gussy it up just to cover the taste. This recipe does have strong flavor, but it's delicious and complimentary to the fish. I don't use refined sugars, so I substituted pure grade B maple syrup and molasses (1T./ea because I doubled the sauce except the oils like others). Great flavour!! Also used Braggs aminos instead of soy sauce for less sodium. Worked great. I will make this for friends.

Yes. This is Asian deliciousness. I carelessly used two WHOLE onions instead of two teaspoon, but it turned out great.  For someone in the previous review who said that it was not visualy appealing, I suggest you use Asian style rice bowl (or simple deep soup bowl if you do not have them) to serve this recipe.

This was awesome!  Not too sweet, but lots of flavor.  I tripled the sauce (except the olive oil) and cooked the fish in a deep pan with it.  Fabulous.

Excellent recipe! I put a bed of spring greens on the plates,  piled rice on top & salmon on top of rice, then drizzled sauce over it & garnished with chow mein noodles. I used half the salmon and still tripled the marinade. I also replaced half the sesame oil with fish sauce because I'm not crazy about a heavy sesame oil tastes. Makes a great salad dressing & is good on chicken as well!

I made this for dinner tonight along with easy bok choi from all recipes too. I highly recommend NOT cooking the salmon for 30 mins or it will be too tough and not very good. I find salmon cooks perfectly at about 12 mins. You want it to melt a little in your mouth when you eat it, and it should flake nicely in chunks instead of fluffing off into tiny bits (unless you enjoy over done salmon which my hubby does lol). The asian flavors are nice and it goes well with the simple bok choi, also an asian veggie

Five stars for taste, but because of the cooking directions I knocked my rating down a notch.  Like the top reviewer, my filets were on the thick side , but I was very wary of a 30 minute cook time.  Mine were definitely done after 15 minutes.  As I wanted to pop them under the broiler for another 5 minutes or so, they probably could have done with even a few minutes less baking time.  I had only one pound of salmon, but made the full amount of marinade.  I used a mixed rice and grain blend and decided to forego the dill.  Very nice recipe, just watch the cooking time.

We are not salmon eaters, but with this recipe we are now.  I followed other reviews and doubled the marinade.  While salmon was grilling I slowly reduced it in a saucepan until thick and poured it over the fillets.  After the salmon soaked in marinade for an hour, then to have a delicious thick sauce poured over, it was delicious. Hardly tasted fishy at all.  The marinade/sauce was so good I plan to also try it on other things like grilled chicken wings.

Great recipe, thank you!  No changes necessary, but the second time I added fresh ground ginger of course, and it was even better.   You can totally do this on the grill, no need to heat that oven in the summer - 4 min each side on med/hi heat, lid open even, and they are cooked to medium.   Note to other reviewers:  you can marinate fish but yes you need to keep an eye on it.  Citrus and Vinegar "cook" the fish (ie ceviche) but the less citrus and vinegar, the less cooking you'll do and the longer you can get away with marinating it.  And remember, if you reuse your marinade as a sauce you MUST boil it thoroughly because it contains raw fish juices.

I just had this tonight and I loved it. But I did not cook it in the oven. I pan fried it and the glaze that it made was wonderful which others did by broiling it.

Four stars for the seasoning, but I would give only 3 for the method of preparation (2 lbs of salmon shouldn't need 30 min).  I'm glad I followed other reviewers' suggestion of cutting the baking time to 15 min, but I didn't do the finishing broil, since after 15 min the salmon was done - real close to too done.  Next time I will do 10 min in the oven and then maybe 5 under the broiler, since that seems like a good idea.  I also increased the sauce measure to almost double, and that was a good thing to do.  Over all was well received and I will make it again.

Like other reviewers, I thought it was a little bland.  If I make this recipe again, I'll definitely add something to kick it up a notch.  I marinated for 3 hours and doubled the garlic.   Broiling the salmon was a nice touch.  Definitely double the sauce and half of the oil!

Delicious and very easy to make! I sautéed this and didn't have any brown sugar on hand, but I did have some dark molasses, so I used that instead (about 1 tablespoon)...it added a rich, smoky flavor that complimented the other ingredients quite well. Omitted the ginger, as I didn't have any of that either. Then, added the marinade in the pan after searing the skin side and had a nice sauce come out of it. Served with steamed spinach and Yukon gold potatoes!

We enjoyed this recipe.I didn't have sesame oil, but didn't think it mattered as the olive oil was enough. I sprinkled some sesame seeds in marinade and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. Love how the glaze caramelized onto the fish while baking, just positioned the salmon twice during baking to ensure maximum placement of glaze. Removed from the oven, peeled off the top fish skin and any dark salmon went to kitty cat. Flipped onto serving plate and had a few scallions so sliced them as garnish. Also made it using a bit of ginger ( "fresh" from a tube), personal preference as it doesn't have to have it.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved the flavors, but as so many others have done, I doubled the marinade (used Low Sodium soy sauce, too.) And as others have done, I made it on our grill -- Medium heat, 9 minutes skin side down, then turn and grill for 3 minutes. I reserved the marinade, and boiled it on the stove for a minute or two to caramelize. For the rice, I kicked it up a bit by sweating 1/4 cup minced onions in 1 T unsalted butter, added some freshly ground pepper & sea salt, replaced the water with good quality chicken broth and of course added the dill. This recipe will now be in our rotation -- company worthy, too!

I liked the flavors but it needed a lot of tweeking.  Really glad I read the other reviews because I did halve the oil and changed the black pepper to chili pepper and added about a teaspoon of ginger.  The big debate regarding the cooking time could have been avoided if the original recipe would have said how big the pieces of salmon should have been.  Next time I will cut them into serving size pieces and crank up the oven to 400 deg.  For a 1 1/2 inch thickness, 15 min. should be perfect.  I would also triple the marinade, use 2/3 and reserve 1/3 to heat and add to the cooking sauce.  It was a little salty for me but eating it with white rice helped with that problem.  I can't even imagine using dill flavored rice with this salmon recipe.

This is really good!  I added some fresh ginger and omitted the onions and olive oil.  I felt there was plenty marinade, no need to double as mentioned in several reviews.   Served with the dill rice and garlic green beans!  This is a new favorite at our house.

I agree with others who did double everything but the oil in the marinade and baked at 350, skin side up, for 15, and then broiled skin side down 5-10 min. It was delicious that way. If those were the instructions, I'd give this 5stars. I wouldn't recommend following the instructions as is.

The salmon was good, but the marinade only seemed to be enough for a bit over a pound of salmon.  To get the crispy skin on the salmon, I pan-fried it rather than baking it.  I'm not sure what the point of leaving the skin on is if it's not going to be pan-fried.

Good, seems lighter with no sugar or maple syrup.  Maybe more soy sauce next time for flavor

I hooked it with some minced ginger and used fish sauce for the salt.  It is bathing in the marinade now and 
I will cook it tonight.
I made it before and decided to be creative with the ginger and fish sauce.
Whatever reaction I get from the Mr. will be the selling point.

I thought this was interesting mix of flavors. I actually marinated the fish linger than the recipe required on accident, but the longer the better!Only change I made was baking the salmon at 375 in the oven for 20 mins.

This recipe is simple and delicious. It is also fairly cheap as i had most of what i needed already. I recommend buying the fish fresh and not frozen. Frozen fish tends to be dry and well not fresh. I used one fillet and doubled the sauce ingredients but kept the onion and garlic the same. Best fish dish i have ever made.

I used steelhead instead of salmon and grilled instead of baked.  Honestly, if grilling is an option for this marinade then don't consider anything else.

Awesome!!! I don't typically care for salmon but wanted to try out this recipe. The only changes I made was to double the sauce and bake it 15 minutes skin side down and broil it for 5 minutes skin side up. I also omitted the sesame oil because I didn't have any and I wasn't about to pay $10 for it. I added corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit.

This is our go to recipe for salmon.  My kiddos love it.  Alterations include cooking it a little more slowly- 300 degrees until the internal temp is 125, and doubling the sauce.  The lower cooking temp and not letting the internal temp get above 140 prevents the 'white stuff' from coming out of the salmon.  The family loves to pour the sauce over the rice so more is always needed.

The marinade was delicious and the dill rice complemented it perfectly! The only thing I would do differently next time would be to either broil or grill it, instead of baking. Baking cooked it too thoroughly and didn't caramelize the marinade at all like broiling/grilling does. I served with fresh corn on the cob.

Wow. I was skeptical, but this was awesome with a few adjustments to the marinade and cooking method. I made this amount of marinade for 1lb. of salmon, not two, and it was perfect. If you make 2lbs. of fish be sure to double the amount of marinade. I highly recommend cutting the amount of olive oil in half and adding a bit of grated ginger as well as siracha. As others have suggested, bake at 350 for 15 mins. and then broil for 5-7 mins. All of the flavors will caramelize, leaving the fish extremely flavorful and moist.

This is a great recipe to have on hand! Everything but the salmon is pretty much a staple so you can always have great tasting salmon when you get it fresh. I make this recipe for two but always double to sauce so there is lots for the rice.

Did as others suggested and doubled the sauce, added a little ginger too. I also thickened the sauce (after baking) with some cornstarch.  Everybody had seconds or more!  Kids, 7, 9, and 11.

I'm overweight and a diet controlled diabetic.  But I love to have breakfast sausage patties with breakfast.  I decided to try this recipe with boneless skinless chicken breasts that had all the visible fat removed. When I cooked them even my teenagers ate them and asked for more.  I had to make a double batch.  Wonderful recipe!

B-. This was a good recipe. Family liked it a lot. However would highly recommend to marinate at least 5-6 hours instead to get the full impact of flavour, esp from the soya sauce, garlic and sesame oil. Also, I didn't do this but putting it on the grill/ BBQ would make it even more fantastic. Thx

The fish was a little too soggy after an hour and half of marinating.  I usually cook my fish on 425* for 25 minutes.  I think I will try it again without marinating, just pouring the sauce over the fish then cooking it as I usually do.  We had this meal with a salad and homemade Asian dressing.

This recipe was great!  I followed the suggestions and baked for 15 minutes and broiled for another 7 and it came out perfectly.  I saved the marinade, added corn startch and poured over the finished salmon and brown rice.  With a side of steamed green beans, it was a flavorful, healthy meal that I will make again!

Very good with salmon as well as with chicken. I also added minced ginger, green onion and pepper flakes in the marinade - its my preference. Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good especially with the rice. The only thing I did differently was cook the rice in a rice cooker.

Excellent- quick, easy, and my family really loved. I grilled it and had great results. Like others, I doubled the marinade, except oil. I also added about 1/2 tsp. ground ginger to the marinade. (I didn't have fresh, which I would prefer)I marinated the salmon only about 1 1/2 hours b/c that is all the prep time I had! The flavor was still quite good. Then I grilled, skin side down for about 8-9 minutes. It is easy to just lift the fish off of the grill with a spatula, leaving the skin attached to the grill grates. (I use a spatula later on to lift skin off and throw out.) I boiled the marinade until it was reduced by 1/2 and spooned it over the plated fish before serving. Def. will make again this summer-probably for guests. I did not make rice- but will next time :)

I made this last night for Company and got Great Reviews.. I did not change a thing in the ingredients. I did marinate for about 3 hours and I cooked it on  foil on the BQQ. I did skin my salmon before marinating so the flavor can penetrate.

I must say I was surprised with this one! I really enjoyed it! I expected it to be super sweet (which I love) but it was just the right amount of sweet and salt. The onions were great in it as well..added a nice crunch. I also doubled the sauce because we are 'saucy' people. :) I've also never made rice with dill weed and it came out pretty good as well. We had this for lunch the next day and it heats up well. We had with 1/2 the amount of rice and steamed cabbage. Very good and very light. :)

Absolutely delicious and so easy. The only problem was that I couldn't stop eating it so I am really full now! I followed someone else's advice and doubled the recipe, keeping the oil the same. I also added a couple of finely chopped chilli peppers because I like things spicy and it really added to it. Will make it again for sure!

This was not as good as I thought it would be.  Much tastier is the mustard, honey, sesame oil, ginger, soy, garlic marinade I usually do for salmon.

I'm not a fan of Salmon but loved this meal.  The only substitute I made was red wine vinegar because I had no rice vinegar.  Served over brown rice and boiled baby carrots with a dab of butter and a dash of cinnamon.

I made this a couple of days ago & my toddlers ate up every last bite on their plate & asked for more.  I didn't have 2 lbs of salmon but I made the recipe exactly as written & it came out wonderful.  Used just a small spoonful of the marinade left in the pan for the rice on the kids plates & they thought that was fantastic.  Went well with broccoli on the side as well.  I'll give the recipe a 5 for the ease of putting together, flavorfullness & most important for us, kid friendly.

This was delicious.  I did double the sauce like others suggested, but I forgot to half the oil.  I thought it turned out fine.  I did add some cornstarch to the sauce because I was in a hurry.  The only thing I didn't like about this recipe is that the smell lingered in my house until the next day and it didn't reheat very well.  But the flavor was wonderful.

This was great, if just a tad greasy (I know part of that is because of the fish itself). I think I will cut down on the amount of oil next time.

good and easy. I doubled the sauce, added ginger, baked for 17 minutes, than removed from marinate and put under broiler on low for 5 minutes. To the sauce, I boiled down a bit and served over salmon and rice. Delicious.

Love this recipe! Even my 4 year old said it was delicious! I only used 1 lb of salmon and spooned the extra sauce on top of the salmon before serving. I cooked the salmon on 400 degrees so that it would caramelize. Before serving I also splashed a little extra soy sauce on each. It was the perfect touch!! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is definitely in my top 2 or 3 salmon recipes.  I didn't have sesame oil so I used peanut oil instead and topped with a shake of sesame seeds.  SUPER!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

I had my husband make the marinade while I was at work by telling him over the phone. Usually if he doesn't like the look or smell of something (sesame oil) he won't even try it... well... he tried this and told me to give it a 5. This will be served in my house over and over!

I had high hopes for this salmon and made Asian-inspired sides to have with it, but it just didn't do it for me.  My boyfriend and daughter liked it which is why I am giving it 4 stars, but I have found much better salmon recipes on this site.  Thanks anyway.

I read the reviews first and decided to follow the suggestions for making more sauce (I agree it's a "must") and adding some ginger to it.  I also decided to broil the salmon tops in order to carmelize the sauce on the salmon(yum).  While I was broiling the salmon, I was reducing the sauce on the stove top, if it doesn't reduce quick enough then use the corn starch, but I prefer to just reduce the sauce by cooking it on a slow boil on the stove in order to ger a nice thick "gravy" without adding the corn starch or flower, that way you're not adding any other flavors to that phenominally delicious sauce. I will definitely make this again!

Wow,we really loved this.  I did make changes suggested by other reviewers.  Doubled sauce (decreased olive oil), took the salmon out of the sauce and broiled on low for about 5 minutes while thickening the sauce on the stove with cornstarch mixed in cold water.  Also added ginger to my sauce, and sprinkled salmon with some Old Bay seasoning.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't have any sesame oil so I made it without and was still good. Made double the sauce though cause my kids like over their rice.

It was okay, but I found it too oily.  Maybe I should have followed some of the substitutions that were mentioned in the reviews.  I will try it again with some of the readers suggestions.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did make one modification, which was to substitute honey for some of the brown sugar, because my brown sugar had gone rock solid. I think the honey was a nice addition.

Excellent recipe! I wish however I had followed the advice of others and cut the olive oil in half - the marinade was way too oily. I did add powdered ginger and extra soy sauce. All in all a great dish and I will make it again.

I added more sugar to it and it's very tasty.  Instead of baking the fish, I actually cooked the fish in the marinade on the stove top.

This marinade gives the fish such a great flavor.  We used it on Salmon and Tilapia.  I want to get some Ahi Tuna Steaks and try it out on that.

It seemed as though all the flavor of the sauce mixture was superficial, despite the slits I put in the salmon. However, it was a nice change from the usual salmon at my house. I would use a little less garlic and maybe a bit more soy sauce--the final turn-out did not seem at all Asian to me.

Forgot the onions and didn't make the rice. Marinated only for 10 minutes, but still mind blowing. Added ginger powder to the marinade.

Absolutely fantastic, 5 stars hands down!  We love salmon and I made this one last night taking other reviews to cut the oil in half.  I had 2 filets (about 5oz each), so I did not double the sauce.  Cut olive oil and sesame oil in half and decided to add 1/2 tsp fresh ginger.  Baked for about 23 mins and it was fabulous!  Served over a bed of couscous (only because it was quick to make) and steamed green beans.  I am definitely glad to have cut the oil down and would probably even cut out a bit more, but the sesame is a must!  A definite keeper and a must try!

My family enjoyed this meal very much.  I too lowered the olive oil and added ginger. I had to triple the sauce though.  I also added ginger and broiled the last 7-8 minutes.  Instead of rice, I used couscous, much quicker than rice and you can't goof up couscous.  I still added the dill to the water for the couscous.  Delicious, will make again.

As many others suggested I increased the marinade amount, decreased the olive oil and broiled the last 5 minutes.  I also used lite soy sauce which did not decrease the taste -- just the salt!  This was absolutely wonderful and our new house favorite preparation for salmon.  Thanks for posting!

My 3 teenage children asked me to make this again...and they usually complain when I make fish for dinner. I made only minor changes: marinated only for half an hour, baked for 20 minutes, and broiled for 5 minutes at the end. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Very tasty and actually much more mellow in flovr than I was expecting. I cut the oil in half and added in some powdered ginger. An easy way to serve up some great fish!

I have made this several times now.  Very, very good and very, very easy!  I listened to what others said and doubled the marinade.  I also added a little teriyaki sauce, which gave a very nice flavor.  The dill weed gives a very nice flavor to both the rice and the salmon.

Would have given this 4.5 stars if 1/2 stars were an option. Followed fellow posters' suggestions: doubled marinade, reduced olive oil, added fresh ginger, reduced baking time to 15 minutes in marinade and broiled for another 7 (w/o marinade).  Overall, delicious!!! I used a brown rice mixture, seasoned with thyme/sage and cooked in 1 cup each of chicken broth & water.

I have been making something very similar for years and it is delicious. My recipe calls for 1/2 cup honey if you don't use rice wine vinigar and brown sugar and red pepper flakes instead of dill and black pepper. Can make as spicy as you like.

This was an EXCELLENT and EASY recipe!  My whole family thoroughly enjoyed it - including the 15 month old!  We doubled the sauce ingredients and omitted the dill, since I am not a dill fan and used a ginger-garlic mix instead of plain garlic.  It was absolutely wonderful!  Will definitely make again - and again, and again!

My boyfriend really liked this recipe. I had to do a few minor substitutions and it seemed to work out just fine. I used red wine vinegar instead of the rice wine.  I used toasted sesame oil instead of just sesame and i had to use onion and garlic powder because i didn't have fresh. I would definitely make this again :) great recipe!

This marinade makes a delicious sauce for rice.  I made the amount in the recipe, but for 1 lb salmon.  There was no sauce left, that's for sure.  Instead of plain white rice, I made Kashi 7 whole grain pilaf with dill, and it was really good!  Next time I'll put a little more dill.  I didn't have sesame oil or rice vinegar so I substituted with olive oil and cider vinegar.  I'm sure the original ingredients are more flavorful.  I found that 30 minutes at 350 degrees did not quite do it.  The salmon was not hot enough in the middle, so I gave it another 10 and it was perfect!!  I guess it depends on your oven and your salmon.  It was a great dinner, thank you!

very good.  i added fresh ginger and doubled the garlic - also squeeed in fres lime.  You could use half the brown sugar and it would still be sweet enough. i served over orzo with cilantro and cherry tomatoes.

This was the first time I have ever tasted or cooked salmon.  This was so easy and yummy.  My husband loves salmon and said this was the best salmon he's ever had.  I added a few pinches of ginger.  Next time I will double the recipe.  Thanks!

I made this dish using a couple of sliced green onions instead of the minced onions.I had a bag of fresh spinach that I dressed with a little olive oil and rice wine vinegar. I put the spinach on the plate, put a mound of steamed rice on top and topped that with the salmon fillet. Then I drizzled the remainder of the marinade over the salmon. Beautiful presentation and an absolutely delicious and nutritious recipe that my family loved! This could also be made for an elegant dinner party. Next time I'll double the marinade though, you can never have too much marinade!

I used 2x the marinade as others recommended (actually, used 1 lb. of salmon). Other changes I'd make would be to add a little ginger as others have said, and I'd use green onions instead of regular minced—I dislike the little crunchiness and the texture the regular onions give. My own mistake was using frozen salmon, blech! That's not the recipe's fault though! Oh, I'd also flip the fish over skin side up, broil it for about 5 minutes first, peel off the skin, spoon marinade on top, and bake for another 25 or so. I didn't make the dill rice, which honestly seems a really weird accompaniment for an asian-seasoned salmon. I just made some simple quinoa with veg broth. Next time I'll use fresh salmon. Actually might try lime juice in place of the rice vinegar just for a change of pace, although it was fabulous as is. Did I mention the marinade was really yummy?

I was never a salmon person, and the only reason why I decided to cook it today is because it was the only thing I had in my freezer. IT WAS AMAZING. I definitely am going to do it again in the near future. My husband fell in love with it. I made some changes as I read in other reviews -double the marinade- and add ginger. Strongly recommend.

Salmon is my all time favorite fish and I've tried different recipes from all over the world. This recipe seemed rather plain. The rice came out dry and the sauce wasn;t enough. Overall, the flavor was ok, but nothing too special.

This wasn't bad...but it was too thick on the flavors on the marinade. If you don't like the flavor of salmon, it might be good, but for us living here in Seattle, this ruined the delicate flavor of the fish. We will not be having this again.

Excellent overall taste!  I'm not a big fan of salmon but with this mix of ingredients I had to try it.  My husband loved it and so did I.  I'll definitely have to make it again.  This recipe is almost as delicious as the Soy Ginger Salmon from this site.  YUM!

I really enjoyed this recipe.

I took some serious liberties with it and my salmon still turned out really well.

I used a frozen salmon, didn't marinate it and left out the dill and sesame oil because I didn't have any. I also some how forgot about the water and used red finely diced red onion. 

Regardless, the salmon was still delicious.

Fantastic! Flavorful yet not overbearing. A wonderful recipe! I did white rice with veggie broth instead of dill rice but the salmon is the important part anyway and it was wonderful.

This salmon was very good, I made much more sauce as others had recommended and it was great.  I probably should have cooked it a few more minutes than it called for.

WOW this was good!! My boyfriend and I kept commenting on how it tasted like restaurant salmon. I followed the recipe exactly and it was PERFECT on the grill.

We did not make the white rice... I served it with grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf.

Excellent, I didn't have much time to make it so it only marinated for an hour, but it was still great. Next time I'm going to marinate it for half a day so it has supa-flavor

I just made the salmon portion of this meal. It was very tasty, but I was hoping for a bit of a stronger taste to the marinade. I marinated the salmon overnight, so next time I may go a little heavier on the soy sauce and onion. I took right about 30 minutes to bake, as per the recipe.

Awesome!  Whenever I make this everyone wants the recipe.  I triple the marinade. I serve the salmon this way on each plate:  white rice, top with spring salad mix, top with salmon, then drizzle sauce over top.  I add a crusty french bread and this makes a perfect meal.

It was wonderful! Only, I didn't realize I was out of rice vinegar, so I used sweet rice wine instead, and it worked beautifully.  My son, who doesn't normally like fish - well, all sea food for that matter, told me it was very good, and ate it up the way he does bacon!  A definite keeper.

This salmon is absolutely delicious.  I marinated for only about an hour before baking.  There was enough marinade that it didn't all dry up in the oven, but just carmelized a little, so it was great to spoon over the fish.  I didn't make the rice at all, and served the salmon with Chinese Sesame Noodle Salad, also from this site.  It made a perfect side dish.

Excellent taste!  I used jasmine rice because that's all I had on hand.  Definitely DOUBLE THE SAUCE!!  It would be too dry with the recommended sauce.  I also marinated the salmon for 3 hours.  Delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe :)

This is an awesome recipe.  I make this sauce as soon as I get fresh salmon home from the market, and let it marinate as long as possible.  A friend first made this for me several months ago and its been a reccuring meal at our house ever since!!  I like to use McCormick's "Dilly" seasoning rather than just plain dill in the rice though.  A big hit with my husband who doesn't care for salmon all that much!!

Loved this dish, I expected a litle more "Asian" flavor though, so I used Jasmine (Thai) rice instead of the plain white including:1tbsp butter and a few dashes of salt to the water plus the dill and added 1/4c precooked wild rice for color (once it was cooked). Other than that everything was the same except I used sesame tempura oil (b/c it was all I had) and it came out great. For a great presentation add a few tbsp's of fresh toasted sesame seeds over the fish and rice. I severed it with Sugar snap peas and It was so good =-) thanks for the awesome take on salmon.

Smelled so good, even just sitting in the marinade in the refrigerator!  I tripled the sauce (except the oil), like so many others suggested.  I can't imagine making it with any less sauce than that.

Double or triple the sauce (except olive oil) and this salmon is SUPERB. It is very easy and very little clean up. Try not to get a thick cut of salmon so the sauce will absorb better when marinating. The hardest part was waiting for it to marinate. Very EASY and very GOOD!

We have salmon quite often as we live right on the ocean.  This is the best marinade for salmon that we have ever tried.  We've already passed the recipe around to friends and will try it again.  Thanks Lyseey!

Great way to prepare salmon! My family and I eat salmon every week so I look for different ways to make it. I made this recipe exactly as it was written and marinated just over 1 hour. It came out perfectly--and smelled wonderful, too!
Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was so easy and so tasty.  I made it for dinner with Japanese rice and made pickeled cucumbers to go along with it.  My family loved it!  My daughter asked for seconds. Great recipe for it's simplicity and taste.  Will definitely make again and again.

Very tasty sauce.  Didn't double the sauce and will do so next time.  REALLY good meal, and super easy to whip together.

I removed the vinegar and added toasted seasame seeds.  I also replaced the brown sugar with Splenda and it still tasted great!

Awesome and so easy! I used onion powder intead of real onions, and doubled the sauce as suggested by other reviewers. I even used dried dill, which did flavor the rice nicely. Next time I'll use real onions and fresh dill and I bet it will be even better.

My family and I thought this was very good.  I doubled the marinade but did not double the oils.  I also should not have doubled the garlic and onion.  It was WAY too garlicky!  My husband and 2 small girls thought it was awesome and wanted seconds!

Salmon was 2 lbs but I doubled sauce ingredients except for the oil.  Next time I may add a bit of ginger and also lower the amount of vinegar.
Easy recipe to make all in one dish.

During Lent, I am always trying to find good fish recipes that I can make on Fridays. This was really fabulous. It is so easy to marinate and cook the fish in the same dish. I wasn't that crazy about the rice portion. I couldn't taste the dill and there was way too much. I also made broccoli and cheese as a side dish. 
As previous reviewers had mentioned, I did decide to triple the marinade recipe and I am so glad that I did! I would rather too much than not enough.
Try this!

This was the very best salmon I have ever eaten, anywhere!  Better than any resteraunt! Even my 3 yr old LOVES it! DO make DOUBLE the sauce though, I didn't because I thought I would see how it turned out and I wished that I had, and I will when I make it again, this time for company!!!!

It was delish! I also minced some ginger and added to the marinade. It made a world of difference. I will definitely make it again. Note: I baked it for 10 minutes and then I broiled for 7. 30 minutes of baking would have made it too dry.

I followed the recipe exactly but substituted garlic and onion powder instead of fresh garlic/onion to make it a bit easier and added some ground ginger. I also didn’t cook the fish for 30min since I used sockeye salmon which only takes 18-20min. Otherwise delicious marinade/sauce. I also didn’t broil it at the end but do agree with other reviewers that would be a nice touch at the end. I will definitely make again!

This was so delicious and easy! I only marinated for an hour and the flavor was superb. I did add 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger because this salmon was Asian inspired and it is a must as an ingredient. Otherwise, I made no changes to the original recipe.I  had only two salmon filets, so the amount of sauce was perfect when I served it with roasted broccoli. I plan on making this salmon on a regular rotation during a busy week night.Thank you to the submitter of this recipe we loved it!

I've made this monthly or more for years. It's the most delicious salmon marinade I've used. I do put ginger in it too. And I grill it on a cedar plank on the Weber. Everyone loves it!

Yummy!! Not big fan of fish and Salmon is a strong tasting fish. This was a big hit and will make it again. To save time instead, of preparing and cooking rice, I microwaved a prepackaged long-grain asian rice with vegetables food item. I'll increase the marinade so there is more to go over the rice. Easy, Quick, Tasty and Healthy. Love It!!!

This is so good! As usual I just use recipes as a guide because I have my own ideas or don't have all the ingredients. For this I had no rice vinegar or sesame oil. But I replace the rice vinegar with white vinegar, used vegetable oil instead of sesame oil and toasted some sesame seeds in 1 TB veg oil and tossed in about 1 tsp. Didn't add onion. Added 1 TB maple syrup. I doubled this recipe for about 1 1/2 lbs of salmon. I marinated it and then laid salmon on a parcement lined cookie sheet spooning a bit more sauce over it. I broiled them. Took about 8 minutes. I put the glass dish of extra sauce in the oven as I was roasting  carrots and rutabaga (tossed in sesame seed and veg oil) and let it come to a boil then just kept it hot until everything was done. Served this with basmati rice laid the salmon on top of rice spooned sauce over and put root veggies all around the outside. A small amount of fresh spinach tossed with toasted sesame seeds and balsamic dressing completed the dish. Was one of the best salmon meals we have had!

I’ve made this recipe several times now. The first time I did it for salmon but since then I have been using it for tilapia. Put the marinade over the fish and let it sit in the refrigerator and then place it in a frying pan with all of the marinade mixture. It gives the fish such a great flavor ( I don’t even like seafood) and then having the extra sauce is delicious on a bed of rice. I will say that it’s best to double the recipe because you will definitely want more than this recipe makes.

Very nice salmon recipe.  I don’t think it needs ginger as suggested by reviews, but I did slip it under the broiler to finish it.  Be careful with this extra broiling step because it is easy to overcook salmon.  
I did double the marinade sauce.  There still wasn’t enough to thicken as suggested by some reviews, but I didn’t think it needed it.  I didn’t cut back on the oils and we did not  find the sauce too oily. 
Depending on the thickness of your salmon, 30minutes will be too long.  I am usually cooking for just  two and two fillets of salmon take 15 minutes in a 350f (175c) oven plus 5 minutes under the broiler.  Keep an close watch on the flakiness of the salmon.  Or better yet, use an instant read thermometer, salmon is done at 55c. ( 130f).

The family loved this.  I think I needed to marinade it for longer to really get the flavor into the meat.

Not bad but not great.  Marinade had too much oil to reduce into a gravy.  Dill rice was flat but maybe my dill was past prime.  Put some marinade into the rice and it picked it up.  Plan on making a stir fry rice with left over rice and marinade, adding some veggies and an egg.

My hubby LOVED this recipe! After looking at some of the reviews, I made a few changes to the original recipe: I only had 10 oz of salmon to work with, so I kept most of the measurements the same except I only used 1/2 the amount of both oils, used onion powder instead of fresh onions (too overpowering), added chopped chives, and added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger. Also, since I only had 10 oz, I cut the baking time down to 13 min at 350 degrees then took the salmon out of the marinade, put it on a greased cookie sheet, and broiled it for an additional 6 min- flipping it over halfway through the broil. It turned out perfect! For the sides, I used long-grain brown rice, dill, and topped with a bit of low sodium soy sauce when the rice was ready. I also added frozen green beans to the salmon and sauce, and baked them together.

This is my go to recipe for salmon. My favorite way is to grill it. I've also started using this recipe for chicken as well. I marinate the chicken in the morning and make kebabs out of it for dinner. I use way less sugar as I think it does not need much.

I made just the marinade part of this recipe, which I used to marinate some salmon fillets that I was grilling on a cedar plank. I was really impressed with how perfectly the marinade (which took about a minute to whip together) infused the salmon with that classic Asian flavor like you'd get in a good restaurant. I immediately put this recipe into my file for future use. This is just what I was looking for.

I love it! I marinated the salmon at the minimum amount of time required (which I was a little weary of but it worked out just fine) and doubled the amount of sauce. It was very tasty...I would add more to the rice, however, as it was a little bland. I threw in some sea salt and garam masala to kick up the flavor.

This recipe is a great inspiration, Ofcourse i changed it a little since i didn't have sesame oil and well, i always add some herbs to everything. But the idea of garlic with onion and soy sauce turned far better then i expected. Absolutely love it!

I made it exactly as the recipe described.  I ended up marinating it for about 12 hours but oh boy it was good! I may cut back slightly on the soy sauce and sesame oil but overall a really nice flavor to come from MY kitchen.

This marinade is fabulous. I doubled the marinade as we like things juicy. My salmon was skinned already. I cut the fish into 1/2 size portions, so it plated two pieces each, the flavor was sweet and simply a big hit.

I have been slaving over skillet raised salmon and suffer the mess and smell and extra time for years! I have been slaving over skillet raised salmon and suffer the mess and smell and extra time for years!Since we love the Asian flavors of this recipe,  I marinated a half salmon, and popped it in the oven before anybody could object. As it turns out everyone was amazed, and hubby insists on this new and easy method as often as possible. We still like crunch in our meals, so instead of the fried fish, we roast cauliflower and brussels sprouts. We still do the brown rice along side. Often side it with orange slices.

This recipe is a great base and I have served this dish to many guests and dates to great ends.  Like other reviewers have commented, you can either cut the oil in half or double the rest of the marinade ingredients.  I tend to double and then make a reduction out of the marinade after the fish is in the oven.  Fresh ginger also spices this dish up and gives it a more rounded asian flavor.

Great base  recipe and I heeded the advice of cooks having
adjusted the  amount of olive oil and cutting it by half. I actually
tripled the marinade and added ginger, lemongrass, and substituted half of the onion amount with scallion for a more
delicate flavor. I may use shallots next time. I let it sit overnight
in the refrigerator and then cooked it covered for 20 minutes,
a few minutes under a broiler for finishing carmelization as others recommended and then served it at room temperature in lettuce cups for a pool party. They were a huge hit with all 
ages.  I highly recommend it and best to utilize the other cooks' notes for success!!!

This recipe was easy and very good. I did not make any changes and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I will make it again with added fresh ginger.

I only made the salmon part of this recipe as I didn't have the time to watch over rice (and I need to watch my rice cooking closely otherwise I screw it up) so served it with some instant rice. This was lovely, but I pulled the salmon out 5mins early and while it was still moist, it was a little overdone. I think pulling it out after 20-23mins would have been ideal.
Edit - made this again using the full recipe including the rice. Big mistake. The rice didn't turn out at all. I should have trusted the rule of 2 parts water to one part rice ... The rice dried out too quick and the top portion did not cook. Will only use this recipe for the salmon in future.

I would give this 5 stars for the salmon, but I'm only giving it 4 because I felt the rice was lacking something. I drizzled some of the leftover marinade over the rice which made it much better.

Asian Salmon Haiku: "There's too little sauce, didn't penetrate the fish. Still, the taste was good." There just wasn't enough marinade to be fully incorporated with 2 lbs. of salmon. I made plain basmati rice (not the dill recipe as written above), but otherwise did everything else as follows. If I make this again, I would increase the marinade, but probably not the sesame oil as it was strong enough at 1 TB.

I added some spicy brown mustard to the marinade when I made this Asain Salmon Dish....other then that followed the directions as is.  It was so moist and delicious.  The sauce made a nice compliment to the quinoa that was made to go with it.

Just made this for the first time tonight for friends.  Everyone loved it and said it's a keeper.  Many of them are eating low carb, so I didn't make rice, but next time I will, so I can sop up all that delicious sauce:-)

The market was out of salmon, so I made this with ahi tuna instead (baked for 12 min., so it was still a bit pink inside). It's a great marinade--simple and flavorful, and definitely something I'd make again, with salmon or ahi.

I usually pan fry my fish.  Baking it keeps it moist.  I substituted only the olive oil for coconut oil.  Since this is a mildly sweet dish the coconut oil paired well.  I will be making this again!

It was delicious and i did use 2lbs' recipe on 1.5lbs of fish.  But the sauce was so delicious, next time, i will double the sauce so i have more sauce for my rice.  Still the recipe's sauce ingredient is perfect.  Thank you so much.

Recipe turned out fantastic.

I added a few splashes of orange juice, dash of red pepper flakes, a teaspoon or two of homemade hot pepper vinegar, a teaspoon or two of hoisin sauce, garlic and onion powder.  Since I didn't try the original recipe, it's hard to compare, but what I did came out great.  Had I read the reviews, I might have increased the sauce volume a little more, but maybe the extra sauce from the added ingredients was enough.  I made up for it by lightly soy-saucing the rice on my plate.

Next time, I cooked for 25 minutes but will shoot for 15-20 next time, as I prefer medium-rare salmon instead of medium-well, and I'll take the suggestion of finishing under the broiler for the final 5 minutes.  My sauce caramelized fairly well but would have been better if it was just a touch stickier.

I paired it with some asparagus that I sauteed in coconut oil and sesame oil with a few tablespoons of finely minced white onion and garlic, a couple teaspoons of soy sauce, and a little hoisin to tie them all together.  I also added garlic and onion powder and a tiny bit of salt to the rice while cooking it, and it all came together really nicely.  I'm definitely saving this recipe for the future!

Awesome! I gave this 5 stars to be fair. I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand- I was missing rice wine vinegar, of which this recipe called for 2 tbs. I improvised with 1 tbsp. of apple cider vinegar and 1 tbsp. of sweet cooking rice seasoning. The recipe was delicious and I only marinated about 15 minutes. Next time I will have all of the ingredients on hand, I'm sure it would be even better!This was enjoyed by everyone. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Loved this, and I made sure to double the sauce the second time (and cut the olive oil in half.) Broiling for a few minutes was also a great suggestion by some other reviewers ans gave it a nice glaze. I agree that the taste of the salmon is a bit lost in all the other flavors, but that's something I personally don't mind.

We tried this recipe because it looked good and was highly rated.  We were very disappointed. It seemed to lack enough soy sauce and brown sugar.  The sesame oil was too strong.
Also the sauce was far too oily to put over the salmon or the rice.
We will never use this recipe again.

Good recipe and easy to make. Like other reviewers I felt the urge to add some ginger to the marinade. I also doubled the marinade for extra sauce. I think that with or without the ginger, the recipe as is would be fine. If you want extra sauce, double the marinade. If you don't tend to like having extra sauce, use the amounts as written.

We have made this recipe several times and it always turns out great! I made it for my mother and sister in law and they raved about it! Even my 3 year old loves it. The best part is it is very easy to make. My husband can literally only cook 5 dishes and this is one.  For the people that thought it was bland, perhaps you did not marinate it for a long enough period of time? I have noticed that if we marinate it for less than an hour, the flavour is not as strong. Anyways, would definitely recommend this recipe for any salmon lovers!

Not bad, Next time I would try adding more sugar and more sesame oil or just less soy sauce. This time around I ended up adding alot of extra sugar and some extra sesame oil.

This is delicious. You can eat this with an asian themed meal, or with a regular side. The soy sauce flavor is just right. Mild, but not too mild. It crisps nicely in the oven.

Great recipe. Keeps the fish moist - maybe a little too moist. I would cut back on the oil next time. My family also found it to be too sweet. Overall, not the most exciting thing to eat, but a great recipe to pull out when you're pressed for time.

I was very disappointed, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The flavor was rather bland and not worth the time necessary to prepare it.  There are many recipes on this site that are much better.

This was delicious and so easy to make. I would give it five stars, but I made this using changes suggested by reviewers. I halved the Olive Oil, and doubled everything else. I think next time, I might just triple everything else because the marinade is very tasty. Also, even though reviewers suggested baking for 15 minutes (as opposed to the listed 30), I found that this was still too much time! The salmon was overcooked. I think 10 minutes would have been fine in my oven.

Good, quick, flavorful. Not my favorite way to prepare salmon, but could be more interesting paired with Asian-inspired side dishes that have more going on.

My husband and toddlers loved it, but we like salmon in general. Minor modifications to adjust to our tastes: 1) Doubled the sauce, but wish I had quadrupled it since we love gravy on rice. I don't know how much salmon I had, since I used individually frozen fillets (Used 5 fillets, each about the size of 2 decks of cards. Guessing 3-3.5 lbs since I used about half of a 7lb bag of fish). 2) Though I doubled the recipe, I actually used less sugar...a little more than 1 Tbsp for the whole thing (NOT packed as called for in the recipe). Also used low-sodium soy sauce.
3) Let the flavors of the marinade meld together for a few hours (I did mine overnight because I was making this for lunch and like to prep what I can the night before. 15 min should suffice).
4) First marinaded fish FLESH-side down (vs skin side down) for 45 min so meat would absorb the marinade, then flipped it and let it marinade for another 30. I think marinading flesh-side down made the fish very flavorful. Then I scored the top of fish and ladeled 1-2 spoonfuls of sauce over the fish, per the recipe. 
5) 25 min cooking time was perfect for my oven. 
6) Served over plain brown rice since I prefer eating stuff with the Asian flavor profile that way, though I may give the dill rice a shot next time.

Other notes: 
When we reheated leftovers, I flaked the fish, then mixed it around in the gravy so it would still be moist and flavorful - it was, though it was a tad salty for my taste. Next time, I will dilute grav

This is the best asian salmon I have ever had and my husband loved it as well.  I did double the sauce recipe and added 1 & 1/4 tsp minced ginger and minced green onions instead of white onion.  I can't tell you how easy and delicious this is.  Absolutely wonderful and I will definitely be making this again and again!

Great. Doubled the sauce, used onion powder instead of onion, added powdered ginger to taste, baked for 15 minutes skin down and broiled for 7 skin up. I noticed this, when broiling the salmon don't move the pan any closer to the heating element, leave it in the middle. I burned the skin a little until I realized I should have left the pan where it was.

The only reason I rate this 4 star is because I did read other's recommendations to cut the amount of olive oil, add 1 tsp ground ginger, and double the other ingredients for the marinade.  I also put it under the broiler for 7 minutes which was about 2 minutes too long, 5 minutes would be perfect.  I added lemon juice to the dill rice which also turned out awesome.  Loved the flavors of the salmon and rice.  Even called my sister to tell her to try it!

This was pretty good.  I think next time, I will use less sugar and more sesame oil.  I was looking for something with a little stronger flavor to accentuate the salmon, but what I got was mostly salmon with a little flavor.  I think that just plain low-sodium soy sauce and sesame oil, a little garlic, and maybe, MAYBE, some rice vinegar would be better and easier.  That said, just because it wasn't quite to my taste doesn't make it a bad recipe.  The flavor of the salmon comes through clear and strong, which might be the point -- to just have a little Asian subtlety.

This was wonderful!  I did reduce the olive oil by 1 TBSP and added some minced fresh ginger to the marinade. I also followed the advice of another reviewer and added a bag of stir-fry veggies while baking.  Served over leftover couscous and it was SO GOOD.  Easy, healthy, delicious--doesn't get much better than that. I will be making this again for sure. :-)

We really enjoyed this recipe, without extra sauce :)  Not doubling the sauce, helped keep us to the nutritional facts that are listed on this recipe.  The only thing we did different was mix a little flavored rice in with the regular rice, instead of adding the dill.

Just made this.  Took people's recommendation to make a little extra sauce... enough to cover the salmon in the baking dish.  Could have taken it out in 25 minutes, I think, but it was still moist and wonderfully-flavored after 30.  I did not make the rice (yet); instead, just marinated (1 hour) and cooked the salmon per instructions.  When it was done, I removed the skin, used a fork to scrape off the dark/fatty meat that is just below the skin.  Leftovers (including sauce) went in a dish to refrigerate and reheat over the next couple of days.

My whole family loved this recipe! The combination of rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil is outstanding. I used fresh ginger and substituted shallots for the onion (a more delicate flavor than regular onion, in my opinion). I made 2 cups of the marinade so we had lots of sauce to pour over the rice. This will definitely become a regular staple in our dinner rotation.

My family actually ate salmon. I've also tried it on other fish and chicken and grilled it instead of baking. My family now loves fish and chicken night. My family hated fish before this recipe and the grill. When I grill it, I keep the marinade at the grill and re-dip each piece of fish and or chicken when I flip it. Wonderful recipe. Thanks

This was fantastic! I used a rainbow trout fillet in place of the salmon, and reduced the sesame oil to 1 teaspoon. Make sure you chop the onion very fine so that it cooks through (unless you don't mind a bit of crunch). I served this with wild rice and steamed baby bok choy. I will definitely add this to my rotation!

The aroma in my house alone was enough to have me sold on this recipe.  The taste was fantastic!  I didn't change any of the ingredients.  We eat salmon at least once a week here and I'm always looking for ways to keep it interesting.  This recipe will now be in the rotation!  Thank you.

This is the best recipe I've ever made, says the taste tester in the house.  Requested for when company comes over.  As suggested, I doubled sauce and did the broil on the tail end to carmelize.  Num!

I always make salmon the same way, so when I was looking for an Asian-flavoured salmon recipe, I tried this one, and it's amazing!!!  So tasty!!  Hubby and both kids like it too!  I agree with others about making more sauce than the recipe states.  I also add in a little grated ginger.  Green onion instead of regular onion also adds to the Asian flavour.  LOVE it!!!

Loved it! I pan fried my salmon, though. Very different from the usual. Marinated fish for a few hours, added ginger and used less of oil and more of the marinade.

It was good, I love the sauce but on the salmon the flavor is not as strong as I would like it. I'm sure others would say it's perfect. That's just my personal preference.

Good recipe, I think it needs a tad bit more seasoning to it to give it some zing, I will experiment with that on the next go.

This was good, my 5 year old who automatically rejected it liked it once he tried it.  I baked for 20 min and broiled for 7 and it was perfect.  My only change next time is that I am going to take the leftover marinade and make a sauce to drizzle on top so that the flavor is more dominant, it is more like an accent the way it is.  I will also cut down on oil, it definitely did not need 2TB.  I made 4 small pieces and the marinate amount was perfect but I will double it when I make the sauce.

Great sauce for salmon! I doubled the recipe but halved the oil as others recommended. I also pan-fried the salmon which made thickening the sauce very easy. It only needed around 5 minutes a side like this. Next time I'll try adding some ginger for more spice.

As written this is an excellent recipe!  A touch of ginger and quadrupling the sauce recipe makes this spectacular beyond words.  I used chicken bouillon with the water for the rice and cut to 1 tsp of the dill weed.  We didn't have sesame oil, so I used a touch of Kraft Asian Sesame dressing to set it off.  Rave reviews from the kids (1, 2, 4, 9) and both of us loved it!  Goes great with a stir fired garlic/ginger veggie medley making this a fantastic meal!

I didn't find this to be a very good recipe. First of all, the portions are WAY off. It says 8 servings, but I followed the recipe and even added more just for 2 servings. Second, it just doesn't taste that great. To me, it tasted weird with salmon. It might taste good on chicken.

This was a fantastic salmon dish! I gave it four stars because I changed it a bit from the original recipe as others had suggested.  All 3 of my kids loved this and ate every bite.  I doubled the marinade, added fresh ginger and baked it for about 20 min. followed by 7 minutes in the broiler.  The broiling is a must.  It makes this the perfect dish!

This turned out great even though I changed some ingredients to suit what I had on hand. I omitted the sesame oil and just used more olive oil, and I used white white vinegar to replace the rice wine, but used a bit less than called for. I followed suggestions of adding ginger,broiling the fish and thickened up the sauce. Yum!

Wow!  This was great.  I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed amounts.  One comment about the marinade - it's delicious, but powerful.  I used this with a frozen salmon fillet and it worked wonderfully.  However, if I was using more expensive fresh salmon steaks, I don't think I'd use this recipe because the marinade (especially the vinegar) might overpower the taste of fresh salmon.

This is a fabulous recipe!  At the very least double the sauce - it's delicious and you'll want plenty for the rice.  I used brown jasmine rice - very nice.  I'll be making this one for company - and sending all of my children the recipe.

For such a simple recipe, this was phenominal.  I had all the ingredients on hand, and it worked so good over rice.  Add a veggie and that's a complete meal.  YUM!

My husband gave this a 5.  I would give it a 4.  The vinegar flavor was strong to me.  I do really like vinegar but it seamed overpowering.  I tripled the sauce because I am a sauce person and the amount of sauce was perfect.  I also added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of powdered ginger (because I didn't have any fresh).  I halved the oil before I tripled based on other reviews.  I agree that the sauce was not oily but I wonder if the oil would have made it less vinegary tasting to me.  I baked for 20 minutes and broiled for 5 minutes.  I wasn't sure if the "minced" onion was to be fresh onion or dry.  I used dry.  Next time I will use fresh or probably green onions as we really love them.  My husband loved it...it's a 5.

We loved this recipe.  I didn't use the dill rice because I had a wild rice mix and I didn't use rice vinegar b/c I didn't have it, but even without it, it was wonderful.

Tasted great and I took the advice of other reviewers.  I added Ginger and cut back on the oil, broiled the salmon and it only took 10 minutes!  Fast and  tasted great!  I will be making this again.

I preferred this to the China Moon Salmon I made last week, though I wasn't overly keen on the dill rice. My Costco salmon fillets were skinless, so I turned them every half hour or so for three hours - I thought they absorbed the marinade flavor nicely, but retained some of the salmony taste. Perfect. The only other thing I did differently was to sprinkle a few toasted sesame seeds over the fish and noodles. Very nice. Thanks!

OMG!!! Now this was unbelievably GREAT!!! I added some minced ginger to this recipe and omitted the rice/dill weed part. I just made the salmon (in fact I grilled it) and brought to our family's labor day party and even those who typically don't like salmon loved this. Everyone RAVED about how good it was. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Delicious, unfortunately the sauce around the fish burned so there was none for the rice, but a little soy sauce was perfect. I'll be making this again, the smell was incredible

This recipe is really good.  I add fresh ginger to the sauce as well.  I tastes very good with bell peppers too!  I also use it on pork chops.  A very good sauce!

a good base for me to work with.
I used canned salmon. didn't follow any of the measurements but had most of the ingredients. I lacked the onion and substituted garlic powder. I also didnt pull dill in the rice but I added sliced of ginger to the mix and instead of baking I fried (the salmon was already cooked coming from a can) mixed with the rice and it was an awesome experience to spice up the can of salmon i had before it went bad. will definately make again.

This was ok. I doubled the recipe as suggested by other reviews but I'm not sure I really liked the flavour all that much. I think it could have been better... maybe less soy sauce?

I've made a lot of salmon recipes in my day and this one ranks amongst the best. I used 1 pound of fresh salmon fillets, so kept the sauce ingredient amounts as indicated (there was lots for the pouring sauce). The only changes I made were to use chopped green onion, I added 1 tbsp of minced fresh ginger (which gave an amazing flavour), and used basmati rice (and did add the dill weed). Thanks so much for sharing the recipe, Lindseey.

I thought this was great!  I only gave it 4 stars though, because my husband did not care for it.  I would make it again, for company.  I served it w/quinoa instead of rice.

I gave this one a five simply because it should stay near the top of the list.  The recipe calls for too little sauce.  Following the advice below, I doubled the sauce, halved the oil. Baked for 15 minutes or so and brushed on the rest of the sauce...broiled for a few minutes 5-8.  This dish tastes great.  The broiling and extra sauce is a must but definitely worth the extra effort.

Very yummy! I would recommend doubling the amount of sauce it calls for. The sauce was good but there wasn't much of it to cover the fish and rice.

It was great!  I didn't have 2 lbs of salmon, I only had maybe 1.5 lbs but I went by the recipe accordingly, and did not make the dill rice but plain rice and with the sauce it was perfect with plain rice.  I let it sit longer in the marinade and didn't slash the salmon like it said.  It turned out just great!

Delicious and simple way to prepare salmon fillets, it comes out very moist and flavorful. The only comment I would make is to salt the salmon before pouring the marinade on top of it, without the salt the fish comes out a bit bland even with the soy sauce.

Wow, what flavor! I followed the tips of others and reduced the olive oil. I added 1 TBS. fresh ginger and 1 heaping TBS. of chinese chili sauce. It was great, I will be making this again.Maybe next time I will try and grill it, Heat up the sauce and glaze the salmon while grilling. Can't wait it already sounds good!

mmmmm! The sauce is perfect for 2 people and I like that it is quite different from other's I have tried. I didn't make the rice, but I did follow the advice of others and cut the oil in half and I broiled it the last 5 min. and it worked perfect!

My family loves this recipe! My kids are pickey eaters and they always ask for seconds.  I have made this 4 times and every time it continues to be a hit. Also, I always double the marinade so there is extra for the rice.

I do not like asian food or salmon but this was REALLY good. I grilled it, which really gave it a great taste. The whole family enjoyed it. The only thing I did differently was use wild brown rice rather than white. I am deffinatly going to keep this recipe and use it again for salmon. I bet that this maranade would taste really good on chicken too.

this salmon had a really nice flavor. I would double the sauce for sure if you actually want to have enough to spoon over the salmon after it's done cooking. We had enough left for 2 people so it was a tad disappointing. My kids ate it up which is always a good sign. I served it with vegetable basmati rice instead of dill rice simply because I don't care for dill

I went to one of those Teppanyaki restaurants and was trying to find a recipe that was similar tasting Salmon to what I had there... this came really really close -- it was very delicious... I used skinless salmon and fried it rather than bake it... it was good - i'd probably make this again, but will still search for something more same-tasting to the restaurant style Salmon that I want.

As I am presently cooking this salmon now, it smells so good and did taste a bit after 30 minutes.  It tastes amazing, but the salmon is not yet done.  Got a suggestion from another review saying the same thing and cooked it for 10 more minutes.  We will see.

I've been looking for an easy salmon recipe with an Asian flair for a while, and this was perfect.  I used 1 tsp of dried minced onion instead of fresh because I didn't have any on hand, and I used instant brown rice instead of the long grain white.  Turned out perfectly- this recipe is definitely a keeper!!

this was very good.  My 9-yr old was asking what smelled so good in the kitchen.  she ate 3 plates of it.  the whole family loved it and it is now part of our family cookbook.  double the marinade so you have some for your rice.  so good.

This is the BEST Salmon recipe ever!!!  I add 1 tbsp of minced fresh ginger to the marinade and it comes out even tastier!  I also marinade the salmon for at least 24 hours before broiling.  I love this recipe!

I made this for my parents and they LOVED it! It's a new family favorite. Like others had suggested, I doubled the amount of marinade, added about a tablespoon of grated ginger, and used green onions instead.  I served the salmon with white rice and a mixed green salad with sesame ginger dressing.

I made this for my husband for the first time tonight.  We absolutely love it!  I followed the recommendations of cutting down on the oil and adding ginger to the dish as well as broiling it at the end.  I also added some of our asian flair to it by serving it with white rice and topping it off with furikake (a japanese condiment that includes chopped seaweed, sesame seeds, etc).  Just awesome!

Delicious marinade and so easy to prepare!  Subbed Brown Suger Spenda for regular and dried basil for dill in the rice.  I agree with other reviewers about wanting plenty of sauce.  Yum!

I made this for dinner last night and it was awesome! I used two salmon fillets (prob. not 2 lbs) but the full recipe for sauce, and I was glad to have a little extra sauce, b/c it was so good! I made this with some sauteed spinach instead of rice, making it a great low-carb meal. My husband raved about it and it was so easy. A great, elegant, easy weeknight meal. Thanks for sharing!

I put this together to marinate in the morning, planning on cooking it that night.  My husband had cravings for something else, so I ended up cooking it the next night.  I was worried that it would be over-marinated, but I thought the flavor was perfect.  I could still taste the salmon, but the marinade added a nice touch.  I followed the recipe except for only doing half the amount of salmon but the full marinade.  I did not make the rice, but the salmon was wonderful on it's own!

Easy to make and delicious.  We used 1 pound of salmon, with reduced portions for the marinade, and the sauce mostly evaporated during baking - I will definitely increase the quantity of marinade next time.

This is for all you salmon haters!  If you don't like salmon, then you haven't had FRESH salmon.  Also, don't eat the pink stuff.  Get the red or king when available.  This recipe is awesome when using the good stuff.

Yummy!! The whole family loved it. Probably because it didn't have that fishy taste. I didn't have any wine vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar.

This was delicious!! I did add  some fresh ginger, and I reduced the oil a bit. I also scaled the recipe down to four servings, which I wish I hadn't done. A lot of the sauce dried up during baking.Next time, I'll make all the sauce  even for less fish. I made plain basmati rice, minus the dill, which went perfectly. I will definately make this again. The salmon was moist and tender, and the house didn't smell like fish!

This is my "go to" salmon recipe.  I have made it for tons of people and always get rave reviews.  I use far less sesame oil than is called for, the toasted sesame oil I use is a bit strong.  I also use seasoned rice vinegar it adds a nice flavor.  If I am going to grill the salmon I use 2-3 times the amount of brown sugar so that it gets a nice glaze on top - mmmmm good!  Great holiday meal for us non-meat folk!

Definitely be careful with how long your marinate this for.  I think I left it in the fridge a bit too long and it was really, really salty from the soy sauce. I thought it was a pretty good way (and very easy) to prepare salmon, but not outstanding.

This recipe makes a very flavorful dish. I used salmon and also tried the sauce/marinade on catfish.  Both were wonderful.  I didn't add the dill because I simply forgot.  I'll try it in the recipe next time.

doesn't look very appetizing once cooked. taste is mild and oriental but recipe didn't meet my expectations. Fish can get to be an oily dish.

This was a great find especially for my 6 year old who loves Salmon. The whole family was happy with dinner that night. I also served it to friends and used chicken instead of salmon and they said it was great. I didn't get any because there was none left!!

This is a tasty and different way to prepare salmon. I agree with other reviewers that the sauce should be doubled, and I also cut back on the garlic a bit (too much for my taste). I also agree that 30 minutes is a bit too long to cook. Fifteen to twenty minutes should do it.

This was a nice change for salmon.  I am not the biggest salmon fan but my husband loves it.  He really enjoyed the different flavor of the marinade.  The only thing I changed was, 1 tablespoon of olive oil instead of 2.  It wasn't oily at all.

Just made this tonight and it was very good. We like salmon and normally have it just plain. This was a good flavor and for someone who doesn't like fish so much it would make it much better.

My hubby loved this! I am not a salmon eater, so I can't comment for myself, but he said it was really good. The ingredients were a little hard to find in the town I live in, but I finally was able to get them all. The recipe was very easy to follow.

I made this tonight.  It was excellent.  I didn't have room in my fridge for the baking pan so I marinated the salmon in a ziplock freezer bag.  When I was ready to cook it I put the salmon in the pan and poured the marinade from the freezer bag over the salmon.  I would definetly make this again.

Very very good.  Made twice as much sauce and it wasn't too much.  Baked for 25-30 minutes, do not cook more than 30 minutes!  Good with some steamed asparagus with garlic butter.

This is an absolutely delicious way to serve salmon!!!  It got rave reviews from my dinner guests and, most importantly my three boys, who are typically very picky eaters! The salmon is flavorful and very tender - this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Fabulous recipe. I used steelhead trout instead.  I had never heard of it before.  It looked like salmon and was the only fish similar to salmon in the store.  I'm glad I tried it.  It was way cheaper and delicious.   Thanks for the recipe!

This RECIPE IS BY NO MEANS GREAT! The reason I gave it a four is because I thought it was a bit too oily. I would recommend to TRIPLE the sauce because it is to die for. If you do not like oily food, triple the sauce except the olive oil (1 spoon is enough I think). Nevertheless, ENJOYABLE and MOUTH-WATERINGly DELICIOUS!

this is so good! And I usually don't like things I cook myself. But this surprised me, it was so flavorful and I can't wait to make it again. I used cod instead of salmon though because I have a huge bag of cod fillets and I needed to use them, I know they're so different from salmon but it tasted wonderful anyway. And I put green onions instead of regular because that was what I had. This is the only way I will make fish from now on. Thank you!

Was not as 'tasty' as I expected.  Sauce was thin and watery.  I needed to microwave the salmon at the end to cook it all the way through.

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now.  It is absolutely FANTASTIC.  Deliciously perfect!  I never used to like fish, but now I actually have cravings for this recipe.  We double the sauce recipe because we like to pour the leftovers over the rice.

I've tried this recipe awhile ago and since then, my husband always makes me prepare this dish for him and our guests! Its so easy which I like b/c I'm not that great of a cook, but it always turns out wonderfully. I too doubled the amount of the sauces and I've marinated it up to 4 hours once(only cause i had to) and it still turned out really good!!

Husband thought this was the best salmon and officially is his favorite and I totally agree with him.  Not dry at all and the sauce is wonderful.  I would definetly make extra for the rice and fish.  Tasted even better the next day.  Thanks lynseey

Yum!!  I like all seafood, but rarely "crave" or cook it, but this recipe has changed my outlook.  I used a fillet of steelhead salmon (trout?)and this recipe was perfect.  I did as others suggested - double the marinade all except the two oils.  I used "Trader Joes" rice trilogy (white, brown & wild) and added some sauteed (where's spell check when you need it?) onion, celery & fresh dill.  This recipe gets a five star YUM from me & my dinner guests! Thank you Lynseey!

I am only giving this 4 stars because the rice didn't really turn out; which may be because I used brown rice. Maybe I needed more dill? Otherwise, this was awesome. I totally agree with those who said to make a lot of sauce. It is really tasty. I will definitely make this again--perhaps whenever I make salmon. Very easy too.

The only thing I would change:  ELIMINATE THE GARLIC!  I used far less garlic than called for and yet the taste was overwhelming.  Doesn't seem to me that garlic and salmon go together...maybe it's just this dish.  Otherwise, this would have been perfect 5-stars.

Mine seemed soggy, not sure if I did something wrong or if it's just supposed to be that way.  Next time I won't cook it in as much sauce to avoid it.  Great flavor, there will definately be a next time!

absolutely yummy. We eat brown rice around here and it was absolutely great with the sauce on it. I do though suggest doubling up on the sauce or everyone will fight over it!

This wasn't bad, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, just not flavorful enough for me. Will stick to my blackened salmon recipe. Thanks anyway!

My father-in-law says this is the best salmon he's ever had in his life!  I used brown sugar twin in place of brown sugar, as we've got several diabetics in the family.  The flavour was still excellent!  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was great!!!!!  I tried it on talipia and it was fantastic.  My husband and I love salmon and I can't wait to try it. I didn't have brown sugar, so I used honey. (great substitute)  I did double everything except the oil.  Thanks Lynseey!!!!!!

This is an excellent salmon recipe.  It was brought by a friend and ever since then we have been addicted to it!  We do double up on the brown sugar and make extra sauce.  Thank you for sharing!

this was so delicious! instead of doubling the whole marinade, you might wanna try to just make a second batch of it, and if its to bland heat it up and pour over salmon. i did it and it was fabulous!!

This recipe was good, and the guests that I had over did ask for a copy of it, but I found the onion somewhat overpowering.  Next time I would either really cut down on it or omit it entirely.  I had marinated the salmon overnight, and perhaps that was a bit too long.

This was the first salmon dish my husband ever had. He didn't think he'd like fish. Right after we ate dinner, he had to call his parents and tell them how great it was! It's really easy to make (esp. since you bake in the marinating dish) and comes out wonderfully flavorful.

Very delicious and elegant.  Sauce/marinade is outstanding.  I used lite soy sauce.  Sesame oil definitely makes it special.  Next time I might use a few sesame seeds for garnish.  Will definitely make this again.  Especially good to try on people that don't particularly care for salmon.   I will also try marinade w/ shrimp as a reviewer suggested, and I'm also tempted to try it on chicken. Will let you know how that turns out.

Love it, love it, love it!  I made it for my mother-in-law for dinner and they absolutely loved it!  I also doubled on the sauce ingredients and served it with white rice and the sugar snap peas recipe.  Thanks for the suggestions!

Great flavor combination. I was desperate for a salmon recipe that had some strong flavors, as some of the family aren't really crazy about salmon. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but the sweet and sour flavor was really yummy.

A very tasty dish. I doubled the recipe and would triple it the next time except the olive oil. My daughter loved it and had seconds but by that time all the sauce was gone!

Mmmmm. Great way to serve salmon. I made this a low-carb dish by nixing the rice and the sugar (still turned out sweet) and serving broccoli on the side. My husband loved it. Next time I will be sure to broil it so the top gets nice and brown. The well-cooked parts near the edges had a really intense flavor.

This was awesome! I made this for dinner for eight-I followed the directions per the site to make this for eight people, instead of four.
I did double the marinade-an absolute necessity!
Everyone loved the extra marinade over the rice.
I had several requests for the recipe-it is a keeper! THANKS!!!!
