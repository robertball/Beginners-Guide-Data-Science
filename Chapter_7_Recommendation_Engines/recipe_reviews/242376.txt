Made this tonight to use up some ground pork (we buy hogs by the quarter).  Didn't use the feta and put the cheddar on at the end because I had pre-sliced cheese.  Oh my - were these good! Great flavor combination and very juicy and flavorful.  Cooked to medium (which is usually not my comfort zone - prefer medium rare) the burger was fabulous!  Put in the freezer for about 10 minutes before cooking to ensure that they held together,  Thanks for the great way to use ground pork!

I made only one change, I substituted bbq sauce for hot sauce.  They  were super tasty and juicy burgers.  Only 2 of us, so had enough to freeze several burgers for another time.   Cooked on a bbq with a non-stick mat.  Came out perfect.

We really enjoyed these burgers. I was worried that pork burgers would be tougher than beef, but they were not. They had flavor and were juicy.  The feta cheese helped to take them to the top of my recipe file.

Very good.  Just have to watch the meat to make sure it's cooked thru but not overcooked.

I made these burgers for a freezer meal exchange and all the participants and their families loved them!  The only change was subbing smoked Gouda for the feta.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and froze them .  I grilled them fresh, from frozen, and defrosted.  They were great!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe but left out the feta (we are not big feta fans).  The burgers were very juicy and flavourful.  We will definitely make them again!
