These cookies are sooooooooo good! my whole family likes them. There my dad's new favorite cookie. Here's a little tip...after baking these cookies for the first time...I found that after baking 10 minutes...the edges are brown....but the middle isn't done...i just keep them in for 3 more minutes, and they turn out even better!

Delish! I modified a little to make a bit more healthy of a snack for my 18 mo old twins, and used 1/2 c reg flour and 1 c whole wheat flour. Used 1/2 tsp additional cinnamon, a little vanilla, about a spoon full of vanilla yogurt (I thought it looked a little dry), and left out the chocolate chips, nuts, and raisins. A keeper recipe.
*edit* Just made these with a small chopped up apple (about a cup).. it is a wonderful replacement if you don't use raisins. I also added a dash or two of cloves.. these are still one of my favorites to bake :)

These cookies were so good!  We're trying to make healthier desserts and had tried substituting applesauce for some of the butter in other recipes and ended up with dense, cake-like cookies--with more calories than these cookies.  These were crisp and chewy, delicious cookies and the spices in them were just right.  Yum!

I made a few changes.  Cut out the white sugar and used 1/4 cup honey.  Used organic butter.  Decreased salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  Added 1/4 cup ground flax seed to flour mixture.  Added 1/2 grated apple and decreased applesauce to 1/2 cup.  Added 1 teaspoon Double Strength Vanilla.  Baked at 350 for about 10 minutes.  Stored overnight in air tight container and they were even better the second day.  My boyfriend really liked them and he is a sugar hound, so this was a big change.  I will make these again.

These were really good! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because the recipe needed a little tweaking. I made them as written, it doesn't say how big of a spoonful to drop them on the sheet. I made them rather large like I always make oatmeal cookies, but they spread out a lot! I wound up with 6 pancake size cookies that fell apart! I added another 1/4 to a 1/2 cup more oats to the remaining dough, I just eyeballed it, made smaller cookies, but they still spread out quite a bit. I put the remaining dough in the fridge for an hour or so, added 2 minutes cooking to compensate for chilling the dough. They were perfect! Only other subs I did was use pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg, still used the 1 TSP cinnamon and I only used raisins. I also drizzled them with a maple glaze. Powdered sugar, milk and some pancake syrup, didn't measure those ingredients, but it's good on just about anything! Thanks for the recipe!

These were fabulous!  I used 1 cup of finely chopped apples in place of the applesauce and omitted the raisins.

Love this recipe because it only uses 1/2 cup butter unlike the usual 1 cup.  It also combines my two favorite cookies, oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip.  My husband and I ate almost the entire batch the evening that I made them.

Yum-eee!  These are more cake-like than most cookies, but that doesn't matter to us.  I leave out the white sugar completely, since it's plenty sweet with the brown sugar, applesauce, raisins, and chocolate.  I also used half whole wheat and half white flour (3/4 cups of each).  These are tasty treats that my kids love!

Oh man, this was the first time making this recipe.  I doubled the batch and used two cups of wheat flour and only one cup of white flour.  I also used half of the white sugar and these are AMAZING!!!

Very easy, and a great use of the applesauce in the freezer.  I don't like the chocolate chips in this, but that's my personal preference--and the preference of a coworker, who said she picked them out.  Another coworker, however, said she loved them as is so wanted the recipe.  These don't make that many, so if you have loads of applesauce you could easily double.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe as a jumping-off point for a batch of breakfast cookies, for those days I have to hit the ground running to get to work and don't have time to make a normal meal. Following the directions exactly (though using margarine instead of butter since I didn't have anything else on hand) I also added roughly 1.5C finely shredded carrots, a couple spoonfuls of jarred grated ginger (well drained), cut the chocolate chips (I used dark choc) down to 1/3C and added 1.5t of dark cocoa powder and a cap-full of almond extract. Next time I'll probably add some whey powder and some chopped nuts for extra protein. Cookies are moist and cake-y; one or two of these with a glass of juice or milk will make for an awesome breakfast - much more satisfying (and probably cheaper!) than buying a Clif Bar at the market. Thanks for your help, OP! :~)

Fantastic recipe. I love the fact that is uses a lot less butter than regular recipes, and it is nice and chewy. I followed some other peoples advice about the less sugar/salt. I only made half of this amount, and one egg white(instead of half a whole egg) worked out fine.

YUM!  this is my new favorite oatmeal cookie - and I've been making the old one for 10 years!  I did some doctoring, and will probably do a little more.. but this recipe makes an awesome cookie.  I found the dough to be too wet (more like a batter), so I added probably 1/3 cup more oats (old fashioned slow-cook) & a tad bit of flour.  I also don't like choc chips in my oatmeal cookies, so I used chinnamon chips in place of them.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and lessened the salt to 1/2.  I found the oven temp too high, so reduced it drastically (350ish), and just watched them close to make sure they didn't get too brown - seems like 13 minutes was just about right.  THANK YOU for this one!  I'll be making them a lot!

These were excellent! I followed the recipe except I used 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup. The second batch I left in the oven for 12 minutes until they were a bit more puffy and that was better. A good recipe, satisfies a sweet tooth without being overly sweet.

these turned out great. because of the applesauce, they are very (very) moist and soft even a few days after baking. if you don't like an overwhelming sense of spice in your cookies, i would recommend cutting the cinnamon down to 1/2 tsp or reducing the nutmeg to maybe 1/4 tsp :)

My whole family loves these, what a great recipe! We use cranberries instead of raisins and replace the white sugar with honey. I also make a batch of these with no choc chips and give them to my dog! Today Im going to try making them with butterscotch chips and mini marshmallows just to switch things up.

I made these with my 4yr. old Grandaughter but first looked through the HELPFUL reviews as I always do. I didn't have chocolate chips or walnuts but I did add 1 cup extra of oatmeal, an extra 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon,added 1 Tbl. coconut oil to butter(for flavor) & 1/4 c. craisins.I mixed black & golden raisins & used freshly grated nutmeg( once you try fresh you never go back to store bought ground nutmeg).I didn't have time to chill all the  dough at once so I used a 2Tbl. cookie scoop and dropped them on my HEAVY weight cookie sheets and chilled them in the fridge for 8-10 min. each.This is the time it takes to bake the cookies but because ovens vary,I recommend you check them after 7-8 minutes.They didn't spread but puffed up and though bottoms were golden brown,the center was moist & chewy.YUM! Makes 4 1/2 dozen.Next time I am going to add a little crushed pineapple (with the juice mostly squeezed out).

Chewy oatmeal cookies! I substituted regular oats for quick and dark chocolate chips for semi-sweet. I added more nuts & chocolate to compensate for the raisins. The only thing that I would change is that this mix only makes 2 dozen instead of the 5 listed. The cookies would be extremely tiny and cook faster if you tried to make 5 dozen. As is making 2 dozen the cooking time was perfect.

I thought these cookies were okay. I guess I really don't care for chocolate chips in the oatmeal cookie but that is a personal taste. They are very moist, baked up nice, lots of flavors going on, easy to assemble and bake, but don't think I'll make them again.

Made the cookies first time exactly as written and they were delicious.  2nd time, I had about 3/4 of a cup of left over pumpkin puree and replaced the applesause with the pumpkin.  My grand daughter is on a bit of a butterscotch kick, so I used butterscotch chips with the pumpkin and they were really nice cookies.  I did find the cookies needed more like 12-14 mins to bake fully.

I baked these exactly as the recipe read, and I even baked them longer as one of the reviews listed. Mine came out mushy and too soft.  I didn't like the combination of chocolate and applesauce either. I am deleting this recipe from my box.

Theses are awesome cookies! I have tried them with milk chocolate and white chocolate and we have decided that they taste better with white chocolate. Instead if white sugar I used Xylitol which is good for teeth health.

Yum! These cookies were soooooo delicious and easy! I folllowed the recipe exactly except I omitted the walnuts due to an allergy in the family, and used white chocolate chps instead!

Yum!  I subbed in 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, but otherwise made as written.  The cookies are soft, and wanted to crumble when I took them off the pan ( we made HUGE cookies!) but stuck together once they cooled.  Each one was a very hearty snack. We soaked our raisins in lemonade for an hour, then drained them, before using them in the cookies.

Great Recipe. I unfortunately didn't have enough oats, but I just substituted with flour. I also added 1/4 tsp ground ginger and 1 tbsp vanilla. Super good. A little sweet for me personally, but the whole family loved it. I had to hid them to save some for Thanksgiving!

These are the best apple cookies. I scrapped my old recipe and took this one over. My 5 year old saw applesauce cookies on one of her shows and asked me to make some. she doesn't eat anything, but these she loves with no added raisins, nuts or chocolate chips.  Just straight applesauce cookies & they're great.  Some variations I've used include a simple nut & raisin mix you can get anywhere. Be creative with those last 3 ingredients... Enjoy!

Literally the tastiest cookies I’ve ever made. Changes: Instead of raisins, I chose to use Craisins and used cinnamon chips instead of chocolate chips. Increased cinnamon to 2 tsp. Baked to perfection at 13 minutes. Used 2TB scoop onto parchment covered pan. Crispy around the edges yet chewy and moist.

WONDERFUL just  as it is, (original recipe) or with various adaptations. I 've made this many ways, and it was 5 star every time.  The original is very buttery and just the right sweetness, I think.
 If you want to make this  vegan-- I substituted aquafaba for egg, and it turned out fine. 
Then I tried experimenting with the sweetener. I used some molasses, just a tablespoon or so, instead of the some of the brown sugar. 
That was ok, but nothing special.  I used grated apple, and cut out the white sugar. That was more healthy, but not as satisfying. 
BTW, I *always* soak the raisins first, in orange juice-it- makes them a little juicier.

There's a cute little bakery up the road from an office I had to travel to. They make these and they are delicious. I haven't quite gotten their version of these down yet but this recipe comes very close. I put in extra craisins and fewer chocolate chips this time and will do regular raisins next time.

I made these for a BBQ we had been invited to.  Everyone loved them so much and my kids begged me to make them again the next day.  I used gluten free flour and I only had strawberry applesauce so I used that.  I didn't put the nuts or raisins in.  I accidentally left the 1/2c of sugar out so I sprinkled about 1/8c of sugar on top and everyone thought they were perfectly sweet.

These cookies were very good! Since I like my cookies on the less sweet side, I used about 2/3 the amount of sugar called for (for both the brown and white sugar). I also used a mixture of sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and pecans (because that is what I had on hand) to substitute for the walnuts. The result was wonderful!

These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies that I have ever made!  Of course, I made some changes to the recipe.  I never use the original recipe when I get something off of the internet!  I always get ideas from the comments and then I create a newer recipe.  I preheated the oven to 350 and used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets.  I used 1 3/4 cup of instant oats, plus a little more (I didn't measure it, I just put it in),  1 1/2 c of flour (plus a little more, about 2 cups), 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1/4 of honey (instead of white sugar).  I mixed 1/2 cup of black raisins and 1/2 cup of golden raisins and I added about 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla with the egg and applesauce.  Use unsweetened applesauce or you probably will have too sweet of a cookie.  I omitted the chocolate chip cookies.  I do like them in this type of cookie, but I didn't want to use them this time.  I might try putting them in the next time I bake these.  
I put the cookies in for 10 min. and then another 2 min. and they came out great!  I made sure the cookies sat on a wire rack for 5 minutes before I took them off.  I had no problem with the cookies crumbling, like some of the comments that I read.  Maybe it was because I left the cookies on the sheet for 5 min.  Who knows!  
The cookies do come out tasting like a little cakey, but I love soft cookies compared to crunchy.  These cookies have a very good flavor with the alterations that I have done!  I have never sub

I am so impressed with these cookies. I did adjust a fair bit: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup sucanat; 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup Splenda, 1 extra egg yolk, 1/4 cup flax meal, 2 tbsp. rolled oats, and 2 tbsp maple syrup. Replaced the add-ins with 1/4 cup unsweetened coconut shredded, 1/2 cup mixed dried fruit chopped, and to a few added butterscotch chips. 48 cookies = about 80 calories each.
Based on reviews, I tried several different methods: chilling dough in fridge 30 minutes, chilling dough in freezer 30 minutes, baking right away on regular sheet or mini whoopie pie pan. I preferred the cookies that were baked right away. They didn't spread too much, but were a nice size with my medium cookie scoop. The whoopie pie pan ones were a bit thicker. The chilled dough didn't spread much at all and ended up smaller and more dome like. Texture seemed to be better with the unchilled dough. 
Right out of the oven, the edges were crisp with soft, chewy centers. They cool to be soft cookies. My co-workers loved them and so did my family.

These cookies are fabulous!  I wanted to make them so they would work for a breakfast cookie.  I made these adjustments: reduced oats to 1 1/2 C, 1/4 C butter + 4 oz cream cheese, 1/2 C chocolate chips, 1/2 C cran raisins, 1 scoop vanilla protein powder.

This recipe has very good flavor. Used 2 TBL molasses in place of the brown sugar, white sugar 1 3/4 cups. Used homemade applesauce so had to compensate with more flour/oatmeal. Had raisins and nuts but no other add-ins. I am not a big sweets eater, but these are for the Grands. I felt they likely were not sweet enough for the grandchildren, so needed to add more sugar. I striped them with icing.  Baked them at 375 degrees, then after outer part of cookie had browned but not inner part, turned the heat down to 325- 350 so they would not burn. These cookies spread out way too much the first time, I needed to add more oatmeal again. It may have been the cookie sheet we were using. Still tasted good. No matter what I did to it, it still tasted good. This recipe is pretty hard to mess up for me, a cookie baking beginner. Thanks for sharing. This is a great recipe! The grands will like them. Thanks again!

This is a great recipe. I however made some changes. I omitted the white sugar instead added 1/4 cup more brown sugar and 1tsp each vanilla and almond. I also added a ton of golden raisins and as much nuts I could get my hands on. Remember used Rolled Oats or Old Fashioned Quaker Oats not the quick cook or instant. Also about 2 minutes  after taking them from the oven I used a flat spatula to GENTLY ease the cookies off the sheet then I left them to cool completely before taking them out. Almost forgot, adjust baking time from 10 mins to 20. Always rotate and flip your baking sheet half way through baking.

These were good, but not the gooey I was hoping for. Gooey to me are flat, under cooked looking cookies. These were tender and puffy, cake like cookies. They were a little crumbly but I really liked the flavor. I would probably make them again, but with some tweeking. Thanks for the recipe.

These came out wonderful. I got almost all the way done with the recipe and found out I had no eggs. I just added a little extra applesauce and they were still perfect. Nice and dense but still fluffy. Thanks for sharing!

Substituted all nuts (2c) instead of the chips and rehydrated cranberries (1c) instead of raisins. Used silpats and baked on convection 9 minutes, cooled on racks. Good, soft, chewy cookie.

We loved this recipe. We added chopped pecans and substituted Crasins for the rasins used fresh grated nutmeg. The cookies were very moist and flavorful. My 10 year old grandaughter Isabella was the baker.

Fantastic recipe! I was so excited to make these...then saw that our applesauce was moldy :O( so, I used some leftover pumpkin puree from pumpkin bread! The cookies are in the oven, and they look beautiful. I don't like cookies that spread, and this recipe has the perfect amount of binder- plus, less butter always helps. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great cookie recipe. I don`t use nuts and chocolate, only raisins and used just 1/2 cup brown sugar which was plenty for me. The cookies are so delicious. I will definitely make these cookies again.

NO Butter, NO egg, and awesome!!!  I went to make these cookies for the first time and realized I didn't have any butter or eggs!   Here is what I added: 1/2 honey, 1/2 lard, 1/4 (extra) applesauce, 1tsp apple-cider vinegar.   I left out: white sugar, 1/2c brown sugar, butter, egg.  If needed - play with a little extra flour or applesauce to get a slightly sticky cookie dough. Turned out amazing!!!

These Cookies ARE delicious, They smell just like a gingerbread cookie. I know some people think that they are a healthy alternative but don't fool yourself,  It's still a lot of sugar. I did not add the raisins or the chocolate chips. I used unsweetened applesauce. I did add a little bit of finely chopped apples and super finely chopped walnuts to disguise within the chewy oatmeal for my son. I also added some vanilla. They are quite chewy and soft  the next day and smell SOOO good. yum.. I will definitely keep this recipe

I used old fashioned oats and the cookies turned out great.  Perhaps chewier than using quick cooking oats, but I thought that is a good thing.  I used extra raisins as I don't like chocolate or nuts in oatmeal cookies.  It is a good way to use up apples after fall apple picking.  Yum.

These are fantastic! I baked them for 12 minutes, but I make larger cookies.(this recipe made 46 cookies).  I added 1/4 cup extra of oats and flour. They turned out perfect! I also omitted choc chips this time, and the raisins and nuts were enough.

Holy Batman these are GREAT cookies! I used the recipe exactly how it said and the cookies came out chewy/ cake like just what I was hoping for. I was worried the applesause would thin the batter and make the cookies too hard and brittle...not at all the case. Also, I accidently left one batch in a little too long and they still came out perfect! You'd have to be trying really hard to mess up this recipe.

Cookies were ok. I added 1/3 c more oats  and 1/4 c more flour like suggested in comments. They turned out cake-y for me and a little dry. Maybe I added too much flour? They're good dipped in a glass of milk and that's about it.

I made these cookies without nuts, chocolate chips, or rasins and they were so wonderful and simple.  I didnt use nutmeg but added a good amount more of cinnamon.  I used granny smith applesauce.  So soft and a perfect sweet taste!

I am giving this a 4 1/2 star. The only reason being, I am not a big raisen fan, so I sub craisens, I would prefer either or, not both. My hubby agreed, he would of preferred only choc chips. A very good cookie and I love that it has applesauce. Thanks
