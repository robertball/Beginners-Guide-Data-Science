This is my 2nd time making this and I finally decided to rate it. The one thing everyone must do that is not included in the recipe is to fully cook the potatoes before baking them in the casserole.  The 1st time I did not even cook them at all and the 2nd almost halfway and I still had raw potatoes.  I microwaved them the rest of the way to save time.  If cooked properly this recipe has a full rich flavor and is very filling as a main vegetarian dish. I am going to make for the third time with fully cooked potatoes.

I give it 5 stars with the right modifications.  Boiling the potatoes for a few minutes is a must.  I used one can cream of broccoli and one can cream of mushroom.  I also added 2 cloves minced garlic and 1 small chopped onion.  Instead of saltine crackers, I mixed half a box of Stove Top stuffing with some melted butter and used that for the crunchy topping.
The final, modified result was DELICIOUS!

This was good but it actually took over two hours to bake.  Next I make this, I will boil the potatoes slightly first.

I've made this recipe twice and really enjoy it. No, it's not gourmet fare, but not everything has to be.  I've found that this works best for me: Peel 3 pounds potatoes and cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes. Boil for 8 minutes and then add a whole bag of frozen broccoli.  Cook for a minute or so until the broccoli has thawed.  Drain and return to the pot.  In a bowl, stir together 1 can condensed cheddar cheese soup, 1 can cream of broccoli cheese soup, 1 C light or fat free sour cream, 1 t mustard, 1 t garlic powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Carefully stir the soup mixture into the potatoes and broccoli, making sure not to turn it into mashed potatoes! Spoon into a greased baking dish and bake at 325 for  20-30 minutes. I skip the cheddar cheese since the sauce already has cheese and we don't care for cracker crumbs so I leave them out.  Hope this helps someone!

I, too, cooked the broccoli and potatoes first, and used cream of mushroom soup instead of cr. of broccoli.  I substituted non-fat sour cream,which worked fine.  I also used Monterey Jack cheese along with the cheddar. This was a delicious meal which I will make again for sure!

This recipe is very tasty but the potatoes must be baked before you put them in the casserole or they will still be raw after the 45 minutes of baking. I also suggest putting the temperature up to 350-375.

I didn't read the reviews first.  I should have.  It cooked for over an hour and was still just not quite done.  I personally didn't care for it.  Too starchy, but the family came back for thirds.

The end result was pretty good, but it did take almost 2 hours to cook and I even cut the potatoes small.  Maybe precook (boil) the potatoes for at least 10 minutes first?  That's what I will do next time.

Completely boiling the potatoes ahead of time is a MUST. Other than that, this recipe is delicious!

Excellent with a few changes, I used cream of chicken soup and added chopped chicken to make it a whole meal. I also added chopped onions and some garlic for flavor. Yum!!

Really good recipe with a few additions/changes. As others have said... boiling the potatoes fully is a requirement. I simultaneously steamed the broccoli until crisp tender. Additionally, instead of saltines, I toasted some farmstyle bread slices VERY lightly, ripped them into crude croutons, melted two sticks of butter, and lightly drizzled this over the croutons. Also, as someone else suggested, I used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of broccoli, as well as a small diced onion and two crushed cloves of garlic. The end result was great!  I will make this again.

This was really good.  I only used 3 potatoes and only 1 can cream of mushroom soup. I pre-cooked the potatoes & broccoli and still cooked for about 50 minutes.  I served with meatloaf.

As everyone says, if potatoes aren't cooked, this takes @ least 2 hours. The second time I made it, I microwaved potatoes 15-20 mins while I got everything else together & it still wasn't done in 1.5 hours. It is really good, though, & I'm thinking that next time, I may try a bag of frzn south-style hashbrowns.

This made a large batch. I would cut this recipe in 1/2 unless you plan on feeding an army. I baked it almost 2 hr and was just barly done. We thought that it was just to over whelming with the broccoli soup. I think I might try it using a can of cream of celery or mushroom .

I used a bag of frozen (defrost before mixing ingredients) hash brown potatoes (cubed style) - which was MUCH easier than what the recipe called for. I think the whole bag is too much, so use your judgement. I also added more cheese on top when the casserole was almost done cooking (it took only about an hour and 10 minutes to cook). I thought it was very tastey, and will experiment with different ingredients. I wasn't thrilled with the Saltines, so I will try a butter/stuffing mixture or french fried onions next time.

Ran out of rice at my house on Thanksgiving so I decided to give this recipe a try. I got a lot of compliments on it although I felt it was just thick brocccoli cheese soup. If you like broccoli cheese soup you are sure to like this casserole. Defintley worth a try.

I boiled my potatoes first just enough to soften them up.  I did not steam the broccoli as others who wrote reviews did, but I poured the boiling water from the potatoes over the broccoli and it worked just as well with less effort.  Not having any saltines on hand,I used herbed stuffing mix to top, this was not bad but I think I will use french fried onions next time.  Over all this was an excellent recipe!

This was really good.  I just tweaked a few things.  First of all, I did boil the potatoes and broccoli (until done) before mixing everything together.  I only added one can of broccoli soup, so when it was all done the sour cream and cheese flavors were stronger.  The only thing I would change next time is to add onions.

This casserole is tasty, however, the first time I made it the potatoes and brocoli were too hard.  So, ever since I just steam the brocoli for a few minutes and boil the potatoes for a while and it's great!

So yummy! I read the reviews before I made this and I followed some suggestions. Instead of two cans of broccoli soup I added one can of mushroom and one can of broccoli cheese soup. I also added onions which made it so delicious!

This recipe was all right, definitely one of the better broccoli casseroles I've made. Following the suggestions of one of the other raters, I boiled the potatoes for about 10 minutes, throwing the broccoli in for the last 2 minutes or so. I then included 2 cloves of garlic and one small onion in the sauce and then used a full box of Stove Top stuffing mixed with 1/4 cup melted cube butter for the topping instead of the saltines. I also then substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup for the sour cream since I'm not a big fan. Next time, I would avoid using the cream of broccoli altogether, using just cream of mushroom, and would instead just double the amount of fresh broccoli.

Good recipe.  We really liked the mixture of the potato and broccoli.  After reading other reviews, I sliced the potatoes rather than cutting in cubes. The cook time was right on.  I really appreciated the calcuate button for this recipe as it made a lot.  Two friends stopped over while I was putting this together and both wanted the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This was a good recipe! A really nice warm recipe for winter. The sauce sort of makes a gravy. I used 1 can broccoli and one can cream of celery soup because that's what I had on hand. I also substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and used multigrain saltines. Very pleasing dish. Nothing bad to say about it, just a good recipe.

I Was looking for a recipe to use up my broccoli & cauliflower & used this recipe for a base.  Sauteed 3 greeen onions, a little minced garlic  and carrots added 3 cans crm ckn soup, 1/2 can low sodium ckn broth & 3 bay leaves.  Let that simmer for a while until I liked the flavor & then added broccoli & cauliflower.when they were cooked I slowly added 8 oz pepperjack cheese stirring constantly until melted.  I also had leftover rotisserie ckn in  fridge so I added  that & some leftover cooked egg noodles.  Left that simmer for a few minutes until warm.  Served with crusty bread. DELISH!  I know I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but has I said at the start.  "This recipe is a great base for what ever you have on hand in the fridge." Good way to get the kids to eat veggies.  Grandson, 7yrs old ate 2 bowls.

You definitely need to cook spuds first. I used 4 huge spuds instead of 6, French's crushed onion rings instead of saltines, low sodium cream of mushroom soup. Family loved it!

I have made this receipe twice now with the following changes:  I pre-cook the potatoes I substitute one can each of broccoli cheese and cream of chicken soup. I add chopped onion  This time I was making it for a Christmas party, so I made it with skin-on red potatoes. It was a pretty red and green dish and I received lots of compliments. The best compliment, however, was coming home with a nearly empty dish!

Didn't care for it according to the recipe. If I make it again, I would double everything except the potatoes and make sure the potatoes are cubed to be very tiny.

Very good recipe.  I followed the suggestions of many others in that I pre-cooked the potatoes and frozen broccoli I used.  I topped this with a breadcrumb and cheese mixture verses salted crackers.  It cooked in 45 minutes and was very good.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Made this for dinner lastnight. Did as suggested by others and cooked the potatoes first. I also used cream of mushroom soup sense I did not have any cream of broccoli on hand. I topped it with crushed ritzs crackers instead  of the saltines and little dabs of butter, baked it at 375 for one hour. 
Served with a tossed green salad and crescent rolls. Everyone enjoyed it except for the 9 year old who doesn't care for broccoli. When asked t rate it my eldest gave it a 4 and my husband started with a 3 star but changed his mind and gave it a 4 in the end. 
Will make again and will think of other things to add to dish.

Yum Yum! This was delicious! I did take a few suggestions and altered it a little. I cooked the potatoes first, which made my casserole cook faster, in about 35 minutes. I also added some garlic, onions, and used one can of cheddar cheese soup. It was super cheesy, and I wish it would have been a little less soupy. But I will definitely make this again.

I followed everyone's advice, and boiled these potatoes until almost cooked before baking the casserole.  It took about 45 minutes to get bubbly after that.  I wasn't sure what size to cut the potatoes, but if I make this again I will cut them into small cubes, instead of large ones like I did.  I also used stuffing mix as the crumb topping and that was tasty!  Overall, not a very exciting recipe, but it tasted good, and my vegetarian mom enjoyed it as her entree.

This makes a huge caserole. I left the peels on the potatoes and used a can each of cream of mushroom and cream of celery instead of the cream of broccoli. This recipe needs some salt too. I also boiled the potatoes until they were almost done. I topped it off with some dry "stovetop stuffing" mixed with some butter. Much better than using saltines.

I wish I would of read the reviews before cooking. I didn't cook the potatoes first and it took about an hour and 45 mins to finish. Next time I'll cook the potatoes first and add more broccoli.

I found out the hard way that you must cook the potatoes first before putting in the casserole. I cooked mine an extra 30 minutes and some of the potatoes were still not done. 
However, the overall taste of the casserole was great! I plan to make it again but first cook the potatoes.

This was pretty good. I agree with some other reviewers that the broccoli is almost too overwhelming. I would find the smallest head of broccoli possible for this recipe. Mine took about an hour to cook at 5,500 feet altitude. I nuked the potatoes for 6 minutes per side before putting them in the casserole and I didn't pre-cook the broccoli at all.

This recipe was very good.  I used two large potatoes instead and also used corn flakes on top instead of crackers.  This dish took nearly two hours to make though.

I'm a vegan and had mini potatoes and broccoli to use up i made the following substitutions and and currently enjoying this incredible meal as I write this...
for the "sauce" I used vegan mayo and the Dijon mustard, I also added some crushed garlic.
I also boiled the potatoes first.  then I mixed one chopped onion with the broccoli and boiled potatoes added the sauce and placed in a greased pan then topped with panko bread crumbs.  I added shredded vegan cheeze during the last 5 minutes of baking which was around 45 minutes 
I will make this again!

Loved it! Did follow what many of the reviews had said and boiled the diced potatoes for 7 minutes before adding to mixture. (I left the skin on for half of the potatoes.)  I added one cream of mushroom soup and one broccoli.  I also added two cloves of garlic and a small onion. I baked it at 350 degrees for 50 minutes and it was perfect!

Delicious! Cooked the potatoes and broccoli for a couple of minutes, and in stead of cream of broccoli soup -which I didn't have - I used 1 can of broccoli cheese soup and 1 can of skim milk. In stead of crushed saltine crackers I used panko bread crumbs. Very good and fast and easy to make.

I am trying this for the first time. After seeing the reviews I microwaved the cubed potatoes( 3 medium sized) for 4 mins. before mixing. I used 1 can of cr of mushroom soup. I adjusted the cheese to 1-1/2 cups and sprinkled some on top. I also added 1/2 lb of kielbasa halved and sliced to the recipe. It is in the oven and baking right now.  Hoping it will turn out good.

This was ok. I did boil the potatoes for 15 minutes. With the left overs I made potato, cheese and broccoli soup by adding chicken broth to thick or thinness, half and half creamer, salt and pepper to taste. This was good!

I wish I would have read the reviews on this before cooking! Yes, you certainly are right about those potatoes not cooking at this temperature. I would love to think of the right temperature to cook them fully while not over-cooking the broccoli. For what it is worth, I cooked this for two hours at 325, then 15 minutes at 425 and it was still out of this world as far as flavor goes. I used mozerella cheese, FYI, and it is delicious; though I can see why cheddar would be good as well.

READ THIS FIRST:  Okay, first of all, has the owner of this recipe not realized that they left out a VERY important step?  I put this together and then cooked it for an hour and then realized it wasn't cooked at all.  Then looked a the reviews and realized I was supposed to cook the potatoes first.  According to the other FIFTY reviews.

My boyfriend loves this recipe! I substitute with cream of mushroom soup and instead of crackers, I top with the French's Fried Onions. Cooking the potatoes first is a must as others have stated. This is a yummy cold-weather splurge.

The flavor is a tad bland to me, but a nice enough side dish.  I would not personally choose to serve as a vegetarian main dish as suggested.

I used the suggestions of other users and it turned out pretty well.  Definitely cook the potatoes first, and next time instead of subbing a can of cream mushroom for broccoli soup, I will use two broccoli to keep the broc flavor in there, and add a can of sliced mushrooms.  Great recipe!  Way too much for two of us, though.

I fallowed the advice of other reviewers and pre-cooked the potatoes (a must). I also used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of broccoli and add frech fried onions in place of saltines. Over all it was ok.

I was disappointed.  It took nearly TWO HOURS for the potatoes be cooked.  I think the oven should be set at AT LEAST 350 degrees.

This has a good flavor, but not cooking the potatos adead of time is a mmistake - it takes too long for them to cook fully while the  other ingredients get baked.  I'll try it again with some of the other suggestions.

Very delicious recipe,but I did add more cheese and it was wonderful. It did not serve six, it barely served 4, that is the only downfall to this recipe.

The potatoes take way too long to cook.  I boiled them until they were somewhat cooked and it still took 2 hours to cook!  The flavor is just ok.

Very good, used Celery soup.  Took twice as long to bake though
