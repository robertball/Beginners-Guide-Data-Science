This sandwich is amazing. I didn't think a grilled cheese could be improved but I am mistaken. The cheese on the outside of the bread had an amazing crunch and a different almost smoked tasting flavor and crunch that offset the melted cheese inside. All I can say is wow, I might make another one!

This was an extra delish cheesy experience for the comfort food crew. Having the browned cheese with the gooey cheese and the buttery crispy bread, is the perfect meal for any time of the day, but use an especially non stick pan, and if not up the butter if you want the cheese to stay intact. We use all sorts of different cheese, like of course American, Swiss, Pepperocini cheese, Fresh Mozzarella, and the list continues. Sometimes we add fresh tomato, but season first with salt and pepper, or ham, or bacon. I especially like Baby Swiss with Dijon mustard, and crispy pickles chips.  Enjoy!

Made grilled cheese like this by accident once upon a time when I tried to over-stuff the sammy w/ cheese and half of it fell back out...it was delicious and now we make them like this on purpose :) delish! The crunch from the cheese on the outside is a wonderful contrast to the gooey inside - try it! Thank you Chef John for taking the time to share this.

I used sliced cheese instead of shredded in the middle and it still melted wonderfully. We also prefer potato bread so I used that. Overall much easier to make than anticipated. Perfect blend of crunchy and gooey to add to the already classic grilled cheese.

Thanks Chef John! I made this by accident for my daughter once and now we make grilled cheese like this all the time. I love your comment about the non-nutritional white bread. You can even get a little more un-nutrional and use a good ole American cheese slice in the middle. Cheddar on the outside all the way though! And I applaud you for sharing what others consider 'simple' recipes. There are people out there who have no idea how to cook and I think those of us who can (or in my case think I can) take it for granted.

Genius!  I never thought to add cheese to the outside so that the entire sandwich is browned cheese, bite after bite.  Previously, whenever I would make grilled cheese, I'd let some cheese hang off the edge of the sandwich to get browned and crisp and always saved that part for the last bite.  To the doubters watch the video - it really is the method that makes this sandwich sooo delicious.  Thanks, Chef!

No changes, just made it with 2 year old Balderson cheddar and it was fantastically good.  Very, very rich, so I never felt so wealthy.  To all my friends and enemies, go ahead make my day

Well, when time came to flip the sandwich I had to practically destroy it prying it off the pan.  The same thing happened again with the flip side.  It tasted fairly good, but it did not look like a sandwich when it was done - more like an orange pile.  I'm also not sure how I'll ever get all that crusty cheese off my cast iron skillet again.  Next time I'm going to try using my one-and-only frying pan that nothing ever sticks to, even though it's technically not a "skillet" as the instructions prescribe.

the only thing i can't understand is why ppl put the butter in the pan. its so much easier to just butter the outside of the bread. its evenly distributed. no chance of getting wet greasy bread or it coming out uneven. I've never seen ppl make grilled cheese any other way till i started reading recipes online. maybe its just the way we do it in Canada. but other then that this is how i like my grilled cheese..but i also like to sometimes ad a slice of processed cheese along with the sharp cheddar just to get that gooey centre. the sharp cheddar for taste the the processed sliced cheese for texture.

I've made this sandwich for many years now. It started out using a rye bread with air holes in it, the cheese melted out by accident, which led to adding some cheese on the outside.

I had no idea a grilled cheese could be so good! I tried to cut down on the butter, but it didn't cover the bread. It's worth every calorie.

I made this for a quick lunch with some leftover thick sliced bread and sharp cheddar. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the toasted exterior cheese but it was pretty good!

Couldn't be easier or more tasteful!  I've made it a number of times (always paired with cream of tomato soup).  The cheese on the outside of the bread gives the sandwich a wonderful crunchy/cheesy taste.

Absolutely the best grilled cheese sandwiches! I have made this at least four times and my family loves it! I put two slices of Co-Jack cheese on the inside and use the grated cheddar for the outside. This is great with cream of tomato soup (with a little sugar added to the soup). I would show  a photo, but we ate them too fast!

I loved this!!!!  I did brush a tiny bit of mustard on the inside under the cheese.  The best part was putting a bit of the shredded cheese on the bottom then to top and flipping it, it created a nice crunchy seal!  For the person who said they had a big clumpy mess in their cast iron pan....well, the recipe does say use a non-stick pan.

My only problem was flipping the sandwich. I used a cast iron skillet with 70+ years of seasoning, but some of the cheese on the outside still stuck. Maybe I was turning too quickly? It's something I'll work on the next dozen times I make it.

I liked this!  I think it was pretty greasy though from the cheese on the outside, which I could have done without.  Still good though lol.  An interesting new way to have a grilled cheese!

Because Valentine's Day is quickly approaching I decided to cut my bread out into a heart shape. It didn't even take 10 minutes to make this sandwich either. While the sharp cheddar is a good choice, shaved parmesan would be incredible on the outside!

That taste of the cheese on the outsides was so good! Just a lot more of what you sometimes get a small taste of from cheese that seeped out of a sandwich and into the frying pan. Worth the little bit of extra effort. You really don't see something this on menus out there. Low heat and 3 minutes worked for me.

Best grilled cheese I've ever made! But, I only just now checked the calorie, fat, and sodium content - Oh, dear! Good thing they're filling enough to be a full meal! I was going to have one of these with a cup of Chef John's Tomato Bisque for dinner, but the sandwich proved to be quite enough! (The Bisque is satisfying enough to make a full meal, as well...)

Great grilled cheese. Easy. I didn't have white bread. I had very dense grainy salt topped bread from a local restaurant. It was still awesome. White bread would probably get more crispy but the crispy cheese on the outside was yummy. I'll make again trying different cheeses.

My husband and I liked it a lot.  I added a couple of  slices of smoked Virginia bacon to each of our  sandwiches, which elicited raves from him.  He's not easy to please and usually wouldn't opt for something as "pedestrian" as a grilled cheese sandwich.  A glass of red Zinfandel completed the "meal."  A repeat was ordered.

I made this just as the video instructed. I LOVE grilled cheese and the only thing that could make one better would be more cheese! Or so I thought. But I was not happy with the outcome. I found the end result to be tough. I know Chef John said to use soft white bread but maybe a heartier bread would work better. I'll never know because I will not make this again.

This was by far the best grill cheese sandwich EVER!!!  Takes just as much time to make as usual grill cheese but it is crunchy and because you use cheddar it is really delicious - thanks Chef John

Try doing this same thing but use butter mixed with shredded Parmesan for the bread.

Just finished making these and they were awesome.  I don't own a non stick skillet so I smeared a tiny bit of olive oil (using a paper towel) onto my warmed stainless steel pan then melted the butter ... using only medium heat on my electric glass top stove.  Followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.  Having made grilled cheese sandwiches for the last 48 years - this recipe proves you CAN teach old dogs new tricks!  Thanks Chef John for this recipe.

I made this sandwich for lunch yesterday, with my last two slices of white bread and it was delicious.  I bought more bread and plan on making another grilled cheese sandwich this afternoon, after I mow my lawn. Great sandwich! Yum!
