I'm the submitter, and just wanted to say how glad I am that everyone enjoys this recipe.  

One thing I use to mix the two is the magic bullet.  I bought one last year, and it works great on this recipe.  Of course, so does a good mixer on high speed.  It really fluffs it up.  

I, too, add vanilla, or cinnamon, or even cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also like adding small bits of dried fruit sometimes.  My family really loves that.  

Again, I'm so glad everyone enjoys this! 

*Edited to add: Some people say it's way too sweet. Others say it's nowhere near sweet enough.  This is personal taste.  To me, and to many of my friends, it's not very sweet at all.  In fact, my best friend who owns a bakery uses this recipe in her store, and she's decided she prefers almost equal amounts. 

If you aren't sure what you'll like, start with a stick of butter , whipped in a mixer, then start adding honey by the teaspoon until you like it.

I use 1/2 C. unsalted butter (1 stick) to 1/4 C. honey. Anything else and it's too sweet for me.
I would suggest adding honey by tablespoons and trying as you add more because people have different tastes. 
I also use an electric mixer to mix both ingredients until fluffy. 
Instead of waiting for the butter to get to room temperature, I microwave mine for about 30 seconds at 50% power until it's soft, but NOT melted. It won't work if melted.

Adds a wonderful sweetness to any breads. I re-used (nice, decorated ones) empty butter containers and put a festive label on. Wrapped in pretty nylon netting and bright ribbons and gave as a small hostess gift.

I love this and make it all the time. It's the perfect ratio of butter and honey. I don't add anything else, it's perfect for me as written.

Wow! This stuff is so good. It's amazing how two simple ingredients that you have around the kitchen can come together for something that tastes so delicious! You definitely have to use REAL butter, (not margarine) that's softened and you'll get great results. I used this on to top cornbread, but I can definitely see a lot of uses for this stuff.... Thanks for a great recipe!

This stuff is so expensive at the store and yet so easy to make.  I will never buy this again.  Tastes amazing with a cornbread recipe that I made from this site.  Thank you...needed this.

This is a good recipe, my family loves it! I added about 1-2 tbs. of Canola Oil to the mix, this way it is still soft when cold - easier for speading - and does not change the flavor. Yum...

I substituted margerine for butter as my son is lactose-sensitive and I also cut this recipe back to 4 servings. I did not try this myself but the kids thought it was wonderful on their crescent rolls this morning.

Excellent. I used unsalted butter and mixed in a bit of Kosher salt--nice balance of flavors. I might try whipping it next time for a fluffier texture.

The secret to success is having the butter soft, but not melted and whip it like you would egg whites or whipped cream.  I alter it to a more spreadable spread for my family:  1 cup butter, 1/2 cup canola oil (this is the same proportions as Land O' Lakes Spreadable Butter with Canola Oil) and 1/2 cup honey.  Another secret, if it is too hard to spread, plan ahead to leave it at room temperature, do not heat it.  If you like it sweeter, use more honey.

This recipe equals 1 Cup butter to 1/3 Cup honey. Delish! Good alone or add 1 tsp cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice for a twist. Good stuff!

This is just great!  I whipped mine, and it came out better than what you get at the restraunts!  I've played with this recipe, too, and have tried cinnamon in it.  I've also added slightly cooked apple chunks, and strawberry chunks, too!  It's delicious on bagels, toast, rolls, cornbread, oatmeal, or anything else like that! Everyone should try this!

Exactly what I was looking for. After spending the past couple of year vacationing on the beach in North Carolina and eating hush puppies with honey butter, I craved to find the recipe. Who knew how simple it was? Thanks Shannon!

I had honey butter at work (I work in a kitchen) and when I made popovers I knew honey butter was just what I wanted for them! I saw a few recipes for it, and picked this one. Glad I did, as it's just like the honey butter our head cook makes. The other recipes seemed to use a lot more honey, but this is plenty sweet, and the perfect compliment to wheaty breads, toast, English muffins, or popovers... or really just about any bread! My father loved maple butter on popovers (we're New Englanders, after all!), so I may try swapping that for the honey.

The first time I made this, I made it to recipe.  It was really, really good!  The second time I made this, I added a splash of vanilla.  Can I tell you how unbelievably awesome it is this way?  I'm eating it on a heated snow roll right now with a cup of tea.... heavenly!  I can't wait to have it on my sweet potato later on tonight!  THANK YOU for an incredibly easy tasty recipe!

Yep, this ratio is the way to go. All I had was salted butter and while I love salt, for company I will use the unsalted, maybe with a tiny pinch of salt if I'm missing it. However it was still good with salted, I'd still make even if that was all I had. Bravo!

Hmmm good!  I tried this recipe recently and couldn't stop eating it!  It's great on rye toast...or just about anything you put butter on.  The only additional ingredient I used was a tsp. of vanilla, it really brings out the flavor.  Other than that, ACW has the right ratio of honey to butter.    Thanks for sharing.

Excellent on fresh baked cornbread or blueberry muffins.. I just cant say how much I LOVE this stuff!
tip: If you save a old butter bin you can store it for a week in the fridge no problem.
thanks for the great recipe!!!

Wow! I was licking this off my fingers. Absolutely the combo of butter and honey is dead on! LOVED LOVED LOVED this. I found an easy way to make it by accident. I put the butter in the micro to soften it but accidentally almost melted it. I added the honey and mixed it up anyway (just used a fork) and put it in the freezer for about 15 minutes. Didn't look good but perfect spreading consistency.Oh, and add a splash of vanilla!

The only changes I made was to add a dash of cinnamon, a little more honey, and lemon zest. This was fantastic with popovers and sweet muffins (also from this site!).
Thanks for sharing!!!

Boy is this good!  I didn't have time to set the butter to room temperature so I put it in a measuring cup and placed it in the microwave on the lowest power setting.  I'll use again and again.  Thanks!!!

This recipe was great. I used this recipe for my home-made popovers and it was delicious! So simple, yet so good. I did, however, add a drop of vanilla.

3:1 honey-to-butter ratio has always been my preference. Sweet enough to taste the honey, but enough butter to really get that salty kick. Love it!

Oh my gosh this is so good.  I took another reviewers advice(thanks PERSONA)and put the butter in the microwave for 45 seconds on 50% power.  I whipped it with my KitchenAid stand mixer for about a minute and served it with Portuguese Sweet Bread I from this site.  I can't wait until tomorrow morning for another piece. Thanks so much Shannon!

I made this for my son who loves the one you get at the buffet restaraunt. He rated it five stars along with the rest of the family. I am going to double the recipe and put the butter in small canning jars and give it along with my homemade bread as Christmas gifts.

Thanks for the reminder of this simple combination. It brought back many fond memories of mixing honey and softened butter to put on biscuits or toast when we visited our grandparents - many decades ago. We just mixed it on our plates. I like the idea of making enough for a container of it. I'm going to try it with Smart Balance, and take that for "after the morning service" snacks with homemade bread one of these Sundays. That and coffee, tea, or juice is a good combination.

My family loved this recipe...I used a stick of salted butter and just eyeballed the honey until it became the right amt of sweetness that we liked. Place back in fridge and it was marvelous this morning on some hot biscuits.

I've made honey butter but usually just "eyeball" the amounts so this recipe is nice to have...I reduced the honey by 1 tbsp. and added 2 tbsp. of orange juice.  Yum!  And not too sweet.  Thanks Shannon, and, by the way, I love your name!

I often change it up by adding more honey, or cinnamon, or nutmeg, or even adding fruit. Just depending on what I'm using it for.

My Kids are too young/wild to use honey on top of buttered hot biscuits (LOL!!!) so I make honey butter. This is a really good mix. OHIOMOM1 has a good idea with beating it to make it fluffy. A little goes a long way. Try it on waffles with chopped walnuts or pecans or almonds. Kaye Lynn is spot on... kosher or sea salt will balance flavor but must use unsalted butter.

Very simple yet very good!  I used wire whisk to mix the butter and honey.  My butter wasn¡¯t quite room temperature and so in order to get it very smooth and combined well I had to really whisk it for few minutes.  But no complaints here; I got my arm workout done and it tasted great spread on hot corn muffins.  Thank you for the recipe!

The best way is the Irish way which is equal amounts; especially with Irish Soda Bread or flaky biscuits ;-)

Made this tonight to go with the honey bread that's baking in the oven. Super yummy! I have a sweet tooth so this is perfect for me. Using real butter is key to the creamy, taste only real butter gives. I added a 1/4 of honey tho. My fiancé isn't as much of a sweet eater, so, the 1/4 cup of honey was more than enough to satisfy us both. Thanx for sharing this!!

I normally am not a honey fan, but I made this to go along with a loaf of bread that I made for my husband. It was delicious! It was so good on the fresh bread and we couldn't get enough. I didnt' make the full batch but I used the 1-3 ratio and did 3Tbsp of room temp butter and 1 Tbsp of honey. Lets just say I had to make more by the time the meal was done! Delish! Thanks~

A nice touch - adds a little honey sweetness for your dinner rolls.  My daughter loved it.  I've never seen her eat so much bread at dinner.

Perfect balance of butter to honey.  Did cut the recipe back a little as there was only a few of us eating it.  Great for a change to regular butter on holiday rolls.

This is good on its own, but I recommend adding a little bit of cinnamon to kick it up a notch. Maybe even orange zest? I have done both and think it makes the butter taste better.  I keep some made up and in the refrigerator.

Very yummy.  This is a  favorite that my daughter and I make together.  I took some advice from other reviewers and added some vanilla.  and i added a sprinkling of salt (i use unsalted butter).  Thanks for sharing such a simple and tasty recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I added a bit more honey and vanilla extract. It tastes just like what they serve in one of our local restaurants.  I used my mixer to give it a whipped, smooth consistency.  I will be making this all the time..Thanks!

I give this 4 stars because it was good but not as light and creamy as I would have liked. Maybe I didn't let the butter soften for long enough but the honey just wouldn't fully mix in for some reason. Other than that though it really was good and very tasty on corn bread. I will be making it again but will try and get it to be creamier.

Maybe I did something wrong here because I didnt think this recipe warranted 5 stars. The butter was too sweet for my taste an di followed the recipe exactly. Hmmm. Different taste buds I guess

Real tasty and easy to make. It takes a while to blend the two ingredients together to consistency, but it is important.

You've gotta try this recipe. This honey butter is sooo yummy. I found the recipe when I was on the net sunday morning before we make our big sunday breakfast & whipped it up real quick. My husband loves it. I added just a bit of vanilla extract it was good but I think next time I will try a little bit of cinnamon.

I served this honey butter with the Grandma's Cornbread recipe also on this site; it was very tasty.  I spread some of this on the cornbread when it first came out of the oven so it soaked in before we served it.  Very good...I'll make both of them again.

I used unsalted butter and defrosted it for 45 seconds at 50% power.  Mixed the butter and honey on a high setting for 5 minutes with the KitchenAid stand mixer.  It came out just beautiful and lightly whipped.  Tasted great on pumpkin bread!

The taste was really good at first - just like the yummy honey butter I used to get at Ruby Tuesday's. When I refrigerated it, though, it seperated. It suddenly occured to me that I used margarine and not butter. Guess I wasn't really paying attention. Oops. I'll have to make this agian.

I made this to put on top of the Sweet Dinner Rolls recipe that I found on this website. I put some of this honey butter on them before I put them in the oven and after they came out! Absoultly wonderful with dinner!

Yum!  I served this with "Kay's Bread Machine Rolls."  The 4 of us ate almost all the rolls simply to have more of this delicious butter.  Will be making this again and again.  Watch out - it's addictive!

This is a perfect blend of buttery sweetness! I used room temperature butter (salted) and honey that I mixed up to suit my tastes. I chilled it for a while in the refrigerator until I was ready to spread it on the bread I was baking. I also used a little of this honey butter to butter the top of the, "Buttermilk Bread II," from this website, right before baking and after as a spread. This butter is so delicious generously slathered all over fresh hot bread!

yum! This was always on the dinner table when I was younger but with age I had forgotten all about it.  I thought of it the other day...had it tonight with dinner...and it was so delicious that I didn't even want the rest of my food.  Sit me down with a warm loaf of French bread and this butter and I'm a happy woman.

I wasn't very fond of this recipe. One star for trying and coming close. I could've made this recipe with just sugar. A waste of good honey.

Very easy and very tasty!!  I lowered the serving size to 2.  We used it for two meals...feeding three adults each meal (one for buttering biscuits/one for buttering pancakes) and we still have about half left...so this makes more than you think!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Like others have said, perfect balance of honey and butter, finally!  The Magic Bullet suggestion made this really easy.  I used stick margarine from the fridge and just softened/ warmed in the microwave for a few seconds before adding honey.  I brought this with Buttery Corn Bread from this site to a barbecue, and once the corn bread was gone, people put this on tortillas, scraping up every last bit in the bowl.

This was a little too sweet for me with the 3/4 c of butter so I uped it to 1 cup of butter and it was perfect for my taste. This was sooooo good on some nice warm take and bake bread I got for $1.00 at the grocery store.

This is basically the same recipe I use.  I am going to experiment this Christmas with using fresh cranberries, chopped in processor with sugar and chopped pecans and see what happens(added to honey butter)  I also go to the dollar store and pick up some glass candy dishes and fill a bunch with the honey butter for family and friends. It makes a nice Christmas gift and always gets compliments.(Make sure it goes to those who like honey!)

Yummy!  I've made this 3 times so far.  This last time I tried to make it from memory.  I used only a stick of butter (1/2 cup) and 1/4 cup honey.  Still very good, just sweeter.

Many thanks, Shannon! Very tasty recipe, just like the honey butter in our favorite restaurant! It's important to thoroughly mix the butter and the honey. We took the advice of other reviewers and added a touch of vanilla and cinnamon. Been looking for this recipe for some time. Perfect for the holidays on rolls, biscuits or corn muffins, or anytime!

You can adjust the amount of honey to your taste. I use zero trans-fat butter spread which tastes great and spreads easily!

This is a good recipe for honey butter. That being said, I make mine with 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of “Tupelo” honey. I was raised on Tupelo honey and it makes the absolute best honey butter in the world!

This was an awesome recipe! I'm definitely making this one again! I do suggest that you even out the butter a little, because this was a little too much for my liking. Other than that, it was perfect! It was a great, and sweet, breakfast spread. I tried this on toast and on biscuits and it tastes heavenly!  Wow, this is such a simple, yet great tasting recipe, that I suggest to all kids and adults.

I loved this. The only difference to the original is I added about 1/2 TBS heavy cream and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Turned out perfect.

Nice, simple way to make homemade honey butter. I used 1 stick of unsalted butter, 3 tbsp honey, and added 1 tsp almond extract (I would have used vanilla but I was out). I was able to mix it by hand with a wooden spoon. It came out great.

Excellent and Easy ! Just like the honey butter that goes with hush puppies at the beach - mmm ! :) The ONLY change I made was adding an additional tablespoon of butter, but of course it might not work for everyone since we all use different kinds of butter. I use Fleischmann's Olive oil butter. Great recipe though!

Had some honey that was turning to sugar, so I reheated it and cooled.  Added to room temp unsalted butter. YUMMY on pancakes, waffles, toast.

I liked this a lot - goes well on so many things - but I think I would like one of the recipes that have more honey, maybe a half and half ratio.  Either way, a nice, fancy touch for a brunch or even just to dress up your morning toast or English Muffin!

Thanks to all of you who share your great recipes with us.  I made this recipe twice, no not for 2 separate occassions.  I made the 1st lasagne on Wed night, oops too salty.  I used reg Italian sausage but other than that followed the recipe to the t.  Way too salty.  Threw it out and made another one.  This time I bought the sweet Italian sausage and omitted sugar and salt.  Came out great except for the lasagna noodles on top.  The were harder than chips.  Any advise on how to get them soft and not to "curl up".  Thank you.  BTW: guest loved it.  I bought left over containers so they could take with them, but there was none left 12 servings for 8 of us and they had salad prior to having the lasagne.

Thanks for posting this novel recipe! It is so easy to make and everyone is impressed when you serve it. I love throwing in pumpkin spice or cinnamon, depending on the food which it is accompanying. Hint: if you bake a dessert bread and afterwards find out the flavor is a bit "blah", adding the spice to the honey butter is a great coverup!

This was just ok for my husband and I.  We spread it on top of that wonderful, sweet wheat bread from the Cheesecake Factory.  I expected it to be like the honey butter that is in restaurants but it wasn't.  Maybe the honey I used was not good quality, it just didn't combine well at all for me.

I added a little cinnamon, but the flavor wasn't quite what I expected.  My three daughters LOVED it, but my husband and I weren't real excited about it.  I definitely wouldn't make it again without halving the recipe at least.  I didn't like it well enough to waste that much butter!

Wow!  Is just like a certain "buffet resturant"'s honey butter.  Inlaws were impressed!  Whip the ingredients until light and airy!

Whenever I go to Iowa my friends always have some in the fridge that they buy from a local farm. I never could find it anywhere else. It's amazing stuff!

And this recipe did it justice. Thanks!

How can you go wrong with a recipe that requires only two ingredients and no cooking?  I enjoyed this on a waffle and a piece of cinnamon raisin bread this morning.  Very tasty!

This is absolutely delicious when spread on Banana Banana Bread, which is also found here on Allrecipes. Try toasting the bread first. Delicious!
