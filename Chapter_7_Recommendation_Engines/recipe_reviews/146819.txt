I made these cookies for my son's school party and they were a great hit.  We added green food coloring to the dough and when I took them out of the oven I added a single chocolate chip for a wart.  We also added red gel food coloring for the severed end of the finger.  The cookies do enlarge when baked (almost double the thickness) so make sure you don't make them to round when you are rolling them out.  The cookie flavor was good on top of looking great, thanks for a fun recipe.

Great recipe!  Instead of using decorator gel, I dipped each almond in strawberry jam, and pressed them into the raw "finger" tip before baking... produced very gory results!

I have been making this dessert every year for my annual Halloween party for the last 10 yrs.  I don't use wax paper to shape the fingers, just my well-washed hands.  I then use a sharp knife to cut in the knuckles and finger lines, dipped in hot water between cuts.  Also, I add the red gel frosting to the base of the fingers as if they've been pulled out of their socket - gross!  That way, you don't have to mess with the almonds.  You can also add chocolate chips to them right after they come out of the oven to add flavor and "warts".  Lots of great feedback ever year, my guests now expect to see them!

I use the Canadian Living Cooks witch finger recipe (pretty much the same), but I thought I'd let you know that if you don't have red gel, I simply use raspberry jam (just a touch) and then put the almond "nail" on top to let the jam ooze out a bit.  It bakes just fine. And do make sure you let the dough chill, because one time I was impatient and they became very fat witch fingers!

This is a cool recipe. I am not a fan of sugar cookies so I rated it a little higher that I really thought it should be (flavor wise) other wise I would have given it a 5 because it is such a good idea. When making the fingers you have to make them SUPER thin. About the size of your pinky finger in width (unless you have "man-hands" or are a man. My first batch was more like monster fingers.

I LOVE THESE!! One person talked about warts, so I tried to make some. Another person made them green, I loved that idea. So I had to try, this is what mine turned out like. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. The mice are cake balls.

i have been making these treats for the past 10 years or so!  i saw martha stewart making them on her show - she called them "severed fingers" and use her recipe (recipe varies).
i just loved reading the reviews!  this halloween i will use this recipe and follow other member's advice and make them green and w/chocolate chip "warts"!
for the fingernails, i usually blanche the almonds - put in boiling water for 1 minute or so and then drain.  when slightly cooled you can pop off the almond skin.  when the blanched almonds are dry simply "paint" with red food coloring!  use beaten egg white to brush over entire finger and to stick the finger nail on.  hmmm - this just gave me an idea!  i think i'll paint designs on the nails w/food coloring pens!  thanks in advance for the new recipe and inspiration!

These are "grown-up" tasting cookies with a kid appearance....I sweetened them up with more sugar and frosting to both the fingernail and the bottom to make it red and bloody-looking. Sweet is the key with these cookies; if you follow the recipe, they are not that sweet. I loved them; so did my students.

These were fun and pretty good. We have someone allergic to nuts so we used hot tamales instead of almonds. It was cute and a big hit, esp with the kiddos

I would have given it five star but I was not crazy about the flavor. I loved the look how ever. I found the easyest way to make the shape was to roll them in your hand and slightly, very slightly squeez them. Loved the look of them green and love the warts. Just wished the taste was better

I too have been using this recipe for years. We always do the same thing every year and the kids love it. 1. Tint the dough before adding the dry ingredients. Easier to mix it in that way. Green is usually the preferred colour. Don't be afraid to play with the extract flavour. If you don't like almond extract then use something else.  2. Make sure to make them thin as someone stated. Otherwise you get huge fingers unless that's what you want. Then they become "ogre fingers" instead of witch.  3. Red gel under the nails and ends of the fingers makes for wonderful special effects. I usually use the tip of a potato peeler to hollow out the ends a bit before baking. When the cookies cool down I fill it with the red gel to give it a gory touch! Whole almonds make for thick nails and half the almond gives it a thinner look. You can even use almonds with their skins still on. The brown almond skin and ridges give it an older look. It's just another option depending on the look you want to achieve.  4. Use a knife to cut into the tops to make knuckles.  5. Once cool, I take black food colouring and dilute is ever so slightly and dry brush the nails to make them appear gray. Really adds to the fingers.  This is something the kids can help you make and it's lots of fun for them. Great idea for Halloween.

I substituted 3/4 cup granular sugar for the confectioners', which worked just fine. Secret to light shortbread is to whip the butter with sugar until light (NEVER melt the butter). Then beat in all the wet ingredients. Then fold in the sifted dry ingredients. I also recommend chilling the batter overnight. Like another reviewer, I recommend "gluing" the almonds on with a bit of strawberry or raspberry jam before baking. I dusted these with powdered sugar after cooling to give them a "musty, mildewy" look. Very effective.

Uncomplicated flavor and low sweetness quotient makes this recipe a winner for adults. Kids would probably prefer something sweeter. They're just a plain butter cookie with a sable texture. Of course, it's got creative impact up the yin-yang, too! I think I've figured out how to stop them from blowing up and out of shape. Cutting the baking powder in half, from 1 tsp to 1/2 tsp did the trick. I used red gel to simulate blood, and they made quite a splash. Guests were totally grossed out - my daughter could only eat them if she turned them upside down so she didn't have to see the "blood" and "warts" (little tiny balls of dough that I applied before baking.) Thank you!

This is what happens (see photo) if you don't follow directions. I decided to use slice & bake dough from the store. The dough spreads and will never hold a finger shape. Next time, I win.

These cookies looked so good, they were perfect for Halloween. Like others have said, a lot of my friends looked at them hesitantly because they looked so real. I also agree with some others that the taste was a little off. I found my batch to be just a tad too salty. If I make these again I will take others suggestions to add granulated sugar or will use my own family recipe for Christmas cookies which is similar but a little sweeter. Hands down these should be colored green, the red looks even more grotesque. I used red food gel for the blood, maybe the red jams others used would have balanced out the flavor?

These ended up being a lot of work, but they looked really gross (in a good way).  They taste good too, if you can manage to eat one. Before shaping them all, I did a trial run, and baked just a few, so that I could get the size and shape just right, becuase they do grow while baking.

These cookies were fantastic for our sons' daycare Halloween party.  All the children and the staff loved them and there were no leftovers come pick-up time.  I skipped the red food coloring and went with raspberry jam to hold the "nails" on.  The two cautions I will offer, as some other reviewers did, is 1) that you have to roll out the fingers SMALL and THIN or you'll get monster fingers--a raw cookie the length and thickness of your pinky will be the size of your middle finger upon baking--and 2) the salt is better left out, or you'll also get monster fingers.  They will rise just fine, look and taste perfect without the salt.

I made this as Halloween treats for my sons at school and it got great review from teachers as well.  I made it as it was written the first time, but the kids seemed to be put off by the almond extract (the grown-ups liked it just fine).  So the second year I only added vanilla extract and used food coloring to make the dough green and almond slices dip in strawberry jam as fingernails and baked.  It was gone in few minutes this time:)

Tasty & awesomely realistic-looking, if you use PEANUT halves as the ugly nails, & take the time to form the fingers properly. That means make them into many shapes, including gnarled, arthritic, & - importantly - make the knuckle's wrinkles with a very small curved spoon instead of a knife's straight markings. (See my photo, the 83rd photo). Make them with variations, as is natural in humans.  I used an Iranian cherry jam's liquid, which was mixed with cornstarch & heated to a sticky candy level - perfect for the look of of oxidized blood! The fingers looked fantastic without any deep red "blood", & were effective whether the blood was under the nails &/or at the cut-off part. Thanks Sandra, for a memorable "treat"!

This was such a hit!  They actually looked just like witches fingers!  I added an additional 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar and kneaded in some green dye, and they were spooky and delicious.  Very very good with coffee the next morning!  Not too sweet, just a perfect little bite.  They definitely take some time to do well, but it's so worth it!

5* for idea, 3* for recipe.  While the cookie does taste good it just spreads way too much during baking.  For my second try I used a spritz cookie recipe with much better results (no baking powder and no egg white).

These were a hit for food day at work!  I love Spritz cookies to begin with, so I knew what they would taste like.  These are subtle cookies - you could use 2 tsp of almond for a stronger almond taste instead of using almond and vanilla.  I didn't want to go through extra work to remove and replace the almonds, so I used a cherry-strawberry jam and dipped the almond in that first and placed it in the formed finger so it baked right on.  (I'm photo 129)  This worked great to make it a little gory looking, plus added a little flavor.  (I didn't want them to taste artificial or like red dye.  They were all gone at the end of the day.  The recipe makes a lot - I probably had 5-6 dozen.  I also followed some of the other reviews and added a mini chocolate chip after they came out of the oven.  Definitely form them thin - no thicker than the size of a pinky....otherwize they'll be too fat.

These turned out fabulously for me. I did make some changes to the recipe though. I halved the salt and baking powder and added half a cup of granulated sugar. I found that 12 minutes was exactly enough time for baking also. I experimented a bit with different flavors of preserves to hold on the "nails" which were slivered almonds not whole. Mine did not rise to ogre fingers as many of the other reviews- perhaps it was the reduction in the baking soda- and the only time the dough was really able to warm was while I was handling it, otherwise it sat in a steel bowl inside another bowl with SOME ice water to keep it cool, and then when they were formed my cookie sheet sat on an ice pack. The fingers came out perfectly And actually tasted very good. I imagine I'll be making these again next year, and will probably re-use the modified version of the recipe throughout the year.

I do not know if anyone else had said this already, so I'm sorry if someone has! When I've made these cookies in the past, I have used pumpkin seeds for the nails.

some lemon zest really goes a long way in enhancing the flavor of these cookies! i doubled the recipe and used zest of three lemons. added a 1/2 tsp more salt.  raspberry jam for blood is a perfect compliment to the almond/lemon flavor.

These were so very cute and easy to make.  I used sliced almonds for the nails and sort of slid them into the dough a bit.  I also tinted the dough green.  I did NOT grease the pan, I prefer to use silicon baking liners.  When I took them out of the oven I immediately removed the almond slices, added a squeeze of red gel and replaced the almosn slice "nail".   I arranged them on a platter lined with easter basket grass.  In addition I dipped pretzel logs in melted white chocolate and called them "dead mans bones" and placed those on the same platter.  Next time I am planning on trying a strawberry jelly dot or raspberry under the almond.

I made these for the first time last Halloween, sent them to college students and they loved them!  They told me they were the cutest things they had ever seen.  Taste of the cookie was a 4 but the appearance a 10!  I sliced mine down the middle and added some red gel to the inside then pinced it together and when you bite into them it looks like blood inside.  I used sliced almonds for the fingernails and added small "cracks" with a knife for the knuckles.

These were a huge hit at a Halloween party. I used 1/8th teaspoon green food coloring - don't use any more than that. It took awhile to figure out what size to make each cookie, but finally determined that just a little smaller than actual finger size worked well. It was a little difficult to get the joints right since often squeezing the middle didn't work quite right. However, the end result was great. Use a very sharp knife for the wrinkles in the joints and vary the length. That made the most difference in creating a realistic finger. I used whole almonds and they worked great. I used chocolate morsels for "warts." I found it easier to add those before baking. Don't make your cookies too thin - they'll crack. Great idea!!!!!

These are really fun. I did add green food coloring to the dough. I took a heaping teaspoon of dough and rolled it out by hand on waxed paper. I then cut the rope in two, getting two small cookies. These do "fatten up" as they cook. I also found out that if you pull a little dough up around the edges of the almond, the almond will not come off after cooling. No need to dip a small paring knife in hot water to make the "knuckle" indentations. Red gel can still be put around the "cuticle" area. I know these will be a hit at a Halloween fundraising bake sale!

Used green food dye and added the warts.  They were a major hit.  Next time I will use blanched almonds for a more realistic nail look.  Cookie flavor was good but not great.  Probably could do with any butter cookie recipe.

These cookies are fun and tasty. However even after leaving the dough overnight I couldn't get it firm enough to roll into the finger shapes. I ended up putting the semi firm dough in a piping bag and piping out the finger shapes. Which I thought turned out great as just by changing the pressure on the bag I could make knuckles and give the cookies a more finger like shape.

Excellent!  I made these for a camping trip.  We were sitting around the campfire telling ghost stories.  When I was my turn I talked about "The Witch Of The Canyon" that grabs small children.  But don't worry, because I took her fingers off!

Fun, Fun, Fun!  (But, TIME CONSUMING!)  Added a half cup of granulated sugar (for more kid-friendly taste), used half Butter and half Butter Flavor Crisco, SLICED almonds (better aesthetic), and tossed in some green food color.

I made these last year and this year and I think they are awesome to see as well as eat; I should know as I ate most of them and had to make more.  I used blanched almond slices and put them on before going in oven and used some of the broken ones to look like broken nails and when came out of oven they looked like old yucky nails with a little red gel around edges to look as if were bleeding around them. Thank you; this is a good recipe for any holiday; just shape differently.

This might be a false rating since I didn't actually use the recipe. I used my own sugar cookie dough to make the fingers, and use jelly beans for nails, and people LOVED them. I wanted to be able to give credit where it's due since the creativity was appreciated by all! Thank you for this idea! (p.s. I realize this is a few months late, I made them for halloween, not chrsitmas! lol)

Okay, so these are the tricks you must follow to get an easy and guarateed "finger" look:  I used green dye for witch fingers, added about 1/2 cup more of flour, refrigerate dough overnight, when rolling the fingers make sure to make them really really thin because they spread out when you're cooking them, use butterknife to make knuckle slits, use raisins for nails and pinch one side of the raisin and set into the tip of the dough, bake at 365 to cook quickly and not brown the cookies.  This will make the best looking witchy fingers and they taste great and it's so much easier to use the raisins!!  Everyone thought I bought them at the store!!  Tee Hee...

Very good cookie recipe however you need to leave the leavening out so they don;t spread. Then they are more like a shortbread. Very good.
Have made these several times and you can leave thebaking powder in. Tinted them green last time and they were sooo cute. However, you do need some gel or some other adhesive to keep the fingernails from falling off after baking. Very tasty cookie too.

These were great and the recommendation to add jam at one end and under the nail before baking were on point.  They were a hit at both my children's Halloween parties.

These cookies are really cute and they do hold their shape well.  However other than that they really aren't that great.  The almond extract does add a nice flavor but there is way to much salt and that is all I could taste in the cookie.  They are also a bit dry tasting but I'm not sure how you could fix that and make the cookies still hold their shape.

I followed some of the recommendations and added coloring to make them a green/pistachio color.  I also added a miniature chocolate chip to look like a wart.  (I uploaded my picture.)  The cookies weren't as sweet as I would have liked, they are actually a bit on the salty side even though I always use unsalted butter so that was surprising.  I noticed that the longer the dough was refriferated, the easier it was to manipulate.  They looked really awesome after baking and just being low on calories earned it 4 stars for me!!!

My husband and I had a blast making these for the neighborhood Halloween block party. They were a hit! And SO delicious! I will be looking for something else to make with this recipe. For our fingers, we added a chocolate chip to the stub end of each cookie. We also found that removing the almond after baking then reapplying it with the red gel worked best. This is definitely a keeper!!!!

I made these for work for tomorrow and they are sooo dang dang cute!  I put in a bit of green food coloring and used sliced almonds instead of whole ones ($$$).  They really do make a LOT of fingers but so worth it.  I cooled the cookie sheet down in between each baking and they were perfect at 20 minutes.  I love the shortbread texture, so will be making these again.  Ohhh.. instead of butter I used all butter flavored Crisco.  Very yummy!

Made the recipe exactly as shown EXCEPT I only used 1/2 tsp salt.  I could probably cut that back to 1/4 tsp since my butter is salted. Read other recipes about fingers puffing up too much and to not use a leavening agent.  I rolled my fingers to 1/2" and what puffing they did was perfect.   I made the cookie dough the night before...then made my fingers and put them in the fridge, turned my oven on and when it was ready took my fingers out of the fridge and put them on the cookie sheet to bake.   To make them look as realistic as possible I rolled them to about 1/2" wide shaped the knuckles and  used a toothpick to indent knuckle wrinkles, then scratched a few wrinkles in between so it looked like skin vs smooth cookie.  The other end I stuck my finger in it so it looked like it is the end of a finger vs a rolled out cookie. Made about 36 fingers. Pretty flakey, good.  If you like it sweet, make some colored frosting or have melted chocolate available to dip. This recipe served it's purpose well! Almost forgot!  I got the "formula" for flesh color from Yahoo.   8 drops yellow, 6 drops red, 2 drops green.  I added it to the dough until it became flesh color.

I altered the recipe by adding about 1/4 more powdered sugar after reading other reviews...NOTE-when they say make SKINNY fingers, they mean SKINNY.  The first batch we rolled was about the size of our fingers and they turned out HUGE!!!! We loved tasting them though...The second 'skinnier' batch is in the oven...I will keep you posted.  They sure are fun to make!!!!

I've used this recipe many times and it's great! The one thing i do is paint the nails (your choice of color) before the cookies are baked. This will help if someone has a allegie to nuts. I Use melted white chocolate coating and tint it red. After the cookies are completely cooled. Dip the ends to look like blood (shake a bit to look like the blood is running

Delicious cookie with or without the almond extract.  Careful, the recipe makes lots of fingers.  Definitely dye it green, and the decorators gel can go on the cookie before baking.  Thanks for a great idea.

Very cute  idea and easy to make.  They were very well received.  Sadly, they are tasteless and bland.  They are almost a shortbread cookie but less sweet.  My advice is to add more sugar otherwise it will taste like a flour cookie.

This recipe TASTED pretty good, but it LOOKED especially great, and was actually quite simple!!  I did modify a little bit, however I followed the recipe's ingredients to a T.....1.) Added the green food coloring, which worked out fantastically. 2.) I also added warts to the fingers, however I did this by just rolling up itty-bitty pieces of the dough and sticking them onto the fingers before I put them in the oven (doing it this way made the warts look a lot more realistic). 3.) I used sliced almonds to make the nail part look thin and, again, more realistic...that also turned out great. 4.) Baked for only 20min and the cookies came out really moist. I'm definitely going to reuse this recipe for other "normal" cookies. I think it would taste great with a confectioners sugar frosting/glaze on top! The ONLY criticism I have is what others have pointed out....a TINY bit too salty. I would cut the salt to 1/2tsp.

this was really cool. I made a ton of these and had a blast decorating them. The cookie itself wasn't really anything special, but I liked the texture (it was on the crunchy side) I put almond extract in the batter to mix it up a little and added just a little green food coloring. They looked great

GREAT COOKIE. EASY FUN AND SPOOKY!!

BE CAREFUL MIXING THE DOUGH BECAUSE IF ITS MIXED TO MUCH IT DOESNT HARDEN AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD. BUT OTHERWISE ITS FUN GOT RAVE REVIEWS AND THEY LOOK EASY. FUN TO DO WITH KIDS TOO. AND CAN CHANGE UP THE LOOK BASED UPON YOUR PREFERENCE.

The only thing nice about these cookies was the idea for the holiday.  Made recipe exactly as directed, came out very dry and tastless.  Would not recommend for a kid's Halloween party.  Sorry....

These were very fun and easy to make but I recommend you make them as thin as your pinky finger, once in the oven the grow so much they look like monster fingers..that's what happened to my first batch, other than that they are fun and tasty. I'll be making them again next year. Thanks so much for this fun recipe.

Of everything I cooked for my daughter's halloween party, these looked the absolute best - like real witches fingers.  Beware that since the base recipe is for holiday cookies (which are typically iced) these cookies are not sweet enough. Next time I will adjust for this.  Since I realized too late, I just grabbed a can of vanilla frosting, a knife and had the kids ice the fingers before eating.

Great recipe!  Very easy and my kids loved eating them even though they were scary! They flavor is awesome. I'd suggest making them skinnier than you'd think they should be because they fluff up a bit. Great recipe!

Very cute and easy to make. They certainly looked real. I did not add the food coloring I just made them normal. I'm not a short-bread person so I didn't think they tasted all that great but they were cool for our halloween party. I served with some icing to give it a little more flavor.

I agree with the reviewer that said "one bite and the rest left on the plate". Recipe needs major tweaking for taste and puffiness.

Although I love how these cookies look, they taste awful - not sweet and the big chunk of almond on the fingertip isn't good either.  The appearance will definitely appeal to kids but I'm sure it will be 'one bite then left on plate', which I hate after spending so much time on them. I might try to make the same cookie using a different recipe, and maybe substituting a roasted almond or almond slice.  For those making this recipe, roll them very thin as they spread out during baking.  I made mine very much shaped like a real finger and they were almost double the width after baking.

Oh my!  These are so easy and soooo spooky!  Even my 7-year-old was able to make the creepy little digits!  The dough was the consistency of playdough, so it was very easy to work with.  The cookies are similar to butter cookies.  I was out of almond flavoring, o I used extra vanilla.  The almond would definitely put them over the top!They're not overly sweet and aren't the best cookies I've tasted, but the presentation more than makes up for that.  I used sliced almonds and tinted the dough green.  Amazing!  I can't wait to see the reactions I get when I serve these tonight.

I made these for friends and family and they were a big hit. The perfect cookie for a cup of coffee during the Halloween time. I did what others suggested and added green food color to the dough. I totally disagree with other reviewers in that they are not sweet enough, no extra sugar is needed. I would recommend instead to use really good butter, I used Kerry Gold Butter from Ireland and they tasted out of this world. I at first made a baking tray with really skinny fingers, and then was running out of time so I made them raw, finger sized but after baking, they were too big so I said they were from fat witches. Thanks for this recipe its in my October recipe batch for years to come! One more tip I used skinned almonds, and a few from the package had splits or were jagged at the "tip of the nail" area, these I searched for because they gave a pefect witchy appearance compaired to the "perfect" almond finger nails. Next time I will buy several bags to get the perfect ones for the fingers, and save the other ones for Gingerbread cookies for Advent

Last year was the first I made these cookies and were a hit at my boss' party. The only thing I didn't like was they broke really easy. I may have just made them too thin. I was asked to make them again this year and will add a few of the suggestions from other reviews. Thanks for the ideas!

Took alot of advice from the reviews. Green food coloring, choc chips for warts, toasted the almonds, dollop of red jam on the plate at the end of each finger. What a hit! Some people couldn't eat them they looked too real, but there weren't any left to take home.

Visually these cookies were a big hit.  Although if you make them too long they break when transferring them to a cookie plater.  The taste was OK but the desired affect was established.....oooooo, those look gross.  I would make them again

Wow were these great!!  I made the dough and rolled them out the night before I baked them.  The cookie itself is a not too sweet shortbread-style cookie and is really nice.  I made half the dough into fingers for a fund raising bake sale and the other half I made into thumbprint cookies, I made a little caramel frosting and toasted some nuts and put these in the thumbprints and they turned out great too!  This recipe will be brought out again next Halloween!  Thanks for the great recipe!
I also have turned these into eyeball cookies, round ball cookies with a chocolate chip pressed in the middle for the pupil, then gel icing for iris and blood vessels!

These cookies were truly spooky looking but really tasty. They were also easy to make and the dough was a cinch to work with. The recipe says it makes 60, but I ended up with 45 cookies which was still plenty. I put a little green food coloring in to make them look grosser. They were a big hit at the party!

I love to make these for the kids in my family. I make them look especially disgusting by making small cuts in the fingers before baking, and when cooked, I use red icing for blood and yellow gel icing for puss which I place in the cuts. I also roll up little bits of the cookie dough into the form of maggots and bake them for just a minute or so and place them in the cuts. It's truly disgusting looking, but tastes delicious and the kids love them!

These are so great!  I just use red food colouring on the base so it looks like blood and I serve them on white napkins that have been splashed with red food colouring... gory and absolutely perfect.  My son mentioned that all I had was white fingers so I added cocoa powder to a batch and had lovely fingers of colour.  And they are just so tasty!

I made this to bring to a party where the hostess requested "finger foods" - ha, ha!  I stuck a thin stick pretzel in the middle to simulate a "bone."  I added a dash of cinnamon to the dough, and they came out looking great, and tasting yummy as well.  For presentation, I stuck them into a (store bought) chocolate cream pie.  Then people could use  a finger to scoop out the chocolatty cream filling.  excellent!  One thing to note:  these were fairly time consuming in my world where I procrastinate, so allow yourself time (not just one hour) before the event to shape the fingers:)

Would have been good if I hadn't forgotten to pre-melt the butter. The butter melted in the dough while in the oven which caused the fingers to become more like toes Dx
Tasted fine anyways

You know how frustrating it is to pull that last half inch of waxed paper off the roll right in the middle of a recipe?! If this happens to you, it IS worth the trip to the store--I handled the first batch too much and they melted pretty flat in the oven. For a second batch, it worked really well to use a glass baking dish to squish the dough to about half an inch thick between two sheets of waxed paper to chill (for closer to an hour--20-30 minutes wasn't quite enough). Then I cut "french fries" that I could pull out of the fridge 2 or 3 at a time and quickly roll into finger shape--saves time and the less handling the better! Mine also got a bonus hour in the fridge before baking (my family decided they needed dinner), which helped keep them firm. I colored half the dough green and the other half purple, and gave each finger a wart or two of the opposite color. I mixed red food coloring with chocolate syrup and coated the almonds in that before placing them on the gel. Then I added red sugar sprinkles to the colored syrup for texture and dipped the "severed" ends into that. I was really pleased with the results--very gory! Last but not least, adults raved about how delicious they were, and the kids liked them but weren’t quite as crazy about them—they aren’t overly sweet.

The flavor of these is so-so, but the great look makes up for it. I used jam on the nail and base of the finger (instead of gel) to make them look severed. The effect was great!

This was phenomenal! I followed the cumulative tips (dyed the batter green, used strawberry jam that I added red food coloring to to make it MORE red, rolled each finger out and sliced off the end to square it off/make it look truly severed, dipped it in the jelly - baked the first 5 and saw what others meant - these really do puff up, so you need to roll them out thinner than you'd expect. I also about tripled the almond extract, as I found them to be rather bland.) So delighted with my teen daughter's reaction - completely repulsed upon looking at them - too realistic for her! Husband actually showed them off to some guy friends who were over for football :) Thanks for what will now be a Halloween tradition for us!

I love a good mix of yumminess and creativity. And this was definitely it. I made this as said in the recipe with no changes apart from using some raspberry jam instead of the red gel and skipping the almond essence (personal preference). Fabulous! I left the dough in the fridge for a couple of hours and removed the dough in small amounts while working with them because otherwise the dough can get a tad too soft. These do 'grow' a bit, so perhaps making them thinner thus giving them the allowance to 'grow' would be advisable or else you'll have monster fingers ;) I meant to colour these green, but conveniently forgot .... well they look creepy enough thanks to the hardened jam. Also, I later realised, that because I didn't use seedless jam, it looked as if there were tiny little bugs eating at the finger nail =P So yes mission accomplished! I can't wait to take a batch to work tomorrow. Happy Halloween everybody! And thanks a million Sandra for sharing your creativity with us! =D

i clipped this recipe out of a Canadian Living (CL) magazine many years ago, and have been making the 'fingers' for neighbourhood trick or treaters ever since (my last batch for 2011 is in the oven as I type). The only difference in the recipe is that the CL one calls for 2 3/4 cup of flour, and that amount has worked great. The kids love them for a treat - apparently ours is often the first house they come to on October 31, to make sure they get their cookies!

GREAT recipe! Based on other reviews of this being a cookie for adults, I added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and only 1/2 tsp almond extract. I think the almond might make it more "grown up" tasting. I liked how some of the pictures used sliced almonds, so I used those too and they look good. I put a little bit of red decorating frosting down before putting the almond on. I didn't do it after the cookie came out of the oven. I think any sugar cookie recipe would work well with this idea. Thank you!

Really good tasting cookie, don't roll too thick as they do spread. Used red gel frosting and placed under almond, mashed it down after baking. Awesome.

These expanded more than I anticipated, so I'd roll them thinner and put them further apart on the cookie sheet.
They were so salty they were inedible!!  I can only guess this was because I used SALTED butter.  I'd certainly recommend using UNSALTED butter!!

These were a lot of fun to make and a big hit!  Normally stuff like this looks super cute but doesn't have a good flavor, this did.  I actually have used this recipe just for sugar cookie cut outs... For the fingers, though, I dust with cinnamon and sugar to make them look "dirty".  Very yummy

I made these on Oct. 29, 2010 for an adult Halloween party.  They turned out great - just what the other reviewers have said, not an overly sweet cookie, but more of a shortbread cookie.  I followed the directions almost exactly.   I was a bit more liberal with the almond & vanilla extracts to make sure they had enough flavor.  Rolling them onto wax paper didn't really work for me, so I just rolled/shaped using my hands alone.  While rolling the cookies I placed my bowl full of batter on top of a larger bowl of ice -  I think this helped a lot.  I took the other reviewers advice & tinted the batter with green food coloring.  I used the red gel and then switched to strawberry jelly when my gel ran out.  I used sliced almonds b/c of cost.   These cookies were a hit, lots of fans at the party!  Also pretty spooky to look at!

Great recipe, and easier to make than anticipated.  Came out a bit dry though.  A tip: don't roll the dough between wax paper, just on top of wax paper.

This was a great project.  It was a little time consuming as I also added a pretzel stick inside the fingers for the "bone" effect.  I then made a mixture of chocolate syrup and strawberry syrup for a blood dipping sauce.  They were a hit at the Halloween party.

such a fun recipe!  I love baking cute and different things.  It's not supposed to taste the greatest, it's mainly supposed to look cool.  They freaked my husband and 5 year old out.  Time consuming though.  I used sliced almonds, looks more like finger nails.  Added green food coloring to dough and choc. chips for warts here and there.  The kids had fun making them.

Easy and cooked up nicely. Didn't spread. Warmed up quickly while forming the fingers so work quickly. I personally thought the cookie wasn't sweet enough and could use more sugar and vanilla/almond extract. My almonds were over cooked by time the cookies were done so the second batch, I sprayed an almond w/ Pam and palced it on each finger to leave the indent. When the cookies were done and still warm, I piped raspberry jam in the space then placed the almond in top. Worked great. These came out looking great. The kids/adults love them.

This is a standard sugar cookie recipe except for on thing, the powdered sugar is usually granulated sugar.  Also, the salt amount is high.  At first I thought 'hmm, bad baking soda? not enough salt?'  After reviewing my favorite sugar cookie recipe, I think this one needs major tweeking, plus the dough is way too moist to hold the shape of a finger and it is a lot of work to make the knuckles on each one.  Cute idea, bad execution.

I made these, they looked really creapy being pale.  I put slits in the and filled them with red gel so they looked bloodier.  But then when people tasted them (after saying ew) they loved them.  The taste INCREDIBLE.  A hit I now have to make every year!  Thank you!

These were fun and easy to make.  If you follow the instructions with making the knuckles and pressing in the fingertips, they can look very real like.  Also, do not make them too fat or they look less real.  Not only were these perfect looking, but they tasted yummy too.

I think these look great, but the taste was lacking. They tasted like they were missing something in the flavor department.  I made them for a Halloween party and everyone loved how they looked, but no one really ate them because they were so bland.

Great idea...bad dough. These only get three stars because of the awesome idea. The cookie dough is WAY too soft to hold shape in the oven. I even shaped the fingers and put them back in the fridge to firm up before baking and they still turned out fat and blob-like. I used a different sugar cookie recipe and tried again and they turned out great. My guests loved them!

These are a kick and so easy to make and "assemble" (if you can call it that!)  Great flavor and texture as I took a hint from another Reviewer and tasted the dough as I went along; and also added the flour in stages to keep an eye on the consistency.  "Skinny" means SKINNY, people - best to use your pinky finger as a guide and then, perhaps a little less width depending on the girth of your finger.  Ha!   Great, great, great recipe, Sandra ... thanks so much!

Very cute idea and great tasting! I made as instructed and had no problems. The dough is a little sticky which is why it needs to be chilled.  I scooped out a teaspoon of dough, rolled it into a ball and pinched/squeezed the finger into shaped as oppossed to trying to roll it. Use your pinky finger as a guide for width. I made mine like old knotty bent fingers. I couldn't find red decorating gel so I used the "Sugar Cookie Icing" recipe on this site and food colored it red.

Giving 4 stars all because the taste isn't so great. This was a super easy recipe and fun to make. The taste is for sure for an adult and not so much the kids. My 6 year old enjoyed the look but did not like the taste. My 65 years old father in law LOVED the taste. Anyhow cute cookies and I will probably make them again but add sugar for a more child like taste

Fun stuff!  My son and I made them for a class party last year and he signed up to bring these again this year.  Makes LOTS of cookies - enough for my daughter to share with her class and I brought extras to work.  Thanks Sandra - another keeper for my file.

The flavor on these was great, and they were pretty awful to look at! We all went to work with toothpicks making indentions and shaping just like real fingers. The only thing to keep in mind is that these will at least double in size when cooking, so you must make them thin when forming. Unfortunately this was a mistake we made, but otherwise great recipe and a great idea!

These were a big hit at the Halloween party this year! I had never made cookies with confectioner's sugar instead of granulated, and I really liked the texture the confectioner's brings to the dough. My two comments are: 1) try to keep your hands cool while you are working with the dough, because it is very buttery; and 2) make sure you make the "fingers" skinny as you're forming them, because they do puff up as they bake - you don't want it to look like your witches are retaining water! :)

These were a great hit with my teenage daughters friends this halloween they were really taken by them, they tasted great too a bit like shortbread but lighter.  Only adaptation was the addition of the green colouring and I used flaked almonds for the nails instead of whole ones.  I can see these being a halloween favourite for many years to come!

These were so fun to make and taste so good!  You definitely need to refrigerate the dough so it is easier to work with.  I tinted it green and used red food coloring instead of the gel for blood.  My kids thought they were so gross they didn't even want to eat them!

I used this recipe for the first time this year for a Halloween party, and everyone LOVED it!  I did leave out the baking powder and salt, though (to keep it from rising and losing it's shape) and I used slivered alomonds instead of whole ones, so when you add the red gel, they're light enough to stick, and the red even shows through like blood.  I also made the lines going across the fingers to make them look more realistic--several people said they had to shut their eyes just to eat them!!  I will definetly make these again next year!!

My girls and I really enjoyed making these.  They were very simple. Hard for the kids to mess up since they are crooked-y fingers. We will experiment more the next time with different fun ideas. I can also see how these are going to make excellent Christmas cookies when the season is upon us. I can't wait. Thanks for a fun time.

I was roaming around allrecipies and found this amazing recipie being a 14 year old chef I was very excited to make them and made them everybody in school loved them and my teachers asked for more the only mistake I made is that I added liquid butter instead of softened butter and the dough was very sticky and guey so I had to add more flour and on some fingers I added peanuts but the impression was not that much other then that a full five star dish :D

These are the best cookie ever.  When folks say to roll the dough to a thin size that is the truth.  After a few testers, I found that if you roll the dough to a pencil sized roll and cut in 3 inch lengths you get a nice finger sized cookie.  If you are looking for a TROLL type cookie roll them a bit thicker.  Thank you for all the great advice. Milli

These cookies are so good and melt in your mouth due to the confectioners sugar, I added a little cocoa powder to my mix for the dark skin, wowed the crowd. My family look forward to them every year.

I have made this recipe twice now, and I feel that the second batch was a lot better. I made both batches, two different years for Halloween. This last time, I got a lot of compliments, and most all of them are gone. I feel better about my cooking now.

Fun! It takes a little practice to get the fingers to look real. My favorite looking fingernail is a blanced almond. It looks very real. Slivered almonds also look good but are very brittle. (Very tasty too!)

These were amazing.  The tasted good and looked so cool.  We moved to Norway and Holoween is a new thing here so I made these for my daughter to take to schoo.  I made about 80 finger and her class only has 24 students.  She brought an empty plate back and told me that everyone in her school was taling about them.  So fun and easy but a bit time consuming....still worth it:)

These were great.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used almond slices though.  Once cooled, I used Wilton red no taste food coloring and put some under the almond and some on the end where the finger was "cut off".  The kids loved them

These were really yummy- nice and buttery! I added green food coloring to the dough as well as a little extra sugar. I also took other's suggestions and dipped the almonds in strawberry jelly before inserting them into the "finger". I smushed the other end of the cookie and added more jelly, to simulate a severed finger. It was awesome!

I made the witches fingers- dyed them green and used the almonds- SO GOOD! These were the softest sugar cookie recipe I've ever used, and by far the best. I'll be using this for all my cut-out cookies. Thanks for sharing this!

The taste was there for anice butter cookie. I followed the directions to refridgerate the dough before baking and still had flat thin cookies that looked nothing like a finger. Not sure what that secret is???

These cookies were fantastic to make.  Easy and very life-like (I suppose).  Everyone at work loved them and they were shortbread tasty! I did use sliced almonds and made some green (called them monster fingers).  They were a huge hit!

Made these according to the recipe.  I think I made them too big.  When baked they kind of spread out and came out a bit flat.  Looked pretty neat despite that.  I might add a bit more almond (or a dash of salt maybe?) for a bit more flavor.

This was awesome!! Many complements at my halloweeen party.  I rolled with my hands to the shape of my pinky and tinted green. Freaky looking. I also used raspberry jelly for my finger nails and cut off ends.  More of a short bread cookie so don't be surprised when they don't taste like a sugar cookie.  Liked the almond extract.  They got eaten rather quickly at my party. Thanks!!

I have made this for the past two years and now it's just a given.

Changes:  I used sliced almonds and put raspberry jam under the "nail" and at severed end - cooked with the jam on.  It makes it look coagulated.  Ewwww.  :-)

I thought this was a very clever and cute idea! I added more almond extract than the recipe called for and would probably double it next time (but I like a more pronounced almond flavor). I also used sliced almonds instead of whole almonds for the "nail" and used raspberry jam instead of the red gel on the nail bed/cuticle. I also added some of the jam to the other end of the finger for a "severed" look!  They looked gross but tasted good!

What a fun Halloween treat to make. It was a hit at the party! It ended up looking like fat witches fingers because it expanded when it baked. Next time I'll make sure to roll them a bit skinnier, but either way, everyone loved them! IMPORTANT NOTE: There is no need to remove the almonds, just line around the almond with the gel.

These were really fun to make, they tasted good, but I think the almond extract was a little overwhelming. Maybe when I make it again I'll do 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond, thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous recipe!  Added a bit more extract per other reviews and 1/2 the salt.  Colored them green and used the whole almonds. Another reviewer said to roll them about the thickness of your pinky and that was perfect.  Squish the rolls twice for "knuckles" and add lines with a knife.  I added 2-3 mini chocolate chips to each for warts.  They were a huge hit with neighbors and co-workers!!

Ok, so I didn't do the recipe at all...but at least I'm not one of those people who are going to change the recipe completely and give it a bad rating!  Instead of the cookie mix, I used breadsticks for this and dipped them in garlic, parmesan, butter.  I'm only writing this review because I thought the concept of these were so creative and loved the idea!!!  Thanks so much!

I have made these several years in a row.  We full a cookie press with the dough and press it out into long rolls, cut into shorter sections and shape into fingers.  We use a knife to make little slices in the "knuckels".  We use sliced blanched almonds for the nails.  They look very realistic and taste great.  Lots of fun to make.

Loved this easy recipe.  Cookie dough was easy to work with and gave great results.  Just a little salty for my taste so will do everything the same next time except cut back on the salt.  But overall this will be a new tradition for Oct in our home.

Im the worlds worst baker, however, i used a pre-mixed pack of sugar cookies to make this one. it did pretty good. I rolled mine on the wax paper and in a mixture of sugar and baking cocoa for the dirty finger look. this gave it a much better flavor. i don't like sugar cookies normally. i also added candy corns for the "nail".

These cookies are super cool!!
I dyed the dough green, put admond slices on for nails and used the red gel frosting.  I had blood coming out of the nails, where the finger was cut off and the more the mess you make with the blood, the better!  I placed the cookies on top of sterile gauze and had blood leaking out.  If you accidentally break a finger, just add blood to each side of the break!  THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAD A BALL WITH THIS RECIPE!!

Cute look but have very little taste.  Not sure if I'll even serve them.

Made these today to bring to friends' house tomorrow.  I put green food coloring in the dough as suggested, put almonds on before baking with a dab of strawberry jam, and added a single chocolate chip to each one as soon as they came out of the oven for a wart.  What a fun recipe!  Thank you!

These cookies are fun to make! Don't use jelly to hold on the nails as I did because they stick to the pan and break. Also, next time I will be adding sugar to the next batch as this recipe isn't real sweet. Otherwise we loved them!

They look great!  Need to cut down the salt to prob 1/2 tsp.  They tasted very salty and i only used bout 3/4 tsp of salt.  Also make them very skinny when shaping, they puff up and grow in oven and then look like fat witches fingers

I hate to give a low rating for someone who took the time to share...and what a great idea. The only thing was that the recipe was a total failure for me....too messy, too tedious, and really not a good flavor. I was so disappointed. I'm sorry for being so truthful...again, a great idea!

creepy and fun, I think they need more sugar, they have more of a butter taste.  Great for dipping in coffee. I did not get 60 servings more like 30.

These look and taste great and are so easy!  I do them for my children's school class.  As we are a "nut free" school, I make candy fingernails with a basic sugar, corn syrup recipie.  They look creepy and so real.  Add extra "gore" for older kids by dipping the other end in red icing.  Happy Halloween!

These were amazing!  Almost too spooky looking to eat, but that's the point...  I used raspberry jam (seedless) for the "blood", put a drop of it directly on the tip of the finger before baking and pressed a slivered almond in.  The result was perfect!

These looked amazing but I might try making these with a different sugar cookie recipe as the dough was not very sweet by itself. This dough does hold it's form beautifully though and a finishing touch is some red gel frosting under the almond nail.

Super creepy, wonderful to impress your guests!  
But for a cookie that needs to be shaped, this dough was very touchy and difficult to work with.  No matter how fast I tried to work, the dough seemed to melt even faster - making it more frustrating than fun to shape.  
Also, this cookie was not sweet.  In fact it was surprisingly bland.  I would definitely make the "fingers" again, but I would not use this recipe again.

I made these to serve at a speaking engagement. They were a hit! I use the sliced almonds with black gel. At Halloween I tinted them green but this last time just wanted them to look like dead fingers. I will add a bit more sugar next time as I'd like them a little sweeter. The most difficult part was keeping the dough cool enough not to lose their shape. I put the bowl in the freezer and took just enough out for one pan. After they were ready to go in the oven I put them in the refrigerator while I shaped the next batch. They don't spread as much if they are cool.

Easier than they sound, and really spooky!  Roll the fingers thin, because they do plump up when they bake.  Be careful when you remove the almond because they are very hot! Nice taste and texture.  These were a hit at my Halloween party.

These were awesome!!!  You could make them green too and that would be cool.  You could make them long and fat for giant's fingers.  The kids loved them.  So did the Adults!  I think I will use red frosting instead of the gel next time.  It tastes better.

I followed the recipe exactly...turned out great. Everyone loved them. I used sliced almonds, not whole, and red frosting (tastes better then the red gel). My 7 year old son would NOT eat them. He said they looked to real and gross!!! HAHAHA that was a big complement to me!!!

These little fingers were a hit! I would try to use a honey roasted almond next time to give the cookie a little more sweetness, but they were awesome as is. Just make sure that you keep the pre-baked form smaller than a real finger because they will absolutely expand.

I took note of other readers' complaints about the cookies being bland, and instead of using the vanilla and almond extracts, used 1 Tbsp lime juice, 1 tsp lime zest, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Fantastic!   Dipping the almonds in a bit of jam prior to baking (instead of using the red gel) does produce super gory/disgusting results, as does using natural (brown, as opposed to blanched) almonds.  I had someone comment that they looked like the gnarled fingers from an ancient chain-smoking ghoul - perfect for the 'eww' factor!

These looked awesome.  They were a huge hit at the party, but most people didn't actually eat them.  They were hard and crunchy and not sweet at all.  My kids didn't even like the taste of them.  I tried cooking some batches for a shorter amount of time, but that still didn't help the crunchiness.  I'll continue to make these cookie shapes for Halloween, but I think I might try peanut butter cookie dough and see if they'll hold their shapes.

Three stars for imagination and presentation! My two teenage boys were thrilled when they saw this treat for Halloween-but nobody's eating them (except me :(  My youngest son said that next year I should make these using a different cookie dough recipe-like my oatmeal cookie recipe, so they'll taste great and look like a toe from some creature from Lord of the Rings. Sounds like a plan!

These were a huge hit at our Halloween party.  We made them with raspberry Jam and almond slivers.

These were an absolute hit...a little time consuming, but so worth it in the end.  My little guy kept stealing them.  This will be a definite repeat for next year's Halloween.  Thank You :)

These were great - easy to make with my 8 year-old.  We used packaged icing with red food coloring and almond slivers for the finger nails.  They were a hit with her grade 3 class

After reading the reviews it seemed like the most common complaint of these cookies was that they were bland & not sweet enough but we all loved them!  I made a few changes based on what I had but nothing substantial -I used salted butter (omitting the salt in the recipe), I used 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (omitting the almond extract) and I decreased the baking powder to 1/2 tsp.  I chilled the dough well but they still spread.  I just made them small like others suggested.  I didn't have any decorating gel so I mixed up some confectioners sugar with milk, vanilla extract & red food coloring & used that instead.  I couldn't keep the kids away from them!  They keep begging for another "finger"!

Oh my gosh, these are super cute, tasty and fun to make!! The only thing that I did different was add green food coloring to the mix. After looking at all the photos of this recipe I thought the green ones looked the best! I made them tonight for a Halloween pot luck at work tomorrow and I had to promise my teenage daughters that I would make them again this weekend. Great idea that I will make evey year...thank you!!

I followed recipe to a T. I had seen reviews about how this was a more adult cookie and it needed sweetening. I didn't want to detract from the look, so after adding 4 drops of green coloring to the dough for the green witch fingers, I also dipped the rolled "fingers" in brown sugar and sprinkled a little on top to give it a "dirty" look before baking. The came out as a very sweet sugar cookie. I also added chocolate and peanut butter chips as "warts" and odd "bumps"

These were cute and pretty easy to make. Mine didn't turn out as pretty as the default picture but they do the job. I'm deducting a star for flavor. I do like the taste of almond extract but it wasn't sweet enough for my taste.

This is a fantastic recipe, I made these today with my 3yr old son and he got such a kick out of making witches fingers. These cookies taste excellent and not childish as I expected. The recipe was so easy. the only change I made was using green frosting. Thanks for sharing!

These witches fingers had a good design, but the sweetness was lacking.  My children did not like how bland they were.  I think using a normal sugar cookie recipe would have worked out better in the taste category.  But again, the design was absolutely cute.

I read some reviews that said the cookies didn't taste all that great so I omitted the almond extract because I didn't have any and I threw in some butterscotch chips and WOW were they good. After the cookies baked you could not even see the chips in them. The cookies were a light texture but with a little crunch from the chips. These cookies are fun to make and eat. Perfect!!! Oh, and the green food coloring is a must.

I made these for my son's Halloween bake sale and what a hit!  All of the kids just loved them.  Very fun to make and they look great.  I really, really liked the taste of this cookie too!  They do get fatter when you bake them so roll the fingers out much thinner and shorter before you put them in the oven otherwise you will end up with green fat fingers..   I also did not have the decorating gel the first time I made these and some of the almonds/fingernails fell off... the gel does help to hold them in place.   Awesome tasting cookie with a fun look and definately a 5 star rating from me!

Five stars for realism! I took them to a potluck and some people were initially scared to try them because they looked so realistic. **Special note, though** the fingers have to be made REALLY skinny, about the size of a small pencil, in order to come out cooked looking real. They expand A LOT in the oven. The taste was pretty good too, although they could use a bit of frosting, someone suggested.

I made these for a halloween party and they were perfect! I followed the directions exactly as written.  I read reviews saying to omit the salt. I disagree...i was glad i did not omit the salt. The end taste was a subtle sweet/salty taste. Everybody loved them! I wrapped up half of my dough in plastic wrap and put in the fridge.  The other half...i added green food coloring...and a little bit of blue food coloring to make a nice dark green.  I wrapped that up in plastic wrap and left both balls of dough in the fridge for an hour.  The dough was really easy to work with. I did roll the fingers out super thin...about the size of my pinky.  I love this recipe...will make every halloween! Thanks!

THESE ARE GRRREAT!!! I dont consider myself to be all that crafty, but they turned out just like witch fingers!!! One thing i will do differently next time is cook for about 12-15 mins, NOT the 20-25 the recipe states. I burnt the 1st sheet of them trying to follow directions! I also added tiny bit of green food coloring to make them look even more witchy!!!

These are adorable!  I found it easier to form them by rolling 'worm' shapes in my hand with my fingers open so there are knobby places.  Then put almond on smaller end near a small knob.  Put wrinkles in with back of paring knife.  For large knuckle, I used a plastic oval-shaped 1/8 t, pressing the open side down over the middle knobby area then put the wrinkles in there.  The less precise you are with your formation of the fingers, the better they turn out.  Check out photo 90 so you can see what I mean.  The taste is good but would be better (sweeter) if you could roll them in confectioner's sugar.  However, I think that would take away from the wanted effect.  I might serve them with some to dust in on the side.  I also did not have gel icing so made my own with corn syrup and red gel food coloring.  Worked fine. Thanks, Sandra, for this brilliant idea!

I love the idea, however there are a few things that didn't work out.  I mixed the dough and put it in the refrigerator for the next day, next day the dough was too cold and all it did was crumble in my hand, you need to have the dough warm up at least a couple hours before handling.  the cookie dough was way too salty I ended up throwing the dough out, maybe I'll try it again next year (with less salt) or...just find a dfferent recipe and use the concept but for what it's worth everyone loved the idea of the fingers!

These were easy to make, I'll give them that, but honestly I could barely taste anything but flower, baking powder, and salt.  My roommate and I both tasted the dough before we put it in the oven and decided this, so I added some more butter, sugar, and extract (both kinds), blended it, and then tested it again and it still tasted salty but less so.  We went ahead with baking them then and when they were done they -looked- awesome. But then we ate them and...despite are additional extracts...they were utterly tasteless except for salt and flour.  We did only use a teaspoon full, so I don't know what particularly happened but...I'm not going to be trying this recipe again.

Okay, as everyone knows this recipe is more for looks than for taste.  Be sure to chill your dough for a LONG time.  I even put mine in the freezer.  If you have hot hands and you begin to shape the dough and it gets sticky, your fingers (the witches fingers that is) will totally S-P-R-E-A-D while baking.  Be sure not to make them too thin b/c when you try to get them off the baking sheet etc....they can crack b/c the dough is really soft.  Like a soft sugar cookie.  My Halloween guests kept walking by the platter of these saying "Whoa..what the...oh my gosh, that is gross!"  So I guess that's a good thing....LOL

These cookies look awesome in the presentation!  I made them twice, first with the almond extract, and the second time I added 2 1/4 tsp vanilla omitting the almond extract.  The omission of the almond made the cookie taste much better.  I added 3-4 drops of green food coloring the second batch, and they had just a tinge of green that made them look a little more vile. I shaped them rolling them in my hand without the wax paper, and that worked fine.  Make sure you shape the cookies thin, because they spread a bit while cooking and the thinner cookies look more realistic.  My batch made about 50 cookies, and were done in about 10 minutes.  Enjoy!

I make this recipe every Halloween and everyone loves it!  I don't know why some reviewers are saying the taste is bad - this is a pretty standard shortbread cookie recipe.  The taste is delicious!  If you don't like shortbread cookies and want something sweeter, then use a sugar cookie recipe instead.

Don't knock a recipe just because you wanted it to be something else... that's like rating a meatloaf poorly and listing all the changes you made to turn it into hamburgers!

I saw the picture and I was hooked.  I picked up all the ingredients then started to read the reviews, which really made me worry about the flavor.  I have to say I am so pleasantly surprised.  These taste just like a shortbread cookie (Lorna Doone).  We used all the ingredients as they were originally posted except I used almond slices rather than whole almonds for the nails.  They were fairly easy to slide out after baking (for squeezing gel in nail beds).  I also used green food coloring in the dough.  It's tough to find a good thickness...the ones that I rolled out pencil thin were a little too thin...the ones I rolled out a little bigger than pencil thin were a bit too big, but both sizes looked great!  I used the chocolate chip wart idea and used red icing at the opposite end of the finger for flavor and effect.  I placed the fingers on a bed of gummy worms and it's ready to go for the party tomorrow!  My 10 year old son is thrilled!  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are hilarious and that's why I had to make them. Ok I did what others said; I used 1/2 cup criso and 1/2 cup butter. Used Strawberry jam with the almonds prior to baking (thus saving a step at the end) and baked them for only 20 minutes. They turned out perfect. I had a taste tester say she thought they were great! 

It is sort of CREEPY taking them off the baking sheet because they do look so much like gorry fingers. A few will adorn the top of a cheesecake I'm taking into work tomorrow.  I just love this place.

It took me 3 batches to get these right.  I had a big problem with the dough spreading making the fingers look all fat and flat.  Finally, on the 3rd batch, I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter Crisco and had much better results.  I still couldn't get the knuckles quite right.  Check out "Tails" photos to see how they should look.  We thought the cookie was very tasty, almost like a shortbread cookie.

This is a great recipe thats easy enough for a beginner to make! I made it for my mom's gym halloween party and they were a huge hit (they even took some home to show their families).

I use metric measurements, and didnt have almond extract (its too expensive here in SA) so I used almond essence instead, of which I'll use a little less next time :P

These were sooo much fun at last year's Halloween party.  Make sure to chill the dough and add green food coloring to the cookie dough.  I also used raspberry and strawberry jam on some of the cookies and the red food coloring on the rest.  The jam "blood" tasted better and still yielded the desired effect.  What a fun recipe. I'm making these again this year...Thank you!

Followed the recipe exactly!  Even went and bought almond flavoring because i didnt have any.  I dont know how mine turned out differently than the others reviewers but they were very bland tasting and very crumbly in my mouth.  They were easy to make into the fingers and mine only made 46 so i had much larger fingers!  Definitely not thin dainty lady fingers.  Since i made these for a finer food event i didnt  go with the red under the almonds.  Would definitey be interested in hearing from other reviewers about what may have gone wrong with mine that th taste was so bland and they were so crumbly.  They held their shape well and didnt fall apart when i took them off the cookie sheet but their texture when eaten just didnt suit me.  They are definitey not sugar cookies!  I tried strawberry jam, nutella, caramel and chocolate cake frosting as a dipping agent to improve the taste when i served them but that didnt really help the flavor. Taking them to the event later today so will report on how well or poorly they go over,

Excellent cookie recipe!!  - don't change any part of recipe and follow exactly!  - used cookie decorator gel for the blood and made the cookie the size of a pinkey finger maybe a little bigger.  Will be making this cookie dough for christmas and use powdered sugar as the coating.  EXCELLENT

These cookies were always around at Halloween when I was a kid. Now I'm making them. With nut-free policies you can replace the almond with half a date, and just add extra vanilla to replace the almond extract.

I make these cookies except I use blanched almonds for the nails and then paint them with different colors of food coloring after baking. Family and friends love the cookies. This year going to bake with different colors of cookie dough and see how they turn out. Have fun with this recipe is is a show stopper.

This was a fantastic recipe that came out awesome!!!!! I made a traditional icing (confectioner's sugar, vanilla syrup, butter, and some drops of water) and added green food coloring to make a SPOOKY frosting dip for the cookies! This was a huge hit at my kids Halloween party! Thank you for the recipe!!!!!!!

These were good except they expand a lot in the oven so I ended up calling them "Giant's Toes". I took a red food coloring marker and added blood on the bottom part of the finger and on the finger. They tasted great!!!

They tasted great! and looked spooky enough for halloween! only problem was that they were a bit too buttery and sugary...also, take good care to roll them out thin because they double the size when baked.

It's a GREAT idea and also delicious. The only thing I would change is the baking powder. The first time I made them, they all kind of "grew" and they weren't pretty. Then I made them again without the baking powder, and they were fantastic!

Been making these for years. I think it's a shortbread cookie, rather than a sugar cookie. Few tips: 2 3/4 c flour helps them spread less and works much better. If you want them to really look like fingers you must roll them very skinny. Sliced almonds look much better and more realistic. You can put knuckle lines in the lower middle and upper finger area for a more realistic look as well as pinching the same areas first to create an actual boney knuckle. These tips make these look so realistic people often don't want to eat them! But they do :) I'm asked every year to make these! I was finally able to upload a photo!

The cute factor put these over the top. I liked the taste of the cookies, but I have a recipe that I actually like better that I think I will use next time.  That said, the final product was REALLY cute!  I put a drop of green food coloring (everyone knows witches have a green pallor to their skin), and used the red jel under the "fingernail" and on the "severed" end of the fingers.  Everyone was a bit taken aback at first and then they laughed. No one refused to eat them. Great for a party!

My 8-yr old grandson and I made these. They are a royal pain in the neck. But the result is really cute! I used blackberry jelly to dress them up after they were done and left them in the fridge to harden the jam some. Looked like real blood!  I spread the dough just a little over the almond slices (not whole ones) to keep them on a little better. If the dough gets the least bit warm, its a mess & you have chill it again. Think I might use a sugar cookie dough next time, my grandson didn't care for the taste of these, but really cute! I liked the flavor, and adult tasting cookie, I think.

I made these for Halloween. They really looked like fingers, but the best part was the cookie itself tasted GREAT! They reminded me of Christmas cookies I loved when I was a kid. My son thought they looked gross, which is cool in his book.

Great recipe! My son and I had alot of fun making these yesterday for his cousins. Not only were these too cute, but hey also were very tasty. We added a few drops of green food color to make them look like real witch fingers. They were a big hit with the kids and adults and everyone loved them! I am going to continue to make these year after year with my children! Thanks for sharing!

I used only half the amount of almond flavoring, and you still get a nice taste without too overwhelming almond-ness.  I also used almond slivers instead of whole almonds, which look even more creepy because they are more nail-like.  Also added some gel to the base of the fingers to make them look like they'd been cut off with some blood showing.  Added a few warts, too.  Love it!

Pretty gruesome for Halloween!  I used slices of almonds for the nails with red gel icing under the almonds after baking.  Make sure you roll them skinny or they will turn out too fat.  They WILL spread while baking.

This is a really fun recipe to make. My kids are grown and gone, but I had a blast making these by myself. My family and friends laughed so loud and they are a hit! The only thing I would change is to make them a little sweeter. They're a nice, light cookie with a good almond flavor. I substituted white flour with whole wheat and almond flour. Turned out great. Enjoy!

I made these for my daughters class.  She has kids with nut allergies in her class so I made them "troll fingers" instead.  I used neon green food coloring and junior mints for the nails.  I baked them then added the nails along with some red gel blood.  The kids loved them. Use the same amount of dough just make them short and stubby.

These are very good! I didn't have confectioners sugar, so I put regular granulated sugar in the coffee grinder. I think it worked! The texture was alot more softer like powderef sugar. Don't make these too thin. If you do, you cannot bake for 20-25 minutes. Believe me, my first batch went to the garbage! I made them a little thicker and baked for 20 minutes. It's best to just bake a few the first batch until you see what works best for you (thickness and how long to bake), so you don't waste too many cookies. These are so fun to make!

Way too bland.  Not enough sugar.  Tastes like a shortbread.  The appearance was cute but not really edible.  Also, since the dough grows in the oven, a note  should be made to make them thin.

These cookies were a hit at my son's Halloween-themed birthday party. I substituted cinnamon for the almond extract and they turned out great! I used some red food colouring to make the fingers look bloodier.

What a fun recipe to make!  My daughter and I had so much fun making these.  I read some reviews about saltiness, so I used unsalted butter and used only 1/2 tsp of salt.  My daughter did not like them (they are probably not sweet enough for most kids) but I loved them.  They are amazing with a cup of tea.  I even used green food dye for some of the batter and they turned out great.  Next time I would add the dye to the whole batter.

Made these last year for our local "Trunk or Treat" party at our neighborhood market/post office/gas station/cafe where we all back in around the perimeter of the parking lot & hand out safe treats to the kids from the trunks of our cars or pick-up beds. The adults bring cookies & other baked goodies while our hostess provides hot cider & cocoa mix packets, hot water & coffee. 
Added a little green food coloring to the dough just for fun(they turned out awesome looking). These cookies disappeared like magic & I kept hearing "Who made those finger cookies? The ones with the almonds...I want the recipe!"
Truth be told I tasted one & had a really hard time staying out of them long enough to get them to the party!

previously added a review. However, here is a warning. I put the dough I did not have time to cook in fridge and it got way too hard. Don't know what I was thinking-of course the butter hardened up. Also, got way fewer than 60 cookies.
Can soften dough by leaving on counter for a few hours if you get it too hard.
The green look really disgusting-perfect for halloween

I think these "Witch's Fingers" are awesome!  One thought though... How about a whole almond pushed into the end as the finger nail?  I think that would taste fantastic (however, I am a nut for nuts)

I made these cookies this weekend, they turned out great.  I did read some of the reviews before I made them, and I cut some of the salt and added more sugar. The turned out perfect, although the first batch I made came out to hard, I think 20-25 min is too long,  the rest of the cookies I only baked for 12-15 min and they came out perfect.  These cookies were a real hit at the party!!!! thanks so much for the idea

They looked really good when I saw them, and when I ate them.  They were really good for my son's sleepover party.  I had to make more so this time I did the same as Laura M did, I added the green food coloring to the dough, looked like realy witch fingers!  These are going to be made again!

Great recipe.  I like to add green food coloring (before the dry ingredients); you get green witch fingers - yummy!

These were a hit at my husbands Halloween party. I used cocoa covered almonds by Emeralds and it went really well with the almond cookie base.

These cookies were a big hit at the party.  I did make a couple of changes, but couldn't have made these without your recipe to start.  After the cookies were done, I removed the almonds and put a little bit of raspberry jam in nail beds and put the almonds back on.  The cookies were a bit dry, so I painted a light glaze by mixing 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and a little bit (about 1 Tblsp) of water. I am adding my photo to show how they turned out.  This is an awesome recipe. Thanks again.

I make these every year for my co workers and now my husbands co workers. They do take time and you do need to watch how fat you make the dough but they are SOOO worth the time and efforts. 
I had extra I passed out to my neighbors that came by on Halloween for the parents I know. 
Thank you for this recipe. 
PS. this year I used Neon Green food color and the fingers were AWESOME...even the "thumbs" I made .....giggle...

I love these! They were fun and easy to make. My daughters enjoyed them on Halloween.

The only thing I did different was I didn't use almond extract because I didn't have any on hand but they still came out great.

These were fantastic! I made them for my sons costume/halloween b-day and I have to say they taste good even when they are overbaked (they look creepier too, although it was NOT my intention!)  I was sooo busy in the kitchen making tons of food that I forgot I had them in the oven!! I was SO bummed out after the time spent making them, but was so happy after I tasted them.  I expected them to become really hard because they looked brown and overbaked.  Fortunately that was not the case, they looked better & still tasted great!  They were ALL GONE in no time ;o) Will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe!!!

I made these for my children to take to their class Halloween party.  I used green food colouring and put a little raspberry jam under the almond before baking. I also pinched them to make two knuckles and used a paring knife to make slits for wrinkles on the knuckles. They were a big hit!!

The almonds fell off after baking, so for my second batch I used some jelly like someone suggested, and also tried using Nutella.  Nutella oozing from the almond nails...that really hit the spot.

Absolutely delicious!  I added 1/4 add'l cup of powdered sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar.  I also added the green food coloring as mentioned by others and they were a huge hit!  Delicious and scary!! :-)

Awesome idea for a Halloween treat! Great basic recipe to use as a spring-board for being creative. The cookie recipe is good and techniques described all produce good results. I followed some of the advice given in reviews where I used blanched almonds, painted them with red food colouring, and then I also used raspberry jam. What I found to be really effective is I used a brush to sort of smear the excess raspberry jam over the finger, I chopped off the ends and painted it with red food colouring, and using a brush, I sort of sprayed food colouring over the fingers, which made it look like blood dripped on the fingers. I found that it is best to not be meticulous with these as randomness produces more gory results! Making these was loads of fun! Will definitely make them again! (-:

Great cookies! Some guests were reluctant to try one, but after a taste they changed their minds. Make fingers thin, they fatten out when baked. Blanch the almonds to remove the skins. I used red cake frosting with a touch of black food coloring for reattaching the nails and on the stump ends. I watered down the icing to drizzle on for blood.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!  The taste reminds me of butter cookies you get at Christmas time.  Very tasty, and easy to make as well.  I was surprised how realistic they looked in my picture!  The definitely double in thickness when you cook them, but they turned out wonderful.  Next time I want to dry adding the wart and blood at the severed end.  My husband ran to work with a bunch for his employees today...I better hide the rest.

Great recipe! Made it with my kindergarten group for Hallowe'en.  Added green dye to make "Monster Finger Cookies". With the second batch we ran out of almond oil and substituted lemon oil.  Both turned out delicious!!!

So fun!  I added green food coloring and did as some suggested to dip almonds in jam before cooking.  They are such a big hit!  Skinny fingers are best because they puff and get "fat-looking" if you make them too wide.  Obese-witch!

SO EASY AND FUN! Friends went crazy over them at a Halloween party. Followed recipe except I used almond slices for the finger nails, used almond slivers to look like bones coming out of the other end of the finger, and dipped the "bone" end generously in Smuckers reduced sugar strawberry preserves (mixed with red food coloring) before baking. Dipped in jam again after they cooled to make them extra gorey and put a bowl of the jam out on the cookie tray for dipping. The cookie itself is kind of average, and the jam makes it SO much tastier!  Once people got over the disgusting appearance, they got eaten all up. They really do puff up so roll them to about the size of your pinkie as others suggest. These are pretty easy, despite how they look and people will be blown away by them! I'm so glad I tried this recipe!

These were awesome! Easy enough to make, tasty, and they look great. I added a little neon green coloring to the dough, before I put them in the fridge to chill. A great witch's green:-)
I used cocoa roast almonds...the color contrast was nice, with the green cookies.

A few recipe edits: I added an almond paste center to mine and used raspberry jam instead of the decorating gel (also I put that on before baking, rather than after). 

They were a huge hit, and quite delicious!! Thanks!

These are great! Mine baked up too fat to look like witch fingers, but I had cut the ends of the fingers off before baking, so I put red gel on them and  called the cookies "I Said I Just Wanted a Trim."  Big hit!

This is a great recipe, but I make these for school, and with the nut allergies I modify it a bit. I take out the Almond extract and add an extra teaspoon of Vanilla extract. As well instead of almonds for the nails, I use pumpkin seeds. I also add green food colouring to the batter, for an extra effect.

I made these cute little fingers for an Adult Halloween Party and they were a big hit.  They tasted great and the almonds really do look like fingernails.  It didn't take very long to make them and I plan on making them every year.  They were delicious!

Took these to a company party and they were a huge hit! I skipped the gel under the almond, but wouldn't skip it again as the almonds fell off without that step. Will make these again!

I NEVER add salt to my recipes and they always turn out great!  When I rolled the fingers, I used confectioner's sugar, which gave it a sweeter taste that so many reviews complained about. I used red decorating spray to paint the almond slivers before cooking and they looked great!  Slightly embed the almond to look like a real nail.  LOVE this recipe!  Thank you!

Loved these! Very tasty, kids loved them...I dipped mine in chocolate on the side without the almond. It is VERY important to only work with chilled dough!!! Otherwise they will be difficult to work with and spread. The recipe does state to keep the dough chilled and work in small batches. Thanks for a really great recipe! Will definitely make again!

Third pan in the oven right now - added green food coloring per other reviewers suggestion and they look and taste awesome!  Flavor reminds me of spritz cookies - they are delish and will look great on a platter at the Halloween party tonight!  Thanks for the great idea & recipe

I colored the dough green...very effective. I also mixed a whole egg with red coloring and painted the tips of the dough before adding the nut as the nail...this held them on well and no extra sugar!  But who is conting???

I have renamed mine Voldemort's Fingers (adding Wilton red to the dough) and kids just cannot have enough. I leave my "nails" natural for a lovely contrast to the green finger.

I just made these this past weekend, I used the sliced almonds they look more like finger nails and I spinkled the fingers with green sugar spinkles for the kids.  I didn't want to creep them out too much.

These were a big hit with everybody.  The only red decorating gel I could find came in pretty small tubes.  Used two and a half of them for first batch, had to run to the store midway through.  So for second batch I tried strawberry jam instead.  Pretty good substitute but a little messy.  Not very red either, I bought one with no artificial coloring.  Tasty though.  Used some cashews for second batch because my bf isn't crazy about almonds.  Very creepy-looking but I think the almonds help make the things look more like fingers.   I may make a third batch.  These are good.

These cookies turned out amazing and everyone loved them, visually. The flavor was not good and had a bad after taste.  I made 2 batches just to make sure I was doing everything right and they just didn't taste good. We added chocolate to the bottoms to sweeten them up. However, they were fun to make and looked really good!!

These are creepy, easy to make and tasty. I used raspberry jam to hold on the almond before baking and it worked great. Also, it gave a dried blood look to the finger. I used a paring knife and made little cuts to resemble knuckles. Made the 'fingers' look even better. I think the cookies tasted good. Crispy, crunchy with a light texture. They do expand once they're baked. Leave room on the cookie sheet. Also, I didn't feel the ned to grease the sheet since there was so much butter in the dough. However, if the jam gets on the sheet, the cookies will stick. It wasn't a big deal. If the fingers are too thin, you might have an issue with them breaking when to try to get them off the sheet or even moving after they're cool. The broken fingers still taste great!! :-D

These are spooky and wonderful. Tip: make the fingers verrrry skinny, as they will spread upon baking. I added green food coloring to the liquid for a "Wicked" effect.

I made these for a Pumpkin Carving Party. They are really cute! As many of the other reviews, I did add a few drops of green food coloring and instead of using just whole almonds, I opted for the cocoa roasted ones. They look blackish and not only did it add a creepier look, it added a dash of flavor. Also as others had mentioned, I found them to be rather boring in taste... they are really cute though!

They do need a little more flavor but these are GREAT cookies! I suggest adding a little extra vanilla and almond extract. Not too sweet and very nice texture. These are going to become an addition to my annual Halloween baking, for sure.

These are AMAZING!  I made them for a class of 4th and 5th graders and they were a huge hit!  Not only are they easy to make, and delicious, but they are also fun for kids to make themselves.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

These are just to bland for my taste. I think next time I will just use my favorite sugar cookie recipe. The idea is really cute thou. I added green food coloring which I think is a must. Also as someone else said be sure to make them thin, like green been thin. They do puff up about double their size when baked. Added red gel frosting under and around the sliced almond fingernail and at the ends where they were "cut off". My son thinks they are the coolest!

I made the same look with celery sticks stuffed with blue cheese and cream cheese with green food dye.  I drew knuckle creases at joints and carefully sprinkled with paprika.  Used sliced almond for nail.  Looks great.

Brought these to a horror-themed party and they were a great hit. I substituted strawberry jam for the red coloring, and several people remarked that the touch (ha!) of jam really "made" the taste of the cookie. Labor intensive, but worth it.

Great recipe.  I added the green food coloring, and used raspberry jam instead of red icing. Gave it a bit oozier look, but also made them stick to the sheet some, so that was tricky.  A silicone mat solved that problem.  The raspberry did give it a nice extra flavor.  These were a huge hit with my friends and I will definitely be making them again.

I used jam as someone suggested. Also, I rolled the fingers then stuck them in the freezer to help them hold their shape. They still ended up a bit fat, but looked disgustingly perfect. Everyone loved them. VERY strong almond taste, which I liked.

The only thing I changed in using this recipe, was I used mapleline instead of almond extract because that's what I had. These weren't sweet enough. I also used 3 drops green coloring, also. Very cool looking. Just not sweet enough and I didn't like the texture.

easy, fun, not bad tasting. I would give it a little more almond next time. They were so realistic that my 4 year old nephew was afraid of them. I used green food coloring, otherwise made as is. Great Halloween recipe!

Great tasting, lots of fun! One of the best food items at our Halloween party. I added green food coloring to the wet mixture before adding in the dry, blends much easier. Strawberry jam (like others suggested) goes great with the cookie flavor, and looks awesome. Thanks!

I loved making these, I added green food coloring & about 1/4 cup more of flour w/everything else per the recipe, & sprinkled a little cinnamon & sugar on them for a even more disgusting "dirty" finger look.  I used store bought cookie frosting in red to dip the stump end of the finger & to glue the almond "nail" on.  To some I added a chocolate or butterscotch chip for a "wart"  Friends loved them!

These are fun and and tasty. Make sure to make really skinny fingers because they do spread out a lot in the oven (even if the dough is cold to start with). Huge hit at the party!

Wish I had been there to see the reaction.  I added some baked green tea powder as well.  It cut the sweetness a bit too much but I will work out adding a bit more sugar.

It's Halloween and I've just finished making these. Followed recipe, apart from one minor thing. They turned out better than I'd hoped for!!! Instead of red food coloring, I hate to use artificial dyes, I used strawberry jam. This was a time-consuming project, for me anyway, but SO worth the effort. My husband commented multiple times how disgusting and gory they looked. I put some jam on the end as well to make it looked like they were severed off. My dough was a little dry, but it was a mistake to my benefit as when they came out of the oven the fingers looked slightly wrinkled - it truly did add to a realistic effect! Taste was very good, too. Thoroughly enjoyed the outcome and taste and I know my son's friends this afternoon will LOVE these!Thanks SO much for a fab recipe!!!

Thank you for this great idea.  I made the fingers per the recipe with the exception of the almond extract and added a touch of green food colouring and I used green pumpkin seeds for the fingernails.  They are fabulous. I also tinted cheese cloth with tea splotches to look like dried bloody gauze to line my dish and am taking them to a party tonight.  I know they and will be a tasty hit.

I, too have made these cookies for years...found them in a magazine around '94....I thought the one end, opposite the nail looked weird because it was round. I cut this off flat and added the red there too. Looks a lot creepier because now the finger looks cut off ...the neighbourhood kids wouldn't eat them! The recipe asked for the gel but I also found Strawberry jam held better.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the taste is just OK. I followed the recepie, except for the "blood" I had used strawberry preserves, which I think made them look spookier as "the blood" had darkened. I also added green food coloring. I think 20 minutes is enough to bake. Please keep in mind, they do expand, so make them thinner, otherwise the fingers will come out chubby. I made some for my daughter's school party, then had some leftovers and brought them to my Juzzercize class. Everyone loved them, especially the look. I just hope something could be done to improve the taste.

I did not like these cookies very much.  They didn't taste very good (verging on too salty), didn't have a good aftertaste, and the cook time was too long to make big batches for my Halloween party.  On the plus size, they did mold into fingers very well.  Perhaps I'll find a sweeter almond recipe.  A different version would be to dye the fingers purple and use black decorating gel to adhere the "fingernails."

fun and a great conversation piece "finger licking good" but I gave it only 4 stars as they are time consuming. I used the whole almond with the brown skin still on. Much more realistic and the red gel was a plus for look and flavor

This is a neat recipe, and it turned out great using advice from other reviews!  I used 3/4 cup granulated sugar and room temperature butter so I didn't have to refrigerate the dough to form the fingers.  Due to our nut allergies, I used 2 tsp of vanilla, and flattened very small balls of dough to make the nails, glued them onto the nail bed with blackberry jam and then baked them until lightly browned or at most 15 minutes.

Yummy! Typing this just as I finished eating one not even 5 minutes out of the oven.    Only did a few things different, but basically followed the recipe. I accidentally over spilled the almond extract so it was basically doubled. I used the raspberry jam in place of the gel and I added about a tsp and a half of lemon from a previous review; not sure if the lemon had any effect. However, the end result...while my first batch of fingers came out fat, they were pretty good and had a good almond taste. I'm going to try the next batch with thinner fingers and see how they come out! :)  Oh, I also used the almond slivers and not whole almonds for the finger nails.

For those who are looking for a substitute for the almond I used Banana Chips. I dipped them in Raspberry cake filling and pressed them on. I followed the recipe to the T. First time I added more sugar and they came flat. 2nd time i followed it and they came out awesome. The taste is a little bland so I put the raspberry cake filling on the nail and the other end. I also took the black decoration gel with a toothpick and shaded in the knuckle parts. Chocolate chips warts on some because they keep falling off even after I put them in the freezer. Over all Im quiet impressed at what I did. I have a picture of them also. Oh i also doubled the vanilla and omitted the almond extract.

My girl is allergic to all nuts, so I just rolled out a finger, cut it thinly and made "nails" out of the cookie dough!I used the tip of the handle of a teaspoon to indent the finger tips where the nails go. Also, I am not crazy about almond flavoring, so I used Maple. It made the fingers a little more "finger" colored.

These cookies do not have much flavor.  However, they look amazing for Halloween!  I suggest using a red jelly or jam if you want to make them look bloody.  I also added a few drops of green food coloring to make them look spookier.  I would make these again for a party, but not as a tasty treat.

I left the cookies in the oven for 20 minutes as suggested and they became blackened witches fingers! Next time definitely will only bake for about 15 min. But the concept is adorable and would probably have tasted good if not burned.

My kid loved helping me make them.  I used strawberry jam, and lots of green food coloring to make the fingers green.  the cracked almonds are the best.

I agree with other raters, make the fingers super small, as they puff up quite a bit after baking. They looked great!

My only suggestion, make small fingers.  :D  They get fat when they cook and looked more like um, rolly pollies.  But the cookie mix was awesome and really tasty.

These look awesome!  One suggestion... call them "shortbread cookies" and suddenly, they're delicious!  They don't taste like sugar cookies, because they are a bit bland and hard.  If you call them shortbread, the taste is more appropriate with what you associate with that type of cookie, and the change in mindset makes them great.  Everyone at my halloween party loved my spooky witch shortbread cookies ;)

These came out great and for the adults with a "not so sweet tooth" they were a hit!  I found the taste just right for people that don't like really sweet treats.  Had to place a REAL SMALL dab of red decorating gel under the nail to hold the almond on b/c I made it for a Pre-K party (so I couldn't make it too scary).  The girls were grossed out and the boys LOVED them! (go figure) Tip:  Make sure you handle the dough in wax paper to keep your hands from warming the dough...they rise more if you activate the leavening agents prior to baking so they don't look as realistic.  Enjoy!

This is so great.  They really come out CREEPY.  They were gone in first hours of my Halloween party (and there were NO kids at the party).  Quick tip:  when forming the fingers, make them extra skinny because they puff up when you bake.  And really exaggerate the knuckles.  Will make again!  I used black decorating gel, and it looked just as gross!  Clever idea on a classic christmas cookie!

Definitely use the green food coloring and double the almond extract for better flavor.  These were a BIG hit!  I used pomagranate jelly to stick on the 'bloody nails' before baking. Big hit with the neighbor kids and Grandma, too!

Awesome recipe!  Hubbie, kids, kid's friends from school loved the cookies.  My husband thought they looked so real and too spooky to eat, even though they were yummy.  I made two batches in two days, the second batch I added green food coloring and it turned out great, thank you for a great spooky halloween cookie.

I didn't use the recipe for the cookie dough since so many people said it was bland. Instead I found another sugar cookie recipe with better reviews, but I did use the idea which worked out great. I do recommend keeping them small (around the size of your pinky finger or smaller) when you roll them because they WILL expand. If you can, keep the dough round as you place the almonds on so the fingers stay as round as possible when they bake.

Loved this recipe.  I followed the cookie recipe without any changes using top quality butter because after all this is a shortbread cookie which gets it's flavor from the butter.  I did not use the gel, but instead used strawberry jam mixed with a little red food coloring.  Some of my guests would eat the witches fingers and others wouldn't even look at them....so funny!  Will make again next year!!!  Thank you!

I made these on Hallowen and I had sooo much fun decorating them. What a fun idea! Everyone that saw them thought they were so awesome and were impressed! I did find the dough was too sticky and ended up adding more flour and I put the dough in the freezer for a couple of min to help form the fingers. I also made sugar cookie icing colored red to attach the nails after they cooled and painted the nails with black icing. I added cuts and bandages to the fingers and dipped the bottom of the finger in the red icing too. I will be adding my pic soon. I will def make these again!

These were the bomb for appearance - they look just like the picture. I thought the dough wasn't sweet enough so I mixed in about 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar and 10 drops of green food coloring to give the fingers a greenish tint. I baked for about 12 minutes. Then I added a little bit of strawberry jam (lift offf the almond and then put the jam on then replace the almond) on both the top and bottom of the finger. Squeezed a little of red food coloring on top of that. I took them to a party and everyone loved them. Thank you for the recipe.

These were so perfect for Halloween.  They were a huge hit at the party.  I read the reviews regarding how these cookies were bland and I almost didn't make them.  I'm glad I did make them.  They tasted excellent and I made them exactly as the recipe stated.  I didn't find them bland at all.  These are shortbread cookies after all.  They aren't suppose to be sugary.  Definitely a huge hit!

This is my first time attempting these cookies and I just had to try because they are so darn cool!  Like another reviewer suggested, I also added green food coloring to my batter and instead of using the red gel I also dipped my almonds in strawberry jam prior to baking and then placed them.. I think it made them more ghoulish looking!  The kids thought the cookies were just awesome. The only problem I had was getting them thin enough so they didn't expand to "monster" finger size when baked.

I just finished making these and they look great!  I followed some of the others advice and added a wart (chocolate chip) here and there and did the red gel on the ends of the fingers as well to really make them look severed.  I made dripping blood coming off the bottoms as well.

(In best Russian villian accent)  Fun only for making small children scream like "leetle girlz!"  Bwa-ha-ha!  I really enjoyed making these with my kids and watching our friends reactions.  I paired it up with "Sugar Cookie Icing" and used red gel with a touch of brown gel coloring from Wilton to get that shiny, goopy mess of a blood color.  Thanks Sandra!

My 10 year old daughter and I made this tonight for her class party tomorrow. She did most of the work and they look great! Her class is multi-cultural and she wanted some of the fingers to have darker skin so we added a spoonful of cocoa powder to about a third of the dough and the darker ones looked the most real. White, brown and green fingers! Very fun!

These were SUCH a hit at our Halloween party.  Kids and adults love them because they're buttery delicious and so fun! The dough is easy to shape if chilled properly first. Decorating was fun and easy.  Make these - and double the batch!

Great idea. As others stated I did add 1/2 cup regular sugar. Instead of red gel I used strawberry jelly with a little red food coloring. Then I put a dab on end of finger to glue the nail. I also put some on the end and when the cookies are baked it looks like the finger was ripped off. It adds flavor to the cookie also. You definitely have to make them skinny or you'll have monster fingers.

I made these last year and they didn't have a lot of flavor.  I now use my favorite spritz cookie recipe instead. They are such a hit!

These are GREAT!!  I took the advice of others and added more sugar.  I just kept adding spoon fulls on top of the 1 cup till the dough tasted sweet.  I also added more flour by the spoon fulls till I had a stiff dough and could roll the fingers by hand easily with out wax paper.  I baked for only 9 min and they look awesome.  Can't wait to take them to the party tomorrow!!

First off, let me say that these were a lot of fun to make!  Like many others, I added some green food coloring to tint the fingers and added some warts.  They turned out looking great.  However, they were very tasteless.  I was so disappointed in how bland they were.  It's a great idea-needs some tweeking in terms of taste.

These were great looking and tasting, I think I put icing at the other end of the finger as well and then put a bowl of red icing out just incase someone wanted to dip again. Love them and hopefully will make them again this year too. Didn't last for long at my party...

These were so much fun!  As other reviewer suggested, I added a little more sugar to make them tastier to kids.  Used Strawberry Jelly to stick the almonds on.  Had to make a few that were nut-free due to allergies, so I just used Mike & Ike candies instead as another reviewer suggested.

I rated this 4 stars because of how they looked at the end.  Very clever but way too salty.  My kids said they tasted like "playdough".  I follow recipes to a T and use unsalted butter.  IF I were to make these again I would omit the salt entirely.  I also baked for 9 minutes and they were fine.

These look soooooooooo "cute"---- they are also easy to decorate.  My only suggestion is to evaluate the size of each cookie; I made mine too big, so they were not crispy- but they did not fall apart.

These were great and so easy to make!  I didn't use the red gel and they still looked spooky.  Also, I used slivered almonds instead of the sliced and they were a hit!  Will definitely make them again!

We had so much fun with these fingers.  My son had an idea to put icing in the middle of the cookie and it tasted great! (We found that using a skewer worked well)  He also made a witch's nose out of the dough and put a big wart on the end of it, what a kick! We will definitely make these fingers and maybe a couple of nose's for our Halloween Party.  Thanks for the recipe.

These turned out great! They were a lot of work, but the outcome was great. The kids loved them and didn't last long. I added a few drops of green food coloring for the actual witch look. They do break easily so be careful w/them Otherwise Great recipe. Will make again.

They ended up looking GREAT and grossed a few people out to the point they couldn't even think of eating them. I have to admit though that I really didn't care for the taste and that they cooked up a lot quicker than the recipe says so watch them closely if you put food coloring in them!

Pretty good.  I added green coloring to the dough and strawberry preserves beneath the almond before baking, which gave it a yummy flavor.  But, I had a difficult time making them keep their shape.  But, they were close enough.  We still had fun with them and everyone enjoyed them.

These were the grossest looking cookie-things I have ever made, but they tasted great. They had the perfect hint of almond and were fun to make. I used a chocalate chip as a wart, as another poster had done, omitted the almond at the stump-end of the finger and just used red gel-icing. I made the knuckles with a knife, making little cuts where the knuckles would have been. I am definelty making these next halloween.

I, too, added green food coloring to these to make them extra-spooky and since I was out of almond extract, added a tiny bit of mint extract.  I got tons of compliments on how creepy they were, and only a few on the tastiness.  These cookies, while incredible to look at, reminded me too much of Christmas shortbread cookies to really enjoy them.

This was a big hit at this year's Halloween party! I made them nut-allergy safe by using imitation almond extract and by substituting roasted pumpkin seeds (the white ones) for the almond fingernails. My fingers were on the skinnier side, so if you make them skinny I'd recommend baking for 20 minues and then checking. One of my batches was scorched at 24 minutes.

These cookies made everyone smile!
I made the recipe using the suggestions of adding some green coloring.  On about half of the recipe I used Craisens for the fingernails - red, wrinkley and creepy looking. I can't wait for next Halloween to make them again.

These were soooo much fun!  My 12 year old helped me and we added a little green for the witchy color!  He got so into it and after one batch of fingers, he made a hand... We even tried making some ears!... They were good and didn't puff up as much as I'd thought.  The thicker ones were more moist and yummy!  I think this may become a Halloween tradition!  Thanks!

Holy freakin' cow!! These are the best cookies I have ever seen! They came out perfectly - I have never seen a more gross cookie. I loved making them and shaping them. I added two drops of green food coloring, sliced almonds dipped in the raspberry jam for the nails, and poked a hole in the other end of the finger and slathered on more jam so it looked like it was oozing out! The jam was very good with the cookie. The cookie itself is very good - not cloyingly sweet and the almond extract was perfect.

Excellent!  I used 20 drops of green and 2t of vanilla since the kiddies don't care for almond.  We shaped them into "dragon claws" for a dragon-themed party.  We just pointed the tips instead of using nuts.  Wish I had a picture but they were eaten too quickly!

Great idea.  I added 2/3 c granulated sugar, changed confectioner sugar to 2/3 cup, salt to 1/2 tsp, 2 tsp vanilla no almond and added 2/3 cup flour.  Tasted like a butter cookie.  Don't try and use sugar cookie, way too soft of dough for keeping the shape of a finger.  I made them, froze them on wax paper, then placed in zip lock bag and baked them when I needed them, the nail stays fine, if you want to "gloss" up the nail, paint with corn syrup after baking, also a good glue if you don't want red icing...IF the nail falls off.  Thank you soo much

Great!  They went over well at the party visually and were pleasing to the pallet.  I added some green food coloring to the dough to make them look like witches fingers and used whole blanched almonds for the nails.  My God Daughter asked if I would make them for her office party...there is a dessert contest.  I am doing that now, how can I say "no"?

Easy to make and they taste very good! Hint: Don't roll them out too thick because they will get bigger as they bake, perhaps a little bigger than a pencil.

These were really good.  I tinted the cookie dough green, and they looked really scary.  A big hit with my son's Grade 1 class (well the boys anyways), but didn't go over as well at my other son's preschool.  The kids were to scared to eat them.  Oh well, I still think they were great.

A fun recipe. I used raspberry jam to stick the almonds on the cookies before baking them with good results. I also made a small indent at the 'severed' end of the finger and put some raspberry jam there. The seeds in the jam looked kind of maggoty :). I liked the not-too-sugary, buttery taste of these cookies. Thanks for sharing.

These were such a big hit at our neighborhood party last night! Easy, fun and tasty! I added 3 drops of green food coloring to the  dough for a "faint" green color and they looked Spook-tacular!!

5 as far as looks go for sure. This is the same recipe I have from my "Taste of Home Halloween" 2005 magazine. Doesn't taste all that great but they look pretty creepy. I've not ever colored them so i'll give that a try this year for sure =]

These cookies look great for Halloween and they taste good too!  I brush a little red food gel over the "nails" and let it ooze down around the edges for a nice bloody look.  :)

Good recipe, but you can use the refrigerated bread sticks.  I tinted melted butter with green food coloring and brushed the fingers.  Also, I soaked the almonds in a little red food coloring with a touch of vegetable oil in place of gel.

Easy to make!  The kids and the adults loved them.  Rolled them using my fingers- my knuckles naturally made the witch knuckles.  The red decorating gel is a must.  I added green food coloring but didn't mix it completely up so it gave a swirly green effect- very cool.

I made these for an office Halloween party.  I too added the green food coloring to the dough, and used the red gel food coloring for the bloody end.  They were very entertaining to look at, but I felt they really had no taste at all......certainly not as cookies.  So I only made half the batch and used them as table decorations.  Everybody loved the way they looked!!!!!

This recipe is so much fun!  And tasty too!  We decided not to use the wax paper and just rolled the dough out in our hands (a lot simpler).  We also used green food coloring and added chocolate chip "warts" as suggested by others.

These were a lot of fun to make and were a big hit at our annual Halloween Party.  Our guests liked that the cookies were not oversweet and thought that I really went overboard. I made my fingers a little too fat (unexperienced baker), but they still looked great.  The other reviews and pictures helped me for I am very much a visual person.

These were quite good but rather dry (like a light shortbread). I didn't take the almonds out because, even with the gel, I wasn't able to get them to go back in. I overheard several people at my party say they couldn't eat them because they looked too realistic! I'll probably make these again, in a different form.

This recipe made 60 fingers. Super fun and easy. I used sliced almonds for the fingernails and strawberry jam for the blood. As the cookies were cooling I brushed on a little bit of diluted black decorating gel to give that eerie aged look.

A Great cookie and everyone were grossed out, but said they were yummy! Because of a nut allergy, I switched out almond extract for imitation almond extract, used raspberry jam instead of icing, and candy corn for nails. The jam made it look like the nails were bleeding!! I also tinted the dough a slight green colour as per munchkins request!

I made them just as is, rolling with my hands instead (because the dough kept sticking to the wax paper) and they were great! I brought them to a pot-luck and everyone loved them. Now I'm going to use the same recipe to make Christmas cookies, as the description mentioned. Can't wait.

I loved this recipe! It was exactly what I was looking for. I made mine too look like zombie fingers for our Zombie themed Halloween party. I used the raspberry jam, which was perfect for the blood under the almonds. I used red, green, yellow, and black gel icing for the cookies, after they were cooked and cooled. I also added the green food coloring with the wet ingredients, before adding the dry. I siffted the dry ingredients, so I had to add additional flour, maybe a 1/3 cup. Also, I used 1/2 cup powder sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar. 
This will be my go to recipe from here on out.

Looks were perfect but the cookies were a little salty.  My husband likes salt so he had no complaints.  I might suggest using no salt butter for this recipe if you will be adding the teaspoon of salt.

The recipe makes a very tasty cookie, but my fist batch didn’t work out so well. After some research I remade them, this is what I learned. Use a good quality butter. Cheaper butter has too high of a water content. Also, OMIT the baking powder. You don’t want the cookies to rise or spread like my first batch did. I used the gel tube icing under slivered almonds and it stayed very red and shiny after baking.  Hope that helps - enjoy.

Being a novice baker I'm always a little apprehensive when it comes to trying new things. That said, I made these for Halloween and they turned out great! The only thing I changed was removing the salt itself and opting to just use salted butter instead, since it's what I had on hand.  

I was having a hard time keeping the dough from getting warm. So, I took the advice of the video and put my fingers into the freezer for ten minutes after I had formed them and placed the almonds. This made them very easy to transfer to the baking sheet and helped them keep their shape in the oven.

Everyone loved these at the party. Dipping the one end into a red jam, while still warm, makes them especially ghoulish. I did replace the butter with half coconut oil/half butter to veer on the healthier side. Keep in mind to make the finger shapes much skinnier than you want, as they fatten up (nearly double in width) when baked.

Lots of style...not a lot of substance.  Cookies tasted boring...even when rolled in sugar.  I'd make again, but with a different dough.  Great idea, and they looked wonderful though.

Everyone loved them.  I did sprinkle reg sugar on each one before I baked.  Next time I might try cinnamon and sugar.  
My bunco group all want the recipe.
Thanks for the recipe, another one for my save book.

Such a cute idea! I made these a couple years ago and they were a hit because they were so disgusting looking. But no one ate them. My son later told me they didn't taste good. So I tried one and he was right. Very salty and no flavor. So this time I added 1/2  cup granulated sugar, cut the salt to 1/4 tsp, elim. the almond and used generous 2 tsp vanilla. Much better.

Delicious! I’ve made these for several years and they’re always a hit. I like to use sliced almonds. I think they look more like fingernails. Especially if they’re uneven and jagged.

Made these for a Halloween Party & everyone loved them! Instead of 2 1/3 cups of white flour, I substituted 1/3 coconut flour & it gave them a nice light texture. Also I used some whole almonds & some slivered almonds for the nails.  I melted chocolate and provided a dish of red raspberry jam, both for dipping! They went quickly!!

These cookies were labor intensive, but worth every minute.  I knew they were a hit when I saw someone stealing a few cookies at a Halloween party!   I watched him put a few into his coat pocket.  It brought a smile to my face.

It  can  complicated but I made the the knuckles and I left off the whole almond and the after the cookie cooled I used red gel to look like blood to put on an almond sliver for a nail and then put more on the end on the end of the cookie to make it look like a severed finger. .

I used sultanas for the nails. I sort of pinched it before inserting into the dough. Cheaper and gives a bit of  added sweetness to complement the saltiness of the butter. Will definitely make for Christmas.

yummy! These are so creepy to look at and so yummy to eat. I only did a couple things differently from the recipe. First I used all vanilla instead of the almond extract and second I made an egg white and water wash and brushed it over the fingers and sprinkled with granulated sugar. I baked mine at 325° for 15 minutes and they came out perfectly browned on the bottom and crisp. So good. this recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you.

great base recipe. I did make changes based on the other reviews. I put 3/4 cup confectioners sugar plus 1/4 cup granulated sugar to add sweetness. I also used two tablespoons of vanilla instead of almond since I was making these for my nephews. I dipped the almond slices in strawberry preserves so it would ooze out when I applied the "nail tips" prior to baking. I also recommend leaving the dough in fridge at least 30 mins and working with small portions of dough at a time. I baked less than the time on recipe, maybe 15 mins or until slightly golden. The cookies came out so delicious and soft on the inside. I then went back with a little red frosting gel around the cuticles and the end of fingers! So fun and creepy!!

Added green food colouring to the batter. We then painted the end of the almond and my son painted red on the cookie part to make it look like blood. Very gruesomely delicious!

These cookies taste great. I didn't have almond extract, so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and they came out fine. They did take a while to make though.  Instead of using red decorating gel, I dipped the almonds in raspberry jam after baking them. This recipe makes about 45-50 cookies.

These are really good, but I was struggling with the whole finger shape. So, I went to home goods and got a pan that all ready had the finger shape made I recommend using the pan because it was really useful and easy. The pan package also gives you a cookie recipe.

I've made this recipe the last 2 years as is, and has been a hit both at family parties and at work. For an additional creepy factor, I took some slivered almonds, and pushed one or two of them halfway into the end of the finger opposite the "nail".This makes the fingers look like the severed, cracked bones are sticking out of the end. Really effective when you add the red food coloring to give it the appearance of blood. I appreciate the tip of gluing the almond to the end with a bit of jam, since some of my "fingernails" came off when it came time to present and serve the cookies.  I will try that tirick next time I make these.  Great recipe, so glad I found this!  :-)  :-)  :-)

These cookies were a hit! One person said they were too neat to eat. Another told me how creative I was. They were really simple to make. I added the mini chocolate chips for warts and green food coloring too. Just remember to make them the size of your pinky finger and maybe add a tad more sugar.

I tried this recipe and then made a few adjustments. I used Slivered Sugared Almonds from Trader Joe's for the nail and used heated up Raspberry Jam that I dipped the end of the cookies into! Improved the recipe greatly!

I made these for an adult Halloween party, and instead of red icing, I used seedless raspberry jam. I added a dab on each 'nail bed' and then put a split-in-half almond on top of the jam, letting it ooze out around the nail. I also put some at the bottom 'cut' end of the finger. I used double the vanilla extract since I didn't have almond. They are delicious and eerie-looking! The jam turns brownish-red like blood, and jam tastes better (to me) than decorator icing. These are easy and delicious, I'll make them again.

I made these as written. They are a good flavored cookie, not sweet. Even though it seems that a teaspoon of dough would not be enough, they get a lot bigger around when you cook them. I made mine too big and had giant monster fingers. I used sliced almonds for the fingernails. They break easy so be careful "installing " them. I used strawberry jam to glue them on instead of using the red gel. Don't like that fake stuff. it still looked good.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night for our Halloween Dessert Contest at work today.  Watching the demo was very helpful and I took the suggestions to refrigerate the cookies themselves for 10-15 minutes before baking and to rotate the cookie sheets halfway through the baking process.  I agree that the dough must be very chilled to roll out and keep its shape. I would recommend checking the cookies at 20 minutes because I kept mine in for 22 and I think it was a bit too long.  I would also add less salt and a bit more sugar.  Be very careful when putting in the red gel because the cookies are delicate and can break easily. I made half green batter using food coloring.  The cookies came out great and I love the almond taste.  Reminds me of my grandma's butter twist cookies that we used to dunk in coffee! I am presenting the cookies on a skeleton plate with a plastic spider wine glass filled with strawberry spread with some fingers sticking out. Maybe next time I will use sliced almonds and some black gel along with the red and shred the ends of the fingers like some reviewers suggested.  The possibilites are endless!  These are really yummy cookies with a ghoulish touch!

These turned out fabulously but our first batch didn't keep their shape and spread out too much.  The two keys to success I found were to keep the batter really cold and roll out the fingers thin.  Once we did that, the fingers kept their shape quit well.  I added 1/2 cup of sugar and used 2 tsp of almond extract instead of vanilla extract.

I made them just now. Even if the dough was in the freezer for over an hour, the dough would get super sticky when i rolled it into a ball. I had to cut them like biscotti. I had to raise the temperature to 200'C and yet they still pretty much melted. They're kinda sandy as you eat and a bit greasy. Rating only 3 because of the look, otherwise they're delicious.

These taste great. I made them for a Halloween party and  as someone else mentioned, added green food coloring.  I also did some red icing on the ends.
They were a big hit but some of the kids would not try them because they looked too real  :-)    I didn't add them but mini chocolate chips would make good warts.

I just made them now and it's good!  It's so easy to handle.  I followed the suggestion of some...to make it like your pinkies only since it'll get big.  Just the right size I wanted.  And I made some changes to it.  I didn't add almond extract but instead added some lime zest since I ran out of lemons.  I think I'll add more zest next time.  So far it's good....but, EEEEEW!

Because I knew there was a strong possibility there would be someone that would have a nut allergy, I left off the almonds on the fingertips. Instead,  I used strawberry fruit rolls and cut the fingernails with a small cookie cutter. I did not use the addition of red decorating gel around the knuckles or fingertips as this can be  upsetting to the little ghosts. I did melt a few chocolate chips and used a toothpick to make the indentations on the knuckles.  I used the Wilton Witches Finger Cookie Molds and followed the recipe with the exception of adding 2 3/4 cups of flour. Fun recipe!

My 5yo niece and I made these yesterday and had a blast! Added green food color to about half the dough. The green fingers had almond fingernails and on the white fingers we used green pistachios for the fingernails. Followed the recipe as posted and the cookies were extremely salty (otherwise I would have given 5 stars!). If you use salted butter, cut the salt to 1/4-1/2 teaspoon. Unsalted butter should be fine with 3/4 to 1 teaspoon of salt though. I also noticed comments after the fact about rolling the cookies smaller because they expand when they bake. We actually ended up with large ogre-like fingers but they were still good! Will definitely make these again!

This was great, I added 1/2 sugar to make it sweeter and I also used black icing to set the almond and paint the nails with a make-up brush, after baking.  my baking powder may have been old because they didn't grow much.  I used a fork to shred the end and applied drops of red food coloring to make it look severed.  My kids think they are awesome!  I kept the batter in the fridge overnight, definitely made rolling the fingers out easier.

I loved this recipe! Very good but a little bland and too much salt. To give it more flavor in my next batch, I used 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of Almond extract. I reduced the salt to half a teaspoon and instead of using a full cup of confectioner's sugar, I used half confectioner's and half brown sugar. Overall a great recipe and with adjustments, a tasty treat!

They are easy to make and look really cool, I took others' advise and used jam instead of red dye.  But the recipe called for way too much flour as well as salt, in my opinion.  I felt this while I was making it, but really wanted them to turn out right, so I ignored my instincts.  Big mistake, my hubby warned me!  I still have some dough left, I am going to add some things to see if it turns out better the second time around.  Really tasty with frosting, but doesn't look right.  Thank you for the recipe, though!  My kiddos are very excited about all the Halloween treats!

I had this cookies at a Halloween party last year.  They were yummy and perfect for Halloween.  My little granddaughter is allergic to tree nuts.  So the almonds are a no-no.  Does anyone have a suggestion for an alternative?  Thanks!

I made this recipe for a party with some changes. I used coconut flavoring instead of rum and cherry pie filling in place of the red food gel. I used Splenda instead of white sugar and like most folks I added an extra 1/2 cup. I also dressed them up with green food color and alternated half with almond sliver finger nails painted with yellow food coloring and half with dried cranberry "scabs". Very creepy result! The reason I gave this recipe a 4 was that baking them was a chore. When the butter gets warm, the cookies spread/swell when you cook them. To keep them petite, you need to roll them very very thin, chilling them before baking, OR roll and bake in small batches, keeping the dough as cold as possible. I think all together I took more than 2 hours to roll, bake and decorate these cookies.

Towards the end, I got tired and made some "bloody eye balls" by rolling the dough in to a ball, making a depression with my thumb and filling it with cherry pie filling. Tasty and creepy! Next year I may make more of those and less of the fingers.

Cookies turned out looking great. Were very easy (and fun) to make. My only complaint is that, after using salted butter plus the added salt in the recipe, the cookie itself was a bit salty. Next time I will make with unsalted butter, or omit the extra salt. But otherwise a fantastic idea!

Ahhh these were so awesome to make and they were delicious! It was actually probably one of the best almost shortbread recipe I've come across and it cooked perfectly. I added green dye to it which gave it a nice green hue, with the red gel. Very easy to shape and the knuckles were a super creepy and awesome effect. Brought it to a Halloween party (makes about 60) and they went fast and people loved it. Enjoy!

These had a great flavor. The dough needs to be chilled so it doesn't turn into a fat, flat finger. Also a whole almond seemed to be too much. A halved almond or slivered almonds were perfect.

While the cookies aren't especially sweet...they are very tasty! I added 'blood' to the ends of mine with cream cheese icing dyed red. They were a huge hit at the party I took them too.

The cookies themselves are delicious! I followed the recipe but used slivered almonds for the fingernail. The decorator gel sets if you refrigerate them. For presentation, I wrapped 4 fingers in squares of roughly cut cheese cloth and then put them in a clear plastic bag and tied with raffia. Very creepy!

I made spooky fingers on Halloween party and many kids loved them. Those fingers looked so real and some kids were scared to eat'em.

Easy and fun recipe.  The overall appearance is better than the flavor, which is a very traditional, not too sweet, but tangy sugar cookie.  You can't use regular sugar cookie dough, because it will flatten - this one keeps it's shape which is why it's perfect for the fingers.  I like the idea of making them green - will try that next time!

This is a great recipe. The almond and jam make it extra special. My 10 year old daughter amkes them using green food colouring in the cookie dough for effect. At Christmas we use the same recipe (with or without food colouring) but shape into rounds and put the almond in the centre. So easy, fun and Yummmmy.

These cookies were fun to make, but  next time I will use my own cookie recipe.  These cookies are very similiar to Martha Stewart's recipe and they lacked a lot of flavor.  I gave it 3 stars because it is a cute idea.

I just made these tonight.  The flavor is spot on for shortbread.  Delicious!!  The only problem I found and the reason I gave the recipe 4 instead of 5 stars is it only took 10 minutes in the oven, not 20-25 min. and I burnt the first batch:(  After the first batch they turned out great!!  Thanks for the recipe.  Will be using it every year:)

As far as presentation goes, this is beyond 5 stars! I made these for a halloween party last year and they were the talk of the night.  However, the taste was very bland.. for a cookie I'd expect much more.  If I make it this year for halloween I'll have to make some alterations, not sure what yet.

This is a recipe that has been made by our family for Halloween for the past 18 years.  We use blanched almonds, and place the red gel around the base of the finger nail after baking.  everyone loves them, adults mostly because they remind them of shortbread.  The kids because they look scary.  They are still made for the grandkids that are now in their twenties.

Truly excellent.  Not only did I completely horrify my bf's girls, I entranced my workshop participants the next day with leftovers and then had a ton of friends on fb ask for the recipe when I posted the pix. This rocked.

I made these last year for Halloween and people loved them. At first they were a little too put off to try one but once they did, the cookies were gone quickly.  Mine flattened more than in some pictures, so they ended up being more like Ogre fingers instead of bony little witches fingers. It didn't change the taste at all though! Nice and buttery-almondy.

Enjoyed baking these with my grandson. We added green food coloring and I had 1/2 pkg of pistachio pudding (dry) so I added that too. Followed others suggestion and rolled REAL thin. Worked great. I thought they were sweet enough. Not every cookie has to be real sweet.

These turned out great - delicious, but creepy-looking. My husband had to close his eyes to eat one. I made some slight variations after reading other reviews. First, I used natural fine cane sugar instead of confectioners. Second, I added a little green food dye to the dough. Last, I used raspberry jam for the "blood." Did I say these were delicious? :-)

This was an easy and fun recipe.  I added some red food coloring and  called them severed fingers.  Everyone was grossed out.  You don't usually want people saying "Ewww" about your food but in this case it was a compliment :)

Tasted good...not great, but good (I have had better shortbread).  However, these cookies spread *a lot*.  To get "fingers" they had to be about the thickness of a pencil before going into the oven. Another issue: because the spread, you could not shape them to look like fingers (i.e. knuckles, wrinkles, etc).  So...I was disappointed...  I will try this idea again...but with a different cookie recipe.

first batch i made the week before Halloween and very good, added the green food coloring. Not all the kids enjoyed the cookie so the next week I bought premade pb cookie dough and added the green food coloring. they did spread a bit but those ogre fingers were just as good as the witch fingers

This was a great idea, although I greatly modified the recipe.  I actually just used a prepackaged bag of sugar cookie mix and followed directions for cut-out cookies.  I added green food color to the dough and used grape jelly for the blood under the "nails." this turned out excellent and was a hit at the halloween party.

Made them for a spooky surprise for my fellow work colleagues.  It was a big hit. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfect.  The cookie is a little plain tasting.  I think I will add a little green food coloring next time to make them more 'witch-like'.  I did tell everyone I made 'finger cookies' and got my ingredients from the county cemetery...lol  I am such a ghoul !

Yes these were a tad bland for taste, but still good and they looked EXCELLENT! Very spooky! But I have GOT to comment on the prep time listed, FIFTEEN minutes??? You can make the dough, roll up 60 "fingers", place almonds on all of them, make lines in them in only 15 minutes? you must be a baker extraordinaire! I followed the recipe totally except part way thru I thought they may look more authentic if green, so I added a few drops of green good coloring to the dough and they looked WAY cooler! Lotsa fun! I'll make them again for sure! HAppy Halloween everyone!

I made these cookies for my daughters Halloween party today. I took the almonds out and the almond extract out due to allergies. i used mint extract instead and then made dark purple icing for the finger nails. I used the rasberry jam for under the nails and green food coloring in the dough. They were such a big hit, the kids loved them

I'm giving this a 3 because of the idea. As for the recipe, well the first time I made it it was so dry it just crumbled and fell apart. . The second batch I made was very sticky but stiff enough to work, I just kept it in the freezer.  I was really disappointed because after all the time I spent in rolling out and shaping the dough, they puffed up HUGE. even with making them about pinky size.  When they baked they didn't harden, were still very soft and bread like, and tasted very salty. If I ever make this recipe again I'm going ot use 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt.  I think maybe a thick biscotti recipe would be good to try to make the fingers with?

These were a big hit at my 4 year old's Halloween party.  I wish they tasted better, but if they tasted better, they'd be flat and undercooked.  Great concept though.  Everybody wanted the recipe, and it was fun making them.

These were difficult to shape and spread a lot.  The kids didn't like them and I probably won't make these again.  I'm giving them 3 stars because one adult enjoyed them.

Always a hit at any party :) Instead of the gel I dip the almonds in red food colouring before sticking them onto the 'fingers' which makes the red goo out like blood :)

We made these for our Halloween party and they were  a big hit...really quite easy to make, it just looks hard. As some of the other reviewers said, make them much thinner than what the recipe says or they turn out looking more like ogre fingers...I didn't have whole almonds so I used slivered and they looked creepy and awesome. I will now make these every year. Thank you Sandra!

No matter what I did to the recipe it would not hold its shape, good mild cookie if flavorings are added.

Oh yea. This was a huge hit for our office bake sale. Sliced almonds rather than whole almonds look more like fingernails and adhere to the cookie easier with the gel.   I had to keep the dough chilled when rolling it into fingers because it gets sticky when it warms up.  Next time I'll try to wrap the dough around something crunchy in the center so it mimics a finger bone.

Most adorable idea!! I also made a thumb and various sized fingers so it looked like a hand was coming out of my cake. The rest of the cookies were snacked on and so good. Thank you!

Such a treat - and so creative! This cookie has an almond-biscotti flavor. Be sure to roll the cookies into a shape no larger than your pinky finger because it will expand while baking. Also, adding green food coloring will make it even more witch-like :)

I made these for a party. My whole family enjoyed making them, we even made other gross body parts. Everybody loved the look. But they grow and do get very big and puffy, so be sure to follow the advice and make them thin and small! They look real. I think you could even try with another dough if this is not sweet enough for you. I will make them again because they were a hit.

Wonderful recipe for kids.  My grandson is 10 & he loved making the fingers.  He has a nut allergy so we used the candy, Good & Plenty, for the fingernails.  This worked perfectly.  The pink & white candies melted just enough to look exactly like finger nails.  We added the red gel after cooking on the severed end and around the nail.  Looked totally gruesome.  I used 1 1/3 cup of confectioners sugar & used unsalted butter.  The cookies tasted great.  Don't forget to add green food coloring to the dough for added effect.

These were fun and easy to make. They were a little on the crunchy side, but the flavor was good. I didn't bother taking the almonds back off after baking, just dipped the ends in strawberry preserves. I added more flour and slightly more sugar to get the right consistency for the dough.

Made these for a Halloween Party the other night and they turned out wonderfully! People were afraid to eat them at first because they weren't sure what the were! But once I assured all that they were to be eaten, they were gone! Warning to those attempting these... TIME CONSUMING! But worth it. Thanks for posting, its a great idea!

I made these for our Halloween party at work, and they turned out so cute and everyone loved them. I did not personally think that they were the best tasting cookies I have ever had, but that's not what we are going for I guess! I read someone's review that they used Strawberry Jam instead of red frosting and they put it on before they baked. I tried this and it did not work, the jam just burned and turned brown, did not look like blood, red frosting after they are baked works better!

I made these and followed the recipe for the cookie part as written and they were wonderful! They were plenty sweet enough for everyone who ate them. (ages 12 - 60.) I did add green food coloring.  OK, I experimented and attached the almond nail's as it was written for some and with the strawberry preserves for some and also baked with the strawberry already "glued" to the finger.  If you decide to bake with the preserves, use parrchment paper because the preserves will melt and makes it difficult to clean your pan.  Removing the almonds and using the red gel was simple and no big deal. Don't be afraid to try.   About the chocolate chip "warts". I addd a wart on some of the cookies while they were warm and screwed up a few. So here is what I did. If you add warts put it on a warm cookie so it will attach and then put them in the freezer to "set". that was you don't end up with a wart smear instead!  I will be making these again. Will use this same recipe for Chritsmas cookies and not make them into fingers.

I took these to a Halloween party and they were a smash. "FINGER-licking good!" I used cornflower blue food coloring to give the look of zombie hands instead of witches fingers and they looked amazing. I also blanched my almonds and removed their skin because I thought it looked more realistic thus much more gross. Finally, the only other change I made was to use a goopy thicker version of royal icing for the blood under the nails because it's been my experience that "red" is not a very tasty color any way you shake it. The royal is sweeter and less of a color blast to your guest's mouths.

A couple of days before our work had a pig out table for Halloween, I told everyone I was bringing "finger food."  When I offered them the "finger food," most really laughed.  They were really knobby, gorey, green fingers!  Some friends refused to try them at all, they were too gross!  One skeptic did try them and was really surprised at how good they tasted, she told me twice.  One woman had made her awesome vampire's costume and I told her that it was a "2 thumbs up" costume and then I opened the napkin with 2 of the fingers.  She laughed so hard.  Needless to say, they were a hit with both the brave and the squeemish.  Next year they might not make it out of the house, my family loved them, too.  Thanks for such a fun to make and eat treat. . . and trick.

My witch fingers were made too big and they spread out to look more like ogre fingers. But, they were green and they looked like "Shrek" fingers. Still a big hit! They looked awesome and they taste great. Thank  you for the recipe. Look for the pic.

They're almost too spooky to eat!  I put mine on a tray with crushed oreos, gummy worms, and the spooky eyeballs from this site.  I drizzled some thin red icing over the top for added gore.  The result was yummy and scary!  I will definitely do this again next year!  the adults were all impressed and the kids were scared to eat them!

So much fun! My first batch turned out great....the rest got really huge and puffy.  I think it is because after the first batch I realized I didn't add the green food coloring so I worked some into the dough.  I will give it another try, adding the food coloring while mixing the other ingredients.

I used strawberry preserves to stick on the whole almonds and also some on the severed end.  I put in an extra 1/4 c. XXX sugar and decreased the baking powder to 3/4 t.  Everyone really liked the taste - they were adults.  Someone said they were too salty - I didn't think there was anything wrong with the taste - they were GOOD!

I made these for a fund raiser at work, and my co-workers loved them!  The families who came to the clinic and saw them "just had to buy them!"  I added 15 drops of green food coloring to the dough, and had to let the dough sit in the fridge for an hour.  I used a toothpick to draw the wrinkles for the knuckles, and also covered the severed end with the red icing.  My brother requested the recipe, andmy daughter, son, and all their friends wanted to know how to make them.  GREAT HALLOWEEN IDEA!

I make these for Halloween every year. Since i do not like the flavor almond extract gives i use a lemon extract in its place. We love them & they're always a big hit at any party. Also, i add some red gel icing to the end of the finger so that the severed end looks bloody.

Happy Halloween everyone! These are a great Halloween treat for a party. There are a lot of people saying these were not very sweet so a added a few spoonfulls extra powdered sugar and a few drops of green food dye for fun. I also used strawberry jelly and a few drop of red food dye instead of the red gel. Either would work, I just had the jelly on hand already. The recipe made 60 "fingers" exacting for me but I guess it would depend in how thick and long you make them. I'm taking them to a Halloween party tonight and I know everyone will love them.

The cookies flattened out and lost their shape.  The taste is salty and a bit bland so you are cooking these for the presentation and they totally lost their shape.  I am not sure if it was because I cooked them on a stone....I have no idea...Very disappointed

These are really creepy - a big hit at work this week.  I added 2 or 3 drops of green food coloring before adding the dry ingredients.  Thanks Sandra.

my sis-in-law made these last week end.  the flavor was great, especially the almond.  she used a food coloring pen to draw wrinkles on the knuckles and we all thought that a little red gel on the "cut" end would be extra creepy.

Delicious and gross looking!  Perfect for our Halloween potluck today!  I didn't like the idea of pulling almonds off of my already baked cookies, so I took another reviewer's advice and used raspberry jam.  I melted a small amount of it in a ramekin in the microwave, then brushed it on with a pastry brush.  After attaching the slivered almonds, I baked the cookies.  It worked out really well, I'll be making them for a party again tomorrow night!

We added a slivered almond sticking out of the severed end to look like a bone and added red gelto it.....looked great!  The cookies could be a little sweeter, but you're going for looks and they are spooky.

I thought these cookies were great! I took them to work with me and my co-workers loved them! The original recipe isn't too sweet and makes great coffee cookies! But I think for halloween i'm going to add a little more sugar for the kids to taste! Hopefully they aren't too afraid of the cookies to eat them! :)

These are awesome looking cookie. I did add the green food coloring and it really added to the whole witch theme.  I also would have given them a five but the flavor wasn't what I thought it would be.  Very cool idea.

I thought these cookies were perfect for my son's Fall Party at school.  Like the others said they are the sweetest cookie but just enough in my book.  Also what others said, make them skinny because they do expand in the oven.  These will be made again and again I'm sure!

A great Halloween cookie!  They have a good, not to sweet taste.  I added green food coloring to mine.  You can definitely get creative with these, adding warts, extra red icing for blood, etc.  These cookies are gross but cute at the same time!

I made these cookies at home and my family loved them!  I now have to make another batch for a halloween party my mother is attending tomorrow!  I did make the fingers skinny, because they do tend to puff up!  I added green food coloring also! They're fun and I will definitely make them again next year!

would have been a five if the flavor was better. i added twice as much almond extract and vanilla extract plus more sugar, it taste better but not great. i also added about five drops of green food coloring and red gel icing on the end to look like a severed finger. also a chocolate wart! looks awesome!!!

For some reason I had the hardest time with this. My fingers came out so wide,  They spread out....like a cookie does when being cooked. I was so disappointed - If someone has advice for me I would appreciate it because I think they look fantastic!!

I loved the idea and the cookies. I don't know why people always give compliments and a 5 star rating "but add what I do different" These are great for children and are designed for them so leave it as that. I and the children I take care of love these fingers bloody ghost stories and all.

Very easy to prepare.  Using the reviews is very helpful, and a nice feature.  Followed the recipe exactly, adding the green tint, and jam to adhere almond.  Each cookie has it's own personality.  Recipe made 70 fingers of slightly different size. I found 19 minutes was perfect, however, at 19 minutes the cookies were too firm to add the "wart".  Good texture and flavor, like a "Spritz".  Thanks for the idea.

Most of the fingers look green is that a given that there is food coloring in the dough??  Some are green and some aren't, but I didn't see it in the original recipe!

Seriously fun food for a Halloween party.  I brought these to our neighborhood Halloween Happy Hour Party and people were going crazy over them.  Some of the kids couldn't even eat them because they looked so lifelike.  One neighbor took some home to freeze for her 85 year old mother.

I made these for my birthday/halloween party and everyone loved them. They looked awesome and tasted great. I added green food coloring to make them look even better. They were the hit of the party. They do expand so make sure to roll them not to big or you'll get  fat stubby witch fingers unless thats the look your going for. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

These were a big hit for my daughters 16th birthday/Halloween party. Our favorite joke was to bring them to neighbors and tell them we were bringing over "finger food" (cheezy but they loved it).  It's not sweet, more like biscotti which is a nice change from all of the Halloween candy. They were great the next morning with morning coffee.

These were an absolute hit in my daughters classroom. The only thing I did differently was I used melted white chocolate with a little bit of green food coloring for the ooze coming out of the fingernails. These were for a class of 1st and 5th graders and so I thought this would make it a little more kid friendly. They turned out great and very life like! Some of the kids were even scared to try them!

These came out really good.  My family got a kick out of them.  I used green food coloring and used chocolate chips for warts.  Also broiled them on high for one minute (watching the whole time) to give them a light brown aged look.

Not only were these tasty cookies but are so appropriate to the holiday.  I followed the cookie recipe exactly.  I might have made my fingers smaller as I had way more than 60 cookies.  Closer to 100, but no complaints!  For the nails, I used whole almonds dipped in strawberry jam and inserted them before baking.  The almonds had a nice toasted flavor.  I will make these again next year and use the same recipe for other cookies.  Thanks for sharing!!

These cookies look great.  They are easy and fun.  One draw back is the flavor, very blah.  I followed the recipe and think it could use a bit more sugar and flavoring.  For the finger nails I used SLICED ALMONDS.  For the red tips,(before baking) I used red food coloring and a toothpick, then I turned to a Q-tip.  Very festive, but I only used the red on some, the thought of it was too gruesome.  Thank you for the idea.

Made this today, and I have to say they were so easy. What a wonderful recipes, thanks for sharing. I followed the ingredients exactly, I did add a little green food coloring for a spookier effect (think I'll add a little more next time). I used the Almond Accents (from BJ's) for the nails and I did use the red gel for the nail beds. I used a toothpick to make the lines on the finger. Thanks again for the great recipe.

Great recipe I also added green food coloring and make sure you roll them out smaller because the do expand and make fat fingers!

This recipe deserves 5 STARS! I made these last night and brought them to the office for my co-workers and let's just say I'm the star of the day! Everyone is raving and talking about how realistic they look. I substituted Strawberry jam and did not use wax paper to roll the cookie. Instead I rolled them in my hands. I also added half a cup of regular sugar for sweetness. They taste amazing and are the best Halloween cookies! Thanks for the recipe!:)

These were a hit at home ....my son came up with an idea after we cooked the cookies to put those popeye sticks (or cigarettes as some of may remember) on the one end to look like a bone sticking out and putting the red gel there too for the blood effect unfortunatly these become hard when baked so I will definitly will make these aagain and put the sticks in before baking and see how it works

I gave this four stars because I thought these were really bland cookies. I followed the recipe as written and I guess I really should have taken reviewers' advice and added more sugar. As a novelty cookie though, they were terrific! The whole family helped make these and we had a lot of fun. We colored them green, and added the red icing to the bottoms of the fingers so it looked like the fingers had been chopped off. Ugh...GROSS!! Hubby took a batch of these to work and he said they were gone in less than an hour. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was fun! I also used green food coloring and strawberry jam. Very Yummy!

The only problem I had was that the recipe made a small batch. So I tried to double the recipe for the second batch but the dough came out gooey and tasted like homemade playdoh. So I went back to the original recipe and it came out fine again. Not sure where I went wrong... 

I'm dressing up as Snow White tomorrow for a 1st grade class that I volunteer for.  These will make a fun treat to go along with the costume.  Thanks for the idea!

I have made these cookies twice in the last few weeks. They are a little bland for my taste. But, I am sure that I am the majority. When I made them the second time I realized that I didn't buy red gel food coloring. I mixed corn syrup, confectioners sugar and red food coloring until it was the right consistency. I like it better. The almonds stick better and it looks real. I also found out that if you shape the fingers with your hands (only sit in the refrigerator about 10 minutes), they take on the shape of your knuckles and look really spooky and look more realistic.  I took add the green food coloring.  Thank you for the recipe! Happy Halloween!

Took a couple batches to get these the right size. But even the fat flatter ones still came out decent. The dough needs to be refrigerated longer than a half an hour. Might make these again next Halloween.

These are so cool!  We used the green food coloring and my 4yr old had a blast with these.  We ran out of red gel and used the jam, it worked just as well and tasted good too.  We enjoyed the taste, not too sweet, just right.  We will be making these every Halloween!

Truly a great looking Halloween dessert - 5 stars - would make it again with some changes.  Next time will use a rolled sugar cookie recipe since the taste of this cookie was not good.  Will vary the extracts to chocolate and almond.  Used strawberry glaze instead of red decorator gel and it turned out quite well.

These are the SPOOKIEST cookies I have ever seen & made. They were fun to make!!
I used the suggestion & added green food coloring & warts & some mis-shaped ones they were GREAT ideas!! but I must of used too much margarine some went flat & browned around the edges but just reheated a little in microwave & scraped off w/a knife, the red jam covered any mistakes!! GREAT CREATIVE MIND who made this recipe!

Very fun and easy Halloween cookie that actually tastes great! I did not buy the gel for blood, but instead had some of the red chocolate disks on hand. I melted these and used them in place of the gel. It worked very well!

I doubled the vanilla, and added half again as much almond extract and the cookies tasted great and came out so cute!  As another reviewer suggested, I used blobs of raspberry jam to stick down the almonds--great complement to the cookie's taste.

Not only were these cookies delicious, but they were easy enough for my 4 year old to help make.  We used almond slivers which gave a fun claw-like appearance.  We also substituted raspberry jam instead of the red gel for the "blood".  We will most likely make these every year.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is it! This is the 'butter cookie" tasting recipe I have been looking for! I was reading through the reviews and had noticed a few didn't think these were sweet enough, so I had tried to substitue a sugar cookie recipe molded into the fingers....It does NOT work! These aren't really a 'sugar' cookie, as mentioned before it is more like a butter cookie. They have great texture and taste. A bit time consuming to make the fingers, but they are grossly awesome! I made 'stiches' on the fingers with chocolate srpinkles. Very cute! I can't wait to do this recipe for christmas! (Not in the finger mold of course!)

Amazing!!!! these fingers were a big hit at my home. Great consistency, a bit crunchy but not hard. The only objection was their lack of flavor, but that was probably my fault since i didn't add any almond extract. I'm already planning to make this for christmas, coating them with chocolate or something.. that will give tons of flavor and sweetness to them!
Thanks!!
