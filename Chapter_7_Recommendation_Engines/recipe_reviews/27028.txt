Very good cake!  Everyone thought it was shortcake for the strawberries.  We were in a hurry--we used an electric mixer, and the cake was done within an hour.  We doubled the recipe and used two nonstick pans-one greased with pam, one ungreased.  Only the one in the greased pan came out cleanly.  Make sure your pans are very well greased.

This is a great recipe- although when I was making it I "accidentally" added an extra 1 cup of milk! I don't regret that mistake; every time I make this cake I add an extra cup of milk. It makes it very moist and very delicious! I hope this helped!

Loved it!  Similar to a sponge or crumb cake.  Delicious even using margarine instead of butter.  Make sure to beat the sugar/butter (or margarine) for a long time to incorporate air - it makes the cake come out light and fluffy (do not beat to much after adding flour though).  Added only 1 Tb more milk.  My husband said he "couldn't stop eating it."  It is plenty sweet - sweetness just right.  Baked it in a sprayed 8" sq glass pan - still gooey at 30 mins so I baked it 10 mins more (40 mins total).  Will make this again!

A very good cake to enjoy with coffee or tea. A word of warning: this cake needs parchment paper lining. I didn't use it the first time and it stuck to the pan.

This is a wonderful recipe.  It makes a nice sized cake for snacking or a small party.  It isn't too sweet which is wonderful for tea & coffee.  Its texture is similar to pound cake, but I wouldn't go so far as to state that it's "very dry & dense"...just a slightly heavier texture than your standard cake.  I imagine it would turn out badly if it were overmixed -- I stirred in the flour & milk by hand so that wouldn't happen.

Excellent St Patty's Day finish! This cake was moist, delicious and stayed that way for a few days. Just sweet enough to enhance your tea and leave a nice aftertaste. Before sprinkling on the confectioner's sugar, my wife put a little cinnamon-sugar on top! I recommend this one and we'll be making it again. If you're adventurous, poke some holes in the top of your slice with toothpicks and then douse it with some Bailey's Irish Cream!! It will soak right into the holes. Ohhh Yummmmmayy!! (-:

this was very tasty, although a tad bit "dry".  i topped it with sliced strawberries and chocolate sauce.  i think the "dryness" of the cake  is not necessarily a downfall, as it will stand up wonderfully under juicy fruits, or sauces without becoming soggy.  will make again for sure.

I was looking for an Irish dessert to bring to a potluck.  This far exceeded my expectations.  It was perfectly moist, amazingly easy, and is made with on-hand ingredients.  This is the perfect treat to make in a pinch or for any reason at all.  You may as well make two!

I've made this teacake so many times that I've actually lost count; it is so tasty! All I do differently than the recipe says is I add an extra cup of milk, which makes it perfectly moist. Hope this review helped!

I loved this recipe! I only signed up to be a member of this site to say it! I made one change and that was that I made this recipe in a muffin tin. I shortened the cook time to 25 minutes and then topped it with fresh strawberries and black berries in a glaze. (Fresh whipped cream to top of course).. Oh my.. I should have made a double batch!!!

Very good! I did as someone mentioned whipped the butter very well. Used 1 c. milk rather than 1/2 cup. It took about 10 more minutes of cooking time, but came out very fluffy and moist. Today tried it with Irish Cream and that was fantastic!

My family absolutely adores this recipe! Every time we have an occasion, we make this cake. We make a delicious berry sauce to go with it - just raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, "43" licquor, and sugar. It's to die for, especially when served with BlueBell Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. Yum! Thanks, Cindy!

I really enjoyed this cake. I lined cake pan with baking paper on the bottom only and it came out beautifully.  It has a lovely taste and I agree it is better if you bake it a day before you want to use it. Cheers

Very nice cake. Second time around I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added about 1/2 cup raisins. Tasty!

Lovely cake!  Was craving "seed cake" after having read about it in a novel.  Found this recipe & tweaked it only by adding 1 tbsp of caraway seeds.  Didn't alter any other ingredients, however.  Had to bake it for 45 minutes.  Couldn't wait for it to cool properly before I tried a piece to go with my tea.  Wow!  This one is definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

It is a good cake.It is very good with milk or tea but abit dry by itself.
UPDATE: I made it again last night. I didn't have enough vanilla, so I put 1/2 teaspoon vanila and 1 teaspoon almond extract. It tasted really good, even better than the original.

This recipe worked well for me.  The cake is delicious and has a nice, vanilla flavor.  I added the extra two tablespoons of milk to get the batter to a creamy consistency. This was so easy and my family loved it!

I've made this time after time and it *always* turns out..I like to serve it with lemon curd or, as I'm living in Germany, a smooth vanilla sauce with fresh berries and mint leaf garnish (or candied lemon slices as well) is a wonderful addition in the spring/summertime months.

I was intrigued by half the reviews here, which said MOIST, and the other half, which said DRY-- so I tried it myself!  It is a dense and fairly dry cake, I would say.  There is plenty of butter, so it is a pleasure to eat, and plenty sweet for an afternoon snack.  But moist, or poundcake-like... I would not agree.  It is a sturdy, tasty cake and so easy to make, I will definitely use this recipe again.  Would be especially nice with some strawberries and whipped cream in the summer!!

I made this for my kids school function where you had to bring an ethnic dish.  The Irish folks never heard of it (including my Dad who is from Ireland!) It is simple to make and comes out great!  I make it for bake sales for something different beyond cupcakes and brownies.  Make sure it is cool before adding powdered sugar.  It still will taste good, but the appearance isn't as nice.  Thank you for this recipe!

Delightful recipe! I followed it exactly and 4 drops of green food coloring for St. Paddy's day, and it came out perfectly (I submitted a picture if you'd like to see). Mine took the full 35 minutes to cook and I did not need to add any additional milk. Definitely recommended for a light tea cake! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this in the middle of the night as a surprise to my Irish husband for St. Patty's day breakfast. Not only did he love it so did my kids.  I used whole wheat flour and Splenda as I am diabetic.  It turned out wonderful! It was easy enough to make it at midnight even! To tone down the flavor of the whole wheat flour i added a little cinnamon.  Thank you for sharing this with my family!

Really good cake!  A wonderful not too sweet cake which is a perfect accompaniment to a nice cup of earl gray.  I made three of them this week to serve to company.  It received great reviews.  All the wives asked for the recipe.

two thumbs way up!  tastes like a fluffy sugar cookie, as I would have suspected looking at the ingredients.  It's dense, not too sweet, and really tastes like a sugar cookie!  Would be great with some fresh fruit.  EASY to make!  Thanks!

A nice ending to our 2015 St. Patrick's day meal.  I only had an 8" pan, so I used it and it took 35 minutes to finish baking.  I served it with thawed blueberries.  I think this cake would make an excellent base for strawberry shortcake.  We had 'Stout Slow Cooker Corned Beef and Veggies' and 'Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread' for dinner, both from AR.

Super easy and super quick. I made this for my art students and everyone loved it. Even the mums took a bite and really liked it. Good thing I have a good memory because I wound up giving the recipe verbally to several people. Will def make again.

Made this for a family St Patrick's Day dinner. It was a HUGE hit! I followed directions, and beat sugar & butter for about 10 minutes, added just a tad more milk (maybe 1 or 2 T) and was sure to add flour & milk alternately ... used Pam Baking spray on the pan. Turned out great ... took a little more than 35 mins to cook, but that could be my own oven. This one is a keeper, I highly recommend!

Easy and yummy. Add more milk like they said because batter was stiff. I like the taste of almond so I added some almond extract to the mix. Turned out very yummy!

Simple to make and no shopping necessary - basic ingredients are used.  I'm hopeless with new recipes, and mine turned out lovely excepting a little bit of stick to the pan.  Yum!

This is an awesome cake - plain with vanilla ice cream is how we tried it out, but I'm looking forward to drown it in Irish cream!  I actually replaced baking powder with baking soda, purely by mistake, and it still survived the roommate review board!  (That was when it was drowned in ice cream - I don't advise the soda!) I hope to make it the right way next time...

I made this at the nursing home where I work- for 50 servings and used margerine and the powdered sugar/cinnomon topping- it worked out great! (although the diabetics were only allowed a very small piece) Everyone was asking for the recipe!

This recipe is great if you want something that is moist and not too sweet. The perfect cake to serve after dinner with a scoop of ice cream and a cup of tea. Would also be good with a citrus glaze pour over top.

Plain and yet tasty, but be warned that it is quite dry and dense.  My kids, who NEVER eat cake, loved this and I am making a second one today.  

I had trouble getting it out of the pan, which was properly greased & floured.

Just back from a St Patrick's potluck where I brought this cake. Great success and yes it was "moist" enough for the party's taste ! Following all the advices I did double the milk quantity. I also choose to stick with the vanilla flavor ( but shall definitively try next time with the almond flavor). Now to make it REALLY Irish I had added in the dough 1/2 cup of whisky and some candied green cherries :-)

This cake is understated in its simplicity. But, sometimes, a nice simple cake is all that you need. This recipe is not too sweet and had a nice delicate crumb (I ran out of all-purpose flour and used cake and pastry flour for half of my flour content). Once this was served, I found it difficult to stop eating -- especially when I added whipped cream and strawberries to it. I'm not sure how "Irish" this recipe is, but it's certainly one that I'm keeping! A great addition to our St. Patrick's Day menu at my house!

Mine sank in the middle; I was left with a fully risen ring around the edge and a one inch high center. I have no clue what went wrong, as I thought I followed the recipe exactly.

Oh well it still tasted good.

Easy and delicious.  I greased and floured the pan and also lined the bottom with parchment.  I mixed the wet ingredients well, but only lightly combined the dry with the wet and the cake came out very moist and not too heavy or dense.

Easy to make. However it didn't taste as good as we thought it would. We substituted oil for the butter and that might be what made it taste not so good. And yes everyone is right use wax paper with oil spray or parchment paper on the pan because it does stick even on a non-stick pan. We iced ours with 2 cups of confectioners sugar and the juice of two limes which I think helped with the overall taste of the cake. Next time I think I will do what another reviewer did and use strawberry jam inbetween layers.

Really quick and easy.  Used a tablespoon more of milk, as directed.  Left off the confectioner's sugar. and topped with whipped cream and strawberries just before serving, as other reviewers suggested - it was delicious.

Great recipe!  I made this for St. Patrick's Day this year and served it with sweet cream and strawberries- best cake I've made!    I had some egg whites left over from making mousse and didn't want to just toss the perfectly good egg whites- so I whipped to them into soft peaks and folded them into the batter.      I noticed some reviewers commenting that they had found the cake heavy or dense- try folding in some soft peak whipped egg whites.   End result was light and spongy- perfect!

Very good, moist and good crumb. However, it took more like 45-50 minutes to bake. Great dessert for my St. Patrick's day dinner. Served with fresh ice cream, and it was a hit!

Wow...I don't know what I did wrong. I doubled the recipe to make a 9X13 cake but the middle fell completely.  It was done around the edges and raw in the middle.  I was excited about making a cake from "scratch" but it ended up a complete waste of ingredients.  To make myself feel better I baked a "box" cake and it turned out fine.  I am wondering if it had something to do with being at a high altitude.  Any suggestions out there?

This was very nice.  I added some green food colouring to the batter as I made it for St. Patricks day.  It was a hit.

Very tasty, my first cake from scratch and even though I didn't cook it quite enough and the middle fell, it was excellent!

My favorite cake! Quick, easy, and delicious on its own. I also use it as my staple cake for fancier desserts like Tiramisu, custardy cakes, or fruity cakes. Basically any recipe that calls for white cake - use this instead.

First made to the recipe exactly.  This was a great tea cake, flavor-wise.  We did think that it was a bit dry, which does go well drinking a cup of Earl Grey!  I next made it and split the cake, and using a string, cut the cake into two layers.  I spread raspberry preserves between the two layers, and topped with whipped cream.  As soon as I can find some clotted cream, we are going to try it with a lemon curd filling and clotted cream on the top.          
Updated:  I made this recipe again for a very large family dinner;  splitting the cakes in two with a length of string as before.  On the first cake, I used lemon curd for filling with a clotted cream dollop for each slice.  The second cake I filled with fresh sliced strawberries mixed with a bit of  freshly whipped  cream (which I had slightly sweetened with raw sugar).   I garnished that cake with whipped cream and whole strawberries on the top.   Both went over very well.  Now I just need to figure out something for the chocoholics!

I made it for the potluck at work and one change that I made is instead of 1/2 cup milk, I added 1  cup milk and it came out perfect. I added chopped almonds on the top before baking and baked it for 50 minutes.

Very good! It tastes so buttery. I did change the recipe a bit by adding the full cup of milk as others recommended. I only added it because the batter was too doughy, like cookie dough rather than cake batter. I was afraid it would be way too dry for the 40 minute cooking time. Anyway, the cake came out perfect : very tender, spongy but compact. It cooked for about 33 minutes. I lined my pan with wax paper and oiled it a bit. The cake slid right off and no clean up necessary. We had it plain, but I think strawberries with sugar would make it even nicer.

I made this for family thanksgiving dinner. I really liked it and everyone loved it. Someone suggested using more milk to make it moist, but I followed original recipe and it was good. But I will try using more for next time and compare how it makes differences!

Made this dish for the first time.  It was delicious.  I follow other viewer's suggestions and whipped my eggs and butter before I added the flour.  it was a crowd pleaser. Will make this again.

Very good, simple cake. Good for gatherings where you don't want/need a fancy, involved cake. I added pinches of mace and cinnamon and it got rave reviews.

A great tea cake! I didn't change a thing and served it with whipped cream and berries as an option at my St. Patrick's Day tea party. It's great just with powdered sugar on top though...

My daughter made this for a multicultural day for Ireland. This is now a keeper for St. Patty's Day! (We may even add a few green food coloring drops for a festive look!) The whole family and classmates loved it! Beat the butter and sugar for awhile before adding the flour. In our oven, 30 minutes was a perfect bake time. Simple, yet delicious!

I think this was wonderful.  The name describes it well as it's perfect to eat with my afternoon cup of tea.  It's a bit sweet to eat on its own.  I had no trouble with it rising, and I didn't find it dry in the least.   I drizzled a design in chocolate on the serving plate and dusted a pretty design on top of the  cake with powdered sugar.  It looked as pretty to serve as it tastes.

The flavor is wonderful, and it is a nice firm cake. A bit too crumbly for me, but I will make it again and try adding even more milk to the batter. Overall, this was enjoyable with a hot cup of coffee. I added extra vanilla to mask  the cornbread taste, which some cakes have.

Very tasty. Loved the buttery flavor and as stated in the directions added more milk because the batter was stiff and the cake turned out great. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I make this cake often and I always put jam after I have poured about 2/3 of the batter and then pour the rest of the batter. This cake doesn't last more than 2 days in our home.

this was ok. It turned out to be fairly dry & dense, similar to pound cake but more dry. My bf only ate 1/4, i finished it 1/2, and the rest went to the trash ...i may bake it again, if i feel like it, and maybe next time, it will turn out to be moist...like some reviews said...

Wow!  This is one of the best cakes I have ever made!  I substituted the milk with one small container of Stonyfield Farm maple cream top yogurt and used 1 TBS of vanilla.  For a topping I prepared a basic whiskey sauce.

This was a really good cake. I do think I would cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup as it was really sweet. And like a lot of cakes I liked it better the next day. I was not sure just how the cake was going to turn out, but would put it closer to a pound cake type of cake. I will make this again and again as it was very easy and had a good taste.

I put in too much butter (for some reason I thought 1/2 cup of butter was 2 sticks), but it still turned out super DELICIOUS!  A little buttery only because of my stupid mistake.  Came out of the pan really easily (probably because of all the butter).

Lovely! Nice light, buttery taste with a crisp outer crust and a soft moist crumb inside. Goes well with a cup of tea or coffee.

This cake was perfect! I had to add a bit of extra milk to the batter but that was the only modification. It was even better the next day. Great alone but could be a great accompaniment with fruit. Enjoy!

This cake was so easy to make. It turned out beautifully. I wasn't too sweet so I was able to serve it with Irish bananas (on this site) and vanilla ice cream. My husband asked me if I made the cake or bought it! Can't get better than that!

Was testing this recipe as gluten-free for a friend and used oat flour.  The texture was a bit too much like cornbread, but the flavor was /amazing/. I couldn't stop eating it.

I made this cake this afternoon, and I followed the recipe exactly.  Very simple and DELICIOUS.  I've already filed in my recipe folder, as I will make again.  I'll probably try the variation with fresh fruit and cream next time.

This was a very good cake. It was easy to make and a hit at my son's birthday party. I didn't use the confectioners sugar though. I turned it into a small poke cake and several poke cupcakes. The Jello did make it soggy at first but as I intended to freeze it until the party to prevent the whipped cream from melting anyway it was fine. It was not soggy at all after the Jello set up pretty. Everyone loved the 'shark in the sea' cupcakes and the baby shark birthday cake.

Looks good...I haven't tried it yet but i think that it will turn out. The batter was not as runny as cake batter usually is so I added more milk. Only a little bit. I think that this cake would be good with lemon/lemon flavor in it.

This cake is simple enough that my 14 year old daughter can make it.  It turns out great every time, if you spray the pan with Baker's Joy spray you will not have a problem getting it out of the pan. Tastes even better the day after you make it.

Great recipe with simple ingredients. Sweet enough to feed a sweet tooth but not too sweet to go into a coma. I opted for Tahitian Vanilla Bean instead of extract and didn’t powder the top. Super moist even the next day. I’d love to add a crumble top or some strawberry compote next time.

Great recipe! I made it for my mother's birthday and she thought it was fabulous. I felt like it did not need the powdered sugar because we prefer a less sweet cake. Very nice to eat with tea of coffee. Thanks for sharing!

SO EASY!  And it turned out perfect.  This would be a great cake recipe to use as a base for something fancier.  Next time I might split it horizontally then add a layer of lemon curd.  Or maybe add poppy seeds to the batter.  My son suggested trying to use hazelnut or almond flour in it, then adding a layer of Nutella.  The "doctoring up" options are endless.

This is a great recipe . Not too sweet. I used 3/4c buttermilk and 1/4 c water to make one full cup of milk. Didn’t have regular milk. Also i added green food coloring  and made the batter into 6 large cupcakes. Absolutely delicious !!! Hubby cant stop eating. I think we will eat it with ice cream and a little Irish cream over it. Hum!!!!!!

Good cake.  While mixing the batter I could tell that it was too dry so I did add 1/4 C. more milk.  Next time I will use a full cup of milk like someone else said.  And/or use 1/4 C. of Irish cream, Baileys, whiskey, etc.  I also cut down on the sugar to 2/3 C.

I made this today, Valentine's Day, in my heart shaped cake pan. I ran out of butter while making rolled sugar cookies (from this site) today so I had to improvise. I used 1/4 cup+2Tbsp of vegetable oil in place of the butter for this recipe and mixed well. It turned out wonderful even with this slight change. Next time I make this, and there will be many times, I will be sure and have the butter on hand. Thank you so much for sharing this!

This could not be easier to make and the result was a very nice cake.  However,  I thought it needed something more so I poked holes with a toothpick and poured just a bit of Bailey’s Irish Cream over the top.  Next time I will pour a little more!

Not sure if this is traditionally a dense cake, but I substitute the butter for unsweetened applesauce and the result was quite dense.  More of a soda bread texture.  It's still a nice treat with coffee or tea.

Very good recipe. I did leave the raisins out, since I'm the only one in my family that likes them. I even cut the recipe in half and used a smaller cast iron skillet.  I should have made the whole recipe. It was completely eaten by the six of us.

I made this cake for the first time.  After reading all the reviews, I chose to add an extra 4 Tablespoons of milk because I like moist cakes.  I also added green food coloring to celebrate a St. Patrick's Day birthday.
Although it was very hard and crunchy on the outside, it was delicious on the inside.  Definitely a keeper!  Will surely make it again!
Next time, I am going to add anise extract.

Very tasty and fluffy.  Made sure to beat butter and eggs fluffy and added 3/4 cup milk since some reviewers suggested additional milk.

I made it with 1 cup of milk, instead of half a cup, and it turned out great. Sort of a light cakey cornbread consistency, not too sweet, really perfect to have.. with tea!

I tested this recipe out for St. Patrick's Day breakfast, and I was not disappointed. This is the first cake I have ever made successfully, albeit a plain one, but I was so happy with the results! It's incredibly light and fluffy, with just a touch of sweetness, and took only an hour to make. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe came out very well. Other than using artificial vanilla (which I do not recommend), and skipping the powdered sugar, I followed it to a tee. I left it in the oven for 35 minutes after pre-heating, and it was light, and slightly fluffy, much like a sponge cake should be. It was sweet, but not too sweet.

I absolutely LOVE this cake and crave it sometimes. To me it has a great balance between its light flavor and heavier, moist texture. I do beat the heck out of the butter and sugar in my Kitchen Aid mixer because it takes a bit to get the fluffy consistency the recipe calls for. Definitely a keeper that goes great with coffee, tea or any time of day!

Loved this cake! So simple to make and comes out perfect everytime. 

I tried a couple of variations. First made a layer with cracker/ bread/ Oreo biscuit crumbs, cake dough, and topped it with Oreo biscuits/ fruits. Everytime it came out well.

Perfectly delicious!  The second time I made it, I added in some mini chocolate chips (dusted them with flour to keep them from sinking to the bottom of the cake) and folded them in at the end with a rubber spatula.  Also, topped the cake with a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon (which makes it a little trickier to get out of the pan, so make sure you grease your pan well).  Also sprinkled the top with powdered sugar for visual appeal and taste.  This recipe is a keeper in my opinion and can be modified in many ways (different extracts, add-ins such as nuts, raisins or other dried fruits and an assortment of baking chips).  It would also be nice doubled, filled and frosted as a layer cake.  It's lovely as is with a cup of tea or coffee, but definitely versatile.  I'm already conjuring some ideas for Christmas baking. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a great go-to for an elegant tea when cut in thin slices. You can also cut it in nice big slabs  to slice horizontally and sandwich in the fresh fruit compotes of spring and summer. 
I made this exactly as written and pictured for a Mother's day tea. Big Win!

I did not find time to rate it yesterday when I made it and it was finished in no time. As the eggs here are small, I used 3 eggs. Is it possible to get weights? Is it whitish because of less eggs and more milk?

Very easy and quick to make.   You can funk it up (with whipped cream and jam in the middle) or leave it plain and have it with a cup of tea.

It's nothing amazing or unusual - but it is a nice tea cake though.

I love it! Such a simple but delicious cake!!! It was hard to stop eating it! I definitely agree that you can add a bit more milk than is called for- that makes it more moist and just perfect. Highly recommended!

Excellent and very simple recipe.  Ingredients were on hand staples in my cabinets.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't top with the powered sugar.  Instead, I topped with frozen strawberries and ice cream.  Yummy!!!

This was the best tasting cake I have ever made, and I bake a lot!  I served plain the first night, then with strawberries and ice cream the next night, and it was a big hit both times.  I made it exactly as directed and it was flavorful, moist, and absolutely perfect in every way, both in taste and looks.

The cake was moist. Not overly sweet for the amount of sugar in it. Kids didn't care for it, for that reason. Husband and I liked it. Something different and easy to make. Good for company.

I baked it in low attitude of electrical oven with glass dish,it was a little sticky at the end just at the bottom but separated well after cooling
I did not have vanilla extract so I used caramel extract,and added some walnut and 1 tbsp vanilla sugar,
It turned out great!
I also melted smart balance butter and a little bit of canola oil with sugar on stove  instead of butter to make it more healthy,I did not add salt cause the smart balance already had it.
It turns out great i will make it over and over by adding other ingredints,
And iI added sliced almond instead of sugar begore placing it in oven,it took exactly 35 min and it is perfect.

This is one of my favourite cake recipes. Super simple and delicious. The second time I made it, I was out of vanilla, so I substituted almond flavouring instead, and it was still awesome.

First time baker here and I really thought this was an easy recipe to follow. Didn't add anything, but it had a weird corn meal taste to it, but my friends and family enjoyed it.

Absolutely delicious!! I put a light layer of vanilla frosting on top instead of the powdered sugar, but the cake itself is simple, easy to make and tastes great!

This turned out beautifully.  I had 8" round cake pans and that was a bit of a mess in the oven but it still was excellent!
