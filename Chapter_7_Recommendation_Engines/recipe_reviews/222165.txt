This made great beef taco filling. I used this for a pound of ground beef and used a little more than 3/4 of a cup of chicken broth and let it simmer until the liquid was gone, which was about 15 minutes on med-low. This wasn't spicy, but certainly not bland either and it didn't need anything to make it better. I did use the cayenne and crushed red pepper and used kosher salt instead of sea salt. Great recipe, thanks Kathy!

We really enjoyed this seasoning mix. I much prefer it over those pre-made packets. A lot cheaper to make and no scary "filler" ingredients. FYI - this recipe seasoned one pound of meat perfectly. Thank you!

It's better than the package stuff, but, like almost all of the other recipes it's missing the sugar. That's the "missing" ingredient everyone tries to find. The packages have about 4g's of sugar per TBS. That's what balances out the heat and amplifies the seasonings.

Giving it 4 stars because i haven't cooked with it yet. Just mixed it up and tasted it. Did one sub - used smokey paprika instead of regular - really gave it good flavor! I changed the servings to 50 so i could get a whole jar full to last me a month or two so used 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes since i wasn't sure how much a pinch was and wanted to keep it mild for my younger children. Can't wait to try it. So glad to find a recipe without cornstarch/flour/sugar!

Great taco seasoning....and yes....I do love that I can control the salt. I used regular chili powder and omitted the cayenne and pepper flakes so my kiddos would eat it. Used this mix in a pound of extra lean ground chicken to top nachos. I only ended up using 1/2c of water as well. Delicious and thanks!

This isn't just a great spice mix -- it's also a great spice rub for beer can chicken or just a whole chicken that you roast in the oven. Coat your chicken with butter or canola oil, then press the spice rub in. You'll probably need to triple or quadruple the spice amounts to cover an entire chicken, but the end result is a chicken that tastes like no other. Yum, yum!

Great seasoning mix.  As good or better than the package Old El Paso that I normally buy.  I added the seasoning after fully browning the meat and draining the grease.  I used a cup of water and let it simmer down for about 10-15 min.

This is a great, easy to make taco seasoning.  I made a bigger batch, filling 2 small mason jars.  My wife and I like our tacos a little spicier, so I added a little bit more cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper flakes than it calls for.  It was excellent, 2 tbsp. of mix and 3/4 cup water to 1 lb of ground beef.  Lots of good spice and flavor, highly recommended.

Loved this recipe!  I've tried some other "homemade taco seasoning" that "tasted" like the store bought, but they were not that great.  This one is the closest I've come to it.  Great flavor. I used just regular chili powder b/c my kids don't like spicy and used beef broth for my water and let it simmer for a while....this is now my go to for taco seasoning...Thank You!!!

I love this recipe. I have tried many but these amounts seem to come together the best for my taste. The main one that needed pleasing was the hubby and he loved the taste of his tacos with it. I also sprinkled it all over chicken breast after they had been rubbed with olive oil. I then baked them in a 350 degree oven. They were fantastic!

Thought it was better than the pre-packaged stuff but it didn't wow me. We thought it was good but, after reading the reviews, we were expecting it to dazzle us. Not impressive, but good.

Awesome recipe.  I made into a marinade by adding olive oil and touch of vinegar and water.  Marinade about 1 hour.  The chicken was very tasty and flavorful. thanks for the great recipe.  Made for great Super Bowl tacos.

Made this for navajo tacos while the grandkids were here.  I held back a fourth of the chili powder to keep it mild for the grandkids, and left out the salt (to start with) for my blood pressure.  After simmering it in the meat with half the water listed for some time, I sampled the meat, and found it disappointingly bland.  So to try to improve it, I added some seasoned salt, which made it a little better.  Since it was still quite wet, I simmered it longer to reduce the moisture.  Once the water was simmered away, HOLY COW!  Night and day difference!

This was really great! Tried it when I had planned chicken soft tacos for supper and realized there was no taco seasoning. Easily whipped up with spices that were readily on hand. Didn't have cayenne and only had smoked paprika, also added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to get a thicker consistency.  Brilliant Thank you!

This had just the right Tex-Mex flavour.  And it is nice to be able to control the salt, and adjust the heat up or down according who we're serving.  My hubby and I like it hot, bot not all our friends do.  I'm sure not buying the commercial stuff anymore!

In addition to the seasonings above, I also add a small can of tomatoes to simmer with the ground meat for a few minutes after the meat has been cooked up and any fat has been drained. Much better tasting than those prepackaged seasoning packets!

This made delicious taco meat. I didn't change anything. My husband who doesn't usually like tacos enjoyed the tacos made with this seasoning.

this is a great taco seasoning.  I doubled the recipe and it seasoned almost 2.5 lbs of ground beef perfectly.  I added 1 1/14 cups of water and the seasoning mix after browning and draining the meat and cooked for an additional 15 minutes or so.  Was awesome, will use this every time we make tacos now.

Fantastic! I triple, or even quadruple, the recipe because we eat a lot of tacos. Sometimes I add ancho chili powder if I have it.

Made this the first time as written.....I did need to use more than what I would normally use to season our meat. But then we like it really hot! Just made 100 servings (fills a 1 quart jar perfectly) We're from Cali so we have many different chili powders to choose from, so for the chili powder I use 1/2 Pasailla/Ancho and 1/2 California/Anahiem chili powders, instead of cayenne and red pepper I use a good portion or Abrol chili powder which is a bit hotter than cayenne but has more of a "Mexico" flavor. You can pick up all these different chili powders at your local Mexican/Latin market for about $0.89! If you haven't shopped at your local Mexican store do your self a favor and go there!!!! All kinds of spices, produce, and fresh cut to order meats for about 2/3 the price of the big supermarkets! Spices and produce less than 1/2 the cost!

I needed a quick taco seasoning mix to add to the Slow Cooker Taco Soup found on this website.  Made this exactly as instructed, with all spices shown.  It was the perfect amount for seasoning, proportions are right and is equivalent flavor to a 1.25 oz package of commercial taco seasoning mix.

Great recipe.  I added a little more heat and a little more salt.  It's delicious.  My only wish is that there was some guidance as to how much to add per pound to the meat.  Luckily I cooked my meat in three batches and was able to dial down the seasoning on the final batch so I could mix it all together.  Don't get me wrong though. It's great to have a tasty taco seasoning mix that doesn't have all the junk ingredients that the packaged stuff has.

UPDATE:  I've been using this on just about everything.  It's great on eggs, on meat, stir it in with avocado to make quick guacamole.   I finally made a big batch of it and put it in an oversized canister so I can shake it as a spice when I cook.

UPDATE 2:  For Christmas this year I made a big tub of this and put it in canisters and gave it away as gifts, calling it "Dave's Famous Meat Rub" (a play on Famous Dave's).  I've had lots of great feedback from family and friends.  They've been putting this seasoning on just about everything.

I discovered this recipe after I had my heart attack. (I was looking for something low in sodium.)I have omitted the salt and adjusted the amounts to my own tastes. Okay I don't really measure I just toss in as much as I feel like that night. I do have one suggestion, instead of using water when you make your tacos either use the broth of the meat that you are cooking or beer, I use Dos Equis when I have it.

I quadrupled this recipe and used 2 1/2 tbsp. to make beef fajitas for supper.  I sliced red and green peppers and a yellow onion into 1/4 inch slices and then sliced up l lb. of sirloin steak and added the seasoning and a little olive oil.  I let it marinade for about an hour and then cooked in a sizzling hot cast iron frying pan.  They were delicious.  I could add some ground chipotle pepper for a little heat.  I might do this next time.  With my home made salsa and a dab of sour cream it was a delicious supper.  I stored the rest in a glass jar in my spice cabinet.

Well it does smell really good. However maybe its me. But its a bit bland. I was waiting for an oinion or garlicy flavor but nothing. Even adding extra spiced to it didnt do much. I suggest maybe fresh oinion and minced garlic instead sauted first then added. Btw i used very little salt like a half a teaspoon.

Perfect taco seasoning for my kids with just enough kick, not too much, not too little. My hubby and I can kick it up a notch with a little more chili powder, cumin, and cayenne after we get the kids portions served and it's perfect for our spicier taste buds as well!  GREAT Flavor, not bland at all- even without the hotter spices. Tastes a lot like McCormicks (which is my family's fave) but I take comfort in it being made by me...so MUCH healthier and no hidden ingredients!

I liked it and will make it again, but I think I'll add more cayenne, red pepper flakes for a spicier flavor.

A great alternative to pre package taco seasoning. However, I did have to make a few adjustments. I added the salt separately and a small amount at a time to ensure it wasn’t to much. I also added a little more cumin and added cilantro. My son couldn’t tell the difference. I definitely will be using this again.

I will never buy packaged again! Inexpensive to make and easy to make taste to personal preferences (more garlic, less pepper etc). Its great. I had to use more water and let it simmer to get flavors to soak in. Love it.

I used chili powder versus hot chili powder and just a very small pinch of cayenne, and for me it still had a little kick.

Only thing I don't put in is red pepper flakes (it's a texture thing for me-I hate biting into something and getting seeds). I love this and won't go back to premade seasoning, and it's nice to know what ingredients in which amount are going in. I just need to experiment and figure out if the ratios hold up if made in much bigger batches, because we go through this like crazy in our house! Highly recommended.

Reviewers that give a low rating after changing so many of the ingredients really annoy me.  I've made several different taco seasoning mixes from this site and narrowed it down to my two favorite.  Today I made both of them so I could do a side by side comparison.  I'm kind of obsessed with garlic so I doubled it in both recipes. This one is the winner!  It has a good depth of flavor, very tasty.  We're having taco salad for dinner tonight and I'm so looking forward to it!

I discovered how much better and cheaper “make your own” taco seasoning is a few years back when I went to grab a packet out of the pantry to learn that I was out. I have always used Allrecipes ‘Taco Seasoning 1’ and thought I’d try this one for something different. I think the other recipe has more flavor so will go back to it. This one is good and the  ingredients are things most people have on hand, and it would be easy to alter for personal taste.

This is my favorite taco seasoning I have made so far!!  I tripled the recipe so I'd have some for later and used about 3 Tbs for 1 lb. of meat.  After you add the seasoning to the meat and stir it all around really good add about 1/4 cup of water with a little flour stirred into it.  Keep adding more water if too thick and let cook for about 10 minutes or so.  Perfect!!

Excellent flavor.  I used minced onion instead of onion powder, and used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of water after the meat was completely browned.  Worked great for the casserole I was making that called for seasoned taco meat.

Awesome! I went for the 'mild' version as I was feeding kids-- omitted the black pepper, red pepper flakes, and used regular chili powder. I mixed into 1lb of ground beef, added about 1/4c water, mixed together and heated well. It was delicious. I will never buy taco seasoning again.

This works. I'm allergic to onions, among several other things, and can't eat in restaurants any more. I missed Mexican food so much! This is tasty and easy and I make it in humongous batches then store it in a jar. Gluten free, too, which the packages versions are not. No down side!

Try using Ancho Chili Powder and/or Chipotle.  Got into a pinch, found I did not have a premix so I tried this.  Won't be buying any more of the premix except for travel situations where I dont have my full spice cabinet!

I use this recipe all the time now. I have never been a fan of pre-packaged mixes and so this is a very good substitute. I did not change anything in the recipe and I'm satisfied with the results.

I stumbled upon this recipe when I was making tacos and discovered that I didn't have any store bought mix in the house.  I made this and discovered that this was way better.  I keep a batch in the house at all times now.

Great taco seasoning! My family loves it with all the optional ingredients, too. We use it to season both taco and burrito fillings. I especially love that there's no MSG (like in the store-bought junk).

We wanted more heat and salt. As Texans are used to more cumin as well. Thanks for posting because we enjoyed it with small modifications.
Added another 1/2 tsp of chili powder; about 1/4 tsp more cumin; more salt; more cayenne; and 1/3 of the paprika was the smoked paprika. Cooked it the way she suggested but added 2 tbsp tomato paste into it as it simmered low with the water. Worked out very nicely and no MSG. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I really like this.  It's a good balance of seasonings and it's fun to know the oregano came from my garden.  I mix it all up in my coffee grinder or processor depending on the batch size.  I'll never buy the blue bottle again :D

I thought that this was wonderful.  I would definitely use again!  I substituted smoked paprika and Ancho chili powder for those called for in this recipe with a great result. I also used this mix in my refried beans - also very good!

It was lovely, omitted onion salt coz didn't have any. & switched red pepper flakes for chilli flakes. Ate it with mince baby boiled potatoes & courgette with garlic cloves chopped all on the pan. It was a bit hot for me so added natural fromage frais. I'll use this again. Melissa

I used to purchase taco seasoning from a "boutique" spice shop locally, but after stumbling upon this recipe I don't bother.  I love this recipe.  I amped it up a little with some extra Cayne and Chili powder, but other than that this one is good to go.

The recipe goes with one pound of ground beef.  I used 93% lean ground beef.  I used no cornstarch or flour.  I added just over 1/2 cup of water, brought to a boil, then simmered until all the liquid cooked away.  This recipe stands on its own, and it's nice knowing exactly what is going into my dish.

Made this in an effort to find an alternative to high sodium store-bought  seasoning.  My grandson didn't like it; he  thought it was terrible when I used only part of the recipe  to season the meat.  Then, when I added the rest, he said it was too spicy.  I didn't particularly like the flavor, either.  It wasn't terribly spicy, in my opinion, but, it didn't have much flavor, either.

Great, well-balanced seasoning. The flavor will vary dramatically depending on what type of paprika you use!! I added a little extra cumin.
Will def use again! Thanks!

For those who make it in bulk- use 7T per 2lbs of meat.

Loved it! Wanted tacos and didn't have any seasoning so AllRecipies to the rescue! Found this recipe lickety split and 30 minutes later we were feasting on absolutley delicious tacos! Yippee, this is now my go to seasoning. I didn't have any oregano so I subbed in Thyme and it worked great. Also, another reviewer said she used 3/4 chicken broth instead of water, so I did that too. I browned and drained one pound of ground beef, then added the seasoning, 3/4 cup of chicken broth and stirred until it came to a boil. Lowerd the heat to simmer for about 10 more minutes. Everyone loved them and went back for seconds and thirds! Bye bye little seasoning packets I have need of you no more!

I made it as directed and it was tasty and much cheaper than the one you buy.  Also can be used in other recipes to add dimension or just a change. Try on chicken breast and bake in oven then add sour cream and maybe even some taco sauce.

No substitutions and made a taco salad with lean ground beef.   Really liked the flavor of this seasoning mix but admit it’s so much easier to buy the little packets!  I agree with another reviewer that this is much less salty than the purchased seasonings!   I saved it and will return to it again and again!

This is the perfect Taco Seasoning mix by far.  So much tastier than the envelope mixes in the grocery.  I've made this numerous times and it's a no fail.  It's much more inexpensive than the mix in the grocery & far better!  ENJOY my Taco friends!

Made it exactly and it was amazing! I might add like 1/4 teaspoon rubbed sage next time, but I was skeptical about turkey tacos and this seasoning has officially turned me on to them.

I had family staying for New Year's and threw together this taco seasoning.  Family thought it was really good on ground beef, BUT husband didn't like it.  I think he prefers more chili powder and less cumin!

This is it. The perfect Tex-Mex taco seasoning. I skipped the pepper flakes and reduced the salt (because I had already seasoned the beef with salt), and it was exactly what we were looking for. :-)

My husband and I both really enjoyed this mix.  I was a little too generous with the cayenne and red pepper flakes, so I will scale back a little bit next time--and there will be a next time.

I did as it said but it tasted like it needed something maybe because I used venison meat and venison tends to be more of a stronger flavor that beef.  I'll try it next time with beef and see how it is.

I've been using this recipe for a few months now, and it's great! I started with making one family meal at a time, usually using ground turkey, and now I make a full mason jar (40 servings) every few months!

Very tasty as written. I added a bit of sugar as per some other reviews and it's a real hit at my house! No more sodium rich prepackaged mixes for me! The meat does not develop that gooey texture that the cornstarch or whatever in the packages does either!

Better than store bought. But you need to double recipe when making 2#!of meat.

I love this recipe! It’s so simple and much cheaper and healthier than pre-made packets. I use this seasoning to make the chicken taco filling on this app. Just mix the seasoning with 1 cup of chicken broth and pour it over 2-3 chicken breasts in a crock pot. By dinner time the house smells amazing and you have perfect shredded chicken taco filling.

I love this recipe and have been using it instead of a store-bought version for ages.  I make a triple (or quadruple) batch and store it in a jar since we use it so much.  I even put it in my chili.  The only change I make is that I cut way back on the salt.

Perfect.  I  omit salt, cayenne and red pepper flakes and add these in when finishing the ground beef, according to the tastes of those eating the meal.

I do not make tacos on a regular basis and do not have premade taco seasoning on hand when I really want tacos. This recipe gives me all the ingredients(spices)needed when I do make them. I don't make a big batch of the seasoning, just add  smaller amounts to my meat when I do make them. Works well for me.

I usually make Taco Seasoning I from this site, but I needed something much more mild for grandchildren. This is perfect with regular chili powder and without the optional ingredients. I'm certain that with them, the taco seasoning would pack in much more heat! I followed the instructions for cooking it with the seasoning and then adding water. Perfect!

This was excellent for the Mexican Pork Chop casserole from this site. However, I have chili powder in my spice pantry that comes from the ethnic aisle of my grocery story. It is VERY HOT! 2 teaspoons was 1 1/2 too many.  Next time, cut back on that if using the same chili powder.

I have made this a number of times now.  Way better and cheaper than any packaged stuff.  Basic recipe is great.  Also very easy to adjust for personal tastes and dietary needs.  I lower the salt a bit and up the chili powder and cumin.  Hubby is super picky and devours anything I put it in.

One batch is approximately equal to one packet of taco seasoning, so it will season about 1 lb of meat. No mystery ingredients, no carbs... No reason to buy those packets anymore.

Thank you!  Just what I was looking for.  Those packets are way too salty for me.  The recipe gave me the ingredients and ratios.  I adjusted the amounts to my liking , meaning more garlic.  I quadrupled it and added 2 teaspoons of brown sugar.  Very good!

This is the best taco seasoning recipe I've found. My husband has a kidney problem, so I leave out the sea salt, since he can't really have  any. That's the only change I make in the recipe, but it still tastes fantastic. I can't count the number of times I've used this recipe for taco nights.

Excellent flexible recipe.  No more packets for me!  Allows you to adjust the "kick" for adults or children.  While we made Tacos tonight, I can see it being excellent as a rub, or a marinade.  Planning on trying it as a marinade for chicken next!  Thanks for providing us with an easy, great recipe!

This was my first time making taco seasoning. It tasted very fresh and delicious even with all dried ingredients. My husband said it had a good smell. I added the 1/2 cup water to the pound of hamburger after mixing in the spices I combined and stirred as a whole beforehand. The 1/2 cup water rapidly cooked in at the end. I had my old induction burner set just above medium the whole time. I used refrigerated pre-made tortillas I fried up a day ago with Mexican cheese and salsa. Soooo delish!

I love this homemade taco seasoning for several reasons!  The first-is that I already had these spices in my cabinet so I didn't spend extra for just taco seasoning. The second-in-command I have people in my family that cannot eat wheat, regular taco seasoning has wheat so I hae to buy gluten free, which costs more and is exactly what I made using this recipe! Thank you

I made this with ground turkey. Flavorful yet suttle. My 7 year old was able to handle the mild spice and she asked for 2nds, so this deserves 4 stars.

Nice and easy to control the level of "heat". I routinely use this instead of the prepackaged spice as I know what I'm putting in this taco spice.

I've made this several times now and the recipe is spot on. The only change....I do add 1 teaspoon of white sugar, it does balance the spices/ flavors. Great recipe I will continue to use.

Great as is or as a starting point for whatever your heart desires in your taco seasoning.  I make this in large batches so it's available whenever I need it.  I'm a vegan so I use this with tempeh and tofu.  Delish!

This worked great for Salsa Chicken, a baked chicken recipe on this site. It had a great flavor. I think I'll stick with a different recipe for making ground beef tacos though--I prefer one with a little flour or cornstarch and some beef bouillon. This was good though.

This is a very good beef taco seasoning recipe.  It reminds me of the Old El Paso taco seasoning.  I use it with 1 lb of beef and adjust if we are making more.  We add an extra 1/4-1/2 tea spoon of cumin for our taste.  We will make again.  I noticed I don't get the indigestion with this mix vs. the store mix and this version has less salt.

I used it for the first time in my veggie ground round to substitute for ground beef as our family is trying to eat less meat to help our planet and improve our health overall.  It was awesome and we couldn't even tell the difference - strictly flavour!  I also liked the fact that you can control the heat and salt, plus there was no corn starch which was a bonus - no GMO's!  I added about a cup of water to the mixture after dry frying it for a minute and it just thickened to a saucy consistency just on its own.

Perfect for tacos on a budget, or for a base for something else. I wouldn't leave it as is, but it gets me close enough to what I want, that I can make something really good for pretty much nothing.

Better than seasoning packs.  I omit the salt. Only use 1/4tsp oregano and bumped up the pepper flakes to 1/2tsp.

This mix was good, not out of this world. I didn't use it as taco seasoning. I used it when I cooked beef, pork or chicken which mostly was used in burritos or other casserole dishes. The final comment, I will make it again.

I enjoyed the recipe added a little less salt for family members and a little more cyan pepper and pepper flakes because they prefer it a little spicier. I also added more cumin for aroma.

Very tasty!  I used this with a pound of ground beef and about 3/4 cup of water.  Such a great alternative to the packets!

This was very good.  Not hot and spicy.  The next time, I'll add more cayenne to give it more heat.  I'll also try this with a smoked chili powder for a different flavor.  And like others, this seasoned a 1 pound package perfectly.  I broke up the beef in the skillet and sprinkled the seasoning on it.  When that was done, I added a cup of chicken broth and cooked that down.  Easy prep meal!

I made this but had some dried ancho chilies which I toasted in a dry pan to soften.  Then ground them up with the other spices.  I also tripled the recipe which made enough for a half pint sealer.  Now I know what spices are in my Taco blend.

This is my go to taco seasoning mix. I much prefer this recipe over another recipe on this site that has over 4K reviews. I follow the recipe exactly, add about 1/2c of water and a pound of ground meat. Dinner is ready in 15 minutes. Yum!

Great mix! I added 1 teaspoon of masa flour which added a nice corn flavor and helped to thicken sauce. Taste much better then prepackaged mixes and can keep my lady safe because I know there is NO gluten.

I have made this twice once as written and once with half the oregano.  I prefer it with half the oregano. Otherwise a great recipe that stands up with restaurant and prepackaged taco spices. It does it get better if you let it simmer for an hour or so with about 3/4 c water per pound of meat. What a great way to season taco meat without msg!

Wonderful recipe and a great jumping off point for those who like to tweak things a bit. I increased the cayenne and crushed red pepper because we like it hot, added a bit of cilantro to brighten it up, about half a teaspoon, and used the mix in the crockpot over chicken breast for shredded chicken tacos.. Amazing!

This is delicious, much better than the store bought packets. I followed the directions exactly and used it on our leftover beef ribs to make tacos, everyone loved it. I'm going to make a large batch to save.

Wayyy too salty.  I was making this for 2 lbs of hamburger and I added 1 cuo of water.  I ended up having to add 2 tablespoons of flour to take away some of the saltiness.  Only use about half the salt that's recommended.  It is a good recipe though!

This taco seasoning recipe gets 5 stars as written.  It is also very easy to customize to your own tastes.  I increased the serving size to 200 then added 1 Tbsp plus 2 tsp of dried cilantro leaves.  After browning 2 lbs of ground meat (turkey, chicken, beef, pork) and draining off any fat, I add 1 can of diced salsa style tomatoes including juice and 4 Tbsp seasoning mix then simmer until thickened. 

Store leftovers in airtight container for future use.

this is going to be my new go-to for taco seasoning.. i tried it out on bf's daughter's beef alternative crumbles and it came out pretty good.. i think the only thing i'd do differently for chicken/pork/beef would be increasing the salt.. but that's a personal preference.. ty for the recipe

I used this with 2 lbs. of 97% ground turkey so it wasn't so spicy.  I added a little more salt and about a cup of water to steam the meat.  My family thought they were eating beef and not turkey.  Great recipe!

Better than the store bought mixes.  I will be make a few batches and storing in individual bags so I won't have to measure it each time.   I used it with two pounds shredded chicken with 1 cup water and it was perfect.  Not too spicy.

I made my Hot Cheese Dip using Velveeta Cheese, ground sausage, chopped onion, Cream of mushroom soup, Rotel tomatoes and completely forgot to get a packet of Taco seasoning to go in it.   This is now my Taco seasons.  Awesome and since I use No Salt rather than salt I substituted and am pleased.

I made this out of necessity tonight. I wanted to make a recipe from this site 'taco pie'. Realized I had no taco seasoning. I had everything on hand for this except ground cumin. I only have cumin seeds and wasn't sure if I could use that so I just omitted it. This was good. Definitely better than buying a packet of taco seasoning from the store since the ingredients list stuff I can't even pronounce.

It's a good start to the same flavor you get out of the packets, but the texture isn't quite right.  To fix this, add about a teaspoon of corn starch to the mix, and add the seasoning mix with 1/2-3/4 cup of water to the ground meat of choice, allow to thicken and serve.  It'll be much closer to the 'saucy' style you're used to out of the packet - think of the difference between a burger and a sloppy joe's texture.

Note that many of the major brands also use a bit of sugar in there, so if it seems slightly off to you just add a little pinch of that to balance out some of the more assertive flavors in the mix.

Absolutely Wonderful!
My husband is on a no salt diet and we were having a hard time finding a seasoning that would satisfy both of us on Taco night. I found this and our prayers were answered. I just leave the salt out and it's still very tasty.  I have given this to friends that are not only on a similar diet but those who are not and received the same response" WONDERFUL" thanks for giving us this recipe!

Went to make tacos and realized I didn't have any taco seasoning mix packets on hand, so I looked this up real quick and tried it. The meat tasted so delicious, and it was easy and quick!

Great recipe! Used regular chili powder but left in the cayenne pepper, not too spicy, the kids liked it and said it was better than the store mix.

We loved it. Had a great flavor. Most store mixes tend to have way more salt than I like so it's very nice to be able to control the amount of salt used. I tripled the recipe and stored the rest in a good spice jar so it's ready when I need it.

I have made this several times and it was good...but seemed it was missing something that the packets have.  I finally figured it out.  Add a little sugar.  I would go light on it then adjust for your taste.  I find a scant teaspoon is enough for our taste.  Another thing I thought of, yet have not yet tried... omit the salt and add a portion of a bouillon cube...type of cube/powder would depend on what type of meat you are using.  You can always add more bullion or salt after you do your taste test.

I used for chicken tacos. I Cooked Cubed chicken breasts and added seasoning with water. Delicious! I didn't use the optional ingredients and I didn't have oregano but it was really good. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I used regular chili powder, no salt as most seasonings add salt, and omitted the cayenne & pepper flakes. I cooked this with diced chicken & 3/4 cup of water.  Tastes just as good as store bought except better because I don't wonder what's in it!

I love this recipe. I cook tex mex food so frequently that I make a huge batch of this every few months just to have on hand.  I recently decided to also add some chipotle powder to it and it was a terrific addition.

I needed a taco seasoning packet for a recipe I was making for Taco soup but didn't have any store bought. I tried this instead. I did not have onion powder so I added an onion flavor cube when making the soup. I also halved the paprika with smoked paprika ( I am addicted to it right now) otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. It was delicious! I need never to buy pre-made store bought Taco Seasoning Packets again!

Fresh and smooth. Ground the mix in my Nutribullet and added 1 tablespoon of flour as one person suggested. I'll not use the red pepper flakes next time. My family likes this mild.

Loved this recipe, discovered I had no taco seasoning and thought I would see if I could find one here on my favorite recipe site.  What I really loved about is that I could make it low sodium by using no salt in place of sea salt.

I omit the salt because I lightly season my meat when I cook it. I love this I can throw it together in a pinch and usually have all of the seasonings in my pantry. It's a little salty for me if I follow the recipe exactly but I like it as a seasoning.

I enjoyed this immensely. I like how the salt is reduced because that means I can increase it to my taste after. I like a specific HELL level of heat so I experimented with adding piri piri peppers (african birds eye) to increase the heat and that was delightful. I may try an add a bit of ghost pepper. 

As a spice mix, it tasted instantly perfectly taco. Great mix. I doubled it.

Just used this recipe tonight, just as it is with both optionals too. Loved it! I figured out that the 4 Tbsp is a little too little for ~2 lbs of meat (which is what I had), but some godly Cholula fixed that at mealtime. Next time I'll make a jar-full and have a better idea of what quantity to use for my meat.

This is a great taco seasoning without all the bad stuff. I like mine with a little more spice so I use hot  paprika, it does not make it super spicy just gives it a little kick!

In a word...LACKS FLAVOR.  We all cook from scratch in my house(teens too).  So I couldn't compare to the packet from store people referred to.  But I love Mexican and eat it a lot(yes!  authentic Mexican)  I could have misjudged quantity.  I used 2T per pound.  I ended up adding additional mix, about 1/2T extra per pound.  Way TOO MUCH water too!  I only used 1/4C and added tomato paste.  But the main problem is it LACKS FLAVOR.  I will have to really make some awesome condiments to compensate for this.  Which I was hoping this recipe would be enough flavor for a quick meal without needing a lot of extras.  It's a good start but needs to be worked...not sure I have time.

This is a great substitute, and I can tweak it. I add half a bouillon cube to the mix. And some red wine and a little,Frontera salsa, 'cause I'm lazy/busy. Can't tell you how many times I've made this mix. I always use Mexican oregano, and if I feel really ambitious, I add a tiny bit of Mexican unsweetened chocolate. Killer.

I love this recipe! I have everything that's needed in my spice rack and it's so simple and easy! I use it all the time now instead of taco packets from the store. My whole family loves the flavors when I mix it with ground beef for tacos. I also used it to make pork burritos! This mix is now a staple in my house!

Excellent. Used it in my taco soup, was very surprised how good it was. So thankful not to have to try to finagle this myself anymore because it never turns out that good... And I refuse to use the store-bought!  Will definitely use this for tacos, and other dishes!

Couldn't find the store-bought taco seasoning, so I went looking for something I could throw together myself.  I had to omit the oregano since I had none on hand, but the family still loved it.

I usually add more cumin to the mix and I use Spanish paprika, which has a rich smokey flavor. It's a great addition and it works for the kids, too, as they don't care for things overly spicy.

I always buy McCormick's taco seasoning because my husband and one of our son's is a Celiac and this brand is gluten free. They were out at the store in our small town, so I decided to make my own. Your recipe is delicious and I was able make it gluten free!!!  My family loved it!  This is our seasoning from now on.

My family likes everything mild so packaged seasoning is always too spicy. This is perfect with half the chili powder and none of the optional ingredients.

YUM!  And very affordable!!  I already had all the ingredients in my cabinet!!  I doubled the oregano and the cumin, added about 1 tsp dried cilantro and used smoked paprika and regular paprika, both.  It makes it a little spicy, but not too much for the kids.

I really enjoyed the flavor of this mix. It's nice to be able to control the salt and not have to eat MSG. I left out the cumin because I hate cumin.

Hubby & I love Mexican foods but I was looking for something I could control the salt in as he retains water easily.  This is a great mix!  I used a little less salt, a little more cumin and eliminated the cayenne & red pepper (for me).  He loved it! No more store bought seasoning mix for this household.

I didn't have hot chili powder so I just used ground cayenne pepper in its place. It turned out great. Had a nice kick but not too spicy for me. I also added a bit more cumin. I used it to make chili, it turned out great!

Not bad, it needs a little more chili powder and garlic but I would definitely make it again.

I used this recipe as a base, but used turkey beef, 2 pinches of cayenne, about an 1/8 salt and 1/2tsp of crushed red pepper since we enjoy spicier flavors.  I don't see me going back to store bought. Thank you for this recipe Kathy.

Really good!  I ended up adding a lot more spices as the meat cooked though, so for me, it just needed more.

I loved how simple it was. I did substitute garlic salt for the salt and garlic powder. Will definitely try this again and make a huge batch!It smelled good and the leftovers tasted great the next day. I used it on 2 lbs of  browned Turkey burger.

I bought a packet of taco seasoning at the store, but when I got home and started to make the tacos I couldn't find the packet.  This recipe saved the day! Tasted just like the store one, but not as salty.

I'm a cooking novice, but U can assume any spicy Mexican dish uses chili, while any spicy European dish uses garlic and onion.....so -if you're making spaghetti, use garlic and onion.  If tacos, use chili and onion and a little garlic.  Doesn't matter fresh or powdered, just the amounts, figure 1 tbsn of onion powder = 1 onion.  There are probably more accurate tables online....

I made this to mix with ground sirloin and tomato paste. It was kind of like a Mexican Sloppy Joe. We used it as taco meat. I had all the ingredients and kept to the proportions for the most part. My daughter loved it, and she is the big taco fan. I saved the rest of the mix to use another night.

Liked this recipe and the fact that it's easily customizable to the taste of my family. I used more onion, cumin and garilc and I used the optional spicy ingredients, red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper. I periodically make a big batch to have on hand and store it in an airtight container.

This is an OUTSTANDING recipe!!!!!!  Tried this for steak fajitas tonight!  Holy delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't too spicy for my 3 y.o. twins or 6 y.o.  That is a huge plus to me.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I'm making a second batch next to keep in my pantry. Thank you so much for sharing!!!! xoxoxoxoxo

I quadrupled the amounts and made this for 5 lbs of taco meat for a big get together.  It worked out great! Just the right amount of spices to give it a wonderful aroma as well as a great flavor. I used regular chili powder (instead of the hot) and just bumped up the cayenne pepper a little to compensate. 

Overall I am very pleased with this combination, and will be using it (and variants upon it) in the future :)
