I do not have a grill so made this in a regular frying pan.  It was easy and the taste was incredible. And this from someone who rarely cooks steak. However, I am a professional food taster who works for a large food company so I know good food when I taste it.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Substituted flank steak, as opposed to sirloin.  Excellent taste.  Even better the next day.  Would also try on pork tenderloin.

Very good flavor.  I would not have thought that apricot preserves and steak would go together but they do.  The second time I made this, I used raspberry jalapeno persevere and it was even better. I can't give this 5 stars though because of the cooking directions.  If you grill your strip on a high grill for 10 mins,  you'll have a hunk of carbon.  You want to caramelize the sugars not burn them.   I did a medium direct grill for 6 minutes a side (starting with a hot grill to sear) the strips came out perfect medium. The second time I did a high indirect for 6 minutes a side and the outside was a bit crisp and the inside was pinker.  Very juicy char broil.  I'll do the indirect method again.

What a delicious recipe! Everyone loved this one. So easy to prepare and just outstanding results. We liked this one so much better than a filet mignon recipe I made the night before where preparation took nearly two hours! You cannot beat this recipe. Thanks for sharing. P.S. Served with the roasted potato recipe from this site, the one where you use different colored potatoes. The flavors were a perfect match.

My husband and I didn't care for this.  Although the beef was tender, it didn't seem to have much flavor.  Perhaps the marinade could be adjusted, but as is, I wouldn't make it again.

I used this rub on Ribeyes and let it marinate, like it recomended... 1 hour, and the steaks turned out great!!  They were tender and had a great flavor.  My family raved about it, definately something I will try again!

simple, made with ingredients I always have on hand, quick, tender and delicious.  What more could you possibly ask for?  My grill is out of commission so I broiled the steaks, and they turned out fantastic!

Nice flavor.  The kids said it tastes different.  I wasn't sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing until they proceded to devour it!  I will definately be making this again.

Did not like this one on steak, might be better on pork or chicken but my boyfriend and I were disapointed.  It was edible, just not what we hoped for.

Ten minutes on high heat would have totally incinerated this steak.  I used filet mignon and although it turned out perfectly medium (grilled differently), the flavor just wasn't there for us.  I had high hopes that this would turn out to be extraordinary, but unfortunately, it turned out to be somewhat of a disappointment..

This was delicious! Tender meat with a slight sweet/cinnamon flavor.  However I would consider add a little heat to the marinate for a sweet and spicy taste.  I marinated all day in the fridge and turned out great.

The marinade was excellent. I did add some cayenne pepper to it for a balance with the sweet of the preserves. However, it would be much better on a different protein like chicken or boneless pork chops. The sweet was to much for a strip and really overpowered the flavor of the meat.

It was just OK.  Next time I am going to use brown sugar instead of regular.  The meat came out very tender but the marinade really didn't add much flavor.

it's probably my own personal taste but i did not care for it. the sweetness was too much for me and it just had a wierd flavor. i guess i am just used to "traditional" steak marinades.

I loved this recipe. I had no apricot preserves, so I used hot mango chutney and some teriyaki. Marinated overnight. The meats grilled beautifully and my family loved the flavor. Thank you!

Absolutely delicious.  I did not have Apricot Jam on hand so I used Peach Jam and would definitely use Peach Jam again.  I do love Apricot Jam and will also try that another time.

I really liked the marinade but for me the sweetness didn't pair well with beef. I think it would be really good with something like pork or chicken, which I'll try next.

The taste was really good, though a bit on the sweet side.  Since there would be 4 of us, I doubled the recipe.  I don't know if the original recipe for 2 turned out differently, but the doubled one did not make enough marinade for 4 New York strips.  I would make this again though I would make extra marinade.

OK  EASY. Steak was alright tonight. It's a matter of preference.
It's BBQ season andI like to have different things. So I try  this.
For us , the flavors of cinnamon and preserves, does not go 
with a steak. Meal was fine, good to experiment, but this  isn't our steak flavour.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe! I initially wasn't sure how I would feel about the cinnamon and preserves, but the marinade paired very well with the steak. I made this per the recipe, though grilled on high direct heat initially for a sear and then lowered the temp to a medium indirect heat for approximately 6 mins per side (ended up medium well).

I did this recipe using a 1/2 lb sirloin grilling steak..  Man it was delicious with a hint of apricot flavour.  Definitely a keeper!

I have not made this recipe, but I have eaten in all the major Chicago steakhouses. They all serve their best steaks nekkid. S&P only.

There are lots of variations on this but they're basically almost the same. I personally don't like garlic in mine, I prefer it sweeter. We use shallots and red wine and a seedless blackberry preserve. It adds so much to red meat.

I thought that the flavor would be unique but it just didn't do the cut of steak justice. There are plenty of great tasting marinades on the A.R. website to like,this isn't one of them.

I left out the sugar as there's enough sweetness between the apricot preserve and cinnamon. This was a different style of barbecue sauce season.

It was good, I used venison steaks instead of NYS, would be a better marinade on a lighter meat like pork or chicken.

Absolutely yummy!! Tender, juicy. We used ribeyes. And I threw in a pinch of cayenne pepper. LOVED all the flavors! We also doubled the recipe to accomodate the BIGGER steaks. We bbq'd them just like we always BBQ.
