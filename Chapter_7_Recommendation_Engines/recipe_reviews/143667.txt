These brownies came out great, so fudgy and chewy! Sine there is extra egg in place of the usual oil and no baking soda/powder, the result is an intensely rich, decadent brownie. I used milk chocolate chips and used 1 1/2 c. white sugar and 1 1/2 c. brown sugar. I have found that this adds a more saturated, special flavor. The best way I have found to melt sticks of butter is to place them in a large, microwaveable Tupperware cup and microwave them for 30+ seconds. By doing this, you don't have to go through the hastle of cutting the butter. Also, in place of sifting the flour mixture, all you need to do is whisk it. Whisking produces the exact same effect/texture as using a conventional sifter, plus it is much easier to clean! I highly reccomend this recipe. You have got a winner with this one Brooke!

DO NOT bake this recipe in a 9x9 pan, you will regret it and waste a fantastic brownie batter. In a 9x9,I ended up w/ 4" thick chocolate bricks, so I tried again 2 days later in a 13x9 and got the fudgiest thickest and delicious brownies I've ever had. The top was perfect and did not crack when I cut into squares. This is will be my brownie recipe from now on.

Okay, these were great.  I made 2 small changes.  First, instead of 3C white sugar, I used half/half of regular sugar and brown sugar.  Next, I didn't have semisweet chocolate morsels, so I chopped up some squares of semisweet chocolate.  Worked just fine.  When I cut up the chocolate, alot was in slivers, so melted & helped form a fudgy synergy!  I'd recommend this & I'll definately make it again.  Maybe try pecans next time.  Also, I used the 9x13 pan recommended; but were kind of thin...so I might try a slightly smaller pan next time & see if I can get them a little thicker, without affecting the gooey light texture.

My vote is 3 stars--these are so sweet they make your teeth hurt. Also, these aren't as thick as I'd like. Hubby didn't think they were too sweet, but agreed they could be thicker, so his vote is 4 stars. Between us, this is a 3-1/2 star brownie--merely average.

For some time, I've been on a quest for a recipe for a recipe for the perfect brownie--chewy and fudgy. Recently I made the Barefoot Contessa's "Outrageous Brownies" and another recipe called "Supernatural Brownies," which was featured in the New York Times.  While both of them were tasty,  Brooke's brownies surpassed them.

I would like to add that I didn't alter anything in this recipe.  I did have to bake them a little longer than the recipe stated and was concerned about over baking them, but they turned out perfectly.  The corners (which I usually don't like) were especially delicious and had a nice chewiness to them.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thanks, Brooke!

Delicious!  These are dense and rich!  If you don't like a sweet, fudgy brownie, don't make these.  Most of the lower ratings were due to people decreasing the amount of sugar.  If you want a 5 star brownie, use all 3c. of sugar.  If you want a 3 star recipe, decrease your sugar...its that simple.

My family is a brownie family...and my husband said these are the best brownies he has ever had!  I usually make the ones from a box, and he said these are far better.  They were really fudgy and soft.  I coated the chocolate chips in a little flour before putting them in the batter so they wouldn't fall to the bottom of the pan.

These brownies are incredible! Rich chocolate flavor and oh so chewy - just the way I like them. (I followed the suggestion to use half brown sugar the first time and it was very good, but it was even better with regular sugar. I decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to give it that thin brownie shell on top.

I loved the taste of this brownie and the texture. Seriously perfect perfect fudgey brownies. This is MUCH BETTER overnight as the butter doesn't ooze and the sugar taste becomes more neutral. This is a lot of sugar for my taste so I cut it down to 2 cups and even then it was sweet. Something I learned from a chef I knew: Beat your eggs till they go a light yellow then gradually add the sugar. Mix your cocoa and butter or dark chocolate (with a v high cocoa %) in a microwave or over the stove. Let it cool then fold into the fluffy egg mix and then slowly fold in the flour. For some reason this always ensures I have fudgey brownies and never dry ones.

Worth the hype! Even better the next day. I followed others' suggestions and used 1 c. each brown and white sugars. Since the brownies were for adults, I added 1 tsp. almond extract and 1 c. 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate chips for a more sophisticated taste. These are so moist and delicious--I'll definitely be making these again!

I've tried several brownie recipes from this site and I've found my favorite. Amazing. 
In case you're interested, subing plain yogurt for the half the butter works wonderfully.

Brownies were great as is... but I gave it one star so some people that bake this will catch that when mixing in chocolate chips and baking, your toothpick will not come out clean. Any time over the 40 minutes is going to burn the edges.

I made these on a whim yesterday and boy am I glad I did!  Until now, I've never had much luck making homemade brownies, I'm not sure why.  They just always turned out cakey with mild chocolate flavor.  But I was craving brownies and I stay away from all mixes and anything with preservatives/artificial or processed ingredients so I decided to take my chances.  I read through a lot of the reviews beforehand and this is what I did: 
Despite some people who said these were sweet and reduced the sugar, I decided to try it as written (maybe just a couple Tbls less), because I mean aren't brownies supposed to be sweet?  And in my opinion they were JUST RIGHT, not too sweet but not lacking.  I also added 1/2 tsp baking soda to crisp up the tops just a bit as someone suggested.  I tossed the chocolate chips in flour before adding them to the batter DIRECTLY in the prepared pan (which was partially a mistake, as I forgot to add them beforehand, but actually worked out better because they were all perfectly distributed without sinking more to the bottom).  I baked them 30 minutes at 350 instead of 35-40 as some people stated, watching for the edges to just start pulling away from the sides.  The result was a deliciously fudgy, chocolatey, chewy brownie that would make a boxed mix cry in shame.  Thank you, Brooke, for a wonderful recipe!

Delectably rich and chewy brownie with a perfect, crusty surface. If you like a sweet, chewy, dense brownie, these are the ones for you! I followed the recipe exactly and baked the brownies for 35 minutes. In my oven, that was perfect. I used a metal nonstick pan and had no trouble with overbaking or sticking. If the edges of your brownies are hard as a rock, the brownies were probably overbaked. Glass pans can do this, so you might try reducing the oven temp to 325 degrees if baking in glass.  To prevent sticking, you can also line the pan with parchment paper so you can lift the brownies out before cutting. Thanks for a great recipe, Brooke! Bombshell brownies indeed! [Edited: I just made a batch in a 15"x10"x1" parchment-lined pan. When cool, I cut the brownies with a 2" heart-shaped cookie cutter and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Beautiful for a tea-time cookie tray!]

This is a fantastic brownie recipe, each time I make it the brownies come out dense and fudgy.  The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great but the chocolate chips all melted and clumped up at the bottom which made them hard to cut, so now I just leave them out.  I also found them a bit sweet so I now leave out about half a cup of the sugar and add an extra half a cup of cocoa powder, but that is just personal preference.  Every time I make these I get compliments.

Very good brownies~ just remember to reduce sugar to 2 cups in total. (1 cup brown sugar, and 1 cup white sugar) I thought the sweetness was perfect then. Also, I replaced the choco chips with walnuts. And I added 1 and 1/2 tsp baking powder so the brownies would rise just a little. Perfect texture for me then!

Easy to make, and you can throw all the ingredients in in any order and it will still turn out.  Pretty much foolproof, and has that great cracked crust that a brownie should have.  Using 100% whole wheat flour doesn't change the taste much.  Folded in the chocolate chips with a spatula after mixing the rest of the ingredients with a stand mixer.  You really need to spread it out with a spatula into a 9x13 pan to help with an even shape, and use parchment paper to make cleanup and removal from the pan easier.  Be careful about overbaking it as it won't seem done; the tester will be a little wet at the bottom--might be the chocolate chips.  If you bake it too long this will turn into a hockey puck consistency and will dry out easily but will still taste good.

This was disappointing given the high ratings.  It tasted more cake like.  I think it had too much sugar though my alteration was to substitute Splenda- still leaves something to be desired.  I look for a chewiness,... can't stop eating rating and this is far from it.  I leaves my mouth dry and retreating.  The best I have found so far is 
Texas Brownies II by Norma.  I will keep testing, but more chocolate is needed here, more moisture and more chew.

I was looking for a recipe with ingredients that I already had laying around. These turned out perfectly! I halved the recipe, as there are only two of us, and made it in an 8x8 pan. They baked in about 30 minutes, and I forgot to mix the chips in, so i sprinkled them on top and it turned out just fine that way. I also read previous reviews and used half white sugar, half brown sugar. I had also never made homemade brownies before, but I will always use this recipe now, they turned out so good! Easy and quick to make, I'd recommend to anyone looking for a brownie recipe.

I made these basically the way the recipe was written (I used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3) and they really turned out great!  One thing I noticed was that they didn't need to be baked anywhere near 35 minutes.  At 20 minutes, they smelled done.  Any more time than that, and they would have been overcooked and dry.  It's important to use butter, not margarine (my friend made these the same day I did, and the margarine really changed the texture) and beat well after adding each egg.  This is an excellent recipe!!

I rarely go by an exact recipe but I'm so happy I did on this one. These brownies are amazing made exactly as instructed, just put some muscle into creaming in the eggs with sugar/butter mixture. The batter is very thick but makes for a perfectly delicious and picturesque surface. You can't not love these.

When I saw the sugar to flour ratio in this recipe, I knew I had to try it!  I am so glad I did because brownies like most of us dream of are produced.  There is a fragile, crackled top crust that reveals ooey, gooey, fudgey brownies underneath!  So much so that cooling them before trying to cut is VERY important. While hot and NOT OVERBAKED, the interior is pudding-like.  It sets up to be firm and dense as it cools.  I wanted to present these on a crystal tray for a party so I wanted cleanly cut squares.  I used a very sharp, large blade knife dipped in hot water and wiped dry before each cut.  Perfect.   If fudgey, gooey brownies with a dense chew is what you are looking for, this is it.  Nothing light or cakey about these.  They are so moist that they were still incredible the next day with just having had a piece of foil tossed over them.  Perfect brownie in my eyes and the 50 people at my party agreed!

I get that this is an indulgence but 3 CUPS OF SUGAR is obscene, period!  May as well eat the sugar out of the carton because that's all you'll taste here.

THE ONLY HINT YOU NEED: Following the recipe exactly = Brooke's Brownie Perfection. Don't over beat or over bake, use good quality chocolate and for the love of all that is holy don't substitute the ingredients or reduce them. If you do, it's *your* recipe (or the reviewer's you chose to trust), not Brooke's, that deserves less than 5 stars. These admonishments aside, this is not a recipe for those that love cake-like brownies. These are gorgeous, rich, chewy and decadent. If that sounds like brownie nirvana to you, then stop here. I don't change a darn thing in this recipe and they turn out perfectly every time. And I make them ALL the time. There is no way this recipe, as written, makes a hard, dry, crumbly brownie. That outcome is on the reviewer or the reviewer's oven temperature.

Here are some other helpful hints: I spoon my flour and cocoa when I measure rather than scoop. This does make a difference and I prefer the texture when I measure this way. I start watching them like a hawk at around 28-30 minutes. I like slightly underdone brownies. So, this way, I can catch them when perfect. The time varies slightly with the weather.

I made these brownies and they aren't good!!  We didn't even eat one each.  I followed others guidance and did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar... and it made no difference.  These were too sickly sweet, and the next day they were hard as a rock.  I will not be making these again.    They also took over 1 hour to cook in my oven.

I brought these to a 4th of July cook-out today and received rave reviews.  I used mini-chocolate morsels which were nicely distributed throughout the end product.  I had been looking for a recipe that would yield a nice thick brownie and I have finally found a keeper!

I didn't realize that  "chewy and fudgy" meant a raw consistency.  Mine were definitely cooked.  The toothpick came out clean and the top was nice and firm.  But when I served these the next day, not only were they hard, dry and crumbly, they tasted raw and grainy throughout.  A terrible texture.  I will continue my hunt for the perfect brownie.

The brownies had good flavor, but that was only because I followed the advice of the other reviewers and used 1 cup each of brown and white sugar, instead of 3 cups.  Otherwise, this would have been way too sweet.  I haven't had much success with homemade brownies, and this was no exception.  It came out too cake like and dry at 33 min baking time.  The second time I made this, I reduced the flour to 1 cup + 2 tbsp, reduced the baking time to 25 min, and replaced a 1/4 cup of the oil with applesauce.  The result still wasn't quite as fudgy as I would like, but it was an improvement from the first batch. Took a picture of the second batch.

I must have did something wrong because this was the worst brownie recipe ever! They were thick, and the taste was not that of a brownie more like a chocolate mess.

I have finally found the perfect fudgy brownie recipe! I cut down the sugar amount by 1 cup and used half brown sugar, so I used 1 cup each of white and brown sugar. I added a teaspoon of espresso powder to the batter. Instead of adding chocolate chips to the batter I made a glaze by melting together 1 cup of chocolate chips and a 1/4 cup of cream together in the microwave and I just spread that on top of the hot brownies. Since I used a glass baking pan I turned down the oven tempature to 325 degrees. I do find them better when they are cooled than when they are hot out of the oven. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

If you like your brownies fidgy, rich, melt-in-your-mouth delicious, these are the ones to make! I had about 13 people ask me for the recipe when i took them to work. I also used half and half brown and white sugar and I used over 1/2a cup of milk chocolate chips. DECADENT!

These came out excellent!  Wonderfully fudgy and just sweet enough.  I added an extra 1/4 cup flour as a precaution for high altitude, and they rose wonderfully, not too thin, and didn't turn them into cake like brownies.

Love this brownie!! I made HALF of the original recipe and I used 1/2 C + 2 Tbsp each of brown and white sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, because cinnamon adds warmth and makes the chocolate flavor more intense. Remember, use good quality chocolate, it really makes a difference. I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips so the brownie is not intensely sweet. I melted half of the chocolate chips with the butter, whip the eggs and sugar until slightly thickened, add the dry ingredients, mix, and fold in the rest of the chocolate chips. It turns out fudgy and chewy, I can't stop eating it!

I cooked these with the 1/2 brown sugar suggestion, plus I included a cream cheese/kahlua mixture on top, and they were so good! For the cream cheese mixture I used 8 oz cream cheese and 5tbsp butter at room temperature, beaten together with one egg, 1/4 cup sugar, 1tbsp kahlua, and 1/2 tbsp of vanilla. Then just poor on top of brownie batter in pan and swirl in with a knife. They are fabulous!!!

Good brownies out of the oven.  Very dense and chewy and intensely chocolately, but these brownies harden up overnight.  The middle is still very tasty, but the crusts become a sugary, gritty armour.  Reheating will soften the exoskeleton a bit.

This has become our family's favorite brownies. For the sugar I use half white and half brown sugar (I think it makes for a chewier brownie). I think that these are rich enough so I don't add the chocolate chips. I also have made these brownies gluten-free by substituting Bob's Red Mill's all-purpose gluten free flour mix and they have come out just as good. Thanks for a great recipe!

Probably won't make these again. The texture was not that chewy, except for around the edges. The inside of the brownie was very raw tasting, and altogether, not that great. Very sugary.

I had made these before and thought they were pretty good, but not great - just made them again and I'm wondering if I messed something up the first time because they are really, really good!  They're very thick, they look a little cake-like, but are very fudgy.  Very decadent, chocolaty brownie.

Not quite as  easy as  the  box but pretty close and ten times better. Halved it and made in  a 9x9  glass   pan so baked  at 325 for  about  40 minutes.  I don't think using a  toothpick to test for doneness is the best way with  brownies -  looking for them  to crack a bit  on top and to not jiggle in the  middle has always worked for me. Great!

This was my first time making brownies from scratch, and they came out perfectly! Chewy and "fudgy", just how I like my brownies.  :)  They satisfied both my chocolate craving and my sweet tooth.    I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  The brownies were still great the next day (and did not harden).    One thing to keep in mind while you're baking them is that the toothpick may not come out clean because of the chocolate chips.

To put it simply these brownies were:
dry,
too sweet,
burnt on the edges,
way to dense to enjoy.
I have honestly had better from the box.

Amazing! I made these 2 nights in a row. First night, just like the recipe , and the 2nd night I took advice from other reviews. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also mixed half the chips in, sprinkled half on top before baking, and sprinkled a bunch more chocolate chips and chunks on the top as soon as I took them out of the oven (cooked for exactly 35 minutes).

We liked the flavor much better with the addition of brown sugar, but the texture was absolutely perfect both times.

I just tried making these for my husband's birthday because he loves brownies.  I followed the recipe as is was written and I don't know what happened, but they were BAD!  The batter was very thick and they came out of the oven dry and crumbly.  I took them out after 30min-if I had gone 35-40 they would have been toast.  They cracked and did not look at all appetizing-nothing "fudgy" or "gooey" about them.  They did not taste good at all.  I have gone over and over this recipe...checked and double checked to see that I didn't miss anything...checked my oven temp.  These cannot be the brownies that everyone is raving over.  Thank goodness I happened to have a box mix laying around the pantry or hubby would really have been disappointed.  Sorry...

okay, I baked the brownies for 40 minutes and the outside was over crunchy and the middle was still uncooked.  Impossible trying to cut them into pieces.  This was a total disaster, was making them for a snack for my son's soccer game. What a waste of time.

These are in fact very sweet and very chewy, but they OOZE butter and sugar...I followed the recipe to a tee and pulled them out of the oven at 40 minutes to still find raw batter in the middle....after an addtional TWENTY MINUTES they were done!  Not to mention very $$$$ will all the butter, but I thought I would give them a try with all the good reviews!

I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E! I brought these into work today cut into 24 pieces. When I left work, they were ALL gone! I had people complimenting me on the brownies for the rest of the day. A couple of people told me that I should be selling them, and several people came back for seconds refusing to leave without another piece. Everyone who had a piece told me that it was "the best brownie they have ever tasted". This recipe has now been adopted as my all time favorite brownie recipe, and I will continue using it until the day I die. Thanks for the AWESOME recipe Brooke!!!

I agree with some of the other reviewers that these brownies are too sweet. 3 cups of sugar is way too much. The sweetness takes away from the rich chocolate taste you expect in a brownie. These tasted more sugary than chocolatey. We ate them with vanilla ice cream which helped but next time I will cut the sugar to 2 cups or try another recipe.

Holy Wow! The only things I changed was to reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup and I added the flour, cocoa powder and salt, one at a time, directly to the wet mixture.  (Less mess to clean up.) I don't want to ever make boxed brownies again. So quick and easy, and I had everything already in the kitchen. Fantastic!

Way too sweet for us - they're more like eating fudge bars than brownies.  Don't get me wrong - they're good .... but a tad overboard with the sugar.  You really have to have a seriously bad thing for sweets to have more than one.

Excellent!!! I made these according to the directions. I only omitted the chocolate chips because I'm allergic to chocolate and I added walnuts and swirled in some caramel on top. I used a 9 x 13 pan as instructed and they turned out great. They were not bricks as another reviewer said. They were the perfect thickness. Yummy!

Made these today. 97* outside, but I just had the urge to bake something.  They are wonderful!! The only thing I did diff is used milk choc chips because that is all I had (and I surely did not want to go to the store!!).  I normally don't like the harder pieces on the "ends", but for these, they are amazing. Not sure why that is, but these really ARE the bomb!!

WAY too much sugar. I had to brush my teeth after eating it to get rid of the film it left.  I will stick to the recipe that I found on epicurious.

Just the brownie I was looking for!  I wouldn't have believed a brownie this dense and fudgy would have a no-oil recipe, but the butter certainly does the job all by itself.  These are very chocolaty and rich without being too sweet.

Well, I guess I should have known better than to make brownies with one cup of butter and THREE cups of sugar. They made me slightly sick to my stomach. 

They are fudgy in the middle and slightly crunchy on the outside. The flavor was a bit lackluster, probably because there is so much ... butter.

Eeeh, based on the reviews & recommendations, I really wanted to like this recipe but my brownies turned out dry, cake-like & rather disappointing.  The only changes that I made, per other reviewers' suggestions, were 1 c each of brown & white sugars since 3 c sounded like a lot.  Maybe that's where I went wrong.  I've been trying out different brownie recipes for years & sadly, I prefer the boxed brownies over these any day.

I did put dark Choc mint chips instead of semi sweet.  Awesome and easy. I also reduced the sugar by a half cup still sweet enough. Probably great with most anything added

This recipe gets 5 stars from me!  I've never been able to make a wonderful brownie. Now I know why - I just didn't have the right recipe!  These brownies are really, really good.  Very rich and very chocolatey! The chips in them just helps to give them even more chocolatey rich goodness.  I did what another reviewer suggested and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  A perfect fix for a chocolate craving of a chocoholic!  Thank you!

Perfect.  I notice though that if I bake until toothpick comes clean it's too crusty around edges (we like soft brownies).  It's possible that's due to the fact that I always sub raw sugar for white sugar, but just wanted to mention it in case it's relevant to anyone.  Wonderful recipe.

Average recipe because it's not as fudge-y as I would have liked it to be. Flour the chocolate chips before your stir them in the batter so that the chocolate chips won't sink to the bottom.

Oh, these were amazing.  I even used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce just to take out some of the saturated fat...and we didn't miss a thing!!  Other than that - I made these exactly as written.  Will be my new brownie recipe!!

I cut the sugar to 2 1/4 cups and increased the cocoa to 1 1/4 cups.  I added 1 tsp of baking powder and 2 tsps of instant coffee powder to the dry ingredients.  I also doubled the chips, using a full 12-oz bag.  Fantastic!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I doubled it to make for a treat for class of mine. They took forever to make, and I never felt like they were done. The second batch I made I left in the pan overnight. I went to cut them up in the morning and they were rock hard. I had a little bit of issues cutting them with a Wusthof knife! The ones in the middle were fudgy, but the ones from the night before were not presentable. About a 1/4 of the brownies turned out. Looked over the recipe and I followed it to the "t", won't be using again!

Not crazy about this recipe.  The brownies have a great consistency but are extremely sweet and on the sugary side.  The 3 cups of sugar definetley over power the cocoa.

These were not good. My were super runny in the middle, even after extra cooking time. I am a big fan of fudgy brownies, but this was just batter. Maybe my oven needs to be recalibrated.

I thought these were going to be EXCELLENT because of all the 5 stars recived.  I was so disappointed!  I am a prego woman and my fave is brownies.  I did use all 3c. of sugar, and the brownies turned out too sweet and gritty I threw out 95% of them!  I even tried giving them to my mom and sister and they said the same thing, they could feel the gritty sugar in their teeth!  I followed this recipe exactly, but will not be making it again :(

The best brownie I've ever made (and I've made a lot of them). I must confess that I did go 1/2 & 1/2 brown sugar and white sugar, and I should have compensated for the extra moisture the brown sugar brought to the recipe. I've never used brown sugar in a brownie recipe before, and I'll never NOT use it from now on. I baked them for the full amount of time, and they were still a little too gooey. Everyone loved them though. Next time I'll try 2 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown to see how that goes. These come out very fudgy and moist, with that crinkly, crispy brownie top. Plus, a 13x9x2 pan's worth vs. an 8" or 9" pan? More for everyone to enjoy. Great recipe, thanks.

WOW!!! I love these brownies! They are really sweet and chocolatey and they are great if I'm having a particularly bad day. They're like a natural anti-depressant! I did as some other reviewers suggested and used 1/2 and 1/2 brown and white sugar. But note, if you prefer cake-like brownies, these aren't them! They are chewy and perfect, just the way I love them. I was nervous when I first made them because the batter was INCREDIBLY thick, but they baked up perfectly at exactly 35 minutes.

This recipe was definitely the bombshell. Amazing. I made some for my Papa's birthday party/family night tonight. He isn't really big on sweets so when he specially requested brownies, I automatically volunteered to make them (being the baker in my family).  He told me to buy a box of Duncan Heinz brownies just in case mine.didn't turn out. I felt kind of insulted and said we wouldn't need the boxed kind. Well, turned out I was right. Papa told me these are even better than the Duncan Heinz kind and my grandpa told me they were exceptional. And they are! Thank you for their great recipe that I will surely be using from now on.

I was looking for a good base recipe for fudge brownies (because I do lots of variations when I make brownies), but I have to say that these are, by far, the most fabulous brownie recipe EVER! I am an experienced baker and have tried many brownie recipes-much to my disappointment-but I can't say enough about these wonderfully fudgy and decadent sweets! I used 1 1/2 c. of dark brown sugar and 1 1/4 c. of white sugar, subbed 3 T. mayo for one egg and added about 1 1/2 t. coffee instant coffee granules with my dry ingredients and sprinkled the chocolate chips on top, along with some coarsely chopped pecans.  Thanks so much Brooke for sharing this amazing recipe, for it is my go-to base recipe for brownies from now on!!!

Best brownies I've ever made. Followed the directions  with slight two changes. First I omitted the chocolate chips since I didn't have any. Second, I used an 8x11 pan since I don't have a 9x13. The brownies were thick and chewy and crisp on the edges and top. Absolutely awesome! Thank you, thank you, thank you Brooke for sharing this recipe.

Cake.  They are cake, not brownies.  If something is described as "fudgy", then I expect fudgy, not chocolately.  I'm throwing this pan away.  It at least tastes decent but if I wanted cake, I would have looked for a cake recipe, not brownies.  Very disappointed.

This is a great recipe and the taste is wonderful!  I followed directions exactly even leaving them in the oven for 10 more minutes than recommended however, the middle was still raw.  I preheated correctly so maybe instead of 9 x 13 pan, I should have used a bigger one, but otherwise it was great!

Excellent recipe - I wouldn't change a thing. I served these brownies at a New Year's Eve diiner, along with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. All agreed that the brownies were way better without the ice cream!

I thought this was a fantastic easy recipe.  I didn't have the issue others had with the brownies being too thin.  The only thing I did differently was to also add 1/4 c. Vegetable oil.  Turned out very moist.  Thank you Brooke!

They turned out just as the original poster said they would. FUDGEY!!  If you want them a little less fudgey and less sweet, leave out the chips.

OMG. These brownies were SOO good.  It was completely quiet in the house.  Nobody was talking.  Just eating.  I left off one cup of sugar and the chocolate chips.  Mmm. Perfection with some Breyers vanilla ice cream.  I also tried with Hagen Dazs vanilla--equally as wonderful.

Yummo!! The only thing I changed was to use only 2 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 3. They were perfect. I think 3 cups would have been too sweet. They had a perfect texture and I will save this recipe for sure!

These are simply the BEST.  Perfect balance between cakelike and fudgy texture! However I HALVED the sugar and used ONLY 1.5 cups and it was just perfect.  Have had rave reviews from hubby, friends, office....thank you Brooke!!!

This recipe makes the almost-perfect brownie. I make these often and caused brownie hysteria in my town (I live abroad). I reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup because I find them a bit too sweet for me. These are the best brownies I've made.

THE BOMB!  I didn't even have all ingredients on hand (short on butter; used Crisco for 1/2 cup) and no chocolate chips.  My hubby and I were in LOVE with these brownies and our church class LOVED them too!  They said chocolate gooey deliciousness!  Thanks, Brooke!

Everybody whom I shared it with found it too very sweet (more emphasis on the sweet) despite the fact that I followed another user's suggestion to use 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I'll try making this one again but with just 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar next time..I also followed another user's suggestion to remove the brownie from the oven before the toothpick comes out clean and leave it to cool. It came out fabulous! The corners were not burned and the texture of the brownie was chewy and fudgey like how a brownie should be. Overall, this brownie recipe is great, just needs a little adjusting with the sugar. Cheers!

Wowwwwww! That is all I have to say. Nothing needs to be changed except for a disclaimer about how much milk you need to drink with these...delicious and rich!

I made a batch for a party on Saturday night and everyone loved them so much I made a second batch for another activity on Sunday.  The only change is I replaced a cup of the white sugar with brown.   But other than that, I remained true to this recipe.  No more box for this girl!

Awesome recipe!  These brownies are rich and fudgy and have tons of chocolate, which is perfect for a chocoholic.  I've made these a couple of times now.  The second time (in my photo) I did a mint variation.  I added 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract, then sprinkled York pieces on top.  Delish!

Oh my god, Brooke, these are the best brownies I've ever had!! I often make brownies with a little something else, like caramel brownies, or cheesecake brownies, but tonight I wanted a nice fudgy brownie, just pure chocolate, and that's what I got with this recipe! I didn't intend to make any changes, but found that I had to, simply because of what I had on hand (and what I didn't). I used about 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup buttery flavour margarine; 2 cups white sugar, 1 cup brown; 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 hot chocolate mix (if I'd known ahead of time I didn't have enough cocoa, I would have cut back on the sugar but it was too late - still turned out great!; had no chocolate chips so just left them out. Next time I make these, I'll do it exactly as written (except maybe the chocolate chips - I don't think these amazing brownies need them!) I baked 35 minutes, and I think they could have done with 5 minutes more. The edges were perfect and chewy, the middle was good too but more underbaked, I think I'd like to aim for getting the middle closer to what the edges were like.

I usually use applesauce to replace fat in my brownie recipes, and I never feel like I am missing anything or eating a low-fat dessert.  Tonight I did not make this change to this recipe - LOL only 'cause I've been doing so well this year as far as indulging myself (my first indulgence!).  I did, however, use half brown sugar and organic eggs & butter.  I broke down and paid $5 for a lb. of organic butter.  Let me say, if I could afford $5 for organic butter, I would never, ever, in a million years go back to even Land O' Lakes butter.  So rich and creamy (no, really creamy...not the fake you think you're eating good cream).  Ah, but this is a brownie review, right?  These were/are the best brownies that have ever passed my lips, and, I, too, am a brownie connoisseur.  Could be the butter, could be the recipe...it's probably both.  Treat yourself to this recipe and, if you can, go ahead and splurge at least once on some organic butter.  (Don't forget to savor some of that butter on a nice piece of hot French bread.)  You will not regret either!!  Absolute heaven on Earth.

Okay, all I can say is these were so good, perfect and absolutely chocolaty  sinful I needed a smoke after!!!! For those that say they were not thick enough, I used a glass pan that was slightly smaller that a 9 x 13. They were about an inch thick. Any thicker...it's cake! The amazing thing about them is 3 days later they were still moist. The other true plus, they are moist and chewey right up to the edges. I have only made boxed brownies once (about 20 years ago) and had to cut off about 1/2" on the edges, not these! I have made them 3 times and needed about 45 minutes but that is the only variation and that could be due to individual oven temps. Testing for doneness by using a glass dish, toward the end, I lift it and look at the bottom, when the color of the middle looks like the edges...your done! Also, you have to use the 1/2 sugar/brown sugar combo. I have tried probably 50 borwnie recipes over the years...no more, this is it! :)`

I have made these 3 times in the last 2 weeks. They are amazing! I made them even more fudgy by melting the chocolate chips with the butter, fantastic! I also halved them and made them in a 9x9 pan, baked for 30 minutes. They are so easy and delicious. The 2nd and 3rd times, I made frosting. One time a chocolate glaze, the other a chocolate buttercream. Both were great. Today when I brought them I was told by several people that they were the best brownies they had ever eaten. Great compliment for great brownies!    Update: So I have now made these brownies more times than I can count (in 3 months) and every time they have been fantastic. I was inspired by the zucchini brownie recipe on this sight (and the 2 dozen zucchini sitting in my kitchen) so substitute zucchini for the butter. They were fantastic! No one knew they had zucchini in them and they were super fudgey and rich. You just need to add about 5 minutes to the baking time and you will have fabulous, decadent, chocolatey zucchini brownies (and no one will know it's in there!)

Yum!  As in other reviews, did 1/2 brown sugar, then baked these in silicone muffin cups, leaving the insides a bit gooey.  Didn't get too cakey despite the number of eggs, and didn't end up as "all edges" in the muffin tins (I don't like edges!) Definitely a keeper!

I've been using this recipe for years... about time I rate it, as I'm polishing off my second to last bombshell brownie of the batch. These brownies develop a lovely crust on the outside and are wonderfully fudgy and chewy on the inside. I half the recipe and bake in an 8x8 pan.

Somebody hurry please and call intervention now!!!  I can't stop eating these.  These are the bomb alright!  So rich, heavy and decadent.  I followed the recipe exactly and it's to die for.  Just a tad too sweet but I have a sweet tooth.  Works for me!  Thank you Brooke!

These brownies were so incredibly good! I made them for the guys at work, and there wasn't even crumbs left. Only change I made was I threw a few extra chocolate chips in. They were very rich and very fudgy, if cake like brownies are your thing, keep looking for another recipe. But if you love the fudgy ones, you will NEVER need another recipe. I baked in a glass pan for about 35 minutes, perfect!

Absolutely the most wonderful brownies ever!!!!
For those who are addicted to Dark Chocolate, I have a suggestion....
Use 3/4C Unsweetened Cocoa
1/4C Hershey's Special Dark Unsweetened Cocoa instead of the full Cup of Unsweetened Cocoa. Also substitute the Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips with Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate Chips.  If you like the darker, more decadent side of chocolate, you will not regret tampering with this incredible recipe! Cheers!

I used half white sugar and brown sugar as others suggested. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The brownies are a good thickness (about 1.25 inches). They are fudgy and not cakey at all, just the way I like them. I wish that I had added some espresso to deepen the chocolate flavor, but because I used a high quality and dark cocoa, these tasted great anyway. I would recommend not serving any edge pieces though because those sides do get hard. One last thing, the texture is perfect when left overnight.  Coming out of the oven, these were good, but the next day really made these extra special.

Excellent brownies, very much like the ones my mother-in-law used to make.  She always added icing, though, and it was a nice touch.  It's just ludicrous that some people at this site decide to change recipes and then write and say they didn't it, particularly a baked good.  This is an excellent recipe.

This is a great recipe...although I did tinker with it.
3 cups of sugar seemed like a lot to me so I only put in 2.5 cups - 1 cup white sugar and 1.5 cups lightly packed brown sugar.  They were still plenty sweet.
I find that orange and chocolate go great together, so I added the zest of one orange.  This worked out really well and the brownies really stood out at my daughter’s school picnic.

These brownies are the best ever!  I made them to send to my husband who is away in the Army and he and all the soldiers he shared them with just love them.  They want more!  I can't believe how good they are.  The only change I made was to use half white and half brown sugar, per other reviewers' suggestions.  Thank you--these are so yummy!!

I took the suggestions of others and added 1 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 cup brown sugar. They were absolutely delicious. My boyfriend took them to work and the whole batch was gone in less than 15 min. They were wonderful in every way. I may have to make them again this week (and I just made them last week!).

These really are the bomb!  Lol.  They really are good.  Moist, dense, chewy and fudgy.  Love that great brownie texture.  One cup of cocoa powder makes these really intense.  Love the chocolate chips too.  Oh, I cut the sugar down to 2 1/4 cups and added one cup of chopped walnuts.  Watch the baking time- I think if I had baked one minute longer (than the 35 listed) they would not have been as good.  We had these as brownie sundaes with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, caramel sauce and peanut butter M&M's.  :)

I'm not sure if the negative reviews on this recipe are due to lack of knowledge in the kitchen or what....but I didn't change one single line of this. Made it verbatim, cooked for 38 mins, cooled and enjoyed. They were excellent! Even better the next day and you have the satisfaction of telling people that they are from scratch...no boxes here. Good stuff!

I have tried a lot of brownie recipes and this is one of my favorites! Everyone at the Christmas party loved them. I did make one change, since some said they were too sweet, I used bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semisweet, and they were perfect!

These are amazing in every way but the one problem is that they weren't done after 40 minutes and I ended up cooking them for an hour so if anyone else experienced that, you ain't alone

Everyone thought I was the best chef EVER!:) Only change I made was I did 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white instead of 3 cups of white and OMG They turned out to be the most chewiest and yummiest brownies ever! Even better then store bought and special made ones!:)

Great recipe! I substituted coconut ghee for the butter since I was short, used whole wheat pastry flour, and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup reg sugar per other reviews recommendations. I used a mixer to beat the melted oil with the sugar and beat in 1 egg at a time until well blended. I gently hand mixed in the flour, cocoa, salt mix before stirring in some dark chocolate chunks. They were gooey fudgy deliciousness! I used a glass 11"x7" pan and baked for 30 min at 350. Perfection! 4 stars as written, 5 stars with my changes:) Thanks for a great recipe!

This is it, this is it, this is it!!! The homemade brownie I've been looking for, to rival that preservative-laden boxed mix that's been my guilty secret.  For those who don't really want a sugary brownie, here's my experience: the first time I made these exactly as written. They were thick, fudgy, and had that satiny brownie shell on top - definitely 4.5 stars in my opinion, just a tad sweeter than I would have liked. Then I made a second batch using Hershey's special dark cocoa instead of their regular cocoa, and this did the trick - they baked up the same as before but were intensely dark, almost black, in color and had the richer, darker, slightly less sweet taste I'd been craving.  An absolutely perfect brownie in my opinion! Like others, I use a stand mixer to beat everything together really well, then add the chocolate chips by hand with a silicone spatula before spreading it in the dish. I use a glass dish lined with greased foil, bake it at 350 for 37-38 minutes, and I've had none of the problems with dryness/texture that others mentioned, even living in fairly dry California. I just make sure to cover the brownies tightly with foil once they're sliced and on the plate. Thanks, Brooke, for a great recipe!

This recipe is amazing. Make sure you do use the right size of pan, because I used on a bit too small and my batter almost went over the edge of the pan in the oven. However, the brownies were absolutely AMAZING. This is a must-try recipe!!! I adored these, they were rich, gooey, and lovely.

I added craisins to this and substituted applesauce for 1/2 the butter. These were amazingly good! My hubby loved them and he isn't a huge chocolate person.

WAY too sweet. This is nothing like any brownie I've ever had or would like to have. Any hint of chocolate was overpowered by the sugar.

We're a household of chocoholics. We LOVE nice fudgy brownies, but these are way over-the-top chocolate, something I didn't think was possible. Way too sweet, too... brownies ARE sweet by definition, but these are just too much. My son loved them, but even he could eat just one tiny square and asked me to save the rest for later.  Hubby said 'meh'. I've got a giant pan of brownies left over. This has NEVER happened before. Nice try, but far, far overboard. Won't make again, sorry.

EDIT: Downgrading from 3 to 2 stars. The next day, the rest of the pan had hardened and got crunchy. Threw it all out.

I like to compare recipes to see what's different and what the comments are. For this one, it's helpful to compare with the similar Quick and Easy Brownies (also has almost a thousand ratings, and is between 4-5 stars). Many reviewers have suggested reducing the sugar for this recipe to 2 cups; that's what QandEB has; I followed that. But then some reviewers here complain that the brownies are dry, and at QandEB many reviewers suggest reducing the flour to 1 cup, so I followed that. Leave the rest as is (QandEB has less cocoa, but you really don't want to cut down on that!), but add 1/4 teaspoon baking powder (QandEB suggests 1/2, another highly rated brownie recipe on this site has 1/4). The result is really fabulous! The "quick and easy" part of QandEB is that you can just add everything one at a time into a single bowl if you follow this order: sugar, butter, cocoa, vanilla, eggs, flour, baking powder, salt, walnuts/chocolate chips. I did that too.  The hard part is not eating too many brownies in one sitting!

Excellent! We made these just like the recipe for a church dinner and ended up making a second batch when we got home. I didn't change a thing and they came out perfect!! So "fudge-y" and chewy!! This is our new favorite brownie! Thank you so much for sharing!

I wanted to love these.  The batter tasted and smelled delicious and promising.  But the finished product was way over the top - too sweet, too chocolatey, just TOO rich...so rich your teeth hurt.  I may try this recipe again without the chips but with the addition of walnuts or pecans to temper the flavor and add texture.

If you like fudge-like brownies, these are the ones for you! They are intensely chocolatey, fudgy and a little gooey from the chocolate chips...a chocoholic's dream for sure! I followed the recommendation of using half white and half brown sugar, this may have given these brownies that extra depth of flavor to send them over the top! Yummy!

Darn it!  :)  These didn't do it for me either!  :(  These taste like restaurant brownies that aren't very good until they're heated, topped with ice cream & chocolate sauce.  I wanted a brownie good "as is."  I'll keep looking ... Although, K liked these better than "quick & easy" on this site.  These didn't scream "fudgy" to me.  No, I don't want fudge.  I want FUDGY!  :D  :)

I've made these brownies a few times, but had not made them in awhile. I just baked a batch and yummo!! I forgot how delicious these are! I always cut the recipe in half, bake them in an 8X8 dish, use margarine instead of butter, egg substitute and white chocolate chips. They always turn out amazing and I don't feel as guilty eating more than 1 because I cut out some of the fat! ;) I also suggest just hand mixing, so the batter doesn't get over mixed. Best brownies ever! Everyone must try these!

These should be called the "make you nauseous and rot your teeth sweet bombshell brownies"! WOW! I don't see why anyone needs 3 cups of sugar in brownies! But like others said, if you want a sugar filled brownie, this is for you. 3 stars because my husband and kids enjoyed them, but i will not be making them again.

Followed the recipe, except instead of 1 cup chips, I used 1 cup chopped candy bars & topped with another cup of chopped candy bars.  Also baked for an 50 minutes which was probably 5 minutes too long, but with all the chocolate candy, my toothpick was very chocolatey every time I checked it.  They were wondful & disappeared fast at the potluck.

Wow! Crispy outside crust & nice fudge deep chocolate flavor on the inside. Everyone loved it. The only difference with mine is that I didnt have chocolate chips so I cut up some min kitkats (from halloween) and did 2 cups sugar.

Great brownies! Me and my boyfriend loved them. 
I halved the recipe and they turned out perfect.
I did use salted butter so I didn't add so much salt as required.
The brownies were very fudgy, chocolately, moist, and had melted gooey chocolate bits from the chocolate chips. I would definitely make this again.

Great flavor!  Spot on texture!  What a splurge of indulgence these brownies are.  Quite rich but just what we all needed at the time!

This was my first time making brownies from scratch. And let me tell you, I will never use the box kind ever again. These have to be the BEST brownies I've ever had!!!! Next time I'm going to use mint chocolate chips, just because I like mint. I think I'll even add some walnuts next time too.

Made this today. EXTREMELY AWESOME!. I have made brownies 3 times already, all from the box differently but this one I am going to keep doing it. its the best ever. I read all the reviews and took suggestions and changed the recipe a little. 

3/4 butter melted
2 cups of sugar and 1/4 brown.
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and a little less than 1/4 milk at the end I added the milk. 
It came out flaky on the top like i always wanted, not too sweet. Thanks Brooke.

I tried this after trying a recipe from another site that we hated and this was exactly what we were looking for!  The brownies were "crusty" (for lack of a better word) on top and chewy & fudgy in the center, just how we like them.  I followed the recipe exactly except that 3 cups of sugar seemed a bit much to me so I cut it back to 2 and the brownies were perfect for my taste.  I didn't have any chocolate chips but I did have Heath bar toffee bits which I mixed in.  This will be my brownie recipe from now on - no more box mixes for us - I will try it with the chocolate chips or a different type of mix-in next time.

To be honest, I was torn between these and MMMM Brownies but decided to make these since the recipe was for a 9x13 pan and that's the pan size I wanted to use.  I made these this morning for a co-worker's b-day and was a little concerned with the length of cook time, but they turned out AWESOME!  I will be making these often.  Thank you Brooke ~ these are the BOMB!

My new favorite brownie recipe!  Perfect edges and corners for those people who like the chewy sides and nice moist fudgy middles for the non edge people!  Made exactly as stated except I used white chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand.  DELICOUS!

These are a nice soft, dense brownie (not cake-like) and they are rich and delicious. I made mini-brownie bites by using a mini-muffin pan and sprinkled mini-m&m's on them. My husband and kids loved them! If you are looking for a classic brownie recipe, this would be it. :-)

These were great. I took the recommendation from another review and split the sugar between white and brown. I also added a tsp of baking powder. They came out just perfect in terms of thickness!

Perfect & easy with one change.  I cut down the sugar to 2 cups. It was still plenty sweet with 2 cups and the chocolate chips. I can't imagine how it would have tasted with 3 cups!

Great recipe! Texture is amazing, chocolate flavor is great, and I didn't think it was too sweet.

Even better the next day when they get a little more solid, pop it in the microwave, and it melts in your mouth. Yum.

I usually make half the recipe and use a 8x8 pan. Usually takes less than 30 min to cook through. I check mine with a toothpick. Half is plenty enough for 3 people.

These brownies really are THE BOMB!  They are so yummy and fudgy...Brownies used to be the only thing I would dare to make from a box because from scratch recipes never quite hit the mark for me.  This recipe is FANTASTIC.  I will NEVER have to buy a box for brownies again :-).  It even comes out with that must have smooth and shiny top.  Thank you SO much for sharing!

Chewy and thick and not at all cake-like...just like I wanted. I also have to say, these are the first brownies I've ever made that were thick, didn't have overly crispy edges, AND cut beautifully? I threw them in the freezer for about 5 minutes to cool properly so I could cut immediately, and they cut perfectly! I'm in heaven and will never make another recipe. I did add about 2/3 cup of chopped pecans as well.

FINALLY! The chewy, chocolaty brownie that I have been searching for! This brownie was delicious followed exactly from the recipe. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. So chewy and moist. I've tried about 5 different brownie recipes on here and I am finally satisfied! Thank you Brooke!

This receipe is AWESOME!!!! Easy to make and eat. We added a bit of cream cheese frosting...but they didn't need it but it tasted great both plain and frosted. My sister swore this is the same receipe Corner Bakery uses for their brownies. This is a keeper.

The taste of these were very good and very chocolately, but they weren't fudgey (gooey) like I like brownies to be.  I think next time I will use one less egg and see if that makes them less cake-like.  Thanks for the great recipe!

they are VERY fudgy. almost stick to roof of your mouth fudgy! as brownies go they are pertty good, but i like my brownies a bit lighter. i used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce, which worked perfectly. (u  shuld always sub applesauce for butter). i suggest lughtening up a little on the sugar: 1 1/2 cup white sugar,and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar worked jsut fine. used 1/2 tsp of salt

I've made these both with and without the semi-sweet chocolate chips and I prefer them without. I also used 1.5 cups of brown sugar and 1.5 cups of white sugar to give it a richer/fuller flavor. This recipe is excellent! I will never go back to box brownies again.

I was hoping to love these brownies because of all of the great reviews - made them as written.  I have to agree with the reviews that say there is way way way too much sugar in these.  I ate one with some icecream. :(  Will look for a recipe with much less sugar next time.

Made a recipe and a 1/2 in a 9 x 13 glass pan for one hour. Added  2 chopped milk chocolate candy bars. Triple chocolate heaven.

Hard to review since I did 1 cup white sugar & 1 cup brown sugar instead of the 3 cups white sugar called for.  Flavor was nice but after 35 mins in the oven they seemed cakey and overdone.

I didn't give this five stars because,  I felt like the brownies we're too sweet, maybe I'll use less sugar next time.  I also had a problem getting them out of the pan, I did light grease as instructed.  So I recommend generously greasing your pan. ;)

Stop looking!  You are now one of the blessed who have found heaven on earth!  I've been looking for a brownie recipe forever.  Some are too dry or not chocolatey enough.  This recipe had me with the cup of cocoa and the four eggs.  I did what others suggested halfing white and brown sugar.  I also ran out of vanilla extract (and I call myself a baker) but had dark rum instead so in it went.  Talk about decadent!  My son topped it with a scoop of Mackinac Island fudge ice cream, but all I needed was a glass of milk.  This is a girl's dream come true.  These brownies reminded of the brownies at Coldstone Creamery.  Yeah, they are THAT good if not better.  Well, way better since you make them yourself.

This is it!!!  This is the perfect brownie.  I have tried so many scratch brownie recipes, but have always gone back to the box, until now.  This is rich, chewy and chocolatey.  I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, and they are plenty sweet.  I also baked 24 mini cupcakes and 1 smaller pan of brownies.  I frosted the pan with buttercream and holiday M&M's.  Then I frosted the cupcakes with mint buttercream and crushed candy canes.  They are so good.  Will be my go-to brownie recipe!!!  Thanks!

I thought these brownies were excellent.  They are chewy and just plain delicious.  If you like cake like brownies, these are not for you.  I cut back the sugar to 2.5 cups--my friend who is a brownie expert said these are the best she has ever had!  Hubby loved them too, with ice cream of course!!!

After trying all of the top rated brownie recipes on the site out on my family, my husband (the true brownie lover in the family) believes these are the best brownies he has ever eaten. Remember the trick to chewy outsides and soft middles is to pull the pan out of the over before your fork comes out clean. If you wait for the fork/toothpick to be clean, your edges will be too hard. Let them rest in the pan to finish baking before dishing up. A little powdered sugar sprinkled over the top finishes these off nicely!

I can't say enough about how easy & awesome these brownies are. Before I make something, I read the other reviews. The batter was gritty, but I called my mom & she said it goes away when they bake. And it did. I went with the advice of another reviewer & added a handful of chocolate chips.....WOW! Can you imagine adding butterscotch chips or Heath chips or Andies chip? And a plus, the boyfriend loved them enough, he decided he wasn't sharing with the co-workers! Thanks!  :)

I'm sorry, but these were just TERRIBLE..  I mean really, who wants a perfectly decadent, irresistible, wonderfully chewy and rich brownie anyway???  Seriously, the cooks who rated this 1 star are either not "brownie people", or you must have done something wrong because these were hands-down the most delicious thing that has ever exited my oven.  I didn't change a thing except to decrease the sugar by about 2 tbsp, and I knew I had a winner the second I tasted the batter- was tempted to eat the entire bowl as it was!  One important tip that the recipe does not specify is the method of mixing these.  Anytime you make baked goods, you should hand-mix if possible to get the best texture; electric mixers just have no place in brownie making, this recipe included.  I whisked the dry ingredients thoroughly then gently hand-mixed them into the wet ingredients, then baked it in a slightly larger pan (metal) than recommended, and everyone who tasted these loved them.  I'm eating one now 5 days later and the texture and taste is still to-die-for.  If you or someone you know is a "brownie person", make these right now!

Holy YUM! Took another reviewer's advice and used 2.5 cups white sugar and .5 cup brown sugar. Also, my family loves the peanut butter/chocolate combo, so I used Reese's peanut butter chips instead of chocolate ones. I'm sure glad I did as the brownies are very rich and chocolatey.  Will definitely make these again and again!

I made these according to the recipe and I thought they were pretty bad.  I don't know why, but the flavor was not good at all.  I only had a couple bites, and that was all I could eat.  I know so many people loved these.  It's all a matter of personal taste I guess!

They're fantastic!  Didn't change a thing!  For those of you who ended up with thin brownies...you may be over-mixing them. Brownies are best hand stirred, and not over-mixed. Mine were thick, chewy and fluffy and turned out great!

Never again will I make boxed brownies! These are sinful! I did change the recipe so that I used 1  1/2 cups of brown sugar and 1  1/2 cups of white sugar. I also didn't use any chocolate chips because I didn't have any on hand and they were still delicious.

These are rich and thick and SO yummy. Great in small doses. I made the recommended change of using half white sugar and half brown sugar and they were wonderful! I only gave four stars since I made it with changes to the original recipe.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would!  I didn't have any chocolate chips but these brownies were so good, I'm not sure I would add them next time if I have any.  No need to look any further for a brownie recipe.  This is perfect.  I also made it w/all white sugar w/o substituting and I wouldn't change a thing.  I'm pretty sure I've died and gone to chocolate heaven.  Tyvm Brooke!

Update:  After making this recipe several times, I finally used the chocolate chips.  Too much chocolate for me, but I love it w/o the chips!  4 stars as written, 5 w/o the chocolate chips IMO.

These were wonderful!  If you're looking for a cake-like brownie, then these are not for you.  But if you want a ooey gooey moist brownie, your search is over!  I did take the recommendation of a few other reviewers and used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I made a mint frosting and chocolate drizzle for them, and it was great!  But it's not necessary at all.  These were awesome, thanks for sharing Brooke!

Excellent brownies!!!  I had just under the suggested amount of cocoa powder (1 C), but it didn't make a difference...they were really good.  Also, I used 1 C Milk Chocolate Chips, instead of semisweet, because of what I had on hand. I used a 9x13 pan, and they were a good height.  I also drizzled them with caramel cake filling, and they were amazing!!  This was my first time making brownies from scratch.
3RD Time Making Them: Used 2 C. Sugar, 1 C. Golden Brown Sugar...did not make any other substitutions.  As always, delicious!!!

I was very disappointed in these.  They were just ok when they were still hot from the oven.  I had one the next day and they were terrible.  It tasted like they were sitting around for a couple weeks, very dry and hard.  I've made many better recipes and will not make these again.

Wow, this is very very sweet, so sweet it might give you diabetes.  I think I will put way less chocolate chips or maybe even none at all.  Very hard around the edges.  I am annoyed, because I made this to take to an officed party tomorrow.  I guess I will have to buy something tomorrow morning. If you still want to use this recipe, cut the sugar to 2 cups.

EXCELLENT! I used whole wheat flour and you couldn't even tell...I also used the 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar....decadent!! I will surely make these again...they weren't any more difficult than opening a box and so so much better!  The reason I gave it only 4 stars is the bake time...these were thick and rich, but after cooking it an additional 15 minutes, in 5 minute intervals, the edges were beginning to overbrown and the center was still very gooey....we'll see how they are tomorrow after they've cooled....if theres any left! My kids have devoured half the pan already!!

Finally!! a brownie recipe my whole family loves and it works well here in this high altitude with no adjustments. If you like a rich fudgy brownie look no further. I was skeptical at first since I have always made brownies with baking chocolate rather than cocoa powder, however, I have made these several times and they have turned out great each time. They even taste good the next day! They are certainly the best, Brooke, thank you for posting. TIPS: Always, always use real butter. Always, always use room temperature eggs. You can melt the butter in the microwave in a Pyrex cup, but only heat it until there are a few softened solid pieces in the liquid and be sure it is just warm before mixing into the egg-sugar-vanilla mixture. When mixing in the dry ingredients gently mix by hand and only just until they are mixed together, never over mix it will change the texture.  I grease and line my (non-stick) pan with parchment paper then grease the paper (that is ALL I use Crisco for in my kitchen LOL). After baking and cooling they just lift out and are then very easy to cut up.

I didn't change a thing about these brownies, and they are my new favorite brownies!  They were just the right thickness (use a 9x13 or they'll be too tall) and just the right texture. I used a glass pan, cooked them at 335 for about 45-50 min.  Will be making these over and ove again--they dissappeared!

I make a ton of recipes from this site- many that I love, but this is the first I felt I had to write about. This was far and away the best brownie recipe I have ever used. These brownies are out of this world. I didn't change a thing. Thanks, Brooke!

This is the best brownie recipe I have ever made.  I just can't say enough good things about it.  The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half and put them in a 9x9.  Do NOT make the recipe, as is, in a 9x9.  It would be WAY to much.  Great recipe Brooke!

I followed the suggestions of others and used half brown sugar/half regular sugar. Aside from that, I followed all instructions completely. While this recipe produced a very rich brownie, I just could not enjoy it. It was far too rich and too dense for me. The edges, which are usually my favorite part, were very "tough" in texture. So, I'm giving it a 4, because it was not a "bad" brownie, just not at all my taste.

I tried this recipe twice. The brownies were good, but not as amazing as I was expecting. I'd rather not go through all the trouble and just use box mix. It turns out just as good if not better.

These are THE BEST brownies ever!!! I made a few changes to suit my dietary needs but lemme just say these are the fudgiest, yummiest brownies out there. Here are my changes for making half of the mix that the recipe calls for with calories and fat grams for those who are curious. I used Green & Black's organic cocoa powder which was key to the brownies tasting very chocolatey due to its high quality. I didn't use butter as I can't have dairy. You will not be disappointed. With the below changes calories are about 2200 and fat is about 64 grams - not too bad I'd say. These are absolutely the best!  1/8 cup olive oil – 238 calories; 42 grams fat 1/8 cup + 3-4 tablespoons applesauce* - 40 calories; 0 grams fat ¾ cup white sugar – 580 calories; 0 grams fat ¾ cup brown sugar – 627 calories; 0 grams fat 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract – 20 calories; 0 grams fat 2 organic eggs – 140 calories; 9 grams fat 3/4 cup all-purpose flour – 300 calories; 0 grams fat 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder – 260 calories; 13 grams fat 1/2 teaspoon salt – 0 calories; 0 grams fat

DELICIOUS~ I needed a recipe for my students and I always test the recipes first. I'am not a sweet eater so after reading so many of the reviews I thought I would try this recipe. I baked it in a 9 x 13 x 2-inch metal cake pan at 325 degress for 40 minutes. I lightly buttered the pan and dusted pan with some sifted cocoa powder before adding the batter. It came out PERFECT in my oven. Since so many reviewers said the brownies were extremely sweet I reduced the sugars to 1 cup granulated & 1 cup brown sugar as recommended by so many. Only added 1/2 tsp. salt & 2 tsp. vanilla, used unsalted butter and added 1 c. chopped walnuts along with the 1 c. semi-sweet Hereseys choc. chips. After 40 minutes the toothpick came out clean. They came out perfect, moist and delicious. If using a GLASS baking dish, remember to lower the oven temperature by 25 degrees to 325. This maybe some of the reviewers problem when they said the brownies were hard. Also recommend everyone to buy an oven thermometer. If using salted butter, cut back on the salt. I will have my students make these for their first lesson as they are very easy and simple to make. Thanks to all for their reviews and especially to Brooke006 for the recipe.

I have a recipe that I usually use for brownie making, but it calls for bars of chocolate, and I was fresh out.  We were in the mood for brownies, so I thought I'd give this a try since the picture looked so good.  I haven't used a boxed cake or brownie mix for several years, but this recipe took me right back to the flavor and texture of boxed mix brownies, except they had too much sugar.  Also, they were too much work sifting and measuring for the same effect of a $1 box of brownie mix.

Didn't like these very much at all. Even after the full cooking time  they seemed runny in the middle and not done enough, so I had to put them in for more time. When I went to cut them the edges were as hard as a rock, and crumbly too. The taste was way too sweet, even for someone like me with a sweet tooth, with almost a gritty texture either from all the sugar or the extra baking.

These brownies came out absolutely perfect.  I was cautiously optimistic when I saw how much sugar the recipe called for but I followed the recipe exactly and they came out better than any other recipe I have ever tried.  I will be using this recipe from now on.

My first thought after tasting them was "Whew, thank goodness". I had never made brownies from scratch before, since I dont typically like the way they taste as opposed to the box, and I was nervous. However, I was very, very impressed with these. The first time I used half brown sugar and half white as many other reviewers did, and melted my dark chocolate because I too dont like "stuff" in my brownies. They were great, but the picky boyfriend who prefers milk chocolate thought they were too rich (I thought they were great). The second time around I used all white sugar and Hershey's chocolate and he devoured the pan before I could get them all cut. Final vote: amazing any way you slice it, no matter what kind of chocolate or sugar. I have no reason to go back to the box ever again. So fast to make too! Thanks Brooke, you're awesome :)

These were ok but to much chocolate for me. Not a recipe I would make again. I made them and took them to work and even one of the ladies said there was just to much chocolate and she loves chocolate.

I had high hopes for this recipe given the reviews that I read.  However, it was too "bitter" chocolate tasting for me.  I think I would decrease the cocoa if I made it again.  As far as thickness, someone mentioned that it was not a very thick brownie in the 9X13 pan, but they were actually as thick or a little thicker than what you have with a box mix.

I hope I am done shaking from my sugar high enough to write this review!   WOW, are these RICH!!!  I have to say that I have never been able to taste the richness of butter in a brownie recipe before like I did in this recipe!  Don't get me wrong, it's wonderful, but just so darn rich!  I never thought I would complain about the "richness" of a brownie before; what's wrong with me??!!  Anyway, good, dense brownie; not for the lightweight brownie lover!  Slightly too sweet; thanks for sharing this with us!

just made these and they are the best brownies i have made from scratch!(and i have made alot) i did use 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of baking powder as suggested. i personally do not like the thicker crust so i will use 1 tsp of salt next time. this is one to keep and pass down! *update* although i have made these a few times, the hubby wanted me to add a peanut butter taste to the mix. he says he liked them but they are too rich(as i have heard alot of people saying, but i did notthink so) so i used a cream cheese peanut butter mix and marbled the brownies. it kid of evened out the sweetness.  8 oz. of cream cheese, soft 1/2 c. creamy peanut butter 1 egg, room temp. and 2 tbsp. cold milk(we use 2%) -blend together well till fluffy. i have tried a few different ways but i have found spooning the cream cheese mix in rows and taking a knife and marbling with the brownie mix is the best way! enjoy! *NOTE* do NOT try to layer the cream cheese and brownie mix(a bottom layer of brownie, then cream cheese, then brownie, then cream cheese again) i have fund that this does not allow the brownie mix to bake all the way on the inside!

These fully live up to their name & good reviews! They are, hands down, the BEST brownies I've ever had in my life. SUPER easy to make... My friend who is NOT a cooker and I came home late and were starving. She put these together quickly while I made us dinner... If she can do this, ANYONE can. As per other reviewers, we did 1 cup brown, 2 white sugar. We subbed milk chocolate chips and they create little 'chocolate pockets' in there that are soooo delectible. We baked it 30 mins cause we wanted them to be super gooey and fudgey and they were. Next time I'll bake them exactly 35 mins though cause the edges were perfect. Definately take out before toothpick says done or they'd be hard and un-fudgey. Grease your pan WELL... we rubbed butter on it and they came out pretty ok, but were much better set up the next day. I think these would make good individual brownies in muffin tins (and reduce baking time). Then make turtle or tin roof brownie sundaes... Decadence at it's finest!!!

They were good, but from all the hype I had high expectations that weren't met. I made them twice, once as written, the second time with canola oil. There wasn't much difference only I feel it makes them not quite as bad for you. But will still keep looking for brownie nirvana. Update: the recipe on the back of nestle pre melted unsweet choc. is much better with some help...1 and 1/2 it, and add 1 cup mini chocolate chips.My family and friends were much happier with the result.

These were just not that great.  In a word they were... raw.  I am all for gooey, but the edges were burning and I had to take these out and the middle was just raw...  They never set up, and yes, I followed the recipe.  I will keep looking for a great fudgy brownie recipe.

These brownies were amazing!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe.... I will make these from now on.  If you are debating between this recipe and another... chose this recipe, you wont be sorry.  It is half the fat of most other recipes and it tastes so much better.  I actually did a little experiment.  I couldn't decide between this recipe and the One Bowl Brownies recipe from this site (because the picture looked so good), so I halved both recipes twice and made a little baby pan of each and my boyfriend and I both decided that these were a MILLION times better.  These will go into my secret recipe book... Thank you again!!!

Sooooo good, soooo rich, soooo easy. I followed the recipe with only a few little changes. I added about twice the called for chocolate chips and I coated them with a little flour before mixing in so they wouldnt fall to the bottom. I also put some white chocolate in a double boiler, threw it in a ziploc, cut the tip and drizzled it all over the brownies. Delicious! They look like something you would buy from a bakery!

"This is the best brownie I've ever eaten," said one of my roommates. And these are quite delicious. I bet they'd be even better with chocolate chunks in place of the chips. I made them days ago and the one I saved in the fridge was still moist and delicious on the inside.

These are great. Much better than the "mmmm... brownies" recipe which I found too cakey. I cut the sugar to 2 cups and they turned out fine. I think 3 cups might have made them too sweet actually. I also swirled seedless raspberry jam on top, but the rest of the recipe was the same.

I recommend lining the pan with parchment as they turn out quite sticky.

An extremely fudgy brownie. The first time I made these I kept checking/toothpicking them which prolonged the cooking time and also made them a tad underdone. The second time I just left them in the oven until the timer sounded. Very tasty but you have to be craving a VERY fudgy brownie - awesome with vanilla bean ice cream.

Healthy Version: I am constantly looking for brownie recipies that I can tweak to be truly healthy.  This is one of them.  I substituted the flour for all purpose gluten free flour (made with BROWN rice flour).  You need to add some moisture when you use gluten free flour(I added a cup of water).  I then used 2 cups turbinado sugar instead of the white sugar.  Sun sweet makes a great butter replacement that can be found in the oil section of your market.  It's a fruit paste that doesn't smell great (like prune gooop) but works as a butter replacement and the flavor disappears.  I got was a dense and gooey brownie that tasted healthy but decadent.  I would even cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups.

These brownies turned out to be ultra rich.
My boyfriend loved these brownies. 
I thought they were a bit too sweet however, and I had even cut 3/4 c. sugar off from the recommended amt.

The texture and look of these brownies was great, but I can't get over the amount of sugar in the recipe!  I love desserts, bake all of the time, eat way too many sweets, but even I thought that these were just crazy sweet.  I'll definitely make them again, but will try slowly cutting back on the sugar until I find an amount that works for me.  Otherwise, thanks for a great recipe!
**Update: For me, 2 cups of sugar is great and still makes a super rich, yummy brownie!

These were very good, but just a bit greasy. I put some peanut butter on top before I baked it, and liked that more than just the plain chocolate.

BEST BROWNIES EVER!!!! The first time I made these I took the advice of the other reviewers and did 1 1/2 of white sugar and 1 1/2 of brown sugar. They were very good.

The second time I made these I did exactly what the recipe said and did the 3 cups of white sugar. These were much better. I'm doing it this way from now on.  

The brownies are good the first day. They are AWESOME the second day. I can't get enough of these brownies.

These were really sweet, so next time I will cut the sugar a bit. But we did love the rich chewy texture. I also like the fact the recipe calls for cocoa powder instead of bars, I ALWAYS have that on hand!

This is the most amazing brownie recipe I've ever made.  I love fudgy brownies.  I don't consider "cake-like" brownies to be brownies...i consider them to be cake.  Anyway, these are my downfall.  In theory, I bake them so that my diabetic boyfriend has something delicious to save him if his sugar gets low.  In practice, I eat 90 percent of them and will probably end up developing diabetes myself.

I've found my perfect brownie recipe!  I brought these to a pot luck at our church and boy did they ever go!!!!  They were the fastest and hottest dessert going. I like my brownies chewy on the inside so I baked them only 29 minutes and they came out perfect.  I also added an extra cup of chocolate chips, because, well, how can you go wrong with chocolate chips!?! ;-)  This may be a tradition at our monthly prayer meetings everyone liked them so much and they were pleasure to bake.

I will never buy a boxed brownie mix again.  Not only was this easy, but it was the best brownie I have ever eaten!

I used semi sweet chocolate chunks instead of chips.  Followed the recipe to a T - don't change a thing!

This is the one you've been looking for, seriously! Chewy and wonderfully fudgy, my old recipe I loved so much is in the trash! Must be all that cocoa! Followed recipe exactly this time, but I think you could leave the chocolate chips out and it would still be the best brownie recipe out there.

One word:  Delicious!  I have made many, many pans of brownies and these have to be the best.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar at the suggestion of other reviewers.  The top was crispy and the inside was dense and fudgy.  This is my new favorite brownie recipe.

Holy cow!!!! These brownies are absolutely scrumptious!!!!  They were more chewy instead of cake-like which is how I think a brownie should be.  I prepared it exactly as directed, and I wouldn't change a thing!!

I would definately say that these are the best homemade brownies that I have ever made!  I followed the recipe exact...not one single change.  The top came out crispy and the center is chewy and fudgy.

Excellent brownies.  I feel that the chocolate morsels were a bit over the top and would half the amount next time as it made them super sweet.  Otherwise, they are perfect right out of the oven with a big glass of milk!

I hate to be the party pooper here but my family and I didn't like these brownies. I took them out of the oven at 35 minutes and the bottoms were burnt and the middle wasn't finished cooking.

If I lived in the US, I would run out to the store and grab a box of brownie mix - easy, yummy, done.
But since I now live in Europe, I've had to find ways to make things the old-fashioned, homemade way, and THIS is my new brownie recipe!
My only change was to add a small cup of espresso coffee (as a liquid, not just a powder mix) to enhance the chocolate flavor and these brownies are perfect! Moist inside and crunchy on the edges and so chocolatey! Thanks Brooke!

Oh my goodness!  Glorious Chocolate!  I used milk chocolate chips because that was all I had.  I loved them.  Thank you for giving me a brownie recipe that does not require melting chocolate!!!!!!  We made these three days in a row.  (Chocolate cravings hit.)

For those of you that aren’t dark chocolate lovers – this recipe isn’t for you. 3 cups of sugar IS a lot.  We decreased (slightly) to 1 ¼ c white & 1 ¼ brown. Good recipe.

Amazing! Omitted the chocolate chips because we were out. Cut the recipe in half and baked in 9" pie pan for 23 minutes, or until the outside was done but the middle was still gooey. Refrigerated the brownies due to the goey middle which turned into a sort of fudge when chilled. Amazing!! i will make these true to recipe next time, but I'm already pretty sure these are my favorite brownies. I have a feeling finding this recipe was not good for my waist line. I wan to make these brownies again already!!

Excellent fudgey brownie, the way brownies should be! Used a bag of mini dark chocolate Rolos for the chocolate chips, 40 minutes perfect in my oven, line pan with foil for easy removal.

These were really good! I think I just baked them too long, they formed a crunchy top which I don't like.  They had a very good taste and were easy to make. I will make them again, just not too long.

Where have these brownies been all my life? At first I thought the batter might just be too thick. But it's perfect in the end. Chewy and crisp on the outside, and gooey in the middle. The perfect brownie! My only advice? Grease your pan well!! The sugar makes these stick to the pan. Baked 35 mins exactly and perfect! Thanks Brooke!

WOW!! OK..So I tried this recipe as is and then I took the suggestion of others to do half brown sugar and half white sugar. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. These were hands down the best brownies I have ever made. Usually my brownies turn out either overcooked or undercooked. These were the perfect fudgey brownies. This will be my go to recipe for now on!

My husband loved it, it reminds him of his childhood memory. It turned out fudgy as he like. I didnt even put the Choco chip but still turns out great. But to me it's a little bit too sweet.

These were terrible. Tasted like butter with sugar, very hard to taste the chocolate. Baked them an extra 10 mins due to gooeyness. The next day the edges were hard as a rock with the center being very oily.

THESE WERE AMAZING. They were chewy, fudgy and gooey all at the same time. My entire family LOVED them and they tasted even better than a box mix! (I never though I would say that). These are definitely a keeper and I know I'm going to be making these again soon. The batter was also delicious.

I have searched for years for a home made brownie recipe that turned thick and fudgy, with the crunchy, crackly top and extra chewy corner pieces. I made this recipe this week for first time after reading a few reviews. Can't imagine not liking these unless you prefer a dry cake brownie, hey, that is why God made cake!
3 cups of sugar seems like a lot, but I did not think they were too sweet and I have a super sensitive taster, one cup of butter is a lot too, and so are 4 eggs. The batter was amazing, super thick and I could tell then how good they were gonna be, was consistency of a thick creamy frosting. If you fit this recipe in a 9 X 9 pan, you are a magician. This batter filled my 9 X 13 pan over the halfway mark.
My only advice is don't overbake. I read that toothpick should come out clean and baked an extra 10+ 15 minutes so the edge pieces were
a bit more crunchy ie. crumbly,but everyone that tried them loved them.
So, the only change I made was adding some walnuts, may try the mini chips next time. Pretty sure these would be fantastic without chips also. Will never use another box mix. My goal now is to adapt to gluten free!

These are super rich and they disappear fast! I used half white sugar, half brown sugar. I'd also like to try peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips. I bet that'd be delicious!

These are complete perfection! I followed the recipe exactly except I put toasted coconut on half before baking just because that's what I like. I used a 9x13 pan and they were thick, chewy, chocolatey rich, and chewy all in one. The best brownie I've ever eaten EVER!

I wish you can rate negative stars. These are by far the worst brownies ever!!! Followed the recipe exactly, and the batter was like cement. Lined the baking pan with foil and sprayed it a little so the brownies didnt stick and that is the only thing that worked. The batter was so hard to spread in the baking pan. These brownies came out so insanely dry, not fudgy AT ALL! They also taste like they are missing something.

A very fudgy and chewy brownie, just the way my DH likes them.  They are also very rich and chocolaty.  I made as written and they were done in 35 minutes.  I froze half a pan for lunches and they were just a good defrosted as they were eaten freshly baked.  A very good recipe that I will be using again.

I made just like the recipe. My husband thought they were a little sweeter than he would've liked, served as Alamode. Living in Denver with high altitude, probably cut back on bake time. They weren't as thick, but definitely good and chewy. Will make them again.

Oh. My. Goodness.  I am new to from-scratch cooking, so these were my first brownies that didn't come from a box or tube.  The batter was very thick, so I thought I had done something wrong.  At 35 minutes a toothpick came out clean, so again I thought I had done something wrong.  They barely spread out or puffed up during their time in the oven.  I baked them on parchment paper, so the following morning I lifted the cooled brownies from the pan and easily sliced them with a pizza wheel.  There was no shredding, no crumbling, and the tops remained perfect.  What I thought was going to be a flop ended up resulting in the most fudgy, perfect, moist, and crispy topped brownies.  These were the ones I always wished my Mom made when I was a kid.  One taster described them as being 'like Little Debbie brownies, but with flavor'.  I made exactly as directed, except I used half brown and half white sugar and I used a bag of Mini Rolo candy in place of the chocolate chips. I already have a request for two more batches tomorrow!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe, Brooke!

These were very easy to throw together and had both great texture and flavor.  Very chewy, fudgy and rich!  Would liked to have had pecans or walnuts in them to cut the richness.  Next time.  And there WILL be a next time.  Great recipe.

I would have given this a 5 but I had to change the egg amount to 3 eggs to really get a fudgie brownie. Other than that this is a great brownie recipie, very easy and so much better than a box mix.

This is absolutely the best brownie recipe. no tweaking necessary. I add chopped pecans, walnuts or hazelnuts. I always have to do mutilpe batches. They go that quickly and someone always ask for the recipe. Going to do 4 batches right now to put into my Christmas treat bags.

This is the perfect brownie for anyone who loves sweet, fudgy brownies.  I personally prefer a more cake-like brownie and had my doubts when making this when I saw no leavening agent, but these were good for a change.

Truly the BEST brownie recipe!!! I've been making boxed brownies for years, and when ever I tried a new brownie recipe it was never as good so would go back to boxed. Until now THIS IS THE RECIPE!! I read a lot of the reviews, and based on that I did everything the same except I took one suggestion. I put in only a half a teaspoon of salt, and added a half a teaspoon of baking soda, everything else I followed the recipe to a T. I also didn't beat my eggs much, but I never do when making brownies. They are SO nice and chocolaty fudge like, chewy, and it makes A LOT. I baked mine for 35 minutes and they were perfect (even the ends). Try them but take heed and follow the recipe, you won't be disappointed if you like rich fudge like brownies. Thank you SO much Brooke for sharing this GREAT recipe!!

This recipe is really good.  I've found that chocolate chips tend to stay too firm once the brownies cooled so I've switched to using a chopped 3 to 3.5oz semisweet chocolate bar instead.  The bar chocolate isn't formulated to hold it's shape as firmly once heated and so stays softer while barely holding it's shape in baked goods.  For a more intense chocolate flavor and fudgier brownie, add a couple of ounces of dark chocolate to melt with the butter and continue with the recipe as written.

Absolutely delicious!  Very rich, sweet and chocolately.  I've made a recipe very similar to this for years.  A couple of things that might alleviate a few of the complaints:  When beating the melted butter, sugar and vanilla, beat at high speed until it turns a very pale yellow (5 minutes). This will allow the sugar to completely dissolve and give it volume.  Add eggs as instructed and then stir in the cocoa powder and flour at a very low speed or by hand.  Do not overbake as that will cause the dryness.  They will look rather undone while still hot but will firm up nicely as they cool.
They are sweet and fudgy....so if you like less sweet, more cakelike brownie these are not for you.

This recipe yields a very nice texture of brownies
batch just as it stated - fudgy and not cakey. 

i like how my brownies turned out but i give it a 4 star as it is just way too sweet. i usually cut down sugar on recipe and would be fine but this one i cut down to 1cup brown and 1cup white sugar it is still too sweet. 
i use 58% begium chocolate buttons and chop them apart into two to three pieces and the brownies turn out fudgy and nice. 

and also for anyone who's new to baking, be careful: the recipe says to take out from the oven when tester comes out clean. If it comes out clean that means your brownie is too dry. The tester should have a few crumbs clinging to it. 

overall this brownie is quite lovely and it is worth trying :)

I found the brownies a little too dense, when I first made them, but the taste was brilliant. I used 1/2 a cup of guinness when I made them again which made them a bit more fluffy and also more balanced flavour-wise

I have NEVER made a brownie come out as good as these. This will be a KEEPER forever. A 9x13 pan with fantastic texture, taste and fudgeyness but not too fudgey.

Reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added some molasses (to make it brown sugar).  Also used a generous 1/2 cup chocolate chips b/c it was what I had, and I think it was enough.  Otherwise I made the recipe as listed and I really enjoyed it.

Plan to make some cream cheese icing tomorrow to go with them.

I made this for friends and it was very disappointing. They commented on how it was not my usual desert as my deserts are usually full proof.  It turned out dry and very cake like. The sides were so hard, I had to cut them off. Ended up making chocolate sauce to finish eating them at home.  
Considering the ingrediences needed to make these, it was a waste
Will not make them again.

Don't know what all the hype was about these.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not care for them.  I am a pretty good baker but these were dry and tasted like something was missing (and yes, I double checked to make sure I included everything).

Awesome brownie!!! I added 1 tsp of instant espresso powder to flour mixture and used 60% cacao chips (personal preference to use dark chocolate) but otherwise didn't change a thing. Fudgey and great chocolate flavor! Baked in a metal pan for minimum time. Not sure how some are getting a dry brownie.

I was making this recipe for the umpteenth time, but I ran out of some ingredients so had to make some adjustments. I used only 3/4 cup cocoa powder and 2 1/2 cups sugar, and replaced 1 stick of butter with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. They taste even better and no one can detect the applesauce. Before, I had trouble with the edges of the brownies becoming too hard after I cut them, but now they're perfect!

Instead of 1 1/2 c white sugar and 1 1/2 brown sugar, next time i will used 2 c white, 1 c brown. It was too bitter, but the texture was great.

These turned out strange to me I felt like there was an ingredient missing. It was like butter fried chocolate. I will be looking for a more fluffy/chewy recpie.

Baked almost as directed (a little less sugar) and they were fabulous! I have always loved box mix brownies because they are more fudgey but I will be doing these from now on - very fudgey and dense. Yum!

This is the FIRST time I've ever submitted a review (and I use all recipes ALL the time.)  I just made these yesterday for my son's theater cast party.  OH MY GOODNESS......they are incredible.  I will never buy a boxed mix again.  I have always loved the Ghirardelli brownie box mix BUT these are far and away better than those.  If you love chocolate, these are for you.  FYI - I used a large "half sheet" bar pan (from Sam's Club).  I made the recipe bigger for doing it at 1 1/2 the quantity and that was the perfect amount of batter for a pan that size.)  ENJOY!!!

They are perfect! The first brownie recipe that never went wrong. The only thing I changed is the sugar amounts. Instead of 3 cups of white sugar I put 1.5 cups of white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Other than that I followed the recipe as is. 
I tried them with walnuts, with chocolate chips and without anything and they all were perfect.

These were amazing! I have made them twice now and tried them the original recipe way with sugar and the viewers tip way with brown sugar added in place of some of the sugar. Out of the two, hands down the brown sugar one was better. Flavor and texture. But both were terrific brownies. Also some mentioned that a 8x11 pan made to thin of brownies, I thought they were perfect. any thicker and it would have been cake no brownies. Will make again, and again.....and again!!

Would have gave 5 but I did the half and half with the brown and white sugar. They tasted great but I think they would have been perfect with all white sugar. The brown gave it a maple flavor almost. Also, they are better the longer they sit. I also didnt have chocolate chips but I had some duncan hines pour over chocolate frosting that I added. Not bad! Loved the texture.

They tasted OK, but they were cake-like, crumbly, and very dry. I would recommend to reduce the amount of eggs to about two, at the most.

This was fantastic! I know some people HATE when you change the original recipie but I will just say what I did. I kept everything the same except I used 3/4c butter, a tad more cocoa powder, and just over 2 cups of sugar. I just wanted to cut down on some of the sweetness. These were great brownies!

Delicious.  These brownies are so fudgy and rich.  One bite and I'm in paradise.  Make this recipe planning to share: they are in fact so rich and dense and need a crowd to finish them off.  That's okay though, because everyone you share them with will want to kiss you.

These brownies are AWESOME! Thick, dense, sweet, and super fudgy! To the people that are giving these brownies a low rating because they are "too sweet," shouldn't you have known they were going to be super sweet with the three cups of sugar in the recipe?

Quite simply the perfect brownie recipe.  Do not reduce the amount of sugar called for; you will not have good results as the sugar helps maintain the structure and texture of this brownie.  It's frustrating to read people giving low ratings to this then seeing that they used half the sugar!  

The only thing I changed was that I added more than a cup of chopped dark chocolate, instead of the cup of chocolate chips.  They were perfection.  I rarely write reviews but I had to for this!

The texture of the brownie was super moist and fudgy - just how I like them! However, it was still too sweet despite using only 2 cups of sugar instead of the 3 cups called for in the recipe.

AWESOME!!! Wow! I did not do anything to this recipe! It is perfect as it is. A nice crunchy little shell on top; gooey and rich in the middle. I will definitely make this recipe again and again! I love simple recipes that you can make without going to the store!

Yum, yum, yum! I was looking for a chewy, moist brownie. This is it! The brownie of my dreams. I did use half brown sugar, half white sugar as one of the reviewers suggested. This will be my go to brownie recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic...crisp top chewy inside.  Subbed half brown sugar for the granulated.  Dense and flavorful.  Also add coffee powder if I have it.

Best brownies I have ever had in my life! I found these a couple of years ago when I was on a quest for the perfect brownie and I've never looked back! Dark and fudgy these are the perfect chocolate lovers brownies. WARNING! If you like cakey, mild brownies then these are NOT for you!

I have searched for quite sometime for a recipe that tastes like the box brownies.  One day my boys told me to give up and just use the box.  I think I have finally found the recipe they will let me bake.  I can't wait for the boys to come home so they can taste Brook's Brownies.  I made the recipe exactly as is except I added the eggs and sugar and I added the cocoa to the melted butter.  I used the full 3 cups of sugar and they were moist, chewy and chocolately.  I did not put the chocolate chips in and I think one could easily over bake these, but take out even if a little sticks to the toothpick.

WOW, These are fabulous! Taste and texture is just what I was looking for. Not to cake-y and not to heavy. I did a half recipe and it turned out great. Thanks for sharing, this is going into my box.

Absolutely YUM!  I was nervous never having made brownies without baking powder.... but they were wonderful!  Took the suggestion and put in 1 cup brown sugar to 2 parts white sugar, just happened to have some really dark cocoa, and they were so rich and flavourful... Thank you!

These turned out very thick and dense, as described. Cook for a lesser amount of time so that it's not entirely "cake-like". I finished mine with the Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting found on this site and everyone LOVED it! Rich but so good!!

These were really fudgy and chewy just the way I like them.  My only complaint was they tasted a little too much like cocoa powder flavor... I used Hershey's cocoa powder and followed the recipe exactly.

Saw this like an hour ago, and since that time I have already gathered ingredients, made it per the directions without changes or substitutions, baked them and ate them. Ok, ate 3 b/c they're still a bit warm. Sitting here writing the review b/c they're pretty friggin great. Give them a try if you were on the fence!

These were probably some of the best brownies I've ever had! They were very chewy on the outside and fudgy & soft in the inside. I'm 14 & I made these from scratch, they were way better than the brownie mix you buy in a store.

I have been trying different brownie recipes for 20 years and every time my husband tells me he likes the box brownie better.  I made these and he said, "wow--these are the best brownies you have ever made--they are even better than the box brownies!"  I never thought I would see the day he would say that!  I did not change the recipe, but I did double the recipe and cook it in a sheet cake pan and they turned out perfect!  Not too thick, not too thin and cooked perfectly through.

These brownies are awesome!  I used a pan slightly smaller than 9x13 & it was perfect.  I've tried a lot of brownies recipes and this is one of the best & easiest since it doesn't require melting chocolate. Nicely done Brooke.

I've tried for years to make brownies from scratch that come close to boxed brownies - this recipe comes the closest by far. My families only comment was that they were perhaps too chocolatey - imagine! I cut back on the chocolate chips a bit now. Note: the brand of cocoa powder that you use will make a huge difference in how these taste. The more expensive, higher quality cocoa - the better tasting these will be.

YES!!!  THIS is a brownie recipe.  Only thing I changed was I used 1 1/2 C white sugar and 1 1/2 C brown sugar.

Best Brownies Ever! Especially good if you add about a 1/2 teaspoon more vanilla.  I also added more chocolate chips.

These were delicious! I made a half recipe in an 8x8 pan since I was short on eggs and butter. I followed it almost exactly except for using 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. They were the perfect consistancy. I didn't have chocolate chips but I will use them next time cuz I think they will taste delicious in this recipe. 25 minutes was not enough for this smaller pan but 30 minutes was PERFECT. Will make again and again (delicious with butter pecan ice cream).

I followed advice of other reviewers and decreased the sugar to 2 cups and the bake time to 25 minutes.  With these changes they turned out perfect.  Any more than 30 minutes baking time and these would have turned into biscotti.  I don't like overly sweet desserts and 2 cups sugar was the perfect amount for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really like this recipe for brownies because it actually turned out like brownies!! I've tried another recipe and it was a goopy mess! I followed another reviewers suggestion and I really beat the egg into the batter one by one which made it airy and delicious.  I did have to cook this for longer because I didn't have the right size pan. I omitted the chocolate chips because it just seemed like a little too much.  I wanted sweet not diabetic shock! lol! :) The ONE thing is the butter. You can taste the butter more than you can anything else, so next time I will reduce it to 3/4 of a cup and add some nuts.  This is a REALLY good brownie recipe and definitely worth trying it. You can even prep the dry ingredients before hand or wrap it up in a pretty tin and write out the wet ingredient directions for a gift. :) Good first shot, maybe a couple little tweeks and it will be perfect! :)

Very good recipe. I only made one change, I used 2 1/2 cups sugar rather than 3. Even with this change I think they are a bit too sweet, next time I will use 2 cups of sugar.

I followed the recipe as directed and the brownies came out perfectly! I made three batches and took to work and they lasted two hours at most. Their the moist gooey brownies I wanted. I baked mine in pumpkin silicone pans and they came out very nicely. Will do again!

I made these exactly as directed so since I'm allergic to dairy, I cannot eat them.  However, my husband cut into the corner to test them and his only comment was "yeah, these are gonna go pretty quick."  To anyone who commented that these were flat, beat your eggs THOROUGHLY after each addition.  I use a Kitchenaid mixer and beat each egg on speed 4-5 until completely beaten.  The eggs are the leavener in this recipe so you have to beat them in order to get the brownies to rise properly.  Try this and it will be better.

I thoroughly enjoyed these. Was barely able to scrape up a half a cup of butter, so I substituted the other half with applesauce (I hear this is a WeightWatchers trick). Couldn't taste the difference and turned out perfectly moist.

Made these tonight - 17yo son's request to make brownies - we're having a hurricane so why not!?!  Made them *exactly* to the recipe.  A little thin for my tastes, would like them just a bit thicker.  Son really liked them though!  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful! I'm teaching my daughter to cook and this is the first recipe we've made. The brownies are very rich and delicious.
Several people mentioned that they cam out too thin so I used an 8x11 baking dish. They took longer to bake, but they are perfect.

These are excellent! As is, I have had some complaints that they have too much chocolate in them. I suggest that you only make this for those who love dark chocolate overload; personally, I enjoy some additional chocolate icing on them. :) You can add in nuts for more flavor or substitute mint or peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips. I also sometimes throw in a few tablespoons of sour cream for additional moisture and substitute half brown sugar for the white sugar, but it's definitely not necessary.

Mixed review for this one. The texture is great - chewy with a nice edge, but for me, they're too sweet. My son, however, thinks they're perfect.

Found these when looking for something to use up lots of eggs and now we make these all the time!  They always turn out phenomenal no matter if it's me or the kids making them. Only thing not I would recommend is to LIBERALLY grease your pan - these are STICKY!  I have added everything from peanut butter or butterscotch chips to mini marshmallows - you can even mix the cocoa with the melted butter if so desired and you just can't mess it up! I do agree with several reviews that this makes a very thick brownie in a 9x13 pan and so I use a casserole dish.  They still come out just less than inch thick.  Great recipe!

Wow these brownies are amazing! They are the perfect mix between cakey and fudgey! I made Oreo Brownies with this recipe by:
1. Putting only half the cocoa the recipes calls for.
2. Add 1/4 cup hot fudge sauce with the eggs and vanilla.
3. Add 14 crushed Oreos with the chocolate chips.
AMAZING! They were gone in a few hours.

Never going to need another brownie recipe...ever!

This is by far the best brownie recipe I have ever used! My family loves them and requests them all the time. However, I would suggest cutting them small because they are VERY rich and delicious!

I made these a few times, and this past weekend for a family picnic. My brother who is a brownie "expert" LOVED them, a big hit. I am making another batch for a school function. Thanks

I thought these were really good and quite decadent.  We had vanilla frozen yogurt with them while still warm.  I found that they were just a bit too rich for me overall.

these came out great. used a smaller tin as someone suggested. thought the sugar was a little much so just used 1 cup and then alterated the cocoa to half a cup and used 2 cups of flour.  thanks for sharing!

These are indeed the bomb! I hadn't made brownies from scratch in ages, but the chewy thick chocolatey amazingness was delicious :) It did take longer to make them than I expected (prep-time-wise) but they were really good.

Perfect, moist brownies. This is the brownie recipe all others should be judged by. 
Footnote: Half the ingredients for smaller batch and bake in an 8" X 8" tin.

Super rich brownie... definately one that people who love heavey brownies will enjoy... if you are looking for a light cake like brownie this is not one for you... next time I will try using half brown and half white sugar as recommended by other reviewers to see how they turn out... but as written they are super rich and delishice... and not so healthy...

These brownies are great! First brownies I've made that wasn't from a box. First time I made them I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. The second time I made them I used 3 cups of white sugar and 2/3 cup of chocolate chips and they still turned out great, they would even be good without chocolate chips. Everyone LOVED them!! Some reviews said they were to sweet but for me and my family they were perfect. 
 Great basic recipe, next time I might try these with mini M&M's, and nuts.

These definitely stuck to the pans (I tried to make brownie bites using a mini cupcake pan and also made a regular 9x13" pan of them)!  I will use cupcake wrappers or line the big pan with parchment paper next time, but there WILL be a next time.  Even as a big pile of smushed brownie mess, these got amazing compliments from my husband, my girlfriends, and everyone else who tasted them.  I will probably use brown sugar next time, just because I think anything chocolate needs brown, rather than white, sugar (I was out this time).  All-in-all a PERFECT brownie recipe!  YUM!!!

First time i did these after reading reviews i messed around a lot with the recipe and they came out too dry and thin.  The second time they were too cakey and thick.  I didnt give up because allthough i had got them all wrong twice the flavour was still the best just not the texture.  The third time i did them i reduced the sugar by 100g (1/6th) and baked in a tray 11 x 9 although i did have to cook them for just over 40 minutes and they were absolutely perfect.  I got exactly what i was looking for, each brownie really did give a crispy top, fudgy centre with a cakey surround and a chewy afterbite all in one go and the thickness/height was exactly what i wanted.   i made them again and added some chopped pecans for some crunch and now have exactly what i have tried many different brownie recipes looking for.  I have had good other brownie recipes before but always wanted a better one.  Brookes brownies taste i feel is what really makes this a great recipe as the chocolate is intense but not too dark choclatey more a cocoa chocolate taste if that makes sense.  For me it was getting the sugar right as i did think they were too sweet whilst not losing the texture i am going to next time try the brown/ white suger as others have but am scared i will ruin them again as is just right but i do think brown sugar could add something too Thanks Brooke !!!!

We love this recipe now.  I've made them three times in the past few weeks and the kids (and my husband) can't get enough of them.  Great taste and very easy to make.  I used 2 cups of white and one cup of brown sugar instead of all 3 white.  LOVE these!!

Finally, the perfect brownie recipe!  The edges were crunchy and chewy and the rest was fudgy and moist.  These were better than any boxed brownie I have ever had.  Thank you so much for sharing your brownie masterpiece, Brooke!  I made these exactly as instructed, but I added about 1/4 cup of chocolate syrup and baked for 40 minutes.

This is my kind of brownies based on texture and chewy-nes. But 3 cups of sugar is way to sweet for me... next time I'll make it 1,5 cups instead. Other than that, all is perfecto!

I'm giving this 3 stars due to texture, alone, after a few hours.   The taste is pretty spectacular but they did become "brittle" almost.  I think probably due to the amount of sugar.  I'm going to make them again but I'm going to try confectioner's sugar and a smaller amount and see if that helps it not become almost crystalline.  Thanks for a really good start!  I'm not giving up on this one because the taste is so good.

I followed the recipe as written.  I'm a huge brownie fan and I think this is the 4th or 5th recipe I've tried for them from this site.  The flavor was good, a little too sugary.  I thought they were tasty right out of the oven and even slightly cooled; however, the next day I didn't like the texture at all.  It was a pretty big recipe to just eat one piece the night I made them then throw them out.  I didn't want to be that wasteful, so I cut them into squares and froze them to throw in my daughter's school lunches.  She seems to like them that way and I didn't have to toss them.

WOW!!!  Soooo good!  Very moist yet the sides were chewy just like we like them.  Baked for exactly 40 minutes.  As a holiday alternative put half the batter in the pan, added a layer of Andes mints (full mints, not the bits) and then topped with the rest of the batter.  Yum!

Awesome.  Thick, fudgy and chewy!  Followed the recipe exactly, baked in a 13 x 9, just had to increase cooking time to around 40-45 mins.

UPDATE:  These are awesome the first day, however they do NOT store well.  As others mentioned, the next day they get quite hard around the edges (I had cut the whole batch into squares and stored in a gallon plastic ziploc bag).  Microwaving for 10 seconds makes them awesome again, but I would recommend making these the day you want to eat them.

These are by far the best brownies I've ever made. I used the "frosting" from the Best Brownies recipe and it tastes like a thin layer of fudge on top of a very delicious brownie. How can you go wrong? Be VERY careful not to overmix these brownies or else they will come out flat and way too dense.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I cooked the brownies in a ceraminc 9x13 pan.  After 28 minutes the edges were done and the toothpick came out pretty clean (considering the chocolated chips).  I took them out and let them cool.  The edges were done but the center was undercooked slightly (had to toss those out).  Next time, if there is a next time, I will cook for about 5 minutes longer.  They tasted good though.

These were really yummy.  I don't think I will add chocolate chips next time.  Just a personal preference.  I used a mini muffin tin to bake (several batches this way) since I was making them for Christmas gifts.  For some reason I had a huge problem getting them out of the tin.  I spray the pan lightly the first time and heavily the second time and still had problems.  A problem I have never had with a box recipe before.  are the perfect brownies as the recipes states?  Far from it, but they are better then a mix.  I would make them again, just not in a mini muffin tin.

These were delicious but taste very similar to the Ghirardelli chocolate brownie box mix so although i do give it 5 stars i think next time i'm going to just buy the box and save some time.

Just made these for a party the other night!!! They are so delicious! There were only 8 of us there and about half the pan was gone at the end of the night! I am going to try and do 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar this time and see how that goes....but if you make these as the recipe calls for, you will not be disappointed!!! Thanks Brooke!!!

They were very powdery and dry and too sweet. It's very rare that I complain about a brownie, but these were pretty bad.

these brownies are to die for.  after reading a few reviews saying the 9x13 yielded a thin brownie, i made them in an 11x7 pan, and they were perfectly thick and delicious and wonderful.  i will never make another brownie recipe again, boxed or homemade or otherwise.

I don't know if anyone else had any trouble like this.  Maybe it's the altitude (I live at 5000 feet), but the first time I made these brownies they were burned on the outside and liquid in the middle.  Weird, I know.  So I tried them agian, and the same thing happened.  I finally lowered the temperature to 325 degrees F. and kept checking them until they looked done.  It took 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook.  They were perfect after I changed the temperature and cooking time and now I make them all the time; they're delicious, soft and chewy.  But it sure took a lot of trial and error to get these stupid brownies to come out right.  Has anyone else had this problem?  (So I know for next time) was the altitude the problem?

By far better than the box brownies! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 1/2 white sugar, and I used a 13 X 9 pan for 35 minutes and they came out perfect! Very easy to cut and nice and fudgy in the middle.

These are SO good!  My husband fell in love with them (maybe partly because I rarely make homemade baked goods).  We could probably finish off a pan in one night if we let ourselves, haha!

I tried this recipe about 3 times now, and each time it comes out the same.  Personally I find these brownies to be salty and too dry.  My husband doesn't mind them though, but I am going to keep looking for a better recipe.

The large amount of sugar in this recipe gave the brownies a crunchy top layer that I didn't care for. It was also a bit cakier than I'm used to in a brownie. Not the worst, but not the best.

Delicious flavor. I was prepared to see them done when being taken out of the oven. They will be under-cooked slightly. I put the pan back in the oven for ten more minutes. When cooled, it was a little too hard. Please adhere to the cooking instructions. Next time, I will and they will be perfect.

If I could give these brownies six stars I would. THIS is the honemade resipe I was looking for. These brownies are AWESOME! I knew before even eating them just seeing the batter that this was THE brownie resipe! I was right...I could barely wrestle the bowl and whisk away from my kids to put the brownies in the oven once we got them mixed up...they couldn't stop eating it....THEY ARE THE BOMB!

These are the best brownies I have ever made. I substituted half the white sugar for brown sugar and the result was a decadent chewy brownie. I made them 3 times this week for various occasions and they were gone in minutes. My search is over for the perfect brownie!

I have to say I was a bit skeptical when I saw 1 cup of cocoa powder, but after reading great reviews I decided to try it and I'm glad I did! Very moist, very rich. My husband thought they were a little too sweet, but I did not. They were perfect!

WOW!!! These brownies ARE the bomb!!!!  The ONLY change I made (if you can evan call it a "change") is I used DARK cocoa powder instead of regular.  Holy Cow!!! SOO good!!! Rivals the brownies at Boston Market!!  I just made them again and added half semisweet chips and half white chips because that's what I had on hand, but I have no doubt they will be just as fabulous!  Thanks for sharing!!

Great recipe---family loves it and asks for it on a weekly basis (most batches only last two days in our household).  The recipe itself is awsome, but when baked in one of those specially formulated brownie pans (the kind that creates pan edge crispiness on all sides) puts this over the top.  Thank you!

Delicious! I didn't change any of the recipe. They are very sweet and fudgey, but hey, that is what brownies are supposed to be like!

These brownies were just ok. I took them to work and people ate them, but I didn't find them to have as much flavor as I would have liked.

Not sure what happened, but these did not turn out very good.  Very dense and flavor was off.  My favorite brownies are still the ones on the back of the Tollhouse cocoa powder box.  Sorry.

These tasted just as good if not better than boxed mixes.  I cooked a bit longer than stated, prob. about 50 min at 350 in a glass pan.  (I would prob. stick to 45 min next time) Used 1/2 tsp salt as my butter was salted.  FANTASTIC BROWNIES!!!  Just the way I like them.  Yes, they are sweet, that's what brownies are supposed to be.

I am going to eat the entire pan before my husband arrives in a half hour.  YUM!!!!  It's been a long week and I was craving brownies and thankfully had the ingredients to make this recipe, which I've been wanting to try.  It's just the two of us so I halved the recipe (that's called discipline-I was tempted not to) and baked them in a glass 8x8 for 25 minutes.  They turned out perfect!!  I did not have chocolate chips so I used 3/4 of a bittersweet Ghirardelli bar that I chopped into small pieces about the size of a chocolate chip.  The only other change I made was to use 1 1/4c. sugar instead of 1 1/2c. just to decrease it a tad.  Definitely will be making this again and again.  Delicious, quick and easy with ingredients I typically have on hand.  My husband is going to love me when he walks in the door because I don't make sweets that often.

These brownies were out of this world!!! Like others I used half brown sugar and half white. I also used milk chocolate chips - they turned out soooo yummy! Perfect for those chocolate cravings. I will definately be making these again - thanks so much Brooke!                 Carolyn M.

I have made these brownies for what seems like forever now, and they are wonderful.  I have experimented with the batter because there was always a hard crust on top, and the brownie on the inside had fallen.  I also wasn't quite pleased with the texture.  So, I added 1 t. baking powder, which makes the brownies chewier.  I also added about 1/4 c. hershey's syrup to the batter at the end.  This seems to keep the crust from forming, and makes the texture even more chewy.  I love them with these adjustments, and would rate the recipe 5 stars that way.  My kids would eat the entire pan in one sitting, if I'd let them!!

I found these brownies too sweet for my liking. The texture is great once completely cooled though. When they were still warm they seemed undercooked and gooey, but cooled they were fudgy and chewy, and not at all cake-like. Definitely very chocolatey!

These were awesome!  The only thing I changed was the chips.  I used up the rest of bags that I had.  Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and mini M&M's.  Used all white sugar, and didn't find it too sweet at all.  Rich, oh totally!  Just right though.  Would be great for Brownie sundae's, with Caramel sauce, banana's and whipped cream.  Mmmmmmmm.  I'll save that for my visitors over the March Break!

I would agree with a lot of other people who said the brownies were too sweet. They had a good taste, but there needs to be less sugar. Also it was almost impossible the next day to cut the brownies. They became hard as a rock, especially around the edges.

DO NOT ALTER THIS RECIPE! i tried it the first time, following the recipe perfectly. the brownies were fantastic, but i thought "oh, they are a little thinner than i normally like brownies. i will try to make them thicker next time." JUST DON'T DO IT! i cooked the brownies in a 9x9 pan at 300F for an hour & 25 min. they came out ok, but something about making them thicker made them less desirable. just stick to the original recipe, and you will not be sorry. also, do not listen to anyone saying you should add marshmallows or anything else.... this batter is very sweet, and marshmallows do NOT enhance this at all!

Definitely very chocolatey, but a bit of a powdery cocoa taste.  Next time I'll use a bit less cocoa powder (but I'll definitely make them again!).

Awesomest, richest, fudgiest brownies EVER!  Took the advice of other reviewers and used half white & half brown sugar.  I only had milk chocolate chips and it still turned out great!  Will try again with semi-sweet chocolate chips as I'm sure that would create even better chocolatey goodness!  Sent a dozen brownies w/ the Hubster to work and everyone loved them.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

All I can say is OMG, these were the best brownies I have ever tasted! I usually make the zuchinni brownies from this site and thought they were amazing, but these are fantastic! They don't even need icing which is what makes the zuchinni brownies so delicious. I made it exactly as called for except I only used about 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet and they were perfect. They are fudgy and soft and oh soo good! This is my brownies recipe from now on!

Perfect just as they are for dark chocolate lovers!!!  These are best when consumed within 24 hours to keep them soft and fresh.  They become more fudge-like after that, which is a good thing too!  When I make these for kids, I use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and I use 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar to make them a little sweeter.  Heaven!!

This recipe was pretty good, I decided to indulge myself since I´m single this valentine´s... I have been looking for my ¨keeper¨ brownie recipe, but this is not it. I followed recipe exactly, and it was a bit too sweet for my taste. It cooked about 10 mins longer and consistency was nice and fudgy. I have to say boxed brownies still taste better, granted these are not as oily.

Awesome!! I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 9x9 pan for 23 minutes at 350 and were sooooo good. I think next time I will use a 8x8 pan though these were a little thinner then I would like.

Absolutely loved these brownies.  Made with 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I baked these in a 12x8 Slice Solutions brownie pan that has the metal dividers/slicers.  I did bake them a bit longer probably 45 minutes - I just kept checking with a toothpick after 30 minutes; however, because of the metal dividers - I got a evenly cooked pan of brownies with no uncooked centers!  I agree with a previous reviewer who said that if you wait 'till the toothpick comes out completely clean then the brownies would be overcooked.  So many variations with this recipe - it is now my go-to brownie recipe.

very chewy and chocolaty. i use a little less than 1/2 tsp of salt and i used 2 cups of raw sugar and one cup of white sugar which seems to make them even chewier. they are sweet. we also substituted 200 grams of nice 78% chocolate in place of the chocolate chips. the bigger the chunks the tastier. i especially like them the next day when they firm up even more and the chocolate chunks nice and solid again. oh yeah, we used dutch processe cocoa as well.

Followed the recipe exactly and came out perfect. Even the batter tastes better than box batter!

This brownie recipe is absolutely the BEST!  The chocolate chips thrown into the batter make this awesome.  No need to tweak this recipe at all.  Make it as is and you'll be so happy you did!

I literally threw away 2 other brownie recipes that I loved because this recipe was a HUGE hit with my husband and folks at church.  Wonderfully rich, deep chocolate flavor.  Note: I reduced the vanilla to only use 1 teaspoon because I use a high quality vanilla extract (Penzey's) and I wanted maximum chocolate flavor.  The only negative thing about this recipe is that the outer edge was so hard to cut through, that I had my husband cut the brownies.  Other reviewers had mentioned this, and I'm not sure what the answer is to avoid this.  Trust me though, the brownies are well worth cutting away the small amount on the edge!  One other tip - I removed the brownies from the oven when a tooth pick inserted into the center was still slightly wet.  I usually do this with brownies as they will continue to cook a bit while cooling.  I'm going to try this recipe again using 1/2 of the semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 peanut butter chips.  Great recipe and one of the few I took the time to review.  Thanks Brooke for a great new staple recipe for my collection!

Wow; these are seriously rich!  I could see that they might be just a little sweet for some people's taste, but we love them. They require a full glass of milk for each one, that's for sure.  I did find that they need to cook much longer than called for. We baked for 40+ minutes, and they were still quite underdone in the middle (but no one minded eating them with a spoon).

Super good.  I had 5 kids over for a playdate and they loved them. Plenty of extras left over for our family.  Rich, Dense, Chocolate Heaven.  I will not make box brownies again. I would rather make this great recipe a few times a year than buy cheap box brownies. WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN. Put my oven for 45-50 mins at 350.

These were very good, the first time I made them with part brown sugar and that was a mistake. They had a weird taste that didn't blend well with the overall taste of the brownie and made it gummy instead of fudge-y. I made them again with all white sugar and they were much better.

Delish!!! I made these just as the directions say. They are chewy and chocolaty, a perfect brownie. They aren't gooey though which is good. To add something special I melted a 1/2 C peanut butter, and marbled it into the top of the brownie batter when it was in the pan. Then just bake as normal.

These brownies are GREAT! The first time I made them, I made them exactly as the recipe asked; they were great, but all butter makes them a little hard if you don't eat them while hot. Today, I made them again and used half butter and half oil. While they are still dense and rich, they keep better when they are cooled. I also heard that using half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate is a great variation. Thanks Brooke, this is great!

Read tons of reviews and finally decided to just follow the recipe. First thing, it took really long to bake. Looked finished at 35 minutes but did not pass the toothpick test, took another 10 minutes and I decided to just take the pan out. I had taste tested the batter before it went in and it tasted okay. First brownie out of the pan was warm and gooey - but REALLY sweet. Now, it's the morning after and I can't cut through the edges but the rest seems under cooked and all I taste is sugar. Maybe brownies are the one thing I won't make from scratch. Ugh.

I made these exactly as written with no substitutions.  They were quite good, but just not quite what I was looking for (I like a slightly more cakey brownie).  They were a little too overdone on the sides but fudgy more towards the center, eventhough I baked them for less than the recipe called for (30 minutes).  Very intense chocolate flavor and very sweet.

If I could give 10 stars, I would give them all to these brownies! These are the best brownies I've ever eaten. They are fudgy, moist, dense and wonderful.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar as many others suggested.  I also used a 9x13 pan and they still came out very thick.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I've been using this amazing recipe for a while and love it! I agree with others comments on 1.5 cups of white sugar and 1.5 cups of brown sugar. 

To add an extra punch, I mixed the following and added on top before baking : 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, 1 egg, 1 tsp. vanilla & 1/3 cup white sugar. Swirl with a knife for before baking.

Very rich and fudgey! Delicious...used 1 1/2 of white and 1 1/2 of brown sugar. Do not decrease the sugar in this recipe....yes, its a lot of butter and sugar....but thats why these are soooo good. If your looking for low calorie or think the amount of sugar in this recipe is "obscene" as another reviewer had put it....look for another recipe! This recipe is excellent as is. Thanks!

These are baking in my oven as I type this. I don't need to taste them to know I WON'T be making these again. I make brownies from scratch all the time, from a variety of different recipes. I know what I'm doing. This recipe is a disaster. The directions need to be changed to instruct people to shift together the dry ingredients first and set aside. Otherwise, the butter cools while preparing this, and batter becomes impossible to mix. Mine was a brick. The butter amount for a 9x13 pan is correct, but the sugar and cocoa is too much, and the flour not enough. Sorry, but this is a bad recipe. ETA: Now that my brownies are cooked, I can give my statement on taste. These are chocolaty and chewy, but taste EXACTLY like a store-bought mix I had as a kid.

This recipe is amazing. I am known for my brownies, and had been looking for a new recipe to try. These are fantastic. I took the suggestion of another reviewer, and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda to give them some lift and the thin shell on top. They are absolutely delicious!

I made these as part of a "Dinner Package" I gave away for a fundraiser raffle at our church.  Unfortuanlly I hadn't even tasted them before hand...but, with all the great reviews, I hoped they would be good.  Well, the winners (who I really didn't know) took the time to track me down and just raved and raved about how they where the best brownies they ever ate!  No changes where made to this recipe...followed to the T.  Will be making again soon, because now I want to try them!!

I've been looking for my go-to brownie recipe, and this is it!  Very rich, very chocolatey.  They have perfect brownie texture, with flaky crust on the top, and fudgy interior.  They're super easy to make, and I almost always have the ingredients on hand.  I've made these a couple of times for brownies a la mode, and my family just raves about them.  Yum!

Very good recipe! If you want a 3 star but healthier brownie, cut out 1/3 of the sugar. If you want the best brownie you've ever had, use half brown sugar and half white sugar, and include all three cups! YUM.

I was very skeptical about this recipe. I'm the baking powder/soda person. I didn't know about the full cup of cocoa powder either, I've always used a teaspoon but this recipe turned out perfect! I used a 9 x 13 pan and the edges got a little darker than I wanted but that could have just been my pan. I love this recipe. Thanks Brooke!

I didn't have quite enough cocoa so added more chips.  Did it ALL with my hand mixer, usually a NO-NO for brownies...even while adding chips.  These are THE BEST brownies.  You were right Ashley.  One slight mis-step in recipe.  Says "Gradually stir the flour mixture into the chocolate mixture until blended. Stir in the chocolate morsels. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared baking dish."  Should read stir chocolate mixture into sugar mixture.

These brownies were very good.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  Good recipe!

WOW,WOW,WOW!!! These are some of the best brownies I've ever had.  Certainly the fudgiest brownie I've had, which I prefer.  This is very rich-tasting, so a smaller piece of brownie satisfies, but I could certainly eat more.  I will make these again!  I subbed brown sugar for half of the sugar in the recipe.

Wow- this uses a TON of sugar, but the outcome is worth the cheat. Super chocolately and rich- I'll definitely be using this recipe again. These were devoured!

**EXCELLENT**  I no longer have to look anywhere else and no more boxed.  I read reviews before preparing this recipe and decided to go ahead and use 1.5 cups sugar and 1.5 cups brown sugar.  I baked mine for about 38 min and thought they were overdone but they were perfect.  These are very dense and rich.  I took them to a family dinner and everybody had seconds paired w/ vanilla ice cream.  I think they're better the next day.   Happy Baking!

I have made numerous brownie recipes - some which were excellent. But this recipe is by far the EASIEST and the TASTIEST I've ever made.  I follow the recipe exactly.  The reactions I get from these is unbelievable - people absolutely obsess over them.  The BEST brownies!!!  Wish I could give it more stars!

I did not like these brownies at all. I am at a high altitude and I did use splenda instead of sugar so that may have contributed to my lack of success. They were cake-like and overly stiff, not fudgy or chewy at all; the taste was also not chocolatey enough. The other problem I had was that they cooked QUICK. I baked at 350 and after 15 minutes they looked done. I waited 5 more minutes since the recipe said much longer, and when I tested with a toothpick it came out clean, almost TOO clean for brownies. I made them for a party, but took something else instead. I do not recommend.

Wonderful. I subbed in brown sugar for half of the white sugar, but otherwise made as written. I would definitely make these again. Very chocolatey and fabulous.

Ehhhh....they're OK. Kind of a weird tangy after taste (too much cocoa powder maybe?). Watch the cooking time, the edges of mine were really hard so I had to cut them off and waste alot of precious chocolate brownie. I think I may still look around for the perfect recipe. I will wait and see how my 10 year old sons baseball team likes them first. :-) (GO BEAVERTON HONORS!!) *UPDATE* Another parent brought homemade brownies, so I had to try them....and they were better than mine. I guess I am going to have to get her recipe.

Delicious recipe! Some of the best brownies I've ever had and made - I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips too like grammajean below. The brownies were a hit! I didn't have to make a single modification to this recipe either!

The best brownie recipe out there!  Dense, fudgy, sweet.  Everything a brownie should be.  If you like your brownies cakey look else where.  ***Made this recipe a second time...I halfed the recipe...works great in an 8x8 pan.

I just made these brownies as a Mother's Day treat for my mom...  They were absolutely fantastic!  As per other recipes I lessened the sugar to one cup granulated and one cup brown sugar.  I also added some peanut butter chips in with the chocolate chips.  When everything was mixed together I was a bit weary because the batter was really thick, but after 35 minutes of baking the brownies came out looking and smelling wonderful.  I let them sit for about an hour, long enough to cool down some but leaving them warm enough so that the choc chips were still gooey.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

OMG, TO DIE FOR! :)  I cut the recipe in half, cooked the brownies in a glass 8x8 pan (perfect size for 1/2 recipe) and used half butter/half applesauce to cut back on the calories a little.  Glad I didn't make the whole recipe because I know we would have eaten them all in 2 days!  A go to recipe for sure!

I am rating these on the responses I got. These were very easy to make, I mixed everything by hand to avoid over beating, they came out perfectly. I think I overbaked them a tad, so next time I'll pull them out after 35 minutes without waiting for a clean toothpick. I would recommend these brownies they were a big hit.

I wanted to rate this higher, I really did. Brownies are my biggest weakness when it comes to sweets. These...just too darn sweet. The chocolate flavor is there, of course because they are brownies. But the sweetness just makes them too much. They are nice and fudgy, the way I prefer brownies to be. I won't make again... I'd rather eat a box mix. **All that aside, they baked nicely in about 32 minutes. I had chopped the chocolate chips a bit, and they melted and had a nice consistency within the brownie. I lined the pan with parchment to easily remove from the pan.

Very good recipe. As suggested by other users, I reduced the amount of sugar to 2 cups and used half white/brown sugar. I also added about 1/4 cup extra cocoa powder and about 3 tablespoons of coffee to give the brownies a really rich and deep chocolate flavor. They turned out great!

I was wanting to try a new brownie recipe and I must say that this one is really good.  I followed another person's review and used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and also used milk chocolate chips since that is all I had.  I baked in my 9x13 pan and set the timer for 30 minutes and they came out just perfect.  I could not wait for them to cool so I cut just the corner which is the part of the brownie I normally don't like and it was just as chewy and fudgy.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone and this is the one I will be using for now on.  Thanks Brooke.

I originally rated this 3 stars but that was because I had followed some suggestions in the reviews. I tried this recipe again and made it exactly as the recipe says and oh my goodness, these are great!!! They have been called "the best brownies ever" by many people. I usually add 1c of pecans and 1tbsp of vanilla, and everything else do exactly the same, so delicious, chewy, moist!

I love these brownies. I did not add the chocolate chips (friend doesn't like chunks in them) and they were still great.  Very fudgey.

Best I've ever had.  I use an ice cream scoop to place batter into muffin tins sprayed with no-stick spray.  No cutting is cool!

Have been meaning to review this one for some time now.  I adore this recipe.  Have made it as is, with exception of melting the chocolate chips instead of leaving them whole as I don't like the chunks of chocolate chips.  I now only make this with a blend of natural and dutched cocoa for a darker chocolate flavor, but the recipe is amazing even exactly as written out.

These are definitely the absolute best brownies that I have ever made.  I did add some spices to them to give them a chai latte taste, but as far as the base taste and texture, these are #1.

I have never made brownies from scratch but I wanted brownies and didn;t have any mix.  I had everything required for these brownies and figured I would give it a shot.  I WILL NEVER BUY BOXED BROWNIE MIX AGAIN!!!  These brownies were so good and easy.  I added a cream cheese mix (cream cheese, sugar, egg) to the top and topped the whole think with chopped almonds.  INSANE- These brownies are soooo good.

I cooked these for about 45 minutes, until they were a little gooey in the center.  They turned out perfectly!  Everyone at the party we attended wanted to know the recipe.

Awesome brownies, I was so worried when I made them because I did not have chocolate chips.  As I was making the recipe I realized that I didn't have enough white sugar or coco powder.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar to make up my sugar difference and I was short between 1/4 - 1/8 cup on the coco powder.  I was very nervous about how they would turn out but they were amazing.  I can't wait to make them again, with all the ingredients.

Very fudgy brownie...just the way we like it. Some complain that it is too sweet...not for my family ;) My 4-year old took a bite, turned to his brother and said, "This is the best brownie I've ever had in my whole life!" I made no changes other than to sub m&ms for the chocolate chips. Will definitely make again and again.

This is the best brownie recipes I've ever made.  I forgot to rate it after I made it last time, and I didn't know which one it was.  I just search allrecipes for the last half hour just to find it.  They are fantastic!

Five stars for ease and taste.  Everyone loved them.. Will make again.  I did not change anything, the only thing I would think of doing different is to sub half brown sugar and add some nuts..but fine as is..

I am updating my review because i have made these in alot of ways.. and its impossible to mess them up. I have used 1 1/4 cup brown and white sugar with chocolate chips. 1 cup each brown and white sugar with chocolate chips. and last night i made them with 2 1/2 cups white sugar WITHOUT chocolate chips, these were my favorite! i didnt have brown sugar, but i loved them! very fudgy but not that fudgy that you think they are raw! i topped them with fluffy peanut butter frosting from this site.. yummy! i loved them! whatever you decide to do, just dont use the full amount of sugar.. it is not necessary, i promise!

Wonderful chewy consistency.  Even without the chocolate chips, this recipe is excellent.  Here's a tip.  Use parchment paper on the bottom of your pan, and the fudgy brownies will not stick.  How cool is that?

These brownies are the bomb! They were so fudgy and rich. This is the best brownie recipe I have found so far and I am the brownie queen. I would highly recommend this recipe if you like rich fudgy brownies.

These are really, truly excellent. (And I thought I was the only one to figure out the secret is to add semi-sweet chocolate chips!) Margarine works fine, they are very tasty! (I can't digest butter, so I made them this way even despite the warnings of other reviewers.) I also had absolutely no problems with them sticking to the pan, just make sure you use a decent non-stick spray. I used to buy box brownies and add extra cocoa powder and chocolate chips, but this is cheaper and easier to cut!

These turned out great the firdst time I made them. I also decreased the sugar a bit and used 1c white sugar and 13/4c brown sugar. First time I used the proper size pan, second time I thought I would try mini muffin tin. Brownines stuck to the muffin tins and were over done. I think I will stick to the 9 X 13 pan as they turned out great that way. Thanks for the recipe.

There's no doubt,this IS a classic brownie recipe and a good one at that.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar and we all found this sweet enough.  I also added 1 teaspoon of baking powder to the flour to give it a little more "lightness".  BIG HINT! These things stick to the pan like glue.  LINE

Make this recipe exactly as it is written and you will have a moist, rich, chocolately brownie that looks like the one in the picture.  Brooke, thanks so much for sharing this recipe.   It will be my only brownie recipe from now on.

NOT fudgy or chewy.  In fact, a little dry and crumby, and I did not overbake them.  Too bad.

fanatastic, great great great chocolate flavor.  So much better than a box.  I baked mine in a glass pan so it took 40 minutes to bake.  I certainly had the perfect chewy, nicely risen brownie!

With all of the great reviews I was expecting to love these brownies, but I didn't. They have great flavor but there is way too much sugar. We couldn't finish the pan because they were too sweet.

I followed this recipe exactly except I only had 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, so I just used that. I'm eating one now, actually. They're thick and chewey (not at all cakey). Taste great, but are not the absolute best I've ever tasted. I didn't have any brownie mix on hand and my kids wanted some brownies, and this did the trick.

To everyone who reviews them as "too rich" and "too fudgy" : the recipe is described as rich and chocolatey. What did you expect? I loved these brownies because they actually lived up to the recipe description. If you don't want fudgy, rich brownies, don't make a recipe that describes them as such, lol. 

I work as a waitress, and my manager wants the recipe to bake and serve, they're so delicious. 

I used half M&M's and half chocolate chips because I ran out of chocolate chips, and the result was a perfect chocolate treat.

I'm addicted -the best homemade brownies I've ever tried.  Perfect consistency!  I followed the recipe exactly (only I had to bake a little longer) and I didn't think they were TOO sweet.  After all, aren't brownies supposed to be sweet?  Maybe I won't eat as many that way :) .... nope, still eating them.  UPDATE: I made this dough and the "Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie" dough and dropped spoonfuls of each randomly in a 9X13 pyrex dish... mmm...mmmmm! UPDATE: I tried Splenda instead of sugar & yuck!  Follow the recipe & you won't be disappointed.

My husband is having a bad day, so I thought I'd surprize him with his favorite treat. 

These were incredibly easy to put together. I didn't sift the ingredients 
together, I used a wisk like another tester suggested. I threw in some mint
chips that I was waiting to use just 
for brownies. I also took it out a couple minutes early to leave it a little moister. Other than that, I didn't change anything.

Really fabulous recipe. I've replaced my
stand-by for making brownies. This is 
now what I'll go to.

These were so good...all moist and fudgy and delicious! The only changes I made were that I halved the recipe and used half whole wheat flour. They turned out great! No more box mixes here!

these rocked--added about 1/2 less sugar (didn't want to open a new bag), and about 2 tbsp. extra cocoa (didn't want to put that small amount back on the shelf), and they were easily the darkest, richest brownies i've ever made.

I do a fair amount of baking and I'm pretty choosy about the recipes I keep.  Until now I was using the brownie recipe from the back of the box of unsweetened baking chocolate. They were good, but missing something.

I made these last week and had to hide them from the kids or they would have eaten the entire batch in one night!

This is the best recipe I have found so far. I followed the advice of a few reviewers and used half brown and half white sugar. I also used slightly less white sugar than the recipe called for (1/4 cup less). I usually decrease the sugar in my recipes as I find most of them too sweet.  I also added a few dashes of cinnamon to the batter and topped half of the pan with walnuts before baking. They are melt in your mouth yummy. I don't like hard pieces of chocolate chips in my brownies, but I didn't melt them and it came out fine, not with hard chunks of chocolate chips like some reviews said.

I just made another batch tonight and the wonderful aroma is filling the house and making the dogs go crazy. This is a keeper.

Absolutely outrageous.  So thick, chewy, and moist that you almost choke on them!  I did add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the egg and sugar mixture...I like the intensity it gives the chocolate.

Awesome brownies, I used Hersheys Special Dark cocoa and cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  I also added walnuts.......have to have them in brownies.  These are very dense and rich.....loved them.

These are delicious! Just what I want in a brownie, flaky on top, dense and fudgy in the middle. I added pecans and they were Heavenly! Thank you thank you thank you!

Allow me to add another 5-star rating. These brownies are easy to make and use ingredients that anyone who likes to bake would have on hand, and they are absolutely deicious. Fudgy, chewy, crispy top, chocolatey - the perfect brownie. The only bad thing about them is I can't stop eating them.

Good brownies with a nice texture.  A very good in-between recipe to satisfy the majority.  But they aren't quite intense enough for mine and my hubby's taste.  I used bittersweet chips, but it was still a bit sweet.  Thanks for the quick and very easy recipe, but I think I'll stick to my favorite recipe with the melted bittersweet chocolate as the base.

FAB-U-LOUS!  These are moist and fudgy, just like I like my brownies.  They are a snap to make, and since the recipe calls for cocoa powder rather than baking chocolate squares, I almost always have all the ingredients on hand.  I will definitely be making these again.  The only thing I would change is maayyyybe decrease the sugar.  I love them just like they are, but the chocolate flavor is just a tad overpowered by the sweetness.  I did do as others suggested and used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups white sugar.  Next time I will try 1 1/4 cups of each.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This is the BEST brownie recipe I've ever made, I'll never make any other recipe or buy a mix, this recipe won me over. Yes they're a little sweet and may hurt my teeth, but it's a good pain. My hubby says he can eat them every day and my daughter loves them too, if I could I would give them 10 stars. Thankyou for the great recipe.

My 11 year old daughter just made these (I'm feeling a bit under the weather) and they are THE BEST BROWNIES we've had in ages! A little sliver, fresh out of the oven, with cooold milk. Mmmmm... so good.

Her mods: She used 1 stick of butter and 1 stick of Earth Balance stick shortening because that's all we had. She also used 2 c. natural sugar and 1 c. sucanat. Finally, we had no chocolate chips, so my dear daughter happily took a hammer to bagged unsweetened Baker's chocolate (4 squares, I think). The result, honestly, is better than any brownie I've attempted in the last few years.

Thanks for a Bombshell of a recipe. We'll be keeping this one!

OMG!!! I've never made brownies that weren't in a box before now, and I don't think that I'll be capable of making them from a box ever again. These were amazing! I did use the suggestion of others and used half sugar/brown sugar. (I used light brown) These are amazing and so easy!

Very tasty! But next time I won't add so much cocoa. I thought they were too cocoa-y, so maybe 1/2-3/4 cup. That's probably just my personal preference.

Every time I think I have found the "one" best brownie recipe, I come across another great recipe.  I have to say, if I could rate this one higher than five stars, I would!!  If you are a fan of dense, fudgy, dark chocolate brownies, these are for you.  We had our Thanksgiving just this past Saturday and this was one of the desserts; everyone went truly crazy over these.  I used a premium, high-quality cocoa powder (from our local spice house), Ghiradelli bittersweet chips, and evenly split the sugar between white and brown...but otherwise made these just as written...THE BEST BROWNIES I HAVE EVER TASTED!!!  Thanks, Brooke, for sharing this; these brownies were a huge hit!

These are known as "Death By Brownies" in our house!  Rich, sweet and super chocolatey, they are everything a brownie should be.  They are wonderful warm from the oven, and they stay moist overnight -- if there are any left!

As other's suggested I only used 2 cups of sugar (1 white and 1 brown). They were plenty sweet enough. I also used white chips, very good!

Not only are these yummy, chocolatey brownies easy to make, but the texture is amazing - moist, fudgey and chewy, yet firm (not too messy). I followed the recipe exactly (except for using non-stick cooking spray instead of grease) and these are possibly the best brownies I've ever made or had. They are great with a glass of milk or served warm with ice cream.

To be fair, I altered the original recipe slightly per other reviewers and used half white sugar and half brown sugar and slightly reduced the amounts.  The results were bland, dry brownies - boxed brownies would have been faster and tastier.  Not sure if it was due to the alterations but I won't be making this one again.

What a wonderful brownie. I do not like the cake like brownies and have  had a hard time finding a made from scratch recipe for chewy brownies----we loved these. Prepared exactly as written except for sifting the flour, these are truly the best

I loved these!  I used about 1/4 cup brown sugar in place of 1/4 cup white sugar.  Also used milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet.  Also, as a warning, DO NOT make these if you are trying to watch what you eat.  They are very addictive!

UPDATE: Omit the chocolate chips.  Use 1 C Brown Sugar and 2 C sugar. This makes a great brownie this way.  When I made these according to the recipes, I left this review:  I've had better.  They tasted a little too much like dark chocolate.  I won't be making these again.

These brownies are indeed delicious. Following others suggestioons i also added half white and half brown sugar, and i didnt add quite as much as recommmeneded as i didnt want them to be too sweet. i also added some chopped peacans and sprinkled some of the chocolate chips on top of the brownies before baking. They are absolutely delicious! my boyfriend has proclaimed them the best brownies he has ever had and wont stop singing their praises. also his flatmate went out last night and got back late, when we got up this morning he had left a not on top of the brownies reading "oh my god!" . yes they really are going down a storm! definitely try these brownies, they are so easy and absolutely yummy!

Excellent despite using 2 cups of white and 1/2 cup brown sugar and omitting the salt and using white choc chips. We find that you really don't need to add salt to most recipes...we get enough of it unknowingly anyway.

I feel like I've died and gone to chocolate heaven!! Brooke - awesome recipe.  I ran out of white sugar and had to substitute a cup of it with brown sugar.  I was also about 1/4 c. short on the cocoa powder - and they are still DELICIOUS!  This one's a keeper for sure!

WOW!!  Best chewy brownies I’ve made yet!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great!!  Wouldn’t change a thing. They’re fudgy but not too fudgy. And the top is crispy but a perfect compliment to the chewiness! Definitely keeping this recipe to make these over and over and over again!

Made this in US, Mexico, Spain and Brazil, it's loved by everyone.  As most of these countries use grams I don't put in a cup of unsalted butter (225g) but rather 200g (which is a bar of butter here). I rarely add the chocolate chips, and for a 9x13 I make 1.5 recipe, the regular recipe I cook in a 9 x 9 pan.

Very easy to make, perfect brownies. I followed directions exactly as written and everyone loved the results. I have since also made them by replacing the butter with oil and i couldn't tell the difference.   Didn't have to even touch my stand mixer. Thought about doubling the recipe so my brownies wouldn't end up being so short/flat. I'm glad i didn't. It would have overflowed over the brownie pan. And it was totally unnecessary because they rose to a good height.  Considering making them again today for our family barbeque since i already know this recipe is fool proof.  Thank you so much for sharing. My search for a favorite brownie recipe is finally over! No worrying about too sweet/not sweet enough/not fudgey enough/too cakey/etc.,

These brownies were delicious but extremely rich — think fudge but as a brownie. I was shocked how heavy the pan was, but they were a huge hit at Easter dinner. I did add a little water during the final prep because the mixture was too dry to blend thoroughly (maybe a 1/4 cup). Super simple to make, and my 8-year-old did a lot of the work.

These were the best, fudgiest, brownies I have ever made! I made it exactly as written. They were not too sweet and were the perfect thickness in a 9x13 pan. I’ve tried many brownie recipes, but not any more, this one is the bomb! Get a tall glass of cold milk and enjoy!

Hi. Recovering recipe changer here. It took ALL I HAD IN ME not to change this recipe. I wanted to use a 3:1 ratio of brown sugar to white. I wanted to sub two egg yolks for at least one of the eggs. I wanted to add baking soda. Why? Because I wanted a chewy, dense, NOT cake-like, but fudge-like brownie, with a bit of a glaze-like flaky crust and a smooth sheen on top. AND I’M SO GLAD I DID NOT ALTER THIS RECIPE!! Because without altering it, I got exactly what I wanted. I read many reviews, and many said they added baking soda for the crust. No need. Many subbed some brown sugar for some of the white. No need. Etc., etc. I really wanted to try the recipe as is, so that I could make changes as I see fit. I did toss my frozen semi-sweet chocolate chips (1.5 Cups) in flour before folding them into the batter. I folded half in before spreading them into the pan, and the other half I sprinkled on top and spread them in from there. I baked my brownies in a well-greased, unlined, 9x13” glass baking pan at 350F for 35 minutes. Then I pulled them out turned off my oven, and cooled them for 15 minutes before cutting. I didn’t bother with the toothpick test, because I had used chocolate chips and many reviewers said there would be no point because the toothpick would not come out clean. Upon cutting, I KNEW they weren’t done, so I put them back into my now cooled oven, set it to 350F again, and baked them another 14 minutes (oven reached 350F after brownies had been in for 4 minutes).

Best brownies ever!! I didn’t have any chocolate chips, so I just made the recipe the same excluding them, it was DELICIOUS! Also, many reviews have mentioned the brownies not being thick enough; it is vital beat in each egg individually, as this thickens the batter substantially. Will definitely make these again!!

I found the ultimate brownie recipe! Finally I found a recipe where the brownie gets that crust on top I absolutely love. I always double it and put it in the oven for about 25 minutes.

Delicious! I used 2 1/2c of sugar, then tasted the batter... It was so good that I left it where it was... But with the bitterness of the semi-sweet chips, an extra 1/2 c of sugar would've been just fine for me... My husband just doesn't like super sweet sweets and I'm good either way... So I left it with just 2 1/2c... And hey, It's ok to modify sweetness to your liking but don't rate poorly when you modify a recipe and it doesn't turn out... Because then, it is YOUR recipe. I can imagine 3 cups being too many without using semi-sweet chips... But a recipe is a recipe and ingredients work together. Rating poorly for using Splenda instead or trying to be "helpful" by rating 1 star to tell all the dummies that melted chocolate will stain a toothpick just isn't cool people! And rating poorly after admitting your oven sucks... really?! Lol! Anyway, I loved this recipe... I used an 11x7 dish by mistake and they turned out extra gooey in the middle which is totally ok with me! Love a good gooey brownie! The batter would've been gone if I weren't afraid of the raw eggs...  If you didn't like the RECIPE, blame the cook because these are fabulous!

If you are looking for a "diet" brownie, as if the two words should ever be together, this is not it.  It is also not your choice if you are looking to have a cake-like consistency, like my husband prefers. However, if you like really chocolaty, really moist (almost gooey) brownies, these are SO GOOD.  I have been making brownies for years, but I must say, these might be the best recipe I've used thus far.  One point, though- I used my cocoa powder from Europe since I had some left.  Might not be as rich with another US brand, but they would likely still be very good.  I will definitely recommend this to a friend who trained as a professional pastry chef and loves chocolate!!!

I only wanted to make a small batch so divided the recipe by 4 and baked in a 6" x 6" baking pan for 35 minutes.
Crunchy on the outside, fudgy on the inside.  Yum!!  Was a hit with everyone that tried it, will definitely be making again.

This was fabulous and I made it gluten free using Bob's RedMill 1-1 Gluten Free flour. I did use 1/4 of a cup less of the flour since gluten free flours trend to be drier or more dense than regular flour.

These brownies are the best we've ever had!!  Much better than any box.  The only change I made was instead of all white sugar I did 1 1/2 white sugar & 1 1/2 brown sugar.  I also added Kraft caramel bits, about 1/2 cup...yummy.  My family & friends ask for them all the time!

I made this exact to the recipe the first time and they were delicious, but could have used less sugar. The next time I made them I used half the sugar and they were great. The next time I made them I used coconut flour and a brown/white sugar mix. These were the best !

Used high quality ingredients - ghiradelli cocoa, guittard chocolate chips - and a 9x13 pan. Made the best fudgey brownies I've ever had. I'm not a brownie person, but I couldn't get enough. Also used half white and half brown sugar. And make sure you use real butter. I wonder how many people use margarine or some alternative and then complain that the recipe didn't turn out...

Great basic recipe. I actually cut the ingredients by about 1/4, made these with Paleo flour, used 1/2 cup white sugar and 2 cups brown and substituted the butter for coconut oil.  They came out great.

The BEST recipe!!!! I've searched for a recipe that is chewy with a crinkle top for years! I suggest setting timer for 10-15 minutes less than noted time and check with a toothpick.

Made these exactly as the recipe called for, with 3 full cups of sugar! They turned out as expected - taste-wise they are VERY sugary (couldn't really taste the chocolate at all), texture was perfect and they cooked up nicely after 35 minutes in my oven without being overcooked or overly browned. This is a great recipe for kids who aren't really looking for too much flavor in a brownie.

I think I have tried at least a dozen brownie recipes over the years and none have come out like this.  Hands down the best I've ever made.  And so easy to make.  Very chewy, not cake like which is what my family prefers.  

I actually made this for my mom for her birthday instead of cake.  Served it with vanilla ice-cream and a spoonful cherry pie filling on top.  Everyone was raving about it.

Fantastic brownies. I did half golden brown and half white sugar as others suggested. I was a little unsure about all the sugar but the recipe is perfect. Added slightly rounded tsp of salt. As someone else noted toothpick may not come out clean because of the chocolate chips. Mine were perfect at 40 mins. Let them cool on wire rack for a while before cutting.  I will definitley make again!

I made this and the whole family loves it. I used slightly less sugar - 2 1/2 cups, and added a pinch of nutmeg and dash of cinnamon (I can never resist adding those to anything chocolate I bake)! Those aren't necessary modifications however, just my taste. Great recipe, will make again.

They are OK.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used Hershey's cocoa powder and Ghiradelli semi-sweet chips.  In 35 minutes they were burned around the edges and some on the top, so I turned my oven down to 300 degrees and cooked them for another 5 minutes, because they weren't done in the middle.  Although they were burnt some, they were still soft and chewy.

I have made this twice. first by the recipe and the second time I cut the sugar to 2 cups.  Loved both but think I will continue using the one with less sugar. My hubby wants me to try it with brown sugar next.  I'll let you know.

I'm not big on chocolate. I don't like brownies. I don't like very sweet things. I certainly don't like fudge. So why can't I stop eating these?!!?  I don't like refrigerated baked goods either, but put them in the fridge and they only get better. I have a great cakey buttermilk which I may never make again. Please slap my hand the next time I reach for one of these. ....ouch!

First Brownie recipe I have used from this site, and I see no need to change it. I make baked goods with the children I watch in mind, and know that anything super sweet will be a hit, but their parents like the recipe too. I also love how it's not aimed for an 8x8 pan, as I don't even own one that size. Anyway, YUM!

I've made them twice, and they've been the best brownies I've ever made. The first time, I forgot to add the chocolate chips until I had already dumped the batter in the pan, so I just put them on top and mashed them in a little. The second time I mixed them in. The family didn't notice any difference, but I may prefer the first way - really gooey on top. Anyway, if you like fudgy and gooey, I recommend this recipe.

Excellent recipe and quite easy. It is rich, chocolatey and decadent. I just should have waited to cut it! My picture does not do it justice, because I cut it right away. The end result was still fabulous. This will now be my permanent brownie recipe. Next time I will serve with vanilla bean ice cream on top. Delicious!!

Full disclosure...I didn't make these but I did eat them and they are amazing. I'm not a huge brownie fan...but I loved these. Don't panic if they are super moist when you pull them from the oven...the brownies I ate were from a baking pro which gave me confidence they they were cooked through. Sonja, the baker, added mini marshmallows to the top which added to the taste, visual and texture appeal. I am always looking for a great recipe for brownie sundaes....and I'm pretty sure my search is over.

My daughter has made this so many times she's memorized the recipe. Many of her friends keep asking for it. This is probably the best brownie recipe I've ever made, no changes necessary AT ALL.

Love these...favored for chewy brownies. These are the brownies we always go back to. Leave out chocolate chips and add in frozen berries.

I didn't feel comfortable using so much sugar so  instead of using  3 cups of white sugar, I used 1 cup of dark brown sugar and it still tastes amazingly delicious. As i sayy, since there is less sugar I can have more brownies

These were definitely fudgy!  I baked them for almost 15 minutes longer, and I still wish I had more time to bake them a little longer.  However, they were delicious!  Best enjoyed with a scoop or two of ice cream to offset some of the fudginess.  If you want a fudgy brownie, I don't think it can get any fudgier than these, unless you grab a spoon and eat the batter! :)

I usually prefer store bought brownies to home-made ones, but these were delicious!!! They were thick and soft and remained soft even a few days after (usually brownies become hard overtime). I added a bunch of chocolate chips into the mix which made them scrumptious ^_^ The only thing is the salt this recipe calls for is a little too much, so I could taste the salt in the brownies which gave it kind of an awkward taste. Other than that, the sweetness, texture, and flavor were great! Next time, I'm going to try 1/4 tsp of salt.

Amazing amazing amazing! These brownies are easily the best I have ever had. So simple to make! Serve these to friends and they will beg for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as written... no estimations, no substitutions, nothing. They turned out perfect. This makes the right amount of batter for a 9x13 pan. The only downfall was my own mistake of mistaking melted chocolate chips for undercooked batter when doing the toothpick test, so I overbaked them for about 2 minutes which resulted in slightly crispier corners and outer edge pieces, but that is ok since my wife likes them anyway.
Obviously tastes vary, but we don't find these too sweet. They turn out perfectly rich and fudgy in the middle.

I believe recipes are just a guide to cooking and alternations are made to fit your own personal taste...that being said...this is an easy delicious recipe. I did make only one change and used only 21/2 cup of sugar. It was served with homemade strawberry ice cream! The sleepover crowd loved it!!

The best ANYTHING I've ever made. 
Two cups of white sugar did more than enough for the sweetness.
Chopped bits of dark chocolate instead of the chocolate chips, and it was fudgier than ever. Heating it up before serving does wonders.

This is the recipe that I have been searching for! My brownies came out awesomely rich and chocolately. I used half white and half light brown sugar. I added pecans and used half of a baking square bar since I didn't have chocolate chips. I baked them in a 10x10 pan and they came out great. I had some frozen strawberries that I thawed and sweetened with sugar. I also whipped up some cream. However they were great alone. If you want a decadent, fudge brownie this is for you.

Have tried several brownie recipes from this website, but I always come back to this one. I've made a few modifications-using 2 cups of sugar instead of 3.  3 cups is way too much. For people who find the finished product too gooey with a "raw" consistency, try adding one more egg. It will help the brownies set up better but are still chewy, provided you don't overbake them :-)

I made the brownies but left out the chocolate chips.  I gave half to my mom and daughter. I just received a text from my daughter who asked if I made the brownies with the hearts of angels.  Needless to say I am still laughing.

Dadgummit these things are good! Rich, dense, fudgy and sweet which is just how I like them. I followed the original recipe and didn't modify anything and was very happy with the finished product. Seriously, they taste like something you'd expect to get at a high end bakery. If you like your brownies dense and rich then look no further you've hit the jackpot, if not then your search continues. Try them you won't regret it.

These are pretty darn good!!  I asked my daughter what we should make for a dessert, and she said gooey chocolate brownies with chocolate chips in  them (can you tell she likes chocolate?).  These fit the bill completely and made her a happy little girl :)  They are nice and rich.  Some people complained they were too sweet??!!  They are brownies for goodness sake, what do you expect!?  Great recipe!

I am not the rate and review kinda person, but this recipe truly deserves a 5 star and a mention! It is simple to make, chewy, rich, and just delicious!!! I don't have a 9x13 pan so I used a 9x9 pan and 10cupcakes! Inserted a nice walnut each on my cupcakes and I almost eat them all myself! If you don't have a sweet tooth, dont bother. I don't normally have a sweet tooth but this recipe has a certain saltiness chocolatey taste to it that I will do it over and over again!!! Speaking of which, I'm gonna go fight over the last piece with my 6 year old right now!

I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan. Soft chewy center but the top and corners were too hard even at 30 min. The chocolate chips added a weird texture to the brownie. I'm still looking for a homemade recipe that measures up to Ghiradelli brownie mix.

I've made these a lot of times now; they're really good, and quick to make (not 15 minutes for me, but 30, which is still pretty fast). Changes I make: half the sugar, whole wheat, sometimes replace half the chocolate chips with white chocolate chunks because I have them, and 1/3 cup rum.

They tasted awful. There is entirely too much vanilla called for and I don't understand the need for 4 EGGS. After they cooled they were extremely hard, crunchy and crumbled everywhere.

Made it in a 9x9 pan halving the ingredients. Substituted milk chocolate chips with white chips as I had those handy. Taste and texture of the brownies were both very good. Just the right amount of sweetness and fudginess. But the batter really needs to be spread evenly. Would prefer thicker brownies next time.

BEST BROWNIES EVER !!!!!
I halved the recipe and baked in 8 in square pan. I melted the chocolate chips in hot butter, added 1/4 tsp baking soda and used only 3/4 cup of sugar. I also stirred in some chopped walnuts. I didn't use the mixer, instead I wisked everything with a wisk. The brownies are moist, not too sweet , gooey and delicious ! This one is a keeper :)

These brownies are good if you eat them while they are still warm out of the oven. However, when you eat them on day 2 they taste like you are eating a straight stick of butter.

I have been looking for a brownie recipe that tastes like it came from a box and these were even better than I could have ever hoped for or dreamed! The only downside is that I find they dry out really fast. I don't know if it's because I cooked them too long, although I did follow the directions, or if my air tight container isn't as air tight as it used to be, but this is definitely my go to recipe for brownies now :) Thanks for sharing!

I've never liked homemade brownies. Ever. Any of them that I've had or tried have turned out dry, cakey and the flavor was just poor, so I usually just stick with box mix.

These are A.MA.ZING. They are THICK (a good 1 inch tall in a 9x13 pan), fudgy, moist and full of flavor. They are the perfect pair for a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a tall glass of milk.

I didn't have any butter on hand, so I substituted margarine at room temperature and it worked just fine. I brought in the remaining half of the pan to work (because I was going to EAT THEM ALL AT HOME) and they've gotten rave reviews from my coworkers. I've even passed the recipe out a couple of times.

THANKS SO MUCH!

These are awesome brownies! I did make a few changes: I used half white sugar and half brown, added 1/2 tsp baking soda, coated the chocolate chips with flour before adding and sprinkled coarse kosher salt over the top. Served these warm with whipped cream and it was heavenly!!  Will definitely be making these again many times!

These are fabulous! You can trust the timing on the recipe and ignore the toothpick test. They will need to cool in order to "set up" well enough to slice. Gooey deliciousness takes patience so wait for them to cool a bit.

Best recipe I've tried.  This is exactly the consistency I was looking for,  not cakey, but dense, chewy and full of chocolate flavour.  Wouldn't change the recipe at all.  Just added a creamy,chocolate butter icing to top it off.  Heaven!

I made these gluten-free by substituting Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 gluten-free flour, and they turned out really well.  I was short two eggs, so I used 2/3 unsweetened applesauce instead.  I took them to a party and I got rave reviews.  Nobody even knew they were gluten-free :-)  These are definitely fudgy brownies, not cakey brownies.

Waaaayy too much sugar. I used one cup and that was a little much for the balance of the other ingredients.  I would have given this a 5 star but don't ruin it by killing it with 3 cups of sugar, that's crazy. Otherwise they are so delicious!!

Good, but a little too dark chocolate tasting for me (I don't like dark chocolate). I ran out of cocoa once and tried making a blondie with this recipe because I loved the texture. It totally failed (the outside became rock hard and inside was still soup) but it tasted AMAZING!!! Any ideas how to fix this as a blondie recipe and still get the same taste? I added baking soda and that helped but still not right.

Lindies brownies have always been a household staple of mine. The texture of the inside and outside both perfect, delicious walnuts and chocolate pieces. Big, hard obnoxious chocolate pieces. These brownies are ready-made and for sale in my town in South Africa and since October '14 I've been trying almost every recipe under the sun to make them... And this recipe does just that! I am super thrilled to play around and get better results. I followed this recipe to a tee barring the chocolate pieces. For me, they make a brownie overly sweet. Also what most people don't realise when making brownies, is that if you want a soft and almost gooey middle, cook it the time the recipe says and then till it comes out sticky on a knife in the middle. let it cool completely and place it in the fridge to get cold before you slice it. I might add 1/4 cup coconut next time for more texture and I will definitely be using half white half brown sugar in the future. Thank you so much for this recipe!

These were yummy - I used peanut butter stuffed chocolate chips instead of regular and they turned out really good. Nice, thick, and chewy. Will not use box mixes again.

While the one bite I had was VERY good, it was too sweet to eat. Followed the directions exactly. Next time maybe I'll half the sugar!

This brownie recipe is a perfect balance of chewy, dense and fudgy! I made them as is the first time and made the change to half white sugar half brown sugar the next time. I prefer the variation with the brown sugar, but it's a fairly minor change.  The brown sugar imparts a caramel flavor. Thanks for the recipe, Brooke!

I made this with dark chocolate cocoa powder. They were the hit of the party. Keep the 24 servings in mind; I originally cut it into 12 pieces and it was too rich to eat at once. Smaller is better in this case.

Spectacular! Definitely a keeper. I used half/half white and brown sugar and half/half butter/plain yogurt and they were amaaaazing. I also threw in a small handful of leftover caramel chips along with the chocolate chips (both of which I tossed with flour to prevent sinking). The recipe made a 9x9 pan of brownies and (just) 12 good sized muffins! Very rich and fudgy. Thanks so much!

This has become my go to recipe for brownies. Everyone raves over them every time I make them. Sometimes I add heath pieces, caramel, walnuts or pecans, but each time I use this recipe for the best home-made brownies everyone! Thank you so much for sharing!

This recipe is fantastic!!!!!!!!. I make them quite a bit. THEY are very rich and moist. I did it in a smaller pan so they could be more thick and it turned out great. They were very soft and had a little crisp top and they were delicious. I used milk chocolate chocolate chips and it was great I prefer baking with milk chocolate rather than semisweet or dark because it tastes sweeter and a bit creamier. If I go somewhere people will be like "wheres your brownies". THis is just the greatest recipe I have ever used.

these brownies turned out great the first time I made them. But I was sceptical of all the sugar they use I felt so bad eating one brownie I try this recipe 3 more times and all the times my brownies turned out terrible I did they same thing I did when I made my very first batch I follow the recipe to the t but the tops hardens like a rock when cooled and they tasted of butter and pure sugar don't know why went wrong but I definitely won't be making again.

I am not into brownies but my hubby requested that I made it. He loves it and I do too. I didn't cut down on sugar and I don't think it is too sweet. It is a sweet item after all. The full recipe would be too much so I cut it down to 2/3 of the recipe and baked it in 9x9 pan. It is perfect! Thank you for sharing.

These are pretty good, but not quite what I'm looking for. They were dense and fudgey as promised. They did have the brownie crackle-crust on top. They tasted incredibly rich and chocolatey. The problem for me is that on the second day they needed to be microwaved to be good. I suspect a slightly more cakey texture would have lasted better. 

I baked mine in a glass 9x13 pan and they were the perfect thickness and finished cooking at 35 minutes. Glass vs light metal vs dark metal will make a difference in your cooking time and quality, as will placement in the oven. Put them in the center or slightly below it.

These brownies are truly amazing!  I have never really been able to successfully make brownies, even from a box.  Mine are always too dry (I blame my high altitude).  These were perfect!  I however, could not being myself to add 3 cups of sugar so I did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown.  Worked perfectly.  Also, I used Special Dark cocoa powder because it was what I had on hand.  Yumm!  I found my new go to brownie recipe for sure!

LOVE these brownies. Recipes is comparable to those delicious two bite brownies that you can buy at the grocery stores :)... The only change I make is playing with the type of chocolate chips. Sometimes I add half semi-sweet/ half milk chocolate chunks. This will be my ONLY brownie recipe from now on!

Absolutely the best brownie I've made. They are incredibly chewy with an intense chocolate flavour. This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe. I baked the brownies for 45 minutes as the centre was still a little too moist after 40 minutes of baking. This resulted in edges that were a little harder than the rest of the brownie, however, nothing was wasted. I trimmed the edges, cut them into a tiny dice, froze the trimmed pieces and later added them into vanilla ice cream for a brownie ice cream treat. I highly recommend this recipe if you love a chewy, fudgy brownie that does not have any cake-like qualities. The moisture content of the brownies stays the same after 4 days stored in the refrigerator provided the brownies are wrapped in plastic wrap or zippered freezer bags.

These were amazing.  I sprinkled the chocolate chips on top so it wouldn't interfere with the toothpick check (I usually overbake brownies).  Finally a recipe that didn't turn out cakey or dry.  These were so rich and so fudgy.  To die for!

We LOVED these brownies. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because I only used 2.25 cups sugar, and it was plenty sweet. Three cups may be tasty, but I really think they would be too sweet. I usually make 'Best Brownies' http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-brownies/ from this site. The recipes are quite similar. With less sugar and the addition of pecans, this is my new favorite Brownie. Thank you

Wow. Fantastic brownies. My family loves chocolate, me not so much. So when I tried this recipe and it melted in my mouth, I knew I had a winner. Thank you so much for this recipe. The only change I made was split the sugar into half white and half light brown. Yummy!

I love this recipe! I've used it numerous times since I found it and every time they turn out amazing. I've gotten so many compliments on them and will never use a box brand again! I've even spiced them up by adding Andes Mint within and on the brownies, caramel sauce drizzled on top, cacao nibs within, and chocolate chips within. My next adventure is trying out peanut butter chips, as my boyfriend is begging to try it.

Absolutely delish! I have made this recipe countless times, and it is one of my favorites. I do reccoend using 2 1/2  cup sugar instead of 3 cups though. This is the best bownie recipe I have found. Very good!

Used half the sugar and substituted the butter with olive oil.  Very nice results. Better than store bought.

Best brownies ever. Perfectly sweet, chewy and fudgy, just like a brownie should be. Followed recipe exactly, or I wouldn't comment, I mean, how can you place your opinion,  if you don't follow a recipe exactly! Absolutely awesome!

Taste just like brownies from a fancy bakery.  These brownies are just the type that I love...gooey/sticky on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside.  Let's face it, if you are a true brownie lover the sweetness of these brownies will be just right to have with a tall glass of ice cold milk.  Follow the recipe exactly as stated and you won't be sorry.  I baked mine for 40 min. in the suggested 9 x 13 pan to get the edges slightly crisp and did toss the choc. chips in a little bit of flour.  They turned out better than I could have ever expected.  Don't worry the 9 x 13 pan won't make thin brownies, but perfectly thick brownies because you make a pretty decent amount of batter to fill the pan with.  If you want to impress anyone with your baking skills, these will do the trick.  My family and friends devoured them...now I need to make more!

I made this recipe today and it was really amazing! Exactly what I wanted! Fudgy and chewy! Only thing I did different was use pure cane sugar in place of regular sugar and baked it for 20 mins in a 13x9 pan. I let it cool then cut into it and it was perfect!! This is definitely a keeper in my recipe book!

They are delicious!  We used dark chocolate chips instead of semi or milk.  Also adjusted recipe for 12 servings & baked for 25 minutes in a pumpkin shaped cake pan.  Fun & yum!

TO, DIE, FOR! The first time I tried this recipe, my family was in heaven. My aunt (who owns her own bakery & deli) even said the brownies were "perfectiiioonn"—in her words lol. Brooke, this recipe really is the bomb! After baking these brownies multiple times, I've found that using a ceramic pan fully cooks them, unlike using a metal pan, which kind of leaves them with an under baked texture. These brownies literally taste 1000x better & are delightfully fudgier than store-bought bakery brownies. And of course, after baking these you won't ever want to go back to boxed brownies!

Look no further, as this is undoubtedly THE PERFECT brownie recipe! I made them with this German Chocolate Cake frosting http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/17765/german-chocolate-cake-frosting
Absolutely to die for. Will be making this every time we need a brownie fix!

Thank you Brook for a fabulous option to making brownies. These are the best! I've made these 3 times now. One time I made w/o the chips because I didn't have any. The taste was still good, but the rich chewiness was definitely compromised. Don't forget the chocolate chips!

Excellent!  One reviewer said "too sweet" (although I think sweet is a given with brownies, and that's not necessarily a bad thing).  Only changes I made were decrease sugar by about 1/2 cup, and increased flour by about 1/4 to 1/3 cup only because I'm at high altitude.  I usually like nuts in brownies, but this recipe is better without nuts.  Very good and I will make these often!

Wow, these are the best from scratch brownies ever. First, I used the 9x13 pan and I think this is the ideal pan for this recipe. I used 1/2 light brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, I know from other recipes that brownies take more sugar than flour but was a little nervous to all that white sugar. I really liked using 1/2 and 1/2, I think next time I'll try just a hair less sugar in total. I used the whole cup of Nestle cocoa, and followed the rest of the recipe as stated.

I made the recipe exactly as stated, and they came out well. I cooked mine in an 11 x 14" glass pan as I saw someone say how thick they were even in a 9 x 13 pan. I baked them for the length of time it said, but probably could have added another 5 minutes. Glass pans seem to take a little longer. Anyway, there was nothing *wrong* with these brownies, but they are just too rich and fudgy for my taste. They had a nice brownie 'crust' on top, which I always like and is important to some, so I thought I'd mention that. If you're looking for really dark and rich brownies with a nice crust, then go for these. If you want something not quite so intense, find another recipe.

These brownies were just OK. They were VERY fudgy and chewy. I actually thought they were too chewy. Almost beyond a brownie texture. I did substitute 1 C of brown sugar for white, per user suggestion and I regret that. The flavor is a decent but not spectacular.

These brownies truly are the BOMB!  They remind me of the kind of brownies you find in a coffee shop and don't taste at all like boxed brownie mix.  They have more of a cocoa powder, richer flavor.  Yum!

Nice crust on top, chewy in the middle. Best "from scratch" brownies I have made. I substituted 1/2 cup vegetable oil for half the butter and cut out 1/3 or 1/2 a cup of sugar.

These are probably the best brownies I've ever had & that's saying a lot because I usually try different recipes each time I go to make something. I actually made an account just to rate the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, however, my baking time was 27 minutes. Its strange because a lot of the ratings state that their brownies were fudgy & dense, but mine were.more light & fluffy. There is only one thing that I did at the end of the recipe, I added chocolate & caramel syrup to the top of the brownies, but other than that nothing was changed. All in all very good recipe, will be making these again. Might even become my go-to brownie recipe. Thank you so much.

These turned out really well after letting them sit. Although after cutting 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup flour + 1 egg out of the recipe I can still taste a bit of eggness in the brownies. 
The best brownies I've had were a package kit from Betty crocker.

This was my first time to make home-made brownies. They came out PERFECT and look just like the picture! I love chewy, fudgey brownies with flaky top and these were just that. I was a little nervous because I didn't have eggs, only egg beaters. I used 1 cup of egg beaters and they worked just as well. I baked for 35 minutes and although the knife wasn't completely dry when I pulled it out, I knew they would continue baking a little in the pan. I'm glad I did not bake them any longer. They were perfect!!! Everyone who tried them loved them.

These were the best brownies.  My husband said to make sure I kept this recipe.  This made a perfect batch of chewy, fluffy brownies.  Definitely make this in a 9X13 pan.  I did need to cook it for 30 min.  These were moist and chocolaty.  The pan didn't even last 24 hours.  Definitely a keeper recipe to pass down to the kids.

I liked them. I think they needed a little more depth in flavor. I used a high quality cocoa powder, but the flavor wasn't the greatest. They were sweet, but the sweetness and chocolate did not pop like I thought they would. I will say that these seemed to taste better frozen with ice cream.

These are a keeper. Bottom line, if you like a dense fudge brownie this is your new go to recipe and you will never need to look again. All of the tips in the reviews are awesome, I suggest reading them and finding the tweaks that sound good to you. I think the best overall is to split the sugar into half white, half brown. Also, to line your baking dish with parchment paper! you can lift those babies right out of there, so much easier! I'm a huge fan of parchment paper, I'm surprised I've never thought to use it for brownies.

Unfortunately I didn't stick to the recipe 'exactly' because I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar as I do with most of my baking. I am fairly confident that these are just as tasty with all white sugar and will gladly rate 5 stars. Mine baked for about 29-30 min and they were perfect (soft and chewy with firm edges). Unless I am out of cocoa then I won't use a box brownie mix again.

Havnt finished cooking it yet but whilst cleaning up; the batter is delicious.   I dont even care if I get salmonella poisoning, worth it.  

Done cooking, yes...this is an amazingly fudgy brownie.  So simple I cant wait to share it.  I will be making again.

The flavor on these is intense and delicious.  One problem I had that others may too, depending on your oven,  is the top may crumble when cut and the edges may get crispy. A trick I learned to deal with this with cookies is to sub in shortening for half of the butter. Butter makes a crispier cookie/brownie, shortening makes a more gooey one. Other than that issue, these are great!

This is definitely a chocolate lovers delight. My husband loved it. For my taste it was a little over the top with the cocoa flavor which I don't think if I reduced a little would take away from the fudginess. I'll give it a try next time. I did however love the intense vanilla flavoring.

This is a great brownie recipe.  I too have made the 'Outrageous brownie' recipe from Ina, but have to agree that this does surpass it (plus it's cheaper to make!)   I didn't have the extra chocolate chips so left them out but added chopped pecans.  I baked them in mini cupcake tin for about 15 minutes at 180F fan oven.  Don't forget to butter your pan.  I dusted them with powdered sugar and they are great!  Thank you Brooke who ever you are!  This is saved as a bookmark.

I am a young baker and i tried this recipe for the first time it was DELICIOUS! Everyone loved it. Next time in thinking of replacing the chips with dark chocolate and the cocoa powder with dark chocolate, can't wait to try them. I'll let you guys know how it was.

Don't get me wrong, these were really good but, they turned out more cake like for me. The recipe makes a lot of batter, and I cut 1cup of sugar because it was really sweet with just 2 cups. Other brownie recipes call for minimal mixing, maybe that's why these were more cake like? None the less, if you need a chocolate fix, these will do it.

The Best brownie recipe I have ever made. Moist chewy and fudgy. I made the recipe as stated except I used half white and half brown sugars as suggested and when the brownies came out of the oven I checked for doneness with a toothpick, the batter was very loose, so what I did was to leave them to cool completely and they came out perfect.

This is the best recipe for brownies I've found so far. I don't care for fudge type brownies. So this recipe is the perfect balance of fluffly and chewy. They're not cake like, nor are they too thin. I did cute the recipe in half and baked in a 8x8 baking dish. The second time I did the same thing but subsituted half the sugar for brown sugar. They came out delicious.

Absolutely delicious.  Tastiest brownie ever.  My came out cakey which is not what I wanted.  I imagine I did something wrong.  I'm going to try it again until I get the texture right because the flavor is so awesome.

These are easy to make, chocolaty, chewy, fudgy, and moist. But, they are way too sweet. Like, nauseatingly sweet. Next time I make them I'll probably cut out some of the sugar. Still, a really good recipe.

Made these brownies for my fiancé today. The verdict - "best brownies EVER!" Perfect consistency. I used 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  My fiancé told me to keep this one "in the vault." Happy Valentine's Day!

These are by far the best brownies we have ever made. Today is our 10th making them. They're addictive and so delicious. Once in awhile my husband has a craving for these brownies and they're so easy to prepare / takes about about 5-10 minutes. We will never go back to box brownies.

I never met a brownie I didn't like... until I made these. Too much sugar! Batter never cooked thru. I think the butter should be soft, not melted, but that's just me. I was not happy and won't make these again. I wish they had worked out better. I used a lot of expensive ingredients and was very dissatisfied.

I made these tonight, and the ingredients call for way too much sugar. The sugar was so much that I couldn't eat them. Other than that, this is a good recipe! I'll try them again with a cup less sugar and I bet that does the trick.

Brooke, I don't know you but I hate you! These brownies are BEYOND FANTASTIC!!!! This was my first attempt at both homemade and gluten free brownies. They were so good, I could not help but eat them as they were cooling in the pan. I hope they make it through the next 20 minutes! I added peanut butter chips along with the chocolate chips. So delicious! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I made this to take to my mother-in-law's house for our family Christmas celebration and it was a hit. I made it exactly as directed and they turned out beautifully-crunchy top with a fudgy, chewy interior.  Thanks for sharing!

Best brownie recipe in a while!
I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 7x7 pan instead of 9x13. Worked out perfect. Instead of 1 1/2 cups sugar (if you split the recipe in half) or 3 cups, I suggest putting at least a 1/4 cup less. Make sure you put in less salt if you do, though, because mine turned out the slightest bit salty.

Still awesome.

Gonna put in a little more sugar and a little less salt this time and see how it goes.

Stellar chewy brownie. I did do half/half white to brown sugar and only had the premiere white chocolate chips in the house. Very rich and very tasty! If you are using a 13x9 at 350 degrees, check the pan at 30 mins. Thanks Brooke!

The texture of these brownies was outstanding!  Very fudgy and chewy with a crackle top.  They were PLENTY thick in at 13x9 pan.  They were VERY sweet though - almost to the point of being "one note".  I may try adding more cocoa powder next time. The butter instead of oil in this recipe is delicious!!!  I also like the saltiness of these brownies - I used the amount of salt in the recipe in addition used salted butter.  

I am a cook cook and baker, but brownies have always eluded me.  This is the best recipe I've tried so far.  I'm going to keep tweaking it because this is the best recipe I've tried so far.

Update:  I originally rated these 4 stars because of sweetness.  I have found these brownies are even better the next day and have updated my rating to 5 stars.  THIS is my new brownie recipe!

Made this tonight, used 3c of Splenda & added about 3/4c of pecans & in addition to 1c of semi sweet chips, I added 1/2c white chocolate chips. WAY TOO SWEET! And trust me, I have a sweet tooth. I cooked it for 35 mins and that was a little too long I think cause they came out a bit hard even while still to hot to eat. My brother & my kids liked them but I probably won't make them again, sorry :(

Consistently bad bake from this recipe, despite bakeware and appliance changes. Mixture is too wet and brownies are inedible as brownies. Will look for a stronger mix.

I was nervous to try this, as any brownie I've ever made was from a box. After beating well after each addition of egg my batter looked more like chocolate meringue than the runny cheap stuff I'm used to seeing.  At this point I was more anxious than in the beginning but I chose to see the recipe all the way through, and am more than pleased with the results. This is a foolproof recipe - I'm pretty sure I messed it up & they still turned out perfect.

These brownies are fabulous!!! Fudgey, chocolately and delish!! I thought about cutting/substituting some of the sugar, but decided to follow the recipe to a T. Sooo glad I did because they are TO DIE FOR!! I listened to anothe review, took them out at 35 min and let them cool completely before cutting...heaven!!! Just a warning, the batter is quite thick and spreading it was a task...but this is the best brownie recipe ever!!! NEVER do the brownie in a box again!!! Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out amazing!  Definitely the best brownies I've ever made.  I'm not a huge chocolate person, but these brownies will make you crave them.  Perfect combination of cake-like and fudgy.  The chocolate chips are a great addition.  I also agree with some other posters that they are even more amazing the next day.  That is...if there are any left the next day!  Definitely my go-to brownie recipe from now on.

this recipe is really the bomb. One thing you can do to twist the recipe is add some caramel into the brownie. Great taste and kids will love it.

My chocoholic family loved the brownies! They turned out perfect. I wanted thick brownies so I used an 8x8 stone baking dish and only needed to cook an additional 8 min. We poured warm raspberry jam on with vanilla ice cream, so yummy!

These are so simple to make!  I followed the directions exactly and they came out nice and crisp on the outside while moist/chewy on the inside. Nice rich chocolate flavor.  I might try it with half white half brown sugar next time as others have done, but I honestly can't see how it could improve the recipe.  It's that good!

The perfect brownie...I didn't have the semi sweet chips so I put in an extra 1/4 cup cocoa and reduced the sugar to 3 1/2 cups and they were perfect.  Thanks!

I made these last night and they are the best homemade brownies I ever had.  I made my own white chocolate cream cheese icing to top them.  I followed the recipe except I did the half brown sugar and half white substitution.  Excellent, thanks Brooke!

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for. Crispy on the outside and super chewy on the inside. I cut the recipe in half because there is only 2 of us and the wife doesn't eat sweets! I halved the recipe to 12 servings and used a glass 11x7 pyrex pan. Brownies were around 3/4 to 1 inch thick - perfect!

These brownies tasted more like dry chocolate cake. Using a 9x13 inch pan made the brownies thin. They weren't moist and fudgey even after I added semisweet chocolate moresels.

This is my go-to brownie recipe for the last 3 years. My boyfriend actually asks me to make these for him, and he doesn't usually like sweets. For these I follow the recipe exactly (sometimes I omit the chocolate chips, or substitute for walnuts, mmmm) except that I take them out a little before they are completely cooked through. This makes them stay fudgy and chewy for days instead of getting hard.

These brownies are way too sweet for me.  I used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 cups, and I like it much better!  I did not melt butter which would make the brownies chewy, but used softened butter, so it is more like cakey.

Most successful from-scratch brownies that I've ever made. They are rich and dense, but mine turned out a little dry. I think I could have overcooked them at 40 min, my oven may run hotter than hers. I followed other suggestions and cut the sugar down to 2 cups, using 1 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown. When I was cleaning up I also realized I had grabbed the 1/3 c. instead of the 1/4 c. for the cocoa powder so mine were extra chocolatey. That could also have accounted for the slight dryness. I'll definitely try these again with the right tools!

these are incredible!  Some of the best brownies I have ever tasted.  Makes a HUGE pan of brownies ... I filled a 9X13 pan and they were thick.  Next time I 1/2'ved the batch and used a 7X11 - still made plenty and they were slightly thinner.

These were sooo good!  I made 4 different brownie recipes last night, 2 from this site and 2 from another and 2 recipes were tie for first place (the other one that tied with it was from a different site).  They were rich and fudgy although I think that they were a little too moist so I will try cooking them a little longer next time. So delicious!

I feel a bit awful writing this review. I'm not sure what I did wrong, the only thing I changed, was I used Splenda, and did not add chips. The first thing I noticed was wrong, was as I was adding the flour/chocolate mixture, the batter was becoming WAY too thick - and sticky! I could barely get it mixed, I had to add a bit of water, just to finish it. I was hoping that it would stll turn out - it didn't. When I took them out, they were so cakey looking, but not a sweet cake. They tasted like, honestly, a brownie I would find in a Nutrisystem meal. =/ They weren't hardly sweet, I can't even explain the dense texture, they were like a hardish, but soft, cake like lump. I'm just not sure what I did wrong? Was using Splenda instead of sugar what did all THAT?! Please help :(

LOVE these - for those of you cutting the sugar, we find these are even better if you use DARK cocoa powder (we use Hershey's Special Dark) which is more bitter so you would not feel the need to cut it - :)

I made these for my boyfriend to take to work to share with all the guys. By the end of the day, every single man had told him that he better not screw it up with me, being such a great baker and all! Haha!!! Best brownies indeed. I wouldn't make a single change to the recipe. Delicious!

Hands down the best homemade brownie recipe out there! Definitely follow the other instructions by using half white sugar and half brown sugar. Also, decrease the amount of sugar by about a half a cup, they turn out so fudgy and delicious! Every time I make these, they are a huge hit!

This is the perfect brownie - dense, rich chocolate flavor and ingredients that you would normally have in your pantry for one-of-those-days that you just gotta have a brownie.  The only changes that I made was I only used 2 cups of sugar and I sprinkled the chocolate chips on top.   Oh and I used almost 2 cups of cocoa powder cuz that's the way I roll :).  And you must mix by hand, suck it up people.  That's how these will turn out like a brownie and not chocolate cake. I made these for a party and the entire tray was gone.  Now, I have to make another, oh darn. Wink wink.

Made mine with no butter!  Just substituted with half organic vanilla milk, half applesauce, and added walnuts and a little extra chocolate chips.  DELICIOUS AND A HALF and no butter??!?!? Dream come true.

I made this recipe exactly as it is shown. They turned out good. The same type of top of the brownies you get from boxed and have not been able to replicate on my own. 

But, very sweet and very chocolately. Way too much!

For me, next time, I will cut down the sugar a little and reduce the amount of chocolate chips.

I'd never made brownies before, these were perfect from the first try.  At first I thought they were only good when they first come out of the oven, but they're good day after day!  I'm so happy I came across this, thanks Brooke!  I did only bake them for 30 minutes, I felt they continued cooking in the tin and were perfectly moist that way.

ABSOLUTELY SCRUMPTIOUS!! Like others I made a few substitutions, 1.5 Cs of brown sugar and 1.5 Cs of white sugar, and dark chocolate chips 70%. The came out chewy, rich, chocolatey, delicious!

These brownies are to die for! I made a couple of little changes - substituted unsweetened applesauce for half the butter, added a quarter cup of brewed espresso left over from breakfast and used 1 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 1/4 cup white sugar. They are sooooo good! Also, they are perfect with a scoop of ice cream on top - I like chocolate on chocolate - the perfect Death By Chocolate experience ha ha.. Thanks for a great recipe Brooke :)

Delicious brownies but you can't have a lot of it as it is quite dense.  Chewy on the inside and crusty on the outside.  Can't mold these brownies very well but best eaten as is (not dipped in melted chocolate).

YUM!  Used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar (the whole amount) and added Mint Dark chocolate pieces to them.  They were a huge hit and very rich!   Super easy recipe.  Will definitely make again!

I never write reviews on recipes unless I'm truly passionate about the results i got from them. I did not alter this recipe in any way, and the brownies that came from it were AMAZING. I mean, astonishing. The kind of brownies you crave when its that time of the month, or when you're getting over a hard breakup. These are thick, moist, fudgy pieces of heaven. The batter is really thick when i poured it into the baking dish, so i used a greased spatula to spread it, but other than that, i ran into no problems. & In turn, i was blessed with brownies that make your mouth water and your family fat & happy!
Try these, at least once, and i guarantee you will not be sorry.

fantastically chewy! instead of chocolate chips, i used reeses minis because my significant other likes peanut butter everything. was delicious. my only criticism might be that it seemed to be too sweet, i will be adjusting as necessary in the future. 
and i am just getting over a cold so maybe my taste buds are playing a trick on me, but it seemed a tad salty.

I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.  Although they turned out, I did not care for them. I'm not even a picky eater at all.  I'm not sure what it is.. maybe needs more cocoa? Either way, they were too 'cake like' and so bland.

Makes the best brownie bites hands down! I did the original recipe and it was PERFECT. I think next time I might try the half white, half brown sugar just to see how it changes the taste. I used my mini cupcake pans and baked them for about 12 - 15 minutes. The centers were slightly gooey, then firmed up on the cooling rack. I got 48 AWESOME bites from just a single batch. BROOKE, you rock.

Very tasty. These brownies are sweet without being overwhelming and just moist enough enough to be fudgey without falling apart completely as you eat them. Since it's just me and my wife, I made half the recipe in a 9x9 pan, and they turned out great. I personally like swapping half the semisweet chocolate chips for white chocolate chips; it looks nice and tastes even better.

I`ve made this recipe in 3 different countries: the US, Spain, and Brazil.  Everyone always begs for me to make it again/translate the recipe.  While it`s amazing with the chocalate chips/chunks and the Vanilla gives it a bit richer flavor; I've discovered out of necessity that it tastes very good without either--people in Brazil can`t even tell when the vanila is left-out, though they don`t use vanilla much here.  The key is to turn off the heat at the right moment-when it`s still just a little bit gooey.  It firms up as it cools.  If you cook it past this point it gets to hard.  Also if cooking in an oven with only one source of heat (at the bottom) you need to turn up the heat a little bit.  Incredible brownie recipe and the only one I make.  Thanks!

I make these almost weekly for my students or co-workers. They are always a hit. I've added coconut to them and also used the recipe without chocolate chips as a base for mint brownies or other topped brownies.

This recipe is AWESOME! This was my first time making homemade brownies (instead of out of the box) and they turned out great. Some minor changes I made: 1.5 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, and used the Hershey's 'Special Dark' cocoa powder. I cooked them for 25 mins and they were perfectly ready. I have saved this recipe in my recipe book and I will definitely use it again and again! Thank you for sharing it!

Amazing. so good. Should try them warm with some vanilla ice cream. Only neg thing they didn't keep the chewyness for many days after and went stale quite quickly thou this is resolved easily by heating in the microwave and enjoying warm. I actually made them with 100g less of sugar seemed to make no difference to taste.

I've been trying to find a brownie recipe that comes out super fudgey, just how my boyfriend likes them.. these were perfect ! I followed the recipe exactly except I followed others advice in melting half a cup of semi sweet chips with the butter in a double boiler. I then added a little less than a cup of chips in the batter right before baking. I baked them for 40 minutes and they came out chewy and soft and delicious ! Will definitely use this recipe from now on.

These are very good brownies.  They come out thick and chewy so don't try to cook in a smaller pan.  The mini chips are a good idea.

Yum! Love these! This will be my go-to brownie recipe. I also split the sugar half white / half brown. For the brown portion, I actually used a little bit of light brown sugar and mostly dark brown sugar (just trying to use up what I had open already.) I cooked for 35 minutes in my Bosch oven and they were perfect. I love the texture. Mine were quite similar to the first picture - a cakey-looking texture, but very dense and fudgey.

These are really good brownies if you like them super sweet and not as chocolately. Even though there's a lot of chocolate in them, the richness is overpowered by sweetness. 3 cups of sugar is expensive in this economy and is better served in two batches. I did bake them in a 9x13" dish, and was pleased with the thickness. Good, but too sweet and expensive

I made this with 1c brown sugar and 1c white sugar, and melted half the choc in with the butter, and added 1/2t coffee powder.  If you want a fudgy brownie then use 3c sugar.  Mine turned out a bit cakey but was still very delicious.

These were some of the best brownies I have ever had!  I halved the recipe and baked them in a 11x7 pan for a shorter time (25 min).  They were a huge hit, everyone loved them!!  The first time I made them, I forgot the chocolate chips and they were delicious.  The second time, I remembered the chocolate chips and they were amazing!  So much better than a box mix, but just as easy to make.

Delicious...these were the perfect thickness for me. It had a bit of a crust on top, not crumbly, not chewy, not cakey. Just right! I cut the sugar to just 2 cups and used milk chocolate chips. Another reviewer warned not to cut the sugar but I did and they were just perfect for me. Can't stop raving. I used butter...this is key to the richness. That and Hershey's cocoa and chips. Awesome.

Wow!  Yesterday was my sons girlfriends moms b-day.  I made up a quick batch of these delicious brownies & they brought them to her at work.  She shared them with everyone.  Here are some of the comments: "Wow! she could make millions off these brownies", "This is the best brownie I've ever had", & "One person said such an amazing compliment that I can't even repeat it".  Thank you so much Brooke for making me look so good!!!  I only tryed this recipe because it was my granddaughters 5th birthday & since her name is Brooke this was the one I had to try, and thank God that I did.  Love, Love, Love it!!!! I have made them five times. 1.  Exactly like the recipe states except I half the recipe and replace 1/2 cup of sugar with lite brown sugar. Lightly grease & flour an 8x8 pan, and bake for 25-27 minutes.  Perfection!!  Oh, I dont beat in the eggs, I just whisk them in.  When I beat them in, the final result wasnt as pretty & the edges were harder. 2.  I have added a chocolate glaze with crushed m&ms. 3.  I've swapped semi-sweet chips for milk choc. & peanut butter. 4. I've did half batch; 1/4 c. cocoa, 1/4 c. hot fudge sauce, 7 crushed oreo cookies, with 1/4 c semi sweet chocolate chunks everything else the same. P.S. Those are the ones that I made for the b-day girl that received such great reviews 5.  Lastly, used crushed mint oreo cookies This will be my staple brownie recipe.

I've tried three different brownie recipes from scratch and so far this is the best one I've found. Super fudgy. Not too rich. Great with icecream. Will definitely be making these again and my son thinks they are fabulous!

I've made these brownies twice and the 2nd time was the charm. The amount of sugar in this is incredible ... the first batch made following the recipe "as is" created too-sweet brownies we couldn't finish. The 2nd time, however, I cut the sugar in half, added walnuts and butterscotch chips to the chocolate chips and kept everything else the same. They were fantastic! This recipe is a great base and I love that it's flexible enough to allow for less sugar and still be superb.

I think most bakery items in the states are too sweet, so I exchanged one cup of sugar for one cup extra cocoa powder the second time I made it, which made it harder to stir, but more delicious than the first time. Thanks for the recipe! :o) I think I will sub half the butter for plain yogurt the next time to see if there is much a difference in taste with less fat and calories.

Did not cook in the middle even after cooking it 50 minutes at 350.  Perhaps needs more than 1 1/2 cups of flour?

I have never written a recipe review in my life. Before making these, I read over 200 reviews. I then decided to make them exactly as written for the first time. OMG. That is all I can say. I will never make any other recipe again! I am 50 yrs. old and have made alot of brownies in my life and these are by far the best! They are excatly as promised, fudgy and delicious! For anyone that they are not turning out right, it must be your pan or oven. I used a glass pan.

These are beyond delicious! If you don't like rich, gooey, sweet, decadent brownies, then pass on this one. But if you do, then you have found the best brownie recipe out there. I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and I always use Mexican Vanilla in my baking recipes (makes all the difference in the world!), but other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and it was pure chocolate perfection!

This is what a brownie should be!  I whisked the flour, which meant I used far less than if I hadn't (measured after whisking).  I also used 1/2c yogurt with 1/2c butter.  Also used 1/3 vanilla sugar (sugar with vanilla beans stuck in a jar for about a month), along with white and brown sugar.  Not cakey at all, very moist, dense, rich brownie: perfect for brownie sundae!  Thanks Brooke.

Best brownie I've ever eaten - absolutely fantastic!!  Based on other reviews, we changed the 3 cups of white sugar to 1 1/2 cups of white & brown sugar each.  Watch out - this is addictive!

Omg thank you for a fabulous, great, awesome recipe! These came out fudgy, chewy, crispy on the edges, and the perfect height. I followed directions exactly, except adding an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. My 9x13 is glass, so I have to figure out the timing better, they were a bit overcooked on edges, undercooked in middle at 35 minutes. I turned down 20 degrees at that time after finding out that glass dishes should cook at a lower temp and I cooked prb about an add'l 10 minutes. But these will be a definite keeper! Thank you so much!

I originally rated this lower, years ago.  I was searching for a brownie recipe to be topped by homemade salted caramel, and came across another recipe on another site that was the same as this.  I had made this multiple times, and it constantly turned dry.  This time, I was determined--considering it had high reviews--to make this right. I mean, 2k+ people can't love dry dense brownies, right?  
 
This time, they turned out freakin' spectacular.  I did NOT use my KitchenAid (*sigh*), instead opting for a wooden spoon so I couldn't overmix.  I also took these out of the oven right. at. 35. minutes. They continued to cook in the pan and came out wonderfully with the caramel. They were thick (1"-1.5") and fudge-like.  This time, I did it right, and man, were they awesome :)

These are my absolute favorite recipe.  We won't use another recipe.  A lightly crunchy top and bottom, chewy inside.  It does NOT need frosting.  We found this recipe in March, and have made this recipe about a dozen times.  We make it before taking a trip.  Update, we were out of choc. chips and used white choc. chips.  It still gives a crunchy top, slightly different color and taste.

Didn't turn out as great as I thought it would be. I used a smaller pan, halved the recipe. It didnt come out chewy or gooey at all. Really cake-y. I don't know whats really wrong. I baked it for roughly 30minutes. Because I was using a black pan I reduced the temperature by 10-15 degrees. Did not turn out as well as I wished it to be.

Amazing. Quite possibly the best brownie recipe I have tried to date! I halved the recipe and put in tinfoil meat pie trays to make individual sized portions for those late night cravings. Reduced the cooking time to 25 minutes.

i love this recipe! i make it whenever i get a hankering for something sweet. typically i don't use the chocolate chips because my husband doesn't like overly-sweet desserts. the chocolate chips make it very rich, so if you want something a little less intense, the recipe is great without them.

Perfect!!!! Just the way my family likes brownies. Since we are chocoholics, I added the whole bag of chocolate chips and they all loved it.

These were the best brownies I have ever tasted!  I didn't change a thing except make half of the recipe and use an 8 x 8 pan instead.  Thanks!

Finally my search for THE brownie recipe has ended. These are delicious, chewy and rich and fabulous. Made them just the way the recipe says and they are great. My baking time was a little longer but I also used a glass pan...

Better than "Best Brownies"!  This is definitely for chocolate lovers.  Be sure to cook for at least the required time or you won't get that crispy crust.  Yum.

These brownies have a good flavor. added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  my problem was that i had to bake them 1/2 an hour longer than called for, because it was like brownie soup with the origanal baking time! :(

baked this recipe today - the brownies are really good and rich.  I am currently eating them hot out of the pan.  I think they are good hot - hopefully they are the same once they are cool.  I did have to bake them a lot longer than the suggested 35 minutes.  I bake a lot and dont ever have this issue - so I'm not sure why, I just hope they dont dry out as they cool.  Either way - not the recipe's fault if they do. Only change I made was using dark chocolate chips.  UPDATE: Okay, I'm pregnant so give me some slack, but these were so good I ate the whole pan by myself with the exception of three pieces that I barely shared.  I like fudgy, chewy brownies - most of the pan was like this - but the edges were crusty like a lot of people want.  Perfect brownies either way.

Good recipe perfect brownies with a bit of adjusting if needed. I knew we would end up eating wayy too many of these so I cut the sugar and butter in half and only used 3 eggs I also used white chocolate instead of semi sweet chocolate chips. So yummy o_o

Very rich and delicious! Great brownies to make when I have time to go from scratch. When I'm short on time, I stick with "Brookies" fudgy brownie cookies :)

Just made 2 batches...perfect brownies. First batch, no changes. 2nd batch added pecans and about a tablespoon of cinnamon. Not cake-like, but fudgy gooey---just like a brownie should be. I have big plans to use this as a base recipe to play with by adding various flavorings, chips, etc. to see what I can come up with. Thanks Brooke! Great Job!

I've never made brownies from scratch before but the reviews were so good I had to try it.  These are AMAZING!!  I only used 2 1/2 cups of sugar but kept everything else the same.  So easy I'll be making these instead of the boxed from now on.

i just made these and they are amazing. by far the most perfect brownie ive ever had. i didnt have enough sugar on hand, so i used 1 cup white sugar and a 1/2 cup brown sugar. they were so good!!! not too dry but not too moist. and not overly sweet, which they probably would have been if i had used the 3 cups of sugar. i could eat the whole pan!

Really good recipe overall, but too sweet for me. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar which drew complaints; however, 2 cups of sugar gets rave reviews from guests (especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream). This is also a great recipe for throwing in nuts, and I find people still love them even when you omit the chocolate chips.

These brownies tasted very good and the instructions were so easy that it only took me a few minutes to mix up the ingredients. However, once they were baked and cooled when I tried to get them out of the pan they just kind of crumbled apart. Instead of being able to eat these with our hands we had to get out the plates and forks because they were falling apart. Not sure what went wrong, but they still tasted good. I will probably try making them again, but if it's still really crumbly then I will look for a different recipe. The taste IS phenomenal though! Thanks for the recipe.

I actually only had 1/2 c of cocoa powder on hand and went with it...and they were still delicious--kind of a lighter chocolate flavor, with a fudgy texture. Great recipe! I could see changing up the semisweet chips with chopped chocolate mint candies for the holidays.

These are by far, the BEST brownies I have ever tasted. So fudgey and delicious. I usually don't review things, but these were AWESOME. I recommend not using a mixer and mixing by hand to get the best result. If you like sweet, fudgey brownies, you will love these!

These are the best brownies that have ever come out of my kitchen! My 10 year old daughter made these so that tells you how easy they are. The outside had a nice crackle and the inside had just the right amount of chew and fudginess. They are very rich but worth it.

These brownies are so simple yet always result in such moist, rich treats! My friends cannot get enough. As others have recommended, I make some small changes. I use 1 and 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 and 1/2 cup white sugar and the only other change is that I use kosher salt. There do not disappoint.

I was looking for a recipe that used all butter instead of oil and I found it.  These turned out deliciously.  I even screwed up a step and they still were perfect.

Thank you for this recipe! It was easy to make and I had to make two batches because the first one didn't even cool all the way before they were gone! I think these are better than any box mix or other brownies that I have ever tasted. And sorry the brownies didn't last long enough for me to get a picture of them.

These had good flavor - coco-y goodness rather than an artificial mess.  The problem i had was that they dried out quick.  The best when they are right out of the oven so they are hard to make for work events.

I did not enjoy these. They were too dense since there are no leaveners used in this recipe. I only used two cups of sugar so I can't even imagine how sickeningly sweet they would be using the three cups called for. If you like cake like brownies the M-M-M-M Brownies by Cicada are great and much better than these.

I really love this recipe...have made them three times in two weeks!! I made only two alterations. I used a bit less than 3 cups of sugar. Also, I used 1/2 cup Dutch processed cocoa and 1/2 cup regular cocoa. YUM!

I made these for my children but I could not resist tasting one. They are delicious. I added instant ground coffee which I think enhanced the chocolate flavor. Yum!

These brownies are INCREDIBLE!! Very fudgy! I add 1 cup of chopped walnuts and it gives a nice crunch. One problem thought that I've had with this recipe is that they take 1 hour to bake - longer than the recipe says. I've tried them in 2 ovens and had the same problem both times. Any ideas as to why this happens?

I was actually very disappointed. These turned out more cake-like than brownie, and the cocoa flavor almost overpowered everything else completely. They weren't as rich in chocolate brownie flavor as I had hoped. Mine were only worth eating after I heated them in the microwave once they had cooled, whereas I usually can eat/enjoy my brownies cool.

These were GREAT! I followed the recipe exactly as listed with one exception, I set aside a tablespoon or so of the flour/cocoa mixture to toss the chocolate chips in before adding them to the batter so that they didn't sink to the bottom. I baked them in a 8x10 pan and cooked them an additional 10 minutes. So thick and yummy!

Omitted choco chips since I don't care for the extra chocolate mess, replaced half the sugar with brown sugar and served these up to my roommates. They didn't last a day! Sooooft while still warm, extra chewy fudgy when cool. Some of the best brownies I've ever made! Thank you for the recipe!

It was a better brownie the next day.  It is good, but the unsweetened cocoa powder has a much different taste than the box mix that I am used to.  Not bad, just different.  It didn't mix well with ice cream.  It made the brownie hard.

These were awesome! Seriously amazing. I used white chocolate chips and I substituted 1/2 c butter with applesauce and they were so good. Nobody could tell I used the applesauce.

I had forgotten what scratch brownies are like- I love the crispy top and the chewy inside that sticks to the teeth!  Delish! (Used half brown sugar as suggested...)

These are delicious fresh baked.  By the next day they are dry.  So I would only make them if I knew they would be consumed the same day.

Rich, dense, delicious brownies that were absolutely perfect!! Used an 8X11 pan and ended up with thicker brownies that took about an hour or so to fully cook, but still delish!!

I was REALLY surprised with these brownies! This is definitely my "go to" recipe... Its hard to believe how good these are, since the ingredients are so simple.... But these are really dilicious. I've probably made this recipe 6-8 times already.... Super good!

These are awesome. My only changes were using Milk Chocolate chips (WIHOH), using a glass 8x11 pyrex (Increased cooking time 10 minutes) and not melting the butter first. I dumped the butter, vanilla, sugar an eggs in to my kitchen-aid with the paddle attachment and creamed till smooth. Than I added sifted ingredients and chips. The batter was THICK but just press into the prepared pan best you can. They are for those who like them rich and sweet but if you don't, try them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to cut the sweet! =D

My husband, who is not a big brownie fan, said they're pretty tasty. I stuffed caramels in the batter before baking, just to gild the lilly. ;-)

This was my first time making brownies from scratch, the recipe was easy to follow and the brownies turned out amazing!I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, and instead of semi sweet chocolate chips i used 60 % dark cocoa and they turned out SO good! also at the end i dirizzled on a little bit of carmel... sweet but just so for a brownie.  I will definatley be making these again!

I LOVE these brownies! I follow the recipe as written and they're great.  I also sometimes omit the chocolate chips and instead smush peanut butter cups or York peppermint patties down into the top of the batter.  DH loves the PB cup ones, but they're both a huge hit at work.

Amazing brownie recipe.  I made the following changes: used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, used both white and brown sugar totalling 3 cups, and added approx. 1 cup unsweetened coconut to the final mixture.  Will definitely make these again!

Tried this recipe because of the amount of stars it received.  I was then surprised by the amount of sugar it called for.  I still tried it, not my favorite.  I found it not to be not really fudgie but like a brownie recipe with too much sugar.

Awesome! I made these in a gas oven in an open air kitchen at sea level and they were still great. I didn't get to sift any of the ingredients which I suspect would have made it even better and I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar as suggested. I think that the cadbury's unsweetened cocoa I used worked beautifully. Thank you for the recipe : )

I halved the recipe and also didn't have any chocolate chips. Everyone thought they were delicious. However I do think that if I had added the chocolate chips they would've been too sweet. Definitely will make again!!

These brownies are heavenly! The only thing is that I had to cook them longer than the recipe called for and they didn't look done in the middle but I had to go ahead and take them out because it smelled and looked like the outer edges were burning. Turns out nothing was burned and it was all cooked perfectly.

One word:  Decadent.  If you're just looking for a basic brownie recipe that everyone will love, you can't go wrong.  If you're looking for a rich dessert with beautiful texture, tones, and nuances, it will do that for you too.  Joyously rich, with an amazing balance between the sweet and the bitter.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Worth the hype! Love this recipe. I used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown and white chips in place of semisweet (that was all I had on hand!). So good.

I also tweaked mine with the split of light brown sugar and regular white sugar. I used Dove dark chocolate also in it with walnuts. It was good, but a little too cakey out of the oven. However overnight it took much of the cakeyness out and it was def. more fudgy! I will be using this recipe for a bake sale as it's ingredients are cheap!

These were pretty good. I did use half white and half brown sugar. These didn't come out as chewy as I'd like and I was careful not to beat the eggs too much. Maybe these would be better if the choc chips were melted?

So I've tried this several times and ways (using only 2 C sugar and the 1/2 brown/white sugar) and they are PERFECT (indeed the best!) if you follow the recipe with one exception;  35 min is too long in my oven. They are done in a large double batch pan in 30mins and a smaller 9x13 in 28mins.  When I tried altering the sugar they were drier and cakeier than I like them.  If you don't like things super sweet (as I don't) a better modification would be to use less chocolate chips-- and to make sure you use the semi-sweet and NOT milk chocolate chips in the first place.

These are really good! I made the recipe as is, except I added 1 tablespoon of instant coffee dissolved in 1 tablespoon of water.  The texture is fantastic, but as other viewers said- super sweet.  I think I'll cut out a full cup of sugar the next time I make these.  I don't like things too sweet, so if you do, keep the recipe as written. I've been looking for a rich, chocolate dessert and these are it!

Great recipe! I went half on sugar/half brown sugar, half butter/half shortening & water, and added chocolate chips. I cooked for 37 min and it came out wonderful!! Not bad for having to sub in some ingredients since I didn't have enough to meet the recipe. They are very gooey brownies!

My husband is always craving brownies, but he doens't like "cake like" brownies.  I like making things from scratch, not from a box.  So I tried these.  They are good.  Extremely rich though.  Maybe that's a good thing because I cannot eat these all day even if I wanted too.  I made small changes- I used half brown sugar and half white sugar- but I still used a total of 3 cups- they are very sweet.  I wonder how 2 cups would taste?  I used milk chocolate chips vs semi-sweet because I don't buy semi-sweet.  Another thought- if you are adding nuts, I suggest decreasing the amount of salt you add to the mix.  I tasted the batter after adding the salt- yummy.  Then tasted it again after adding the nuts-salty!  I know the recipe doesn't call for nuts, but what are brownies without walnuts!

GREAT recipe for brownies! The texture is perfect and the flavor is wonderful. I did have to increase the cooking time a little but they turned out just fine. My husband and son approved, and want to know when I'm making another batch! ;)

I made these according to the recipe. I enjoyed them a lot! Definitely the best brownies I've ever had. No need for changes. Very rich, chewy, and deliciously sweet. Surprisingly not as sweet as box mixes, which is a good thing. Loved that the edges did not turn hard on me. This recipe is a keeper!

The perfect brownie! No more box mix for us! I ignored the chocolate chip directions, though. I used 1/3 cup each of Ghirardelli milk chocolate, semi sweet, and dark chocolate chips, plus 1/3 cup of finely chopped hazelnuts. OMGoodness, how perfect!!!!!!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made these for a dinner party with another couple and their twins and they were a huge hit with everyone!  I wanted chocolate peanut butter brownies so I substituted the chocolate chips for mini Reese's peanut butter cups that I froze and cut in half.  I iced them with the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site that I added peanut butter to and topped with more Reese's peanut butter cups.  They were to die for!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Okay, so I halved this recipe and baked in a pretty flat glass pan because I didn't need 24 servings. It turned out flat and kind of hard, and definitely not the chewy gooey goodness I was expecting. Will try it again next time with the full recipe and in a thicker metal pan, but I was pretty disappointed with the results this time :/

These are the best brownies... ever. You have to love sweet, though. They're fudgy without being too moist. The most addictive brownie I have ever had! Use a 9x13 casserole dish and spray with cooking spray. That's what I did and got perfect non-burnt edges and it didn't stick to the pan.

This is such a great recipe! The brownie's shell was perfect with an extremely rich middle! If you don't like really sweet however, these aren't the brownies for you. I've also made them a few times and I would definitely stick with semisweet chips over milk. My only problem was that I cooked them for less then the recipe called for and still the edges were a bit burned. Overall, however, the result was a fantastic brownie that my family loved!!

These are THE BEST brownies I've ever had. My family loves chocolate and sweets. Usually our go-to brownie recipe is 1 box of chocolate cake mix, 1 small box of chocolate pudding and a bag of chocolate chips, which are really moist and chocolatey. We though those were the best ever and declared we never would make any other brownie. Well last night we wanted some and didn't have the stuff for those and I found this recipe, so we decided to try it. These are SO much better! Really easy, and solo delicious. They wre moist, chocolatey, dense, fudgy, just perfect! My whole family said they could eat the whole pan! And I agree!! Like other reviews mentioned, I used 1 1/2 c. Sugar and the other half brown sugar. I made no other alterations. Perfect just the way they are! Right out of the oven, they are gooey and yummy, and I think they're even better the next day warmed up in the microwave a little. Now, I am serious when I say I WILL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER BROWNIE!

These brownies were ok right out of the oven, but when they cooled they were very dense and sugary.

These brownies were amazing. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. If I could give them more then 5 stars, I definitely would. They were even better then grandmas!

Best brownie I have ever made. My twist is using a dark chocolate 50%-70% cocoa instead of the unsweetened chocolate.

I made these the other day for a babys shower and they were so yummy!!!  I didn't have any butter so I used a cup of crisco melted and I also used 2 cups sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  I didn't have the chips so I did what another reviwer did I melted some semi-sweet baking chocolate squares and I also used chopped walnuts in mine.  I baked them in a cookie sheet because  I like thin brownies and then I iced them with a chocolate almond frosting!!!  They were great!!!!

First of all, do not make these with Splenda! It was so bad I had to throw the entire batch away. Stick to the recipe and these will be the best homemade brownies you'll ever eat. I did use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I had to use stick margarine because I used the last of the butter on the batch I had to throw away. They were still awesome. I will use this recipe from now on.

Yummmmmmmm! So, easy to mix in one bowl.  I used coconut oil instead of butter (making the brownies dairy free).  Coconut oil is such a healthy alternative for butter and they turned out even better than when I have used butter! I, too, used less sugar. I liked this recipe so much, and it was so easy, that I removed all of my brownie recipes from my recipe box and this is now my "go to" brownie.

Despite the rave reviews, this recipe does not quite work. There is too much butter and sugar in there, which gives the brownies a caramel like shell and a mushy inside. Even after 40 minutes in the oven, they were still not quite done and we ended up eating them slightly undercooked. 

I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup, but I should have cut it by a whole cup. They were disgustingly sweet! I shudder to think what the taste and texture would have been like with three whole cups of sugar.

I'll revert to my old favourite, the 'Deep Dish Brownies' from this site, which are amazing by the way.

Living in Peru, I can't get good boxed brownies (which I tend to prefer). This is the closest thing I have found to Giardelli boxed brownies. Thanks for the recipe!

Ummm, YUM!!! BIG hit in our house! I did decrease the sugar per other reviewers and use both brown and white (1 1/2c brown & 3/4 white).  The first time I made these I used milk chocolate chips since I had a bag I needed to finish up; they were good but had a slightly different taste that even my hubby picked up right away.  The next time I made them, I used the semi-sweet and WOW! SO GOOD! I do melt my chips in the butter because I don't like chunks of chocolate in my brownies (weird, I know).

These brownies are beautiful! Chewy and oh so chocolatey.  I don't know why people thought they were not thick enough...with 4 eggs, if beaten properly and long enough the volume of the mixture doubles and continues to rise when baked.  They were a good 2" thick.  I made 2 minimal changes, and that was to use 2 1/4 cups of sugar instead of 3 - 1/2 white 1/2 brown.  This is because I just don't like brownies too sweet.  the other change was I used a chopped up bar of Trade Joes dark chocolate instead of the chips because that's all I had at home.  A fabulous recipe - Thanks for sharing it.  it will definitely become the brownie recipe we use in this house!!

I feel the cocoa powder was too overpowering.  I will try 1/2 c butter, melted, 1 c brown sugar and 1 cup regular sugar, 3 eggs and 1/2 cup cocoa powder.
I want to experiment and cut down on sugar and butter.  Also, to see if it isn't as cocoa powdery.  Just my preference.

Delicious, but the toothpick never came out clean and the cooled brownies were rock hard.  the next time i only cooked it for 45 minutes, regardless of the toothpick test, and it was great!

These brownies were HEAVENLY!!!! I wanted a fudge like texture and these are exactly that.  They are so thick and soft. They will not last long in my house. I also loved how the recipe was written for using a 9x13 pan. If you are looking for a chocolate fix, these will definitely hit the spot!!! Simply DELICIOUS!!!

First time making homemade brownies, and boy did they look good! They were great, soft and chewy and I cut a couple in half (sandwich style) and put ice cream in the middle... YUM! I followed the recipes to a tee, and cooked for 40 minutes. Only thing was these weren't as sweet as the brownies I'm used to, I think I'll try using some brown sugar as others suggested next time!

These really are the best bombshell brownies!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to do 2 cups white sugar + 1 cup brown sugar.  They had a crispy crust, but were fudgey on the inside.

Delicious! I used half dark cocoa powder and half regular—the brownies are incredibly dark and chocolaty. I used a slightly smaller dish (8.5 x 11.5) so I had to bake about 10 minutes longer. These are so fudgy and chocolaty! I think this will be my go-to brownie recipe now.

Best Brownies ever!  So easy to make and turned out great.  My kids couldn't get enough and my husband raved about them.  Agree with other user's that you need to cook them a little longer than suggested as they are pretty thick.

These were very good brownies! I loved them! I just found the chocolate very overpowering. I love chocolate, but these were super chocolatey. Easy to make, not a big mess.

My family just loved these, I followed the exact recipe this time, other then beating the eggs, sugar and butter for about 8 minutes only because I forgot I had turned the mixer on!  Thanks for sharing!

Thick and Delicious! These brownies come out fudgey and oh-so-good. I added a little peppermint extra for mint chocolate brownies. Also going to try with marshmallows and walnuts. Mmmm!

Excellent... when I tried the batter I thought to myself if the brownies come out tasting as great as the batter.... and they did. Definitely not a disappointment with this one. This was my first time making brownies from scratch and for now on, I will never make from a box again. I also substituted the sugar for Splenda and it was great!!!!

These are the closest to box brownies (but really good ones) that I've tried, and I've tried quite a few recipes on this site.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding 1 t. of baking soda for a crisp, thin layer on top -- the brownie signature.  Great recipe!

My family was having a craving for some brownies and I didn't have the stand by box brownies, so I made these.  I followed the recipe exactly in  a 9X13 and they came out perfectly!  I can't imagine them in a smaller pan, they are so sweet and dense as is.  They must be served with a gallon of milk or vanilla ice cream! :)

I wasn't sure about following the recipe with no changes based on the reviews but I went ahead and followed the recipe as written. The brownies are FABULOUS!!!! I did let the eggs come to room temperature and I beat each egg before adding them to the sugar. I am not a brownie fan but my husband is that is why I decided to make these. I have finally eaten a "true" brownie and understand the addiction. I don't know if I should thank or curse Brooke.

Insanely good!  I added peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  They are moist & full of flavor.  I can't walk by them without stopping.  They may be my undoing, but it will be worth it!

Did as others, 1 2/3 c sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, and no chocolate chips.  Found them to be the right amount of sweetness and fudgyness.  Baked in an 8 by 8" square pan so brownies would be thicker.  Increased cooking time.  Covered towards the end so they wouldn't get too brown.

It's way too sweet for my taste. I even decreased the sugar to 2 3/4 cup. It hurt my teeth biting it. I had already suspected it, therefore I didn't put the full amount of sugar. Probably 2 to 2 1/2 cup of sugar would be enough. I noticed the recipe doesn't call for baking soda either. However, I followed the recipe exactly, except the amount of sugar. I don't want to rate a recipe based on changing things here and there, that's not fair. My husband, on the other hand, loved it. He said it was really good, and not too sweet at all. So if you love everything extremely sweet, this recipe is for you. If not, I recommend you try Best Brownies recipe. So far, that's the perfect one for me.

These were just okay.  The brownies were so overpowered by the sweetness of them, that I actually felt they lost some of the true chocolate brownie flavor to them.  I did not add chocolate chips into them, but I could only imagine how rich and sweet they would be if I did so considering how sugary they already were.  They do have a very fudgy consistency to them, which I like over cakey brownies, but that's about all they had going for them.  Other than not adding the chocolate chips, the only thing I changed was substituting 1/2 c. of apple sauce for 1/2 of the butter.  Everything turned out the way it was supposed to, I just didn't care for them.  Will definitely find a new recipe next time.

Great recipe I used 1 2/3c sugar and 1c dark brown sugar.  Also added tbs of instant expresso.  The results were yummy!  Great texture, taste and thickness.  I did use a 10x10 pan for these.

This were great! The only change I made was to use 1.5 cups white sugar and 1.5 cups brown. And I mixed it all by hand. I had to bake it for about 37 mins for the middle to get done and by then the edges were a little overdone and hard, but besides that, the rest of the pan was simply fantastic --rich, chewy, fudgy, decadent -everything a great brownie should be! Thanks for sharing the recipe, will definitely be making it again and again!

FINALLY! The chewy, fudgey, chocolatey brownie that I have been searching for.  I halved the recipe.  Baked it in a 11 X 7 mini cake pan.  Did substitute light brown sugar for 1/3 of the sugar that was called for, used white sugar for the rest.  Used white patent flour (was all out of all-purpose). Made 12 good sized brownies about 3/4 of an inch thick that are the perfect consistency (not cakey and not too dense).  Stirred all ingredients by hand. Super simple to do and easy clean up. My fiance said that they may be the best brownies he's ever had (and he never was a huge brownie fan although I love him in spite of that).

Very good, but very rich.  These were my first attempt at brownies from scratch and they couldn't be easier and tasted better than boxed.  These would be great with other kinds of chips (peanut butter, caramel.....).  One nice thing about this recipe is the unsweetened cocoa makes for not very good tasting batter which is good for people like me who eat more of the batter than they put in the pan.  You won't eat the batter but you'll love the brownie.

This is a GREAT chocolaty recipe!  Very sweet and brownish!  This wasn't a Cake like brownie recipe (which I love) it was more of that fudgy type center.  Guaranteed to be gobbled up quickly!

Excellent Brownies! Chewy and chocolate-y. I overcooked them slightly because my toothpick didn't come out clean even at 45 mins. I think next time I'll do 40 mins and not worry about the toothpick test. 30 seconds in the microwave for the butter was perfect. I ran out of butter last time and substituted the rest with yogurt (had vanilla yogurt on hand) and used half whole wheat flour and they tasted great.  Going to make them for a school bake sale now, exactly as the recipe calls, I'm confident they will turn out super! Thanks Brooke!

Making this recipe was beautifully simple. As always I melted the butter over the stove, half with direct heat, then take it off and let the rest melt from the residual heat. The batter came together without a flaw, and for once I followed it to a T.  I had to cut this recipe in half since there's no way I could give away 24 servings. So I tried baking a half-recipe in an 8*8 pan, and that leaves the question of how long I should bake them for. Since my oven runs hot I tried 25 min and it was still hot. After 32 they seemed to pass the toothpick test, but when I cut into some of them the test had lied. So I put them in for 36 and they were much crunchier than I liked, but delicious nevertheless.   Next time: If you insist on cutting the recipe in half then put them in the oven for 34 minutes exactly, then let them sit for 5 minutes. Then cut.  So wonderful.

Really great brownies. However, we couldn't eat them all in one day and they hardened really quickly. I recommend storing them in an airtight container if you actually have any leftovers.

These are quite possibly the best brownies I've ever had.  I used half white and half brown sugar and milk chocolate chips.  They are so good that I've been eating them for breakfast!  Probably not the most nutritionally sound practice, but I can't stay away from them.

This recipe was okay, but not great.  They had a nice chewy sort of texture, but the flavor was just a little off.  Not sure why exactly.  With all of the butter in this recipe I don't think I will be wasting the ingredients playing around with this particular recipe trying to perfect it.

WOW!!!!!!!!  These brownies are insane!!  In my version,  I didnt add the chocolate chips due to the amount of sugar and the possiblity of it being too sweet.  I was right.  The sweetness was right on, along with chewiness and texture.  This will be my permanent brownie recipe.  Thank you!!

These are very good, but they are SO sweet I couldn't have more than a one inch piece and needed a glass of milk to wash the chocolate down. Worth making once in awhile when you have a severe craving for chocolate. Otherwise, I need a brownie recipe that I can handle a little better. Worth trying out to see if you like them!

I think these brownies were amazing, even though they were a bit hard the next day. It may be because I have a major sweet tooth, but I didn't think they were too sweet, and enjoyed the cocoa flavor. To all those people who didn't like this, generally 9*13 pans are generally glass. If you use a stoneware pan, it is going to turn out burnt the sides and raw in the middle.

10 stars!! These are WONDERFUL! The recipe is perfect the way it's written I'm sure. The only change I HAD to make was that I ran out of white sugar at 1.8 cups, so I had to use brown sugar for the remainer to make 3c total. I had Exactly enough to make the 3c between the two sugars and no more-haha I took that as a "sign" that they'd be great- They were amazing- best brownies I've ever had. And my name is Brooke so I just had to make them for that reason too. lol  OH, I also made 12 mini bite size brownies with my Wilton mini muffin pan and the remainder was in an 8x11 so they'd be a little thicker then-Great size and bite size is always fun. (The small ones hardened over night, so next time I'll under-bake a bit with my mini muffin pan)

By far the best brownies EVER! I suggest using 60% cacao chips instead of semi-sweet, gives a slight bitter for those who think it is overly sweet. Get your glass of milk ready :)

The way to bake brownies and not get the crispy hard edges and undercooked middle is the cook them at a lower temperature for a longer time. I did mine at 325* for 50 minutes and the texture was good. As for the flavour, these were only ok for us. The recipe has WAAAY too much sugar in it! The flavour was more fudge than it was chocolate ~ and I even added 2 squares of melted unsweetened chocolate to try to fix that. 1 star for the recipe as written, 3 with my added chocolate. I might try again reducing sugar to only 2 cups. Update: my brownies got hard the next day too. It is due to the amount of sugar in the recipe. Not good.

These are the absolute best and everyone of my friends agree. I cut 1/2 the sugar with brown sugar and double the vanilla.  I add 1/2 C peanut butter chips, 1/2 C pecans, 1/2 C Heath bar bits and sometimes the chocolate chips that the recipe calls for.  Simply amazing.  Other than these additions and changes, I stick with the recipe.

i have these in the oven as i'm typing this.  they smell delicious!  i have high hopes for these brownies... i'm taking them to a picnic.  will report back to rate them! p.s. i followed the recipe EXACTLY.

UPDATE>  this recipe has officially been upgraded to my go-to brownie recipe... these are DEEEEEELISH!  they are best the day they are baked though... they just don't taste near as good the following days (even after being stored in airtight containers) so eat 'em when you make 'em!

Brooke, THANK YOU for putting this recipe on here. I finally found a good one! I did adjust the servings to make 18 (instead of 24 servings) and made it in a 9x9 pan. It was perfect. And I did follow the other reviews and used half white & half brown sugar. Thank you!!

These are so good, and so simple to make, why by the boxed when this is so easy and way better. I used this recipe in cupcake batter + brownie batter = the second best cupcake ever, and they were great! I have made this recipe several times since my initial review. I decided tonight to sub part of the white sugar with brown sugar, big mistake, they weren't anywhere near as good. Lesson learned, don't mess with perfection!

Recipe as is, not the best in my opinion, 3 cups of sugar is way to much and I cut it to 2 and still way to sweet.  I made the brownies all in one bowl without any fussing with separating the ingredients and they came out great with the exception of the sweetness.   I made them with oil, and put two TBLS of water like you would with a brownie mix package.

awesome recipe next to Best Brownies from this websites. These are now my two favourites right now. The reason I give it 4 star is it went real dry the next day. I halved the recipe to 4 serving by the way.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but these were not very good.  :(  This was my first try at homemade brownies, and I found them pretty bitter.  I followed the directions to a T, and only used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  They tasted like dark chocolate, which if you're in to it would have been fantastic, but I'll be sticking to the box variety from here on out.

I was actually not that impressed with these.  I followed the recipe exactly and used good quality cocoa and choc chips, but the predominant flavor was just "sweet".  With the high ratings on this recipe, maybe that's just what most people like. The texture was good, but the taste was below average.  If you're going to take the time to bake from scratch, it's gotta be better than a box mix.  These just were not.

Excellent recipe! I cut it in half and baked it in a 9X9 inch pan because that is the only size I have and it turned out perfectly. I forgot to include the chocolate chips but they still tasted great! I will definitely include the chocolate chips next time to make them even more chocolatey and rich.

OH WOW!  I thought I would never find a recipe for homemade brownies that I'd actually love.  These are fantastic!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 and 1/2 cups of both white and brown sugar, but otherwise I kept things exactly as they were.  Fudgy, moist, and absolutely delicious!  These are winners, for sure!

Very thick and heavy. Sits in your stomach like a rock. I used a 9x13 pan. Maybe if I used a bigger pan so it was thinner it would have been better. I'll never know because I won't make again. Nobody would eat them. :(

These taste nice, but mine were not fudgy and were very crispy, not sure if it was because I divided ingredients to give a smaller yield

If you are looking for cake-like brownies, this is not the recipe for you. If you are having a chocolate emergency and need fudgy goodness, look no further.  I followed the recipe exactly and these are truly the bomb!  These brownies are very rich and chocolaty with a crispy top crust.  I will not be using another brownie recipe.  I think that next time I will add nuts because my family loves nuts in everything, other than that I will not be changing anything about this recipe.

This is the first time I've ever made brownies and I was scared when I saw how much sugar the recipe called for. Decided to go for it. The results were outstanding, I can't believe how great these brownies taste. Crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside, very rich and chocolatey. Won't try any other recipe, there's no point, coz' this one's PERFECT

These are by far THE best brownies I have ever tasted. I did change the sugar to 1 1/2 c. white sugar and 1 1/2 c. brown sugar. I have made them about 8 times in the last 3 months and have gotten rave reviews each time.

These were almost sickly sweet for me.  They really hurt my teeth and gave me a headache.  My fiance, on the other hand, thought they were amazing and ate almost all of them, thus I didn't feel like i'd have to.  I guess I can thank the gods of caloric intake for that positive outcome.

OMG!! These are AWESOME!! I ended up baking them for around 45 minutes..but remember they have chocolate chips in them, when you check to see if they are done (you might get a chocolate chip, and think they aren't done yet) ..Also, be sure to use your mixer when adding the eggs....these don't have baking powder in them, and you need to beat a little air in the eggs..that's what gets them thick, and chewy, then stir in the flour mixture....SO GOOD!! Twice as thick as box mix brownies, and chewy! YUMM!!!

I used a 9x13 pan and baked for the recommended 35 minutes. Checked it with a toothpick and it came out a little wet. (Remember this recipe does have chocolate chips so you may end up stabbing through a melted chip.) I took it out and let it cool for 10 minutes.  Then cut them into pieces. It was still warm. The edges were done and crunchy; the centers were ooey and gooey. Be cautious when removing from pan after baking; they are soft and crumble.   The next morning, the brownies were firm but centers will still chewy. Cut your portions and use a spatula to avoid it from crumbling. Brownies are just as good the day after as they are warm from oven.

Took about 45 minutes in my glass 13x9 pan. These came out very rich. I might like them a little thicker, but there certainly weren't any complaints.

Pretty good recipe. Crunchy on the outside, fudgey on the inside, but they took forever to bake, which was annoying so for that reason, I'll probably stick the "best brownies" recipe by angie on this site. Oh and I frosted them with a peanut butter frosting recipe from this site and it made them taste that much better!

The first time I made this recipe, I followed it exactly. Wow, they were to die for. The batch I made lasted an hour. The next time I made them, I wanted a slightly different flavor so I switched the Vanilla for Rum flavored extract. Still amazing although I do need to find the right amount of rum extract for my tastes. The next time I made them, I used mint chocolate chips. Still amazing. This is my favorite brownie recipe so far.

These brownies are amazing! I did follow the recipe exact the first time and they were a bit on the sweet side for me. Still amazing though. The next batch I changed to half white and half brown sugar and it took it to a whole other level. Deeper in flavor. My Hubby loves it so much!! Thank u. A keeper!

OMG best brownie I have ever had!!! My hubby is a brownie addict so I was worried he might not be impressed but boy was I wrong! he could not stop eating them! They are a mix between fudge and brownie in one...i followed the direction exactly and they were so simple to make and they baked for 30 min and came out perfect..I will be making these brownies for the rest of my life!

Fantastic! Honestly by far the best brownies I've ever made. I've made these three times now. Once with white sugar (my boyfriends favourite, tasted just like a perfectly chewy traditional brownie), once with brown sugar (my favourite, had a hint of caramel flavour), and once replacing the eggs with milk and oil (BAD idea! Never again...it turned into chocolately soup...but that's what I get for trying to make brownies without eggs). Just so you know, when made with just brown sugar, these brownies are really difficult to cut and make look nice. If you're making them and want a nice presentation, I would suggest sticking to just white sugar as the recipe calls for. The only modifications I made were to add more chocolate chips. I used one bag milk chocolate and one bag white chocolate chips each time I made them. Next time, I'm going to try to making them Rocky Road style and add peanuts and marshmallows on top.

* * * * Sooo good.  Followed the directions exactly.  No need to vary.  I took the brownies out of the oven at the exact time stated and let them cool.  They were perfect.  Very rich and chewy.  The top is crunchy and the inside just a perfect amount of soft.  Really good recipe.

I made a batch of these for my dad's birthday...they didn't last long at all-only about 14 people had come, and we only had a few squares left!  The eggs really make these, the fudgey-ness is what keeps my family asking me to make them!

These are just how a brownie is supposed to be: dense, chocolatey, chewy. They are wonderful with vanilla ice cream. Very very rich. If you want them less 'cakey' omit one of the eggs. Very easy to make too.

I made this recipe at least three times before I decided to write a review. This recipe was so delicious but I had my own modifications, I originally halfed the recipe: I mixed 1/4 cup butter and olive oil to ensure moisture. 1 1/2 cups of organic cane sugar 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract (not good with imitation) 2 cage free veggie fed eggs 3/4 cup whole wheat flour 1/2 cup hersheys cocoa powder 1/2 tsp celtic sea salt 1/2 cup natural chocolate chips  This recipe was so delicious my sister and I loved it and she rarely likes to try new recipes that I make! Next time Im gonna try adding white chocolate chunks!

Well, these brownies came out almost hard as a rock!  I substituted 1/2 tsp baking soda for half of the salt as a reviewer suggested, and next time I'll skip that.  They are also VERY rick so I guess it depends on your taste.  Still, we ate them all :)

I was hungry for brownies, but it's just my husband and I and a full batch would have been too much for us, so I halved this recipe and made it in a 9x9" pan.  It halved very nicely and the result is a pretty thick, rich brownie.  I melted the chocolate chips with the butter, since I don't like hard little bits of anything (nuts or chocolate) in my soft, chewy brownie.  I also used 1/2c brown sugar and 3/4c white sugar.  They just came out of the oven about half an hour ago, and are still quite warm and good, but I'm betting the flavor will be even better once they cool and the flavors have time to meld a bit.

These brownies deserve their name! They are amazing. Moist, fudgy, super-chocolatey, and melt-in-your-mouth. They are also made with stuff you keep on hand, so they whip up easy and quick when you need to impress.

Too much sugar! Ok, I made my 1st batch based on the reviews of 1/2 and 1/2 white mixed with brown sugar.  Out of curiosity, I made a 2nd batch the next day (being that the 1st ones where gone) but this time I went exactly by the instructions of 3 cups of white sugar...oh goodness, it was like i made a sugar bar.  I had to trash them because the sugar was overwhelmingly too much!  This is a great recipe, but follow the advice of everyone else and use less white sugar, (also it would't hurt to use a little more flour (2 cups instead of 1 1/2))  Otherwise, these are some great brownies. Good Luck!

easy. fudgy. yum. I had everything on hand, and it totally met my fudgy requirement -- this is for sure going down on my fancy recipe card to keep on hand to knock out any brownie cravings I have in the future!  (Sidenote: I halved the recipe, except I used only 1 tsp vanilla and Andes mint baking chunks to make these a little different; this batch made 24 mini brownie "cakes" (think brownie bites), after baking maybe 17-20 mins, somewhere in there?) Great recipe!

I made this recipe as it is written and the brownies came out amazing!  The inside was very fudgy and there was a disagreement in my family as to whether they were baked enough.  I loved them soft in the middle but my husband thought they needed to be baked a little longer.  I made them a second time and baked them 5 minutes more and these came out more set, but I loved them both ways.  They did not last more than a day in my kitchen!

I used the 9x13 pan and thought it was fine. Any smaller of a pan like a 9x9 and the brownies would be so thick and really goey. I lean more towards the cake brownie rathern than the fudge brownie. I agree that it was a good brownie but way too sweet for my taste. Perhaps 1/2 to a cup less sugar would do it. Other than that I will make a gain and try to use the self rising flour and see how much bigger they will get.. Love the crust and the middle wasnt goey. Way to go brooke

I made these just as the recipe calls except that I used white chocolate chips. The brownies are delicious and very easy.  Good for beginners. Do not overcook or the edges will become crunchy.

These were fantastic! They had a great chewy texture. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar and substituted orange-flavoured dark chocolate (Green and Black's Maya Gold) chopped into small pieces for the chocolate chips, which worked really well.

These are the ultimate brownie for someone wanting that perfect chewy, fudgy, dense brownie. I followed the recipe exactly except that I left out the chocolate chips since I am not a fan of morsels in my brownies. I made two batches. I cooked the first according to the recipe and they turned out great, except that I agree if you leave the brownies out uncovered overnight the edges will harden a bit. I think this is common sense though... Just cover them, or reheat and they are just as delicious as fresh out of the oven. I cooked the second batch a little less time than the first and in my opinion they turned out even better. If you take them out right before the middle is done, then once they cool they are absolutely fabulous! This is the best recipe I have found. It is very sweet though, so if you're looking for a light and caky brownie, this recipe is not for you.

Too much sugar.  If I made these again I would cut back the sugar and add more chips - the bites with the chips in them were the best but not every bite had chips.

I'd really give this recipe 3.5 stars.  These brownies were pretty good straight from the oven, though they are EXTREMELY sweet.  I chose to keep the amount of sugar (against my better judgement) based on other reviews, but would reduce it if I made these again.  The only thing keeping me from doing this is the fact that the day after they were absolutely nothing like the yummy brownies I took from the oven the night before.  They hardened very quickly, and seeing as we don't eat a whole tray/pan in one sitting....kind of a big deal.

A disapointment considering the reviews. 9X13 pan is too large for this recipe...my brownies turned out thin although the flavour was good. I prefer a thicker more dense brownie. I won't make this one again although it was a very easy recipe.

These are good.  Very Sweet took much longer to bake then stated but if you are patient they will be cooked and not burned or dried out.

Yummy! My DH and I prepared these spur-of-the-moment last night. We halved the recipe, and baked it in a 9x9 pan for 35 minutes. We didn't have any chocolate chips on hand, but the brownies were still absolutely delicious! So chewy and rich! Also, instead of sifting, we whisked for a brief minute or two. I will definitely make these again. No more boxed brownies!! Super easy, sooooo yummy! Thank you!

Made these twice in two days!  First time as directed and second time substituting 1 cup dark brown sugar for one of the cups of white sugar.  I think the second batch was better, but both were delish.  Also used combo of peanut butter chips and chocolate chips in the second batch.  Yummy!

Thanks for the great recipe! I followed the advice of a few of the reviewers who suggested adding half brown sugar and half white sugar instead of 3 full cups of white sugar, however next time I will try it the original way. I think both will be delicious! Very moist and fudgy!!!

I have been thinking about trying these and I am so glad that I did. These are truly exceptional! I accidentally left out the vanilla and they were still amazing. I used 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate chips. I know it has been said before, but why use a box mix when this is so easy and delicious!

Great brownies! Easy to make and tasted fantastic.  I did use 1 c of brown sugar and 2 c of white sugar, that was the only change to the recipe.  A great go to recipe that you can make with the ingredients in your pantry.

I was a little skeptical about these brownies, even with all of the great reviews.  I wasn't sure if they would be rich enough, because I loooove rich food.  These are perfect for any person who really, really loves a dense rich chocolate brownie.  I used dark cocoa powder instead of regular, a whole bag of chips, and about a cup of pecans.  My husband said these are the best brownies I've made in the 18 years we've been together.  The kids loved them, too!

I took CookinginFL's advice and whisked the dry ingredients together and it worked beautifully. The first time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly and the turned out perfectly fudgey and delicious. The second time I made them, I experimented a bit.....I was trying to make the brownies a bit more healthy since I could not control myself around the first batch. So I replaced 1/2 of the butter with lowfat organic yogurt, and reduced the sugar to 2 cups. I also used a 6 ounce bar of baker's semisweet chocolate finely chopped instead of the chips. I honestly cannot tell that these brownies are lower in fat than my first batch. In fact, I think they are even better! Just be sure to only bake these....no matter how you make them....for 30 minutes. Then stick them in the fridge for 30 minutes before cutting them. This ensures the fudgiest texture! A++!

These brownies came out very cake-like, despite other reviews. If you really want fudgy, rich brownies, you have to use real chocolate. I was out, so tried these in a pinch, and was a little disappointed.

I usually guy  ghirardelli brownies in the box, which I think are the best boxed brownies. I figured I would try my first attempt at making brownies from scratch. These brownies are awesome. I would compare them to the ghiradelli which is a compliment. I did however do have white sugar and half brown sugar lik others. My kids were arguing over the last pieces. Will definately make again.

You must try these brownies. I rarely make a recipe more than once in a short period of time and I've made these twice in the past week, they're so good. And here are a couple of changes I made to make them healthier: I substituted 1/2 c of Fat Free Greek Yogurt (Vanilla flavored) for 1/2 c of butter. I added the yogurt after I mixed the remaining 1/2 c of butter with the sugars and the vanilla to get the right texture first. I used 1.5 cups of white sugar and 1 c of brown sugar (so 1/2 c less than the recipe calls for) And beyond that - I followed the recipe and made sure to not over bake. THEY ARE VERY GOOD - and I'm a homemade-brownie critic. These will be chocolatey and fudgey and with the adjustments, healthier indulgences that don't taste like reduced fat! Enjoy!

These are the BEST!! radawesome and super delicious, delectable, scrumptious brownies = BROOKE'S BEST BOMBSHELL BROWNIES I did use half brown and half white suger.  I also beat the sugar, butter, vanilla extract, and eggs for 10 minutes in my stand mixer to create the crunchy top on the brownies.  After I mixed in all the dry ingredients + chopped dark chocolate, I popped them into a 9x13 glass baking dish.  I was so lazy that I didn't grease it, but anyways.. after 35 minutes, they came out of the oven.  They are fudgy and oh so chocolatey.  At first, I thought 3 cups of sugar was a lot, but after I tried one, it tasted just spectacular.  My cousins and I devoured them with vanilla ice cream on top and homeade caramel sauce.  :P Just the night before, we had blondies, vanilla ice cream, and a maple-butter sauce with walnuts!  LOL I will always use Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies nowadays (goodbye to the Best Brownies recipe on this site hahahaha).  Thanks Brooke, you are the greatest!!!

Awesome, awesome recipe. The only change I made was to add crumbled peppermint bark and dark chocolate, marshmallows and chopped pecans to the top while still hot. My friend Michelle said they are so rich she feels like "she should go to confession afterwards"...LOL. Great job on this one, Brooke!

I made these a while ago and had bad results. I was determined to get a good batch of brownies out of this recipe.  After reading all the reviews I couldnt understand why mines came out all wrong.  This time around I followed the recipe and cut the sugar back by half a cup.  They coooked in 40 minutes.  I poked them in two places to make sure they were done.  They are wonderful, warm with ice cream on top.  Thanks Brooke

These are scrumptious!   For variation I bet peanut butter morsels,in lieu of the semi-sweet chocolate morsels would be good.

YUM!! I didn't think I could find a brownie that was as good as the boxed ones we've always used.  These are just as good if not better, and I love how simple they are to make and they don't have all the artificial ingredients!

OMG! these were awesome!  made 2 batches, one with walnuts for my family.  Made a batch for Thanksgiving.  My adult niece said that she could just  live on these brownies!  I cut into squares and froze in 4 square portions but my husband ate it all in one sitting. Just as good when defrosted.  Just used about 1/3 cup less sugar.

WOW WOW WOW!  These are THE BEST brownies I've ever made!  And oh so easy to make!  I had to bake approx 60 minutes until the toothpick came out *semi* clear.  These brownies have a gooie center, and crispie shell.  And if you're like me and think the sides are the BEST part, well, this brownie is PERFECT for YOU!  They are great for topping with ice cream!  These would also be great with peanut butter chips instead of the semisweet chocolate chips.  Thanks, Brooke!  I'm keeping this recipe!  :-)

I've tried many different recipes that claim to produce a chewy brownie but they've always turned out more like cake. THIS is definitely a CHEWY brownie! I halved the recipe for my 9x9 inch pan and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. They were delicious! Thank you so much for this fantastic recipe :D

I've tried this recipe twice and both times, I ended up needing a chisel to get these out of the baking dish. The side and the bottom are a weird consistency- hard, but still malleable. Like a Tootsie Roll. Maybe it's something I did wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly and had the same bad results both times.

Amazing brownies! I have used brownie mixes for years because I'd never found a recipe that was better than a good mix. After making these today I'll never use a mix again. Followed the recipe except for using reviewers suggestion to mix sugars half white and half brown. Also, when baking wedding cakes I always use Dutch processed cocoa. It's darker and the chocolate cake comes out with a bit more bittersweet flavor. It worked wonderfully in the brownies. Just awesome brownies, can't wait to make them again!

i was afraid to make these at first because i had a dinner party to bake for and it seemed like a bad time to try a new recipe. but after all the stellar reviews, i caved. boy, am i glad i did! these were intensely good! i made a few small changes. i added a bit less than a tbsp. of instant coffee, used milk chocolate chips to offset the dark chocolatey flavor, subtracted a 1/4 a cup of sugar from the 3 that were called for, and used a half cup of light brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar. they came out flawless. these perfect, fudgey squares restored my faith in the homemade brownie.

These brownies "seduced" me!  The BEST brownie I have ever had.  Perfect brownie texture, not dry at all and just gooey enough.  Packs an awesome chocolate punch (I used dutch processed cocoa)!  After reading other reviews I subbed 1 c of brown sugar (with 1 1/2 c white sugar) and I added 1 t baking powder and 1/2 t baking soda to the flour mixture. These come together fairly fast and easy.  I will NEVER make a box mix again!

I went along with other suggestions and used half brown sugar, half white.  I also cooked them for 25 minutes.  These brownies tasted good but were extremely dry (crumbled when we cut them).  My son suggested using a 9x9 instead of the 13x9 so we will try it that way next time.

I have made these twice, the first time I used all white sugar, the second 1/2 brown and 1/2 white. My husband liked the 1/2 and 1/2 better, the flavor was a bit richer. Either way these are the chewiest most decadent brownies ever, and the top is fantastic!

DA BOMB!!  These quench any sweet tooth ... plus cause some major cavities!  Made as written and baked for 40 minutes in 13x9 pan.  At first I thought they were undercooked, but after cooling they were fudgey.  These are twice a good a day later.

These were SOOO good! I made it as is, except for 1 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 1/2 cup white.   Next time I'm thinking of trying them with white chocolate chips for some contrast.

AMAZING! I was craving brownies but had no mix and found this recipe, everyone in the house loved them!!! I tried the substitution with the brown sugar and found it made them taste a little more like bitter chocolate. Definitely follow the recipe with white sugar, it makes them so sweet and rich! I also had a butter substitute on hand when making these once before and they did not turn out as well either, use REAL BUTTER!

I don't know what these taste like yet, but the batter was delicious :D and my house is filled with a yummy chocolate smell! mmmm... (later) wow, so chocolatey and moist-will definitely make again, I cut the sugar to 2.5 cups, probably will cut it again to 2 cups, a little too sweet, but still delicious.

For my boyfriend's birthday, I wanted to make him a double layer round cake made w brownie batter.  This recipe was PERFECT!  Instead of a heavy frosting I used chocolate coolwhip between the two layers and on the outside.  I used a butter knife to loosen them from the pan and then flipped them over to remove- don't wait too long because they won't come out- I did that once and half the brownie stayed in the pan = ( He said it was the best birthday cake ever- better even than last year's Guiness Chocolate Stout cake (which was awesome)!

Don't get me wrong, this is a very good fudgy brownie recipe. However, I have been searching for a homemade brownie recipe that meets or exceeds the boxed version. For me this wasn't it, will continue my quest though.

Pretty good, I used caramel bits instead of chocolate chips. The brownie itself tasted just a touch grainy, but I'll take that over gooey. Probably going to be my go-to brownie recipe.

These are fantastic and I'd recommend this recipe to anybody who loves chocolate!  They are quite sweet but then a little goes a long way!  I cut my pan into 1.5 x 1.5 inch squares and 1 square with milk is a perfect treat.   FYI:  I made the recipe exactly as listed with no substitutions, additions, etc.  Perfect!

Very easy and good.  I, too, did not put in as much sugar (2 1/4 cups- 1 of them Brown). Turned out yummy.

Wonderful!!!  I used 2 boxes brownie mix and modified to follow the recipe by adding 1/2 c. sugar, 1 t. vanilla, 1 c. butter, 4 eggs, 1 c. choc. chips, and about 1/2 c. warm water.  They were the best, fudgy moist but crispy edged brownies I've ever made.  Thank you.

These were soooo good! I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1 1/2 brown sugar. I also used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips. We all LOVED them!!!!

SO good - only used 3 eggs, substituted one cup of the white sugar with brown sugar, and put some chopped up frozen peanut butter cups on top that I had left over from another recipe. SO SO good - didn't last long!

These definitely are restaurant quality brownies.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the chocolate chips, which I do not care for.  I only made half a recipe and it turned out superb.

Family loved them. i only added 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, turned out perfect. I also swirled some peanut butter on top of batter and added some chocolate chips on top, as well. I also added walnuts on 1/2 the batter. (I don't particulary care for walnuts) My husband and kids loved it. Old fashioned taste, did not taste like anything from a box. Came out thick. Everyone could only eat one, very dense. First time I had leftovers. Made 12 good size brownies.

i used   - 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar - milk chocolate morsels  - 7 X 11 in pan (only because i ran out of white sugar and semi-sweet morsels)  and these are the absolute best brownies i have tried. they freeze beautifully as well. Defrost for 1 min on microwave power 5. thanks so much for this recipe, Brooke. My family LOVED them.

very good brownies, rich and chocolatey as they come; mixed brown sugar and white, and wondered about missing nuts, 'cause I somewhat expected pecans or so to be a must. I was afraid they would be nauseatingly sweet, it was not so but I still think 3 cups of sugar is quite a big amount, thou. I had to bake for 30 minutes because the wooden stick was wet after 22 mins, but maybe I should have taken them out of the oven all the same, as I think the crust is a bit dry. These are the reasons why some great brownies took 4 stars and not 5...

Baked for 34 minutes, and they came out a little dry.  Will test them a bit earlier next time.  Absolutely decadent and awesome chocolate flavor, though!  I couldn't stop eating the edges as I was cutting them to bring in to work!

Great brownie...followed others suggestion of spliting the sugar with some brown sugar. I did put them in my 9x13 pyrex and baked them about 30 minutes and they were perfect. My mother in law who normally passes on dessert had 2 pieces herself! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I loveee these brownies!!! I always add a teaspoon of coffee to the batter to try to be more "gourmet". Yum. I think they taste best cold from the fridge.

I'm extremely picky about brownies and I have tried tons of recipes and none of them ever hit the spot - til now! They were perfect! Soft and moist and thick but not cake-like. Definitely keeping this as my favorite brownie recipe! I'm actually about to ship some to a friend that lives a couple states away so she can have this decadent experience.  LOVE IT. TYSM.

I've made two double batches of these brownies.  The first was awesome!  The next week I made them again, and the first pan (which cooked about 37 min. and I forgot to cool on the rack) was perfect.  The second pan (which cooked for 35 min. and did cool on a rack) was not nearly done enough.  I brought them to work before I cut them, and was embarrassed when they were raw in the middle.  Those extra few minutes of baking make all the difference!

OMG these brownies are absolutely LETHAL!  I have made them three times and everyone always wants the recipe.  Needless to say, there are never any leftovers.  I have made them with semisweet chips, milk chocolate chips, and vanilla chips and they turn out excellent every time.  I actually think I could eat the whole bowl of raw batter if I wasn't afraid of getting sick.  Try these...they are awesome!  I make them in a 10x15 pan and cook at 350 degrees for 40 minutes and they are perfect!

The author is right, these are definitely an ultra intense treat!  But I would say that's an understatement!  These are so over the top intense and rich that they can really only be eaten in VERY small amounts (I'm a chocoholic, and I love dark chocolate, sweets, etc. and I could only handle about a 2-tbsp serving size!).  This was, amazingly enough, wayyyyyyyy too rich for me.  And it wasn't very brownie-ish in texture - almost like not very dense fudge?  I hate to say it, but as far as comfort food, and satisfying chocolate cravings, this was too much.

These are delicious !  I must admit I usually make brownies from the mix in the box, but thought I would try a scratch recipe~it did not disappoint! They are moist, rich, & chocolatey. Used the 3 cups of white sugar & they turned out fine.

Great brownies. And I know some people like flatter brownies, but obviously these are cake-like from the picture, just how I like 'em. I wish everything could be more like cake, actually. I followed the recipe exactly and always get compliments and rarely have leftovers.

Believe it or not my husband and I love boxed brownies.  Every single brownie recipe I have tried has lacked that simple taste we love...until this recipe.  The recipe tastes like the old familiar boxed brownie but with a fudgier kick.  We loved it!  I did as others suggested and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugars.

These were good, I can't believe how much sugar it calls for.  I didn't feel like they were the best though, to me they tasted very similar to box mix brownies.  Don't get me wrong they are still yummy but not the best that I ever tasted.

Wow.  These turned out perfect.  I never realized brownies from scratch could be so easy.  I will use this as my base for all the "fancy" brownies in the future (thinking caramel and nuts).  The brownies were dense,moist, chewy, and uber chocolaty!!  YUM!

Amazing brownies.  This recipe is a keeper if you like an intense soft fudge like brownie.  I think you need all 3 cups of sugar otherwise you are going to loose some of that rich chocolate taste and it could end up a little bitter with all the cocoa added.  If you like a sweeter brownie, add the milk chocolate chips instead.  Goes down amazing with vanilla ice cream.  I served these brownies to my husband and 4 kids while still warm from the oven and litterally half of the 9x13 pan was gone.  This recipe is a keeper. Note:  If you are a dieter, trying to watch what you eat ... these brownies will blow the diet!

Delicious!  The first time I made these I overcooked them b/c the toothpick never came out clean - I think it's because of all the chocolate chips.  The second time, I just baked them for 40 minutes and took them out and wow!  They were actually really good burned, but they are so delicious when cooked properly.  Thank you for the recipe...I have officially taken over the title "brownie girl" from a girl my husband had just started dating when we met.  His family called her "brownie girl" because she baked brownies for him, but mine now put hers to shame...I now have the guy and the title. :o)

fantastic brownies. I've always wanted to make good brownies from scratch, and have always been disappointed with the results. The ones from the box are hard to live up to. This recipe did though. A little hard on the outside, and nice and chewy on the inside, just how i like them. A+. They were a little too chocolately for me though. Might bump that down to 3/4 cup next time.

These never last longer than 3 days at my house. I keep forgetting to melt the butter and I never add chocolate chips, but they are still thick & fudgy & delicious. I always add a thin layer of homemade chocolate frosting, my twin thinks they're too rich that way, but everyone else loves them!!

I was hoping for THE perfect brownie. I like really chewy brownies and I think I baked these too long (even though I followed the directions for the 'toothpick test'), although the sides did soften overnight and they were better the next day. It was almost there, although, I can't say I've baked a LOT of brownies in the past. These were a 8 or 9 out of 10 for me; a touch too sweet. I think these were the right thickness for the pan (about an inch, finished). So, these were a touch too dry for me. I got a request for nuts next time- this recipe is definitely for the purist.

AMAZING. Truly the best brownie recipe that I have tried to date. I did however follow some other reviewers opinions and split the sugar using brown and white. I also added Nestle peanut butter & chocolate chips - HEAVEN! Thank you for sharing!

Fantastic recipe! I was raised on Duncan Hines box brownies and I'll readily admit, I love them. But I'm very allergic to preservatives now and can't eat box brownies, much to my sadness. Anyway, so with an eye towards recreating that flavor, I made these as written, only I substituted half the butter with vegetable oil. Mmmmm, fantastic. Just like box brownies and the crowd went wild. This is now my brownie recipe after years of experimenting!

Delicious, thick, rich brownies.  Only thing I would do differently next time is to grease and flour the baking pan instead of using cooking spray.

IF you like really fudgy brownies, then this is the one for you. I found out I don't though. I couldn't stand to eat them by themselves, so I ate them with vanilla ice cream on top and they were great!!

It's good.  Definatley not cake-like.  Not sure what the other reviewers used to make them so high.  This is a soft fudgelike brownie. Kids liked them- a TON of sugar though- whew!

Fantastic and my new favorite brownie recipe - I'm gonna tear up the card of the other in my recipe box...these are beyond compare!  I followed the recipe as written (I didn't sub sugars as others suggested) and had no problems.  In fact, the edges were as great as the middle, which is a first for me.  These are pretty thick, even in the 13 x 9 pan, so it yields lots of brownies!  I wouldn't half the recipe, though.  I froze what little was left over after the kids got a hold of them.  Thanks Brooke!

These are the best brownies in the history of mankind!  All my other brownie recipes are out the window.  These are SO dense and delicious-- they remind me of my mother's homemade chocolate fudge.  Incredible.  (as per another review, I melted the chips into the batter, as I don't care for chunks of "stuff" in my brownies.)

Yeah, they're that good! This will definitely be my go-to brownie recipe. I added 1/2t. baking soda and 3/4c. chopped walnuts to the batter and 1/4c. chopped walnuts sprinkled on top. Baked for 40 min. and they turned out perfect - not cakey and not too gooey and dense.

Perfectly delicious! They are exactly the right texture, not too cakey at all. This was my first time making brownies from scratch, so I was worried when the batter was so thick. I'm not worried anymore! This is definitely my go-to recipe now. I can't stop myself from thinking of fun ways to dress them up too. :)

These should come with a warning:"WARNING: THE FOLLOWING BROWNIES ARE EXTREMELY RICH FUDGY, ADDICTING, AND DELICIOUS!" That's pretty much all that needs to be said about these.-So to all of you complaining about the texture-READ THE RECIPE DESCRIPTION!!!!!! *****UPDATE******** Made a small batch of "Rich Chocolate Frosting" for anyone to spread on top if they wanted. (I used these instead of cake for a party) There was also whipped cream and sprinkles available, so you could make your own little brownie sundae!

These were very good and very rich!  I could tell that they were going to be because when I sliced them, the brownies felt heavy!  They were moist and very good!

These are soooooo good! I've never made brownies from scratch but after reading the reviews I thought I had to try these...so glad I did! I added pecans like someone suggested and I made them in greased mini muffin pans to make bite-sized brownies.  I sprinkled the top with icing sugar. I don't think I can go back to the boxed type!

DEEEELISH!!  These brownies are SO GOOD!  They are dense, rich, fudgy - a little piece of chocolate heaven!  My 7 year old son asked for a 'brownie' cake for his birthday party and he wanted them frosted with mini coloured M&M's.  Not at all that these need frosting, but I did for my son and used the mini M&M's instead of the chocolate chips.  A definite keeper, thanks!

The PERFECT brownie - no need to change a thing! Perfect amounts of sweetness, chocolate, texture...  Only thing to add is a glass of milk and an exercise program!! Thank you for a great recipe! :)

These were amazing when we ate them warm a few min after taking them out of the oven. However, the leftovers weren't our favorite. The chocolate chips gave the brownies a cruncy texture once they cooled. I guess we prefer the gooey kind!

This was my first time trying homemade brownies--I usually make them from a box--and I LOVED this recipe. I cut the sugar to 2 1/4 cups and I used cake flour instead of sifting regular flour. They definitely came out a little lighter and not so dense, which I loved. I forgot the chocolate chips and they were still amazing. I cant wait to make these again.

Wonderful brownies! I will never bake brownies from a mix again. If you're looking to avoid "non-food" additives such as high-fructose corn syrup, this is the way to go for chewy brownies. I added homemade frosting but they didn't need it.

I've finally found the perfect brownies recipe - in my husband's eyes. He is rightfully picky about his brownies (and who wouldn't be?!) and these have 5 stars. He especially loves the crunchy top and dense chewy-ness. Even better from the fridge! Perfect!

These are so sweet, they gave me a cavity from the first bite. The second time I made them, I cut the sugar down to 2 cups and they were much better. The original 3 cups of sugar recipe is getting the 3 star treatment from me, but cutting the sugar will give it 4 stars.

I've tried making brownies from scratch before, and they always fall short, but these were darn good on my first try.  I followed this recipe as written, with two simple changes, as suggested by other reviewers: I cut the sugar to 2 cups (half white and half brown), and I used milk chocolate chips.  I had only baked them for 25-30 minutes when they tested done, and next time I plan to underbake them even more-- I like a moister, gooey brownie.  Overall, a GREAT recipe.

These were good brownies. However, like some of the other posters, they did take a ridiculously long time to cook- well over an hour. They were still soupy at the 40 minute mark when we were getting ready to take them out of the oven!  They were really tasty while piping hot- but as they cooled they did get hard and crispy. Probably because they had to bake so long. Next time I might try cutting this recipe in half and bake it in a smaller pan, and see if it cooks up better.

Very good for a thick brownie. We ate them warm and they were very moist and had a great flavor. Rich and moist enough to not need any icing. Good stuff. I might put them in a larger pan next time just cause I like my brownies not as thick. Update: I made a batch of these and frosted them with the Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site, OMG- to die for!

The BEST BROWNIES!! The chocolate flavor is very pure since the recipe calls for a whole cup of cocoa.  The chocolate chips stay melted and gooey up to 3 hours out of the oven...perfect for bringing to parties.  The only negative is that these brownies are more expensive to make than most others- but they're worth it in my opinion!

super yummy, moist, great texture and flavor.  I did cut back a little on the sugar (omitted maybe 1/4 cup) and baked an extra 5 minutes or so.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum! This is going to be my brownie recipe from now on. I made it in a 9x13 pan, and it made perfectly sized brownies. I buttered the pan, placed parchment paper in it, and then buttered and floured it which made it easier to remove once it cooled. I used 2 cups of white sugar and found the sweetness to be perfect.  Next time I will try to use Splenda to see if I can make this into a low-carb dessert!

Pretty easy to make, and they were even better the next day! I had to use chunks of chocolate bar instead of chocolate chips because I forgot to buy them.  The recipe also required a bit longer in the oven than originally stated. When they were warm, they weren't as good, because you could taste the cocoa powder, and it was a little weird. Like good cake or soup, they tasted the best about 18 hours after I baked them.

With all the hype, I had high expectations for these brownies.  I followed the recipe to a T and was quite dissapointed.  I was looking for a brownie that's dark and moist, but these are more like a block of fudge than anything else.  They are way sweeter than the average brownie and the amount of butter in them is quite disgusting. This recipe is not for dark chocolate lovers.

Yeah these brownies are awesome! I was little skeptical how much better than the boxed brownies they could be, but they are WAY better! Make sure you have milk in the house!!

These turned out so fudgy and delicious! I baked them for 15 minutes in a mini muffin pan, but I followed the rest of the recipe completely. =)

These brownies are the best, chewy, chocolatey pieces of heaven! You can stop your search for the perfect brownie because this is it. I didn't have an account with allrecipes until now - I had to join just to rave about these brownies! I followed the recipe to the 'T' without changing a thing because I think we owe it to the cook.  It was perfect! No need to add/change/delete a thing (including different types/amounts of sugar). It's perfect as written - humor me and try it Brooke's way first, then change it if you are so inclined. Way to go, Brooke! I will never make a different brownie recipe ever! Thank you for sharing!

Seriously good brownies. I like them better than a box of my favorite. They are ooey and gooey...truly bombshell brownies. I don't even measure my vanilla. I add plenty.

I tried these tonight for Superbowl Sunday. My daughter didn't want me to make brownies from scratch, since most recipes in the past have turned out a little dry, or too "cake"-like. These were absolutely PERFECT! They were perfect for a 9 x 13 cake pan, and were not too flat like some are baked in that size pan. I did use the Nestle swirled morsels instead of the plain semi-sweet chips, since that is what my family usually requests when available, but the texture was perfect and the taste would be wonderful either way, I would imagine. They were chewy, even the sides! This is a keeper, for sure! Thanks Brooke - this will be my permanent, and ONLY brownie recipe!

Thick, gooey, and fudgey tasting. If you are going to frost, or dust these with powdered sugar, I would suggest reducing the sugar to 2 cups.  They were still super sweet!

Delicious! I used WW pastry flour, 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. 1 cup brown sugar, 2 cups organic evap cane juice sugar. My husband who is a huge brownie fan says they are 4 star, I say 5. They were a tad bitter for him...so next time I'll try milk chocolate chips. Thank you for the recipe, I don't see myself every buying a box again, these were so simple to make from scratch.

These are awesome!  I use an 8x10 glass pan and they come out nice and fudgy every time.  I also use 1/2 white and half brown sugar and a little bit of extra vanilla extract.

I've made this recipe with and without the chocolate chips.  Both ways the recipe turns out  very good.  I like this recipe because I usually have everything on hand and it is so easy to make.

I was a little skeptical because several reviewers called these brownies "fudge-like" and I'm not a fan of fudge, but I figured 500 positive reviews had to mean something so I tried them anyway. These brownies were GREAT! I followed other reviewers' advice and subbed one of 3 c sugar for brown, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. The chocolate chips are what really makes this so amazing. Definitely worth taking the time to sift the flour and cocoa powder so you don't get clumps. I will never buy boxed brownies again!!

Oh these are good. So good that my mom says they are her favorite brownies. I'm not the biggest chocolate eater, but I still loved these, 3 cups of sugar and all! Wow, that's a lot of sweetness, but just a square and you're happy. I have already made these twice in one month haha. They're that sinfully yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

These are the best brownies I ever made. I took another reviewer's advice, and coated the chocolate chips with a little flour before adding to batter. Apart from that, I didn't deviate from the recipe at all. They are now a family favorite, and I will never go back to boxed brownie mix again!

If you are looking for a cakey light brownie, THIS IS NOT IT!!!!  These are the fudgiest most delicious brownies.  I've already made them twice.  I didn't have chocolate chips either and they still were DELICIOUS.  They are so good warm with ice cream or cold, or with chocolate icing.  This is THE perfect brownie recipe.  Make sure you sift the cocao, bc the first time I made it, I didn't and it had little pebbles of cocoa throughout the dough.  PERFECT brownies.

These were so delicious and perfectly fudgy.  The only thing I changed was the sugar.  I used 1 1/2 c. brown sugar and about 1/2 c. white sugar.  Then I used the mini semisweet chips and just eyeballed the amount.  I always set my timer for less, so I set it for 30 min and just added 4 min until I got the consistency I wanted.  They are divine.  I tried another recipe on the site with high ratings, but this one definitely is my favorite.

These brownies are good and if you like a fudgy brownie you will love these.  These are really chocolaty, but I think they will be perfect in the chocolate trifle I made from this site because that is so sweet.  If I make this again just for brownie consumption I will take the advice of another reviewer and use milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet because they are a little bitter with all the cocoa and semi sweet chocolate chips.  Thanks for the easy recipe.  I don't think I'll buy box brownies again.

I made these exactly as written and thought they were great.  Be sure not to overcook as they will be very hard around the edges.  I think someone mentioned before that the toothpick test will pickup melted chocolate chips towards the bottom.

This recipe has ruined all other brownies for me.  I don't think there is another brownie to compare to how delicious this is.  I took other peoples suggestions and used half brown sugar and half regular, and I also rather semisweet chunks over the chips.  AMAZING!

DELICIOUS! I made these for my boyfriend, who is obsessed with brownies.  He was skeptical of brownies from scratch, but after eating one claimed that they are the best he has ever had.  He's in the Air Force, and brought them to work that night and said every guy he gave one too were in awe of how delicious they are.  Thanks for the recipe Brooke!

I always prefer to follow a recipe exactly before messing with it; I liked them how it is, but next time I bake these, I'll follow the other reviewers and do 2 cups white and 1 cup brown sugar. Instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips I chopped up about twenty dark chocolate Dove candies, and I topped the still-hot brownies with white chocolate shavings to let them melt. Very good, and nice and sweet. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is beyond outstanding!  My husband purchased some Valrhona cocoa powder at Pike Place Market yesterday, so I just had to try it out on this recipe.  This recipe truly creates the perfect brownie in our eyes.  This is my first attempt at homemade brownies, so I'm very happy.

My first attempt at making brownies from scratch. The texture was very brownie-ish, which is good. The taste was OK (also, my friends ate them but didn't seem wowed by it), but I noticed a tiny bit of sour after-taste. I don't know why. I'll try another brownie recipe and see if it is any better.

I tried this recipe twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was a little too sweet. The second time I reduced the sugar by a cup and the brownies rose really high and turned out way too cakelike. I don't think I'll attempt to make these again.

I liked this brownie a lot, but my husband who loves brownies thought it was just good.  I would have given it 4.5 if I could.  I used parchment instead of greasing the pan...worked perfectly.  I used Ghiardelli cocoa and chips and it honestly tasted a little "too" Ghiardelli.  Maybe I need to mix brands next time.  I used two cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. It is sweet, But I like sweet.

I'm eating this brownie right now! Yum! I made them exactly like the recipe states the second time (the first time I forgot to mix in the chocolate chips so I sprinkled them on top), and the recipe is PERFECT as is! Thanks for sharing! I won't be sharing mine!

Very good.  I made these with 2 c. white sugar, 1 c. brown sugar, as suggested by another reviewer.  They required longer in the oven than expected, but it may have been the shape of my 9x13" pan, which has rounded corners and thus requires a bit longer in the oven because the brownies are more dense and thick.  The flavor was excellent and my guests gave plenty of compliments about the rich chocolate flavor.

These took forever to bake, I used a 9x13 pan like it said, I am hopeless at making brownies, they were really yummy though the tops were a little to crispy. I may try making them again in a different pan, thanks.

These brownies are dangerous, it's really hard to eat only one.  I made them for my son's birthday party at school and the other kids had to wait until he had the first bite.  When it was the rest of the class's turn to take a bite, I swear I heard a collective "Mmmmm". Even my husband loved them and he's not a chocolate person.

These are the best brownies I have ever had.  The only things i changed in the recipe are: I replaced 1 cup white sugar with 1/2 of brown and 1/2 cup of white.  I also replaced the chocolate chips with 1 cup of walnuts.  Absolutely amazing recipe!

OMG, these brownies were AWESOME.  My brother in law brought home the recipe, because he had them at work and they came out really good.  When I had another one the next day, it was just as good.  I will be making these again in a couple of weeks.

Brooke, these are great brownies.  They sure are fudgey, just the way I like them.  They were a little gritty the first day but that disappeared by the second day and I thought they were even better.  I may try decreasing the sugar or half granulated and half brown sugar as some of the others have done.  This is a keeper for me.

These were AMAZING! As good as any fancy bakery-bought brownies! I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar (3 cups total) and 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour. I used margarine instead of the butter, and it turned out great. Mixed in what was left of a bag of jumbo dark-dark chocolate chips. YUM!

I followed the suggestion of others about the half/half white/brown sugar, I also used semi-sweet chocolate squares (melted) instead of chocolate chips.  Lastly, we only had spread butter, so I used butter flavored crisco.  

All that said, these are quite yummy.  They have that fudgy quality that makes a brownie a brownie.  And they demanded that I go to the fridge and pour myself a glass of milk before I could even finish them.  That's what makes them so good in my opinion.  

Thanks for the recipe- my sister's already asked me to make them again.

I'm a brownie man.  I made these using the Brownie pan over at amazon (the one where every piece has two chewy sides).  These are the best brownies I have ever had in my life!  I added half a cup of walnuts broken up, but that's it.  Recipe was perfect!  I just won't look at the calorie content :)

These really are incredible. Dense and chewy, with a bit of crunch. As per suggestions from other users I reduced sugar to 2 1/2 cups (1 1/4 white, 1 1/4 brown). At 2 1/2 cups our sweet teeth  were plenty satisfied. Other than that I did everything as per Brooke's original. Although the directions didn't say one way or the other, I mixed all of this by hand to ensure the dense and chewy consitency was not compromised. I find today's mega-watt hand mixers can reek havoc on baked goods like cookies and brownies (you end up with  drier, more cakey outcomes). I baked them for 37 minutes and even though the toothpick did not come out clean I didn't want to risk over baking so I pulled them out and let them cool in the pan. They were perfect, two minutes any more would have been too much. For what it's worth I live at sea level and cook in a gas oven. Thanks Brooke, this will be the brownie recipe used in my home.

I was surprised how easy and delicious these were. At first when I was pouring the batter I didn't think it would make enough because I'm used to the boxed brownie mix but these brownies were so thick and yummy. I used the 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar like others suggested.

They were a huge hit with my family. They are actually requesting that I make more

Holy mother of brownies. From-scratch are usually dry, cakey, and inferior to my standby box: Betty Crocker Hershey's Triple Chocolate. Brooke has figured it out, though! Dense, rich, and fudgy, with a perfect crust on top and on the corners. These are almost better when cool or the next day, which goes contrary to all of my baking maxims! Try these and you may never buy a box again.

Awesome brownies.  Definitely use butter.  The first time I tried this, we used margarine because that's what we had on hand.  They were only so-so.  Butter definitely makes a difference in this recipe.  Some of the best brownies I've ever tasted.

These were good, but oh so sweet! I baked them for 45 minutes because they seemed soft in the middle. In the end, they were a bit hard around the edges. I think I'll try a few of the other brownie recipes next!

Very good recipe. I listened to the other suggestions and added 1c brown and 1c white sugar. I also used 1/2 c oil and 1/.2 apple sauce and I used 1/2 c whole wheat flour. It was a very good recipe. Amazing with chocolate cookie dough ice cream :).

Awesome.  Soooo good!  I halved the recipe and poured it in an 8x8 glass pan and it came out perfectly moist. It was sooo chewy and fudgy!  I sprayed my pan with regular Pam and it was easy to take out.  Not at first because I couldn't wait for them to cool so I chowed one down hot!

These are good brownies -rich and fudgy. But also very sweet (and that's after cutting the sugar to 2 cups). The 2,000+ rating had me expecting something spectacular and these, while good, didn't earn that adjective.

I did as other reviewers noted and cut the sugar back to 2 cups.  This was a fabulous, chocolately recipe!  It was the perfect amount of fudgey; I was happy that it didn't puff up to cake style brownies!!

These are ok.  They are much better if you replace some of the butter with either Amaretto or Bailey's Irish Cream.  They're gooey and chewy and they have lots of chocoloate, but they can be better with the liquor.

I cut the recipe in half, but accidentally used 1 1/4c flour rather than 3/4c flour.  the brownies still turned out fudgy and good.  I will definitely make these again (the right way next time).

Best brownies I've ever had. However, I'd recommend using milk chocolate chips in place of the semisweet chips for people who don't like dark chocolate.

By far the best brownie recipe I've ever tried!  My husband LOVES them!  The only change I made was using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and they were perfect. I've also added walnuts which for me makes a perfect brownie.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

These are so chocolaty and delicious that 5 stars almost seems like an insult.  Following the advice of other reviews, I used brown and white sugar, but reduced each to 1 1/4 cups as I thought the original recipe seemed like it had a bit too much sugar in it.  I also used chopped pecans in place of the chocolate chips.  These brownies are ridiculously good and I'm certain they won't last long!!

I've always been intimated by making from scratch brownies.  These are easy!  And great.  I did substitute half of the white sugar for brown sugar, but other than that...a great recipe.  :)

Fantastic!  I usually stick to the box mix brownies because they are the most moist and the chewiest...but these were perfect!  I use dark swiss chocolate broken into pieces instead of chocolate chips, and the darkest coaco I can find.  I am using an oven in europe...and have to leave them in a bit longer.  Don^t over cook since the chocolate pieces melt and the toothpick won't come out clean...but it should not have batter on it, only melted chocolate.

A little too dense for my taste, and they tasted like store-bought brownies (which is good or bad, depending on your perspective!) I cut back on the sugar as suggested, and liked the sugar content, at least.

These brownies were delicious! The richest thing you'll ever find. I made exactly as directed, including the massive amounts of sugar and butter. I also used this as the base for "Cheesecake Topped brownies" found on allrecipes and found that they would have been better without the topping. These stand alone and are DELICIOUS!

These were my very first attemt at brownies. I made them as stated and they turned out pretty good. I thought they were way too intense. Next time I will leave the chocolate chips out. If you can't get enough of chocolate, this is the recipe for you.

First of all, these brownies are good.  But they're not great.  I've been on a quest to find the best brownie recipe, hoping to match the brownies made by my friend's mom from my childhood.  The brownies she made were in a whole different class, and only once did I taste a homemade brownie that had a similar taste.  I did half brown sugar and left out about a tablespoon of white sugar.  I also chopped up semisweet chocolate instead of using chips.  These bombshell brownies make good, fudgy brownies, but they're a bit cocoa-y, and you have to make SURE you add the extra chocolate bits (they really make them better, even though I wasn't wanting to put them in) and UNDERCOOK the brownies!!!  If you cook them for the recommended time, you'll get cakey brownies, so keep your eye on them.  The time to take them out of the oven is RIGHT before you start to smell them, so it's tricky.
  I've tentatively decided that cocoa is what makes these and brownies not as good as they can be, not the best flavor, so I'm searching for a recipe that uses melted chocolate, or maybe I'll try dutch cocoa.  I'm going to try the Barefoot Contessa one next.

So, in conclusion, use half brown sugar, leave out just a bit of white sugar, undercook them as much as possible, put in the semisweet chocolate.  Then they are good brownies, but again, not the best.

These are seriously the best.  I prefer thick, fudge-like brownies as opposed to soft, cake-like ones, and these are definitely the former rather than the latter.  The butter came together easy and was a snap to put together.  To make it even easier I microwaved the butter as previous reviewers suggested.  The recipe calls for a large bowl and, trust me, you need A LARGE BOWL.  This makes tons of batter.  Very chocolatey and the chocolate chips are a great addition.  I had no problem with the brownies turning "grainy" after a couple days; mine are *still* tasty, but now that they're a few days old they taste better when warmed up with a little bit of ice cream.  Mmm!  I'll never use another brownie mix after finding this recipe!

Oh my, these are good!  I have done alot of baking, but surprisingly, have never made brownies before.  I'm so glad I found this recipe!  They were quite easy to make and absolutely decadent!  I might try substituting peanutbutter chips for the chocolate chips, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

I made these brownies this past weekend and everyone loved them.  I put whole pecans on top before I put them in the oven. OMG, the pecans were toasted and made the brownies even better.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

After reading the reviews and looking at another highly rated recipe on the site, I decided to melt the one cup of chocolate chips and add to the batter at the end after slightly cooled.  I also added an additional 1 cup of mini chocolate chips.  These brownies were so thick, rich and gooey.  The chocolate chips really added to the depth of the brownie, and the mini chips melted right in during baking.  (I did coat them in flour first)

Wow!!  These were the best brownies I have had in a long time.  I followed the recipe and didn't have the 4 eggs, and used 3 instead and they were still wonderful!  This recipe will be my brownie recipe from here on out!  Thanks!

This was the brownie recipe that I've been looking for for a long time. Unbelievably good! Unfortunately I won't be making them again since they gave DH the worst heartburn that he's ever had in his life.

Finally, a brownie recipe that I absolutely love.  I have tried & tried to find the perfect recipe and this is it!!  I followed an earlier review the first time I made them and added 1/2 tsp baking soda because I like the top to be a little crispy and they turned out not so good -- puffed up on the sides and flat in the middle; although the flavor was great.  I made them again following the recipe exactly and they were brownie perfection!  The only tip I have for those who don't like the chocolate chips in the recipe is to chop them up or use finely chopped chocolate instead.  I don't like to bite into bits of chocolate in my brownies either, so I used the chopped chocolate and it was perfect -- no chocolate chunks and really chocolatey.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!! :0)

Everyone loved these, these brownies are delicious! Very dense, moist, and extremely chewy even several days after baking. I added somewhere around 3/4 cups of walnuts by special request and they were a bit hit! I used a baking dish slightly smaller than 9x13 so with the remaining bater I added one shot of espresso and baked it in 2 oven-safe teacups which was a delightful presentation of a rounded puffed mocha brownie. The regular bar brownies were delicious but I really liked the addition of espresso in the teacup ones I made, so next time I make these I will add some espresso and leave out the nuts. I also used high quality dark semisweet chocolate baking bars and chopped it roughly which gave an amazing fudgey aspect to the brownies. So delicious!  I will make this recipe again but play around with the recipe a little to make it perfect for me.

These were pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly and think they might be better without the addition of chocolate chips.  The texture is wonderful, but I personally feel the chocolate chips make them a bit too sweet.  I don't know if taking them out will ruin the recipe, but I'll try it without them next time.

great rich brownies that are almost TOO rich.  I followed the recipe exactly and am considering adding some heavy cream next time just to lighten things up a tad, great brownies though, rich as they are!! Thanks Brooke

these are awesome!  I was looking for a recipe to replace the box kind (the only kind my (picky) hubby and I seem to like) and decided to try this one.  after my husband tried them and said they were delicious, I asked if he like them better than the boxed kind.  He looked very confused and said "these aren't from the box?"
So I think we have a winner!
The only change I made were:
I added between 1/4- 1/2 cup milk to make it have the same consistency as the boxed kind, and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.

These are very sweet.  I will use just 2 cups of sugar next time and will  add nuts, but these were chewy and fudgy with a crunchy crackled top.  These are the first brownies that I have liked more than boxed mix.  I will be using this recipe often. So chocolatey and yummy! I love that this recipe uses cocoa rather than melting chocolate and it is not cakey at all! These baked up perfectly in about 26 minutes. Thanks for sharing this rich and yummy recipe!

My boyfriend said these were the best brownies he'd ever tasted! I added 1 cup of brown sugar, and slightly more than one cup of white sugar. Three cups would have been too sweet for our taste. Otherwise, I made them exactly as written, and they were fantastic!

Chocolate heaven.  These are moist and dense at the same time.  Watch cooking time so the bottom doesn't get to dark.  Make sure you have lots of milk to eat them with.  Will now be a staple in my house, I love that this recipe uses cocoa instead of chocolate squares.

I'm from the Netherlands and i always bake my brownies using a mix. I get these mixes (famous brands) in America or Canada. But now i've run out of mixes and i had to look for a recipe. I found this one and WOOOW!! I'm never using a mix again. These brownies are soo good. I also used 1,5 cup brown sugar and 1,5 cup white sugar. The only ingredient i can't get here is vanilla extract but lucky enough i stacked up a lot of bottles!! These brownies are so fudgy and sweet and rich. I already called my mum to tell her she doesn't need the mix anymore and send her this recipe. this is the best!

I have tried many different brownies and these were the best! Very moist even the next day. I think they are better when they cool, unless they have ice cream over them when they are hot! Awesome, thanks for sharing!

These brownies came out great.  I made them with my 3 & 4 year old boys-- they had big fun doing it, and it didn't make too many dirty bowls, which is always a bonus.
The only change I made was, as someone suggested, for the sugar I used 1.5 cups brown sugar and 1.5 cups regular (I actually used a raw type for the white sugar).  
Great recipe.

AMAZING! I made this, halved the recipe, added half peanut butter cup chips and half chocolate pieces, and only added 1 cup of sugar as opposed to 1 1/2 cups of sugar. These are fantastic!

These things are AMAZING. I made them super healthy, they ended up being 60 calories for 1/24 of the pan, and they were STILL so delicious, moist and rich!!  I subbed half of the butter with Brummel & Brown spread, the other half with unsweetened applesauce; used EggBeaters for all 4 eggs; and lastly I completely omitted the chocolate chips.  NEW FAVORITE RECIPE!!

These are the best brownies ever.  I doubt I'll use any other recipe from now on.  The chocolate chips really make them nice!

WOW, these were fantastic!  The only changes I made were that I used all brown sugar (that's what I had) and maybe 1/4 c. of chocolate chips (again, all I had).   I baked half the recipe in an 8x8 pan, then the other half. I really enjoyed these!  Chewy, fudgy, and sweet!  I can't wait to experiment with this recipe to make "turtle brownies," "mint brownies," "mocha brownies," etc.  Thanks for sharing!

These were delicious brownies! I only used 2 cups of sugar because I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet and the brownies were still plenty sweet. 

I was looking for a brownie recipe because I wanted to make an ice cream birthday cake for a friend. So I used this recipe as the base then added a layer of cookies and cream icecream then topped it with crushed oreo cookies and drizzled chocolate sauce... was unreal!

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would. I think I just died and went to heaven. These brownies taste like those that you'd get at the most amazing restaurants! I didn't have enough butter, so I substituted 1/2 cup vegetable oil and used 1/4 cup of butter, and they turned out perfectly moist and chewy with a slightly crunchy top. Also, I decreased the amount of sugar to 2 1/2 cups sugar, since I like my brownies a little less sweet. I'm not sure if I can wait till my hubby gets home. Next time, definitely making double batches! Thank you so much for this recipe! :)

These are a delicious, dense, fudgy brownie.  I usually don't like to rate recipes if I've deviated from the author's recipe, but I did follow other users suggestions and do half dark brown/white sugar.  I baked them in a metal pan for 34 minutes.

Fabulous, just the brownie I have been searching for. I did use half brown and half white sugar as suggested by other reviewers and it was great. They are a little chewy and very tasty.

These brownies have an intense and very rich flavor. I loved them! One problem is that they were so rich, I couldn't eat a lot of them at once. I shared them with friends and family and still have some left over.
Great job on this recipe! They keep well, too.

wow, these brownies are definately the fudgiest brownies I have ever tastied. There are veeeery rich. I can eat a whole box of chocolate in fifteen minutes but I could not eat more then a piece of these brownies. Great with milk. The only thing I changed I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and baked for 45 min. First I thought I overbaked it but I did not. Edges were chevy and middle part was soft with crunch top. Thank you for rec.

I'm positive this recipe is as good as all the reviewers said. I love chocolate & I love brownies....but I always feel a little too quilty with all the sugar and fat.......so I did 1/2 butter 1/2 applesauce and 2 cups raw sugar instead of 3 and used spelt flour instead of white. They were absolutely awesome. It's a keeper ;)

This was my first ever attempt to bake brownies and I'm glad I chose this recipe to start with.  They came out pretty good, but were a bit salty for my taste.  The only minor changes I made were swapping half of the sugar for brown sugar and adding half a cup of chopped walnuts.

These brownies are incredibly rich and chewy! We loved them! The only change I made was adding walnuts. Next time I might try with half white and half brown sugar but it is so good as it is, I might not! Terrific recipe!

My oh my, brownie heaven!!!   Keep in  mind I don't try a new brownie recipe often but have been looking at this one for about a month.  I like a brownie that is not to cakey but is not so fudgy that it tastes and looks undercooked.  I made these with exactly what they call for and followed the directions to a T, my oven which runs hot it took 35 min. and these are absolutely superior! The men are gonna love these for Superbowl and my family is gonna love them as a new brownie addition.  Thank you Brooke.

THE BEST EVER!  I had never made homemade brownies before and I'm so glad I came across this one.  I followed the directions exactly and they came out perfect, I couldn't stop eating them. Also, they were easy to make so I'll never be buying brownie mixes again.  Thanks for sharing this winner Brooke.

Very easy to make, and very moist. I used half brown and white sugar as others suggested, and baked for only 32 minutes, to avoid burnt edges.
Served at a party, and everyone enjoyed.

Good but more cake-like than I had hoped.  Maybe it's just because I had an edge piece.  I did decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup and did half white, half brown sugar.  I think I'll use all the sugar next time.  I also used peanut butter chips, which is good, but I think I'll try with reg. chips next time.

These were very yummy, but I did NOT bake them in a 9X13 pan per one reviewer's suggestion, and I wish that I had.  In the smaller pan (8X12) they were too thick and dense and the sides got overdone.  Will probably make this again in a larger pan.  Very rich and yummy!

AMAZING... 2nd time I made the brownies I added extra choc chips because everyone liked them so much, chopped nuts in 1/2 for the hubby.  Next time I'm going to try peanut butter chips with the choc chips for a variation.  These changes were just to mix it up a bit, but the org recipies is awesome.

These are INCREDIBLE!  So rich and fudgy... I've never had a homemade brownie quite like this!  My only changes were egg substitute for the egg, and dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  Otherwise made it just as written.  Be very careful not to overbake these, or they will lose their yummy fudginess!

These were good, but not fantastic. I did follow suggestion and use half brown and half white sugar. They were very sweet, I think next time I will cut the sugar down to 2.5c. Also, the vanilla flavor was a little strong for my liking, maybe 1/2 tbsp would work better. I made two batches and added about 1c chopped walnuts to one of the batches. I preferred those to the plain ones. Not a bad recipe, I will continue tweaking it to my liking.

This is the best brownies recipe I've ever tried and I've tried a lot! The third time I made this, I didn't have butter on stock. I used homemade applesauce instead and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. It turned out to be just as good (or even better). Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I love these brownies, they are awesome just the way they are! But to add just a little more decadence, I pulled them out of the oven about five minitues early and added about 1/2 bag of mini marshmallows and then finished baking. After baking, I topped the melted marshmallows with chocolate frosting: 1-2/3c powdered sugar, 1/2c butter, 1/3c cocoa powder, 1/3c canned evaporated milk. Sinful!

These browines are VERY rich and fudgy and chocolaty.  That being said, I didn't love them as much as I should based on that description.  It just seemed like too much, and not in a good way.  I have a really similar recipe that only uses 2 cups of sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, and 3/4 cups of cocoa and for some reason I like it tons better.

i thought they were okay, but my family loved them! I used half brown sugar and half white.  Watch the cooking time they will get hard if overcooked.

These ARE the most incredibly moist and rich brownies! NOT cake-like at all (which I hate). I followed Brooke's recipe exactly, but did add some chopped walnuts. Perfectly divine! Especially when served warm with a scoop of ice cream!! My niece hounded me for days for the recipe, until I finally relented and passed it along to her.

These turned out perfect. I brought them to a (Canadian) Thanksgiving dinner and the host flat out told me that she was keeping the extras. Success!

These brownies completely satisfy the craving for a good ol' fashioned brownie.

This is a pretty good recipe. I made it exactly as directed, with the three full cups of white sugar, no brown sugar. They are fudgy; I didn't think they were eggy, and I felt they tasted best the day they were made. I liked the richness of the chocolate--lots of cocoa powder, and I used bittersweet chocolate chips because I am a true dark chocolate fan. I do think maybe 3 cups of sugar is a bit too much; I think that the next time I make them I will try decreasing the sugar and maybe try it with the brown sugar variation. Also, next time I will probably add some espresso powder to deepen the chocolate flavor. this is an easy recipe and a pretty good one, but my favorite brownie recipe uses melted chocolate; this is slightly faster and less expensive to make though.

These were definitely better the next day. When I tried them warm, all I could taste was egg. Probably just me, since nobody else would admit to tasting it. ;) The next day though, they were great. Easy recipe to follow, and just as good as a mix, IMO.  I can't imagine how anyone is getting 'cake' from this mix - these are the complete opposite of cakey!  This time, I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I added half a bag of Heath bits.  This is a great recipe that far surpasses boxed mixes.

These are not called Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies, they are called Orgasmic Brownies!  So nice to have a brownie without a taste of artificial coloring/flavoring/box recipe.  MMMM thanks Brooke!

These were fantastic!  Fudgy, rich and VERY chocolatey!  I made them as stated in the recipe, with one change recommended by other reviewers - I used half white sugar and half brown sugar instead of all white sugar.  They were awesome, and didn't last long!

very easy and very good recipe.  I made it with the three grandchildren helping.
few changes were: no salt, decreased the
sugar to 1 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1 cup white flour.
Next time I will use less sugar.

I logged on to all recipes last night in search of something yummy to make with chocolate chips.  Lo and behold, Brooke's brownie recipe was on the home page!  I made them, followed the recipe exactly, and they are sooo good!  We had them while they were still warm and gooey, yum!

These are great brownies! I only added 2 cups and they are plenty sweet. I didn't make them exactly I didn't add the chocolate chips as I was really craving marshmallows so I added about 15 marshmallows to the batter. They are great, even without I can tell that these are a great moist fudgey brownie, but I would be leary of adding the full 3 cups of sugar.

Best homemade brownies I’ve ever made.  Didn’t alter the recipe at all, and they were perfect.  My husband l, who doesn’t like sweet desserts, couldn’t stop eating these.  Toothpick won’t come out clean; just baked them exactly 40 minutes.

The center didn’t set up, but I do like soft brownies. I’m afraid if it cooked longer the edges would be over cooked. Overall a good, simple brownie mix.

My 10-year-old made these by herself and they’re the best brownies I’ve ever eaten in my life. Perfectly fudgy with the thin layer of crustiness on top. When she got them out after 35 minutes she was going to check them with a toothpick. I told her no because it would have batter on it no matter what. If I hadn’t been in there, she probably  would have tested and put them back in the oven.  I could tell they were done. They are remarkable. For people commenting about the sugar... they're a treat, and an excellent one at that. They don’t taste like straight sugar. They actually have  a wonderful richness to them that I couldn’t believe came from just cocoa powder. We will never use another brownie recipe. Thanks, Brooke!

Way, way too sweet for a brownie.  If you want something ooey, gooey and packed full of sugar, make a different type of sweet........a chocolate volcano or chocolate pudding cake type dessert or something similar.

Very easy to make, but extremely way too sweet for me. My husband and son loved them though. Also make sure not to over bake! I checked with a toothpick at 35 min, let it go another 5 minutes and the edges of the brownies were so hard I could barely cut them with a serrated knife. If you like ooey, gooey, fudgey and overly sweet brownies, then you will love these.

Made as directed except with espresso chips. Not bad but will try again with different chips. Pretty simple recipe which is great because I'm not even an intermediate cook yet. I'm still working at it. Pretty good recipe though. Thanks! Will re review when I make it again

I made this exactly as the recipe states. But they didn’t come out soft. Not sure if I baked too long but that’s what happened. They were ok.

I went down to 2c sugar instead of 3c on the full recipe and it was still a bit too sweet for my taste. I really enjoyed the texture, so I might try again with 1.5c sugar next time.

The texture of these brownies is amazing. However, I couldn't bear how rich they were. Neither could the rest of my family. Too sweet, and too dark for our taste. I had even cut back the sugar by 1/3 of a cup. But it was still over the top for us and  my kids didn't even finish them. I would like to try them again by using half the sugar and less cocoa and see if we can find our sweet spot, because I can imagine they'd be perfect if just a little less rich.

I made this in a 13 × 9 in pan. I made everything according to recipe, except: I added 1/4 tsp baking soda for the crackly top, 1/4 tsp garam masala, and some pecans. I forgot to fold in the chocolate chips and pecans, so halfway through the brownies, i put a layer of pecans, and put 1/2 the chocolate chips on top of them (so they wouldn't sink to the bottom). Mixed the last half with the remaining batter and smoothed on top of the pecans/chocolate chips. I sprinkled a tiny bit of chili powder on them at the end to give more of a warming effect. Brownies were thick, and as gooey as skillet brownies, and the top was super crackly and crispy (baking soda). This recipe makes a ton of brownies, but it is worth it. Boyfriend doesn't want to share them with his coworkers. 
You won't regret making these!

I don't know how you came up with this recipe but it is the best brownie I've ever had. The toothpick came out clean ( showing it was done cooking) but when you bite into it, it literally melts into fudgy lava. Good job Brooke !

These are good from a chocolate standpoint, but WAY too sweet!! Great recipe otherwise. I made them again and cut the sugar down to 2 cups and it was still even too sweet for my liking especially if you add the chocolate chips. If you use less than 2 cups of sugar I fear you would mess with texture too much. I will try one last time with 2 cups sugar and no chocolate chips.

I'm not sure what happened and I am a seasoned baker. They looked good until they came out of the oven. They deflated and became very dense.

These were phenomenal. I was making a double batch and ran out of sugar, so I used about 1/4 cup less than the recipe called for. I don't think it was missed.

These brownies were the perfect combination of dense cake and flavor. The only adaptation I made was to substitute mini chocolate chips (all I had) and to leave out 1/2 cup of sugar. they were still sweet enough. Great recipe! thanks for sharing.

Sweet, tasty brownies with a chewy, gooey center and crunchy, chewy edges.

Moderator chocolate flavor. Quite sweet. Well liked by most people.

Quite good for potlucks.

I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  Best brownies I've ever eaten &  everyone who has tried them have said the same thing.  Like some others, I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Baked for 35 minutes.  Chewy, fudgy deliciousness!!!!  I've made them twice in seven days.

These are literally the best brownies ever!  They are so rich and dense. They are so easy to make and have so few ingredients. I use the ghiradelli cocoa powder which makes the incredible taste.  Only thing I do differently is add extra chocolate chips...just because!

These are actually fantastic-  they are fudgy and super chocolatey- I made them in two separate pans, one rose more than the other but the edges were super crunchy and the tops were amazingly crispy. This is a really solid hard-too-mess-up kinda recipe. They yield a solid amount, and in general I really have no complaints. Just remeber to liberally butter your pan before baking!

OMG, these were the best brownies I have ever eaten.  Even the hardened edges were good.   I baked these to take to a church function, only 5 small pcs came back home.  They were gone hour later.  Would definitely make again and highly recommend.

Very, very rich and delicious!  Over the top chocolaty, especially with the chocolate chips!  Love this recipe. I did have to bake about 45 minutes because the middle just needed a little longer.  Will definitely make again!

These were easy to make but they had a weird texture (I think melting the sugar with the butter on the stove would have helped) and they didn’t have the strong chocolate flavor that I look for in a brownie. I had to add a chocolate frosting to get them chocolatey enough.

I've made these a few times now and they are terrific. I used course salt this last time instead of table salt and everyone eavee about the taste of the salt and kept calling them sea salt brownies. They're easy to make and the best that I've tried. Much better than any box.

Made as directed to the T with a 13x9 at 350 for 30 minutes and these are exactly as described in the recipe description! Chewy edges, fudgey underbaked-like centers...which is just how I like my brownies. If this is your type of brownie then this is a great recipe for those who purposely underbake other brownie recipes (except this one holds its shape...even in the center pieces). Admittantly the chocolate flavor may be just a LITTLE too rich for me personally, but I think this can easily be fixed with subbing the chocolate chips for chopped nuts. For those who messed with the sugar measurements or complained about the sweetness of these....its a brownie for darn sake!! Its supposed to be overly sweet and not very good for you....sheesh some people...if you wanted a "skinny" brownie why dont you add the word HEALTHY in front of brownie recipe in your search bar, instead of underating a perfectly good recipe because it wasn't exactly want you wanted. READ THE RECIPE DESCRIPTIONS BEFORE MAKING....good lord.

These were so delicious!  I followed a few reviewers’ suggestions and subbed 1/2 the white sugar - 1-1/2 Cups - for brown sugar.  A much greater depth of flavor!  On Saturday I made them for Hubby with the 1 Cup of chocolate chips (Kirkland/Costco are the BEST!) and on Sunday we were having  dinner at my daughter’s and I made them again...this time I upped the chips to 1-1/2 Cups.  A simple ganache finished them up deliciously!  Thank you!

Best brownie recipe ever! Halved the recipe, baked in a 7x11 pan at 330 for 32 minutes, added 1/2 cup butterscotch chips instead of chocolate, because that's all I had. Hubby and son devoured them with oohs and aahs

Great recipe, highly customizable. This is a really good recipe, the brownies are rich and fudgy.  I put most of the chocolate chips on top and added chopped walnuts. After everything came out of the oven and comes for a few minutes I drizzled caramel sauce over the top to make turtle brownies.  The only things different that I would do were changes I made to the recipe. I would use caramel candies and add them at the end of cooking time and I didn't wait long enough for them to cool before trying to cut them.

Tastes awesome! For the powdered cacao, I took whole, organic cacao beans --hulled them and powdered them. I used 2 cups of date sugar (contains several minerals) & 1 cup of organic cane sugar.  Added 1 cup of chopped walnuts, floured the chips so they would not drop to bottom.  Baked at 325 degrees for 25 min. due to having  a convection oven.  Waited 45 min. before cutting into them.  Wonderful!!  They taste best the next day, after being in the refrigerator overnight.

I have never been a big brownie fan.  They are either too hard or too “cocoaey”.  But THESE are awesome! I only changed the baking temperature to 325° because I used a dark metal pan.  The top was crispy and the edges didn’t burn!

A combination of butter and vegetables oil spread, along with a mixture of sugar/ brown sugar,  was used in my preparation. These disappeared super fast.  When asked what would make them better, my husband (who prefers dark chocolate) said, “Substitute milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet.”  I agree.

I forgot how much better homemade brownies are than box. Followed recipe, except for no chocolate chips. Somewhat dense and chewy and very delicious. Not overly sweet- perfect for a scoop of icecream and some mac nuts.

Everyone loved these. VERY rich. Made a batch with AP flour and a batch with a gluten free flour mix (did our usual GF baking practice of adding an extra egg and 1 tsp of xanthan gum per cup of flour to better match what brownies). Thanks for the great recipe.

Didn’t change a thing. These are the most chocolatey ooey gooey goodness, made by me!! Omg I can believe I made these!! Thank you for this recipe. They need to sit up for at least, at least!! 45 minutes before you cut them. Even then, they may still a little bit of time. Going to pair with some vanella ice cream with my next piece
of want brownie goodness .

I've made these brownies about 5 times.  I use Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour, Hershey's dark chocolate cocoa, 1 Tbsp espresso powder, semi-sweet chocolate chips, and reduce the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  They freeze well too.

This was great! I used a cupcake tin to bake them so they would be individual sized and it was super great. I baked it for 15 minutes, then for about 8 more minutes and it turned out well.

OMG! These are the best brownies I have ever had! They are sooooooooooo fudgy! The only difficult part is just that the batter is incredibly thick, goopy, and hard to stir. You could probably use white chocolate chips if you want. If you take some to any event they would disappear instantly!

I tried the original way, and using organic mayonnaise in the place of the butter. I'm still not sure which way I prefer. Maybe after another dozen brownies and jug of milk.  Lol

I made this recipe four times! Three of those times, it was wonderful! My mother asked for this as a birthday treat, and she typically prefers no desserts. One tip is to be very precise on the oil, and to make sure not to over/under bake. Thanks for the recipe, BROOKE. I hope you come out with more!

Did half brown sugar and half white sugar instead of the whole 3 white. Recommend adding snacks like Oreos or pretzels to the mix.

I love this receipe. I did alter it a bit. I used Truvia baking blend instead of white sugar. The ratio I used is 1 and 1/2 cups of the Truvia baking blend to equal the 3 cups of white sugar. I will definitely make this receipe again.

The brownies turned out extremely fudgy and chewy! Just the way I like it! I followed the recipe exactly. Surprisingly, it was a bit too sweet for me. Next time, I’ll cut back on the sugar.

Instead of cutting back on the sugar I used 70% dark chocolate and it turned out perfect!

Man this recipe is the best!!! Made it for like the 4th time. No matter how I adjusted the servings it comes out perfectly chewy and fudgy.

This is now my go-to brownie recipe, due to a chronic illness I cook from scratch.  It is important to make this in a 9x13 as it is dense, but these are incredible.  They also freeze well for batch cooking purposes.

I was surprised by how thick the batter was and thought I’d added too much flour or cocao powder, but they turned out great.  I live at a semi-high altitude (Denver), did not modify the recipe, and baked in a 9x13 glass pan.  The brownies ended up being a little over 1” thick.  I baked for 30 minutes and they seemed a little raw inside so I added 5 more minutes.  After they had cooled, I realized I shouldn’t have given them the extra 5 minutes as the edges are crumbly vs chewy.  The middle is chewy, bordering on dry.  3 out of 4 of us loved these brownies, so I’ll try again to perfect it.

These brownies are fantastic!! They do not have any baking soda or powder in them, so make sure to beat the eggs into the butter/sugar mixture to until light in color/ribbon stage and then gently fold in the flour/cocoa (Mary Berry style). Made them in a 9x13 and they are perfect height an oh so fudgy!! Great find on this Blizzardy day in MN!!

I've been making these for a little bit now.  I picked this recipe because I've been teaching my great granddaughters to ages 7 and 9 to cook and bake from scratch.  Not only is it easy but they're quite good.

Fantastic recipe! I took the advice of some other reviewers and did a 1/2 mixture of brown sugar and white sugar. I also used milk chocolate chips since that’s what I had, and baked them for about 10 mins, no longer. They were perfectly textured and tasted PHENOMENAL! I should also mention I halved the original recipe to 12 servings because I just didn’t want too many to eat by myself

These were nothing like I wanted or expected and I would not make them again. I took the advice to use 1 c brow sugar and 1 c white sugar and eliminate the 3rd c of sugar, which was a good idea since they were still very sweet although I’m not sure if it changed the chemistry so much that the flavor and texture were just not at all like a chewy gooey delicious brownie. It almost tasted like a “light”, low cal, brickish brownie but without actually being low cal. Not a win in my opinion. I did follow the rest of the recipe almost exactly aside from adding a bit more vanilla. Sadly, I’ve made boxed brownies that were waaaay better than these ??

I made this exactly as written without the chocolate chips because I wanted to taste the brownies themselves. These are very good brownies. For those who are worried about the amount of sugar, I just want to point out that any recipe calling for unsweetened cocoa will likely have a good amount of sugar to offset the bitterness of the cocoa. I did not find these brownies to be overly sweet and perhaps that's because I omitted the chocolate chips. One thing I always do when using cocoa is to "bloom" the cocoa by heating it. For this recipe I added the cocoa to the butter since I needed to melt the butter anyway, I left it on low heat, stirring constantly for 2 or 3 minutes after all the butter was melted. Then I took it off the heat, poured it into a bowl and let it cool while I measured my remaining ingredients. I only made a half batch since it's just myself and hubby, baked it at 330 degrees in a glass 8x8 dish for 27 minutes and they turned out perfect. Great texture, flavor and thickness. The only alteration I might try next time is to add a little espresso which elevates the chocolate flavor to a whole new level. Overall, this is a great recipe that does not need to be altered.

I’ve made this recipe many times and it always gets rave reviews! Chewy, chocolatee and delicious.! I always  add espresso powder for an extra kick.  So easy to make - haven’t used a box mix since I made my first batch.

I live at a high altitude and wasn't sure if I should adjust the recipe but ultimately followed directions. I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder (it's what I had on hand) but I wish I had used a regular cocoa powder. Dark cocoa powder made these slightly more bitter than I would have liked but that is my fault, not the recipe's. They are moist, dense, and using butter (not margarine) produces a flakey top. If you're planning to frost these, I'd use margarine (produces a smoother surface) so the frosting is easier to spread. Delicious.

First i tried the most popular cake brownie recipe here and realized i like chewy brownies better. I made these with the listed amounts of cocoa and sugar, but added in 3/4 cup walnuts. I waited an hour for these to cool and tried one. It was absolutely horrible. it tasted way too rich and bitter. I was pissed that i wasted my ingredients on this. I could only stomach a bite and that was it. gross. So then I went to bed.  The next afternoon, I was getting ready to throw out the ziplock full of these things but decided to take another bite. I was thinking perhaps if I reduced the cocoa it would be better. But when I tried them again, they were absolutely perfect. perfect chew, sweetness, and chocolate.  So what I learned is that this is the best recipe out there, but it needs 24 hours to rest so all the cocoa can be fully absorbed and you will be rewarded.  After the wait, these are fantastic. Next time i'll use butterscotch chips to try something different.  I hope these keep in the freezer.

I put in 1/2 less sugar.  These are good but I'm missing something.  Maybe nuts.  Next time.

This is my favorite brownie recipe. My husband adores it. I'm not  crazy into chocolate especially the darker it gets so I use half milk chocolate chips and half m&ms. It's a huge hit and great recipe!!

This is my go-to for brownies. They're a bit hit, every time I make 'em. Note that if you use an electric oven (which I do) (sadly), you'll need to cook 'em for five to ten minutes extra.

Ohhhhhh my goodness - SO delicious!! I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan. Also added 1/4tsp baking soda per other reviewer's suggestions. The only issue is that it kind of collapsed in the middle, leaving a huge crack down the center of the whole batch. Maybe if I made the whole  9x13 pan of them they wouldn't have done that. Whatever though, they tasted amazing!! (I'm one of those people who love cold desserts/chocolate, so I can't wait to try them tomorrow after they've sat in the fridge all night!) *UPDATE*. Yep. Even better the next day. Cold or zapped in the microwave for around 30secs. These are incredible.

I love the recipe, and so does my family. Although it comes off very sweet when I added the chocolate chips. It has a bit of a dry texture. But I would 100% make it again!

I chose to make these mainly because I had all the ingredients on hand, or so I thought. I was short an egg, but no matter.  They turned out great anyway. My only planned modification was to reduce the sugar, which I did. I used 1 cup each white and brown sugar. I don’t like overly sweet desserts, and even with the reduced sugar these were plenty sweet. I’ll make them again.

Excellent brownies!! I used others' suggestions and used white and brown sugar  as I didn't have enough white sugar. I added pecans just because I like nuts in my brownies. These brownies are perfect fudgy, chewy goodness!

Outstanding brownies! The best recipe I’ve ever tried. I cooked them for the full 40min, let them set for an hour, then turned upside down onto a cutting board and sliced with a serrated knife. Beautiful presentation. Thrilled with these!

They are good but they are VERY rich. So I had to cut it with some vanilla ice cream.

No changes, they were fudge like and very yummy.  It uses a lot of  sugar.  I will not make them again.

The first time I made these they came out so well, I made them shortly after for a party and they were a favourite. After that I made them a third time and they came out raw in the middle and burnt on the outside, this happened twice. Although I had a mishap there are many things that could have gone wrong so I still highly suggest everyone to make these.

I made them and followed the recipe. If I make them again I would decrease the cocoa powder and the sugar. 3 cups of sugar seems excessive to me .
Also there was too much chocolate.

Waaaaaaay too sweet. Next time I will reduce the sugar by half (or more!) Texture and ease was spot on. I used my convection oven at 325 and it took about 25 minutes.

These are very good, just insanely rich.  Only change I made was white chocolate chips (because that was what I had on hand).  There may have also been a small issue with the thickness of the brownies in the pan, since the edge seems a bit overdone compared to the middle, but that would just be experimenting with a different pan.  I'd make them again, but maybe find a way to dial down the richness, though my wife had no complaints.

I am a babysitter for two girls. They are 8 and 3. These brownies were super easy and fun to make! They are very yummy. . I chose this recipe because we did not have baking powder, and I promised the girls brownies.

First time making brownies from scratch so I was skeptical, but these were seriously the BEST brownies I ever had!  I didn't have chocolate chips so I put pecans in and it was very moist and great flavor!  I would recommend trying this recipe.

It was way to sweet! When I made it I didn't even put the full 3 cups and it was still too sweet for me to enjoy at all. The only reason I didn't  give  it 1 or 2 stars is because I suspect it would  taste good with a significant lower portion of sugar.

Delicious chewy brownies with a rich chocolate flavor. Used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and reduced white sugar to 1 1/4 cups.  Used dark chocolate chips and a cup of pecans. Perfection!  My family raved.

These are like some that I made years ago; I lost the recipe, I was thrilled when I found this one. The only difference is, I use all dark Chocolate, we prefer the genuinely intense flavor of the Dark Cocoa, with the deep flavor of pure dark chocolate chips. We prefer our deserts with less sweetness. Thank you for the basic recipe that has allowed me to tweak these delicious brownies.

I will probably make them again. They were really good  but a little too sweet. I didn't have all the right  ingredients though. That might have been the problem. I suggest making them because  they were really good.

These were a perfect set-up, but a bit too sweet. I'd reduce the sugar a bit next time and perhaps swap a bit more cocoa for less flour. Soooo Chewy!!!!

Everyone in the family loved them.  Personally, I still prefer the recipe on the box that the Baker's Unsweetened Chocolate provides.   These brownies are just a little too intense for me.

These brownies are little pieces of chocolate heaven! The recipe is super easy with very few ingredients. I made them with my daughters and the batter was complete and ready to go into the oven in five minutes. We used a smaller baking dish so it did take longer to cook but that was user error. The recipe called for 9x13. Seriously make these brownies and don't change a thing! I'm not buying box mix again.

My daughter made these for me for my birthday! They were everything I wanted them to be. It was the right balance of cakey vs fudgey. I was in chocolate heaven! The sweetness was on point and then the bonus of the chocolate chips. She used dark chocolate chips. My daughter added walnuts to  the recipe because hey, brownies need walnuts! I enjoyed my brownies with a scoop of ice-cream and a drizzle of chocolate fudge on top while still warm. It tasted like a restaurant dessert!  Even my husband, who doesn't care for brownies, loved them! It really was a very happy birthday for me!

These were very good. They were very rich with strong chocolate flavor.  My son gave them a 4 rating because of the little bit of crunch on top. My husband and I liked the crunch and very rich chocolate flavor.

This is my go-to brownie recipe now. Any other and they're just not as good. These are deliciously fudgy and rich, chewy around the edge. If you like a cake-like or fudge-like brownie I would try another recipe.

Everyone loved it, even my wife (who doesn't like brownies very much)  I convinced her to try a little  piece. After that she was hooked!

I make these brownies often. I use  1.5 cups of chocolate chip morsels instead of 1 cup.  Sometimes I'll mix in peanut butter morsels. If you like your brownies more like cake these are the way to go. I haven't made them with walnuts yet, but everyone loves them and they go fast :)

Pretty good. Chewy texture and the sugar crystallizes a bit within the brownie which adds to the flavor.

I just wanted a smaller treat and not have a whole batch of these things around, so I made a 1/4 recipe. I put in 1/4 tsp of baking soda but other than that, I followed the recipe... except I forgot to put the chocolate chips in! Over all, it was really good, even though I forgot the chocolate chips. I made 6 cupcake sized portions but I should have made 7 because they spilled over. Since I was using a convection oven, I reduced the temp to 325F and baked them for 25 minutes, which was perfect. I didn't find them too sweet and I don't typically like sweet treats.

To me personally brownies are the most easy dessert to make and a go to dessert when you want something that is quick to make but is delicious at thew same time. Also, from the video I watched about how to make brownies the only thing I would change that she added was expresso shots but other that the video I watched I wouldn't  change anything about the original ingredients in howe to make brownies. From the other comments I read and seen everyone else loves the brownies because mostly everyone rated them a 5 star. A good side that goes great with brownies is ice ,I personally prefer chocolate it just tops off the whole dessert so, I recommend brownies to anyone who loves chocolate and want to make something quick and easy.

I made these as directed using extra-large eggs (I think large is the industry standard for recipes). The texture is the best I've come across (and I'm on a quest to find the perfect brownie recipe). The inside stays together and is super moist and fudgy, and the outside is crisp--maybe a bit *too* crisp. The outside is where I particularly noticed the absence of oil. It is borderline tough. I used Ghirardelli chocolate throughout, but will go back to Pernigotti unsweetened cocoa powder; nothing equals it, IMO (Williams-Sonoma, Whole Foods, etc.) Finally,  I also thought they were a touch too sweet (and I have a sweet tooth). Next time I'm going to cut back sugar 1/4 cup and maybe add a touch of espresso powder. For now, this is my new go-to recipe. Thanks, Brooke!

I made the recipe as described the first time.  I shared with guests and asked for their honest critique.  Everyone enjoyed the rich dark chocolate flavor.  The only suggestion was from my grandson who said it really didn’t need the chocolate chips because it was so chocolaty already!  Yes, I will make again...this is now my “go to” brownie recipe!

Wonderful brownies!  I was looking for fudgy brownies, and these definitely fit the bill.  They are very sweet, and I would suggest cutting them in small pieces.  They were excellent with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

I used organic raw cane sugar instead of white sugar and lessened the amout of sugar by about half a cup, which was still very sweet. The sugar has its own taste but my boyfriend and I love it. I used milk chocolate chips and lightly tossed them in flour before adding them to the batter so they wouldn't fall to the bottom and it worked! I halved the amount of butter and substituted in plain yogurt, lowered the amount of salt to around 3/4 of a tsp and used himalayan pink salt because it was the only salt I had, and added a 1/2 tsp of baking soda to create a crispy top which worked wonders. When I cut into the brownie, the knife crackled the top easily and then dove like butter into the fudgy inside! I also used gluten free flour because it was the only flour I had, and if you like the consistency of it it's wonderful and gives it little bits of chewy(?) goodness, maybe like a moist cornmeal? My boyfriend went nuts for this brownie and overall I will make it again, maybe healthier next time haha!

These are delicious.  I cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and they are still super sweet.  Would go to 2 cups next time.  Baked for 35 min.and they are perfect.

These are our new favorite.  I added one cup pecans to the batter and topped with a sprinkling of sea salt before baking.  We've also drizzled with caramel.

I've been trying various online & cookbook brownie recipes for the last few years trying to find one we really liked.  This has ended my search.  

I had some mint/chocolate chips to use up and wanted a good brownie recipe to put them it - these were the best brownies I've ever had.I read the reviews, an made a few changes - I decreased the sugar from 3 cups to 2.5 - used half brown sugar/half white. I used dark cocoa because that's what I had.  Also added 1/4 tsp of coffee extract to enhance the chocolate.  Baked at suggested temp in convection oven for 15 minutes less than suggested, then topped with 1.5 cups of Andes mint/chocolate chips and let melt.  When cooled, cut & ate we ate every single one.  I will be making these brownies way, way too often in the future.

I volunteered myself to make brownies, thinking that I had a box mix in the pantry....oops!  So I had to go scratch with what I had on hand.  Man were these the right choice!  I subbed brown sugar for the white, and used butter flavored crisco for the butter.  Topped with Heath bits and some Himalayan pink salt before baking.  WOW!  My dinner guests were almost fighting over them!  Will definitely be making these again and again!

I didn’t make any changes and they were great. Chewy chocolatey and delicious. I had sixty year olds eating like teenagers. I’m not a total chocolate fan, but these were good. I suppose I might add walnuts cause I love em.

This probably would have been 5 stars if I had not added 1 cup less of sugar due to previous reviews. Next time I will add all of the sugar for a sweet, delicious brownie.

At first, I was unsure about the lack of any rising agent and how thick the batter was. However, I was pleasantly delighted at how chewy and fudgy these brownies are! Like other reviews said, they are intensely sweet, and I can only eat small pieces at a time. I would make again, but maybe back off the sugar to 2 and a half or 2 and a third cups instead of 3.

These were fantastic. I was told I could enter them into a competition! I did add one thing though. I mixed 8oz cream cheese with 1/3 c. Sugar and 1 egg and added to the top in a few areas. Oh, and cooking time was at least 50% longer than stated. Didn’t burn anything though.

By far the best brownie recipe I’ve found. I was a little leery about trying it because it had no baking soda or baking powder. I thought it would be a batch of bricks. They turned out pretty great. I have found my go to recipe for brownies.

I made a recipe of these topped with Blonde Brownie I, doubled.  I made the Blonde dough first and put it in the fridge while I made the brownie batter, then dropped the cookie dough in blobs over the brownies, topped with bittersweet chocolate chips (the extra dark kind).  Baked at 350 just until set, and they turned out AMAZING!   We are calling them Brookies.

Easy and SO good!! I was low on white sugar and used a cup of sugar in the raw, added walnuts, cranberries and dark chocolate chips. I've abandoned all other brownie recipes!

Great texture and chocolate flavor but they are so sweet that it almost takes away from the chocolate flavor.  Way to sweet for my crew.  Even my kids said they were too sweet, which is definitely saying something.  Next time I will cut the sugar and hope the texture stays the same.

Made as written but had to use crisco en lieu of butter as it's all I had on hand. These were ok... loved how chewy they were, but they were way too sugary for my taste. There were a few other issues, but I think they were more because of my oven than the recipe itself.

This is the best brownie recipe I've tried! These brownies are like fudge, but not. They are SO chocolatey, and plenty sweet. I didn't change the recipe at all, except that I didn't sift anything, just threw the ingredients in a bowl- and they came out perfect! They were gone in a few days and I am about to make more.

I have made these at least 5 times. The only change I have made is adding 1 tsp. baking soda. I love them so much and they are always a hit. To me this is THE brownie recipe. If you like fudgy, rich, chocolatey brownies follow the recipe and you will be happy. I have also added chopped up reece's cups, just go wild!

Wonderful brownies. I did the 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar as my other fav brownie recipe uses half of each.  I didn't think these were overly sweet (for brownies!), but they are dense and very, very rich. One small brownie goes a long way.  For all those who reviewed this by saying they got sick just looking at the amount of butter and sugar, I think the recipe you are looking for is "steamed broccoli". lol.

I decided at the last minute to make these for a super bowl party and I loved that it required so few ingredients, all of which I had on hand.  

HOWEVER...

I also had way too many s'more ingredients in the house, so I crushed together 6 graham crackers, a couple cups of mini marshmallows and broke apart a couple Hershey bars and sprinkled that on the top after the brownies had already baked about 20 minutes.  I then continued baking them the remainder of time needed.

OH....MY.....GOODNESS!!!  They were absolutely decadent!!!  

Fabulous!  Definitely doing this one again.

I made this recipe with some suggested changes from the reviews and using gluten free flour. Two cups of sugar is more than enough for these brownies, 3 cups is a cup too many. I also added 1/2 tsp baking soda. These were then perfect for my family and disappeared before I knew it.

These brownies were awesome!  I used 1.5 cup brown sugar and 1.5 cup of white. After I baked them, I put the pan directly in the fridge for an hour. I used 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of chopped  walnuts. Chewy,  chocolate loveliness !

Absolute best recipe I've found for brownies. I like a brownie with a little cake-like texture, but still moist and chewy. These are just that. I usually pipe frosting on top after I've either cut them into squares or occasionally with a cookie cutter. A little frosting makes them even more special. I get rave reviews every time I bring these to an event. They are very rich, so one is usually enough for me.

The only way I ever make brownies now! Sometimes, if I'm struggling to get it all mixed , I add 0.5-1 Tbsp. of water. That does the trick. I also add 3/4 c walnuts. Otherwise recipe is perfection

These are amazing.  I made a couple of changes after reading reviews.  I used half white sugar and half brown  sugar as well as 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  I always freeze the leftovers after cooking them and just thaw them as needed.

Nice & fudgy. I made them 3 times already. This recipe halves beautifully! The second time I made them I cut the sugar to 2 2/3 cup. Like that much better. Third time I kept the whole 3 cups of sugar but added 1.5 teaspoon of espresso powder. Liked that way too! If you've never been successful making homemade brownies, this is a recipe you should try.

These were SOOO good! I made half the recipe, just to try it out, see if my family liked it. I wish I doubled the recipe, they were gone in a day! I have tried several other recipes, they have all ended up tasting like squares of cake. Definitely not this one, it was dense and rich.  Better than the box, I definitely will make these again, maybe it will become my go-to recipe. Though I did make some minor changes. I used a half cup of brown sugar and a cup of white. For a full recipe that would be a  cup of brown sugar and 2 cups of white sugar. I also doubled thew amount of vanilla. That is just my preference, I am a vanilla addict. Thanks!!!! :)

These came out extremely delicious. This will be my go to recipe for brownies. Definitely better than boxed mix. I didn't have butter so I substituted it with 3/4 cup vegetable oil. I also added 1 1/2 tsps of baking powder to fluff it up. & I also split the 3 cups of sugar with half white & half brown sugar. & these are still the best brownies I've tried.

These were wonderful!  They are like a brownie fudge hybrid.  The rich, soft texture is divine.  I made mine into turtle brownies by topping them with 1C of semi sweet chocolate morsels and 3/4 C of chopped pecans prior to baking.  I then drizzled my warm pan of brownies with a Carmel sauce I made using 1C of Carmel Bites and 2T of milk prepared in the microwave at 1 minute on high, stirring, then 10 second intervals until the Carmel was nice and creamy.  These turned out so amazing that I’m making more to take to my folks and my Sister as a just because I love you surprise.

Completed as directed, and very delicious! I did cut my time a little early as not to over bake because I like chewy, soft brownies. The brownies turned out soft, thick and chocolatey rich even in a 9x13” pan (which is definitely needed to hold all of the batter). My husband recommended adding walnuts, perhaps for next time. Thank you for the recipe! Top notch!

Great brownies but what a pain getting them out of the pan! They were sweet but served with Haagen Daz, (not as sweet as many vanilla ice creams) it was the perfect match.

These brownies are what I have been looking for!
FYI:
I reduced the amount of Sugar into 2 cups only.

I also reduced the flour into 1 and 1/3 cup instead of 1 and 1/2.

Also. I did not take her advice about the oven's temperature, I estamated it on my own! I kept a tin foil above to avoid it from overcooked or burning. WORTH TO TRY

My daughter and I made these for Christmas. We got rave reviews! Everyone loved them. They are fudgy, chocolatey, and way better than their boxed counterparts. And sooo easy to make. I’m so glad I found this recipe. I’ll never buy that boxed mix again.

These brownies are delicious! I accidentally used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, which may have cut down on the sweetness a bit. I did everything else exactly as the recipe says, baked for 40 minutes, and they turned out perfect. Easy to make and soooooo good!

I made these brownies, but had to make a few adjustments to the recipe.  First of all, I cut out a half cup of the sugar just because we don’t like to consume so much sugar.  Then, I only had three eggs , and didn’t want to buy more since we will be leaving for out winter home shortly.  Because of that, I also cut the flour by half a cup.  Surprisingly, these brownies turned out great.  They are dense, very chocolatey  and not too sweet.

Just what I wanted!  And I used cacao powder instead of cocoa powder and 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  Turned out perfectly sweet and chocolatey.

To me these were a little bland. Definitely came out thick and decadent tasting but would be much better with some walnuts or dark chocolate pieces mixed in. Will try this recipe again with a few tweaks!

My go-to from-scratch recipe.  I don't know how many times I've made these at this point, but feel the need to add to the long list of amazing reviews. Fudgy and gooey is the only way brownies should be, these are better than any box mix you can find.  After trying this, you'll see boxes as second class.  :)

I followed the recipe exactly. There is something missing. I can’t put my finger on it. Maybe depth of flavor? Next time I’d consider dropping back the sugar or using some brown sugar.  The texture was perfect - really thick and moist (I know - people hate that word - sorry!).

Made as recipe stated and were perfect.  Not to thin or thick. Perfect fudgie chewy brownie.  I am not one to frost or add chocolate chips to my brownies, but I did here and the chocolate chips really made the brownie for me.  Mine didn't harden over night as others have said.   And I think they were better the next day as well.

Super crumbly. Taste is bland, but as the other reviews say, this is not a sugary recipe. If you want a simple, chewy apricot bar, this is the recipe for you.

Delicious! I baked them for 35 minutes, and, like another reviewer said, the chocolate chips may stick to the knife when you test, but be sure to take them out at that time. They are very moist and have a great chocolate flavor.

I am new at baking and this was my very first time to bake brownies. I am glad I chose this recipe. I would say it turned out  good... It was easy to prepare, I added 2 cup sugar instead of 3 cup and that worked just the way I wanted...

Was ok. Not exactly what I am looking for. I want a mixture of a little bit of cakeness plus chewy fudge. I have had them, I know there is a recipe somewhere. My coworkers devoured them though. Most of them would give these 5 stars. I might have given 4 stars but the next day the texture changed and they were almost inedible.

I wouldnt even give it one star. The obscene amount of sugar gives them a grainy texture. All you can taste is sugar, definitely not enough chocolate either, you cant even taste it

Like a fellow reviewer I am only giving 1 star so that bakers know that for this recipe the toothpick test will not work. This is because of the morsels. They will always leave the toothpick covered in chocolate no matter how long you cook. Instead move the pan back and fourth and watch the waves of the brownie firm up to a solid state and you will know its done. Great recipe otherwise!

Very good moist and fudgy recipe. Great warm with some vanilla ice cream. Only thing I didn’t like is how crunchy the top gets once they are cooled off.

These brownies are amazing. The only thing that I didn't add was the chocolate chips. I wanted to see what they tasted like without the added chocolate chips. This recipe is perfect.

They were delicious! I took them to work and all the ladies loved them! Very rich, but that is not a bad thing! Not sure why but I had to cook the brownies for 50 minutes until they were done that’s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

Best brownies we have ever made.  My kids love them, and my family too.  They are fudgy and gooie, everything you hope a brownie to be.  Sometimes we use gourmet milk chocolate chips.  Both ways are YUM YUM YUM!

Made exactly as recipe stated and horrible. Honestly the taste was very interesting you could force yourself to eat it if mixed with ice cream or caramel drizzled over...however, Betty Crocker still winner. The texture was very cakey and then dry...it tasted like a dried out, flaky nasty chocolate cake.

Brownie foodie snob here. Chocoholic. Baking for 40+ years. Just trying to find a brownie recipe better than the one I've used for years. If you like a salt explosion in your brownies, this might be the recipe for you. The salt even overtook the sugar. Had to throw the pan away.

Oh!!!! Talk about rich, chewy, fudgy brownies! They are moist and have the best taste. I love this recipe. Since it calls for a lot of sugar, I knew not to meddle with it, and used unsweetened chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. 

These brownies had the crinkly top that most boxed brownies have. I must say these are the best brownies ever!

Delish!  I kept the sugar the same(ish) and added 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to make them rise a little. I realized 1/2 way through mixing that I was out of vanilla so I substituted 1/2 teaspoon almond extract.   This will be my go to brownie recipe from now on!

I made these adjustments: 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar instead of 3 cup white sugar; 1/2 tsp almond extract; 1/2 tsp baking soda; 1 cup chopped walnuts in addition to the 1 cup chocolate chips in the recipe. Were a hit, but I might skip on the baking soda and almond extract next time for fudgier, more classic brownies.

Made half recipe, used 9x9 pan.  These are great brownies.  Very dark and rich, watch cooking time, don't over cook.  Easy to make, used heavy whisk w/o problem,  and added about 1/3 c. of walnuts.  Next time I'll use an 8x8 pan for thicker brownies, but  still very very good!  I will make these again!

These truly are the best brownies if you like them moist, sweet, and chocolaty like I do. I've made them a bunch of times, both for myself and my family and also as gifts- everyone loves them and asks for more! I will definitely be making them again!

I am so happy I found this recipe. They are very rich and delicious. I decided to just use a cup of brown sugar and a cup of reg sugar instead of 3 full cups of sugar. I under baked just a tad (some people complained about the brownies drying out) and they were outstanding. I tossed the chocolate chips in flour so they wouldn't sink, and used mini semi-sweet chips. This will be my new brownie recipe!

Make this recipe today!!  For over 30 years I have been searching for a homemade brownie recipe that tastes at least as good as the one in the red box with the initials B.C. (not sure if I can mention brand names on a review). This recipe is it!!!! My kids even took some brownies to school to share with friends.  They were excited that  a homemade recipe FINALLY topped the red box too.  I followed the recipe as it is written.  Although the substitution of brown sugar sounds good, these brownies are absolutely perfect as written.  I even took "brownies" off of my pinterest tags. I now have the recipe for the best brownies my family and I have ever tasted.  Thanks Brooke!

Oh. My. BROWNIE. Finally, a fudgy brownie recipe that is easy. This is the one you have been looking for. I didn't make any substitutions. The only change I need was one of personal preference; I used a slightly smaller pan (8.5 x 11). This would have been fine in the larger pan; they are thick and gooey enough to be thinner. These are AMAZING! Perfect recipe that will be my go to in the future!

I used Country. Crook they were delicious l didn't have butter. They were chewy and maybe part of it might have been a little undercooked. and the edges. a little. over cooked. Maybe it was the oven maybe l should. have cooked it a little bit more. But still delicious l waited maybe 8 minutes to eat the first one.Nice and warm.

great texture and chocolate taste, bit too sweet for my liking. I would cut back on sugar next time.

Thank you for sharing this recipe - it was delicious! I substituted half of the white sugar for brown sugar. I also didn't have vanilla extract, so I substituted pancake syrup as was suggested on the internet. Still turned out great :). I'll definitely make this again.

No changes required.  It's perfection.  I often half the recipe and use an 8x8 square pan too.  Thick, chewy brownies.  Perfect!

This is the perfect brownie recipe! My only addition is a teaspoon of cinnamon powder to the dry mix. I make it in an all edge brownie pan.  I have been asked to make it again by anyone that tries a square. PERFECTION!

I have a big sweet tooth and brownies are my favorite dessert. This recipe disappointed me. All I could taste was the sugar, it overpowered the chocolate. The edges were good but I just didn't like the rest. My husband and kids thought they were good so at least they won't be wasted.

Best brownie ever! I have had people tell me that they are a little too sweet, but that is just personal preference. If you don't like too sweet, take some sugar out.

Best brownies in the world!! I was on a quest to find the most delicious, fudgy, and decadent brownies, and these sure hit the mark! I halved the recipe and baked the brownies in an 8x8 pan for 25 minutes. They were perfect to get out of the pan and very easy to cut. I was a bit concerned about the sweetness so I just decreased the amount by 1/4 cup, it was perfect for me. In conclusion, these will be the only brownies I’ll ever make from now on!

I will so make this recipe again and again.  In fact, this is my new go-to brownie.  The amazing thing about this recipe is that it makes a crunchy cookie-type layer across the top and the center is fudge-y, without being dough-y.  Some described it as between cake-like and fudge-like, which is what won me in the first place.  The only thing i changed about this recipe is that i omitted the chocolate chips and replaced with one and a half cups black walnuts.  Oh, they are divine!  I will never make another brownie: this one is it!

These are hands-down the best brownies I've ever tasted. They are ridiculously-chocolatey-rich, thick, and chewy with that delectable, necessary shell of crisp on top that names your heart go pitter-patter when you bite into a brownie.. I followed another reviewer's advice to add 1/2 tsp of baking soda to encourage the shell, and I think it definitely made the difference. Be aware that this is basically a double-batch, hence the large quantities of ingredients.

OMG There is a terrible thing going on with these brownies. They are the most addictive things I've ever eaten. I start and cannot stop, especially when I throw them in the microwave for 30 seconds, drop a scoop (or two or three) of blue bell vanilla ice cream and drizzle it with Ghirardelli chocolate syrup. By far, the best brownies EVER! 
I did make a few adjustments to the recipe. I used 1/2 c. Hersheys Special Dark cocoa powder and a 1/2 c. Hersheys unsweetened cocoa powder. I also doubled the chocolate chips. We like it rich! 
Oh so good!

I made these exactly as the recipe goes but did have to add about an additional 10 minutes on to the bake time. I do have a vintage 1960s oven though so it could have been my oven.

omg this  turned out so good the best recipe ive tried so far not only for brownies but overall. seriously we all loved it and all that sugar was worth it. i wanted to go with peoples suggestions and did half brown and half white sugar which was ok and tested some of the batter with a much smaller mould and they didnt turn out so good so id recommend not changing the pan size. i added 4 tbsp nutella instead of choc chips so u can give that a try it was good (a change i made on myself)

I made the recipe as written. Today I took these brownies to a work potluck.  The positive response was overwhelming.  Everyone really enjoyed these, whether plain or ala mode ( I brought Breyer's 'homemade' vanilla ice cream to go with).  I think these are really rich and fudgy, which is how I like my brownies. I used 60% cacao chocolate chips (a shade past semi-sweet on the scale) and that adds both richness and takes the edge off the sweetness.

These really are excellent thick, fudgy, chewy, non-cakelike brownies. This recipe will replace the Ghirardelli's brownies mix that we buy at Costco. I left out the salt because I use salted butter and my experience tells me that for my palette, this is the right thing; but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.

I love this recipe. I left out the chocolate chips (because I didn't have any) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly but added walnuts and these brownies turned out perfectly.  I think this will be my new go to  recipe for brownies!  Makes a big batch  and taste even better the next day.

I followed the recipe as written and they turned out perfectly. Everybody raved about them, even my picky husband who doesn't really like sweets. They are crunchy around the edges and soft and chewy gooey in the middle. So much chocolate flavor! Yum yum!

The best brownie recipe I have found, has been made many times in my house. I always add white chocolate chips as well, just to keep it interesting.  Delicious :)

Followed the recipe almost exactly. Just replaced the chocolate chips with chopped up good quality chocolate to give the brownies a lift. Lovely consistency and very easy to make.

This taste just as good if not better than boxed mix. It bakes with a nice crusty top and is very chewy and fudgy on the inside.  I used Hershey's specialty dark cocoa and I added marshmallows and graham (because I wanted s'mores brownies).  Would definitely make again.

These where so amazing, chocolaty, moist, and decedent! I added chocolate chips just before I put it in the oven, mine needed to bake for 10 minutes longer I believe because I added the chips. But for me and my family this recipe is spot on and delicious!!

These are really awesome but they are too sweet. The sugar over powers the chocolate. I just reduced the sugar by 3/4 cup last time and didn't use the full quantity of chips and they came out much better, more chocolate flavor came through.

If you like greasy foods that are extremely rich this would be a good recipe for you.  Way too much sugar and butter for my taste though.  Instead of wanting another brownie I found myself wishing I hadn't wronged myself with the first one.  Also, the toothpick test does not work well with this recipe since it is so greasy and full of chocolate.  My toothpicks were still coming out with goo after 35 minutes of baking, and the edges were all burned.  The actual flavor is not too bad if you can get past all the sugar, so it gets 2 stars for that.

Absolutely delicious! I cut back a little on the sugar, and only did 2 1/2 cups. I also used a combination of dark chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips. It was perfect.

These are some of the worst brownies I've ever tasted. I followed the recipe exactly except I ended up baking them longer because they were too fudgy for my liking.
And way too sweet.  It's like eating thick sugary chocolatey glue.

First, I have to admit I really don't like brownies. I made these for the SO and kiddo. Like other reviewers I used 1 1/2 cups ea brown and white sugar. I also floured the chocolate chips before adding them to the batter. Didn't change anything else. We dug in while they were still steaming hot from the oven and I wasn't impressed-however after cooling for a bit, they turned into the fudgiest, moistest, most delicious brownies I've ever had. This recipe is a keeper!

Oh my goodness. These are dark, dense, rich, and fudgy. I made 1/2 a batch in an 8x8 square pan. It's a good thing too, or I would have eaten a whole batch. I ended up cooking them for 40 minutes and the toothpick didn't come out quite clean but my husband and daughter wouldn't wait longer. This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is great but could be a bit too sweet! I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of 3 cups of white sugar.  I added chopped almonds and chunks of unsweetened chocolate bars (from Trinidad where I'm from). The unsweetened chocolate bars added some bitterness like dark chocolate chunks. But the bitterness is just in the chunks so the rest of the brownie is sweet. For me, this add more dimension to an already great recipe!

Loved this recipe!  We didn't have enough chocolate chips the first time we made it and didn't have any the second time we made them but who cares! They were great! Had a nice chew around the edges. Yummy!  And we cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan

Family favorite! I added nuts to half of the pan because of family agreeing to disagree, and both sides of the spectrum loved it! No changes needed, and I recommend it if you love easy-to-make, delicious looking and tasting brownies! Definitely didn't expect this bombshell.

This is my go to recipe for a chocolate fix, they keep for around 3 days until they go hard (but still taste fine, if they aren't eaten yet.) great without any toppings or with, add some coffee extract or coffee grounds for a richer flavor.

Delicious and very easy recipe. Not as sweet as others are saying. I did over baked them a little because the toothpick kept coming out dirty. Definitely keep an eye on the edges.

These came out WAY too sweet. I'm definitely cutting back on the sugar next time. Maybe try the 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar since that seemed  be a big hit in the reviews. The texture is great though. The taste is good. My teeth just hurt. Once I make the changes, I think this could be a five star recipe.

Delicious!
I changed 2 things: 
3/4 cup cocoa powder &
Milk chocolate chips. 
Just my own personal preference. They are wonderful, moist, and chocolaty. I'm defiantly keeping this as my go to brownie recipe.

Best. Brownies. Ever. Fudgy, rich and addictive. I have officially adopted this as my go to. The only adjustment I made was adding a teaspoon of instant coffee for flavor but otherwise, it was perfection.

I didn't like brownies and did not understand what the fuss was about till I made this recipe.   chewy, crispy on top, packed with chocolate flavor.   The ONLY chocolate brownie recipe you will ever need.

I read a few of the reviews before I baked it and made a few adjustments.  Instead of 3 cups, I used 2 1/2 cups of white sugar.   I also reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and added 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  If your family is as impatient as mine I would recommend you make this batch when you're home alone so it can cool sufficiently before cutting. The texture was perfect!  Very good recipe for the novice baker!

I love chewy brownies... we added raspberry extract (1 tsp) and changed the vanilla to 1 tsp.  Then swirled in some raspberry preserves before we baked it.  It was rich.  Perfect served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  We will make these again.  Great, rich core recipe.

Absolutely delicious! So simple to make and you get an end result of rich and gooey brownie. I used 1 1/2 C brown sugar and 1 1/2 C white sugar, rather than all white sugar. I also added butterscotch chips because that's all I had, turned out great!

I found the texture of these perfect - chewy and fudgey. I made it with half white and half brown sugar and milk chocolate chips. I found it way too sweet. I would make it again but I would reduce the sugar to two cups and use either semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips (I think dark mini chips would be perfect). I also added in pecans which were a yummy addition.

I have been baking for years , so I am not a novice.  My co-workers always ask me to bake their birthday cakes for them.  I am also asked for my recipes.    I read this Brownie recipe first then watched the video.  it  seemed simple enough so  I made this brownie recipe today.  It is  the worst recipe I have ever made !!    The Brownies came out like bricks on top and on the bottom with a mushy center.  I had to chisel them to remove them from my pan which was sufficiently greased !  By so doing I have now ruined my baking pan.   I recently made your blueberry coffee cake  which came out perfect and delicious. However this brownie recipe is very,very  disappointing.   I had to throw it out , what a waste of ingredients !

The texture is wonderful but it's too sweet! I ate a tiny corner to sample, and the sugar rush is too intense. I just taste sugar all throughout. Maybe doing half brown, half white like other reviewers suggested works better.

The only change I made was 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.   I thought these were excellent and just get better with time although they are not lasting that long!!!  I will make again and might add some walnuts.

These brownies are amazing! I baked them for 40 minutes but they were probably done at 35 min. The edges were crunchy (my other half thought they were overcooked but I like the crunchy edges).  They were delightfully chocolatey and chewy!

I've made brownies from several different mixes, including Ghirardelli (that's my favorite mix).  I've also made cocoa brownies from an old Betty Crocker cookbook, which are rather cake-y.  This recipe is 100x better!

These brownies are the best homemade brownies I have made.  I did a little less than 1 1/2 c. white and a little less than 1 1/2 c. light brown sugar.  Made everything else as directed except used mini semi-sweet chips.  I baked in a 9x11" glass dish to make them thicker, and it took 50-55 min total baking time at 325 degrees.

I have been looking for a brownie recipe for quite some time! I love to bake and brownies had been the one thing I couldn't get right. But this recipe was the one!!! The only switch I did was did part milk chocolate chips and then some snickers bites! My husband LOVES them and I do too!

These are the absolute best brownies I have ever had!! My only critique is that they were done after about 25 minutes, if I had kept them in the oven for 35 they would have lost their fudgy-ness. Other than that, perfect!!

These are good. Lots of sugar. I had to bake it for an extra 10 minutes, so 50 minutes altogether. Good baked edges.

These brownies contain all of the elements to a perfect brownie, in my opinion. It's perfectly fudge-y,  it's not too bitter, and it practically melts in your mouth!

Very impressed ! The brownies were delicious...  I subbed 1 1/2 cup white sugar as suggested by other reviewers and I think the sweetness was perfect. Besides that adjustment the brownies cooked perfectly... only complaint I have is that they weren't as fudgy as I would've preferred and as stated in alot of the reviews ... they were almost cakey.. maybe I made an error somewhere.. anyways delicious and easy.

The brownies were good. The only change I would make is the amount of sugar. They are very sweet. I would only put 2 cups of sugar in the batter next time. The consistency is perfect and the moisture is great. Just a little sweet. May add sea salt on the top next time.

I followed the recipe but they are like rocks! I then read reviews.Maybe a metal pan would have worked better. I thought they were too thick and very hard. I didn't like the chocolate chips being in them either. As for sweetness, that was the best part. I'm sure glad I wasn't taking them to a gathering!

I didn't have chocolate chips! It didn't matter - they're fabulous! Don't overcook! You want them a bit on the chewy side.

I made this after reading all the reviews carefully and diligently. 
I've noticed so many people mentioned the level of sweetness of this recipe. I like sweet things but just occasionally. 
So, instead of using 3 cups of white sugar, I replaced it with 2 cups of brown sugar and guess what? It was still sweet to me. But it's the kinda sweet that I kinda able to stand.
Plus, I always like my brownies to be a little bit cake-y, thus using the cake method instead (beating butter with sugar etc). So the result was satisfying! Sweet still, but at least I managed to settle my craving for good ol' brownies!

These brownies are amazing. I made in a 9x13 cake pan and used 1 cup brown sugar and 2 cups regular sugar. We ate them about an hour after coming out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Followed this recipe to the letter and after 40 mins in the oven it was not cooked at all. The top looked done and the toothpick test was def not clean...some reviewers said the toothpick will not come out clean so I took them out bc I did not want to overbake. I let them cool about 15 mins. When I cut thru them the batter was still that...batter. What did I do wrong?! The temp was at 350, left them in for 40 mins and I used all the ingredients listed. I don't want to give it 1 star bc it most likely was something I did. I think? ??

Amazing brownies!!
They were a little challenging to put together and stir (I hand mixed it and have a kink in my shoulder); but it was so worth it!
I skipped adding the chocolate chips just so it wasn't overly sweet (I made them for my grandparents) and after about 38 min in the oven they came out perfect, the top is crisp and the middle is fudgy and not too sweet! My favorite brownie recipe so far!

Changes: 1) Didn't sift anything, just mixed it all up and 2) dark chocolate cocoa

Short & Sweet Review: These were very rich and very sweet (I cut them into 15 pieces and I can only have one at a time). The toothpick didn't come out clean after 50 minutes in the oven, and I hope I didn't overcook them or undercook them. They seem fine but also very gooey (not as dry as other brownies I've had before).

I followed the suggestion from previous reviewers and added in 1/2 tsp. baking soda, and then used only half of the salt- this made the top layer absolutely perfect! 

I did leave out the chocolate chips though, because I don't like anything in my brownies.

I baked this in a 10 inch cast iron skillet, and the edges and bottom turned out perfectly chewy. 

These small changes made this recipe my absolute favorite! I just deleted all of the other brownie recipes that I was planning to try, because this is the one! These turned out fudgey and chewy, and so much better than anything out of a box. My search is officially over, and I'll be making these again and again.

I love this recipe.   The only thing I will chane the next time I make them is that I will cut the sugar by half.  They were too sweet for me.  My family loved them as is.  Hopefully,  they will love them with half the sugar too.  Great recipe!

I made this exactly as written and they turned out great.  They have a crunchy outside and are fudgy (not gooey) on the inside.  Definitely a keeper.  These are one of the few brownie recipes where they actually cooked all the way into the middle of the pan without overcooking the edges.

Bomb.com! 
I've made this a couple of times now and every time it comes out to protection. Last night I added 1/4 cup bittersweet chocolate chips to the melting butter and it really improved the richness of the chocolate.

It's no lie! These ARE the bomb! Good brownies are really hard to find. I've got 1 or 2 tried and true recipes ... THESE are right up there with the BEST. We all can stop searching NOW! Chewy, chocolatey, perfection! I used about 2 2/4 cup sugar rather than 3 cups. I always like to cut down on the sugar. Could probably go further but I was being cautious with this first batch. Next time I will.

I think this was a great base recipe. I wanted one that used cocoa powder not syrup. I did make a few changes, instead of 4 eggs, I used  2 eggs and 1/2 cup plain yogurt, used 1 cup butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil, and only 2 cups sugar, 1 cup white and 1 cup unrefined coconut palm sugar. Baked for 37 mins, but could have done 35. They came out very moist and delicious. My family loved them.

For the most part, I followed CookinginFL's take on this recipe. Although, I did make my own alterations. I used salted butter and sweetened cocoa powder, I didn't add the teaspoon of salt, and I used white chocolate chips. These brownies came out just as fudge-like as anticipated, if not more so. I recommend cutting the brownies into small squares because they are so dense and rich. I was told eating half of a brownie felt like they had eaten a whole one. However, be very cautious of hard edges and a hard brownie bottom. I personally don't like crunchy edges, so I cut them off since they could not be avoided.

These brownies are the bomb! I made it for New Years Eve and everyone loved my brownies. I received compliments from our relatives. I used Dutch-processed cocoa powder instead of natural because it's so much cheaper in the market. Idk if the taste would differ if I used natural cocoa powder instead of the alkalized. I'm so glad I found this recipe, this is the third time I changed my brownie recipe and I swear this is going to be the last because I finally found the best brownie recipe ever!!! Much better than the commercially bought brownies. ??

The brownie was great but 3 cups of sugar seemed a bit too much and it made the brownies way too sweet. I halved the sugar and they tasted perfect.

Follow the recipe as is and you will have delicious and substantial brownies! I have subbed melted chocolate for part of the cocoa when I was running low and discovered that it is a delightful variation as well. Basically you can't go wrong here - these brownies ARE bomb.

I prefer more chewy fudge-like type brownies with crisp edges.  These did not come out that way.  I followed what others said about 1 cup white sugar & 1 cup brown sugar.  Glad I did so as it's pretty sweet & I can't imagine using 3 cups of sugar total.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and am disappointed.  This came out more cake-like.  Plus the cocoa powder taste is overwhelming.  It doesn't taste chocolately despite adding the chips.  I think I want to try a recipe where I actually melt chocolate into the batter instead.  Also, baking for the minimum 35 minutes, the toothpick came out completely clean which means it may have already been over cooked.  So I can't say I'll make this one again, but if you like more cake-like brownies, this might work for you.

Hi - had trouble with mine and not sure what went wrong. The taste was good but dry texture and burnt edges below the time limit. My only guess is that my oven temperature may be cooking higher than it should be. Having said that seems to need more egg or larger than I used. Still enjoying them though and will try again in a different oven.

Amazingly yummy!  I took advice of fellow reviewers and cut white sugar to 1 1/2 c, and used a scanty 1 cup brown sugar.  Probably could have cut out a little more sugar, but they were decadent and delicious.   It is a bit tricky to know when to remove from oven.  Because of the chocolate chips, your toothpick may not come out dry, but it needs to be separating from sides nicely to ensure it will not remain too gooey to serve.

These have come out great every time I have made them. Forgot the chocolate chips the last time and didn't even miss them! Obviously the original recipe is best, but another time I only had 1/2 of butter and substituted oil for the other half and they still came out great!

These reviews can't be real? After 40 mins  it was completely raw with hard top Baked for an additional 15 mins to try to cook it.

After cooling for about half hour I tried a piece.  Very crunchy exterior which I liked and gooey interior - nice! But the middle needed another 5 mins.  So a total baking time of 1 hour.

3 cups sugar 4 eggs and 1cup butter - expensive brownies....

Not sure if I'll make again.

I originally made exactly as the recipe was written. I could tell by the batter that the cocoa powder flavor was going to be overpowering. I added nearly ½ cup of chocolate syrup to try & cover but to no avail. The brownies are a bit too scale-like in texture for us. The cocoa powder taste was to me over-powering. My hubby said, they weren't terrible.  When I asked if he wanted me to make them again he said no thanks. Even my 6 year old asked what the weird taste was. Sorry Brooke, but to us, these were not worth the effort.

Amazing! I made them as is, no substitutions (except sprinkling some choco chips on top instead of mixing them in). This is definitely my new go-to recipe for brownies! One word of caution: do not try to make these in a pan smaller than 13x9, the middle won't be done and the outside will be a brick!!

5 stars with tiny adjustments. I used 2 1/2 c sugar ( I used 1 c. brown and 1 1/2c white sugar. Since I got rid of a half a cup sugar they needed some more wet. I added a CAP full of Kahlua (a tbsp of coffee would have been fine but my pot was empty). I used 1/4 c. special dark cocoa powder and 3/4 c. unsweetened cocoa powder. Also, the adding of each egg separately will make a thicker brownie. I only cooked mine for 32 min. They were perfect. The most delicious brownies I have ever had. I think using the full 3 c. sugar would have been way to much.

This is definitely a keeper!
Notes:
You can make it differently (not by video) by mixing dry ingredients first, and separately mixing wet ingredients then mixing it all together.

***MUST DO - substitute butter (same amount) for COCONUT OIL and the difference is amazing AND healthier!

I made these yesterday and they came out dry. I thought that maybe they would made taste better the next day and I'm so disappointed. I doubled the recipe and ONLY decreased the sugar because it seemed like way too much but everything else remained the same.

Waaaay too sweet... not enough chocolate flavor. I think the sugar overpowers the chocolate  flavor. Also, the addition of the chocolate chips kind of interferes with the texture in my opinion; they don't really soften into the batter. IF I wanted to bother making this recipe, I'd greatly reduce the sugar and eliminate the chocolate chips.

These brownies are really good, I followed the recipe exactly and did coat the chocolate chips with flower, next time I'm going to try milk chocolate chips and see how they come out, I will make these going forward, my husband and sister in law loved it, I also top the top of it with powder sugar.

These were just exceptional. I used a bar of dark chocolate. Broke them into tiny choco chip size pieces. Follow the recipe exactly and you have the best brownies. They last for weeks. SO rich and chewy just like what my family wanted.

Obviously the massive amount of positive reviews say it all, but I had to add a review for this. I don't have a sweet tooth so it takes a lot to impress me, but these brownies are to die for! I followed the recipe exactly and got nothing but rave reviews from family and friends! One friend even said it was the perfect brownie--gooey on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside! Will make these, and only these, from now on. :-)

One of the best brownie recipes I've made. I've made these twice in the last few months. I didn't alter the recipe and they were perfect. They're rich & chewy. I got a lot of compliments on the flavor & texture. This recipe may become my go-to brownie recipe from now on.

This has been my go to recipe for years!!  It is so soft and chewey (without it being too fudgey)  I follow the recipe to a T with one exception: I add dark Hershey's cocoa instead of unsweetend.  It just adds a wonderful taste over the unsweetend!

Fantastic recipe I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I did not have any chocolate morsels so just added a cup of pecans into the mix and topped with pecans as well. I only cooked for 33 minutes in a 13x9 glass dish.

These  were delicious. I put half the chocolate chips in the mix and half on top.  Next time I will put all in the mix and perhaps drizzle some melted white chocolate over the top, after they come out of the oven. Other than that the only change I made was I added 3 Tbsp. of Kahlua to the mix. This doesnt make it coffee flavored at all but just punches up the chocolate flavour. 
Oh and I greased the pan and then dusted it well with cocoa powder before hand and had no issues getting any squares out due to sunken melted chocolate chips.

These turned out super yummy. They were fudgey and chewy which is what I love in a brownie. Next time I will take them out a few minutes sooner though because my oven runs a touch hot. I didn't even have them in for 30 minutes so be careful and keep an eye on them in the oven the first time you make them so you can adjust your timing to your oven. The only thing I wish was different about these brownies is that they turned out a bit thicker but they definitely would have been way too thick in a 9 x 9. Thanks for sharing your recipe! My family really enjoyed it.

I've made it twice and only once it turned out great! Very chocolatey and gooey. Perfect. I didn't change a thing. The second time I made it.. not so much.. good but not like the first batch. I think I might have not mixed long enough or measured something incorrectly. Either way. It's good for a try and then tweak it to your liking.

It's a good recipe, but way too sweet. need to cut down on the sugar. I will reduce  1 cup  of sugar. And give a follow up review.

I was hesitant to make these after reading a few negative reviews, but I went with the majority and tried them out and I was not disappointed! The only changes I made were to use 1 cup of brown sugar and 2 cups white as a few other reviewers suggested (and because I love brown sugar), and I used half semi sweet chips and half milk chocolate chips. I also chopped the chips quite a bit before I threw them in, trying to achieve more of that melty goodness throughout, and it worked! I baked these for exactly 35 minutes, didn't check them, just pulled them out when the timer went off and they are the perfect consistency. Nice and soft, a bit chewy and not cakey at all. They are very chocolatey, but not overly sweet. My dad considers himself to be a brownie connoisseur and he said they were the best brownies he's ever had! Will absolutely make again and again!

Best brownies ever. I made these exactly according to the recipe, and they were perfect. I only made 1/2 a recipe, and it was still like an entire box size worth of batter. An entire recipe would make seriously thick brownies. How could that ever be bad?!

Hello, I made these brownies and doubled the recipe. I did however reduce the sugar because I heard they might be too sweet (if that's even possible.) So I made them and to me they looked ready 20 minutes in. Anymore and they would not be as moist as they are now. Hope this helped. Good luck.

This has been my go to brownie recipe for a few years now. They turn out perfect everytime and I always get endless compliments on them. 
 For gooey caramel ones sub milk duds for the chocolate chips.

I followed directions. Had large eggs so used 3 instead of 4. The batter tasted delish but i doubted the size of 9x13. So reread it to double check. 
I was cautious to bake only 35 min even though it said up to 40.
They came out dry. Very disappointing. Won't make again.

First, let me say that this is my first review, but I could not let this go without raving about it!!! OMG SOOOOOOO GOOD!!! I am not usually real good about following recipes exactly. I've been cooking and baking for a long time - so I have own substitutes and tweaks that I usually do right off the bat. But I have never actually made brownies from scratch before (usually just doctor up the boxed mixes). So, this one I did exactly as the recipe read and they are AMAZING!!! Chewy, gooey, chocolatey goodness!! Thanks for sharing!!

It would have been a 5 stars if not for this being too sweet for us. 3 cups of sugar is a little over too much. I will definitely make this again, only with reduced amount to mostly half of what this recipe asks for.

I have now made these a couple times, and they have come out amazing both times! The only adjustment I make is half white and half light brown sugar because I like the texture and taste of the brown sugar. The chocolate chips are great for adding an extra layer of melt in your mouth, fudgy goodness to them.

I made it as written and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I will make these again. My husband said they are the best brownies I've ever made. I may try adding 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper next time. Mine were fully cooked in 33 minutes. I used a nonstick USA 9x13 pan. I did not have to grease the pan and my chocolate chips did not sink. Everything cooks so well in these pans. Warning: they are rich!

I made these using an organic gluten free flour blend due to my family's dietary needs and they turned out fantastic. Chewy, fudgy and super easy to make! I will never buy a box mix again. Thanks Brooke!

I combine this recipe with the "Best Chocolate Chip Cookie" recipe found on AllRecipes to make tasty mini muffin-sized brownie cookies (aka brookies). I'm new to baking and this combo is pretty fool proof. I fill about 1/3 of the mini muffin tin with brownie batter and then plop a ball of cookie dough (maybe the size of those small ice cream scoopers) in the center. I bake them at 350 or 375 for about 6 minutes...and then fight the urge to gobble them all up!

I haven't made these but tried them at my sister's house and they are the best brownies I've ever had in my life.  I love a good chocolate chip cookie or a brownie for dessert...don't crave cake or ice cream, so I'm picky about my cookies and brownies.  These brownies were fudgy, thick, and had a nice density and texture.  My sister said she used two cups sugar instead of three.  They really were amazing!  I've made homemade brownies and none of the recipes I've tried came even close to this one.  Perfection!

love this recipe. I do not alter the recipe (with the exception of occasionally substituting white chocolate chip for semi-sweet).  They are easy to make and a real crowd pleaser!

Try raspberry extract instead of vanilla for a fun twist.  I have also tried this recipe with peanut butter chips instead of chocolate.  Delicious.

I followed the recipe, but omitted the chocolate chips as I didn't have any in the house and thought they didn't need more sweet. Myself, neighbor and father all approve and went back for more. I will save this recipe to make them again. These do come out a bit thinner than I'd like but tasty all the same. Thanks!

made these 3x now.  they were best with crushed  pecans. they are good but there is a crust on the top that is not in the picture.  it flakes when brownies are cut.  I like the soft texture in the middle though.  wish they had a deeper chocolate flavor.  they are very grainy , sugary and sweet.  will keep looking for a better recipe.

This recipe is amazing! I just substituted 1 cup white sugar with soft brown sugar and would probably try to make it again with less sugar next time.

I love this recipe! I always add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts  to the batter and a little under 1/4 cup of  finely chopped walnuts on top. I've tried a lot of different brownie recipes on here and this one never fails me. I'm at a lower elevation and 35 min leaves them moist but not under-cooked. They are chewy and soft even on day 2 (if they even last that long)

This recipe turns out beautifully every time! This is pretty much our family recipe now. As long as you follow the recipe exactly it will turn out scrumptious! But if you add the chocolate chips, i would say another 15 minutes, or the brownies will turn out raw.

These are the best brownies I've ever eaten, and I'm probably going to get diabetes from this lol. I didn't add chocolate chips because I usually don't enjoy chocolate chips in desserts, and I'm glad I didn't. This brownie melts in your mouth but also has some chewy-ness to it. It's so perfect! I've been looking for an amazing brownie recipe for months and finally found it!

Great recipe and very sweet which I prefer in a brownie. I added a tablespoon of espresso powder to enhance the chocolate, used baker's sugar and added 3/4 cup of walnuts in addition to the chocolate chips and they came out fantastic!

This is one of the best brownie recipes. I have also used this recipe and layered in the middle carmel, nuts, and pretzels. This is the only recipe I use.

I think this is my new "go to" brownie! I'm guess I love my brownies sweet and gooey. I didn't read some of the reviewers comments about this recipe being too sweet until they were in the oven.  I Amman have altered the recipe had I read that first, I'm so glad I made them just as written.

Sorry...I had high hopes for these after reading about them, but they turned out dry, crumbly and dense.  I followed the recipe instructions implicitly and even pulled them out of the oven 5 minutes sooner than least suggested time (30 instead of 35 mins).  I will admit that the flavor is very nice and chocolatey but for me and brownies...it's all about the texture

Loved these!!! Made as directed with the suggestions with 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup packed brown sugar. I used salted butter so I omitted the salt. They were great and fudgy and soft and wonderful but not terribly sweet. I may try 1 1/2 cups each next time, but there were great either way!!! Very rich so definitely ate them with milk and in smaller quantities. However, great to get my chocolatey fix!!!

This is a great base for gourmet brownies! I used 1 cup melted butter flavored crisco (that's 206g if you weigh ingredients) and added 2 oz (60mL) of milk, leave less than a 1/4 cup of chocolate chips for the top, and bake for 30min (we like them soft and gooey!)

I love baking new things and when this brownie recipe popped up I was ecstatic to bake it because my boyfriend is a chocolate addict.
I followed everything to a T when I made the recipe as I do every first time I try something. 
There was no moisture in these, which was sad because every comment praised how chewy they were. I, on the other hand, had gotten bricks as my end result.  And it's overwhelmingly sweet. Plus I horribly bitter aftertaste! 
I think I'll stick to my original family brownie recipe and keep tweaking it.

Loved the brownies. Moist and flavorful. Best recipe yet for brownies. Added walnuts, substituted 1/2 canola oil for 1/2 butter to keep them extra moist and changed nothing else. Made a quad batch for the office. They were gone in a flash.

I followed CookinginFL suggestions and did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, milk chocolate chips, and the suggestion to use a whisk rather than traditional sifter was soooo helpful. The brownies were amazing! They are sweet, but we love them that way in our house. :)

The brownie itself was perfect. I have no idea what people are saying by cakey... Unless it was over baked. These were rich and fudged. My only change was less icing sugar in the icing. I added 2/3 of the amount suggested. Husband loved them.

I find this to be a good recipe; fudgy inside, slightly crisp outside & on top. 

Difference I made was: 
1. Reduced sugar by 100g - all white
2. Added roasted walnuts 
3. Added like a tablespoon of condensed milk (just to experiment)

Came out perfect! And I don't think it's going to last till tomm coz everyone kept gobbling it down :)

I didn't really like it because the the texture just wasn't a very good texture. The mixing took to long, and the actual sugariness of it was overpowering.

These brownies are delicious. When I read 3 cups, I became a bit hesitant, so I only added a smidge over 2 cups. Maybe 2 & 1/8 of regular white sugar. . I also took note, these were a double batch from what I normally bake, so the 3 cups became more practical. I only had special dark cocoa and milk chocolate chips. I went with it and they are decadent, moist, chewy brownies. Perfect. I cooked in a 9x13, because again this batch is double from a standard batch (at least from what I typically make). I baked in a gas oven at 350 for 34 minutes. Perfect. Thanks for the suggestions!  Probably will be my go to brownie recipe!!!!!

In my opinion, the best brownies ever are the ones you make from the Ghirardelli box mix. Unfortunately, sometimes that box mix isn't on hand when I'm craving a brownie, so I have to try to make my own. This recipe is almost as good as the Ghirardelli ones, although I think if I used a good cocoa it would be as good. 

There's a really nice crunchy layer on top. The middle of the pan is fudgy and decadent, and the outer edges are delightfully chewy. They don't need any kind of frosting or glaze or anything, although they would be wonderful with some ice cream! 

A warning: I think the issue a lot of people were having with this recipe was simply overcooking the brownies. I only cooked them for 35 minutes and they were cooked all the way through. They're supposed to be soft, and shouldn't be rock-hard or hard to cut unless baked for too long. 

I love this recipe, and will definitely use again.

Great recipe, a pretty perfect, sweet, fudgy brownie. However, I find I get a moister brownie and better reviews from people when I replace half the total amount of butter with oil, and use a mixture of white and dark brown sugars.

I followed the directions with NO variations and it's kind of bland and seems to be missing something. With the amount of butter, sugar, and chocolate in this recipe I figured it was going to be amazing but I'm less than impressed with the results. Others had great reviews but I guess they made changes?

These are awesome-- I needed a brownie that would hold up for HOT weather (90 degrees expected.) These are wonderful-- nice mix of soft chewy and cake.  I did try the lower sugar version with 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also lined bar pan with greased parchment paper.  Used my convection oven and 30 minutes was great.  Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper!

I wanted to try this because everyone seemed to love it or hate it. I think I made the mistake of trying to make them thicker by putting them in the next size down pan I have (not the 9x13). When I took it out after the allotted time, the center was gooey. I had to keep putting the pan back in, which make it too chewy on the outside and difficult to get a single brownie out of the pan in one piece. The batter was yummy, so I think the cooking method affected the flavor too much to rate this effectively. I might try it again exactly as the directions say, but it is not as dark chocolate-y as I was looking for, definitely more like a Hershey bar than a Ghirardelli dark chocolate or the Ghirardelli brownies.

I made this recipe but used 1/2 c. Butter and 1/2 c. Oil, everything else the same.  I put a chocolate icing on the brownies with coarse chopped walnuts.  Used a larger pan than the 9x13inch pan, more like 10x20 inch.  (I like a thinner, dense Chewy & really chocolate brownie). Absolutely awesome! Best brownie I've ever made!

These brownies are amazing!  My friends request them any time we have a get together.  I live in Paris and my friends tell me that I should make these and sell them at the coffee shops because they are so good!  They are definitely a fudgy, rich brownie.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't care for this recipe.  The only thing I changed was I reduced the sugar to two cups like others suggested. They were still plenty sweet but so DRY and CAKEY, not even close to the way a brownie should be.

These did not cook evenly (edges were starting to get burned while middle was still quite runny) and were too sweet (and I didn't ever think I'd say something is too sweet!).  I will try another recipe.

This is the best brownie recipe I have ever tasted. It tastes even better with French Vanilla ice cream on top. My daughter made it first, here at home, but I will be making another batch soon.

Well, these brownies are definitely very good.  I made the recipe exactly to a "T" and didn't change anything about it.  I hesitate to give it 5 stars because I believe that the value of this recipe isn't very good.  For the cost of all the ingredients it takes, I might have been better off buying a cheap box mix like Betty Crocker and the brownies would have tasted just as good for half the price.

These brownies are delicious!  A hit with my grandchildren and my husband!

I  looked at the 3 cups of sugar and hesitated making them.  Nonetheless I made them as written and everybody loved them.

Perhaps some of the best brownies I ever made.  I substituted 3 cups of white sugar with 1 1/2 C of dark brown sugar and 1 1/2 C of white sugar.  I also added a cup of peanut butter chips. They were truly a hit!

They baked a lot longer than it said in the instructions. The top was too crispy so I cut that part off. The bottom part of the brownies was really good though!

So, I was in my kitchen tonight and wanted to to make cream cheese brownies, I used the recipe and made a cream cheese toping. I was very happy with the texture of the egg-sugar-butter mixture and could tell it was going to make this recipe SUPER RICH!  The result of my "tampering was a cheesecake like topping to the rich, moist,  fudgy brownie that this recipe already provides! Easy and delicious.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did it like it says and it came out perfect. I'd love to do it on a 8x8 and make them a little thicker. I'll try that next time.

OMG.  I've made homemade brownies before, but they were nothing like these ones.  So simple and so GOOD!  Halved the recipe & used an 8x8" pan, dark chocolate chips and walnuts.  Thick, fudgy, crunchy on top and absolutely delicious.  My new go-to brownie recipe!

Absolutely love this recipe, it's nice and gooey in the middle and the chocolate chips take it to a next level! I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, this is just a personal preference, 3 cups is perfect for all those sweet-tooth people out there. By far the best recipe I've used.

Nice texture, easy to assemble but sweeter then we care for. If I make it again will cut back on  the sugar, not sure if that will effect the texture.

Amazing brownie recipe!  Delicious with walnuts too.  If I want to tell myself they're a little 'good for you', I make them with coconut oil instead of butter.  Delicious either way, just don't over bake them!

This is a great recipe. I love that it makes a large pan instead of an 8 x 8. We found the texture and thickness to be just to our liking. This will be my go-to brownie recipe!

These were so good that I literally burned my tongue trying to eat them while they were cooling (although I am 8 months pregnant).  I made these for my daughters school party using a 9x13 pan and left out the chocolate chips and they were still very fudgey, chewy & dense with a strong chocolate flavor. Mine were finished in 28 minutes so keep an eye on them. Everyone loved them and you would not miss the chips. Next time I will add the chips because I will definitely be making these again & again!!  Very easy, quick dessert to pull together with in minutes.

This is still one of my favorite brownies from scratch recipes, and I've made them several times. My only complaint is that they always seem to take much longer to cook than the 35-40 minutes, not sure why. Still very fudgey and tasty though!

I decreased the sugar to 2 1/2 cups instead of 3 and used half brown sugar.  Other additions: I added peanut butter chips that were so good and at Christmas I’ve added mint extract to make them delicious!! I typically make them in muffin tins and cut down the baking time to 20-25 minutes.

These were awesome! Yes it's a lot of sugar but a special treat! Normally, when I make a brownie mix, I sprinkle caramel bits on top, otherwise if I mix them in they sink to the bottom of the pan, but these didn't sink and were a very special treat.

When I think of a brownie, this is exactly it...chewy, sweet, super chocolatey, with that flaky skin on top.  I did swap out 1c of white sugar for brown and 1/2c of the butter for coconut oil.  It's pretty easy to put together, makes the whole house smell amazing, and the family loved them.

An utterly delicious brownie.  For those who don't need an entire 13x9 pan lying around the house, tempting everyone who comes across it, halve the recipe and bake in an 8" square pan.  I only had Hershey's special dark cocoa powder on hand, and it made for a lovely, dark chocolately, brownie perfect for pairing with a salted caramel ice cream.  YUM.

Delicious! I like to add coffee to my brownies--I think it deepens the flavor. 3 Tsps of high quality instant coffee did the trick with this one.

Ok!! This is great recipe. Made it twice. Nieces Birthday dinner and for Easter Dinner, today. I used chocolate chips the first time, today I used Nestle Dark Chocolate chips filled with Cherry filling. Awesome! Mix it up and use any chips! Make sure and check the brownies for doneness, I did not, today, they had the pulled away sides and crusty top and I thought they were done. Only the outer edge was finished. Had to pop them in for a few after cutting, middle were too wet/fudgy, if there is a such thing!

I made these today, exactly following the recipe. I used dutch process cocoa, as I much prefer that type of cocoa powder. They are fudgy and chewy, just as I wanted. I do, however, think they need a little more flavor, so next time I make these I plan to add 1 1/2 teaspoons instant espresso powder and see if that helps. Otherwise a really good go to brownie recipe.

These were the BEST brownies ever, quote the name of it. They turned out perfectly and I've made them three times. They're very moist. I recommend not cooking it completely, so that the center is still wet. Overall, great brownies!

This was a slightly too cakey brownie for me. I used 3 eggs instead of 4 accidentally which might have contributed to it. I still enjoyed this though and the family loved it! Thanks!

They are still in the oven but after/during mixing they were sooo thick that it was literally like the densest dough ball I have never made. I'm kinda a new baker so I didn't realize till they went in the oven that I should have WEIGHED the flour. Even though I spooned the flour into the measuring cups I must have went way over in volume. (I did level off) I couldn't even scrape the spoon easily. I had to press it in place like a cookie or something.. Well, the alarm went off so I'm gonna go pull them. I'm impressed with how chocolatey they smelled even before baking and especially now! The whole house smells like a Toll House massacre!

Made as directed.  No changes, except used milk choc. chips because it's what I had on hand.  Perfect brownie for us brownie lovers.  Hubby LOVES it.  No more boxes for us.  DO NOT HALF SUGAR.THIS IS AN AWESOME RECIPE.  It's not too sweet.  Perfect.  Chewy edges. Thick batter and thick final baked product.  Filled my 13x9 dish.  Not sure why some said brownies weren'the thick.... I used my hand mixer to beat in each egg, maybe that had something to do with it.  Not sure...Baked 36 minutes.  Yummy!

Brilliant Recipe!
You'll know I am a very old baker when I say that for over fifty years my brownie recipe came from Mary Alden's Kids Cookbook published in the mid-fifties. That recipe also makes a fudge brownie - a " good one" according to my profane but appreciative father.  So that had been my sole recipe .... until today.  Seeing all the raves this  got and being in the mood for a change,  I made this recipe and I love it.  Chewy, fudge-like, and  moist. The only change to the ingredients was to cut back a wee bit on salt to 1/2 tsp and to add 1/2 tsp of baking powder....don't know why I did that - just felt like it. I topped the dough with a few walnut pieces and  I  lined the pan with foil which I sprayed so repacking the brownies would be easier. I am currently feasting on the edges which I cut away lest they prove too dry (they weren't) for my grandchildren and their parents who will enjoy them tomorrow as a base for really good chocolate ripple ice cream. Way to Go, Brooke!

Delicious! Moist and rich, absolutely amazing. My boyfriend thought they were ridiculously sweet, but what does he know? I could easily eat the whole pan.

I followed this recipe to the letter, except that I subbed 1c of walnuts for the chocolate chips and they came super dry. The reviews I read made these out to be moist and fudgy, but that's not at all how mine turned out.

I loved them!! But i think 3c of sugar was too much.. They are soft on tha inside and crunchy in the top (loved it). Fisrt i thought they were super super soft when they were just out of the oven. But then i waited untill they get a regular temperature and they were way better.. I recommend this recipie but with less sugar.

Wonderful brownie recipe! The brownies were chewy in the center and crisp on the edges. After baking and eating this version of brownies, I realized that I never had - a real brownie! Most brownies were either cake like or so hard that they could double as hockey pucks if cut correctly. 

I've heard people extol the virtues of the "chewy in the center and crisp outer edged brownie" much like Bigfoot I chalked it up  to legend. Since I have a brownie loving boyfriend I bravely followed this recipe  almost to the letter.  The only change I made was to use the Hershey milk chocolate chips instead of semi- sweet chocolate chips - I was not disappointed. 

 I made this for my boyfriend last night and he gave it the  thumbs up!  I gave him most of the tray of brownies so he could share them with his "brownie loving brothers";  yet another sign of approval.

I made it exactly as is, only made a half of the batch since I didn't know what to expect and whether the family will like it. To my surprise, everyone approved, including myself (and I am not a big brownie lover). Great recipe, will make it from now on!

Very simple to make and much cheaper than the box versions. It makes a lot and is pretty sweet although we didn't mind. Thank you for the recipe.

These were some very delicious brownies! The only things I did differently were that I coated the chocolate chips in flour, and it took about 45 minutes to bake in my oven.  Next time I think I will also add in some butterscotch chips or mint chips to give it some different flavor.

These brownies are amazing. Wonderful flavor and texture. I followed the recipe exactly and baked the brownies in a 9 x 13 pan. I think they are of perfect thickness. If you're looking for chocolate decadence, this is your recipe.

By far the best brownie recipe I have found, EVER! I usually half the white sugar and add 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar. My whole family had fallen in love with these brownies and when I make them they seem to disappear within minutes of taking them out of the oven!

Great recipe!!  Used a 9 x 9 pan and they still came out beautifully. Perfect marriage of fudgy and cakey.  Super rich.  I will definitely make these again.

I decreased the sugar by 1 cup.  Like most people I didn't do the  brown sugar,  used 2 cups of white sugar.  I liked the chocolate chips, it added a great deal to the flavor.
I baked it a bit too long by a few minutes, it was slightly dry.  However, it still was GREAT and my family still loved it!!!
I will use this as my brownie recipe in the future, it is "THE BOMB"!!!

I did the recipe exactly as listed. The only difference is that I poured the batter into cupcake tins instead of a baking pan, so I shortened the baking time just a bit.  And it was perfect. I wanted a fudgy/chewy brownie. It's a great recipe for a classic that shouldn't be messed with.

Okay, I will start off by saying that this batter was beautiful and the brownies are wonderful in taste, however I have no Idea what I did wrong to get a horrible overall product after baking. I baked my brownies in a 9x13 glass pan in a preheated 350 degree oven for 40 minutes, and the crust was very hard and ready, but the brownie was very raw from the inside and too goey. No, it isn't the chococlate chips, because those firmed up afterwards. I loved the taste but the overall brownie itself was not presentable.

I would give 10 stars for flavor. At 35 minutes, pulled out tested....no clean toothpick. At 40 minutes, pulled out, tested...no clean toothpick. At 45 minutes, pulled out, tested....no clean toothpick, etc......They look absolutely beautiful this morning but I am chiseling them out of the pan...they are hard on edges, but they are delicious! Use extent of time as directed. They will not give you a clean toothpick.  Only 40 minutes next time and will definitely use parchment paper.

I couldn't find my bag of chocolate chips so I ended up not using them and also used a 10x13 casserole dish as I don't have a 9x13 baking pan. 
These turned out so freaking amazing. Perfect amount of chewy and softness and sooooo moist. Def best brownies I've ever made and will for sure be making them again!

These brownies are DELISH! They are totes the BOMB and overall,  really good!  From the crispy outer edges to the oh so fudgey spots in the middle, I have no changes to add. These are the first brownies I have ever made, (but not the first I've tasted,) and the best ones I have ever tasted and probably now my signature brownie recipe! Thank you so much for the wonderful brownies Brooke!

These are dreamy! Made them for Valentine's Day this year. I've played with the chocolate chips and all have been winners! Try peanut butter chips or adding walnuts! I will try some suggestions on half brown sugar, but great recipe as is!

Awesome recipe! They are indeed fudgy and delicious as promised. Here are the gotchyas I found:

 * The batter is a lot thicker than brownie batter sometimes is. This is fine, but just expect it. It hangs in the bowl, and you have to scrape it out.
 * Because they've got so much sugar, if you cook them too long (or too hot), they'll turn crazy hard. Better to take them out a little early than risk a sheet of rock.
 * Along the same lines, definitely take them out of the pan before they're 100% cooled. I let mine cool completely first and had to scrape them out with a knife, even though they were perfectly cooked and not hard.

Definitely worth a try!

Satisfying for my chocolate tooth!
As one reviewer suggested, I used 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar and 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar.

these brownies are SO amazingly delicious (when you alter it a little )!!!

I used half white chocolate and half dark chocolate chunks which made it sort of richer. I creamed the butter not melted it to make it lighter and more fluffy, and I used 2 and a half cups of sugar,  don't reduce the sugar too much, I know it sounds like a lot but in the mix its not too much!!!
I love these brownies, defiantly my go to recipe from now on.

They were nice thick, tall brownies that baked evenly - no super crispy edges with goopy center, and they were pretty, but they are very super sweet, and had a floury/cocoa powder taste that I didn't like.

Wow! This was my first time making brownies and I don't even want to try another recipe. The consistency was perfect. I coated the pan and the chocolate chips in flour and also did 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of baking soda. I didn't have enough cocoa powder to fill up 1 cup, but it was still delicious so I would do 2/3 cup of cocoa powder. It is pretty sweet though, maybe I'll slow down on the sugar next time but I don't want to compromise the texture!

Fantastic brownies!  Fudgy, not cake-like, which is what we love.  I used a pan larger than called for and they were perfect.

It was really great, soft on the inside and a little harder on the outside. The only thing I suggest doing is using 1.5 cups of sugar instead- IT WAS WAY TOO SWEET!! Also, there is absolutely no need for salt.

I made this because I was out of brownie mix. I prepared as written and put into a 9 X 13 inch pan.  I had to bake them a lot longer than listed because they were not cook through. The middle was so soft it jiggled when I checked it. After baking longer until the center seemed done,  all the edges were hard.  What you could eat tasted good, I might try again and cut the recipe in half or may do several smaller pans.

Best brownies ever!  The batter comes out thicker than others so I was afraid I did something wrong. But they came out perfect! Don't use a smaller pan thinking they will come out thicker. A 13x 9" pan is perfect for a rich thick moist chocolate brownie.

These were outrageously good! I kicked it up a notch by adding 1 teaspoon of espresso powder and using dark cocoa powder. Took them to work the next day and by noon the whole pan was gone! Great recipe, Brooke!

I really liked these brownies for the fudginess (if you don't overbake - 35-37 min was perfect for me).  Granted, I did use only 2.5 cups of sugar, but I can definitely see these being viewed as too sweet by some.  I also made these with 2.25 cups

Great recipe. Best brownies I've ever had. Turned out perfectly gooey and delicious. First time I made it they had a strong Powder Coca flavor, almost like a coffee flavor. Second time not as much. Not sure what I did different. This brownie tastes exactly like the type of brownie you'd get in a  "Brownie  with Ice cream on top"  type of dessert  in a restaurant.

BEST BROWNIES EVER... I made exactly as the recipe except did use half brown sugar/half white sugar because that's what I had on hand. I did use mini chocolate chips and folded them in at the last second before baking so they didn't all fall to the bottom like a few raters said. They took 40 minutes, I looked for cracking on the top and no jiggle - toothpick does not work on these. They were fudgy and chewy and crunchy on the edges and chocolatey... I used a 9x12 pan.  Just the best brownies I have ever had. Next time I will try dark chocolate chips since I am a dark chocolate fan. OH! I almost forgot the cocoa powder I used was dark chocolate - that's all I keep around. Thank you, I will never make any other kind of brownie again. :)

Great brownies! I did half brown sugar and half regular sugar and baked in a 9x11 pan. I also did not put the chips in as I am not a fan of chips or nuts in my brownies. This is my favorite brownie recipe!

My 9 year old son and I were looking for a new brownie recipe. we prefer fudgy over cake like brownies. This is our new favorite. nice and chewy. Plenty of rich chocolate flavor without being over sweet. Quick and easy. He had no problem with the recipe or the results.

I have a super sweet tooth, and yet, even reducing the sugar to 2 cups (1 1/2 white and 1/2 brown), these were sweet enough to make your teeth hurt. They were, somehow, not really fudgey nor cake-like, and, after a scant 12 hours (of proper storage) were hard as a rock. But, to be honest, my very brownie-loving family wasn't going to eat more than the first sampling, anyway-- we made them into brownie sundaes because on their own they were reasonably unpleasant. Though the batter was very well mixed, you're hit in the face with the overpowering sweetness of (again, reduced) sugar, the bitterness of (high-quality) chocolate, and vanilla-- the flavors compete, not blend. I've never had a chocolate dessert turn out this way, and certainly will not be making again.

I don't know how anyone could give this less than 5 stars. Super dense, fudgy, and awesome. I halved the recipe, baked in an 8x8 pan, and they were done in 30 minutes.

'Authenticity' means a lot when you're making American brownies for a birthday kid and his classmates in Denmark. They were a great success - and were just exactly how I think brownies should be.

This recipe was very good. It was the perfect combination of fudgey but a hint of rise to it to give it less of a dense batter. It provides the perfect amount of thickness but nothing to cakey. I found this recipe very important to make in a 13x9 in pan it wont work in a smaller pan unless the recipe is cut in half. 

The amount of batter is perfect for a big family but more than I need for my small family of two. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe it was delicious. But for me I gave it four stars because to me a brownie isn't  brownie without those hard almost burnt edges. lol

This is now my standard brownie recipe. I was low on reg. sugar so used turbinado instead and it was still delicious. Also because we love dark chocolate-used dark cocoa powder and dark chocolate chips. They get rave reviews and they are so easy my 10yr old makes them .

Great recipe and super easy but I agree with some other reviewers: too much sugar! You can easily leave out between half a cup and a full cup of sugar.

Finally found a great brownie recipe! From now on Im never using a brownie´s mixture again! This is exactly how a brownie SHOULD be, chocolaty and fudgy in the inside :) I used as recommended 1 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 cup brown sugar. And for the people who say it is to sweet, shut up eat something else, or learn how to bake, cause this recipe is AMAZING

These did not work for me. They were very dense and were quite hard after baking. Still tasted good if you could overlook that but it was hard.

I read the other reviews and thought that it would be too sweet, so I put less sugar. The adults liked it because it was a little bittersweet. The children wanted more sugar in it, and I agree. Just follow the recipe exactly and it will turn out perfectly. Best brownie recipe yet.

The perfect texture for a brownie. I,too, used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. These are so quick and easy to make and come out dense yet chewy. Yum.

LOVE this recipe.  I have made them several times as they are a favorite at our house.  I have, when I feel like, swapped out 1/2 the butter for coconut oil.  Either way, they are awesome.

These brownies are amazing! I'll never buy brownie mix again. This was my first time making them and I actually threw it all in my Ninja blender with the dough blade and they turned out great! My husband likes brownies a little more done so I left them in for 45 minutes and he loved them!

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times. It is the only brownie recipe I use! The only change I make is using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. Sometimes I use about 1/2 cup less white sugar without much difference in taste.  Maybe makes it a little less unhealthy? Haha! Great recipe!

Delicious ! I used dark cocoa powder instead of regular. It really bumped up the chocolate flavor. They took about an hour to cook  instead of 40 minutes, that could just be my oven though. I will be making these again!

I wasn't sure about the pan size, so I used a traditional brownie pan - I also added 1 tsp of baking powder and they rose great!  Still had a fudgey center.  Baking took longer 350 for 25 minutes and then I dropped the temp to 325 for another 20 minutes.  I am sure if I had used the larger pan the time would be accurate :)

The chewy fudgy consistency is achieved!!! Loved that part, the only thing is it has a kind of chalky aftertaste, possibly from the cocoa. With some tiny tweaks this brownie can be amazing.

I love this recipe! To quote a friend of mine "They are chocolate clouds from heaven."  But to achieve that add one teaspoon of baking soda and they will be perfect.

Good consistency, very sweet. Me and my family all thought it could do with little less sugar, moro cacao and some crushed almonds. Because I didn't have  choco chips, I used cut up dark chocolate. Worked as a great substitute! My advice would be that keep a very close look on it as it burns in seconds.

My sister and I bake a lot at home, especially brownies, and she always tells me that the brownies I make are "average" or "OK".... but last night I used this recipe and she couldn't stop eating them! I definitely recommend this recipe.

Definitely the most amazing brownie recipe I've ever made! I get compliment after compliment by everyone that tries them. I've only made one small change to the recipe: I add chocolate shavings instead of chips, with a mix of milk and dark chocolate. I also sprinkle about 1/2 cup on the top for that extra bit of chocolate heaven! This recipe is extremely resilient, and allows for great experiments. I've added peanut butter, and marshmallows to change it up sometimes, and the result is always delicious!

I was bored and looking for something to bake using leftover Halloween candy. Brooke.....thank you so much for this fantastic recipe! Delicious and very fudgy...just the way my husband and I love our brownies! (We have zero tolerance for cake-like brownies).  The only thing I changed was adding chopped up Reese's Peanut Butter Cups instead of the chocolate morsels. We had a ton left over from Halloween. Thank you again, Brooke!

Update 11/25/2016 - I am amazed at the negative reviews. I can't help but notice that they cut the recipe short because they didn't have enough of one ingredient or another....and hated these brownies.....hello? Follow the dang recipe people!!!

I made this with Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa.  The top was beautiful and shiny, but I thought it was too sweet and not quite dark enough. I'm going to reduce the amount of sugar and try a different cocoa.

I followed the directions with one change ~ I only used 2 cups of sugar and they were still sweet. They smelled heavenly but was a little disappointed that they were overcooked on the edges so much. Would like to see a more chewy brownie edges and all.

I was originally looking for a healthy brownie recipe, but when I realized I didn't have any black beans, I said 'screw it';  I might as well make the best brownies out there!  This was it.  Didn't change a thing except added walnuts...to make it a bit more healthy!  Will become my new go-to brownie recipe.

Fabulous. I used semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips. I also added cinnamon for some warmth and a tube of instant coffee, it really brings out the chocolate flavor.  Thanks Brooke!

Not that this needs my reviews but here I am to give it anyway because YUM. Not much better than brownies and these are magnificent! Followed recipe perfectly except for one thing, I added walnuts. Call the brownie police if you must, but I love nuts as much as I love brownies, so the 2 together are even better! Not even sure how its possible, but it happened.

Absolutely AMAZING!!  I was fortunate enough to have some cocoa on hand from the Dominican Republic, and these turned out fantastic!  Light crispy crust with a nice chewy center!  I topped them with powdered sugar and my family said "BOOKMARK THAT RECIPE"!

so good! best brownies ever—with a few additions. 1. Half dark brown sugar. 2. add a teaspoon of baking soda for a little more loft, I think it's too fudgey without it. 3. use large chunks of dark chocolate instead of chocolate chips.

I have been using this brownie recipe for years.  They are OUTSTANDING.  The most chewy, fudgy, perfect brownies I've ever made.  Sometimes I switch up chocolate chunks instead of the chips.  Sprinkle with a little powdered sugar and use high quality unsweetened cocoa powder.  They are truly amazing.

I've never made homemade brownies and these turned out fantastic! I baked a little bit less than the time it states in the recipe and they turned out perfectly! I highly recommend these. I'm not much of a baker and the simplicity of the recipe is what attracted me. I will use this recipe always now! no need to look aby farther.

Tastes great, the biggest thing is DO NOT OVERBEAT when adding the eggs; this causes the brownie to rise far too much and then collapse, resulting in overdone edges and batter spilling over the sides of the dish.  I've made the same mistake twice and only figured it out the last time; next one I'll make using a wooden spoon instead

These are fantastic!  Really easy to make and really good and chewy the way I like them. I'm afraid I may eat the whole batch myself!  I was afraid there might be too much sugar, but it tasted great.  I may cut down a little next time, but don't know if it will change the texture.

Best brownies ever!! I made two changes.. I did 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups white sugar, and I added half a cup of captain Morgan's spiced rum and they were delicious! This is definitely my new go to brownie recipe!

I made these exactly as written.  They are so good.  I wrapped each brownie individually in Press 'N Seal and then put them in a couple of Ziploc bags. We packed them to take on our road trip to the beach in Florida. They stayed fresh all week and were a huge hit with everyone.

Found my perfect brownie recipe!
I didn't have semi-sweet chocolate chips on hand, so I used 1 cup of Hershey's chocolate syrup. And it was still amazing! Very rich. Definitely will make again....and again!

Great brownies! I followed the suggestions of some reviewers and did 1 cup white sugar 1 cup brown sugar. In my opinion they were not sweet enough. Next time I'll do the 3 cups of white to see what happens. Either way, they did not hang around on the plate. A light coating of chocolate frosting I think would do the trick as well.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it had an ok flavor but I felt like I was chewing on spoonfuls of sugar.  I really like rich, dark chocolate and I'm usually the last to complain about sweetness, but this was too much sugar. Not due to taste but texture, it just didn't dissolve enough to be a delightfully chewy or fudgy anything!

I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and decreased the amount of sugar to 1 cup of granulated and 1 cup of packed brown sugar.  I baked them in an 8x11 glass dish (so they'd be a little thicker) and also used Special Dark cocoa powder as that is my preference. So delicious!

2 cups sugar is enough sweet. Made with WW pastry flour and my own homemade vanilla extract.  Didn't have chips, so I hand chopped bars of 72% & 33% organic chocolate.  
Baked in my trusty W&S 9x9 metal pan...THEN I READ Gina and the Kidz' review and panicked.  Well...my brownies were done in 35 minutes and they came out beautifully.  Only my husband says not chewy enough!!! And yes, they are dense, but more on the cakey side and not chewy enough. Maybe because I used pastry flour?  I plan to try this recipe again.

These are the best brownies I have ever eaten. Don't scrimp on the sugar. I did that the first time and they came out dry and tasteless. I also did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. These are the best. Absolutely a keeper!

I made these yesterday but wanted a richer chocolate flavor brownie that my chocolate holic hubby would love, and I wanted a thicker brownie that would be soft and chew.  I used 2 cups of flour, and 2 cups of dark chocolate cocoa powder along with 1.5 cups of white sugar, and 1.5 cups of brown sugar as suggested. I used five eggs, and 3 teaspoon of vanilla.  It filled my 9x13 pan nicely. The trick is don't over bake. I left them in the oven for 25 minutes.  They are the best chewy chocolatey brownies we ever had. Very rich, and I also added a cup of chopped nuts along with the one cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.  The batter is thick so I used my electric mixer. Delicious!

I made a few tweaks here and there but oh my god...these were awesome. I halfed the recipe to bake it in a round 8x8 pan and it worked perfectly. I've been searching for "the one" in my brownie recipe collection and this is it. So. Good.

I made this for tonight. It was not to sweet, however; it was not as moist as I would have liked. Simplicity was definitely a positive. This is probably not something I would make again or recommend.

needs less sugar; next time will add milk and baking powder for more cakey texture.

I made these exactly as the recipe directs.  I took these brownies to a bbq on the weekend and they instantly became legendary.  They need no frosting whatsoever and are rich, goey and delicious.  Glass of milk optional!

Amazing brownies... I made them as directed, all white sugar and I used margarine and special dark cocoa. The whole family enjoyed them! One reviewer stated that they could have been thicker, mine came out thick, chocolatey and very moist... I usually use my mixer for everything but I mixed these with a wooden spoon, maybe that's the difference?  Thanks Brooke, they truly are the "bomb"shell.

I was desperately looking for an awesome brownie and I was disappointed I didn't have chocolate chips but decided to make these anyway. SUPER awesome, very rich. Everyone is begging for me to make them again. I can not imagine the sweetness level they would be if I had put the chocolate chips in. Next time...I'm use dark cocoa powder! :D The possibilities with this recipe are endless.

I just made these, and while the texture is very nice, the brownies themselves are painfully, painfully sweet. I love baked goods and sweets, but even I couldn't eat more than one. My husband isn't crazy about sweets, but I had just planned to keep these around and have a few nibbles here and there myself. Unfortunately, I had to chuck the rest of the pan out. The sugar just about knocked me off my feet. Phew.

I have never reviewed anything let alone a recipe but wow!!! I am a father of three and decided to make something special for my family and couldn't have asked for anything better. I didn't have ( or couldn't find) the salt so that was left out but other than that it was exactly as written and WOW! Thank you

These are sooooo good! They are very rich but so chocolatey. My husband is kind of particular about brownies. He only likes the box kind because he says homemade are never a fudge consistency. This recipe changed his opinion. It is very easy to follow too.

Followed the recipe exactly as is, and came out with a delectable brownie! It is definitely a more "fudgy" brownie, so if you enjoy more of a "cake" brownie, I wouldn't recommend.

Really really really good brownies!!! I do not need to look anywhere else for a brownie recipe.  I read a few reviews and didn't beat the eggs alot. I beat the slightly to break the yolk and mix them with the whites. I folded in each egg and folded in the flour and cocoa. Instead of chocolate chips,  I grated 2oz. Of semi-sweet baking chocolate. It was rich and super delicious... gourmet quality!!!

I have made this recipe many times.  First time just to try a different brownie recipe.  I quickly realized this is something to bring a party kind of recipe.  Very dangerous recipe so delicious but not keep around the  house kind of food too many calories.  Great recipe I have received many requests for this recipe.  Sometimes I substitute canola oil instead of butter to keep the recipe not quite as unhealthy.  It doesn't seem to make too much difference in texture or yumminess.

So amazing!
Here's a tip: 
You can use this recipe to make yummy cookie dough! 
Finish the first half of step 2 (do not add eggs) and mix in flour. 
Add chocolate chips, and enjoy! It tastes like real yummy cookie dough!!
About the brownies---so irresistible + delicious!!! Wow!

Made these tonight with the following alterations: used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 (and used half white/half brown sugar) and added 1 1/2 tsps of baking powder : and they came out great! My timer went off halfway through for some reason, and as a result, the center portion came out very soft (hopefully sitting overnight it'll "harden" up a bit more), but it still tasted awesome. This will be my go-to brownie recipe :)

Good texture and easy to cook, but wow these are sweet. Over-sweet to my tastes. Sure, brownies are supposed to be sweet, but these mostly just taste like white sugar.

Amazingly delicious and easy basic brownie recipe! Super fudgy and moist!! I did cut down the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  I added 4 tablespoons of expresso powder and a cup of hazelnuts to mine and they were a major hit!

These brownies are amazing!! Chewy and rich! The only down side is the amount of sugar.. But I guess that's a huge reason these things are THIS good!! I made a second batch and subbed chocolate protein powder instead of cocoa powder for a nice protein snack. HEAVENLY!

I have never had such a problem cooking brownies before. I made these for a party being held at my apartment and the recipe did not work for me at all. Sure the taste was good, but the insides NEVER cooked. I cooked them for a total of 60 minutes overall. I initially cooked them for the 40 minutes stated, took them out, let them cool, then had to keep putting it back in the oven because they weren't done. They are runny and gooey on the inside. Nothing like brownies are supposed to be.

These are seriously the best brownies ever! I made the other top brownie on this site posted "Best Brownies" by Angie and while it was really good, this recipe tops it by a long shot. I didn't change a thing. Wonderful. Will never buy boxed again.

This is, as promised, a gooey brownie recipe. I halved the ingredients listed here, added the 1/2 tsp baking soda mentioned by others to the dry ingredients, and baked the brownies in my favorite 8x8 inch oiled aluminum pan. I used 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips tossed in the dry ingredients before mixing in the wet ingredients in order to keep them from sinking. I also added 1/4 cup small diced walnuts, and topped the brownie batter with a handful of scattered caramel bits before baking. The recipe, once halved, only needs to be baked for 35 mins at 350 degrees. The toothpick was not completely clean, of course, because of the chocolate chips, but it was not obviously covered in raw batter. The brownies firmed up as they cooled, and were easy to remove from the pan about 25 mins after baking. My kids are thrilled and I am thrilled because now I can make the brownies they like without a trip to the store.

I love the flavor of these brownies but can't for the life of me get them to bake through.  I have baked them for the recommended time but they are raw in the middle.  I let them sit overnight and they are better but still doughy.  I really want these to work.  Any suggestions???  Convection versus regular oven?  Help!

These were very gooey (which I love) but WAAAAAY too sweet if you go by the recipe. If I make them again, I will definitely cut back the sugar. I never have tooth pain and these were so sweet they made my teeth hurt.

These are amazing! It's a toss up on which is better, these or "Best Brownies" from this site. This is a keeper! I did as another review suggested, use 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar! Will be sharing these so I'm not tempted to eat them all!

These were probably the best brownies I've ever had. They were fudgy and soft with a strong but not overpowering cocoa flavor. Definitely should be enjoyed with some milk.

I substituted the vanilla extract for half as much almond extract, just my personal preference though. I was also out of chocolate chips so I chopped up some Hershey's kisses and threw those in. Oh! And I think I used a square 9x9 pan rather than the 9x13.

If you're feeling experimental, throw some mini marshmallows on top after baking and put it under the broiler to brown them. Super yummy!

I have been making this for years with always excellent results. Always a hit at my girls' school snack sales table. Sometimes I forget to add the chocolate chips (I always use the full bag), so I just pressed them on top before baking. I've also used the (real) chocolate melting wafers, Yum! Actually any chips are great. I've made the brownies with Hershey's extra dark cocoa, they come out very black, but tasty, if you like dark chocolate-try that with white chips and almond extract for a "tuxedo" effect. Homemade brownies are about 90% as easy as a mix and so much tastier and usually less expensive. Adding a tablespoon of instant espresso powder helps, too, if your family likes that sort of thing.

A little too rich for me and too much salt. It's really good, just not the best tasting I've had. Definately the fudgiest! I will make it again but I will make changes!

While I'm not too much of a brownie person, everyone who I've served these to (and I've made them probably over a dozen times already) raves about them! The pan is always polished off in no time! And I even switch the butter for about 7 oz canola oil. They also freeze beautifully. I also usually skip the chocolate chips altogether, since they are already so rich and chocolatey.

Made the recipe as is. My family and friends loved these brownies. I did cook them on a 15 by 10 inch cookie sheet, so that I could make them go a little further. Not sure that works because everybody gobbled them up.

Awesome awesome brownies. The taste is great and I must say it was even better after refrigerated overnight. But there was only one problem that led it to be a 4 star... The top was a bit flakey and made the brownie a bit dry (I followed the recipe exactly) but other than that I loved this.

So much butter! So much sugar. And it's worth it. These are definitely a huge treat. And they're so good. I ended up using mini semi sweet chocolate chips, and threw in a few handfuls of mini m&m's .. def my staple brownie recipe now for when i'm craving something super sweet and chocolatey.

I  didn't have any chocolate chips so I used one cup of homemade caramel spread over the top. The brownies came out fudgy in the middle and crispy on the sides and bottom. Delicious!

For anyone who doesn't bake much, the brownies will come out slight mushy. Don't bake longer than 40 minutes despite the toothpick not being clean. They'll set once they've cooled.

As someone advised, add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to give it that thin brownie shell on top. I used oil instead of butter because I was short and didn't have chocolate chips. It was amazing, didn't need them. I will only ever use this recipe! ! Thanks so much!

Our favourite brownie recipe and the perfect chocolate fix. Don't look for the baking powder, you don't need it! If ypu double the recipe and use a 9 x 13" pan cook them a little longer as they will be thicker. We add chopped nuts to ours. Adiet killer for sure!

This is a great recipe for brownies. I followed other reviews and added half white and half brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp of instant  espresso powder, which enhanced the chocolate flavour; along with some walnuts. It is fantastic.

These were the best brownies ever. I added cinnamon and used special dark cocoa powder, because it was what I had. My neighbors loved these brownies.

Every brownie recipe I ever tried flopped so I always went back to good old duncan hines. This is HANDS DOWN the best brownie recipe I have ever tried so far! So perfectly chewy.

They are easy to make and taste amazing. My daughter started making these when she was 15 and when I have a food day at work I take them, everyone insists!  Everyone at work thinks it is an old family recipe that we won't share. Ha! To make them even better, I like to use the Hershey's dark cocoa.  Yum, yum!

If you are trying to decide between this recipe and "Best Brownies from this site," go with the latter. I normally make those and add chocolate chips. They are FANTASTIC, while these are just okay. I wanted to try something different, but I won't make these again.

My boyfriend loved these brownies! I make them for him so I let him rate them :)  What I've changed:  I put 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 1/2 cup of white sugar.  I did not melt the butter, I left it at room temperature and creamed the butter and sugar together with the vanilla.  I used a whole package of semi sweet chocolate chip 11.5oz and dark cocoa powder.  I baked them in the convection oven and it took 28 mins to bake at 350.  For those comments about brownies being too sweet...they are brownies, that's the whole idea!

Made these brownies today and they are absolutely delicious! Preparation is quick and easy. I especially liked the
amount of brownies you get using the
9x13 pan. I made the recipe exactly as written and I personally won't change anything. Will definitely be making these again and again!

I followed the recipe besides using melted butter... I used partially thawed butter which made the batter very thick. These brownies turned out PERFECT! They cooked for 35 minutes and they turned out to be thick moist hearty brownies. Favorite brownie recipe hands down.

I've made quite a few brownies and thus really is the best! I even cut out a 1/4 c of the butter and substituted applesauce and they rocked! I topped with mini m&ms and put some milk choc chips in the middle. This is my new go to! Thanks!

In my humble opinion, this is the best brownie recipe I have found. The reason that I tried this recipe is because I noticed that it doesn't follow the standard 1 cup of sugar to one stick of butter ratio that you find in most brownie recipes. Also, it doesn't call for any baking powder. Note that with 4 eggs in the recipe, it is important to beat by hand. Otherwise you are more likely to get cake brownies. Also, I omitted the chocolate chips. Too rich for me. This is my new " go to" brownie recipe. Enjoy!

Although the flavor of these brownies was good, my batter was too thick and came out dry and hard. I used a combination of brown and white sugar and also doves dark chocolate caramel candies in replacement of chocolate chips.The flavor was there, but the texture was completely disappointing.

Pretty tasty! These are the first brownies I've ever made with butter. I didn't have any chocolate chips, but I followed the rest of the recipe word for word. I baked for 35 minutes and then turned off my oven and left the brownie pan in the oven for another 5 minutes. I halved the recipe and used a 9x9 pan, and the thickness/consistency turned out well. 

If you like chewy (not cakey!) brownies, these taste much chewier the next day! Let them rest for 12-24 hours and you will have deliciously chewy brownie. 

Next time I will add a couple TBSP of instant coffee to the batter to intensify the chocolate flavor.

I first gave this recipe 4 stars... but after eating some the next day, I have to say that the brownies should only be eaten after they've been sitting at room temperature for 12+ hours. They were super chewy and delicious. Chocolate chips or coffee powder would deepen the chocolate flavor. Will definitely be trying this recipe again with some adjustments!

I made these brownies for a Halloween party last weekend. I like that there's no oil or baking soda/powder--it makes the brownie so much more fudgy and dreamy. Three cups of sugar seemed like a lot, so I halved it. My brownies ended up extra dark chocolatey and rich, which is what my friends and I love. Next time, I'll try baking them in a 9x9. I'd love to make these bad boys even thicker and chewier.

The overall flavor of the brownie was good and I did not think it was too sweet.  The problem was the consistency - it was way too cakey and crumbly, and it was a bit dry.

Good brownie recipe. Could be a bit richer. I cut about half the sugar and used half butter half oil.

I asked my husband how many stars I should give this recipe and he said "A Million and seven!" The brownies came out rich and moist. I want to try pouring hot fudge over these brownies with vanilla ice cream...

Wow...they came out great! I made a couple adjustments: 1 c white sugar, 1 c light brown sugar, dark chocolate cocoa powder, and extra chocolate chips sprinkled on top. I used a glass pan so I reduced the heat to 325 and baked for 30 min. Just the right amount of sugar and the bitterness of the dark chocolate still comes through.  Thank you!

I was looking for a brownie recipe that wasn't the normal brownie, for a bunch of friends coming over.  This recipe was an absolute hit.  One other review suggested putting a German Chocolate Frosting on top.  Oh my gosh, so delicious and moist.  Not too thick but not thin.  I used a glass baking dish and had to bake for the full 40 minutes.  I'm saving both recipes for many future uses. The frosting I used was Allrecipes' German Chocolate Cake Frosting. I made the frosting on medium high, stirring constantly for about 15 minutes.  After adding the nuts & coconut, it thickens to a perfect spreading consistency when cooled.  Enjoy!

Made these for my boyfriend awhile ago and he loved them! Nice and dense brownie that is not sickly sweet. I added mini m&m's on the top just to add my own little touch. Awesome brownies and it makes a lot.

Delicious! This is the recipe I've been looking for! My only complaint is the time. My oven must be different because after 35-40 mins the brownies were still liquidy batter inside. I needed to bake it another 10-15 mins, and it's still a little underdone. Next time I will bake it longer, perhaps about 55 mins. I'd like to try making it with walnuts and leaving out the chocolate chips (Which I feel are a bit of an overkill. The recipe will be perfectly fine for me without them).

I am going to baking school and we make a cake brownie and that is not what I like. (good taste but not gooey) So I looked up this recipe and tried it and WOW. I did half brown sugar and have sugar I also added in some cherries (cherry pie filling) and nuts in some. (I made them in a cup cake pan) They were the best brownies I ever had. Everyone in class said so too:) Thanks for the recipe:)

The Best brownies I've ever made. I typically try to cut out some of the butter and sugar to make it less fattening, and it gives it a darker chocolate taste. So tasty!

These turned out  FABULOUS- used 1 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 1/2 cup brown sugar and it was AMAZING- soo gooey and delicious. Piece of advice: let it bake for only  25 minutes- then its perfectly moist and yummy.

Genuinely the best brownie ever....I added pecan nuts on the top of the brownie and was delicious. Might try mixing in some cranberries next time. These are slightly chewy but melt in your mouth at the same time kind of brownies - yum.

I finally did a side by side taste test of these brownies and the recipe on the Ghirardelli ground chocolate can.  I still can't tell which is better but what I don't understand is how these don't rate as the best brownies on Allrecipes!  I halved this recipe and baked it in a 9x9 pan for 20 minutes.  The outsides were perfect but the middle was a little undercooked.  If I halve the recipe again, I will make it in an 8x8 pan for the same time.  Enjoy!

Tried this recipe this week. OUTSTANDING!! I have been looking for a brownie recipe that was made from scratch with that chewy box brownie consistency.  This is a winner here! I've probably tried a dozen recipes over the years, and these were my best homemade brownies yet--thick, fudgy, flavorful--yum! My family adored them. No more box mix for me. I melted about a quarter cup of peanut butter with my butter before mixing in the sugar. So good! Can't wait to try some other variations--marshmallows for rocky road, some caramel and pecans for turtle brownies, maybe even snicker or cheesecake! Thank you!

Best Chocolaty, chewy, fudgy Brownie recipe by far!  Going by the suggestions, I used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar and the 9 x 13 pan.  I did not have any chocolate chips on hand, so I did without, these brownies still turned out wonderful! Love them !!  They deserve 10 stars :D

Absolutely delicious!!! Very simple!!! I read the reviews before making these and was afraid about the sweetness so I did as a few others and used 2 C of white sugar and 1 C of brown sugar. Very rich and fudge-y! I had to cook mine for almost 45 minutes. I don't think I will ever buy boxed again as these were just as easy to make but a thousand times more delicious.

These were awesome! I did use mini candy coated pieces instead of chocolate chips just because thats what I had on hand. These are very sweet, rich, and gooey! Perfect for our hot fudge sundaes. We will be making these again.

I've been using allrecipes for years, but this is my first review. In short, these brownies are amazing!! I modified them to be gluten free, served them to my guest and after they had cleaned their plates, they were shocked to discover these fudgy, moist brownies were gf. The only downside, a tad too sweet, I'll cut back to 21/2 c sugar next time. These are my new go to brownies!!

I love this recipe!!  It's easy and it's good !!  
However I prefers it to be moist.  So I have changed the 3 cups white sugar to 1 1/2 cup white and 1 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Top with m&m to decor. 
My friends loved it and they are ordering it from me. 
Thank you so much Brooke!!

Just some advice: when baking it in a square pan, leave it to cool for a long time. Then you wont be disappointed with how they turn out. This was my first time baking brownies and lets just say that im never using a different recipe because these ones will taste better.

Amazing brownines! I made these for a Fourth of July BBQ, and everyone loved them, including myself! Easy to make, they smell and taste incredible. Very rich, chewy, chocolatey! Topped them off with some powdered sugar after I cut them into squares! Enjoy.

I ran out of white sugar, so I used brown for the last quarter cup. I also used mint chips instead of chocolate ones. The mint cut the sweetness nicely.

This recipe made the stickiest sugary brownies. These brownies have no cake like texture at all. The amount of sugar and the lack of chocolate flavor is truly sickening. I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone.

Absolutely the best brownies I have every made.  you definitely want to watch that they do not over-bake.  I take mine from the oven after 25 minutes.

Let me just say wow! I made these last night and they would wonderful. I came across this recipe while searching for another fudgy brownie recipe I made last year for Christmas (which is no longer posted). I am really picky when it comes to brownies so take my word for it when I say these are my new go to recipe! I used to buy the Giardelle brownie mix from Costco for years....and let me tell you... this recipe comes very close to the same consistency! It is sweet....chewy....fudgy....chocolatey GOODNESS! I made it with only 3 eggs but had to cook it for an hour because I put it in a 9x9 pan (I like them thick) so that's why it took so long. After trying it...I think 4 eggs would have been fine though. Will try it that way next time. All in all - 5 stars all the way!

These brownies were beyond delicious!! I appreciate the reviews and read them before making any recipe on this site. Often, there is valuable experience and tricks that other people have discovered. I will usually take suggestions or substitute ingredients if I believe it will make the recipe better... This recipe is PERFECT exactly how it is! Well, I guess I can't say that definitively because I used two smaller size pans (8x8) instead of the larger 9x13, but that was the only thing I changed. A few of the reviews mentioned the brownies were too thin. Using two smaller pans solved that problem.

I baked these as written and they didn't turn out like the brownie I expected. They were dry and cake-like, NOT chewy, fudgy and moist the way I think a brownie should be. I will not try again and look for a different recipe.

I have tried MANY brownie recipes and Brooke's are among my favorite! Delicious, sweet, fudgy, moist and perfect with a glass of cold milk. I followed the recipe as is and I am glad I did. I have made it several times already and have tried some alternatives - 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar, using truvia in place of white sugar, using wheat flour, but I think it is great as written. Thanks for sharing!

These Brownies made me a nervous wreck! I am poor at the moment because I recently relocated to Denver CO from Chattanooga TN, but I really wanted CHOCOLATE!!! I absolutely love Denver by the way! I was just nervous about possibly wasting ingredients! Yes, I added the 3 cups of sugar! I did add extra flour, I used a 1/2 cup measuring cup and added 3 but they were all heaping. I was a little nervous about the high altitude of Denver, the amount of sugar and the 9 by 13in pan. I did add a couple of extra tablespoons worth of cocoa powder, just for that extra kick! I did not add the chocolate chips, but I did add walnuts to half. For the butter, I added about 1 1/4 cup of butter, half was real, half was margarine. I baked them for 35 minutes flat and took them out even though my toothpick was coming out with wet batter on the bottom. I let them continue baking on the stove after I turned the oven off. About 5 minutes later, the toothpick came out a lot clean"er". I let them sit for 30 minutes before I ate any. Last night they were ooey and gooey and delicious! Today.... some of the best brownies I have ever made! They set up just fine over night! (not in the fridge.... not sure if that's safe! lol) I think you just have to be really careful not to over cook these at all! Just let them set up for an hour or two if serving the same day. My boyfriend of 3 years said they were some of the best brownies he has ever had and he is not even big on fully chocolate things!

Amazing and I mean amazing! Followed recipe as written, I cringed at 3 cups of sugar but I didn't hold back. I was also a little skeptical at a 9x13 pan baking moist, dense and delicious. These did not disappoint at all. No need to buy a box brand these were awesome. I added pecans as well!

I made these and failed to bookmark the page.  I spent over half an hour Googling brownie recipes searching for it again! So good. I took someone else's tip and used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white.  I used a stoneware pan. The funny thing with these is: they're delicious right out of the oven BUT - over the next 2 days? They are BETTER. My gosh, nothing cakey about them, just chocolatey, chewy, fudgy, perfect brownie heaven. Love this recipe forever, make them!
Update - I made these a 2nd time and did everything the same. I haven't let them sit yet but I sampled one and it was cakey...the texture is very smooth and cake-like. I hope they fix themselves overnight. I will try again and this time, bake for less than 35 minutes.

These are one of the best brownies I have ever made in my life. It's very similar to the recipe I use, almost the same, but with the difference that I don't have to melt chocolate chips and make a mess!! This is definitely the recipe I will use from now on. I encourage everyone to try these. They are very delicious, fudgy, chewy and chocolatey!!  If you love a good fudgy brownie, definitely try these. What I usually do when I make something with chocolate, I put two tablespoons of coffee, or I take two tablespoons of water, and one teaspoon of instant expresso powder or any instant coffee, to the batter,and that brings out the chocolate flavor making brownies extra delicious. It also gives them just a tiny hint of coffee flavor which goes really well with chocolate. Everyone loved them here, though I only did half of the recipe because I thought it was too much, I turns out everyone,( including me), wanted more in the end. This is the first time I use this recipe and I absolutely loved them. This is no doubt five stars.

perfectly fudgy, chewy brownie.  This is my "go to" brownie from now on.  Followed the recipe exact (but left out the chips...didn't have any) and had to split into two pans (no 9x13 in).

One of the best brownies I have ever tasted, if not the best. I had one problem, I had a hard time getting the sides off the pan. I used foil on the bottom but none at the sides, instead of greasing it. I was afraid that it won't rise if I oiled the sides (happened to me before). Brooke, please, what should I do next time because this is now my brownie recipe. The best.

My go-to recipe! I usually cook for a bit longer and I substitute canola oil for butter (I don't eat dairy). They're a great comfort food!

Very delicious! My husband, daughter, and neighbors loved them. They were super gooey, we had to eat some of our brownie with a spoon. It was kind of like eating brownie batter some of the time. But REALLY good, not a bad thing.

Huge hit!! These brownies are divine! I cut the recipe in half to accommodate my small family of three but, it was all gone in one night! I followed the recipe exactly and they are so moist, fudgy and chocolaty. Just to die for!!

Omg!! I found my new brownie recipe. I made it exactly as shown, but instead of chocolate chips I put chopped pecans in the batter and drizzled carmel over the top before I baked it.

welllllll....i wouldnt exactly call them the best brownies but they are pretty good for a first time brownie making recipe. the one thing i would advise is to use a larger pan so that they dont turn out hard. otherwise, great recipe. will be making this again.

Great brownies.  Having tried many recipes, I wanted to find one that produced a dense, fudgy brownie that you would find in a bakery.  I made the following adjustments.... I only added 2 cups of sugar, I best the eggs separately then added 1/4 at a time, I also added 1/4 tsp. baking powder to the dry mix.  I didn't have any chocolate chips on hand, but wouldn't hesitate to add them next time around.  I used. 13x9 pan and baked for just about a half hour to avoid over baking.  Fantastic!  I will make again I with my revisions.

So far my favorite brownie recipe.  These are the exact texture I expect in a brownie; chewy & dense.  And the chocolate is intense.  I have been making another recipe from this site regularly but I am glad to say I am switching to this one.

I've been craving for fudgey brownies and these are the fudgiest! I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan and replaced 1/3 of the sugar with brown sugar and it came out perfect! I lightly dusted the chocolate chips with flour so they won't sink to the bottom of the pan and it worked great! This is definitely my new brownie recipe!

These brownies have ruined us!  My wife used to love brownies now she only loves these brownies.  We were at a party the other day someone had brought brownies, she took one then said nope just don't enjoy anything but the bombshell brownies!  Sometimes we melt Andies mint chips on top of them or drizzle warm peanut butter on them or serve them warm with a scoop of ice cream. From snitching the batter to plain brownie to a dressed up dessert these are all delicious.

I have searched for a brownie recipe that will say "This is it! This is the one!" I have finally found it! I made them yesterday as a Valentine's Day treat for my family and they LOVED it!!! I thought maybe they'd be too thin using the 9x13 pan but they weren't. These brownies are so delicious, chocolaty, chewy and nice and flaky on top...just as a brownie should be! This is definitely a keeper. Next time I'll add some walnuts or pecans to it. Thanks Brooke, for sharing this recipe with us!

So far this is the best brownie recipe I've found. They turned out chocolaty and chewy just like we like them. Although, they did have a slightly sugary or powdery texture right out of the oven. I'm thinking they'll be even better once they sit and cool down a bit. They are superb compared to another highly rated brownie recipe from this site, which I didn't care for at all. The only thing I had to do differently was substitute a stick of margarine for one of the sticks of butter, because I ran out of butter. I might try substituting unsweetened baker's chocolate for the cocoa powder next time. Of course, you'd have to cut back on the butter slightly to account for the fat in the baker's chocolate. I plan on experimenting with this one a bit, even though it is really good as written. Thanks for the recipe!

The texture of this brownie is amazing.  Per a suggestion from another reviewer, I added 1/2 t baking soda.  I also used 2 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar.  The taste was good, not great.  It lacked a flavor umph.  Next time, I will use dark chocolate unsweetened cocoa and more of it.  And maybe some instant coffee granules.  Will definitely make again.

Never baked brownies from scratch before... Just made these and they turned out FANTASTIC! I was debating the pan size... Ended up using a 9x9 and I regret it since these are so rich. So next time I'll use something bigger but these are so good. Added peanut butter m&m's instead of chocolate chips since thats what I had in the cupboard. Highly recommend these!

I made this recipe exactly as written and the brownies were rich and chewy but entirely too sweet. Of course brownies should be sweet, but this was just too much. With less sugar, they'd be great.

These are pretty good.  They seemed too rich the first day, but after they sat overnight the flavors seemed to mellow a bit and they taste like a great fudgy brownie.  My biggest complaint is that they kind of fall apart - very crumbly.

Tasted okay. Very fudgy. But I have to say they taste very much like cocoa and the semi sweet chips than everything else. Maybe more sugar? Maybe something to add just a little more volume? I am not sure. But I think it needs just a few tweaks.

The brownie I was looking for!  Crunchy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside.  I made a slight adjustment, instead of chocolate chips, I cut up a Snickers bar and mixed it in the batter.

It was a good brownie, not a great one. Not one that I would take to a party. It seemed a little dry to me. Not sure if I did something wrong but not what I expected. Mine didn't come out chewy and fudgy and I followed the recipe. - Like the brownies you make out of a box mix better and so did my kids.

I made these brownies gluten free by subbing in GF flour for the regular flour and adding 1/2 tsp xanthan gum. I also did 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar as suggested by others. They were fantastic! I have been cooking GF for 5 years now and this is the first brownie recipe that works really well. Definitely a keeper!!

So sweet they make your teeth hurt.  Far too much sugar and they took longer that 40 minutes to cook, closer to an hour.

We cut the recipe in half, but left the flour 1 1/2 C and added a splash of milk and the brownies turned out delicious.The whole family loved them.

Absolutely delicious. Seriously, don't change a thing. Some have said these are sweet...duh! It's a brownie and supposed to be sweet! Cutting down on the sugar takes away from the intense chocolatey-ness...trust me, I've done it and I don't recommend it. Make this recipe as is, and you will not be disappointed.

These are very good! I did add a 1/2 t. of baking powder, per the suggestion of another reviewer and floured my chocolate chips so they wouldn't sink to the bottom. These are VERY sweet, soft and fudgy in the middle and chewy on the edges...just as a perfect brownie should be! I will make these again. Thanks, Brooke!

Instead of getting a chocolatey fudgy texture, it turned out more cakelike and it was very dry. I dont think it was my oven problem because I lowered the temperature a bit and cooked it for the required time. Good thing it had many chocolate chips in it to hide the cakelike texture.  Sorry but I wont make this again.

From reading the previous reviews I only used 2 cups of sugar and I added some milk because I live at 9000 ft.  Everyone loved them.  We also warmed the brownie and put a scoop of ice cream.  YUMMY

Best brownies ever! I whisked the cocoa and flour instead which worked just fine. And it took about 50-55 minutes for them to cook. But they are thick and soft. Just perfect!

I have 2 go-to brownie recipes. My husband used to request the ones with frosting. No more. Now, these are the only ones he wants! And he's a picky brownie person! I sometimes underbake them on purpose...just to keep them a bit more fudgy!

O.M.G.!!!!
I was searching for a new, moist, gooey, oh-so-DEEElish brownie recipe so I turned to my fav recipe website and found this. 
I halved the sugars as I'm a fan of the flavor benes of brown sugar, then added chopped, dry roasted macadamias, little over 1/2c dark choc & white chic chips and and hint of mint oil and WOW!!!
I ended up making two extra batches they are soooo addictive. I passed half out to friends, of course, and they all rave about them. It's definitely a winning recipe. I like that it does not call for oil. 
My son asked for no cake for his birthday, instead he'd like brownies...lol I said I can make that happen. I'm going to see if I can shape them into a "cake with fondant" to theme it Gotham City. We shall see ;)
Thanks so much Brook! They are Bombshell Brownies.

Everyone in my family of seven said these were the BEST brownies I have ever made (and I have tried many from scratch recipes)! They have a rich chocolate flavor, a crisp thin "crust" that forms on top, and lots of fudgy, chewy goodness underneath. They are FABULOUS!

These were so GOOD!! 

I took the advice of some the reviewers and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I also threw in 1 cup of chopped walnuts. Along with the chocolate chips.

They were so moist and chewy!!!

Thanks for a great Brownie recipe Brooke  :D :D !!

I made them again today, I didn't have butter so I used oil instead and they still came out moist and fudgy and oh so chewy gooey!  This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE brownie recipe!

Love this recipe! Followed it exactly. I won't rate a recipe that I've altered. There is no need to alter this one in my opinion and I'm not a fan of chocolate but me and my family enjoyed this!  Chewy, soft and didn't break apart when I cut it and the edges didn't get hard! If I could give this 10 stars I would.

I just made these for a gal at work for a secret Santa gift along with some other goodies. I followed the recipe exactly as it states and although they did turn out chewy and soft I thought you could taste mostly the cocoa powder. It wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be because of of the sugar so it was fine there but it just tasted like I was eating a spoon full of cocoa powder instead. I will not be making these again. Thought the taste of the cocoa powder was way to overwhelming and was not a fan of that.

This is a really great brownie recipe. I replaced the 3 cups white sugar for 1 1/2 white and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. Delicious, thick brownies resulted. Definitely using this recipe from now on!

This is my first ever not made from a box brownie recipe.  It was supposed to be for tomorrow, however, half of it is already gone.  The family all loved it.  It is really chocolately though.  I might next time just cut down on the chocolate chips.  Otherwise, very easy to put together.  Definitely a keeper.

Wow, I can't believe I wasted all these ingredients on this. :( Sorry but I followed the directions exactly and these don't taste good at all. Burnt edges and uncooked in the middle. It LOOKS like a dry cake and it tastes like chocolate-flavored sugar.

Seriously the best brownies I have ever had! These are a must try.. I did not change the recipe at all but did not bake them as long as suggested. The second time I made them I did not have chocolate chips & they were still amazing.

It might just me but these are really not the best brownies that I have ever tasted. First of all I followed the recipe and they came out hard. I really that they were missing some vegetable oil. They were way toooo dry.

So delicious! I did what other reviews suggested and did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and baked in a 9x13 for exactly 35 minutes and what I got was gooey deliciousness and the perfect thickness. Because I was low on chocolate chips, and we've had a recent trip to Hershey Park, I smashed 3 packs of Reese's cups and threw them in. Great recipe!

I was very disappointed in these.  The texture was nice, but the flavor wasn't.  I thought they were rather bitter.  Won't be making them again.

It's way, way too sweet! The sugar overpowers the chocolate. My kids did not like it either. I will have modify this by putting a lot less sugar.

These brownies are to die for, I did make two changes. I didn't have the chocolate chips, so I added 3 wrapped squares of sweet bakers chocolate shaved with a knife, & I added 1/8 tsp of ground cayenne pepper for a little heat. If you like more heat I would add a little more then 1/8 tsp. A keeper. I did find it needed a little more time to cook, maybe an extra 7 min.

These were so incredibly delicious! I followed the recommendation of another reviewer to melt the chocolate chips with the butter, and I liked how it turned out.  They are rich, chocolatey, dense, moist, chewy, with a perfect crunchy brownie top! This will be my go to recipe from now on.  NO more box mix! Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Best Recipe Ever! Rich and Creamy (Even though I used 1/2 of salted butter and 3/4 teaspoons of Salt). The only down side is that the coco mix loves to shoot down your throat while mixing with egg, sugar, butter, and vanilla.

These are great, my only critique after the first try is I think 350 is a little hot. The top ended up brittle (yet still delicious). Will make again.

I have NEVER had a homemade brownie that I enjoyed until now.  This was fantastic.  It was not cake like, and did not have that bitter cocoa taste that I have had in so many other homemade brownies.  These are very chocolatey and chewy.  My family are brownie fanatics and LOVED these.  Thank you Brooke for sharing your recipe with us!

I was very excited to try make theses brownies! It was very easy to make that my nine year old daughter did most of the making. The brownies were a hit with everyone! They were too rich and "chocolatey" for me, but everyone else who ate them begged to differ.

Made this for a dinner party-huge hit! I forgot to buy vanilla extract, so scraped out a few inches of a vanilla bean. Also, I used milk chocolate. Everyone really loved them-they were extra gooey, too! Took about 45 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT as some reviewers suggested, I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I might try a mix of brown and white sugar next time.

I tossed the chocolate chips with flour before adding them but had already put in the 1 1/2 cups of flour that the recipe called for (so ended up with a tad more flour than was in the recipe). Still turned out great! Baked for 35 minutes.

I hesitated between 4 and 5 stars... it's not exactly the recipe I was looking for, but since I made a few changes, it seemed only fair to give it a 5 stars. Mine turned out a bit cakey, and since I like my brownies very chocolatey and not to sweet, I cut the sugar to two cups. But instead of using dark chocolate chips, I used white chocolate (which is sweeter). Apart from that this recipe is very easy, and I'll give it another try and I will follow it to a T next time ;)

Just made this today and they were SOOOOOO amazing and gooey!! I hate it when brownies are cake-like and spongy(why i never make scratch brownies) but these were very chocolaty, moist, gooey and everything a perfect brownie should be! WAY better then box brownies. The only thing I did differently was only added 2 1/2 cups sugar because thought 3 cups would be overly sweet. I also used half bittersweet and half semisweet chips! Came out perfect! :)

These brownies came out sooo perfect and fudgy. Thank you for the recipe. I used 1/2 semi sweet morsels and 1/2 milk chocolate. Will definitely make again.

This recipe worked out great. I didn't have a 9 x 13 pan, so instead I spread the batter out on a greased cookie sheet with a high edge. Also, I reduced the cook time to 20 minutes, and I added butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips. They turned out AMAZING. Definitely keeping this recipe.

I followed this recipe to the letter and got exactly what I was looking for... dense chocolatey Brownies.  I used a square pan so I let them bake a little longer (8 - 10 minutes). Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for that rich brownie. No frosting required! !

Perfect brownies. I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate and it tasted great. Even my husband, who doesn't have a sweet tooth, could help himself.

3 cups of sugar seemed like a lot, so I cut it back to 2 1/4 c.  They were still PLENTY sweet, so next time I make these I may cut the sugar back another 1/2 cup or so.  Other than that, these were fantastic brownies!!  Chocolatey, moist, and fudgy!

Amazing recipe! They were the perfect consistency. I made two minor changes- I added a splash of milk to the batter (because I felt it was a bit too thick), and I used milk chocolate chips. Fudgey and delicious!

Just took it out of oven, let it cool a bit and had one.  Texture is chewy and moist, they look great.  I think perhaps tomorrow when they have had a chance to mellow-I may get more of the chocolate flavor.  However, I made some changes as follows to create a gluton free, no oil or refined sugar version.
Instead of butter, I used 1 banana and about 1/4 c of organic unsweetened applesauce; I used 2 cups Xyletol instead of sugar; organic whole grain brown rice flour with some Xanthan Gum instead of flour; and added some walnuts.

Absolutely perfect.  These are the best brownies I have ever eaten.  I did use half brown sugar and half regular sugar for the recipe.  I also only used 1/2 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. This recipe is fantastic.  I can't imagine a better tasting brownie.

The first time I made these brownies, for some reason they bombed, but the second time they ROCKED! Really dense and fudgy (sorry, I said it). They have a nice crackly top as all good brownies should, and a super chewy middle. I added white chocolate chips to balance the chocolate and it worked really well. Would definitely make again.

We loved these.  Best brownies yet.  I made in a 9x9inch pan, added a dash of milk to loosen the mixture as we like them extra gooey and added half a cup of dried cranberries.  Cooked for 45 mins and they turned out perfect.  Will be trying with peanut butter next time as it seems to be a really adaptable basic brownie recipe.

Fantastic Recipe! It tastes just like the one I used to make years ago, might even be the same 'recipe' though one thing I wish was available was a high protein version of the recipe.

Love it! We were craving some brownies and didn't have our typical box of brownies around, so I searched for an easy recipe. I came across this one and couldn't pass it up with all the positive reviews. Super easy to make. Smelled amazing. Tastes even better! Very sweet, but perfect. Definitely keeping this recipe for future brownie making and out with the boxed brownies from now on!

We loved these brownies.  I made two small changes, first I used Hershey's dark chocolate cocoa powder instead of the regular cocoa powder because that's what I had at home and then I reduced the sugar to 2 cups instead of 3.  We don't like our deserts too sweet and we are dark chocolate lovers, these brownies turned out to be everyone's favorite.  Thank you for sharing!

The only modification I did was that I did the 1.5c of brown sugar, and 1.5c of white sugar. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. (as soon as I took them out, I slathered them with Andes chips)

1. Taste is fine, its chocolate, but it ISNT a fudge-y tasting brownie.
2. I did use a 9x13 pan @ 35 minutes and the edges ARE overdone, but past the edges, nice and soft. 
3. They are NOT a break apart, fudge-y, chewy brownie. 

These were very much like a cakier brownie to me. Which isn't what I was looking for. I wanted a flatter, thinner, stickier brownie.  For what I'M looking for, I wouldn't make these again.

I tried several recipes on this site. Once I found these....no more looking. These come out perfect every time. I have swirled peanut butter in them before baking; caramel and sea salt; cream cheese; anything you do they come out perfect. I will never use any other recipe for brownies. Thanks Brooke. I owe you

Very good... yet very sweet. I suggest to use 1 1/4 cup white and 1 1/4 cup brown sugar. Otherwise, I LOVED them! Still is my favorite brownie recipe.

A new family favorite. I have made it several times and the only thing I've done differently is used mini chips because that was all I had on hand.  Hubby and sons love a dense, rich, fudgy brownie and are hooked on these.  Actually I would call them a staple in our house.  :)

This is definitely a keeper!! I'm not sure what size pan it was but it was probably larger than a 13x9 as the brownies were only an inch thick or so. They have a very sweet chocolate flavor which is great because I can just eat one and not want to keep eating the whole batch. Absolutely will make these again!

So great going to keep it. I made these on a whim and they turned out great. Chewy gooey chocolaty. I didnt change anything. They are rich and sweet and you can eat only a small bar. I did put a bit of flour in a bowl and tossed the chips in it before adding to the batter last. They stayed off the bottom and all over the brownie. Next time i may use nuts, pea nut butter chips, or somthing else. Will be making these again and again.

This was amazing! Only thing I did differently was used 2 cups regular sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I read in some of the earlier reviews that the change made them better. Not sure if this was true since I did not try the original way. I may try it as posted originally next time to compare. Thank you for posting!

I was really excited to make this recipe due to all the good reviews. I made these tonight and I really think these are just alright and not worth all the hype. I used a 9x13 pan and thought these came out a little flat and too sweet. For some reason these brownies made me really thirsty too.

This recipe was very rich and delicious... Everyone absolutely loved them.. At first when the batter was real thick and I spread it in the pan, I really thought they were gonna come out rock hard.. But instead they came out chewy and very chocolatey.. Two thumbs up....

These are very fudgy, chewy and delicious, not at all cakey. I put mine in a 9x9 pan which meant I had to up the cooking time by quite a bit.

It came out great! the texture was perfect! I couldn't help but think about the brownies weeks after i made it. The only difference i made was using half the recipe and baked it for 30-35 minutes. So for those who are baking it but have problems, try using HALF the recipe next time

Superbly popular amongst all friends and family and also delightfully simple to make! This recipe has become one of my staple desserts now, so thank you Brooke! Immensely easy and absolutely scrumptious, I'm yet to stumble across a more delicious brownie creation than this one. Highly recommend anyone for a love of über chocolatey, chewy, gooey and fudgy brownies to go for this. You won't regret it. Only tweaks I would make are with the sugar - instead of the stated 3 sugar cups I went for 2 cups; 1 consisting of brown and 1 of white sugar (so as to avoid it becoming sickly sweet). To compensate, I upped the cocoa powder ratio to about 2 cups, however reduced the chocolate chips a pinch. Also, I added walnuts which made for a yummy crunch!

This is by far our favorite brownie recipe.  I have substituted mint chips, and peanut butter chips for the chocolate.  I even put peanut butter cups in them once- best idea ever.

Delicious!  I added Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet because I thought the batter was a bit too sugary...AMAZING.

This was an amazing recipe, and I've made my share of brownie recipes (over a dozen). My husband doesn't like super sweet brownies and I love fudgey, moist brownies, and this was the ultimate for us both! It made for a huge batch that I took to a Superbowl party and they were a HUGE hit! But I made a one tweak: instead of 3 cups of sugar I added 1 tablespoon of molasses to 2 1/2 cups of sugar (I would have used 1 1/2 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar, but I was all out of brown sugar). Thanks for sharing Brooke!

I just made these brownies and had to rate them right away.  I am so disappointed.  All the reviews made these brownies sound so good.  I cooked them exactly as stated, and after 45 minutes a toothpick came out clean.  I let them cool for about 30 minutes, when I cut into them, they were like lava cake.  I put them back in the oven for another 20 minutes, and they were still mushy.  I will not be making these again.

I have made these brownies many times and in large quantities.  I made them for our elementary school kids and parents for movie night.  Everyone loved them so much.  The parents came up to me and said these brownies were like the kind they had remembered having as kids and they were so fantastic.  We even froze some of them and then had them later and they were still wonderful.  Can't go wrong with this recipe.  It's a keeper.

With only two of us here, I didn't want to make a full pan of brownies.  I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand and because it was easy to cut the recipe to one fourth.  I baked it for 35 minutes in a 7" x 7", 1-quart Corningware dish and it was perfect.  Needed a fork to eat it warm out of the pan because it was gooey and falling apart, but it was exactly what I wanted.  Even better with a bit of vanilla ice cream on top.  I will keep this recipe on hand! UPDATE: I decreased my rating to 4 stars.  After eating these, it felt like a sugar bomb in my stomach.  I will decrease the sugar next time for sure.

I thought these brownies tasted good. Although, they are so sugary and sweet, they reminded me a lot of boxed brownies. In a blind test I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I kind of thought that would be the case with the amount of sugar in the recipe. I made 1/2 recipe and baked them in a 8x8 pan for about 26-27 minutes. I am probably not the norm, but I just prefer a cakey tasting brownie over fudgey textured ones. It makes me feel like, yes, this really is a homemade brownie without a doubt.

AMAZING! So delicious. I made this in return for a favor a friend did for me, and he told me he'd pay money for these brownies.  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe!

I was fully planning on making these with the 1/2 sugar, 1/2 brown sugar as suggested by a reviewer, and sweet chips instead of semi-sweet. But I only have regular sugar and semi-sweet chips, so I made the recipe exactly according to what is listed. The brownies were quite moist, but I thought they weren't very sweet. I'm sure the semi-sweet chips are mostly to blame for that. I will definitely make it again, but I think the suggested tweaks are needed to make this a 5 star brownie.

Not the best brownies I have ever had but definitely not the worst. I made it with half brown sugar and half white sugar. Also didn't put in as much salt.....they are very rich,(need to be eaten with a glass of milk) I would probably make them again.

Wonderful brownies!!  I will NEVER buy box mixes again!  However, I baked them for 45 minutes and the middle was still very gooey.  But the outside edges were perfect.  Not sure how to get them all done the right way.

Very sweet, very good.  So chocolaty - using both chips and powder is great.  I made the batter into 48 mini muffins.  I like crust.

These were a hit with my family, especially my chocolate loving grandkids.  Did the half brown sugar thing and mixed them by hand.  If you want fudge type brownies these are for you.   I'll be making these brownies again.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!  I did as others suggested with the sugar: 1 1/2 cups white and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar.  I used a 9x13 glass casserole pan and the thickness was perfect!  This is going to be my go-to brownie recipe for sure.

I tried this recipe for the first time, and followed some of the reviewers suggestions by using part brown sugar, part white sugar.  They turned out amazing, and it was my first time making brownies from scratch!  Had them at a party and got rave reviews.

I made this recipe exactly as stated (except I used half and half brown and white sugar). 

It turned out delicious and moist...even the sides were soft.  I would definitely make these again! 

(The only change I would recommend is to decrease the sugar.  Maybe 2 cups total instead of 3).

These are wonderful! I cut back the sugar to 2.5 cups; used cake flour (needed to use it up); half butter and half canola oil; baked in an 11x7 inch pan for 28 minutes. They were very fudgey and we loved them. Do not overbake or they will be dry and hard.

Just made this recipe exactly as the original recipe instructed - incredible! I usually have no luck making brownies (even the packet mixes seem to come out dry and chewy for me). These were amazing. A huge hit with everyone! Perfect served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream :) YUM!

I changed the serving size to 30, and baked them in a 9x13. I baked them for about 32 minutes and they were perfect. Even the edges (which I cut off and save to put in pudding) were soft. I don't like things too sweet, so I did cut the sugar, but next time I'll use the full amount as it really does need it. They aren't gooey-fudgy like the box mixes, but they are dense and rich. I didn't have chocolate chips, so I upped the cocoa powder slightly. It's been a week since I've made them and I kept them in an air-tight container...today they are just as good and chewy!

I am giving this only 3 stars because the first batch (which I made with 3 cups white sugar) did not come out that great. I definitely overcooked them which probably made me like them less but when I followed the other reviewers advice and used half white sugar and half brown sugar it came out much better! And I did not over cook them this time either.

These were great. Chewy, thick and a nice crisp top. Delicious! I skipped the chocolate chips (I was out) and switched out 1/2 of the white sugar for brown. I also divided the batter between 2 8x8 pans and turned one pan into cheesecake brownies by swirling in a cheesecake topping from another recipe.

Very easy, and best brownie recipe I've tried to date.  Brought it to a dinner party and everyone loved them.  I did used half brown sugar as some other reviewers suggested, but I'm betting they'll be great with plain ol' white sugar as well.

My husband said that these were the best homemade brownies that he has ever had, and that is something coming from a "nothing beats the box when it comes to brownies" guy. I ran out of white sugar and so I used 1 c white & 2 c brown. I LOVED it with the brown, I felt like the brown complemented the cocoa better and added to the fudgy, chewiness of this recipe. These were SO good.

I made these brownies for the first time, and I have to say they are amazing!!!! I absolutely loved how they came out, and the taste is great! They are also incredibly fudgy and not cake like which I don't like in brownies.

Fantastic! The whole pan was gone in fifteen minutes. (My son and husband inhaled them :)) I left out the chocolate morsels as I didn't have any, and was glad that I had after eating a brownie. They are very sweet and would have been much too sweet with the addition of the chocolate pieces.

In my opinion, these aren't the BEST brownies ever. They are definitely good, but very sweet. Not the best option for someone who likes really dark brownies.

I have made this recipe twice now and have received rave compliments both times.  I always add some walnuts and the second time I added a dash of vanilla, why I don't know, I think I just like vanilla.  Instead of unsweetened cocoa powder I substituted hot chocolate mix which I have been trying to use up, in doing so I cut back on the sugar slightly.  These brownies taste wonderful.  One thing I did notice was the cooking time for both batches was twice as long as the recipe called for, maybe because of the Hot Chocolate Mix. I still have some hot chocolate to use up, so I will be making more of these until it is gone. Then I will try them with the unsweetened cocoa and see if there is a difference. Love them.

These brownies are AMAZING! Will never be buying them again because they were super easy to make.  I recommend as well to use half white sugar and half light brown sugar. Also, brownies are not supposed to be fat free so I went all out and after baking and cooling I made chocolate frosting and spread all over the brownies with some chopped walnuts on top.  SUPER DELICIOUS!!! Thanks for the GREAT recipe :-)

I have to say that the basic recipe is good except for the amount of sugar. Way too sweet. I did try half white and half brown as others suggested but still too sweet.

My husband said these were THE best brownies he has ever had... not just the best I've ever made. I'm a baking nut and I've tried many recipes, these are the best. They are dense and very chocolatey. I followed the ingredient list exactly (even included all 3 cups of sugar) because I wanted to try it "as is" and tweak from there, but I don't need to tweak it at all! I followed Gitana's review advice as far as the order in which I mix the ingredients together, as well as melting the chips with the butter versus adding them whole. I also greased my 9x13 pan with butter, lined with parchment, then greased the parchment to ensure the brownies wouldn't stick to the pan (my pet peeve). This always works like a charm. Baked for 35 minutes for a slightly chewy outside, but soft on the inside brownie. I'm so pleased with this recipe and have officially added it to my working household "go to" recipe book. YUM!!

The absolute best brownies. Rich, moist and fudgy, i like them better than the Betty Crocker mix! And they were easy to make. I didn't have enough white sugar so I did half white and half brown. Also I didn't have chocolate chips so I just left them out. Still delicious!!! Will be making this again, and again, and again.

This is my first time reviewing an article here,but I just had to review these brownies. I made them tonight, and they turned out great! Like, bought them in a bakery great.  I think I did slightly overcook them, because the edges were a little tougher/crispier than I would have liked. But, the rest of the brownies were super moist and fudge. These aren't cake-like at all. I'll be making these again, but taking them out of the oven a little sooner.

i was expecting an AMAZING brownie based on the rating/reviews of the recipe, but like some reviews out there, mine didn't turn out gooey like what most people described. it wasn't cakelike either, i would say it was in between. it def was chewy, but not as fudgy as most people say it is. besides cutting down the sugar to two cups (which is plenty since it was already pretty sweet), i followed the recipe to a T, so i'm not sure why mine just wasn't all that amazing. i think i'll try another brownie recipe...

These were super dry and made a revision of the sugar.  I reduced 3 cups of sugar down to 1 cup and they tasted pretty good.  Also, they held its shape...probably add like water or some milk to moistener it up.

My coworkers loved this recipe!  The pan was gone within 30 min.  The only thing i changed was using semisweet chocolate chunks instead of chips.  I also beat and stirred everything by hand to make sure I got a fudgey texture.  Thanks Brooke!

These are great! I did decide to replace 1 cup of the white sugar with brown sugar instead - although I think that the next time I make these I'll try just 1 cup of each. While they are undoubtedly delicious with the 3 cups of sugar called for, it was close to being a little too rich/dense for my personal taste. Also, I used mini chocolate chips, and I'm glad I did - it added a perfect little hint of pure chocolate in each bite. These would be great with other additions too - chopped nuts, white chocolate morsels, or soft peppermint maybe. Definitely an excellent recipe and one I'm looking forward to experimenting with more in the future. Thanks Brooke!

ALSO: Some people are complaining about the thickness of the brownies - I baked these in a 9x13 pan for 35 minutes and they came out about 3/4" thick, perfect in my opinion. :) If you want them thicker than an inch, use a smaller pan. If you want thin brownies I would suggest splitting the recipe between two 9x9 pans, although be warned that they will be very thin.

These are the best brownies if you're looking for the fudge-y kind. I didn't have any vanilla extract so I subbed some Amarula liqueur. I also chose to use the sugar as indicated, but left the chocolate chips out. It didn't turn out too sweet this way (I thought it would still be too sweet even without the chips) surprisingly. Next time I may replace some of the cocoa powder for instant espresso powder for a different flavour.

AWESOME!  Better than any box brownie mix you can buy.  A very deep, rich chocolatey taste and not oily, but certainly not dry.

I halved the recipe and added a tbsp of buttermilk, and about 2.5 tbsp sour cream. Of course used real butter, and these were awesome! A little on the thin side, but super dense and moist!

These are great, but to make them really awesome make these simple changes. Use 2 teaspoons Red Raspberry Extract & 2 teaspoons Orange Extract instead of the Vanilla Extract. Use premium white chocolate chips instead of semisweet chocolate chips and add 2 cups chopped walnuts. These brownies taste like they come from an expensive bakery.

Made this twice for my boyfriend and he loves them. Best brownies he has ever had! The first time I used the recipe I wasn't sure if I was supposed to melt the chocolate chips before mixing it into the batter, so I did just to be safe. The second time I made them I just added the chips. Not much difference, the first batch was a bit more smooth without the odd chocolate chip here and there. One question though, I am finding that by the time the middle of the brownie is done, the outsides tend to get a bit hard. Not burnt, just hard. anyone know what I can do to stop this from happening?

I make this with Special Dark cocoa and chips.  The only advice I can give is that when you take this out of the oven and let it cool, lace up your running shoes - you're going to need it because no matter how disciplined you think you are, you will not stop at one little square.  Truly the best brownies I've ever had or made.

I was very satisfied with these brownies. They were moist and delicious. I used dark chocolate cocoa powder. I also split the sugar into 1 1/2 cup white and 1 1/2 cup brown sugar. My mom (I'm 18), however, was not a fan of these (note the 3 star rating). I would make these again though.  Very Good!

I do not consider myself an experienced baker in the least, but am not THAT bad at it either (I'm somewhere in between - sometimes my baked goods turn out, sometimes they don't!). Even after 40 minutes in the oven, my brownies were underdone (which I realized AFTER the fact). Upon re-reviewing this recipe, I now see that the toothpick doneness test CAN'T be 100% accurate. Not realizing this beforehand, I instrted a toothpick into the center of my brownies, and when it came out dirty I thought it was due to the melted chocolate chips, not the acutal batter being undercooked (that's the glitch). Lesson learned, I guess. :( Had my hubs been a fan of these, I would make another attempt and hope for the best. Maybe these will float your boat, but they didn't do anything for us. Thanks anyways, Brooke! :-)

The kids were driving me nuts tonight so I made these brownies to get me through. They are amazing! Excellent! The only thing I did different is use a vegan buttery stick. I can't have dairy and they still turned out great! Thank you!!!

Wow!  These were awesome. I made them in muffin tins (just a personal preference for portion control and taking them to work with me, etc.) and they turned out great.  I used Pam but I will try papers next time, since they don't want to come out of the pan cleanly.  I also didn't even look at the oven temp - I just use 350 by default, but that is just something I've learned to do with my lame oven.  Definitely try these!

Thanks for sharing Brooke!  These are great.  Very fudge-y and perfectly sweet.  They are so rich I only can eat a mini brownie at a time but my boyfriend digs in for the long haul (and he's not a sweets kinda guy so that's saying something!).  Will definitely be making these easy brownies again!

Wonderful brownies!!! I love fudgy brownies and so many homemade brownies end up cakey. Not these!! They were super fudgy without being undercooked or runny. They even tasted better after a day or two!! Love these and will definitely be making them again!

Wonderful recipe!  My brownies usually do not turn out well, but these are great!  Definately a recipe to add to my collection.  My husband and kids loved them.  I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 3 and it turned out just fine.  Thanks so much!

I was a first time baker when I first tried making these...oh wow! They are absolutely phenomenal exactly as written. I've now made them a dozen times over 5 years, usually halving the ingredients. They are definitely fudge rather than cakey, but If that's what you like they are the best you can make!

Brooke these Brownies are AWESOME!  I did take the advise of one of the other reviews & used 1 1/2 cup of brown sugar & 1 1/2 cup of white sugar. Everyone loved these Brownies. I cant believe how easy they are to make. I will never make box brownies again. Thank you for sharing!

These brownies are excellent! I did 1 cup of white sugar and 1.5 cups of brown, and they were perfect, they do not need the extra 1/2 cup. They come out thick and fudgy and rich, and not too crispy on the edges. I will be making these from now on!

These brownies are simply the BEST. These are by far better than box brownies, which i only have ever made. I checked out this recipe and followed exactly as stated using a kitchenaid mixer, being careful not to over-mix things. I sent these to my husband for his birthday in the ND oil fields. He shared these with his buddies and now I am getting orders by the boxload! Thanks brooke!! I even swirled some peanut butter in a batch and they came out outstanding. I have never used chocolate chips because i never seem to have any leftover from cookies, so i use hersheys kisses. They work just as well. Fabulous recipe! definitely a keeper will be passing it along.

Excellent chewy brownies. I did 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also toasted some walnuts as I was preheating the oven, and sprinkled them on top of the brownies prior to baking. Will make these again!

Amazing Brownies.. I did half the recipe (i did not want a whole tray of this temptation near me for a week) and I added 1/4 cup of milk as well as 1 teaspoon of baking powder (its true, the brownies come out with a flaky top!) and the milk I added was to water down a bit the thickness of the batter. I also checked the oven multiple times and reduced the temperature twice because the edges were getting a bit dark way too early.  I only had them in there for 30 mins and fork came out with a bit of chocolate but you gotta remember that there are melted chocolate chips in there so its fine!

These really are bombshell brownies. I didn't realize how delicious they were until I took them to a party and people (mostly men) went out of their way to ask who made the brownies and "what did you put in them?! they're so good". Very straightforward recipe - and wouldn't change a thing. Thanks Brooke! This one's a keeper.

This is a great recipe!  I cut it in half and baked in a 9x9 dish and it came out great.  I did not have chocolate chips, so I cut some dove milk chocolates with caramel and put them on top before I baked them.  A few people said it was the best brownie they have ever had!

I really loved these brownies... i didn't use normal sized chocolate chips, I used mini ones. I also used an 8x8 inch square pan.... they turned out FANTASTIC!!!

Woohoo! I made these this afternoon, and yes I did change a couple of things! I used half white, half brown sugars, I used Special Dark cocoa, added Dark chocolate chips to the batter before baking, and when they were done, I put all kinds of dark chocolate M&M's on the top!! Soooo delicious! Thanks for the super brownies! :)

I only tried this recipe once but was not impressed.  They turned out gritty and not that moist.  I don't think I would try them again.  I consider myself a very good baker/cook so I know I didn't mess this recipe up.

They definitely tasted good, but that was on account of it being a butter-sugar-chocolate hybrid. Maybe a little too sweet in my opinion, but the boyfriend loved them. Addicting either way.

After trying many brownie variations, I have found these to come out with texture and flavor that I have liked best.  They have a pleasing, thick texture, and the amount of chocolate flavor is much better than some other recipes out there.

Recipe made for a great batter but I found it too sweet so I cut the sugar, used half white and half brown. Oh, and just a warning for all who attempts this recipe, please use the baking dish specified! Else you'll end up with something rather inedible... Take it from someone who found out the hard way... :D

So good! I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 x 9 pan. I used one cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. Baked it for 35 min and it was perfect. Excellent with vanilla ice cream. What a treat!

Very chocolatey, sweet, and chewy just the way I like it. I personally like this better than a box mix because I just love a lot of chocolate. I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful! I only added 100 grams of mini chocolate chips, and felt that if I had added anymore that they wouldnt have held together as they did. They were a success with my guests.

WOW, these are the best brownies ever!  I keep getting requests for more.  Adding more chocolate chips is even better, and don't overcook - these are best a bit gooey and fudgy.  Again, WOW!

This is one of the best scratch brownie recipes that I've made yet!  I followed the recommendations of others and used 2 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar.  I also needed to bake them about 45 minutes vs. the 35-40...they were still very moist & not overbaked!!!

So yummy! There was so much batter, way more than you would ever get in a bagged mix. Took as much time as a bagged mix too and yet they were way better. The best part about it is that you always have all of these items on hand.

Okay, I was hesitant because I have made home made brownies before and was never really pleased with the results.  All I can say is WOW!!!  The best ever by far!  I did reduce the white sugar as others did and replaced with light brown sugra  1/2.  You need to try these if you love brownies.

Love these brownies!  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 2 cups of white sugar, as suggested by a previous reviewer.  I now use this recipe instead of a "mix".  These are so easy to make.  Love them!!!

These are the best brownies ever!!!  After I took them out of the oven, I topped them with Andes mint chocolates and let them melt.  The mint flavor mixed with the fudgy brownies is heavenly.

Absolutely awesome brownies.  I added about 1/2 a cup chopped walnuts, but otherwise went by the recipe and they came out really nice and fudgy. I brought some to work and people haven't stopped talking about them.

The name is right...they are the bomb!  Made it just as the recipe states and have made it a number of times.  So much better than your box browies, taste like a brownie you would get out to eat.  Top with icecream and hot fudge and it is to die for!

Finally a brownie recipe that turns out for me. I omitted the chocolate chips, they are sweet! Keep in mind, I am overweight so sweets and I get along- being frank here. So, this will help everyone realize how sweet they really are..very sweet.

These are fantastic.  I find them a good middle ground brownie for those that argue between fudgelike and cakelike.   I put peanut butter chips in mine for something different.  Really tasty!  I'm trying not to eat more than one a day and that is proving difficult :)

I made these brownies for a bake sale...they were the first thing gone from the table.  I have another bake sale in January, these will definitely be one of the items that I make!   I did alter it slighty, I used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar.  I also used 1/2 c. unsweetened cocoa powder and 1/2 c. dark chocolate powder.  Simply yummy!  I don't know how they store, as I didn't have any leftovers!

Good brownies...not my favorite texture, but the flavor is spot-on. I was short one egg (because I wanted to make cheesecake brownies), so I adjusted the proportions for the remaining ingredients. I do wonder if that affected the end result. In any case, the flavor is fantastic; exactly how a brownie should taste. I would have like this to be less fudgy (like what I expected from the photo), but I also may have taken them out a little too soon. I will definitely make these again, without or without cheesecake, with the right proportions. I think these are perfect for my brother-in-law who is a die-hard chocoholic! Thanks!

This is my first attempt at brownies from scratch, and I am very pleased with the results.  The only change I made was using 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I planned on doing this with all white sugar as the recipe stated (I like to try a recipe exactly as written the first time, then make changes from there), but I was out of white sugar and had no time to go to the store.  Luckily, the other reviews that recommend this combination of sugars are absolutely right!  This is a very rich, very chocolate-y brownie, so I recommend enjoying them with a glass of milk.  Thanks for the recipe, Brooke!

I have never made a better brownie.  I love that this recipe does not use basking soda since it tends to leave a tatse, but I was worried the brownie would be "flat". Not so! Perfect fudge-cake consistency, so rinch, so sinful. I combined this recipe with "macaroon brownie" recipe with a layer of coconut in the middle and it is to DIE for. Made these to impress a guy tomorrow...and I'm betting they will.

These were a great hit. I did 2 1/4 cups instead of the three which made it a great compliment to the semi-sweet chips.

Excellent. I have tried a lot of different brownie recipes and this one wins on flavor and simpleness. They were so quick to put together and they were delicious. I made them exactly as stated in the recipe. The better quality cocoa powder you use, the better the brownies will taste.

This recipe was as yummy! Only 1 thing I needed to do was add more time, they weren't cooked at all in 35mins so i had to leave them in for about a hour.  But no problem, they were very great! Thankyou for your great brownie recipe!

This recipe is easy to make and it turns out great every time. I don't make any changes to it - works great every time. Don't change a thing. If you half the recipe it's the perfect amount for a square cake pan.

I have made a lot of brownies in my life, and this is my favorite recipe.  Rich and fudgy with a shiny top, but not so rich that you feel sick after eating one.  The only change I make is to use half brown sugar and half white.

These were the best brownies I've ever had.  I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar like another reviewer suggested.  Other than that, followed exactly.  I loved the addition of the chocolate chips.  Great texture.  Thick, chewy and everything that a good brownie should be.  Will make many, many times.  These put box mixes to shame.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these exactly as the recipe and they were wonderful.  I topped them with "Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting" by NICKIE75 and the combination was perfect.  My only complaint is that they became very hard after one day, so make sure you're feeding a crowd if you use this recipe!

There were good, I made a 1 1/2 batch since I was making them for a 9 x 13 pan.  They were definitely thick enough, but the top was pretty hard, I had a hard time cutting them and getting them out of the pan with no spatula (I took them to work).  However underneath the top layer they were very fudgy and delicious!  I subbed walnuts for the chocolate chips and they came out great.

These are the best brownies I have EVER made. I kept the recipe the exact same. Currently I am an exchange student in Chile, Latin America and the people here had never had brownies... now they ask me everyday for them. I will definitely make again!!! Thank you soooo much, I love you for giving out this recipe haha :D

These are the most amazing brownies I have EVER had! I will never go back to boxed again. I added a bit of brown sugar as others suggested and eliminated the chocolate chips and they still turned out great. Highly recommended...thanks for the recipe!

Made this for a bake sale last night.  I used 1 cup brown sugar, 2 cups white and used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of egg substitute.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to sift the flour and cocoa (used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa) so I did. Used mini chocolate chips because that was all I had. Baked in a 9 x 13 pan and it turned out quite thick (1 1/2 inches or so) and still more fudgy than cakey.  Wonderful brownies!  I will definitely make these again!

I didn't change a thing except I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  These are the best brownies I have ever had, fudgy and rich and perfect.

KILLER brownie recipe! I added 1 - 2 tbs of freshly brewed coffee to enhance the chocolatey flavor, and added a combination of semisweet and dark chocolate chips. Another fun thing to do is use chopped up snickers bars or swirl some nutella throughout for a delicious twist to this recipe.

We live in a humid climate, so while the flavor of these brownies was great, the texture was too gooey.  It was pretty easy to fix, though.  I just reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and used 3 eggs instead of 4.  They turned out great!

Okay, so I didn't quite make these according to the recipe, BUT I'm thoroughly convinced they'd be 5 stars as is. I tried to be somewhat "healthier" and substituted 1/2 C applesauce for half of the butter and only added 2 1/2 C sugar (instead of 3) and they still turned out thick, rich, and chewy with that wonderful flakey top. Everyone devoured them. This is now my official browny recipe.

As stated, the recipe makes a dark chocolate flavored brownie.  I'm a chocoholic and thought they were great, my husband the brownie afficionado thought they were a little bitter.  The kids ate them without complaint!  I used 1.5 cup white and 1.5 cup brown sugar as others have suggested, and 1 tsp of almond extract which definitely adds a little something...maybe too much.  I'll make these again but use only 1/2 tsp of the almond and will try milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet to see if the milder flavor appeases my husband.  Great recipe; I'll have to tinker with it enough to make everyone happy though.

I used 2.5 cups of sugar instead of 3 and didn't see any difference.  They have a unique taste due to the cocoa powder.

Don't overmix and you should be good to go. I like reducing the sugar a bit since 3 cups is excessive. I generally use 3/4 cup white and 3/4 cup brown sugar and still find the same results. I have also reduced the eggs from 4 to 3 (you can also use two eggs and a bit of applesauce) to yield the same end texture (will lean to the moist chewy brownie type)

Theese are really, really good. Chewy and since i cut back on the sugar, not too sweet. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups white sugar. Next time I will try only brown sugar. Didn't have any chocolate so made do without. Worked great! I like that it is made whith cocoa and not chocolate, makes them cheaper. And also, make sure that you use REAL butter and not margarine. Tastes much better and is better for you.

I baked it this morning. I did not change a single thing. The taste was just right. Fudgy and chewy. I love it. I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 deg. and turned off oven and left brownies for another 10 minutes. It sliced perfectly. The top did not crack...

first of all, i am not much of a baker. my problem with baking brownies is always the same issue: burnt edges and usually hard brownies. i wanted to try this recipe because of the high ratings and figured it would make my batch better than how they usually come out. unfortunetly i still got the hard burnt edges but after eating these the next day they taste pretty good. i added white chocolate chips and pecans. i want to continue to experiment with this recipe and work on my baking skills so i can make my brownies the way i expect them to be. thank you brooke for a great recipe :)

Made as written.....completely AWESOME!  I do not like cake-like brownies, I like fudgie brownies and these are the best!  Probably don't even need the chocolate chips if you don't have any on hand.  9 X 13 pan produced thick, chewy brownies with that shiny, flaky top.  I have made  A LOT of different brownie recipes over the last 10 years and this is a keeper.

I have tried numerous brownie recipes that I've found on this site. Most of them are either bland or cake-like, and if I wanted chocolate cake...I'd make a chocolate cake. I prefer my brownies to be dense, chewy, rich and uber chocolaty. These brownies are EXACTLY that! I used Ghirardelli 60% bittersweet chocolate chips instead of the semisweet, but other then that I followed the recipe exactly. I think I may cut back on the sugar next time, and use half white sugar, half brown. As written, this recipe is very deserving of 5 stars, and with a minor adjustment, I think it could be even better! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

Excellent recipe!! I am the type of person that can never get a boxed brownie to turn out perfectly. But this recipe has convinced me that it CAN be done from scratch! Delicious and rich. Received many compliments. Some even said it was the best brownie they have ever tasted. Followed the recipe to the T. This is our new brownie recipe for life! Thanks!

I made these for a party and they were quickly eaten up. Great moist very chocolaty brownies. I made a Kahlua frosting for these and I found it hard to eat a whole one. Will defiantly make these again.

These are good, but very sweet.  Based on other reviews, I used 1 cup light brown sugar and 2 cups fine white sugar.  I used mini chocolate chips, not quite 1 cup, and threw in about 1/2 cup of walnuts.  I have a pan that makes 12 square cupcakes so I used that and they baked up perfectly.  I forgot to set the timer so I don't know exactly how long they cooked for...my guess is about 30 minutes.  I think next time I will cut down on the sugar overall and see how they come out.

Wonderful!  I used a tad less sugar (2ish cups) and dark chocolate cocoa powder and a copious amount of chopped pecans.  Baked them in a greased mini cupcake pan and it made approximately 34 mini's.  They are PERFECT.  This will definitely be a feature on my Christmas goodie plate.  Will try with peanut butter chips next time.

Made them for a potluck at work, everyone loved them. Followed recipe to a T, except I baked them in a large muffin tin. Thought it was less work and clean up. Baked for less then 25 mins.

Perfect and Awesome Brownies! I've noticed a lot of reviews say that they wouldn't bake through...make sure to let them sit on the rack in their pan till they're pretty cool. They'll bake during that time and turn into some awesome, fudgy, chewy brownies!! Thanks Brooke!

These brownies are so good!  They're fudgy and chewy.  I made alterations to the recipe so it wouldn't be so chunky since it gets me really thirsty.  Instead of semisweet choco chips, try 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.  The results are pretty good, it taste a lot more chocolaty without drying up your mouth.

Absolutely to die for!! I took another reviewers advice and used equal parts brown sugar and white sugar, mostly because I love the caramel-y flavor brown sugar adds. I also added a cup of chopped pecans. Then I used the coconut mixture from the Coconut Macaroon Brownie recipe from this site. It tasted like the most decadent almond joy-in-a-brownie EVER! One note, this brownie recipe uses chocolate chips, which melt when baked. So if you're doing the toothpick test for doneness, keep in mind that the chips melt when hot, but set back up when cool. So if you have a melty chocolate on your toothpick, it doesn't necessarily mean the brownie isn't done. Mine took 50-55 minutes. Chocolate heaven!!!!

These brownies were good but you can get the same result from a box mix. I was hoping for a unique, homebaked taste.

It is official! I have found the brownie recipe we'll be using from now on..I've been trying so many that were just a disappointment and if these didn't turn out, I was throwing in the towel. But they are perfect! Chewy, as advertised and sooo chocolatey..left out the chips and they were still fantastic!

These were delicious! My daughter and I only made half the batter and added a little mayo to make them real moist. We then poured the batter in a muffin pan. It made about 10 brownie bites. Turned out soo good!

These brownies are amazing. So chewy and moist. I made one and a half recipe for a 4.8 qt (15" x 11") baking dish and it came out awesome. I added chopped Brazil nuts to the ingredients. I melted the butter and mixed it with the cocoa powder, vanilla and sugar. They are super sweet! but that didn't bother me or my family. Delicious, thanks for the great recipe. First time brownie baker and a huge success.

I finished baking these about 10 minutes ago. About 5 minutes ago I threw out the recipe for Baker's one bowl brownies. This are amazing! Chewy and delicious.  I did what others recommended and did half brown and half white sugar. I also added in one less egg. THANK YOU!

I would say they are good, because they are brownies, but just your average recipe. Better w/ nuts added and/or frosting.

These brownies were delicious the day I made them. I was disappointed that they were not as moist the next day. I love baking and will give these another shot... I may have made an error that hardened them prematurely.

my coworkers absolutely loved this!!! i made 1 batch but divided the batter into 2 small rectangular pans (not sure about the size). they were perfect after 25 mins. great recipe, although i did change a few things. i used 1/2c shortening and 1/2 oil instead of 1c butter. 1 1/3c brown sugar and 1 1/3c white sugar instead of the whole 3 cups white. topped with chopped nuts. already made this twice, was finished within minutes both times! :)

The brownies are delicious. I made them exactly how it stated as well. I love them, but instead of a cup of chocolate chips next time I will only put 1/2c just because I didnt think a cup was necessary. Either way they are sweet a very good!

A very rich fudgy brownie.  I wasn't disappointed in this recipe at all.  Only changes I made were to use Dove Dark Chocolate Promises (chopped up) in place of the chocolate chips and used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Stevia (cuts down on calories and has less effect on insulin levels).  I will be making these again - that's for sure!

It is so disappointing when a popular recipe doesn't quite live up to the hype...and it's AWESOME when it does. These brownies are wooonderful. I followed the recipe precisely, baked for 36 minutes in a glass 9 X 13 baking dish. These brownies also have the best "corner pieces," which is what we fight over in my home! Can't wait to make them again!

This recipe was amazing. I made 3/4 of the batter since I only have 8" baking pan and it turn out very nice, tasty and chocolaty. The only change I made is cut the sugar to 1 1/2 c only and the sweetness is just fine. Everybody love it. This will be my brownies recipe from now on.

These brownies are absolutely delicious! They are my go to for B-B-Qs and people always go wild for them. I have made them at least a dozen times and have never changed the recipe one bit, it doesn't need it. Definitely for those with a real sweet tooth. Thanks so much for sharing.

These are good, but boy are they sweet!  I can't eat but just a tiny bite at a time and the pan is FULL of brownies.  Next time I'd cut this in half unless Iw as making for a crowd.  But I'm not sure I'd try this recipe again, it's REALLY sweet.  I like sweet, but this is too much.

These turned out amazing. Everything just works. The texture of these are really something else. It is the perfect balance of chocolate and fudge. I didn't even have a flour sifter on hand and they still tasted amazing. Everyone asks for the recipe.

These are absolutely amazing, and super easy.  I make them all the time.  It is important to know that the brand of cocoa powder you use has a big impact on the taste.  Play around until you find your favorite one.

These brownies are absolutely scrumptious! I made these for my family, following the recipe exactly, and they couldn't get enough. They came out so fudgy and moist. I used a 9 x 13 glass pan, which was perfect, not too thin, not too thick.  I was so used to making brownies out of the box and these blow them out of the water. I don't think I'll ever use a box mix again! This recipe is taking a permanent spot in my recipe box.

Hmmm, not sure if I did something wrong or if it was the recipe.  Since most reviews are good ones, Im guessing I did something wrong.  The flavor was great, but the brownie itself was dry and hard on the bottom and top. Maybe Ill try again and read some of the reviewers suggestions. I do love that this recipe is very simple with a short list of ingredients!

Just made these.  I halved the recipe, used 3 small to medium eggs, mixture of brown/white sugar, pecan pieces and dark chocolate cocoa.  So amazingly good and moist.

These brownies are perfect for when you're looking for gooey, rich chocolate brownies. They are NOT cake-like (thank GOD) so go elsewhere if you want that dry brownie . These even came out shiny on top like those boxed mixes do (ah memories from being a kid!). I'd just be sure to sift your dry stuff and not over fold in the wet stuff.  Like pancake batter, you can't be afraid of lumps or seeing a bit of flour. PERFECT!

Fabulous! A lot of sugar, but if you're going to do brownies, do it. Only change I did was to use grand marnier instead of vanilla, because I was out of vanilla. Yum!

I halved this recipe and used 1 cup of white sugar instead of 1.5 cups and baked them in an 8X8 for 20 minutes and they came our PERFECT.  These brownies were SOOOO good!!  I'm pretty sure I used more chocolate chips than the recipe called for but I am a chocolate fanatic.  I took them to work and they were gone in an hour!  I have NEVER had good luck making brownies from scratch until now!!!

I have made these brownies several times and really liked them, but the top was always too crusty. So I cut the sugar down to 2 cups--perfect. For those who find the original recipe too sweet and/or too chocolately this does the trick. Still chewy and chocolately--just right

This recipe tasted exactly like it came out of a ready-mix box! And that's a good thing! The outside of the brownies were quite dry though. The inside was moist and fudgie. But I think that might have been my oven. Will need to try it out again.  I reduced the amount of white sugar to 2 cups and the sweetness turned out to be just right. My family absolutely loved this! Will definitely make more. :)

These brownies are quite delicious!! I usually like cakier brownies, but was in the mood for fudgy. I tried this recipe and it was great. The only thing I would change is the thickness. They were a little too thin for me. Overall, great recipe, though.

These brownies are OMG good! I made them last night for my boyfriend's birthday. He couldn't get enough! They are so fudgey but moist at the same time. Wouldn't change anything about the recipe, except to add pecans.

Brooke, you're my new best friend!  i tried one other reviewers suggestion and switched 1c white sugar for 1c brown sugar, everything else the same, and they are the bomb for brownies!  thanks so much for sharing, this will be my go to recipe for brownies.

I have always bought packet mix brownies as was told that was the best way to make them.  These beat the pants off any packet mix I have ever bought.  I added about 1/4 of cup of flaxseed(ground) and some golden syrup cause we ran out of sugar. but they were fantastic, will definitely use this from now on.

Ahhhhh, these are one of the two best homemade brownies I've ever had. They're so fudgy. It's a-mah-zing. It was a tiny bit salty; that might have been my own fault, though. I'll try it again. But the fudginess compensates for it. Definitely.

Delicious and so chocolately! I halved the recipe, so used a 9 x 9 pan, it worked great! I also discovered I was short one egg while I was making the recipe...well, even without the extra egg, they turned out really good! I'll be using this recipe again and again. Thanks!

These in my opinion are not the "bomb", more likely to bomb. I reduced the amount of sugar to 2 1/2 cups and they are still too sweet.  I like a brownie I can sink my teeth into but in a 9 x 13 pan came out very thin. I would normally use a 9 x 9 but I read reviews were they didn't turn out well.  After 35 minutes of baking the toothpick came out clean but were still very soft to the touch.  I cooled for ten minutes and cut a very small piece of end and they were still raw inside, so back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  I always line my pan with aluminum foil with an overhang so I lift it all at once and cut into bars on a flat surface.  I still had to trim the edges because they were so dry. I am amazed these got so many great reviews but if I want a super sweet, thin, crispy edged brownie I'll stick to the box mixes.

WOW. These brownies were fantastic! My boyfriend and I gobbled up the whole batch in less than a week and my mom said they were the best brownies she'd ever tasted. I decided to to go with other recommendations substituting half of the sugar for brown sugar and I didn't add as much chocolate chips as the recipe calls for. Also I ran out of butter and had to substitute a bit of crisco and they still came out wonderfully. I would definitely recommend these brownies.

The second I tasted the batter I knew these were going to be awesome. Thank you for a fantastic, better-than-boxed brownie recipe. I made them exactly as the recipe stated and I wouldn't change it at all, no need to if you love rich chocolatey brownies.

Mmmmm... Didn't actually get to try them baked 'cause they were a gift but they smelled REALLY good and the batter tasted delicious! I used 2 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar to increase the flavor and moistness and that seemed to work out pretty well. I decorated the top with a little buttercream frosting to write a thank you note and it was very pretty, if I do say so myself! :)

I have no idea what happened, but my brownies looked like they were swimming in oil!  Literally, the oil was boiling.  They came out totally oily, hard on the edges, and utterly mush in the middle.   I followed the recipe exactly.

I used a dutch-process cocoa each time -- Wonderchocoa, and then Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa.  Dutch-processed (also called alkalized) cocoa powder is treated with an alkali to neutralize its acids so it's got a smoother, lighter finish.  But, because it's less acidic, it makes the brownies less fluffy than using regular cocoa.  It is precisely this reason that I used it -- I like brownies that are dense and decadent -- this recipe is perfect for this.  I didn't add the chocolate chips the second time (I didn't have any) but I topped with fresh pecans.  35 minutes baking time was perfect!

These are just ok. I usually make brownies out of a box but I wanted something special for hubby's birthday. Made these using 2 cups sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and they taste like they're missing something. I will try making these again with just white sugar like the recipe calls for. At first I thought 3 cups sugar would be way too sweet but they're really not. Just make sure you cover them with plastic wrap or put in an air tight container. After 2 hours sitting on the counter they were starting to get pretty hard, but wrapped the edges stay a litle crispy and the middle soft, just the way I love them.

Great recipe Brooke!! These are by far the best brownies I have ever made. They taste just like Ghardelli brownie mix you buy in the store.   I followed the recipe with the exception of half brown half white sugar and I had no problems.  They are so yummy that you don't even need frosting and this is coming from a person that canl loves frosting!  Another thing I love about this recipe is that all ingredients are always stocked in my kitchen. Also the recipe is easy to half.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Brooke!

Do NOT make these Brownies if you are on Weight Watchers... they are impossible to leave alone.  I frosted the large batch with chocolate icing, sprinkled with crushed nuts and drizzled with caramel.. a dieters nightmare, but oh soooo good!

I thought that these brownies were absolutley devine! The only thing that I did differently (that I enjoyed a little better) was use semi-sweet baking chocolate instead of chocolate chips. I just pounded them down until there were little chunks. Yummy! This recipe gets MY goldstar of approval...

We added two massive tablespoons of pure belgian chocolate (used to make hot chocolate) and studded the top with dark chocolate morsels. And of course a half ounce of buddahhhhh!!!! We also had to use margarine instead of butter, and they turned out to be AMAZING!! Super simple!

Yum, yum, YUM! These were absolutely delicious. I definitely agree with other reviewers; these are wonderful the first day, but *spectacular* the second. I also used half brown and half white sugars, and even when they were done my toothpick came back fudgy. I will certainly be making these again. UPDATE: you simply *MUST* stir these by hand. Will your arms complain? A little. Will your guests rave and make almost obscene noises of delight? Most definitely! It definitely ups the awesomeness of these winners even more!!

This is an incredible recipe. As others suggested, I used  1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1 1/2 white. These brownies cut best if you store them in the refrigerator first. They are awesome cold or room temperature. You can also eat them hot from the oven with ice cream as they are like lava cakes.  If you have a 12x17 pan, you can double the recipe and cook for 35 minutes. This is the perfect size for small parties, bake sales, classroom treats, etc.  Enjoy!

These are great. Really dense, chewy, fudgey brownies. So much better than boxed brownie mix, and it really wasn't that much harder to make. I didn't have semi-sweet chocolate chips so I used milk chocolate chips instead, and I added in a half-cup of walnuts. I halved the recipe and it fit fine in a 8x8 pan. I definitely need to grease the pan better next time though, because the edges of the brownies were really hard to get out. (my fault, not recipe's)

Wonderful!  I have made many, many brownie recipes, but this might be "the one".  No need to look further.  The better quality cocoa powder you use, the  better your brownies will be so spring for the good stuff.  Its worth it.  The only change I made was to use gf flour (I'm gluten intolerant) and I only baked for 1/2 an hour.  Thanks for recipe, Brooke!

These Brownies are amazing!  I've been following the suggestions and using 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 1/2 cups dark brown sugar.  I would also recommend using a high quality cocoa powder.  I made a batch with a store brand, and then a batch with ghirardelli cocoa.  The difference is very noticeable.  Any high quality cocoa should produce the same results though.  These are pretty fool-proof.   Try them, you won't go back to another recipe.

I've been baking these brownies for over a year now and it's the only recipe I use- it's so versatile and delicious! I always get asked for the recipe wherever I bring them! I bake them in mini muffin pans and vary the kind of chips I use... and for a more grown-up version I add chili powder and or cayenne. Perfection! Thanks so much for such a great homemade brownie recipe!!!

I've fixed a few of the brownie recipes on here and this one is the go to...I will look no further!  Occasionally mix it up with some white chocolate chips or nuts but no real changes and they come out great.  Just an fyi...I do cut the recipe in half to bake in my 9x9 pan and bake for 20min.  Perfect!

These were easy to make and very moist and chocolatey.  I'm giving 4 stars b/c they're almost too chocolatey (not something I say often).  One friend really liked them but I couldn't even really eat them b/c I felt like I do if I have caffeine - there's just that much chocolate.  But definitely recommended for those who really like dark chocolate.

Oh my! These were the chewist fudgy brownies I have ever had.   Only made a couple of changes  cut the sugar back to 2 cups and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown, also cooked in a larger pan. Oh and I melted the chocolate chips along with the butter.  These disappeared very quickly as did the second batch that I made straight after the first had gone. These are very addictive!!

Best brownies I have ever made!  I used half oil and half butter since I ran out of butter and they were still amazingly good.  I've rarely made home made brownies in the past, but will now.
Addendum:  I have now made these numerous times and find that using 1 stick butter and a half cup of applesauce still comes out great.  I also now use 2 C white sugar and 1/3 C stevia sweetener to
cut the sugar calories by a third.  No one can tell I make either substitution and they are still wonderful brownies.  I do mix both mini-chocolate chips and normal size milk chocolate chips in the batter for the cup of chips called for.

I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting dairy-free margarine for the butter to accommodate dairy allergies. These brownies are amazing. A definite keeper!

I made this pretty close to actual recipe. Just didnt have chocolate chips so I had to chop up some hersheys kisses in place of them. Turned out really good but not quite what I was looking for.

These are amazing, yet so simple I have not yet figured out what the secret is! I did use only 1 1/2- 2 cups sugar. Baked in a 9x13 pan and they got nearly cleaned out at dinner at a family gathering. I served them with blended strawberries to which I had added a bit of sugar as well. Noone could stop eating this. I will make this over and over!!

Ok.  They were dry and were less "chocolately" than my other recipe.  I will be sticking with the recipes on the Baker's chocolate boxes for now.

These brownies are WAY too good!!  My 8 year old son and I made them together to share with his basketball team.  We made them exactly as the recipe said.  If you think these turned out cakey then I think you did something wrong.  These were almost more like fudge than a brownie.  Exactly what I love in a brownie.  We used the brownie frosting recipe from this site on the top and sprinkled valentine sprinkles over it for a fun and yummy valentine treat.  Good job Brooke.

These brownies are awesome! This is the best brownie recipe I've tried from this site-- and I've probably tried a dozen. These are extremely rich and decadent. Bake with caution: addiction may be imminent. I get compliments on these everywhere I take them.

WOW!  I use to love the Betty Crocker Fudge brownie mix.  I have searched for a recipe to equal it.  This recipe TOPS it and then some!  I used 1 1/2 c raw sugar and 1 1/2 c brown sugar.  I used milk choc chips (because that's what I had).  Both chocolates were Ghirardelli.

My family loved them. I thought they were good but maybe a little too sweet. Maybe it was the guilt I felt as I added the 3rd cup of sugar.

AMAZING I used a cup and a half of white sugar and a cup and a half of brown sugar instead of just white sugar and i used a cup of melted butter flavored crisco and 6tsp of water instead of just a cup of butter. They're moist and deliciously chocolatey... I will be using this recipe again!

The best brownies I've ever had. They were so moist and rich inside. I made a double batch for my husband's work party, and the guys were hiding them in their cubbies. I made them again the following day for a Super Bowl party, and I had the same action there. I will never try another brownie recipe again!

This will be my go to brownie recipe from now on! A good combo of cakey/fudgy, but I'd say a little more on the fudgy side, which I like. Like another reviewer said, I usually avoide the edges on brownies, but the edges on these have a nice chewiness that I love! PERFECT!!! Really easy to make too.

Excellent taste, in part due to the butter.  The chewy texture of chocolate chips immersed in a cocoa rich egg batter is wonderful.  Do NOT use a standard 9x9 inch brownie pan as it is way too much dough.  If you resize recipe to serve 18, then you can use your 9x9 pan (and just 3 eggs).  I thought the flavor improved with standing for the 2nd/3rd day.  I cut them into small pieces (1.5 inch x 3 inches) while warm.  Then I stored them in a plastic container.  They were still "wonderful" on the third day.

I have made these twice. The brownies are great, good flavor, very rich and chewy. Personally I didn't like that they have somewhat of a thick hard crust. I also didn't like that the chocolate chips don't melt into the batter. I would have preferred a more consistent texture, I don't like that you get chunks of hard chocolate when you bite into your brownies.  All in all a good recipe, I'm still searching for the perfect brownie recipe, but this is a keeper in the meantime.

Followed recipe exactly as written. These are perfect. Usually homemade brownies can't compete with the boxed mix (in my opinion) in texture or taste and aren't worth the time and expense. These are! My daughter raced about them, and her compliments are hard to come by. This recipe will definitely replace the box mix in my house. Amazingly good.

Awesome brownie!  I took them to work for a baby shower and had great reviews.  I did the variation of 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups white sugar.  I also used the 9X13 pan.  Terrific results.  Thank you!

in 3 words: Best. Brownies. Ever. this was soooo good!!! I used dark cocoa and 60% cacao chocolate chips. I also added 1/2 tsp baking powder, the texture came out perfect...fudgy and slightly crispy on edges. The chips were like nuggets of deliciousness among the dense gooey-ness.

OMG these were fantastic!  I followed the recipe as it is written.  Since all I have are glass baking dishes I lowered the oven temp to 325 and they were done in 45 minutes.  I checked them with a toothpick a couple of times starting at 30 minutes into cooking time until they were done.  Because these are such chocolatey, fudgey, gooeyness I am certain that the toothpick will NEVER come out clean until they are burnt.  I had lined my pan with parchment and when it came out of the oven I let it cool for about 15 minutes.  Then I removed the brownies from the pan and let them sit about another 15 minutes.  Then I cut them into squares.  These are very rich & fudgey!  These are my new brownie recipe.  :-)

These were awesome.  ONe night I was craving brownies and didn't have a mix. Most of the recipes I found called for the chocolate squares.  I was so happy to find one that used cocoa powder. These fit the bill and more than satisfied my cravings.  I'm not sure I'd agree with 24 servings..I'd say closer to 10, lol.

Delicious!  I used 1/2 cup of plain yogurt for 1/2 of the butter like one reviewer suggested and I used half brown sugar.  I also added pecans.  Cooking time was perfect.

These were incredibly sweet, much more than I'd like.  I ended up putting 2/3 cup cocoa powder, which was plenty, and no chocolate chips.  It was chocolaty enough... but try cutting down on the 3 cups of sugar!

This is my new favorite brownie recipe. So easy, so rich- exactly what brownies should be! As an experiment, I added 2 tsps of cinnamon and 1 tsp of chipotle powder to the flour mixture and they came out really well- the spice is subtle but adds another dimension to the brownies. My coworkers keep asking me to make them again and again.

as suggested before I used 1.5 cups white sugar and 1.5 cups brown sugar.  I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet.    These were my first brownies from scratch and OMG they are awesome!  These are my new brownies from now on!

These had a wonderful texture--chewy, moist and fudgy.  I subbed in 1/2 c plain yogurt for a 1/2 stick of the butter.  These also took closer to 50+ minutes (used a glass dish).  The really shredded getting them out of the pan, which I did grease with the butter wrappers.  I didn't love the flavor of these, though.  Maybe I'll try subbing in half brown sugar next time?

These are the absolute best brownies I have ever made! My entire family loves them and begs for more each time I make them. My mom loves them so much I have to hide them to protect them from being eaten by her! If you love sweet, chewy, perfectly flavored brownies, look no further!

I followed the recipe exactly and am impressed with the texture--nice and gooey thanks to the chocolate chips, and very fudgy, but not at all "raw" like some reviewers complained about. I didn't have the problem with burnt edges that some had either. I do agree with some of the 1- and 2-star reviews, however, that this brownie is too sweet. The chocolaty flavor is lost amidst all the sugar. I'll be trying this again with less sugar and more cocoa.

These brownies are very good if you are looking for a super sweet, decadent, and dense brownie. And if you are a dark chocolate fan, they had a dark chocolate taste to me. A little too intense in sweetness and chocolate ( I know, sounds weird but it is possible) for my fam but still a good recipe for those who like their brownies the way I mentioned above.

They are very moist and just all around amazing. These are not your typical boxed brownies and they take very little effort.  I gave them as Christmas gifts and my family has already ordered me to make more next year.  I overcooked the first batch and kept it for my family. I thought I would have to throw them away but they were still gewy and yummy burnt.  Will make them again. Try them with peanut butter frosting. It is amazing.

First time I made these, they turned hard as rocks within a couple of hours.  So next time, I switched the 3c white sugar to 1.5c white, 1.5c packed brown.  Also made sure to pull the brownies from the oven at the minimum cooking time, even though the fork test didn't come out clean.  They cooled to absolute perfection!

Made these for the first time last night, brought them into work for rave reviews, and my fiance and I agree. Nice and moist, chewy but fudgy, and super simple to assemble. I followed someone elses suggestion to just whisk together the dry ingredients and that was much better than sifting. I will totally make these again, maybe with chopped nuts next time. Oh, and if you cut them big they're great for brownie sundaes.

EDITED TO ADD - I keep making these brownies so okay, fine, I guess they are pretty good after all! 

What's the big deal with these brownies? They're only ok. I followed the recipe exactly, I changed nothing and used good fresh ingredients. Should have used my usual brownie recipe instead!

BE WARNED - once you try these brownies you will never go back!! Normal brownies just don't have the same richness, deliciousness, thickness, chocolate-y-ness... there are just no comparisons to these brownies. I usually do 1 1/2 cups white and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar for an extra rich taste. The chocolate chips just make this recipe... if I am making it for young, sugar-loving kids sometimes I use milk chocolate chips as opposed to semi-sweet. I love how easy these brownies are to make. These are a classic in my family and I will continue to make them for the rest of my life. 5 stars!!

These are amazing, chewy, chocolaty brownies. YUM. I'm giving them in a Christmas gift basket and know they'll be a HUGE hit. I love the little pockets of chocolate that you get form folding in the chips. YUM!

Very good brownies, fudgy and chewy, with a crispy top!  I also did 2/3 of the recipe (scale to 16 servings) and made it into a 8x8" square pan.  Will use this one again!

THese are perfect brownies.  They are crunchy on the outside, and gooey on the inside.  They are very rich and have a good chocolate flavor.  I have made them many times and they do not let me down.  I do omit the choc. chips though.

Very easy, quick, and will come out great and not so sweet if you put 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar instead of the 3 cups white sugar.

BEST brownies ever!! I added half a teaspoon of instant coffee and it really brought out the chocolate flavor. Perfect in every way- chewy, moist, crunchy, and fudgy all in one.

These were delicious!  My only problem was the batter was too dry.  I added a little water to get it to the right consistency, and they came out great.

These brownies are AWESOME!  I followed the recipe exactly, being extra careful not to overbake (that's where I usually screw up).  They came out moist and absolutely delicious!  My husband loves brownies and I have now found my tried and true favorite recipe!

I make brownies all the time and I am always trying new recipes.  This is one of my favorites.  My family loved them.  The first time I made them I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar & 1 1/2 cups brown sugar.  They had a very rich and stronger sweetness if that makes sense.  The second time I used all white sugar and my family preferred it over the first.  I baked mine for 35 minutes, any longer and it would burn.  Remember that there are chocolate chips in the batter so a toothpick may not come out clean.  I used the recommended 9x13 pan and thought the thickness was perfect.  These brownies are very rich so a really thick brownie would be too much.

I finally decided to throw out my box brownie mix and make them the real way, but i wanted a recipe that would give me chewy moist brownies... that's exactly what i got with these! They're sooo good you'll be licking the bowl.  I added walnut to the batter because i like a some crunch in my brownies... add a big glass of cold milk and you've got the best dessert ever!

These brownies are phenomenal. This is the quintessential brownie-- chewy and oh so chocolately. I omitted the chocolate chips because I didn't have them on hand. I'll probably continue to leave them out in all subsequent bakings because I really don't think they're needed. However, I may add some chopped nuts next time. My husband said they were the best homemade brownies ever. I have to say that I'm inclined to agree!

I've made these about a dozen times now and they're the best brownie recipe ever. These are for true brownie officianados! They're very moist (make sure to cook them all the way through). They get a nice crust on top that make them perfect just dusted with powdered sugar. The chocolate chips take away the need for frosting.

Excellent. The key is to slightly undercook the brownies a little bit so that they are soft and chewey. I used an equal mix of white and brown sugar which made the brownie have a slight caramel taste which was fantastic. I live in Paris and bring this to the office for the French secretaries. The absolutely rave about it since you can not get a decent brownie in France. I also use a good quality chocolate bar instead of chocolate chips. I just break it up and mix in with the batter. So good!

So So GOOOOD - crunchy on the outside and oh so chocolatey on the inside - did make a few changes but nothing major - used margarine instead of butter (only cos i had no butter), used 1/2 & 1/2 white/dark chocolate drops & added some crushed Macadamia nuts. They took 33 mins to bake and came out just as brownies should be. Do try them you will not be disappointed. :-)

These are the best brownies I have made so far!  I had company coming over and decided to throw together a batch.  I didn't make the full recipe - instead, reducing it to 2/3 or 16 servings in a 9x9 pan.  Cooking time was the same.  I also used brown sugar for half the sugar required in the recipe.  The result was chewy and very chocolatey brownies that disappeared very quickly.  The guests were impressed!

This is a very decadent brownie! Wow! I followed the recipe exactly as written and will certainly be making these again. I used a 9x13 pan and also found that the cook time had to be greatly increased. However, they did not over bake and came out perfectly. I could not imagine making them in a smaller pan. I am a lover of all things chocolate and I am not sure that even I could handle them much thicker. This would be a great recipe to tweak a little for holiday baking as well - peppermint, toffee, etc. Thank you for a great recipe!

OMGosh, I am not the biggest chocolate fan, but do like an occasional brownie. I made these and my family went totally nuts over them!!! They were gone BEFORE dinner. I made another batch for church. It's almost 3:30 AM, just got up to get a drink and caught the hubby in them....half the pan is gone. I am now waiting on pans 3 and 4 to come out of the oven. LOL
UPDATE: For Thanksgiving I made 2 more batches. One of them I used a cup of andes candies broken up instead of chocolate chips. OMGosh they were awesome. If you like mint and chocolate you have to try this! These brownies are the bomb I wont use any other recipe for a brownie. I have been ask to make them for church and for the school teachers party.

YUMMMMM "O".. A MILLION TIMES OVER!!!! thank u for posting this wonderful recipe. It so hard to find the best brownie recipe. My recipe is so similar except it has only 1/4 c. cocoa and 2 cups sugar. so the extra addition is what completed my brownie recipe. I have been trying so many things to make my recipe  fudgeier and chewy and ur recipe helped thank u. I make mine in a large sauce pan and I also wisk the eggs seperatly in a bowl so I dont add too mush air into the batter. then I  fold gently. Remember a good brownie always has at least 4 eggs and no baking powder and is dense. so the less mixing u do to it the better the results. I also did half brown sugar and half white.thanx brooke they truely keep to their name. and to anyone who is looking for the best brownie recipe........ look no longer ... this is it.

These were very delicious!  I made them just as the recipe called for.  I did have to bake them much longer than called for.  At the time suggested in the recipe they were still very gooey in the middle.  The top did get hard and crunchy but the inside was chewy and fudgey.  YUMM!

I love these brownies! I've made them exactly as written and with modifications (1/2 cup whole wheat, 2 cups sugar with 1 bring brown sugar, 1/8 baking powder, 1/8 baking soda) and they both turned out great. The original recipe is sweet but wonderfully fudge-y. Try it as written first and then customize it.

I normally don't like homemade brownies, but I followed this recipe as is, and they turned out great. Very easy to make, and ingredients are all things I already had laying around. Make sure you bake them for the full 40 minutes, otherwise, they will be too chewy, especially if you like them a little crispy on the outside edges.

best brownies EVER!!!!  they taste like and have the same consistency of GHIRARDELLI brownies! yum!!  thick but chewy and fudgy. mmmm.  I filled about half of my 1 cup measure with both semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips (large, for chocolate chunks in brownies) and filled the rest of it with mini semi-sweet chips which created fudginess.  Also, the only change i made was to add 1/8 tsp EACH baking soda AND powder so it would rise a bit.  PERFECT!

This was good.  I used mini choc chips since I didn't have the reguar size.  I think I overcooked it, which affected the texture a bit.  They were good, but not super special.

wow, I have been searching for a brownie recipe that was just chocolate cake in disguise and WOW, this is so good. I found mine to be too thin since I halved this and baked it in a 9 inch pan. It was so awesome though, wished didn't halve it.

These are very good, especially considering that they are a recipe that uses cocoa, when I find that recipes using baking squares are better.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown, which tastes better and is better for you than all white.  I also used less sugar than called for - 2 1/2 cups instead of 3.  Someone earlier said these were too thin... I think you used too big a pan, because these were just right in thickness!  I iced these because I had chocolate icing that needed to be used, but they didn't need it.  Yummy :)

These were very good - I really enjoyed them & so did my co-workers. I followed the advise of splitting the sugar btwn white & brown. I also added 1/2 c Choco Chips & 1/2 c Butterscotch Chips - very tasty!

These are really rich and lovely brownies! They're strangely cake-like and fudgy and the same time! I usually like my brownies a little more dense, but will make these again! Don't forget your glass of milk! Thank you!

Loved these.  They are great and not hard to make.  Was afraid it would be too gooey, but after I let them sit for a little while and cool off they were perfect.  Everyone loved them.  I will definately make these again.

I ADORE these brownies!! I change a few things (and clear up a few): --I use 2 cups sugar & 1 cup brown sugar --Use unsalted butter --and cook for exactly 39 mins.  Make sure you don't over stir, as you are adding the sifted dry ingredients slowly fold it into the wet with under 60 strokes, 50 is best for brownies.  These brownies are best when cooled.  ONLY CON: The chocolate chips ruin the brownies in a way, so I only use them if I serve the brownies warm, if I'm going to serve them cold I skip the choc. chips (sometimes I add frosting)

I've made these twice, following the recipe exactly.  These taste their best the NEXT day.  Actually the first time I made them, I had one while it was still warm from the oven and thought that while it was good, it was not as good as the boxed mixes...Then the next morning (house was cold overnight) they were fudgy and amazing.  This will be my "go-to" brownie recipe from now on and will always plan to make them the night before serving.

Wonderful brownies.  Followed recipe to the letter but mine took about 45 minutes to cook.  Moist, flavorful, perfect with a glass of milk.  If you only try one recipe for brownies, this is the one you want.  I used a metal 9X13 pan that I recently bought.  The big glass ones just don't bake things well.  Thank you for the recipe.  It will go in my recipe box for good.

Delicious.  VERY moist.  The middle tastes *almost* uncooked - despite being so.  I used smashed Hershey milk chocolate bars instead of chocolate chips.  Also, I halved the recipe without any problems.  The crusted top sometimes detached when cutting them - but not very much.  Would definitely make again.

These are, hands down, the best brownies I’ve ever had in my life. The recipe is 100% perfect, and makes a great base for other desserts! I’ve also made these brownies with caramel chips (nice and gooey!), and peanut butter chips, and will definitely make all three variations again. These are also great with a homemade cream cheese frosting on it. 

All in all? The perfect brownie.

I stumbled acrossed this due to the picture!It looked so yummy! Anyway i read the recipe & it is the same EXACT recipe i have been useing for 15 years only doubled for 13x9pan.This is the perfect brownie!! A great candy type top with a moist fudgy center! Just as any good brownie should be! Needs no frosting or pretty much nothing to dress it up.It is perfect as it is with an ice cold glass of milk!!Sweet? Yes, but isnt that what a true brownie is supposed to be ,sweet, fudgy with a candy type top?! YUP!If you are used to box mixes it might be to sweet for you.But, if you love a good old fashioned brownie this is for you!! PERFECT!!

This is a delicious recipe.  I baked in a glass pan for 30 minutes, but think I will shorten the baking time just a bit and take out of the oven while still gooey.  Even so, they are delicious.

**I followed the recipe exactly with one small adjustment below :) turned out 10/10 and my family loved it as well.**  I was honestly really nervous because I thought that the brownie was going to turn out really dry because when I added the flour mixture into the chocolate mixture (and mixed it well), the batter was really thick so I decided to add about 1 TS (perhaps a tiny bit more) of milk which really softened the batter and the outcome was fantastic. the top of the brownies have a thin crisp and the color of the brownies are beautiful, light brown and darker brown swirling together. The taste was really sweet, but not to the point that my throat started hurting, it was pretty much perfect for a sweet snack and I can't help but suggest MILK with this, haha, it is excellent, thank you for the recipe BROOKE!  (Very moist as well. I forgot to pour the cocoa powder through a strainer so there might have been tiny clumps when I put the batter into the oven and it still came out amazing!)

A-MA-ZING! So i was googling brownie receipes cause I had a craving and stumbled upon this and happened to have all the ingredients in the house anddd my name is Brooke so I was kinda excited at the coincidence lol.

What - are you kidding me?  How long has there been a way to make brownies that didn't involve opening a box?!  These brownies smell, and taste, yum-arific!!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I used 1c regular flour and substituted the remaining 1/2 c of flour with whole wheat flour - my pitiful attempt to make these more nutritious).  It did take a bit longer to cook than the 40 minutes stated in the recipe but that was probably due to my elderly oven.  These are definitely worth making on a regular basis.

These were great fudgy chocolate brownies.  In an attempt to make them slightly healther (yeah who am I kidding right?)  I made the following substitutions:  2 C. Raw Washed Sugar and 1 C. Brown Sugar, 1/2c applesauce and 1/2 c butter and substituted 4 TBS flax seed and 12TBS water for the eggs.  Still turned out to be the best recipe I've made!!

Delicious brownies. This was the fist time I ever baked brownies and my husband fell in love. I did half white and half brown sugar as suggested and it turned out delicious. Thanks!

Yummy! I substituted half of the butter for cream cheese and eliminated the salt (cream cheese was already salty), also i used whole wheat flour( i swear it dosn't change the taste, just a grittier texture)and they turned out phenominal! NEW FAVORITE BROWNIE RECIPE FOR SURE!

Maybe I should have followed the directions. I took some of the other reviews and added 1 c of brown sugar and 1 c of sugar. I thought the brownies could have been sweeter. I think next time I'll add a cup and half of each. I also baked mine for 40 min. 35 min wasn't long enough. Every one at work loved them. I personally thought it needed more sugar, but I'll go with the masses with their opinion.

These are just as described, RICH, dark and chocolatey!!! If you don't want a rich brownie, add less sugar or omit the chocolate chips.  I made half a recipe in a8x8 pan for 35 min, and got very thick fudgy brownies. bake longer if you want a little chewier. I loved them!!!

Far too sweet and rich for my family.  Even my 11- and 7-year-old kids declined seconds.  Too bad!  They smelled so good baking.  Maybe I'll try again with less sugar and margarine in place of butter.

These came out amazing! Made them in a 13x9 pan and I was shocked at how thick they were without containing baking soda! These are the perfect chewy, fudgy brownie. I followed the recipe exactly, except, (oops) I forgot the vanilla extract. Also, my oven went crazy during the cooking and completely lost temperature! Despite all of this they still came out delicious!

Wow!  I must confess... I am one of those people who reads a recipe and without even trying it the way it was created makes substitutions.  I RESISTED THE URGE and FOLLOWED THIS ONE to the T with the one exception that I used homemade infused vanilla sugar instead of plain granulated.  (I do this with nearly all my sweet baked goods and it does not change the chemistry at all.)  Because of the intense chocolate flavor you may want to serve these with some softly whipped cream.  Simply amazing!

I made this recipe AS IS and they turned out perfect and the best 'traditional' brownie EVER. I ate one a couple hours after they were made they were pretty fudgy but after they sat a whole day on a plate with saran wrap they are even better! Thanks!

Baked these for the husband's bday (he doesn't eat cake).  They went over well. This was my first attempt at homemade brownies and thanks to this recipe I was successful. I hope you are a chocolate lover because these are really chocolaty.  Will definitely bake these again.

These brownies are best the next day.  If you can make them a day ahead of time.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were great, my husband loved them.  He said everyday he thought that they were getting better and better.

These were the best from-scrach brownies I've made. Brownies have been one area where my home made version didn't compare to the boxed mixes. Frustrating, since I like to avoid hydrogenated oils. Two small changes: I used 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour (for nutrition) and 1 cup brown sugar (for flavor) and they are great. Chewy, fudgy and rich. No more boxed brownies for me!

I'm on a quest to find the best brownie recipe at the moment, and so far, this is the best one I've made! Do not omit those chocolate chips!  Be sure to use a glass 13x9 baking dish, and take out the brownies just when they're done- do NOT overcook! One of the easiest brownie recipes I've found!

I followed the recipe to a T and cannot understand why they came out so dry. I cooked them for exactly 35 minutes at 350 and they have no moisture in them. They are dry and bitter, almost like the cocoa powder has overpowered them. They don't have the crackly top that I love brownies to have. I will certainly not be making these again.

Very good! I baked them for 50 minutes in a 9 X 11 pan and I probably still should have baked them longer because they were kind of gooey (I was concerned about overbaking). That's trial and error for ya, though. I'll definitely make them again, though.

Wow these are AWESOME! I cut back on the butter usage by using 1/2 cup of apple sauce and 1/2 cup of butter. They still taste amazing!

These brownies got only the best of rave reviews! They create a near heavenly taste in your mouth that is somewhere between fudge and brownie! These will become a regular in my kitchen.

These are really good brownies. I made them once before, and they were a hit with my family and coworkers. This time I followed some suggestions made in other reviews.  1) I lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees, since I was using a glass baking dish. 2) I combined milk chocolate with semi-sweet chocolate chips. 3) I used one cup each of white and brown sugar. I cannot imagine how sweet these would be with three cups of sugar. Ugh! 4) I didn't melt the butter beforehand. I just made sure that it and the eggs were at room temperature before I began mixing my ingredients.  I highly recommend these brownies!

So, overall a great homemade brownie recipe, but felt it was a little heavy on the salt.  Will scale it down next time and maybe even give the half white/half brown sugar thing a try. Definitely worth baking and eating.

Yummy, yummy, yummy...  Mine were cross between brownies and fudge.  I guess I could of cooked them a little longer but after I refrigerated them they were perfect.  My mom said they were really good and she's a brownie lover.  This one's a keeper folks...

Quite simply the best brownies I have ever tasted! I made it into a cake for my boyfriend: cut the pan into two sections, stacked them (with chocolate frosting in the middle, of course), and frosted the outside just like a cake! Makes for a quick, easy, delicious triple chocolate dessert! Goes well with a cup of coffee and a spoonful of ice cream.

Brownies are my absolute favorite dessert, and this recipe did it perfect justice! One of the best parts is that the brownie itself is sweet enough that I don't have to add frosting like many others. This is my all-time favorite chocolate brownie recipe and I get raves every time I make it. Thank you!!!

These brownies were rich and simply stunning. The texture and consistency were exactly what people would expect with a box recipe, but, of course, made from scratch! On a second run through, I cut out half a cup of chox chips and half a cup of sugar, and found them to be perfect! I would suggest this as an option for people who find the recipe too sweet. Simply add a little more cocoa/flour (1/4c in total). Loved it though, and I am grateful to Brooke for sharing this recipe!

YUM! These are really good brownies. I was very skeptical to make them after reading that they required 3 cups of sugar, but I am glad I decided to try them. We tried them basically right out of the oven and the pan! They were warm, gooey and scrumptious. My hubby loved them. Second time I made them I used Mexican chocolate and cinnamon. They tasted like a Mexican hot chocolate in brownie form! This recipe is a winner~

It is like heaven, the chocolate one... All the measurements are exactly like in the recipe, only I used 1c white sugar, 1c brown sugar, and 1c of Splenda... My husbands wanted it less chocolaty, so I reduced the cocoa powder to 3/4 cup one time. He said he would pay money to eat it...

What a fantastic brownie recipe! Sometimes, when the recipe calls for this much sugar you might get a grainy texture, but this was smooth, fudgy and delicious! Akin to that box you get at the store, but oh so much better! Don't change a thing about it and you'll be much rewarded. I'll have to take these to work or I'll eat them all!

These brownies were amazingly fudgy!  I added chopped walnuts to the batter and were a big hit!  They tasted great a la mode or by themselves with a glass of milk! This is a great basic brownie recipe to add anything you want.  Next time I make these I'm going to try to make them into turtle brownies!  YUM!

Perfect for a chocolate craving! I used White chocolate morsels instead of chocolate chips and they came out fine. I also did the half brown sugar idea from some other reviewers. I'll try the regular recipe next time (and there will be a next time) I make these, only out of curiosity. SOOO GOOD! (I might bake them longer as well...they were a little too chewy/moist/tender on the bottom but perfect for our craving) They lasted 2 days!

These are the best brownies ever. Very dense and chocolaty.  The only thing I changed was that i left out the chips because I didn't have any and I used the icing from "Zuchinni Brownies" on this site.  Amazing!

Having been embarassed by box brownies I decided to try to find a simple basic recipe for brownies for my son and husband who both love them.  My small modifications were using good quality chopped and melted semi-sweet chocolate and using a 13x 9 glass pan.  The cooking time was approximately 45 minutes for the toothpick to come out clean.  Once cooled there was a lovely smooth sheen to the top.  The edges had a lovely, slightly crunchy texture, but the center of the brownies were moist and chewy...a lovely texture.  Definitely a nice quick recipe for great brownies.  Not the most fudgy that I've tasted, but I've never liked brownies that were too fudgy.  Worth the calories.

I thought these were pretty dry. I used a sugar/splenda blend. I'm not sure if this affected it. I'll try with regular suf=gar to see if it helps the moistness.

I tried this recipe and it is so  good!!  I didn't change anything in the recipe.  I can not say enough about the texture!  If you don't like rich fudge chocolate brownies then these are not for you!  I served this with vanilla bean ice cream!!  HEAVENLY!!!  Thanks, Brooke!

OH MY GOSH!  Sooooooooooo good!!!  This is what a brownie is supposed to be.  Not too cakey, not too gooey, just super thick and delicious!  I used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white, like others suggested and it worked great.  I tested the center with a knife after 35 minutes and it came out gooey, baked for 8 more minutes and it was gooey again, until I used a toothpick-duh!  It was totally done, I think the chocolate chips were what made it seem gooey still!  So it was a TINY bit overdone, still...so tasty!!!  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

I've made these brownies probably 4 or 5 times so far and they just seem to be getting better and better. I've lessened the sugar somewhat and added less chocolate chips because it was a little sweet for our taste but these are so good! If you have a sweet tooth or you're a chocolate lover like me, they'll be gone in just a couple days!

I thought these were good when they came out of the oven, but that's not hard to do.  What really impressed me was how good these are cold.  They stayed chewy for days.  I think they are very rich, so I wouldn't make a pan again for just my husband and I, but they would be a huge hit with company.  The chocolate chips make them extremely rich, so I think those could be left out.  I used 1 1/4 cups brown sugar and 1 1/4 cups white sugar.  Turned out great.  Update:  I have since made these many times for parties.  I do cut the amount of chocolate chips in half.  Also, I use Penzeys cocoa and found that makes a HUGE difference.  Made at my mom's house once with Hersey's cocoa and they tasted terrible by comparison, so really good cocoa is a must!

Oh my goodness...these are amazing. They remind me of the boxed Ghiradelli brownies I used to make. I LOVE IT! I'm currently enjoying some with a glass of milk and I can honestly say that any chocolate lover will love this recipe. I can't wait to try different things with this recipe! Thanks Brooke!! :)

These extremely rich brownies are very good, but probably not the best I've had simply because they didn't keep that well.  I refrigerated half and froze half and both batches got dry around the edges.  I would recommend making these for a large crowd that will be devouring them quickly.  I took the advice in other reviews and used 1/2 brown sugar.

I highly recommend these brownies.  I added a cream cheese bar 1 egg and 1/3 cup of sugar marbeled in between half the batter.  They were amazing.  Many thanks Brooke!

Absolutely fantastic! i have made hundreds of brownies over the years and this recipe is by far the best. i added a couple packets of instant coffee granules and also 1/4 cup chopped dark chocolate. My husband took them to work after a very long day and they all said the brownies gave them an energy boost!

These were really good, no doubt.  But the sugar was too much for me.  I don't think that I avoid sugar that much, but these made me feel buzzy.  Maybe half splenda next time or something, this just didn't feel kind to my body.

These were wonderful!! I did as the recipe said, then mixed pecans into half of the batter. I dusted my pan with sweetened chocolate which gave them a chocolately crusty crunch.(like they needed more chocolate, ha)! They were almost gone before I could get them cooled down!! I've been asked for the recipe already, and also asked to keep this one handy, as I'll be asked to make these alot more often!!!!

These brownies have become known as "THE Brownies" within my group of friends.  The recipe is fantastic on its own, but I discovered something great.  Instead of a 9x13 pan, I use a 9x9 pan.  You will have to cook them longer, as this batter is already quite thick, and now in a smaller pan so it's not spread as thin. Depending on your oven, it may take 15 or 20 minutes longer.  The result is a brownie that is crispy and lightly crunchy on the outside, but warm and fudgy on the inside.  Just make sure to keep checking them with a toothpick in the center - the moment that toothpick comes out clean, grab em and throw them on a cooling rack!  You won't be disappointed.

Super yummy!  They were a hit at the office.  Followed the recipe exactly, but chopped the chocolate chips in food processor before adding them.  Next time I'll add nuts.

This one is a keeper. The finished product came out moist and chewy, the way good chocolate brownies should be. I only altered the recipe at one point: I used three cups of brown sugar rather than standard granulated white sugar. I don't think it detracted from the recipe in the least. These brownies are worthy of a stout glass of milk and a big, soft arm chair. Definate diet-crashers, if you are a careful calorie counter. If you are- you may not want to taste-test these goodies---all inhabitions go out the window in a New York minute!

I have made these brownies several times and they have become the only brownies I will make EVER. I had my daughter make them today and she assumed one cup butter was the same as one cube butter, but it didn't effect the recipe at all. I like to pair these with the Rich chocolate frosting from this site and it is THE BOMB!!!

These people aren't kidding. These brownies are amazing. I used brown sugar and half whole wheat flour instead and they turned out soo good. This is my go-to recipe from now on.

I was looking for a great made from scratch brownie recipe and this is definitely it!  People call them my "to die for brownies".  Only change I make is to use half white and half brown sugar. YUM!

Great brownies! I didn't have cocoa powder so I substituted with six 1 ounce bakers chocolate squares and they came out great! I also poured the batter into a large muffin pan (I can never cut brownies into neat little squares!) which drastically cut down the cooking time. It only took about 12 minutes! :) Also, after I put the batter in the pan, THAT'S when I added the chocolate chips, I just threw them on top! Excellent!

Tremendous! I've been looking for the right recipe to use with my Baker's Edge pan. (See bakersedge.com). This is it.   I used egg beaters instead of real eggs and substituted in milk chocolate chips. The result: flakey slivers of chocolate on top, nice, slightly crunchy edges, and chewy but not too dense insides. A keeper.    Updating comments: I now use peanut-butter chips and this makes the brownies even better. The peanut-butter provides great contrast to the chocolate ...

I have made these brownies multiple times and each time everyone loves them.  They are a request now for parties.  I haven't changed the recipe and always mix with a spoon, the only thing I will occasionally do is swap the morsels from milk to white.  Oh, one more thing, I cut them in little squares because they are so rich.

HOLY ! These are the best brownies I've ever had. I baked these for my dad for father's day, and he went back for thirds. They are the best because of the massive amounts of chocolate in the mix.

Yay! It's important to know that I don't usually like homemade brownies...first of all, brownies aren't my favorite dessert anyway, but I just prefer boxed for some reason. These. Are. The. BEST! Hands down. I didn't have semi-sweet chocolate chips, so I just left them plain. I can see where they would make them taste amazing, though. I added a milk chocolate frosting from the can, and they are fabulous! Would be great under vanilla ice cream!

I love everything about these brownies except the sugar, I reduced the sugar by 1/3 and they are plenty sweet, moist and fudgey. I made them once with mint chocolate and they were fantastic.

I usually make, and put my own twist on boxed brownies, but I thought it was time to do it from scratch. What a great recipe! I made it with white sugar this time and mini chips and it was terrific. Next time I'll try the brown sugar/white sugar mix!

These are the best brownies I have ever had! Made the recipe as written except used Heath chips instead of chocolate chips beacause that's what I had. They did take longer to bake for me; closer to 50 minutes.

I cut the sugar by 1/3 and it's fine. Goes very well with coffee. Taste even better the next day.  Will make it again with chopped walnuts.

Hmm...I am a brownie lover. My favorite dessert is brownies. I have eaten *MANY* brownies in my lifetime... :0) And these were not my favorite. They are good. I like them...but they just aren't what I would consider "the bomb". They do not have the texture of a brownie that I would want to eat over and over again, nor the flavor. I will keep searching...

When you think about the your childhood version of a 'brownie' this lives up to the years of idealization! I used half brown and white sugars, and added almond extract for a extra hint.  Next time I will try a little coffee. Great brownie!

My family loves these brownies.  I have been making these for a few years now and I never alter the recipe.  To make them even richer, top with chocolate frosting (my husband's favorite) or just serve plain (my son's favorite).  I like to use my brownie pan with the premade brownie shapes to make them perfect.

I made this using half brown sugar with the white sugar like some of the reviews said. My husband ate 4 big pieces when it was done. They were awesome. I think the box brownies have a funny taste to them so I have always looked for a homemade recipe for brownies and this is it.

This is by far the best brownie mix I have found.  Having a love of brownies anyway, I always try to add something different, be it Heath bar, almond instead of vanilla or even peanut butter chips along with the chocolate chips.  The more the better.  I have passed this recipe along to many people....definitly a keeper!!!  Thanks

Very good! I used other reviewers suggestions and used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet by personal preference. They were extremely decadent!!!

Rockin' awesome brownie. It's a bombshell, alright. :) We like these even better than Hershey's Best Brownie. The eggs are used as the leavening, so they're chewy, moist, rich-flavored, and don't tend to get crumbly the day after like brownies mainly leavened with baking powder. This one's staying in my recipe box for sure.

This is my new favorite.  I've made them twice in one week.  The 2nd time I reduced the eggs to 3...still wonderful...and we like to add walnuts.  I will make this over and over again.

after searching for the best brownies i decided to go for this one.what can i say..it was good but little too sweet for my taste.it was not clear if you have to sift coco powder with flour or mix it with melted butter.to be on the safe side i mixed butter and coco powder. it didn't do any harm to the overroll taste.i had to freez half cos i thought i might eat all of them.thank you brook for your recipe.

These brownies were excellent!  Half of the pan was gone before they were totally cooled.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  Way better than my usual brownies.

This is my go-to brownie recipe! It is delicious and has such versatility! I make it as directed, but I sprinkle 1 cup chocolate chips on top before baking. We love this recipe as is, but we also love what can be done with it!

Another variation: I had someone request marbled brownies. I prepared Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies, but didn't bake it. I mixed together the following ingredients:

6 oz cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg
2 Tbsp. milk

After mixing, dollop on top of brownie batter. Swirl with knife. Bake as directed per Bombshell Brownies recipe. 

When I made the marbled brownies I only used half of the cream cheese peanut butter mixture per batch of brownies. I refrigerated the other half until a couple of days later when the first batch of brownies had disappeared. Let the cream cheese mixture come to room temperature if you refrigerated it. 

Can't wait to see what else I can do with this recipe! Thanks for a winner!

I made these exactly like the recipe calls for and it was a huge hit at the party!  I had so many compliments!  I am making them again tonight as a desert for a bbq and have no reservations that these will be a knockout once again!  They are so easy to make...and I don't bake...until now!

This was my first attempt at making homemade brownies NOT from a box:) I loved these and how they required ingredients that are always stocked. I cut the recipe in half and baked in greased 11x7 metal pan. The only problem I had was them sticking, so next time I will butter/flour the pan better. I also frosted the top of these with the fluffy PB frosting from this site. Chewy, moist and delish! Thanks Brooke.

Really good brownies! The texture of these brownies were great, they were simple to make and everyone who ate them really enjoyed them (including myself).  I will definitely add a little espresso to the mix next time to up the chocolate flavour.  But overall, these were delicious.

I mad these for a dinner party and will NEVER make boxed brownies again! My husband was raving about them. I had some leftover homemade frosting that I drizzled on top and it was a perfect touch. I cooked for 35 minutes because I really like my brownies soft and like other users I used half white half brown sugar. Next time I want to try caramel pieces and drizzle with caramel sauce. Yum!

AMAZING!!! Please listen to what Brooke says! They are soooo fudgy! U will love them. I was a bit sceptical at first coz I thought it was a lot of sugar so I reduced the amount to 2 1/2 cups instead of 3 and they turned out absolutely perfect! Everybody in my family are fans and they all want the recipe! I did have to cook them for a little bit longer than stated but only 10 mins or so (just keep an eye on them). Also, When I was adding the eggs I whisked them in with an electric mixer and I think it added a nicer texture. Can't wait to whip up my next batch!!

These aren't something I'll be making for the staff room, but the high school judo team will love them. I didn't make the recipe exactly as stated, and in this recipe I think my alterations changed the taste/texture a lot. I replaced 1/2 the butter with plain, unsweetened yogurt. I replaced one egg with a tablespoon of milk. I cut out 1/2 cup of sugar and will probably use even less next time and replace some of the cocoa with low-cal hot chocolate mix or melted bittersweet chocolate instead (if you cut the sugar and leave all that cocoa, I can imagine getting some bitterness or strange aftertaste). I added nuts, which help cut the sweetness a bit. This recipe comes out very fudge-y, which is something many brownie recipes are missing and I appreciate.   I started getting worried because as they were baking I read all the low-score reviews; odd aftertaste, dry, mushy, etc. But these came out well for me. I think over-mixing made them cake-like for some people, so it helps to only mix by hand and only until just combined. It also helps if all your ingredients are room temperature, including the eggs. I soak mine in warm water for about a minute before adding them. I cooked mine in a 9x13 pan and actually took them out 10 minutes before the 35 minute baking time I had set. They smelled done, despite what my oven timer had to say about it! They didn't toothpick-test clean, but I don't think they should. I covered them with foil to cool to keep the edges from getting hard, and on

I can only give 3 stars to this recipe.  It is WAY too sweet--it was like eating chocolate tinted sugar crystals!  I even cut down on the sugar to 2 1/4 c. and it was still too sweet.  last time I made it, I used 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar, but it gave them a really weird taste.  I was hoping to find a good fudgey brownie similar to what you get out of a box, but these were cake-like.  I read a lot of people suggested to use a 11x7 pan to make them--but they came out way too thick when cooked.  I had to up the cooking time, too.  I kept checking it w/ a cake tester and kept ending up with raw batter.  15 extra minutes later, there was STILL rawish batter, but I didn't want to keep them in any longer because the outside would've been overcooked.  This just wasn't my fave brownie recipe.  I will keep looking.  Thanks anyways!

These brownies are wonderful! Ok, so these are the first brownies I've ever made from scratch so I followed the recipe exactly...white sugar...13x9 pan...the whole bit. I did bake for 35 initial minutes but wound up having to bake them 20 extra minutes before the toothpick even came close to coming out clean. So I took them out after 55 minutes because I was afraid if I left them in they would come out like bricks. Even so, the toothpick wasn't clean. However, after letting them cool for an hour, I cut them into squares and they are fabulous! Chewy without being runny, hard or grainy. Nice and chocolatey. I love them for the very reason a lot of people don't...they ARE very sweet. This is exactly what I was looking for and I got it without sacrificing texture or taste! Thanks for sharing. This is going in my recipe box and will be made often.

These are delicious fudge like brownies. I've made them 3 or 4 times now and they turned out great everytime. I've actually never included the chocolate chips so I'm sure they are even better with that addition. I did have one person tell me they were too sweet. I guess I have a really sweet tooth because I didn't have a problem with the sweetness.

These were really awesome brownies; a great balance of fudgy, chewy, and moist. Like several other reviewers, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar (mostly because I ran out of white sugar). The brownies came out great.

Thank you for a recipes that uses cocoa that is truly a FUDGY BROWNIE.  I did change the size of the pan, however.  I tried them once in a 9x13 at 350 degrees F. and they didn't work out.  The next batch I tried in an 11x17 jelly roll pan and shortened the baking time to 30 to 35 minutes.  They were PERFECT.

Wow! These were awesome.  Chewy, chocolatey, rich, sweet, thick, and delicious.  These are the best brownies I've ever made/ate/inhaled.  I was actually sad when I finished eating my first one.  So, I cheered myself up and ate a second.  I almost popped out of my pants--I told you they were rich! These brownies are a gift from Gahd. Thank you, Brooke!

Hard to go wrong with butter, sugar and cocoa but these were very good brownies.  I used dark chocolate cocoa and they came out heavenly.

I made these brownies 2 different ways - first exactly as directed, which got rave reviews, but I wasn't wowed; the other way I substituted the flour for nonfat powdered milk since I don't care much for flour.  It rose high and then fell, which was expected, but it was the best tasting, chewy, chocolatey, delicious, dense, brownie me or my boyfriend have ever had... I'm making more tonight!!  I preferred them at room temp to hot or cold, but my boyfriend prefers them cold... hot, the modified recipe is far too crumbly to eat by hand.  Excellent recipe either way!

This was indeed very good.  My son accidentally added a couple of Tablespoons of water.  I also added about 1 1/2 oz. chopped up Fair Trade chocolate bar that had a pretty high concentration of cacao.

These brownies are the best..not too sweet and just fudgey enough. I made one addition, I added cream cheese to the middle and this was FABULOUS! I will throw out all other brownie recipes, this one is the best.

Ok.  These tasted good but I could not get them cooked!  I had them in the over well over an hour and they were still raw AND spilled all over my oven making a HUGE mess.  I followed the recipe exactly so unless the altitude made a difference (we live a mile high), then I can't imagine what happened.

I halved the recipe, even though some said not too. They turned out really good. I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I added white chocolate chips to half. I baked them for about 27 mins and they were perfect. Fudgy and smooth.

Best brownies I have ever had!!  The only change made was I used vanilla sugar (that's all I had), and they turned out great.  It seems like too much sugar and cocoa when you make them, and the batter is really thick, but they turn out awesome, and I don't think they are too sweet.  I cooked them for 40 minutes and they were moist, chewy and dense.  Also, make sure when you mix the butter, sugar, and eggs, you do it well, I don't think you can over stir it.  I think the people who gave it a bad review because they said they could feel the sugar did not mix it well enough.  I will definitely make them again...and again.  Also, this is only the second time I have baked from scratch, so if I can do it, anyone can!

Very Good!  I did not use the extra chocolate morsels the reipe called for and they still were very good.  I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar like others suggested.  Will use this recipe from now on.  Thanks!

BEST EVER!!!!! Better than any mix, any brownie you buy at a bakery, coffee shop, etc.  I did use 1/2 c low fat vanilla yogurt and 1/2 c butter (instead of 1 c butter) AND I used a pinch of Baking Soda to add a crisp top.  Absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!

Absolutely the best brownie recipe I have ever sunk my teeth into! Even my 6 year old who doesn't care for chocolate couldn't get enough of them!  I added some semisweet chocolate chips to it, just to cut the sweetness a little.  What an amazing brownie recipe! I'll never buy boxed mix again!!

I make this recipe all the time.  Sometimes I use the Hershey's special dark cocoa powder.  Sometimes I frost them with homeade buttercream that I flavor with a bit of peppermint oil. Whichever way I dress them up, they are always a hit!  Thanks Brooke :)

Very good! Extremely thick batter, it was hard to spread in the pan, so I kept dipping a metal spoon in cold water which made spreading very easy.  I also added a little almond extract for extra flavor.  I reduce the recipe to 18 servings and baked it in a 11" x 7" pan.  Yummy ;)

These brownies were wonderful!  The only problem I had was that even after adding 8 extra minutes, the toothpick never came out clean and when they cooled completely the edges ended up so hard that we had to cut them off.  So that's what we did.  Everyone seemed to like them - I thought the flavor was great.  Substituted peanut butter chips for the choc chips - very good.  Would make again.

great!  thick and fudgy.  they did need to bake about 10 minutes longer than the stated time -- I was concerned that the toothpick was wet because of the melted chips and not underdone batter, so I finally took them out, just in time.  kiddos loved this recipe!

followed recipe exactly - they are wonderful and taste very similar to the boxed kind but are "fresher" and more authetic.  cook longer than you think though - my tester went into chocolate chips twice so i underbaked them and wish i had baked them longer.

We love these, too. And I'm a chocolate and sugar LOVER!   We have egg & dairy allergies and are trying to cut down on sugar, so: I used 3/4 cup safflower oil instead of melted butter, 1/2 cup white sugar + 2 cups light agave syrup instead of 3 cups sugar, and 4 Tbl flax seed meal + 12 Tbl hot water in place of eggs. Best brownies I've ever had.   I also made a ganache topping. Bring 1/2 cup oat milk (soy allergies, too) to a gentle boil, remove from heat, add 1 cup chocolate chips and 4 Tbl pure maple syrup. Stir until smooth and drizzle on top of your brownie before serving. Yum!

Awesome texture, too sweet for my liking!  I will definitely make these again but next time I will make a few alterations. I am going to cut back on the sugar and substitute nuts for chocolate chips. Gives these brownies a try.

Amazing and easy brownies! I made a few modifications based on ingredients I had on hand and personal preferences. I used dark chocolate cocoa powder, and the result might be too rich and bitter for some but was just right for me. Also substituted all the AP flour with 100% whole wheat flour -- my boyfriend couldn't tell the difference. I coated the semi-sweet chocolate chips with some flour like one reviewer suggested to prevent the chips from sinking. Next time I want to try using yogurt in place of 1/2 the butter like another reviewer mentioned. Either way, you can't fail with Brooke's bombshell brownies!

These brownies were great!  I added butterscotch chips and pecans to mine, and they really took care of my chocolate craving.  Very rich though, I could only eat a small piece (maybe that's a good thing, though)!

The best homemade brownies I've ever made.  I've been searching for a chewy, dense brownie for my husband & this is it!  I made them last night for him - he went on & on about how wonderful they are!

Amazing and practically foolproof!! I used half white and half brown (well, golden :) sugar as the reviews suggested, as well as a touch of baking soda for a crispy top and a bit less salt. Delish!! Everyone said they were the perfect sweetness, and no one believe me when I said it was the first time I'd tried the recipe. Yum.

Move over Betty Crocker!  These brownies rivaled any box mix I have ever made, and I think I would feel guilty ever wasting my money on one again!  I'm so glad I found these now as they will make such cute Valentine's Day gifts cut into little hearts.  Moist, chewy, rich, fudgy, thick, just the right amount of light cruncy top layer, and of course a great fix to any chocolate lover's craving!

This is my new favorite brownie recipe!! They're everything I've ever wanted in a brownie. I've made them twice. The first time I overbaked them because I baked them until a toothpick came out clean. I could tell they  tasted good (so I gave them another chance), but they were hard. So the second time I took them out before the toothpick test said they were done, but the top was set so I figured that was close enough. They fell a little in the middle, but were so chewy, gooey and yummy!! I will do it this way from now on. I didn't change a thing about the recipe. They were thick and had that thin crust on top. No icing needed since they're sweet. I'm not sure why some reviewers said these were thin, mine were about 1 and 1/2 - 2 inches thick! Make these ones, you won't be disappointed.

This recipe is excellent. Chocolaty, moist, chewy and just right! Except: I cut the sugar in half. Seriously. I can't imagine how super-sweet it would be otherwise.

These are delicious - I did use 1 cup brown sugar and 2 white sugar as per earlier reviews.  The only other thing I changed was to use dark chocolate for both the cocoa powder and the chips.

Awesome!   I used 1 cup of brown sugar and then the rest white.  UNBELIEVABLY moist.  Then I sprinkle the tops with pecan halves...so they toast up nicely while the brownies bake.  Seriously..perfection in a brownie!  THANK YOU!

Fantabolous! I let the kids make these while we were snowed/iced in, and they were gone by the time the kids went to bed that evening. So simple to make, but the taste was complex and elegant. We loved them! They were dense, fudgy and moist, with an amazing crispy/crunchy top layer. This will now be my go-to brownie recipe!

I really like this recipe, but it was a little too sweet for me. I tried cutting the sugar in half. It's a lot better to my taste. I also cut back on the butter, I put some heavy cream instead. It made the brownies a little fluffier.

Nice, chewy brownie with a paper-thin, crispy top.  I used white chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet, and added a couple teaspoons of instant espresso powder and a pinch of red pepper, which added some depth and punch to the recipe.

Love it!  Awsome homemade brownies - so much better than a box mix.  I followed other people suggestions and used 1 c. white sugar, and 1 c. brown sugar and I thought they came out just as good as when I followed the original recipe.

This turned out alright. Baking it at even 35 minutes was too long for me, though, as the sides were burnt and it wasn't gooey at all. Tastes great! I used 2 cups of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar. It's still very sweet, so next time I may cut down a cup or use another sweetener like apple sauce.

You have to try these!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe short of leaving out the chocolate chips.  I noticed that others found the brownies thin, however I did not find that at all.  Perfect!  Will definitely be making these again.

This was my first time making homemade brownies and I will never buy them in a box again!! The best brownies I have ever tasted. I lined my stoneware with parchment paper and then drizzled white chocolate over them once they cooled. I will try with nuts next time.

I had never made brownies from scratch before, but I was out of brownie mix and tried these.  They are quick to assemble but are a grainier texture due to all of the white sugar - definitely not for those who like cake-like brownies.

these brownies are amazing!! instead of 3 cups of sugar, i used 2.5 but i used 1.25 cups of cocoa. and instead of salt, i substituted baking soda in to make them thicker and fluffier. amazing. a really big hit, they were gone in a second.

Fantastic brownies. My family went nuts for these. I cooked them in an 9in by 13in pan instead of 9 by 9. Great!

soooo good and easy to make - i used half butter/half crisco and it tasted great - i added walnuts to half the pan after spreading the batter and then used a knife to zigzag them into place.  that way both my hubby and i got what we liked.

These were great, although a little too buttery.  I'm not sure if this was because of the butter itself or because of the substitution of brown sugar for half of the white.

I used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar as others suggested but followed everything else. Baked for almost 40 minutes. They came out fudgy just the way I wanted! Might try with less white sugar next time. Note the quality of choco chips you mix in matters, so does the quality of cocoa. 

I topped a batch with some cheesecake batter I got from another recipe for cheesecake brownies and they were perfect. Yummy!

These were good but they didn't seem to cook enough in the middle even the sides were really crunch and hard.  I took them to work and they disappeared quickly so they must have been good.  They just didn't keep there shape very well and were a bit too gooey.

These brownies are easy and delicious!  I used half brown sugar, half white sugar and baked in a slightly smaller dish.  I sprinkled white chocolate chips on top of the brownies during the last minute in the oven.

Used mini loaf pan to make this for our Halloween potluck at work.  Decreased the sugar to 2 cups, and used semi-sweet chunks instead of chips.  Baked for 20 minutes, but should've baked for a shorter amount of time, maybe 15-17 minutes.  However, it tastes wonderful!!!

I made these and took them to work and everyone LOVED them. A few of my coworkers said they were the best brownies they've ever eaten. I followed the recipe as stated but used semi-sweet squares that I cut/shaved down to small pieces and baked them on top of the brownie mix. It came out great. I would only suggest using the regular morsels for the mini morsels as trying to make the squares into smaller pieces killed my hands and arms. They were excellent brownies! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Wow!!!!!! It's like I never tasted a brownie before.  This is by far the BEST brownie I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly....didn't use a mixer, just a bowl and wooden spoon to mix.  I used one unsalted, and one salted real butter.  I also lined my pyrex dish with parchment paper, which is a must for almost all baking in my opinion.  The top was crispy and inside moist and gooey...just like a real fudge brownie should be.  I'm not a big fan of semi-sweet chips, so I used milk chocolate chips instead.....delicious....yummy to the tummy.........

these were awesome. sooo rich and decadent. i would recommend baking for the full 40 minutes though cause 35 minutes produces a more cakey and moist brownie whereas the full 40 minutes allowed the brownie time to develop that chewy brownie texture that i was looking for. thanks for the recipe!

So yummy!  Next time I will cut back on the sugar about 1/4 C.  I added about 2 C mini semisweet chips, maybe this made them sweeter, but I like a lot of chocolate chips in my brownies.

Brooke you have outdone yourself! I made these yesterday. My husband likes for me to add a light layer of buttercream frosting and then a top layer of unsweetened chocolate to his brownies. Rich, moist,....perfection! I had no problem with them falling or not cooking through as some others stated.

The brownies are really good.  My husband is also a boxed brownie fan, but not anymore.  I've made three batches of these brownies this month alone!  I did add 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1 3/4 cup white sugar, and 1 cup brown sugar as others have recommended.  And I split the flour between white flour and whole wheat flour.

I didn't have vanilla extract, so I subbed Almond Extract (half of the amount called for) and it gave it almost a cherry taste.  These were a big hit!  I used semi-sweet chunks instead of chips and it gave it more of a gooey consistency.  Next time, though, I will try milk chocolate instead.  Using semisweet gives it a *very* rich chocolate flavor and I prefer a "lighter" chocolate taste.  Overall, great recipe!

These are amazingly fudgy and chewy on the inside and little crispy on top.  I love the texture of these brownies.  I followed the recipe with no adjustments and I would highly recommend keeping it that way.  Let cool completely or they will fall apart.  Definitely a keeper and worth trying.

I never made  brownies from scratch, but these were real easy to make and I had everything on hand , and taste so much better than a box mix. I took it into our office today and had many compliments. Only thing different I did was to use only 2 1/2 cps sug, I cooked it in glass 13 x 9 pan and only for 30 minutes. They were perfect.. I also added frosting as if they weren't sweet enough. My Boyfriend tasted them and said  your not taking them all to work are you lol, So I did share with him. Great recipe thx

These brownies are sensational! They are rich and fudgy and exactly what I was hoping for. I like that there is no oil, as it seems to make a nicer texture. Everyone loved these. I tried to save a few in the freezer and they were found quickly. They were eaten by the end of our get together...even the frozen ones!

These are absolutely the best brownies. Moist and soft on the inside slightly chewy and crisp on the edges. I love them. Only thing I did differently was to use half brown sugar half white sugar. I have also made them with chopped pecans or walnuts, and half pan with white chips.  I really love them with the pecans.

These brownies are amazing!!! i have been making these brownies about a year now and everyone loves them, says they are the best!! i like to spice them up by turning them into to turtle brownies (that i am now famous for) just melt some carmels down and add a little cream and drizzle over the top of the brownies, add chopped pecans, and drizzle chocolate ( I like using white, dark, and milk) all over the top. Beautiful and so so yummy!!!

I made some modifications:
I used 1.5 cups of white sugar, 1.5 cups of brown sugar (the brown sugar gives it a slight caramel flavoring, and gooey texture)
I also baked these for 25 minutes, and kept the brownies in the oven for another hour and a half so the top layer is nice and crunchy, but still retaining the center soft and moist.

Next time, I'll use less sugar because it was a bit sweet for my taste. Other than that, it's pretty good.

Wonderful recipe! I wanted to have mint brownies without making a more complex recipe and searched far and wide for a good basic recipe that would produce an ooey gooey brownie with a mint flavor. This was amazing! Worthy of singing!

These brownies had a great consistency and didn't burn or anything for me. I kept them in the oven for 35 minutes, then added another 5, for 40 total.

The only thing was that the taste was a little off. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I may try to do one suggestion of reducing the sugar to 2 cups and adding 1 cup of brown sugar. I could also be too much butter. I just get an extra tangy kind of taste that I didn't like too much.

These are ridiculous!  I've been hunting for "The Best Of" for all the cooking and baking staples.  This was the first recipe I tried for brownies - I don't have to look any further!  They are absolute perfection.  I can't wait to make different varieties, but for your basic yummy chocolate brownie ... THESE ARE THE BEST!

These brownies were good, but I didn't give them 5 stars because I cooked them for 30 minutes only and the outsides were starting to burn.  The inside brownies were good, but could have been chewier.  Next time I will turn the temperature down a bit or cut down on the cooking time even more.  I only used 1 c white & 1 c brown sugar like people suggested.

Update- 1/14/19- these are still super yummy and so easy to make!  I used a Brownie Icing Recipe off this website and they're delicious!


OMG, words don't describe how delicious these were!! I followed the recipe exactly as most other reviewers have done and they came out PERFECT!!  I did put a chocolate fudge frosting on top of them, which made them extra chocolately!!  So easy to make and so much better than the boxed brownies!

I made these brownies exactly to the recipe and they are fine brownies just as they are. Usually I like frosting on my brownies, but it’s not necessary with these. I did use mini chocolate chips and they are nicely distributed throughout the brownies. I baked these in a new dark-colored pan and even after lowering the oven temperature 25 degrees I still slightly over-baked them, but that just gave them a crunchy “crust” around the outside of the pan. A toothpick doesn’t always come out completely clean even when the brownies are completely baked. I will add this recipe to my brownie rotation.

I have been looking for this recipe for 8 long years! Every since my husband told me he didn't like my cake brownie recipe and he preferred the box (egad!), I've made it my mission to find the perfect moist, chewy brownie... look no further, because this is it! Yes, there is lots of butter and sugar in this recipe, just don't eat the whole pan yourself! This is a terrific recipe! Note: I prefer 1c white sugar and 1c brown. I also add 1c chopped nuts if I feel nutty. But they are great just the way they are.

This is the best brownie recipe and it deserves a 5 star rating across the board.  I followed the recipe to the tee, but since I am such a chocolate crazy woman I frosted it with chocolate frosting.  They were perfect! Thanks, Brooke.

These brownies are so yummy! Chewy near the outside and super moist in the center. I made them for my sister-in-law's birthday. She loves peanut butter so I made a few changes: I used 1/2 cup semi-sweet choc. chips, 1/2 cup peanut butter chips. I poured in  half the batter, added several dollaps of chilled peanut butter, then covered with remaining batter.

Wonderful!

When I made these I didn't understand the recipe completely and ended up melting my chocolate chips and adding them to the batter. I ALSO added the other half of the bag of chocolate chips. I used Semi-sweet because it's all i had. When we tried them, they were AMAZING. i h9ghly recommend them this way. I've since made them 3 more times and they just disappear!

these were so ridiculously yummy, no-one could resist them! I made it into a disposable aluminum pan, to take with me on a camping trip, and though i'd made them the day before, they were lovely and moist. I made no changes apart from the fact that i instead of chips, just used melted chocolate. 
I can definety recommend.

This is my new GO-TO recipe for Brownies!  I do tweak it a little but it is still amazing. I add one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown. 3 eggs and one cup of flour. We also take them out of the oven a bit earlier and let them sit and cool off so they are uber gooey!!  Perfect hot with some ice cream!! I have to freeze them in batches so I don't eat all the brownies in a day.

This was the absolute best brownie recipe I've ever had! But, like the others, I did a litte adjustment.  I dropped the sugar down to 2 cups, the eggs from 4 to 2, cut out all the butter and used oil. But what texture! Oh, and I tried 1/2 Dutch Process cocoa and 1/2 good old Hershey's (one of my favorite). Dark, fudgy, yummy!  Took them to a family picnic and they were gone in 1/2 hr.  The kids didn't get a chance to try them, the adults finished them off like a bunch of starving soldiers.

These were ok.  Yes, they were chocolatey, rich, and chewy.  But they stuck to your teeth like toffee.  Not the BEST EVER in my opinion.

These were better than any mix or brownie recipe I have ever tried.  They were a little sweet and a little chewy but that was probably my cooking technique.  I scaled the recipe to 6 servings and I made them into brownie bites using a small muffin pan.  I cooked them for about 14 minutes and it made 16 bites. I think next time I will do the same and cook them for about 12 minutes.

For the first time, I made these exactly as written.  They turned out fudgy and delicious.  Next time around (and there will be a next time) I will cut the sugar back just a bit as it was a little too sweet.

I vow to never make box brownies again. These were so easy and perfect.  I was out of white sugar so I used 1/2 light brown and 1/2 white sugar and no chocolate morsels.  I added 1/2 cup chop walnuts and omGosh! Wonderful I could eat the whole pan. Thank you.

these brownies are the best!!!!!! i definitely wont make them from the box again. the only thing that i changed was that i used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. my husband is a tough critic and i made them the first time with the semi-sweet and he only rated them a 8.5. he told me that if i made them with milk chocolate them he would definitely rate them a 9.5-10... ill let you know what he rates them.

I adopted this recipe about a year ago, and have not made any other brownie since!!  If you like your brownies ooey gooey fudgie sweet rich and chocolatey, this is the recipe for you!!!  I have made them without the choco chips, and my family loves them just the same.  Have also made with peanut butter chips, MM's, toffee bits etc...any candy will do.  I have also used low fat, low cholesterol margarines and egg beaters for my parents.  The recipe is just as tasty!

To those of you who said "I should have known better...too much butter and sugar..." Well...yes, you should have known better!  This is NOT a recipe for cake, it's a recipe for fudge brownies.

Many KUDOS Brooke! Your brownies are a beautiful thing!

These rock!

I added a tsp of Almond Extract and used 2 cup white sugar 1 cup brown sugar. 

I'm sure they would have been delicious otherwise but I'm going through an almond extract phase.

The brownies were easy to make and just the right amount of chocolate. I only added 2 1/2 cups of sugar. My boyfriend says these are 3 1/2 stars and very good but not 5 stars. He's weird. lol He fussed at me for not buying the box brownies when I was preparing this and ate this whole pan of brownies himself. Go figure. I dont have a sifter and just dumped the flour mix into the eggs without sif0ting. I'm not sure how much of a difference that makes but still was yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

WOW,when I finally decided to make these for my family I was short a few ingrediants. I only had 1/4 cup (if that)of Chocolate Chips, and when I measured the Unsweetened Cocoa powder I only had a little over 1/2 cup, so for the remainder I used General Foods International Suisse Mocha Sugar Free Coffee Mix and Oh My, they turned out awesome. I can't wait to make them the right away. I did have to cook mine for about 45 minutes, not sure if it's because I used a glass pan. Will NEVER make brownies from the box again.

These were great!  I halved the recipe as my bunch likes a different dessert each night (and I love to cook ALOT!) and made this in an 11x7 pan and they turned out SO good!  My youngest was begging for one the second they came out of the oven they smelled so good while they were baking.  Thanks for a keeper!

I've been using this recipe for over 10 years. The brownies are very rich, perfectly fudgy, and always well received. I leave mine in the oven for a couple extra minutes and occasionally top with a chocolate cream cheese frosting.

Just amazing!!!
This recipe is perfect. The brownies were easy to make and turned out great. I brought them to work and everyone raved about them. Try adding different types of chips for a twist. I added a handful of white chocolate chips inside and Reese chips as well as Smarties on top.

Cook for at least 50 minutes however.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I have made them twice now.  The first time they were soo perfect, very fudgy.  The second time I realize how sensitive this recipe is.  A small mistake and the gooiness is gone!  They were still just as yummy but for all trying the 1st time make sure you are exact on measurements, and don't over mix or bake.  Thanks Brooke.

This recipe turned out perfectly!  Gooey on the bottom, chewy on top, everything a good brownie should be :-)  Definitely not too sweet for my tastes, but maybe I just have an overly sweet tooth.  I did use a mix of mini semi sweet chips and milk chocolate chips (stray leftovers from other recipes).  Didn't seem to matter--they both melted into the dough, making it even more chocolatey and delicious.

Wonderful!! Try shortening the baking time by 5 minutes for moist, fudgy brownies that rival the Ghirardelli brownie mix! Finally, a from-scratch recipe that uses powdered cocoa and tastes like a mix!

Without a doubt, the best brownie recipe on this site! They are so fudgy and scrumptious!! My fiance and I could not get enough of them. I followed the recipe exactly and I would not change a things, except adding PB chips, or white chocolate chips for a change of flavor. So good! Thank you!!

WOW is all I have to say, I've never made brownies from scratch before and these are the bomb. The crust is great and the brownies are moist and chewy..I did add extra chocolate chips about 1/2 a cup but that was the only change!!!! Thanks so much.

Soooo moist! I've made them exactly how the recipe stated and they're great, but be prepared to drink a big glass of milk!

The second time I made them, I tried a user suggestion to use half brown sugar. It does give it a different flavor, but unless you love brown sugar I would just stick to the white sugar. 

I also cut the vanilla down to 1/2 tablespoon. I found the vanilla flavor to be a bit much, almost like the alcohol didn't burn off either. It took away from the brownie to me. I've also found that chocolate chips are good, but not necessary.

But either way, these are amazing! my boyfriend and roommate devour these things as soon as they're cool enough to touch! great recipe!

These are good, but they are super rich!  I like the Deep Dish Brownies from this site a little bit better than these, but these are still very good, just have a glass of milk handy!

I didn't care for these... they kind of left a funny after taste in my mouth. I halved the recipe- and it was still a huge amount! I baked it for 30 minutes- and it turned out great. The texture is nice and the first bite is yummy. Its just the weird after taste... Maybe its the bourbon vanilla I used or the huge amount of sugar? Oh well.. this is a good recipe, but not the best homemade brownies I've ever had.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! I have a fan oven, and baked the brownies at about 145 / 150 degrees C for 35 minutes, putting foil on top towards the end to stop them browning too much on top.  I then switched the oven off and let them finish cooking in the warm oven for an hour - they turned out *perfectly* fudgy.  Definitely a recipe I will use again and again and again!

it is a really good recipe for moist and chocolately brownies. it is not the chewy or the cake like type! which was exactly what i was looking for! i only added 1 1/4 cup of sugar and 1.5 sticks of butter. i think it was a good amount of sweetness. if you serve warm, with ice cream it will be just perfect! i think it is too rich so i might cut back on the butter and eggs next time.

Simply put, these brownies are da bomb!  They are extremely moist and very chocolatey.  My only comment is to make sure you do not overcook them even a little because the ends turn very hard.

I made this recipe as written except I used half white and half brown sugar and I didn't have any chocolate chips on hand so I just left them out. This recipe is really simple and easy. The texture of these brownies is the best of any other recipe I have tried. Not at all cakey. Very rich and chewy. They are really sweet, so I may cut back on the sugar just a little next time. I will definitely be making these again.

These brownies are fantastic! I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and lightly floured them before mixing in the batter (so they don't sink to the bottom) and they were a hit! Next time I am going to follow one reviewer's tip and do half white sugar and half brown. This is my favorite brownie so far! Thank you for the recipe and Happy Cooking! Update: I have made this multiple times and included milk/semi-sweet/peanut butter chips a couple of times. If you prefer a more candy like fudge brownie then the white/brown sugar mixture is a must! My sweetie took these to work for a luncheon and they were quickly gone leaving another's brownies for the next day. ;)

The brownies are THE BEST; fudgy, moist, chewy, and soooo chocolatey!  I followed the recipe exactly but used a 9" square pan and baked them for 45 minutes.  The perfect brownie!

Yummy!! These brownies are soft, cake-like with a rich chocolate flavor. I took the advice of cutting back on the sugar, it didn't make a difference in flavor or texture. I also added peanut butter & chocolate chips. I really liked that addition. Thanks to my 8 year old daughter's suggestion. Try these, you will be glad you did!

Incredible - this is the best brownie recipe I've ever tried, and I've tried many.  They are so deep and rich.  I brought them to class the other day and everyone asked for the recipe. I usually cook them for slightly less time than recommended, maybe 5 minutes less, just to keep them from getting too chewy.  They are even good if you omit the chocolate chips.  Love!

I used almost all whole wheat flour and they were still SO AMAZING! The top got hard like always on home made brownies. They were so rich and delicious, they are replacing my mom's recipe.

The best ever!! Instead of chocolate chips I added really mini peanut butter cups (I get them at an amish market) and cut the sugar down by 1/2 a cup. They were moist and delicious!!! This is my go to recipe now for brownies.

Oh my goodness! My kids wanted to make brownies, but I was out of boxed mix. What a stroke of good luck because these were some of the best brownies I've ever had!

My son and I love the espresso brownies from Starbucks, so we did add a couple of tablespoons of ground coffee beans. The result was nothing like the Starbucks brownies, but these were rich, gooey, and more chocolaty than I expected. Maybe it was because we used real butter? Yum! It would be hard to go wrong with this recipe. Thanks!

Updated note: I was out of mini chocolate chips, so I used the chocolate/peanut butter swirl variety. If possible, they were even better the second time around. I've had multiple requests to share this recipe, and I wish I could take complete credit for it!

I was just revisiting these and couldn't remember if I rated them.  But boy do they deserve 5 stars!!! Make them exactly as indicated.  They are amazing!  I'm tempted to make some tonight, but afraid of the consequences around my waistline.  LOL  HIGHLY recommended, easy to make.  Agree with other reviewer about melting butter in microwave and love the idea of using a whisk instead of a sifter (since I don't have one).  Thanks for the great recipe, Brooke!

I love brownies and can have at least 3 at one sitting.  But these brownies I can only have one.  They are very good but are heavy.  Not your typical "cake" like brownies from boxes.

These are the best brownies I've ever had!  I followed the recipe as written except I used margarine and not real butter.  If you like your brownies dry and crusty and kind of tasteless with a slab of frosting on top then find a different recipe.  Thanks for the great recipe!

these were very good straight from the oven, but as they sat they gained a sort of grainy texture and they weren't as chocolatey as what i would have liked.. but i'm looking for something that tastes like a boxed brownie.

all i can say is that they were good, easy to make (the batter will be very thick) and people seemed to like them in general. heat them up before eating!!

Very easy and delicious recipe. It was nice that I had everything onhand, but it was even better that I didn't have to wait for the butter to soften. I just popped it into the microwave from frozen and I was ready to go! I made it for my fiance and a friend of his, and the friend took home the leftovers! The only change I made was to sprinkle the chocolate chips on top instead of mixing into the batter.

These are quite good.  Not the BEST, but when I don't have the ingredients needed for my favorite brownies, these work out well. I wish I could give them 4 1/2 stars, they are just not a 5 star for me.

These brownies were divine! I was a little worried about all the sugar, especially when the batter came out grainy, but they don't turn out too sweet! The cocoa and chips create the perfect balance for a rich, delicious brownie. My picky little brother (who usually makes fun of my baking) ate 5 in one sitting and told me they were WAY better than brownies from a box! No more box mix for me :) Thanks Brooke!

I must have overcooked these because they were super crunchy around the edges but too fudgy in the middle.  I may try them again.  If I do, I'll update the review.

I made these brownies tonight at work. I work in a home for terminally ill men and wanted to make them something sweet. Being that it is a non-for profit organization, we have a limited amount of funds, therefore a limited amount of ingredients to work with. I had to use some subsititutions. First, we had no cocoa, so I had to use extra melted chocoate chips instead. Since I did that, I added some cinnamon and walnuts to dress them up. They still came out great! I am going to make them at home, following the exact recipe, but I am sure they will turn out just as my family likes them. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe many times now and it is by far the best. The only thing I alter upon the suggestion of others is to make it 1.5 c. white sugar and 1.5 c. light brown sugar. Also, if you use mini chips they seem to blend in with the mixture and lose the form of a chip, causing an awesomely chocolate concoction. These are definitely the best brownies I've ever made.

These are the best brownies from scratch ever! I made it with 1 cup brown sugar and 2 cups white, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I personally don't like them straight out of the oven; they taste salty and a little strange. But they're superb the next morning--rich and fudgy and perfect! Of course, if you're a "boxed" brownie person, no scratch brownie will equate. But for those who like good homemade brownies, these are simply the best!

Yummy!  Made as called for, except for adding peanut butter chips as well as regular semi-sweet chips.  Even my husband who isn't a chocoholic like me loved these.  For sure a make again recipe!

These are by far the best brownies. I tried the recipe the way it is written and I also tried using half the sugar in place of brown sugar. I prefer using all white sugar. This is a great recipe. Everyone that has tried it, loves it!

Excellent recipe...very fudgy and chocolatey.  I turned the chips in a little bit of flour, so that they didn't just sink into the brownie.  Excellent as written.

This is the best recipe for brownies I have ever used, I've tried many before and after, but now I'll be sticking to this one. The brownies are deliciously crunchy on the outside and gooey and chewy in the middle.

Moist, rich, and chocolately!  I did use half white sugar and half brown sugar like others suggested.  ***I made 2 different recipes (rated about the same) from this website.  I took them to work to see which one was more preferred.  Hands down, these brownies won!  Even the brownie queen loved these!  Hats off to you Brooke!  Thanks for the recipe.

Wowsers!  These are getting compliments left and right around here!  People are saying they need this recipe; it's the one they've been searching for!  I've made them twice now, and it definitely pays to follow the directions, as given, in assembling them.  I increase the recipe to 1 3/4 times, and bake it in a half-sheet pan, which is larger than a jelly roll size.  For that amount, I decrease the sugar by only 1/4 cup, using 2 cups brown and 3 cups white; and I use 1 stick margarine, and 2 1/2 sticks butter.  What a treat for chocoholics!  This is definitely replacing my old brownie recipes;  Thanks, Brooke!

I made these exactly as written, except that I decreased the sugar by about 1/4 of a cup. These had a perfectly fudgy texture and were probably the best homemade brownies I've made.

These were great!  I have tried many brownie recipes from this site and this one blew them all away.  I cooked them a little longer (about 10 min.) and they came out so chewy.  I love chewy!  This will be the only brownie recipe I use from now on.

These are the BEST brownies ever!  The middle of the brownies were cooked perfectly.  I used 2 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and it was perfect. I also folded in a large piece of parchment paper on the bottom/sides of the pan and greased the sides, and nothing stuck to the pan. Cleaning was very easy. If you want them to be very moist, I think cooking time should be limited to 30-35 minutes. I will be making these again and again.

Good brownies, but a bit too chewy. Maybe I'm just not the 'bombshell' type!

These came out okay,not great.  Very dry and not moist at all.  I did change the recipe by adding only 2 cups of sugar to cut down (1 white, 1 brown)  That must be the problem.  Maybe I will try again and use full amount of sugar although it just seems like so much!

Fantastic...I used 1 cup brown sugar and 2 cups white.  They were perfect served 2 hours out of the oven.  I used the last of all the chocolate chips I hand...a mix of dark chocolate, white chocolate, and semi-sweet.  I had to extend the baking time by about 10 minutes and the edges got a little crispier then I like.

Very good rich chocolate basic brownie mix. Everyone loved them. I like to add different texture so I used 2/3 choc. chips, 1/3 caramel, 1/2 cup walnuts and also added some coconut, oats & marshmellows. They were very thick, chewy, choclatly and delicious. Will make again now that I have a rich chocolate recipe!

These brownies are very sweet and fudgy!  As suggested by other reviewers, I used 1.5 cups white sugar and 1.5 cups brown sugar.  It's good that way, although I guess I don't know what the difference is between using half brown sugar and using all white since I haven't tried all white.  I removed the brownies from the oven a little before a toothpick would come out clean to make sure they didn't overcook.

I never thought that I would be able to make delicious brownies from scratch, but thanks to Brooke, I have!  These are fantastic!  Moist, fudge-y, dense ... you just can't ask for anything more from a brownie.  I did not use the chocolate chips (personal preference), and I can't wait to try them with walnuts!  It's "bye, bye" to the boxed stuff!  This is now my go-to brownie recipe.  Fabulous!  UPDATE: I made them again with walnuts ... Fantastic!  Love 'em!!

Absolutely delicious - I went on the wild side and made these with Galaxy Cocoa Powder and they were to die for - all eaten very quickly! Lovely texture - gorgeous cold straight from the fridge or heated with a little ice cream on the side - Yummy, will be making these again!

YUMMY!! These are excellent brownies! Seeing the biggest recommendation was to add brown sugar, and the biggest complaint was too much sugar, I did the 1.25c white sugar and 1.25c brown sugar. I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips. It makes a large batch, and you'll definitely have your chocolate fix after 1 or 2 squares, so my biggest tip is to give half of them away to neighbours or co-workers. Better their thighs than mine!

This was a fantastic recipe. I made them as the recipe called for originally, then I tried it again only I melted the chocolate chips and mixed it in. My family doesn't like chunks in brownies so it worked quite well. It came out like the Hershey brownie mix. Very delicious and moist. The next time I make them I will try as everyone else suggested and do 1 1/2 brown and white sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

The BEST brownie recipe I've ever used. This is now my only brownie recipe. I really like the rich chewy moistness that this brownie has that is usually unattainable with brownie recipes.

YUMMY BROWNIES!!  Followed the recipe exactly (baked in a glass pan at 325 degrees) and they are sooo good!!!  Next time I may add some chopped nuts and it's nice to have a great tasting recipe that has all the ingredients normally stocked on you shelves!  Thanks Brooke!

I made these for my family last night, and they were a big hit! Even today they stayed moist and delicious. I did take the advice to go with 1 1/2 C. white sugar and 1 1/2 C. brown sugar instead of just 3 C. white sugar that was called for. I also added 1 1/2 C. cho. chips. This was a great recipe and it will be a family fav from now on...thank you.

AH-MAY-ZING!!! These were super thick, so have milk on hand! I used no calorie sugar for some of the sugar, but used the same amounts of every ingredient. DO NOT SUB anything! They are great!

These brownies are excellent!  Way better than box mixes.  They are very easy to make.  I used a glass 13x9 baking dish, and I lowered the temperature to 325 degrees and baked the brownies for about an hour.  They came out perfect, and they cut very nicely.  From one Brook(e) to another...Thank you!

Excellent brownies...especially good with ice cream of course.  These don't compare with Crocker's Triple Chunk, but I like having a delicious alternative to store-bought mixes, especially when the ingredients are so handy to have around anyway.

This is a good basic recipe.  I think I prefer cake-like brownies and that's probably why I'm only giving it four stars.  Should you only want to make half the recipe I would recommend using a 9X9 pan and cook the brownies no more than 30 minutes.

These were very good and didn't last very long at my house.  I also took the advice from some of the others and used 1 & 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1 & 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Will be making these again very soon.

These are fantastic!  They are rich, thick and very chocolaty!  They are easy to make, and similiar to Ghiradelli's brownie mix.  One of our boys gave it a 4* because he thinks they need bigger chocolate chunks, easy to remedy:)

Wow..I made these last night and they are *amazing*. I took others' advice and took out a cup of sugar, but I used milk chocolate (from leftover Easter candy) instead of semi-sweet. I really love them, though. They are extremely fudgy, and you need a glass of milk to think about eating them. Haha.

I made the recipe as written and it was fabulous. Crunchy on the outside and very moist on the inside. This is now my favorite brownie recipe. Thanks!

Just made these today. They are soooo yummy and fudgy! I'm glad I chose this recipe. When I make brownies for anyone (or just myself lol) this will be the one and only recipe I use! I did make a minor change. Like someone else suggested, I did 1 1/2 c white sugar and 1 1/2 c brown sugar. DELICIOUS! THIS IS A WINNER!

Might not have been the most eye- catching addition to a table covered in goodies, but there was only one plate with just crumbs left... and everyone was looking for more.

These brownies were very good and were gobbled up pretty quickly.  Not the best I have had, but very good nonetheless.  I will likely make them again.

By far the BEST homemade brownies I've ever made. So rich, chewy and has that perfect brownie 'crust' on the top. I had to make a few changes. I only had 3 eggs so I added a couple tablespoons of sour cream to make up for that. I also, I ran out of white sugar and used some brown sugar. I think it made it extra rich. I put mine in a 8 by 8 pan because I like them THICK!

I didn't try them myself but got rave reviews, including from my 5yr old. The only change I made was per other reviewers was to do half brown and white sugar. Thank you very much for this recipe. Will definitely make it again.

These are amazing! I used half natural (demera) sugar and half light brown sugar. I only had 2 eggs, so I used EnerG egg replacer for the other two and it came out just fine! Very fudgey, just how I like them :)

Excellent! This will be my brownie recipe from now on. I did sub. half a cup brown sugar because I ran out of white. I think either way they would be awesome.

These were great fudgy brownies. I made the recipe exactly as stated and they came out perfect.  I might try the milk chocolate chips next time just for variety along with walnuts.  My picky kids also loved these and gave me hugs and kisses for making them!  It's a keeper.

Okay, I didn't realize how easy it is to make homemade brownies.. Wow!  I tried this recipe and it came out AMAZING!!  Soooooo chewy! I also added a whole bunch of finely chopped walnuts on top before putting them in the oven and it added not only extra flavour but also an extra "eye-pleasing" touch to the brownies.  I'm sticking to this recipe!

Sadly these did not turn out well for me. They were extremely dry. I know that my oven is quite off in temperature so that could be the problem . I even took them out 15 minutes ahead of time. My husband says all you have to do is put them in the microwave for a few seconds to melt the chocolate chips. That with a tall glass of milk makes it easier to swallow I guess.(LOL) So not totally unedible.

Very good...I was short one egg, and reduced the sugar to 2 1/4 cups, and they came out very fudgy and rich.  They were tough getting out of the pan, even though it was greased, and the top was a bit crumbly with the insides a little gooey, but the flavor was awesome.
