Yum! Great combination of fruit flavors and oh so refreshing on a hot summer day.  I froze my fruit and opted to use fat free greek vanilla yogurt.  Very tasty and very easy to throw together!

My daughter just made this exactly as written. She drinks smoothies everyday. I came across this while voting for photos this morning lol and we had everything for it. My daughter said it was absolutely delicious and she'll definitely make it again!

A refreshing smoothie! I think the banana definitely adds to the creaminess of this smoothie. I did add some ice because I love my smoothies ice cold!

I used greek vanilla yogurt and frozen strawberries. Honestly, I had to triple this recipe to make three smoothies. Maybe we REALLY like big smoothies, idk. Either way, this was extremely tasty. The kids and I really liked it.

I used orange juice as we didn't have the pineapple but in no way would I give only 4 stars because of that.  This was excellent and will pick up the pineapple juice to try it that way.  Both ways are probably excellent - whatever flavor you have in the fridge will probably work.  Good post!

I make smoothies every day and this is good but to me the purpose of a smoothie is to get a little "green!" Add a serving (1 cup) of spinach- you can not tell it is in there except for the lovely green color, and you've had a spinach salad as well as your serving of fruit and protein (yogurt)

This is DELICIOUS! I only gave it 4 stars because I have no pineapple juice, so I had to use OJ. My kids are gobbling it up right this second!

I had some pineapple and strawberries left over from a holiday gathering, so I put the pineapple in my Vitamix and made juice of it. Then I added the strawberries, fat free plain Greek yogurt, and half a frozen banana since I was making only 1 serving. I love how refreshing this is and that it needed no additional sweetener. It does make small servings though.
