I really like the concept of this recipe. Although, I would like the bbq sauce a little sweeter, saltier, or smokier. This is a little more vinegary. Maybe, I had the unfortunate experience of growing up too much on the bottled stuff. The prep for this recipe is very easy, even the bbq sauce. I only had a package of 6 chicken legs, so I halved the recipe to try it. I also cut the sauce cooking time in half. The chicken takes considerably longer than the 1 minute suggested. I recently had bbq'd chicken legs at a party, which made me choose this recipe. I would definitely consider something like this, to attempt again, to feed a group for a bbq along with other meats. It's very affordable to make and there is much more meat than typical chicken wings. ty

I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday party.  It was a huge hit without a piece remaining.  I did breasts, thighs, wings and drumsticks all with the same recipe and they turned out great.  I do agree with doubling the sauce.  We will definitely be making this one again.

This was my first time trying to barbecue, and it was pretty good. I made a few modifications along the way. First, I doubled the spice rub, (something I highly suggest) to make it more flavorful. I cut the cook time for the sauce down a little bit because it had started to burn. My biggest problem was the complicated cooking over indirect heat. After cooking the chicken as long as I could without burning it, I realized that it still wasn't cooked in the center. I ended up putting it in the microwave to make it safe for consumption! If I were to make it again, (which I don't think I will), I will probably cook it the way I would normally, basting along the way!

We liked this recipe. I cooked 2 (joined) legs and thighs. I did add 1 TBS. each of molasses and brown sugar to the sauce. Browned leg quarters about 7 minutes on each side then turned and basted every 10 minutes. Very good and moist.

Great recipe with lots of flavor.  I had two leg/thigh pieces that had to be used or I was going to have to toss.  They marinated overnight.......and then the torrential rains came.  I was not going to make my husband stand in the rain to grill these.  I put them in the oven for 20 minutes and then added the bbq and continued to bake until they reached the internal temp of 165Â°.  The flavor was delicious and the chicken was so moist.  I can't wait to try this again, when we can grill them.  'Best Vodka Sauce' with pasta from AR was served with it.  Thank you rachelu, for sharing your recipe.

This is a really good and overall simple recipe...I did however make a few changes as I was out of some time, but I think this would be perfect as is! My changes are: I had three packs of chicken that would have gone bad it not used asap, so I tripled the recipe and hoped for the best. I started too late to marinade for the stated 9+ hours, so I made the paste, and marinaded for ~2 1/2 hours ( it turned out great, but I'm sure 9 hours gives more flavor.) Then I made the sauce, we have some heat loving people in our family and it seemed as though it might be a little too sweet, so into the sauce I added ~ 1 tea cayenne pepper, and some hot sauce. I followed the advice of some other reviewers, and do agree that the chicken could be browned for a lot longer than one minute. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans...Yum!

This was my first attempt at BBQ chicken legs. It was easy and the results were good. My only thing, and this is not the recipes' fault, is that it took a lot longer than 45 minutes to get the legs up to 165 degrees. Now that I've done it once, I know I need to turn my grill up a bit higher next time. That's not why 4 stars though; it was good, but I usually give 5 stars to recipes that absolutely amaze me. This was a good primer on BBQ legs, and I'll probably do it again :). Thanks!

Turned out great even though it was my first time using indirect heat on the grill with chicken.  I cooked them longer than suggested, but the meat was very tender & juicy.  I skinned the drumsticks to reduce the fat and they were delicious.  I will use this recipe with all kinds of other seasonings & sauces. thank you!

This was so good. the sauce and marinade cooked into a nice glaze. Added some rooster sauce to the sauce for a little kick to some. Both ways was good. We had no left overs.

This was some of the best BBQ chicken I've ever made. It came out perfect!  It will definitely be my go to BBQ chicken recipe for guests this summer. The rub and sauce was easy and DELICIOUS. I only had 6 legs, but still made the amount of rub the recipe called for which I think worked out perfect. If I had the 10 legs, I think it would have been a bit light. I also only refrigerated the chicken for about 2.5 hours and it definitely still came out very flavorful!  Thanks for an easy great recipe!

I modified the recipe. For 10 pieces I did 3x the sauce. I mixed all the ingredients together beforehand and let the chicken sit in the sauce for several hours. I set some aside to baste with as it cooked. I used minced garlic, onion powder and white vinegar. I turned the grill to low instead of off. 35 minutes to cook to 165. It took about 5-10 to brown the outside. I will be making this again before summer is over!

Made this as is and boy! was it yummy! Definitely will do this again. The only thing that threw me was that the "marinade" was not liquid, which is what I am accustomed to. Probably because I don't have a mortar and pestle so I just used a spoon. Still was delicious.

I didn't have 8 hours to marinate the chicken, only about 45 min. but it was all still very delicious. My BBQ has only one large burner so I browned the chicken, as directed and then turned the flame to low to cook it through. Yum!

I used chicken thighs instead of legs. The bbq sauce was very good. Next time I think I might add a pinch of cayenne pepper.

Ketchup as a base for the sauce just didn't do it for me.  Cooking instructions great.

This is a really good and overall simple recipe...I did however make a few changes as I was out of some time, but I think this would be perfect as is! My changes are: I had three packs of chicken that would have gone bad it not used asap, so I tripled the recipe and hoped for the best. I started too late to marinade for the stated 9+ hours, so I made the paste, and marinaded for ~2 1/2 hours ( it turned out great, but I'm sure 9 hours gives more flavor.) Then I made the sauce, we have some heat loving people in our family and it seemed as though it might be a little too sweet, so into the sauce I added ~ 1 tea cayenne pepper, and some hot sauce. I followed the advice of some other reviewers,  and do agree that  the chicken could be browned for a lot longer than one minute. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans...Yum!

This was so delicious and tender!  I have always shied away from grilling chicken pieces on the grill because I wasn't sure how to do it, but this recipe is very thorough.   I followed the directions to a tee, and they chicken came out perfect!  There was the right amount of seasoning and sauce to let the flavor of the chicken shine.

I did add a bit of molasses to both the marinade and the basting sauce.....but otherwise followed the recipe.  I had never grilled chicken using this method before, but it's obviously the right way to do it!  The resulting chicken was not only tasty, but also moist.  Great recipe.

I made it with a good marinade before hand and let the meat get more flavor overnight then followed the recipe with my favorite BBQ sauce.

I actually prefer to cook all the sales together and marinate the chicken in it before smoking it.

This recipe is easy and delicious. First time I have ever made BBQ sauce from scratch. Was excellent, just double up on the sauce because I used 6 drum sticks and left me wanting more sauce. The rub was different, sweet with a kick but not too sweet. I would definitely make this again.

This was really good! I doubled the sauce recipe just to make sure I had enough and it ended up being more than enough. I would recommend doubling the sauce if you plan to use more than 10 pieces, but otherwise the original amount works.
