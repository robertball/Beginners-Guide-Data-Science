Hello!  I was looking for a good banana nut bread recipe to make to give as Christmas gifts along with a Yankee Banana Nut Bread candle.  This recipe is fantastic.  The bread is wonderful and is very attractive to wrap in cellophane and give in a gift bag.  I tweeked the recipe a little, at the suggestion of some other readers.  I used 1 1/2 cup of RIPE bananas.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter.  As a finishing touch, I mixed a tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of sugar and about 1/4 cup of oatmeal flakes and then sprinkled them on the top.  It is delicious and moist!

Really good, classic banana nut bread taste.  Use lots of extra banana, especially if you are generous with the nuts - they seem to cut a little of the banana-ness from the flavor (I doubled the recipe and poured the first loaf without nuts before adding them to the batter for the second loaf. The no-nut version, although the very same batter, was much more banana-ier!).  I also followed the suggestion of an earlier reviewer and sprinkled the batter with extra oatmeal before baking - what a pretty touch!  We will definitely use this recipe again.

I had some left-over banana's from Christmas and wanted to try a new recipe.  My old recipe turned out a dense, drier type of loaf that usually ended up too brown and too crumbly.  I surfed onto this recipe and gave it a shot.  WOW!  This is an awesome bread!  I love the texture as well as the taste. The addition of the oats is a big plus too.  I added a bit (1/4 tsp.) of cinnamon to my batter, and topped it with a brown sugar/oats/cinnamon struesel type of topping.  It turned out great, and I am making another loaf in the morning!  I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.  It is quick, easy, and sensational.  Thanks for the recipe and God bless!

Very good!  I lowered it a star because there were no spices.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp cloves.  I also substituted butter for the shortening.  I believe I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar too.  I used 4 brown/black bananas which were more than the 1 cup banana called for.  I added twice the nuts (a full 1 cup).  I took the suggestion of some and turned the oven down to 325*F.  I made muffins and after 23 minutes they were perfect!  I also used the topping another reviewer suggested: 1/8 cup oats, 1 tbsp brown sugar, and 1 tsp cinnamon.  They were soo pretty with the oats on top!  Thank you!

Very good banana nut bread with the added twist of oatmeal.  I think I baked it too long this time because it turned out a bit dry, but moistness actually improved as bread sat.

I thought this turned out great!  The oats give it a great texture and fullness.  I had to cook it a bit longer to get through all the way to the middle, but it was tasty when all was said and done.  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe made a great bread. The oatmeal gives a wonderful texture yet the bread is still moist. I added another 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla as well as a couple dashes of ground cinnamon for flavor. I also left out the walnuts as we were out. My only complaint is that the edges of the bread were very crusty and very hard.

I used 1/2 stick of butter, 3 large ripe bananas (maybe 1 1/2 cups?), changed the sugar to dark brown sugar and used half a cup instead, used two cups of whole wheat flower and probably 3/4 cup walnuts.  Wow!  It seemed rather healthy, and was gone as soon as it was cool enough to cut.  Now the neighborhood kids are showing up in droves to help with yard work! :)

We really enjoyed this, but I thought an entire stick of butter was too much.  I made it as written the first time, but next time will substitute applesauce for some of the butter.  I also think this would be good with at least part brown sugar.  The oatmeal is a great addition, and gives the moist bread substance.  I used three normal size bananas, and it turned out great.  Thank you!

I used butter in this recipe and I added in a couple handfuls of chocolate chips and walnuts. This will be nice to hand out for Christmas. TIP: Toss the walnuts and chocolate chips in a little bit of flour and gently stir in in at the end. Keeps them from sinking to the bottom.

Thanks for this recipe.  Very good.  I also tried it without the nuts, and using the tweaks from the other reviewers.  Good job.  I loved it.  I added the extra half cup of bannanas, and used the oat, cinnamon, sugar topping.  Yummy.

Here are my tweaks.
I used butter rather than shortening.  Butter has much more flavor, and shortening is full of bad fats.  Read the ingredient list, not good at all.

I added a 1/2 tsp more salt to bring out the flavor.

I baked the bread in a 300 F oven for 65 minutes.  This produced a very moist bread, and a deep golden crust.  I feel 350 F is too high for baking, unless it's crusty french or italian breads.  Then you want high heat.

Let the bread cool for 15 minutes before removing from pan, or it may fall apart.  Not good ;o)

Reminder: It is important to use bannanas that have speckled or brown skin.  The riper the better.  Do not place the bannanas in the fridge.  They will not be as sweet.

Regards,
Scott

Thank you all for the wonderful reviews.  This certainly is the recipe I use when I made banana nut bread.  I have substituted various ingredients as well.  I have used butter in place of the shortening, or used half butter/shortening combo.  I have used brown sugar or a half mixture of brown & white.  As for the bananas, I have found that about 3 (very ripe) bananas usually do the trick.  I also have replaced the walnuts with pecans.  I am not really sure why some posters breads are coming out dry, but I suppose it could be a variety of reason, ranging from the pans used to how you measure, etc.  I have tried some of the suggestions listed and been very pleased with the results.  I sure am glad y'all enjoy it.  Thanks again!

Recipe was perfect for me, but you should know, this is not a very SWEET banana bread.  I substitited half vanilla yogurt,for the shortening,(as one reviewer did) but that probably did not affect the sweetness much. 
I sprinkled about 1/4 cup oats to top of uncooked batter. Made it look beautiful. All-in-all, a very moist, wonderful, banana bread with a little extra chewiness, (Yum...) from the oats. Came out perfect at 50 minutes.

I made a few changes to this recipe. This called for walnuts, but I did not have any, so I added chocolate chips instead. Also added some cinnamon and drizzle or two of honey. Used 1.5 cups of mashed banana (~3 bananas). Used old fashion oats instead of quick, since that is what I had in the pantry. Topped off with a sprinkle of more oats and brown sugar. Turned out very moist, dense, and delicious!

I really liked to ease but I also added 1t cinnamon, 1/2t nutmeg, and 1/2t gr cloves. Also I increased the vanilla to 2t for my husband.  I used 3 smashed bananas.  The topping 2T oatmeal, 1T br sugar, 1/2t cinnamon was the perfect touch.  I lowered the temp to 325 and it took about 60 mins to bake.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful recipe! With 3 VERY ripe bananas on the counter I was on a mission to find  a good recipe that could use them along with other things I already had in the pantry. After looking over several recipes and reading some very helpful reviews, I decided this recipe sounded like what I was looking for. Like others,I also used a few suggestions from the reviews to make some changes.I worried the whole time it was baking that it would be dry, but much to my relief and delight it wasn't at all! I used half butter and shortening and half brown and white sugar.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I also sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar and baked it at 300 for about 1hr. and 10 min. Everyone loved it!  This is a recipe I will definitely use again.

I could tell this was going to be delicious when I cut into it; it was so fragrant.  The nose knows!

Only made small changes:
--increased bananas by 1/2 cup, because I had so many over-ripe bananas.

--added cardamom-1/4 t, cinnamon 1/2 t, and  ground mustard, pinch.

--decreased salt by 1/4 t.

This is the 3rd BB recipe I've tried here recently.  One was too dry, the other was too mushy, this one was just right.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because I followed the recipe and it turned out very dry.  However, the taste was still delicious.  I will try it again using more bananas and perhaps cutting down on the flour a bit.

Wonderful recipe, I really enjoyed the texture. Good flavor too! I used 3 bananas (about 1 1/2 cups) and otherwise kept it the same. Really tasty!

Wow! This was gooood banana bread.  I've had others before that were greasy and dark.  This one is moist, light and just plain delicious.  My husband and toddler give it two big thumbs up.  I added a little bit more oatmeal- about 1/4 of a cup and needed to bake it for an extra 20 minutes at a slightly lower temp.

Great recipe!  Of course I did some alterations.  I have always substituted shortening with applesauce. and this time instead of white sugar I used 1/2 c. honey.  I also threw in a 1/2 of cranraisins.  3/4 c. Kashi cereal.  I chopped mixed nuts instead of walnuts.  And in the end added chocolate chips.  Great bread!  I guess I added a lot of variations.  I believe the Kashi adds more protein.. Since I am trying to be healthier.. and well, my husband loves chocolate. Just thought it would be fun.  Banana bread is always a  hit our house! Thanks for the recipe!

I only gave it 4 stars because I made a few changes. Other than that, it was a 5 star recipe!! I used brown sugar for half of the sugar, whole wheat flour for half the flour and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon. I also increased the bananas a bit. I doubled the batter and made half into muffins, baking them for about 25 minutes. This is a GREAT recipe and will become my staple banana bread recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I doubled the amount of bananas and left a few bits "chunky" and it tured out wonderful!  I also put 1/3 cup chocolate chips in one of the loaves to see how that turned out....YUM!  The oatmeal really adds a great flavor and texture to this bread!

Very Yummy! I used half butter and half sour cream instead of lard, brown sugar instead of white, and a quarter cup extra of oats, nuts and banana. Next time I will only substitute half of the sugar with brown as I would like for it to be a touch sweeter. Other than that it came out moist and delicious! The healthiest recipe around for banana bread. I thank you for the recipe!!

This recipe made for very moist banana bread. I used 4 bananas, used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, and added in a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, and a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the batter. I also did as others suggested and mixed together some cinnamon, sugar, and oats and sprinkled on top before putting the batter in the oven.

Banana breads are for tweaking. There are so many versions but I like this one the best and so I made it more healthy by making the usual changes of applesauce for oil, egg whites only, half honey and brown sugar but also added spices because it's nearing Christmas. Used whole wheat flour. Bake time was an hour.

My husband ate about 1/2 this banana bread and asked for more. My granddaughter, a finicky eater, scarfed it down. Although I had only regular rolled oats, it came out just fine. I already have plans for making this again tomorrow.

EXCELLENT!  I took tips from others and made the following alterations:  replaced shortening with 1/4 cup fat free vanilla yogart & 1/4 cup margarine.  Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter; and topped with mixture of 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp sugar and not quite 1/4 cup oatmeal flakes before baking. Baked at 300 for about 1 hr 15 min (until tested done)which kept it very MOIST.

I liked this banana bread and would rate it between a 4~5. It really bakes up nicely and I chose to garnish the top with old-fashioned oats like the main picture. Its a perfect recipe for me, because it is not overly sweet or too rich tasting. I like banana bread or muffins for breakfast. The oatmeal really cut through sticky sweet taste I associate with so many quick breads. It made it a little more hearty. It is a precise mix between oatmeal quick breads and a banana one. My only change was using salted butter instead of shortening. I may even test additional healthy subs since I liked the oatmeal added. ty

I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and half shortening and half softened butter.  Minus the nuts bc my roomate has a nut allergy, but that didnt make a difference! It was still an excellent bread with fantastic taste! I did take some advice and bake this at 300° and checked it at 55 minutes. The toothpick came out clean so i hurried and yanked it out. I may have slightly overbaked it but even if i did, i couldnt tell. It was still very moist and delicious. Word of advice, if you dont have any bananas on hand or your bananas arent quite rip enough, subsitute it for pureed banana baby food! Works just the same, and save you wait of waiting for bananas to ripen..enjoy!!!!

It's very moist ... could use some ''spices'', but it's still good... will make for ''Gifts'' over the Holidays

My 9 year old daughter and I loved this. She said it is one of the best things she has ever tasted. It melts in your mouth. I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 applesauce to make a little healthier. Plus the only oatmeal I had was a package of apples & cinnamon instant oatmeal.  So put a whole package of it in. Then used pecans instead of walnuts because I had them on hand. We will add raisins next time-- daughter's suggestion.

LOVE this recipe. I use 1/4 applesauce 1/4 oil or butter (what ever I have) in place of the shortening...The kids love it and don't even know it's good for them (sometimes I will add a shredded carrot or Zuccini to add a veggie in there)

I found this to be a very heavy and dry banana bread, it was good but not quite what I was after. I did change some things though so maybe it was my additions. I added roasted almonds instead of walnuts, chopped dark chocolate, and 1 tsp cinnamon. I added the strusel top as a reviewer advised. taste was good, had to use lots of butter or jam!

This is the best banana nut bread recipe I have ever tried.  I have used this same recipe countless times and have made very few adjustments.  I recently started substituting 1/3 of the shortening with fat free vanilla yogurt, with good results.  I have also started adding flax seed along with walnuts for the health benefits.  My kids and friends rave about this bread!

This is definitely the best banana bread I've ever had! I'm eating it now for my breakfast and it's hard to believe but it tastes even better the next day : ) I used half WW and half AP flour, half brown half white sugar,2 ripe bananas, added a tablespoon of wheat germ, used roasted hazlenuts instead of walnuts and added a few dried cranberries and it's sooooooo good! I lowered my oven temperature slightly and baked it for 70 mins which was perfect. I'll never use another banana bread recipe, thank you so much for sharing such a fantastic recipe!

This made a really good moist banana bread.  I  did substitute 1/2 cup applesauce for the shortening, used whole wheat flour, and Splenda instead of the sugar.  Since I've got a convection oven I dropped the temp to about 150C (300F) and reduced the cooking time by 10 minutes.  I'll make it again, but next time I think I'll make it in muffin form!

I am so shocked at how delicious this bread came out! I followed some recommendations to make it a little healthier and was afraid it would make it not so good. It was between this bread and another 'unhealthy' recipe on this site and I picked this one b/c of the oats.I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose. I used LIGHT Smart Balance instead of shortening. I used brown sugar instead of white (I was out of white). I used 3 large very ripe (almost black) bananas. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 Tbsp wheat germ. I also only had pecans. I made the recommended oats/brown sugar/cinnamon topping and sprinkled it before going into the oven (at 300 for 70 min). This made it pretty, good and different, but don't feel it was necessary for this to be good. This bread is SOOO moist, SOO flavorful and a great texture for banana bread-not too cake-y not too dense. This will be my basic banana bread recipe from now on. Pretty healthy and delicious...what a great combo!

I just made this tonight and it is wonderful.  I did use half white and half brown sugar and sprinkled walnuts, cinnamon, and sugar on the top.  I also used closer to 1 1/2 c. bananas.  I made four mini loaves and they turned out great.  Try this recipe!!

My husband and daughter LOVE this.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 1/2 cups of banana for each loaf.  I substituted chocolate mini-chips for the nuts since my family does not like nuts in their banana bread (although I do :-)).

Amazing!  I followed lots of the suggestions from other reviewers: 1/4 c. butter & 1/4 c. fat-free vanilla yogurt in place of the shortening (I'm not one to substitute for fats usually, but I definitely don't miss the extra butter!), half and half brown sugar and white, added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, extra oatmeal and cinnamon/sugar on top of the loaf, and baked at 325 for an hour.  I also used a combination of flours - 1/4 c. rye (trying to use it up!), 3/4 whole wheat, and 1/2 c. white.  I think the wheat flour goes well with the nuts.  Did half walnuts and half pecans and probably put in a little more than 1/2 c.  The bread is dense, moist, and the coating on the top is excellent.  Thank you for the recipe and for all the helpful reviews!

Delicious!  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, Splenda baking blend (1/2 white sugar blend and 1/2 brown sugar blend), egg substitute, and Smart Balance margarine and added some walnuts and it turned out wonderfully - great texture, great flavor.  I did bake at 300 for about 70 minutes like others suggested.  Moist, tasty, and reduced calories and fat!

This is an absolutely awesome banana bread recipe.  My kids and husband would have eaten it all in one sitting, had I not stopped them. I doubled the recipe and used 5 large bananas.  I then used half of the batter to make a loaf of bread while using the other half to make muffins so I could freeze them individually to have one each morning for breakfast.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I turned the temp down to 325 after reading some of the other messages about the temp being too high.  It worked out wonderfully. I would recommend this to anyone.

I have tried several banana bread recipes and after making this recipe today, I was thoroughly impressed with the flavor and texture of the bread.  I used margarine instead of shortening and added a little flax seed, oat bran, and wheat flour (total for all three =1/2 cup which I subtracted 1/2 cup from all-purpose flour)for additional nutritional benefit. I use my husband as my food critic and he rated this a "10" on a scale of 1-10.  Also asked for seconds.

This recipe provided a great base to work from!  I made a few changes though: Instead of shortening, I used .5c apple puree based shortening and oil substitute, and because that is sweet, I cut sugar down to only .5c and I used lt.brown sugar.  I added 1 tsp ground cinnamon as well as .5c cinnamon chips.  3 large ripe bananas gave me just a bit over 1.5c of mashed bananas, which I increased from the called for amount of only 1c.  A last minute substitute of pecans instead of walnuts didn't seem to affect my husband's opinion of this banana bread.  The oatmeal gave this recipe a wonderful texture and flavor.  I also read about the oatmeal topping and that was absolutely delicious!  I used about 1/8 c quick oats mixed with 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar and .5tsp cinnamon; that made enough to cover the entire loaf.  I baked it for 60min at 325F.  Absolutely will be making this again... and soon, apparently, since I just made it 3 hours ago and there are only two slices left!  My husband enjoyed one slice [plain] and two slices with melted butter... best enjoyed when the bread is still warm from the oven!  My children [often picky eaters] just LOVE this bread too!  Guess I better get more bananas!

Love the recipe - made a few changes just to enhance the healthy-ness.  Whole wheat flour and unsalted butter instead of shortening, also added cinnamon. Came out fantastic - did like others did and sprinkled top with oats, brown sugar and nutmeg. As you can see- my husband loved it - went upstairs for a few mins to let it cool so I could get a pretty pic, and came down to this....

I substituted shortening with butter. It came out amazing. It's so moist. Perfect texture. Perfect taste. Not to sweet, not to bitter. I was craving banana bread, and this recipe did not disappoint. It's amazing. Every other recipe I've tried was awful in its own way. My search for the perfect recipe is finally over.

Very nice, moist banana bread with appealing texture.  I took liberties with the recipe by adding extra banana and a dash of cinnamon and left out the nuts (due to allergy). Can't wait to have a piece toasted with butter….

My favorite banana nut bread ever, especially with my tweaks :D I always make 4 mini loaves, I use 1 or 2 bananas and then complete the cup with cinnamon applesauce, use about 1/3 cup whole wheat flour and complete the 1 1/2 cup with all-purpose, use pecans (and a little extra), and sprinkle oats on top before cooking. (: It's sooooo good!

One of the best recipes. Made large muffins with this and baked it for about 35 minutes. Bananas were very ripe. Added about  1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp almond extract, omitted walnuts ( for PawPaw!).  Personal preferences- I believe that without these small changes, it is still one of the best recipes. all of the ingredients were already in my kitchen

Basic recipe is quite good. I made the following changes: I used organic solidified coconut oil instead of shortening. I used C&H sugar/stevia blend instead of real sugar. I used half stoneground whole wheat pastry flour with regular unbleached flour. I used old fashioned oats. I also added 1/3 cup sweetened coconut. The coconut added a wonderful flavor.  And 1 tsp. of Saigon Cinnamon. Also, I use organic ingredients whenever possible. 
This banana bread turned out great! It is truly THE best banana bread I have ever made. I have been baking over 40 years for friends and family so I am pleased with the results. I believe the changes I made to the recipe made it better. 
A note: I have made pie crust with the coconut oil and it is fantastic. Try it!

Delicious!!! I used regular old fashioned oats, which I loved the texture it gave the bread. Added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and for the sugar did 1/2 cup granulated and 1/4 of brown sugar and the bread was perfect. This is my go to banana bread recipe from now on. Happy Baking Everyone. BTW My loaf was ready at the 45 min mark.

This bread was good. I liked it because it didn't sink in the middle like the rest of the recipes I've tried did. I used half whole wheat flour. It was good but not as moist as I would have preferred, but still, very good. I like the added oats to this recipe.

Delicious! Moist and just perfect! I didn't have shortening, so I used 1/2 cup margarine and cut the salt back to 1/4 teaspoon.  And instead of walnuts I used chocolate chips. Soooo good! I will be making this again & again.

Use this same recipe to make muffins.  Grease muffin pan, fill cup 1/2 full, and bake for 18-20 minutes!  Best oatmeal banana nut muffin recipe I've used in decades.

This bread was okay.  It needed about 1/4 tsp more salt as oats are pretty bland and tend to bland out the flavor of baked goods.  I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and could have used more of that as well.  Needs more moisture too, I'd add a couple tbsps of buttermilk next time.  The loaf rose well and had a nice dome

so.... it's in the oven right now... 55min seems like too long a wait, but I really enjoyed making this bread from scratch, especially mashing up the bananas!! I hate having to throw away over ripened bananas and this seemed like the perfect solution! I'll keep you posted on the results!!.... mmmmm...can"t get enough of this yummy bread!!

This is a keeper for me--one of the best banana bread recipes I have tried.  I swapped in a 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, threw in a small palmful of flaxseed, and also sprinkled some oatmeal, cinnamon, and sugar on the top before baking.  Great recipe!

What a delicious  bread recipe!  I love banana’s and  have them on hand all the time.  What a great way to use up those that are  ready to be discarded because everyone thinks their to ripe!  Great breakfast bread served with whipped butter. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Swish.  Sent to my recipe box!

Very good.  Baked it in a glass 9x5 pan at 325 for 70 minutes.  Except for using pecans instead of walnuts and changing the baking time & temp, I followed the recipe.  Great as a breakfast bread.  Might try brown sugar in it next time just to try it.

Very nice banana bread - I doubled the recipe to make two loaves and followed recipe exactly except probably used a bit more banana, about 4 large ones.  Nice flavor, moist with a slightly crisp crust.   This is probably one of my favorite banana bread recipes!

Absolutely DELICIOUS! Instead of using plain quick oats, I used two packages of instant oatmeal cinnamon and spice flavor...as well as a cranberry, orange, golden raisin, pecan and walnut blend of nuts that I had on hand. Finally I did add 1 1/2 cups of mashed bananas...and the outcome was stupendous! This is the best bread I have ever tasted since my Grammie's years ago. I might also add...instead of being dry this bread is super moist and again, utterly delicious!

Best banana bread ever. I used applesauce instead of shortening, half cup brown sugar and half cup white sugar, added cinnamon and used whole wheat flower. I also used 4 bananas, added raisins, and put that oat and sugar mixture on top. This turned out fabulous! I baked it for about 90 minutes at 325. I wasn't sure if it was done in the middle, but after it cooled down I was able to check and and it was so moist and perfect. I will definitely be making this again.

WOW!  I love to bake...I mad a few adjustments though... I've made lots of different kinds of banana bread and this is BY FAR the best.  I used 1 and 1/2 cups of bananas instead of just 1 cup.  I also used brown sugar instead of white and whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg....  :) Fantastic!

Loved it!! I also made changes/additions as others. Used butter, not shortenening. Doubled recipe, added 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce and then streusel topping(oatmeal,brown sugar, cinnamon).  With half the batter I made mini muffin-bake 10 minutes turned out great too.

Hands down the best banana bread you'll ever eat! Chewy, flavorful and the banana flavor isn't overpowering. I substituted the shortening with 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C applesauce (I always do), but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for sharing.

Fabulous!!  i did make  few minor substitutions including...i doubled the recipe and only used 2 cups white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I used 1/2 cup softened butter, and 1/2 cup lowfat vanilla yogurt instead of shortening.  I also added 4 tsp ground flaxseed with the oatmeal and 1 cup chocolate chips, since I'm not a fan of nuts.  lastly I topped each loaf with a little crumb topping for aesthetics.  This came out great!!  Everyone liked it from toddler to dad, and the health nut in our family was psyched to be able to eat it!

Best ever!  This bread had great texture and excellent flavor.  I used 1 1/2 cups of banana, butter-flavored shortening, and a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.  I mixed it in my Kitchen Aid, but whisked in each egg by hand to make it fluffy.  Much better flavor than other banana bread recipes I've tried.

I have tried a few other recipes, but really, this one, is exceptional.  simply the best.  The changes I made are: half butter, half ricotta cheese.  Used only brown sugar, and only half quantity.   The bread did not last long in the family, i will make it again very soon

I made this just as it says and I was only slightly disappointed.
It was a little more dry than I expected, and the banana flavor didnt stick out to me.
So I would suggest a bit more banana.
Maybe like a a cup and a half.
(3 large bananas vs. 2)

Very good bread just to munch on during the day. Definately reccomend using an electric beater for the shortening and sugar. I almost killed my forearms trying to mix everything together. At least the bread was well worth it =)

This was so yummy! I made a few changes. I actually baked mine in a square cake pan (8x8 I think) because my loaf pans were being used to make banana bread. I omitted the walnuts and added 1/2 c. of dried cranberries instead. I also added some orange zest and a tbsp or 2 of fresh squeezed orange juice. It made the most delicious cranberry, orange oatmeal banana cake. I'll make this again & again.

This banana was pretty good.............the kids loved it. The flavor and texture was pretty good!
I have had other banana breads with a slightly better flavor and feel but the great thing about this bread was that it took no time at all to make. And it's nice to have the recipe ready for those guest that call and are on their way in an hour. Really pleased....will use again! Thanx!

Changes: I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon,1/2 tsp nutmeg. I overcooked it because I waited until knife came out clean. Next time cover with tin foil half way maybe to keep edges from burning and take out before knife comes out clean. Maybe add ground cloves for a kick next time

Just made this. Here are my changes. I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of shortening, I used Bob's Red Mill Quick Cooking Steel Cut Oats, I added 2 tbls of Nutiva's shelled hempseed,  and 2 tbls of Bob's Red Mill Chia Seed to make this super healthy.  (All at our Costco).  I also used all dark brown sugar. We do not like super sweet breads. My bread came out moist and delicious.  I will probably add ground flaxseed next time.

I made this today.  I substitute almond meal for half the flour (3/4 cup for 3/4 cup flour).  It is so yummy!!!  I added it after the eggs and beat it well so it added fluffiness as that's what I've learned about almond flour whereas to much beating of wheat flour will toughen your baked goods.  This will be my new favorite recipe for banana bread.  So much healthier with the almond meal and the oats.

great recipe  I have found it to be dry though.  I soak my oats in water while mixing the other ingredients and add up to a cup of water if batter looks too dry.  Comes out great every time and gets devoured by the entire family. I also cut sugar to half a cup.  I make 3 loaves at time and it disappears like lightning.  Evendors my Co workers love it.

This is very good moist bread. I like the added fiber from the oats, but they do not change the wonderful flavor. For an even healthier bread, substitute applesauce for 1/2 of the shortening.

Good banana bread recipe.  I only had about a 1/4 cup of walnuts, and substituted dried cranberries for the other 1/4 cup.

I thought this a good receipe. I did make changes like others have. Instead of shortening I used butter, I used about 1/2 c. sugar. I wanted to use brown sugar but didn't have any. Also used all the bananas I had which were about 5 small which came to about 1 3/4 cups, added cloves, nutmeg, pecans, and 1/4 c. wheat bran flakes. Baked it at 325 for about 65 minutes. Delicious, I want to try it again using more bran and/or wheat flour. My husband liked it so when it passes him it must be good. Thanks for sharing!

I made this bread and added dried sweet dark cherries at the end - it was yummy and did not last long my household...   I bake everything on convection and didn't have any trouble with hard/crisp edges.

Preferred it as muffins, less bake time & more even baking.  Tripled the recipe & got 2 loaves & 18 muffins.  Some baked too long & there was less flavor than in those only baked to a slight golden brown.  Took me more in prep time than cook time.  Didn't find mine to burst with flavor, but does taste guilt-free!

I didn't have any nuts (for once) and I was hoarding my chocolate chips so I subbed in chopped dates. They're a little drier than I usually take my quickbreads, but it has a really nice crunchy crust which is tough to get and tasty.

This was so moist. I used butter instead of shortening and 3 very ripe medium bananas. This has a nice flavor. When it's cooled, it holds together so nice to make slicing easy.

Delicious!  My shortening wasn't creaming with the sugar very smoothly, so I added two tbs softened butter to help it along, plus a tiny bit of cinnamon, and did not add nuts (I love them, others in the house don't.)  Also, I only had 2 bananas, so to up the banana-flavor ante, I used bananas and cream oatmeal packets.  Whenever I make banana bread, I sprinkle the top of the batter in the pan with brown sugar so it makes a hard caramelized crust.  Turned out great!

I made this for my husband. I actually followed the recipe for a change w/o any significant changes. I used 1/2 shortening & 1/2 butter and an unknown number of bananas (mine were pieces left over from my son that I'd frozen). I also added a pinch of cinnamon. The bread was nicely moist and my son & husband liked it. My parents enjoyed it as well.

Mmmm! This is a great recipe! The only thing I changed was I added a couple Tbsps of honey, and subbed 1/4 of the sugar for brown sugar. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg and used one additional banana. This is such a nice moist loaf! It rose very high as well.   I used porridge oats which have a few different varieties of oats, as well as flax in it, and I did as some of the previous people mentioned and sprinkled some of the oats on top! Mmmm!  Will definitely make this again.

This is pretty good stuff.  I added pecans instead of walnuts.  Put in 4 big bananas, some Chinese 5 spice, a few tablespoons of applesauce, and raisins.  It's already half gone.

I did exactly as the recipe called for but I changed regular shortening for butter flavored shortening and it turned out more than perfect. It was very moist with just a hint of crispy around the edges. I baked mine in a silicone pan maybe thats why. I had no problem with it being dry at all. I will make this recipe from now on but next time I will add the oatmeal/cinnamon topping as suggested! TYVM!!!!!!

This is the best recipe for banana bread that I have ever tasted.  I made a double batch - one loaf of bread and 12 muffins.  I exchanged pecans for the walnuts (like those better!) and made a cinnamon/oatmeal/brown sugar topping for the bread and muffins.  This is the only banana bread recipe you'll ever need.  Excellent!

This bread was a tasty as my usual banana bread, but much healthier.  I would definately add spices next time, vanilla and cinnamon. People that tried it said that you could really taste the banana.  Also I put 2 tablespoons of wheat germ in it which was good.

Delicious!   Very moist and tasty.  Made another and substituted with Splenda, came out just as good!  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This bread is great.  I used chocolate chips instead of the nuts because my kids don't like nuts.  My husband couldn't get enough of this bread and he doesn't usually like banana bread.  I liked it better after I wrapped it in foil over night so the edges would soften after baking.  It is very moist and delicious!

Best banana bread ever!  Try this:  cut a thick slice, dip it egg and make French toast with it.  In a skillet, melt some butter with brown sugar and a touch of cinnamon.  Add a sliced banana, heat through, and top the French toast.  Yummmm!

So yummy!  I've made this twice now and I think I finally have it perfect.  The first time I baked at 325 for 60 min and it cam out a bit dry - second time did 300 and it came out perfect.  Also made a few other changes: used 1/2 cup margarine instead of shortening, used lt brown sugar instead of white, and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon as well as 1/2 c. chocolate chips.  Also added the oatmeal/cinnamon/sugar topping suggested in another review and that added the perfect touch.  This is a recipie I'll be using for a long long time - thanks!

This was delicious.  I also added 1/2 c. of dried cranberries (craisins). I substituted an equal amount of butter for shortening (which I refuse to use - YUCK), which MAY be the reason this bread crumbles so easily(?).  Nonetheless, I’ll make it again, but with fresh blueberries or raspberries next time.

What a wonderfully simple recipe.

I used butter instead of shortening because, well, let's face it, life is better with butter (and bacon). 

I also added some cinnamon to the flour. delicious and aromatic addition!

really filling. great to go with a banana and my AM coffee on the go!

Next time I’d use just one pan and not two, but this bread is beautiful! Especially if you sprinkle some oats and nuts on top, prior to baking.

This was delicious. I made a few changes I used 1/4 cup dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of all white sugar. Also used butter instead of shortening and added cinnamon. Very moist and made my house smell wonderful. Also used gluten free flour as I am allergic to gluten and it turned up perfect! Will make this again and again!

I am sure the recipe would be great as is, but I added a little more banana than called for, I substituted pecans for walnuts,  and I used slow cooking oats (old fashioned/large flake).  Plus I mixed a handful of oats with a rounded tablespoon of brown sugar for a topping.  It turned out perfect - hubby, all six kids, and I loved it :)

This was fantastic! Need need to screw around with this recipe. Follow it verbatim and you wont be disappointment. I know everyone loves to tweak recipes so that they can call it their own, but leave this one the way it is. You won't regret it.

Easy recipe to follow....and I like that it doesn't call for cups and cups of sugar....I did add some cinnamon to the batter and make a streusel like topping to put on top before baking but otherwise I followed the recipe completely....it is moist and delicious.....

So addicting.  Took the advice of another reviewer and added nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves.  Used combined brown and regular sugar of about 1/2-3/4 full and more bananas.  Oatmeal, brown sugar and cinnamon for the topping.  Fabulous.  We couldn't stop eating this.  Ate it with honey butter but just as good without it, really.  I may buy bananas and let them go bad for this recipe alone.

Loved this recipe! I used old fashioned instead of quick cooking oats for a more rustic texture, and substituted Craisins for the nuts. Great taste and will be even better to share :)

My bread came out very moist and full of banana flavor!  I didn't have walnuts, so I used pecans instead. I prefer them over walnuts. I did use a little extra banana,but only because I had it.  I'll make this again.

Easy and delicious. Did sub shortening with 1/2 cup applesauce, white sugar with light brown sugar, vanilla with maple extract, 1 cup whole wheat flour  + 1/2 cup white flour, and used total 4 medium bananas.  Came out perfectly, moist and full of banana flavor. A keeper!

Best homemade Banana Bread.  I did add the topping suggested by another review.  This is definately a keeper.  I told my husband it taste like "coffee house banana bread".  I doubles the recipe and used 5 bananas and made 2 loaves.  I've tested so many banana bread recipes and this is the one I will keep.

wonderful. I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts. This bread was so good I wish I had made more. I used three bananas which was just over the amount asked for...  I think lowering the temp and cooking longer worked out thanks for that suggestion!  this recipe was so easy for me.

I've made this tonight for breakfast in the morning and I doubled the recipe to make two loaves. I did change the recipe a little to include some of the others suggestions. I added 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, double the vanilla, oil instead of shortening, and 7 large bananas. I also made a streusel to go on top. It was dense but very good and not to sweet.

This recipe is definitely a keeper for me! Hands down, one of the best loaves I've ever made - and it turned out great the very first try, even with the small adjustments I made. My dad even remarked that it was one of the best, and he's had a tremendous amount of bread-tasting experience  over the years as I've tried new banana bread recipes, hoping to find or create the perfect one. I did use 3 bananas that were the equivalent of 1 1/2 cups of banana. I also used only brown sugar and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I baked at 325 degrees and started checking it at 50 minutes, but 60 minutes ended up being the final baking time. I am baking in high altitude, but didn't make any adjustment for it other than using less sugar - and I just prefer my bread not to be as sweet as a lot of recipes call for. Great texture with the oats, we loved how chewy and dense it is...and still  moist...as my mom said. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Really delicious recipe. The only thing I changed was an extra banana, because I love bananas and a 1/2 cup mixture of cranberries and raisins.
Very good recipe

Very tasty...not too sweet like many other recipes...the texture is more like bread than cake, if you are looking for something very moist, this is not the recipe for you...

I didn't have vanilla extract, and it still turned out okay. I used about 1 and 1/3 cups of smashed banana to counter the 1/2 cup of nuts. Worked out nicely.

Absolutely delicious! I made with 1 cup of all purpose and 1/2 cup wheat flour. Also replaced some of the sugar with brown sugar.....mmmmm :) I loved the oats added in. I doubled them and skipped the nuts to accomidate my budget. I will definitely make it again! Thanks so much for sharing!

used butter instead of shorting, added 1/2 teaspoon of cinamon, 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, used 5 medium bananas so a bit more than the recipe called for. substituted whole grain wheat flour and brown sugar in stead of white.  added 1/3 cup of golden raisins and used one whole egg and one egg white.  cooked it in two loaf pans for 40 minutes @ 350, came out great and a bit healthier for you.  Didn't rise as much as I would have liked but the flavor made up for it. maybe next time I'll play with the baking soda/powder ratio.

This turned out great!  I used real butter and the flavor seemed to intensify the banana flavor.  I also added cinnamon.  I like the texture the oatmeal gave the loaf of bread.  Excellent recipe!

Very flavorful and moist! I doubled the recipe easily, and used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking. Also added cinnamon and cloves to the dry ingredients. Will keep this as my "go to" recipe. We love it!

A great recipe - easy to make and very tasty. I followed the recipe as directed, except I used pecans for walnuts. Took to a pot luck at work, and the slices were gone in no time. I liked the texture from adding the oatmeal.

This is a quick and easy recipe, and it's delicious. I make it for my parents, and my Mom doesn't want the nuts in her bread so I changed to her favorite nuts - pecans - but mix them with a little cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle on top instead of putting inside.  I also add a little cinnamon to the batter for added zip.

Delicious!!  I leave out the nuts because we are allergic, but it still has an excellent flavor and texture.  I did add the oatmeal crumb topping as another reviewer suggested, but will not do that again, just not necessary and detracted from the finished product.

Well i liked this one. I changed it a bit though. I changed the shortening to butter, sugar to sweetener and i added mixed nuts and raisins. I did not crush the nuts. they were OK  as is almonds were whole. I had more than the recommended amount of bananas but i put them in any way it made a bit more with no obvious problems that i could see. lol

This recipe was ok, I added spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves but it was still on the bland side for my taste.  I do like the addition of the oatmeal.  I made muffins instead of a loafand 18 mins. on 350 left them a bit dried out.  I'll try again at a lower temperature.

I made it for my colleagues so I didn't get to try it, but I received rave reviews such as - "I couldn't stop eating it and ate half of it last night!" I baked at 300C for 1hr as suggested by many people. It was perfect! I'm definitely going to have to make some for myself next time!

This banana nut bread is the best! Not too sweet and it's full of banana flavor. Be sure to use ripe bananas .I had to cook it longer than stated but I just kept checking it with a toothpick until it came out dry.

This was great! I also followed some of the tips provided by other members, such as using brown sugar instead of white and baking at 300. I also added 1 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries, and it turned out wonderful. This didn't last long, so next time I will double the recipe so everyone can have a slice.

this recipe makes a pretty nice bread. in effort to be more healthful, i substituted 1 cup of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. i also used old fashioned oats, pulsing them 3 times with my food processor. pecans worked well in this bread too. thank you kelly!

My family and I thought this bread was delicious.  I'm fairly new to baking, but this recipe came out great the first time.  I have already made 3 loaves!  I add another half cup of banana to give it extra flavor.  Good stuff!

I added two more bananas and used a quick oatmeal packet of apples and cinnamon instead of the plain quick oatmeal. Turned out very good and moist. 

Next time I will add another one or two bananas for more flavor.

I've actually made this a few times now for myself and coworkers. The changes I made and finally settled on were the following based on my preferences:
Change Shortening to Organic Applesauce
Change White Sugar to Organic Brown Sugar
Change Walnuts to Pecans
Then I bake both together  for 1H 30M. I loved the original, just wanted it more organic. Either one is delicious!!!

I have made this about 5 times already and I love it! I love the fact that it has healthy oat in it. I also like to add some chocolate chips to it when I'm making it for my 5 yr old daughter. I like making it in mini loaf pans too.

This is the best banana bread ever, I made it just like the recipe is printed. I’m going to try making muffins with this recipe. My husband likes a muffin to take on his way to play golf.

This is my second time making this banana oatmeal nut bread!! My effort came out perfect!! I doubled the recipe and gave one as a thank you gift! This time we will eat one and freeze one! The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly! This time I used applesauce in place of the shortening, since it’s a little healthier! I just put it in the oven so have not tasted it yet but I will update my review when it’s ready!! This has become my go to recipe!

Great on flavor, but very very dry.  Also the batter was very bland so I added nutmeg and ginger to it before baking.

Wow! So moist and delicious! I followed other reviewers advice and added applesauce. My mistake was i didn't substitute it, i just added it along with the butter, so it took FOREVER to finish cooking but the end result was great!! :)

the only thing i changed was using butter instead of shortening.  it came out very dense and oddly dry and oily at the same time.  it was the perfect amount of batter for a large loaf pan

Horrible, I can see now why so many people change things about the recipe.  I made it as is and it was the worst bread I've ever had in my life.  It was heavy and bland, there was no flavour whatsoever. I'll never make this again nor will I recommend it to anyone.

My husband said that this is way better than regular banana bread! After I started I realized that I didn't have any plain old oatmeal, so I used flavored instant oatmeal, I picked cinnamon roll flavor. It took longer to bake than the recipe said- about and hour and 5 minutes. I'll definitely make this again and I might even use flavored oatmeal on purpose.

Everyone loved it!!! I added two Tablespoons butter so it would not be dry...after reading other reviews.  It also had to cook longer than 55 minutes to get the center 'done'...but it turned out wonderful!!!

Very good.  I only got to try a small sliver as I made it for a bake sale we're having this week, but what I had was good.  I eliminated the nuts and sprinkled oats on top of the bread for visual appeal.  I'm tough to please with banana bread bc I always use my mom's recipe--couldn't this time bc I only had 2 bananas.  Worked out very well.  thanks for the recipe!

Aww, sorry but I followed this recipe to a "T", and was extremely dissapointed mostly with the fact that it's not sweet enough.  Also, the texture was weird.

This bread never lasts long in the house and is very easy to prepare.  It's moist and tasty.

I subbed margarine for the shortening. I made 2 loaves and pressed blueberries into one. I thought it was a little flavorless, even with the blueberries and extra sugar sprinkled on it. However, I like that it has oatmeal in to, and I will make again, but I will add vanilla or extra spices for flavor.

Substituted mini chocolate chips instead of walnuts & whole wheat flour for half the all-purpose flour. Delicious!

Excellent! My daughter is allergic to wheat flour so I substituted the grain mix she can have and she (and the rest of the family) loved it! I added an assortment of nuts, not just walnuts, very good.

I followed others' suggestions to bake this at 300 instead of 350... worked out great.  The only problem I had was that I made a bit too much batter, so the sides started to get overdone but the very top was still a bit too raw.  Next time I'll just make sure I don't fill the loaf pan so full.  But overall it turned out great and my fiance loved it.  Will definitely make again!

I tired this recipe and we loved it, not only was it tasty and I also baked it on my BBQ since I didn't want to heat up the kitchen, just cut the time by 20 min and lower temp slightly. I'm doubling and giving it away to new neighbors. Thanks

This was really good, just one complaint: it was too dry.  I baked it for 50 mins.  My kids love it, so it will get eaten, but I think next time, I will bake it at 300 instead of 350.

very easy, i used 3 bannanas because thats how many over ripe i had. i also used a citrius blend, flori di sicilia, instead of vanilla. i used pecans and baked two smaller loafs at 300 for 55 min. it was sweet enough for me and my family, with butter, devion cream or clotted cream its fab.

Why did my bread come out dry? It was very good, but I wished it was more moist. I think it was because of the added oats at the end..I will make this again minus the oates.

Great banana bread.  I added three extra tablespoons of sugar because i like a sweeter bread and also 1 and 1/2 cups of banana like some of the other suggested.  Oh and also 1/2 a tsp of cinnamon.  Yummy.  Thank you Kelly!!!

As recommended, I lowered the baking temperature to 300 degrees and added the cinnamon, sugar, and oatmeal topping. It came out very moist and delicious. I'll be using this recipe from now on!

The oatmeal added a different "twist" to this recipe and I liked the flavor.  Seemed a little dry, however.

Very good banana bread...not as good as my mom's recipe, but still good. I added cinnamon as suggested by others and this added good flavor.  Very easy to make.
