Had a friend over for lunch today and served this.  "WOW," is what we said.  This simple little carrot salad is loaded with flavor, and on top of that, it's so darn easy AND healthy for you (41 calories, 1.2g fat & 7.2g carbs).  Admittedly, you have to like cilantro (we do), but this was such a pleasant surprise.  I've not eaten much Indian food, but bring it on!

An easy yet great recipe that cannot go wrong. I was in a hurry and added the ingredients without following the exact proportions and still it turned out awesome!

This recipe is a winner.  Made it as written first time, and found it a touch salty, so I cut back on that the next time. Today I was short on cilantro, only had 1/4 cup...so I used 1/4 cup of mint also. Still a winner.  I think this is recipe that you can tweak to fit your individual taste, all the while enjoying a healthy treat.  I can't wait to use this as a sandwich topping and loved scooping it up with sweet pepper spears!

This was a hit with the folks at work, including my coworkers from India.  I used the half teaspoon of salt, but balanced it out with unsalted peanuts.

If you let this sit in the fridge overnight, the flavor gets "weird". It was alright the first night though.

Phenomenal! I saw this recipe on Allrecipes.com and knew I had to try it, & I'm so glad I did. I could eat it everyday with a sandwich for lunch.

I've made this several times & I find this is just a perfect Indian side salad.  Simple, cool & crunchy with a wonderful balance of flavors.
