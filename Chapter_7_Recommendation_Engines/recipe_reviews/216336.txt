These are a very enjoyable, easy little cookie to make.  My daughter was dubious, but we both thought they were great!  Oh, and since I make my 'brown sugar' by adding molasses to dehydrated cane juice sugar, I simply added a little more to replace the golden syrup.  That worked fine.  Thanks so much for sharing, this one is a keeper.

Yum - so easy and loved by everyone. So popular and easy that at my daughters' school it has been adopted as THE cookie recipe by the home ec department.
These cookies were developed to send to Australian and New Zealand troops during WW!, so you can be sure they keep extra well.
The ginger is not a traditional ingredient, though, andI leave it out.
If you have trouble finding golden syrup, try a British food store or substitute maple syrup.

Hi,
I tried to make those cookies, and followed the recipe... but they ended up not holding together, really dry. It was like some kind of granola mix.

Thank you, Aussie Gal! If anyone finds the mixture does not stick together, add a teaspoon of water and problem solved! This is the recipe I have been looking for.

These were great! Love the texture, and the flavour was a nice change from our usual. I didn't have baking soda, so substituted 4.5 tsp of baking powder which needed a little extra boiling water to dissolve; I also used corn syrup as a sub for the golden syrup. I drizzled a touch of maple syrup on the dough after it was all mixed, for a little sweetness and extra stickiness. I might cut the ginger in half if I made them again, but my husband liked the recipe as I made it! We like our cookies on the flat and crunchy side so I pressed the dough balls down good before baking, and they came out nice and brown in ~10 minutes (a little less, because my oven runs hot).

I added an egg to the mixture because, like another reviewer mentioned, it was like granola. Even with the egg they barely held together but I figured that the baking process would take care of it. Other than this difficulty the cookies turned out nice. Could have used more ginger but that's just my preference.

These taste delicious, but came out very flat and greasy.  I followed the directions exactly but may try them again with less butter.
