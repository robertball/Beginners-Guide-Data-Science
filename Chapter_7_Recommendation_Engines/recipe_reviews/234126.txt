I added Summer Squash and Baby Swiss Cheese as well as Havarti. I love cheese.  I liked it better after a reheat with added celery salt and Hatch chilli/pepper sauce. 
I usually don't use measurements of ingredients, I go with what my tastebuds like. Darn good recipe on its own.

Followed the recipe, and even added extra pepper, but it tastes pretty bland. It needs something to zip it up, but I’m not sure what. I’d use a bit less cilantro next time as well; it tastes a bit too prominent.

Delicious soup, very creamy and very cheesy. I used green bell peppers instead of red. Thank you for the recipe.
