Nice blend of flavors!  My husband liked it better when he added more black pepper to his serving.  I will make it again!

Really delicious! What a great idea to use eggplant that I would never have thought of. Really nice flavors and textures in this with the warm, creamy eggplant and the sweet tomatoes and pungent onions. I ate this both warm and room temp and loved it both ways. I'm the only one in the house who will eat eggplant, but I did make my hubby try and he said it was ok (which is HUGE, lol). I will def be making this again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
