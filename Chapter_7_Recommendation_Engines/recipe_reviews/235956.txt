Who knew making mustard was so easy!?!? This mustard definitely has some ZING to it, which I loved...almost a horseradish hint to it. I scaled the recipe down to make 8 servings. I let the mixture rest for 4 hours and everything turned out great.  I served this with smoked sausages. It definitely pairs well with meats that have stronger flavors. No need to ever buy fancy mustard again! I will definitely be playing around with this recipe to add different flavors to it.
