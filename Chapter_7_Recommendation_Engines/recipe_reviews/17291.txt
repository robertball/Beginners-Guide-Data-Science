In my circle of friends it's a well known fact that I can bake anything except cookies.  So you can imagine everyones surprise when they tasted these fabulous, chocolatey, yummy cookies.  Finally, a cookie I can make without them being little crispy rocks.  Update:  I made these again today but copied the recipe down wrong and used baking powder instead of baking soda.  Found the answer to the problem of them going flat.  They came out all puffy and pretty.  Next time I'll try half baking soda/half baking powder to see if it might improve the texture while maintaining shape.

This recipe has now become a favourite.  I did make some changes, but I firmly believe this would've been an awesome cookie even without them -- so I gave it a full 5 stars.  I did as others and used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla.  I used 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 3/4 cup dark cocoa powder.  I cut the flour down to 1 1/4 cups and added a box of white chocolate instant pudding (about 1/2 cup).  I added a teensy bit of salt, 1 cup white chips, a little over 1 cup semi-sweet chips, 1 1/4 cups coconut, 1/4 cup chopped glazed pecans, 3/4 cup chopped walnuts.  I cooked them for 9 minutes, which was perfect for my oven.  I also rolled mine into balls so they'd be little puffed-up balls since I don't like flat cookies.  These are the ultimate craving-killing cookies.  They were amazingly soft, perfectly sweet, and very addictive.

This is the best cookie ever! I made it for a bake sale, and all he other cookies and cakes were hardly eaten by the end of the sale and these were eaten in 5 minutes (on the clock!)
I wouldn't bake them for even a second more than it says in the recipe - the cookies come out of the oven strangely soft, but they harden within a few minutes. These are just the right texture and flavour - not too chewy but not too hard, and just the right amount of sweetness. I recommend!

Excellent.  I did my usual "healthy" substitutions (half the flour and add that amount in whole wheat; half the butter and add that amount in applesauce) and they came out soft, just the way I like cookies.

Everyone who I shared these cookies with loved them!  They disappeared quite quickly.  I also added 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder as reccomended and the cookies were very chewy... just perfect!

I added a little salt and vanilla. The recipe made much more than 3 doz. Got rave reviews from family and friends but they flattened like little chocolate pancakes. I made a doz and then refrigerated the leftover dough overnight. The cold dough did not keep them from being flat. Tasted good but looked kinda funny.

Definitely a keeper.  These chewy, fudgy decadent cookies are just what a chocoholic is looking for.  I took them out of the oven at 8 minutes even though they seemed quite soft.  After they'd cooled completely they were crispy around the edges and soft and chewy on the inside.  I had rainbow coloured chips that I wanted to use up so substituted them for the white chocolate.  The white chocolate would be nicer, though, and I'll definitely use it the next time, but will substitute chopped white chocolate for the chips.  I like the way the white chocolate chunks spread a bit while the coolies are baking.  Thanks for a delicious treat.

I decided to alter the recipe and use mint chocolate chips instead of white ones. Yummy! My kids loved it. Has the flavor of Girl Scouts Thin Mints with the texture of traditional chocolate chip cookies.

These were just ok.  Very crumbly and dry.  Had good flavor but the texture was more cake like than cookie.

I made these cookies with a bag of Andes mints pieces and half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and they were amazing!!!  Instead of 2tsp baking soda I used 1tsp each of baking soda and baking powder.  Covered the dough with plastic wrap and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  (I read somewhere that it's the secret to perfect chocolate chip cookies, and I've used that tip for tons of cookie recipes with fabulous results)  Then I spoon little balls of dough and cook for 7:30-8 minutes at 350 degrees, even though they look very undercooked, and let them rest on the warm cookie sheet for 5-6 minutes, before letting them  cool completely on a rack or waxed paper.  The short cooking time is KEY to SOFT CHEWY cookies.  These cookies get hard very quickly if you overcook them.  They store very well if kept in an airtight container with a piece of sliced bread, which kept these cookies soft and delicious for the week it took them to reach my husband by mail.  Enjoy!!  They were absolutely delicious!

I love this recipe. I saw that some people were having problems with the cookies going flat so I used half baking soda half baking powder and they came out absolutely perfect. Also, if you can use 1 1/2 of cocoa if you want really rich, dark chocolate cookies. Macadamia nuts are fabulous in this recipe. Thanks!

I usually have a hard time with chocolate cookies, but these cookies are amazingly soft and chewy, just like brownies.  In my opinion the equal parts brown sugar and white sugar is what makes them so soft, and the batter looks waaaay thicker than usual cookie dough.  But they turned out perfect!  Don't change a thing!
My only substitution was that I only used 1 1/2 cups of white chocolate chips and would use less next time, but other than that I think this is a perfect cookie recipe.

Made these last night. They were crunchy, and soft in the middle. Turned out really good and very easy to whip up. The white chocolate chips, just added enough flavor. When serving them warm out of the oven, the chips are melted!! yumm

This is a wonderful cookie!  Based on previous reviews, I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp salt.  I also reduced baking soda to 1 tsp, then added 1 tsp baking powder.  Finally, I added a package of chocolate pudding mix to the dough and reduced flour to 1 1/4 C.  The cookies were perfect after baking 8 minutes.  Nice and puffy with slight cracking.  They didn't spread out at all, so you can place them close together on the baking sheet.  Wonderful...not too chewy but not hard either.  I will definitely make these again!!!

Good simple, delicious recipe!!  Went over very well with a large group of people.  I thought "Whoa, that's a lot of cocoa powder!"  But they turned out great.  I will make these again!

These cookies are just what I was looking for.  Rich and chewy and so chocolatey!  I did add 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp salt.  The dough is quite stiff, so like other reviews said, they didn't spread when baked, but that was fine cause I ended up with giant fluffy mountains of chocolate goodness!  You do have to be careful not to burn them though, cause it can happen in just a few seconds.  I'll be making these again and again!

Awesome. lots of rates either hated or loved them. Really rich, i will admit, in flavor but good. I used a bit of vanilla. I also used tub margarine instead of butter (a taboo i go against with all of my cookies). the dough is super sticky, so watch out. !!SECRET!!: if your cookies harden quickly, put them in a sealed container with 2 moist pieces of bread ripped in quarters and distributed over the top of the cookies over night. (grandma's are genius in some things)

Like others, I used 1tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder and added a little vanilla. These turned out fantastic! My cookie-picky boyfriend fell in love with them instantly! Many of my friends have requested that I make these again and I most definitely will! Also, this dough stays frozen nicely for at least 3 weeks and doesn't take too long to thaw out. Amazing recipe!

WOW!  That is the perfect cookie.  I did add 1/2 tsp salt and some macadamia nuts to the batter as well as increased the flour to 2 c. and reduced the cocoa to 1 c. and didn't have a problem with the cookies going flat, they were almost cake-like in texture. Very Addicting! Thank you.

Just made these. I thought I bought white chocolate chips but I accidently got butterscotch and they were still really good when they came out. I rolled the dough into a ball with my hand before putting it on the baking sheet and the cookies came out perfectly shaped.

These have become the only cookies I want to make! They're so soft and chocolatey...it's like the perfect cookie. I'm not a big fan of white chocolate chips, so I swapped them for mint baking chips. (You don't need very many to get the flavor) They end up tasting like soft Thin Mints. They freeze really well, too! LOVE THEM!!

Hubby said thse cookies were awesome (I'm on a diet, so he's the official taste-tester). I followed another reviewer's (PinkPenguinStar) suggestion and used dark cocoa powder plus unsweetened cocoa powder, semi-sweet mini choc chips plus white choc chips, some walnuts and added a pinch of salt and some vanilla extract. I also did half baking powder and half baking soda. These baked perfectly (if a bit lumpy from all the add-ins) at 8 minutes in my oven. They do look a bit undercooked, but let them sit on baking sheet for 5-7 miunutes before moving them to cool on a wire rack and they are perfect. I halved the recipe and still got 28 cookies using my standard size cookie scoop.

These were very good and everyone loved them!  Normally I would cook exactly as stated for the first time trying a new recipe but just to be safe I did add 1/2 a tsp of baking soda extra - just in case they didn't rise as others had stated.  But they turned out perfectly and had a wonderful flavor!

I loved these.  I used half baking soda/half baking powder.  I also added a little butter flavored shortening.  I added vanilla and salt, but next time I will leave out the salt.

These are delicious!!  I did tweak the recipe a little bit, following some suggestions, tips, and tricks.   Instead of using 2 tsp pf baking soda, I used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder and I added the 1 tsp vanilla, as well.  I did use 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 3/4 cup dark cocoa powder. Instead of 2 cups of flour, I used 1 1/4 cups and threw in a box of chocolate fudge instant pudding mix. A pinch of salt, and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chunks turned these into a chocolate lovers DREAM!!    Essentially, these turned into a brownie cookie with the chocolate chips and chunks acting as an internal icing.  I rolled them into balls then slightly pressed them down to have a semi-flat cookie...but not too puffy.  They came out perfectly chewy and not dry at all.  I about thought they would be dry since the batter was a bit crumbly but they are amazing!  I have found a keeper and will be making these several times a year.

These were SO GOOD!!!!  I did as another reviewer suggested and only used 1 1/4 cup of flour and added a box (3.3 oz) of white chocolate instant pudding (just add the dry mix, you beat it in with the wet ingredients right after the eggs.  Don't prepare the pudding!).   I used 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, and added 1 tsp vanilla.  9 minutes in my oven was perfect.   The cookies were not flat at all.   Try these changes and you'll love them!!!!

These are very yummy and rich!  I followed the advice of other reviewers who used 1t of baking powder and 1t of baking soda, and it was an excellent suggestion.  My cookies came out of the oven puffy and pretty!  They are deliciously fudgy-like.  One suggestion: After you form them a bit, press them down somewhat with the back of a spoon.  I didn't do this the first time, so my first batch didn't spread. They are still delicious, though.  Can't wait to serve them at tomorrow's Super Bowl party!

Tasted great.  I needed a chocolate cookie recipe that used cocoa powder rather than chocolate.  I added some toasted pecans and chocolate chips with the white chocolate chips. I used baking powder rather than baking soda (as recommended by another reviewer) and the cookies baked up perfectly.

This is an awesome recipe and so easy.  I also did do a little adjusting.  I added 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla. (who can make cookies with out vanilla????)  I also added 1 small package of instant chocolate pudding mix.  This so helps with the crunchy outside and chewy inside and keeps them from drying out!!! (I usually use vanilla puddng mix but thought that this called for more chocolate....other 'choc-a-holics' will agree.) I also used mint chips instead of the white chocolate chips.....turn out just like the flavor of mint chip ice cream.  Not too minty.  Just nice and subtle.

Wow- what a yummy cookie recipe!  I tweaked it a little and took someone else's suggestion to add a little vanilla and a little salt, as well as adding some instant espresso and some semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I usually like flat, gooey cookies more than cakey cookies.  I was a little nervous when I took them out of the oven, but they were nice and chewy inside.

Fabulous! Everyone who shared them with me loved them. I used white chocolate chunks, instead of chips, just by chopping up some almond bark (bark coating, it's a block of white chocolate). The recipe was easy and turned out great!

I just made these, as part of my holiday baking and they turned out really well.  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla and some christmassy sprinkles on top though.  They are very moist and really chocolatey.  I'll definitely make these again!

I think this cookie is really tasty. I did alter the recipe just a little by adding 1 tsp vanilla, and subbing 1/2 cup shortening for 1/2 cup of the butter. I went for presentation, so instead of adding the chips to the dough, I used a medium scoop to dish out exact portions of dough, and then placed the chips on top of each cookie, pressing just lightly. Sounds fussy, I know, but they looked great. The cookies had a very nice shape, not too mounded or too flat, perfectly round, and just delicious. Also, I used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets, and made sure to let them set up for 4-5 minutes on the sheet before moving the baked cookies to a cooling rack. (The one cookie I tried to move too soon just fell apart). I baked for exactly 10 min.

I have been baking these at least twice a week for the past month because of all the requests!  The only changes I made was added a 2 tsp. vanilla and 1 tbs. strong coffee.  I added the coffee not to make them coffee flavoured but rather to bring out the rich flavours of the cocoa. Simple and quick. Luv it!

These cookies are simple to make and exceptional to eat!  Knowing my oven bakes a little hot, I took them out at the low end of the cooking time which left the cookies moist and chewy inside with a nice crispy thin shell outside.  I added a half teaspoon of salt and a splash of vanilla to the original recipe and have made them since with a combination of white and dark chocolate chunks - plain old baking chocolate squares coarsely chopped.  Unbeatable!

I made these for my husband for our wedding anniversary.  He absolutely loved them.  I used three kinds of chocolate chips and they were a very big hit.  He's been hinting that I should make them again.  The dough does get rather thick so you need a little muscle to mix it.  :)

This is a fantastic recipe and the twist of colors in it really adds a lot. I made them on a Tuesday night and the next Tuesday night my 3 kids and husband were all asking for more. So we made them again!! My 5 year old daughter LOVED helping make these!

Yes they were pretty good.  Soft.  I used baking powder because it was what I had.  I chilled the dough before baking so they would be tall.  I used wheat flour and it was great.

These were so yummy!  I used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder as suggested.  Used a tbsp scoop  for each cookie and it made around 4 dozen.  They harden on the baking sheet while cooling so don't be afraid that you have taken them out too early.

Delicious! However, watch the baking time carefully as these cookies seem to be a bit too soft after the suggested baking time, so I baked them a little longer. Little did I know they become hard overtime, mine turned out too hard. They were still tasty and incredibly chocolatey though. Great companion for vanilla ice cream! Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to like these, but found them dry...we threw away the batch after eating a few. Ghiradhelli has a chocolate cookie recipe that I've had great success with if you are looking for something similar

These cookies turned out really well! I did change the recipe a bit however. After reading some reviews about the cookies being flat, I decided to add 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking soda like some other users. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and peanut butter chips instead of white chocolate chips. Overall they turned out well and tasted very good. I will be making them again. Thanks! :)

I would recommend NOT greasing your baking pan if it is already a nonstick surface. I have made these several times without fail. We really likes these a lot. Thanks for sharing!

The 1st time i made these, they didn't turn out that well. I tweaked the recipe and used only 1cup cocoa powder and added 1tsp vanilla. I also baked them for about 13-15 mins because on my oven 8-10 makes them too soft and brownie-like. They turned out delicious!

I used half of the ingredients and made 16 cookies. They turned out great taste, but too soft even after cooling down for quite awhile. Next time I think I will add more flour less butter to see if this problem could be solved.

These cookies were so good! The cookies are so rich and chocolatey!  I followed the suggestions to add 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of baking powder and only added 1 tsp of baking soda.  I also used mint chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chips and they tasted like girl guide cookies!

These cookies were pretty good but the consistency was a little weird. I did change out the white chocolate chips for butterscotch chips and I highly recommend giving that a try!

I thought they were awful.  I followed the recipe exactly, but they just didn't have a lot of flavor.  I think maybe if it had dark chocolate chips instead of white chocolate, they'd be better.

These are great cookies, but I found I had to help flatten the cookies a bit, they didnt do it all on their own. The second batch was much better because I rolled them into balls and then pressed then down just a bit before cooking. Very yummy cookies, thanks!

I think this is probably my husband's favourite cookie.  The flavour is great - very chocolatey, but it is a chewy cookie as opposed to a more crunchie cookie and it sometimes seems they are a bit greasy - they also stick together if stacked in the cookie tin.  But for this flavour, we will keep making them and suffer eating 2 at a time when they get stuck together.

Yum! These cookies were sooo good. I used 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon baking soda. Rolled them in 1 inch balls and baked like directed. They were soft, chewy, and cracked at the top. Don't forget to try one right out of the oven! Definitely a keeper!

Fantastic cookies. I used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder and OMG. I was worried about the thickness of the batter, it is quite thick, but that makes it easy to shape the cookies and they come out perfect if you like a denser, chewier consistency.

These were great. Don't forget to let them sit on the hot cookie sheet for 5 minutes (makes a HUGE difference in my opinion). Soft, chewy, not too chocolately as far as the cookie itself and I prefer them several hours later so the white chocolate has a chance to firm up again after baking. I added a little vanilla and about 1 C of walnut pieces as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe but changed some quantities and the results were delicious!
Use 3/4 C sugar
1 Cup unsweetened cocoa
Add 1 tsp baking powder
Dash of salt
1 tsp vanilla
Perfect cookies!

I took another reviewers suggestion and used 1 tsp baking soda as well as 1 tsp baking powder...the cookies didn't flatten at all (I started to press them down before putting them in the oven which helped) but they were definitely nice and fluffy.  I would probably use less cocoa powder next time, otherwise great recipe!

These cookies are great! I baked one batch for 10 minutes and thought they were just a little on the dry side. (Then again, I like my cookies chewy.) Eight minutes was perfect, and my roommates loved them.

Very tasty cookies!  I'm not even much of a chocolate lover, but I really liked these.  Make sure to add a pinch or 2 of salt and a little vanilla to make them taste better!  I also undercooked them in the over and then left them on the pan for a minute or so to let them finish out.  this kept them fluffier, since my first batch went flat when I left them in the oven longer.  They taste like brownie cookies! :)

this recipe was NOT good. The cookies came out way too chewy and hardened straight away. My granny nearly broke her tooth on the hardened cookie.

If you could taste a bit of heaven, here it is. Oh the most yummiest cookie I've ever had. For those of who say you cant get the batter right, do as I did, use your hands to mix it. Well worth it. I'm eating one right now. Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm

This was a cookie disaster! I have doublechecked my adherence to the recipe, and cannot figure out why the  batter didn't spread properly to form cookies rather than underbaked lumps. I'm an experienced baker and am flabbergasted and disappointed at this flop...especially when everyone else seems to have had much success with the recipe.

My chocoholic daughter came home from golfing and smelled these cookies as soon as she walked in. She quickly ate 2 of them and declared them as "decadent". We both think that they remind us of brownies. A little crackly on the outside and chewy inside. As with any cookie a few minutes either way could change the texture. I had to bake mine 14 min. Also,they looked like they were from a bakery. My cookies never look like that. These stayed high and fat. MMMMMMMMMMMMM

At first I thought these cookies were good.  But on the second cookie I realized they were missing something--Salt!  Since I used unsalted butter as called for, it needed a pinch of salt to enhance the flavors.  Also I thought the cookies were a little gritty.  Now, that could be my error by not creaming butter and sugars long enough.  I don't think I'll make these again though.

First time making cookies from scratch and they were amazing. I followed the recipe exactly. My husband thought the batter looked dry but I decided to just trust the recipe the first time. I can see that depending on the size of your eggs, you might need a little more wet ingredients. 

They were fluffy, chewy, and gooey. Definitely wait the 5 mins on the baking sheet before moving them to a wire rack. I thought for sure they were undercooked because the 1st tester fell apart...but wait 5 mins and then move them and they are perfect!!!

These cookies were absolutely delicious and I made them with a different ingredient instead of using cocoa powder I used nutella which made it taste better and more melted with chocolate.

I made these in my food technology class and they were so yum in the end, I did have a bit of trouble mixing it all together and by the end when I was rolling and putting it onto the baking tray there was flour in the bottom of the bowl. I recommend  a little less cocoa and more egg or butter. Funny story, I left my cooking bag at the bus stop and when I came back to get it, someone had taken the cookies!!! luckily my friends and I got to have half of the batch but the rest, who knows where it ended up :(

Fudgy  delicious, like a brownie cookie! I added 2t vanilla and 1/4t salt, plus 12 oz salted caramel chips. I used an overflowing 2 oz ice cream scoop for the batter but the cookies did not spread as they baked, so I used a butter knife to flatten subsequent batches.

Delicious! The chocolate flavor is perfect. They are very delicate cookies with a great amount of chewiness to crumble. I did use half baking powder and half baking soda. Also, baked them for 8 minutes instead of 10 and they turned out just right. Everyone loved them. Will definitely make them again!

The first time I made these exactly as written, and found them to be ok but not great. They were too dry and too cakey. The second time I made them I used baking powder instead of baking soda, and under-measured the flour. I also added a tsp of vanilla. The batter still looked too dry to me so I threw in some water a teaspoon at a time until it was a better consistency. I used 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 semi-sweet. I was worried that they wouldn't turn out after all the tinkering with the batter, but they were amazing. Fudgy and moist, with a flatter shape and more cookie-like texture. Will definitely make them again with my changes.

A lot of reviews on these cookies mention changes like adding vanilla, baking powder or salt, but my daughter makes these with our Kitchen aid mixer, just as written, with no alterations, 9 minutes in the oven and these cookies are perfect, they taste very much like a brownie, and if you like the chewier style of brownie instead of the cake-like brownie then this is your cookie!

I've been looking for the perfect chocolate cookie for a long time. This is it. I did use salted butter and added a half a teaspoon of salt to cut the sweetness. Absolutely follow cooking instructions and leave on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes after taking out of the oven. These rock!

I keep looking back to see if I messed up somewhere, but no. I expected something fairly flat and brownie-like (like what is pictured with the recipe), but these are puffy with a crusty outside, an overpowering bitter cocoa flavor, and a strange consistency - somewhere between cake-like and.. gritty? Most of the reviews I have read include changes they made to this recipe. By all means, follow them. As written, something with this recipe is not quite right.

I made this exactly as written. It is very good!  My husband is a chocolate chip cookie "connoisseur," ?? and asked me to keep this recipe to make again!!
The recipe does not call for salt or vanilla. I don't like adding salt if it's not needed, but the next batch I'll try adding vanilla to see if it adds anything to the taste. Don't get me wrong, the cookie tastes great as written!

These cookies are perfect! Plump, soft and chewy; I am delighted that they kept their shape and look as good as they taste. I followed the recipe exactly. I had a bag of white chocolate M&Ms that I tossed in with the white chocolate chips, just because we love our candy! This is my go-to cookie from now on. Thank you!

Awesome recipe. I halved the recipe and subbed half the butter for applesauce. My batter was quite stiff but tasted awesome. Mine didn't spread much. I also used 1/4 baking powder and 3/4 baking soda. I made 33 cookies using a tbs cookie scoop. I omitted chocolate chips cause i didn't have any but plan on doing so next time because these cookies are VERY rich. They needed some sweetness. Definitely making these again.

This recipe was delicious! I followed another reviewer's suggestion to add a bit of vanilla and salt. I didn't have white chocolate chips, but I needed a quick cookie recipe to bring to a reception after my music camp's performance, so I used peanut butter and chocolate chips. They were absolutely phenomenal! Definitely a keeper recipe.

For everyone who said they didn't "puff up", add 1/2 teaspoon of salt. These cookies are perfect. Chewy, chocolaty, decadent little morsels. Do NOT cook them for longer than 8 minutes. I also did not grease the cookie sheets. Those were the only changes I made. Magnificent!

The recipe as is tastes bland, too sweet and has way too many chocolate chips. The next time I make these I'll use about half the chocolate chips, add 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1 tsp of salt.

The perfect chocolate cookie!!  Like other reviewers, I used 1 tsp baking powder and 1tsp baking soda.  The dough is easy to work with and did not require chilling.  I rolled them into walnut sized balls and flattened slightly for a rounder, flatter shaped cookie.  My teenage son said they tasted like a cross between a brownie and a delicious cookie!  We made Creamy Vanilla Ice Cream from this site and plan on making ice cream cookie sandwiches for tomorrow's 4th of July celebration! MMMMMMmmmmm

I liked this recipe very much. I tried rolling the dough into smooth balls before baking and the results were fantastic little smooth rounds that stayed soft inside with a pleasant light crunch to the outside.

So delicious!!! I took raters suggestions and substituted 2 tsp. of baking soda for 1 tsp. of baking soda and 1 tsp. of baking powder. The cookies turned out just like the picture.

I love these! They're awesome. I actually got 5 dozen out of this recipe. They are very fluffy looking and are probably the best cookies I've ever made!

Only used about 1.5 t of soda and did add vanilla and a shot of half and half at the end to help with consistency.

I thought the cookies were a little too chocolaty for my taste so next time I will add half of the chocolate necessary. Also I had to add milk, because the recipe called for none, and it was too dry. I added about 1/2 c. (which I recommend you do) also, I should have expected this, but the cookies were too dark to tell if they were burnt!! Which, if you didn't figure this out, the time was way off for the oven I used. You should put them in at 350 for about 16 minutes.

Just what I wanted! I added about a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla just because I think all cookies need them. 
I also took the advice of another reviewer and used 1 tsp. baking soda and 1 tsp. baking powder. I wish I hadn't. The cookies turned out very puffy and to me, these cookies are supposed to be flat. Personal preference. But delicious!

An interesting cookie to say the least. 

First of all I followed the lead of several in the comments and did 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder, which I definitely recommend to get that traditional cookie shape. I also threw in a small dash of vanilla extract (about 1/8 tsp) for extra flavor - and I plan to add more vanilla in the future.

These cookies are so rich and fluffy that their texture more resembles a brownie than a cookie. And even though this recipe is super chocolately and rich, don't be surprised that it's not as sugary sweet as the more traditional chocolate chip cookie tends to be. If you're looking for more of that sugary sweetness than the thick brownie richness, I would recommend throwing in a few more ounces of white chocolate chips and about 1 tsp of vanilla extract. 

Overall a good cookie and a nice break from the traditional chocolate chip route. Next time I'm in a baking mood I will definitely look to this recipe!

These were so excellent!  I used 1/2 baking soda and 1/2 baking powder, replaced the sugars with a combination of Sucanat, date, and maple sugars and replaced 3/4 C flour with WW pastry flour.  I scooped these with a ball scoop and they ended up keeping their shape and seemed more like little brownies than cookies.  They were a big hit!

Very good!  I used Andie's mint chunks instead of white chocolate chips.  Also, I used a small cookie scooper for these and made 88 bite sized cookies.  After scooping, I rolled in powdered sugar to give a sweet, crackled look when they were done baking.  Delish!

Even after adding more of the wet ingredients, these cookies were still dry and crumbly. They did not flatten out at all from balls on the cookie sheet, and did not cook through well. Would not try again.

These were awesome, but I felt compelled to change the recipe slightly by adding 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla at the end. The dough was quite stiff, so next time (and there will be a next time) I plan to reduce the flour to 1 1/2 cup.

Like others here, I used 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp. baking soda. I also substituted 1/2 cup butter-flavored shortening for half the butter called for. I used 1 cup cocoa powder and 2 cups flour. great results, didn't fall flat at all and had a fudgy flavor and texture. Will make these again.

I used half butter and half shortening knowing I prefer softer cookies. They were still a bit greasy for me, so I will cut back to 3/4c. total next time. I also used mint chips. They were a huge hit at my SO's work. All the officers loved them.

These are good cookies. The dough seemed a bit strange but it may be because of the substitutions we did. I added in about a cup of dried cherries, 1 cup of chocolate chunks,  used whole wheat flour instead of white, 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 c white, 1 tsp baking soda and 1tsp baking powder (instead of the 2 tsp baking soda) added 1 tsp vanilla and a handful of pistachios, 1 tsp of cinnamon and rolled them in coconut. I think the missing ingredient of why people are getting flat cookies may be adding 1/2 tsp of salt (the salt needs to react with the baking soda/powder to release air which should help them from being flat. Overall a good dark chocolate cookie recipe.Made another version and followed the recipe almost exactly (except added, pinch of salt,  1/2 baking soda, 1/2 baking powder and 1tsp vanilla). I chilled the dough for about 10 minutes and it was fine. I found the cookies a bit sweet for my liking. Added in dried cranberries, cardamon and cinnamon and it was great :)

Wow, I was so surprised at how unappealing these cookies tasted!  I read several reviews, followed the directions and recommendations for adding vanilla and 1 tps baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder. Until now, I have always trusted the ratings and reviews with great results. Not with this recipe!

I followed the original recipe with the following changes:
Used Crisco instead of butter.
Used 1 cup of Hershey's cocoa powder.
Added 2TBSP of milk to the mix. 

I baked them at 325 for exactly 8 minutes and took them out when they still looked underdone. They were perfect!

Very yummy! I followed the recipe except for a dash of salt and 1 tsp baking soda / 1 tsp baking powder. With my first batch, I rolled the dough into balls by hand and the cookies took longer to bake and did not spread very much. The second batch, I did the same thing but pressed the dough balls onto the cookie sheet with my palm to flatten them a little, and those cookies took less time and turned out more flat, like I wanted. These were a little more "cakey" than I usually prefer, so if I make these again, I'll bake them a little less. The flavor is very chocolatey. I used a full bag of Ghiradelli white chocolate chips, but I think they could stand a little more chips ideally. Very good recipe as written; these will go quickly. Thanks for sharing!

Took suggestions of adding 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder.  Also added 1 tsp. salt and vanilla.  Only had salted butter, so that's what I used.  I rolled them into balls, for uniformity.  They did NOT spread out, so they looked like little puff balls.  Next batch I rolled them into a ball and flattened them into the size and shape of a normal cookie (just took a second).  They turned out perfect.  I'm bringing them to a sick friend tomorrow along with homemade chicken salad, three bean salad, fresh strawberries, homemade granola bars and root beer to top it off.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I tried half baking soda/half baking powder and they came out great!  We like our cookies puffy and a bit cake-like.  I also used tablespoon-fuls when I put the cookies on the cookie sheet, so it made 24 instead of 36, which was fine with me.

I followed the recipe exactly but once they cooled and I went to put them away they just fell apart : ( Not sure if I did something wrong but it's difficult to eat them as they just crumble. Good taste though.

Made these last night and they turned out great.  Followed others advice and changed to 1tsp baking powder and 1tsp baking soda.  Checked on cooking after 8 minutes and were not flattening out.  Pressed them down with a fork in the oven and baked 1 more minute and they came out perfectly!

The cookies are awesome! Made them EXACTLY as instructed and they turned out perfect. Don't be worried if they come out soft after baking. They'll harden after cooling.

This was a very yummy recipe. I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon,  1 tsp. of vanilla, and 1/2 c. chopped nuts. Scrumptious! I followed the advice of a review and did half baking soda, 1/2 baking powder and the cookies did not flatten out. I did have to bake them longer than the 8-10 minutes.

Everything came out great, tasted great. Dough did end up hard to work with after adding the flour and coca powder. Ended up adding 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and instead of white chips I added mint chocolate chips and before baking I dripped the top in confectioners sugar. My test batch I scooped them in balls and they didn't drop much baking. Second batch I flatten and it came out perfect and chewy. Definitely one for my recipe box.

Flavor was excellent and not too sweet. The only problem I had was that they came out too dry. I made this as written except followed the recommendation of 1tsp baking soda, 1tsp baking powder.

I added 1tsp vanilla and a pinch of salt. Got rave reviews from everyone who tried them at the party. Mine didn't flatten or spread at all, stayed almost ball-like. Very rich, but I like that. They did seem to dry out faster than other cookies I make; best eaten within a couple days. I didn't rate 5 stars because these weren't exactly what I was looking for...kind of cake-like. But, they are still very good!

I took the advice from several other reviewers... I did as others and used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder. I also added 1 tsp vanilla.  I used all unsweetened cocoa just because I didn't have any other.  I cut the flour down to 1 1/4 cups and added a box of white chocolate instant pudding. I added a quarter teaspoon of salt, 1 cup white chips, a little over 1 cup semi-sweet chips, about half a cup of milk chocolate chips,  1 1/4 cups coconut. I cooked them for 9 minutes, which was perfect for my oven.  They are so good!

Rich and decadent for sure! Seemed like too much cocoa powder when I was mixing- tastes more like dark chocolate. (I guess it just depends on your personal preference.) I didn't have baking powder, as other suggested, and was afraid of my cookies going flat, so I tried the suggested amount of baking soda and added 1 tsp cream of tartar. The dough was pretty thick, like brownie batter, so I added an extra egg and the cookies kept their shape on the cookie sheet. They fluffed up like rocky road-looking merengues, & are chewy with a softer center. I also added some dried cranberries, pecans, and 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocoloate chips. Maybe too rich? Still delicious!

I make these cookies without the white chocolate chips.  Whenever I make them, they're gone right away.  My family specifically requests these cookies.  In my opinion, they're like eating a brownie in a cookie form.  YUM!

Delicious!  Instead of white chocolate chips I put in Andes Mint pieces and they were to die for.  I also uses 1 tsp. baking soda and 1 tsp. baking powder and they came out perfect!

My son and I attended a holiday bizarre and a local bakery gave us samples of chocolate mint cookies. They were wonderful and I'm not a big mint/cookie fan. I found this receipe as it was chocolate and used mint chips instead of white chocolate chips. This tasted like girl scout thin mint cookies only bigger and softer. They were a huge hit with my boys and their friends. We will make again.

These are indeed very rich cookies, almost brownie like.  I was a little worried mixing the dough because it was very dry, but in the end the cookies turned out just fine.  Be careful not to overbake, as I did with my first batch.  They don't look quite done after 8-10 minutes, but they firm up a lot sitting on the sheet for a few minutes.

The flavor is very rich and decadent, however these cookies are so crumbly you can't even grab one. I think it is due to the excessive amount of cocoa powder in them. Also, if you make them do not use an insulated baking sheet.

Well my bf's bday is this weekend so I decided cookies are a good option. Annnd I used yummy Whittakers milk choc chopped up as the chips instead of white milk. I added the tsp baking soda & tsp baking powder like the others, also the tsp vanilla. Then when I put them on the baking sheet I used a small round cookie cutter to make little round towers of cookie dough.  They spread out a little bit and I found I needed to cook them for the full 9-10 min because they were quite thick. BUT the yum part was melting white choc and dribbling this over the cookies the next morning. Most look fab, some look a bit demented but they are delish. Very brownie-like. I'm sure he will love them. If not. I do :) Thanks

I made these yesterday afternoon (exactly as written), the dough was super stiff... I had to work everything in by hand. I rolled the dough into balls and then flattened the balls before I put it on my cookie sheet and baked them for 8 minutes exactly. Mine didn't spread out like other reviewers said, they grew a bit but were by no means 'flat' when they came out. Right out of the oven I would have given these 3 stars, maybe 2.5 stars. The centers were a litty chewy, but dry at the same time, and the edges were super dry, they crumbled and broke off if you weren't careful w/ them. However the next morning these tasted fantastic! They were soft and chewy all around, the top crust had a little bit of crunch to it because of the sugar... it was like a condensed brownie. Id absolutely make these again,  thanks!

LOVE this cookie. I have even made it with chocolate mint chips and it is phenomenal as well. The reason I don't give it 5 stars; everytime I make these cookies, they crumble VERY easily. No matter how long I let them cool or how long I store them, they tend to break into pieces. Good for sprinkling on ice cream, bad for enjoying just a cookie.

Very good cookie!!!  I always try to alter any recipe to make it my own which I did.  I used half butter and half shortning, a bit over a teaspoon of vanilla and as others stated 1 teaspoon of baking soda and one baking powder.  My last alteration was added a bag of chocolate chips, which I will call my cookies triple chocolate chip cookies.  These were very good!!!  Thank you :)

Very good, easy, few ingredients. Husband says not as "chocolately" as he'd like but his sweet tooth runs deep. I bake in an electric oven at 4000 ft so I kept mine in for 12 minutes.

Yummy! These taste very similar to Otis Spunkmeyer's. I only had 6oz. of white chocolate baking squares, so I cut the recipe in half and used the squares, roughly chopped. Added some salt and vanilla as other reviewers mentioned. Also, used half baking powder and half baking soda, but I had to press these with my spatula because they weren't spreading as much as I'd like... I think flatter cookies look more delicious.

LOVED this recipe! Used 1tsp baking soda and 1tsp baking soda as other reviewers suggested. Used semisweet choc chips and walnuts too. Cookies did not flatten and were sooo moist. Cooked 8 minutes, let cool 5 minutes on the pan, then pulled off. Just perfect. Thanks, Amy!

Great cookies. Has the richness of a brownie, and the white chocolate helps to lighten it. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems. My roommates gobbled them up right away!

These were delicious, but I am giving it 4 stars this time around because I ran out of cocoa powder and ended up using unsweetened chocolate squares (melted of course) to replace the other half. They came out tasting great but a bit grainy from the sugar, I guess I need to cream it better next time. I will make these again with all cocoa powder and update my review. I love white chocolate so these were a real treat for me. I baked mine for 9 minutes.

Pretty good.  I would recommend baking them for 12-14 minutes if you want a little more crispiness to the edges of your cookie, or else they are extremely soft.  VERY chocolately, which is great - but I think it needed some more butter or salt to balance it out.  Probably would try a different recipe next time and wouldn't use this again.

Fantastic!  The only thing I changed was that I, being a tightwad, made a double batch, but only used about 1 1/4 bags of chips instead of 2.  Still plenty of chips.  Definitely will make it again.

These cookies taste like brownie bites with a thin, slightly crisp shell around a chewy center. Delicious!

SUBSTITUTIONS:
* 1t soda and 1t baking powder instead of 2t soda
* 1c white chocolate chips and 1c semi-sweet chocolate chips

TIPS: 
* Used a size 50 scoop to portion room-temperature dough on to a pre-heated Pampered Chef rectangle baking stone  
* Baked cookies at 350 degrees for 8 minutes and let cool on baking stone for 2 minutes before removing and transferring to a cooling rack
* Recipe yielded 5 doz cookies

My 12 yr old triplets made these with their stepsister, and I was very impressed! We ran out of white chocolate chips and supplemented the rest with semi-sweet chocolate. I'm not a fan of white chocolate, but combined with the chocolate batter, it was fabulous. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

The cookies were very good and as many wrote they are like a brownie.  I only baked them for 8 minutes and found that some did break apart easily so I will bake for 10 minutes next time.  This recipe is a keeper.  The cookies are sweet but not too sweet and were very easy to make.  Very enjoyable thank you for the recipe.

These cookies turned out perfectly for me!  I reduced flour by 1/4 cup, added tsp. vanilla & a bit of salt. Also 1/2 baking soda, 1/2 baking powder.  Did 1/2 the cookies with white chips & the rest with peanut butter. They were perfectly soft, puffy, crispy at the edges. Thank you!

This was a very delicious, decadent, sugary, and of course chocolatey treat, well-liked by everyone who tried it. I still prefer regular chocolate chip cookies, but with white chocolate chips hanging around the house, this a good recipe to have on hand. I have a few complaints, however, the dough was IMPOSSIBLE to stir by hand and even the mixers had some trouble with the thickness. In addition, if I make this again, I will defnitely head the advice of others and cut down on sugar.

batter is extremely stiff. I followed the recipe exactly, and the batter was so stiff, even my electric beaters got tired!lol. They came out good, but barely spread. They were very dense, which is not such a bad thing, but they did lack a bit of flavor. Maybe some vanilla or coffee would have given it more taste. And addition of some cream or milk would have fixed the stiffness problem. I would go with a different recipe alltogether though next time. Thanks!

These were the best! Definitely a keeper. I could barely keep my kids out of the kitchen while baking these. I took other reviewers' advice and used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder. Thank you for the recipe.

I followed the directions exactly on this and initially I was a touch concerned that the batter was too dry; however, it baked up into a very nice, dense, slightly cake-like cookie.   Amazingly rich chocolate flavor and I dare say that if you are having a chocolate craving, 1 or 2 of these cookies will nip that in the bud.   I used a tablespoon to measure the batter and I got 65 cookies instead of the suggested yield of 48.

Only change I made to this recipe was use half butter, half shortening. I wanted to prevent spreading.

I made these on the smaller size. Think of the two-bite brownies....only it's a cookie! These turned out really well. The consistancy of the cookies reminds me of the chocolate wafers they use for Oreo cookies. I underbaked
them just a little to keep them moist but they still were a little dry. Still a tasty cookie.

YUMMY!  I the only change I made to the recipe was to add a pinch of salt and some vanilla, but with just the baking soda they are puffed up (flat at the edges), moist, and I got 36 exactly.  (I used a Pampered Chef scooper ... the larger one (not ice creamed sized).)  The dough is thick, but not not unworkable.  I don't know what others mean by the texture being off ... maybe they didn't mix it long enough at the beginning or after the eggs.  I would highly recommend using parchment paper - that could help explain why people's cookies get to be too flat.  Keep it to 8 - 8:30 minutes.  Just a great, easy recipe!  THANK YOU!

I just finished baking these cookies and they are yummy!  I added 1 tbls. coffee and 1 tsp. vanilla as suggested.  Also as suggested, I used 1 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. baking soda.  I always do this with choc. chip cookies because I like them a little softer.  I got 3 1/2 dozen using a small cookie scoop.  Thanks for the recipe and suggestions!

I liked the chocolaty flavor of these alot but I was not crazy about the texture-- let's just say I have had better and I doubt that I will make these again. Just for the record  I added vanilla and chopped macadamia nuts.

The flavor was good, but the cookie wasn't as soft as I would have liked. Next time, I might try adding some molasses to soften it up :)

I've tried this recipe twice and with some changes it's great. BOTH times I HALVED the recipe b/c I didn't want to make a lot. 1st try: I used 1/2t each of baking powder and baking soda (as another rater suggested) - the cookies came out puffy (not flat) but they were still hard. I like chewy cookies so I looked at a soft cookie recipe to copy it. The following changes make a great soft cookie: (using a halved recipe) use 1/2t baking soda, reduce 1/2c white sugar to 1/4c plus 2T, reduce 1/2c + 2T cocoa to only 1/2c, and reduce 3/4c + 2T flour to 3/4c. Use the suggested amounts of the other ingredients, and the cookies will come out chocolatey and delicious! (P.S. these cookies are even good without the white chocolate chips)

These came out pretty chocolately and were pretty easy to make. I thought they were just ok, but my co-workers really enjoyed them.

When i baked these cookies, everyone in my family LOVED them (including me). They were perfectly moist and soft. Two suggestions though, I would use a little less chocolate chips. The other thing was, that I had to use salted butter, and it worked just as well (if not better) than unsalted butter. Great recipe!

I make these way more often the regular choc. chip! I have added salt and vanilla but I think the salt is JUST too much. With it already being a very filling cookie i really don't think it needs vanilla and salt. They're not a cookie you can mess up, always turn out right!

Made these last night and should have read the reviews before starting. I didn't like the taste at all, but have to give it a 3 because my daughter loved them. Probably will make again with suggested adjustments.

Amazing!  I am completely done with trying to make those stupid chocolate crinkle (rock) cookies.  These are so much easier and better tasting.  I only baked them for eight minutes (4 top, 4 bottom rack) and they came out chewy and weren't too flat.  For a festive touch, I used Nestle's red and green swirl white chocolate chips.  I'll be adding these to my list of Christmas cookies to bake every year- and frequently in between!
Thanks so much for the recipe.

not sure what happened, but I don't love these.  Based on other reviews, I thought I would love them, but they are a little too cocoa-ey for me.  I was trying to recreate the Domino cookie from Great American Cookie Company...this isn't it.

Awesome! I always follow a recipie as written the first time, but I realized after I started that I only had a half a bag of white chips, so I had to add a half a bag of semi-sweet chips to make up the difference.  I'm sure it's delcious made with all white chips, but the addition of the chocolate chips was a chocolate lovers dream!  I will definately make this one again!

Just as others suggested I also added a tsp salt and a tsp of vanilla. I also added a 1/2 a cup of vanilla pudding and reduced the flour accordingly. The pudding keeps your cookies soft for ever!! If you are a true chocolate lover you can add chocolate pudding ummmmm! Make sure that you wait for the cookies to set because it takes about 20 minutes and they are so soft!!

I took previous reviewers' advice and added 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of vanilla.  The cookies were delicious and my 3 year old daughter enjoyed licking the beater as well as eating the finished cookie.  I am a chocoholic so if the cookies were just for me I would have used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the white chips.  I think the contrast of the white chips against the chocolate cookie look great, though, and the cookies are for my aunt so I stuck to the recipe on that.  I'm surprised at all the people who think this cookie looks unappetizing.  I think it looks great!  Wonderful recipe that I'll definitely make again.

VERY chocolately cookie!  I did cut the cocoa powder back to 1 cup, but that's the only change I made.  I pressed the dough balls flat with the palm of my hand per other reviewers' suggestions as they didn't spread a lot.  This made 4 dozen cookies for me, using a regular cookie scoop.  We really liked these.

These cookies were delicious!!  My husband who isn't really that into chocolate kept coming by and stealing bits of the dough... He couldn't wait.

I added 1 tsp salt and 1 tablespoon vanilla.  I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of white chocolate (because I didn't have enough).  Another variation I might do next time is to add some coffee for a mocha flavored cookie.

Cookies had too much bitter chocolate taste for this chick. I tried the recipe again and used 3/4 of a cup of baking chocolate instead of 1 1/4 cup, I added a teaspoon of vanila extract, and a dash of salt. The cookies were delicious.

These cookies were good, but a little hard to mix up... I used an electronic mixer, and the dough was very tough and sticky. Also, the butter did not mix in very well...it was only at the very disappeared. Probably will not make again, but they taste good this time.

For Health benefits I also added whole wheat flour! I like the consistency, and the improved color. I have also tried Fish Oil in, as a way of getting more vitamins in for my daily intake. You would think it tastes bad, but it adds great flavor that is better than the original! Healthy Eating!

excellent chocolate cookie recipe...substituted whole wheat flour and used splenda instead of sugar to cut back a little...you couldn't even notice the difference...very chocolatey and my 5 + 4 year old loved them!  Also, I added a T. of imitation vanilla extract...will definitly use this again and again!  Thank you!

These turned out pretty great.  I just don't think a chocolate cookie is very aesthetically pleasing, maybe not right for a gift tray, but live and learn.  I used red and green striped white choc chips which helped.  The taste was great, will make again for eat not show.

Just made these and loved them.  I used 1/4 cup shortening and 3/4 cup butter, added 2 teaspoons vanilla, and a tablespoon of coffee, as one of the other reviews suggested.  They were fabulous.  I baked for 10 minutes, and it seemed to be the perfect time.  Crunchy on the outside, chewy inside. Tastes like a brownie with white chocolate chips in it.

Perfectly yummy.  I used a combo of butter and virgin organic coconut oil, carob powder instead of cocoa, added a generous teaspoon of  sea salt and some vanilla.  Baked a full 10 min and got a perfect cookie.  Would be great with any kind of chip or nut I think.

This was a good recipe but still in search of "best" chocolate cookie recipe. The cookies turned out a little greasy. I would lower the butter/margarine next time. Also not quite sweet enough. Would add a touch more sugar. Great texture though. :)

I'm a novice at baking, and the cookies turned out very well for me. They spread out a lot, and they were very chocolaty and tasty. They were a bit greasier than i'd like them to be, though. Thanks for the recipe!

I was very disappointed in this!  I used a recipe for cookies like this awhile back that had chocolate cake mix, and the cookies were wonderful.  These cookies, however, fell short of my expectations and were a complete waste of time.  The cocoa overpowers the entire cookie, and it tastes bitter instead of sweet.  There should be either less cocoa powder or more sugar to balance things out.  Very dissapointing!

mmmm, the pinnacle of chocolatey heaven! i definitely didn't have enough cocoa powder on hand, but apparently 1 oz. baking chocolate is equivalent to 3 tbsp cocoa and 1 tbsp oil or whatever fat, so i did out the math and stuck in 7 oz of melted chocolate (21 tbsp vs. the 20 called for in the recipe) and then subtracted 7 tbsp of butter from the recipe. for butter, i used a smart balance/butter combo, as i ran out of s.b. i added 1 cup chopped and salted macadamias, as well as maybe a teaspoon vanilla. the only problem was that by the time the cookies had come out, i had already eaten too much cookie dough to enjoy more than one! and these came out of the oven not too tall or too flat. i make small cookies, and got more than 40 from this recipe. my family thanks you for a heavenly cookie!

I was cooking in a college dorm with borrowed cookingware, limited ingredients, and none of my own recipes, and I was in a rush. These cookies came out perfect on the first try. The batter is very fluffy and the cookies are very soft. I used non-hydrogenated margarine instead of butter, but otherwise followed the recipe precisely: great!

although this recipe has mostly 5 star ratings, the few poor reviews made the cookies sound so horrible i was still a little hesitant to try them, finally decided to and i am so glad i did. disregard the bad reviews, these were so easy and so scrumptious!!! great recipe!

These are awesome.  I even messed up and thought they were ruined.  I had used only 1/2 cup of butter.  When I realized it everything else had been mixed.  I got another stick to room temp. (slowly in micro) and just blended it in.  They turned out wonderful.  The flavor and texture is perfect.

These are the are indubitably the greatest tasting  white chocolate chip cookies. Personnaly I think they're better than milk chocolate chips, but chocolate is chocolate in the end. I used salted butter and added cinnamon to add a more flavor to a great recipe. The only problem with this recipe in the end is the calorie count.  I'd give it a 4.5 for that reason if it were posible but this is simply the best cookie ever therefor I'd rather give it a 5 than a 4.

A chocolaholic's dream. Very, very rich. I can get more than 3 dozen from a recipe, and I thought I made generous size cookies. I found them a bit sticky for a drop cookie, so instead I roll them into little balls and then flatten them lightly with the palm of my hand.

Very delicious and decedent!  They dissapeared very quickly!  They did, however get hard and more like biscuits after a day.  I will most probably make them again, this time with all brown sugar to keep them soft and chewy.

One of the best cookie recipes I've tried in a long time! I used only 1c. cocoa and they were still very rich and delicious! A brownie you can pick up without a mess! Wonderful! A must to use good quality white choc. chips! Thanks Amy, we'll be baking these for years to come.
*to the person who had flat cookies. Next time put 1 or 2 T. flour in the remaining batter. That usually fixes the problem.

I decided to try these out since when my parents moved to another state, mom was giving me some food she didn't want to have to move- including white chocolate chips. I don't normally like white chocolate at all, but coupled with the rich, dark chocolate batter it's something that even I enjoy. My boyfriend inhales them and my roomies steal them to munch on. I guess that makes them pretty good.

With 1 1/4 cups of cocoa, how can you go wrong?  These are spectacular!  They have a fantastic, rich chocolate flavor, and are the perfect combination of soft and chewy at 8 minutes (at least in my oven).  This has entered my cookbook as my standard "opposite chocolate chip cookie" recipe.

The batter was quite dry.  i rolled them into fairly large balls and was quite surprised at how well they baked up.  that being said, unless i measured the cocoa incorrectly, i thought these to be over the top chocolate.  i had difficulty picking up on the white chocolate chip flavor.  not sure i'll be making these again.

I did tweak to modify: 

Add:
1 tsp Vanilla
1 tsp Salt
1 package chocolate pudding
1 tsp Baking Soda

Reduce Flour to 1 1/4 cup

Baked for 9 minutes.  It wasn't too sweet.  I initially thought that would be a problem.  It was slightly crips on the edges and moist in the middle.  

Delicious and would make again.  My co-workers loved it.

My best friend and I first baked these cookies together years ago and it’s been a favorite loved by everybody I’ve introduced these cookies to! From friends, family, and even coworkers. I’ve never once had somebody say they dislike them!! Couple of tips I’ve learned making these over the years: add a little canola oil if the batter seems very tough and dry, I always eyeball around a 1/2 tsp of vanilla into my batter. Most importantly for me this makes the recipe: DARK cocoa powder. I use Hershey’s special dark cocoa powder. I can’t recommend this recipe enough. It’s worth the time and efforts!

Woah. That was intense. These cookies are super sweet and, like many of the negative reviews said, kind of crumbly. I made my extra large in the hopes tehy would be gooeier and more brownie or cake-lie but, alas, they were kind of crumbly. I'm sure my boyfriend will like them because they are over-the-top sweet, but whew-boy. I probably won't make them again unless he raves about them.

They turned out good and were made using the exact directions.  After a couple days they did become dry even though they were in a zip lock bag. May need a little more moisture in the recipe?

I made no substitutions at all, but I did follow one reviewers note to not over bake.  I left my cookies in for 9 minutes, took them out, let them sit for two minutes on the cookie sheet and then put them on the cooling rack.  These were as delicious as promised, chocolatey and scrumptious!  I will definitely make these again and again, great recipe!

This recipe is AMAZING! I added about 1 teaspoon of vanilla but other wise, I don’t even think this recipe needs any adjustments...they passed my taste tester’s taste test... aka: my boyfriend whom is a lot pickier than me!

These are very good and loaded with white chocolate chips. Like other reviewers, I used 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda. For me, it's a little heavy on the chocolate chips. Next time I will use 1 pkg or approx 1.5 cups. If you love loads of chocolate chips, this is the recipe to use. It is very important to let the cookies cool slightly on the pan before moving the, to the rack. I can normally move a cookie to the cooling rack straight out of the oven. Not it's this recipe. Will make again.

Substitute white chocolate chips with Andes creme de menthe baking chips that I purchased at Wal-Mart. Chocolate and mint can't go wrong.

Great cookies! Really puffy and chocolate.  I made these as per the recipes, only added a tsp. of instant expresso powder for a deeper chocolate flavour.

Pretty good chocolate cookie. It wasn't overly sweet and had a very soft texture, almost like a brownie in a cookie shape. If I'm ever craving a chocolate cookie again, I would use this recipe again.

My grandchildren and I made these and they were delicious! We did use 1 teaspoon of baking soda and baking powder and baked for 8 minutes. Crispy on outside moist inside. Gave some to their neighbors and they raved about them! Made another batch today but used chocolate chips because we ran out of the white and added vanilla. Haven't baked yet. I always stick the dough in the fridge for a few hours before baking.

Delicious cookies.  I haven't actually made them with white chocolate chips yet.  I did one batch with salted caramel chips and toffee bits, and another batch with Reese's Pieces.  Both were delicious.  This recipe has more cocoa powder than others, and this makes the cookies very fudgy and good.  I did use 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking soda instead of 2 tsp of baking soda, and they are wonderful.  I make my batter a day before I need them, and I spoon it onto a cookie sheet with wax paper and freeze them before I cook them.  I cook them straight out of the freezer at 350 for 11 minutes.  They are very soft when the come out, but after they cool, they are very gooey and chewy, and crisp on the outside.  Very good cookies.  This will be my new chocolate cookie recipe.  Thanks.

I made these because I was looking for a chocolate cookie recipe where I can use the rest of my leftover m&m's (I've had sitting around for a year).

They turned out better than I expected.  I only used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup, about a 1/2 tsp. of salt, a Tbs. of strong brewed coffee, a little over half a cup m&m's, a half cup white chips,  a cup of semi sweet chips and a cup of chopped walnuts.  They are fantastic!

My husband rarely, if ever, goes to the cookie jar to help himself to cookies.  I think he's eaten half the jar by himself.

I just took the last sheet out of the oven and these are delicious! I can't wait until they cool because I know they will be even better.  The only change I made was to add a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of vanilla.  This is going to be my go to recipe when I need to satisfy a chocolate craving.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

I really didn't like these.  I make a lot of cookies and followed this recipe exactly (with the exception of doing half baking soda, half baking powder like some commenters suggested) and thought these were bland and the texture was pretty funky.  They looked pretty and were easy, but that's about it.

Tasty cookies!  I also substituted 1 tsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. baking soda for the original 2 tsp. baking soda.  And, (because I had them), I used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1 cup of white chocolate chips instead of 2 cups white chocolate chips.  The cookies were soft, moist and delicious!  I was expecting them to be hard or crunchy, but the key is to not overbake them.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

These cookies came out awesome! I made them different ways. First I made them using the white chocolate chips - amazing. Then I wanted a more Christmas-themed cookie so I chopped up some Andes candies and put them in. The cookies taste just like the candies and it's now one of my favorite cookies! I would have used mint chips but I couldn't find any, but now I don't think I would use them if I found them. The Andes candies were an awesome addition!

These were ok but for me they were a bit bland, maybe some nuts would have helped.  Will eat them, but probably won't make them again.

Followed the recipe exactly, and they came out perfect.  Will definitely make them again.  Took the whole batch to work, and they disappeared in about three hours.

I just finished making these cookies today.  They are good but I feel like they are missing something like salt.  The next time I make them I will try salted butter and about 1/4 tsp of additional salt.

Taste was fine, but cookies were crumbly and dry. Additionally they didn't flatten and we're just round balls until I smashed.

I made these for the work Christmas party and to take to family Christmas. I added a touch of vanilla, because I put vanilla in everything. I tripled the recipe then divided it and added andes mint chips (half a bag because they're really strong) to one batch, butterscotch chips to one batch, and butterfinger chips to the last batch. They were a big hit.

These were great! I used semi sweet chocolate chips (no white chocolate on hand) and I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. My husband took them to work and they were a hit!

Very good cookies.  I made this twice.  I added 1 tsp salt both times since I used unsalted butter.  There is a lot of butter in these so I didn't see a need to grease the pan but I did use parchment paper and they came off easily.  I'm looking forward to trying this by substituting the white chocolate chips for a different type of add-ins like dark chocolate chips, nuts or toffee chips.

I only made a half a batch because that is the amount of cocoa that I had.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the white because that is what I had on hand.  I also used 6TBSPs margarine and 2 TBSPs shortening instead of the butter.  Obviously, I wasn't prepared to make this recipe when I chose it, but I needed a chocolate cookie recipe for my son's construction birthday cake.  However, the cookies came out awesome!!  They were soft after baking just 9 minutes in my oven!  I will definitely make these again.

Use 'Butter Flavor' Crisco instead of butter! I use that Ingredient for every cookie recipe instead of butter; the cookies raise better and keep their 'fluff' (I hate flat greasy cookies)! I used the rest of the ingredients as directed. Beautiful & delicious!

The cookies came out okay.  They were a bit drier than we like and for some odd reason my white chocolate chips did not melt in the cookies.

These are good. I didn't have any trouble with them flattening out. They stayed nice and round. Soft on the inside. I did use 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder instead of the 2 tsp of baking soda the recipe calls for.

Good flavor, but mine crumbled apart as well, and did not flatten out. I did what other reviewers suggested by using 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, along with 1 teaspoon vanilla. Like all baking recipes I make, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil. I still can't figure out why they crumbled.

Great snow day cookies! They came out really nicely, with a cake-like consistency. Perfect with a tall glass of milk. My only problem arose when I added the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. The dough is really incredibly thick, and I was worried that my little electric hand mixer was going to give up on me. But I think my issue is that I still use an electric hand mixer.

All in all, great recipe, lovely cookies.

I made this recipe as written and it tastes like a brownie almost! Chewy and delicious. It may seem like the amount of sugar you're putting in is a lot but once you bite into the cookie you'll see that it's the perfect amount.  I definitely will make these again. I'm so glad my first venture into baking chocolate cookies was this one.

Loved them!  We've been trying to be a little healthier around here lately, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion, and tried the 1/2 applesauce thing.  Amazed, can't tell one bit there is half the butter in there!  I will have to try that substitution in other recipes - I've seen it done a lot, but never tried it before today.  We really loved this recipe.   I did add a little vanilla, too, as I do in most recipes.

This recipe is perfect.  The ONLY change I made (other than chips) was following the advice of other reviewers to use 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda.  Oh my gosh!  These are perfect.  The first time I made them, I did not use chips at all.  The second time, I used chocolate chips.  When you take them out, they look a little under done, but after they sit for 5 minutes, they really are perfect.  I put them in tupperware overnight and they kept very well for the 2 days they lasted.  LOVE these!  Thank you!

I have never made chocolate cookies, but decided to, today. I searched in google, and this site had the best sounding recipe. And it is a very good recipe! I did add about half a cup of coconut, put only 1 cup white chocolate chips, and 3/4 white sugar, and half cup brown sugar though. 
I put too big of spoonfuls on(2x cook time), but they are done, not dough, and not crunchy. Little crisp outside, and moist like cake inside.

This recipe was really good, though to be honest, I would prefer a more rich chocolate flavor. Perhaps next time I will add some bittersweet cocoa chips or something similar. The only change I made was doing 1 tsp baking soda and then 1 tsp of baking powder. However, this made them more brownie like than I had really wanted. Next time I will omit the baking powder to try achieve a crunchier cookie as the recipe originally states. Will definitely try them again, but with bittersweet chocolate added in.

These were delicious.  The only bad thing is that I modified the recipe and only made a dozen!!!!

I added in a teaspoon of vanilla, dash of baking powder along with the baking soda and will certainly make these again!

this recipe is awesome. My hubby who is not a choc fan(whch is good because I'm a chocaholic) said " this recipe is a keeper". I read a lot of the reviews , the ideas and suggestions varied greatly, so I did the exact recipe and they turned out GREAT - will definitely make these again and again

These were fantastic! I've been teaching myself how to cook and bake lately, and yesterday I had a craving for cookies. Spur of the moment cookie decision, I guess you could call it. I mixed the baking soda and baking powder like other reviewers suggested and had no problems at all. I haven't made cookies since I was little and my mother would do all of the hard work. Very easy to make! Only took half and hour! I was a little skeptical of the baking time since ten minutes seemed like it wouldn't cook throughly but I followed the recipe and wow! My brother and I haven't been able to keep our hands off these. I'm glad him and I are both athletes!

These are a favourite around here! Anytime I share them with someone new, they are raving and asking for the recipe. Soft, chewy, chocolatey and delicious! I don't change a thing, except using margarine and not butter.

These cookies are my new favorite source of chocolate! I didn't have any white chips so I made them with regular chocolate chips and used 3 cups instead of 2...to make sure they had plenty of chocolatey goodness. They hit the spot.

I have made this cookie with and without the chips. I made a double batch, make roundish balls of dough with my mini-ice cream scooper and freeze the balls on a cookie sheet. Once they are frozen solid I put them in a zip lock bag and make them a dozen at a time in the toaster over.

Great recipe!!  I followed the exact measurements for all ingredients but did not follow the mixing directions.  I did use 2T of Baking Soda and my cookies came out perfect.  I did NOT grease my cookie sheet so my cookies did not spread to disks like others complained about.  These cookies are more brownie like but isn't that what a chocolate cookie should taste like!?  I would definitely make these again and next time will try Mint Chocolate chunks instead of White Chocolate chips.  Also-Had to adjust the baking temp and time, but I think it's my oven's fault not the recipe's.  ;)  Thanks for a great recipe!!  I'm in heaven!

I tried these because I was looking for a recipe to mimic the Triple Chocolate Pizookie at BJ's restaurant.  I just substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips for the white chocolate chips, baked them in individual tart pans, and topped with ice cream while they were still warm.  AMAZING!

These turned out great, only change I made was cutting the butter in half. The cooking time seemed short but after letting them cool for 5 minutes on the sheet, they came out perfect!

Very good, also added 1tea. vanilla and used 1tea .soda and 1tea baking powder instead of the 2tea. of baking soda. Rolled up in balls instead of dropping,  Baked for 10Min, came out perfect. May roll in sugar next time

These cookies are perfect. I'm pretty much always disappointed with chocolate cookies because they always seem cakey or deficient in chocolate or both. These are rich with chocolate, perfectly chewy, with just a hint of crispiness on the outside. I even liked the dough (sacrilegious as it is to everyone else, I am not a fan of cookie dough. Until now.) The only thing I would caution you on is to WATCH THE BAKING TIME. Beyond the minimum bake time starts to get hazardous to the bottoms.

This recipe was fantastic!! I've never made this type of cookie before, and so glad I chose this recipe. 

For anyone making this type of cookie for the first time - Follow advice from other reviews - DON'T overcook! Because the color is so dark, you won't know by color when they're done.  Also, the white chocolate doesn't get gooey like a regular chocolate chip. Follow the timing and let them cool. EVERYONE was in love with the cookies and I'll be making them again!!

These cookies are nothing short of amazing! A good tip, use an electric mixer to mix the batter. I just don't like to digging around for mine so I stirred by hand. My arm is a bit sore from stirring the fudgey batter but nothing fixes a sore arm like a delicious cookie or two. Oh and 8 minutes seemed to work great for me. The cookie looked a little puffy coming out of the oven but after you let it sit on the cookie sheet another 5 minutes before removing them, the puffiness resides and you get a perfectly textured cookie.

These turned out AWESOME!!! I wasn't so sure when I started the recipe but I'm glad I continued on. I halved the recipe and changed a few things and I think it made all the difference. I used a mix of natural and dutch cocoa, just because it's what I had in the cabinet. Used salted butter, again because that's what I had. Added a splash a vanilla and 1 tsp. of baking powder and the result was beautiful! It's like a cookie and a brownie reproduced and the offspring is delicious! 
*UPDATE* I made these again, but replaced the white chocolate chips with a chunked up dark chocolate orange. It was a HIT!!

Very good!  I've also made them with half semi-sweet chips, and added a little extra flour for a lighter texture; just for something different.  Wonderful when done just according to the recipe.

These were so good! I forgot all about a cookie exchange we were having at work until very late the night before. I had these ingredients on hand and was soo impressed! I baked each batch for 8 1/2 minutes and they were beautiful. Very soft on the inside and maintained shape, woth a slight crunch on the outside. They went over very well at the exchange and my family loved them, too. Thanks for a great recipe I will definitely be making again!

I give this recipe a 3.5.  The cookies tasted good, but they were a lot sweeter than expected and sweeter than the ones I was trying to dupe.  I will be trying another recipe next time.

Awesome!  These turned out to be the best chocolate cookies I've made!  My husband was quite impressed.  I asked him if there was anything he would change/add, and he said nuts.  I think I'll try that next time.  I bet they'll be even more amazing!

Comes out great every time.  Didn't change much, but I did use higher quality white chocolate bars broken into little chunks instead of white chocolate chips - the higher quality chocolate really makes a difference and the uneven chunks add a nice texture.  I also always add a little salt to any cookie recipe.

Delicious and a nice texture, but way too much cocoa powder.  Next time I'd use maybe 1 cup or even 3/4 cup instead.  The taste was fine otherwise, and I also used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp b.powder.  They came out nice but I could definitely taste the powder and felt a chalky aftertaste.  I also added vanilla and salt.  I felt the flavor was perfect otherwise.

I followed the suggestions of others, using 1 t of baking powder & 1 t of baking soda.  They had the perfect "perkiness" and did not flatten.  I also added 1/2 t of vanilla & 1/2 t of almond because almond & chocolate go very well together & it's fun to do because nobody can quite put their finger on the flavor (almond).  I was initially concerned about the amount of sugar, along with white chocolate chips, but they were not too sweet.   Because I jumped up & decided to make cookies (watching the food channel gets me up), I practically melted my butter in the microwave since I did not wait for it become room temperature.  It didn't seem to matter.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made these 5 or 6 times.  The flavor is great (as others have said) but for the life of me I can't figure out why mine spread out so much on the cookie sheet.  I have tried using 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter, refrigerating the dough, turning the heat down to 325, and freezing the dough.  I even replaced my baking soda thinking that might be the problem.  They still spread out in the oven end up crispy and flat.  I want to love these, but just isn't happening.

I give these cookies a 3.5 rating! They are a huge hit with the neighbours and my daughters but being a chocoholic ... I am a bit more fussy. They were grainy from the sugar so I will try again and cream the sugars longer to see if it makes a difference. The only other comment is that although they are soft cookies like I enjoy, they are dry. I will try this recipe again with some adjustments.

They were very dry, even when we added 1/4 cup extra butter. They are VERY bitter. We even tried adding melted semi-sweet chocolate and it didn't help at all. Probably will never make these again.

Very very tasty but waaaaayyy to soft, it felt more like a brownie rather than a cookie...and the baking time is defenitely not 9 mins its 12-14 minutes and still come out too soft and chewy almost feeling like a brownie!

I followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious.  The only thing I might change next time is to flatten them a bit before baking so they aren't quite so puffy.  The flavor and texture were great though! Chewy and chocolatey! Thanks!

These are the best chocolate cookies ever!  Super chocolatey.  I added dried cranberries and put a few pecans on top of each one which was delicious.  The kids next door (and my husband) couldn't get enough!

I really enjoyed the flavour of these cookies, but I did have some trouble mixing the dry ingredients into the wet. It made a very thick batter that I ended up mixing with my hands to properly incorporate the white chocolate chips. The texture was a little crumbly straight out of the oven, but I'll have to try them after letting them sit and cool for a few hours to see if that makes a difference. I'll probably try making these again with a modification or two, because overall these are very delicious cookies. Thanks for the recipe Amy!

Only one very big problem:  I could not stop eating these and I totally blew my diet!! SCRUMPTIOUS!!  I did as others suggested and used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder. I used half white chocolate chips, half mini semisweet chips and added some walnuts.  Try this recipe, you will not regret it. I also increased baking time to 12 min.

This is by far the best cookie recipe I'v come across.  My family loved them, my husband just kept saying how good they where. I did make some changes. Like from one of the other viewer, I added pudding and cut down on the flour. And also added milk chocolate chip. This will be a recipe  that I will make over and over.

These cookies are very rich. They came out a little too crumbl/dry for me. I added a little vegetable oil to the last sheetful and it seemed to help moisten them up a bit. I'm somewhat new to baking so I'm not sure what to add (or remove) to remedy the moisture issue I have with them, but I'll work on it. :)

these were delicious! I stuck to the recipe except for the white chocolate chips-I used a bag of peanut butter chips instead.  They turned out really well, but very peanut butter-y.  I think I would prefer them without adding anything-just a simple, rich chocolate cookie.

I consider myself an expert cookie maker-these are AWESOME! Because of the amount of cocoa used, they end up tasting like dark chocolate. They puff up into a perfect little cookie when you roll them into little balls and they stay soft in the middle while chewy on the sides and bottom. I subbed m&ms (all pink) and these were even MORE amazing!

Good but a bit dry.  Will use the recipe again, but will try some tweaks to keep them moister.  They somehow managed to be chewy and dry.  Chewy in the center....dry at the edges.

I just made these and I am so excited! I followed some others advice and used half baking soda and half baking powder. I also used mint chips instead of white. These are so awesome! They are going into my Christmas cookie boxes. Yum!

Turned out wonderfully!  I did what one reviewer suggested and used half baking soda, and half baking powder, and the consistency is great.  Not hard, not too soft, not flat or too puffy.  These taste amazing.  My father who was the first to try them absolutely adored them.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Will be using again soon.

Very easy cookie to make.  I only gave it 4 stars because I would like it a little more chewy rather than crispy.  Flavor is very good though.

AWESOME cookies! My husband just LOVED these because they are like a brownie but a cookie so you get the best of both worlds! Very hard to mess up. I followed a previous review and did 1 tsp of baking powder and 1tsp of baking soda and they turned out perfect, chewy and crispy on the edges. I also refrigerated most and baked those for about 11 min give or take. I bet you could freeze balls of dough and bake for about 15-17 minutes too.

Great cookie!  Will definitely file it away into my recipe book.  I didn't have enough white chocolate, only enough for 1 cup, so I made up the difference with a cup of walnuts.  Was a nice nutty, crunchy addition to the cookie. This made so many cookies (I got 33 LARGE ones out of it) that I'm sending some with my Husband to his work place so that they can enjoy some during their coffee break.

Ohhh yeah, these are pretty fabulous.    I took the advice of some reviewers and fiddled with the amount of baking soda: I used 1 1/2 tsp of soda, and 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I also put in a tsp of vanilla and used salted butter instead of unsalted. But I'm pretty sure this recipe is outstanding as is.     The 8-10 minutes is dead-on correct. Follow the instructions and let the cookies cool on the sheet a good 5-8 minutes before removing them to a wire rack; they need to set before being handled.    These cookies will most definitely be made again! (and again, and again...)

OUTSTANDING COOKIES!  These cookies were easy to make and baked so fast!  I just bought a Kitchenaid mixer today and this was the first thing I made with it.  I was delighted with the stand mixer *y'all probably already have one but it's BRILLIANT* + the cookies.  I only made 1/2 (which I pretty much always do when trying out new recipes) and got 16 cookies.  I used a tablespoon to measure and round them out.  Only 8 minutes in the oven and badabingbadaboom they were done!!!  They tasted like a good quality, chewy, a tiny bit crunchy on top, oreo cookie.  pure DELICIOUSNESS

Very very chocolatey.  They taste like an oreo cookie but a soft version. Delightful with or without chips in them.  I put in peppermint chips in half the dough to experiment and it was a pleasant suprise.

I thought this recipe was okay. I took the suggestion of other reviewers, and I added a teaspoon of baking powder. The first batch I made had an extremely dry dough consistency, and was difficult to scoop and work with. Since I was making them for an event, I made a second batch and altered it by using a half cup less flour. They turned out better than the first batch. The texture of the cookies is a little powdery as well, and you can taste a strong cocoa powder flavor. Make sure you use your favorite cocoa powder since you will taste it. That's probably my favorite part of the cookie.

This recipe is better than the one on the bag of white chocolate chips.  My husband isn't usually a fan of White Chocolate cookies, but he ate alot of these!  I used baking powder instead of soda.  Also, I prefer the Hershey's white chips to the Tollhouse.
Update: Tried making these with only 1 cup cocoa and they turned out softer.  That's how I will make them in the future.

Very good cookies. Easy to make (my 4 year old and 2 1/2 year old kids helped!) We made some with white chocolate chunks, some with chocolate chips, and some with mint chip pieces. They were cooked perfectly at 9 min. in my gas oven. We got about 50 small cookies. All of them were gone in no time! We will make these again. Thank you for the recipe!

This a very easy and quick recipe! It produces excellent, moist yet crumbly cookies. However, I am not a very good cook, due to my previous overuse/ underuse of baking soda, our cookies did not rise :(

Amazing, this made soo many cookies! I halved the recipe and ended up with about 30. If you chop up the chocolate chips a little bit, it makes the cookies more round. Enjoy :) 2/15/10 Use more chocolate powder (1/2 c) it makes the world of difference

The kids went nuts for these, but I found them just to be "meh", and I'm really not sure why... Why wouldn't these be a winner?  Great texture - soft 'n' chewy.  Almost reminiscent of a brownie. Something was "off" with the taste, though - I can't quite figure it out. Used half baking soda and half baking powder, added a tsp of vanilla, and used Reese's pieces instead of white chocolate.  They will get eaten up by the family, but I won't make 'em again.

They were alright cookies.  Good combination of both chocolate and white chocolate, however the cookies were too crumbly and couldn't put them in my husband's lunch without them falling apart.  But they did taste great, I just won't be making these again.

These came out absolutely delicious. I did listen to a couple of the suggestions though and made the following alterations: 1 tsp baking soda AND 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp vanilla extract added and I also used white chocolate CHUNKS instead of chips (from Whole Foods). I think next time I make these, which will be soon!...I'll also cut the amt of flour in half and add pudding mix - my only slight complaint about this recipe is that the cookies were a bit crumbly. The pudding will hopefully fix that in my future batches.

These are really good! I followed the recipe, but reduced sugar by 15g each time and used baking powder instead of soda, like people were suggesting. The result was just yumm yumm! I can't stop eating them now. :) But because I know it's EASY to make, I don't need to worry about finishing them all in a day. Hehe.

We loved these cookies! I used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder. I didn't have any white chocolate chips so I used white chocolate almond bark and broke it into small chunks. They did come out looking gooey but I followed what all the other reviews said and only cooked them for 8 min. They were perfect, Thank you so much for this recipe!

Amazing recipe, a dense, brownie-like cookie that is studded with white chocolate chips.  Fantastic flavor.  I followed the advice of others and did a split of baking powder and baking soda and used less flour (only 1.5 cups).  Will definitely make this again, but I'm gonna need to work off this batch first!!

Wow, these cookies are great! I used the 1 tsp. of Baking Soda and 1 tsp. of Baking Powder and also used about 2 tsp. vanilla and they turned out excellent.  The maximum time was perfect for my cheap gas oven.  These are going into my recipe book for sure! Thanks!

These were delicious cookies.  I made this dough, omitted the white chocolate chips, and instead put a candy cane-flavored Hershey Kiss in the middle of each once they came out of the oven.  They were a great Christmas cookie!

1000 stars for this cookie!  I added 2 pinches of salt, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar.  Eight minutes ONLY and these are the puffiest, softest cookie in the world...like a brownie/cookie.  I divided the batter in 1/3s.  One I left as the recipe, one I added chopped, dried cherries, and one with chopped nuts.  Delicious!

These are great! Changes I made: The batter seemed too dry so I added a tiny splash of chocolate soymilk. I also used some Guittard cappucino chips instead of white chocolate ones - the main reason I wanted a chocolate cookie recipe was to showcase the yummy cappucino chips. I'd definitely make these again.

If you have a serious sweet tooth for chocolate than try this recipe! I like many others did 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda. I tried to cook for 10 min. only and the ookies fell apart and I felt still needed more cooking although my daughter liked it like that. I ended up cooking the second batch for about 15 min and I liked the consistancy much better.

I've made lots of chocolate cookie recipes but this is the one I'll return to next time. They're crisp, sweet and deeply chocolatey! I reduced the sugar to 150g, the brown sugar to 150g and the chocolate chips to 250g and added 1 tsp vanilla essence.

Yummy!  These taste like small bite size brownies!  I did make a few changes and plan on new ones next time I make them.  I used less sugar since white chips are really sweet.  Only 1/2 cup brown and 3/4 white.  I used malted barley flour only.  I cut the butter in half and used flaxmeal instead.  I added a few toasted pecans chopped.  This seemed very dry but tastes great!  Next time I am going to sub some coconut butter for 1/2 the butter as another reviewer mentioned.  That sounds fabulous.  oh, I only used 10oz of white chips and that was almost too many.

This in my opinion is the best cookie recipe ever! well as far as chocolate cookies go. I made mine with all organic ingredients and used white chocolate chunks instead of chips. also I totally agree with using half baking powder and baking soda. My cookies are PERFECT! They're soft and melt in your mouth. Also i split the recipe in half and got exactly 2 dozen cookies out of it. Don't tell but I ate 4 just as soon as they were cool enough, but I am 38 weeks pregnant so I don't feel so bad. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

5 stars on taste, 4 stars for consistency.       Based on other's suggestions, I decreased the white sugar to 3/4 c. and flour to 1 1/2 cups.  Also, I only had 3/4. cocoa, so added 1/8 c chocolate syrup.  I also did 1 t. baking powder, and 1 t. baking soda.  The cookies spread alot, and were pretty thin.  I will try making again with no changes and see what happens.  The taste was unbelievable!

These are soooo good! I used dark chocolate cocoa powder instead of milk and they were awesome. Coworkers loved them. I had comments from people that said they didn't normally like chocolate but loved these cookies! Will make again.

Our first time trying this recipe and we were delightfully surprised with the results.  It's true, the dough was hard to mix.  Yet the cookies are crumbly soft.  Took the advice of previous bakers and added vanilla, half tsp. baking soda and powder. Made these recipes because I was jonesin' for white chocolate chip cookies but didn't need to make three dozens of them, so halved the ingredients and still turned out great.

These are fabulous! I upped the brown sugar to 1 cup and added chocolate chunks and mini chocolate chips. They are very soft when they come out of the oven, but when they cool they are wonderfully chewy!

I was in the mood for something really chocolatey so I used 60% dark chocolate chips instead of white.  There was no way the wet ingredients were going to absorb the dry ingredients, so I ended up adding a little less than a cup of milk.  This resulted in super soft cookies, but they tasted fantastic.  The perfect chocolate fix!!

Very good, but I accidentally put in 2 BAGS of white chips instead of 2 CUPS - so, they are much too sweet now. But I like the texture, I like them flat rather than super puffy. Added salt & vanilla, stuck with the baking soda & let them cool on the cookie sheet. Dough is definitely NOT easy to work with, but the results are a delicious cookie - even with too many chips. ETA: these are so delicious after they have completely cooled - don't judge the flavor or texture if you're tasting it right out of the oven - they are moist, with just the right amount of chocolate - delicious!!

Yum yum yum....I substituted one tsp of baking soda with corn starch, and added some vanilla. Used white chocolate chunks instead of chips. Smooshed the balls down a bit before putting in the oven...these cookies taste delish! A bit crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside.

I thought these would be great, and they were just decent.  It's hard to imagine, but somehow they were both moist and crumbley...they fell apart easily, especially after the first day.  My main complaint is the cocoa (I think!)  Something made these cookies seem very gritty.  Maybe too much cocoa made them gritty and also led them to be crumbley.  It's a good concept, but needs work.  Maybe using melted choc. squares instead of the cocoa might help.  I'll keep looking!

Yummy, yummy!  Rich and chocolately.  My dough was very, very thick and the first batch didn't spread much so I added a bit of milk to loosen the batter and it worked perfectly.  The were gone in 24 hours!

I'm giving these 4 stars because I made a few minor changes and I think that, without the changes, they would've been 4 star worthy.  Changes made - added 1/2 tsp salt (salt brings out the flavour of chocolate), added 1 tsp vanilla, used 1/2 white chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips because that was all I had.  Didn't grease pan.  They spread beautifully and stayed soft and chewy.  Like a brownie with great fudgy flavour.  Yum.

I think this recipe makes pretty darn good cookies! The dough is a bit hard to mix, so that's why I only gave it a four. I substituted one teaspoon of baking soda for baking powder, and the cookies just fluffed up. It made more than 36 cookies, as I had nearly 50 of them. It's a really great recipe and I totally recommend it!;D

So good. Mine did get flat upon cooling, but were still chewy and soft. I used Andes peppermint crunch baking chips for a holiday theme and they are yummy. I added the 1 tsp of salt and vanilla as others suggested. Can't wait to try these with the white chips after the Christmas season!

Good recipe.  I also added one tsp of salt and one tsp of vanilla.  I made the mistake of making the first batch into round balls.  You definitely need the flatten the dough or else they end up looking not done.

Really delicious recipe! I first made a small batch and they all turned out flat. So I decided to just pour the remaining batter into a pan and make brownies. I don't know if it legitimate to call them brownies, but they were to die for! So moist and chewy. They turned out better than the cookies.

I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of salt as recommended by other reviewers and this came out great!

My only problem with these cookies is that it is hard to figure out when they are finished cooking.  I found 10-12 minutes to be more the range instead of the 8-10 listed in the recipe.

These cookies were a bit too chocolaty. Cut back on the cocoa and they should be good.
My younger sister(3) and brother(9) both loved them with a glass of milk.

For me there was a little too much cocoa taste to these. None of the 6  teenagers who were here at the weekend agreed with me. One of my daughters friends actually said they were superb. A bg hit they didn't last until dinnertime when they were meant for dessert. Thanks.

If you are in the mood for chocolate this is what you want. Excellent and easy to make.  Occasionally I cut the white chocolate to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup semi sweet chocloate chips.  Also very good.

These were great, the best of both worlds.  I bet these would be good with peanut butter or butterscotch chips.

I made these last night and my family loved them. They are almost brownie like. This is a recipe I will make over and over. Thanks.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and dropped the amount of butter.  I also added some dessicated coconut and almond meal.  They turned out quite nice.  I haven't tested them on my work colleagues yet, but from my own taste test, I think they'll be a winner!

These came out really well. They had a very chocolate taste, and the white chocolate chips were a nice break to the chocolate.

Ran out of white chocolate so I used peanut butter chips.  Not sure if it was me, or the recipe, but the cookies weren't the best and didn't flatten out enough so I ended up with piles.

I baked it last night and it turned out fabs! I added 1 tsp of vanilla, reduce the white choc chips to 1 cup, and add 1 cup of macadamia nuts. I love them! I specifically make it only 10 min, as the recipe stated that it will be puffy but soft, and actually it went well. I wonder what will happen if I make it 13-15 min though. Once I put them to cool, they just got tougher and firmer, so perhaps 10 min is the correct time. 

Anyway, I made it for the party tomorrow night, so if the cookies still good by tomorrow night, I will add more comments on this cookies (re: the review that this cookie is bad after being left for one night).

Didn't love these.  They definitely weren't very good the second day.  The white chocolate chips are just too sweet and... I don't know.  I did replace 1/2 the butter with 1/2 the shortening (so the cookies weren't flat).  I would try replacing 1/4 the butter with shortening if I made these again.  I make a similar recipe with peanut butter chips and I love those.

I really loved this recipe!  It was simple and quick to make.  I changed the chips, however, and added peanut butter and chocolate chips to better fit my families tastes.  I thought that knocked the recipe up a notch.

These are delicious ... but there's a similar recipe on this site that I prefer.  I actually liked these better after they had cooled - definately need to bake longer (I did mine 13 min), and I also subbed some sweetened cocoa as well.

I have to admit that at first I was very skeptical.  I didn't have any unsalted butter so I just used regular butter.  After trying the dough it didn't taste very good.  I dropped them onto my cookie sheet and they did not form at all.  Up until maybe the last 2 minutes of cooking did they turn from balls into cookies (I had to cook them for 13 minutes).  I had some trouble getting them off my cookie sheet (I did grease them) but other than that they were delicious.  My 2 year old daughter just devoured them!

I didn't have enough cocoa to make a whole batch so I had to half it.  It still worked!  These cookies are great!  The dough in itself is exceptional.

One of the best cookies we've ever had. We had some friends over for dinner and they thought so too. I like to make big cookies so I made 16 cookies from this recipe and baked them one a big cookie sheet for 15 minutes.

These are the BEST cookies.  I sifted the dry ingredients, which I don't normally do but other than that, the recipe is perfect!
