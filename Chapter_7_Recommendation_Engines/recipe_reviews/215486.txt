My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe. It's one of the best breads we've ever made. We actually halved the recipe to get one loaf. Also, lemon extract can be substituted with lemon juice (rule of thumb is 3x amount of extract called for, i.e. 3 teaspoons of lemon juice for 1 teaspoon of lemon extract). The dusted sugar on the pan gives a nice crisp, but sweet outside, while the zucchini makes the inside super moist!

This bread is very moist.  I didn't have lemon extract so I used fresh lemon juice.  I glazed the top with a thin lemon/powdered sugar glaze.  Very tasty!

This was a huge hit! 
I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour, substituted applesauce for vegetable oil, threw in a grated carrot along with the zucchini and reduced the sugar by 1/4 of a cup. I also used the juice of 1 lemon and grated some lemon zest into the batter.
I cut it into slices and when I went to get more to put it onto a platter for a little social gathering, I noticed it was all gone! Great recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

My family loved this recipe.  Since it makes two loafs I made one true to recipe and to the second I added 1 cup of glazed cherries.

In reference to the comment about the recipe. Read further, the 1 tsp of sugar is for dusting the pan, the flour amount is later in the recipe. I think the recipe is written accurately. Can't rate yet, will be making this evening!

Eh this was just okay.  Needs to be more moist.  Applesauce and a little oil may do the trick

The zucchini makes this very moist. I used REAL lemon instead of the flavoring. Mild lemon taste by using about 2 TBSP of lemon. Instead of bread pans, I used my Pampered Chef muffin pans. Wonderful! Don't forget to sprinkle muffin molds with sugar! Good recipe.

Excellent bread with strong lemon flavor!  I used 1 cup brown sugar with 1/2 cup white sugar and fresh lemon juice instead of extract.  Loved the sugar finish on the loaves.  Next time will substitute most/all oil with applesauce to lighten it up a bit.  My kids loved it - definitely a keeper!

Yum! I halved the recipe and made muffins instead of a loaf. I doubled the amount of lemon zest to make sure they had a nice pop of lemon flavor. They ended up super lemony and delicious. Really moist and flavorful. Thanks! :)

I tried this recipe as I had a few zucchini in the refrigerator and it sounded interesting. My husband and I loved the lemony taste of this moist bread.  This recipe is a keeper.

I never review a recipe-just something I don't seem to do but I had to rate this one.  I tried it last year when the zucchini was in and made enough to last the winter.  Zucchini are back and it is time to do it again.  THE VERY BEST ZUCCHINI BREAD EVER.  The recipe is perfect as is. Can't wait for it to come out of the oven.

Loved this! I was over the standard chocolate chip zucchini bread, this will be my new go-to recipe. I made a simple lemon glaze and put it on while the bread was still warm. It's practically cake, in fact we had some for my brother's birthday yesterday. So yummy.

This was highly appreciated by my guys.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I added 3/4 c. raisins and 3/4 c. chopped walnuts, because my buddy asked me to.  I did not have lemon extract, so I used the juice from the lemon I zested.  The lemon flavor was perfect, not too strong or too weak.  It complemented the zucchini perfectly.  The batter was so thick I thought I had accidentally put too much flour in, but it came out lovely. moist and yummy.   I didn't have 2 loaf pans, so I made  18 cupcakes and a loaf.  Alghough they only lasted a day and a half at my house, the bread stayed very moist.  Thanks for a great recipe, Ellen.

Very very good. It is an easy recipe to throw some nuts in or even some chocolate chips.  But it is great the way it is.  At first the batter concerned me as it is thick but the moisture from the zucchini fixed that.

My son gave it 9 out of ten, so I chose four stars, but I guess you can say they thought it was 4.5. I did not use as much salt as it said, and wished I'd used a tad less, but it was good, and my kids gobbled it up. I did not tell them about the zuc. in it :o)

Made this in a camp Dutch oven last weekend (1st time) for a Stone Tool Expo demonstration and got rave reviews from total strangers!  Didn't get to try it myself, but won't make that mistake agin.
  Didn't have a lemon handy so used 2 tsp. of lemon extract.  
Will definitely make again!

Amazing! I used lemon juice instead of extract and subbed a cup of butter for the cup of oil and it turned out fantastic! Will definitely be making this again.

Loved the flavor but way too oily - would definitely reduce the oil next time around. I squeezed the water out of the shredded zucchini and added extra lemon extract to enhance lemony flavor.

I used one lemon for zest and most of the juice for the bread and the rest of the juice for a glaze for over the top. Excellent tasting. Thanks Ellen.

This is definitely going into the book!  Took this into work yesterday and the recipe was handed out 3 times already.  The only thing I added was more lemon zest, the juice of the lemon and 1/2 cup sour cream (which goes into every quick bread I make).  By far one of the best loaves to use up the excess zucchini from summer...Thank you, Ellen!
Just a thought....chopped cherries, or cranberries...would look pretty good on the christmas platter:)

My new favorite zucchini bread.  This is so good, very moist and fragrant lemon smell.  I used zucchini from our garden and Meyer Lemon from our tree.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time may cut back on the oil and use some applesauce.   Will make this again around Thanksgiving with shredded zucchini that I freeze.  Thanks for a great recipe, most delicious.

I made this yesterday and made some tweaks. It came out perfectly and I'm a serious baker.  I used 1/2c canola oil and 1/2 c applesauce. I added 2 tsp cinnamon, increased vanilla to 2tsp, used 3T lemon juice instead of extract, 2 lemons zested, and 2 c regular flour and 1c white whole wheat flour. I used 3c shredded zucchini instead of 2. Best bread I've made so far.

I made muffins with this recipe using fresh yellow zucchini from the garden. Unbelievably good. Don't think many will make it to the freezer...

Very good.  I did not have lemon extract, so just used 2 tbs of fresh lemon juice.  Yum!

This is the best zucchini bread yet. I make a lot of zucchini bread during the summer when we’re getting over run with zucchini. I freeze most of it. This freezes very well. It has a little bit of a crust to it which holds up after freezing. I’ve added this to my list of breads to make when we have a ton of zucchini to get rid of. Love it!  Thanks!

This one is a keeper !  The changes I made were to use half the oil and the rest applesauce, no extract (I don't like extracts) added juice from zested lemon.   Also I used 1 cup strawberry jelly in place of  one cup sugar.  Adding jello lemon pudding made this rise nicely.  Baked in a big rectangle baking dish and will spread cream cheese frosting over top.
Be sure to keep an eye on this towards end of baking, it may take less time.

Favorite zucchini bread recipe ever. The lemon adds a sort of sweet note and I love it.

I've tried countless zucchini breads and this is one of the best.  I only made one loaf using 2 eggs.  Be sure to use lemon extract and not lemon juice for the ultimate lemon flavor.  I also drizzled it with an icing of confectioner's sugar and lemon juice.   It's a keeper!

Delicious but bland if you try to eat it the same day as baking. Wrap tightly, store a couple of days in the fridge. Enjoy!

It came out perfect.  Everyone loves it.  The only thing I did different was that I used fresh lemon juice instead of the extract.

It was  very very good.  I did have to tweak it though, I added apple sauce to loosen the batter it was too thick.  Worked perfectly.  Moist and delicious .

Very moist and delicious!  I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil, used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat and used the juice of the lemon rather than the lemon extract.

I made this and it is awesome!  I did not have any fresh lemon zest, but I had some dried lemon peel and it worked quite nicely.  I also used whole wheat flour.  I considered subbing in some oatmeal but but the time I remembered that, I had already measured the flour.  The batter is very, very thick before adding the zucchini, almost like a cookie dough.  The liquid in the zucchini, however loosens it some, so adding it to the pans is no problem.

I got lots of compliments on this bread with a few changes.  I used all whole wheat flour with great results. I used Truvia Baking Blend to replace all sugar.  In place of all the oil, I used 1.4 cup oil and 3.4 cup unsweetened applesauce. Will make many more times!

This bread is delicious! I subbed half of the oil for cinnamon applesauce. I also used the zest and juice of one whole lemon for added flavor. I subbed the flour for a gluten-free blend, and it still turned out beautifully! I was initially just looking for a way to use up zucchini, but I ended up finding a wonderful recipe that I would definitely make again in the future! Thanks for sharing :)

Very good! I made mine in small loaf pans. The sugar sprinkled in pan before baking was a nice touch. Was like a sugar glaze around sides.
