I made this for Easter Dinner and it turned out picture perfect.  It looked impressive and really was pretty easy to whip up.

I made this for Easter dinner as well. I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was an impressive dish not only in flavor but in presentation. The strawberry sauce was perfect; sweet, sour, salty, spicy and fresh. Delicious.The thing that I did differently was I coated the lamb chops in a potato chip crust which turned out fabulous. So good and I recommend 100%.

This was my first time making a rack of lamb! Honestly, i was a bit intimated by its “fanciness”. Turns out it isn’t not that difficult and this recipe was amazing! Definitely making again.

The strawberry sauce was excellent, made mine with Meyer lemons which was a good choice, served with rosemary roasted potatoes and cucumber salad.  The only thing I would say is that I prefer my rack of lamb to be cut apart and broiled... I love the crispy fat with this method, and it was lacking when the rack was cooked intact, but this is just a personal preference.  The flavors were wonderful together and the hint of cayenne made it interesting.
