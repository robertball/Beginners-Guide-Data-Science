I accidently bought frozen Pillsbury Pastry dough and oh my what a good mistake! It was like a fluffy fruit paradise! I tossed my fruit in 1 tsp cinnamon along with the sugar. To.Die.For.

I was so impressed by how easy, beauitful, yet sophisticated this dessert was. I made it for my mom's birthday & we all loved it. However, this recipe should have been a bit more precise on its ingredients & how much you should really put in. I probably put in too many strawberries, because the juice from the strawberries actually LEAKED through my galette & punched out too holes. I'm sure the flour would have done the trick to soak up some juice, so make sure you have a good ratio of fruits & flour/sugar.  Also, I added a little touch to the galette ends after looking at some other galette recipes. After folding the ends over, I brushed some egg all around the ends so that it could give that it could catch the sugar nicely & have that nice, golden brown, crunchy crust.  I suggest others to try out different things as well. This recipe is so versatile! Before adding the fruit toppings, I spread a thin coat of nutella (for a little surprise!) & on the other galette, some blackberry preserves (i wish i had orange marmalade...) Many original galette recipes call for this almond pastry called, frangipane of which you blend a mixture of almonds, sugar, & butter to create an almond paste. This almond paste makes a VERY scrumptious spread underneath the fruit filling. I'm definitely going to try that next time :)

Love this... so delish. And it's not too bad for you, especially if you cut back a touch on the sugar.  I brush melted peach marmalade (mixed with a bit of water) over it to "gloss" it up and enhance the presentation. Yummy!

I only made one of these, and I used mostly peaches, with a few blueberries in the center.  Since my peaches were very ripe and juicy, I added a little extra flour for more thickening power.  I took another reviewer's advice and brushed the crust with egg yolk before sprinkling on the turbinado sugar.  Not only did this help the sugar stick, it made a nice golden crust.  This was a wonderful dessert with a real "Wow" factor, and our guest said it looked like something that would be served in a restaurant.  I'm happy to have discovered a recipe for something that's so easy to make but impressive at the same time.

Excellent and well received but needs 3T flour per tart, sprinkle of flour on parchment paper, and bake 20+ min til well browned so crust is browned on bottom. Also, egg white wash b/f filling and egg wash b/f t sugar

This is the first rating and review for this recipe. This was very good and very easy!This recipe makes 2 Galettes,one is strawberry/blueberry and one is peach/blueberry.I don't suggest making the peach unless you can find really soft peaches.Next time I'll just make 2 strawberry/blueberry ones.I didn't have ice cream to serve with it,but as stated in the recipe, it would of gone perfectly with this dessert.I will definitely make this again!Thank you Shannonlolly for this tasty dessert!

This is so easy, and tastes good, too!  I made just the peach and blueberry galette, and baked it on a baking stone for 15 mins.  This is a quick and impressive dessert that I will make again!

I made just one, as didn't have enough fruit for 2.  My 3 peaches came to about 3 cups.  I didn't have blueberries, so substituted 1/2 cup of frozen berry mix of raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and used Wondra instead of all purpose flour.  Tasted great with store bought roll out pie crust.

A feast for the eye and the taste buds! After making my first galette with fresh mixed berries, I got creative as this is such a flexible recipe. Some delicious combinations that had my guests raving included: Nutella and pears, vanilla custard and peaches with peach jam glaze, and mixed berries with lemon marmalade glaze. Be creative, but keep in mind what other reviewers have noted, too much fruit and it will leak. I also used the egg wash to make the pastry brown up nicely. Definitely a new favorite easy-peasy recipe that makes it look like I slaved for hours.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was easy, went together quickly, with a short bake-time!  I would not use strawberries again in this, I think baking them is such a waste of fresh berries!  Also, we used less than half the sugar called for and found it to be sweet enough.  Looked very pretty and will serve with ice cream next time!

This recipe is the perfect platform for fresh summer fruit.  We loved it.  I used the “Flaky Food Processor Pie Crust” on this site, making this effortless and quick.  It makes a beautiful rustic dessert that is delicious.

really good, really easy! I have made galettes before with my own crust, which is good, but much more time consuming. I like that I can do this in 15 minutes and it tastes like I worked for 2 hours!

They were out of pie crusts at the store so we bought puff pastry instead...I can't imagine this without the puff pastry!  I used both sheets and cut them each in half to make 4 total.  It was amazing and super easy.  Perfect summer dessert!  I would say that the turbinado sugar wasn't that necessary.  It didn't take away from the taste, but I didn't notice it either.  Overall Great recipe!

This is so easy and good. Recipe makes two full-sized galettes so unless you have a crowd only make one and half everything and omit one fruit. We enjoyed the nectarines and blueberries one best. I made it again using fresh summer bing cherries, halved and pitted marinated in amaretto liquor but it was disappointing. However every time I used an egg-white wash brushed on top and sides and I add sliced almonds to fruit mix and all over crust. Yummy good. Also after you do the pinch pleats gently hold your hands over top to tighten the hold of folds on crust it comes out prettier and holds all together without bursting open. Next time a bit of almond extract added to fruits.

This was a tasty, easy recipe. We overfilled ours, which made it difficult to handle. I would be careful with how much fruit you put into the middle. I also might add some oats to the filling next time in an attempt to make it hold together better.

This was very good.  I used fresh peaches and fresh cherries, and just a couple of tablespoons of sugar.  I didn't let the peaches sit in the sugar too long, since you don't want too much juice in this recipe.  My seven year old daughter ate it up!

Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it.   I thought there would be a fight over the leftovers!  I'm finding that it takes up to 24 minutes for the crust to brown and the syrup to set up well.  Have made this several times now and it is consistently a pleaser.   Don't be afraid to try different fruit mixtures, but peaches and blueberries are hard to beat!

I have made this 4x now. The first time I did the egg wash which was good, but I hate throwing away most of the egg. I also brushed it with coconut oil and I liked it. I have also just used nothing and sprinkled sugar on the crust albeit some of it falls off. This recipe is great because it assembles quick and is healthier than fruit pie. Fantastic way to enjoy summer fruit. I cook mine at 400 for 20-25 minutes. It's important to add the full amount of sugar and if the fruit is at all tart, maybe even a little more. I tried skimping on the sugar in the past and it came out tart.

This was really good and pretty easy.  The only thing I'd say is that 15 min. is a little optimistic for prep time.  It took that long to peel, core and slice the apples.  Then another 10 to prep the strawberries.  

I also used an egg wash before sprinkling the sugar on so it would come out with a golden, crispy crust.  Enjoy!

This was delicious and super easy!  I had one pie crust left over, and didn't feel like making a full pie, so when I came across this recipe, I was enthralled!  I halved the fruit easily, but needed a little more time for it to bake since most of the fruit was frozen, and added about 10 extra minutes to my fresh pluot, and frozen blueberry & strawberry filling.  Gorgeous presentation, and a total snap to prep.  Thanks!

Good, but it's even better with homemade crust or martha stewart's pate sucree.  I like to use apples and mix in cinnamon and nutmeg as well.  also, 400 for about 30 min will take away any doughiness.  Needs longer if you use apples to get them softened.

Delicious.  I actually used some leftover puff pastry I had instead of pie crust. It was very easy and very good, especially with a little vanilla FroYo.

Great, easy dessert! I found that it was a bit tart (I used fresh cherries, blueberries and peaches.)  Def. plan to add more sugar and a marmalade coating on the crust next time :)

This was a huge hit at my dinner party.  I made it with just fresh peaches and fresh blueberries.  The next day I made it with canned peaches and frozen blueberries,  included some of the peach juice and an extra tablespoon of flour.  Also, I made an egg wash for the crust and dusted it with sugar before putting it in the oven.  Served it with whip cream and ice cream.  I will be making this again for sure!

I have a freezer full of fresh frozen fruit. Made one of these with a refrigerator crust, frozen blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. Used 3 Tb of flour per another review, 2 Tb sugar. Glazed with milk and sugar.  We loved this (husband on 2nd helping as I write). It did take about 20 min to bake.

I've admired the elegant look of galettes for years but never tried to make one.  So easy and delicious!! And, nice to make a small dessert so there aren't leftovers to tempt me the next morning.  I found that the one with more strawberries was a bit too runny, so I think I'll omit the strawberries next time.  And, for mine it took 18 minutes before the crust browned enough. Thanks for sharing - I will definitely do this often, experimenting with other fruits.

This was amazing! It was so fresh and light. I also recommend making the strawberry blueberry for both instead of one peach blueberry and one strawberry blueberry. The strawberry blueberry was amazing and was the first to be gone!!Will def be making this again.

The fruit filling with flour/sugar mixture is good but I was hoping for a good pie dough recipe? I made my regular one and well, perhaps I didn't roll it thin enough because during baking my plates unraveled. It was still delicious though ;)

super easy, super delicious!  I made my own pastry instead of the store bought, think it made it even better!  Served this to our potluck group and it was a hit!
I added some blackberries to the strawberry mix and I used cocoanut sugar instead of turbinado sugar and cut it back to 1 1/2 tablespoons per pie.

I did not use quite as much fruit did not want the crust to crack and lose the fruit juices. Added an extra tablespoon of sugar to the fruit as I had added some lemon to the peaches and blueberries. Made the Flaky Pie Crust recipe which worked out very well. Also cooked the pie for about 25 minutes, till fruit bubbled and crust was brown. Also used egg yoke and cream to brush the crust and sprinkled dark brown sugar on the fruit and crust. YUM.....great summer dessert.

I used a Trader Joe’ s pie crust, which was great & flaky.  I included rhubarb, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries & powdered stevia for sweetener. It was delicious, I enjoy more fruit & less crust for my dessert. Will make it again with other fruit choices.

the bake time is way off. Minimum of 30 minutes required. Keep checking. Don't overcook as the crust will crumble when you cut it.

I love this!  I had a peck of fresh peaches and had to try some new recipes so I could use them up.  The galette is great.  I used fresh peaches and mangos and it turned out fabulous!

Super easy.  So I made it again for friends 2 weeks later.  The second time I improvised with frozen fruit.  Got a little soupy so my proportions were off, but still Delish!  Great with French vanilla ice cream!

Perfect, simple, delish.  Recipe is easy to scale, to vary the fruits used, to prepare individual gallettes or large ones as noted. It's a basic that should be in each of our Favorites file.

It was super easy to make, especially since I had pastry for a 9"in pie crust in the fridge leftover from another recipe.  Just rolled it out, put it in a pan and added fruit , flour & sugar.   Nice finish to summer meal :)

Used Pillsbury pastry frozen dough, thawed.  After folding the ends over & fluting, I brushed some egg all around the ends so that it could give that it could catch the sugar nicely & have that nice, golden brown, crunch.  Many original galette recipes call for this almond pastry called, frangipane of which you blend a mixture of almonds, sugar, & butter to create an almond paste. This almond paste makes a VERY scrumptious spread underneath the fruit filling.   I brush melted peach marmalade (mixed with a bit of water) over it to "gloss" it up.  Since my peaches & strawberries  were very ripe & juicy, I added a little extra flour for more thickening power. Will also try nectarines next time.

I halved this recipe and it's perfect for just my husband and I.  Only had peaches and blueberries but that combo is wonderful!  Left out the turbinado sugar as I had none, but we still thought it was great.  This recipe is simple, quick, and oh so good!

It is very good. I would add more or less sugar to the fruits depending on how sweet they are. I sprinkled a combination of brown sugar and cinnamon on the edges. I also splashed some vanilla to the fruit mix and added a pinch of cinnamon too. It was very good. A scoop of vanilla ice cream would be the cherry on top of this dessert!
