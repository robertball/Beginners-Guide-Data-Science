Too bad I can't give a 5+ rating!!!!!
Will use this marinade for other meats or even stir fries as it has all the 'asian/chinese' tastes I'd usually be looking for. 
Might have used more ginger than called for (I love ginger!), so that flavor really stood out, but without being overpowering.
Also, marinating for just over 24 hrs was, for me, a big plus. Yummy, yummy, yum!

Absolutely delightful! I was out of Hoisin sauce and decided to substitute Teriyaki with some Fish Sauce added in. Marinated overnight.  Baked for 35 minutes (tenderloins were quite thick), wrapped in foil and let sit on the counter for what turned out to be about 45 min. due to interruptions. When sliced, was perfect, juicy, still warm and tender.  What I think I like best is the delicate nature of the flavours. I thought it would be quite strong looking at the list of ingredients.  However nothing overpowered the other. On the repeat list, thanks Jennifer!

I'm giving it 5 stars because it's a great launching point for Chinese cooking and because I like to search for recipes using the rating system, and this one is worth taking a look at.  I brought this dish to my company Christmas potluck and I got rave reviews.  It was really easy to make in quantity (I made 3 tenderloins, about 4.5 lbs.)

I modified this recipe, and for those who don't cook Chinese style very often it might seem like I made a lot of modifications.  I like to cook using whatever I have in the pantry and Chinese cooking is really forgiving.

First of all I didn't measure any ingredients, I just poured and everything together by estimation.
I marinated my pork tenderloins for 24 hrs in the fridge in hoisin sauce, five spice, chinese cooking wine (not sherry), fish sauce (not soy sauce because I like how the flavors blend), I used Shezuan black bean sauce since the recipe didn't specify, and brown sugar ( forgot to add the sesame oil.)  The next day I preheated the oven, minced the ginger, moved the tenderloins from the marinade to a baking pan, sprinkled the ginger on top and baked at 350 for 50 minutes.  

It came out fantastic.  Everyone enjoyed it and I got a lot of comments about how tender it was.  It was great because it required very little prep.  A tasty dish with very little effort.  I think if you stuck to the recipe it would be good, but like other reviewers either use less ginger or add it in after it marinades like I did.  i baked it for 50 minutes

Very nice combination of flavors.  Halved the recipe and marinated 1 tenderloin for 2 days.  Took longer than stated, about 40 minutes total.  Served with a bagged thai noodle dish and steamed asparagus.

I used the sauce to marinate pieces of pork for a couple of hours and then used it in a stir fry. The black bean sauce helps balance the sweetness of the hoisin sauce. A good combination of flavors.

Absolutely Awesome! We love this. I will usually sear it on the grill for that crispy exterior and smokey flavor and then finish it up in the oven.

Yes! No bottled teriyaki sauce! Noticing this was already a big plus for this recipe. Instead, there is an interesting blend of seasonings and spices. It sounded interesting, different from most Asian-inspired pork tenderloin recipes and it proved itself.  This was delicious.

I followed original measurements except added extra ginger and garlic.  Marinated 5 hours, baked uncovered for 1 hour at 375.  Very tender.  I thought the dish would be 'heavier,' but the tastes were very light.  Delicious.  Had 1/4-1/2 a cup of (used) marinade but it didn't cook-up well for me.  There was barely any drippings in the baking dish so next time I'll make extra marinade, set aside, then cook to use as a sauce over the pork and rice.

This is a brilliant marinade - I marinated two fillets - cooked one and froze the other.  Even my husband, who is hard to please really enjoyed the meal.

This smells out of this world. Insane. I started marinading the pork last night in quadruple the sauce. Sesame oil tends to overpower dishes if overused, so I cut it back and I added a bit more Chinese Five Spice. I haven't cooked it yet, but just based on smell/ease of cooking....it's a five star recipe already. And BTW, you don't need to go to an asian store to find these ingredients. You can find them at most grocery stores. I found mine at Fred Meyer/Kroger.

Left out the black bean sauce; marinaded for two days. Increased the brown sugar a tad and used regular soy sauce. Also just used pureed garlic and ginger. Easy to prepare and tasty but there are other pork tenderloin recipes that I like better and will remain loyal to them. Husband and kids really liked it.

Pretty good, I would have liked it to be more flavorful, but the meat was VERY tender and my family did enjoy, though personally I don't think I'll be making this again.

This was wonderful. It was easy to prepare and made the entire house smell great!!! I didn't have fresh ginger so I used dried and I didn't have the black bean sauce so I omitted that. I can not wait to make the egg rolls from this website using the leftovers!!!

This pork was wonderful.  I increased the brown sugar and garlic and eliminated the five-spice.  I let the pork marinade in a freezer bag for two days as another reviewer suggested.    I baked it and allowed it to cool.  Then I used it in the "Authentic Chinese Egg Rolls" recipe also available through this web site.  The pork was wonderful!  My kids kept eating it while I was slicing it for the egg rolls.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great marinade.  If using in pork fried rice or eggrolls, be sure to really trim your meat.  It took forever to trim the fat off the pork after it was cooked when cutting into matchbook size strips.  Also, I didn't have any sherry, so I used vinegar & marinated for about 30 hours.  Takes authentic!  :)

This recipe was not what I was looking for, but turned out better than what I had wanted.  Like another reviewer, I too went heavy on the ginger.  I didn't have any sherry, so I used lemon juice and left out the 5 spice seasoning.  I'll make this again!!

Thank you, Jennifer72_00, for a winning Chinese marinade! My husband had a craving for grilled Chinese pork steaks and lo mein. At first he was disappointed that I didn't buy the package stuff that turns the meat red, like a Chinese take-out serves, but he quickly turned to all smiles when he exclaimed that my pork steaks were the best he had ever had! I made your recipe as written and marinated two pork steaks instead of tenderloins and it was delicious!

Excellent pork recipe!  Very tasty!  The combination of soya sauce, hoisin sauce, Chinese 5-spice, etc. is excellent and very tasty!  May I suggest that you serve this excellent dish with rice (lemon-spiced) and a side-dish of stir-fried veggies (e.g. green and red peppers and red onions in an Asian sauce).  An absolute winner!  I will definitely make this tasty pork dish again!

the pork turned out delicious - w/about 6hrs of marinating. very tender,juicy & flavorful, & i really didn't change a thing. the biggest problem w/this is my lack of planning to allow for the marinating, so plan ahead, it's worth it.

Excellent! I marinated the meat in a sealed plastic bag for 6 hours and then baked the tenderloin in a foil lined glass dish for 30 minutes, letting the meat sit before slicing. The pork was so moist and tender. The marinade, which formed a thin glaze on baking,imparted a delicious oriental flavor. I served it with my home version of fried rice. No leftovers! I'll definitely be making this recipe again. Oh, and did I say that it was so simple to make and there was no cleanup!

5++ Stars. For 3# of pork, I multiplied the sauce ingredients x 5. I didn't have sherry which I don't like anyway, so I substituted champagne - yum. Instead of black bean sauce, I mashed black beans. I also used 1 tsp ginger spice instead of fresh. Do NOT use substitutes for the sesame oil - it has a truly unique flavor! I added garlic and pepper. This was SO GOOD!! I cut my pork in thin strips, then seared strips of pepper & onions along with broccoli heads & mushrooms for just 1-2 mins. Served on rice noodles. My family just loved it. I will keep this sauce to use on other things - it's just great. Thank you SO much for sharing this, Jennifer!!!

Easy tasty recipe. I roasted to 140,  put in foil, covered with about 1/2 cup of the additional sauce I made, and wrapped it tight for 30 minutes. Very moist.

I love this recipe! The first time I made it, I served it with rice noodles and oyster sauce and some steamed bok choi. This time, I let it marinate for two days and then sliced it thinly and made banh mi sandwiches. This recipe will be used regularly in my kitchen for years to come.

This was awesome!  Nice flavours, very tender pork!  I marinated for 2 1/2 hours but will leave it longer next time.  The only thing I changed~~I didn't have any sherry so I substituted rice wine vinegar.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great flavor and very tender.  I substituted fish sauce for sherry and marinated the loin overnight.  After cooking/resting the meat I cubed half to add into fried rice and sliced the remainder to eat on the side.  This was a crowd pleaser at our house.

This was tasty and easy. I didn't have sherry, so I used sherry vinegar. I left out the black beans-no asian stores near me :( I cut the tenderloin into "matchsticks" to use with the Authentic Chinese Egg Roll recipe on this site. Delicious!

It was really good. I only had time to marinate it for 30 minutes but the flavors were still very nice. I substituted orange juice for the sherry and halved the sesame oil.

My family loved this recipe. The only change I made was  adding black bean sauce with garlic already in it. I omitted the garlic step since I did this.  I also marinated it for two days. It came out awesome with lots of flavor.

Followed exact for ingredients, marinated for approx. 8 hours and cooked it on outside grill. I had total of about 4 .25 lbs for two pieces. Cooked about 45 minutes on a 350 degrees. I checked to be sure was cooked thru, came out medium. My only suggestion would be to at least double the amount of ingredients to have plenty as a graveyard. This is where all the flavor is and it would be a little dry for my taste without it. Great Asian taste. Served with Chinese green beans and jasmine rice. A keeper!

Very easy and flavorful.  At an hour I checked it and it was still quite pink in the middle.  I prefer to cook pork longer so gave it another 10 minutes and it was perfect for my taste.  Good recipe!

Delicious!!  I was lazy and used ground ginger and garlic powder instead of fresh, marinated the tenderloins for about 2 hours and grilled on medium heat.  Perfect flavor and such a great char!  Thanks for a great recipe!

cooked pork to 135 degrees, was tender and delicious.  Served with Chinese greens, mushrooms sautéed with a chili/garlic sauce, and rice.  Was like a deconstructed chinese pork stir fry but nicer presentation for company. Will make again.

4.26.18  Marinated the tenderloin 24 hours, and I expected more flavor when I sat down to dinner last night.  It certainly is an easy weeknight entree if you can get the pork marinating early in the day or the evening before.  I didn't deviate from the recipe instructions, it cooked for about 25 minutes until it reached 145ºF (that's where we like our pork),  and I then tented it for about 10 minutes.  I’ve been cooking a fair number of Asian dishes recently, and although this was tender and juicy, the flavor just didn’t pop for me.  Not bad, but just not really good either.  I would give it a 3-star rating, but my husband liked it and rated it 4 stars, so I’m going with his rating at 4 stars.  This has had great reviews, so I'm gonna try this one again, maybe some different side dishes will help.

I made the recipe as written except I used Chinese wine instead of sherry.  It turned out very well.  I used it cubed in fried rice and sliced in a Chinese noodle soup.  This would also be good with Chinese hot mustard on an appetizer tray.

I marinated this for 24 hours then roasted as directed. After about 20 minutes, the liquid in the pan was totally dried up & burning. So I added 1/2 c. of water to the pan to keep it from totally drying out. The pork came out tender but the flavor was just ok/nothing special. I expected it to taste like the roast pork strip served in some Asian restaurants but it was not even close. Will not make again.

This was a great tasting quick meal.  I had the minimum time for marination, but the tastes still came through.  Face it, you are not marinating Pork tenderloin to make it tender, you are marinating for flavor and even with just a couple of hours, there was plenty of flavor.  I followed the recipe's ingredients exactly except that I only cooked one tenderloin because it was just for two of us.  Reduced the leftover marinade and served it over the sliced tenderloin.  Complete the meal with an Asian vegetable and noodle stir fry and oven baked wonton strips.

We were disappointed because we thought there would be more flavor.  It was very mild. I couldn't find black bean sauce & asked the manager of the Oriental Deli in our grocery store what I could use to substitute or should I leave out. He said to leave out since it was such a small amount. I even asked about using the liquid in a can of black beans. We'd have to add more five-spice for sure but hubs said to just delete because we have many other excellent tenderloin recipes from here.

I will make this again.  It's so easy and the leftovers are Wonderful.  Didn't have Black bean paste so put in Gochugang paste,  it gave it a little pep.  planning on making summer rolls with the leftovers. Made Bibimbap for breakfast,  delicious.

I used this recipe a little differently than called for. I sliced up the pork into bite sized pieces and put it into the marinade for 24 hours. When it was time to cook, I drained the pork, reserving the marinade. I chopped up a variety of vegetables, and stir fried them with the pork. I added the marinade toward the end of cooking to create a sauce, and when everything was cooked through, I tossed in cooked udon noodles. Delicious! #HealthyWinterDinner

I didn't have sherry, so used red wine.  Wonderful flavor and SO tender.  The guys just kept eating it.  Will definitely make it again. Because of a scheduling problem, my dinner got postponed after I had put the marinade on the meat. It marinated about 2 days, but that didn't seem to hurt it at all. Wonderful aroma of 5-spice powder while cooking.

We loved this dish.  I could not find the black bean paste in any store in my town so I substituted 1/2 TBL Oyster sauce.  Since I don't know what black bean paste tastes like, I can't tell what difference my substitution made.  Will look for the paste when I can get to a bigger city with more options and try that.  This was delicious.  I'm rating it 4 stars since I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  But, it was yummy the way we fixed it anyway.

This was, by far, the best pork tenderloin I have ever tasted. Since I had no sherry, I substituted Rice Vinegar. The only ingredient I couldn't find at HEB was Chinese Five Spice Powder. Fortunately, I found it at a small Asian market close by.

Delicious!!! I loved the marinate. I couldn't find the black bean sauce but it turned super nice anyway... also, in my oven it took 45 minutes at 400F.

I have been making this recipe for years; I still have the tattered page that I pulled out of Canadian Living magazine.  The longer it marinates, the better.  I generally put more garlic in than listed, and a bit less ginger. The 5-spice mix is hardly a deal breaker if you don't have it on hand.  I've never thought to use it for other meats, but there's no reason why you couldn't.  Highly recommended.  I've served it over and over to rave reviews.  The cooking time is accurate, as pork is best when still pink in the centre.

A 5 Star Recipe!!! My husband and I loved this recipe. You can use a 3-4 lb. pork tenderloin and the dish is great. I did not change the recipe. I have made the meal several times. I use the leftovers for Fried rice, Egg rolls, etc.
