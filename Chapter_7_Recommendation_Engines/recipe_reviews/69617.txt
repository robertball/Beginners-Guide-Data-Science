Wonderful recipe, however, I cooked this a bit differently. I used sesame oil instead of the evoo, quickly seared the tuna on both sides at a very high heat and did not add the teriyaki sauce into the pan. I didn't want my tuna to "poach". Instead I placed the sauce into another pan to heat up and once the tuna was out of the skillet I poured the sauce over. PLEASE make sure you only sear your tuna. You only want about an eight to a quarter of an inch of your fish to be cooked. Tuna should be prepared like a rare steak. Think Pink; you won't be sorry! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Very easy and very good. My husband and I ate this with steamed vegetables, and used the leftover teriyaki sauce to pour over the them. I also did not put any salt on the tuna, and they did not need it after the sauce. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

This is excellent, I make it all the time. It's nice to have such a gret, guest worthy dinner that you can cook in less than 10 minutes! The only change I make is to not use the sesame seeds as I couldn't find any, and I left out the salt since the teriyake sauce is salty enough. I serve is with brown rice and steamed snow peas. The grated carrots really make it. 5 stars!

I took a break from cooking this weekend & my hubby made this for me while I soaked in the bath w/ a glass of wine. He omitted the sea salt since teriyaki tends to be salty & he took the suggestions of LindaMcClean w/ the exception of leaving the tuna rare. He did however leave them medium-rare, which IMO were perfect (I usually like my meat medium to MW). They were juicy & flavorful! He sauteed asparagus, broccoli & snap peas in some of the teriyaki sauce as well (these were just a bit salty due to the teriyaki & could have used a little brown sugar to counteract that) & then served it w/ jasmine rice & fresh sliced mangoes.

Excellent and very easy to prepare. Buy a high quality teriyaki sauce, as that is what will make or break this recipe.

This was so easy and SO good!  I even used frozen (instead of fresh) tuna steaks that were also smaller than what were called for and this STILL turned out great.  I didn't measure the olive oil or the teriyaki marinade (I used Game Tame teriyaki marinade).  The sauce was great and also was to die for on top of the shredded UNCOOKED carrots, and I was a little skeptical about those - sounded too easy to taste good, but they went perfectly with the fish and sauce.  A very nice dish.  This was a winner!

This was very good.  I made extra sauce and drizzled over steamed vegetables.  I served with Seasoned Couscous recipe from this site.  We will make again.

This was excellent, cooked on grill, 2 minutes each side-5 minutes would be way too long. Can't wait to have it again.

Excellent dish.  I took a previous viewers suggestion and did not add the remaining teriyaki sauce but did use the lemon juice.  Outstanding results.  My husband, who is not a big tuna steak fan, raved and wants more!

I was lazy and just had the Tuna steaks and the Teriyaki sauce. With 2 hours of marination (no sea salt, no sesame and no garnishing) this dish tasted great with rice.

I had to use lime juice since lemons are so hard to find, and expensive when you do find them. I squeezed 1/2 on during marinade time, and the other half while cooking. Turned out very tender, almost like a nice filet. Be sure not to overcook, it's so easy to do while pan frying.

Followed exactly and it was very yummy!  I used a store bought teriyaki that garlic and sesame seeds already in it, but that was the only difference.

Used Bonito instead of Tuna. A light oil brushing onto the pan would have been better because when I placed the marinated fish onto the small pools of oil, it splashed horribly. Heated the marinade (from this site: Teriyaki Sauce and Marinade) separately with the lemon juice and serve on the side.

I found the time allowed for marinating was not enough.  I also found the whole dish a bit bland.   I added some chopped green onions and some wasabi powder and enjoyed it much more.

I really enjoyed the tuna steaks. My only problem is that I cooked them to long (6 minutes per side to long). Thanks for the recipe. Dawn

Didn't go over too well here. Didn't like the blend of flavors and find the teriyaki flavor to heavy for fish. Also tried the sesame oil as suggested but that made it worse. Sorry. We prefer lighter flavors with fish.

Fantastic!!!  I drizzled the sauce over some basmati rice though.  To add another bit of color with the grated carrots, I shredded some red cabbage to mix with it.  I also sliced some cucumber on the side.  I love tuna and cucumber any way it's done!  There's something about the refreshing taste the cucumber gives to the tuna...don't know what it is!  Overall it was such a great treat!

I made this for dinner tonight using OJ in place of the lemon. Soooo good. I steamed sliced carrots I had in the microwave with a little garlic and butter served over couscous. Fast, healthy meal. Perfect for a hot summer day.

We grilled this on a charcoal grill.  Yummy!  Don't need to add salt, though, the teriyaki sauce is salty enough.  Serve on a bed of wilted spinach.

Yet another excellent recipe! My 3 year old, 16 year old and husband all loved it. Very, very easy. Very, very tasty. The only change I might attempt is to add some chopped green onion next time; and I will make this again. Thank you so much for sharing!

Delicious - I BBQ'd ours after marinating - yummy :)  Also grilled up some zucchini & asparagus and served with more (untainted) sauce.

I think with some modifications this recipe would be worthy of five stars.  I'm giving it a three, because the sodium content is ridiculous and that was just with the teriyaki sauce - I didn't add sea salt. That just screams HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE!!  Next time I will try marinating in half the sauce and use half the lemon for juicing.  I will follow others recommendations and pan sear the tuna without adding the teriyaki sauce to the pan.

I used salmon instead of tuna, and I left off the salt & pepper. Teriyaki sauce is salty enough. It was excellent. Next time, I will sautee garlic with the salmon. I served it with teriyaki noodles and sugar snap peas. Yum. :)

My husband really liked the flavor! I even served it just like the picture with the grated carrots and he cleaned his plate. When tuna steaks go on sale again I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe and easy to make.  Mixed reviews from our family: two of us loved it, the other two were not so sure.  Will need to make it again :)

very good. I cooked this for my girlfriend and I and we both loved it. Definitely take out the salt. I did not even put it in and the Teryaki sauce is still too salty. But very tasty!
