So cute!  I went to a cooking class that recommended dipping fruit in lemon/lime soda to keep it from turning brown.  A good alternative to using lemon juice. Sugar free soda can be used for those watching sugar/weight.

I had to try these today just for fun. I like that they are a healthy or more diabetic friendly Halloween treat. Those are rare to find! I only had the sliced almonds. They worked fine as long as I picked out the small and thicker ones. Very cute yet simple and easy idea!

Easy crowd-pleaser for halloween parties.  I dipped the slivered almonds in caramel apple dip before inserting them in the apples - it made the almonds stick better, and made the "teeth" look even more like a monster mouth with "gross" brown stuff around them.  Almost didn't make it out of my kitchen to the party because my kids couldn't stop snacking.

Excellent - Thanks for the creative recipe!
This is going to be a classroom Halloween snack and can't use nuts. Instead I used a knife to cut individual slits on the top and bottom and used broken white corn chip pieces for the teeth. I did a trial run and used a dilution of red food coloring, water and lemon juice to make the "mouth" red before I stuck the "teeth" in so they would show up better. My son loved it, said it was creepy and thought it tasted great too.

Loved it!!!  In china slivered almonds are hard to come by or expensive so I used pumpkin seeds. Nice green teeth!

My kids loved these last Halloween!  I spread peanut butter in the "mouth" to hold the teeth in.

I just made these with my kids - the were a big hit! If you wanted to make them nut-free you could probably use roasted sunflower seeds (I buy the unsalted kind). Will definitely make these again - nice that not everything for Halloween has to be a cookie or candy!

These are really cute. Does anyone have a suggestion for (or tried) making them nut-free? I am thinking maybe corn flakes or puffed rice might work for the teeth instead of almonds? Or pretzel sticks?

These are just tooooo cute!  I love it!  I made these for all my Grandkids and they all had a good laugh!  One of them shouted to his Papa that here was a good set of teeth for him!  They were so easy to make and so fun to give!  Thanks for the great idea!

Great idea. We billed them as "dentures" on our gross food buffet and they disappeared. Thank You.

I soak the apple wedges with OJ & lemon juice.  The OJ gives them a wonderful flavor that kids really like (adult to!)

I've made these many times but I always use dry roasted peanuts cut into slivers instead of almond slivers. My kids always get a kick out of these even though they're in their 20's now! Fun Halloween snack...and healthy too!

My grandchildren and I really enjoyed making these ghoulish teeth.  The photo shows one of my granddaughters "wearing" her teeth.  Scary but delicious!  And healthy too.  We used slivered almonds to make the teeth really ugly.

Such a cute and fun idea! My coworkers loved them and they were a healthy alternative. Lemon helped keep them from browning for over a day. Thanks for sharing!

Yum! These were so good on Halloween that I now use the recipe year-round. (Instead of sticking the almonds in as teeth, I just sprinkle lemon coated apple slices with almonds.

This was a bit hit at our Halloween party. I put Caramel sauce in the mouths but it just wound up melting off. I suggest a caramel dip in the center instead. Also, use a paring knife to scour where the teeth should go! It makes using slivered almonds so much easier. I almost went insane when I could poke them through.
