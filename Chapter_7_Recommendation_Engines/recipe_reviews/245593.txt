03-16-16 A fun creative way to enjoy a different pizza. I had a lot of dough. It was humid the day I made this and I had to add extra flour to get the dough to come together. I had 4 oz. of French onion dip that I added to 4 oz. of sour cream to make the sauce. The flavor of this pizza comes together very nicely. We had a tossed salad with this very filling pizza. It is a pizza that I would make again.
