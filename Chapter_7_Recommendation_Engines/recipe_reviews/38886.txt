Very nice.  I drained the tomatoes and only used 5 cans instead of 7.  It was still a bit runny, but I added some extra cilantro and onions to thicken it up a bit.  

I also put 3 habernero peppers and 3 smoked jalepeno peppers into it.  Seeds included.  It had a nice slow burn, but wasn't over the edge.  

I will definitely make it again, but will puree fewer of the tomatoes and drain off all the juice on every source.

Very great salsa--my favorite to make homemade. The first time I made this was for an open house party. I used chili peppers instead of jalapenos (on accident) and it was very good and about medium level spicy...no one believed habanero was in there (only slight slow burn)! Several people wanted the recipe. The second time I made this today, I cut the recipe in half and I used some of my grandpa's garden tomatoes (that had been peeled, diced and frozen) and used a kitchen scale to weigh the right amount. I still used a whole habanero, 1 jalapeno, and one small chili and it was hot! My husband loves it even more now, and I'm going to give a little to my grandpa for Christmas too (he likes spicy as well)! This recipe is great and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes hot or medium salsa, as it can be either depending on what peppers and how much habanero you use relative to the scale.

I used only fresh ingredients. I used 2-3 big tomatoes, 4 thai or 5 serrano fresh peppers instead of the can of green peppers, and did not use sugar. If I need a sweet salsa I would substitute sugar for half a pureed mango.

Very good salsa.  Even better if made with roasted tomatillos.  
Wear Gloves when handling the habaneros!  They're fiery little devils and the burn on your skin is far worse than it is in your mouth if you're not careful!

I used ONE large can of tomatoes, 1 and a half limes, one onion, and two jalapenos, plus everything else.  Like the punch.  The acidity in the tomatoes mellows the peppers over a few days.  Guests LOVED it.  Makes a lot less, but a very strong salsa.

This is a very good salsa although I made a few changes. I used 5 jal instead of 3, 5 habaneros instead of 1 (seeds and ribs included on both peppers), 3 T of sugar only 5 cans of drained petite diced tomatoes and didn't put the can of chiles in at all. I blended the tomatoes in the blender, mixed it all together and it was great!!

I've been making this for years.  The only thing I do different is add a few pickled jalepenos to the mix and if I can't find whole stewed tomatoes in tomatoe sauce, I drain of the excess liquid in a collander before mixing the other ingredients with the tomatoes.  try this, you can't go wrong.  wonderful and fresh tasting!!

This is the first salsa recipe I tried to make myself.  It was outstanding.  One tip: Use SpoilerDave's suggestions.  They are very helpful.

This is a good basic recipe. I used 8 fresh tomatoes because its peak tomato season here in Northern California. I used roasted peppers: 2 Anaheims, 3 red jalapenos, 1 small green jalapeno, 1 habanero. Because fresh tomatoes are sweet naturally, adding sugar made this recipe too sweet, so I added about a tsp of cumin and chili powder. Still too sweet, so no sugar next time I used vine ripened tomatoes bought at the farmers market.

Great recipe!  I have made this a couple of times and it turns out great with a few changes.  I blend everything together at one time, I don't add the the canned chiles, and I don't add the sugar.  Comes out awesome!

This salsa is so good, it has a very unique flavor. I used 6 fresh tomatoes that I sliced before throwing them in the blender. I used 3 pickled habaneros and 3 fresh jalapenos that I left the seeds intact!!!! My salsa was spicy but not too spicy you couldn't enjoy it! Will make again, thanks...... I had to make a special trip to the store to buy more tortilla chips!

Good stuff!  I know most people get irritated when someone changes to a recipe and then rates it, but I only substituted 4 Trinidad Scorpions (currently the hottest pepper in the world) for the hananeros called for (and left in the seeds) because I like heat...  A lot of heat.  Now the Carolina Reaper has been rated the hottest pepper so as soon as they ripen I'll give this recipe another go.  I think I'll also drain the tomatoes first and possibly add some tomato paste instead of the sugar to make the sauce more thicker.

Try this one, it is the same ingredients mostly, but slightly more potent, which is how I like life. Same recipe and procedure, but substitute the amounts with one large can of tomatoes, one fresh tomato. One onion. Three garlic cloves. A three quarters inch grip of cilantro. Juice from one and a half limes, depending on how juicy your limes are. No juice from the canned tomatoes.

Remember to do a taste test, since everyone likes more or less of certain spices. I found it to be a little bland since I am a garlic lover but this is a GOOD recipe, very versatile. Thanks for sharing!

THIS IS A GOOD BASIC SALSA RECIPE. HOWEVER, WE PREFER OUR HABANERO SALSA ON THE SWEET SIDE WHICH SEEMS TO BALANCE OUT THE HEAT. APRICOT OR PEACH ARE GOOD CHOICES TO ADD TO THE SALSA. IF YOU PREFER TO BUY IT, GET MRS. RENFROS HABANERO SALSA WHICH IS MADE IN TEXAS. I BUY IT HERE (COLORADO) IN THE GROCERY STORES. IT'S VERY GOOD & THE WORK IS ALREADY DONE! IT MAKES A KILLER TEX-MEX CHICKEN HABANERO PIZZA, USING FLOUR TORTILLAS AND THIN LAYERS OF TOPPINGS. BAKE IN A HOT OVEN. (TOPPINGS: DICED COOKED CHICKEN, SLICED GREEN ONIONS, HABANERO SALSA, FINELY DICED TOMATO, CO-JACK OR PEPPERJACK SHREDDED CHEESE & GARNISHED WITH CHOPPED FRESH CILANTRO.) YUM!

I have been trying to find a good salsa recipe and till now I never have got a good one. This salsa is so good. I am a big fan of heat so I used two habanero peppers and it wasn't too hot for anyone. I took a batch camping with 2 other families and everyone asked to use it for all there dinners and a snack. Everyone loved it.

Although this recipe is a good one, I'd like to note there is a difference between Jalapeno peppers and Habanero pepper - the Habanero being even hotter than the Jalapeno.

I make this once every 6 months or so and freeze it in ice cubes, then transfer to a large gallon zip. I love it and throw in whatever I have and leave out whatever I don't. One hint: the more fresh ingredients you use, the better off you'll be. This stuff rocks in so many dishes! A favorite fast dinner is to throw 5 cubes into about 3 cups of cocked rice, add sliced green olives, a can of rinsed whatever beans we have and sliced up chorizo/or some hot sausage.

Pretty darned good. Makes a lot so I stored it in some canning jars. I cheated and used chopped, canned jalapenos. Just wanted to make it easy on myself. Decent recipe for canned ingredients. Definitely drain every item to avoid wateriness.

Best Salsa I've had, period. I used 1 can of tomato puree, no habanero, extra jalapenos and Chinese hot green peppers. 

It was excellent, and very spicy. I recommend trying the salsa after each can of tomato added until reaching your desired flavor, as each can makes it a bit sweeter.

A good salsa with tolerable heat and great flavor. Tastes just like this Mexican restuarant's salsa here in Chicago.

I made this exactly as the recipe said except I forgot to chop up one of the onions (but either way the onion I put in was rather large so it was probably about the same as 2 small/medium onions), only used 5 cans of tomatoes as someone else suggested, and I used 2 habaneros. 

This was excellent! My boyfriend LOVES hot salsa and is very particular about his salsa and he thought this was a very good alternative to the store bought Pace salsa (the only brand he likes). He also doesn't like chunky salsa so this was perfect!

My husband made this! It was amazing! It was similar in taste to "On the Border" salsa... but much better...and fresh! He went exactly by the recipe...the only deviation is that he used freeze dried garlic instead of fresh...because that's what I had on hand!

I just made this Salsa and it came out very good.I started with  oh about an 8 oz can of Tomatos with the chillies in it.I used 1 Serrano pepper and half of a Jalapeno Pepper and half of a Harbanero Pepper and half a lime.I added some Cilantro but the leaves were kind of big. I cut the ingredients in half because of the small amount of  Can Tomatoes I had.This recipe is good enough for me to go for a bigger can of tomatoes next time.The reason why I gave this recipe three stars is because it stated to use way too many cans of Tomatoes.Now unless you are feeding an army I cant see the need for that many cans of Tomatoes.The recipe also said to add one Tablespoon sugar.That didn't sound right.I didn't add any sugar.
Hopefully I have a blender the next time I make this recipe but it still came out good.

I used three medium-sized poblanos instead of the green chiles. It was very easy to roast the poblanos and jalapeños over the gas stove. Then just rub the skins off with a paper towel. I removed the seeds from all sources and used only five cans of diced tomatoes. It doesn’t really need any sugar, as the tomatoes add plenty of sweetness already. Overall, the salsa had a nice medium level of heat. If you want the salsa a bit hotter, you can avoid straining the last can of tomatoes + the habañero so that the full pepper is included in the salsa. Just make sure to blend it very well to avoid any large pieces of habañero. Wear gloves and don’t touch your face! :)

Just what I have been looking for. I like spicy, and this is just a tad spicier then I can handle. So I cut back on the peppers a tad.

I love this recipe; however, I've changed it up so many times I feel like it requires it's own recipe now haha. It's definitely a good base recipe and then you can experiment with different things.

The main things I changed is the amount of cilantro and onions.  I found the amount of cilantro to be way over powering the first try. I'm not a huge onion fan, so I reduced the amount of onions, which is fine as the peppers and spices make up for it.

For the tomatoes I use 2 large cans of Muir Glen Organic Diced Fire Roasted Tomatoes. I use about 6 unseeded habs ( I like it spicy), and I also use hot (not mild) diced green chili peppers. I still grille the jalapenos and skin them, but I don't remove the seeds. 

The salt, sugar, and lime is perfect amount for the size of the dish. If you like it less sweet, remove the sugar as limes give it enough sweet kick.

I'm further experimenting with this recipe by making it hotter and trying to find a way to give it a smoky flavor. Different naturally smoky flavored chili's might do the trick.

Good luck!

This is the only way I have salsa now! I use the seasoned diced tomatoes with the juices left in (only 4-5 cans though, and it still makes quote a lot), it adds some extra flavours and spices. Also, I switch things up a little by skipping out on the canned green chilies (I like keeping it as fresh as I can), and add in 2 different coloured peppers instead.

Wonderful salsa!  Absolutely beautiful flavor.  I added a few extra peppers because I like mine pretty spicy and I also go overboard with the garlic because I love the flavor of it, but absolutely wonderful!!!

I will use less onion next time.  I used less canned and added fresh Roma tomatoes.  I also didn't roast the jalapeño and added extra habanero. It's really good!

I used a can of crushed tomatoes in puree to try to make it less runny and it worked well.  Flavor and heat level is perfect! Love the cilantro level as well!

I followed the suggestion of only using 5 cans of tomatoes. I used 3 cans of the petite diced and 2 cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes. I didn't use the  sugar. I just blackened the jalapenos in olive oil in a frying pan. I did cut off the stems and peel the skin off the jalapenos, but then threw the whole jalapenos with their seeds in the blender. I only blended 2 of the tomato cans with 2 habaneros, one yellow and one red. I dumped the rest of the tomatoes into the green mixture that was blended previously. Turned out delicious. It makes a large bowl. Great for parties. Thank you for this awesome recipe. ;-)
