Prepared this a little differently and it turned out fabulous.  I mixed the yogurt, mayo, lemon, tarragon and dill together earlier in the day and let sit in fridge to allow the flavors to really blend together.  I increased the amount of lemon (squeezed about a quarter of a whole lemon -- about 1/2 TBSP) because I find lemon really neutralizes any 'fishy' taste.  I eliminated the mozzarella cheese entirely and did not mix in the parmesan cheese at this point.   When it came time to bake, I spread the above mixture onto the fish and baked at 400 for 15 min.  I then grated parmesan cheese on top of each fillet and placed under broiler to brown for about 3 minutes.  It was excellent and my husband, who doesn't like salmon, really liked it prepared this way.  Many thanks for the recipe idea, will make again.

found this recipe about 1/2 hour before my friends showed up, used fresh dill no tarragon or mozzarella and a dash of wheat germ- easy and delicious, they thought i had slaved over it!

I omitted the mozarella cheese and added some garlic salt. Easy, healthy and delicious!

I followed the recipe except to salt and pepper the salmon with a squeeze of lemon juice as it sat at room temperature for a bit.  Then I added the mix as written to the top.  I was able to get the perfect piece of salmon from Costco--a fresh wild Cojo!  This was a very satisfying dinner, and it would have been perfect with capers added to the topping.  Thank you for the recipe!

A quick easy weeknight dinner. I'm giving it three stars because while it was tasty, it didn't blow me away. I wouldn't serve it to company, but I'd make it again for a quick weeknight meal. I might do a last minute broil next time to see if I could get the cheese in the sauce to get crusty and crunchy... it needs a little something extra, so if anyone tries something different, I'd be curious to hear about it. Thanks for a solid recipe though!

This was great, but I made quite a few changes.  I only had 6 ounces of Greek-style plain yogurt, so I used that.  Didn't use any cheese at all.  Was pretty free with herbs.  Instead of mayonnaise, I used Dijon mustard, especially since some reviews mentioned the sauce being kind of boring.  Like another reviewer, I used quite a bit of lemon juice, both in the sauce and on the salmon.  Seasoned salmon with salt and pepper in addition to lemon juice, and put in the refrigerator while sauce stood.  Let sauce stand at room temperature for about 20 minutes, then added about 1 tablespoon of drained capers.  Baked about 20 minutes.  Salmon was a little underdone, but still very good.  Sauce was great.  Cooked this for friends, and they enjoyed it very much.  Will definitely make again.

I have been eating salmon for years and always love it, but this was a great new way to cook it!  I swapped dijon for mayo and used greek yogurt, both for personal preference.  Also, instead of mixing it in, I topped the fish with mozzarella the last couple minutes it cooked.  This was really good, but FYI- you only need a thin layer, too much and the flavor is overpowering.  I made one heavy with the spread and one light, I preferred the lightly covered one better!

The sauce was very unpleasant texturally and how it tasted. No one in my family would eat it. I think it's because the yogurt flavor overpowered the salmon flavor and that's all you taste. I'm surprised it had so many stars. Unfortunately it has good ratings from people that didn't even follow the recipe.

Well, with several adaptations- I substituted mayo for the yogurt, omitted the mozzarella and doubled the Parmesan. Baked the salmon first for 10-15 minutes then "frosted" the salmon with the topping and baked about 5 more minutes until slightly browned. Delicious

Tasted great! I used all ingredients though the dill and tarragon were fresh. Followed other reviews by mixing the cheesy topping ahead and putting it in the fridge. Then added salt and pepper and lemon juice on the salmon while room temp.

Super simple and a hit whenever I've served it.  I served this at a dinner party for 8 and one of my guests asked me to share the recipe.  I made the "sauce" topping the day before and it kept overnight perfectly.  I also use Greek style yogurt and always add the Parmesan cheese which is listed as optional.  My husband loves this recipe and I usually double it because he can't get enough of it and if I do have leftovers, it warms up nicely.
