I love this.  I make this during the week, when I am going to have baked potatoes, or need sour cream.  It is sooooo easy.  I always forget that carton of sour cream that gets pushed to the back of the frig.  You can double this if you need more.  I always have the ingredients.

It didn't thicken up.  Any suggestions?  I live in Chile and have never found buttermilk, I see that is the most common ingredient.

This is a version of creme fraiche that is very close to the type I find here in Belgium. Itâ€™s quite runny and has a less sour taste than the American version. I used homemade yogurt which has a light flavor and no thickeners.  Thank you for the recipe.
