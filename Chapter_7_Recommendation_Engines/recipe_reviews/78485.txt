These tasted great and were really easy, the boys even loved them.
One suggestion is do not cut the vegatables too thin. If you do,they tend to get a bit smushy.

After chopping the vegetables, I added to a small plastic bag and added the salt, pepper and oil to mix around in the bag prior to placing in a casserole dish.  Thought it was excellent.

It was very good if you spice them up a bit with seasonings. I used red, yellow and green bell peppers, red onions and tomatoes. The tomatoes were mushy and the green peppers were ok but boy did the red/yellow peppers and the red onions jazz up. Very good!

although this recipe looked like it was going to be fabulous, all of the veggies got soggy and did not brown....especially the asparagus.  But the flavor was great. I added thyme, basil and rosemary.

This is my favorite vegetable side dish.  I first used this recipe out of the South Beach Diet book, but am glad to see it here for everyone to try.  Very quick, easy and excellent flavor.  Just make sure to keep an eye on the time, they can get over done, even then they still taste good though.

This has been a favorite of ours since we started. In the summer when it's too hot to fire up the oven, we grill them on the BBQ using a non-stick grill topper. Perfection!

This is excellent, with any combo of veggies. I add Rosemary & Thyme to liven up the flavor a bit, and sometimes use Balsamic Vinegar. Yummy!

Very good side dish.  I made it on the grill in foil packets since it's too hot to turn on the oven.  I added a little parmesean cheese to the end product.

This recipe can be used with any roasting vegetables. My version today used peeled eggplant, squash, mushrooms and onions, which turned out quite good.  In place of pepper, I stirred in some generous shakes of smoked paprika which gave the veggies a lovely color and restaurant flavor. (If you haven't tried smoked paprika, you should really get some. It isn't spicy, but more smokey and savory and great with vegetables or chicken.)  The cooking time turned out to be a bit long for our tastes, but I suspect this has to do with individual ovens. I would say watch your veggies a bit more closely and take them out five or 10 minutes sooner. They can always go back in if they are not done enough. Good recipe!

These roasted vegetables are GREAT!  I followed the other reviewer by using the plastic bag and it works much better than combining ingredients in the roasting pan.  I also only roasted my veggies 15 minutes.  The taste is nutty and delicious!

I increased the vegetables by using 3 zucchini, 3 squash, no red or yellow peppers because I didn't have them on hand. A pound of asparagus, a large vandalia onion, more olive oil and sprinkled garlic powder, basil, salt and pepper. Everyone went nuts over these veggies. I will make this quite often. Thanks!

Excellent!  Everyone loved it and it was very easy.  UPDATE:  Have made these several times and they are always delicious and a big hit.  I chop fresh garlic and add it, along with some mushrooms.  Really great, easy recipe!  Thanks!

This is an awesome and versatile recipe. I just use whatever vegetables I have available. this time it was squash, bell pepper and a vidalia onion. I used herbes de provence and red wine vinegar also to cut down on the amount of olive oil I needed. I also didn't have to bake it for more than twenty minutes.

Veggies were good, of course, but zucchini came out a bit soggy in the middle. Recommend seeding your zucchini prior to roasting.

I made this last night.  YUMMY!  I added thyme, rosemary, balsamic vinegar and whole garlic cloves to the mix along with the olive oil.  I didn't have any asparagus, but thanks to my neighbor and his garden, I had the zucchini and squash and I had the rest of the ingredients on hand.  This is a great starter that you can adapt to use veggies you have on hand.  

I did use fresh broccoli in mine, but I didn't like the taste of it once it had roasted with the other veggies, so I'll omit that next time.
 
I could have made a meal out of just this!  It was fantastic!

My dinner guests and my boyfriend loved the veggies.  I did take the advice and cut all the veggies and put them in a bag with the olive oil and pepper the night before to save time.  I think I will add some other spices next time.  Thanks for the recipe

Delicious taste!  I used 2 Tbsp of olive oil and added 2 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar.  I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt and I didn't measure it - just sprinkled a bunch on there.  Same with the pepper.  We roasted for 25 minutes and the veggies were soft but not mushy.  Very nice recipe!

Great side dish for any Italian meal.  I like my vegetables al dente, so I would suggest cutting the oven time to 20-25 minutes.

DELICIOUS, who knew? if you cut your veggies small reduce the time they cook or they will get mushy. this is a keeper and I will make it at least once a week using differnet veggies.

This is great! I substituted peeled & chopped eggplant for the squash, and I also added fresh garlic. Also, I put the oven on 300 degrees and slow-roasted for about two hours, turning a couple times. The extra cooking time gave it a really nice flavor! Went great with roast beef.

Simple, flexible (could easily use other veggies) for the busy cook. The trick is to let the veggies carmelize. Mine took over 30 minutes because I used some veggies from the freezer... Yum!

Excellent.  I made this and then topped pasta with it plus a bit extra virgin olive oil and romano cheese, rather than using a red sauce. Delicious.

excellent flavor - very easy to prepare. I made these at Thanksgiving, which I wouldn't recommend - they would've gone much better with beef.

Delicious - I doubled the recipe and used baby carrots, yellow squash, red pepper and vidalia onion.   They came out perfect in 30 minutes.  Will definitely use again.

This is my All Time Go To recipe for veggies but with garlic added and baked at 350-400 for 30 minutes.  Excellent with bar-b-que and for feeding a crowd.

I don't like bell peppers, so I omitted them, but they still tasted delicious! I've also used Newman's Light Balsamic Vinegarette in place of the oil and seasoning, and that also works great!

This is delicious, I make it atleast once a week. I change up the veggies a bit. And sometimes, I add garlic salt instead of regular salt and maybe a little italian seasoning and red pepper for spice. My kids will even eat this, depending on the vegetables used...It's a winner everytime!

these turned out good, the vegetable shrinked a ton. I would suggest using more vegetables if your family is vegetable lovers. Also i would spray non stick spray as my vegetables wanted to stick the tin foil.

OH MY GOODNESS- this was wonderful!  I am not a veggie person... but I could eat this all the time! I didn't use the red pepper or the asparagus to cut down on the price and it was fantastic!  I also sprinkled a little garlic powder on top of the veggies.  I will be making this over and over and over.  Very easy, quick, and yummy!

I make this frequently as it is so easy to put together.  I always sprinkle a little Tony Chachere's seasoning in place of the salt and pepper.  Perfect side dish.

We really love this recipe.  If made as is...we think it is bland.  So....I added fresh garlic cloves and seasoning salt.  Also use a nonstick roasting pan to brown nicely.

I made this without the asparagus and I added fresh chopped pineapple.  Once finished, it was a little on the blah-side so I added seasoning salt and garlic powder.  Next time I will add fresh chopped garlic. Once I added the seasonings, it was delicious.

This is a fabulous starter recipe.  Since we don't always have every ingredient, we must improvise, right?.  I had cauliflower, summer squashes, leeks, carrots, tomatoes, and red bell peppers.  Sooooo,  I tossed the firm vegies together with the olive oil, fresh garlic, and some dried Italian herbs, and the S & P (then I rinsed my hands briefly in warm water to rid the herbs, but then massaged them in the clinging oil--heaven).  Roasted the vegies on a cookie sheet for about 25 minutes at 400, stirring occasionally, but do keep checking--all ovens are not the same.  When nearing done, I added the tomatoes and squash, tossing with two spoons.  Took about 5 to 8 minutes more to finish...check as you roast.  Plate these gorgeous vegetables, then shave a little Parmesan, Romano, or Asiago on top...and prepare to swoon!

great!  I only did the squashes and onion, I don't care for bell pepper much and asparagus was too much at the grocery store.  I added 1 clove of garlic and italian seasoning. I also added (don't know that its SB approved) but I added a slight sprinkle of feta when we was done right before serving. DELISH!!  We will be making this A LOT!! Thanks!

Apparently I'm one of the few that wasn't impressed with this recipe. I actually didn't go by it 100%, and am glad I didn't.  With only Salt and Pepper to season it with, it was just way too bland.  I added all kinds of spices, and it came out pretty good.

I made this last night, but just used butternut and acorn squash.  Simply cut the squash in half, brush with olive oil, salt and pepper, and bake at 350 degrees for 45-50 minutes.  Then scoop out the pulp and mash. So healthy for you!  Don't get fooled by all those squash recipes that call for butter, brown sugar, heavy cream.  That just adds calories, fat, and cholesterol.  Keep it simple.

I thought these vegetables were delicious!  I've also made it with other veggies, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and added cloves of garlic. Simple yet great flavor.  Add your favorite herbs, it only gets better.

Can't believe such a simple recipe can turn out so flavorful.  Serve immediately, though; the leftovers, though tasty, are not as firm and colorful the next day.

Delicious.  I made for supper last night with Fruity Grilled Pork Tenderloin from this site.  I did cook the vegetables a little too long so some of the them were a little too mushy for my taste but that was my fault and the taste was still wonderful.  Thank you

I had everything but red onions, but tried it anyway.  Turned out great!  I added corn in the first time, but it came out a little chewy, so the next time I boiled the corn and added it in after the other veggies were cooked.  Again, it turned out great!  A quick and easy way to add veggies to any meal.

I was very underwhelmed by these vegetables.  I agree that the red onion was the best part but the squash and zucchini needed a little something extra.  I think I'll add more spices next time and take it out sooner.

Very good and easy... We used zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, and onion.  We also added some italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I make this very often, varying the vegetables: roma tomatoes, fennel, eggplant, bell peppers, zucchini... I add a few (entire) garlic cloves and Italian herbs I have on hands. Great side dish and super healthy!

I'm always looking for ways to incorperate more veggies into our diet, so this caught my eye. It's great! We liked it very much. I aslo added some garlic powder and a little italian seasoning which went really well. So tasty! Loved it :)

This was pretty good but it needs more flavor. I added some garlic but it needs more herbs. Next time I will add some thyme or dill.

This was an easy & tasty way to make these veggies.  I ended up using a whole zucchini, squash, red & yellow bell pepper and left everything else the same.  It came out great!

This turned out good and was simple. Even hubby ate it and he's not a veggie kinda guy... I didn't have oil on hand, but a coating of cooking spray on the pan and another coat on the veggies was just enough. I thought they were a little limp when they were done, so I stuck them under the broiler for about 1 minute to crisp the top. I then tossed with about 1/4 cup of pepper jack cheese and 1 cup of salsa. Delicious and filling!

AWESOME.  If this is what being on a diet is all about then bring it on!

Update:  The next day it just wasn't as good.  I like foods that taste good as leftovers as well.  This was not one.

Delish! I was trying to use up a few extra veggies I had and thought to roast them. I only used roma tomatoes, green peppers, and red onions ~ oh, plus, some fresh garlic tossed in with the olive oil. Fantastic!
