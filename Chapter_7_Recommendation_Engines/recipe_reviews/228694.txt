This was a very good creamy chicken enchilada recipe.  The only change I made was to add some hot pepper sauce to the filling mixture.  I did have an issue with the enchiladas sticking to my dish even after generously spraying with non-stick spray.  I topped with diced onion, sliced olives, tomatoes, and cilantro.  Would definitely make this one again!

These came out pretty good! I used chicken breasts diced up in this and omitted the chiles as DH has an aversion to them. They went together very easily. It is a good busy weeknight meal!

My family loved these.  I will say you need to taste as you go for seasoning.  Next time I will put 1 cup of sauce on the bottom of the pan.  I will also add corn.  I added extra cumin after tasting the sauce and garlic salt, and salt.  My family liked these better than my usual queso casserole recipe.

This was very easy to make and a great shortcut by using the rotisserie chicken.   I made exactly as the recipe stated with the addition of adding some sauteed white onion to the filling.   I did have more than 1/2 cup of the sauce leftover, so, I just poured all of it on top of the enchiladas.  My family was not a huge fan of these enchiladas and probably would not make again, but, I do think it would be an easy recipe for a starter cook.

Add a McCormick Chipotle Chicken Taco Recipe Inspiration season pack to it and it will give it a more southwestern taste.  Im not as talented with tex mex style cooking as I am with others.  And this was a very helpful resource.  (And an easy cheat.)

I made a bland version of this due my wife's aversion to spices and it was great! I used turkey for the meat.  It's very filling.

It was easy to prepare because of the progreso meal starter, but it was a little flat on flavor. Adding cilantro would help? Not a keeper for us.
