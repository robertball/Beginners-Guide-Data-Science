great brownies will make them again but I think I'll add more cinnamon. I also prepped the pan with butter and cocoa powder instead of flour.

pretty easy and good, not the best I have ever had. Coffee flavor definitely comes through. I added mini choc chips and choc frosting. Done right at 25 min on 335 convection

I would definitely make these again!  I didn't have instant coffee, so I used a coconut coffee as a replacement.  I also had some chocolate covered coffee beans, that I crushed, and sprinkled on top of the brownies as soon as they came out of the oven.  With a spatula, I gently spread the melting chocolate in a thin layer over the brownies.  This was a great addition!

Excellent recipe. The coffee flavor shines through without being overwhelming. Will make again!
