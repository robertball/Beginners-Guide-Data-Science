Awesome!  I prefer a flaky crust, so I used 2 refrigerated rolled pie dough crusts.  I used a poached, shredded chicken (white and dark meat), some frozen mixed veggies, and a can of cream of mushroom as well as the cream of chicken soup.  Using all this made way too much pie filling, so I made two pies (one to bake and one to freeze), and it came out WONDERFUL! It was the best chicken pot pie I've ever had, and I can't wait to break that second pie out of the freezer!

I love this recipe and make it once a month after we have a roast chicken. Two changes I make though - when I'm making veg for the roast I cook alot more than I need to use in place of the frozen veg (although I still add frozen peas and corn to the pie) and I use ready made, chilled puff pastry instead of the topping mix. Really, really recommend this as it is really easy and a great way to use leftover veg and chicken.

This pot pie is actually quite tasty! My family enjoys this recipe with the addition of cubed potatoes. To save on time I use frozen country style hash browns (small potato cubes) in the pot pie rather than fresh potatoes. The crust is definitely the best part of this pot pie, I usually make a double batch because my family enjoys a thicker crust. My kids especially love this recipe and I think it is a great way to use up leftover chicken meat from roasted chicken. You can always customize this pot pie by adding extra vegetables or throwing in some shredded cheese. The only seasoning you really need is a bit of fresh cracked pepper and a dash of salt. Thanks for the great recipe!

I use Heart Healthy bisquick, frozen stew veggies (corn, green beans, carrots, potatos, lima beans, peas)and one of the healthy request cream of chicken soups that I mix with about 1/2 can of water. My boyfriend always thought it was just meh but I'm persistent since it's a healthy meal...now I season it with garlic powder, black pepper and crushed red pepper for a kick and it's awesome. This is a great base recipe to play with.

I used this recipe for my leftover turkey. I didn't have any frozen mixed vegies so used 1 can niblets corn & 1 can peas. I looked on the bisquick website and saw that some used 2 cans of soup, so that's what I used, 2 cream of chicken - added 1/2 can milk, few shakes each garlic powder and onion powder. To the topping I added a shake of garlic and about 1/2 t dried italian herbs to impart some more flavor. I found that it was ok but DH loved it and said I should make again. I really feel it would have been better with the mixed veggies. Perhaps subbing 1 can for cream of potato would also be good(?)

My fiance and I loved this recipe! He's a vegetarian so we left out the chicken and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. Our dinner was delicious, quick, easy and a great way to use up the assortment of  veggies in our freezer.

I modified this recipe based on other reviews and quantity needed(5 adults).  I used a Deep Dish Stone Pie Dish; Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust dough(2); 2 cans of Campbell's condensed cream of chicken soup and 1 can of condensed cream of celery soup; 1 bag of mixed veggies thawed; 1 box of Purdue already cooked chicken, cut up.  I also lowered the temperature to 350 and cooked it for an hour.  It was a HUGE hit...even the pickiest eater loved it.  I didn't season it as there are some watching sodium etc.  But we did use cracked pepper per serving to taste.

This was delicious. I made a few changes. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder then i sauted the cut pieces in olive oil until golden brown. I then sauted mushrooms and onions in the same pan. In a bowl i mixed 1 can of cream of potato and one can of cream of mushroom, 1 bag of mixed frozen vegetables, the mushroom and onion mix and the chicken. I then added that to my baking dish and sprinkled the top with salt pepper and garlic powder. I mixed bisquick with milk until smooth and i evenly spread over my chicken mixture. This was perfect and i'll definatly make this again.

This is one of our favorite recipes.  It is great to take to potluck dinners, new neighbors or sick or recovering friends.  It's very versatile.  I use different soups - cream of mushroom , cream of chicken, cream of celery and my favorite - cream of potato.  I use two cans of soup, sometimes using the same and sometimes two different ones.  Then I use one can of Veg-All plus any leftover veggies in the fridge.  I also use about 2 cups of chicken - sometimes I bake it in the micro with spices, sometimes I buy one of the roasted chickens at the grocery.  You can also use ham. I usually make a double batch and either freeze one or give it to someone.  These freeze wonderfully.  To freeze, I usually put them in the little individual loaf pans.  Makes it so easy to take out one for lunch.

This is a FABULOUS, super easy and fun meal to experiment with. I basically went by the instructions except I went to the deli and had them slice chicken for me (to a #10) and cubed it at home. (I use 3 slices for a serving of 6 & it's more than enough) This little step saved a lot of time! I also use different soups; cream of chicken & cream of potato, etc... but I always use 2 cans & on the veggies I may use 1 or 2 bags, it depends how large my pie plate is. I'm going to try a different crust today because I like a more flaky crust. There's really not much to it and everyone will love it!!! A winner!!!!

It was very dry, I followed the directions exactly.  Next time I will add milk to the soup and add less baking mix mixture.  Will also add additional seasons as it was bland too.  Concept is great, but needs tweaking.

I am pretty picky when it comes to cooking with left over chicken so I was surprised how much I enjoyed this when I made it. I used frozen pie crusts instead of baking mix and canned corn, peas, carrots and some frozen hashbrowns. For some seasoning I threw in lots of pepper, garlic powder, and some Mrs. Dash. Baked it for about 40 mins..voila! Now I need to buy more crusts to use up the extra filling I have left.

This was quick and easy!

I made it using two pie crusts and used an egg white bath. I also used chicken and herb soup and added salt and pepper before I added the top crust.

Husband thought that I bought it.

Very quick and easy!  I was looking for something new to do with left-over chicken.   Although the pie was good, we prefer a rolled dough crust over a baking mix crust; also, I would add seasonings.   Thank you Campbell's Kitchen for a very quick and easy recipe!

I made this with a couple changes. Added corn, celery, and broccoli. Also, along with the one can of Cream of Chicken, I added a can of Broccoli cheese soup. Made it a little bit cheesier and not as dry.
Also I added more seasonings. Like garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasonings. 
Very quick and easy. 
Awesome dinner.

I am now making this for the 2nd time. The first time, using fresh chicken breasts, I boiled it and added garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper so it had some flavoring. I used extra chicken and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and plenty of veggies (didn't use measuring cups for anything). It came out delicious. My fiance fell in love with it, so I am surprising him today with it.

Very simple recipe!!!! Was a little plain though, so to help that I used Perdue Chicken shortcuts (already cooked and in the fridge section) which jazzed up the flavor, I also added some pepper, garlic powder and cheddar cheese...YUM!!! Big hit in our house!

I use a can of cheddar cheese soup in addition to the cream of chicken and use sour cream or Greek yogurt instead of the milk.  I serve it over biscuits instead of the making the biscuit topping.

Really easy!  I gave it 3 stars because I made quite a few changes.  Like other reviewers, I used 2 cans of condensed cream soup.  I've used many different kinds, but this time, I tried cream of celery and cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  I cooked the chicken with some olive oil, poultry seasoning, and a little chili powder.  I also added some potatoes--I cut 4 small/medium potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes, boiled them in water for 5 min (just before they were done, so they would be firm enough to mix), and drained off the water.  I mixed all this together with frozen mixed veggies, some black pepper, and dried parsley.  A few times when I made this, the poured crust didn't cook evenly.  This time, I made drop biscuits with 2 cups of Bisquick and 2/3 cup of milk and dropped/spread them on the top of the pot pie. Then, I covered the dish with foil and baked the whole thing for about 50 minutes at 375F.

I loved this! And so did my husband who isn't a huge pot pie fan. I added frozen green beans and fresh carrots as the only vegetables and doubled the cream of mushroom soup. I will definitely make this again!

SUPER Easy and fast for a great hearty meal! I baked 4 chicken thighs the night before. The next afternoon I took the meat off the bone, mixed with vegetables and soup and topped, baked, and ate...yum yum!

This recipe was easy, and I think it's a good base recipe.  But it was very bland.  It reminded me of eating from a school cafeteria.  First off, salt, pepper and some other spices are a necessity.  The filling would be good if maybe you cubed up some Velveeta and let it incorporate to make a cheesy sauce inside.  Maybe also use a cheese soup base. The crust needs something, too.  It's also very bland.  The crust had a nice crunch to it and overall the casserole had a good consistency.  It was just missing flavor.

Will do this again.  Family loved it.  Followed advice of other reviews to fix how my family would like this.  Had peas and carrots, a pie crust, and alot of seasonings- salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and celery seeds.  Thanks!

Blah! I personally didn't like this one. The biscuit crust was too dry and sweetish and the rest was too bland. I won't make it again. It might have been better using cream of mushroom soup rather than cream of chicken.

This recipe was very easy to make, but it turned out very bland. It definitely needs something else to add more flavor. The crust was not very good either. I would have preferred a flaky pie crust instead. I will not be making this again.

I doubled the recipe for a family dinner substituting a can of cream of celery with the cream of chicken just because I only had one can of the chicken.  It worked out great and I'll do it again.

Just made this with premade pie crust and it was great (especially for the amount of time it took to make)!! Will definitely be making again. The fiance loved it too. Might use 1 1/2 cans soup next time and a bit more chicken but still was so good.

The great thing about doing your own cooking is that you can add whatever you like,  it is exclusively your cooking.  I added garlic, oregano, and seasoned salt, and replaced the biscuit crust with a Jiffy cornbread crust,  I like Jiffy cornbread because it has just a hint of sweetness.

Cooked for lunch--very quick, instead of making a topping, just used Pillsbury crescent rolls (1 1/2 cans), pinching seams together.  Looks pretty and tastes good too!  I sub. the plain cream of chicken soup for the new Campbell's cream of chicken WITH Herbs soup.  My kids liked and it's very quick.  Used leftover rotissere chicken from the grocery store to make today.  Will make again and stock up on the new cream of chicken with herbs flavor. I wish they made it with less sodium! Enjoy.

Wonderful and easy recipe!  I added potatoes to the recipe to increase the number served.  I also added some spices that the recipe didn't call for and it was great.  The entire family loved this dish.

Actually found this recipe on the back of the Bisquick box and tried it last night. The crust was the best part but the sauce did seem like it was missing something but I also used the reduced fat cream of chicken soup which is probably the problem. Next time I will try adding some additonal seasoning like garlic and maybe poultry.   The crust looked like it was going to be super thin but it puffed up nicely

I do this same thing; except instead of the milk, egg, and baking mix step, I just unroll refridgerated crescent rolls and top the pot pie with them instead.  So easy!  So delicious!

HORRIBLE!!! This dish looks better than it tastes.  I always try out a recipe as written before I tweak it. After all, a recipe shoud stand on its own two feet, so to speak.   Nevertheless, I did add Adobo to my chicken mixture.  It didn't save it by much. I think the thawed out frozen veggies, which was part of the recipe, just washed out the flavor of the soup, chicken and spices.  In addition, I was disapoointed with the biscuit topping.  It came out pretty as a picture, but was so bland and did not enhance the dish at all.   This one is not a keeper for me.

Great recipe.
I made one without chicken and added potatoes and curry powder and garam masala.  It was awesome.

I also made the recipe as is with cream of mushroom.  Also really good.

I had everything on hand to make this except a bag of frozen veggies.  I used a drained can of green beans, carrots and onions from the garden and a few mushrooms that needed to be used.  I used canned chicken chunks but leftover chicken would have been better.  I'd never seen a recipe for a pourable crust and this was terrific!

I made this tonight it was very good but I made some changes to it. I used corn & carrots. I added some garlic powder, onion salt & parsley I also added cheese & a package of roast gravy for chicken. I also used tenderflake pie shells. It made two pies so I'm going to freeze one for another night :)

Delicious. I used cream of mushroom soup, a 12-oz. bag of Kroger mixed vegetables and since I didn't have any baking mix, I made a crust of 1 cup of self-rising flour, 4 tablespoons butter. 1/2 cup evaporated milk and 1 egg, a dash of salt and a pinch of baking soda.  I added a couple tablespoons more of milk to make it thin enough to spread.  Came out with a golden crust after 25 minutes.  Tried this with leftover beef with great results.  Will make again and will try different cream soups like chicken, celery, etc.

Very easy to make and came out delicious! The only adjustment I will make is the crust. It's too soft for my liking, and with the recipes measurements, it came out much too thick. Overall, really good though!

This definitely was easy.  I added extra seasoning since I had extra chicken and veggies & I tried to adjust the sauce and topping accordingly.  I am not so sure I needed to add extra seasoning.  I made it in a cake pan.  Never thought about 2 pie pans, but oh well.  I did cover it with foil the last 10 minutes.  I will make it again.  Thank you for sharing.

My husband loved this, and he's a picky eater! I made several changes to suite us. I added another can of the chicken soup and used fresh veggies instead of frozen, which improves almost any dish! I also added some fresh crushed garlic - yummy! To cook the chicken and veggies I threw them all into a pot and boiled it for about 15 minutes. When baking it, I am glad I watched it closely, as I cooked it in my convection oven and only needed to cook it at 350*F for 22 minutes.

I think this is a great and simple recipe!  I did make a few changes/additions: - cream of mushroom soup and cream of chicken with herbs soup - frozen peas and corn - fresh chopped carrots, green beans, and red peppers - pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes - only made 1/2 of the baking mix, although next time I think I will use Pillsbury crescent rolls on top - used a 9" square casserole dish I thought it was very flavorful for chicken pot pie!

i used a prepaird pie crust bottom thawed and to the mixture added a can of cream of mushroom as well as the cream of chicken also added smalled diced potatos with onion from the refrigerator section and toped with prepaired pie crust then maked used foil around edges the first like 20 minutes to prevent burning this was good the only changes i would try would be to use puff pastry instead of pie crust and maybe add more soup to it mine wasnt as moist as i wanted it to be i think the crust soaked up some of the juices and am trying the puff pastry because the pot pie tasted very sweet to me over all a good recipe to have on hand

It would be a good idea to boil the chicken first. When I tried making this by the recipe the first time, the chicken didn't get done. Needless to say I won't make that mistake again!

Great for using leftovers.  I had no eggs, but did have a box of pie crust mix in the pantry. and made a top crust only pot pie and added some cooked onions left over from an onion casserole, fresh cracked pepper and a dash of garlic powder.  My there was nothing left, two of us had seconds.  I love this website:)

This recipe saved dinner. I was going to make Turkey Pot Pie II but forgot to thaw my pie crusts.  I added garlic and onion powder to the turkey mixture and added dried parsly to the batter.  I also thought of adding shredded cheese to the batter but didn't feel like shredding it.  Recipe still needs a little something.  Things I've though of are cumin, chili powder, BBQ sauce, or tabasco.

Hurray!  This was great.  I didn't have bisquick so I just mixed an instant bisquick muffin mix (just add water) and put that on top and it came out great.  Another day I tried doubling the recipe because we liked it so much but it didn't come out as good because the muffin browned before the pie was cooked through.  I'm new to cooking so next time I'll try adding foil to the top or using a bigger dish.

When you come home from work tired and in the dark in the middle of winter this is great. I make it super easy by using canned chicken. Usually use cream of celery soup and just peas and carrots.

I make this all the time because it's so quick and always a hit when I'm craving comfort food. Instead of the pie crust, I cook up some grands biscuits and lay them on top, open faced style. I also add cubed potatoes.

To kick it up a notch, cook 4 strips bacon, cut and add to mix. Then in same pan, fry up frozen cubed hash-browns. I also add 1 can of cream of mushroom soup too! It's a family favorite!!! I use the tube of croissants as my pie topper. Super flaky and delicious.

Yuk...the biscuit topping didn't work out. Stayed gunky and undercooked underneath. Fairly bland and nothing special. I'd rather take the time to make a decent pot pie with fresh ingredient and a crust vs this. Easy? sure...but I threw most of it out.

My family loved this!  I pressure-cooked boneless, skinless chicken thighs for 10' with a cup of water. I also added Herbes De Provence, sauteed onions and  a pie crust for the top.

I used 1 can cream of chicken & 1 can cream of mushroom. 1 1/2Cans of mixed veggies. Turned out really good. The crust is a little thick, more of a biscut texture.

great recipe.  but i would  advise using one more can of cream of mush/chicken soup.  it was delicious, my whole family loved it!!  i also used a instant pie crust on the bottom of the pot pie and topped it with the topping from the recipe, then added parmesan cheese on top in the last 5 minutes.  yum!!!!  will make it again!

The dough made according to the recipe was as fluid as pancake dough. I didn't know whether it should stay on top, or mix with the rest. As it sank, I mixed it with the rest. 30 minutes was way to short, it took 50 minutes. Very heavy meal, never again

This has been a hit every time I make it! No substitutes are necessary unless you want to make it low fat. Otherwise use the low fat Bisquick mix and low sodium soup.

Really easy but overall I thought it was bland.  I added some basic spices, garlic powder, pepper, etc., but it definitely needed something more.

Overall a decent recipe and I would make it again but would probably experiment with some more modifications.

Very good. Family loved it. I doubled using cream of potato & cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soups. I used a 2 1/2 at casserole, didnt double the biscuit crust. Went 10 mins at 375 then 400 for 30 mins.

This recipe is such a super easy way to do chicken pot pie on a rush.

It was great but personally, I would much prefer the flakey and crispy texture like Phyllo sheets or Croissant skin.

I used parrot brand coconut milk and mixed powdered cream of chicken( Lipton brand ) for the meat and veggies. I also used parrot brand coconut milk to make the bread topping, gluten free. I used canned mixed veggies too. 
The coconut had a strong smell of coconut( more then I am use to ) but it turned out yummy. Easy peasy! Baked at time and temp provided. Will make again! 
Thanks!

I seasoned the chicken with Cavendar's Greek Seasoning and the whole mixture with Bouquet Garni (herb mix) from Penzy's for added flavor.

I made this recipe using leftover turkey but made the crust from the oatmeal stuffing we have at thanksgiving.  I add some chopped onion and an egg.  The I bake the crust 15 minutes before filling. We serve it with the leftover gravy. It's wonderful.

This is a great recipe.  I like this one because of the easy topping.  I add the following to this recipe: increased chicken to about 1 1/2 cups (I had extra chicken and wanted to use it all)  1 can cream of chicken soup, about 12 ounces frozen mixed veggies instead of canned, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 onion chopped (I saute it first), 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning and ground black pepper to taste (I use about 1/2 tsp. because we like spice but 1/4 tsp. would probably be enough).  Also, instead of a pie plate I used an 8 inch square glass baking dish.  I think it's easier to cut and serve from a square dish.  My husband took the leftovers to work for lunch!

Delicous and very easy to make!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used refrigerated pie crust instead of all purpose baking mix.  I was sceptical at first that such a simple pot pie would taste great, but I really enjoyed it.  I actually doubled the recipe to make two pies- one for dinner and one to freeze for the future.

Cheap & easy, and it tastes like it.  Tastes like it's from a box.  Won't be making again.

Super easy and a crowd pleaser! Especially if you use canned chicken and have a baking mix.

I've used this often for a quick dinner.  I use cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken or mushroom.  That with extra pepper makes it taste more like the homemade pot pie my mom used to make.

This is a staple item in our dinners. I usually chop up some potatoe and add it to the mix. Yum.

It was an easy recipe, but the crust was not good, and I don't know how to fix it.  The crust was not crisp, had no flavor, and would probably be better with biscuits.
