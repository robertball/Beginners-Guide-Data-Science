The filling was very yummy but I followed the other reviewers' suggestion and made my own pasta.Mrs.Payne suggested the "Basic Pasta" recipe from this site and I made it as is, only to find out that it wasn't enough and should have DOUBLED the recipe.I used water to seal the ravioli together, pressed the edges together, and used a small pizza cutter to cut them apart.Then I made my own rosee tomato sauce (in a large frying pan heat 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat; saute 2 chopped garlic cloves till slightly golden; remove pan from burner, wait a moment for the simmering to ease up and add 500 ml/2 cups of crushed tomato sauce and a couple tablespoons of water-be careful not to splash yourself; return pan to burner, turn the heat to low, cover and let simmer for another 15-20 minutes until thickened, stirring occasionally; remove from burner, add 1 tbsp chopped fresh basil, season with salt and pepper to taste, and gently stir in 3 tbsp of cream), and my husband said that it complimented the ravioli very well.When cooking the ravioli, bring a large pot of salted water to a SIMMER and cook 4-6 at a time till they float to the top.However, don't overcook them.Once they float to the top, let it cook a few more moments until the "doughy" look is gone.UPDATE: made with wonton wrappers and worked just as great. In order for them not to fall apart, BRING THE WATER TO A SIMMER, not to a boil.

5 Stars - for the filling
0 Stars - for using wonton wrapper

Twice we used the wonton wrappers becasue the filling was so delicious. But it left a little something to be desired.

Then, we got wise and learned how to make homemade pasta. 

WOW! Totally amazing filling. We just drizzle it with good olive oil and shave a little fresh parmesan over the top and it's perfection.

The filling is absolutely unbelievably melt in your mouth amazing! Even for a mere "mushrooms are just ok and sometimes I pick em out of stuff" kinda eater like me. No, the wonton wrappers are not ideal but oh so easy it makes up for it! A few hints about wonton wrappers. They are NOT all created equal!! The kind from regular grocery stores are often thin and cheap thus harder to use and more chance of ripping. if you get a chance, get some from an actual asian market, however the "nasoya" brand from wal-mart are better then others. It makes a HUGE HUGE HUGE difference! For all of those who lost filling... 1) USE BETTER WONTON WRAPPERS! 2) you MUST make sure that every tiny part of the 'seam' is completley pinched shut! 3) do not over stuff or the filling will burst the seams. 4) squeeze all of the air out. That promotes ripping! A change I think I'll make permenant is to add some chopped spinach. Defrost, squeeze out all the liquid as possible, mix in when you add the cheese. To seal I just used beaten egg, no milk. Topped it off with "newman's own" vodka sauce. compliments it nicely! YUUMMMMM!

Better than Olive Garden!  I changed the mushrooms to portobello as I like their flavour better, plus I was looking to duplicate Olive Garden's portobello ravioli.  I also used dried herbs; 1tsp dried rather than 1 tbps fresh.  I'm certain the flavours would be stronger with the fresh herbs.  I also used the basic pasta recipie as I'm not a fan of wonton wrapper ravioli.  This recipe was creamy and flavourful.  To duplicate the sauce I used a sundried tomato alfredo with 1 cup of smoked edam cheese melted in.  Top with fresh disced tomatos and green onions and it's not just like Olive Garden, it's better!  YUM!  Thanks so much for posting.

The filling was restaurant quality, and instead of making ravioli, I shaped each won-ton wrapper into tortellini and I didn't lose a single one.

This  was one of the most delicious fillings I have ever had, and is going into my cookbook 4ever!
The one thing I did not do (based on what others said) was use the won ton wrappers. Instead, I decided on making my own fresh pasta and using a rippled edge cookie cutter to make the ravioli shape. It took a while. If I were going to do it from scratch I would have to start a 3pm to have it ready for dinner but so worth it. This is a great recipe! I gave the ravioli to others to try. They loved it!

I have never had such an experience with a dish.  Since I was having 4 couples over for dinner, I decided to “test” the ravioli before I served it.  Let me say that the filling was outstanding.   I placed one ravioli in a pot per directions (Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil) and within 2-3 minutes it had disintegrated. I was stunned and thought I did something wrong so I tried another – same thing.  Honestly, it was comical.  I was now in the Ravioli Twilight zone.  They were disappearing before my eyes.  To save the night, I had to go to plan B – rigatoni with homemade sauce.  Success!! Perhaps the ravioli should “not” be placed in boiling water?   Puzzled about this one so if anyone wants to shed some light I would very much appreciate it because as I said, the filling was great! Thanks!

This recipe is amazing. To keep the ravs from coming apart while cooking use a pastry wheel to seal the edges and when you drop these in the boiling water immediatly lower the boil to a simmer. I make a roasted red pepper alfredo sauce to go with these and I use portabella mushrooms. Fantastic!

Just heavenly. The best ravioli I have ever had. I have made them both with wonton wrappers and homemade pasta, and I actually liked the wonton wrappers better. Maybe because I steam them rather than put them in a pot of boiling water so they do not get mushy or fall apart. I'll save the fresh pasta for my lasagnas. Thanks for posting!!

Great filling!  I used thick wonton wrappers, available at asian market, and had no trouble with leaking ravioli.

The filling for this is yummy. I only used 3/4 of the marscapone & added some parmesan to make up the rest. I didn't have any problems with the wonton wrappers. Made tortillini shapes instead of ravioli (using just the one wrapper for each piece of pasta) and just had the water simmering instead of boiling.

This is a good recipe and fit to serve at a "fancy" dinner or gathering. I added some chopped deli-style ham to the mushrooms as they cooked and it was even better. Another variation I will try is to use smaller wrappers (or flat pasta squares or rounds) and serve as a companion dish to another main dish.

I make these every time I want to impress someone. They come out delicious every time! I skip the egg and milk, and just use water. It seems to hold the wontons together better. Also, wait for the mushrooms to cool almost completely before adding them to the cheese (which should be at room temp). Yum!

The mushroom filling is so very good. The entire family enjoyed this dish. It is very good with a variety of mushrooms. If you don't have a shallot some finely chopped onion works very well. For anyone that had issues with the ravioli falling apart in the water, it helps to bring the water to a boil and then turn it down to barely a simmer, then put your ravioli in the water. Most ravioli (even store bought) should be cooked in water that is simmering. Also after you seal the edges with the egg mixture take a fork and press around all the edges. Just make sure not to make any holes in the "pillow" part of the ravioli. Also, topping the ravioli with a nice pesto instead of a red sauce makes a lighter version of the dish. One comment about the recipe; the instructions are a little confusing. First it tells you to mix the mushrooms and cheese together and then instructs you to fill the ravioli with a spoon full of mushroom mix and a spoonful of cheese. For the record, I mixed the mushroom and cheese in a bowl and filled them with the mixture. Very nice.

Made it with the basic pasta recipe as well, because where i'm living in Spain, wonton wrappers are hard to come by. Very good. As people have said, the FILLING is scrumptious! Will try to make them again with the wonton wrappers. ALthough they were very difficult to make with the basic pasta, with the Simmering water (as people recommended) I had no problem with them falling apart. Note, i doubled the pasta recipe, and probably should have tripled it. I still had filling left over.

Woohoo, these are amazing, and I had to use dried thyme so I  imagine they would  be even better with fresh. I made tortellini  using only one wrapper for each. This is pretty labour intensive, so I doubt that I would make it for a dinner party, but cooking for 1 or 2 people would be absolutely worth it. Tnanks for the recipe!

I used a mascarpone substitute recipe from this site and made my own pasta. I found the filling to be a little sweet oddly enough. I think I would made the filling again, but use mozzarella and parmesan in place of the mascarpone. I topped the ravioli with parmesan, parsley, and diced tomatoes (canned for ease).

I agree with the other reviewers.  The filling is amazing but the won top wraps didn't stay together all that well when boiled.  I will definitely make these again but will make my own pasta next time.  I also used a roasted red pepper alfredo which complimented it all perfectly!

As I love everything pasta and mushroom, I had to take the challenge and make these raviolis. I must admit that the filling was just delicious but using the wonton wrappers was a failure. A lot of the raviolis would just open in the pot and turned out to be a bit soggy. I doubt I will make a second attempt at this but might just use the filling for a regular pasta dish.

this was ok.. took forever to make and I found the wonton shells floppy and not nicely flavoured. I will make my own pasta next time and this should improve this recipe greatly. Otherwise the filling was tasty.

Tasty.  I used the wonton wrappers and closed them with a pastry cutter.  It was easier to close once I did the egg wash on the top as well as the bottom.  The wetness helped.

I have made this many times.  It is wonderful.  You cannot overfill the wrappers or they will open, also the water should only be at a light boil.  I take one more step in the cooking process.  I heat the oven to 350 degrees and bake for 5 minutes then broil for 2 minutes.  Serve as normal.
They freeze great.  Place uncooked ravioli on a cookie sheet not allowing any to touch.  Place in freezer for a few hours then you can package in freezer baggies.

This was so yummy! I used the Basic Pasta recipe, formed ravioli and filled with this recipe to make a delicious rich dinner. I didn't have Marscapone so I used cream cheese, and subbed green onions for shallots. So tasty. You could really taste everything. It was restaurant quality. I will definitely make it again. I didn't even try to use wonton wrappers. Use the Basic Pasta recipe. Easier than I thought! I needed a sauce to top the ravioli and used the tomato cream sauce from Chicken Milano. My husband went nuts!!!

The filling for this ravioli was amazing.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants to make ravioli.  The problem I had was with the wonton wrappers.  At least 1/2 of them opened up in the water.  The 1/2 that survived seemed a bit slimey and I think this was due to using wonton wrappers rather than the normal pasta.  I am hoping to find another use for this amazing filling, but I won't be making this dish again.

Well worth the effort!! The recipe for the filling is perfect as written, although I did use my own pasta, not the wraps.  I'm sure they're great that way too.  I also made the Amazing Sun-Dried Tomato Cream Sauce (also found on this site) to go with them, and it was perfect!

I would not recommend this.  It feel apart when it went into the boiling water.  The filling was good though

I like to try all kinds of dried wild mushrooms, local mushrooms, exotic mushrooms. Anything goes. Also, I've taken to cooking the filling first, assembling, then sauteeing the raviolis on one side till lightly browned, adding a tablespoon of water, covering, and steaming them for a few minutes till tender, (keep each pan full in a warm oven, covered) rather than boiling them, which tends to burst at least two or three in a batch. Then dress with a brown butter sauce and parmesan cheese.

There's a lot of Mascarpone in this filling--maybe too much? It is also a labor intensive dish, not only because of the ravioli making but also because if you don't have a food processor then you have to chop the mushrooms by hand and that takes forever. Remember the mushrooms will shrink in the skillet, so the mushroom pieces don't have to be too tiny. I used shiitake.

The filling is superb!  I alter everything as to what is in the frig./cabinet.  Added a chopped sweet Italian pepper to mushroom.
Had pitas not wonton wrappers.  Nine inch pitas cut into nines.  brush with low cholesterol butter type product inside ( to seal) and out (to griddle).  The result: luscious pita ravioli/quesadilla wedges.  Oh m'gosh!

Although several of the ravs fell apart during cooking, the ones that stayed intact were really delicious. I made them with regular yellow onion, and a  combination of button and chestnut  mushrooms. I'm glad I didn't omit the fresh chives like I'd intended - they added a really nice flavor to the mix. Thanks!
