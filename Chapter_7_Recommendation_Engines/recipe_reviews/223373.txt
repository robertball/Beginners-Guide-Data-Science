YUM!! My family devoured this! Thank you for the recipe.... We doubled it since we were feeding 7.   Local grocery store didn't have beef rump on sale but did have beef stew meat on sale and that's what I used.  I did have to cook it a couple extra hours on high to have tender meat but that's because I used a different meat... Thanks HFDmedic we all really liked... nothing but Yummy from all 7!  I did use Jasmine rice with 6 tablespoons of butter (we doubled the recipe and had plenty of broth)and some Herb*Ox poultry seasoning (powder) which is the best!  Other than that I followed the recipe.  Thank you!

This is fine if you look at it as a basic way to cook a rump roast in your slow cooker. In my experience, it didn't turn out with much flavor, not even "beef" flavor. In short, it was bland and needed a lot more seasoning.

I'm not entirely sure what I would add, but definitely a lot more onion, some garlic, maybe some Worcestershire sauce. We're cooking a solid 2lb slab of beef - not much of that flavor gets to the interior, even with the extra hour after the roast is cut up. I took the leftover meat and braised it low and slow for about 3 hours in a broth including onion powder, garlic powder, some soy sauce, a little sugar... much more tender and flavorful.

I would also recommend using corn starch instead of bothering with making a roux. Much, much easier.

Pretty good, I also used stew meat instead and my family does not like mushrooms so I used onion soup instead and garlic powder. I will make again but next time will add some seasonings as it was a little plain but that's probably because I didn't use the mushroom soup with garlic.

I always use this recipe when making this dish. I also use stew meat and i always put a little Worcestershire sauce. I have tried this recipe with and without onion soup mix. I usually throw in some mushrooms as well. We also switch it up put it on top of mashed potatoes instead of the rice.

I used stew meat and I added baby portobello mushrooms. I added more beef broth and three beef bullion cubes. I cooked it on low for 10 hours.  I browned the stew meat a little before adding it to the slow cooker.  Next time I'll use two cans of soup because I had to double the flour and butter thickening mixture and only use the 32 ounces of broth.  I added fresh garlic to the chopped onions too as well as sea salt and quite a bit of ground pepper. My husband and son loved loved loved it!!!!

This tasted great. When I combined the ingredients in the crockpot, it did not blend well; next time I will whisk it together. When I made the gravy, I added more beef broth reserve, probably 1 cup total.

I made it with regular rice not the brown rice. I made the rice in some of the juices from the meat. Then the rest of the juice into gravy. It was fantastic.

This was good. I used 2 lbs of stew meat instead of the roast. Next time I'll skip the cream of mushroom with garlic and just add mushrooms and garlic to the broth and double the gravy.

Very boring.  This recipe needs other ingredients to be remotely interesting.  My family did not like it.
