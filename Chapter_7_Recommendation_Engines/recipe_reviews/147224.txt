This is like the recipe I have been searching for!  I love all the vegetables!  Fresh herbs might help season this more, but the flavor is fine   Next time, I will mix the veggies in a bowl, letting the juices drain out for about an hour, then will add to the mayonnaise mixture.  This was a little soupy for my liking, so I think that will help!

I have made this twice now. Both times, I got great reviews. The first time I used saffron mayo and gelatin with onions, cucumbers, tomatoes and bell peppers.  The second time I used onions, bell peppers and squash for the veggies and regular mayo. This dip is great with homemade bagel chips
