I've made this dish twice now. Each time it was completely gone, no leftovers! It feeds about 8-10 people easily. I took someone's advise and mixed 1/2 the cheese into the casserole then sprinkled the rest on top. I layered the pepperoni under the cheese so they wouldn't get crispy. One time I used the slice pepperoni and cut them into quarters. The second time I cubed the pepperoni. Both tasted excellent!

My family loved this recipe.  I did make a few small changes...after browning the ground beef and italian sausage and cooking the pasta, I put them, along with two jars of Bartoli Tomato & Basil spaghetti sauce, the mozzarella cheese and some parmesan cheese together in one large bowl and mixed them, before putting into 9 X 13 pan.  I also reserved about 1 1/2 cups of mozzarella to sprinkle over the top, along with some more parmesan.  I did not use the pepperoni because I felt there was plenty of meat and flavors already.  Very easy and very tasty!!!

This is absolutely delicious! And easy! I halved the recipe and it was still a lot. I thought that it was a lot of meat in the recipe, but I tried it anyway. Glad I did. It wouldn't have come out as good as it did. I did add a couple of things though.

1. garlic powder. season salt, and sauteed onions while browning meat. 
2. mixed some cheese in with the meat mix.
3. and sprinkled some parmesan cheese on the top with the pepperonis. 

Great dish. thanks Erin love!

This was awesome! I will make a few changes next time though: I used two of the 1lb 10 oz jars of spaghetti sauce. It wasn't quite 64 oz like the recipe calls for but it was enough! I used the traditional kind and ricotta cheese kind. Next time I think I will use the chunky garden vegetables kind, or chop up some green peppers to put in there as well. Also, I will mix cheese with in the pasta mix as well instead of just on top. And for the meat, I will use just a half pound of hamburger and 1 1/2 pounds of the italian sausage to add a little more spicey-ness to it! Lastly I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and sauteed them about 5 minutes before I put them in the mixThe auther says she halves it for her family and makes the whole recipe for family gatherings; She's right on! I was making this for just my fiance' and I and I decided to make the whole thing because we wanted leftovers since we don't cook a whole lot...we only ate maybe an 1/8th of it and we were FULL! Next time I will definatly halve the recipe and there will be enough still for a day or two for left overs. GREAT recipe! I will make again, it's a keeper!

A delectable, meaty dish--the only trouble I had was getting the entire casserole in a 3qt. baking dish, you might want to make 2 smaller ones and put one in the freezer :)

Yes this is delicious, but it does not resemble Manicotti. Manicotti are long tubular shells stuffed with ricotta cheese,egg,parmesan cheese,and parsley. When I have leftover pasta and tomatoe sauce, I mix in extras like olives and sausage, and top with mozzarella cheese, and bake it to reheat. It does not make Manocotti.

Great basic recipe. I added chopped green and red pepper to cook with the ground beef, along with chopped onion.  I also added in sliced black olives (you could also try green).  This recipe made enough for 2 9X13 pans. We enjoyed one and have one in the freezer.

Some of us call this type of dish just baked macaroni. There are a million variations on the theme. One key is to toss all the cheese on the macaroni right after you drain off the water. By doing this you spread the cheese all over the macs & it stays there. If you put the cheese in after the macs are sauced, the cheese floats in the sauce. It will never stick to the macs. Just a century old "hint".

Great recipe!  Very delicious and simple to make.  I used all sausage in mine since I made a half a recipe.  It was very tasty!

Good starter recipe to add your own touches. I am going to add dollops of ricotta seasoned with fresh chopped spinach, garlic and parmesan before the top goes on. Also leaving out the beef and using hot Italian sausage, garlic, oregano and fresh sauteed mushrooms in place of canned. We don't like the texture of canned mushrooms. Fresh are better for us. Update: I implemented the above changes for dinner tonight. It was delicious. For the cheese I used a 6 Italian blend and then added more parmesan over the top. Very good now!

Very good!  I'm a vegetarian and substituted the meat for Morningstar Crumbles, Gimme Lean "sausage" (in the tube form), and Yves "pepperoni."  My meat-loving boyfriend ate two heaping helpings while making "yum" sounds, and said he didn't miss the meat at all!  Much less fat and calories made that way as well.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic, oregano, and onions to the "meat" while it was sautéing, and added the mushrooms in for a quick sauté at the end as well.  I will definitely make this again!

I added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic (leaving out some of the spaghetti sauce). Very good and different. Defintely put the pepperoni beneath the layer of cheese, to keep it moist.

I love this recipe!  It is so quick and easy and good!  My dad, the carnivore, loved it.  My mom, the meat-isn't-everything, loved it.  I took some other reviewer's advice and halfed the recipe, which still made quite a lot!  I also found that it heats up nicely the day after and the day after and the day after!  Fantastic!

This is not manicotti-no ricotta chesse. But its delicious nonetheless. Very easy and inexpensive to make. I also added in garlic. The pepperoni gives it a great flavor. I put some into the meat mixture along with 1 bag of cheese,and put pepperoni on top then another bag of cheese. This is a keeper

In our home this is called "Pasta Bake". The only thing I add extra is cut up green pepper and a cup of parmesan cheese. I even made this for my sister's family while visiting them. The loved it too! Everyone that has ever been to our home and had this has loved it! If there are leftovers it never makes it to the next day. We serve this with garlic toast and a nice green salad. Cheap, quick, easy and it "tastes so good"!!

This was a very good recipe in that it was easy to assemble and my family loved it.  For those of you who are criticizing that it is not manicotti - you need to read the passage that the submitter of this dish  wrote next to the photo.  It's what his family nicknamed this dish.  Not really worth getting upset about, in my book.  A noodle is a noodle...LOL

This should never be confused with real Manicotti, its actually not even close to the real stuff!  It is however, cheap, fast, and delicious so I would say go for it if you are looking for something that fits that criteria.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  First, the quantity that this recipe made filled two casserole dishes, not one.  The calories, if counted as only 8 servings, is over 900 per serving.  Second, in my Italian family, manicotti consistes mostly of ricotta cheese & pasta, not beef, sausage or mozzarella cheese (at least not the main ingredients).  So, this recipe is not well named.  Third, I found the dish very heavy, greasy and overwhelmed by the sausage taste.  I won't be making this recipe again.

It was very easy to make and as the pervious its just a baked pasta dish but its an easy recipe and very filling.  My only problem is that its very high in calories, so i will only give it 4 stars.   However, I did swap the ground beef for ground turkey, and the regular pepperione for turkey pepperrione...and mixed alittle more cheese in there. Came out very yummie!

If i could give this recipe less than one star, i would. I did not care for this recipe. maybe this is good food if you eat fast food a lot or only eat stuff from a box. Overall, i will NOT ever make this again. you can find a better Italian recipe almost anywhere...

5 starts for flavor given the ease of preparation. Very easy, very pleasing and perfectly splits into 2 8x8 dishes...eat one tonight, freeze the other for later. I mixed mozzerella in the casserole and covered the pepperoni on the top with thin slices of Mexican quesadilla cheese.

This recipe is awesome. My boyfriend and I couldn't believe how good it was. Simple to make and so good. Wow. I halved the recipe (used half-pound pasta and only one meat, italian sausage and used 25oz sauce with meat) because there's only the two of us and it still filled my baking dish to the brim! Next time I will layer the pepperoni throughout the dish and do it more lasagna-style, where there are layers of sauce with meat and noodles, just to make it more even. I also seasoned the meat while cooking, I just couldn't bring myself to eat an Italian dish without garlic. ;) Delicious the way it is though!

I made this for dinner tonight and we thought it was delicious!  I made a few changes.  First, I used Italian turkey sausage.  Second, I did not use the pepperoni.  My family just doesn't like it.  I really like that I was able to make 2 pans and put one in the freezer for a night when I don't have time to cook!

Pretty good. I cut it in half and only used mild italian sausage.  Also used fresh mushrooms and sauted them in garlic and oil with an onion.   Mixed all the ingredients together including cheese then topped it with more cheese and parmasan.  My kid loved it.

This is an amazing dish. I didn't eat it since I am vegetarian but my family LOVED it, and I did make some few adjustments. I did not have any italian sausage on hand or pepperoni, so instead I just put in some salami, which worked great, and instead of the canned mushrooms, I had fresh ones, which needed using, so I just cut those up, cooked them for bit and worked great. I partially made my own sauce which I always feels adds something to a meal, and I used 3 different types of cheese, and mixed in half of it which the pasta, and added more on top. 
It was great and everyone loved it, will make again, and it is super easy and fast to make.

This was such a huge hit at home and at work! I have made it twice, one time I followed the recipe exactly, next I played with it a little - great both times. Try more veggies, less meat, more cheese, almost anything would work. We will do this again and again.

I was not pleased with this recipe. After reading comments-I also put some pepperoni and cheese,mixed with the meat and rigatoni. It was more like alot of pasta and no sauce.

I think it needed a little more sauce and I think it would be great if you mixed more pepperoni and chesse in the casserole, instead of just piling it on top.

This is a great, quick recipe. The family absolutely loved it. I made a few changes however. I used only 1 28ounce jar of spaghetti sauce, 1 12 ounce bag of egg noodles, mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, and parmesan cheese, pepperoni and a large can of stewed tomatoes. I also added in some season salt, garlic powder, black pepper and oregano. Without the beef and sausage, the spices were a perfect blend. It took a little longer to cook *(about 30 min total) but when it came out it was perfect. I would def make it again, maybe next with the ground beef.

We all liked this, but I think it would be better if just half the cheese was put on top & the other half of the cheese was mixed into the casserole.  1 1/2 lbs of cheese on top formed a thick, chewy layer that was hard to eat.

I am in the process of making this right now...I added a bit of Italian Seasoning and fresh garlic to the meat while browning. Also, I used 1/2 lb beef, 1/2 lb sausage, 1 lb rigatoni, 1 & 1/2 jars spaghetti sauce and 2 LARGE handfulls of mazzarella for a 9x13 pan Looks FABULOUS!

This was a very easy and tasty dinner. I added a few things with the hamburg and sasuage. I added green pepper, onions, and garlic. I also used lasagna as I was out of all other pastas. Worked well. Looking forward to trying it the second day.

The only change I made was to eliminate the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them.  Hubby is the PICKIEST eater ever and he absolutely loved this.  I will definitely make it again - it's so rare to have a hit like this in my house!

This was a hit with my 10 year old daughter! I  liked it too...it's more of a comfort food. I followed the recipe for the most part but I used penne instead of rigatoni, omitted the ground beef and used turkey italian sausage (yum!), and mixed some of the cheese and pepperoni into the mixture. The tastes and textures were great. Next time I'm going to add a bit of Ricotta. As a last note, many reviewers came down on this recipe as not being manicotti (which it isn't) but it shouldn't take away from the recipe/rating as a whole.

Everyone enjoyed this dish; It wasn't the usual (ho hum) pasta casserole.  I think it was the Italian sausage that gave it a heartier flavour.  I'm about to make it again & this time I'll add spinach to it.  It's one of those wonderful recipes that it never has to be the same thing twice!

This was a wonderful recipe!  I did however add premade meatballs in place of the beef, and added black olives and fire roasted tomatoes, along with small portabello mushrooms for the sliced reg. mushrooms.  Thank you so much for pleasing my family.

This was pretty good and the whole family enjoyed it. For those complaining about it being bland, I believe this really comes down to what sauce and what sausage you use. Personally I always use my homemade sauce which is full of Italian flavours, and for this dish I used a hot Italian sausage for a bit of a kick. My only complaint was I thought there was not enough mushrooms, and way too much cheese. I only used about 3/4 the amount of cheese listed and I still feel it was a bit much - will probably use about 1/2 the amount in the original recipe when I make this next time.

I made this yesterday for my son's college coach that came for a visit.  The sausage really made for a better flavor than ground beef alone.  I used 2 jars of marinara style spaghetti sauce which worked out great.  Everyone in my family really liked it. I also added some diced celery and a small chopped onion to the meat while cooking and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Since this is so meaty, I didn't use the pepperoni.  THANK YOU!!

This was really good It was nice and quick and gave us enough leftovers for lunch the next day. My family does not like sausage so I doubled the ground beef, I also added 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.  My son, who is a picky eater, really enjoyed this one.  I am giving it 5 stars even though I change it a bit because I think that if we liked sausage it would have been 5 stars.  Next time I am going to try doubling the peperoni, the flavor was a little bland since I did not use sausage.  We will be adding this one to our regular dinner menu.  Thanks.

It was good, little overboard on the meat. And I am a meet lover.

First time making this... It's pretty good. Mine ended up looking like lasagna. Tasty nevertheless.

My family thought this recipe was awesome!  I thought it would make a ton so I halved it.  It still made a whole 9"x13" pan full but to my surprise it didn't last long.  I think the next time I make it I will blend in some cheese and mini pepperonis into the main mixture.  Great recipe!!

This is a family keeper!  Anything with cheese and pepperoni is amazing!  I've made it lots of times - I've made AS IS and I've also made it by tossing the meat with the sauce; kind of like that better.  I usually cut my pepperoni into quarters - pepperoni goes further and you can ensure pep with each bite!  Yum!

I didn't care for this recipe too much. I just didn't like the flavor of it. My husband the picky eater said he liked the only complaint he had was that the rigatoni pasta was too big for this dish. My husband also said that he couldn't even taste the italian sausage in it so if I ever make this again I will just do it with ground beef and smaller pasta.

Was quick, easy and tasted good but overall is an average dish. It doesn't have a "wow" factor, but it will satisfy your families appetite!

I think this was delicious!(which is saying alot, being that I'm pregnant and this baby seems to be very picky!) And my boys loved it too!

I pretty much followed the directions exactly. Only thing different was that I mixed in half the cheese in the pasta, and the other half on top. 

I will say though, that I had to use my biggest casserole dish (4.8QT) and it was filled to the brim! Enough for left overs for possibly 2 nights. I might have baked it a little longer though to fully melt the cheese inside the dish though, but with a brute of hungry males in the house it did the job.

I loved this and so did my family! I made a few changes due to personal preference. Instead of using Italian sausage, I used plain sausage, because many of my family doesn't like spicy so i added some Italian seasonings salt and pepper to give it some missing flavor.I sauteed 1 onion and 1 green pepper chopped in with my meat combo. I also melted 8 oz of cheese with the meat before i put it in the pan under the noodle, cheese, sauce, and mushroom mixture. My family enjoyed this so well..it was a nice twist on plain sauce and noodles!

I'll give it a 3 out of 5 for now. I thought it was good but my husband thought he picked up italian sausage and it was turkey sausage italian flavored so I used 2lbs ground beef. But it was still good I know it'll be better when I make it the 2nd time and get the italian sausage!

Excellent recipe.  I had my family over and made this recipe tonight.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  It does make a lot. I bought a disposable 15x10 baking pan and it was perfect.  I did add some garlic powder and onion powder to the meat while browning, other than that followed the recipe exactly and it tasted wonderful.  This is a keeper and 'go to' recipe for a crowd.  Thanks!

Fabulous dish.  I made this for a dinner party for 12 yesterday, reheating for dinner.  At least half the guests had seconds.  I pretty well made it as written with the addition of some minced garlic. Next time I'll combine the meat, sauce, pasta and half the cheese - THEN pour it into the pan, cover with the rest of the cheese, and top with pepperoni.  I will definitely be making this again.  BTW, I served it with a green salad and the Parmesan Focaccia from this site.  Made for a great dinner and probably the easiest one ever.

Followed this recipe to a tee except I mixed 1/2 of the cheese into the sauce/meat mixture and put the rest on top as stated. This recipe is a winner! Delicious! Everyone loved it, Thank You!

I added some extra touches that really "made it" and followed other reviewers suggestions to multilayer in the cheese.  I added fresh basil, sliced tomatos, and some sauteed hot peppers.  YUM.

The kids LOVED this... my husband and I thought it was okay. The sauce could of used a little 'oomph' but we still liked it. When I looked at the box of pasta to buy, I was a little worried that there wouldn't be enough, but it was perfect for our family of 4... we even had some left overs! We used turkey for all the meat (ground turkey, turkey Italian sausage, and turkey pepperoni) and I was really happy with how it worked with this recipe. I will definitely continue to make this, but next time I will mix in some of the cheese in with the sauce and meat, plus have the cheese on top. I think that would really help the flavor!

This was very good but the original recipes lacks the spices that really needed to take this dish to the next level. Next time I will season the beef with saute onions, garlic, and italian seasoning and see if it makes a difference. Will make again though!

Very, very good!  Will make again & again.  Excellent for large gatherings or work pot luck functions. Of course, I added more cheese & extra sauce & mixed some of the pepperoni & cheese throughout & then added the rest on top before baking. Hummmm!!

We really enjoy this. It's like pizza pasta. You basically use what you want on a pizza but with spaghetti sauce and noodles. I use pork and green pepper and olives it in too. Turns out great!

Good for such an easy nothing to it dish. I cut this in half and left out the Italian sausage and added some Italian seasoning, season all, minced garlic, and dried minced onion to the meat when I cooked it. Only about 1/4 tsp of each just so the meat wouldn't be bland without the Italian sausage. I had to add a can of tomato sauce as there wasn't enough with only 1 jar. Maybe I eyeballed a little heavy on half the box of pasta? This was good and the family is looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

Wonderful meal.  Especially with a small salad and bread sticks.  I made this last night and it was a HUGE hit with hubby and kids.  This recipe makes A LOT and you'll definately have plenty of left overs.

We make a recipe very similar to this but add 1/4 cup of taco sauce for an extra zip. We also substitue with turkey pepperoni which cuts down the fat and in our opinion tastes better.

VARIATION: Based on other reviews of this being just another dish, I offer the following:I used Classico Sauce(1)Cabernet & Marinara w/herbs,(1) jar of Spicy Red peppers & sauce, and (1) jar of Spicy tomatoe & Basil sauce; 6 oz of Mancini fried peppers, 1/2 pack of Bella Sun Luci sun dried tomatoes, (2) garlic cloves,(1) med.size white onion, and (2) pinches of Tones Presti's Spicy spaghetti seasoning. I cooked the sauce (mixed with all of the ingredients other than the noodles) until the mushrooms were cooked.  Then, in a large slow cooker,I layered in the sauce, then 1/2 of the noodles, then cheese (Kraft five cheeses finely shredded) and continued layering until gone.  I also chopped pepperoni and cooked it in the sausage/ground beef, onions, and garlic.  To finish I layered the top with whole pepperoni slices and a final layer of the chese.  I let it cook for two more hours giving plenty of time for the pepperoni on top to add its flavour and the cheese to melt. It does make a full cooker, but the taste was far from bland, however if too spicy, add a few sugar cubes to taste.

I have never cooked before a day in my life and this recipe was easy, even for me. I would however recommend using all ground beef if you have little ones or heartburn. Great Recipe!

It was good and well received. However I don't know what size baking dish could hold the quantities called for.Also you might sautee some onions and peppers with the ground beef.

This was a nice quick meal on a weekday.  The kids enjoyed it, and I had added some extra spice and seasoning so my husband and myself enjoyed it too.  Had crusty italian bread and a ceaser salad to top it all off

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I just happened to come across this recipe and when I got home I actually had everything to make it. Although I substituted the Manicotti with Penne noodles and Instead of using Sausage and Hamburger, I used two hot sausages. It was extremely tasteful, both my Brother and my Fiancée LOVED IT. It makes so much food, that we ate leftovers for 3 days after!

Our whole family loved this. I only used 32 oz of spaghetti sauce, but it was plenty. The dish was still over flowing. This has such a unique blend of flavors that go so well together. Even our picky eating kids loved it.

I made this for the first time when I needed something I could make quickly.  Made a few minor changes. I used a pound of chuck, 1/2 pound hot Italian sausage, 1/2 pound sweet Italian sausage for the meat. I used 2 pounds of shredded mozzarella and mixed 1/2 of it into the meat mixture.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned (‘cause those are gross - just saying!). Used sandwich pepperoni and I sprinkled shredded Parmesan on the top.  Okay that sounds like more than a few, but not really.  3 people asked me for the recipe immediately.

Manicotti has absolutely nothing to do with this dish of baked macaroni with meat... Manicotti is (as someone else noted) long, tubular pasta, filled with ricotta, egg, parsley.. Alternatively, crepes can be made in place of the tubular pasta... No meat in manicotti!  Just because someone calls something by an incorrect name, then prints it - does not make it so!

This is not manicotti!  Manicotti is long pasta tubes stuffed with a mixture of ricotta cheese, egg, mozzarella and parmesan cheese along with spices like oregano and basil, similar to stuffed shells.  This is a pasta casserole with a good amount of meat, and topped with a lot of mozzarella.  You could use any kind of pasta for this.

Why isn't it called Rigatoni Italian Casserole?  I didn't like some of the recipe components.  I am going make using my own changes but thanks for the idea to create.

Call it what it is "Baked Rigatoni" aka Baked Ziti. Try it with your own sauce and fresh mushrooms, nice variation on the classic version

This is a variation (meat, mushrooms) on a baked ziti recipe. It is delicious. However, as was mentioned before by betszam, it is not manicotti! If you don't believe me, go to an Italian restaurant and order manicotti. I guarantee you won't get the above recipe.

Real Manicotti are crepes. They are not a boiled pasta. Very delicate and tender. Filled with a ricotta, parm, mozzrella mixture. My MIL of 30 years is 100% Italian, she spends hours making crepes for manicotti one at a time in her crepe pan, for our giant family!! She would call this baked Rigatoni

I didn't actually make this but feel the need to clarify that nothing about this resembles manicotti. It is a typical baked rigatoni or ziti kind of recipie though, except the pepperoni which is rarely cooked in Italian food, too greasy. Manicotti is traditionally made with crepes, ricotta cheese, mozzarella, parmesan, eggs, and parsley. There is never meat in manicotti, that would be cannelloni. I'm sure it's decent but I am a purist when it comes to Italian food.

This is a basic home cooked meal that my teen boys love!  So easy to prep and it's virtually foolproof.  I add ricotta if I have it, and I only use either ground beef or sausage, not both- but keep the pepperoni, it's what makes it a little special.  Thanks for sharing this!

Easy - cut in half, used 8 oz fresh mushrooms and threw in a can of tomatoes (since pasta sauce not sold in 32 oz jars around here). Also threw in a small can of sliced black olives.

This was great! I doubled it, making enough to fill an 11x7, two 8x8, and a round pie pan! I mixed the meat/spicy sausage in with the pasta, sliced the slices of pepperoni and layered on top with cheese over that. I DID end up adding more sauce to the batches I made with this the second day, as it was 'dryer' than the first batch I made for a friend, once it sat in the fridge (I like my Italian saucy!) I also used fresh mushrooms and added crushed red pepper flakes for added flavor. Crazy easy and very tasty - great option when you need a meal for someone who has given birth/lost a loved one, etc.

A quick and easy Italian-style casserole to feed a crowd in a hurry. It makes a massive amount. Unless you're feeding 8 big, hungry men, it could easily feed 12 when served with a salad and garlic bread or breadsticks.

YUM!!!! I made this last night for dinner. I have never been good at making Italian food. My husband took one bite and said "This is the best thing you have ever made" I did not cut the recipie in half. I just froze the other casserole. I did mix half the cheese with pasta before topping off with the rest of the cheese. We did not have any leftovers except for the other casserole that I put in the freezer.

This was pretty good and well received by the family.  I used hot italian sausage to boost the flavor somewhat.  I felt that the pepperoni was a nice addition.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, ERINLOVE65!

Really good.  Super cheesy and deliciously meaty.  My only "ehh..." is that for some reason the dish struck me as dry (as in "not moist").  That's probably a personal thing because my family raved about it - and it certainly wasn't enough of a concern to knock off a star!  This will be on our regular meal rotation for sure.  :)

WOW - more than half of your recommended daily fat intake.  Cut the cheese in half, and chose either 1 pound of sausage of 1 pound of beef, and this recipe becomes more reasonable, but still tasty.

Yummy..This is excellent.  This casserole is not at all calorie friendly, and a single bite proves it.  It's a real crowd pleaser, and one my family really enjoys.  We only use a Lb of cheese instead of the Lb and a half they ask for, half is stirred into the casserole, the other half tops the casserole.  Supper easy to make, and really good..cant go wrong with this recipe.

Easy, quick, and forgiving! We used 12 oz of rigatoni, a pound of Italian style turkey sausage browned with a tablespoon of minced garlic, 1 28 oz jar of sauce, 1 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano (drained), about 12 slices of pepperoni (quartered). Per others' comments, we mixed the pasta and sausage sauce mixture first, put half in a 2 quart casserole, spread some cheese (in our case, I was low on mozzarella, so we used some shredded jack and parmesan here), along with the pepperoni bits. Layered the rest of the pasta mixture on top and covered with mozzarella and a little more parmesan. Even my picky-eater 6-year-old asked for seconds. This would be an easy dish to use up all kinds of leftovers. I especially liked how using diced tomatoes added a little more texture and was less sweet than 100% spaghetti sauce.

This was pretty good.  Only added a little of the pepperoni but enjoyed the added flavor.   All of the jarred sauces seem to taste the same to me.  May try to make this again with homemade.

Holy cow!  This is a great recipe.  So easy to make and makes enough to freeze some for a later date.  We make this once or twice a month at our house.  Our 2.5 year old loves it as well.  We take the pepperoni's and cover the top completely when we bake it.  We love pepperoni in our house so we make sure that it is covered on top!  Made this at a friends house (minus the mushrooms...they don't like them) and it was still pretty good.  Thanks for the easy and great recipe.  I'm not a very good/experienced cook so if I can make it...you can to!

Fantastic! I used chunky vegetable pasta sauce, mixed half the cheese with the meat/pasta mixture, and placed the pepperoni under the top layer of cheese. It tasted wonderful! Even my six year old, who is as picky as it gets, enjoyed it. Thank you for the meal!

I made this for a pot-luck dinner. I was disappointed in the outcome. Not distinctly flavourful. There were leftovers that I ate the next day and by then the flavour was more enhanced. I won't make this again for guests. Ok for just a family weeknight dinner.

In the end, I think this came out looking like Baked Ziti. Still really good though.  I did take some suggestion from other people about adding more spice when cooking the meat.  I added onions, season salt, onion powder, a little sugar and garlic. I made it with Rao's rigatoni pasta and their Vodka Sauce!! OMG!! forget about it!!! it was so freakin good, I couldn't believe I made this!!! I mixed the pasta and sauce all and added cheese with the mixture before i poured it into the casserole dish. I wanted to make sure it was all covered.  Oh my husband loved it. I served it with a side of egg plant parm.

Delicious.  But I doctored it extensively and it was a lot of work and made an enormous amount.  I added herbs, garlic, and a ricotta cheese mixture.  And I left out the peperoni.  The result was unbelievably yummy.

I gave this a 4 with the variations I used.  I omitted the ground beef.  I used cut up turkey sausage as the meat.  I layered the dish with some cheese in the middle (pasta, pep., cheese, pasta, sausage, cheese).  I also used fresh mushrooms.  I made it the night before because I think pasta tastes better a day old.

This was very yummy! Not sure what casserole dish this was intended for, but it would not fit into a 9 X 13. I had to add a smaller dish for it to fit into. But besides that, my family loved this.

This recipe was A-W-E-S-O-M-E!  I added a can of petite diced tomatoes, some crushed red pepper, basil, onion, and garlic salt to the beef mixture after browning, which added some great flavor to the spaghetti sauce.  I also used the cubed pepperoni rather than the slices.  My husband and I both loved it, but beware that it makes a TON of food.  I ended up filling two baking dishes with one recipe's worth of ingredients, but it wasn't a big deal...we froze one so we can eat the rest in a couple of weeks!  Fast, easy, and delicious.

I have made this dish many times but found a way to take out about half the fat without taking away from the great recipe. Sub ground turkey for the ground beef. Sub turkey sausage for the regular sausage. Mix in non-fat cottage cheese instead of the mozzarella or ricota. Use some mozzarella only to top the dish. Easy,fast and a healthy alternative to a great dish. It also freezes well.

This was great, everyone loved it.. Only thing I changed was more fresh herbs and garlic when cooking meat and fresh mushrooms.. canned-- ugh.

My family loved it.  Maybe I'm slow since it was my first time to make it, but it took me much longer to get it all assembled & baked.  I'll try again & see if I can speed it up.  It definitely makes a huge amount.  I filled a 9x13 glass dish AND an 8x8 one as well.  You could easily cut it in half & still have plenty.  Great with a green salad & garlic bread.

This is a great recipe, but I use about a half pound less meat.  I have been making this dish for years.  It is actually called Baked Mostaccioli.

Super recipe. I used fresh ham & cheese tortellini for the pasta, and added red peppers, and black olives to the sauce.  Added 9% cheese only as the topping and a few salami slices. My husband had 3 helpings.  Easy, fast, and yummy!! Thanks for this one.

Very Good.  I did not put pepproni on it as we do not care for it.  I put in sauted green pepper in and I shredded the mozereela from two blocks (not fresh) of it, it seems to taste better than what comes in a bag.  I also used two jars of 26 ounce sauce and it was just right.

Im not a mushroom person so I left those out and added chopped onion and garlic in with the ground beef. It didnt really seem that much different than making spagetti sauce and adding it to some rigatoni pasta.

This is now one of my favorite recipes because it is so versatile.  I call it "pizza casserole" because i mix in my favorite pizza toppings like olives, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. I'm not a big meat eater, so I just use ground turkey and layer pepperoni throughout the casserole.  That way the spices from the pepperoni permeate the dish. I also serve it with parmesian cheese and add a side of garlic bread. Yum.

This was WONDERFUL. Even my picky 7 year old loved it (and unwittingly ate mushrooms). Very tasty and quick. Even better the next day reheated :)

This recipe is wonderful! I even used ground turkey and turkey sausage and low fat cheese and it turned out delicious. I will definitely make it again. I have never rated a recipe on here, but this was so good I felt I had to.

Absolutely delicious!  And so easy too!  The only suggestion I would make is to bake a little longer (maybe covered for a little bit)--the mozerella cheese wasn't fully melted.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This casserole was very good. Personally, I thought the italian sausage was a little strong. Next time I will use 1/2 pound of sausage and 1 pound of hamburger meat to suite my taste better. The pepperonis on top were wonderful! They were perfectly crisp! I also used only 1 jar of sauce and I thought it was just right.

This recipe was good.  I followed the directions.  I thought it was a little saucy.  Next time I will eigther add more pasta or less sauce.  Both the kids really liked it, as well as my husband.  Made great leftovers and was super easy to make.  I will make this one again

Was great!  Did not add the ground meat, just did the sausage, and worked out perfect for a family of four.  Had enough to take to work and share with co-workers.

Whole family gobbled it up - which rarely happens at my house. I used ground turkey and turkey sausage, 1 jar spagetti sauce plus 1 can tomato sauce, added basil, s & p, onion & garlic, mixed the mozzarella and pepperoni in and then topped it off with more mozzarella and pepperoni.  Husband said he likes it better than lasagne! Easy dish and what a hit! Thanks!

Yum! This made a nice 'quick and easy' to add to our dinner rotation.  I added ricotta cheese at the recommendation of other reviewers (about 8 oz) and had to divide the meal into two dishes because it was huge.  Three of us ate dinner and we have 2/3 left.  Goes great with nice bread and a salad.

This was an EXCELLENT dish!  I only made half a recipe and it made a huge casserole dish full (that I ate from for nearly a week)!  I left off the pepperoni, and used some onion, Italian seasoning and minced garlic, for a slight 'punch', but otherwise, made no changes.  I'm anxious to try it on my daughter when she visits from college soon!

It was great! Easy and simple to make; it also looked great. Kids loved it even my unexpected quest who ended up having second servings. There was nothing left over. I will start making this for our family gathings.

I'm going to give this 4 stars because it sounds great..but I really was just asking a question. If I'm making this meal for 2 people, should I cut the recipe ingredients in half? Also what size pan is recommended? I'm new to cooking and don't want to use something too small or too big. Thanks!

I used 1 lb. of ground beef and a little less than a pound of sausage, and fresh mushrooms. With the 1 lb. of pasta and 2 jars of sauce, my baking dish was overflowing! 1-1/2 lbs. of cheese seems like alot, but it came out really good! I will probably make this again, especially for potlucks.

It turned out amazing! I only used half the amount of red sauce and it turned of just fine. Really good stuff. (Season your beef) (;

This was really simple. My kids didn’t want the cheese. So half with and half sad.

I likes this very much. With only me I halved the recipe and plenty to freeze for another day.  I used homemade Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Yummy

Made minor changes.  Subbed out mushrooms for sautéed onions since hubby hates the shrooms.  Also added ricotta cheese on top as well as the mozzarella the recipe called for.  Hubby said the ricotta made the dish.  Lastly I mixed half the cheese in with the cooked noodles before adding noodles to the meat and sauce mixture as some other reviews recommended.  It was a HUGE hit and the family can't wait for me to make it again!

Deliciousness!     I used a half pound or more of rotini,  one pound of sausage, no beef.    Sauteed sausage with some chopped  onion and added italian seasoning and garlic powder.     Added about 1/2 cup of ricotta with eyeball amount of  mozz  to warm pasta and tossed all together.   Kept the pepperoni and mushrooms too.      So good.

Was really disappointed in this dish. Is it easy? Yes. Does it sorely lack in flavor? Also yes. It's edible but that's about it, I can make a far better italian dish. And this was even with me trying to doctor it up with fresh veggies, simmering the beef in their juices, and adding seasoning because the italian sausage may be seasoned but the beef isn't and the premade sauce always tastes better with a pick me up. Was not worth the extra work I tried to put into it. The hunt for a fabulous italian casserole continues...

Amazing. Added chopped green peppers, onions, clove of garlic, my own Italian season blend. A tbsp of cilantro. Cooled the noodles with a lbs of mozzarella. Layers. Layers.

It's a good base recipe for a casserole.  As other reviewers have noted, it's not really Manicotti, but it's good.   If you make this recipe according to the directions, a 9x13 baking dish will not  be large enough.   I used a 5 Qt baking dish (10.3 x 14.5) and it was just big enough.  

I substituted zucchini for the mushroom, because I had some on hand I needed to use.  I thinly sliced it and cooked on the stovetop for a few minutes before mixing with everything else.   

I will make this again.  It wasn't bland, but it could use seasoning.

very filling and lasted for several meals. i only used one jar of sauce, and left out the ground beef and mushrooms due to price and personal preference respectively. i tried adding spinach to make up for no mushrooms, but it didn't work too great, so next time i might try olives or another vegetable instead. overall an excellent meal that i would definitely make again!

I personally was not crazy about it. My family liked it. My husband said it was good and different because of the sausage. I mixed most of the cheese with the pasta, sauce, and meat. Then I sprinkled more Mozzarella and Parmesan on top and baked for 30 minutes. I don't think I'll make it again, unless my family asks for it. Sorry.

Changed: used egg noodles, mixed ground beef and ground pork, used canned tomatoes and 1 jar of salsa, used fresh mushrooms and fried them instead of canned. Now it's a 5 star.

This was great and super easy! I used extra lean ground beef since sausage is pretty greasy and drained very well before adding the sauce and heating through. Tossed the cooked/drained pasta in some Italian blend shredded cheese before incorporating the sauce and more cheese in a very large bowl. Transferred this mixture to a baking dish sprayed with nonstick spray and topped with remaining cheese. Sliced up pepperoni to get small pieces in each bite. This ensured everything was well incorporated and cooked evenly instead of a massive amount of cheese just sitting on top of the casserole dish. Serve with garlic bread!

Pretty bland even after I seasoned everything more than requested in the recipe. Nothing to go crazy over.  Pretty boring but it did the job I guess.

I made this for me and my boyfriend he loved it. He really likes sausage so he really liked the smoked sausage in it. I cut the portions in half and there was still PLENTY of left overs. I didnt use pepperonis this time (just because i didnt have any),  but will try them wit h it next time. Solid dish with lots of flavor and very filling.

I used ronzoni gluten free penne pasta, and just two jars of sauce and I added the sauce to the meat after browned.  I also added fresh grated Romano cheese to my sauce, did not use the mushrooms, then mixed the pasta with the sauce prior to added to the baking dish.  I layered half the pasta added a layer of mozzarella, added the remaining pasta and topped it off with the rest of the mozzarella cheese.  The dish was hearty, flavorful and a perfect choice for a cool fall evening.

It was so delicious! The only thing I would do differently if I were to make it again would be to cut the measurements in half. I made this for dinner for my 3 person family and we had leftovers to last days. However, I do think that those measurements would be good if you were going to make this casserole for a party. Otherwise, amazing casserole!

First time making and it was very tasty. I chose not to add the mushrooms. Also, I used Ragu’ tomato, garlic and onion sauce.

Easy peesy!  Doubled for 7 ppl.  Have plenty of leftovers.  Everyone LOVED it.  I love mushrooms but unfortunately my family does not so I left them out.  I mixed 2 packages of the Italian style  pepperoni in with the mixture v/s on top.  I browned a thin layer of mozarella and Italian bread crumbs on top!

My family enjoyed this recipe. I used sautéed fresh mushrooms instead of canned and also added basil, thyme and garlic powder to the meat as it was cooking. Accidentally bought manicotti instead of rigatoni, but I cut it up after cooking which turned out fine.

This was a huge hit with my family.  I did adjust the cheese as was noted in another review. Half added into the mixture and half on top.  I made the recipe using the ingredients/ amounts as listed and was able to feed 7 people (2 are teenage boys that are never full).  We didn’t have any leftovers but everyone walked away full.

I thought this was awesome !  I cut the recipe in half. Used hot Italian sausage links (2). Broke them up with the beef.
Will pass along to others.

Halved the recipe as there were just 2 of us.  Used some Fresh mushrooms I already had but followed it exactly otherwise.  Yumm.  So easy and we had 2 dinners and a lunch from it.  A keeper!

Delicious, definitely making this again! This recipe, as written, is for a very large family and/or gathering, next time I will cut it in half and should still be plenty for myself, my 3 year old and my father with leftovers. I used fresh instead of canned mushrooms, turned out great! However, very fatty, if you are looking to cut some out (albeit not that much) I would maybe just use ground beef with an Italian seasoning and omit the Italian sausage or omit the pepperoni. The cheese, pepperoni and Italian sausage combo can be very heavy for some. Next time I might try a few veggie toppings instead of pepperoni , e.g: onions, green peppers, olives etc. like a pizza.

Very easy to make, only takes 40 min to bake. All together it takes 50 min from prepping to table. If you like a little "kick" use Johnsonville hot sausage & Classico fire-roasted spaghetti sauce!

Great idea and being Italian I had to change a third of the cheese to ricotta.  It is titled Manicotti after all .

Good!  But 20 oz noodles is too much! 18 oz or less would be better. I used penne pasta. I also made a full batch but put half in the freezer for a quick easy meal later. I stirred sauce, mushrooms, sliced olives in with the meat mixture before putting in casserole dish.

I mostly followed the recipe and it was great. I mostly halved the recipe using fresh sautéed mushrooms and just a half lb of hot Italian sausage and the pepperoni, mixed some cheese into the casserole. Even no complaints from my picky eight year old and he complains about everything but mac n cheese

Delicious! I did not add mushrooms. Instead, I substituted with green peppers and onions, which I put in with the meat after it was brown. I also substituted turkey instead of beef to make it healthier. Just a tip, I had to use one 9x13 glass pan and one 8x8 pan to fit everything!

Fantastic simple recipe. Takes less than 30 minutes of prep time before you throw it in the oven and then you've got a filling meal with plenty of leftovers for when you're in a hurry and don't want takeout. I make this about twice a month, it's become a staple meal for when I'm on the road.

I have made this twice already.  Each time I halved the recipe.  It made plenty.  The only things I added was a green pepper and a medium onion.  Great recipe and the leftovers taste better.

Made no substitutions. I was surprised by the complexity of flavor given simplicity of the recipe. We had it for leftovers next day and it was gone. Will make it again and again and again.

This has to be one of the worst recipes I've made. I guess our standards are higher than most. We actually threw it out.

Tasty and easy, doesn't get much better than that :).  I used smaller amounts of the meats than called for and it fit in a 9x13 just fine.

This is so good. I didn't cook the mushrooms before which I'll do next time. But they still taste good!

It looks delicious and I am going to make it. But it is not Manicotti. Manicotti is a larger tube shaped pasta that is stuffed with cheese.

Great, easy, week-night dinner to replace the ol' stand-by spaghetti. As I assembled it, I divided it evenly between two disposable 9X9 metal pans. I put one in the oven for my family of four and one in the freezer for another day! Tip - remove the skins from the Italian sausage.

I had mixed emotions about making this recipe because of its reviews and I am so happy that I made it. It was delicious, cheap and quick. I like how other people said that it was good for people that likes fast food and to all the respect people need to stop being so ignorant. Recipes are a base for you to have an idea if you want to add veggies to make heartier by all means do so but dont be rude and write negative comments just because you are too incompetent to come up with your own creativity. You find a recipe and tweak it to your taste.  I used all the meats it said, fresh  mushrooms, spinach, onions, garlic and peppers!! And I am thinking of making it again with more veggies...  It was delicious and different!!

Will definitely make again. Made a couple of changes. Used fresh portobello mushrooms and cooked along with the sausage and beef along with garlic and Italian seasoning. Next time I think I will use a smaller pasta, possibly rotini.

Absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe except I added some chopped white onion and garlic to the meat, and sauteed fresh mushrooms. I also put the pepperoni under a layer of cheese.  I was concerned it would not all fit in one  9x13 as some reviewers stated. But it fit perfectly. So tasty and filling!! I will definitely keep this recipe! Thanks!

I have a larger family, so I nearly doubled up on the recipe, as I usually do for every recipe. Added extra pound of ground beef plus 32 more ounces of spaghetti sauce (different flavor than original 64oz).  Used a large baking dish and followed the simple directions. Added extra sharp cheddar cheese on top of mozzarella because of my own preference. I also mixed cheese throughout the mixture. Turned out great. Served with Texas toast and salad (buttermilk ranch dressing on the salad blends well with this main dish).  Have plenty left over due to this being such a hearty recipe.

I made this for my daughter and niece for our regular fortnightly dinner, it was absolutely delicious! I couldn't buy Italian sausage from my online shop, so I found a recipe to make it, which took no time at all. I made half the recipe, oh my...that was enough for us plus seconds for one of us tonight, me tomorrow and another dish to take home  for my three grandchildren tomorrow...if I'd made the whole amount I wouldn't have had a big enough frying pan to make it in, only because I too found it easier to mix it altogether in the pan and transfer it to the dish. I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it, I imagine I'll be asked to pass the recipe on, I'm definitely going to send it to my son, he loves cooking.

I was afraid it would be bland so I used hot Italian sausage and spicy red pepper spaghetti sauce. It was flavorful but next time I'll use more sausage and less hamburger.

Served to my friends and family and they wanted the recipe, that's always a good sign! It was an easy dish to make, I used Delallo marinara  sauce 1 jar  and 1 jar spicy arrabbiata sauce they are only 25.5oz each but was enough.  The little bit of heat is what made it great! Makes a lot so I froze the leftovers can't wait for the day when I have nothing planned to cook and I  pull out this delicious meal!!

I halved the recipe as suggested by others. I only used the Italian sausage, as we like spicy. It was just ok to me, my husband liked it. But I think I'll stick to other recipes we both like more.

good comfort food and a guarantee for the kids liking it. I used venison burger instead of hamburger. I did leave the pepperoni out of the dish as it too salty for me. If I were to make it again, I'd add some italian spices.  The dish does make a lot so I put it into two different dishes, one for now and one for the freezer for later. I love that part!!

Pretty good. Used fresh mushrooms instead and it turned out pretty good. Huge portion, probably enough for ten.

This recipe is simple and tasty. Perfect for working moms. But a couple of things I always forget: 1.) the serving sizes in the recipe are way off- I always cut it in half to make 4 and it's still enough for 8-10. Here's hoping I never make it with the portion listed & I end up with food for almost 20. I have to remember to cut to 2 in order to get a serving size for 4. Lol. 2.) the spaghetti sauce flavor you use matters a lot. Go for your favorite flavor. My gut always says go traditional & then after I make it I always say I should've used something garlicky & cheesy. Still a very handy recipe for lazy days.

This was very quick and delish.  I used Rao marinara sauce I picked up at Costco.  This dish would truly serve a crowd.  My husband and I  ate it for dinner and then took leftovers for our lunches. Still had a ton leftover.  We finally got rid of it by sending a lot home with the fellows that are remodeling our house. They loved it too.  Next time I will half the recipe.

This was really good and makes A LOT of food. I will def. be making this again.  I made a few adjustments, though:

-Instead of using 2 32oz jars of spaghetti sauce, I used 2 23oz jars... this may have just been a typo. I recommend garlic tomato. 

-I substituted the mushrooms (ew) with two bell peppers (one red, one green)-Julienned.  

-I went half mozzarella half swiss for the cheese.

This is a winner.  Made it last night in two pans, still have leftovers for our family of 3 from the one I baked. I froze the other one for next week.  The only thing I really did differently was to mix half the cheese, half the pepperoni (cut into fourths) in with the sauce, add some garlic and Italian seasoning, and then top with pepperoni and cheese per the recipe. It was delicious.

Great basic Italian casserole.  Very easy to make and my daughter loves it.  I might add some ricotta to break it up a little bit.

We will definitely make this again but next time we will follow the tip about adding some of the mozzarella into the pasta mixture. Still delicious though.

I don't make a lot of pasta dishes, but made this the other night and it was a great success. I love it for 2 reasons, it was quick to make and it tasted great. The family loved it, even as left overs, what little there was. I will be making it again soon!

I will definitely make it again. I will say, when it said Manicotti, I thought it was going to have the cheese mixture. It was still REALLY good, but I will make the cheese mixture, and see how it is.

Big hit with the kids and really easy to make.  Cut up sausage (brown before cutting, then cook) is better than just the ground meat.  Heat the spaghetti sauce before mixing or it'll likely not be hot after only 20 minutes of cooking.

Recipe concept is very good and tasty.  Tweaked it a little after reading some reviews.  It does make a lot, wished I would've considered that when reading other reviews.  I mixed the cheese in the recipe rather than on the top.  Mozzarella does not melt into the sauce as other cheese would but it still tastes great.  I also increased baking time considering the cheeses were mixed in.  I would've liked the recipe to be more specific with the baking pan size and how much pepperoni to put it.  Trial and error I suppose.  All things considered, very tasty!

I  added some chopped pepperoni and a little cheese into the mix, plus added some more herbs to spice up the sauce. It's a easy, quick casserole with lots of possibilities.

My family loved this dish.  It was made exactly how it was listed and it turned out great.  I do agree "Manicotti" should be removed from the name.  It is a definite "make again" as it was easy and the taste delicious.  Guaranteed to become a "go-to" dish when craving "Italian"!

I added a Italian Seasoning, a little garlic powder, and basil.  I omitted the pepperoni and mixed in half the cheese with the pasta, with the rest of the cheese on top.  Family loved it.

Topped w/Fresh grated Parmesan & sliced Pepperoncini. 
Next time I may try adding in some diced eggplant.

I tweeted it using Rotini instead of Manicotti, mixed some diced onions in with the ground beef and Italian sausage and layered it with the cheese much like Lasagna finishing off with the Pepperoni on top.  My kids loved it with Garlic Bread on the side.

Great recipe for the large group. Easy and inexpensive. Followed recipe pretty close but used less sauce (2 Twenty Oz jars)and added fire roasted diced tomatoes to make up the difference. Mixed it all together in a bowl before putting into the baking dish. Everyone loved it, fed 8 easily.

Excellent recipe! Hubby loved it. Says its better than restaurant lasagna. First of all, I divided the recipe in half and used a 9x9 pan. Used hot Italian chicken sausage store brand instead of regular Italian pork sausage and added fresh minced garlic and diced onion. I added some grated Galbani mozzarella with the meat and pasta. Used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I cooked them in the fry pan I sauteed the ground meat in. I used gluten free rigatoni also since I can't have wheat. Mixed meat, cheese, mushrooms and pasta together. Sprinkled a bit of Italian/Pizza seasoning over meat and pasta.  Put the pepperoni on top of meat/pasta mixture then added the rest of the grated cheese. Sprinkled freshly grated Parmesan cheese over top and lightly sprinkled on a bit more Italian/Pizza seaoning. Baked for 25 minutes and it was wonderful!

Considering the entire tray was gone in one sitting I would say it was a hit.  I used fresh mushrooms, mixed mozzarella into pasta as some suggested and I had ricotta so thru in a half cup along with about 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.  Delicious!!

A quick casserole with big flavor that serves more people than indicated! This meal  satisfies a healthy hunger and doesn't disappoint! Serve with garlic toast and a Caesar salad.

I LOVED THIS! 

My changes: I halved the recipe, because I'm only cooking for two people. I also omitted the ground beef because three meats seemed a little bit much! I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and I sliced the pepperoni and mixed it in instead of using it as a topping. 

I also slathered a little sour cream on top of my portion, because I have a real problem. 

This was a huge hit for dinner. Served with steamed broccoli and garlic bread.

Delicious, ate it 2 days in a row it was so good!  I did add small curd cottage cheese (like it better than ricotta) so it tasted more like lasagna.  Thank you for the great recipe!!!

Holy Cow!!! That's a lot of meat!!! But this was a good recipe and it made a ton!!! 
I left out the sausage because hubby and I can't eat sausage. I cut back on some of the cheese and added some Hunts diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano and seasoned the hamburger with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder. when all is said and done this is one hearty meal, it was a breeze to make and it tasted great! Thanks for sharing this recipe with all of us!!

I made this as close as possible to the original recipe. I only had a couple of changes due to what I had on hand. I used one pound of sausage and one half pound of ground chuck. I used a 48oz jar of spaghetti sauce, and 16 oz of cheese. This made one 13x9 and one 8x8 dish and will serve my family twice. It kind of tastes like a mix between pizza and spaghetti.  It is a great recipe, we enjoyed it very much. Thanks for sharing!

A good basic casarol dish.  I add Italian seasoning, onoin  and fresh mushrooms to the meat while it was browning.  I also used mixed Italian cheese instead of just mozzarella.

Thanks Erinlove65!  This was very easy to make and yet a very delicious hot meal!!!  Next time I will mix in some cheese into the pasta in addition to putting it on the top.  The pepperoni and cheese on top give it a hint of pizza taste with pasta which was an interesting taste.  My family really enjoyed it!

I made  this and my family gobbled it up.  The only change I made was leaving out the hamburger and using hot sweet Italian sausage, keeping that amount the same.  So less meat, but it was plenty.  The sausage really packed a punch, and I think more meat would have taken over the flavor  of the dish overall.  I garnished my serving with crushed red pepper flakes, and my husband who already eaten his was sad he didn't think of it.  It added a little extra zing.   I will make this again, and again, and again..:)

This was delicious!  Followed directions as written but used honey garlic sausages for a slightly sweeter taste.  I will definitely make this again.  Very easy to do.

Awesome, easy quick night meal for the family!! I made it but with healthier ingredients...ground turkey, turkey sausages, reduced fat cheeses. Nobody noticed the differences from meat filled casserole.

for flavor, and easy cooking, Id give it a 5 star rating. It was delishhh.. and easy to tailor to your personal preferences. But for something called "manicotti", I have to give it a 1 star. I was really expecting more ricotta, cheesy,  parsley, garlicy taste. this is simple, spaghetti dinner in casserole form.

I used 1/2 the ingredients, added more  slicedveggies and followed advice of a user to bury the sliced sausage under the top to avoid it drying out. I also added 1/2 the cheese in the casserole,  then made it more cheesy by adding 1/2 cup of ricotta ( like a lasagna). Success- it is moist and looks great.

Where's the ricotta cheese. Manicotti has ricotta in it. I make this but make my own sauce with pepperoni and onions and garlic. Brown the meat which is pork and beef, no sausage and layer everything and bake, kind of like lazy lasagna. Delicious

Delicious!  The only changes I made was that we use whole grain pastas so I used a mixture of rigatoni and spaghetti which my family made comment about how they liked the spaghetti.  I was told to definitely put this on the rotation!  Also, I made enough for 8 people... I have a daycare with 10 children.  After my family of 3 ate to our hearts content, I still have a ton left over and will be serving it for lunch to the daycare kiddos.

I am not fond of mushrooms so I decreased the amount of mushrooms. I also decrease the amount of spaghetti sauce because I'm not fond of tomato based foods...but it was delicious and my kids devoured it! Paired it with Texas Garlic Toast!

Disappointing, this recipe had so many positive reviews, and the ingredients sounded good...However it was not very good, and reminded me of my school lunches 50+ years ago.  Only one reviewer really disliked this pasta dish, said you could find a better Italian recipe anywhere. I thought she was being really harsh, but I have to agree with her dislike...it was a waste of time and ingredients! Our eight year old granddaughter liked it, but no-one else found it appealing.

Instead of using a pound of beef and Italian, I used two pounds of mild Italian sausage. Before I put the cheese on top, I put a layer of pepperoni, then put the cheese on and more pepperoni It was delicious, and i'll make it again.
I also used two jars of Italian sausage spaghetti sauce.

I made this twice in one week.  My family loved it.  The recipe is super quick and easy to assemble.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added fresh mushrooms.   The second time I made it I used only Italian sausage.  It worked out fine.  Someone mentioned that they mixed some of the mozzarella in with the pasta.  I will do that the next time I make it.  This is a winner!

Really, really good. Mad the recipe as is, and ate it every day for two weeks (it makes a LOT). I mixed in a lot of the pepperoni, and half the cheese, and put the rest on top (cheese over pepperoni) and added shredded cheddar to the top, as well. I don't like mushrooms, especially the canned ones, but for some reason I didn't mind them in this dish. If you're a mushroom fan, I'd go with fresh mushroom's instead.

I changed the noodles to Rigatoni, minused the mushroom, and used turkey burger instead of Italian sausage! I added an Alfredo sauce to the top and it was amazing! Everyone in the family loved it and I'll definitely make it again!!!

This was a hit, I didn't add mushrooms because no one likes them except me (I didn't even have any anyway) and my oldest son said it tasted just like pizza. Next time I want to add the mushrooms and see how it comes out. It was very saucy but that's what I wanted. I didn't have rigatoni so I used a penne type pasta, it came out a little too mushy so next time I will definitely use the rigatoni. This is a keeper.

This recipe was awesome! I made it for my hubby and he loved it. Next time I would mix the cheese in with the noodles a little bit, but other than that it was great. Very easy to make.

KIDS LOVED IT (and I have heard my husband specifically bring this dish up in conversation multiple times now). Changes I made were: add some salt and pepper, add a TON of fresh basil (I use the fresh tubes of it), omit the mushrooms, add some cheese into the pasta mix, and place the pepperonis underneath the layer of cheese. For the pasta sauce, use one jar of tomato basil and one jar of chunky vegetable. I also used Ranzoni's Garden Delight pasta, which adds to the flavor. It came out a huge hit.

Very basic ingredients, very quick and easy to make. I replaced the pepperoni with sliced salami I found. I also ran out of mozzarella cheese, so I replaced that with Swiss cheese I had leftover. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese for taste and my husband had 3 servings. He couldn't get enough.

My family really liked this recipe.  I forgot to buy ground beef so I used 2 pounds of mild italian sausage instead.  That was a huge hit!  Mushrooms will never find their hideous way into my life (just mentioning them makes me ill!) so of course they were omitted.  I happened to be making another recipe at the same time and as I was adding minced onion and minced garlic to it, I added some to this recipe (Manicotti Italian Casserole) as well.  I really think it added some much needed flavor to what could potentially be a bland casserole.  As other reviewers suggested, I layered the baking dish with the pasta mixture on the bottom, then a layer of mozzarella, pasta mixture, pepperoni, and then a generous helping of mozzarella on the top.  Came out of the oven looking awesome and I'm certain the other 4 members of my family I delivered food to, will love it as well...I hope ;)

Great recipe for a big gathering.  Several things I did to tweak the recipe.  I added Oregano, Basil Leaves and Crushed Red pepper to add the 'Italian' taste.  I only used one jar of 45 oz Pasta Sauce and I think any more sauce would make the casserole soupy.  Throw in a loaf of warm bread and a glass of wine and a wonderful meal.

I didn't put the mushrooms because I simply forgot to buy them.. but did add green peppers and onion to the ground beef/sausage... and used 1/2 sauce and 1/2 diced tomatoes..  it was DE-LISCH!!  and like everyone else said - be prepared to need 2 dishes for it.  It makes a TON!

I made this according to the recipe the first time (with the exception of mixing about half of the cheese in with the pasta mixture and the rest on top.  It was great.  Since I have such a hard time getting veggies down my kids, the second time I made it, I used ONLY vegetables in place of the meat.  I sauteed chopped onion then added chopped zuchinni, yellow squash, mushroom, eggplant, some Italian seasoning just long enough to soften them a bit before I mixed the veggie mix into the pasta ... topped it with cheese and popped it in the oven.  The kids dug in and NEVER even realized they were eating veggies.  One for MOM!!!  Thanks for the recipe .. it's a keeper.

This recipe has nothing to do with manicotti. Why it would be called that is beyond me. Pizza casserole is more like it.   Definitely stir together first, then layer some cheese in the middle. I used all ground turkey, turkey Italian sausage and turkey pepperoni. I used penne instead of rigatoni.  No mushrooms. It was well received at the potluck I took it to and easy to do. Could use a little more zip to it. Onion, garlic, basil and maybe some red pepper flakes.

Loved the Manicotti..  Needed more of a zip for our taste buds though.  I will be adding hot sausage next time.  It sure was meaty though.

This tastes very similar to a great lasagna if you use your favorite sauce. (My favorite is the Classico Four Cheese sauce, to which I add minced garlic and a bay leaf while I simmer it in advance.)  To be honest, I hate mushrooms and therefore omitted them. I likewise used mini pepperoni slices because I had those on hand already, and stirred them into the pasta/sauce mix so they would not burn or curl up.    The other thing I changed was that I mixed some of the mozzarella (which I was running low on) with some ricotta cheese I had on hand, added some Italian seasonings to it along with a beaten egg and some more minced garlic, and then dolloped this mixture into this dish,  topping it all off with the remainder of the mozzarella. I highly recommend this method for the cheese, especially if you love garlic like I do.   This is a highly adaptable dish I will be making again and again.

This was an excellent dish. I wouldnt call it manicotti though because it uses rigatoni noodles first of all and second manicotti is a stuffed shell. Anyways this tasted great. I didnt add mushrooms and i added onion, garlic and olives to mine. I made this recipe just like it states and i wouldnt change anything about it.

I made this for my husband and a few of his friends and they loved it! It was easy and delicious. I will be making this again but next time I think I'm going to mix some cheese into the mixture as well as on top.

So. Much. Meat. My boyfriend and I made this over a weekend, and by Monday we both thought we gained 5 lbs in pasta weight. Extremely tasty and worth a few extra calories.

awesome recipe!  I have had this a few times. One time I chopped up some pepperoni and added it to the rest of the ingredients rather than putting it on top.

This is really good AND easy to make!  I half this recipe.  I also put half of the noodles/meat in the baking dish and then layered italian blend cheese and some pepperoni then added the rest of the noodle mixture and then topped with cheese and pepperoni.  I added a little garlic salt to the spicy Jimmy Deans and turned out delicious!  Great recipe and paired nicely with some homemade garlic bread!

Awesome!! I used the whole package of Italian Sausage (1.25 lbs) and just the one pound of Ground beef, and used Prego as my spaghetti sauce and OMG it was great!! I will definitely make again. I will add I did not need the whole 16 oz of pasta, but I used about 3/4 of the box.

I made this for my family after a day of working in the garden and really appreciated how easy it was!  We all thought it was good (even the 1 y/o who ate some of the noodles) but that for my spicy loving family it needed a little more flavor.

My picky daughter loved this. She asked me to put the recipe in the cookbook I am making for her for when she grows up. I did leave out the Pepperoni and the Mushrooms. I am the only one that likes mushrooms so I had to live withouth them. Very easy to make.

This was the second time I made it, and it was even better.  I made the calculated the recipe to 4 servings and it fit perfectly in a 10x10 dish.  Used 15 slices of extra thin pepperoni from deli.  The first time I made it my wife ate the pepperoni b4 I could use it in the recipe.  She thought it was salami. Use PLENTY of mozzarella cheese and make sure its bubbly.  Fed 6 adults to rave reviews.

Decent, I would have used less Itallian sausage though next time I think. Also the calorie count on this is through the roof so it's not something to make all the time anyways

This turned out to be very, very easy and quick to prepare. My family loved it and I have now added it to my recipe box for good. I love recipes that can be made even on the busy nights of the week and taste like I still cared! Thanks for this one, it's a keeper.

I left out the sausage just because I didn't have any on hand.  I added a lil minced garlic, garlic powder, and garlic salt.  When I cooked my groundbeef I added sage.  This meal was really good my kids LOVED it!

I started by halving this recipe to serve 4.  I used fresh mushrooms and added a small zucchini (diced) as well as a stalk of celery (chopped).  When browning the beef & sausage, I added fresh minced garlic (1 clove) as well as 3 chopped green onions.  I also seasoned the browned meat mixture with salt & pepper.  After mixing all ingredients together, I added approx. 1/2 tsp of dried oregano & dried parsley flakes.  Also doubled the grated mozza cheese for coverage in a 9 x 13" casserole dish.  Overall, good recipe, but a little bland.  Could be seasoned more with a hot Italian sausage (I used mild) and fresh spices.

I couldn't wait to try this recipe and when I did my family just loved it.  I think next time I am going to add some asparagus or some type of veggie.  We really enjoy veggies at our house and that is really the only thing missing.  Oh yeah I also added some fresh Parmesan to it after it was done cooking.

LOVED This!!! Of course today you can't find 32 oz. jars of sauce so I used 2 1/3 of 24 oz. jars and 1 lb of cheese was plenty.  It makes a lot so I had to move it to my roasting pan.  It made at least 10 servings...the kids loved it! You can also add whatever you like to this...it is a very versitile recipe.

This was very simple and good but my husband and I weren't crazy over it.  It tastes like a pepperoni and sausage pizza.  Green bell pepper would be a nice addition.

I have made this dish many times and never had any complaints. I did change it up a little bit thought. I only use one small bag of cheese and I mix it in with the other ingredients along with putting some on top of the pepperoni. Love this meal I'm so glad I found it.

VERY easy and delicious! I used basic Ragu traditional sauce, but I'm sure the sky's the limit with the varieties out there. Definitely follow the "lightly salt" the pasta part because there is plenty of it in the meat and pasta sauce (unless of course you make your own). I HIGHLY recommend this to a beginner. I scaled down to 4 servings but it made about 6.

I loved this recipe... I prepared it just as written, with only a couple of changes.  I layered all the ingredients just like lasanga, that way the meat was all the way through, not just at the bottom.  Next time I will use less pasta.  I used a 10X13 baking dish and couldn't use 1/3 of the 1 pound it called for. As for the name, I wouldn't include manicotti in it b/c it doesn't use ricotta cheese or pesto.  I would stick with Italian Casserole.  It's the perfect name!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was fine. It was easy to make, but just didn't seem very unique to me. I used my homemade spaghetti sauce in place of the jar. It just seemed like my normal pasta dish with melted cheese and pepperoni on top. I did really enjoy the italian sausage though.

I made it exactly as is and it was just OK.  I really liked the pepperoni addition but I thought it could use some additional seasonings.  I will still probably make this again because it was quick to throw together and these are ingredients I usually have on hand.

Delicious! I'm new at cooking, and this was really easy.  My fiance loved it!  The only change I made was to mix about  a third of the cheese into the pasta.  My only problem was it was a huge casserole.  I'll make a half batch next time for the two of us.

This was easy to put together and my family liked it fairly well. It made an enormous amount, I would say closer to 12 servings than 8. One of my daughters liked it just as is, my husband felt he would have liked it better if it didn't have pepperoni and was spicier, and my other daughter didn't like the pepperoni or the mushrooms, but I just can't please her. I may try this again without the pepperoni and in a smaller quantity, maybe with some green pepper. Thanks!

Only made half the recipe with 1 1/2 lb. ground hamburger, 1/2 lb. pasta, 1 jar spaghetti sauce, and half a package of sliced pepperonis. Pretty quick and easy to make. Thanks.

I took this to a church dinner. (Needed something easy) Everyone raved about it.  I did add some minced garlic, crushed peppers (just a lil) and A LOT of cheese. I also mixed cheese in with the noodles and sauce.

My husband really enjoyed this - what's not to love?  He wants to add pepperoni throughout next time.  We'll see...  Not the healthiest dish, but anytime my husband WANTS to take leftovers for lunch the next day, I know the recipe's a keeper.

My wife and I quite enjoyed this dish. Used 48 oz. of spagetti sauce since 64 oz. looked like too much. The dish is a bit heavy due to all the meat and pasta, but still tasty. Green and red peppers would be a nice addition.   (NOTE: this dish shouldn't be called "manicotti" since it calls for rigatoni, right?)

This recipe was really delicious! I cut the recipe in half because it was just my husband and I eating, and it still filled up a 9x13 pan. I used turkey pepperoni to save on some calories. I will definately make this agsin. Thanks!

In my desperate search for something to make for dinner I came across this recipe before I left for work. I am giving it five stars for ease of preperation and being super kid friendly. Every one liked it. It made a lot though. I would say the only drawback is that that it was a little pricey for a casserole. Thanks for the great weeknight meal! It was a lifesaver!

I'm giving it 4 stars, but my kids and husband told me to give it 5.  They really liked it.  Yes, it was tasty, just not a very "mature" taste.  Nevertheless, it's a family-pleaser.

Made this for the family and was happy that it was enough to feed all of us. I prefer to use fresh mushrooms rather than canned and diced a few garden tomatoes and served on top. It was delicious!! Will definately make again.

My pickiest eater came back for seconds! I was very happy. The changes I made were: I used spiril noodles & penne. 1 jar of spaghetti sauce instead of the 2 it called for. I added mushrooms, onion and bellpepper. I will make this again it was a hit with the family!

Quick & easy, had leftovers to freeze for an even easier and quicker dinner later.  Found the proportions to be a little off, used 2 jars spaghetti sauce, 1 lb Italian sausage, added mushrooms and used 1 1/2 package rigatoni pasta.  Topped with mozzarella and whole pepperonis like a pizza--kids loved it!

This is a great starter recipe and easy to make additions and modifications.  I don't like jar spaghetti sauce so I always end up adding fresh herbs like rosemary or basil along with garlic to make it taste more homemade.  I halved this recipe and it was perfect for a family of 4!  Adding mozarella to the pasta as well as on top was a good suggestion from another reviewer.

This was a great crowd pleaser.  I prepared this for a group of 8 visitors from 4 different countries along with my family.  Everyone loved it.  I increased the recipe to make enough for 12 people so we would have leftovers.  Good-Luck, they ate almost all of it the first night and when I went to get it for lunch the next day I was told 2 of the teenage girls had beat me to it.  We will definitely make this again! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was easy and cheap. I didn't add the pep, the sausage was enough seasoning. Less pasta could have been used. Overall, family liked it and had enough for plenty of leftovers!

It was good, but I recommend cutting the recipe in half. It made so much that we got SICK of our leftovers.

Yum!  This is so easy and tastes delicious.  My husband does not like mushrooms so I omitted the mushrooms and I can't eat dairy so I only put cheese on half.  I also added some fresh basil leaves but I'm not sure if they added much.  I will totally make this again!

Really essy to make!  You need a BIG casserole dish to make this because it makes A LOT.  If you are not ready to eat this for two weeks in a row, you might want to cut the recipe in half, or eat some and freeze the rest for later.

Call it what you want, but this recipe was a huge hit with the family!  My son said it was the "best lasagna" I had ever made!  The great thing about this recipe is you can't mess it up!  Use more of the ingredients you like, leave out what you don't.  I added a lot more cheese and mixed it in with the meat.  I also placed pepperoni under the top layer of cheese.  Really, this recipe is a family/crowd pleaser.  It's not fancy...it's good and EASY!!!!!!!

This dish was quite yummy, very "family friendly". I did add some seasoning, herbs, and garlic to the meat when I was cooking it & also added a little red pepper flakes to liven it up a bit. But as a weekday quick and easy meal; it was great!

This was sooo good!!  I didn't have any manicotti so I used linguine instead.  I did use 2 jars of Ragu chuncky mushroom sauce and used 2 cans of mushrooms.  I also only used 1 pound of ground beef and I added some extra cheese on top to make it nice and cheesy.  I really liked the end result and would definately make again.  This filled up a 9x13 pan so it makes tons!!!

This recipe was great and very simple to make, but I did add a few things of my own to spice it up. It just can't be called manicotti without ricotta cheese, so I made a cheese mixture of half mozzarella and half ricotta with about a tablespoon of italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp of minced garlic and a pinch of crushed red peppers to give it a kick. I layered my baking dish with noodles, pepperoni slices, sauce and then the cheese mixture on top. With about 5 min. left to bake I sprinkled bread crumbs over the top. I served it in bowls and told my family to mix it up before eating. I will definitely make this again!

We tweaked this recipe a bit (garlic, onions, green peppers).  It turned out excellent!  It's a great launch pad for all sorts of ideas.

Very Good and Simple Recipe!  Thank you so much.  My family all raved over this on Day 1 and Day 2 they wanted more (the leftovers).  It was just as wonderful on the 2nd day along with some homemade rolls from a wonderful recipe on this site: Portuguese Sweet Bread I.  I will be making this regularly.  I changed a few things to our liking and to what we had on hand.  I took the pepperoni and pulsed it in the food processor until I had little bits and I used breakfast sausage (what I had on hand) I also added onions (sauted with the meat), italian seasoning,garlic powder,salt & pepper.  I also threw in some hot banana peppers that I pulsed in the food processor.  Yummy! This was delicious :)
Thanks again!

I was surprised at how easy and good this recipe really is!  My 5 year old loved it so much that he asked for again the next night for dinner and the day after that for lunch.  I made sure to season the ground beef while I was browning it (with garlic, onion, basil, italian seasoning, salt and pepper) and only used about 1/2 lb of sausage.  I also did not add the pepperoni as we are not pepperoni lovers here.  Overall very easy and will make again!

I made this tonight without the mushrooms and beef.  I just used a pound of hot italian sausage.  I am not a big fan of pasta so it wasn't my favorite dish, but my husband really enjoyed it.  I think I will try it with smaller noodles next time.  Very easy and inexpensive to make.  Thanks!

Quick, yet delicious.  I didn't add pepperoni because I had none.  I added garlic powder and Italian spices to the ground beef as I browned it.  I also substituted bow-tie pasta.  I have enough left over for another night of pasta!  Thank you.

I served this to my family and they all loved it. I found it to be a bit plain, but I guess it was worth sacraficing a little bit of taste for the little time it took to make. I made one 9x13 pan as per the recipe minus the mushrooms for the kids, and for the adults I made a 9x13 pan as per the recipe and added spicy spaghetti season, garlic powder, and seasoned diced tomatoes. This recipe makes a huge 9x13 definitely more than 8 large servings.

As far as ease in making this recipe is 10 stars!  The flavors were very mild which is great for kids. If you're looking for a gourmet meal this may not be it but it was a big hit for all my boys which is a plus.  Lots of meat!  I'll definitely keep this recipe, thank you!

This was a great quick, hearty and filling recipe. Next time I think I will add some spices (ground garlic or fresh minced) to the mixture, but otherwise very tasty. My boyfriend ate a huge slice of this casserole, then went back for another huge second slice. I will definitley make this again! Thank you!

Pretty good. I made this one night when I did not have a lot of time. It is super easy and pleased my husband's taste. I personally think it could of used some more interest in the flavor dept, but then again it was a pretty basic recipe! I'll definitely make it again though - good recipe!

This was fabulous.    I added some Italian seasonings and wine to the sauce while it simmered.   I only used ground italian sausage and cut down on the cheese a bit.     This was so good that my other half kept saying " man - this is really good - don't lose this recipe".

I first made this recipe to take to a potluck.  What a hit!!!!  Everyone raved about this casserole!!!  Even though they all asked for (and received) the recipe, I am now "required" to bring this dish on a regular basis.

I will make this recipe for years to come! I used 2 jars of 26 oz spag sauce and I thought that was just enough, even though the recipe called for 32 oz.  I left off the pepperoni's because there was so much meat already.  You definitely need to use a lasagna size pan.  It was great!

This was a big hit!  I did omit the sausage and used lean ground beef and turkey pepperoni instead--just to make it healthier. Great recipe, and so easy!

This is good.  Nothing fancy.  Quick and simple, no fuss meal.  My 6 and 3 year olds said it tasted like pizza!  I changed a few things like I omitted pepperoni and used pepperoni flavored pasta sauce, omitted mushrooms, and mixed a little cheese into the pasta/meat sauce mixture.  Will make again for sure!

I really enjoyed the casserole.  The only thing that I would do differently next time is mix some of the cheese in with the body of the casserole and not put all of it on the top.

I scaled this to 4 servings, so I left out the ground beef and just used the ground sausage.  I also left out the mushrooms as a matter of personal taste.  And I think that cubed pepperoni would work better next time.  The slices got dried out and were difficult for my kids to eat.  I did have about 8 oz of riccotta cheese in my fridge that needed to be used up , so I blended it in to the mix and it made all the difference.  A yummy cheesey creamy Itaian casserole!  (Where did the idea of naming this Manicotti come from anyway??)  Overall thumbs up.

I've been making a recipe like this for years, the only thing I leave out is the mushrooms, as they are not a favorite around here.  Very good recipe, nice flavor and easy to prepare!

it was pretty good...i added oregano and basil into the mixture.  i think next time i make it i'll put cheese throughout the mixture, instead of just a layer on top.  i like it to be cheesy all the way through!  my husband LOVED it though.
