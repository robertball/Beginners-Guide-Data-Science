This is a tasty recipe that needs more vegetables.  If you follow the recipe portions then you end up with way more noodles then vegetables.  There is enough liquid and oil to coat all the noodles well but I would either double the portions of the vegetables or half the amount of noodles.  I used a dry italian seasoning mix instead of the fresh basil and it turned out to be very good.

This recipe was good, but it needs more vegetables and more broth to go with that amount of pasta.  I did use whole wheat rotini, so I don't know if that made a difference.  Also, instead of the lima beans, I added a can of Northern beans.  The sauce has a nice flavor on its own, so I think this recipe has a lot of promise.

Not great.  Definitely double the vegetables.  All of my veggies were a little undercooked for my taste, though, especially the fresh green beans.  Not very much flavor.

This is possibly the best pasta sidedish I have ever had.  I doubled all the ingredients except for the pasta.  I didn't have fresh basil so I used basil pesto with garlic.  My husband who dislikes all the vegetables listed in the recipe ate over half of the dish. (no frozen limas available so used canned and added in with the pasta)  Scrumptious!!!!!

I love this recipe.  It is low in calories and tastes great.  I changed the noodle to a wide pasta and left out the lima beans, but it was delicious.  It took my husband back to Italy.  Thanks.

This was very good and easy to make.  I doubled the broccoli and asparagus as some reviewers suggested it did not have enough vegetables.  I also left out the green beans as I could not find them anywhere when I made this.  Even my kids liked this.  I would definelty make this again.

This was so good.  The sauce was suoerb!  I did alter the recipe which is what I love about it.  I use all frozen veggies, broc, cauli, carrot mix and a squash/ zucchini mix...let sit in the water for 5 min, drain.  the sauce I added a full cup of stock after reading the reviews about how the pasta absorbs it all.  Everyone really enjoyed this....my husband told me the next time I make this to add some chicken...yummy....maybe some white wine to the sauce as well.  Thank you for such an easy and nutrious dinner!
