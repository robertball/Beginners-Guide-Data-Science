This was very good, but I substituted fresh mushrooms for canned and I didn't use the microwave. Instead, I made the roux in the frying pan, and while I was doing that, I sauteed the mushrooms seperately. Then I added them to the roux (thickened butter/flour mixture), along with the half & half, wine, etc., and let that reduce a little while I sauteed the scallops, adding one small garlic clove to the scallops when they were almost done. The sauce was a little too thick, so I added addt'l wine and lemon juice to thin it out a little, and then added the scallops to the cream mixture. I served them over angel hair pasta, along w/fresh asparagus and a warmed baguette. It was very good, but I wished I had some chicken broth to thin it out and lighten the sauce a little. (I don't like heavy cream sauces, so it might be perfect for someone who does.)Next time, I will reduce the half & half to 1/4 cup, and use 1/4 cup chicken broth, having more on hand to add if needed. Also, I didn't add in the bay leaf.

Very flavorful.  I also used fresh mushrooms, to use canned would be a shame.  The sauce was a bit too thick so I thinned it out with more wine.  I did this whole recipe in a frying pan, I don't care for microwave cooking.  It turned out perfect!

I will be making this again

I made this recipe on the stove top instead of the microwave.  It's very simple to make even that way.  I made a few changes to the recipe, and it came out absolutely delicious.  I used sliced baby bella mushrooms instead of from a can; I didn't use the egg because the sauce was already thick enough, and it was fine without it. I also let it simmer altogether with the milk instead of adding it later.  I served it over pasta and enjoyed every single bite.  Definitely will make this again.

The recipe was good. I used the stovetop instead of the microwave and had a good result. Next time I will add maybe 1/2 clove of minced garlic and a splash more lemon juice. Excellent idea, I wouldn't have invented that on my own;)

I could not see doing this in the microwave for fear of turning the scallops into rubber.  Unlike sea scallops, bay scallops are small (about the size of a dime), and this recipe calls for a total of 11 minutes cooking time at high.  With the price of scallops, I was not about to risk ending up with something overcooked and inedible.  I cooked this on the stovetop, and it still was very quick, and I used freshly-sliced mushrooms rather than canned.  I served over a bed of angel hair pasta, and the flavor was pretty good.  I could see grating some freshly-grated parmesan over the top making it even better.

I've made this a few times, one of my favorite recipes for scallops... With some changes. I make it all in a skillet, not the microwave.  I use fresh mushrooms and onions. Added a bit more wine and lemon juice as the sauce tends to be very thick. Add a dash of red pepper flakes for some heat. Also add a dollop of plain Greek yogurt near the end for extra tang, and serve over pasta

I altered this recipe and my family loved it. Like most others, I did not make it in the microwave. I doubled the recipe, browned the scallops in the butter first, then added another 1/2 stick of butter to the juices to make the sauce. I used milk (instead of 1/2 & 1/2 or evaporated milk), added 2 cloves of garlic, just a little extra lemon juice and the juice that was in the canned mushrooms. My husband found the sauce bland so I added alot of fresh parsley and dill. If I had chicken broth, I would have added that for flavor and to thin the sauce. RIght before I served it I added a heap of sour cream for flavor and also to thin the sauce again as I was afraid milk wouls make it bland again. I will make this again but will use a dryer wine than Reisling (too sweet) or maybe sherry, chicken broth, more onions, and even more fresh herbs like chives. Maybe even some tomato paste or a dash of worstershire. Its a great base for a recipe and I will have fun playing with it a bit.

It was quick and easy, the sauce very tasty. I've made it a couple times now and each time I did use fresh mushrooms. Love Scallops !

I made a few changes.  Instead of parsley added red pepper flakes as I served it.  Instead of canned mushrooms I minced fresh mushrooms and added them to the melted butter before I made the roue.   Then added a few sliced mushrooms also. Served over angel hair.  It was delicious and I will make it again.

I didn't think scallops would come out tender made in the microwave but these did.  The recipe was very tasty.  Rich and Creamy!

Nice Recipe. Good for you using wine in any recipe; making it, if not French, certainly more tasty.
