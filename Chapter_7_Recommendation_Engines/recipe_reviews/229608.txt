pretty butt kickin' good! If you lay off the hot sauce, you end up with a great mild bloody mix as well (even with the horseradish) - that is in case you have guests that are wimps.

Everyone loved it. We used green tobasco, and probably would have liked a spicier kick for our Bloody Mary. The flavor is really good - especially liked the horseradish. Took a risk on this even though it only had one review. Good risk.

This is some good stuff!  Followed the recipe as written. One should probably like clams/oysters and spicy things to appreciate this recipe!

This is some good stuff! I still like mine a little more spicy so I used hot & spicy V-8. Also where I live beef paste isn't easy to come by, so I used 2 beef bullion cubes instead. I keep a jug mixed up in my man-cave fridge at all times!!

Scaled to 2 servings, this is my second night making this. I LOVE IT!!! I'm actually drinking it now "virgin," and the combo of favors is spot-on! Last night I made a Bloody Mary using Sriracha vodka, garnished with celery, pickle, and teriyaki beef stick, and it was as good as any restaurant/bar Bloody Mary... BETTER even. I used Cholula's Chili Garlic Hot Sauce and Low Sodium V8. I used beef base (less than called for) last night, and tonight I just added a couple fl.oz. beef broth. Sweet Goodness, I'm dying over how good this is!

I substituted Sriracha for the tabasco and used Clamato Juice instead of mixing the tomato and clam juice together.  Don't forget the garnish of 2 olives and a stalk of celery and a strip of crispy bacon.    Yum
BTW.  Freeze some of the mix and use it for ice cubes.  It keeps the drink from watering down

I love bloody Mary's and will say this is the best recipe/mix I have come across.  I like spicy and this one fits the bill along with great flavor!  If you prefer a Milder mix add less hot sauce.

This is the first Bloody Mary mix that I liked. We did make some changes. First, we only had Clamato juice. Then I adjusted to to 2 servings and accidentally added too much beef base. Everything else added was just right. We couldn't wait to let the mix meld for 8 hours in the fridge and still it was delicious. Next batch is in the fridge.

Absolutely delicious! I used 4oz of the clam juice and 4 TBS of horseradish to adjust it to my taste. Found my go-to recipe for sure!

Possibly if you like seafood, this would appeal to you. It was too spicy and brine-y for me!

I thought this was a great bloody mix but I like them spicy.  It was a little too much for some people at my party but I had a jug of regular vegetable juice in the fridge so they could mix that in to dilute the kick.

I will add to this... Overall its a GREAT recipe... I hate people who change the recipe SO much its a new recipe ... but I will make an exception. This will be to spicy for SOME! Just half the "hot sauce" and MAYBE the horse radish (depending on brand/type you use)... its easy to ADD this back in of you want it hotter, not so easy to take it out. Other than that great recipe, well done! Love the flavor better than any bar recipe I have had.
