This is one of my favorite recipes for pork loin.  I have made it for many years. The only thing I do differently is add about 1/2 cup of white wine with the onion soup mix and cranberry sauce.  I make the gravy right in the crock pot on high for 15 minutes while the roast rests covered with foil. I have even used a frozen pork loin on high in the crock-pot for 5 hours.  Very tender meat and delicious gravy. I often serve it with spatzle dumplings and applesauce.

I made this but I didn't have everything that the recipe called for, in fact the only thing I had was the Pork Roast, so I substituted.  Instead of the Onion Soup Mix, I had Lipton's Vegetable Soup Mix, so I put the meat in the slow cooker, emptied the soup on top of the meat; I had dried cranberries, piled them on top, added about a cup of Chicken Broth, then added some cutup potatoes, carrots and 2 celery stalks.  Followed the recipe from there.  The 2 tbsp of flour with some melted butter I did as instructed and then took that and poured it into the juice, which was very lumpy because of the cranberries.  I can not believe how delicious this was.  I was afraid I might have ruined a perfectly good pork roast and it ended up coming out absolutely delicious.  Will save as a favorite!  Thanks Lawrence for the recipe idea!

I was so pleasantly surprised by this roast. It turned out tender and juicy. The gravy was wonderful. My mother in law is elderly and doesn't eat a lot of meat and she gobbled this up. Will make this again. Simple but effective.

First of all I want to say that my family and I LOVE "GOOD" food and are not picky at all.  I used a 5lb frozen pork loin roast, doubled the amount of Lipton Onion Soup Mix (2 pkgs.) and 2 cans of ocean spray whole berry cranberry sauce (which are 14-1/2 oz each NOT 16oz.) We like a lot of sauce/gravy!  I seasoned my roast then rubbed with the soup mix, then placed in my crockpot set for 8 hours, poured "mixed" cranberry sauce over roast and covered.  Roast was completely cooked and extremely moist (and not falling/shredding apart) after 6 hours so I removed and let it rest for a couple of hours while I prepared my herb roasted potatoes and asparagus.  I proceeded to make a roux with butter and flour (ingredients doubled) and then slowly mixed it in the gravy.  I have to say the roast was AMAZING and sliced beautifully.  The gravy tasted good at first but then I started not liking it as much.  My husband liked it and said it was "different" but my boys 15 and 10 ate it BUT were not fond of it.  Actually they said they would prefer if I didn't make it again.  Anyway, I did make some Polish egg noodles after tasting the gravy thinking it would pair together better which it did.  Just NOT our favorite.  If you like REALLY REALLY SWEET sauce/gravy, this is definitely for you.  I don't think I will make this again, SORRY!  I'm not one to use "pre-packaged" anything so maybe that's why I wasn't impressed with the flavors (NOT SURE). Thanks for the experience though!~

I used homemade cranberry sauce (Cranberry Sauce Extraordinaire) from AR. Husband thought this was a great recipe. Thank you.

Didn't have whole berry so I used jellied instead and added a little water to the crockpot. I also made the gravy (which was delicious) in the crockpot on high, after I took the meat out.  It turned out great and got rave reviews. So tender and juicy. Will definitely make again.

Used a center cut loin roast I found on sale.  Didn't have 8hrs so 5 on high worked out fine (thanks to reviewer who mentioned that). Shredded it and topped with sauce.  Made a pan of cornbread dressing for a perfect side.  DH mentioned it is his new fav.  He said he couldn't taste the soup mix!  I wouldn't have believed this would be so tasty.  The reviews convinced me to try and couldn't be happier to have a new keeper!

Fabulous! The roast fell apart so that you couldn't even cut it. The only thing I wish I had done was cooked it on low for 6 hours instead, the 8 hours was too long for my smaller 2lbs roast and dried the meat out. Also-I did not have cranberry sauce, so I subbed in chunk canned pineapple and it worked ok, I'm sure the cranberry is SO much better with that sweet bitterness. I still made the gravy and the family ate it up! Will make this again!! :D

I just put it in the slow cooker.  I had home-made cranberry sauce, but not sure I had the equivalent of 16 oz. so I added some fresh squeezed orange juice and a little honey-pineapple mustard.  The recipe sounds awesome, obviously should be good with poultry as well.  Serving over mashed potatoes because I have some left over, but would be nice with jasmine rice too.

I made this recipe as a try-out, having just bought a new slow cooker, and a pork roast by chance on the same dayl  I was a bit sceptical as  I put the roast in the pot, but the rewards at the end of cooking were indeed great.  This is now my go-to comfort food recipe with lots of mashed potatoes, a steamed veggie and a crisp green salad.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Would definitely make this again. However, I took off a star because it is easier and cleaner to make the sauce in the slow cooker itself. I moved my meat into a foil wrap, put it on high, and added the two tablespoons butter and then slowly added the flour. It worked just as well and was much cleaner than wasting another pan.

The only difference I made was I used a pork tenderloin because they didn't have the sirloin and the the meat practically fell apart! The gravy is delicious! Love this recipe : )

Fantastic recipe! I'm on weight watchers so wanted to make this leaner so I used a 3lb pork shoulder. For the gravy I removed the roast from the slow cooker, covered it in foil, then just mixed a little cornstarch paste in. Turned out really well and it was so easy!

Unexpectedly porking good recipe! I didn't make any adjustments just followed the recipe and it was super yum! Tasted like bbq pork! What makes this dish is the gravy for sure. Adding this to the regular dinner rotation.

Good with pork. Even better with turkey. I bought a turkey roast (all the meat, no bones!) and used double the soup mix. Holy cannoli!

Made with a 2 1/2 lb. pork shoulder roast.  Added half an onion (quartered) and some mini carrots, along with 1 cup chardonnay.  Also, salted the pork.  Everything else the same.  Cooked on low for 8 hrs.  Made gravy by adding flour and water.  Served with mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas with mint from this site.  Sooooooo good!

This was a big hit with the hubs. Minor changes included using a healthy coating of Mis Rubin’s White Magic Seasoning on the roast instead of the onion soup mix and adding a half cup of white wine as suggested by another reviewer.  We used a cheap moscato as it’s what we had in house but it came out very well.  For a three and a half pound pork roast, we cooked on low for five hours as we aren’t fans of dry roasts.  The good thing is even if you over cook it, the sauce/gravy will save it.  Seriously, don’t skip the sauce.  We liked it so much we did a double batch of the sauce using up all the crockpot liquid.  Thanks for the recipe!  Definite keeper!

Made this today for the family. My wife LOVED it. I didn't have any canned cranberry sauce, but I had some frozen cranberries, so I made fresh cranberry sauce. Besides that I made this as per recipe. I served it with roasted potatoes, carrots, rutabaga, and mushrooms. Will definitely be making this again.

EXCELLENT! Note: I used a 3.14 lb. beef sirloin roast (instead of pork); doubled the whole cranberry sauce, soup mix, butter, and flour; added carrots, celery, and baby potatoes (instead of adding separately);  mixed the soup mix and cranberry sauce together and simply poured the cranberry sauce/onion soup mixture over everything in the slow cooker (not including the flour and butter, yet). Also, as another reviewer mentioned, after removing the roast and vegetables, I added the butter, flour, salt, and pepper directly to the remaining mixture and made the gravy right in the slow cooker. Served with flaky Pillsbury biscuits and spicy mint jelly...PERFECT! . . . One Last Note: Only needed to cook 7 1/2 hours on low.

This was delicious; savory and slightly sweet. My pork loin was about 6 lb. so I doubled the onion mix. I left the cranberries at the suggested one can, and set the crock pot for six hours. I served it with baby red potatoes and green beans. The gravy/sauce whipped up in minutes. This will be a nice recipe to throw together before work and have dinner ready quickly at night. Super easy.

My 2.5 lb roast was done in 6 hrs on low; it was so tender. Didn't make the flour gravy - sauce was great without any additions.

Made as directed. The roast was tender and flavourful, however, the sauce was much too sweet for our liking.

Great recipe.  I used a 3 lb center cut boneless pork loin and followed the directions.  Added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and a half cup of white wine.  Cooked on low for 5.5 hours and it literally fell apart.  The gravy is so good.

Cranberry sauce just absolutely made the whole thing. After salt and pepper The Taste, the sweetness balances out perfectly with the saltiness. I actually can't get enough of it, I've had it for leftovers last 3 days LOL. So whoever make this, absolutely love it oh, and let it gravy perfect Parsons. The two tablespoons of flour, and 2 tablespoons of butter makes 2 cups of the dripping just just to die for

I got a call from my fiance while he was at the grocery store one Sunday. He said, "Now, it's YOUR turn...make the 2 small pork roasts the way YOU want to make them!! Need anything from the store for the meal?". I decided to try a new, different recipe from my basic salt, pepper, and oven-roasted pork roasts. 

I found this easy recipe for the slow cooker, and despite the fact that he & I BOTH hate cranberries, in any form but a juice cocktail, I used the remaining ingredients and used 2 cups of water to replace the moisture lost by removing the cranberry sauce.  WE LOVED IT!!  

ONE TIP & ONE NOTE OF CAUTION: My fiance, not realizing how salty the dry onion soup mix could make the meat when he used ONE pouch of soup mix per roast (2 so far) PLUS one pouch in the water for the veggies for a TOTAL of THREE pouches of dry onion soup!!  We messaged the dry soup into the Meat and allowed them to rest for 30-45 minutes BEFORE turning on the slow cooker & adding the water. Just as with smoking meats using a dry rub, allowing the meat to rest in THIS recipe is just as important for the "rub" to be fully absorbed by the meat.  HOWEVER, if you try OUR VARIATION, limit the number of pouches of dry soup mix to TWO (2), MAX!! The end result was SPECTACULAR, and the ONLY drawback was the meat was a bit on the salty side!!  The FLAVOR was AWESOME, but if the potatoes & onions we added were NOT added, it would've been TOO salty!! A great dinner option, nonetheless!!

The only change I made was to add my homemade cranberry sauce instead of canned sauce.  Absolutely loved the extra little tang the sauce gave to the gravy.  Will certainly be making again.

This was absolutely yummy!! I didn’t have all the ingredients but I did have a pork tenderloin and onion soup mix so I added these and some dried cranberries and sliced apples. I used 1cup of sodium free chicken bouillon as the liquid. The gravy however was definitely the bomb!! I served the meat with rice and green beans and put the gravy over rice and meat. The cooked apples also were a hit!! I definitely will make this again and maybe substitute chicken. Thank you for a great recipe!

When I went to make this I found I had no cranberry so I rubbed the meat with onion soup mix and I added a can of apple pie filling. I took out the apples after about 6 hours and saved them.  Just b fore the meat was done I mixed the apples with applesauce, a splash of vinegar, a pinch of cinnamon and put it on the table with the rice green beans and meet. My family,used it to dip the meat and loved it.

Absolutely delicious-RAVE reviews-I'm trying the same thing with chicken (the other white meat??)tonight-hope it works ...The  pork roast was tender, juicy, love the sauce-made the gravy and it was GONE!

This is an excellent recipe for pork roast!  I, too, as mentioned by someone else,  mixed the dry onion mix and the cranberry sauce together and then added to the roast. The gravy was delicious as well.

I didn't have onion soup mix so I used garlic powder and dried onions instead. I also used jellied cranberry sauce instead if the whole berries. It came out very tender and good. The gravy was a bit sweet with the cranberry sauce.

It was good, had short amount of time, cooked on high for one hour, then low for 2.5 hours, when I checked it, it seemed like I had waited too long. It was nice and juicy, very flavorful. Husband liked it, but neither of us LOVED it. May make again because it was super easy.

I’ve made this roast for years, but never make the gravy.  I pour the juice over any leftover pork to keep it moist while it’s in the fridge. It makes great leftovers!

Good recipe. Added a little white wine and after it was done, removed the pork, mixed package pork gravy with about 3/4 cup water, added it to the juices and cooked on high until thickened.  Will certainly make again

My husband told me 3 times during the meal how delicious this was.. Followed the recipe exactly, and cooked on low for about 6 hours, then turned on low to keep warm till dinner time.  My sister made it the next day, and added a small amount of liquid smoke & cayenne pepper for a delicious BBQ version..

I had a 1.5 lb. roast. I followed the directions with the following exceptions: added 1/2 cup of wine as others suggested, added some carrots and potatoes, and cooked my small roast on high for only 3 hrs. The roast was the cooked perfectly... moist and tender. the gravy was very good and absolutely necessary. Why only 3 stars? We just thought the dish was "okay", not remarkable.

I made this exactly as written, and it turned out perfectly! My guests loved it, and all asked for the recipe. It was so easy, I was almost embarrassed to tell them! The meat was extremely tender, and delicious. I served it with poppy seed noodles, that were perfect for the sauce.

If cooking time is reduced this is sooo easy and so good.   I have made it twice.  The first time I made it with what I had on hand and had no cranberry sauce.  I had some peach preserves and substituted with about 3 1/2 tablespoons of the preserves.  
The sauce was outstanding.  But the cooking time was WAY too long.  Pork cuts now are usually very lean and just a little too much cooking time makes for very dry meat. Second time I made with the cranberry sauce and reduced cooking time significantly.  It was delicious.  Don't know which sauce was better but will make this again.  Very easy. Very good.  Lots of wiggle room for creativity.

My husband really enjoyed this pork roast. I think I may have over cooked it as I found it to be a little dry. It did have good flavor and was very easy to ptepare. Will try again!

I have never cooked any kind of pork roast.  It turned out beautifully.  The sauce/gravy was divine; my husband cleaned his plate.

When I read the reviews I thought this roast would be delicious but after eating it we said it was Ok. Used a 2lb boneless sirloin pork roast  as directed and slow cooked it  for 2 hours. It was  turned out a bit dry so I shredded the meat , mixed it with the the cranberry/onion soup mixture. and served it with slow cooked  buttered small red potatoes. My husband commented "Well that's different". It won't be on my favorite list but I'm glad some folks liked it.

Cooked 3 pound bone in roast on high for 5 hours, it was done. . Hubs doesn’t like sweet meats but he ate it. I’ll eat the leftovers tomorrow but doubt that I’ll fix it again.

Best pork roast recipe I have made. Wasn’t sure how the cranberry flavor would do, but with the onion soup mix, it was perfect. The heavy so delicious and was awesome on the mashed potatoes! I cut the roast into two smaller pieces before applying the rub. It turned out great. My picky son had thirds!

It was pretty good the first day.  My husband really liked it served over rice.  There was a lot left over, so I pulled the rest of the roast, combined it with the leftover sauce, a sliced onion, some barbecue sauce, and liquid smoke, and let the whole thing simmer for about 90 minutes.  For some reason, the cranberry flavor was stronger the second time, and I liked that even better.

This is my absolute favorite way to make pork. Hands down. It also, conversely, makes the best gravy that my husband had ever had. I have made it many many times. Highly recommended. 
P.s. it's also really good if you use both onion packets, btw. Mmmm.

I used a pork tenderloin. I followed the recipe and my family loved it! I would use jellied cranberry sauce next time. The whole berries left the skin behind and made the gravy lumpy. That’s the only reason i gave it a 4 star.

I just dumped the frozen pork roast in,  put the onion soup on top,  carefully placed (in other words, dumped) the can of cranberries in,  set it on low and left for most of the day.  When I got home I removed the roast, made a gravy out of the drippings and served it sliced with the sauce on top and it was absolutely wonderful!  Family loved it.......

Delicious--husband loved it.
I substituted because I didn't have all the ingredients.
Sub:  Mrs. Grass' dry salad mix  instead of dry onion mix.
Sub:   jellied cranberry sauce for whole berry and added about I/3 cup water.  I should have added a bit more of water since it was quite rich.
Will make again!

I made this and my husband and I loved it. I did add 1/2 cup of apple cider. I did that because it was part of a different recipe I got from a friend. Her gravy was too sweet, but this recipe with the onion soup mix made it perfect. I will make it again for the next family dinner.

Very good Recipe.  I did however rub the roast with the powdery part of the onion soup mix then bake on convect roast at 475 degrees for 20 minutes prior to putting everything in the crock pot.  Roast was juicy and wonderful.

I will absolutely make this again. The only thing I did different was cook it on low for 5 hours because my roast was only 2 lbs. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was simple and delicious. Thank you for sharing this.

This was a huge hit!  The flavor of the pork roast is amazing!  I did add a 1/2 cup of white wine and will always do that.  This will become our favorite way to make a pork roast!

I made it as written and everyone loved it! I used a 3.5 lb organic pork butt roast and cooked it for the full 10 hours. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. I’m sure the fat content was a bit high but it was a special occasion!

Pleasantly surprised.  With the ingredient list being small and simple, I expected something that wasn’t flavorful.  I’m impressed.   I do believe I should have gotten a larger roast.  My family of 4 ate it all and left little for me.  However, based on their reaction (and what little nibble I got), it was worth rating.

I cooked it for 7 hours and I added brussell sproats to the juices  two hours before finishing. I didn't make any gravy as the juice was so good. I poured the juice over my perogies.

I used a 14 ounce can of cranberry sauce with whole cranberries, and half a packet of the soup mix.  I rubbed the soup mix all over the loin, then put a layer of cranberry sauce in the bottom of the crock pot and put the loin on top.  Then I put the rest of the cranberry sauce on top of it.   My pork loin was 3.5 pounds, and I cooked it for 7 and a half hours. It doesn't need cooked longer; you can over cook pork loin.  It turned out very juicy and tender. It was so tender that it was hard to get it to cut without completely falling apart!  I didn't make gravy with the juices because I saw that mono sodium glutamate was in the ingredients, plus it was so tender that it didn't really need gravy. I ate mine with a candied sweet potato and some tasty steamed kale.

This was a delicious recipe.  Tender.  Moist.  Very flavourful - and so easy!  I laughed when I saw this recipe because our favourite beef pot roast recipe  swaps out the cranberry sauce for cream of mushroom soup.  It is wonderful too. I often use the allrecipes dry soup mix in place of the commercial brand - less salt.

I used the onion soup mix, some dried cranberries  with some  cranberry compote. It was fine but not quite as tasty as I'd hoped and the pork was a little dry-dry pork isn't something I have experienced in a slow cooker so perhaps Low for 4 hrs was too much, I'm not sure.

This turned out way better than I thought! I thought that I had messed up the gravy part by the way it looked visually, but it tasted very good. I actually used pork sirloin chops for this, and they were fine.

Delish! I didn't even need to use flour to thicken it up. In all honesty I forgot the flour part with the salt and pepper. So tender, I actually did 10 hours and not even one stir.

I had some sirloin pork roast that I didn't know what to do with. I made this recipe  as written. Mixed the cranberry and onion soup together and cooked it 8 hrs on low. There was a lot of sauce and I shredded pork in sauce.   It wasn't greasy as I think sirloin cut was very lean.   served it with mash pot and  with the leftovers we had sandwiches in french roll

I did add white wine like another reviewer suggested and only cooked for about 4 hours and it came out perfect. I'm not usually a fan of savory/sweet but this was really good.Keeping in my recipe collection for sure.

This was only ok. I tasted the gravy before serving and was not impressed. I added some canned broth and salt to it.Once the gravy was served over the meat and mashed potatoes it did taste better but  I don't think I will make this again. Thanks anyways!

I didn't have onion soup mix so I used diced onions, two beef bouillon cubes, garlic powder salt and pepper. Also I used cranberry sauce instead of the berries. So good!  The gravy was great too!  Had baked potatoes and fresh veggies on the side. Next time I'll make mashed potatoes with it.

Oh my stars this was delicious! I changed nothing except for making the cranberry sauce by using a pack of cranberries left over from Thanksgiving - just followed the standard recipe on the back. I did rub the soup mix in the roast and then poured the cranberry sauce over it. Just mixed a little Wondra flour into the drippings to make the gravy and voila,  I had a winner!

The flavor of this was good, although a 1/2 pack on onion soup mix would probably have been enough.  Mine came out of the slow cooker like pulled pork, so could not slice like I had planned.  Everyone just got a "glop" of it. Would not recommend for a holiday/formal meal where presentation might be important.

Made exact recipe and loved it. I played with the cooking temperature and managed to get it to 175 deg F. in about 4 1/2 hours.  Nice change from traditional Pork Roast.

Very good.  I added baby potatoes and carrots...went to work, and cooked on low for 10 hours.  Nice dinner to come home to. Will be doing this recipe again.

This is an excellent recipe, love the flavors. Watch the time though - very easy to overcook the meat.

I had 22 women for a potluck today but I made the main courses; chicken and slow cooker pork loin. The hit of the party was the roast and everyone wanted the recipe. I had a 5 lb pork loin so doubled the dry soup mix and cranberry sauce, slow-cooked on low for 8 hours and it was delicious and I will definitely make this again.

This is the second time I have made this easy and delicious pork roast. The only thing I did different was to add some sliced sweet potatoes with the peels on and they were yummy in the delicious gravy with the cranberries. I would not change a thing with this recipe and highly recommend it.     Colorado Karen

I didn't have a can of cranberries like I thought I did so I substituted mandarin oranges. Still used the dry onion soup mix, added minced garlic and minced ginger, and some water. It turned out delicious. Made a nice gravy to serve over rice. Yummy. I'll definitely be trying this with cranberries though, with some stuffing.

I put my roast in frozen because I new I would not be home for 6 hours and my  crock pot cooks a little fast.  I added quartered potatoes, carrots and red onion.  I did not rub the roast, but simply dumped onion soup and cranberries on top and turned in on low.  When I came home my house smelled like my grandma had been cooking in it all day!   I turned the crockpot off, added the butter to the top and sifted cornstarch over the top.. A little mixing and a dash of pepper and the gravy and whole meal was done!   So easy!  The sauce was delicious and the meat was tender.  The vegies had a nice flavor from cooking in the sauce all day!

I only used half a can of cranberry sauce and I completely forgot to make the gravy and it was still delicious. There was so much juice already in the crock pot that I just used that as gravy. It went really well with mashed potatoes.

I happened to be looking for a recipe for pork because I'd bought a couple of roasts on sale and wanted to make something different, which is how I ended up here! 

I didn't have any onion soup or whole cranberry sauce, so I used a can of jellied cranberry sauce and a whole, diced, onion. I added some seasoning and cooked for about 6 hours. 

It turned out AMAZiNG. It was falling right apart and was so tender and juicy. 

I made the gravy, too, and there was so much of it that there was plenty leftover for another day. 

It was quite sweet, so if you aren't into eating sweet dishes for a main meal, then this isn't for you, but I played with it a little and cut the sweet down a bit for members of my family who weren't so keen on that, by just omitting the gravy. 

Absolutely delightful, very much enjoyed by all members of the household, except my husband who doesn't eat pork, though he said it smelled so good! 

Thanks for sharing - would honestly never have put cranberry anything with pork if it wasn't for this recipe. I usually use pineapple!

This was the second time I made this recipe. The first time I used a roast that was thawed, and it was tough, but good. This time I used a roast that was frozen solid. This one fell apart as I sliced it. It would have been perfect for shredded pork. The pork tasted good, but the gravy was too sweet for my taste; I prefer savory gravy. That's the only reason for the four stars. The roast itself was really good, and I will be making it again. I served it with the Steakhouse Black Bread recipe by MAGGIE MCGUIRE. Thanks!

Such an easy dish with very minimal prep time required. It tasted great, everyone here loved it and the gravy you make at the end was quick, easy and had a nice flavor.

Our roast was 4.5 pounds so I did use 2 packets of onion mix to cover it completely. 

I will make it again ant won't change a thing!

Delicious moist pork roast!  To this recipe I added 1 tablespoon minced garlic and 1/4 cup of water, cooked on low, and it was ready in 6.5 hours.  I removed the roast and added 2 teaspoons of pan searing flour to the liquid in the slow cooker to thicken it for gravy.  I served the pork with mashed potatoes and green beans.  I will definitely make it again!

Wow this was good! Four adults and three picky children here loved this. I made my own dried onion soup mix with low salt bouillon (I mix onion powder and water to a paste) and about two tablespoons of dried onion, and used homemade cranberry sauce (mine is a trifle lower on the sugar) with a boneless pork shoulder roast. Six hours was perfect in my large oval pot, rendering it tender but still sliceable. I did not want shredded pork. The gravy made with the drippings was heavenly. I will make this often.

Really good, and ridiculously easy. Rub the mix on, empty the cranberries, turn on crock pot. You don't even need the gravy if you don't want to; it's great without it.

Wow. Perfectly perfect exactly as written. Left in crock pot all day. Watched at the end. Needed to add about 1 1/2 cup water to crock pot drippings to make gravy (and add to butter/flour roux). Only salted and peppered once pork was plated.

The idea of this recipe is so strange,  but it absolutely works!!!  Tasting it, I would never guess that there was cranberry sauce in it!  ( my pork was frozen and didn't think I could "rub" it with the onion soup mix, so I mixed the onion soup and cranberry sauce together, then poured over the pork) The gravy is a beautiful rusty brown color (I strained it before adding to the flour/butter roux so that it's smooth).  It is savory with just a slight hint of sweetness.  I'm rating a 4 simply because the meat is dry and is falling apart... I will take it out sooner next time so that it can be sliced.  I will definitely make again!  Quick, easy, and made with items right in my pantry!

Love it!  ...  I cooked a four pound pork roast with one can of cranberry sauce mixed with two packs of onion soup mix poured over the top in the slow cooker (LOVE my Instant Pot!!) and added two gurgles (LOL) of red wine.   It cooked for nine hours on low.  The cranberry part of the mixture stayed on top of the roast, and I left it there to serve as a sort of relish rather than mixing it into the gravy.  Made the gravy as directed otherwise, and found it to be extraordinarily delicious.  I sliced the roast, put a quarter cup of gravy and a thick slice of roast individually in freezer baggies, and will enjoy this roast over quite a period of time, served from the freezer with potatoes and a veggie.  I give it four stars only because the roast came out a little dry, which means the next time I make it I will shorten the cooking time....

This was delicious!  I was surprised how flavorful  the sauce was.  It is a sweet sauce, but no overly sweet.  So easy, and so good.

WOW! I made this last night. I didn't have have access to a slow cooker so I ended up cooking it in the oven. 450 for 10 minutes then I reduced the temp to 250 and cooked it til the internal temp was 145 degrees. Then I covered with foil and let rest. I wish I had taken a picture. It was SO moist and so so good. Someone suggested adding some white wine so I did that 1/4c and I also didn't make the gravy. Thank you. This will go into the regular rotation.

My family absolutely loved this. The only thing I changed was I used jellied cranberry instead of whole cranberry and I only cooked the 2.17 pound roast for 4 hours on low. It was amazing! Definitely one of our most favorite recipes!!

I took turnerbeth's advice and added 1/2 cup of white wine. (red wine would work too) It was excellent. Everyone loved it. It tasted as though I spent much more time and effort!!

I would add some brown sugar or honey.  It needed a sweet ingredient.  The cranberry sauce was too tart.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  We wanted a pork roast in the slow cooker and found this recipe.  Lipton Onion Soup and cranberry sauce really do go together.  The meat was so tender, we shredded it and added back to sauce.  We served over Jasmine rice, so good.  Only change was raw onion rings under the roast (my husband likes onions).  It was a nice addition.  This recipe is a keeper, thanks!

Very easy to prep and make. Delicious! My only suggestion would be to only cook it on low for 6 hours if you want it to come out solid. Did I mention it was delicious?

This has very good flavor, and is extremely easy and simple to prepare. but my roast turned out dry. Sirloin roast is lower in fat so better for you, but I will try another cut next time.

Loved it!  So easy and so good.  I added a tiny bit of salt to the gravy to balance the sweetness of the drippings, but was so good.  I will make again!

It was easy. My wife mixed the cranberry and Onion soup and a little water and poured it over the roast . Threw it in the crock pot. In morning. After work, I added butter and flour to make gravy and it was delicious. We loved it! It looks like we have a new favorite.

Great recipe!  Definitely a keeper.  I cooked on high for 2 hours in the crock pot and then turned to low for 4 more hours and it turned out great.  Couldn't find cranberry sauce and used candied cranberries in a can instead.  I skipped the wine as some suggested, and added about a half cup of chicken stock.  The gravy was fabulous!  Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe is so delicious!  Perfect for the holidays!  The star is that delicious cranberry "gravy".  I could have just eaten that over some mashed potatoes all day long!

Great flavor! I think I cooked it too long, though, because it fell apart when I removed it from the cooker and was a bit dry. The gravy helped. Otherwise a really good, easy recipe that even my two picky kids gobbled up!
