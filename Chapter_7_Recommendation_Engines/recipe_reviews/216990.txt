Using a pre-made bottom pie crust and a rolled out pie crust for the top, the pie baked rather nicely. I followed the recipe for the filling as stated, but found that when my pie baked, it spilled out horribly every where in the baking pan I placed the pie on for spilling purposes. Even with 1 1/4 cup of sugar the pie filling was rather tart. Hubby didn't care for it...son and I agreed it was okay, we are not big on tart fruit pies, 2 of my 3 daughters said it was good with ice cream. Not sure if I will go all out and make again. Just because it was so so in my house. However, if you are a real big fan of Rhubarb, then it's probably for you.
