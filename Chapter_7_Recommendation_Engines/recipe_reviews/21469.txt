Before my changes a 3 star.  After, a 5! Wow, you have to try this.  I made it for Christmas morning and everyone loved it. I changed the following: I used day old sliced french baguette bread, I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the egg mix.  I used 7 instead od 12 eggs.  I also creamed the cream cheese, not leaving it as cubes. Try it, you'll love it!

I love to make this as the main dish at a small brunch of women.  It is a hit and is even good without the blueberries(which I don't use if they are too expensive).

I'm not sure what happened, but this didn't turn out at all.  It wasn't sweet enough so I would recommend adding some sugar with the eggs.  I would also recommend using french bread, or something much thicker to absorb the eggs.  I would also use less eggs to avoid the dish coming out mushy.  Lastly, I would cream some sugar and cheese so it comes out smooth and creamier.

I made a few changes to this recipe.  I used a loaf of day old French bread, added sugar, cinnamon, and syrup to the egg mix.  It really needs day old bread to absorb all the eggs, cook until the center is spongy.

We loved this!!  i had  fresh blueberries, but since it's cooked, i figure frozen would be just as good.  i also used old sourdough bread and buttermilk - wow!  thanks for this great breakfast.  i am always looking for ways to use eggs and this recipe is great for sunday morning when i really don't want to cook.  thanks again!

I had this yesterday at my Bible Studay and was so hoping I could find the recipe online! Was so excited to see it here. This is exactly what the lady was descriving was in hers. A lot of people seem to think it tasted bland. I can agree that it would be...but the lady who brought it also had a blueberry sauce to pour over the top. That was soooo delicious and I bet that would add the sweetness/flavor that a lot of you think is missing. The lady also said she only used 1 brick of cream cheese. I can't wait to make this for my husband!

I made a version of this for Christmas morning and everyone loved it!  Ages 2 - 62.  I am making this again for tomorrow morning, and I am making a few alterations....      If you are making a 8 or 10 serving batch, I would cut the eggs to 10.  The first time I made this, I noticed that it was a little soupy when I took it out of the frig, so I drained about 2 eggs worth (it still came out wonderful!).      The first time, I used blueberries.  After I sprinkled the cream cheese and blueberries over the first layer, I sprinkled sugar over everything.  This time I am using frozen strawberries (which have sugar added), so I didn't add sugar.      I added about 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of vanilla to the egg and milk wash before I poured it.      Keep maple syrup handy for those pancake lovers or there is a recipe for blueberry syrup on one of the other french toast recipes!

My variation is to cut back on the egg (10),whip the cream cheese and instead of Blueberries I use banana.  This is the dish we use for my monthly family brunch. There is not a sole that doesn't like this dish, even my pickiest eater!

I will use one package of cream cheese next time and cut it into smaller pieces but otherwise DELICIOUS!  Everyone in my family loved it (from ages 8 to 70) and it was easy to put to together.

Too many eggs, makes it soggy.  Cream sugar in with the creamed cheese, its not sweet enough.  1/4 should be enough.  I made with peaches instead of blueberries because I didn't have them.  I'll make again with these revisions.

I agree with the previous reviewer - if I ever made this recipe again - I would cream sugar and the cream cheese together - maybe spread as a layer instead of chunks.  .....You know - if you took away the blueberries and cream cheese - and added cooked maple sausage chunks instead - they maybe this recipe would work!

Again another recipe I decided to try while away visiting my bf as he is stationed in Guantanamo Bay.  It ended up going to work with him in the am and was a hit!  I ended up making a blueberry sauce instead of just using syrup with it and it definitely is a thought to add as it sweetened it up quite a bit!

I have made this two different times and it has been a big hit with everyone.  The only thing I did differently was with the cream cheese I got the cream chesse with the blueberry flavor and I still added the frozen blueberries and everyone raved about it.  It is a winner in our household.

This was a VERY disappointing recipe. I was wanting a rich, decadent french toast recipe. This fell very short. It was bland and was missing sweetness that goes with French Toast. The concept is great though and I plan to figure out how to make this recipe more delicious.

Tried it out with strawberries using old fashion bread , the family loved it. I Cut out 2 eggs and only used one can of evaporated milk. I topped it off with cool whip ...yummy delicious. Its similar to Mexican bread pudding just give it enough time in the oven without the foil so it gets nice and brown.

2nd note..I used frozen blueberries as fresh not available.  If you do that compensate for their moistness by really reducing the liquid or adding some flour.

Not at all what i expected. Cream cheese didn't melt at all. Gave most of it away to adult kids who usually love everything I make... There were no comments.

I made this a second time and added the following; Instead of just blueberries, add an even layer of mixed berries over the cream cheese. I also added vanilla to the egg mixture. I took the remaining berries, 2 cups, and added a cup of sugar and slowly simmered them for 30 minutes. Pour this mixture over each serving, and you have enough sweetness to make this an amazing breakfast surprise. Yum!!!!

A hit for Valentine's Day brunch! I used 10 eggs instead of 12 but may also cut it back to 8 the next time I make it. I didn't use all of the 2 blocks of cream cheese either. However, I put some cream cheese in the egg/milk/syrup mix to pour. I also added sugar to that mix to sweeten it up. It's easy to adjust the blueberries too (one of my eaters isn't a fan of the fruit so I kept them out of that end of the pan). Once I took off the foil, I baked it for about 25 minutes.

Came out delicious with a few tweaks. I added vanilla extract to egg mixture and also sugar to sweeten instead of maple syrup. I didn't have block cream cheese and used whipped, still came out great! I would make this again

Just a few changes, took another writers idea to use 7 eggs. Added blackberries and raspberries along with the blueberries, about 3 cups total. I also used buttermilk because that's what I had.sprinkled cinnamon sugar liberally on top. Brunch perfection!

This was pretty good, I used whipped cream cheese and I think that made it better. I took to work for a potluck and everyone loved it.

We made this and the Charleston Breakfast Casserole for New Years Eve brunch. They were so good, we made them again for New Years day!

Didn't really like this.  The cream cheese doesn't really go well with the recipe.

this is a great thing to make on a Sat night when you know that you don't want to make a big breakfast on Sun, lol. I'm not a big fan of the cream cheese so next time I will omit that part and definetly be adding cinnamon, nutmeg and maybe a little sugar. I tried it with Eggnog instead of regular milk and I could taste it a little, not overpowering.
