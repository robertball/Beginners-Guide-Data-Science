The rolls were soft and good.  I had to add more flour than the 6 1/2 cups called for.  After I got the flour added it wasn't the consistency for kneading so just added more until it was, trying not to add too much to keep it a soft dough.  I think I could have added a bit more flour.  My son, who is a chef, suggested using the potato water for the yeast and not using that other 1/2 cup (just don't get the water too warm and kill the yeast).  Instead of making mashed potatoes I made instant using just milk and water in them.  For the potato water I used the same bowl I had cooked the instant potatoes in and added a few potato flakes then heated it up.  I also rolled the dough out to about 6 inches bigger than called for because at the size suggested it was thicker than we like our cinnamon rolls.  Because of this I got about 30 rolls instead of 24.  We like nuts and raisins in ours so I added some of those to the filling too.
